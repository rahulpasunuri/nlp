I had really high hopes for this, but honestly just thought it was pretty ordinary.

Delicious and easy. Consistency of vinagrette was fine for the dish. Used macadamia nuts instead of hazelnuts.

Quick and fabulous. I found dry scallops today, and fresh watercress. I always have hazelnuts in the freezer for biscotti and while I cook mostly with good olive oil, butter always makes a dish luscious. Made the recipe as indicated except used white wine to extend the sauce for use of a small amount of pasta (my husband's favorite food). The dish is both light and clean flavored.

I just made this dish last night and it was outstanding. My guests could not stop raving about it. I doubled it and followed it exactly - except that I also added 2 tablespoons of white wine and I put the watercress and scallops over brown rice. I'll definitely make it again, but this time I will probably use salted butter as it needed a little salt (in my opinon - guests thought it was perfect as is).

This dish was delicious and super fast. I used what I had on hand, bay scallops, pecans and baby spinach. I was also careful to decant the browned butter off of its browned bits which are bitter, before adding to vinegar. It took me about 7 minuates form start to finish. A perfect dish.

Fantastic!! I had to use pistachios and baby spinach but still a winner. Not to mention all came together in 15-20 minutes. Will definitely make this again and again!

I used roasted pistachios instead of the hazelnuts, and a splash of white wine instead of the balsamic. I tossed a small package of cooked linguine into the butter/nut sauce and served the scallops over the pasta. Added dimension to the butter/nut mixture. Will definitely make it again.

A bit disappointed with the dish. The recipe produced a lot more hazelnut topping than that shown in the picture. Okay - but not worth making again (especially with the cost of scallops).

I have been looking for a easy / solid scallop recipe and this is it. It was easy to prepare with little prep. I ended up using regular butter instead of unsalted. I will make this again ... what have people searved as sides?

So yummy! Made this for my boyfriend for a valentine's day dinner and it was perfect. We don't eat much butter so it was a sinful treat. Don't let the short ingredients list fool you...this dish has a lot of flavor, especially from the toasted hazelnuts.

Amazing... Just the smell almost drove my husband to distraction. I'd definitely make it again. I had no white balsamic vinegar so i substituted 1/2 champagne vinegar and 1/2 dark balsamic vinegar. It was very good. The smell of the vinegar when i added it to the hot pan almost overwhelmed me and i thought "oh no what have i done..." but it turned out delicious.

This is the first time I am cooking some very big and fresh scallops, and I picked this recipe because of its simplicity and all the rave reviews (with fresh seafood, you don't want to overpower them with too many ingredients). This recipe is a keeper, for being classic and original. I had to improvise with what was on hand, and hence used coarse almond meal instead of the hazelnuts, regular balsamic vinegar and dried thyme. The watercress went surprisingly well with the scallops, especially noticeable because I upsized the amount of the watercress and the shallot-and-nut topping , sliced the scallops into thick rounds for easier cooking, and scattered them on the watercress to have the dish more like a salad. One mistake I made though (and I hope no one else would), is that the browned bits from the butter coated the scallops and made me think the latter were more cooked than they really were. They were still good, of course.

Used cashews instead of hazelnuts and regular balsamic instead of white. It was delicious. My pregnant wife was in heaven (especially when I cleaned up too!)

Loved this. I forgot to buy hazelnuts, but it still tasted fantastic. My dinner guests agreed. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good and easy to make. I used regular balsamic vinegar not white. The white balsamic I saw at the store was basically white wine vinegar so I may try that next time.

This is very rich but oh so good! Like many others I used baby spinach in place of watercress. Will do that again soon.

This is one recipe I didn't tinker with. It's delicious as it stands and is as pretty to look at as it is to eat. Enjoy!!

Very nice. Used arugula instead (couldn't find watercress that day); arugula isn't the right thing, I think, would try baby spinach next time. Cutting back on the butter just a bit seems a good idea as well. But this is very easy to make, and tasty.

Best scallops recipe I've ever tried. I think I'll want to chop nuts a little finer next time. Delicious and very easy.

Yum, Yum, Yum! I made this with dark balsamic as well, and don't think I would want it to be "lighter". Spinach is better (in my opinion) than the watercress. I think it's the best scallops recipe I've ever tried - and easy! This is a company dish!

Of course I would make this again.

Incredibly easy, yet sumptuous. The hazelnut brown butter is decadent yet did not overpower the scallops. I plan to make this dish for company soon. I served it with a side of steamed green beans and with the avocado mango salad with passionfruit viniagrette for starters. Pair with a nice Washington Pinot Grigio and voila!--an over the top quick meal.

Fantastic!!! Prepared it as written, (except served it without the watercress) and was very delighted with the results. This would be incredible over a bed of fettucine alfredo, as well as fresh spinach, for a heartier fare.

This was delicious, fast, and required very few ingredients. I will definitely make it again! I substituted regular balsamic vinegar in place of white, and used a combination of arugula and mixed greens in place of watercress. The toasted hazelnuts added an especially nice flavor.

I thought this was excellent! Very easy to prepare and very tasty. I will definitely make it again. (I also used dark Balsamic vinegar)

Both my husband and I loved this recipe! The sweetness of the browned butter along with the salty/tangy taste of the scallops and balsamic vinegar (we subbed w/dark) makes a winning combination, especially w/ jumbo fresh scallops from Pike Place Market.

I salivate just thinking about how good this recipe is. I had a similar sauce on pumpkin ravioli once, so it works with pasta too. The butter/hazelnut/shallots combination is a winner; I like extra shallots.

Yes I will make this again in a very different way, let's get get real!White balsamic vinegar doesn't make it! Well at least it impresses someone as putting cheesewhizz on a cracker

Yes, white balsamic vinegar exists. It's sweeter than dark balsamic, but I've been able to find it fairly easily in supermarkets.

a really easy recipe to prepare, and an interesting combination of sweet and salty. the only change i made was using baby spinach instead of watercress.
