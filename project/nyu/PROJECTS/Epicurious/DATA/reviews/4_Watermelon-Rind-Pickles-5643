Made these because we had the watermelon rind from family visitors, and I used to have them in Minn. as a youth. Seem to taste the same, and were very easy to make. Liked them a lot, but sweet pickles are not an everyday item with us. Only one person, of the other six, among our card playing group had tasted or heard of these prior; she was from Iowa.

It is best to use a melon that is not fully ripe. A "green" melon has fibers that are closer together because they have not fully matured, which helps eliminate the problem of mushy pickles. A unripe melon sounds solid when you thump on it. Try talking to a farmer's market vendors!

Reminds me of my mother's pickles. But it is hard to find a thick-rind on watermelons in Oregon like she used in Texas. So I use a large zucchini peeled, deseeded, cut in chunks, covered in a pickling lime solution before proceeding with this recipe. Zucchini substitutes well, keeps it crispiness and preserves very well in pint jars for Christmas.

Changes I made to the recipe: used whole allspice and sliced fresh ginger, also added sliced lime, and found that I could triple the recipe with the rind from a large melon. Using the whole spices and white vinegar makes for a prettier product. I did have some syrup left over, which was delicious drizzled over the chilled fresh melon (the part you usually eat). While this was sweet, it was not quite as sweet as what I remember from my childhood.

these are good but, like a few other reviewers, i'd change it up a bit. really like the idea of salting (or liming) the watermelon so that they stay crisp and also adding some heat with serrano and/or jalapeño chiles.

I was a bit skeptical about the amount of sugar called for, but they turned out great. I also added about 12 Serrano and Jalapeno peppers to the mix to spice it up a bit which turned out great.

You can easily make 6 (instead of 4) cups of watermelon pickles with the liquid here. These are super sweet and pretty to look at.

Delicious and easy and something different. I am going to try and can a jar. Has anyone else tried this?

Have made this several times with store-bought and garden watermelon. A refreshing tangy dessert for hot summer. The little bit of pink left on is pretty.

I I have used this recipe three times this year. I live in the south and this is a great one and as easy as any. I lime the cubes the day before which makes the pickles very crisp. This adds a day, but is so worth it. These are great for Xmas gifts.

Living in the deep south where everypart of everthing is used to make big smiles I had lost this resipe. My sister is having a hard time in life and has asked a couple times please make me that watermelon "thing". I remember the recipe to be very close to this. Any one who has had theses before will smile . They are so good.

Definitely make a double batch - people love them (just don't tell them what they're made of before they try them)! Perfect picnic/barbecue fare!

I was not sure about these and only made a half-batch to try them out. Now I am sorry I didn't make more because they aren't going to last long! The three day process is the hardest part of this recipe but they are worth the wait. Yum!
