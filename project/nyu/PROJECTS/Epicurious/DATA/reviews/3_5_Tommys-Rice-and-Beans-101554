I LOVE simple delicious recipes and this one is wonderful. I used brown rice (made a cup of uncooked and just used it all) cooked with stock, added some garlic scapes I had hanging about as well. Will be adding all manner of seasonal veg as I make this again and again. Used rice vinegar as suggested by others and diced a red bell pepper instead of the roasted.

I love, love, love this recipe. I make it just as written, except for I also cook my rice in vegetable stock. Such a quick meal idea that's not boring!

This is a quick go-to recipe on any weeknight. Always have ingredients in the pantry. Like others, we have used both roasted red pepper and chopped fresh peppers. We have even added sliced italian sausage or kielbasa when wanted a meat dish. everyone always raves!

Awesome. Simple. Versatile. Kid and teen friendly.

Although I followed the measurements (mostly - I added extra cumin) I had to change this recipe to use what I had on hand. I didn't have roasted peppers so I used diced green bell pepper, I added jalapeno and red beans as well as black. No vinegar but chicken stock instead. I guess I'm not one for following instructions but it turned out great nonetheless.

I forgot the vinegar and it came great anyway. Used green bell pepper instead and for a nice color used Sazon Goya.

So good - used rice vinegar, sambal olek for the hot sauce, and fresh peppers.

Delicious. I didn't think this was too vinegary at all. I used brown rice, added two peppers that I roasted myself and cubed, panfried tofu. This was really filling! Going to use the leftovers in burritos tonight!

I love this recipe. I make it every couple of weeks for a weeknight quick and healthy meal. I love spicy food, so I add a hot pepper to the mixture.

While our fridge/freezer was broken, I needed a meal I could make with the basic ingredients on my shelf. Rice and beans it is! I was surprised at how flavorful this dish was. I made it two days in a row, once with black beans and then with red beans. Quite by accident, I forgot the vinegar--both times. It didn't need it and, quite frankly, I can't imagine adding it now. It is so easy and I almost always have the ingredients on hand. I will make it again and again.

I loved this dish, had a great kick, very simple to make and tasty. Served it with a grilled chicken breast w/mango salsa--delicious combo!

I thought this was just ok. I found it a bit too vinegary and there didn't end up being much moisture/sauce, so I added some queso blanco and a little olive oil.

The rice and beans has a nice flavor and kick to it and it's very easy to make.

I made a variation of this recipe - instead of vinegar I threw in a couple tablespoons of ground cumin (i'm a cumin lover). I used one red and one yellow bell pepper which I roasted over the flame of my gas stove. It came out fantastic, although next time I will either add another can of beans or only use one pepper to make the mix a bit more even. A very tasty and colorful dish!

i was a bit annoyed at my last bbq - i spent ages preparing all the other dishes and EVERYONE liked this dish best. i did make one change though - i didnt use vinegar and tried two tblsp ketchup in its place. so good, so simple.

I really liked this recipe - I made it to accompany a pork tenderloin with chimichura sauce and it worked beautifully. I used brown rice instead of white, and it turned out very well. Though I made this as a side dish, I would also make it as a vegetarian main course. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
Great vegetarian recipe. I used instant brown rice and jarred roast peppers. Quick and easy to make. I'll try kidney beans and other vinegars, also, but great as is. A keeper.

A great, easy basic recipe. Made it as the recipe states, and served it with Cuban-style picadillo (Bon Appetit March 05).

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!! I am going to make this one over and over. It is so fresh tasting, it really brightened up my pork tenderloin. My only changes were using red wine vinegar, possibly I added a bit more cilantro and I cooked the rice in chicken broth to add more moisture. I'm definately going to try this as a cold picnic dish this summer too.

Cheap, Easy, Healthy, Tasty. I really enjoy this dish, I have made it a few times. I follow the directions exactly, This dish seems to taste even better the next day... try eating in cold you might be surprised. Make sure you do not over cook the rice.

This recipe is exactly what I have been looking for. I made exactly as the recipe said and had the beans & rice with fresh grilled grouper and grilled vegetables. Delicious

I make this dish frequently. It's cheap and easy and taaasty. I use only two cups of rice instead of three. In contrast to the cook from Boston, however, I don't think it calls for too much vinegar.

Rating: 3
The first time I made it as printed, and it was great, and since then I've tinkered, and I still like it. I reduce the white vinegar a little, but not much, since I like the tang, add more cilantro. For rice-cooking tips, read the tester's notes, though I don't think it's the best way to cook rice.

I think 1/4 cup of vinegar is WAY too much for this dish- I would only do 2 tbsp of cider vinegar. I also add 1/2 tsp of cumin and oregano each. Finally, I would say that if you like cilantro, sprinkle it on top and it'll take your beans to the next level of YUM.

To Keiretsu: Um, the recipe calls for 3 cups of COOKED RICE.

There seems to be a missing ingredient.....The Liquid........ How much stock or H2O is required, especially for three cups of RICE to cook....

This has become a staple of my weekend repetoire. I tend to cook for the week since one dish will feed me all week. This is good as is, or stuffed into homemade tortillas and make enchiladas. I love the tang of the vinegar, use plenty of garlic and Louisiana Hot Sauce.

Easy and tasty. I would make this again. Great way to serve beans and rice when making Mexician food.

This was one of the best beans and rice dishes I've found. It seems weird not adding spices but it really doesn't need them. I used a 12 oz jar of roasted red peppers and 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and added black olives on top, served with corn and it was great. I tried a bite of my boyfriends pork chop with it and if you like meat it's a good combo. Next time I want to try it with sour cream and tomatoes.

Rating: 3
I also love beans and rice, but I think next time I will use all of the juice from the canned beans and a little more spice. I also took someone's advice and roasted my peppers first, it made a bit more tasty. I will definitely make it again though!

This is a very easy and tasty dish, considering I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of white vinegar I used apple cider vinegar, which isn't as tart. I used the jarred peppers and I had no parsley (not a fan of cilantro).Boil in the bag rice comes in handy for this dish. Next time I make it I'll use all the ingredients. Very good.

I love beans and rice and this recipe is just about the best basis for it. I love to throw in seasonal veggies and lots of spice. I do adjust the amount of vinegar and add more umph but that's just me. There is no better garnish than sour cream and jalapenos!!!!

This was great! Stunk up my apartment in a very nice way. I didn't find it dry at all. I doubled the recipe, and dumped all the juice from the canned black beans into the mix. I also used white wine vinegar. I am afraid to cook with regular "white" vinegar. Next time I will use basmati rice, a little less vinegar, and either roast my own peppers or use more from the jar (could not really taste them). This had a great mouthfeel and was perfect with an andouille sausage piperade. I will definitely make this again.

Very good dish. Because of other reviewers' comments about the strength of the vinegar, I used mild rice vinegar instead of white vinegar, and I did not find the flavor to be overpowering. I served with sour cream. Next time I'll add diced fresh tomatoes. For those who hate cilantro, try flat leaf parsley instead.

Nice and a good change of pace from spuds, corn etc. Next time I`ll use a bit less vinegar and maybe hit the spices a little harder. Excellent side dish for jerk chicken

This was so tasty and fast. I only had pinto beans, so I used those instead, and it was nearly as good as it would have been with black beans. And I had to omit the cilantro because my husband loathes it, and it was still really good. And healthful.

I really liked this recipe. It will be dry if you over cook the rice. Also I used white wine vinegar as called for in the recipe and didn't find the taste overpowering at all. Did use more hot sauce. We like things spicey. Would recommend as a side dish. Served with spicey pork chops.

This recipe was very easy to make. I didn't find the rice and beans dry at all, although I did use a large onion. I also used brown rice which gave this dish a great texture. My boyfriend really liked it and he is not a fan of vegetarian dishes. I will definitely make it again.

This was a quick and easy recipe. My 13 and 11 year old loved it. I added 3 T. of racaito (found in the Latino section of the grocery store) for flavoring. Gave it a little cilantro taste.

This is one of my current favorite recipes. I make it every week! I have made a couple of changes, however, such as omitting the white vinegar and substituting a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar. Also, I use about 3/4 of a 7oz. jar of roasted red bell peppers, rather than roast my own. I serve it over rice, not mixed with it. You have to try this! Delicious, easy, healthful comfort food--yum!!

I make this dish periodically as a side dish to accompany grilled porkchops. My finicky husband even likes it. I spice mine up with extra tabasco sauce. It makes a great vegetarian main dish also.

Making this was a big mistake. All I tasted was vinegar and cilantro. It had no other taste, I had two spoon fulls and that was it. It now rests in a ziploc in the garbage. (Still looking for a good beans and rice recipe).

I, too, added some tomatoes and I used some parsley instead of cilantro. I didn't think something so simple would be so good! My two year old daughter just loved it.

I was SO disappointed with this recipe. I read the other reviews and it SOUNDED good. This was a waste of my time. There was an excess of vinegar which overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. It was extremely dry and heavy.

We loved this recipe! Very, very easy to prepare (even with roasting the red peppers myself) and delicious. I doubled the recipe knowing we would love it leftover for lunch the next day, which we did! I added extra garlic and a couple of chopped roma tomatoes which was good. We all thought the tanginess of the vinegar was fantastic! Instead of white rice I made a side dish of Spanish rice with green olives which worked well together. This is definitely a dish I will make again!
