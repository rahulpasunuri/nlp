This recipe was terrific! Using a whole brisket made a world of difference. Smoking brisket is not an exact science so I allocated the full 8 hours to cook two (2) six pound briskets. I was also prepared to take the brisket out after 6 hours and keep the briskets warm by wrapping in foil and towels and then putting in an insulated warmer/cooler box. My friend from Texas said that he never had brisket this good or tender when he lived in Texas. I used a Vidalia grill for the smoking and the briskets reached an internal temperature of 198 degrees before resting.

This was fabulous. We made it with 2 smaller pieces and it was so, so good. I'll definitely make it again. I also made both BBQ sauces which we forgot to use because it was so tasty as it was.

This is a excellent. I am not rating 4 forks because the cooking time is off by a couple of hours. I had to finish it off in the oven the next day. We tasted it the first day but it was not really done. Glad I didn't have company!

Prepared this for a New Year's Eve dinner with friends. Not sure what they thought of it but I thought it was exceptional! Followed the recipe exactly - no additions or substitutions. Will definitely make it again.

This guy does appear to be on top of all things bar-b-que, even Texas BBQ. However, ixnay the hickory chips on anything in Texas BBQ. We simply don't do hickory in Texas. And the same goes for liquid smoke (whatever that is)!

I am so happy to have these recipes. I was in Tennesse May 09, missed the World Championship BBQ (I didn't know it was going on! Sadly, I just learned of it..but will be there next year and am on their email list NOW), in liu of Track & Field, Mid Ten State..Thanks for that info too. I had beef BBQ Brisket (Bennetts & ?), and loved both, in Saveignnn.(booze allowed).. outside of Pigeon Forge (did not want to stay where no booze allowed) Great pizza buffet there & Golden Corral (same owner). ? what is best BBQ joint in Texas--I do not see there. Also, like the Christmas Western theme; I am not creative like that..but maybe I should be.

We are scaling back Christmas dinner this year and ended up with a "Spaghetti Western" theme. My 79-year old mom is making lasagna, and I'm smoking the brisket right now, a day after yet another snowstorm last night and luckily, the weather is warmer - about 40 degrees with a misty rain - and the smoker is protected from the wind. The neighborhood smells like a Texas Roadhouse! If the drippings are any indication of how this is going to turn out, this is going to be one mighty fine piece of meat. There's a bit of bite from the pepper, and just a nice, deep smoky barbecue flavor from the chili powder and cumin. Our family doesn't do beef BBQ - we're more of the pulled pork type - so we are really looking forward to the results. Since I originally bought the brisket intending to make jerky, it is a 3 lb. piece, rather than the larger cut recommended. I wrapped this in bacon slices and am basting it ever 45 minutes or so. I'm confident that when cut across the bias and sitting in its own juices overnight, it will be plenty succulent for Christmas Dinner tomorrow. I made the recommended vinegar sauce, and strained it the next day to remove the pepper flakes, as I didn't want it too hot. The only suggestion I have is to use half white vinegar and half cider vinegar to control the apple flavor somewhat. We generally get a similar sauce from a North Carolina company, but the last order didn't go through, so I was real happy to find this recipe.

I used a propane smoker instead of a grill. Used mesquite chips and slow cooked for 7 hours. My wife raved over it. Best brisket since I lived in San Antonio.
