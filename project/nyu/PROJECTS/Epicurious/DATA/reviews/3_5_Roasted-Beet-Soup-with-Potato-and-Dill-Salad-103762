I love beets and I love Yukon Golds, but I didn't care for this soup at all. All I could taste was dill. Too overpowering.

Surprisingly good, very fresh and cleansing. Beet soup is good on it's own too.

Exceptional color! A substantial soup with dill flavor especially prevalent in the potato salad. Next time I will add some horseradish to the soup mixture to zip it up (have another borscht recipe that includes this). Peruvian white potatos have more starch and are a delicious local ingredient.
