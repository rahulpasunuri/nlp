Also reduced sugar by 1/2 and added vanilla. Will try orange extract next time. Mix some with plain yogurt to make your own strawberry yogurt!

Very easy and quick to make. I used 2 T. sugar and found that to be sufficient. Served it over cheesecake ... delicious!

I found this to be too sweet. No one complained, but I will cut the sugar in half next time. 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract was a nice addition.

This sauce was so easy to make and it was delicious. I it for a Couples valentines dinner i had to compliament individual chocolate molten cakes. I did however cut the sugar down to almost half and it was still awesome!!

A simple but great sauce. Use on pancakes, over ice cream, etc.

I served this along side my Passover sponge cake and it was a big hit. So easy to make and especially because it could be made ahead of time. It will be terrific on ice cream too!

This is wonderful on a slice of strawberry cake (see the recipe for "Triple Decker Strawberry Cake" in "Gail's Recipe Swap" - click on the "Forums" link at the top of the Epicurious home page). Also great on a slice of key lime cheesecake. Very easy to make.

This was the perfect foil to a combination of chocolate pate w/fresh whipped cream! Don't overcook it.
