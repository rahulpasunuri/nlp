Recommended. I went easy on the olive oil (1/2 cup only) and cut the number of shallots down to 12. I also sprinkled some brown sugar on the shallots before caramelizing them at 350 F for 35 min. Yummy!

I've made this for dinner a few times and really enjoy the flavors. I've substituted caramelized sliced red onion (done in a skillet) for the shallots, which worked well is is a time saver. I've also substituted feta for goat cheese, which is nice.

This was an amazing salad. Per the original author's notes, I used balsamic vinegar and upped the meat to 2.5 lbs. I also grilled the meat over charcoal vs. broiling.

This is a staple in our house, especially for nights when we need to eat and run to little league or cub scouts, because it is simple and delicious. It is perfect just the way it is. My husband is not a fan of balsamic vinegar so we appreciate the use of red wine vinegar instead. I have made it countless times and it never disappoints!

This is an excellent recipe for steak salad. I substituted balsamic vinegar and halved the oil, but will just double the amount of vinegar next time, as there was not enough dressing. I also only used 4 (large shallots) and we had more than enough left over.

This was a great entertaining recipe. Before my guests arrived, I did everything but cook the meat. I added brown sugar to help the shallots caramelize, and added grape tomatoes to the salad as well. Also, i let the steak marinate overnight and it was juicy and flavorful. I rounded out the meal with some roasted asparagus and a loaf of crusty bread. It was delicious.

This recipe is on the all-time favorite hits list of family and friends. It has become the Memorial Day staple. I make no adjustments (for fear of getting drawn and quartered). The dish is very rich so I keep side dishes to roasted asparagus and a hearty Portuguese bread - for mopping. Don't change a thing and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!

So easy and so fantastic! I used balsamic vinegar and dried thyme leaves, and this is one of my favorite main dish salads. The shallots and goat cheese together are fantastic.

We followed the recommendation of the recipe creater and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. We also halved the total amount of dressing and had plenty for this dish. The steak was very tender and the combination of sweet shallots and greens was delish. This would be great for company served with crusty bread.

Very good salad, and simple to make. The only substitution that I made was basalmic instead of red wine, and I reduced the amount of oil. I added grade tomatoes and they were fine but didn't add much other than color, in my opinion.

I decided to check the reviews on my recipe and wanted to let you know that the magazines change your original recipes to their liking. I guess I could understand the staff in the kitchen needing to make changes to suite their personal taste but this recipe was sent in with balsamic vinegar and 2 1/2-3 lbs of flank steak that were grilled not broiled! That explains the large quantily of olive oil it was meant for more meat and salad. I usually make this recipe for a larger group. Thanks for all of the positive comments!

I thought the dressing was very flavorful and I only marinated for 20 min at room temp. I also roasted fingerling potatoes with the shallots and added them to the salad in addition to grape tomatoes-this made quite a substantial meal. We used feta vs goat cheese and enjoyed the combination. Lots of options with this recipe, but the starting point is excellent.

Delicious with the following alterations: reduced the oil by half, added sea salt and black pepper to the marinade; salted the steak fairly heavily with kosher salt just before barbecuing (not broiling). The shallots, with the brown sugar suggested by a previous poster, were excellent. Even my picky 9 year old thought they smelled wonderful, but was disappointed that I was not actually pouring caramel over them to make them palatable. Salad with arugula tastes best with this.

I roasted some potatoes along with the shallots in the oven, and grilled the steak in my fireplace (!) - only used about one third of the marinade. I skipped the whole salad business. It was delicious.

I made this for my family and they loved it! I did not change anything.

Awful. I wouldn't even rate this a one fork recipe. There are plenty of better recipes and you needn't waste your time with this one. If you are tempted by the other reviews to make the steak do not [exclamation] broil it - grill it instead.

I guess I don't get the all the excitement. The shallots were wonderful but otherwise it was a good salad but not a "dish beyond compare". The previous reviews are correct. Too much oil. It's easy, pretty, but my socks weren't knocked off.

This is fantastic, one of our favorites. I would advise against omitting the shallots, substituting for the goat cheese, etc. Each ingredient adds something special to this dish.

A great summer dish- all you need for a complete meal is some good bread and a nice bottle of wine.

Really delicious salad! I used some leftover steak from the previous day but I did pour some of the dressing over it to let it soak into the meat to give it the extra flavour. As suggested by others, I added grape tomatoes, substituted balsamic vinegar and cut down on the oil (way too much oil). I cooked the shallots on a little lower temp for a longer than indicated. They were soft and carmelized and I did sprinkle some brown sugar on them. They were definately the best part of the salad. The last thing that made it great was using roasted garlic chevre cheese.

i absolutely loved this recipe. however, i made it with filet mignon which i marinated then grilled on the bbq ... mmmmm! everybody raves about the salad and asks me to make it again!

I made this last week, and it offered an encouraging reminder of summer in the dead of winter. I used my grill pan, which gives me much better results than by broiler. Be careful roasting the shallots, though! The temperature called for in the recipe was way too high, and the shallots began to burn shortly after they went into the oven. I reduced the heat to 350, which worked fine. I made the dressing with red wine vinegar as directed, and it was great. We could have used a little more of it, though.

So easy and so tasty. For an extra bite I threw in fresh, sliced jalapenos. Yum. And I agree with other reviewers, balsamic is better than the red wine vinegar.

Excellent! Only had 4 shallots and regretted it (my husband and I fought over them). Made it again 2 weeks later with balsamic vinegar - much better (and made sure I had enugh shallots).

THIS IS AMAZING. Make it now! You'll be so glad you did.

The only thing I would change is the dressing. It was BORING! Maybe a balsamic vinaigrette. The Shallots are a must and add such a great flavor.

LOVED this recipe! Added toasted pine nuts and avocado, both of which really added good flavor to it. We also substituted feta cheese for the goat cheese, which worked very well. Will definitely make it again...

Goat cheese and shallots - Yum! I modified the marinade using lemon and lime juice along with a little vinegar, added cilantro (no thyme), and some ancho chili powder. I also used tri-tip steaks. It was delicious!!!!

I made this dish last night and added the brown sugar to the shallots; great idea. The shallots are a critical component to this dish. I thought the marinade was a bit bland and increased the garlic. I also added grape tomatoes. It was a hit and I would make this again. I may try blue cheese next time.

Gorgeous darling, absoultely gorgeous. Loved the shallots. Added brown sugar like that other lovely suggested. Put grape tomatoes in my salad for that little something extra. Even better when you're high (on life, that is). Will make it one thousand times more!

We cooked the shallots and steak on the grill, because it was 100 degrees here, and it was delicious! A perfect meal for a hot summer night. I stuffed the little bit of leftover into a pita the next day for a little treat. I had too much dressing, so next time will modify to use less oil.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! One minor addition, I added a light dusting of brown sugar to my shallots. I will definately make this again

This salad was very good. I followed the advice of the person not to use all the oil, but there was not enough dressing to drizzle on the meat. If you are in a hurry, you could skip the shallots. The salad and steak are great anyway.

I really enjoyed this dish it was simple and the flavors were wonderful together. The one thing I did that I would advise against is adding to much fetta cheese.

This was really good and easy. I used red onions instead of shallots and balsalmic vinegar instead of red wine and it tasted great. Toasted pine nuts would be a great addition.

This dish is incredibly easy to prepare, and VERY delicous to eat. I used a little less oil and added lots of cracked black pepper to the marinade. There will be many repeat appearances of this at my Sunday lunches.

I loved this recipe!!! It was quick and easy for a weeknight, the best part was the wonderful flavors between the dressing, shallots and goat cheese. Loved it!Loved it!
