Good, basic soup. I used the ham bone to make stock (which I used instead of the beef stock) and then chopped up the leftover ham meat for the soup. I used celeriac instead of celery and omitted the cinnamon stick and mushrooms. I also added a whole dried chili (removed with the bay leaf), which added some nice heat.

This soup was a bit on the bland side for my taste, but with adding herbs and spices I found it more to my families liking. I did kick up some heat with red pepper flakes, and then added thyme, parsley, & garlic. The soup is good...but needed some help.

Followed the other reviewers tips (added thyme, white wine and sweated the vegetables.) Also I ran out of carrots so I added apples (which I had in abundance) instead. Soup was delicious! Even my picky teen daughter loved it.

This was incredibly easy and incredibly delicious. I followed some of the suggestions from the previous reviews. Sweated the vegetables, added white wine and thyme, and pureed the soup with an immersion blender. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon since the store was out of cinnamon sticks. I will be making this every time I have a ham bone at hand!

I made the Balsamic- and Dijon-Glazed Ham with Roasted Pearl Onions for Easter and used the leftover ham bone to make this absolutely delicious soup! I sauteed the onions, celery, mushrooms and carrots until just getting soft, threw in about 1/2 cup of dry white wine and let it cook off and then added the ham, lentils, vegetable broth (no beef broth on hand) and 6 cups water along with 1/4 T. cinnamon and 2 teaspoons dried thyme. I also refrigerated the pan drippings from the ham overnight, skimmed off the fat and added the ham drippings to the soup. Very rich and flavorful. Definitely add the cinnamon!

I love this soup! It is extremely easy to whip up and so yummy! I was hesitant about the cinnamon stick. I did a taste test ten minutes in & removed the stick but it added a beautiful flavour. BEST lentil and ham soup I've ever had! Definitely a pleaser!

Outstanding...ok, it's lentil soup, but it's the best lentil soup I have ever had! I sauteed the veggies first with a clove of garlic, but just had the pot hot and tossed them in as I chopped, so super easy and not time consuming. Used 6 cups of water as recommended by others, and did spash in some cider vinegar and Tabasco at the end. Otherwise followed recipe and my highly skeptical husband loved it too. Perfect.

Needed a recipe for leftover spiral ham. Started this 1 night earlier and served it tonight. I added a mix of dried mushrooms along with fresh mushrooms. My husband and kids loved it! Very tasty. Has a sweetness to the flavor from the cinnamon, but not overly sweet. So good I would buy a ham just to make it and not just wait for leftovers next time.

Rating: 3
This turned out to be a good basic recipe for lentil soup. I didn't have celery or mushrooms, and had to substitute homemade chicken stock for the beef stock, but the combination of cinnamon and bay leaf was wonderful with the smoked ham. Like most cooks here, I built the soup slowly from the ground up, making sure to give each ingredient its due in order to create the most flavorful soup possible. By all means, one should carmelize the onions with the ham hock, and sweat the veggies for sure... I also added the tiniest bit of minced garlic, which enhanced the flavor without changing the character too much, and sliced in a pork sausage that was leftover from breakfast. At the end, I added a little salt and pepper to taste, and it was perfect. I usually end up freezing some of the soup I make, but we ended up eating the entire pot of this in two days.

Excellent soup. I am not usually a big fan of ham soups. However, this one is a keeper. Something I would look forward to. I did lightly brown the onions/sweat the vegetables. Other than that I followed the recipe. I think I will try some of the variations suggested by other reviewers next time. A bit of garlic, chicken or veg stock.

I didn't have a ham bone, so I used two smoked pork chops instead. They didn't have the hearty flavor of ham - my bad. I did begin by sauteing all the veges and then added 5 chopped cloves of garlic. Also tied a bunch of thyme and some sage together from my garden, and add them to the saute. Next time will add a couple cayenne peppers.

I used a leftover ham bone, some leftover cooked pork shoulder. I soaked porcini mushrooms in boiling water for 1/2 hr-rinsed strained and put 2 cups of porcini liquid with the muhrooms in the pot, chicken stock and water.

Super easy! I used the leftover ham bone from Easter dinner to make this. I didn't put in the bay leaf because my bf doesn't like the flavor, but I substituted with some ground savory.. and added in thyme and fresh ground pepper. The cinnamon adds a lovely flavor to it that's unexpected, but delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Just starting to make this, and I haven't read all of the reviews, but I debated whether or not to remove the gills on the portabello mushroom I was using. I wish had, because the gills are turning my soup an unappetizing gray color. (I know you have to remove the gills so as to prevent that from happening in cream sauces; I just didn't know it was necessary for soups.) A well-written recipe should mention this. I like lots of flavors, but I don't think I want a huge pot of cinnamon-flavored lentil soup.

I've made this soup every year for the last 5 years after Christmas when we have a leftover ham bone. Excellent. We like more carrots so I use several. I like to saute the onions, carrots, celery a little to soften. Everything else I keep the same and it's reliable, healthy and so, so tasty. Highly recommend.

This soup needs the aromatics sauteed before adding liquid. Used low sodium chicken broth, and it was rich and absolutely delicious. Had no lentils so used yellow split peas, added 3 smashed garlic cloves. Had 1 ham hock & lots of leftover ham, no bone, so chopped ham up and tossed it in. Will make this again and again. Cinnamon stick added a rich flavor to the stock. Don't leave it out!

I was afraid this recipe was going to be too good to be true, but husband and I both loved this soup.

Finally, a way to use up the ham bone. I too followed the "executive summary." I left out the mushrooms and forgot to rinse the lentils which is the only changes I made to that person's review. The soup came out great. I pulled out the ham bone after about 45 min and shredded what little meat was left and added it back to the soup pot, it was so tender that it was shred-able with a fork. I at the very end, I took out around 2 cups and pureed it in the food processor but it was still pretty thick even without that step. Then, I added some diced ham that I saved from some of the sliced ham that came off. The cinnamon was a nice touch though a bit on the sweet side for a savory soup. Definitely needs the vinegar and hot sauce. And I forgot to add the kale.

This was delicious! I actually used chopped leftover baked ham instead of the ham bone- I've found that I really don't enjoy all the bits and pieces that come off the ham bone. (Though I do get that this kind of thing has its roots in using up those last bits of fat and flavor.) I also sped thing up by microwaving the lentils, chopped ham and a mix of chicken broth and water for 10 minutes while I chopped and sauteed the veggies. It got the lentils going a lot quicker, and the soup was ready after about 45 minutes of cooking (once assembled) instead of an hour and a half. I also added extra cinnaman, thyme, and some nutmeg, salt and pepper. A little tabasco added on top upon serving was great!

After making this, I was convinced that I did something wrong because I felt the soup lacked any great flavor or oomph. I looked over the recipe and confirmed that I did everything to the tee. I did like to subtle hint of cinnamon, but that was the only distinctive part of this recipe. My mother has made a great, very simple, lentil and ham soup for years that takes her all of 15 minutes, and this didn't even compare. I had to add a lot at the end to make it even slightly desirable.

This is outstanding. Used smoked boneless pork chops in lieu of ham hock. Slightly pureed with immersion blender and used dried sage (1t), homemade chicken stock (just boiled carcass....no other additions - keep it in my freezer). Cinnamon stick makes this amazing....don't leave it out!

Another Chrismas, Another Ham Bone, Another recipe search...No more. THIS IS THE ONE,with improvements. Below is the EXECUTIVE Summary based on ALL the past reviews and a few tips of my own. 1) Liquids- Simmer ham bone in the 8 c of water while chopping the vegetables and use one 32 oz box low sodium chicken broth TIP-use two pots; one for hame bone & water and one for veg. and for soup to cook in (8 qt)(2) Use French GREEN lentils 3) Add 5 cloves sliced garlic, salt, pepper and fresh or dried thyme 4) Saute veg. and garlic first 5) Add steamed chopped greens (kale, collards, etc) at end 7) Puree 15-30 seconds w/stick blender when finished 6) Add vinegar and hot sauce once in bowl. Enjoy!

GREAT recipe and super easy to make. i added lots of garlic (per other comments) and some red pepper flake and adobo for a bit of kick. in addition, i added some sweet wild rice, which sort of turned the soup a little purple (doh!) but thickened it up quite nice. instead of a bay leaf, i added fresh rosemary and some thyme and tarragon. overall, delicious!!!

I incorporated many of the recommendations of others including lots of chopped garlic, substituting chix broth instead of beef,using an imersion blender to puree it, the addition of lots of cilantro, and sour cream as a garnish when presenting the plate (I also added some chopped scallions-they added more flavor and a little crunch). The other liberties that I took included uping the amount of tabassco (2+ tbsps.) and cider vinegar (maybe 1/4 cup) that others recommended. Keep your eye on the salt by frequently tasting the soup along the way. We used remnants of a spiral ham leftover from Xmas that we froze and it turned out to be a tasty, hearty soup perfect for a cold winters night.

After it cooked for an hour I added 2 T apple cider vinegar, a few shakes hot sauce and a pinch of cayenne. Let it finish cooking, pureed a few cups and ended up with a delicious soup. Fresh cilantro is a good topping if you like the flavor.

This soup tasted and smelled great. Appreciated the cinnamon flavor, although I read the reviews and threw in the tiniest cinnamon stick I had. Only change I made was due to concern that my hambone wouldn't cook in the time it took the lentils, so I made a stock with the hambone first, pulled the meat off the bone and then followed recipe except using the stock I created. Oh and also added garlic.

My husband and I are doing the low carb thing, so I sacrificed the carrott and used the rest of the recipe as is.

Watch the cinnamon stick! Mine was either too fresh or too big, maybe both. Wow, way too much of a good thing. I like the idea and will try it with the cinnamon again, but carefully.

This soup was very good! I made a few changes, because I was on phase 1 of the South Beach Diet, and it was still so good.

Loved this recipe. I never know what to do with a ham bone because I hate pea soup. Now, I'll make this soup every time. I did add extra carrots and celery and onion and pureed a portion of it at the end. But I was tasting as I was going and it would have been delicious even if I didn't puree it. The cinnamon is a key ingredient. I sent my father who loves Italian style lentil soup home with some and he called to tell me how fabulous it as soon as he was done eating. Make this soup for a delicous weeknight dinner and serve with crusty bread and a salad. You won't be sorry.

This soup is excellent and easy to make. At the advice of other reviewers I added parsley, thyme and three very large garlic cloves. I added sliced ham, since I did not want the extra fat from the ham hock. I did use all of the water & vegetable stock - I think it depends on the type of pot you are making it in. Mine is a thick dutch oven.

I was in a hurry and made this soup with extra cubed ham that I picked up at the store. I didn't use the ham bone, too much fat. I really like it and I'm not a soup person. My husband loves it too.

If it were thick it would be stew.

What a disappointment. All I was looking for was a simple soup to use up the ham and lentils that I had. I would have been content with some hearty, simply peasant food. The soup was watery and bland. The ingredients just floated in the water and stock combination and did not coalesce or blend together in any way. Just little bits of boiled food floating together in the bowl. The cinnamon was a very good idea for spicing and I may use it if I ever try to make a lentil soup again. How could people think this was a good soup? How can you ruin soup? Unfortunately I wasted a great deal of very high quality fresh ingredients on this disaster. I wish I had a dog to feed it to. I will have to throw it out when my husband isn't looking.

Wow - what a great soup! Used 1 large sweet onion + 2 cloves of garlic. Sauteed the vegies first then added 2 cans of beef broth, 1 cup red wine and about 3 cups of water. A good, meaty ham bone is signifigant. However, it's the cinnamon and bay leaves that make this soup extraordinary.

I took a chance making this soup, because prior to now, I have never liked lentils. However, I went searching for a soup that could make use of a ham hock I had available, and the other reviews convinced me to try this. To those reviewers, thank you! This soup is wonderful! I'm still stunned that a soup this good took so little work. I made it without the mushrooms and only one onion; I added extra ham along with hot pepper sauce, red pepper flakes, and fresh pepper for some heat. I'll echo the comments others made about the cinnamon stick, which made a major contribution this recepe.

This soup is much better than the Lentil Soup (on this site) from Gourmet Dec. 1992, which I reviewed and rated 2 forks. My broth was made from the very meaty shank bone of an 8 lb. Smithfield ham and scraps from the same, after baking the ham for Easter dinner. Within 15 minutes of simmering, the broth was so delicious on its own that no beef broth was required. My small changes were: 2 chopped garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves instead of one, parsley and marjoram sprigs tied together, and black pepper near the end. My measurements for the vegetables were approximate. I wonder why the author said 3 onions (which vary greatly in size), but was careful to give exact measurements for the other vegetables. I used one large onion. I feel sorry for the folks who opted to omit the cinnamon stick (mine was about 2 1/2 inches long) which I think added greatly to the finished product. I'm still tempted to give this recipe 4 forks and actually could do that with my changes to it. Sounds like bragging, I know, but....great soup!

This was a huge hit with my husband (very picky too). I changed things some as others have too. I had a whole ham bone and some left over ham so I made a stock from the bone (covered it with water and simmered it for 2 1/2 hours). I let the stock chill over night and skimmed off the fat. Instead of using water or beef broth I just used my stock but used the quantities the original recipe called for. Like other reviewers, I left out the cinnamon (only b/c I did not have one and my husband does not like it) and added twice the amount of onion, carrots, and mushrooms. I also added left over ham cut into bit size chuncks and russet potatoes cut into bit size chunks. It is a very hearty soup and one that is a main dish. Serve with warm bread and/or a salad and call it a GREAT meal!! Enjoy!!

This soup ROCKS, (with the following changes): Used all the called for ingredients, but doubled the onion and mushrooms, added 5 large cloves of garlic, and changed the beef broth to chicken broth. I simmered my very meaty ham bone for a couple of hours, pulled the meat out and shredded it, let the stock cool, and skimmed the fat layer off the top. Sauteed all the veg (mushrooms sliced, not chopped) until just past translucent, and put it all in the stockpot together, substituting the ham stock for the water. My ham was pretty salty and I still had to season generously with s&p. Also added a few dashes of tabasco and a little cider vinegar right at the end, b/c my mom always did to hers. This soup is reminiscent of middle eastern lentil dishes, because of the perfuming of cinnamon. Don't omit the cinnamon because it's really great, but if you're wary pull it out earlier than called for.

after reading the reviews I decided to try this recipe myself. I deducted the carrots to 1/2 c. because they are sweet anyway. I used left over ham so omited the cinnamon because my ham was also sweet. Turned out just great, deffenatly one that will be used often.

I used leftover "brown sugar and honey ham" from XMAS (didn't have a ham bone or hocks). Slightly increased the carrots and celery. Added some diced potato and 1 tsp. minced garlic, decreased the water by 25%, as reviewers had suggested. Cooked it in my slow-cooker; it took about 3 hrs. It turned out more like stew than soup!!! Next time I would use the required amount of water, and add the mushrooms very late in the cooking time (mine disintegrated). My complaint with this recipe is that it was very bland and sweet (even though I removed the cinnamon quite early). Then I wound up adding about 3 more tsp. of garlic, heavy sprinkle of salt, and about 3/4 tsp. of black pepper. What saved this soup in the end was sprinkling each bowl with Kraft Shredded Three Cheese topping!!! What I served was EXCELLENT, but I was disappointed with this recipe as it is written. Maybe my type of ham was all wrong...

I love lentil soup, and this was a delightful change from the more ordinary one that I usually make. There are two big changes that will make when preparing this soup in the future. I'll sautee the onions (and may cut back to 1 or 2), and I'll cut way back on the amount of liquid used. The onions were still crunchy when the soup was done cooking, and their flavor was too strong. As others suggested, I cut the water back to 6 cups, and the soup was still way too wet. Even after using an immersion blender to mash up some of the cooked lentils, the soup was too watery. This recipe is a good starting-off point (the use of cinnamon is wonderful), but it's not the best way to make this particular soup.

In wanting to put more fiber in our diet and as I like ham hocks, I decided that we would try a lentil soup. A simple change I made was pre-cooking the hocks until they fell off the bone. I saved the cooking liquid of which I skimmed off the cooled fat. That left me with about 2 cups of a tasty, yet salty brine to use for flavor. And suprisingly the meat was still salty enough to take another 1 1/2 hours of cooking. I followed that basic recipe, (plus more carrots and celery) but being I am alergic to mushrooms, (swells up my osaphgus.)I omitted them. Yes, the cinnamon does it! There is a special flavor that just seems to belong. I will remember it for pea soup also. I fed it to my husband, who doesn't like lentil. The best I could get out of him was a "non-comitted" ok. It's basic, you like it or you don't. Tasty, but, yeah, it's a "toot" soup. It was worth it though!

An easy and very, very tasty main course! I had Cannellini beans in the pantry and substituted those for the lentils. The cinnamon stick makes all the difference: don't omit it. My wife, the gourmet chef, asked for seconds. Need I say more?

I really don't understand some of these recipe modifications. Omit the cinnamon? The cinnamon is what makes this different! The cook from Boulder should just stop wasting time on rating recipes that have no similarity whatsoever to the one on the site and just write a cookbook. I know there's a time and place for revisions, but part of the joy of cooking is trying things that may not sound that appealing or may not make a lot of sense. Anyway, I used less water as suggested here, and that's one change I will endorse. A note on the saltiness/lack thereof that some people have pointed out: saltiness will be largely dependent on the type of ham bone as well as how much meat is left on it. The original ham I used was quite salty and had a good amount of meat left on it. Some others' may not. This is not a flaw, just a variant that can easily be dealt with by adding salt later.

Very easy and good. I added a shot of sherry at the end and a couple of tablespoons of butter which seemed to round it out. Also a couple of croutons on top when serving.

It's so simple it's a sin...and it tastes great. I used what was left of a honey-baked ham which gave it a hint of sweetness. Do not omit the cinammon as it elevates the soup beyond ordinary.

Easy and delicious! Great on a winter day. We left out the mushrooms. Use "better than bouillon" if you don't have good stock to use - it's better than the powder or canned broth at least.

My EXTREMELY picky 11 year-old son ate four bowls of this soup the first time he tried it! Everyone in the family loved it!! And super easy for a lazy cook like me. Will definitely make this again whenever I have leftover ham.

The three fork rating comes from the following modifications: I sauted 2 chopped leeks, 1 minced clove of garlic, and two chopped onions in 2TB butter using salt & pepper to taste, then added the mixture to the kettle with about 1.5 lbs ham hocks, 1 lb lentils, 1 bay leaf, about 4 cups of chicken broth (instead of beef broth), 5 cups of water, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp salt. I did not use any mushrooms, carrots, celery, or cinnamon stick and eliminated one onion. I simmered everything for about an hour & 15 min (or until lentils were soft), then I took out the ham hocks and cooled them on a plate. I also took out four cups of soup and set aside to cool slightly. After the ham hocks were cool enough to touch, I separated the meat from the bone, chopped up the large pieces, and added the meat back to the soup. I pureed the four cups of soup in my blender and added it back to the soup. I removed & discarded the bay leaf. The final result is delicious, and it re-heats very well.

Though this soup was hearty, it was not flavorful. Usually the flavor intensifies when eaten the second day. This did not. We had to add loads of salt.

Following the reviews of others, I cut down on the water (6 cups as opposed to 8)and used frozen leftover Christmas ham (about 1/2 pound). Came out great and fully intend to always make a big batch after the holidays.

I made this soup using left-over ham from Christmas. I have 2 picky eating children but they loved this soup. I left out the celery and the cinnamon stick and it was delicious! This will be a soup recipe that I use again and again!

As suggested by another reviewer, I made this soup with split peas and chicken broth instead of lentils and beef broth. I also added a tablespoon of curry paste and 4 cloves of garlic for extra flavour, and some extra leftover ham. Truly an easy soup to make and very flavourful. Enjoy!

8 cups of water is too much. If I made it again I would only use about 6 unless you really like runny lentils. Also even with the cinnamon and the ham, it's still a bit bland. I had to add a fair amount of salt and pepper to liven it up. Overall it was a good soup and very easy to make.

I typically think of lentil soup and being rather bland, but I made this one because of the great reviews. It was as good as the other reviewers claimed it was and quite easy to make too. I added some diced turkey bacon and extra carrots and mushrooms. My husband loved it too.

This is one of the easiest and best soup recipes I have ever found. If you like it with lentils (3 forks), you've got to try it with green split peas (4+ forks), just omit the cinnamon. Simply Devine!

This was really good and easy to make, even my mother in law who doesnt like anything "too unusual" asked to keep some leftovers!

Wow! My husband and I just expected it to be another boring bean soup. We absolutely loved it! What a surprise. I used leftover honey ham from Christmas and I think it really contributed to the wonderful taste.

Exceptionally good winter comfort food! I soaked the beans for 10 hours, and then cooked the soup in a pressure cooker for 35 minutes and allowed the pressure to naturally release. Very very good. Added freshly ground pepper.

This soup is definately one of the best soups I've ever made (or tasted)! And it was really easy to make. Great way to use the last of the holiday ham. I highly recommend it for those who like lentils.

I have to add my accolades. This soup is wonderful. Even my husband who generally doesn't like lentils ate bowl after bowl. Go for it & don't forget the cinnamon stick!

My family would not have tried a lentil soup had this not smelled so good and tasted so great. They all took seconds. Very simple. My 13 yr. old son remarked on how many different good dishes can be made with ham.
