I use this as a marinade then grill the lamb and it is delcious. I think leg of lamb is better than the shoulder cuts. My butcher at Whole foods will cube it for you at no charge. It's very good for Kabobs, serve with couscous and some grilled vegtables.

This was good but that's about it. I made it as written and served drained yogurt on the side. I think the yogurt made it more palatable for me. My husband liked it more than I did.

This recipe is as beautiful as the photo. The marinade is a critical party and the lamb turned out delicious and very tender. Not sure I loved dealing with the bones, cutting the meat off the bones, and cooking of the bones. I'd get boneless next time. Also would be good with basmati or brown rice.

A wonderful recipe that can have many variations. I will probably cut down slightly on the cinnamom and cumin but next time add in either raisins or apricots. I served it as the entree in a 6 course dinner and everyone scraped their plates clean. For the CousCous, I used Casbah - Giant Pasta Pearls - the best I have ever had.

I used this lamb recipe as part of a dish called Fatteh B'lameh that I had at Lebanese Taverna in Washington, DC. It was definitely different from what is served in the restaurant, but it was delicious. Serve the lamb over pita chips, then layer on warm chickpeas, yogurt mixed with garlic and a little salt, sprinkle toasted pinenuts, chopped mint and pomegranate seeds on top. yum.

I didn't bother patting the lamb dry and browning it and skipped the oven entirely. I just cooked this on the stovetop. I thought the sauce by itself was a little intense, so I stirred a cup or so of greek yogurt into the sauce before serving. This mellowed it out and gave the dish a rich and creamy texture. The dish was very tasty. I agree that the fresh pomegranate seeds make the dish.

Cut back the cinnamon (half) as it just is too powerful of a spice most the time. With the lamb, the meal is ok, but we think it tastes better on chicken. I add a little water at the end just to make sure I have some sauce to add in. Biting a pomegranate seed opened just before chewing seems to be an essential part of making this meal come to life. The fresh burst of pomegranate juice with each bite makes this meal.

I was really looking forward to trying this dish and especially with all the rave reviews just knew it was going to be great. My husband and I both thought it was ok at best. I agree with the reviewer who thought that the sauce was too harsh and I thought that the blend of cumin and cinnamon gave it a really strange flavor. We ate it, but will not make it again

I didn't like this at all. I thought the sauce was too harsh with a very sharp, overly tart finish. Tried it with mint and basil and thought the basil was better. The pomegranate seeds were nice. However, I wouldn't make this again.

I would recommend not adding the 1/2 cup water at the end to the braise mixture unless absolutely necessary. My mixture became too watery. Also you can cook the lamb more than 2 minutes intially to get a really good caramelization.

Loved this recipe - it was easy to make and my family loved it (including my daughter who does not like meat.) The sauce is the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I served it with couscous and fresh basil and the pomegranate seeds which I think add a nice touch. It was even better as leftovers for lunch!!

The flavors of this dish were exquisite! Served over couscous with mint leaves and with yogurt. Very tasty. Rather than braised, I cooked the lamb and marinade in the oven instead and the sauce was then thickened a bit after it came out of the oven. I discovered we're not big fans of couscous. Next time I'll serve it over rice. Pomegranate seeds were a beautiful garnish but really not necessary as the seeds interfere with enjoyment of this dish.

I'm not always the biggest fan of lamb, but I loved this recipe. The flavors are wonderful. I also used mint and greek yogurt as suggested below, which matched perfectly.

My friend loves pomegranate molasses on her lamb so decided to make the recipe. My husband and 15-year old son loved it. Made it over rice. Very easy.

One of the best recipes we've made in a while. I couldn't find pom molasses at the store so I used this recipe http://www.elise.com/rec ipes/archives/004170po megranate_molasses.php and was very happy with it. I did use mint instead of basil (it just sounded better) and had Greek yogurt on the side as suggested here. The Greek yogurt really ties in all the flavors. Would definitely make again and again.

Very flavorful and looked beautiful with the pomegranate seeds and basil. Made as written except used Israeli couscous. As suggested by fellow cooks, served with yogurt sauce with the last of the garden mint.

This recipe was very good and as the first review suggested I used the Greek yogurt and mint. It would be so easy to do for guests since much of the work could be done early. We would have given it 4 forks but found it was wonderful but not outstanding.

Besides the tedious removal of the pom. seeds and boning the lamb, this was really easy and quick. Also, unique and delicious and a good way to use up half that bottle of pomegranate molasses you've had sitting around.

This was a little spicy. I found the pomegranate molasses and lamb at a halal butcher, but didn't get the exact cut I wanted - still ended up delicious. We used the basil, but served it with rice and coriander sweet potatoes. It was a big hit.

This was great. Made it for the break fast after Yom Kippur. So easy and fantastic. I used mint instead of basil, as it was growing on my porch...sauce seemed tart when tasted from the pan, but with the couscous, pomegranate seeds and mint on top it was perfect. Served it with greek yogurt on the side. Will definitely make again next year. also very low fat!
