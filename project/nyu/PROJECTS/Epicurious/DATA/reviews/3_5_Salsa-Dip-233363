I love this recipe! The only thing I did different was I added fresh garlic cloves, parsley and basil. I also added a whole Jalepeno which made it wayyyy to spicy lol so I suggest sticking to half jalapeno lol. I also added salt as well. It came out so good, just to spicy lol.

I cut down on the amount of lime & oil, and also drained the tomatoes briefly in a colander so the salsa would be less watery.

we all liked this and I imagine it will taste even better the next day. I used 1/4cup of O.O. and I thought it was more like a salsa than dp. I also ended up using the whole J.pepper it was small. would make it again definitely play with the amount/ingredients.

The proportions are not right, but it's easy to play around with. This is a great base recipe, especially with that touch of olive oil, and is especially good if you add some fruit (mangoes, raspberries, prickly pear, etc)

We thought the recipe itself was way too limey and way too watery, but with tweaking (much less lime; just a splash of olive oil), this recipe was incredibly easy and delicious!
