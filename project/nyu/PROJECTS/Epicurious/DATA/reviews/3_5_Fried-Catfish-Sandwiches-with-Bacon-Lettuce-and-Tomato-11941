Ugh! All I can say is that this dish is at best "hot garbage". With the overwhelming flavor of the catfish why do you need the delicate combination of bacon, lettuce and tomato. I had to make it just to see what it is like, Boy is it terrible! The catfish dusted with cornmeal then dipped in egg and dusted with cornmeal again and fried really makes a HEAVY piece of fried fish which overwhelmed everything else. When I have made catfish in the past I have lightly dusted ith with cake flour, which makes it very light. This is gruesome.

A great and easy Friday night meal. The only thing I did differently was that I grilled the bread on my panini grill and then used to make the sandwich WOW!

Very good however, I added a tablespoon of very finely chopped onion to the sauce which I think it needed.

I didn't make this recipe (and therefore I didn't review it) HOWEVER, I did use the recipe as a guide to frying fish for the first time....OUTSTANDING. I used Tilapia so it cooked in about 2 minutes total but the fish was great. Everyone - including the picky girl - loved it. Now I'm going to try this actual recipe....

A good, solid recipe for a fish sandwich. The sauce was the best part.

I deep-fried the fish. I made only two sandwichs and 1/2 pound of catfish that I cut into four pieces. All the flavors seemed to come together and it was delicious.
