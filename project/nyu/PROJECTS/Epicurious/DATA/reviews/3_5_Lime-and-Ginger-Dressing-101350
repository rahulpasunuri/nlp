Sesame overpowered everything else & was just bland. Needs more lime, more garlic, more something.

Lovely switch from the usual vinaigrette. I skipped the chili because I didn't have it, used unrefined peanut oil instead of sesame oil, seasoned with salt and pepper, and served on a green salad with pear, avocado, and macademia nuts.

I didn't like this recipe as written. Was bland and missing something. I added about 1 TB of tamari and it was pretty good.

This one took a lot of work for my taste. I added lemon grass and fish sauce and it still needed sugar. I will use it as a base and expand from there.

Yum! I made this for a salad of mixed greens, avocado, grapefruit and cashews. Yum yum yum!

Yummy flavors, but lacked a bit of acidity. I agree that lime rind might also help it along.

This is a great dressing and I loved reading the other suggestions & comments. I substituted Asian sweet chili sauce in place of the jalapeno and the sugar. It turned out yummy!

Excellent. I added a few tablespoons of peanut butter (natural - not processed) to give it a little body and the flavor went great with it as well.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I use a habanero instead of jalapeno (since we have a habanero plant out back) and I use that ginger-in-a-tube stuff that you can find in the produce section (which cuts down on time). This is refreshing and delicious served on a salad along with Mexican food. I served it along with homemade tamales for guests and they loved it.

This was such a refreshing, clean-tasting dressing. I did not add the jalapenos so it was not hot, but it was still very flavorful. I will definitely use again for many salads.

It was a huge success. I served it on a big tossed salad with assorted peppers, cucumber and toasted seseme seeds- because I didn't have any sesame oil. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

Excellent on both cabbage and mixed greens. Works as an accompaniment for both tex-mex and asian style dishes. We always get rave reviews from our guests. I would suggest adding salt.

Definitely better than any bottled dressing (and better for you, too) but very strongly flavored. A little too spicy for some people. Use sparingly. An interesting addition to this is some soy sauce.

Very tasty dressing. Add more ginger to make it even better as well as some lime rind.
