Yummy, but I did make some changes. I cheated and used Ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix and used whipping cream for the milk in the peanut butter part. I increased the peanut butter to make a bit more and made a ganache with whipping cream as per others' suggestions. I know it bugs some people when we review a recipe with so many changes, but it is the reviews/comments of others on which I decide to make changes.

I doubled the recipe for a large office party and baked in an 11x16 pan, adding an extra 5 minutes baking time. Great recipe.

Didn't really feel like buying hydrogenated peanut butter, so I made these with the freshly ground kind you get straight from the machine. Next time I will try cutting back on the powdered sugar because the peanuts were already plenty sweet (honey roasted) on their own and the result was dry and crumbly and difficult to spread (though delicious to the point of being addictive on its own). That said, I brought these to a party and people devoured them so voraciously that I had to remind them to pick the aluminum foil off the bottom rather than eating it along with the brownies. Needless to say I WILL be making these again, and exploring the adjustments necessary to continue using my favorite peanut butter.

Hands down the best brownie base on Epicurious if you like a chocolatey, moist, fudgy brownie that actually stays together (unlike the Katherine Hepburn's brownies on this site, which never seem to solidify). The peanut parts work well too, but the brownie recipe alone is worth four stars. Trader Joe's Belgian Bittersweet chocolate works very well in this recipe. I usually mix in a cup of milk chocolate chunks for contrast.

Excellent! Follow the directions and this recipe is impossible to mess up. After chilling the brownies for 1.5 hours, these cut clean and looked just like the picture. So easy and a show stopper!

I made this for my husband's birthday, he loves peanut butter and chocolate and he LOVED this and said he couldn't get enough. Even with the three layers, it was relatively easy to make. Just don't think about all of the butter going into the recipe...

The three components work nicely together to make one delicious treat. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. These brownies are rich and fudgy and worth every calorie.

Pure peanut butter chocolate heaven. This elevates the brownie to a whole new level. These are incredibly rich, so only small squares are needed. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

I adapted this recipe to make peanut-butter swirl for box brownies (Cook's Illustrated said Ghirardelli's were pretty close to the best homemade). The results were awesome. -- I mixed the box brownies according to package directions, but replacing peanut oil for half the oil, and adding 1/2 c chocolate chips. -- For the peanut butter swirl, I increased both the peanut butter and the nutmeg: 1/2 jar chunky unsalted peanut butter (plus 1/8 tsp of salt to compensate), 1/4 c butter, 3/4 c powdered sugar, another 1/8 tsp salt, a little over 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 Tbsp normal milk/soymilk, 1 tsp vanilla. -- Microwave the peanut mix on low until soft enough to spoon into chunky drizzles on top of the brownie mix in the pan, and swirl with a toothpick. Don't mix it in TOO thoroughly. This was an enormous hit.

If you like fudgy brownies--or maybe something halfway between fudge and brownies--this brownie base is the BEST brownie ever! Easy, reliable; made with Trader Joe's unsweetened chocolate and pound-plus 72% bar, it's wonderful. The peanut stuff is good too, of course. But it's the brownies that keep me coming back to this recipe. I've made it several times, and it's never failed.

Very, very, very good recipe! Easy enough to make. Yummy texture with the crunchy peanuts. The only things I might change in the future would be to make a recipe and a half (or even double) of the peanut butter frosting. Also, might try the ganache with milk chocolate since hubby loves the lighter stuff. Will be making these again soon!

Wow, just great. My rating is always dependant upon if others request the recipe. This one was a keeper! I didnt have the peanuts so I used choc. chips instead. Because of that I added a bit more salt to make up for the lack of salt in the nuts.

Very intense! The first time I made these everyone LOVED them, but there was some confusion if they were brownies or fudge! Since then I take out the brownies slightly early (around 25min cook time), which leaves them so chocolatey and thick, and I just call it chocolate peanut butter fudge! It tastes so similar to fudge, but is easier to make. yummm.

These were excellent! I made them for a super bowl party, and they were a huge hit. I left the peanuts out of the brownies because I didn't have any on hand, and felt that the brownie texture was probably better for the omission. Also, after reading a few reviews saying that the ganache separated from the peanut butter frosting, I decided to make my ganache using 3/4 cup heavy cream, heated and mixed with about 8 oz. bittersweet chocolate chips (no butter.) I refrigerated the brownies with the peanut butter frosting, then poured the slightly cooled ganache over the frosting and spread it carefully. Delicious! I used chunky peanut butter as called for in the recipe, but I'm sure they'd be just as good with creamy peanut butter, especially for people who prefer a smoother texture.

I have made these brownies many times, not being a brownie lover myself I am happy to say that I love these! They always have rave reviews but I do make a few modifications... I just use 10 oz of Ghirardelli chocolate chips (generally dark) and cut back to 3/4 cup of sugar since they are already sweetened. I don't use peanuts because my family isn't used to nuts in brownies. The first time I made these I made the mistake of putting 1/2 stick of butter in the peanut butter frosting instead of dividing it. After making it the other way I decided to always use that amount in the frosting because it is much easier to spread. I found that when I used 1/2 a stick the frosting was too clumpy to spread well. My hubby also said they were not as good as the first time. Not a big fan of nutmeg either, so I leave that out. A great brownie recipe - LOVE it! :-)

These were truly a little slice of heaven on earth. Easy to make and the peanut butter ganache was the best I've ever had. I may try using it in the middle of cupcakes as well.Do yourself a favor.....I used a square cookie cutter to cut them and they were absolutely picture perfect.

I used smooth rather than chunky peanutbutter in the ganache and it was delicious. I loved the salted peanuts - it helped cut the sweetness but this made it less appealing to my kids. I would try next time without the nuts.

Hmmmm, these were really good but I'm not singing their praises from the mountaintops like some other posters. Maybe we overcooked the fudge brownies? A tester in the center never came out like the recipe described. We cooked for 10-15 minutes longer.

Dang. Double dang. These brownies were mind-bogglingly delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and made 1 1/2 times the amount of the peanut butter frosting. It was, of course, yummy, but I think next time I would stick with the original amount. They looked beautiful and are definitely worth the bit of effort. Seriously, if you need to make new friends, bake these brownies and share. I chilled them for about an hour after I spread the ganache, and I think they are easier to slice cleanly when the ganache has a more fudge- like consistency than when it has solidified. They came out in clean squares with no cracking or breaking after an hour in the fridge. Yes, I will totally make these again. and eat them all.

Rating: 4
After having made this recipe three times now, I can confidently say that this recipe ROCKS. If you need to make friends with a new group of people, bring these brownies. The only change I make is to cut the recipe in half and cook in an 8x8" pan (it's just the husband and me, and we can't eat that many), though I do NOT halve the PB part so you get a decent amount of the 'frosting'. Otherwise, I've made it as written, and it's come out great every time.

I made these brownies for a potluck dinner party, and they were a huge hit!!! Everyone thought they came from a bakery! Use the best quality chocolate possible (I used Callebaut) for the best results, especially in the ganache. The PB frosting was delicious, with just the right texture combined with the brownie base and the ganache. If you are short on time, make the brownies by themselves, and sprinkle with powdered sugar for a nice presentation. You can substitue the peanuts for almonds, walnuts, pecans, etc.

Rating: 2
I did not think these were quite as good as everyone else did. That said, they were great, I think I would rather spend my time and money on another recipe though because all of the ingredients really add up. I cut down the sugar in the brownies by 1/2 c and the sweetness was a good level. The brownies themselves were a little dry, so you might consider making another brownie recipe and then frosting it with the PB and chocolate frostings.

I really wanted to like these brownies. I have had my eye on this recipe for months. Unfortunately, they were WAY too fudgy and dense for my taste. Each brownie resembled a heavy block of fudge. If you are looking for a fudge recipe, maybe this one is for you. Otherwise, I highly recommend the Barefoot Contessa's Outrageous Brownies. These are totally over the top...in a good way.

Rating: 4
To those who stated their ganache was gloppy and did not spread well. Are you using chocolate chips instead of bittersweet chocolate? Because most chocolate chips are designed to retain their shape when baking, they contain less cocoa butter than baking chocolate. This can make them more difficult to work with in melted form.

Rating: 4
These are seriously good brownies! I cut the recipe in half and made them in an 8x8 pan. Definitely chill the peanut frosting layer at least 30 minutes before spreading on the ganache. I agree that there could be a bit more of the peanut butter frosting and would make 1 1/2 times the recipe for that next time.

Rating: 4
Loved these brownies - very unique looking and tasting. I used bittersweet chocolate with good results - the bars were rich, but definitely not too sweet. The only modification I would make in the future is to increase the peanut butter frosting portion of the brownie - I thought it was quite good and slightly underrepresented in the finished product. Other than that, they are a little bit time consuming, but very much worth it.

This was a really solid brownie recipe. I followed the directions as written and they got rave reviews from chocolate and peanut butter lovers. The only minor change I will make next time, it to use creamy peanut butter instead of chunky. There are peanuts in the brownie and it really is a personal preference. Also make sure you use a good peanut butter. I used the store brand because it was on sale, however I felt that it was a little subpar interms of flavor. Overall a nice recipe.

This is one of the best recipes for brownies I have ever tried. They are fudgy and decadent. I made these a couple of months ago for a friends birthday and everyone loved them. This time I made them I decided to switch it up and use Nutella for the frosting and put chocolate chips in the brownie batter (if I had any hazelnuts I would have thrown a few in.) I think I am going to substitute the nutmeg for cinnamon. The brownies are still in the oven, but I will see how they turn out with the new frosting!

I used creamy peanut butter & omitted the peanuts, only because I knew my 2 year old daughter would want a bite and we don't feed her nuts yet for fear of choking. These brownies are absolutely sinful, i.e. wickedly delicious! They're the best brownie recipe I've discovered yet!

I am not adding a rating since I haven't yet tried these, but to those who are finding spreading the ganache difficult: I have a similar recipe with a buttercream filling and the ganache for that one works beautifully--4 squares of semi-sweet chocolate and 1/4 c. butter melted together and stirred. This can be done in the microwave. Spread on top AFTER the cream layer has chilled in the refrig at least 1 hour.

The best brownies ever. I made a mistake and used wax paper instead of foil. Getting it off was a little tricky but they still came out great. Chill the peanut layer a few minutes before adding the chocolate. It helps keep them from running together.

Delicious!!! But with all that butter, it's a doozy of a dessert. I've made it twice now. Once without nutmeg (which I am not fond of) and now with. I have to say that the nutmeg does add something more sophisticated to the recipe. Will always include it from now on. And with the response I get, I'm definitely making it again--

Rating: 3
Easy to do and wonderfully rich. I used pb chips as suggested. I think the chips go better with the moist texture of the brownie then nuts. My frosting went goopy - I ended up patting it on the brownies (I'd love to know how I could have messed up this part?) I used bittersweet for the ganache (and brownies) next time I think I would use milk chocolate for the ganache as I think it would better with the frosting. These are very rich - my guests actually sliced my small pieces even smaller.

Jjust made for a friends birthday and got very good reviews:) I have to say these are extremely rich so i would advise cutting in very small squares! Also, my top layer a chocolate was not very spreadable so i just threw down a bunch of blobs of the top layer of peanut butter and swirled with a toothpick and it ended up looking quite pretty. A very very very delicious and quite easy recipe!

My husband loves peanut butter but thought these were a little too rich. Good with a cold glass of milk!

Absolutely fabulous! I did not have a probelm with the frosting not sticking to the brownies. Although, I inadvertently used 1/2 cup of butter (instead of 1/4 cup) in the frosting. When I realized my error, my husband told me "there's no such thing as too much butter". I served them on a hot summer day, so they very quickly became room temperature. So, maybe the combination of the extra butter and serving at room temperature was lucky. Would DEFINITELY make them again, again and again.

These are the best brownies I have ever had. I love the nutmeg in the frosting, it's indescribably good and really adds something wonderful. If you left it out, you made a mistake! I highly advise you make them again with the nutmeg. We used honey roasted peanuts and added some extra salt to the peanut butter frosting, and I thought this was perfect for my tastes. I love these, and want to make them again, and again, and again! I've made lots of brownies and peanut butter chocolate combos, and I don't think you could find anything better.

I made these for my husband's birthday. He is the ultimate PB & chocolate fan. I did "sway" from the recipe by making his favorite chocolate chunk box mix brownies (leaving the peanuts out of the brownies as well) & made the remainder of the recipe as directed except I chopped about 1/4 c. of dry roasted lightly salted peanuts and sprinkled over the ganache before it completely set up. We did cut it before the recommended chilling of 1 1/2 hours & they were very good (who could resist?) But I have to admit they're even better the second day! I used bittersweet chocolate in the ganache (personal preference) as there's a lot of sweetness in both the brownie & the frosting. These are very rich & decadent. I will definitely be making again.

This recipe is delicious. I used peanut butter chips as another user recommended, but I think I might go ahead and use the peanuts in the future because I liked the crunch of the crunchy peanut butter.

Tonight I used the same basic recipe, but instead of peanuts I added chocolate chips and walnuts, and instead of the peanut butter in the frosting I used 1 block of cream cheese. They were out of this world. Around Christmas, I will probably do the cream cheese version, but add some peppermint oil to the cream cheese and maybe Ande's mint pieces instead of chocolate chips.

I have made this several times with or w/o the nuts and it always lookes like I bought them from a bakery. When spreading the ganach leave some ripples so when you cut the tops look nice.

This is my first home made brownie experience. I made these for a potluck and they were delicious. However, being that I made them after a tiring day, there are simple mistakes that I have to remind first time bakers to look out for. Dont melt your chocolate directly in the pot. Get a metal mixing bowl, put it over a pot of boiling water, and let it melt, with no chance of burning (I know I made a huge mistake and felt rather stupid). Secondly, the foil might be quite frustrating. This was my first time making brownies in that fashion. It was hard to butter, and the chocolate didnt spread so I kept bunching the foil trying to distribute the mixture. But in the end, I definitely think it is a good idea and for this type of chocolate mixture, I think it is necessary. The recipe says it makes 30 brownies, I probably got more. Like most users advice, they are rich with chocolate and a lot goes a long way. Also, the recipe brownies call for semi sweet or bittersweet chocolate; I would go with the semi sweet because the chocolate is already so rich and provides a good contrast to the unsweetened chocolate on top of the ganache. Overall I thought they were delicious and I also got a lot of they seem like you bought it from a store compliments.

THis is excellent and a nice change from 'plain' brownies. I made these non-dairy, by using non- hydrogenated margarine, instead of butter, non-milk chocolate, and water in the peanut butter frosting instead of milk. Also, my family doesn't like chunks of nuts in brownies, so I left out the peanut pieces. Also, I ran out of unsweetened chocolate, so used cocoa (3 tablespoons cocoa and one tablespoon fat for every ounce of unsweetened chocolate). It set very nicely after a few hours in the fridge.

Excellent recipe! Very rich and very good but not very difficult to make. My brownies were done closer to 25 min than 30.

Wonderful chocolate/peanut butter combo. I put the peanut butter frosting on after about 20-30 min cooling, while still warm, and used my fingers to spread/mold the frosting -- it worked really well as the frosting isn't so "spreadable". Also I used the Reynolds Release foil as the liner and didn't butter it and it worked fine. I cut the squares while still on the foil and then just peeled them out.

These brownies are RICH. Make sure you have a gallon of milk on hand to wash them down. I used regular brownie mix and then added the peanuts in, topped it off with the peanut butter and ganache.

An extremely chocolate-y version of a pretty standard fudge brownie--very easy to make. I had no problem with any part of the recipe and made no changes. I found the nutmeg to be a nice touch for the peanut butter frosting. Also, had no problems spreading the frosting--I just waited until the brownies were completely cool and mixed the ingredients for the frosting until fluffy (the recipe says to mix until "blended"...well, I really mixed). Also, cutting the brownies into 30 pieces makes for a great size. A fun treat that even my 4-year old enjoyed.

Much oohing and aahing. People said these were the most amazing brownies they've ever had.

This dessert was terrific. very rich and decadent. I ended up using a box brownie mix and smooth peanut butter and it was amazing.

I made these for a party. They received rave reviews, and they were surprisingly easy. Perfect dessert to satisfy a peanut butter/chocolate craving.

These were really great and easy. My family voted for creamy peanut butter,which spread easily on the cooled brownies. I also omitted the nutmeg,but did everything else the same. No dryness here,just a deep, rich, special brownie.

I found the brownie part was a bit dry and the peanut butter tops fell completely off. The brownie didn't remind me of brownies but more like Rum Balls without the rum. Kids loved these.

Incredibly delicious, so chocolatey and rich.

I'm definitely making this again! I also omitted the nutmeg, and was glad I did so. My brownies weren't as dense or heavy, because everywhere the recipe called for semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, I substituted a bit of milk chocolate (I'm not the biggest fan of dark chocolate either).

My husband and I loved these! I kept a few bars in the refrigerator and froze the rest of them. They freeze beautifully with no negative effect on taste, texture or appearance. The comments on dryness must be attributed to the differences in ovens, not a fault of the recipe! I also did not experience any difficulties spreading the peanut butter layer. These bars elevate the "every day" brownie into something more sophisticated and special occasion - and probably won't appeal to those who don't care for a darker chocolate note.

These brownies are restaurant-quality, very impressive to look at and tasty to eat. They were not hard to make either. Like others have mentioned, the peanut butter mixture was too thick to spread, even though I didn't let the brownie cool off entirely thinking the warmth would help things along. Try this instead: Plop the peanut butter mixture onto the brownie in several dollops. Using a piece of plastic wrap the size of the pan, press the peanut butter mixture over the brownie. I got a nice even layer this way, and clean hands too! I agree that cutting them into tiny (1-inch squares) is a must. This is sweet stuff!

I made this recipe just as it was printed with one exception...I omitted the nutmeg as a personal preference. I had no problem spreading the peanut icing. The Kids Raved about them!

I made these and brought them to work. People raved! I checked them before 30 mins. and they were done at about 24-25 mins. I also made them with a box brownie mix with chocolate chunks and they were still delicious!! Saved a lot of time. The toppings are what make this recipe.

These were very rich and very delicious. I used Jif Creamy instead of chunky and I would do that again. I will definately make these again, they remind me of a reese's peanut butter cup brownie with fresh peanuts inside.

I agree with the cook from LasVegas. The brownies were dry and the nutmeg/peanut butter combination was not something I cared for. Also, the crunchy peanut butter mixture was very difficult to spread over the brownie. The idea behind this recipe is good, but it needs some tweeking if I were to make it again.

everybody who tried these flipped about how good they were. i liked them, but really, what's not to like when you combine chocolate and peanut butter? they were easy to make and travelled well.

Another fabulous dessert by Dorie Greenspan. Wouldn't change a thing. Rave review. Make sure to serve at room temperature.

I felt these were overrated. I made these and lemon bars for our Super Bowl party. The lemon bars got rave reviews and were the favorite dessert. I wont be making these brownies again. I felt the brownie was too dry (I like very moist) and have made and would recommend Miss Milton's Fudge Pie from this site. I also didn't care for the nutmeg and peanut butter combo.

Very good; even better the next day. Received rave reviews from the office.

Wow--These are great. Everyone loves them. The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were great. The second time, I put half as much ganache on the top because I thought the version as written had so much chocolate that it obscured some of the peanut butter flavor. I also used "smooth" Jif instead of chunky because I thought the version as written had enough texture with the nuts in the brownies. I liked the second time better, but if you love chocolate and extra-nutty peanut butter, go with the version as written.

These went over well at the office - everyone loved them! Followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfectly. Next time, however, I may sprinkle chopped peanuts on top of the chocolate frosting for a little added interest and texture. Will definitely make these again!

These were awesome. I had several people tell me these were the best brownies they had ever had, and I have to agree. Perfect for the PB/Chocolate lover. Brownies were very moist. I would make no changes.

These were fabulous - the brownies were very moist and fudgy, and the two toppings made the dessert very decadent. Don't be worried if the brownies feel like they weigh a ton when they come out of the oven - they do, but only because they are so fudgy.

Professional results--incredibly tasty. Made for a dinner party on Saturday night. Everyone raved. Two days later all are gone. I was short one block of chocolate for the frosting & this seemingly made no difference. Fantastique!

Great recipe. My nephews' feedback was that this may be the best thing that I have ever baked, and I bake a lot.

These were really good. They were pretty too. I cut them into 1" squares b/c they were so rich. That size was perfect since they were part of a dessert buffet. I was 1 oz. short of bittersweet and had to add an extra oz. of unsweetened chocolate to the brownie part. My dad commented that they were a little too bitter for him, but I loved them that way. The peanut butter filling is perfect, and the ganache makes them look sophisicated. This will go in my permenant file.

This is a killer recipe! The brownies, frosting, and ganache are each delicious on their own, but combined they make a special cookie. They are very rich (a plus in my book!) so I'd cut them small, like 1 inch square. The ganache gives the cookies a very finished look, and with the three layers they display very nicely. They are easy to make, although it takes a bit of time to do all three layers, but they're well worth it. This cookie is a keeper!
