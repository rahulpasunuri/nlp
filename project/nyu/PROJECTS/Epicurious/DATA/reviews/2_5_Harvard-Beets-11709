I checked this out just to refresh my memory..As it is such an old standby. I see there are no new recipes entered either...so, I would add more corn starch (even better ... arrow root) and use balsalmic vinegar. Just forget the sugar or maybe add turbino if you've got it around..Maple syrup anything but plain old white sugar. Two Tablespoons is way too much anyway. Used twice the amount butter and fresh black pepper and fresh nutmeg.....Cooked over the stove to check consisitency and have better control, I didn't use the micro wave. Also, if the beets ( I dice mine, the old fashioned way)are cooked just perfect and you achieve that certain twang of piquant zesty remembered flavor.. This side attraction can be a sure winner. Not just a so so dish....

I grew up with these beets. It's sweet/sour, maybe a little too sweet, but delicious.

The recipe does not have enough cornstarch to make it thicken. I did not care for the flavor. I recommend trying Balsamic-Glazed Beets.
