Surprisingly good! I served with a dollop of seasoned diced tomatoes on top for color (was using the tomatoes for bruschetta so had them on hand). I agree with the reviewer who says that 1 cup of uncooked quinoa is enough to make this. I'm new to Quinoa so bought 12 oz uncooked, and now have fluffy quinoa filling my fridge. Next time I'll try baking them as recommended by other reviewers as it wasn't easy to get them to cook through without searing the tops and bottoms, even on low heat.

Great...much better than plain quinoa. I used the instructions give by a reviewer to oven bake at 350F, about 10 mins/side, on well greased pan. Worked great. Also poured boiling water over the chopped onion to calm them down. I'm sure I'll make often.

Regarding the goat cheese - I think the author may have simply intended to mention it as a suggested addition or option for the recipe. My children and I LOVED this recipe! They even ask for these patties for lunch! It's a very versatile dish - feel free to change up the seasonings. I've made them with cilantro instead of chives; a combination of feta cheese and grano padano instead of Parmesan (doubled the amount of cheese for better results); gluten-free bread crumbs instead of wheat (note-I find it works better with half the amount of crumbs that the recipe calls for); and have added a small can of salmon to make it more substantial. For best results, use an ice-cream scoop to place them on the pan; use a cast-iron pan and a metal spatula to both flatten and flip the patties. Serve with fleur-de-sel and a dollop of garlic/chili aioli. Yummm!

These came out great! Almost a mini veggie burger. I followed the recipe, adding a bit more cheese. I formed in small patties and they stayed together fine. Fried them on each side and served with tzatziki sauce, which complemented them well. My husband was looking forward to bringing them for lunch leftovers. Saved half the batch and will try baking and serving with marinara tomorrow night.

I made these last night and would echo all the very positive reviews - I baked them on a cookie sheet at 375-400 for 12 minutes a side ,and they held together perfectly, and tasted great: very substantial. It's a great way to use a favourite grain of ours. Even my omnivore partner thought they were delicious, and had seconds! My only comment: what the what with the amount of quinoa! To wit: I rinsed and cooked the 2 cups' worth, and now ... have a large tupperware of several cups' of extra cooked quinoa in my fridge. Not that that's a bad thing, but you don't need any more than 1 cup dried quinoa for this recipe!

Rating: 4
These puppies are tastiliscious!! I used Italian style bread crumbs and more green onions than listed. I also made the patties a little smaller than recommended because they fall apart quite easily. I can see adding all kinds of ingredients to these in the future, such as: spinach, kale, or any cooked veggie. I will make them again for sure. I ate them for days and I would sometimes eat them cold, dipping them into some Greek style yogurt. I like recipes that are stellar on their own, but also have ability to morph into something else. Different ingredients, cheeses, and other changes can be made to make these new every time.

Rating: 3
These were delicious, but I was unable to make them into patties. I packed them tight into balls but the moment I tried to flatten them even a little into patties they started to fall apart in my hands. They fell apart even more when I laid them in the pan. By the time I flipped them they had disintegrated completely. Next time I will either try them in the oven as some other reviewers suggested, or make it like a scramble. The flavors were delicious though so I will attempt these again.

these were really good and easy to put together. i didn't have any issues with them falling apart. These are healthy and delicious but I think to make them a little more memorable I think it needs something on top...maybe the smoke mozzarella and ragu recipe that's on this website would be a good match.

Love, love, love these! Simple and tasty. I added bacon and bleu cheese per the more complicated recipe that comes after this one. To keep the patties from falling apart, squish them in your hands very firmly, like making meatballs then flatten them while smoothing the edges. I did this with the second round and they were perfect.

Great recipe as is or modified. I just made some with a Thai herb and spice blend that comes in a tube and some with a basil blend that also comes in a tube, but with this one I added chopped sun-dried tomatoes and red pepper flakes. In both, I opted for no cheese. I bake at 400 degrees and turn after the bottom browns instead of frying. Both versions are delicious! This recipe is easy peasy and very versatile.

Rating: 3
Just delicious and rather versatile. I kept the proportions of quinoa, egg and bread crumbs but added finely chopped ckd cauliflower, scallion tops, red onion only a little parmesan. They would be great with a fried egg for breakfast, with any bits of leftovers for lunch. I'm thinking of a kimchee version next.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes, and it's infinitely adaptable. Today I threw in diced radishes, parsley and feta. Other times I've thrown in various beans and nuts I had on hand. They always come out great. I find that the patties hold together best when they're baked on a well-oiled pan in a 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes on each side. They still form a nice crust, and the baking seems to make them a little sturdier. Either way, they're delicious!

Rating: 3
Really yummy, but they are definitely a bit crumbly. I substituted the green parts of scallions for chives (which are much more expensive), and that still worked really well. Make sure to make them a bit thick, otherwise they dry out.

Rating: 4
As the reviews suggest, these are fantastic and have quickly become a staple in my house. They're very versatile, I've followed the recipe and I've used sausage. Curry is next on the list! As others people mention, quinoa can be frozen and re-heated in the microwave. In the past month and a half my two roommates and I have gone through close to 10 pounds of quinoa! We order it in bulk online (Amazon), which is also a good option if you live somewhere without easy access to this delicious grain!

Added bacon crumbles, goat cheese and long red peppers. Cooked the garlic and onions first. They are a little iffy holding together, but once you get the crust cooked on the bottom they hold together nicely!

I had a hard time getting the patties to stay formed, despite following the recipe. However, the flavor is so good, I just cook the whole thing in a couple of batches, making sure I get a crust on the bottom. It has such a nutty flavor, it's a great side dish to our meals for the week!

Delicious. My husband put ketchup on top and ate about 5 of these. They really are delicious!

Very adaptable. I used feta cheese and some leftover parmesean, and some dill and italian spices rather than the chives and panko crumbs rather than the bread crumbs and it turned out great. I had to add an extra egg because my first batch fell apart, but it all tasted REALLY delicious. I chopped an avocado on top, but I can see topping it with some tzaziki/yogurt and cucumber sauce or salsa.

Rating: 4
These are great! I doubled the garlic and sauted it with the onion due to my husband's 96 year old grandma's stomach that does not do well with raw onions. I left out the chives and added pesto. (I make my own pesto and freeze it in ice cube trays so I used 2 cubes of pesto.) Made with goat cheese and served with a think marinara sauce over the top.

I may have had too much quinoa but I found my patties didn't stick together well. I added an extra egg to try to make it easier to hold together. I too found this bland & will add more garlic salt &/or soy sauce next time. I may also try what other reviewers suggested by either adding veggies like shredded zucchini or carrot or red bell pepper but tonight, I just made it as is. Maybe cooking the quinoa in chicken broth would've helped the flavor. But I love how versatile the recipe is. I too am confused about the words goat cheese in it. Are you supposed to use goat cheese? I love that someone suggested taziki...next time, I will maybe mix some fresh cucumber & dill into creme friace to top the patties.

These were exactly what I was looking for. Funny when I first read over the recipe, I thought it sounded like one from Heidi Swanson! I like the healthy aspect of her recipes, but also that they're tasty. She almost always gives you some ideas for other ingredients, as well. I used 2 regular eggs and 2 flax "eggs", cut the bread crumbs down to just 4 crushed crackers, added 1/2 c chopped toasted walnuts, 2 finely chopped green onions, several sprigs of chopped fresh parsley, and used walnut oil for frying. They were little quinoa patties of toasty, nutty deliciousness! Good as is, cool and crumbled in salad the next day, and even as mini "pizza" crusts. I'm thinking next time maybe some mushrooms and bleu cheese... mmmm...

These have quickly become a favorite at our house. We don't use leftover quinoa. We make it specifically for this recipe. It's very flexible. You can easily sub different cheeses and herbs.

This is going on my list of standbys. Served it to a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I wasn't sure they'd work for a group, because they take time to fry, but I did them in advance and they kept warm in the oven. I left the leftovers uncooked, and made some patties for lunch today - super-delicious! And really filling. I melted some gruyere on top - yum!

These were wonderful...followed recipe as written and served with Whole grain mustard aioli from this site. The aioli really set them apart.

These turned out to be surprisingly tasty, and not just for health burgers - a hit with carnivores and quinoa-haters alike! I tried these burgers a number of ways: with various cheeses (feta, goat, cheddar, and even cream cheese), with breadcrumbs and with AP flour, fried and baked. They don't disappoint. Two suggestions: I don't think they are worth frying. I baked them at 400 degrees F, 12 min. each side, and they were perfect! Use greased parchment paper. I also halved the amount of breadcrumbs/flour, as previously suggested, and it worked well, no need for more.

I had only tried quinoa once before and found it to be rather bland, but needing to change my lifestyle, I came face to face with this superfood once again and wanted to try something different than what I remembered. When I came across this recipe, I definitely got excited and after reading some of the other reviews, felt like this would be the perfect recipe to try quinoa again. WOW. Can we say yummy? I headed some of the other reviewers suggestions and got creative with some add-ons. I shredded up a carrot or two, sliced up some zucchini, switched out the chives for fresh cilantro and put the goat cheese back into play. I also added 2 tsp of ground coriander and 2 tsp of ground yellow curry. When it came to making the quinoa, I used 1 cup dry quinoa and cooked it in 2.5 cups of water with 1 vegetable bouillon cube, which rendered the 2.5 cups of cooked quinoa. I fried my patties with ghee (clarified butter) and served them up with some ground sumac, which added a nice acidic balance to these tasty treats. My friends raved about them all night! I will DEFINITELY be making these again & I'm excited to try some other freestyle ingredients in the future.

My first foray into the world of quinoa and I am quite happy with it. This recipe is very easy and has a lot of potential for personalizing. I look forward to making more batches with my own personal touches. Next time, I'm thinking sun dried tomatoes, more fresh herbs, and goat cheese.

As other reviwers have mentioned, these delicious patties can carry a whole range of flavours - allowing you customize them to your cuisine of choice. Like others, I tried getting away with 2, or 3 eggs - but you do actually need all 4 for the patties to hold up. I was initially surprised at the instructions to brown the patties: I thought the heat was too low. But the instructions are spot on. Definitely a great way to get this "superfood" into your diet!

I am so happy I found this recipe. It is so easy, versatile, and delicious! First time I tried it with a little soy sauce marinade, yum. Second time with some sauteed onion, melted fontina, and bbq sauce, even better! I should point out that I did not include the grated parm in the original mixture but subbed a little whole wheat flour instead to help it stick together. A seriously good recipe, I highly recommend it.

i think these are very good, very flexible and forgiving. the first time i made with only two eggs, which wasn't enough, but still managed to come together. the second time i made these with the 4 the recipe calls for. definite improvement. i also used less bread crumbs and more cheese (a manchego-like variety). i added some chopped red pepper and cauliflower. i think i would like these with even more cheese. tasty and filling.

I am in the process of making these for the first time. I am completely confused - the recipe subtitle mentions GOAT CHEESE, yet despite reading the recipe several times (also in her cookbook) I see NO MENTION of goat cheese. Am I blind? None of the other reviewers mentions this.

Rating: 4
These are awesome. I started out making these to use up extra cooked quinoa; now I make huge batches so I have extra patties for easy lunches, snacks, and even breakfasts. An electric griddle helps, as does a food processor for very finely mincing all the ingredients, and an ice cream scoop for forming the patties. Once you make them a few times, the handling gets easier, and you can add all kinds of different herbs and veggies to change the flavor profile. One of my personal favorites...stir in cooked chopped (squeezed dry) spinach, gruyere and a little extra garlic. I also prefer using extra chives or scallions in place of the minced onion. So delicious.

Rating: 3
Fairly easy to make, had a thick, meat like texture. I served the patties with a meat heavy tomato sauce and they stood up to it well, no mushiness. Would make a good base for burgers, easy to change flavor profile. Entire family, including an easy going toddler, liked this dish a lot.

Exploring quinoa as a new staple and this was a very fine beginning. Great as the recipe is written and I can see many possibilities for variations. Will add a bit more moisture next time, or a bit less bread crumbs. Reheats very nicely.

delicious, felxible recipe. did not bother frying after the first scramble-quinoa batch. Formed patties and threw them on oiled surface in oven. I suppose using flour instead of breadcrumbs would work. did use feta and sundried tomatos since no chives or parmesan were on hand. Parmesan is almost never on hand here because it is one of those hard salty cheeses that actually draw calcium out of the body

These patties are wonderful! I made the mixture ahead of time and had it handy in the fridge. Made the patties when my husband had an old friend visiting and used my crumpet rings to make 6 large patties on the griddle. Then I sauteed mushrooms and garlic along with some leftover ratatouille in a pan on the side and served the patties over the veggie mixture. The guys raved about the meal and nobody missed meat. This one is a definite keeper!

Rating: 3
it is best with left-over quinoa that is slightly overcooked. the stickier- the better. I found that I didn't need the breadcrums when i used quinoa that I had cooked for about 30 minutes. Otherwise the flavors are really great for breakfast/brunch/lunch. I have and will make these again for the whole family.

We also thought this was a keeper. Used red quinoa which has a lovely appearance and threw a shallot into the food processor while making the breadcrumbs. Served with a small dollop of aioli, a salad of edamame and black beans with a lime vinaigrette and sliced heirloom tomatoes. Beautiful meal. BTW, quinoa can be cooked ahead and frozen in plastic zipper bags to make this a really quick meal to prepare.

Great recipe. My 13 month old really likes it too and since quinoa is high in protein, combined with the eggs, it's a win-win! I didn't have any onion or chives, so I just threw in some basil/garlic scapes pesto I had made and it was delicious. I actually would probably add one less egg as it made it taste kind of egg-y/quiche-like, but what a great, simple recipe. I can see adding sun-dried tomatoes or whatever veg she recommends and it's a whole meal in one pattie. Our veg friends are gonna love this.

I modified these slightly by not adding the onions or the chives (as I was making them for a group where some people don't like onions) and added broiled asparagus. YUM. I also made an avocado/lemon/sour cream puree for it. The quinoa patties ARE delicious and a very innovative use of quinoa (protein patties!), but they are a little dry. They definitely benefit from a creamy sauce or aioli. I plan on serving these chilled with some lemon juice squeezed overtop. My husband and I are very pleased with these!!!

My husband and I loved this. I made the quinoa with chicken broth earlier in the day - the amount given at the bottom of the recipe is twice what you will need! I used goat cheese instead of Parmesan (since it is listed in the heading) and cilantro and made the patties very thin as suggested. I chilled it for about 15 minutes, but I think the goat cheese also helped in holding the patties together. I served it with a lemon aioli sauce and asparagus (also on Epicurious). A nice, light summer dinner.

Easy and a really fun way to eat quinoa. I used a biscuit cutter to mold the patties once they were in the pan which help them set. The timing was just about perfect but I did need to watch the second batch. Next time I am going to serve them with a little sauce ... maybe green goddess. Enjoy!

These are so good! I'm already making my 2nd batch (this time, I added some shredded carrot, and next time I might try to add some mushrooms). I liken them to a veggie burger - one night I had them with sliced avocado and some salsa and sour cream, another day I took some for lunch with a little smear of mayo and mustard. I bet they'd also be good with bbq or hummus.

Rating: 4
Wow...these are soooo good. I made a number of changes for food sensitivities and to use up a few pantry items, and I can think of about a dozen more variations I want to try now. First, I wanted them to be gluten free, so I put some gluten free crackers made from 3 or 4 types of seeds, nuts, and flours in the food processor for my crumbs. Next, I used a flaxmeal egg substitution (conversion can be found on your fine- milled flax container) and goat cheese (easier on the stomach than cows' milk cheeses) instead of the parm. From my pantry, I added some pesto (about 1/2 c) and sundried tomatoes I chopped finely (maybe 2/3 c?). I didn't have the difficulty getting them to stick together that others mentioned possibly because of the moisture in the goat cheese, so they cooked beautifully--just like the picture. I topped with avocado, as suggested, and this recipe is a DEFINITE keeper!

Quinoa cooking suggestions: Cook it like pasta, pour off the excess liquid once done. Cook it in stock for more flavor, toast it slightly in oil before cooking for added nuttiness. Also, like rice, you get a lot for your cup, so I'd use less than indicated. If perfect patties are your goal, get a device used to fry eggs into those nice shapes for sandwiches. Works like a charm.

This recipe looks great but it does not mention the goat cheese in the list of ingredients.

Rating: 4
The mention of goat cheese is also in the book - I assume it's an editorial error. It happens. For folks having trouble forming the patties, texture is really important here. Pick up a palm full and squeeze, then release. If the mixture holds together in a clump, then it's ready to form the patty. Place some mixture in one palm, then use your other palm and your thumbs to smoosh and shape the patty very tightly. Gently place the patty in the heated pan. Once one side browns, it will hold together well enough to be flipped. I really enjoyed these - they're like a healthier potato pancake. Also note that I cut this recipe fully in half, and it still made 10 patties. 2-1/2 cups of quinoa is a lot of quinoa (although mine were probably smaller than Heidi intended).

Since I was in school and the teacher speak about the old Incan Empire always I was fascinated with their way to grow the food in mountain terrace, and quinoa was one of the more important due his high protein levels (14g/100g) Of course that in my first Peruvian restaurant experience was the first for I asked, but real...ly was a bit disappointed because quinoa in this day is just a side dish or addition to your plate and dont look very attractive or better said much different than rice dish. But with recipes like that the whole history can change and the quinoa claims his place between the great grains of humanity. http://kitchenvoyage.blogspot.com/p/waitrose-recipes.html

I loved the idea of these, but the execution was difficult--the patties disintegrated in the pan even though I chilled the mixture in an effort to firm it up. Like the previous reviewer, I ended up with far too much quinoa after following the cooking instructions at the bottom of the recipe. (I put about half of the plain cooked quinoa in the freezer for another day.) And where was the goat cheese alluded to just under the "yield" info? Good, but not great.

I did think the quinoa cooking instructions at the end were slightly off-- this makes more than 3 cups of quinoa. So be careful about that. Also, I did need a lot of extra water and the patties were hard to get into the pan...once there, they fried up nicely and became contained. But it was messy getting them in and I have no idea how anyone managed to get such delightfully uniform things as appear in the picture...
