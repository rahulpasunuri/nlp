This was excellent & my guests were impressed. At 1st I had trouble w/ the cake but that was because I didn't beat it enough. When the batter was beaten until it was thick & turned pale the cake turned out fine, if anything it rose more than expected & didn't taste eggy at all. I do agree that it was alot of work & there wasn't enough custard. I do plan to make this again, just not right away.

This trifle was very time consuming to make but my guests raved about, it which made it worth the effort. The cakes turned out very flat and the carmel sauce was a bit of a challenge (1/2 of it ended up crystalizing). Next time I would double the cake and make a different carmel sauce to coat the bananas. Otherwise, this dish was as pleasing to look at as it was to eat!

Picture perfect recipe and very impressive. I made one and one half times the amount of custard. Time consuming but well worth the effort.

Guests loved it but: Lots of work! Caramel tasted great(I added some orange zest)but it would not stick to bananas. Custard was bland and scant. I used Entemann's pound cake and it disolved into goo(granted it was 10 hrs later). The pear amaretto trifle is still the killer play!

I know other reviewers liked this recipe, but I thought it was very short on custard, for one thing. I also thought that the "caramel" was pretty bland and basically contributed about as much as sugar water.

Very, very good. It is a keeper, I made it with the cappuccino fudge cheesecake that was not very good.

My husband is from Bermuda and this is a dish he would have as a child. I surprised him with it for his birthday and he was blown away. Takes a while to prepare, but if you're short on time, you can cheat with store bought cake and custard. Definitely a recommend.

This is the most delicious trifle! It really impresses everyone. When I'm cramped for time I just use store bought butter loaf cake instead of making the sponge cake. It still tastes wonderful. I've tried it with blueberries and raspberries as well.

Absolutely worth all the work. Originally made this last X-mas to impress my mother-in-law, what a hit - looked and tasted great. This year I am not making my own cake base, didn't make much of a taste difference at all. This is a must try recipe.
