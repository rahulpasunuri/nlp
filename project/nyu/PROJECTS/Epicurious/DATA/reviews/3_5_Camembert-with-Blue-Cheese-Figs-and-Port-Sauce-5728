To make this cheaper and quicker, I simply warmed the Camembert in the microwave, and made the port-fig sauce to pour over top. It was great. I feel bad about reviewing it when I made so many changes, but I wanted everyone to know that the sauce is excellent.

Good - not great.

This was so yummy...the combinations of flavours was perfect. I strongly recommend service as a cheese course after the meal and not as an appetizer. Also serve with french toasts made from baguette and not crackers as the cheese gets melty and needs a place to go.

I served this to a friend who doesn't like camembert or brie and she loved this. Fantastic and easy. The only glitch was that my cheese didn't melt enough in the pan and would have burned if left in longer. I simply tossed it in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. It came out perfectly.

I've made this for each of the last 4 Thanksgivings. It was highly acclaimed in both taste and presentation. It is messy but workable.

I served this along with a variety of other cheeses and crackers for Christmas hors' doevres. After tasting this, no-one really wanted the other cheeses. I used a really good, pretty strong aged Camembert. The contrast of that richness with the figs and Port was truly amazing. The blue cheese didn't make a strong flavor impact, but it did give it a bit of "zong". We ate it on water crackers instead of toasted baguette. It's not very pretty, but it is elegant. We cut it into wedges to serve, but it was still quite messy. No-one cared though; this was my husbands absolute favorite Christmas dish.

While I liked (but didn't love) the taste, I felt that the look was not as pretty as expected and it was a huge mess to eat (despite cutting the figs into smaller pieces). Frying the cheese was a nice technique that I will use in other ways, although I thought it was unnecessary here with the heavy fig topping.

Served this at a gourmet supper club, French cuisine dinner, a BIG hit. Wonderful mixture of flavors. Its a real winner.

Great recipe. Is there something non-alcoholic that could substitute for the port?

This is a fantastic dish with incredible flavors, although it's hard to find a wine to pair with it. We actually served it with a vintage port, making it a hard act to follow. Next time we make it (tomorrow night) we'll serve it after the main course as part of the cheese course with port just before dessert.

Superb, easy appetizer! Got rave reviews at a dinner party. I used caution when heating in the skillet (and had brought cheese to room temp before) but the rind held the cheese in perfectly, no burning. The combo of flavors is wonderful. I may have boiled the port too long - it was a very thick syrup - but not a problem once re-heated and poured over cheese in the end. Also I cut figs into about 6 pieces each (using scissors, goes by in a snap) for easier eating. I had some extra figs that just wouldn't fit on the cheese. Try this one!

This dish was so simple to make. Yet it is one of the best appetizers I have ever served. It is also a nice presentation. The cheese was all melty. The port sauce, figs and blue cheese were the perfect accompaniment. This dish will never go unfinished. It really is to die for.

This appetizer was a huge hit ("awesome", "to die for", etc.) The port sauce with the figs and blue cheese was exquisite. But use caution when heating the camembert - I used a heavy skillet on medium-high heat (as called for in the recipe) and in less than two minutes the bottom was terribly burnt! Fortunately, I doubled the recipe and the second one turned out better.

I thought this dish was wonderful. I made it for New Year's Eve, and the group ate every last bite. It was very easy as well. However, I recommend cutting the figs into slightly smaller pieces, perhaps quartered long-ways instead of halved. You'll need to re-warm figs and sauce if you make is ahead of time.
