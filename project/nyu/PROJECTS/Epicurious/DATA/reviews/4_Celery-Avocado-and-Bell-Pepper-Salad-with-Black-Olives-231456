I made this pretty much as described except I cut the celery and pepper a bit smaller (also cut olives in quarters instead of 1/2's) and used a whole large avocado. An excellent, easy fast salad.

wonderful salad and very quick to make. I added some cherry tomatoes and it worked as well.

Super easy, fresh, and flavorful. Will make again!

I liked the way the combination of flavours covered up the taste of celery, which I don't like as much as other stuff. Very refreshing although you have to eat all at once as avocado turns dark after a while. Nice colourful salad. Will make again.
