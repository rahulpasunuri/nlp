If you're desperate to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey, this'll do. Not a terrible enchilada, but far from the best I've ever had. More cheese, maybe? I did like the flair that the peppers added.

In my opinion, this was awful. I would not recommend it nor would I make it again.

Excellent recipe! We modified it a bit as follows: Removed seeds from chilis; added slice olives and diced green chilis; and used spicy Monterey Jack Cheese. It was terrific!

This was a very easy and delicious way to finish our Thanksgiving turkey. A warning, the chili's in adobe were very hot. If you are not that brave discard the seeds before cooking.

This was a great base recipe to use up half of our leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. It's as spicy and developed as you want to make it.

When I did eat meat and dairy, this is the most delicious of all enchiladas I ever had. I am now a Vegan, which is the only reason why I would not make this recipe again. (I have however made, and ate the enchiladas about 3 times!) I reccomend this recipe to meat and dairy lovers!

We make this dish all the time. I use a purchased rotisserie chicken and follow the rest of the recipe as-is. It's a great weeknight dish that's quick to put together and easy to keep all the ingredients on hand.

Made this dish after Thanksgiving with leftover turkey. Delicious. We made it for a group of friends and they raved on and on about it! I even made a cilantro oil to decorate the plates with! It was beautiful!

Made this last night and it was wonderful. Fiance and I love hot and spicy foods and this turned out better than we had expected. Definitely have to be a fan of spicy foods to like this one. It had such great flavor too! Will make again!!

Just so-so...there must be a better enchilada recipe out there.

Use Las Palmas brand Enchilada soauce or Hatch. They are superior to the other brands. Dip the corn tortillas in hot oil for a moment to soften. I know it adds those bad fat calories, but it makes for better enchiladas. I prefer cheese (asadero or Jack) to turkey.

These were excellent enchiladas, as enchiladas go. Be careful of the chipotle in adobe sauce, as it is VERY HOT. (I used about 3/4 of what the recipe calls for, and it was plenty hot.) Since I don't have an oven-proof skillet, I sauteed the onion in a little olive oil in a saucepan, and then added the enchilada sauce, cilantro, and chipotle pepper. Cooked the sauce for a little while, and then spooned some of it into the bottom of a casserole dish that had been sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Also added a bit of the sauce to the meat/onion mixture (as it seemed too dry). After adding the rolled up tortillas to the dish, spooned the rest of the sauce over them, along with the remaining bell pepper. Baked, covered, for about 30 minutes in a 375 degree oven. Uncovered the dish, added the cheese, and baked about 5 minutes more. Yum, yum!!!
