This was a easy to make. I had two pints of sour cherries which yielded approximately 2 cups so I had to halve this recipe. Based on reading other sour cherry recipes, I added lemon juice (maybe 1/2 teaspoon?) and some lemon zest just to perk it up. In the end, I mixed it with some seltzer to make refreshing sour cherry soda.
