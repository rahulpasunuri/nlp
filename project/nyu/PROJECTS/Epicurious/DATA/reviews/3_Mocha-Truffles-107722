Disappointing. I had hoped for an easier recipe than my "traditional" truffle recipe. Too many variables, e.g.., microwave strength and temperatures of ingredients. The chocolate (good Callebaut) never got smooth before it began to scorch; the butter didn't soften before melting, and didn't blend evenly (little globs of butter in the finished product); the resulting texture was uneven, so couldn't make the ganache into nice round truffles. Mine looked like Silly Putty morels. Flavor's not bad, though.

These truffles are delicious. I rolled them is about 5 different ground chocolates and nuts. You need to make sure that you keep them in the fridge at all times, and roll them a few at a time. They are absolutly the best piece I chocolate I think I have had.

It didn't set up so I would reduce the amount of cream. It was delicious though and my husband ate the whole batch with a spoon......
