Really like this. Suggest using more broth / stock instead of the water as previous review recommends. If you aren't serving it with anything else. I served this with the chickpea stew instead of bread. And it was great.

My 1st time cooking whole buckwheat - what a delicious dish! I spent a little more time on the onions until they carmelized. Used 2 cups chicken broth instead of the broth/water combo. The yogurt was intregal and enhanced the flavors.

despite the good reviews, i had pretty low expectations for this dish. on top of that, when i went to chop the vegetables i realized i had forgotten to buy zucchini, and had to use carrots instead. but in the end it was fantastic! really tasty - seriously. the yogurt sounded totally bizarre, but i gave it a shot and it's a great compliment. don't skip that.

I made it vegan, without any broth and using an egg substitute. At first taste I didn't like it--I felt like it was totally lacking in flavor (probably due to the lack of broth). But slowly the buckwheat started to take over, and it got addicting. The veggies turned out to be a good complement. So ultimately it worked out great!

Sorry, forgot to note what the flax meal is a substitute for: egg!

I love this and have made it at least five times. Have used both whole and medium kasha, and I think I prefer medium. My husband and son both thought it was a little bland the first time, probably because they both love salt. I usually add a little extra garlic and onion now. I've also made it for vegan friends by substituting prepared flax meal (google dana sly for procedure), and that was delish, too.

This is delicious, made exactly according to the recipe. Be sure to serve with yogurt - it's a really nice touch.

I'd never made kasha before, and was pleasantly surprised. Very easy and very tasty (although next time I might add more vegetables, and different kinds, too). I used medium kasha, not whole, and it was fine.
