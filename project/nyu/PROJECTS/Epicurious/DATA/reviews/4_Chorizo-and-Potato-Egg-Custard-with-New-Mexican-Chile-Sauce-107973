I am betting you could simply break eggs over the potato/sauce base and bake them until set like huevos rancheros. It might save considerable fat and moisture migration.

A great brunch dish. I made this in a 9"x13" glass pan and it cooked in the stated time, about 40 minutes. I followed the recommendations of the cook from San Antonio del Mar on the salsa -- really good stuff.

Fabulous! So easy to make! I made two recipes of the New Mexican chile sauce; one entire recipe was used on the dish and the other was available on the side. It did require that I cook it for 65 minutes which islonger than the recipe stated. Deliciosas!

This dish took considerably longer than indicated to bake. I think 1 cup of the sauce in the dish led to excessive liquid, and hence the longer cooking time. If you're using true spanish chorizo, a little goes a long way. I did not fry the chiles as mentioned by the other reviewers, and thought the sauce was fine. I used the leftover sauce to flavor some rice and veges for our next meal.

A note to Grand Duchy --- For a vegetarian version you may wish to try Soyrizo. It's a wonderful meat substitute and really resembles chorizo.

This was great. However, the reviewer below was correct - you do need to soak the chilies. And I also "fried" the sauce after blending. However, this was a yummy and unusual dish. I will next try a vegetarian version, substituting mixed "sweet" (yellow, red, green) peppers for the chorizo. Perfect Sunday night supper dish. Or brunch.

For the sauce, the chiles should be soaked in hot water for about 15 minutes after toasting. Add 1/4 onion and it won't be necessary to use stewed tomatoes. I would also use guajillo chiles if you can find them. If you have the time and can afford the fat, fry this sauce in about 2 TB oil for about 5 minutes, then lower the heat and cook for another 10 minutes. The sauce will have considerably more flavor. I've never heard of a sauce like this that wasn't fried,I'm betting they omitted that step to save time. Otherwise, this looks yummy, I'm going to make it for brunch.
