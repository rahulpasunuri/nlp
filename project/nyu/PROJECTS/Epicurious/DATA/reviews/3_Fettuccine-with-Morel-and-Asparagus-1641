My first time cooking with Morels. It's a good recipe if you're exploring morel dishes. I used small black morels. Not as flavorful, as other colors, but it came out very good. The chicken broth was a little strong, so be mindful of strength of your broth. I would use 1 1/2 teaspoon of dried tarragon instead. This dish can come out salty with the broth and cheese. So use low sodium chicken stock, and salt afterwards for better control. The dish came out heavy, and I would instead 2 tbs of olive oil, and 1 tbs of butter for the saute. I would also consider using half-half instead. All in all a good recipe if you can find the Morels.

I made this recipe with monster morels that have been growing in my flower beds this year. If you have the option, use white morels, not black, - they have more flavor. I made the recipe as given, with two exceptions - I doubled the tarragon (mine has been in the cupboard for longer than I care to admit and has lost of lot of zing) and I used brandy instead of the chicken broth. It was incredible! The meaty mushrooms and the crisp asparagus are such great textural contrasts and the flavors meld beautifully. My husband, who usually feels deprived when eating a meatless meal, loved it and asked me to make it again. As for the thickening issue - this is not a sauce that is supposed to be gluey. It should be thick enough to coat the back of spoon - if you boil it down hard to that point it will coat the pasta beautifully. I'll be making this till my morels run out!

We finally got back home around 8:00 PM to get to the task of cooking this recipe. While I cleaned and trimmed and patted my daughter mixed up a batch of martini's, because we thought it would be nice to have some of the smaller ones in a martini. I sauteed some green onions, fresh from the garden mind you, in some oleo. Because we forgot to get the other ingredients, too much time spent finding these mushrooms, I had to substitute 1 cup dry vermouth for the chicken broth and wine. I have to tell you, the mushrooms smelled fantastic as they simmered! As we had no goat cheese we used two packets of cheese mix from some macaroni and cheese in the box, following directions on how to prepare the cheese sauce from the box. We skipped the asparagus and used one package of frozen green beans. I used the green parts from some more green onions in place of chives as they taste the same anyway. Meanwhile, we prepared the macaroni, we had no fettuccine either, as the box instructions stated. When the pasta was done we completed the recipe as directed by tossing the pasta with the sauce. The dish tasted like a funny version of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, so we spiced it up a bit with some red paper flakes. The red pepper flakes made all the difference in the world and we both found it to be quite pleasing and the little mushrooms were splendid as a garnish to our martinis. I would suggest maybe using feta cheese next time and to save the time it takes to find morels maybe use button mushrooms instead.

I had never eaten morels in my life before this, but for years now I've had to listen to this clown at work go on and on and on about morel mushrooms every spring. I mean this jerk just can't seem to get off the subject of morels this time of year. So I decide to see for myself what this was all about. After spending many hours at work searching the internet to learn about the how's, where's, and when's about finding these damn things, me and my daughter set off into to the woods this past weekend. After about 2 hours of searching we finally found six nice sized musrooms, gross little things they are. We followed the instructions and washed and patted and trimmed and too our dismay we were well short of the required half pound. Now my daughter and I don't care much for mushrooms other than pickled mushrooms for martini's, so before heading back out into the woods we decided to try these to make sure we would like them. So I fried up one in some oleo until it was almost crispy, sprinkled it with a little salt and pepper, and WOW, it tasted great. Then my daughter wanted to try too, so I decided to cook up three more and we both ate those and agreed it would be worth it to go look for more, especially seeing as now we only had two left, so we ate those too before leaving. It took us another five hours to find what we thought would be a whole pound, certainly enough for this recipe I thought.

Oh please! Stop substituting morels with mushrooms! Its just not the same. Its like replacing summer sunshine with a light bulb.

Oh my God, fresh morels are amazingly expensive, but I bought some at the farmers market yesterday and looked up a recipe (never having had the luxury of having fresh morels in my possession before). I made this recipe with only 4 ounces of morels and it was amazingly good. If there are morels next week I will use even more and do this again. It is really easy. I used fresh pasta also which I thought was essential since I had made the big investment in morels. This is going to be my annual spring dish if morels continue to show up at the farmers market.

Fresh morels and asparagus were at the farmer's market this week so was pleased to find this recipe using both. I made it using the called-for ingredients plus added some sliced chicken breast. It was delicious, nice blend of flavors. My only problem was that the sauce did not thicken very much. Otherwise very good.

I used regular mushrooms instead of morels and Asiago instead of Parmesan, to rave reviews from my husband. He even took the leftovers for lunch, which is completely unprecedented. I'll make it again, although I found it somewhat boring ... will try to spruce it up a bit, perhaps by throwing in some rehydrated porcinis with the mushrooms and being liberal with the black pepper. But anything which is eaten with that much enthusiasm the next day deserves a repeat performance, as far as I'm concerned.

Perhaps it's not fair to complain about this recipe since...I used half and half because I thought our arteries would explode otherwise, and I used just regular mushrooms, and no vegetable broth. I simmered the sauce a long time to try to reduce it, but without luck. But miracle of miracles, my daughter who eats asparagus (and not mushrooms) liked it, after picking out the mushrooms, and my son who likes mushrooms, but not asparagus, liked it, after picking out the asparagus. I thought it was too bland. Maybe, that's why the kids liked it!

Everything was fresh that I used; we had foraged for the morels, the asparagus was from our garden as was the tarragon. The cream was from a local dairy. I did add one shallot and 1\4 cup of white wine. I reduced the sauce more than 4 minutes.My family loved the dish.

Although this dish sounds scrump-deli-umpcious I recently made it for some friends and the sauce was disappointingly thin and the flavor rather bland. It could definitely use some punch!

This recipe sounds delicious, but it's a cholesterol gut-bomb! I'll have to wait 'til I feel like I can splurge to try it.
