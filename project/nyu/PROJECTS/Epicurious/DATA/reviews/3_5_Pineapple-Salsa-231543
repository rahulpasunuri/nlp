I made this last week and used it on grilled fresh salmon. The pineapple was fresh from the store and the jalapeno and mint were out of the garden. Great summer topping for fish.

I made this last night and served with the grilled pound cake as suggested on this site.I forgot to get the fresh jalapenos at the store so I minced jarred slices that I had on hand. They worked just fine, but will try the real thing next time.

I make this salsa as directed as a desert topping. Other times I make it without the sugar for savory dishes. I add two or three chopped apricots - fresh or reconstituted dried. Also some finely chopped red pepper along with the 2-3 jalapenos. Maybe some finely chopped shallots. And cilantro. Serve with grilled poultry or pork.

Delicious. I used unsweetened canned pineapple chunks without incident. I paired this with pork loin and it was a huge hot.
