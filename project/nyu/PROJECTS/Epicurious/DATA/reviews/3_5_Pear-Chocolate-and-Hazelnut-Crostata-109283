I agree, this crust is to die for. But I found it dry, and hesitated to use more liquid or suffer the consequences of a tought dough. My pears were not ripe enough, so they didn't produce enough juice. I followed other's suggestion and put the chocolate on the bottom, not enough for me! I will add it on top as well next time.

Made for Thanksgiving to showcase some local goodies. The crust was so easy and came out great, although I received my annual hand injury when the brand new food processor blade sliced BENEATH my fingernail and up through the nail. Lovely. But overall, the tart was a bit lackluster, not quite what I was expecting. Something tasted stale about it like the flavors didn't quite fit, and I didn't feel the pears stood up to the chocolate very well, even though I love pairing pears with chocolate. Would I make again...???

Great and easy recipe with excellent results. I used half the sugar, only bittersweet chocolate and put it on first (before the pears). The salt adds a nice touch.

Fabulous! The combination of flavors and textures is superb. It is a "rustic" style tart and fairly easy to make, but the results are quite sophisticated.

This is a great quick and easy dessert. I made it for an Italian themed dinner party, and it was a huge hit. I put the chocolate on first, rather than sprinkle it on at the end. I will certainly make this again.

I wasn't too crazy about this dish. If I were to do this again, I'd use only the semi-sweet chocolate and put the chocolate on the bottom. The milk cholocate tasted flat and funny in comparesin to the semi-sweet and how it melted on the top rather than the bottom make for an unattractive presentation. The crust was fantastic though!

Fantastic and so simple. My only change was to use 2/3rd of a chopped cadbury dark chocolate and 2/3rds of a chopped milk chocolate bar (chocolate lovers in the house). We omitted the sugar but kept the salt. Delish.

This recipe was a big hit at the dinner party I had last night. The combination of pears, hazelnuts and chocolate is wonderful.

This was really easy and really good. The crust was easy to work with. I traced a 14" circle in pencil on the reverse of the parchment to make sure I rolled it out enough. Guests really liked it.

A truly outstanding recipe. The combination of the pears, chocolate and hazelnut is superb. I could only use 2-3 of the pears on my tart; maybe I didn't roll out the crust out thin enough. I found the dough a little stiff to work with (maybe needed more cream or ice water) but the texture and taste of the tart crust superior. I also used half the amount of raw sugar called for and it was plenty. Do add the small sprinkling of sea salt before baking; it adds a subtle and surprising difference in flavor.
