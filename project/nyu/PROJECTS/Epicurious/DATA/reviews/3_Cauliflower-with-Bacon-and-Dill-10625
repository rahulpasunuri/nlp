I added some lemon basil to my dill for a little extra kick. It's a nice way to do cauliflower. I'll definitely make it again.

I think it was good but I forgot to add pepper, so it was definetely missing. I also think that next time I will add more lemon juice, as it added nice flavor to it.and I would think of adding some more herbs
