This is a very nice recipe and I'll definitely make it again. I made some changes (of course). We had eaten at a seafood restaurant the night before and had left over crayfish and crab claws so I used them instead of the King Crab Legs. I also used the crayfish shells (and heads) in the stock which made it much more flavorful. I agree with the previous reviewer who said that King Crab is just weird in a Cajun recipe--Blue Crab is much more traditional. I also had some Andouille sausage that was meant for Hoppin' John that never got made. I added a little of the sausage to the gumbo and left out the cayenne since the sausage added plenty of fire on its own. This took longer to make than the recipe indicated--closer to 45 minutes to get the roux the right color (the good news is that you don't really have to stir "constantly", just very often till you get to the end when you do have to stir a lot). And the stock wasn't quite enough to make the gumbo soupy, I had to add some chicken stock towards the end. But this tasted great. My husband opined that it was much better than the $60 restaurant seafood meal that contributed to the ingredients. This recipe is a keeper.

( Next time I'll add some okra to make it a bit more authentic and maybe use a substitute for the king crab.

It's been years since I've made a gumbo, but I've been in the mood since reading more than one article in the days leading up to Mardi Gras. So rather than just knowing how to put one together, I came to Epicurious for a recipe. *Ratings Disclaimer* I did tweak this recipe, with what is likely substantial flavor change. That being said, it's one of the best new things I've cooked in a long time. My changes: I used our local Dungeness crab, added one sliced and fried andouille sausage, 2 t. of Creole Seasoning (see recipe here on Epicurious), and about a cup of frozen okra slices (at the end, with the shrimp). I omitted the scallion greens. I took about 45 minutes to cook the roux to the desired color-another recipe said it should be the color of cocoa. Bon appetit!

This recipe would be much better if it had okra, garlic and parsley in it. Frozen okra will do fine but the garlic and parsley has to be fresh. Also lake crabs (blue crabs) would also be better than the king crabs. Fresh hot pepper makes it tangy also.

Found this quite bland so I added 1 teaspoon celery seed, 1 teaspoon parsley flakes, and 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning. Omitted the rice and added 1 pound chopped fresh okra. Thickened as it cooled and was better the next day.

Ive made this twice, and dont think of it as a gumbo, but a delicious, light and fresh-tasting soup. I made a couple of alterations: add ½ lb of bay scallops, 2 T habanera sauce, and ½ c. chopped cilantro. A wonderful light & warming meal.

Surprisingly good and relatively quick, though I was doubtful while making it. Based on previous reviews and my own preferences, I made the following changes that I recommend: I added 1 large clove of garlic to the Cajun mirepoix and used equal parts butter and flour for the roux (I've never used oil for a roux before and didn't see the need to try it out). I added about 1/2 t of cayenne to the veggies, along with salt, white pepper, and about 1 t. (or so) of cajun seasoning. Once the roux-vegetable mix was incorporated into the shrimp stock, which I made as directed (and yes, the method of incorporation is a bit off as written, but it still turns out just fine), I added one 10 oz. can of undrained Rotel tomatoes in lieu of the recommended whole tomatoes and did not add rice. After about 10 minutes or so of simmering, I added 1 lb. of fresh jumbo lump crabmeat, 2 lb. of deveined large Gulf shrimp and about 1 lb. of browned andouille sausage. After the shrimp was cooked (about 3 minutes), I added the scallions, 2 t. of file powder and a little more salt and pepper before serving over white rice. This was quite good the first day and fabulous the next two days - I will definitely make it one day ahead next time.

This is our new favorite gumbo recipe. From other comments, I used fake crab and spicy andouille sausage, which was wonderful. I also added ground red chile for heat.

time consuming but delicious. I used sausage instead of crab to save money, and added hot sauce and red chili peppers. Very nice..

Delicious!!! Great the next day. Made this a few times before. I'm going to make this again for Christmas this year to go with my "seafood" theme, but i'll be adding cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning, smoked sausage, and imitation crabmeat.

I added stewed tomatoes instead of plain canned. No Roux, too much work. Just added minced garlic, and ground cayenne pepper. The rice needs to cook longer than recipe states and needs more water if you leave out the cooking of the crab part.. Left out the crab legs, and added canned blue crab at the end. I think I actually have a different recipe now....Good.

I used a can of tomatoes with chilis (rotel) instead of drained canned tomatoes. It pumped up the flavor. No rice. Added frozen cut okra towards end. It was flavorful (agree best made ahead)and spicy enough for me. My husband added a little asian chili&garlic sauce to spice his a little more. This is a relatively easy and tasty gumbo!

Made the recipe as written and added approximately 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper plus salt and black pepper. No complaints about lack of flavor at my house. I did make a day ahead(more time to stir a roux on the weekend) and served the next day so perhaps the flavors had more time to blend but my family thought this gumbo was delicious and I will definitely be making it again.

An unbelievably bland dish ~~ added garlic salt, white wine, Worchestershire sauce (ala Emeril) and it still was a good waste of shrimp and crab. The recipe was discarded after dinner!

This recipe is a good start if you ADD MORE SPICES. I also cheat and use canned lump crabmeat and shrimp that is already shelled and it doesn't seem to make a difference. I just add both for the last 5-10 minutes of simmering. I also include a good deal of garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and cajun seasoning. That makes all the difference. Great served with cornbread.

I don't get it. Usually I totally agree with other reviewers. This was a lot of work (who wants to stand in front of a stove stirring a rioux for 30+ minutes?) In the end, I did a lot of doctoring with spices to get something that had a little flavor. I was very disappointed. A good waste of shellfish!

My family loved this dish! Held back a bit on the hot spices but put a bottle of hot sauce on the table for each to spice to their own tastes. Definately better the next day.

I just made this dish last week and I have to say it was quite wonderful. I seasoned w/ more herbs and healthy dose of salt and added a bit of sausage and the consistency was just right. Will defeintely make this again. I added cumin, thyme, basil, creole seasoing, whole peppercorns, and gumbo file. My boyfriend said it was the best dish I have ever made.

Dish is delicious but needs additional seasoning as recommended by previous reviewers - I used Creole seasoning (to taste) plus added File powder (1 Tbl.) just before serving which created a beautiful color and texture. Substituted king crab with fresh crab meat (plastic jar in seafood dept) and cooked same time as shrimp which reduced overall cooking time.

I made minor changes of the ingredients listed to my taste. The major changes were: Gumbo file, 2 tsp and I also added 1# sliced smoked sausage (browned to get rid of some of the fat). This was a fantastic gumgo! Regarding those who have written that it is not spicy enough, the recipe does state: cayenne pepper to taste. I used a lttle less than 1 tsp. The whole family loved this gumbo! will defintely make again.

This recipe was delicious. It was even better the next day. It's alittle bland but my boyfriend loved it that way. I prefer it spicer so I added some hot sauce to my serving olny. It was perfect. I would make this one again.

I've made this multiple times. Its still a big favorite with everyone. I'm making it for the superbowl this time. I usually add red pepper and tobasco to spice it up. I've also added a white fish in the past which gives it a little more fish flavor. I agree though with the other writer, this can get to be an expensive "soup" especially if you double or triple the recipe for a party! It can also take a fair amount of time - two hours at least- to get it all done. Still worth it though!!

Definite "keeper"--but as others suggest NEEDS some "kick" to make it right. I opted not to use pricey king crab. I had some littlenecks (small clams)used the broth & chopped them slightly. Also tossed in some chunks of imitation crabmeat as well as some regular crab (blueclaw type). I used to cringe at thought of "fake" crab--but I look at it like additional "seafood" flavoring with some bulk to it (besides being cheaper, it was on sale!)Afterall, it is a fish product. I know this soup is "on" because my husband actually got some out & reheated it on his own--he is not a "soup person" at all!

This gumbo was a roaring hit. Delicious. Since I live in the Bay Area, I substituted fresh, local, Dungeness Crab for the Alaskan King Crab legs and I think that really added some richness. I also added filet, as so many previous reviewers recommended. This made a spicy and remarkable entree (though with the pre-cracked crab, it ended up being an $80 soup!!)

I'd definitely make this again -- if I had plenty of seasonings on hand. This would be terribly bland as written. I added a few heaping teaspoons of Creole seasoning, salt, pepper and a few generous shakes of Tabasco. After that, it was delicious. My husband, the hot sauce king, loved it.
