Absolutely delicious blend of flavors: tart cherries, spicy cinnamon, earthy spinach, and buttery scallops. I also cut down the on the amount of butter and everything turned out fine. Pureed parsnips also work lovely in lieu of the cauliflower.

Being a chef (but only in my own kitchen!), I love to try interesting combinations to see if the flavors blend well. The capers and cherries were absolutely delicious with the scallops, but I took the advice of a previous reviewer and cut back the butter. I also loved the cinnamon on the cauliflower because it complimented the sweetness of the cherries while also allowing the caper flavors to pop. Highly recommend!

The cauliflower and spinach was a hit, but there were just too many flavors going on with the scallops. If it had just had either the capers or the cherries it would have been much better.

I like to try unusual combinations because they may turn out to be surprisingly good. In this case, the combination of flavors is odd and unpleasant. Cinnamon and cauliflower don't work together.

I am a novice in the kitchen and wanted to try something with scallops and spinach. I found this recipe and listened to others advice about using a little less butter-I actually used about 1/2. I also subsituted the cherries with cranberries that I had and it was delicious! I just didn't taste the sage too much-not sure if I didn't add enough or if I missed something in the steps. I look forward to making it again!

I made this for a large dinner party, and doubled the scallops to make it a main course instead of an appetizer. Everyone loved it, and there wasn't a bit leftover. I will definitely make it again.

I made this (and a couple of the other recipes from the collection) for a dinner party. Everyone raved about it. The flavours were unique and interesting and they complimented one another beautifully. No changes necessary, though I do agree that it could be made with a little less butter. I will definitely make it again!

My husband nearly died when he tried this recipe. We both absolutely loved it. I personally would reduce the amount of butter next time I make it... I think making it a thicker sauce, and less oily, would be nice. Then again, the butteriness with the scallops is what my husband loved :)

Loved it. The array of flavors was excellent and I will definitely be making this again. I made the recipe as it and would not leave out any ingredients, especially the capers. They mellow out when you cook them yet still adds depth.

This was a surprising delicious combination of flavors. The scallops were not overpowered by the other ingredients

I was very impressed with the range, and depth, of flavors in this dish. I find it difficult to judge a recipe without actually trying it. I added 1/4 cup of vegetable stock and 1 tbs brown sugar to the caper/cherry browned butter and the dish was fantastic. I will make this again for sure.

Please do not post a rating if you have not tried the recipe!! Ratings are a great feature of this site, which you destroy with unsubstantiated postings!.... We found this one to be quite unique and delicious. Will definately try it again.

This recipe was really good and very easy to make. My boyfriend does all the cooking but I thought I would give him a night off, he was truly impressed and now thinks I know my way around the kitchen. Delicious and I will make again.

My guests loved this. I didn't think the spinach added that much...perhaps I didn't get enough of the water out...but I liked you could make the cauliflower and spinach early and then the scallops and sauce last minute. Impressive, easy, and delicious.

This recipe had good flavors that worked well together. I especially liked the cherries, but could have done without the capers (I found them to distract from the overall taste). Even my picky family enjoyed this! Will definitely make again.
