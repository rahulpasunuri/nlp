I haven't made this recipe ,but it is a very odd one.Has no resemblance with the beloved Greek Christmas cookies melomakarona or phoenikia as I know them.What is strange is that Vefa Vafiadou is a very good cook and the author of some excellent cookbooks.

Yuck! Pity the Ancient Greeks and the Phoenicians if this is the best they could come up with. Terrible recipe! You get doughy, plain, sharply lemon oil-flavored deep-fried rocks (not "cookies"). The recipe produced only 20-25 "biscuits" that didn't rise in the least. Fortunately I deep fried the balls in a small pot (which worked), otherwise I would have wasted a good amount of olive and corn oil. Why does the recipe say to form the dough into cylinders? Under the circumstances, that is very difficult to do and would just create unevenly deep-fried fritters. Forming the dough into balls is easier and better, but don't bother, because not even the honey bath saves this recipe. I'm sure there are better, more refined recipes out there using honey and finely chopped nuts.
