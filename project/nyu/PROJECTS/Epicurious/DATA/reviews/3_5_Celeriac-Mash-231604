Due to its stringy nature, the celeriac was not particularly cooperative about getting pushed through my potato ricer, but it was well worth the hassle and (small) mess. I used lowfat milk instead of cream and went light on the butter. The end result was light, fluffy, healthy and uniquely delicious!

sounds divine. i usually grate celeriac raw over my salads for a unique flavor. A friend used to make a similar recipe as Celeriac Soup which was also extraordinary.

Delicious and simple. Added some roasted butternut squash to add some color and a bit more flavor. Great texture with a little whipping after mashing.

This has become one of my standard recips. It's a very good recipe with room to customize ingredients, e.g., milk or nut milk instead of cream. To the person who thought it too bitter...not sure what you're talking about, celery root is not bitter at all.

I had this in a restaurant, and greatly enjoyed it. Trying it on my own, however, proved too difficult. The flavor of this mash was far too bitter. In addition, the celery root took much, much longer than described to cook. It is very difficult to peel and cut. The texture was lumpy- but not in a good way. Not worth the trouble... or the $$$ celeriac.

I used sweet potatoes in place of white potatoes because that's what I had at hand. Accordingly, I sprinkled a bit of pumpkin pie seasoning on each serving of mash.

I cooked a "gifted" celeriac (had never cooked it before) mixed it with prepared mashed potatoes from yesterday (with more butter and cream) heated it up, and we all loved it. Gives a new twist to my "Bangers and Mash". Can't wait to try the soup! Will definately make this on Thanksgiving.

There are other celeric mash recipes on this website that are better. This one is too heavy on the celeric for our taste.

I have made other celeric mash recipes (from this site) that are better. This recipe is too heavy on the celeric. I used the butter and didn't need the cream so it wasn't as 'rich' in flavor but far more healthy.

So simple and delicious! Next time I'll add less cream (made the mash a bit too runny). Added a good amount of salt, freshly ground black pepper and finely chopped parsley. Will definitely make it again!

Really great! It's become a winter staple at our house. Sometimes I add chives and use olive oil instead of butter, maybe a little horseradish or some gorgonzola. Depends what I'm pairing it with and what I have on hand.

One of those perfect recipes, simple and delicious! A great way to introduce people to a "new" veetable.

I've been making this for years; it makes a wonderful, calorie reduced topping for shepherd's pie. Try using rutabaga, parsnip or even cauliflower in place of the celeriac.
