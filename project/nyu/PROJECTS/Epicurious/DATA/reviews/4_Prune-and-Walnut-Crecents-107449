These cookies are what the holidays are all about. They are both lovely and tasty. I adore the pastry dough and have used it with store bought prune lekvar filling when time is limited. I also top them with pearlized sugar.

Um-- why would you assume that spelling and recipe-writing have anything to do with each other? Or that the error was caused by the writer and not by an exhausted proofreader? I am a language and grammar teacher and I can tell you that spelling has nothing to do with language ability, let alone culinary ability. Having said that-- these were really great. I made them exactly as the recipe directed and loved them. Tender and great.

I didn't make this recipe because if you can't even spell the word "crescents" correctly, the recipe probably isn't correct, either.

Iused somer sweet instead of sugar.I can not have anything with sugar. These turned out excellent.It is so nice to have a recipe I can convert to use that sweetner.No problem with the recipe and they turned out very tasty. I am going to try them with other fillings.I am also going to send this on to my friend up north in Mi. so she can also make these. THANK YOU so much.
