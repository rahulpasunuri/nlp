Simply delicious! I baked this as a "trial-run" for Thanksgiving and it's a keeper! I didn't have the 5-spice powder on hand (which I thought I had), so I used pumpkin pie spice as a substitute which worked very well. I doubled the frosting recipe, which was not at all necessary. I am confident this cake will be huge hit on Thanksgiving, although there will be no leftovers!

this is a GREAT cake. We fought over the crusty outside of the cake that was cut off before putting the cake together! Definitely in the long term recipe file!! Linda Naples, FL

Moist and yummy!!! I made this cake for Thanksgiving and I am excited to make it yet again for Christmas. It was the gift that kept on giving - moist until the very last day it was around..I think the last piece was eaten 3 or 4 days after it was baked. Yes, most definitely double the frosting recipe.

I love this cake!!! For Gluten-Free people like me, sub with your own flour. I like Domata or Jules and add and extra tsp of baking powder and and extra tsp of baking soda to help rise. It will come out perfect. I've made it for 3 occasions already and everyone loved it!!!

This was an excellent recipe... it yielded more than needed and I made cupcakes with the left over. This is a crumbly cake that needs a crumb frosting coat..... even without that.. there was NO where near enough frosting to go around.. I halved a second batch and it was perfect!

This cake is delicious and a nice change from pumpkin pie. The cake is very dense and a bit on the dry side. If you do go ahead and make the 4 layers, I would suggest doubling the frosting if you want it to look like the picture. I would also double the 5 spice. Will make again!

This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving! I I made the cakes two nights ahead and wrapped them tightly in saran wrap. I was nervous about it turning out dry but it ended up being incredibly moist! I did it as a 2 layer to save on time. The frosting was out of control! This was just an overall awesome cake. It was just so easy!

The orange zested frosting was pretty awesome, but I agree with the other reviewers who said the cake was on the dry side. I was thinking that to myself as I slid it into the oven, and would have added some sunflower oil if I'd had some, but I didn't have any. Although, the dryness did help me cut it into four layers, I think.

This is a wonderful pumpkin cake that presents a nice twist with the Chinese five spice powder. At first I was skeptical, but the flavors complement the pumpkin wonderfully. I would actually double the spice next time to make sure it comes through. Also, although the orange frosting was good, I'd favor a simple cream cheese frosting with this cake.

This is a fantastic recipe, a definite keeper. I made the recipe exactly as written, the only exception is that I did not cut the two layers into four, just left it as a 2 layer cake, mostly because I am not good at slicing cake layers in half evenly. The pumpkin made the cake exceptionally moist and everyone loved it. The Chinese 5 spice powder added excellent flavor. The orange- cream cheese icing was just spectacular and I will be using that to ice other cakes.

I'd give this recipe a 3.5 star if I could, but since I can't, I thought the 3 star would be more representative because it wasn't perfect. I found the cake itself to be good, but nothing mind blowing (a bit dry - though I added a touch of canola oil learning from my carrot cake making days). I added more cinnamon, because I love cinnamon, and found the 5 spice to be quite nice. What really made this cake different was the fantastic icing. The orange peel really set this cake apart from the rest. Don't leave out the zest! It really punches up the flavour and was my favourite part of the cake.

This cake made GREAT cupcakes. Topped with candied walnuts. Received rave reviews - a common comment was that they aren't too "pumpkiny." They were super moist and not overly sweet. Nothing like a butter cake from scratch!

I loved this cake. I made it a double layer so the frosting wouldn't be too over powering. I also used organic cane sugar, and added 1/4 cup of sour cream to make up for the moisture in the brown sugar.I also added a half cup more powdered sugar to the icing because I thought it tasted a bit too buttery. I like using Chinese five spice in cakes. It adds a great flavor.

Made this cake today and I have to say that it is very, very good. Had a problem getting the layers out of the pan..well they came out perfectly, but one totally crumbled...big pieces, but crumbled, nonetheless. Fortunately, there is plenty of frosting to glue it all back together...didn't cut into 4 layers for obvious reasons. Added a bit more zest to the frosting, but that's about the only variation. The cake itself is very tender and I think the reason it fell apart on me was that it still was a bit too warm when I turned out of the baking pans. Will definitely make this one again, but it won't ever replace the pumpkin pie on the holiday table.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was delicious! I only had two eggs in the house instead of the recipe required three. Even so the cake turned out great. I would definitely make this again.

I made this for a family dinner and we loved it! I made it as cupcakes since my layer cakes never turn out as pretty as the ones in the pictures, but other than that followed the recipe to a T and they were a big hit! My 2-year old loved them, and so did my mom, my brothers, and my husband. Success! I will be making them for a work Halloween party this week as well.

Good, not great. The orange peel in the frosting is a nice touch. Nothing extraordinary here, however, a nice Fall cake that is a change from the traditional pumpkin pie.

I like this cake. The texture is good, but there is something lacking in flavor. The cake could have more spice whether by added fresh ginger or kicked up in some other way. Also, I didn't like that so much cake was lost by trimming the tops. (just seemed like a waste) Regarding the frosting, it had a soup-y consistency and could have been made well with only 1 brick of cream cheese and more confectioners' sugar. I think it would have been better received if the icing were a bit more firm and sweeter.

Excellent! I halved the recipe and made cupcakes to test and taste and baked it at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes until the toothpick came out clean when i poked the middle. I even used fat free cream cheese and skim milk. Cupcakes were very moist and delicious!

I made this recently, and it's delicious. The cake is very dense and moist - like a pound cake. The orange zest in the frosting really makes it shine. I left it in two layers instead of making it into four. I was missing the 5 spice powder so I used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. Really excellent.

I saw this recipe in this month's Bon Apetit, and couldn't wait to make it. I don't even like pumpkin that much, but for some reason this cake was calling to me. The cake was delicious- moist, with a great pumpkin and spice flavor, topped with a yummy sweet icing. Both the cake and icing were really easy to make. The cake was a big success, and even people that "don't like pumpkin" really loved it.
