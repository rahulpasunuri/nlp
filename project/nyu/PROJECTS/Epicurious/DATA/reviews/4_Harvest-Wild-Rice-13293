i don't know why so many reviewers left out the beans. i wanted this dish to feature the beans-i spent $9 on a pound of french green kidney beans. the only thing wrong with this dish is the title. it's way more about the beans than the rice. but that is NOT a bad thing! the combination of flavors in this is awesome. the cranberries are a surprise, the shitake mushrooms add tons of flavor without really being noticed, the nuts are a great texture (i substituted roasted cashews which were great) i also used veggie stock instead of chicken & it's a great vegetarian dish. top with 2 poached eggs & eat it for brekkie :-)

This should have been called "Harvest Beans and Wild Rice" as the beans were more noticable than the wild rice. Since there is no photo, I think this should be pointed out before you decide on this recipe.

This was outstanding. I too omitted the beans and used black and brown rice instead of wild.

Excellent side dish (served with pork roast with mustard caper sauce). I didn't cook the rice and beans from scratch, instead using a 12oz cryo-pak precooked wild rice and a can of canellini beans. Much faster, and still outstanding flavor. Also used packaged chopped hazelnuts (already skinned!) and just lightly toasted as is. I deglazed the leeks and mushrooms with a little wine before stirring in the rice and beans and added a little chicken stock for flavor. Next time I'll add a few more mushrooms, nuts and cranberries.

This was a terrific rice dish! Made this for Mother's Day. I omitted the beans as wild rice with beans didn't sound good to me. Even with the hassle of roasting the hazelnuts (which should NOT be omitted), this recipe will be appearing at our family gatherings many times! Except for the problematic nuts, it was really a simple but very tasty recipe.

Very good! The perfect Thanksgiving-type side. Very rustic and satisfying, with a nice blend of flavors and textures. I loved the hazelnuts, and will add more than 1/4c. next time. I also sautee'd the leeks first, and added the wild rice to this. Make sure your broth is salty enough! I sauteed the mushrooms on their own, with a smashed garlic clove and a bit of wine for moisture, and added them at the end. I had leftover flageolets on hand, and just added these in the last few minutes with now problem.

A delicious, nutty dish. I prepared as is, substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and served it with Delicata Squash and Mushroom with Thyme and a warm mixed vegetetable salad. Very tasty. I would suggest preparing this with more rice, fewer beans.

I omitted the beans and just prepared the wild rice. I sauteed the leeks, added broth, then cooked til just about done as a previous review said. I sauteed cremini mushrooms on the side then added the cooked rice, hazelnuts, and berries. Excellent with roast cornish game hens with crabapple-sage sauce.

This is one of my favorite fall-spring recipes. I love it with grilled pork tenderloin or sea bass, and have served it hot and at room temperature. It is really important not to overcook the rice. I usually cook the rice in barely simmering water, then remove from heat just when the rice is al dente and let sit to complete the cooking process. An interesting variation is to use shelled edamame instead of flageolets.

I thought this was a visually pleasing, tasty recipe. I used pecans instead of hazelnuts.

This was just ok. I thought with all those wonderful ingredients it couldn't miss, but it did. Rather dry and bland. Not bad, but I won't make it again.

Nice hearty with a fine nutty texture from the beans and hazelnuts contrasting well with the craberry. I served this with Duck l'orange and a nice polished zinfandel (Green and Red Chiles Valley 1997). Dessert was passionfruit sorbet and espresso.
