Major yum! I used bone-in chicken breasts and the texture and flavor of the chicken was perfect. I might add a bit of cumin next time for depth, and the green onion at the end was not necessary. Overall a really enjoyable dish. My only problem is: I ended up with a soup like consistency. But putting it over brown rice should be great!

This has to be one of the best recipes EVER. I added prunes and didn't use the Epazote leaves. WOW. I recommend shredding the chicken off the bone so it becomes stew-like, and then make your own burritos with the tortillas. HIGHY RECOMMENDED!

I was a little skeptical, but this ended up tasting fabulous. Loved the spice/sweet combo. I used whatever dried fruit I had on hand (apricots and peaches) and the pears weren't totally ripe, but still it was really tasty.

Very interesting flavors and a pretty dish on the table. And I lived in Mexico City for 2 years! It was very tasty with the chipotle as stated in the recipe, and for those more adventurous, even better after I added a double helping of chipotle. I should have used higher quality dried apricots. Also, when I reheated the leftovers the next day, the fruit had become predictably soggy. Still tasted great though. Maybe serve with a side of black beans. And cinnamon spiced Mexican coffee after dinner.

Delicious. The only two things I'd change are 1) remove the cover from the pot when I add the fruit or a few minutes before that. The sauce could've used a little thickening. 2) It'd be a lot healthier and just as tasty if you remove most of the chicken skin after the original browning. Finally, I'd caution you not to drive an extra 15.5 miles for the epazote. It's very, very optional.

This is a beautifully balanced dish. I have no idea why it was included in a June issue because it's a perfect winter comfort food. To the cook who only used dark meat: I know why you did it, but the white meat comes out with the same depth of flavor as dark by the end of the process. Using the chipotles liberally will push this recipe to approximate the kind of food I eat when I'm in Mexico.

To me, this tastes like a combination of Mexican and Persian flavors-- a little spicy, but also sweet and fruity. Like others, I used dark meat only and enjoyed it that way. I thought the pears were great, but will probably add slightly less dried fruit next time to cut down on the sweetness a bit and let the tomatillos come through more strongly; using dried sour cherries might also help.

This is my first recipe review, although I use Epicurious most every day and absolute love it! I just had to speak up about how great this dish is, though of necessity I made minor revisions---and I really get upset by people who change the recipe in major ways and then review and rate "their" recipe. I had 4 skinless thighs and no pears. So, I cut the volume of other ingredients by 75% and used dried fruit totally. I had a bag of mixed dried fruit including pears so I added those pears to the other dried fruit called for. Frankly, I suspect this would work well with most any dried fruit. I did have to add a little water as the sauce got a bit thick. This is one of the most interesting recipes I've found in a long time. It is intricately flavored, sour and sweet, a little picante but not too much. I'd be happy to serve this to company, with simple white rice and a salad. My partner says it needs color and suggested some fresh red pepper, maybe roasted and slivered. I would hope that this would not change the flavor too much.

This was excellent! I live in a little mountain town and couldn't get the adobo chilis, but instead sauted some jalapenos and it added just the right amount of bite. Also, served with Red Tomato Rice Recipe out of Rick Bayless' book and it was a great meal!

This dish was really good although I think it might be a little spicy for some people. I agree that the pears didn't really add much to it. Next time I think I'll try an alternative fruit, maybe underripe mango?

I made this for a party and it got rave reviews. Instead of a quartered chicken, I used skinless breast and thighs. The pears did not soften enough after 15 minutes so I added another 5 minutes of simmering.

This was great! I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. I thought the pears definitely added good flavor and texture, in contrast to what another reviewer said. Other dried fruits could work well instead of the apricots and cherries.

We halved this recipe and used dried wolf berries in lieu of dried cherries; it was outstandingly good.

I agree with the first reviewer that the pears didn't add very much. I think next time I would add more chipotle and try to dig around the latin markets for some epazote. The chicken was very moist and falling off the bone. I served it with minted rice.

I made this dish with a pork tenderloin cooking at a higher temperature than was recommended, but it still turned out very well. The pears didn't seem to add much, but the apricots and cherries were marvelous.
