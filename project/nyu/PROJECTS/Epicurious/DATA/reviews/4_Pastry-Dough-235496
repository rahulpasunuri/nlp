It really doesn't need the vegetable shortening, so if you're trying to avoid trans fats, go ahead and go all butter-- Pate Brisee. Love this. Works well with apples or other fruit, too.

Interestingly enough, I have never found a truly trans-fat free (non-hydrogenated) shortening. Some will be labeled "non-hydrogenated," however what they really mean is 'made with non-hyrogenated oil.' What they then do is change the chemical structure of the oil (hydrogenate) - making it into shortening.

I've been looking for a perfect pastry dough recipe using trans-fat- free shortening and THIS IS IT!!! This pastry dough came out perfect--- came together easily and rolled out just fine(staying together especially when transferring from work surface to pie plate and crimping edges);it has a good flavor and also nice texture. I've tried several pie dough recipes which called for regular shortening, and substituted trans-fat free shortening and could never find a recipe that tasted good and held together properly, until now!! This time I used it for pumpkin pie, but I'm going to use this for all my pies! I used Crisco trans-fat free vegetable shortening.(only change was that since I used a wide bowl to mix the dough, I did the procedure of separating the dough into four pieces and pressing, right in the extra wide bowl--seemed to save some time and work!). Thanks also to the cook who gave a very detailed description of how the dough should look and be handled at different stages --I found that to be very helpful!!

In answer to the question from the cook from Amsterdam, I use Crisco (solid), but I suppose any solid vegetable shortening would do.

I did not make yet this pie, because I need to know which vegetable shortening trans- fat-free is used.Can somebody help? Thanks.

My family says this is my best pie crust. I do find that I need to add quite a bit more water than called for, but be careful to add in small amounts till the right texture is reached.

This is very similar to my own personal "best" pie dough recipe. The "standard" pie crust recipe calls for 5 1/3 Tbs. of fat to 1 cup of flour. This one calls for 6.4 Tbs. of fat to 1 c. which is just about the same as the 6.5 Tbs. I worked out on my own. It makes a richer crust that is not TOO rich or too soft. If you use more shortening, the crust is flakier but not as "buttery" tasting. To A Cook from California: it sounds to me like you did not use enough water. The amount of water needed to make a pie crust varies a LOT, depending on how much moisture the flour has absorbed from the air. I think it's the trickiest part of pie-crust making. Here's how I do it: I mix the dough in a food processor, but dump it out into a bowl before adding liquid. It's harder to control how the dough comes together in the food processor. Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the dough and mix together with a fork or spatula, gently. Continue adding water about 1 Tbs. at a time until most of the dough is sticking together, but you still have some dry "crumbs" left. Gently bring the dough together with your hands and gently press together to incorporate. Work quickly so the heat of your hands doesn't melt the butter & shortening. The dough should not be dry and crumbly. It's O.K. if it's just a little bit sticky, but it shouldn't be really, really sticky. Be sure to chill the dough well for at least an hour before rolling out. If you have trouble with your piecrust being a bit tough, try to handle it less, or substitute some pastry flour. Using 2/3 c. unbleached all-purpose flour and 1/3 c. pastry flour instead of 1 c. all-purpose works well for me.

This is a keeper! Made for a dinner party, and it got rave reviews. Great presentation and not difficult to make. Highly recommend trying; I'll be making it again.

This was my first attempt at making my own pie dough and I found it very easy and it turned out wonderful (I made the plum galette and a peach pie with it and the crust came out perfect -not soggy - even though my peaches were very juicy) . I guess I can't compare to other recipes but I would definitely recommend this recipe.

This was--hands down--the WORST pie crust I've made in a long time. I give it a big zero. It separated, fell apart, cracked an now way would it support the fruit. I made it ahead thinking today would be an easy prep and had to throw it away after two attempts to roll it into something that would work. I'm a pretty good pastry chef-this doesn't usually happen. I just dragged out my old Julia Child baking cookbook for her galette dough recipe--it's chilling in my refrigerator now. but I'm still burning! I
