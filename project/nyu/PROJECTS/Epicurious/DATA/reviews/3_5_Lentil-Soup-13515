I agree with the Cook from San Francisco. I add a little red wine too--just a splash. I think this is the best lentil soup, outside of my oldest recipe from Moosewood Kitchen.

I am not a big fan of lentil soup, but this was easy, tasty and healthy; I'll make it again soon.

I'm puzzled by the negative reviews. The first time I made it, I liked it so much that I never bothered to read them. I've made this frequently over the last 5 or 6 years, with one major change. One cup lentils instead of 1/2 cup. Usually red lentils. Everyone I've served it to has been complimentary, and obviously I like it a lot. Four forks for me!

This is a really delicious lentil soup recipe that I keep coming back too. I took on board the suggestions of the lady from San Francisco, which give it a little more oomph! It's easy to adjust depending on how much garlic & onion you like, or what herbs you have to hand. The balsamic vinegar & roasted peppers lend just the right amount of sweetness.

This is the worst lentil soup recipe I have ever made! It was way too salty.

The flavors in this soup are not interesting and just didn't meld. The Curried Lentil soup with Minted Yogurt that is posted on this website is much better and much more unique. I'll stick to that one.

A large pot on the stove as we speak! My darling and I are in our late 80's, so we've had a lot of lentils with various ingredients. Because I like lots of leftovers -- saves an old lade from having to cook every day -- we use 2# lentils, well washed. I washed them, put them in the pot with 5 c. can chicken stock, brought it to a boil, turned it off to soak an hour. Sauteed a thinly sliced onion to almost caramel, added 4 cloves crushed garlic separately & dumped it in, added a few crushed pepper flakes and a dusting of thyme and let it go. It has cooked over an hour, and will add a can of Italian-style stewed tomatoes. Everybody enjoy!

I liked this recipe well enough that I would make it again with some changes. I wouldn't add as much roasted red pepper and I would use my own fresh vegetable or chicken stock.

This is a good standard lentil soup recipe, but the addition of roasted peppers makes it a bit different. I added herbs (thanks, other reviewers!)and a splash of white wine to the sauteed vegetables. Heeding the comments of reviewers for this and other lentil soup recipes about the lengthy time for cooking lentils, I soaked the lentils (contrary to package instructions) for several hours. This made the soup cook in the proper time; otherwise, it would have taken much longer. Since the lentils soaked up all of the water, I reduced the broth amount slightly. I'd make this soup again, but would probably experiment with other recipes before doing so.

This is it--this is the ONE. An incredibly terrific soup with the addition of basil, oregano and majoram. I made a vegetarian version without the ham. My Italian in-laws who've been eating lentil soup all their lives agree its the best they've eaten. I also added fresh chopped spinach 15 minutes prior to the end of cooking. Other reviewers are right--it does take a bit longer to cook to get the lentils soft. Also, puree 2 cups in food processor for a thicker texture. Yum.

Good easy base recipe. We added more spices like oregano and majoram. We did add a bit more liquid as the soup cooked to insure soft lentils.

I have not made this soup yet but I wanted to respond to the cook who couldn't get the lentils soft enough. It is important to use lentils within a year of being picked or they will be crunchy and become difficult to get tender.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but it looks good. I just wanted to answer the how do you get lentils to soften question. Red ones cook in less than half the time that brown or green lentils do, so if you like the consistency of split pea soup, use red ones. Also, just like beans, lentils can be soaked overnight. And even the longer cooking lentils will eventualy mush up and try to soak up any amount of water you can throw at it. Quite a yummy source of good protein!

this was very easy to make and tasty as well - i did subsitute italian sausage for the ham - i just browned it in a skillet and then added to the soup - also, i had red lentils in my pantry instead of the french green ones - so i didn't follow exactly - but was very very tasty and a good winter soup

We absolutely loved this soup; albeit, with a few changes. Herbs added: basil, oregano, and thyme. Spices added: cinnamon and nutmeg (I know, but it works!). For color: 2C halved grape tomatoes added one hour before serving, and fresh spinach added during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking time. Oh yeah, I doubled the recipe, and also added one very powerful, home-grown cayenne pepper (halved) from my freezer. Try it! Btw, I always cook lentils for hours; 45 min. just does not mean soup to me!

This was a good, fast, tasty soup. My only question is...how do you get the lentils softer. They seemed to stay a bit crunchy even after a long time simmering.

This should probably be 2 1/2 forks. I though it was good, but not great; but my husband, who normally does not like lentil soup loved it. Next time, I think I'll try the last reviewer's idea of adding potatoes. It sounds good.

This was my first time ever making a bean soup and it was fabulous. I added potatoes and a little more stock. Very easy, very tasty. It was so good my boyfriend said it reminded him of his mom's!

I tried this recipe last night and my hubby and I both enjoyed it. Very easy to make even for a novice. I would suggest doubling it if you are big eaters.

A good solid lentil soup recipe. I made the curried horseradish cream, also available on Epicurious, to add a little zip to it but it did not really need it as it was rather tasty on its own.
