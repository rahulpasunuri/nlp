This recipe earned me the title of "Best chef in the entire world" , or so said my 7yr old. This was an easy recipe and everyone in my family loved it! I used dijon mustard instead of mustard seeds and it came out great. I don't know why people are complaining about it being dry.....if you dry the chicken before you stuff it, and follow the cooking times, it comes out perfect!

This was a great recipe. Dry or tough chicken is made by the cook, not the recipe. I like to use this brining method, it adds incredible flavors and keeps the meat juicy. It's from "How to Grill" by Steven Raichlen and I post it because it is freely available online: Steven Raichlens Brined Chicken 4 skinless and boneless chicken breast halves (6 to 8 ounces each) 1⁄4 cup coarse salt 1⁄4 cup firmly packed dark- brown sugar 12 whole black peppercorns 1 red chili pepper, thinly sliced 2 whole bay leaves 1 cup hot water 3 cups cold water 1 lemon, thinly sliced 1 small onion, thinly sliced 2 cloves of garlic, peeled, then crushed with the side of a cleaver 1. Rinse chicken under cold, running water and blot dry with paper towels. Arrange in a nonreactive baking dish. 2. Make the brine: Place the salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, chili pepper and bay leaves in a large, nonreactive bowl. Add the hot water, then whisk until the salt and brown sugar dissolve; stir in the cold water. Let brine come to room temperature. Pour over the chicken and stir in the lemon slices, onion and garlic. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let stand in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning the chicken once or twice. 3. Preheat the grill until coals are hot. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grate. Arrange the breasts on the hot grate, all facing the same direction, at a 45-degree angle to the bars of the grate. Cook the chicken over high heat, 4 to 6 minutes per side, rotating the breasts 90 degrees after 2 minutes on each side to create an attractive crosshatch of grill marks. (To test for doneness, remove a breast from the grill and poke the thickest part with your finger. It should feel firm to the touch.) Transfer the chicken to a decorative platter and serve.

made on 8/8/10 - very good, simple recipe. I used chicken breast tenderloins. Be sure to spray Pam on the cooking surface so the chicken doesn't stick. Enjoyed w/bordeaux rose. Would make again.

This was so yummy. The grainy mustard gave it just the right amount of kick. I used Asiago cheese which, coupled with the saltiness of the prosciutto, gave the chicken just the right amount of seasoning. I didn't want to stand outside in the -27 degree weather to grill it so I baked it in my oven at 350 for 25 minutes, but then it had to sit a while so that my side dish could finish which made the chicken turn out way too dry. Next time I will be more conscientious about the time! No matter though it still tasted great!

Delicious and company worthy. Important to have THIN sliced proscuitto. Next time I will make a chiffonade of the basil - and use a bit more per breast. The whole leaves can be a bit tough if they are large. I drizzled the stuffed breasts with olive oil and seasoned with beau monde for a charcoal grill - This would be delicious with linguini.

Very good! I served it with pasta and a creamy mustard sauce, worked like wonders. I'll add more basil the next time, and will serve it with risotto and fresh bread instead. All in all, it was really good.

I kinda used this recipe as a jumping-off point (among other things, I'm an apartment-dweller with no grill), but thought I'd share my variations. The first thing I did differently was use thin cutlets to make rolls insted of stuffed breasts. Brown them quickly on one side, then layer the stuffing ingredients on the other side and roll them up, securing with a toothpick. Pop them in the oven to bake through. Per another reviewer I used goat cheese instead of mozzarella and omitted the mustard. (Others mentioned the chicken needed a marinade, so I popped some olive oil, lemon juice, dried herbs and salt & pepper on mine for an hour or so before cooking.) Great combo of summer flavors. I just ate some of the leftovers cold and it was maybe even better.

I deviated a bit from the ingredients to add a bit more flair. Instead of basil leaves I added a light coating of pesto. I also added a small slice of gruyere cheese and finished it off by breading the chicken. Turned out great with full flavor

My husband and I have this one on our short list of favorites. We grill it on our BBQ. The only modification we make is that we use dijon mustard rather than coarse-grained. This gives it a richer and tangier flavor which we love.

This rules. We like to use Kirkland brand pesto in place of the gorgonzola and basil. The proscuitto remains. The only reason I mention "Kirkland" is because, oddly enough, it is far and away the best pesto money can buy.

I used pesto instead of basil and wrapped it inside the prosciutto. If you stuff the rolled up prosciutto in good, you can get two inside each pocket. Sauteed each side for five minutes in an oven proof pan, sprinkled grated Mozzarella over the top, covered, and baked for 25 minutes at 350. Came out juicy and tasty!

This was great! Both my wife and I loved it. Rather than grilling the chicken, I roasted it at 425 for 30 minutes. I also marinated the chicken in Italian dressing before stuffing it. Rather than mozzarella, I used some thin slivers of asiago fresco for the stuffing and left off the mustard in the stuffing.

This was good, but I had a lot of trouble keeping the rolls inside my chicken breasts. I even tried holding them shut with toothpicks, but it was still a mess. A tasty mess, but akward nonetheless.

I made this recipe exactly as shown and now I see why there were so many suggestions from previous cooks. It needs something. The pocket worked nicely and the presentation was good, so there is some potential. I might try it again and follow the suggestions to marinate the chicken first and use a different cheese.

Great recipe...For a less expensive spin on this easy dish I will occasionally substitute with Virginia Ham and Provolone. The chicken still absorbs the ham's flavor and stays so juicy.

I doubled the prosciutto and used a thin coating of dijon mustard for a little more kick. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and the result was outstanding! I don't know what people are doing to dry their chicken out but I used a gas grill (medium heat) and it came out very juicy. The strong, zesty taste of prosciutto and basil dominate the palette, with the chicken augmenting its taste and texture. I served this as a Valentine's dinner and my girlfriend loved it as much as I did. On a side note, this dish paired very nicely with Piper Heidsieck rose champagne. Highly recommended!

The chicken was bland even though I marinated it for over an hour. It was nothing special and I wouldn't make it again.

Marinated it in Italian dressing too. I forgot the mustard, I think it would of tasted good. Left out the fresh basil (hubby doesn't like) but used a pasta seasonsing sprinkle from Penzeys.com. I made my roll too tight, like a cigar, would of tasted better folded flat to spread out the filling. I'll make it again.

I substituted crushed garlic in a jar for the mustard, and it was awesome! I also used a reduced fat mozzarella cheese and you really couldn't tell. I also marinated the chicken in Italian dressing beforehand, as the others suggested. Will make this again for sure!

Followed the other reader reviews and marinated the chicken first - also whipped up a batch of pesto and used that lieu of the mustard. Delicious and simple to make. Rave reviews around the table - a keeper.

Easy, and always good. I've also swapped the mustard for pesto with equal results. Many friends and family have asked for this recipe. Easy to prepare ahead of time.

This was great, although we grilled our chicken on low/med and it took about 10 min per side. Also, I won't season with salt again...the prosciutto was enough! Very good and very easy!

I followed the recipe but grilled on indirect medium heat for about 7 minutes per side. Turned out great! No marinade necessary. Next time I will remember to use LARGE chicken breasts. Smaller ones cannot accommodate the stuffing.

This recipe was so easy and awesome BUT you must let the chicken marinate beforehand so you're not dealing with a hockey puck-otherwise, it was so goo, my boyfriend was very impressed and it couldn't have been easier!

I took all of the previous suggestions. I brined the breasts, used fontina and parmesan instead of mozzarella, pan fried them in olive oil and made a sauce by deglazing the pan with wine, adding some coarse mustard, parmesan,a little leftover prociutto, and cream. It was excellent....even my pickiest son liked it. I will for sure make it again. Thanks for all the reviews that helped make this so excellent the first time out!

The flavor of this was good, but nothing great. I also felt the chicken was dry. On the plus side, husband loved it. And it's easy and makes a beautiful presentation when sliced in half--good potential as a party food.

This would have gotten three forks if I was told to brine the chicken first (marinate in chicken broth for 3+ hours). Do that and you've got a winner. Otherwise it comes out a little tough.

I was not nearly impressed with this as the others. I cooked one breast on the grill and found the chicken to tough and the other breast on top of the stove. It was much more juicy and tender that way, but still just an ok dinner

Awesome, I too covered the chicken with tinfoil for the first 15 min. Very moist and great taste. This is very easy & rave reviews from my company.

Rating: 3
Great combination - I breaded it and backed it in the oven, worked out very well. Suggest covered until virtually done, and then broil to brown the outsides, this will help to prevent drying out.

It's too cold here for the barbeque now so I pan-fried these breasts in a little bit of olive oil. When done I removed them and deglazed the pan with white wine and made a lovely little sauce. I also used raclette instead of mozarella. It turned out great. The cheese seeped out a little bit but nothing major. Very tender and moist, and I will definitely make them again.

This was really good. My husband LOVED it and enjoyed the leftovers even more. We had just returned from Italy and were craving some of the familiar Italian flavors. This did the trick! The only downside was it took quite a while to cook the breast being that they were so thick. I may pound them out a bit next time and see if that makes a difference. I served this with herbed polenta and asparagus and it was great...

This chicken dish is very simple and tastes amazing. I served it to four friends and got rave reviews like "this is the best chicken I have ever had" and "better than you could ever get in a restaurant". SO EASY too. I served it with lemon pepper pasta and a green ceasar salad. I was suprised that there were no problems with cheese leaking out either. Pretty foolproof.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was outstanding! I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. I did close the opening by threading a bamboo skewer through the breast and trimming the tip and top. I was afraid the cheese would seep out. I served it for an elegant grill dinner, and everyone loved it! Definitly a keeper!!!

Excellent dish. I've made it twice and it always comes out looking and tasting great. I used jarlsberg cheese both times. Easy to prepare ahead. I agree with the notes from the person who cut back on the basil. Less is better if the basil is fresh and strong.

Very tasty. Instead of grilling (it's winter), I dredged the stuffed chicken breasts in flour and sauteed in olive oil, 5 minutes per side. Kept chicken warm in oven and added chopped shallots to pan, then deglaze with white wine and finished with a little cream. Delicious! Maybe next time I'll add sun-dried tomatoes and a little garlic to the sauce. The chicken was not dry at all, and the flavors were wonderful.

I loved it - so easy, yet so much more exciting than just another grilled chicken breast. Also, I agree with the review about swiss cheese, I used it too and the flavor is superb.

Got rave reviews from my family. Very simple to prepare and had no trouble with the chicken drying out. I did use smaller prepackaged chicken breasts and marinated them in Italian dressing for 2 hours before preparing. Because the breasts were smaller than recommended, 1 slice of procsiutto was suffice and I had to pin the edges of the breasts together with a toothpick so the stuffing wouldn't fall out. My family also picked the basil out of the finished chicken because they said it was too overpowering, but left a lovely flavor. The finished product looks like a restaurant quality meal and has a wonderful array of flavors. I served it on a bed of rice pilaf, steamed asparagus, and a dinner roll. Very Good!

Sorry. This wasn't what I expected. It was dry and had very little taste. I braised it wine in a casserole so it wouldn't be dry, but it just wasn't very good.

An excellent dish with a wonderful presentation. It was easy to prepare and yet had a complex mix of flavors. I personally had no problems with the chicken drying out on the grill. It made a knockout of a Valentine's dinner!

Try it with a layer each of goats cheese (instead of mustard and mozzarella) and fresh basil leaves on the prosciutto. You can also cook it in an oven in a small casserole dish just large enough for the breasts and basted with a small amount of melted butter. Put a bit of white wine in to keep it extra moist. Delicious.

It was an elegant dish to present from the grill, that was quick and easy.

The stuffing was very flavorful and moist. Since the chicken is skinless I decided to marinade it in a simple white wine marinade. I'm glad I did - it would have been too dry without it. All my guests loved it.
