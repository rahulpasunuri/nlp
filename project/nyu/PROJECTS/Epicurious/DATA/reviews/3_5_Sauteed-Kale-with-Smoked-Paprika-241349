Good and tasty, and easy with it too. Nothing outstanding here, but a simple, nutritious side dish.

This is by far one of my favorite ways to make kale... I love the mix of the sweet caramelized onions with the spicy paprika. I add a pinch of aleppo pepper in addition to the paprika, and cook the kale in veggie or beef stock for extra depth of flavor. Yum!

This is a good basic recipe, but does not have much depth. I always wanted to try smoked paprika and I am glad I did! Try the kale recipes with olive oil, garlic, onion, anchovies, chicken broth and parmesan cheese. Much more flavorful.

The Smoked Paprika is my favorite part of this recipe. It adds so much flavor so I am guessing if you substitute a different paprika, it will come out differently.

Excellent dish. I served it under roasted balsamic vinaigrette-marinated chicken breast. My only modification was to saute chopped garlic with the onions. The bite of the (generous) red pepper is a nice touch.

I'm not a big fan of kale but we joined a CSA and get kale in our box often. So I was happy to find this easy recipe.I didn't have smoked paprika so I used hungarian paprika, smoked salt and sweet onion. The flavor combo was great - spicy, sweet and smokey.

not that great. there are better, more organic flavor combos to explore with kale

Not a bad recipe at all; I usually will go with collard, mustard or turnip greens, and the kale was a good change. Could not find the sweet or hot smoked paprika so used Hungarian. This may have influenced my take on the recipe as a whole.

Great recipe for cooked greens. The smoked paprika really makes it special.
