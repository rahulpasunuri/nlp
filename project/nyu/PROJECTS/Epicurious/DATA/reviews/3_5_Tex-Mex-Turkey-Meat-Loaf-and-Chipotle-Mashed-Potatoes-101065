Made this for my family and it was great. I used regular sour cream, and used approx. 1 Cup of prepared bread crumbs. Loaf stayed together well, even though I served it about 5 minutes out of the oven! Made the Chipotle potatoes. They were good too. Just put about 1 Tbsp. of the adobo sauce in them and a palmful of cilantro. Just a little nice heat then. Also added some shredded mont. jack cheese when I mixed it with a hand mixer. Maybe next time I'll add in some shredded Mexican Blend cheese. Will make again!

Made a few changes based on what I had on hand and came out with a good, spicy meatloaf! I used the adobo glaze from the adobo glazed mini meatloaf recipe on this site and threw in 2 jalapenos because I like it hot. I would definitely recommend it! Not the same as normal meatloaf but a good healthy substitute. Also made the chipotle mashers with sweet potatoes. Yum!

We really tore this up at the game. Makes a great sandwich the next day too.

Simple and very good! I modified it in accordance with other reviewers' suggestions: I used salsa instead of chili sauce, no sour cream, a red onion, and a green pepper. Really yummy. Mine cooked in about 50 minutes so I have no idea why the recipe calls for 1.5 hours! Also, I used a food processor so the prep time was nothing. Enjoy!

I did not expect this to rival my favorite meat loaves made with beef and pork but was pleasantly surprised. It's wonderfully seasoned with cilantro and holds together well; I like the chili sauce topping. I did not use this potato recipe and made the meatloaf with ground chicken. This is an exceptional lowfat dish even my husband liked. I'll make this meatloaf again when I want comfort food with little guilt.

This meatloaf was just okay. It wasn't horrible, and the texture was actually quite good - it was moist - but the taste was really disappointing. It was just completely blah, like something someone's non-kitchen-oriented mother made from a recipe on the back of a box. The overwhelmingly predominant flavor was that of ketchup (although maybe some chili sauces are less ketchup-like than the one I used). The only thing that differentiated the taste of this meatloaf from other blah meatloaves was the cumin, but this wasn't enough to rescue it from mediocrity.

This was delicious! I only gave it 3 stars because 4 stars has to be something special (like lobster). I omitted the sour cream (too much fat), used a whole jalapeno, used a green instead of red pepper, and substituted 1/2 cup of salsa for the chile sauce. The consistency was fine, and the taste was great.

This was delicious. I used a mixture of ground 2/3 dark turkey (thighs) and 1/3 white (breast) turkey. I thought the cumin and cilantro were perfect. I used Frontera roasted garlic, chipotle, and cilantro cooking sauce for the chili sauce - worked wonderfully. I thought the loaf was better and held together better as leftovers. The potatoes were a great match.

Excellent taste and good substitute for meat eaters who can't have red meat. Chopping the vegetables finely in a food processor helps the texture.

Nice flavor and pretty easy to make, but I used about half of the cilantro they asked for in both recipes and the flavor of the cilantro was STILL too heavy. Tasted great when the meatloaf (which didnt stay in slices at all) was mixed in with the potatoes.

This had nice flavour and was easy to make (note: they are not kidding about needing the drip pan below the loaf pan). I found that the consistency was a little too moist .. and it came out a bit on the soggy side. Couldn't make sandwiches with the leftovers.

Yummy combination of flavors. I prefer to use ground veal because of its flavor. I added an egg. Everytime I make it for my husband and I there isn't a morsel left.

I prefer ground veal so I used that. The flavors were wonderful. The sliced didn't hold together well but as my grandfather said, "It all tastes the same going down." YUM!

Delicious!!! I decided to use ground veal and didn't regret it. I think veal has more flavor than turkey. I used more bread to get a firmer loaf.

Rating: 4
This is fantastic! The flavors were intense and delicious! I substituted ground veal for the ground turkey. I highly recommend this substitution because the flavor is much better. I didn't have chili sauce so I used a steak sauce marindade. Yum! The chipotle mashed potatoes are a must. VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THE VILE CILANTRO, USE ITALIAN FLAT-LEAFED PARSLEY. You won't regret it!

loved it, not too hot and great flavors. Made it in the crock pot, works great. Of course is very moist then and doesn't cut nicely into neat slices, but - hey - who cares about the looks for a family dinner as long as the flavors are right?

Very yummy, moist & flavorful. Delicious with the Chipotle Mashed Potatoes--interesting flavor combination--liked it a lot.

although my fiance seems fine w/ the dish and even said he likes it, i hated it. since the recipe calls for so much cilantro and i *love* cilantro, i thought it would be great, but it tasted nasty to me. in the future, i'd make a really good traditional meatloaf, or a tasty well-seasoned mexican dish, not this mush.

Rating: 2
I liked this, and was glad to have an opportunity to enjoy meat loaf without the guilt of eating beef. I made the mistake of not mixing the ingredients thoroughly enough, so there were pockets of bland turkey. But I liked this and would make it again, especially if I have guests over who bring children.

Very flavorful. I used lean turkey and it held together fine. Everyone licked their plate clean - a great Sunday night meal with enough for leftovers for the week.

This is a nice alternative to turkey soup and sandwiches after Thanksgiving. Agree with others to chop pepper very fine. Also would back off a tad on cilantro and cumin. Usually I go the other way with seasoning (add more) but in this recipe both flavors seemed to overwhelm the rest.

Rating: 3
This is a standard for us, but it's not exactly "gourmet eats." Bump up the bread crumbs a bit, make sure not to get the totally fat-free turkey (too dry), and add a jalepeno (it needs the spice.) We top with salsa rather than chili sauce...salsa generally has better flavor and consistency. As for the taters...when we cook them, which isn't often, we use salsa. Yu-um.

A good way to spice up rather bland turkey without adding a lot of fat. I recommend chopping the sweet pepper pretty fine. I also used my own chili sauce which is a bit hotter than the commercial version.

The meatloaf was terrific. I didn't have the right sized loaf pan so I molded it with my hands using a rectangle 9X13 Pyrex. I molded it in the center of this dish leaving about 2 inches on each side. When the meatloaf was done, I was able to tilt the pan and pour off the reserved fat. It didn't get soggy or dry that way. The potatoes were OK, but have inspired me to add cilantro to my mashies in the future.

Actually made twice and tried to cut up peppers smaller as too prominent in taste the first time but then meatloaf did not hold together well. Will not make again. Sorry.

This dish was good, substituted ready made bread crumbs, regular sour cream and used some additional southwestern seasoning. Sauteed the onions and garlic prior to folding all ingredients together. This was an interesting dish, but I thought it had a lot more possibility than we realized. Great dish to take to a potluck.

I love this meatloaf! I agree with the review from Edison, NJ and followed the cues for more bread and no sour cream. The loaf turned out firm and had great flavor. For a little zap we occassionally add jalepanos to the mix. Different chile sauces can vary the taste. All breast ground turkey makes it a little drier and may need a dash more chile sauce then the regular ground turkey but either tastes great.

OK as far as turkey meatloaf goes, but overall it was a bit too sweet. The potatoes were too dry; the sour cream was no substitute for butter.

Somehow when I cooked this, the top half of the loaf was firm and the bottom have was mushy - although both tasted good. Any ideas what I did wrong?

Having made this recipe again using revisions I suggested in my last review, this time it came out just right. I went ahead and chopped the veggies and cilantro by hand, rather than in the food processor, omitted the sour cream, and also used 6 slices of light 7 grain bread instead of 4. The texture was perfect and the flavors really blended together nicely.

A surprisingly tasty alternative to boring meat loaf. Usually we have to put all sorts of condiments on top of meatloaf to make it taste great, but this recipe was condiment-free. Per other reviews, I omitted the sour cream and bell pepper. Other substitutions that I found delicious: I halved the amount of bread crumbs, I used a red onion, and, having no chili sauce, made my own from chili powder, red wine vinegar, and hot sauce. The cilantro, red onion, garlic, and spices came together to make a delightful bit of spicy (but not hot) comfort food, which I served with garlic mashed potatoes.

This meatloaf was wonderful, satisfying the taste as well as the apetite. The only change I would make would be to add more breadcrumbs as we like a firmer loaf. This recipe will become a standard.

This recipe was unique and took the boring part out of meat loaf. The zip of the chilli sauce and other ingredients made the turkey taste flavourful & delicious. It is a great version of meatloaf even if you aren't looking for a lower fat alternative. It was also easy to make. We made it a couple of months ago and are making it again tomorrow night.

I've made this recipie a half dozen times for my family, always to rave reviews. I am generous with the ingredients and seasonings, and it's always very, very good. The texture is very moist and somewhat crumbly, but the taste is incredible! Serve with horseradish mashed potatoes and peas for a real comfort-food meal.

Too much going on in this recipe - would be better minus a few ingredients such as omitting the sour cream (makes it too gooey), and the red pepper (just doesn't seem to work with the cilantro in this context), reduce the bread crumbs to half a cup (2 slices) and reduce/omit the cumin. I will not make this again, but please try TURKEY & ZUCCHINI MEAT LOAF (Bon Appetit September 1998)... it's fantastic!

This is the best ground turkey recipe I've ever encountered. I think the chili sauce is the big trick. Moist and full of flavor. We love it and so does everyone else invited to my table.

Moist, tasty. I added part chile sauce and part Fred Imus' hot salsa (and put the salsa on top too instead of the chile) - added a nice little zing. And the potatoes are great (see my review and the changes I made there).

My whole family has cravings for this fantastic meal. We love really hot food, so we substitute hot enchilada sauce for the chili sauce. Sometimes we vary the ingredietns slightly and make spicy turkey burgers for the grill. Topped with BBQ sauce they are marvelous. The chipotle mashers are to die for and a dieters dream with fat-free sour cream. We eat them with everything!

This is the best turkey meatloaf recipe yet. I substituted tomato paste for the chili sauce because the chili sauce is too sweet for my taste and I used Chipolte sauce instead of the chilis in the mashed potatoes because it's a bit milder.

The Heinz sauce was very overwhelming in this dish. Perhaps if you cut down the amount used it would taste better? I ended up throwing more than 1/2 of it away. And the mashed potatoes were... ew. I'm a big fan of mashed potatoes AND chipotle chilies... but this didn't work out too well.

I have made this twice in the past month. The best ground turkey meatloaf reciped I have found. As for the potatoes, they were way too spicy for me but my wife loved them. I plan to make the meatloaf again, but with a milder side dish.
