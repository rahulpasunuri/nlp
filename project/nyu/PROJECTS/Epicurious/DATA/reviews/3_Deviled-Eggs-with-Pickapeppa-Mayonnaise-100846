The flavor was OK but the color of the pickapeppa mayo was not appealing! I don't get the turning the egg flat side down and "bedding" the egg with the mayo sauce. I may try it again with the other viewers suggestion of just eliminating the sour cream and serving them in the traditional way

Just to answer the previous question (and for anyone else who wonders, as I've met a quite a few people who do), pickapeppa sauce hails from Jamaica and is made from tomatoes, onions, cane vinegar, mangoes, tamarinds, and peppers. You can find it is most supermarkets, generally near the ketchups, barbeque sauces, etc. Although it is lovely over devilled eggs and in other recipes, most often people pour it over a block of cream cheese and eat it with crackers. Easy and absolutely lovely!

Hello...Where do you get "pickapeppa sauce"? Is this a type of hot pepper sauce? I have a jar of "peppadews"...is this a different product?

Interesting, easy deviled egg recipe, but a bit messy to serve.

Like the recipe's author, I love PickaPeppa sauce so thought I'd try these eggs for a starter at a casual dinner party. The flavors together were wonderful, but I did "tinker" with the combination in that I eliminated the sour cream and used the pickapeppa mayo as the binder with the egg yolks, along with all the other ingredients. I didn't pour the mayo sauce on top as the recipe calls for. I used a dozen eggs and had more than enough mayo so I would think that the amounts listed in the recipe are overkill for the four eggs mentioned. They were a hit. One egg afficianado said they were the best he'd ever had.
