The meringues were a bit too chewy on the bottom, but overall,the combination of the crispy meringue, rich orange cream and chocolate sauce was delicious. A light dessert, and perfect way to use up all the leftover egg whites after making a lime curd or a custard. I added Grand Marnier to the chocolate sauce, which made it even more yummy.
