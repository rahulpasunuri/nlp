I made the sauce last night and served it over roasted Chilean Sea Bass. It was so good! I trying the leftovers on the tostadas tonight. I roasted the tomatillos and garlic as other suggested. Did not add any water to the sauce, and used 1 canned chipotle in adobo since I didn't have any jalapenos. YUMMY!

I made this the other night and was disappointed. The tomatillo sauce came out with a bitter after taste, which is probably my fault. It could be because I put the items in the blender instead of a food processor which pulverizes the seeds or because I didn't rinse the tomatillos well enough :( My wife said she likes it and would not let me throw it away, but my palate could not stand the bitterness. I might try again, making sure to rinse the tomatillos VERY well and using a food processor...hope you learn from my mistakes :) The beans were good and the tostada on the whole was good once I put some sriracha on it, but nothing to rave about.

This is now my favorite! My husband and I just can't get enough of it. I bake the tomatillos, jalapenos, and garlic on a baking pan drizzled with olive oil until they are soft. It's faster this way and still just as good. Right before we sit down to eat, I drizzle the pan with olive oil again and bake corn tortillas for the "tostadas". The whole meal is so easy and so tasty!

YUM! I used an immersion blender on the black beans, stuck the tomatillo salsa in the fridge instead of waiting 30 minutes for it to cool and used goat cheese instead of queso fresco. The family LOVED it.

this is a delicious dish, and i often find myself pining for it unexpectedly. i always just roast everything for the salsa together in the oven, and then puree it all together. it's easier, and also faster. i use canned beans for the black bean spread, so this moves faster too. i usually can't find queso fresco in my area, so i just use feta, which is awesome on this. DEElish.

I wasn't as impressed as other reviewers. I think the beans and salsa needed more seasoning. The heat was there, but I wanted more salt I guess. Definitely crisp tortillas. I think it makes a difference.

Fabulous! I followed the previous two suggestions and oven roasted the garlic and tomatillo, and used canned beans. I also used canned chipotle peppers in sauce instead of serranos since this was what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again!

I had a bunch of tomatillos from our garden to use so I made just the sauce. I roasted the tomatillos and the garlic in the oven and it turned out great. I also put the onion in the processor with everything else. Delicous. Had it with chicken one night and on huevos rancheros the next morning.

This is much fancier than my usual taco salad, but almost just as easy. I loved the roasted tomatillo salsa, it really made the dish. I used flour tortillas which I "fried" with some cooking spray in a hot pan to get them puffy and toasted. I also used canned black beans which made this an easy weeknight dinner.

This is very easy and fantastic. I made it once as written and then made the sauce a second time to serve as a salsa with chips. The second time I barbecued the tomatillo's to give them a smokey flavor and found it to be even better!
