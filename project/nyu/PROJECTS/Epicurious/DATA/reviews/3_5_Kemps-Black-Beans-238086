I have to amend my previous comment. I made this again today, with black beans. Last time I used kidney beans. The black beans worked perfectly.

I tried this recipe a while back. It took forever to get the beans to the desired consistency. I had to add a lot of cooking time at the end. Any words of wisdom? Should I soak them overnight perhaps and then proceed?

A delicious way to cook beans. Simple and sophisticated flavors. I used navy beans and worked great. The color was'nt pretty. I liked that it didn't take a lot of effort. Perfect for a cold day and I can eat these plain or in other recipes calling for beans.

I made these beans with canned beans in about 15 minutes, and its just what you need to kick an average can of beans into a dish that is memorable.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I do different is cook the rice along with the black beans. I used 6 cups of water and after adding the vinegar, sherry, and soy sauce I add 1 1/2 cups of white rice. This turns out to be delicious. great meal for vegetarians.

ok so the first time i made this, I followed the recipe to a T. And yes, it was a bit...off. But this is easily fixed. Knock off one cup of water. Substitue two cups of the water with chicken or veggie broth. Add a clove of chopped garlic and some dried oregano. double the sherry and soy. perfection. as good as any black bean recipe with meat. I also added an extra half of and onion.

I found these to be bland and basic. I made them as written, but won't make them again. Even time did not deepen the flavors.

WOW, this really is complex and flavorful! I was skeptical, so I added a few more ingredients: I subbed 4c of the water for chicken broth, added 3 cloves garlic, a little cumin and oregano and two bay leaves. The delicious combo of sherry, balsamic, and soy sauce really carries the dish, though-- my additions were nice, but not necessary. I used tamari soy sauce, which gave the dish a nice earthy flavor.

These beans lack flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the water from 8 cups to 6. I made them the night before because they're supposed to be better the next day. The vegetarians (who they were made for) didn't touch them. My husband and will finish them off, but they must be doused with flavorings and cheese and other creative toppings to make them remotely interesting or palatable. Which is what the 4 star reviews for this recipe do.

I used 6 cups of water, added garlic and let the beans sit overnight, as suggested by previous reviewers. These are very tasty, especially if you serve them as suggested in the Beans Your Way recipe. This has alot of flavor for a simple vegetarian meal. My husband supposedly hates black beans...but he ate these!

I followed the recipe using a pressure cooker and served the beans over basmati with a small handful of 1/2" cubes of Kerrigold aged cheddar. Amazing! The cheese was a nice touch as it simulated bacon chunks. Oh! And I also threw in a couple dried red chiles in the pressure cooker. Yum.

Amazingly fast, easy, and packed with flavor. Love it!

I followed other suggestions and made this with less liquid and pureed some of the beans at the end. I also added a bay leaf and sauteed the onions for a little more flavor. The result was very tasty and the flavors were even richer the next day. Make a big batch and use them in a variety of ways. I'll definitely be making these again.

Excellent, I have made this recipe many many times and I keep coming back for more! Keep in mind, these should be served with things-they are kind of bland by themselves, but make some of the best rice and bean dishes I have ever had. The suggested recipe with sweet potatoes and pumpkin seeds is fantastic. DO NOT FORGET THE AVOCADO- avocado is a key ingredient, I am sure you could find something creamy to work as an acceptable substitute for avocado (goat cheese, maybe?) but I would recommend just forgoing this recipe unless you have ripe avocado to go with it (but then again, there are a lot of recipes that bore me unless there is avocado involved). I like to fry the onions a bit before adding water and beans. Also, a red pepper in with the onions is really good.

Bleccchh! Sherry, balsamic, and soysauce? Terrible combination with black beans - I tried to salvage it next day by adding a pepper, garlic, oregano, then white wine vinegar to cut the sweet, and eventually cumin. I have this huge pot of sickeningly sweet beans and not convinced its edible at any stage. (and let me say that I love the original ingredients individually...)

I'm COMPLETELY missing the "complexity" of the seasonings. Not something I say frequently but this is a total never do technique in my book.

I loved this recipe because it's simple and it uses ingredients I already have in my kitchen. I did double the amount of Sherry, soy sauce and salt per the suggestion of another reviewer. Because the beans were soupy and I didn't want soupy beans, I added about 2 cups of rice and cooked them another ~25 minutes -- Caribbean style. Worked out well. I also left out the balsamic vinegar by mistake so maybe it's better without the vinegar? I also had soaked the beans the night before because that's so much a habit with me that I didn't realize the recipe said not to. Beans were mushy but this didn't really bother us. I will definitely try this recipe again and follow the directions more carefully as I'm curious what difference it will make.

Delicious! Great leftovers and even had some to freeze for quick side dishes. Made for a dinner party of 12 and had plenty. I made them a day ahead and reheated.

Amazing flavor. They get better over a day or two as well. I love them over rice with grated cheese and chopped up avocado. Just a great basic black bean recipe.

I just read another review that indicated this was part of a recipe with other components including sweet potatoes etc. you were supposed to mix together.that would make sense. As is, It is good but pretty flawed recipe. The flavor is awesome though. I followed recipe to the letter but it comes out basically as very runny bean soup. I cooked it twice as long as recipe called for but was still exceedingly soupy..who comes up with these recipes honestly?..On a positve note, I doubled up on all the other ingredients (soy, onion, sherry, etc.) and used some vegetable broth in place of water and the flavor was great and not your typical southwestern black bean theme.

Absolutely delicious! The flavour deepens over time, and I enjoyed the leftovers immensely. A good use of leftover cooked beans is to pulse them in a food processor with a little bit of water and olive oil to create a tasty dip.

P.S. I would use about 5 or 6 cups of water instead of 8 and then adjust from there if necessary.

The recipe calls for too much water, and for the beans I used, the cooking time was too long. My beans only required and hour and 15 minutes, and I ended up with at least four cups of water left over. I drained most of the water before adding the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. I didn't have any sherry on-hand, so I used 2 tablespoons of sweet vermouth, which worked out fine. There are a lot of potential substitutions for the sherry, but next time I'll probably go out and buy some. Despite any criticisms, these beans were great, especially as part of the recipe Beans and Rice Your Way.

This is an exceptional bean recipe and the flavor of the beans is indeed complex-- even with just 1 tablespoon each of soy and vinegar. I used amontillado sherry and it was fabulous. It's true that it's very soupy after even 2 hours of cooking, but this is easy to remedy. Pour through a strainer and set beans aside. Then boil down the liquid to thicken. When the liquid has reached the desired viscosity, return beans to pot and simmer a couple of minutes to cook through. This also concentrates the flavors, although I didn't think that was necessary.

Tasty, once I doubled the sherry, soy sauce and vinegar. Might have been more than double on the soy and vinegar. The beans were done but very soupy after about 1.5 hours, so I let them cook down another 45 minutes or so with the lid off; the beans are on the mushy side now but the overall consistency is right. What this dish really needs is some bacon, or ham. I know, so not vegetarian :)

This recipe was created to go with the Beans and Rice Your Way recipe, and when combined with the rice, sweet potatoes, and other ingredients in that recipe, it's simply phenomenal!

Fantastic! I substituted port for the sherry, and didn't have any onions on hand, but this was still marvelous. Adding a small amount of tomato sauce (i.e. 1 T or less) gives it just a slight extra depth of flavor that's very nice.

I'm not really fond of beans in general, but this wasn't too bad. Incredibly simple; I cleaned the house while they simmered.

I cook a weekly beans and rice meal for a community dinner. This was a perfect bean recipe that everyone loved. It's a great mild recipe that has a great flavor. Oh! And I'd strongly recommend cooking the night before (the flavors were much better the next day).

Loved this, the combiation was awesome, toasted pepitos rock! Served it as a side to a spice rubbed roasted chicken. I did not have time to start with dry beans so I used two cans of black beans, rinsed and simmered with the other ingredients. They were great. I also tossed cinnamon, cumin and cayenne in with the potatoes. I will be adding this to my regular list.

This is an easy, delicious, basic recipe. We serve ours with rice and a dollop of sour cream. It's also very nice with a little mango salsa. TASTY!

These are great (I recommend adding 2 crushed garlic cloves at the start), however if you use the pressure cooker, reduce the water to 6 cups. Otherwise you have to keep cooking them for too long in order to work off the extra water.

I loved this recipe. I used Rancho Gordo beans. These beans are divine if they are cooked in plain old water. This recipe really enhances the deliciousness of the beans.

This is our go-to recipe for black beans. They are tasty, easy to make, and versatile to re-use or transform in other recipes. We've substituted port wine for Sherry with no problem.

I'm so sad! I really hated this recipe. I thought it lacked any depth of flavor -- or really any flavor. I was hopeful by the comments, but in the end very unimpressed. I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent black beans. Delicious. A welcomed change from cumin. Started with that in mind and had already added a bunch of garlic. Cooked the beans 2hr lid cracked with carrots onion and garlic in 6 cups of water - added probably 2 more. Added almost 1/2 cup of sherry, 1T balsamic vinegar, 1.5T soy, salt. Fabulous combination. You can easily tweak it to your liking. I added a bit of paprika.

I'd give it four forks, if my beans didn't end up so watery. I'd cut the water next time, by at least a cup. They were tasty though in the black bean recipe, and I plan on using the rest for a modified version of the soup.

Tasty! I used two cans of black beans, rinsed well, and served over brown rice, topped with chopped cilantro and shredded carrot. The intro is absolutely correct.. it's super easy but has a lovely complexity to it.

Rating: 4
This is surprisingly delicious, even with canned black beans, rinsed (but not thoroughly). Of course, using the canned beans makes this a 10 minute dish. Any combination of two vinegars or sherry with the soy sauce is what really makes it. It's a truly magical combination.

I'm not a big fan of beans, however these were excellent. I served them along side turkey in mole sause and the summer rice salad (also from this site). They were a little tangy, a welcome change from the slightly dusty flavor of traditional black bean recipes. Didn't change a thing.

Rating: 3
Really Good! Great change from my usual garlic/cumin style black beans. Made them in the slow cooker using aluminum foil pressed down onto the surface (a trick I picked up from Cook's Country Slow Cooker Baked Beans recipe). Just dump everything in and start - no pre-boiling necessary. Next time I'll use 6 c water, 8 was too much for the slow cooker method. 5 hours on high worked out great for me. Used the full 2 T soy sauce and 2 T vinegar. Also added another 1/2 teaspoon salt. The flavor really does improve the next day.

I make Brazilian black beans all the time and didn't have much faith in this one but it was a great surprise. Delicious!
