I served this over grilled chicken to make a dinner out of it. Fantastic.

Had all the ingredients on hand, so I could not resist making this in spite of its appearance. Followed the recipe except that I mashed half the beans. Also took the phyllo cup suggestion but decorated the tops with a slice of Kalamata olive with a single parsley leaf poked into the center. Dressed it up nicely.

I was looking for an easy bean based recipe - and this fit the bill. I made it ahead and it tasted sort of bland. Luckily I didn't mess with it and it tasted very good after 4 hours. I used 2 cans of cannellini beans; I food processed the drained sun-dried tomatoes and 1 can of beans. Dried thyme worked well and I used fresh basil. We ate it on crackers for an easy light dinner.

This is one of the tastiest things I have ever eaten. I skip the bread completely and can just eat it alone. If you're not careful with the pine nuts, they can burn and ruin the entire recipe. I love this so much I make it once a month and eat it for lunch a few times a week.

This was okay, but went largely uneaten at our party. I must agree with an earlier reviewer that this is an UGLY dish, and its flavors are just okay. I won't make this again.

i made this for my husband's 30th birthday cocktail party and thought it was delicious! the beans make it hearty and the sun-dried tomato and feta makes it yummy!!! i also loved that you can make it in advance!!

Nobody's mentioned the elephant in the room: this dish is UGLY. Tasty, but ugly. But maybe it's because I cooked my own beans instead of using a can and they were pretty soft and mushy. So make it for a very dimly lit party.

This is a great offering - I had a lot of picky eaters, who all loved this one. I did coarsely mash about 1/2 of the beans so that it was a more cohesive topping.

I made it exactly to the recipe with regards to ingredient selections. I used two full cans of beans, and mashed one and kept the other whole. Wonderful!

I made this according to the recipe but put everything into the food processor and pureed to make a dip/spread. People rave about it. It's easy to serve and great with crackers and crudites.

Excellent! I made as prescribed except... I did not have any hot pepper to add AND I put the one remaining half can of beans in the processor...pretend you are making humis. Add this to the rest of the mix. By doing this you get a pastier consistency that will hold together and spread easily. The blend of flavors is great and this mix can be made a day ahead. An excellent alternative to Spanish/Mexican bean recipes. I cut up pita breads into single layer triangles, toasted them for 5 mins at 375 which made them perfect for the bean mix.

Serving suggestion: The mini phyllo cups rather than toasts or bread slices. I have made many lovely little bites both hot and cold with these cups and they are always a hit. This would also solve the 'problems' of speadability and chunkiness. I would further suggest that you try freezing one or two and then see how they are after they are defrosted. If they turn out okay then you could make them a week or two ahead then slip them back into the phyllo container and box for freezer storage. You could also make a double batch so that you have a handy appetizer whenever guests pop in.

If I would have rated this last night, one fork would have been generous. The intensity of the flavor of the sun dried tomatoes has toned down a bit. I agree with the other reviewers that the balance of flavors is a bit off.

I served these at a New Year's party and people really loved them. I think the balance of ingredients is a little off, though. If I made it again, I would only use one can of beans, and maybe another 1/2 cup of pine nuts. The pine nuts didn't really show themselves well as is. I also used a baguette instead of sandwich bread.

This was delicious and healthy. To make a little easier, I bought the mini appetizer bread and toasted it; looked nicer too than cut up bread.

I made this dish because my daughter is a vegetarian but the whole family actually requests it now! I did mash up some of the beans to make it a bit more spreadable. Either way is delicdious.

My husband wrote the last review and I can't fault a thing he says. I, however, would like to be a bit more effusive. This recipe is great! Excellent bean recipe that isn't southwestern in character. We really enjoyed it.

Great taste though the consistency is chunky. We didn't have fresh herbs so used dried. Worked well for a heavy finger food dinner for New Year's Eve.

Surprisingly good, very flavorful and easy to make but mine came but a little chunky. I recommend putting half of it in a food processor to thin it out.

Was not sure about the combination of flavors - but was pleasantly surprised. It had a spicy kick that everyone liked. This made a nice presentation in a bowl surrounded by crackers.

Eh. I didn't like the consistency of the feta & bean together--too much mush. The sun-dried tomato taste totally overwhelms the pine nuts.
