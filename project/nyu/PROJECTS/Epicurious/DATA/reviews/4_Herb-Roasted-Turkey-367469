What a winner! Made it twice over the holidays and I received praises from friends and family about the moistest bird ever eaten! I made more herb butter than was needed and stuffed the excess between the skin and breast meat as was suggested by another cook here. Delish!

Excellant, hands down the best bird I've made! That has a lot to do w/ the quality--I used a "natural" turkey ( no hormones, free range) which is more expensive, but break it down to the numerous meals for leftovers you'll find it's a good value. I always cook my turkey's breast down so the juices moisten the breast. To further prevent dryness, take it out of the oven, remove the white meat, and return the dark meat for 15-20 minutes. This was a huge hit, with everybody, including my 26 year old I rarely eat meat step daughter, deeming it the beat turkey they'd ever had. Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was fabulous. The turkey was the most moist I have ever tasted, including the breast meat, which I usually avoid because they turn out so dry. But this one was so juicy. It did take longer to cook than I anticipated, but it was handy to have a meat thermometer to check the temperature as I was going along. I plan to use this recipe for all Thanksgivings to come. I also brined the turkey overnight and used a moist cheesecloth to cover the turkey throughout most of the cooking time. I rebuttered frequently during the last 30-45 minutes after I removed the cheesecloth.

This turkey turned out fantastic. The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I felt that more of all the seasonings were needed to make a really flavorful turkey and gravy. Don't be shy with the salt, either! This was delicious.

I brined the turkey overnight in a cooler. I rubbed some of the butter-herb mix under the skin and the rest outside. The herbs do not run off while basting - if you baked it the first 45 minutes without basting as the recipe says. I put a little foil over the top after a bit because it was browning rather quickly. This was the best turkey we have ever had. The gravy from the drippings was very very good. My turkey was 20lbs and it was cooked to a temp of 160 degrees in 4 hours. It rested for an hour and was absolutely perfectly cooked. Delicious.

I am a very good cook but have limited experience with Turkeys (3 times), so I needed a recipe that was trustworthy but not necessarily simple. What this recipe does not tell you--but what Bobby Flay explained on the Today Show on Thanksgiving morning--is that he cuts off the breast meat and then puts the dark meat back in the oven and braises it in the juices. Well no wonder--the turkey was not done. We cut off the white meat and put the rest back in, but it was basically ruined.

No..No and Flay should know better. Essentially, he's making a mirepoix and in lieu of chicken stick, use white wine. Basting any bird with a crisping skin...stuff rolls right off. All it does is lower oven temp for a few minutes. Want herbed turkey?..shove the herbs between skin and flesh. I like a paste of garlic, rosemary, sage and butter. It bastes and flavors the flesh. Anything outside, stays outside.
