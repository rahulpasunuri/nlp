I wanted to give none forks? It's official. I don't like beet in soups. This is prob fine for what it is but I don't like it. Ah well. I had to give it a try.

Thanks for all the hilarious comments! One more question arises, however: Why would anyone bother to drain the beets first, reserve the liquid and then add the beets AND reserved liquid to the soup at once? I'm sure there'll be some inspired Earl of Jarred Beets to clear up on this one.

Well, to the best of my understanding, to "grate course" means to drag the grater across the potato in pristine, symmetrical little tracks. Of course, this is very different from the more common instruction to grate a potato coarsely, a messy task done only by peasants such as myself. (The Earl of Provo can have his kitchen girls do it.) How "course" improves the soup, I cannot say: I went with "coarse" myself. And I thank the cook from Oregon for clearing up that whole pheasant/peasant mess: I'd hate for my children to be used in the soup.

Surely you mean grated pheasant, not peasant. Grated peasant tastes like chicken and that would not go well with beets. However, I want to know how to grate a potato "course." Is that "grate a potato of course" or is this in reference to something about second dairy education for butter cooking?

Well, if you ask me, it just isn't "peasant food" without a little grated peasant. Add that, and you've got a really fine meal here.

I doubled the recipe and made this dish as part of our 2005 "New Year's Luck" feast. I used fresh beets and made it pretty much as written - very satisfactory. I also added grated golden beets for garnish. Will probably do it again next year.

"Peasant food" is a common term used in cooking to refer to simple, one-pot meals, usually stews. I'm pretty sure they're not talking about serfs.

"PEASANT" food? What are you, the Earl of Provo?

I guess I'm the only one so far who likes beets enough to try this recipe. It's good sometimes to eat peasant food. I replaced the canned beets with 3 medium sized boiled fresh beets and I added a lot more salt and a little chicken bullion.
