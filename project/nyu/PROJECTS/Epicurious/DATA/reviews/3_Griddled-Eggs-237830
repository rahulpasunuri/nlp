The eggs are tasty (provided you use A LOT of onion, salt, pepper), but it is not practical for Passover. You have to make these right before you serve them, or they will develop a strange texture (kind of firm and gummy at the same time). If you are doing a seder, you are likely going to be reading the Haggadah, and won't be able to run away to make these eggs and serve them.
