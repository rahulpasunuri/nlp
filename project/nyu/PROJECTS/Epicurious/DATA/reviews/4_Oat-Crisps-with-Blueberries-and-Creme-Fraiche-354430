I am puzzled as to why this recipe got such great reviews. The cookies are just okay, nothing to write home about. Usually the reviews on Epicurious are spot on but really surprised at this one. I would skip this!

These are lacy and elegant - not to mention delicious. My guests couldn't stop eating them, and I'm considering making another batch right now.

My first experience was one large sheet cookie. The next time I added 1 T of flour to the mix and the cookies held together. I like combining creme fraiche with slightly sweetened whipped cream. Good, easy dessert.

These were good but found them to be on the oily side.Also estimated a regular blob of cookie dough, size wise, but these spread out incredibly thin and large. You need a very very small blob of "dough" to get an edible sized cookie . Didn't get rave reviews so probably won't make again.

Extremely easy to make and the perfect summer dessert. I used whipped cream instead of creme fraiche. Bought whipping cream, added some sugar and vanilla extract and whipped it until thick. It is a very light dessert, and it is easy to get carried away with eating it!

These cookies are incredibly easy to make. They were well received at my house. I used maple syrup and skipped white granulated sugar. They are good by itself or with whipped cream. I added a splash of rum into whipped cream.

We wanted dessert, but had no eggs... And happened to have a container of creme fraiche and some clementines. This was AMAZING with clementines, I can't wait to try it with all kinds of fruit (especially grapefruit)!!

The oat crisps are amazingly good, using ingredients that one always has on hand. The last time I needed a double batch so I whipped 1 c whipping cream with 1/4 cup real maple syrup (that part is stolen from "maple blueberry parfait" - that's a good one too) and them mixed in the a cup of the creme fraiche. It was a great combo.

So easy and such a hit! We could not find creme fraiche at the grocery store so we used whipped cream instead (home-made). Everyone loves it!! They taste incredible light and amazingly sweet. You can easily overeat!!!

Excellent blend of texture and tastes. I substituted plain yogurt for the creme fraiche and it was outstanding. Great summer dessert.

I'm putting 3 forks only because I made some changes to the recipe. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup (way better!) and blackberries instead of blueberries. It was delicious and easy!

Refreshing, light dessert. Nice combination of flavors and textures.

Elegant, delicious, light. The specific combination of sweet, tart, crunchy, and creamy tastes and textures are exactly complementary.

to ruthedna from gull lake: parchment and wax paper are completely different. never bake with wax paper as it will burn. parchment paper is not waxed and does not burn.

I made one tray with parchment paper and immediately regretted it. I quickly pulled the paper out from under the cookies on the second tray and cooked right on the ungreased sheet. The waxed paper never gave way to the cookies on the first tray but the second tray (after they cooled for a few seconds) snapped off the sheet in nice glossy crisps. They were tasty, so we ate the first batch, wax paper and all!
