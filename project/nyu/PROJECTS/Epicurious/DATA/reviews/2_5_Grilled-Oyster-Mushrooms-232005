The vinegar is overpowering. Made this on the grill and sauted. The grilled ones are a slightly better as more of the vinegar is burned off. The vinegar just takes away the delicacy of the mushrooms.

Delicious! Lots of flavour for minimal effort. I adjusted the oil down to 4 tbsp - 6 tbsp was too much for my taste. Marinade is also great drizzled over grilled asparagus.

Besides being super easy, this recipe is delicious. We made it in the grill pan on the stovetop and it was fabulous. Now whenever I see oyster mushrooms cheap in the grocery I grab them.
