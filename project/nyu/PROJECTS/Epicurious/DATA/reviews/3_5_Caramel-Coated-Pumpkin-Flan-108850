This is a wonderful fall dessert. A cross between pumpkin pie and pumpkin cheesecake! Easy to put together, can be made a few days in advance, and everyone loves it! I will make it again and again!

I made this back in 2003 when the recipe came out and have been making it every Thanksgiving since! My husband's family is Cuban and the LOVED it!! It's a great alternative to pumpking pie and is actually better to make it a day or two in advance because it tastes better after setting for a day or two. I have taught my stepdaughter to make it and this year my daughter is going to learn. I make mine in a metal bundt pan and it comes out perfect!

Very good recipe - i made the flan in a tin I have for making flan (bought it overseas) and one suggestion if you are short in time use the pressure cooker for 15 minutes and your flan will be ready, saves time and energy.

I make flan a lot, but obviously something went wrong as there was no caramel sauce when I served this. Maybe I should have doubled the caramel. The response was "pumpkin pie without the crust" as others have noted. Yummy taste and texture. I served with vanilla whipped cream and toasted pecans. I didn't find this time conusming at all. FYI - for the cook that cracked her souffle dish - I always place the baking dish in the oven as it pre-heats before I pour in the hot caramel.

I'm not a pumpkin flan, but my family and coworkers LOVE this! It's very easy to make, which is another plus.

I made this recipe back in '03 for Thanksgiving it did not even last, the flan was gone in 60 seconds. If I had known it was going to be this good I would have made 3 pies. My family wanted the recipe write then and NOW!

I love this recipe! I served it for a Halloween dinner party. I made it in custard cups for individual servings which looked very pretty. I found it tasted great the first day but amazing the second.

I have made this 3 times in the last 2 months and at each time, received raves from my guests. This recipe goes into my favorite family recipes file.

We loved this dish! We made it for our Thanksgiving feast. It is more like Pumpkin Cream Pie than Flan but that's ok! I love pumpkin cream! Much better than your standard pumpkin pie! YUM YUM

It's just like pumpkin pie filling without the crust but not like flan at all. I was disappointed and thought it was a little gross because it was way too fluffy but my family loved it.

Disappointing, tasted and had the texture of a crustless pumpkin pie, not a pumpkin flavored flan

I cracked my Souffle dish with hot caramel. Used deep dish pie metal pie pan instead. Worked fine. Yes seemed more like pumpkin pie texture than flan. Better than my usual pie recipe.

I was disappointed that this didn't have the consistency of a traditional flan. I'm wondering if this recipe is supposed to have the texture of pumpkin pie, or if there is something wrong with my oven.

This recipe is amazing!!!! I totally agree that I will never make pumpkin pie again -- I never eat the crust anyway. I prepared it exactly as written using regular old grocery store spices and it was perfect. My son tasted the batter before it went in the dish and exclaimed "I could drink this!" This is now a permanent addition to my holiday menus!

Excellent alternative to pumpkin pie. BTW-I live in NJ and never paid $8 for ground cloves...Ever hear of McCormick?

I also made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it! The next morning my Step-Father said it was 'fabulous' & I have never heard him use the word fabulous! I made it exactly as it is in the recipe except that I forgot the cloves. I would agree, it's just fine without them. It was not difficult, but time consuming. I also made the frosted grapes, which I thought might be viewed as a little silly, but gathered compliments as well. We served with crumbled sugar cookies & real whipped cream. Yum. My boyfriend is still talking about the leftovers. Perfect for Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was absolutely delicious! But, I have to say, I baked it in a special container that I have for flans, which looks a little like a cookie tin: I pour the contents in there, cover it with its lid, and bake it in a water bath until set. It does not look crunchy on top, but rather smooth, and then you unmold it the next day onto a platter with its own caramel sauce: simply perfect!

This was, by far, the simplest flan recipe I have ever tried. The flavor was awesome. Everyone at the Thanksgiving table raved. I did individual flans and the recipe yielded 8 servings. The only complaint I have is the price of ground cloves in NJ. The recipe only calls for 1/4 tsp. The smallest container of ground cloves cost me $8. I did it both ways, once with and ince without the cloves, and you could barely tell the difference. If you have no other use for ground cloves you can go without for this recipe.

This desert is a perfect alternative to pumpkin pie for all the relatives who are watching their weight. It eliminates the high fat crust while maintaining the classic essence of pumpkin pie. Once you make this, you will never make a pie for thanksgiving again.

This was absolutely delicious, and a big hit for Thanksgiving dinner. I made it 2 days ahead of time, and cooked it at 350 degrees, as this is the temperature my other flan recipes call for. I also only used 1 and 1/2 cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. ginger. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is wonderful for the holidays. Not only is it delicious, but, you should make it days ahead. Several of my guests wanted the recipe - including one who has owned several restaurants.

This was a very disappointing recipe. Flavor and texture was just great--for pumpkin pie. But it just doesn't have the consistecy of a good flan. Better off pouring the filling into a crust.

Good but basically tastes like a pumpkin pie without the crust. I've been makin flan for years. I learned recipe from a French Chef. I took that recipe and substituted some of the cream with pumpkin. Much better and lighter pumpkin taste.

I love carmel custard (flan) and pumpkin but in my opinion (and that of my guests!) these two ingredients do not mix well together in this recipe. Flan is best kept simple!

Very easy recipe to make. While the finished pumpkin custard had good, smooth consistency and tasted good, I did not like the syrupy caramel floating around and on top of it. I think I prefer my pumpkin in a pie crust.

Making the caramel is easy: just use a teflon or non-stick skillet instead. When I do this, I have perfect caramel syrup every time, and I don't have to brush down the sides with water, the teflon does that for me!

I had such a response to my offer earlier today for an alternative caramel that adds corn syrup, that I thought I'd take a chance and just post it. I like this since it keeps well and stays pourable even after it cools. Pouring caramel for Flan (Makes about 20 oz.) Granulated sugar - 14 oz.* Water - 4.5 oz.* Light Karo syrup - 1/8 cup* Boiling water - 1/2 cup** Method: Stir together sugar, first amt. of water, & Karo Syrup and cook until it turns deep amber in color. Remove from heat and VERY carefully add the boiling water through a colander to the caramel. Do this slowly as this can cause the caramel to splatter (using the colander seems to help). Stir until smooth. You can add the caramel straight away to the mold or ramekins, but I find it's best to wait until it's cooled a bit to add your flan mixture. If there is any caramel left you can save it and use it later. It has such a high sugar content that it keeps quite a while even at room temp. Good luck!

Great....Simply wonderful!!!

I am a flan lover, but have never made one. What exactly does "brush down the sides with a wet pastry brush" mean? I envision it sort of like using a soaking wet brush to rinse water down the pan sides into the syrup, since swirling leaves some syrup on the sides. How do I know how much is enough, just do it after each swirl? It seems like it would dilute the syrup. Help...

Fantastic. This received rave reviews in all categories from my loyal tasting panel (my lucky neighbors!): great on pumpkin taste, texture and presentation. A few thoughts: I baked it in the correct sized souffle pan and it came out about 3 inches high! Very nice and dramatic, but I would also try it in the next size bigger to get more, shorter pieces. Next, I tried it the day after I made it and it was good, but the taste and texture improved after a few days. So go ahead and make it on Monday to serve on Thanksgiving. As always, you have to watch caramel carefully, pull it off the heat just as you start to smell it; it goes from dark amber to burnt in a nanosecond. I give this recipe 4 forks for ease of preparation as well. This will be a keeper for my catering business, as well as for the "portable" thanksgiving dinner I have to make this year!

I made this flan in individual ramekins and it was a big hit with my family. My 9 year old is ahuge pumpkin fan and he thought it was "the best pudding" he's every eaten. My husband liked it very much as well...I would definitely do it again.
