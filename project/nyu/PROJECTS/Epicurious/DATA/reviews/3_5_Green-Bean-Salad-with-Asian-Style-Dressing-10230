A fresh take on green beans. I made the dressing as written but upon tasting thought it was lacking something. Added 1 tsp. honey and the fine zest of half a lime...that did the trick. Bright, tangy flavors complemented by the sesame seeds really perked up the green beans.

Very good! Made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it. I agree the dressing can be used for many other greens. Subbing olive oil would make it too heavy, could just cut down on veggie oil a bit.

Loved! Used olive oil instead of canola and added pignoli nuts since I did not have sesame. I did not have used less green beans and let them soak in the dressing. Delicious! Ah, also used apple cider vinager instead of white whine. Very yummy!

I made this for a large birthday party. It was gone immediately. I will definitely make it again. I believe I did cut back on the oil as many seemed to think it was too much.

This was ok, but I felt it needed a little something more. If I make it again, I'll try 2 great reviewer suggestions - grapeseed oil (the canola wasn't working for me), and adding julienned red pepper. As it is, I found it bland, although I'll admit my green beans weren't very fresh.

True, it's too much dressing, but I just put it in a jar in the fridge to put over steamed spinach or something else next week. I'll 1/2 it next time. Delicious. I added a little chinese hot oil for zip, but when I do it for a regular weeknight dinner for the kids, I'll leave that out.

This recipe is very good, dressing is good on almost all kinds of salad, except maybe fruit salad. I recomend this highly.

Served this at room temp for a backyard bar-b-que - everyone loved it! Was told this is a "keeper". The recipe even did well doubling it!

the dressing was overwhelming.I threw most of it into the garbage. I love string beans, but this was terrible

Served this for a small dinner party as a complement to bobotie and yellow rice. Perfect. I did not feel the dressing was that overwhelming or complicated as others have said. I served the beans on a bed of Boston Lettuce and I laid a few very thin strips of red pepper on top of the beans - mainly for decoration/contrast but I think it enhanced the taste as well. I had many compliments on this dish.

I agree with the previous comment that this is too much dressing. It's tasty, but overwhelming. Next time we make it, I'll only do 1/2 of the dressing.

Very tasty dish. I found that I didn't need all the dressing for the beans. Really nice dish.

I love this recipe. I absolutely love green beans and I love asian food. This is a great combo. I use grape seed oil instead of canola. It's much lighter. Over all this is a great recipe. I make it all the time

I brought this dish to a pot luck last night... rave reviews!!! Several people asked, "who made the green beans?" This dish is easy and yummy!!! I steamed instead of boiling the beans... make sure they stay crispy, I think that this adds to the dish... a definate crowd pleaser!!!

I made this last year to rave reviews from people who ordinarily would not like cold string beans. I did find the dressing unecessarily complicated and plan to cheat with quality bottled oriental dressing this time around.

I used the dressing with thinly sliced medium rare beef served on a salad of mixed greens. I substituted 2 sherry vinegar for the white wine vinegar and used 2 tsps of fressh ginger. It was delicious!

My husband and green beans are arch enemies, however, he wolfed this recipe down in no time. I took the advice of another cook and added a little less oil. I'd definitely make this again just to see my husband eat green beans.

Disappointing, not as good as other versions, and not worth repeating.

Everyone loved this recipe in my family. The only thing I would do differently next time is add less oil, because 1/3 cups is way too much oil.

Not too crazy about the dressing with the green beans; which did need to be cooked longer. I could actually see the dressing on greens though and like another cook here, felt it needed some sugar.

This is a diffrent touch for a bean salad.This was a good complement to the Asian Garlic Chicken.

I thought this salad was a wonderful addition to a meal. I am not one to particularly enjoy green beans at all especially in a chilled salad, but the flavors blended wonderfully. Definitely a must do again!

A simple, tasty recipe. Nice and fresh tasting for a summer barbeque party. I added a little sugar to the recipe and preferred it that way.

Certainly an easy recipe, although you certainly don't need 1/3 c vegetable oil! I added 2 tsp and I don't think anything was missing. I also added some red pepper flakes to add a little bit of flare. Definitely will keep this as a staple.

This is a great dressing and one I keep on hand in my refrigerator. I must admit tht I don't bother with the sesame seeds, but I follow the dressing recipe to the letter. It also makes a superb dressing for broccoli.

Brought this to an office Christmas potluck and got more requests for the recipe than I have for anything else. The beans turned a bit yellow (after having sat in the dressing for five hours) but it was still crunchy and delicious.

I'd rather use store-bought Asian-flavored salad dressing.

I made this salad for a dinner that had an "asian" theme. It was a hit! I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead, DEELICIOUS! Everyone enjoyed it and it's very simple to make with very easy to find ingredients.

This never fails to please every taste. It's easy to make and it goes great with grilled or barbequed fish or chicken.

Easy and delicious. Even my nine-year-old, no fan of green beans, liked it.
