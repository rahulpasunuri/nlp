I have made this a number of times following the recipe quite closely. Most recently I followed the recipe but added about 1 1/2 T butter and a little fresh basil when I was cooking the broth. Was delicious and leftovers heated up surprisingly well.

A keeper! My thankx to other contributors. These were my successful modifications: 1 loose cup dried porcini's, 2-3 cups sliced criminy mushrooms (cooked separately and added near end), dry sherry, 1/3 pound each grated gruyere and parmesian cheeses. Friends raved about the recipe--made it 2 nights in a row with different mushroom proportions for different friends...still great. Morna

This was delicious! I have made risotto the time-consuming way and this way and honestly I can't tell the taste difference so the easy way works for me! You must get some porcini mushroom bouillon cubes. I used one for the two cups liquid and then plain water to make up the four cups. Makes it rich and delicious without too much salt as the bouillons can be salty otherwise. Also sliced some white mushrooms that I had and sauteed them first before adding the onion and the garlic. Will definitely add to my cookbook!

I make this all the time now, bu I usually use white wine instead of red. And more garlic, just because my boyfriend and I are garlic lovers so I always add extra. Sometimes, I use vegetarian chicken broth instead of water and it is even more flavorful.

Sounded delicious, but it came out incredibly bland. I had to doctor it up with a ridiculous amount of cheese. I'll keep looking for better veggie risotto recipes.

I, a lover of risotto, made this recipe to try to convert my risotto-hating husband. The effort failed miserably. The flavors were so subtle they almost didn't exist. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was very blah.

Great recipe, wish I could get fresh porcini though. I used 2 cups of the mushroom liquid and 2 cups of vegetable broth for more flavor. It was perfect and my guests raved about it. I did throw in a dab of butter for creaminess just before serving.

This recipe is really great! I love the fact that no cream or butter is needed to make this risotto rich and creamy. The only thing I changed was that I cooked the mushrooms in 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. I also added more garlic than the recipe called for. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect!

I have made risotto before on many ocassions but never was it this good. The flavor was superb.

This is a great side dish for pork or lamb. I really like this recipe because it tastes wonderful AND it doesn't require the 24 minutes of constant stirring that is so characteristic of other risottos. Like other reviewers have commented, it can be bland, so I strongly suggest substituting vegetable stock for the water. Next time I'm going to try adding rosemary. A great fall dish!

i've made this recipe several times, and i absolutely love it. it is so good, and really easy. the smell alone is well worth the effort. thought having it as part of our regular rotation would ruin it for me, but i love it more each time. it's just so good.

I loved this recipe, and so did my sig. other - who is not a big risotto fan, well, before this dish. This was my first time cooking risotto, and it was so much easier than I could have even thought. Because my dried porcinis were very dirty, I discarded the soaking water, but I had the luxury of porcini boullion cubes. This definately cut the low-salt problem out - I actually found it got a bit saltier than I would usually like once the parmesan was added. Next time I'd dilute the broth,, but I still recommend using a porcini (or other mushroom) broth for flavor. The only thing was that the broth is a bit dark, and with the red wine the risotto was a bit browner than I would have expected form a risotto. Maybe too much wine? Has anyone tried white wine with success? I still think red is a better flavor here, but I don't know if I would serve a risotto that color to guests. Otherwise, it is a perfect dinner party recipe.

Great recipe, used garlic and herb boullion instead of water and didn't need too much salt after that. Only barely made enough for 4 people though, we probably couldv'e eaten double that amount! Yummy though.

Really good on a cold night. Instead of using water I used vegetable broth, which gives it a lot more flavor.

I was very disappointed with this dish. I've made many risotto recipes in the past but I won't make this one again. It's bland.

Wow, if you love risotto this one is for you. We loved it so much we served it at Christmas instead of mashed potatoes, everyone had seconds and there were no leftovers, next year we will make a double batch

This is the first successful risotto I have ever prepared. It was fantastic!! I would thouroughly recommend it, but be sure to add lots of salt to the broth... the flavor is subtle to say the least if you don't. Yum!

Very good - the mushrooms add a wonderful earthy flavour. Served with beef tenderloin and was quite a hit!

This is an excellent one-dish meal, perfect for a chilly autumn day. However, I find the flavor of porcini mushrooms a bit too earthy. So I used them to make the broth, but substituted portobello and shitake mushrooms for the chopped porcini in the risotto.

I made this dish to accompany a London Broil and it was delicious with the red wine flavor. Don't forget to add salt and pepper to the mushroom stock! Also, I added a little more parmesan cheese for extra flavor.

These people are insane. Doubling the recipe gave me about 6 servings as a main dish. Flavoring is very subtle, and I found it best served warm but not hot. Tried it with a dry white instead of red wine and it was still very good. I also get the impression that using mixed wild mushrooms would be at least as good as just porcini.

For Wild Mushroom Risotto fans there is a new version of this recipe in the September '99 issue of Bon Appetit. It is not listed in the index or "The New Batch". It is EXCELLENT and by comparison to this recipe, (probably) a lot more flavorful.

Super dish-- I loved this one. I used long-grain rice as a variation and it turned out wonderfully. As a main course, double the recipe to serve three for dinner.

This was very yummy and easy to make. I especially liked using the mushroom broth, as this gave it a stronger mushroom flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I always double the amount of porcini mushrooms.
