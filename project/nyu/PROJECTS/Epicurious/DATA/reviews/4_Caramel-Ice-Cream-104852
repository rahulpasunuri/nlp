I agree with those who love this ice cream just as the recipe is written. It will become a staple at my house!

I forgot to say in my review below that this is the perfect recipe to make use of the leftover yolks from Marcella Hazan's almond cake recipe, which requires 8 egg whites, in her book "Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking". The ice cream and the cake are also wonderful together.

Beautiful! I followed the recipe exactly, although I didn't have full-fat cream, so I used "demi-crème" with 25% fat. It was just right for me. I'm definitely repeating the recipe as often as I can.

This was very simple to make, even though the caramel (although even adding warm milk as suggested by a previous reviewer) did bubble up more than I expected! I will use a larger saucepan next time! I used six egg yolks as suggested too, this was plenty to thicken the custard. The flavour of this ice cream is exceptional and I will definitely be making this again.

not sure why 1.) people think 8 yolks is too much, i think its beautiful and adds a gelato quality. maybe they're just used to supermarket ice cream and why 2.) others would just follow their lead without trying the recipe as written at least once. its a stunning and sophisticated perfect recepie as written. try it! you'll like it!

Delicious, but needs a tweak. Thanks to the other reviewers, I used only 6 egg yolks, but still found the result too eggy and rich for my taste. Also, I let the caramel get really dark amber, like the colour of dark maple syrup. Whilst this was a yummy adult "burnt caramel" taste for me and my partner, it was hardly sweet at all and certainly would not be "kid-friendly" as suggested on the overall notes to the recipe. Next time will not let the caramel get so dark, and will try using only 2 egg yolks.

I bought an ice cream maker 3 years ago. Without exception, homemade is best -- like a whole different thing. That said, THIS recipe is a whole 'nother thing in itself. Wow! Very rich. I have trouble with caramel-based things, always takes two tries. Best to have all ingredients (eggs, cream, milk) at room temp. I used reg. vanilla instead of bean, with good results. Serving with Apple Crumble Pie from this site. Yum!

The best ice cream I've ever made. The best ice cream I've ever eaten outside of Italy. YUM!

I made this ice cream with 6 yolks as suggested. I had some trouble after adding the cream, not with bubbling, but the carmel hardening. It all turned out OK in the end, but I had a few moments of panic until it started softening into the cream. The ice cream set up nicely and I liked the flecks of vanilla bean. The flavor is sophisticated and luxurious.

I made this, as suggested, with 6 egg yolks. There can't be too many ice cream recipes that taste better than this. It's wonderful. Adding the cream straight from the fridge was not a problem; just use a big pot--like 4 qt.

Yum! My husband's fav, especially when paired with a good vanilla ice cream. Been making it since 2004!

Very VERY rich, despite the fact that I used a pint of heavy cream and a pint of 2% milk without adjusting the measurements of the other ingredients. I suspect the original recipe would be too rich for my personal taste. Adding the extra milk and cream filled my 1 ½ quart ice cream maker to capacity. The ice cream was very soft after 30 minutes of turning, but firmed up in the freezer. Nice texture.

This is a stunningly good recipie. Used only six eggs and it turned out perfect.

This is a very good ice cream, however the instructions do leave off a few important points! Most important of all, when adding the cream, make sure you first bring the cream to at least a simmer. Pouring cold cream onto the caramel mixture (which is at about 360F) will literally cause an explosion of sugar and cream all over your kitchen. Also, a pure copper pot works best for this recipe as they are the most effective at evenly distributing the heat -- thus ensuring a wonderful caramel. For those reviewers who said that it's too sweet, I think they didn't cook the sugar long enough. It really needs to be a very deep amber -- practically brown. If you don't cook it long enough, the sugars won't have completely caramelized and you'll end up with an ice cream that is significantly sweeter. Also, you must freeze this for at least 3 hours after making it to get a true ice cream consistency.

This is ridiculously good. Used 3 beans (I found them on the cheap) added a good measure of extract, too. And I used only 6 yolks. I can't imagine ever buying ice cream again when you can make this!

Simply put--amazing. Not too thick, not too heavy. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of 6 eggs instead of 8, definitely the thing to do.

Make you "wanna slap ya mamma for not making this sooner" kind of good!

I agree with previous reviewers that this is gelato, not ice cream; even with plenty of freezing, it's quite soft. I used six yolks rather than eight. It is extremely rich -- one small scoop is plenty. But my kids thought this was fabulous and I'll make another batch to go with the flourless chocolate cake with caramel sauce (easy and delicious!) for a Halloween party.

I have to agree with an earlier review- this is more like gelato than ice cream. Holy moses is it rich. Tasty, but definitely not a refreshing cool treat. It is a bit on the egg-y side, so I think that the next time I make it I'll cut the yolks down a tad.

Nothing compares to home-made caramel ice cream! This recipe is deceptively easy, and unforgetably delicious.

This ice cream has a wonderful caramel flavor, but I would definitely reduce the sugar next time I make it. That's what I think is the beauty of homemade ice cream -- you can reduce the sweetness and taste the flavor. Also, I replaced the milk with half and half, because I was making this for a special celebration and wanted something very decadent. But we all deserve that once in a while, right?

I made this ice cream as a birthday treat for a friend who loves caramel -- and it was the hit of the party. Now it's become my favourite ice cream ever, a great blend of sweetness and a little bitterness from the burnt sugar flavour. I've made it several times, and it has a consistently smooth, rich texture, though once I overcooked (scrambled) the egg yolk and had to start again.

Too much work for an ice cream that's got a lot of flavor but not really that good. It's very rich but I wouldn't consider it too rich.. Unfortunately it's hard for me to say- I made it with the poached pear recipe and I hoped they would go together but they clashed.. Fresh pear was way too fruity to go with this caramel stuff- not even granola could bring it all together.

i can´t find vanilla bean in panama, can i use vanilla extract or flavor?

This recipes produces the most creamy and delicious frozen dessert. It puts store bought ice cream to shame with its incredible texture and great taste. Make sure to use a high quality vanilla bean, fresh eggs, and good quality milk and cream. It's a must for ice cream fans.

It came out great. Of course I made some modifications. Instead of the water I used mostly Grand Marnier when I made the caramel. Also I used half and half and 1% milk instead of the whipping cream and whole milk. I am thinking about using it to top a pear crisp for a dinner party tomorrow.

Unspeakably delicious, especially if you use maple sugar in place of white sugar -- that deepens the flavor and color (plain sugar makes it a bit cloying). I recommend serving with dark chocolate chips or a small amount of dark chocolate sauce. This custardly treat is perfect for early summer dinner parties.

This ice cream is not an ice cream; ice cream you can eat a bowl full, not this one. This is decadent. This is something you serve with self restraint. It is rich, creamy, to be portioned sparingly. One scoop at most. The flavor is intense. I would serve this alone or diluted! with vanilla ice cream over peaches or pears. Almost like a frozen custard or gelato, not an ice cream. I was hoping for a light dulce de leche, but what bubbled up in the cauldron was a surprising once in a blue moon treat.
