Lovely side dish! I found it quite flavorful, not at all bland. I'll try th creme fraiche next time.

I used creme fraiche in place of the sour cream and it was great.

A very quick and easy side dish to serve with just about anything. Could add bacon or pancetta just for fun and taste. This was fine served room temp as well. I used baby spinach so no chopping was necessary.

I cook all the time, and I'm constantly trying new recipes. I've probably served 100 different dishes to my husband in the last year, and he pronounced this dish the best I'd ever made for him. It really is delicious--tangy, creamy, salty, nutty. I have no idea how another reviewer found it bland. If you make it EXACTLY as directed, it comes out very flavorful. I used a bag of prewashed baby spinach to make things simpler, and I didn't bother chopping. SO GOOD.

I happened to have some sour cream and spinach that I wanted to get rid of. This was perfect. I didn't chop up the spinach and it was just fine.

This dish was so easy to make. It was a huge hit with typical non-vegtable eating folk. I even sent the recipe to my friend after the dinner so she could make it for her other non-vegtable eating friends!

This is very bland. I added parm cheese after cooking to see if it would help, and it did not. There are many spinach recipes that are much better than this. I would not make it again.
