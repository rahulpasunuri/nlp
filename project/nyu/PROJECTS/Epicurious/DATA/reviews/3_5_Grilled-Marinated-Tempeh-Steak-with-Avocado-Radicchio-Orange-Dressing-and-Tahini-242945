I also steamed the tempeh, and chopped it up to marinate. Agree with reviewers about the marinade not soaking in... what's the point? Maybe I'll try marinating in the orange sauce next! I mixed in raw baby spinach in the salad and also added some to tempeh in a flour wrap with the leftover tahini sauce and avocado.. was very good this way and will make again.

Love the tahini sauce. I steamed the tempeh before doing anything else. I actually made veggie wrapps with the tempeh, the tahini sauce, and the orange dressing, then added some grilled marinated veggies. The sauces give new life to tempeh!

I agree about the tempeh--the marinade did nothing for it. BUT don't stop there. The tahini dressing was lovely, and the orange sauce, made from a reduction, was too. When they were combined--well, I discovered that tahini and orange are a brilliant combination. And the avocado gave it a wonderful texture ... it's quite unusual. So yes, I'd make it again and again, but I'd just chop the tempeh up or use tofu or something else--it's the least important ingredient tastewise.

Marinating the tempeh in the tahini sauce does effectively nothing. The sauce comes out really thick and doesn't actually permeate the tempeh. After grilling, the tempeh is dry. Might be better to steam the tempeh first and marinate in the orange dressing before grilling..?

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for my vegan girlfriend and carnivore sister. Both they & I thought it was great. The orange dressing plays nicely off the bitterness of the radicchio and the tahini sauce ties everything together. Keep in mind that the tempeh will not soak up the tahini, even though you do marinate. Tempeh just isn't as porous as, say, tofu. That makes the reserve tahini that you drizzle on after assembly vital. Also, I used a multigrain tempeh from Trader Joe's. The grain added a nutty flavor to the dish and helped make the meal more filling. Lastly, the tahini sauce is versatile and could be used as-is in a lot of other dishes. I was surprised at how satisfying this dish was. I made the recipe as given and wouldn't deviate from it the next time. Serve with pita bread to fully balance the meal.

I only tried the tempeh portion of this recipe, so I can't speak for the rest of it. I was hoping the "marinade" would be a good way to go with grilled tempeh, but it came out very thick for some reason and the flavors didn't really absorb into the tempeh at all. The leftover tahini sauce was a nice topping though, and I may try the whole recipe with a few adaptations at some point. But then again, probably not.
