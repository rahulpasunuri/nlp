Made this for thanksgiving in a pudding mold with no center cylinder...had to cook a bit longer than the 2hrs, but came out firm, yet moist. Sauce was sinful. Making this again for Xmas w/ the in-laws!

I made this recipe after receiving some persimmons from a neighbor's tree. The pudding did not rise -- seemed very dense. The flavors were all right, but overall I was not impressed by the recipe.

Mine came out on the heavy side, though it rose okay. The flavor was delicate and pleasant but I think I'll stick with the classic Persimmon Pudding with fruit and nuts.

I cooked this in an old mold handed down from my great grandmother. I cooked it for almost 3 hours and although it had an ok taste, it was still a bit to soft for my liking. I'd suggest measuring very accuratly as I think my generous 3/4 cup persimmon measuring may have been the problem. I also used the other kind of persimmion that in my opinion, doesn't have the same flavor. Easy to make and it looked great but I'll have to give it another try to see if I can improve the consistancy.
