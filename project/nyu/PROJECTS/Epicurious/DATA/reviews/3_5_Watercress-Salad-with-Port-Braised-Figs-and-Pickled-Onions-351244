I haven't made this yet, but the salad directions from the magazine version read: SALAD: Combine watercress, sliced endive, & pickled onion in large bowl. Toss salad with vinaigrette to coat. Drizzle Port syrup over each 8 plates. Divide salad among plates. Sprinkle figs over salads and serve.

Can anyone tell me what the last part of the Preparation is supposed to be. In the Online site it says: For salad: Combine endive, and pickled onion Toss salad with vinaigrette Port syrup over each salad among plates. Sprinkle salads and serve.

This was delicious. I used romaine as I couldnt find endive in the three stress I went to. My husband, who previously said he doesnt like fruit in his salad said this was the best salad ever! I did add goat cheese as others suggested. I will make this again for sure.

This is an excellent salad. I absolutely loved it. I made exactly as described but with more onions. It was a lot of work but I would make it again.

I made this salad for my Wine Dine Donate supper club and everyone loved it! I took note of the first reviewer's comment about the sweetness, so I added gorgonzola crumbles to offset that. I also did it as a composed salad rather than tossing everything together and then drizzled the port reduction and the dressing over the top. That seems to have fixed that. I have no idea why the onions would turn black (as happened to the second reviewer) - mine were a pretty rosy-purple color. Based on the reaction of all my guests, I will make this again!

This salad was awful overall. The figs and syrup were great, but a lot of effort to go on such a sub par salad. Also, my pickled onions turned black in the fridge - any idea why? Probably didn't help my opinion of the dish...

It was a lot of effort and just an average salad. The onions were delicious. It was a pretty salad, but a little on the sweet side for me. I'm not really sure if there's any way to make this salad better. It sounded delicious, looked wonderful, but was a little too sweet and seemed to be missing something.
