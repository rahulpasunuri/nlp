A tasty recipe, if you notice and correct for the error in Epi's instructions: the first instruction should read "Combine first FIVE [not 3] ingredients...." This division is indicated by the break between the orange peel and the strawberries in the ingredients list. Also, if you make it as instructed, you add "1 tablespoon sugar" to the berries twice, which is senseless. First 5 = cream, next 4 = berries.

Served the ricotta cream under just raspberries. We liked it, it was easy, but thought it wasn't anything special.

This is delicious but really premium quality, whole milk ricotta is the key. That was easier to find when we lived in NY than in our current home, but still doable and worth the effort. This is also good on other berries, like blackberries, and also on sliced oranges.

I must be missing something! Made recipe exact to instructions......the ricotta would have been better in my good lasagna recipe and the berries served with cream. The taste and texture was awful. Had the family over and all agreed, "Don't ever make this again...........not a 'keeper'".

I love this recipe & forgot all about it. The ricotta tastes like canoli filling, yum. It is great over berries, but for company I served it with pound cake & berries.

This recipe is similar to one an Italian friend gave me a few years back, and I have made it many times since, always to great reviews. I like pureeing the ricotta in a blender - this gives the ricotta a really light, creamy texture. I also like drizzling the cream with a bit of really good balsamic vinegar, especially if I'm serving it with berries (it's great over ripe pears or simply by itself for breakfast!).

I made this for dessert with a very large meal, but by the time it came to dessert everyone was too full, so I put out the cream sauce as kind of a dip and we just set out strawberries and dipped it as we drank for the rest of the night. It was perfect.
