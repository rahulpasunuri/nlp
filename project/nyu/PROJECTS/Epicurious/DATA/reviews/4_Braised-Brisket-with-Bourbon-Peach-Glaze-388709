This was fantastic! I actually made more rub than called for to get the whole brisket. I pureed the braising liquid with veggies as others recommended, without reducing the liquid. It was great sauce, but I had also made extra glaze for the side, and everyone went for that instead of the sauce. In the future, I'd just stick to the extra glaze and skip messing with extra braising liquids.

I made this for a group of about 16 people (doubled the recipe) on my birthday and folks were falling down over it. My boyfriend said it was the best thing he's ever put in his mouth. It's really that good.

Nach Waxman's brisket had been my go to recipe for decades. But this is a delicious alternative-almost bar- b -que in flavor thanks to the rub( if left on overnight). The glaze added a sweet contrast that did not overpower the other flavors. We didn't find it salty, maybe because I reduced the amount of beef broth-there was so much liquid already.

We thought this was really easy and very yummy. Made the day before. Served with Silky Mashed Potatoes. Blended all of the braising liquid. I think this would be great to make instead of turkey for Thanksgiving. It's a festive dish and nice served family style (over the potatoes).

One thing to mention, if you are reading this recipe on an ipad, iphone, etc, app, then know there are some typos with times and amounts. Brown the meat for 5-7 minutes (not 56 min), 3-4 tbsp of glaze (not 34), and broil for 5-6 min (not 56). If you can perfect this dish, then its a solid, very good meal. As written, I dont think its perfect, but if you read through the reviews, I think you can get some great ideas to make it better. Like a previous reviewer stated, its an extremely salty, even using a low sodium broth. If I were to make this again, which I wont, Id still use the low sodium broth and cut the salt in the rub by half (at least), and I would increase the smoked paprika (we used a smoky chipotle paprika) and cinnamon. I took the advice of other reviewers and pureed all of the vegs in the sauce, instead of reducing it (which would have made it inedibly salty). Also reduce the cooking time. We had a 3.5 lb brisket, reduced the cooking time to 3 hours, and still found it a little dry. I also agree that the glaze sauce really makes this dish. Its a good and sloppy crowd pleaser for the right crowd. Theres nothing elegant or delicate about it, so if you enjoy really bold flavors, give it a try. ☺

I used Swanson Reduced Sodium beef broth. The recipe was so salty that it rendered the brisket almost inedible. The recipe uses too much salt. I am removing the fat from the sauce and diluting it with equal parts of homemade chicken stock. I'll reduce some, add the bourbon and jam, and try to save it. I'll prepare a mirepoix of new vegetables and add to the remaining sauce and hope for the best.

Wonderful flavor. Made great sandwiches, sliced thin with a bit of horseradish. I had a 4 pound brisket and cooked it for 4 hours and felt that I probably could have removed it from the oven sooner. It was still juicy and deliciious, just didn't hold shape as well. Definitely time consuming!

This was the most amazing brisket EVER! I cooked two briskets in a foil pan on a grill with indirect heat and smoked it with cherry wood chips. Puréed vegetables and added to sauce. Broiled on cookie sheet as recommended. Fed 20 people for the Kentucky Derby. Even kids came back for seconds. Ed Lee, you are a genius!!

Wish I had followed the suggestion of pureeing the veg with broth to thicken it, but it was delicious as was.(wanted a lot of broth so did not reduce liquid). Had a thought the next day. After @ 4 hrs it was tender. Why not mix the jam with just the bourbon, slather it on top and bake the last half hour uncovered. I think the flavor would soak in the meat better than broiling it.

Delish - my husband immediately requested that this go into the rotation. I took the advice of pp and broiled on a baking sheet. Added only a 1/4 cup or so of the braising liquid to the glaze: next time I, too, will puree the veggies with the liquid, but didn't have time to yesterday. Yum!

Marvelous layering of flavors. My briskets were large - 6# apiece - so I braised them in 9 x 14 pyrex dishes, covered with aluminum foil. I used less broth and Guinness, largely because the briskets nearly filled the pyrex. The vegetables, removed from the braising liquid, made a wonderful topping/side dish, along with the reduction. 12 pounds of brisket served 15 (including 4 college age boys) with a pound or two left over. I will definitely make this again. Huge success.

This will be my brisket recipe from now on. Followed recipe ingredients exactly using 4.5 brisket which I cooked for about 3 hrs. and it was perfect. I used an immersion blender in the gravy to puree the vegetables - didn't need to reduce because there was tons of flavor. Don't put gravy on before browning the fabulous glaze. Not sure why anyone would do that - just drizzle on after slicing and serve on the side.

So good! We had a 6lb brisket that we purchased at Costco (coudn't find a 4lb, as nothing is small at Costco). I increased the recipe by 50% to accomodate for the increased mass of the brisket. I followed the recipe exactly; the rub, the rest time and the ingredients, except I added a tablespoon or two of tomato paste. For the stout, I used Murphy's and for the bourbon I used Maker's Mark (quite smooth). I cooked mine for 4 hours and it was over temp. Next time, I will start checking at 3 hours. Despite being over temp it was still pull apart tender. The glaze is over-the-top amazing. The broil/glaze step is fantastic. I recommend this and will make it again.

Rarely do I write a review - but this recipe deserves one! It was a little time consuming but so worth it! My family loved it, including my young children!

This was a hit, at my dinner party

This was a hit, at my dinner party. However, I had to tweak a few things, after reading the reviews. #1, I only had to sear the brisket for about 20 minutes on one side-- 57 minutes would have been way too long! I didn't realize I had to add the rub the night before, but it still turned out great. I used regular paprika, didn't have smoked. No problemo. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste. I wanted a deeper tomato flavor. I used the stout and the bourbon in the braising sauce. Delicious! I tweaked how to use the peach jam. I had a jar of homemade jam and braising liquid, then thought why in the world does this need to be pureed? Good call, as I simply whisked enough strained braising liquid, and bourbon into 1 cup of peach jam to be a bit thick for basting. I brushed some peach jam directly onto the brisket and broiled it for about ten minutes on a foil-lined sheet pan, basting another time in between. The brisket was super moist and so flavorful! I served the reserved braising liquid-peach jam on the side. A friend, who is a chef, said it was the best brisket he's ever had. I would definitely make this again. I can't wait to post/share this on my food blog!

Oh Yes! This was SOOO good. We had almost a 4 Lb brisket and got only 5 "servings" out of it! No one could get enough. Was a little short on bourbon so had to make the glaze with rum - it didn't suffer. Can't wait to make it again. Next time will make a day ahead to let the goodness develop.

As good as though you were eating at Magnolia--but credit where it's due! Ed Lee's amazing restaurant is in Louisville KY, not NC.

I made this last night for a birthday dinner, and it was great. I made about 9lb of meat (2 4.5lb briskets), and it was enough to feed 22 people with no leftovers. The glaze & braising liquid were both great, very flavorful. I skipped the broiling step due to time/oven constraints but it was fine. It was a big hit and I'll definitely be making it again.

This was really good. I started the recipe on Wednesday, and just finished it up at 3pm Friday. The meat is really tender, with a slightly sweet taste. A hunk of French or Italian loaf bread is necessary to mop up the juices and help clean your plate. Needs to be served with Gratin Potatoes and maybe steamed carrots and broccoli.

Spectacular! The reviews convinced me this was worth trying and it was even better than I expected. I'm still getting compliments from my guests a day later. I followed the recipe as is, but doubled the smoked paprika and cinnamon. I also put the brisket on a cookie sheet to broil the glaze. It smelled and tasted wonderful!

I made this for company with Great results! I had a 2 pound brisket for the 4 of us and baked it about 4 hours which was a little too long. The meat was good but a little bit dry and it wanted to shred. I didn't buy stout and used a PBR otherwise followed the recipe. The glaze is not very strong. I think the addition of the braising liquid dilutes it too much, maybe half would be better. I passed the braising liquid and glaze. I should have pureed the veggies in/with the braising liquid for more flavor. Next time I will remove the brisket from the pot and put it on a baking sheet or broiler pan before broiling. Using the pot under the broiler was a BIG mistake. The pot got really blackened and the smoke coming out of the oven was a problem so I had to take it out before the 4-5 minutes was up. My guests loved it!!

This was EPIC. Go make it. Right now.

Really great recipe. A lot of work (as far as time involved) but worth it for a special occasion. Did everything by the recipe (save for browning it on medium high heat and broiling it for just 30 minutes at the end on the bottom rack as to not burn it). Really yummy and received rave reviews! Didn't have any problems with the rest of the recipe. Even the kids loved it (without extra uncooked glaze at the end!) Will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe exactly and ran into a couple of problems. One, although I used a heavy Dutch oven, browning the meat undisturbed on high heat for 5 minutes completely charred the first side. I would suggest using medium-high instead. Two, pureeing the glaze completely liquefied it after only one pulse of the blender. I suggest using somewhat less brazing liquid in the glaze, maybe none at all.

This was exceptional. I do suggest making sure that you have trimmed the fat to the suggested height-otherwise the glaze won't ever reach the meat. I mean, who wants to bite through a 1/2in of fat to get to the meat and have that amazing glaze in one bite! Other than user error, this was delicious...

This is one of the best brisket recipes I've ever tried. I followed the recipe with one exception. After letting the rub sit on the brisket I popped it into my smoker at around 200 degrees for three hours with some pecan wood. After that I removed it and continued to follow the recipe to completion. The brisket had a nice smoke flavor that worked well with the braising liquid and glaze. A definite keeper!

Great recipe -- the brisket was flavorful and very tender, and the peach glaze was a nice touch. Will be making this for company soon.

Sooo Delicious! the reduced liquid can be salty, but there is so much meat, it doesn't tastes as salty when eaten with the meat. The peach glaze yummy! Also the discarded veggies from the braising liquid are pretty tasty. Looking forward to making it again for company.
