Very good and quick dinner... Follow the suggestions - canned tomato, add garlic, crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. Easy and delicious. Could easily serve to company

This was an easy, delicious dish! I used canned tomatoes as suggested to save time. I wouldn't change a thing. Don't skip adding the basil!

Could have used canned tomatoes to make it easier and would definitely use more tomatoes than the recipe calls for.

I followed everything in the recipe. The dish came out better than I expected. This will be my "turn to" pasta dish. It is very easy to make and does not take too much time to cook.

Tasty, but for me the vodka taste was over powering. Will make againw ith less vodka

Contrary to the other cooks, I am not a tomato fan so I only used the sun dried tomatoes. Substituted green onions for the scallions and added a fair amount of crushed red pepper. Delicious. I am making it again tonight, in fact.

Good, fairly simple recipe. I subbed in capers for sun-dried tomatoes, whole milk for whipping cream and canned tomatoes for fresh, so really lots of modifications. Also added a little red onion. My 3 year old really enjoyed it, as did the rest of the family.

My family loved this dish. The leftovers were also delicious after a day in the fridge. I substituted canned diced plum tomatoes (drained) because the fresh in our store were not ripe. Canned was easier than seeding and chopping fresh and tasted great.

Delicious! Will definitely make this again. A couple of modifications - I added some scallops and sliced mushrooms. I sprinkled a little crushed red pepper, and will probably add a touch more next time. I didn't use as much shallot as called for, but I think that was a mistake. The vodka-cream sauce is amazing and not too strong. Give it a try, you won't regret it.

This was a great recipe-I used low carb pasta -so it was diabetic friendly. I served it for a dinner party and it got rave reviews

I should've known! Bon Appetit did a similar version of this in February 1999, but omits the cream for a tomato-based sauce (including red pepper flakes, chx broth, white wine), and calls for penne instead. This was okay but lacked kick. Check out "shrimp with asparagus and penne" in the search engine.

This recipe is great for dinner with friends - it's super easy and looks elegant. I almost always get asked for the recipe.

Sorry . . one more important comment I failed to mention in last review: I replace the linguine with bowtie pasta. It holds and soaks the flavor in.

Rating: 3
I have made this dish numerous times. It is on our list of regular dishes. However, I have, like the last reviewer found it to be less tasty at times than others. But I think I've figured out why: Don't skimp on the tomatoes--I've learned to throw in extra and always try to choose the juiciest (not hot house) ones I can find--vine or roma typically. Also, be generous with the sun-dried tomatoes. When the tomato flavor comes out, this is a heavenly dish. My husband eats a half loaf of french bread with it, soaking the bread in the delicious sauce. Hope this is helpful.

This is a great, easy-to-make recipe: I skip the regular tomatoes (just use sun-dried), usually use large, frozen shrimp, white wine instead of vodka, and also add fresh parmasan cheese in at the end. My husband is French and a fabulous cook, so I am hard pressed to compete with either him, or his notoriously French mother, who can never be surpassed in any way, let alone in the kitchen. Let's just say that my success with this pasta has put me in the running. That's the best compliment I can give to any recipe!

Delicious -- I subbed in white wine, used less cream, added red pepper flakes, and left out the plum tomatoes entirely. I will definitely make this dish in that way again. The shrimp, asparagus, and sundried tomatoes were wonderful together.

Easy and quick weeknight dish that everyone liked. Skipped the sundried tomatoes - none on hand, but did add red pepper and garlic. Good leftovers for reheating for lunch the next day

This was an easy recipe that I will make again. I too added garlic and red pepper flakes. It gave it more flavor. I also added parmesean at the end to make it a little more creamy. It's a good recipe to use any vegetables that you have leftover.

My sister said this recipe was a "delicous keeper", and my husband, who is picky about shrimp, goobled it up! I enjoyed it very much and found it is another great recipe for my favorite vegetable. I did grill the shrimp, since I know my husband will eat grilled shrimp.. Other than that, I may have added more spice to mine, but thought the recipe was perfect as is. I didn't think the vodka was strong at all. Very yummy, and easy.

Rating: 4
I gave this four forks because my sister said it was definetly a "delicous keeper", and my husband, who is skeptical of shrimp, goobled it up! I thought is was very good, and will definetly make it again. I grilled the shrimp, and some chicken, since I know my husband likes grilled shrimp, and added it to the rest of the dish. I probably spiced it up more, but other than that I thought the recipe was perfect! I could barely even taste the vodka, so I wouldn't say it was too strong. I've found another new recipe for one of my favorite vegetables!

I doubled the recipe with 1 lb. shrimp/1 lb. bay scallops and made this for 8 people and everyone loved it! There was a lot left over even after people had seconds & thirds. I did add garlic and red pepper flakes to it which gave it more flavor. Will definitely make again!

Interesting combination of flavors. VERY GOOD!!!

Rating: 3
Delicious but a bit bland for me. More pepper flakes and a lot more garlic would have helped. It was yummy with added cilantro instead of basil (I love it with shrimp). I also subbed snow peas for asparagus, which held their color well and gave it some crunch. Overall quite good, but needs some tweaking to keep it interesting -- at least for me, since I clearly love Asian-influenced dishes. Will make again in some form or another!

I preferred the leftovers to the original serving. Seemed the flavors had more time to meld. I changed a couple things: used fat free half n half in place of whipping cream, then added some chicken stock to minimize the very stron vodka taste, and used dried basil (no fresh on hand). Next time I would use about a 1/4 cup of vodka or less. This rates about a 2.5. Good not delicious. Nice to have all food groups in one bowl...

Very good! Easily made ahead of time & reheated on a low flame. Saute the shrimp & asparagus separatly. Helps to keep them both from being over cooked. Needed red pepper flakes, garlic & salt & pepper.

Was great for my engagement party. Many asked for the recipe. I used POMI instead of fresh tomatoes (saving time) and replaced scallops for asparagus. I used heavy cream rather than whipping cream for a thicker sauce and make extra pot of sauce on side. Also used freshly grated 3 cheese blend (container) to add flavor....would definitely make for all future parties.

Rating: 3
An excellent base recipe. Beautiful color presentation. Leaves plenty of room for improvisation, making modification to suite nearly any palate or menu a breeze. Making fresh tomato concasse instead of using canned prevents color bleeding and sauce thinning. The elimination of the extra water and the addition of the roux made for perfect sauce consistency. Also consider deglazing with Sambucca, using equal parts julienne fennel bulb and shallots. Substitute fresh fennel leaves for basil.

I am a personal chef and everytime I make this for my clients I get raves. I add a little bit of white wine and thicken it with a little roux. Yumm!!

Rating: 3
This dish was remarkably easy to make; be sure to set your water for the pasta boiling as soon as you begin preparing as cooking the sauce too long makes the asparagus a little mushy. I added a clove of garlic and will use some red pepper flakes next time. Also, I didn't add the entire 1/2 cup of additional water to the sauce as I thought it would become too runny. I will make this one again.

Living on the coast, the seafood is great. I am always looking for great new recipes. Both my husband and I loved it, as did a single friend who stoppped by the next night and had it reheated. My neighborhood grocery store didn't have the sundried tomatoes, so I subsituted Classico creations sun-dried tomato sauce & spread, which I will use when I make it again.

Yummy. I added salt, pepper, a clove of fresh garlic & red pepper flakes. Makes lots more than recipe says.

We enjoyed this dish but made some changes. We used half bay scallops and half shrimp. We also added red pepper flakes and garlic and quite a bit of salt and pepper. It definitely would have been too bland without the extra seasoning. At the very end of preparation we added some goat cheese to the sauce which complimented the flavors nicely and also thickened the sauce a bit.

I really liked the idea of this recipe. But after making it it wasn't as good as it sounded. I think I will make it again but with a few modifications. It was a bit bland. Will add dried red pepper, and other seasoning.

This is very good and most importantly, can be made very quickly, especially on a week night when time is of the essence but you still want to eat something tasty. Since I like to experiment I've coincidentally been making pasta in this combination but without the vodka from before I saw the recipe. I now enhance it with the addition of vodka.

tasty, although I was expecting more of a typical "pink" vodka sauce from the ingredients, while this was more of a creamy, vegetable sauce. Still the flavors of shrimp, vodka and asparagus meld nicely.

This is a keeper! I followed the recipe to the letter and it delighted my dinner guests, both culinary connoisseurs. This recipe provides a delicious array of flavours with elegant subtlety. And so quick and simple! The combination of vodka, cream and basil is genious. Excellent recipe for cook-ahead entertaining...re-heated leftovers were better than the same-day meal.

This was quite good. I made it without deviating too much from the recipe, and it was a hit with both my husband and my toddler. I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes (none of us like them very much) and added garlic and red pepper flakes while cooking the shrimp. The portions were enormous, but it reheated beautifully (over low heat on the stove - this would probably die in a microwave). This was quick, pretty, and tasty. A definite keeper. Any wine suggestions?

Rating: 3
Aside from the torture of peeling & deveining medium sized shrimp and peeling & seeding a pound of plum tomatoes, this was super quick and delicious. Holds really well as leftovers the next day - dare I say I enjoyed the leftovers more than when it was first out of the pot. A DEFINITE KEEPER.

My guests and I really enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have quite enough shallots, and so I added two cloves of garlic. I also used light cream instead of whipping cream. I thought that the vodka added a distinct and delicious taste to the sauce. I'll definitely make this again. Yum!

Very, Very Good. I made this just as written and my guests loved it. It DOES make generouse servings and I thought it did NOT heat up well the next day. It got rather oily, not the creamy presentation from the night before. Next time I might cut back a little on the sun-dried tomatoes.

Very fast and easy. I did substitute whole milk instead of cream to cut down on the fat content. I did not have fresh basil on hand, so substituted the dried variety, which also worked well. The recipe is definitely a keeper.

I wanted to make this recipe, but I didn't have all the right stuff so I improvised-I used cooked shrimp which was fine,I used broccoli instead of asparagus which I thought was ok too. I used canned diced tomatoes for the plum. Which I thought might have been too strong. I didn't have anything to substitute for the dried tomatoes so I left them out,and I didn't have any whipping cream.So I used evaporated milk which I think also worked fine. Even though I made a whole new recipe out of it we thought it was wonderful. I am making it again tonight with all of the ingrediants Iam not sure that it could be a lot better-I'll let you know.

Excellent and easy to make. I have made for dinner partys as well as office pot-lucks, it reheats pretty well without making the shrimp tough. I have subsituted snow peas when asparagus wasn't available. I have also tried making it with tequila instead of vodka which works as well.
