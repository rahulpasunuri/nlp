This was a nice alternative to the creamy, mayonnaisey potato salads; however, I found that it needed more of the vinegar and mustard to keep it from being bland. Also, it is much better warm than at room temperature. On the other hand, my husband loved it.

I have made this simple recipe mine. My kids dont like mayo based potato salads, and this is a great alternative. I modified by using a bit of basalmic vinegar, garlic powder and an aromatic olive oil. Served warm tastes better than cold.

Very nice, very simple potato salad! I was afraid it would be a little bland but my cupboard was a bit bare so I tried it. My husband won't eat mayo so he loved this dressing. I definately agree that steaming the potatoes gives better flavor and I at least doubled (if not tripled) the vinegar - also used red wine vinegar instead of cidar. Very tasty!

I'm afraid I found this recipe dry and boring. I guess I need mayo and veggies in my potato salad.

I make this one pretty often, it's much lighter than regular potato salad and fast too. For these types of potato salads I find that the potatoes are MUCH tastier if steamed instead of boiled. This salad is also good when lemon juice is used instead of vinegar, and throwing in a few blanched sugar snap peas is good too, if you get nice sweet ones.

I love that this recipe was for two since I only have to feed my husband and myself.My husband refuses to eat any creamy like dishes so when I find a new way for us both to enjoy potato salad I am thrilled!
