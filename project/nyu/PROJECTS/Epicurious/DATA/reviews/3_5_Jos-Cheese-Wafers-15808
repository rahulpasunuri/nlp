I make these crackers every year (for years) and I have to make so many now as gifts it's ridiculous! They are much loved and people fight over them. I have never had a problem - just don't cut them thick. They keep as long as they don't disappear and freeze very well.

I make these every Christmas and they are a favorite with everyone. Anyone who has had bad results may have sliced them too thickly. They must be very thin and they must not be undercooked! I cook them probably about 15 minutes.

These cheese wafers are absolutely delicious! I first made them at Thanksgiving and have already made them 5 more times for parties! The key is to bake them until they're golden brown; if they're too pale, the taste is bland. At my MIL's request, I added a little extra cayenne to my last batch & those may have been even better. The wafers have been such a hit, I've started giving rolls of the frozen dough as gifts.

These addictive little bites are so tasty! I made them for a recent family gathering and every crumb was gone. As suggested in other reviews, I baked them until the edges browned which took about 15 minutes in my oven. I have also tried freezing some and then baking them, which are equally delicious. A couple of these rolls will find a permanent residence in my freezer as they would go great with soup, as an appetizer, hostess gift, or just when you need a nibble. Yum.

my mother begged me to make these for a holiday party and I must admit I was skeptical about the way they would turn out. but boy, it was all I could do to stop from eating each batch when they came out of the oven. I ended up adding a teaspoon of salt to the recipe and instead of one cup of pecans I used two cups of rice krispies which gave the wafers a nice texture and crunch. also I just shaped the dough into balls and pressed them down with a fork. as other reviewers noted it is very important to wait until the wafers are brown. I ended up baking them for a least five extra minutes. so so good.

These are fantastic. I made them for a party and people couldn't get enough of them. Be sure to watch them carefully - you want them golden brown but not too brown or they become bitter. My own tip: put paper towel on the cooling rack and let the wafers cool on the paper. It soaks up the excess grease and makes them leave fewer greasy fingerprints on the glasses. I also found they looked nicer on the plate than those that had cooled directly on the rack (fewer crumbs sticking to them).

I can't get over that only 88% would make this recipe again. The first time I made it for a Christmas gathering EVERYONE wanted the recipe. My kids know it's Christmas when Mom starts making the wafers and if I don't... watch out. People have been known to stand at the oven door for fresh batches to come out!

Definitely increase the cooking time to allow them to brown and crisp up. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and sprinkled them with sea salt immediately after taking them out of the oven - good idea. I will add a bit more cayenne next time, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail snack to have on hand during the holidays - the batch size and taste make the (fairly minor) effort well worth while!

These were easy to prepare, addictively delicious, and an extra log or two is great to have on hand in the freezer for surprise guests.

My guests and I liked these a lot. By baking them in batches, I learned a little longer is best: make sure they're golden when you take them out, that way they're crispy.

I have been making cheese straws for years, but this is the best recipe ever. Foolproof and delicious and perfect for the holidays!

Two & 1/2 is probably a more accurate review for me. Well received at two parties, with 4 more logs in the freezer to go. Not exactly what I was expecting, but worth the try. (Update: logs 4-8 were much better when I baked them longer. I'll make again.)

I though that these crackers were okay, not great. Not worth the time.

My goodness, these were nasty! Made them for a party and they were hardly touched. I thought they were difficult to work with. I would not make them again.

These were terrific. I like them better seved slightly warm otherwise the butter in it seems to cold. I had not trouble with them falling apart, I was sure to mix them well with a heavy duty mixer to blend the dough until it really bound together.

These are sensational and very addictive. Beware, though....they are soooooo bad for ya.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but when they were done baking they just crumbled off the pan. My hubby and I were tasting them and there were very yummy except that they just fell apart. I followed the recipe exactly... anyone else have this problem?

These are delicious. I found, however, that the salt sticks better if you salt them immediately after removing from the oven. Then you also save the step of turning them all over.

Terrific and couldn't be easier! I cut this recipe in half because I plan to serve to a small gathering and thought it made more than I needed . I cooked a small batch for us to taste before the party and they are wonderful!! I won't top them with salt because we found they didn't need any extra. As previous reviewers suggested I added garlic and am really glad I did. Now we wait and see how the guests like them. Frankly we hope they don't - that's more for us!!

I did not follow the recipe exactly - left out the pecans and did not roll and refrigerate. I also used a tablespoon of Cayenne. I have been searching for a cheese wafer recipe like this for years. All of the others I have tried tasted more like flour with cheese. I put my dough in a cookie press and made "straws", then baked for 8 minutes. They were perfect and just what I was looking for. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

This was awful! I put the first batch in the oven tried them after they cooled and proceeded to through the rest of it in the garbage. There are way better and easier recipies to make. What a waste!! What are you people thinking.

This is a great combination of flavors and were a big hit with guests. The receipe makes lots, although I sliced mine a bit more the the 1/8 inch called for. My batches took a little longer to cook than the receipe states; my first batch ended up a little under-done. I cooked subsequent batches a few minutes longer until they were a golden brown. Tasted much better and flew off the plate once I set it down in front of guests!

This was an easy recipe to make. However, I tried to multiply it by 4. Dumb me tried to get it all into my mixer at ONCE! What a mess. In the end I had a few rolls (uncooked) left over to give to people who asked for the recipe. Their eyes lit up when I actually handed them the prepared dough. Great take home idea!

Outstanding! This is a slightly different version of a cheese wafer I have been making for years. But this recipe has replaced the earlier one because of the rave reviews I've gotten. The cheese, cayenne, pecan combination can't be beat.

This recipe gives you maximum taste for minimal effort. I have been asked for the recipe everywhere that I have brought it. Definitely a keeper.

I thought these were fair. They were really greasy right out of the oven, but firmed up really well overnight. The toasted pecans are the best part, and the cayenne gives a good kick in the aftertaste. But they're very fattening. VERY bad for you. I made them for a birthday celebration at work, though, and everyone loved them. So I think I will be making them again in the future for office parties. I won't be keeping them in my house, though. That would be sabotaging my diet!

These were delicious even though I burnt the pecans and chose not to include them. The wafers are somewhat fragile but perhaps next time when I include the pecans, they'll hold together better.

Terrific! I took these to my office and everyone loved them. I will definitly make them again this holiday season!

Wonderful! I know you are supposed to chill it, but I couldn't wait for the first batch so I hand formed coins as soon as I made the dough and it worked great. Also, I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of the hot stuff, and it was a bit much. The original amount would have been enough for me.

These make an easy and lovely holiday gift. I make the logs larger than one inch in diameter because I like a slightly larger wafer, which requires a longer cooking time. More cayenne wouldn't hurt!

Excellent. I have to make two batches, though, to keep up with demand.

This dish was easy to prepare, nice to have on hand for quick snack. Liked by the whole family, something I would, and have made several times.
