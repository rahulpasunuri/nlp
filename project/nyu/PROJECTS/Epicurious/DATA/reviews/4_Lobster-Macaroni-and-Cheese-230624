This is my second time making this recipe. I think the flavors are great and the stock really adds a great flavor to the recipe. This recipe is very involved, however, and I only make it for special occasions and if I have time to spare.

Whoa... I want to cook dinner not work the robitic arm on the Space Shuttle. This recipe is too complicated for weekday use. Fixed: Skip the seafood combo and use a 12oz lobster tail steamed 14 minutes and cubed into scant 1/2" pieces. Roux 2tbs butter and 2tbs oil with 4tbs flour. Skip the broth and use a seafood stock/base. The sauce is the roux, 2 cups seafood broth, 2 cups skim milk, 12oz cheddar, nutmeg, tarragon and white pepper. Sherry/Brandy optional. Cook until firm 1lb (NOT 8oz) pasta. Topping: 3/4cup panko, 1/2 cup grated parm, 2tbs butter mixed in frypan and sprinkle on top. Sprinkle with pimiento. Bake at 325 for about an hour in 12x12x3" dish. Serves 6-8.

This was the second time I made this recipe, and my guests were blown away! All asked for the recipe, and for seconds. I served on the side with Rack of Lamb and Roasted carrots. I did add a bit more cream, and another half pound of lobster meat, and also upped the pasta amount to a full pound. Very glad I did so I was sure there'd be plenty, and I have some leftovers for today. Well worth the time and effort.

I've made this twice now. The first time the sauce came out on the thin side (probably because I used milk instead of cream), though it was still very good. The second time I made it, the sauce came out thin again (I try to avoid cream when I can) so I put the whole thing in a lasanga dish, added some parmesan and breadcrumbs and threw it in the oven for 30 mins. It came out great, really tasty and creamy. This is a great dish - it also tastes pretty good with more shrimp and no lobster for a more budget option.

Way to thin. Used all the amount of liquids as stated. $15.00 worth of cheese plus the lobster to have a mediocre taste. I was looking for creamy...and this is not. I made a large amount of broth from 7 lobsters and made lobster bisque yesterday that was so much better. I'm going to try to bake for awhile to get it to thicken up. Like another reviewer, you need more salt than you think. I'd rather make macaroni and cheese and just add the lobster. Not worth the time and bother. Disappointed and nothing like the lobster mac and cheese I have gotten in restaurants.

WOW! This was the best macoroni & cheese we have ever eaten. The sauce made the dish and was not that difficult or messy. I cooked the shrimp while the lobster was cooking and then re-used the pan to make the sauce taking advantage of the little bits of remaining shrimp in the pan. Also took the suggestion from another reviewer and finished dish in oven with panko crumbs on top with chives. Will definately make this winner again.

This recipe was extremely disappointing - it was like lobster bisque poured over macaroni. I am an idiot for not realizing how this would taste in the first place...

Fantastic! We had our gourmet dinner group over, and I made this. The broth was time-consuming to make, but not difficult, and it created a fantastic sauce. I made the recipe times four, because we like to "seal-a-meal" leftovers for everyone. I put it all together in a huge iron casserole dish, and let it heat up at 325 degrees for an hour or so. Perfection. My changes: out of brandy, so I used a Baker's Kentucky bourbon. I sliced the fontina cheese and layered it in with the other ingredients. It blended perfectly into the sauce. I used two lobster tails, shrimp, and salmon, and as another reviewer noted each kept its flavor. The pasta absorbed the delicious sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Divine. When I first heard about lobster mac and cheese my reaction was "gross". I have changed my tune! I simplified the stock and only used the tail of a lobster (no shrimp or crab).

Okay. You're going to think I'm crazy, but I'm going to add to my review again. I made this again for Christmas eve, and my family liked it. Per my boyfriend's suggestion, I put it all in a casserole dish and cooked it a little bit in the oven, because he said that last time there wasn't enough sauce 'in' the noodles. I did this, and I agree that on the one hand it improved the dish, but on the other hand, it made it a little dry. So my point is that I really don't think that the original recipe makes too much sauce. Also, do not neglect to add enough salt. It probably needs more than you think.

I forgot to mention that because I had read other reviews that said there was a lot of sauce, and I was cooking for just 2 people, I cut the sauce in half. Half the sauce was just about right for 9 ounces of whole wheat pasta. I could have done with a tiny bit more sauce, but I think I'll solve that problem next time by adding more cheese to the sauce to add a little volume and thickness.

I would highly recommend this recipe for a special occasion (because it's expensive). I suppose that making the stock was a little time consuming, but it really wan't that bad. The thing I like is that if you're making this for company, the stock and sauteed shellfish can be prepped ahead of time. You could probably actually make the whole dish ahead of time using a little more cream, and reheat it all in a casserole. I used Gruyere instead of Fontina becuase I had a lot of it laying around, and it turned out beautifully. I was confused about just one thing--do you simmer the lobster meat with the shells, or do you sautee it with the shrimp? Like I said--this recipe was really not as difficult as some people have made it out to be. : )

Excellent dish. Our family loved it. Definitly use all the pasta as there is a lot of sauce. I broiled it for 4 minutes which was a nice touch. Served 4 and had a lot left over.

Exceptional dish! Prepared for the 1st time last night for my boyfriend, with two small changes using light cream and clam broth in place of water. It was easy and delicious! I love your Lobster Bisque recipe and make so often that I have memorized, so this was a breeze! This will be a new favorite.

Difficult, but worth the effort (for holidays)

I guess I changed this recipe around a lot but it came out delicious! I didn't make a seafood stock and didn't use the shrimp, carrots, celery, bay leaves or tomato paste. I also used sherry wine instead of brandy or cognac. Instead of cooking it all on the stove I partially cooked the pasta, drained it, mixed it with everything else and put it in a buttered glass baking dish and topped it with panko mixed with melted butter and baked it until bubbling and the top was crispy. So delicious! It was a hit!

This is so delicious. The individual tastes of each fish was complimented and not masked by the sauce. I used 1/2 AND 1/2 instead of cream to lighten it up a bit. The amount of sauce was much more than needed. Next time I will use a pound of pasta, since there was an over abundance of sauce and seafood.

Absolutely fabulous! I agree with the reviewer who said the seafood stock is time-consuming, but it is worth every ounce of your time. I have made this several times now, and I have lightened it up with light cream and even half-n-half. I am used to cooking light, so I don't think it loses the flavor. Once I used fake lobster (Lobster Delights), and the stock still came out nice using just the shrimp shells. An awesome accompinant for tuna steaks or crabcakes!

Maybe I did something wrong. But this recipe tasted like fish stock and nothing else (I tried to make it with the demi-glace shortcut). After almost 2 hours and over $60 in ingredients, I'm making a frozen pizza. It's not delivery...

This was delicious. Made as directed with no real changes except used chicken broth instead of water.

I made this dish for New Year's Eve. It was great! I was surprised...am used to macaroni and cheese more of a casserole...the sauce was very tasty.

A great dish but more complicated than it needs to be. When you have great ingredients, you don't need to fuss so much. I made a simplified version of this dish drawing more from Thomas Kellor's recipe for lobster "Mac and Cheese" which eliminates the onion, celery, garlic, cognac, and just focuses on making a realy rich stock. Also, instead of sauteing the lobster and shrimp, I used Kellor's technique of "butter poaching" -- putting the meat in melted butter and slowly heating until it's cooked through. Yum!

Delicious & very rich. My suggestion: the rendering of the various empty shells for stock is time-consuming, smelly, and messy. I did it outdoors on the grill burner to keep the inside of the home from smelling like a fish cannery. I strongly suggest using purchased shellfish demi-glace. You won't miss a thing, and the time will be cut in half, along with the mess and smell. In any event, the finished recipe is wonderful.

Absolutely delicious! Nice twist on the old macaroni and cheese casarole.

Wonderful flavor. Who says Macaroni and cheese can't be gourmet food? To make easier on me, I bought lobster tails so I could avoid the mess of working with a live, whole lobster. Just make to get good quaility lobster.

Delicious!! A must-do recipe, my husband almost licked the plate after he was done!
