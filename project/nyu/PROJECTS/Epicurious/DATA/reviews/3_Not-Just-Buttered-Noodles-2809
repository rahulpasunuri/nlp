Super quick and easy. Too bad I didn't have any fresh basil. I also added cooked prawns to make it a one-dish meal.

I was really craving pasta tonight and didn't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen so I made this recipe. It was great!! I modified it a bit according to what I had on hand- no aniseed, plain pasta shells (not tricolored), and dried basil instead of fresh. I'm sure it would have been even better with fresh basil, but I'd still make it again, even with the dried basil. The roasted red peppers were delish! Easy and a keeper.

Unexpectedly delicious. I was just looking for a different side dish and came up with this. I chopped the tomatoes and peppers in a wooden bowl with a hand chopper - not too time consuming. There was not much left over - but this dish was very good for lunch the next day.

Okay, I didn't exactly make the recipe as called for. I skipped the anise seed (had none at the time) and I cut the basil way back... about one third of what was called for. A lot of basil overwhelms my taste buds. We, my husband and I both really liked this colorful, flavorful, easy side dish. A keeper.

Real easy as long as you have everything chopped and ready to go. Nice blend of spice with the basil & aniseed.
