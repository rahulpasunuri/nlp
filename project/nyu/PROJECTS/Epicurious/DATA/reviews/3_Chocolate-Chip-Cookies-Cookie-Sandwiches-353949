These are flat, almost lacy...and FANTASTIC! I couldn't stop eating them! Check the spread on your cookies first, though. They will spread a lot! Ate these first at Disney World and came home and made them1 Yum!

Great taste, appreciate the gluten-free but needs a leavening agent. Egg or baking powder. Preferably egg because I tried baking soda and my cookies were still flat as pancakes.

There's a crispness to these you don't expect and an unusual quality... a kind of floury taste. I wouldn't say it's bad, but I didn't feel as if I'd just had a chocolate chip cookie. On the upside: coconut oil is a new star ingredient and I have been trying it in other baking where a very light coconut can be a good thing.

Delicious! i was somewhat doubtful of these at first, but i figured i'd give it a try. A friend recommended that i be careful that the coconut oil had softened butter consistency (bc its heat sensitive). I have no reason to eat gluten free, but I will be making these again, and I think you should too!
