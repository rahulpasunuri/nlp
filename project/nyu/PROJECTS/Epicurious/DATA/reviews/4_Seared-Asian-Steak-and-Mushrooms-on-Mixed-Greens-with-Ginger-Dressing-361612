Family and I loved this recipe, felt it was restaurant quality. I too doubled the amount of mushrooms, mixing in some portabellinis, what umami! I used this recipe as an appetizer and it generously portioned into 10-12 nice starter salads for a formal Friday night dinner. A real treat & easy to make.

Minus switching out the rib eye for a less expensive cut, I followed the recipe and it was fantastic. Simple meal that tastes excellent!

Loved this! I grilled flatiron steak on the bbq, and added minced garlic to the sauteed mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe. Oh, one more edit.. I doubled the quantity of mushrooms. 2oz/serving seemed too little to me, but I love mushrooms on steak! Everything was awesome! Served with brown rice, and asian avocado salsa (this site) with chips to start. Great casual dinner.

As one reviewer, I switched out the rib eye for skirt steak due to cost. Loved the dressing for the mixed greens. Would definitely make again, although I might skip the beef.

A delicious and easy meal - just a little prep. Pretty much stuck to the recipe and will make this again and again.

OMG the dressing is SUPER YUMMY! We all loved this recipe. The kids (3 & 5) ate up all their mixed greens and mushrooms, which is rare!

Perfect summer meal! Easy and flavorful. I doubled the dressing recipe to use on other salads. Will put this in my "repeater" file.

This is a wonderful recipe. I was worried the sesame seeds would burn on the steak, but they didn't, and my stove cranks out 22,000 BTUs on one burner. We made it with the Spicy Napa Cabbage Slaw with Cilantro Dressing instead of using the mixed greens and drizzled the soy dressing over the steak. AMAZING! I'm looking forward to leftovers on the greens for lunch tomorow :-)

Great recipe! Add caramelized onions to the mushrooms and brown sugar to the dressing for a sweeter flavor.

I thought that this was a delicious recipe. I really enjoyed the salad dressing. Thought it was perfectly balanced. Tangy and sweet with just a touch of spiciness. Would definitely make this again. May even use the salad dressing by itself without steak and mushrooms.

Delicious. I used skirt steak instead, which was fine. And instead of mixed greens, I sauteed some napa cabbage and put it all over some Jasmine rice. For the kids, I left off the sesame seeds and sauce and they liked it too.

Excellent and easy.

Tasty, but not out-of-this-world. I would grill the steak next time since I thought it was a bit bland. Dressing was delicious. I increased the amount of ginger and cilantro.

This salad was delicious but the dressing had too much ginger. I think 1/2 T would work perfectly, and that's what we'll use next time. Otherwise, it was really, really good and we will definitely make it again. Served it with sticky rice and it was a very satisfying but light dinner.

Delicious! And so simple. The steak really tastes great with the sesame seeds. The dressing was a bit sour (may have been the chili sauce I bought) so I added some honey to sweeten it up. Overall, easy and light, but tastes great too.

This salad is fantastic. I made 2 portions, used all the mushrooms, made all the dressing, and used a 12-oz rib- eye. I didn't have any Asian chili- garlic sauce so I just cooked the mushrooms with some garlic, and used regular hot sauce. I don't think you have to cut the sesame oil with that much veg oil. Oh, also, when I was carving the steak, I threw the mushrooms back in the skillet to get them hot in the steak juices. Yum. I'm definitely putting this on regular rotation. I used a cast-iron skillet and it worked beautifully.

I loved this recipe. I thought the flavors blended so nicely and made an authentic Asian meal. The downside is, my husband (surprising) and kids (not so surprising) didn't like it at all. So unfortunately, will be unlikely to make again, as I will be eating alone!

HELP..... I am making this for the first time on Saturday night - the recipe looks way too good to no make it! We are having two other couples for dinner, no worries - double th quantities....My question is what to serve with this - perhaps as a starch? While I will be sereving a few appies and a simple dessert, I am worried that this isn't a very filling meal. One thought I am having is to add some brown rice to the salad - rice keeps the Asian theme and rice adds the starch... Anyone have any ideas???? Thanks!!!

I will echo what the other reviewers said - this recipe was fantastic. My husband said during dinner "I am finally coming around to salads as a main meal." I agree with others that a little dressing goes a long way, but I would still make the extra dressing (just in case). There's just two of us so we used about a 14 oz steak and kept the rest of the amounts the same. Loved it and already looking forward to making it again.

Tasty Tasty Tasty. I will add some more mushrooms and make extra dressing next time. I was totally satisfied with this meal though.

This was very good. I added more soy, a little lime, and more rice vinegar in the dressing. Used nice ribeyes, needed more than 2-3 min per side for med-rare even though I tenderized and pounded them. Used some sesame oil, garlic for the mushrooms- used a combo of baby bellas and shitake. Added Italian parsley and cilantro to the salad, added a little more dressing onto the steak. For a side, made "asian" roasted heirloom cherry tomatoes: lots of minced ginger (leftover from chopping too much), thinly sliced garlic, lots of cilantro, sesame oil. Came out delicious- would definitely make again- only complaint is that it looks really messy on the plate, but we cleared both of ours!

Great steak salad I will certainly use this again, Next time I'm thinking Grilled Chicken would be great. Hubby loved it, really surprising.

Heres a mouth watering dinner salad that is fun to make too. Rib-eye steak with baby bella mushrooms are a delectable combination, and the ginger in the asian dressing gives it a nice punch of flavor. I added a cup of cilantro to the lettuce greens and it tasted great. The dressing would also be perfect on a cucumber salad or as a marinade. I agree with another poster that a little dressing goes a long way. Therefore, I opted to increase the amount of greens and cilantro. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/seared-asian-steak-and-mushrooms-on-mixed-greens-with-ginger-dressing/

This was surprisingly good. I thought the salt/pepper/sesame preparation would be over-simple (read, tasteless), but it was NOT! The steak came out perfectly with such a simple preparation. Since there's less of us, I opted to put individual salad portions on each plate and add and toss the dressing on each. If you do this, please beware that a little of the dressing goes a long way -- or it will be over salty or sour.

Delicious meal that was pretty easy to put together. I too substituted sriracha into the dressing, but I assume that was what was implied by the ingredient "chili-garlic sauce". An excellent dish.

Wonderful! Easy, quick, and delicious. The dressing was well balanced with excellent flavor. I did add 1/8 tsp of Sriracha sauce but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This could easily be made vegetarian with substitution of tofu for beef. I also added some avocado that I had on hand and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Try this-if you love Asian flavors, it will become a favorite!
