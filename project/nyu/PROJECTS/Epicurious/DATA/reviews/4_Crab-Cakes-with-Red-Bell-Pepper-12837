I quadrupled this recipe to serve at a dinner at a colleague's house. Everyone loved them! I didn't have plain breadcrumbs, so I used italian. I also didn't have time to boil eggs and use them, so that was left out. I made a roasted red pepper aioli sauce to go on top instead of tartar and I think that made the dish even that much better. I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe. I have kept it as a staple for when I need a quick but impressive meal. I agree that egg isn't nessary. I have never fried these crab cakes.. A nonstick skillet with a spray of olive oil has always worked well for me. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This is my go-to recipe for crab cakes, tho I will say they always fall apart. One day I will figure out a good binder. (I despise mayo and won't touch it unless I make it myself, which ain't happening for this.) I never use the hard-boiled egg. Usually I eat these over simply dressed salad (splash of lemon juice and splash of good EV olive oil) with a recipe from this site for roasted tomatoes with anchovies (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ROASTED-TOMATOES-WITH-ANCHOVIES-GARLIC-AND-PARSLEY-103459) -- After they're done, I just puree the tomatoes with a little chicken stock and heavy cream, then spoon that over the cakes. So good.

We just had the crab cakes for dinner. We left out the hard-boiled egg and used panko instead of the white bread crumbs. We pan fried them. They were good but did not stick together well. I would make them again with more binder.

VERY DELICIOUS. Thanks to all the cooks who recommended baking over frying. A lighter and healthier option! Another thanks to those who suggested : 1.) before baking - refrigerate, 2.) omit the egg, 3.) bake @ 325 for 15 min, & 4.) brush melted butter at the very end. We really enjoyed it. We also omitted breadcrumbs (don't eat flour) and substituted rice flour instead - and they held together perfectly. I was in & out of the kitchen in 20 minutes, and got a rewarding foot massage afterwards...

First time making crab cakes and they were delicious! My boyfriend absolutely raved. I omitted the boiled egg as some other reviewers suggested, and used panko crumbs instead of fresh. They came out perfect!!!

Amazing! My boyfriend and I loved these and he agreed it was probably the best meal I've made! Definitely add one whole beaten egg and refrigerate before broiling to keep the cakes together. I added two minced green onions. I also omitted the hard boiled eggs.

Overall, this was very good. I did need to add more bread crumbs to keep them from falling apart, and I found that the peppers were a little overpowering. In the future, I would use less.

The EASIEST and TASTIEST crab cake recipe i have tried. I did add scallions when sauteing the red bells and used Old Bay Seasoning in place of salt.Forget the hard boiled eggs (don't know the point). Baking them makes them light, crisp and flavorful (and non-greasy). Adding the melted butter at the last 5 minutes gives them a beautiful brown color. I accompanied them with a red bell pepper coulis (with added hot sauce for zip) and a mesclun salad dressed in a white balsalmic viniagrette. Served it for lunch. AWESOME!

I'd actually rate this a 2.5 forks. I found that my crab "batter" was very, very runny. Did anyone else have this problem? I had to add about 1/2 cup more breadcrumbs to get rid of the excess water/red pepper juice. I also baked my cakes and it turned out quite nice. I served it with homemade tarter sauce and my roommate and her boyfriend both really liked it. I myself was not a big fan (it was too rich).

If I could give this 3.5 forks I would! Yum yum! I made some alterations as others suggested: since I was feeding four I used 1 lb. of crab and a whole red pepper (did not double the butter though). I omitted the hard boiled egg altogether. I used a whole beaten egg and 1/2+ C of the fresh bread crumbs to hold them together. I pressed the mixture into a 1/3C measure to form the cakes and then put them in the fridge to chill. (This made 8 perfect cakes.) As others rec'd, I also baked them in a 325 oven for 15 minutes, put a little melted butter on top and broiled them for 5 more minutes to make them beautiful. They were superb and I got high marks from my husband, my step-son, and his girl-friend. We had asparagus on the side and finished the meal with chocolate fondue...Happy Valentine's Day! These are definitely impressive, beautiful, and worthy of making over and over.

YUMMY! This is a great recipe. I used a food processor to mince the red peppers and then drained them on paper towels. Skipped the egg but didn't miss it at all. Nice quick meal to make ahead of time and impress your guests.

My husband and I liked these crab cakes. Instead of making 4 large patties, I made smaller ones and served them with a mixed green salad. We liked the combo, but I almost felt like it got too rich towards the end of the meal. Maybe I at too much! ;)Very tasty though and I recommend baking on a lightly oiled baking sheet to cut the fat as one of the previous reviewers said.

I made these for Mothers Day. They were a big hit. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and baked them at 325 for 15 minutes. They weren't browned enough so I spooned some melted butter on them and increased the temp to 425 for 5 minutes. They were beautiful.

I am an irish meat/potato kinda girl married to a fish/seafood lover. I have never made this before, and tried it for the first time on VALENTINES DAY of all days. Its a great recipe. Added extra egg to make firmer. Both of us loved it. He definitely wants it again.. uh the Crab Cakes I mean!

Great. These stand out for a couple of reasons. One, they are not too spicy or salty, so the sweetness of the fresh crab is apparent. Two, the sauteed peppers (make sure to use all the butter) bolster the sweetnesss of the crab. Three, they aren't comprised of too much filler, so the caks are a real "crab" experience. They were on the floppy side, but worth the small amount of extra attention in the frying pan. oh, i didn't have time for the boiled egg, and they were fine.

Love this recipe, although I'll bake it next time. Yet another awesome recipe from this site!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. The bell peppers make this recipe come alive - I added extra diced pepper. Next time I will try both red AND green peppers for color. Serve with a simple mayo enhanced with diced dill pickle and lime or lemon juice. YUMMY!

This is our first try at this recipe, and we really loved it. Thank goodness for Costco and their 1 lb. can of crab meat for about $14 - what a deal. Next time I'm going to double the rest of the ingredients - although I did add extra to compensate for the extra 1/2 lb of crab meat we used, just not enough to hold the cakes together. When I discovered the first batch was falling apart, I added some additional egg to the mixture and fixed the problem. We decided to add a little celery seed next time. We served it with a Chipotle Aioli Sauce that gave the cakes some zip.

Very good crab cakes--one of the best recipes I've seen. The low filler really lets the flavour of the crab through. I roasted the red bell peppers before adding them and served the crab cakes over a bed of mesclun with a simple mustard mayo.

I really loved this recipe for 2 reasons, I wanted a recipe without MAYO and with a very limited amount of filler. I omitted all of the chopped egg and used "egg beaters" for the beaten egg required, and used 1 lb of crab instead of 1/2 lb. I used progresso bread crumbs instead of fresh (I didn't have time to waste!) and I also sprinkled bread crumbs on them before cooking for an even crispier appearance. They turned out FANTASTIC! They were so easy and this was my first time ever making crab cakes. I've had Wolfgang Puck crabcakes, gourmet crab cakes, Maryland crab cakes, you name it, and these were just as good, if not BETTER than those I've had at restaurants that charge 15-20 bucks for 2 cakes. I used claw meat and the recipe made 7 nice size cakes, much more economical than a restaurant. My family LOVED them, and best of all, no mayo and very limited egg content (for those of us who dont like mayo or eggs). TRY IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT! next time I think i will add red, yellow, and green pepper for a color sensation!

With some modification, I have been making these crab cakes since the recipe appeared in Gourmet more than 10 years ago. The simple ingredients and minimal binding let the taste of the crab and red pepper predominate in a most delicious way!Everyone always adores them. Because I find crabmeat quite rich, I do not saute the crabcakes in butter. Rather, I bake them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet in a 325 oven for about 15 minutes. I sprinkle a bit of paprika on top of each cake before baking. I omit the egg and don't serve chopped egg on the side. I also make my own tartar sauce (there's a good recipe on this site).
