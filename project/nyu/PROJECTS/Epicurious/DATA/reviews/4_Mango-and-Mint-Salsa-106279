Substituted minced ginger for the garlic and it turned out great. Used a jalapeno that had turned red, which gave a gentle warmth and added the perfect touch of color. We served the salsa over grilled cod -- yum!

This was very good! I used one whole Vidalia onion instead of red onion. I think it might be good with black beans mixed in, too.

this is really good - i used basil instead of mint and added some honey and cayenne instead of jalapeno. used over cajun/blackened pork tenderloin.

I tried this recipe the other day because I was looking for something to do with all the mint in my garden! It is SO good. The first time I used it as a topping on salmon that I had lightly seasoned, and then the second time I used it as a topping on a chicken breast, it is just awesome, and so easy!! I'm making it again tonight :)

Absolutely delicious and easy! I've served it with chips but its really great with grilled chicken cutlets - summery and fresh and everyone loves it. Use more or less jalepeno depending on the level of spice you like. I use two mangoes and the same amount of everything else.

Rated exceptional because it is delicious, easy and easy to vary based on what you have on hand. I prefer sweet onion (such as Vidalia) instead of red. Have used basil instead of mint. Both ways, it is dee-lish. It makes a great (and healthy) weeknight meal paired with lean grilled pork or chicken, and is company worthy as a condiment for plain grilled swordfish, tuna or salmon.

Very good salsa but I gave it extra kick with extra lime juice and mint. I will try canola oil next time which is more flavor neutral.

didn't have any jalapenos so substituted in 2 tsp of sambal oelek. also used a less-ripe mango, made it more tart, like a good green papaya salad. delicious!!!

Excellent...definitely 3 forks, maybe 4 forks. Mint adds excellent flavor. I'll be making this again.

Great recipe- pretty and full of flavor. I used two mangos, skipped the garlic, used an entire jalapeno (it was not spicy, just flavorful) and some extra mint. All else stayed the same. Delicious!
