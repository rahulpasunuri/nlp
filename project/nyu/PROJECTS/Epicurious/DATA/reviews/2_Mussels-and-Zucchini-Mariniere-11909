in theory, an excellent recipe. for some reason, the cream sauce came out quite bland and slightly watery. i was expecting a little more creaminess and a little more flavor. i might try using some bottled clam juice next time, and allowing the sauce to reduce down further before adding the mussels in. there is definitely something missing in the recipe, and i can't quite put my finger on it.
