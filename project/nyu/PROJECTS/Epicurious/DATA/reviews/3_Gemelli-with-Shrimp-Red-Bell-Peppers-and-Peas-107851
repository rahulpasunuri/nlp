Eh. Pretty plain. Would not add the pasta water, would add butter or olive oil. Used white wine in the simmering stage, think it might have helped it out, but did not save the dish.

Wow- this was the most boring pasta ever. I should have noticed the complete lack of any flavorings (thyme? 1 teaspoon of orange peel?) in the recipe, and heeded the warnings of those who came before. This would work if you have kids who love (relatively) plain pasta. If not, skip it.

Quick and tasty. I used lemon zest and some fresh basil.

My husband and his dad really liked it. I thought it was a bit on the bland side. I used pre-cooked small shrimp and one less bell pepper.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added some crushed red pepper at the same time as the garlic, and then added a scant 1/4 cup parmesan when I combined the pasta with the shrimp mixture. Was a solid 3 forks. It won't blow your mind, but it's a healthful, easy, weeknight meal.

This recipe was on the right track but it needs a couple things to make it wonderful. I added edamame instead of peas, a can of diced tomatos, and some lemon juice. I also used tri colored fusilli and next time I will add some portabellos because I think they will make this recipe top! I don't believe the shrimp were necessary, it's great as a vegetarian meal. I also suggest adding your favorite spice!

Very good, fast and easy. Will definitely make again

I have to say, I was disappointed! After all the great reviews, I was expecting a really amazing dish, but I felt is was just so-so. Not terrible, but there are so many more flavorful shrimp/pasta recipes out there. I did like the orange/thyme combination, but overall I thought this was really bland, definitely nothing spectacular and nothing I would take the time to make again.

i thought this was delicious, the peppers tasted great (i used red and yellow) and may have been the key ingredient. my mom thought it could use some sauce so maybe next time (because there will definitely be a next time) i will try the pepper/wine puree that another reviewer suggested. the thyme and orange flavors were a hit.

I loved this recipe. For pasta, it wasn't too heavy and the vegetable and shrimp mixture was very flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

Made it as is, but used fresh, uncooked peas which were just al dente and added nice crunch. Huge hit, easy to prepare ingredients in advance and then toss in pan just before you are ready to eat.

Loved it! I threw in a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper for some bite and used penne for the pasta. Also, a handful of Parmagiano-Reggiano. Next time, I might use ginger instead of the red pepper.

We loved this recipe. I doubled the garlic, because we love garlic, but left everything else the same. Even my kids loved it. The gemelli was kind of plain, but that balanced out well with the shrimp mixture that was packed with flavor.

Love at first byte. :) Really, this is an excellent recipe. Made it, served it, and my some of my guests came back for thirds.

I thought this was good, but not so great that I would make it for company. If I had some of the ingredients on hand that needed to be used up, I would make it again- it was very fast and easy to prepare. I added just a tiny bit of cayenne to give it some more flavor- I think it was a good thing to have done.

This dish was incredibly bland. I ended up dumping tomato sauce and pamesan on it just so I could eat it for dinner.

I forgot the garlic, only had dried thyme and substituted lemon peel for orange peel--and we were still pleased with the results. I'm looking forward to trying the recipe again as written.

I made this dish for a buffet dinner. I actually served it cold, and it was a hit. I eliminated the peas, because I don't like peas, but added green and yellow peppers. My friend ate the leftovers for lunch until the whole next week until it was gone. I would definitely make this again.

The dish was hardly bland although some grated parmesan zipped it up a bit. A quick puree of some of the sauteed red peppers, onions and white wine made a nice sauce that complemented the flavors and didn't add a whole lot of calories. I would rather spend the time preparing uncooked shrimp on a dish with more return on the investment. Not for company, but a tasty, light, easy and fairly quick weeknight meal. And I wish people used this forum to discuss how their dishes turn out rather than squabbling like children.

Good! Husband thinks a little crushed red pepper would be good and he's probably right! Orange adds an interesting flavor. Enjoy...

To cook on 4/5, take a heavy laxative and get a life. You are too full of yourself. And, Rick, thanks for your opinion.

Colorful dish. I actually prepared it as per directions!! This is good cold with white wine and green salad for qa luncheon, also. With so many vegetable, there were a lot of left-overs.

Rick, don't actually RATE the recipe until you have tried it please! Giving suggestions, etc. are fine, but when you "fork" it, it skews the numbers.

Hven't made it yet, but it sounds good. If it is me cooking, I would definitely be using Snow Peas instead so you don't have to worry about mushiness.

My boyfriend and I really liked this. It was nice and light. I liked the combination of the orange and bell peppers.

I havent made this yet, but it sounds like it would be very good. My husband likes lite shimp and pasta dishes. If it is bland ; as some have said I will probably just add butter and garlic to the noodles. Otherwise with the onion, garlic, herbs and orange .. it should be quite tasty.

Haven't made this one, but if this sounds bland, try the Citrus Shrimp, Black Bean, and Rice Salad on this site (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=12208). It was wonderful!

Since it's just my husband and me, I didn't use quite as much pasta. Also, added one more clove of garlic and a couple of splashes of balsamic vinegar! Good basic recipe however. You can improvise with whatever you like that's what is so nice. I'll make it again.

To Cook on 4/1 re: "unthawed". Exactly. You do not thaw the peas; leave them frozen and add to the recipe that way (keeps them from getting mushy). The word is correct in this recipe.

If unthaw were actually a word, it would mean 'to freeze'.

While my husband liked this dish, I found it quite bland. I wasn't crazy about the orange flavor either. Maybe lemon would have been better but I'm not making it again so I guess I'll never know.
