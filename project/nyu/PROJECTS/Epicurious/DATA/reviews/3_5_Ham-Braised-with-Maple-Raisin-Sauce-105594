I have made this recipe so many times and it turns out wonderfully moist and delicious every time. I did spend a fortune once on real maple sugar, but was not that impressed. I always just use maple syrup (or sometimes honey) and dark brown sugar. Also I only put in a handful of raisins (2 cups is way too much). So delicious!

This was my first ham and everyone who had it agreed that it was terrific. I changed the recipe up a little. I changed the following:

This is very similar to my own ham recipe...which I rarely share...but I am feeling nice today for Easter!! I use one cup maple syrup (must be REAL..no corn syrup stuff) one-half cup brown sugar, and one-half cup of orange juice (not pulpy-kind). That's it..just pour it over the ham and bake (I cook it in a bag about 10 min/lb). I have found that "tavern" hams work the best for having remaining juice. Then, use a gravy separator to discard the fat, and thicken the juice with a roux (just cooked flour and butter) to make ham GRAVY. You may add raisins to this, but my family prefers it without. It is sooooo good on the ham and mashed potatoes...sweet, but with a salty, ham flavor. I have used other types of hams (both higher and lower quality), and the Superior Tavern ones have the best brine for this recipe...(that's really the secret..not the recipe itself.) Some don't have enough "juice" and you just end up with brown, sweet, yucky, syrup. You will totally have raves over ham gravy..and plenty of requests from people who want to take some home.

Simply an outstanding recipe. I took the other reviewers advice and used brown sugar, didn't have apple juice so I substituted pineapple juice. The ham was cooked to perfection and the sauce was delicious (I did not double it because my ham was 6 pounds).

Fantastic, very easy, ham came out very moist. Followed the recommendations from another reviewer about doubling the sauce, used 1 C brown sugar and about 1/2 C honey instead of maple sugar, and it was fantastic!

I liked this ham, but I'm partial to sugary hams. I followed another user's suggestion and substituted brown sugar for maple sugar. I don't know why one of the previous user's is commenting on dry turkey (unless she substituted turkey for ham!)

Dispense with the family budget and enjoy this one for Christmas dinner. Well worth the effort and small expense!

If my family is on a limited budget, why on earth would I go out and buy both maple sugar and maple syrup??? otherwise, this recipe is good.

I made this recipe for easter and everybody loved it. The day after I brought the leftover to my friends house and they loved the taste and how tender the ham was. I used the ground cloves instead of the whole and I basted it every 10 minutes. Great taste.

This was easy, delicious, impressive looking, and an inexpensive way to feed a crowd. I substituted brown sugar for granulated maple sugar and doubled the sauce recipe (otherwise I think it would have dried up during the baking phase). Ham cooking liquid made an interesting soup base ... too sweet on its own but additional stock and red pepper flakes helped.

This ham was a big hassle to make, and in the end it was not worth it at all! The flavor was bland, theb turkey was dry, the rasins did not mix with the dry ham or so called "smoky maple" flavor at all! I made this for Christmas eve dinner and my relatives and I hated it! It was also not suitable for kids at all, I strongly advise you to never make this!
