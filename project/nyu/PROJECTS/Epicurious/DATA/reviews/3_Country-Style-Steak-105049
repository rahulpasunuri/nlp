This recipe will stick to your ribs. I only marinated for 30 minutes and found this to be adequate. Use ample salt, pepper and garlic powder to add flavor and try substituting beef broth for the water. Instead of heating onions in water in a pot, I put in a covered container with 2 T water in the microwave and steamed for 5 min. Last modification based on reviews was substituting 1/2 C half and half for the liquid. My husband and kids all liked this stick to your ribs winter meal

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the recipe. I did not marinate overnight, just a few minutes before frying. I thought it gave just enough flavor. I sauteed the onions in the drippings and I also added a cup of milk in place of 1 cup of water. It helps to read other reviews before preparing!

I did not marinate the meat but 2 hours in worcestershire sauce and still did not like the taste of it. Glad I didn't marinate overnight! Too tart and tangy. Gravy was a little bland. I threw the recipe away after I made it.

the meat was very tasty but after following the recipe exactly the sauce leaves alot to be desired even cooking with chicken broth I needed to add more garlic, pepper and tomatoe sauce.

here in Lexington NC we add chicken stock for the water and we cook it until it is tender. Otherwise a great recipe.

This is a good recipe. I think the worcestershire sauce made the cubed steaks nice and tender. Definetly a plan ahead meal, but worth it.

Even though this is not the way my Grandma taught me to make country style steak, it's very good. One change, to tenderize the steak, return the steak to the skillet with the gravy, cover and cook for another 10-15 minutes. That's the way Grandma did it.

We didn't care for this at all. The meat wasn't tender and the sauce wasn't particularly good. I don't know if I did something wrong since everyone else seems to like it, but we threw the recipe away after dinner.

Okay. This was a good recipe. I did have to add beef broth though instead of water to make the gravy. I also did marinate the sirloin steak that I used overnight, and that seemed to make the steak so tender and yummy. The gravy turned out great, so did the steak, and I will make it again. I might try a crockpot version next time, and make the gravy right before serving. This is definitely worth trying....but as I said, I had to work a little at the gravy. Hubby loved it!

I could not believe how fast this meal is. I didn't marinate the meat overnight, but I did marinate it while I was preparing to cook. And the meat soaked it right up anyways. Even though I am an experienced cook I could never correctly make homemade gravy with out it turning into glue. But after following this recipe my husband said it was as good as his moms. I did make one change. Instead of 3 cups of water in the gravy, I made it with 2 cups of water and 1 cup of milk to make it creamier. This is comfort home cooking at its best. Even better as leftovers.
