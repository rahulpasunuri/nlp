From the moment my partner stepped in the door he was asking what this was because it smelt so good--then we tasted it! Outstanding! I served it with steak and a tomato/boconcini/basil salad but am planning on having it for breakfast and/or lunch. When I was prepping the oranges I have to say I thought never again--but once I tasted it I will definitely make again. I was concerned about tartness and added a bit of brown sugar and I used tangerines because I couldn't get blood oranges.But definitely make this -- you won't be sorry.

This was divine. I used a little less of the peel than called for, although I think the full amount would work. Check out the result at http://www.applesnonions.blogspot.com/

This is delicious and colorful -- a great addition to parties during the holidays. I have made it half a dozen times and find it a pleasant change from other more predictable savory appetizers. My one bit of advice is "Don't skimp on the black pepper." I also had better results when I was careful to select blood oranges that weren't overly ripe.

This was inedible. I eat almost anything and love wacky flavors but it was blech. The orange drastically overpowered everything.

Marmalade was hard to make -- tough to get those segments out of the oranges. But once made, it was all delicious!

I have made this several times and it is always well received. For those finding it too bitter, I'm wondering if you are getting the pith (white) part of the orange, it is bitter but the zest (peel) is not. I don't understand the reviewer who gave this only three forks because he had not yet tasted the recipe. You are doing the recipe a disservice -- please don't write a review if you haven't tasted the dish, would think that would be pretty obvious.

update: have eaten this in an omelette with goat cheese and black pepper for the last 2 days, it's delicious! a great thing to have on standby in the fridge.

i gave this 3 forks because of the ease with which you can make it. super easy and so quick from start to finish. i haven't tasted it since it cooled, yet, so i can't rate it higher or lower (tasted while still hot and found it really nice). like the goat cheese idea, will probably end up eating it with goat cheese in an omelette for an easy dinner one night this week. a good thing to have on standby in the fridge.

Beautiful and tasty appetizer! I now make this whenever I can find blood oranges in season. Marmalade can be made ahead of time, so construction is quick and easy.

I followed the directions precisely. This was way too bitter. I even tried adding more honey. It also never set up. I boiled it for a while. Maybe my oranges had too much juice? I didn't mind the prep but the outcome was miserable.

I had an absolutely miserable time segmenting the oranges, and feared that the marmalade was going to be too bitter, alas it was not, and the goat cheese was a perfect complement. These were a crowd pleaser.

Extremely tasty recipe. Couldn't find Blood oranges so I used a small can of mandarin oranges - great substitute! Very simple and delicious! A crowd pleaser!

I really liked this appetizer. It was messy working with the oranges - but worth the effort.

I absolutely loved these - some my guests were not quite as impressed. They were very time- consuming to make. My husband patiently skinned the blood oranges with a very sharp paring knife while I cut the flesh out from between the membranes. I now know how to make marmalade! A lot of work but worth the effort! Small delicate bites are best and plenty of black pepper for heat.

I made this to bring to a cocktail party and it didn't turn out right. The marmalade tasted so bitter. So, so bitter. I will try to make it again, but will leave out strips of the peel, next time.

I made this recipe for a group of friends and everyone loved it. The recipe was a bit of a pain to make--segmenting the oranges was more difficult and messy than I had anticipated. But once you got passed that part it was very easy and tasty.

Couldn't find blood oranges at Whole Foods so I used tangerines instead. The end product was tasty but the effort involved seemed like slightly too much work. Also, I think you really need to like oranges to fully appreciate this one. It certainly is an unusual but good combination of flavors.
