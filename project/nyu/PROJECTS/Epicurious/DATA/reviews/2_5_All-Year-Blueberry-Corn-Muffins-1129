If I could give this recipe zero forks, I would. The muffins were terribly bland despite the ridiculous amount of blueberries. The texture was no good, unpleasantly grainy with lots of air pockets. The muffins stuck so steadfastly to the papers that I was only ever able to get the top halves to come out, which meant I lost out on most of the blueberries. Also, this recipe yielded 24 muffins, not twelve, so now I'm stuck with a double batch of disappointment.

A keeper. Fast, easy & delicious. I used 1/2 cup more blueberries & they were very moist.

I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT used fresh bluberries. I thought the texture was light and moist with a grainy crunch from the cornmeal. It made a good muffin.I was concerned that it would be too sweet, but it wasn't.I did not sift all the dry ingredients together and it came out fine.

addendum: Good texture -- I like corn meal crunch; flavor is good -- several layers: buttermilk, blueberries - good finish; no aftertaste. I sprinked nutmeg/sugar on tops -- adds another layer of flavor.

Added 1 tsp vanilla used frozen blueberries, which made batter blue -- nice touch

I think other reviewers may have given this recipe a bad rap. I did use fresh berries, however. Everyone enjoyed them - easy and delicious.

One tip - use freshly ground cornmeal. re: unthawed - I think it means frozen; don't know why the writers didn't use that, perhaps they wanted emphasis without redundancy - "frozen blueberries, unthawed" sounds better than "frozen blueberries, frozen"?. . http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=unthawed But don't trust dictionary.com, . . "un" = the opposite of. . . .

I believe they do mean "unthawed", as in leave them frozen so the blueberries aren't completely mush.

ok, so unthaw is the improper use of a word- but did you get it? Thanks for the useless review

When you "unthaw" something, you're freezing it. The word should be thawed. The other reviews were correct; there isn't enough blueberry flavor.

I have made this recipe many times and the crowds love them. Make sure you sift the cornmeal well though. Also, I didn't use all the blueberries.

I found these muffins to have a very rough, grainy texture and not very flavourful. I added some syrup, vanilla and cinnamon to my second batch and that helped a little, but the blueberrys are overpowered by all that cornmeal.

Easy to make, but not extraordinary. If you're looking for a muffin that is not sweet and not rich, this is it. It's pretty bland.

This recipe was a little odd. The batter made enough for 18 muffins, not 12. When I baked them they tended not to rise up and had flat tops. But, they were very light and tasty, and the family gobbled them down. So even though they were funny looking, they were still quite good.

Wasn't crazy about this muffin recipe. It is a little on the bland side.
