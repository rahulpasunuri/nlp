To be fair, I rarely make a dish as directed. I am enjoying a lovely meal though. It was a bit soupy but I did cut back on the stock and the chicken doesn't need quite that amount of time to cook through so with the reduced amount of liquid I cooked it on high at the end and the lentils and carrots were cooked but still toothsome and most of the liquid gone. Other changes - soaked some sundried tomatoes in hot water added them to the lentils - every bite has a tomato sparkle. Used the remaining water from the soaking and a dash of sherry vinegar to deglaze the pan. I kept the thighs (skinned and boned) whole because I thought they would disappear into the lentils. Good call. Next time I want to add some good curry powder to the lentils and onions and deglaze the pan with Pomegranite water. Good for the body and good for the soul.

We loved this. We used large chicken breasts instead of thighs and green lentils, but otherwise made as listed. I too was surprised that there was no saute phase for the onions and carrots, but it came out fine without it. That cuts down on the fat as well. The browning of the pearl onions is key, but it worked fine with frozen ones and we didn't have to peel them. Oh, and we did use balsamic vinegar instead of sherry or red wine vinegar so it did have a stronger flavor which adds a lot. The green lentils did not break down as others have said the brown ones did. A total keeper, and the house smells awesome!

After reading some of the reviews, I was a little nervous, but it sounded good so I tried it anyway. I did make some changes to fit what I had--used 2 large chicken breasts, 1 large chopped onion instead of pearl onions. I also followed a suggestion in the comments and left the onion and chicken in the pan with the wine. It turned out quite yummy--not soupy at all (I actually had to add additional water to lentils). And anything this yummy and surprisingly easy that gets my 5-yo eating WILL be made again. There is something missing to it though--it just needs a little kick of something to be incredible.

To me this was just a thick, mushy chicken soup, and an awkward blend of flavours. I didn't like the combination of chicken and lentils, and the red wine is totally out of place. Perhaps white beans instead of lentils and white instead of red wine would (slightly) improve this dish.

Where do I begin... This recipe is really good in theory, but needs a lot of help. First of all, Nosmo King isn't open any longer and perhaps that should provide a clue. Things I would change about the recipe include the following: sautee the onions and add carrots for a few minutes before combining with broth and water; Add only 1 cup of water to start then add more as needed; simmer lentils for 15 minutes (or until just tender), not 25 (and I recommend French green lentils not brown lentils); DOUBLE the amount of chicken (no way does 3/4 lb chicken feed 6 people). If I make this again, it will be with these changes and I hope that I can help any other cooks avoid some frustration with these recommendations.

i halved this recipe and it didn't come out soupy for me at all. I used brown lentils but might used a differnet color next time since the color was less than appealing. I reduced the wine with the chicken still in the pan which gave the chicken a great flavor not to mention a purple color. A low fat well balanced meal i will be making this again.

This came out soupier than I expected, but it was very tasty. My husband loved it and had three servings! I made it with red lentils which are very tiny...they cooked down completely with no shape left. Maybe I should have used traditional brown lentils? I'll probably try that next time.
