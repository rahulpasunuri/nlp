Loved these! Very tasty. I found that pan frying them at the end in a little sesame oil did give it that extra yum factor. Would recommend these and make these again

I very much agree with sdenzer on this one. I was excited about a way to use leftover tabbouleh, but this wasn't worth it. Just bland.

These were very meh... bland and not so exciting. I'm a sometimes vegetarian and feel pretty strongly that non-carnivourous food can be awesome. These missed the mark. I found myself heaping on extra tzatziki to try and liven them up, but even that wasn't enough. Won't be making them again.
