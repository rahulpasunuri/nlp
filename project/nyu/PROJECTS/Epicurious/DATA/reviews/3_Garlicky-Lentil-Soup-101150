Agree--Okay, not great. Followed some tips of other reviewers, adding smoked paprika and cayenne. Also re-blended it after adding the chopped parsley and spices. Needed additional waters than called for, should've used stock but too cheap to open a whole can for just a couple tablespoons! Might be an altitude thing though....

Easy and good! As with other reviewers, substituted veg stock for water. Also added 1T olive oil with garlic in the bottom of the slow cooker, and threw in a branch of thyme. Add this to my slow cooker go-to list.

Am vegetarian, but not overly fond of lentils. What a surprise this soup was! Replaced the water with stock and added only onions in the beginning. Definitely a soup I will make again!

Followed other reviewers, but kept it vegan with the following changes: Sauteed garlic in olive oil with onion, thyme and red pepper flakes. Added vegetable broth instead of water(that Better Than Bouillon stuff is awesome). This was great!

Must use balsamic vinegar and French Green lentils. Perfect.

Great recipe. I followed the reviews of others and I sauteed the garlic (feel free to add more than 8 cloves) with a little onion and braised the lentils before adding chicken broth instead of water. It ended up being an great hearty meal with a lot of taste!

I used the above recipe as a base and made the following changes: used a cup of mirepoix and 2 teaspoons of minced garlic; used chicken broth instead of water; flavored with 2 tablespoons of smoked spanish paprika and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper; pureed 2 cups of the bean mixture, 1 cup of the liquid and 1 head of roasted garlic cloves and added that to the soup. I finished with truffle salt.

I made this for lunch today serving it with garlic french bread. I think it is essential to follow the advice of the person from Northern Virginia , that is using a mirepoix and some kind of broth either vegetable or chicken. I also substituted the red-wine vinegar thinking it would be too harsh and used a filet of balsamic. All in all it made for a nice fall meal.

I followed the recommendations of a previous cook and used chicken broth instead of water and a mixture of finely chopped carrots, onions and celery. Definitely makes this soup tasty. I cannot imagine it without these ingredients.

this is better if you brown garlic a little in olive oil then braise lentils a bit before adding CHICKEN or BEEF broth instead of water (or a 50/50 split). i also added barley, carrots and spinach (at end). very easy and extremely healthful.

Good easy and hearty, healthy meal. Not special, but a good standby. I add celery and chicken broth.

I agree with some of the other reviewers. This soup lacked flavor. I've got better lentil soup recipes that I think are much better.

Love this. Really garlicky. Have to use broth instead of water. Balsamic vinegar really makes this recipe pop. Add a spinach salad and warm black bread.... mmmmmmm.

I did a search on "french green lentils" because I had some leftover from another recipe. This was nice and very garlicky! We love garlic, but those that don't... beware!

I really liked it, as did my boyfriend who is a beer and ribs kind of guy. I didn't change it at all, but maybe instead of water I would use vegetable broth, and maybe add some oregano or basil. It's so easy, and I don't have to go to the grocery.

I'd do it again, but I'd add some veggies after turning the lentils to puree. Not a bad base recipe, but not very exciting.

This soup was flavorless and a bad consistency, prepared exactly as the recipe suggests.

We eat lots of garlic in my house, but this recipe nearly killed us! I smelled for days. Otherwise, it was o.k. The texture somewhat bothersome and the flavor was o.k. to good, but lentils were overpowered by the garlic.

This is an excellent, easy to make recipe - I can throw it together in 5 minutes, take the dog out for a walk, blend and serve. No brainer. I was a bit hesitant when I read that everyone else was using chicken broth, but I just tossed in an organic herbal bouillon cube & 1/2 tsp salt. It was an instant hit! I get a request from my carnivorous boyfriend about once a week -- he does the grilled cheese, I do the soup.

Yuck!!! For a good vegetarian lentil soup, try Deborah Madison's book Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone. I'm sure this turned out better when using chicken stock because this would give the soup better flavor and it adds salt at the beginning, which is critical. Cooks Illustrated did an article on lentils stressing that they need salt at the beginning to get tender. Deborah Madison also stresses this. This is why this recipe took so long to cook... Just about anything will taste good floating in a great chicken stock. Cooking vegetarian is much more difficult. I hope Epicurious can rise to the challenge some day.

Soup was delicious and satisfying. I made some changes: used olive-oil roasted garlic and shallots from a previous night's recipe, used chicken broth for most of the liquid, and pureed the soup finely and thinned it to the consistency I liked. I bought bulk green lentils from a health food store, so not sure what kind. Added a squeeze of lemon to the soup bowls at the very end. Served for lunch with grilled cheese sandwiches made with fontina cheese and whole wheat bread. Very tasty.

Yup, the previous reviewers are right - this IS a terrific soup! And talk about fast! I used 4 c. chicken broth instead of water, so it didn't need added salt. I also used tiny red lentils, which worked great. I was skeptical of adding the oil and vinegar, but it WORKS! (just use a tiny touch of each) What a wonderful, quick dinner with good bread and/or a salad. Make it - you'll be glad you did!

This recipe has quickly become a favourite at our house. It's delicious, healthy and ridiculously easy. On work nights we skip the blender, float some spinach or tatsoi leaves into the soup at the last minute and serve it with lots of crusty bread and cheese. Perfection.

love garlicky lentil soup!

I thought this was really good and very easy. I too used chicken broth instead of water, added more garlic, and did not puree any of it. I also added some diced and seasoned tomatoes at the end. I had to use 1/4 t of dried thyme because I didn't have any fresh and forgot to put the parsley in, but it was still very good. I liked the oil and vinegar, but also tried it with a dallop of sour cream which was also tasty.

Wow...this was some goooooooooooood soup. I took some previous reviewers suggestions and used a bit of stock in place of some of the water, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Loved the fact that I didn't have to saute anything in oil first, so it was dead easy, and virtually fat free. Definitely making this one again!

My family loved this soup! I made it jsut the way the recipe was written and served it with a hearty Italian bread. Very easy/ unique flavors. This is ione of the few recipes I have ever cooked as is.

Followed the previous reviewers recommendation and added more garlic, chicken broth and regular lentils. Tried red wine vinegar, but didn't like the taste,then tried cider vinegar and loved it. Only put half of mixture in blender, still didn't like the look or texture. Next time won't puree any of it. Served with black olives. Well worth making.

skip the red wine vinegar and you've got yourself a mighty fine soup

The best lentil soup recipe I have found. Definatly use a lot more garlic and substitute the low-sodium chicken broth for the water. I've made it both ways and the above way is the best. Delicious.

Yummy, but the consistency was odd. Next time I will only puree the carrots and garlic, will leave lentils whole.

This recipe has redeemed lentils for me, I did substitute with chicken broth, also slightly pureed them, then laddled this lovely dish over some sliced chicken breasts. My child didn't even complain about having to eat chicken. This is a winner for me!

I used low-sodium chicken broth, as well, and let it simmer until more of the liquid was reduced and the soup became more thick. Very delicious! I have made it twice. The first time I made the recipe as is, and the second time I doubled the recipe to take it to family. They loved it!

I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water, extra garlic, and I cooked on low for a couple hours. It was amazing... a smash hit at my Christmas dinner party.

The soup was very good and easy to make although the lentils took about 1 and 1/2 hours to cook not 25 minutes. I also added broth to it to give more flavor.

This was by far the best lentil soup I have ever made!!!...with a few alterations. I tripled the recipe to have some to freeze, and added some sweet onion, celery, carrots(6), and subbed 2c chicken broth for water. It's a meal in itself and perfect for a snowy winter day!

If you like lentil soup and garlic, this is an excellent dish. I added green olive oil just before eating, and that was a nice touch. I also added sliced carrots during cooking.
