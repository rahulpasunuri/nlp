I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and added ¼ cup of oil and an added tsp of sugar. I also added some crushed peanuts, which really added flavor, based on these changes this recipe has become a staple for weekday lunches. It holds its crispness for a number of days and gets better every day. I give it a four fork rating with these additions.

As written, just one fork. The sauce was too watery to cling to the cabbage and the soy sauce couldn't stand up the robust cabbage. Oil would have helped, as would increasing the amount of sugar making the sauce with dijon mustard as the base. There is potential here, with some tweaking.

I'm bummed. I thought this would be a recipe that uses chinese cabbage such as bok choy or napa. Instead it's the same old European style red and green cabbage-good in its place but not the same thing at all.

I have a suggestion to make this recipe work. Rather than all of the seasonings being suggested and I agree that oil is required...Just use the soy sauce with Gazebo room salad dressing. Perrfeecto'! Oh yeah, slivered water chestnuts and some cruchies chinese noodles are a nice addition too.

This salad has a strong, astringent quality. The recipe lacks oil and enough sugar to cut the strong flavors of vinegar and soy sauce. I added 2 tsp of sesame oil and 1/4 c of canola oil plus an additional tsp of sugar. These additions make this salad palatable.
