Unlike the previous review I loved the shortcake recipe and was not excited about the carmel apples, they were good but not great. The whipped cream addition to the shortcakes made them light and yummy! Will keep this as my basic shortcake recipe.

While I wasn't overly impressed with the shortcakes on their own, once you added the sauce and the apples - WOW! I am also a caramel nut, and this was one of the best desserts I have ever made. My guests loved it - one person even had 2! Watch the cooking time of the apples though - they turned out a bit mushy, which was still great, but I think they would be better a bit crisper. YUMMY!

I had to try this as my husband is a real carmel/butterscotch fan. He LOVED it!!(this from a man who truly does not like shortcake).Followed the instructions and it turned out perfect. Next time I'll make more carmel and make the shortcakes like a sandwich(with the apples& sauce in the middle) and pour extra carmel over the top. For company I would add a swirl of whipped cream. I cater and I'm adding this to my fall & winter menus.
