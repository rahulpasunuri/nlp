I have had a good amount of peanut soup and I have to say, I think the peanut butter taste is lacking. Luckily, I supplemented the amount called for with an additional 2 cups or so. After that, it was fantastic.

We did not like this soup. It was very plain, and did not taste much like peanut butter.

Celery herb, parsley and allspice are also really nice in peanut soup. Give it a try.

I love this soup and it's very easy to make! I always use vegetable stock to make it vegetarian, and I often add broccoli in when I saute the peppers and onions. I go heavy on the garlic, red pepper flakes and rice and sometimes throw in a handfull of bean sprouts just before the peanut butter. It's very satisfying and good for you too!
