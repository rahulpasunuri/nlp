I just do not get the bad reviews. I have made this cake for my mother and brother on many occasions. It turns out perfectly every time. It's not for one that's crunched for time, however, it's well worth the time. The cake is very moist and favorable. The pineapple filling is delicious and can be used in other recipes. The coconut frosting is the best I have ever had. In short, this cake is a masterpiece! I use this recipe to impress!

This is the worst cake I have ever baked...hands down. If there was a "no way in hell" option for if I would make it again...that's what I would pick. My suggestion, use a different cake recipe and then use this recipe for the filling.

Well, well, well. What a waste of time! I should have read the reviews before trying this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and, in similar fashion to the poor souls that did the same, the cake came out flat, soggy and heavy. Like those before me, I was concerned about the lack of flour in the recipe and the total absence of baking soda. For those of you that can't understand why everyone else had so much trouble: 1. You cheated with the cake mix by using a pre-made one, or 2. You threw in more flour and some baking soda, anyway (good on you for not being duped), or 3.You messed up the cake recipe by accident and ironically ended up with a better cake. Finally, this was the first and last recipe I am using from this website. If epicurious can't even be bothered to post a recipe without fundamental errors, then I can't be bothered to visit the website.

This is the best cake ever! I get requests for it on every special occasion!

Will not rate the recipe since I only made the filling, for a carrot cake. I halved it and it was very good. A note about cracking coconuts though. My family is Indian and we use the hard brown coconuts often. We never bother cracking them in the kitchen. Always take them outside to the yard and smash them on the stone or concrete, and take a vessel with to catch any coconut water.

This cake was delicious! The buttercream frosting was rich and creamy and the only complaint was the fattening, heart-clogging nature of the cake. We followed the recipe exactly and loved the texture of the cake.

This cake is a classic French genoise - using whole eggs only for leavening. With all due respect to home cooks such as the poster from Toronto, it is a simple cake to make - provided you understand and are practiced at the techniques involved. First and foremost -- all ingredients must be at room temperature and you must beat long enough to get the necessary volume from the eggs. Practice makes perfect and once mastered this cake is incredibly versatile.

I wanted to think that the bakers that rated this recipe a dud were just dumb. I was wrong - THIS RECIPE IS A DUD. For the first time in my life, had to try a recipe twice. Still didn't happen. If you're as gentle as they say when adding the flour and butter, neither is incorporated well and the result is rubbery and/or rife with flour pellets. Have now consulted other (better) recipes for Genoise which advise taking a scoop of the flour & egg mixture (before adding the last of the flour, which, incidentally ought to be added in 3 batches, not 2) and whisking it into the melted butter before adding the butter at the end - this lightens the butter so it doesn't sink to the bottom of the batter or hide until you're pouring the batter into your pans. Seriously Epicurious - either alter the recipe or take it down.

I was giving my husband a birthday party and he loves coconut and pinepple so I decided to make this with the shortcut since I was having 25 guests and had much to do! Very big mistake! The Betty Crocker super moist cake was, as described, super moist and just the opposite was needed for slicing the cake in half and with the heavy filling. So I threw the cake in the garbage and started all over. Then I made the cake, pineapple filling, syrup and then clicked onto the buttercream and to my surprise was way too much time to spend on this cake when making everything else! It is now in the freezer and I think I'll make the raspberry and lemon trifle using the coconut cake instead!

I used a Betty Crocker Super Moist White Cake Mix. I followed all of the directions. However I put the cake pans on the bottom rack of the oven and the tops of the cakes came out uneven. Next time I'll try the middle rack and turn the pans around during the last ten or fifteen minutes of cooking time. I made the rum syrup and the pineapple filling. Next time I'll just sprinkle some rum on each layer instead of making the rum syrup.I think it will give the cake more rum flavor. I made the buttercream frosting on a hot day. It did look a little thin so I put the bowl of frosting in a bowl of ice and put all of it in the refrigerator for an hour. I saved some of the butter to add later. Then I took the frosting out of the refrigerator and added the remaining butter. It came out perfect and was delicious. I toasted the coconut as one person suggested. Next time I would not toast the coconut because it was too dry.

Okay, I confess, after reading all the other reviews, I wasn't about to attempt the cake part of this recipe; I chickened out and used the "other" coconut cake recipe from the April 2001 Bon Appetit ("Old-Fashioned Coconut Cake"), i.e., white cake mix, sifted, melted butter, 1 tsp coconut extract. I baked two 8" layers in professional (3" sides) pans, and split the layers. Otherwise (sic), I followed the recipe to the letter, being especially generous with the rum sugar syrup. The buttercream was TO DIE FOR, and set up exactly as it was described in the recipe. I covered the finished cake with sweetened coconut, which did make it quite sweet, but not cloyingly so. I might try toasting unsweetened coconut next time; I don't really see why I'd risk life and limb attempting to deal with the fresh coconut. This is a very special cake; there was an awful lot of squabbling over the last piece!

I made this cake for Easter and I and everyone else thought it was delicious. I am no baker so I followed the recipe exactly (except for not using a fresh coconut) and used a standing mixer for the buttercream. The layers came out a little thin but it didn't matter when the cake was assembled. A good amount of work but worth it.

I didn't enjoy the dessert. With only 1 cup of cake flour the cake came out flat & chewy.

I've made this cake twice and will make it again. Since I haven't mastered buttercream icing (no candy thermometer), I made 7-minute boiled icing and it was delish. I used sweetened medium shred coconut and toasted it in a cast-iron pan as a finishing touch - saving myself the knife injury from shaving fresh coconuts as reported by another reviewer!

This was a marvellous cake with a fantastic texture. The icing was great but make sure that when icing the top of the first layer you don't spread icing all the way to the edges or it gooshes out all over the place!

I don't know what everyone's problem with this cake is since mine turned out fantastic and I've never made a cake from scratch before. Everyone who tried it loved it and wanted the recipe. I made it exactly as noted and the only time I had a problem with it was when I used a dark brown turbinado sugar (since at the time it was all I had) for the cake part and the cakes turned out too thin and dense. I then made another batch of the cakes and used Sugar in the Raw (lighter raw sugar), and it turned out fluffy and delicious.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I decided to substitute the cake portion for another- maybe a wise decision; I don't know. I made the buttercream frosting 2 days ahead and kept it in the fridge, but when it was time to use it, I blended it and it separated! I made it again, but was sure to use it right away (didn't have much of a choice there). It was all worth it though, as the cake is wonderful to look at and eat. Even non-lovers of pineapple and coconut thought it was great!

I have made versions of this cake several times. I love the pineapple filling and the rum syrup as well as the freshly shaved coconut. I use a diferent coconut cake recipe and cream cheese frosting from this site because I like them better. I have to say, please be careful when getting the coconut out of its shell. I am typing with one hand because I just had surgery on my hand yesterday after an accident with the knife while trying to get the meat out of the coconut shell. The combination of flavors in this cake are outstanding (surgery aside).

I have no complaints about the buttercream or the filling but THE CAKE PART OF THE RECIPE IS A TOTAL DISASTER. It is heavy, dense, greasy and flat!!! I had qualms about it when I was making it. The amount of flour seemed too little and it lacked baking powder. My dread was confirmed when the cake came out of the oven. I remade the cake using my Genoise recipe from the Cordon Bleu (a gift from a friend) and the result was fabulous. I disagree with the Gourmet test kitchen's posting that the cake will work if you take care, I did everything they said to the letter! I am a fabulous cook and baker and have never met with such a flop. I would warm future users of this recipe to substitute their own cake and use the buttercream and filling.

I had the same problems as many of the reviewers when I first made this cake last Easter. I did the cake portion twice, and they rose only an inch each time. But I assembled the cake anyway, and thought it was delicious. So...with the approach of Thanksgiving, I was DETERMINED to make the cake again and for it to come out perfectly this time. I even used it as an excuse to buy professional grade baking pans. I followed the tips from the Gourmet test kitchen about gently adding the flour and making sure the butter was cool. And guess what -- the cake still came out flat and dense. Twice. I'm an excellent cook and a pretty good baker, but this one has me stumped. The only thing I can think of is that my supermarket's "large" eggs are smaller than what others use. I plan to take the icing, pineapple filling and rum syrup components and use them with cake batters that I have had more success with.

I like to think that my problem had more to do with our high altitude rather than my lack of skill, but the cake part was a two-time disaster for me. If you live high up, add 1 cup of cornstarch (yeah...1 CUP) to the sifted flour. I tried that and it turned out great--and quite beautiful!

I learned some things from this recipe: Do not use a hammer to try to crack a coconut on your pizza stone because it will break, the coconut meat is too thick and tasteless to place on top of the cake, and lastly, the buttercream frosting is a pain to make. But, it tasted great (I left the coconut off)!

I read the reviews before I attempted this cake and chickened out making the frosting. I made my usual cream cheese, butter frosting and it was just fine. Have already had a request to bring one to the fourth of July barbecue! I like to make it with the recipe frosting but not till I have a large block of time.....

I read the reviews of this recipe, liking a challange I decided to try it. It is scrumptious. However, I am not for such complicated baking so I don't think that I will ever make it again, unless of course I need it for a special request.

I made this cake for Easter and was very disappointed. This is very time intensive and although the finished result was satisfactory, it wasn't the show stopper I had hoped it would be. The cake was a flop and I had to go out and get a cake mix at the last minute (altitute may have contributed here). The frosting was a semi-flop -I am quite experienced and yet my frosting never came back together as promised in the recipe. My meringue was a work of art ... but then I added the butter. I beat it at the speed specified and it was still too lumpy. I thickened it with some powdered sugar which did improve the consistency. I covered it with coconut after it was frosted -- so it looked fine. However, it was a disappointing enough effort I think I'd pass on making this cake again.

Don't be scared off by the reviews!! Although this recipe required a bit of work, it was delicious and beautiful. I followed the recipe to a "t" except for the fresh coconut. My coconut was rancid, so I just toasted some coconut flakes and decorated the top with that. The frosting was fantastic - some of the best I have ever made! It was tricky and it did start to go soupy. I just stuck my mixing bowl in some cold ice water and then want back to beating it. That seemed to work. I did let my eggs and butter warm to room temp. for some time. I also did beat the eggs until they were tripled in volume and folded in the flour carefully. I think that is trick - beating the eggs enough (room temp eggs so they beat better) and folding in the flour gently. My layers were light and fluffy and I am really no pastry chef. This really did made a lovely presentation and was rapidly consumed.

I am kind of surprised with reviews. I wanted to make a classic genoise and buttercream frosting because i got a kitchenaid stand mixer and it really turned out beautifully. Gave some to different friends and they all had the same "I usually don't like coconut but I LOVE this cake" response. I nearly chopped off my finger with the coconut, so be careful.

FROM THE GOURMET TEST KITCHEN In response to several of the reviews, we have re-tested the recipe and give the following hints: The only leavener in the recipe is the eggs, so they really do have to be beaten until "thick and pale and tripled in volume." If not, you will not get good results. This cake is based on a standard spongecake that has been used for many recipes from Gourmet. This particular recipe was tested several times, always with excellent results. Keep in mind that it's a very delicate batter and you have to be gentle when you fold in the flour. You also have to be careful not to bang the pan around. The other thing to watch out for is the temperature of the butter. If it is not completely cooled before being added to the batter it could deflate it. The key with this cake really is the beating of the eggs -- they have to be tripled in volume, really high up the sides of the bowl -- and the folding in of the flour.

I served this cake for dessert after Easter dinner and was embarrassed. The frosting never came back together as the recipe said it would, looked bad and was way too buttery. Besides that, the flavor of the whole cake was boring. My advice is don't waste your time on this recipe.

I was really disappointed in this cake. I am by no means an expert cook, so some of the failure was probably due to my inexperience. My biggest failure was the icing. I made the icing the day before and it was perfect. I tried using it the next day, following the advice in the "Cooks Notes", but it did not regain the proper consistency and was very unsatisfactory. The cake itself was OK, not exceptional. In my opinion, this recipe was not worth the effort!

I enjoyed making the cake, but the cake layers came out like flat pancakes (I tried twice). I had to remake the layers using a different recipe.

I loved the flavors and the look of this beautiful cake! However, the cake portion of the recipe was a total flop! I remade the cake using a traditional yellow cake recipe. Also, the icing was way too buttery. Next time, I will use a regular buttercream icing recipe and just add the coconut flavoring. I loved the pineapple filling and the fresh coconut topping.
