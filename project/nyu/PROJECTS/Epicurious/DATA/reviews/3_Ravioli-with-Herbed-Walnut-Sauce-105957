Fantastic as-is. Even my husband loved this meatless dish! Surprisingly quick and easy.

We have a HUGE rosemary bush in the garden and my wife loves walnuts, so I was excited when I saw this recipe. The kids (3 & 5) didn't care for it too much, but the wife and I enjoyed it. I don't know if I would make it again since I need kid friendly recipes.

Sorry if this is a duplicate, lost my internet connection while typing and didn't see my first review, so I will write it again. Great, simple recipe. I was worried that the walnuts would retain their chalky texture, but after sauteing in butter, they really were quite delicious. I also chopped the rosemary from my garden very fine so that the flavor would dissipate more and not be so intense when you bite a leaf. I am not one for strong rosemary flavors. The recipe was very simple, done in under 20 minutes. The entire fam enjoyed it, which includes my 6 year old and my 4 year old. I will make this again.

I have made this several times and it gets rave reviews. Simple, but my guest think it took a lot of time. Add bread salad and a bottle of wine and you have a winner. I too am puzzled by the bad reviews.

We picked this sauce randomly for a pre-made mushroom ravioli from Trader Joe's. Reducing the ingredients for longer than suggested yielded a great result. The walnuts were a great change of pace from regular pasta sauces.

I'm really surpised by all of the negative reviews. I thought this was great and would definitely make it again. It was perfect on our "fall summer day" in the City yesterday. I made a couple of minor changes: I used vermouth instead of wine, bumped up the garlic slightly and added some shiitake mushrooms when I added the walnuts. I also used porcini tortellini instead of cheese ravioli but I think it would work well either way. I think it would be especially delicious with sweet potato ravioli or any other fall flavor. In the future, I will definitely add more mushrooms next time. You definitely need to add parmesan or pecorino when serving but this dish will be in my regular fall/winter rotation.

Loved it! Will definately make this again.

I thought this was a wonderful, quick and simple supper - very quick and easy to make with ingredients I already had in the house. Only negative comment is that it is too heavy on the butter - use half and this is perfect.

We roasted chestnuts last night so I used the leftovers instead of walnuts... OMG!!! Fabulous!

I really like the subtle flavors in this recipe. It is simply delicious, a nice break from tomato or cream sauces. My only suggestion is to add freshly grated parmesan (or similar) cheese right at the table. It makes such a difference, it should be listed as an ingredient in the recipe, not only suggested in the photo.

Well, I liked it. Used spinach and feta borsellini-- other than that, followed the recipe. Tasty.

So I finally figured this one ... for me at least. My boyfriend has LOVED this recipe and asked for it several times which puzzled me as I just though, "eh, its ok." Here are the changes I made so that now we both ask for it: Zest of one lemon and lemon juice, 1/4 cup ricotta, 2 tbsp marscapone...and last time i took out the nuts, even though i love walnuts but for some reason didn't like them as much here but its good either way. Follow the recipe as written and add the lemon juice to the wine when simmering down, then add zest when adding the herbs. Add pasta and then add the cheeses.... Without the nuts it had a much prettier color I thought....So its kind of a completely different recipe but i really enjoyed it.

It was quick, easy and a good every day recipe, nothing spectacular. Taking into account previous advice, I did modify it. Used fresh wild mushroom ravioli (what I had) and reduced the amount of wine to 1/4 cup. For a lighter touch substituted the butter for just enough olive oil. Added pecorino at the end.

Rating: 3
The only reason I didn't give it four forks is because a couple ingredients dawned on me that _sounded_ better: sun dried tomatoes and/or blue cheese... Otherwise, I thought it was great, simple, and different--and I was amazed to find a recipe with all the ingredients I had on hand!

The best thing my father (always generous in his praise of someone else's cooking) could say about this was "interesting". This tasted strange, not good. I can't think of any substitutions to improve it; the fundamental ingredients just don't combine harmoniously.

I've made this dish several times. It's so simple, and really refreshing in comparison to all the tomato and cream sauces out there. Like someone else said, I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could!

As I was making this I was a little worried about some of the reviews, the sauce was a little dark but when I added the herbs, wine and ravioli everything came together and the dish was very good. I'd give it 3.5 forks if there was such a thing. A nice light pasta dish. Very good.

Rating: 3
This recipe was a pleasant surprise! I really enjoyed combination of flavors...especially the white wine. I let the sauce reduce too much, therefore making it drier than I'd like. I think the quality of ravioli you use makes a difference too. I will definitely make this again!

Maybe a little heavy on the white wine. I liked it, but my girlfriend said that it started to get overwhelming midway through dinner.

Not bad but the taste sort of grows on you. Definatly unusual. Suubstituted more olive oil instead of butter. Just a touch of butter was better.

Bad taste. Not impressed. Felt embarrassed by such a bad dish. Probably the worst dish I have ever made from Bon Appetit.

You have some strange reviewers! This was a fast dinner recipe, after all. We thought it was easy to make, with readily available ingredients. I used fresh (lowfat) ravioli and fresh herbs; I cut the butter back a lot and added olive oil, to reduce the fat content; otherwise I stuck to the recipe. I did feel the dish needs the parmesan referred to under the magazine photo but not mentioned in the text. Maybe we are used to lighter fare than some of your readers.

Contrary to other reviews, this dish was quite tasty. While it certainly wasn't the best pasta dish I've ever had, it was simple, quick, and satisfying. I'll certainly make it again when I need something that fits those criteria.

I agree with other reviewers that there is something missing in this recipe - the butter and wine mixture is too runny, and it ends up making the ravioli soggy. Could easily reduce the wine by 1/2 a cup. I added fresh arugula which made this slightly salvageable, but I won't make this recipe again.

This was absolutely the worst! It was bitter and totally unedible. Did an ingredient get left out of the recipe?

It was interesting just for once but I would not make it again. Something was missing that would make the ravioli, the wine and the walnuts into a whole. It was a bit like the ingredients could not blend.

Skip it! Find a better recipe or get inventive. Not much flavor. It was a waste of ravioli.

What's all the fuss about? The simplicity of this meal is just what makes it so good. I needed to stretch the sauce (last minute guests...) so I reduced a little chicken stock in the pan before adding the wine, then I splashed a little balsamic vinegar on just before serving. Deeelicious, and my two unplanned guests, friends of my son, loved it. There wasn't any left.

I agree with Milwaukee--it was easy to prepare but sort of bland. There are other recipes out there that hold more flavor.

I used frozen portobello mushroom ravioli instead of the cheese. My husband and I thought they were delicious. Very good as a simple supper entree or as a side to a fancier dinner. I served it with grilled filet mignon.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and while it is truly easy, it just wasn't outstanding. My husband and I thought it was OK, but not worth repeating. The kids really didn't eat at all. There are too many other good pasta recipes out there to bother repeating one that's only mediocre.

The best thing about this recipe is that it's easy. I added cream and parm cheese. My guests seemed to like it but I thought it was just okay.

This dish was easy and very good for the time spent. I didn't have quite enough walnuts, so added some chopped pecans. I even used the frozen ravioli instead of the fresh. My husband and teenage son loved it. This is a keeper for those nights when you want something good with little effort.

I made this last night, following the recipe exactly...didn't add any cream. The wine and butter sauce was plenty. It was nice, and so easy (which I believe was the point of the new batch email--easy recipes). Two forks might be skimping it a bit...if I had more time, I'd make something more complex, but it was great to come home from work and have a pretty meal with little effort.

I have rarely found a pasta recipe that I didn't like, but this one really didn't taste very good. My husband didn't even finish his serving, and he eats EVERYTHING. I have no idea what it would take to improve this recipe, but I definitely won't make it again.

I have been making this exact recipe for years with the exception of sauteing halved brussel sprouts with the walnuts, and have always gotten raves when served to guests. A good cheese is very important.

Add 1 cup of heavy cream to this recipe and it is out of this world. This is a traditional recipe and the flavour depends on the freshness of the walnuts. Give them a good roast and it is wonderful

I don't know what all the excitement is about! This recipe, in my opinion, sounds simple yet tasty! I think people need to understand that for AUTHENTIC Italians, in the world of pasta sauces, LESS is often MORE! I am baffled by people who dismiss recipes without trying them first -- if we got them in an email, SOMEONE must have thought it was good, but no recipe will please EVERYONE! Sheesh!

I didn't make this recipe. What I want to know is why does Epicurious include recipes for their "new batch" emails that are rated so low. Only 25% of readers would make this again. That must say something.

I have only read the recipe but wonder if cream or something else is needed. Why can't we have a recipe from a top Italian restaurant, tried and true, to duplicate? A chain restaurant in Dallas, Maggianos at Northpark Center has a delicious ravioli with cream sauce. The flavor is fabulous and includes a few herbs and couldn't be too difficult to duplicate. Let's bring some of those recipes into the home!

Very disappointing. No one in the family liked it. The flavor of the herbs just did not work with the ravioli. There are much simpler sauces that are more tasty.
