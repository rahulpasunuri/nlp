Pretty easy and not overly sweet. Changes made included used whole wheat flour, steel cut oats instead of oat bran, skim milk instead of soy, and applesauce and 2 bananas instead of 3 bananas. Also added some vanilla and used mix of brown and white sugar and some cinnamon.

I have been looking for a healthy recipe that I can have each morning. I liked this one but it is not your typical fat and sugar laden muffin. I made a lot of changes: Substitute soy milk with vanilla yogurt Substitue 1 1/2c flour with 3/4c cornmeal & 3/4 all purpose flour Substitue oat bran for 1/2c quick oats extra egg to offset the weight of the cornmeal 2 fresh squeezed lemons only 2 bananas 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon ginger prepared in food processor with the soft plastic blade, blueberries added, stirred not processed. They came out pretty and good, I liked the cornmeal that compliments the blueberries nicely.

So simple, and delicious. I used all whole-wheat flour and oatmeal, two bananas, the full 1.5 c blueberries, and a little less than the sugar called for. I think I could get away with even less sugar next time. Making it again tomorrow!

Rating: 4
I think this is a really great recipe. The guidance from other reviews was extremely helpful. i used whole wheat flour, and substituted oat meal for oat bran, and I used 2 bananas instead of 3. yes, they did stick to the paper, so I tried to put the batter into my silicone muffin pan directly, and that worked a little better. But, definitely moist in a really good way. super easy and fast. and as far as muffins go, definitely on the healthy side.

I love this recipe! Not too sweet. I used some muesli because I didn't have any bran and 2% milk instead of soy. They are sticky but the taste is delicious. I have made them twice.

Not great, too gummy. I did put in strawberries instead of blueberries but generally not a good recipe.

Rating: 3
This was a great muffin recipe. To make it a little healthier and add more fiber, I use 1c whole-wheat flour and 1/2c oat bran. This does make the muffin very fiberous which I like. Also use fat-free milk in place of the soy milk. I've also substituted the blueberries with pineapple and little coconut for a tropical flair.

Rating: 2
This was ok - not great... The muffins stuck badly to the paper. The texture was a little off - not sticky like some of the other reviews state - but not quite right. Just not much flavor. Maybe the banana flavor will intensify upon standing (ate one 10 min out of oven). I did use 1/4c stevia for half the sugar... And used skim milk instead of soy.

Made this recipe, however made it vegan. I used Flax seed meal vs bran. I used an extra banana and egg replacer. Delicious especially if one likes moist muffins. Finally Added shards of almonds to the top.

Rating: 3
These were delicious. I did modify; I used half white, half whole wheat flour, skim milk, one banana, and I eliminated the bran. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top. I didn't use paper liners, but did use cooking spray (I also used a 6-cup oversized muffin tin instead of the standard 12-cup). The texture and flavor were just perfect in every way, and they were by no means overwhelmingly "banana"--the flavor was more blueberry, if anything. YUM! Will definitely make these again.

Rating: 3
Those muffins were equally appreciated by kids & adults. They are indeed somewhat sticky and for my taste there could be less sugar, but I found them excellent. I made these substituting soy with skimmed milk because of allergies. As I did not have oat bran, I used wheat bran and put 10 g of it. Also, I omitted the blueberries (waiting for the summer to try that). I added chocolate chunks in a batch for the kids. As is, a piece of the version (without chocolate) is only 3.5 WW ProPoints !

Good in that the blueberries are abundant, just okay as far as texture and flavor. Somewhat soggy and too moist for me.

I really like this bread as a healthy alternative to regular banana bread. I generally use whole wheat flour and throw in some flax seed. I like these, however I will say they're generally a bit sticky or moist. Very yummy though!

Another (easiest) tip for the blueberry not sunk. Put then on the freezer 20 minutes before add to the batter...

Rating: 0
This was great - I also added extra vanilla, used maple syrup instead of sugar and buttermilk instead of soy. Here's a tip for those who found that the blueberries sunk to the bottom of the muffins - toss the berries into the flour mixture - that technique keeps them from sinking. My kitchen smells wonderful with these muffins baking in the oven.

I thought it was delish- I love the combo of bananas and blueberries! My roommate, who doesn't like baked blueberries, was even a fan. I followed the other cooks' suggestions and used 1 cup of blueberries and substituted oat meal for oat bran. I'll definitely make these again :)

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this recipe, but like many others, I made a few changes. Some due to necessity: I did not have oat bran on hand, so I simply used flour with some wheat germ and cream for milk. I also added baking soda and put in one tsp of vanilla. I found them to be the perfect consistency this way; with or without silicone cups.

Rating: 3
These taste great! Like most, I made some substitutions: milk for the soy milk and a combo of flax seed meal and ground oatmeal for the oat bran. I subtracted a fork for two reasons: (1) I think the recipe is too heavy on the blueberries -- they interfered with the structural integrity of the muffins; and (2) almost half the muffin stuck to the muffin paper -- a terrible waste!

Rating: 3
Excellent muffins. To the people complaining about the 3 bananas being too much, the answer is simple: measure out 1 cup of bananas as directed. In my case this was 2.5 bananas. These turned out moist, slightly sticky but not gooey, and rose well. I had to make a couple of small changes: My eggs were used up without me knowing so I added slightly more milk and another 1/2 tsp of oil. I also used cow milk and wheat bran, but kept all measures the same and the muffins turned out wonderfully. I might try them with raspberries next time...

Rating: 4
These turned out great. However I did tweek it a bit. I only used 2 bananas,1/4c. of blueberries,added oatmeal instead of bran, used almond milk and added 1tsp cinnamon and baking soda. They were moist and mildly sweet. My husband who doesn't care for muffins really loved them.

I made this a couple of times. They tend to stick to the paper and the muffin is sticky. The second time I made them I substituted applesauce for banana and were overall better, but not great.

I made this with a few of the other substitutions people mentioned. But most importantly, where does Epicurious list the nutritional info? Am I just supposed to believe it is "healthy"? How much carbs/calories, etc.????

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe exactly and they came out like little muffin nuggets that stuck to the paper wrappers. Hockey-puck like, rubbery or gummy are other appropriate adjectives. The flavor is nice if there was a way to make them fluffier and less dense- I'm not a good enough baker to know what that may be... I'd read up on ideas to improve that before making them again because following the recipe as is leaves much to be desired for both texture and presentability.

Rating: 3
I had bananas rapidly going brown on the counter and a freezer full of blueberries, so I decided to try these. I used 3 bananas as noted and whole milk instead of soy and used 2T lemon juice and 1tsp baking soda to give them some extra lift. I sprinkled wheat germ on top for some crunch and used the prescribed measure of frozen wild bluberries. I compared this recipe to a banana bread recipe and a lemon-blueberry muffin recipe that were my favorites to determine the baking soda amount. I baked in silicone muffin cups and cooled completely before removing. They came out great and are delicious. Next time I make them, I may add nuts and cinnamon as others have said.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I strayed pretty far from it. I substituted oat flour for half of the all-purpose flour, substituted an equal amount of honey for the sugar (reduced the amount of milk by an 1/8 cup), used strawberries instead of blueberries, and added a splash of vanilla extract and a hand-full of walnuts. Like previous reviews, I also used one less banana. I'm sitting down with one now with a tall glass of iced chai tea. Super moist, lightly sweet and delicious!

Yummy - made lots of substitutions though. Used buttermilk instead of soy, brown sugar instead of white, wheat bran instead of oat, added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and cut down the blueberry (1 cup frozen) and banana (1 large).

Rating: 4
I only had two bananas, and from the reviews and the taste of the muffins I agree it is better, 3 bananas would mask the flavor of the blueberries.My blueberries were very ripe, a few more days in the fridge and I would'nt have used them. I put a little rolled oats and honey bunches of oats on top of the muffins to add some texture. I also added 1tsp of vanilla extract to the batter. They were delicious.

Rating: 3
I used two bananas, reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and substituted a 1/2 cup of cereal instead of flour. They turned out fantastic, a bit dense but delicious. A keeper recipe. Note, for those whose blueberries sink, i learned a trick from my mum. Coat the blueberries in flour, and don't mix them in the batter directly. Instead, fill up the cup 1/2 way with batter, place some berries in, then put remaining batter overtop. Works great.

should have read the comments first. three bananas is wayyyyy too much, and they are very mushy. not very impressed.

The muffins tasted great. However, they stuck to the muffin cups and so I would maybe add a bit more oil. Or spray the muffin cups with PAM!

These are AWESOME. I used unflavored coconut milk instead of soy, brown sugar like other reviewers, added a teaspoon of vanilla and threw in a combo of frozen blueberries and raspberries. Next time I will make with whole wheat flour - didn't have any on hand. Moist and yummy both hot and cold and while still a little naughty - nothing close to a Starbuck's muffin.

this muffin recipe turned out great! with perfect consistency, anthoug I made a few changes. I substituted HALF the blueberries for cranberries and added a touch extra sugar to balance out the sourness of the cranberries. i also substituted 2% milk for soy milk, and brown sugar instad of white.

I really like this recipe and made a few modifications that really seemed to work. 1 1/4 C of regular flour 1/4 C of brown sugar 3/4 C oat bran 2 small mashed ripe bananas (maybe 3/4 cup) 2 Eggs 3 Tablespoons Vegetable oil then I added some orange zest...maybe 1-2 teaspoons I couldn't find my muffin pan so I baked it as a quick rise bread and it turned out great. 400 degrees for a little over an hour. I didn't have any problem with the blueberries falling to the bottom of the pan as my mixture was thick My husband and I love it.

I just made these, with a few changes as per the other comments, and a few of my own. I used equal parts all purpose flour, whole wheat pastry flour, and barley flour instead of just all purpose flour. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and used only 1 and a half bananas. I substituted flax seed for the oat bran, used oat milk instead of soy milk, and subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I also cut the blueberries down to 1 cup, and added half a teaspoon of vanilla. Despite cutting back on the banana and blueberries, the muffins still came out mooshy. They taste pretty good, but if I made them again I'd cut down to 3/4 cup blueberries, and maybe just 1 banana.

I liked the fact that it was very easy to prepare. I used 3% milk and whole-wheat flour instead of the soy milk and oat bran, and I only used two over-ripe bananas. I would definitely make this again but I don't think I'd add any sugar at all as the muffins were a bit too sweet.

Rating: 1
I thought i would attempt this recipe as per the original recipe. Let's just say that next time i will be making the recommended substitutes. The muffins turned out a little too sweet due to the volume of blueberries. The blueberries also made them really gummy on the bottom. I would recommend using half the amount in future. 5 out of 5 people that have tried them so far, did not like them at all and all said that they would leave the blueberries out if it was up to them.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe to use up blueberries that aren't nice enough to eat fresh. I modified liberally and doubled the batch: all whole wheat flour, brown sugar, combination of ground flax, wheat germ and oats for the oat bran, applesauce for half of the banana, flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flax + 3 tbsp water = 1 egg, mix and let sit for several minutes), 1% milk and some chopped dried apricots. They were done in ~22 minutes and taste great- not too sweet, moist but not gummy. Definitely would make these again.

As did most people, I modified the recipe based on comments a I read. I did the flour 1/2 white 1/2 wheat. I used oat meal instead of oat bran. I used one banana. I used 1% milk. and I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also used fresh blueberries since they are on sale right now :) Everyone in my family said the liked them. Even my husband who tries anything with wheat flour hesitantly. The best part is each muffin is packed with blueberries!

Not bad... I did find them to be a bit on the gummy side due to the bananas, but it doesn't harm the overall taste. I added cinnamon as suggested in a previous review. An excellent suggestion. Although I am partial to making them healthy, I feared the low sugar so I used brown sugar instead of white and piled it a little higher than the 1/2 cp mark. Still found them to be a bit bland despite the added sugar and cinnamon.

I made these for my breast-feeding sister who was looking for healthy early-morning snacks when the little guy gets her up. We both liked them. I did half and half whole wheat and all-purpose flour - and forgot the oat bran, though i think having the whole wheat helped. Also did half and half brown and white - though next time i'd go all brown to give them a little more colour. Otherwise - delicious!

Yum! Substituted oatmeal for oat bran and skim milk for soy, and used two bananas. They came out light and fluffy. Husband, two year old and one year old all loved them.

I just made these and they turned out great but like pretty much everyone else I modified the recipe. I used 1 cup of unbleached flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat. Also I didn't have any bananas so I peeled, cored and chopped a granny smith apple and a red pear and microwaved them for about 6 minutes. I added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream to the mash. I also used 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of splenda. To boost the health aspect I add a sachet of Salba as well. I didn't bother with the paper muffin cups and just sprayed the muffin tin with pam. They came out beautifully! I will definitely make these again.

I made muffins from half the batter and bread from the other half. The muffins glued themselves to the muffin wrappers and were very hard to eat...next time I will skip the wrappers! The bread turned out very well, but I still felt like something was missing. I would also use less sugar next time because the blueberries already add so much sweetness to it.

These were great muffins! It is a nice recipe because you can be very flexible with ingredients depending upon what you have on hand. I used mixed frozen berries, 1/2 whole wheat flour, whole milk instead of soy. Didn't have oat bran so I used regular oat meal. I also threw in a bit of coconut and some flax seed. I followed someone else's advise and used 1 teasp. lemon juice and 1 teasp. vanilla. Would definitely make again, healthy and not too sweet.

I loved these muffins! I used buttermilk instead of soy milk because of the over-binding concerns. Aso i used half whole-wheat flour.

I've made it many times since discovering it a few months ago; it's remarkably tasty considering all the healthy ingredients; still delicious if you use 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 cup of the regular flour; and a nice touch is to sprinkle with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar before baking.

Our family's favorite solution to overripe bananas. I've brought them in ziplock bags on a number of business trips for an alternative to hotel breakfast and airplane food.

I found these just ok. Taste was not bad but I did not like the texture. I used whole milk instead of soy milk as other reviewers said it make the muffins sticky. They were still a bit sticky and lacked the usual light fluffy texture of a good muffin.

Rating: 4
I tweaked this recipe a bit when I made it because of the reviews saying that it came out "gummy." The reason it did so is because soy milk is a binder, just like eggs. So when I made it I left out the egg and added in 1/4 c. of regular milk on top of the soy milk that was already called for. If you're vegan and don't want to use cow's milk, just replace the egg with some other non-binding liquid in this recipe. I suspect orange juice would be good, but water would be fine too. Also, I replaced 1/2 c. of the blueberries with walnuts and it turned out really well. Overall, not gummy at all, but not as lemony as I would have liked--otherwise, quite yummy.

Not to my taste. I made the recipe as is: no substitutions and I found it overly sweet and a little gummy. I find I'm more likely to get a gummy product using soy in ANY baking but then add on oat bran, and, well, you get it. The cooks who sub'd in yogurt and milk instead of soy probably got a different texture. I don't like it enough to try to tweak it to my taste and I'm not vegan so I'll move on...

Really tasty muffins! As others mentioned, this is a great recipe to mess around with and add your favorite flavors. I changed it up by using only 1tsp lemon juice then added 1tsp vanilla and 2tsp cinnamon. I used 2% milk instead of soy, oats instead of oatbran, and apples instead of blueberries. I also added 1/3 cup flax- meal and 1/4 cup of raisins. Lastly, I baked the muffins for an additional 5 minutes (i like them very brown on top). They were great can't wait to try these in summer with fresh berries!

I must confess that I was disappointed with the texture (a popover moistness) when they were fresh from the oven, but by the next day -after being in a sealed container overnight- they realized their full potential. The texture was absolutely perfect. In the future, I'll make them a day in advance. I also followed others recommendations and used oat meal instead of oat bran, reduced the lemon juice to 1 tsp., added 1 tsp. vanilla, used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. I modified it further by adding about 1/3 c. of flaked coconut and 1/3 c. of crushed hi-fiber flax flakes. Amazing muffins!

I used: 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for part of the flour, wheat germ & bran instead of oat bran, grated lemon rind instead of lemon juice, whole milk, doubled the oil and added 1/4 c. ground almonds. I changed it a bit but it tasted pretty good out of the oven with butter! I made this for my toddler and she loved them! Baked 23 mins.

Yum - like others, I had a couple of brown bananas to use up along with some (March, i.e., questionable) fresh blueberries and was happy to find this recipe this Sunday morning. I subbed whole milk, 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, and all brown sugar but otherwise stuck to the recipe and was pleasantly surprised by how good these were. The oat bran adds quite a bit, I think. I also had a problem with sticking to the paper liners - my only complaint about this recipe!

I thought the muffins tasted really nice, but didn't want to fork rate this recipe as the texture came out so heavily, and I suspect I'm doing something wrong.

These muffins are delicious and healthy, and I suspect that anyone who had problems might have erred during preparation!

I made a few adjustments and they are great! I used Whole Wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar, 1% Milk, and Old Fashioned Oatmeal instead of Oat Bran. I also sprayed the Muffin cups with Pam so they don't fall apart. They turned out really good, low calorie, and almost sugar-free! It's a great diet snack and it doesn't taste diet!

Flexible, easy recipe. Not a wow...but good for what it is.

These were great---I was also doubtful about using unthawed blueberries, but they worked better than when I've used fresh! I also used whole milk in place of soy and quick-cooking oatmeal in place of oat bran as I had neither soy milk nor oat bran on hand, and my family and friends ate them up!

I have made this recipe 3 times now, and it is turning into a classic in our household. Everyone loves them. I too had changed the recipe slightly and used a third whole wheat flour, a third regular flour, and a third oatmeal. They're healthier, substantial, and delicious! Frozen blueberries are a must or else you'll end up with mushballs.

Great recipe - quick, easy, and not-too-sweet. My mother and I made them this morning to general acclaim from the whole family; the muffins were nice and fluffy, and best of all, you didn't feel guilty for wolfing down a second! Used 1% milk instead of soy (didn't have any around the house), and also had to increase the baking time by five minutes or so because of the frozen berries (anyone know why the recipe calls for them unthawed? I assume it's to keep the batter from turning purple, but it may be a flavor trick I'm unaware of). I'm looking forward to making these with the real-deal fresh blueberries, too, and think they'll be even better.

I altered the recipe slightly because of what I had on hand. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour,1 cup all purpose flour and 1/4 cup quick cooking Irish Oatmeal. Also used low fat regular milk. I filled my muffin cups and realized I had not added the blueberries. I simply pushed 3-4 berries into each muffin and then sprinkled a little turbinado sugar. These were not at all heavy with these ingredients. I would definitely make them again.

Have made this 4 or 5 times now. My only complaint is the muffin falls apart when peeling the muffin cup off. My kids love these. I put in freezer for quick, healthy breakfast before school. Easy to make - my 6 year old loves to help. Very easy, definately not a dry muffin and yummy. Am trying today with frozen blueberries for the 1st time...hope that works, too.

These muffins are moist and fluffy. I used regular 2% milk instead of soy, 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 c all purpose, wheat bran instead of oat and extended the baking time until the muffins browned since I had frozen blueberries. I had intended to add cinnamon (which I usually add to banana breads), but forgot and found that the banana and blueberries are great compliments to each other and are flavourful enough.

Yuk. I thought that these muffins were tasteless, heavy, and had an awful consistency. They didn't brown up at all in the oven, they just looked pale...I threw them all away!

I also felt these muffins were very dense and "gummy," as another reviewer noted. I wonder if this is because I didn't mash the banana well enough, and I would try the recipe again with a puree, as opposed to a rough mash. They could also have been sweeter. The cooking time for frozen berries is longer than the time noted on the recipe, as the berries cool the batter down considerably; using frozen berries, I left mine in the oven for an extra 6-7 minutes before they baked.

This recipe made lovely, light, fluffy muffins. My only complaint is that the batter was slightly bitter ... I blame that on the lemon juice, but it could have been the fact that I used olive oil. In the future, I would omit the lemon juice and substitute a tsp of lemon zest. I might also experiment with other flavors, like vanilla. Nice to have another way to use those bananas other than banana bread.

while these tasted good, the texture was wierd. for some reason, almost every muffin recipe i try comes out heavy and gummy. don't know what i'm doing wrong; i know my stove is okay, and i follow the recipe, don't overstir. any ideas??

It was delicious and a nice alternative to high-fat/high-calorie banana bread. Next time I make it, I might try leaving out the blueberries...they were a bit overwhelming the last time I made this.

My teenage son and husband loved these muffins. Nice airy texture, great flavor, and healthful with ingredients we always have around. Ditto to the turbinado sugar on top. Makes them taste a little more indulgent!

I didn't have enough banana so I made up the difference with a good quality sweetened applesauce. Also used lactose free milk instead of the soy. They turned out great and will probably be even better using the full amount of bananas. From now on, this will be the recipe I use to get rid of overripe bananas. In fact, I'll probably buy a few extra bananas just to make sure I have extras for this . . . . also, sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top just before baking.

i had some left over overly ripe bananas, but i didnt want to make a heavy banana bread. this bread was perfect! i made it in a 8x8 with one tsp of baking soda instead of the baking powder. it was so great that my boyfriend ate the entire thing in 2 days! i am thrilled to have a healthy substitue for banana bread!
