Excellent, I've made this several times and I'm always satisfied with the result. Like other reviewers I prefer to pan sear the filets, and usually use a stilton blue instead of gorgonzola, and agree that you don't really need the sauce.....it's quite good either way.

These make a delicious entree to prepare ahead for a dinner party. I modified the recipe slightly by adding 1 clove minced garlic and 3 tablespoons dry vermouth to the duxelle mixture. I also doubled the gorgonzola. Based on previous reviews, I also doubled the mushroom and seared my 7-8 oz. filets 90 seconds per side before assembling the wellingtons. The pastries browned well before the 20 minutes, so I removed them from the oven at 125 degrees, just under 20 minutes. However, with the resting before serving, the meat was overcooked medium to medium well-- a disappointment for all of the prep. I used a Williams-Sonoma demiglace with Madeira, but the cup is completely unnecessary. 1/2 cup warmed with 5 tablespoons of wine was a perfect accompaniment.

Rating: 4
Yes, good recipe. Just two comments from me. Gorgonzola melts away and leaves a light flavor. Nice. Williams-Sonoma demiglace is incredibly salty. The meat was all so moist from the gorgonzola and mushrooms, it didn't really need the sauce either.

Great dish, everyone loved it. Made this for a Christmas day dinner party of 22.... Yeah, a lot of work but it was worth it. Followed the recipe mostly as written, used beef stock instead of veal demiglace (nobody noticed the difference), and upped the garlic content quite a bit. My only caveat to everyone is don't overcook the filets during the pre-bake. Two of my filets were much smaller than the others, and as a result after the second baking cycle they were well done - the others all came out medium. The well done filets were, well, no where near as good as the medium ones.

Ok..this was fantastic. I did a Williams-Sonoma demi glace sauce recipe with Cognac...to die for. Made extra mushrooms to put on the side with sauce. Seared 3 min/side in my 17" Lodge cast iron pan...cooled and then after wrapping in puff pastry finished in oven 20 minutes. Oh..Made little Christmas tree cutouts on top of puff pastry...guests just loved!! Served with roasted asparagus and fingerling potatoes..perfect!

I had a problem keeing the meat to medium rare and the pastry cooked to light brown - twice got well done meat??

This is the most awesome recipe ever. I do the pastry cutouts too..mostly fall leaves as I make this usually in fall and winter. I never could find Sercial Maderia but I open a can of beef consume and add equal parts of Maderia to a pan, reduce for a few minutes at high heat, turn down the heat and add a bit of corn starch blended smooth in water then simmer for a few minutes until thickened. This is definately a show stopper and everyone thnks its so hard...lol!

This recipe has become a standby in my household for those times when I want to wow my guests with a flavorful main course that doesn't require much active preparation. They always turn out perfectly. Even if you guests don't like cheese or mushrooms, they *will* rave about this entree because it is so rich. I agree with the tips to double the cheese and mushroom mixture and to sear the filets mignons as opposed to baking them. A quick sear gives the steak a very nice color and flavor that complements the mushroom and the cheese wonderfully. I will also try out the suggestion another reviewer had of decorating the Beef Wellingtons with small cutouts of pastry. As this is going to be a Valentine's Day main course, a little heart would be very cute.

I'm having a dinner party soon, so I decided to try this out on my husband before serving to guests. He flipped over it, says it's the best thing I ever made. I did chop up the mushrooms instead of slicing and drained them on a paper towel so they pastry would not get soggy. I bought the demi-glace from Williams Sonoma, and made their basic sauce recipe and then added marsala wine and sauteed mushrooms. Yum!

This tasted fantastic. I didn't make the sauce because demiglace seemed to make it even heavier, and I planned to make the green peppercorn sauce for the Tyler Florence recipe for beef wellington. But I ran out of time and served it without a sauce at all, and it was fantastic. People wouldn't stop talking about it.

This recipe has become a favorite for Christmas and birthday celebrations in our house. I always use a bit extra gongonzola, but make the wellingtons exactly according to the recipe otherwise. I skip the demiglace sauce and make the Red- Wine Reduction recipe found on Epicurious.com, reducing until slightly thick (syrupy). It is fantastic with the wellingtons.

We had this dish this past weekend and it was delicious! To make it a little cheaper and easier, I used 3/4" filets, which really worked out just fine. Also, I did not have time to whip up my own demi-glace, and I couldn't find the mix at my grocery store, so I did a mix for "brown gravy" and added some fresh thyme and thought it was still really good. Served with Oven Baked Fingerling Potatoes and Green Beans seasoned with Celery Seed, Kosher Salt, and Pepper. Finished with a store bought cheesecake and the Balsamic Strawberries (from the Marscopone Cheesecake recipe) and all was great!

High marks! I made this over the weekend and everyone absolutely loved it! I added a splash of cognac to the mushrooms while they were cooking. Oh - I was also out of madeira, so I substituted port into the demiglace. I sort of had my doubts before making this dish, but, it came highly-recommended. The mushrooms, gorgonzola, beef and puff pastry are simply delicious. The combination of everything just works! I highly recommend this recipe and absolutely will make it again.

"Delicious! I plan to make it again, but will have some guests who are not fond of rare meat. Any recommentations for how long to roast it the first time so that it comes out medium or medium well? I could do trial and error, but I'm sure that somebody has already figured it out. Thanks

Outstanding! I made the recipe as written with the exception of Feta cheese in place of Gorgonzola (couldn't find it in our little grocery stores). I have to admit (real chefs - please don't get mad at me), I didn't have the time to make the demi-glace from scratch (4 small kids). I used a mix (gasp!) and added to it. Surprisingly, it turned out really well. I will definitely save this recipe for another special meal.

Wonderful-someone in my house dislikes Gorgonzola, so i used brie instead and it was fantastic.

Amazing recipe and I'd definitely make this again. I made it for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it. I followed what some others suggested and doubled both the mushroom topping and the gorgonzola (which melted quite a bit so it wasn't huge chunks of cheese). Next time, I'd buy extra dough so that it wasn't as difficult to fold without tearing.

Rating: 4
This recipe is incredibly impressive and yet so easy and you can make it ahead with no problem. I found the cheese a little strong, but I used extra. Since I had leftover puff pastry, and I was serving for Christmas Eve, I used small bell shaped cookie cutters to make shapes to place atop the wellingtons, which made them look very elegant. The pastry doesn't really puff with this recipe, so the bells kept their shape. I made the sauce using plain old marsala and it was great.

Definitely a winner. Made this many times, and have to say it's simple and you can prepare in the morning and be guaranteed that it will be an awesome meal. I have served it for Xmas Eve... with some quickly sauteed tomatoes fresh herbs, a little sea salt, and fresh pepper, and spinach timbales that was in one of the Gourmet magazines. Great Xmas colors and SIMPLE!

Um, guys, if you look over the recipe again, you are supposed to flip the Wellingtons upside down (seam down) when you put them on the pan. If you follow the directions there should be no need for a modification to prevent a soggy bottom.

Put the mushroom and cheese mixture on top of the meat. Drape the pastry over the meat and pinch at sides. No more worries about a soggy bottom.

Had a dinner party of eight and without exception they all enjoyed it. I did not use the Madeira with my demi glace but rather the wine I was serving with dinner.

I made this first last New Year's Eve. They were amazing and I have made them several times since. I want to thank everyone for the great tips. They were invaluable. My only tip is to squeeze the water out of mushrooms after they have been sauteed (duxelles). So easy to make and so impressive!

This dish was such a hit when I first prepared it that I have made it several times since then. I like to do most of the prep work the night before (1st cooking of meat, mushroom mixture) and then I wrap the meat, cool and then cook on the day that I'm serving. This is a nice dish to prepare when having company because you don't have to stand over the stove while everyone else is having a good time in the other room.

Simple elegance. Made for 11 people, wow were they impressed. Had to alter a bit(couldn't use shrooms) I wrapped filets with lump crab meat and brie cheese, land and sea style. Red wine-herb demi, simple mashers and asparagus. Garnished with stuffed vine tomatoes. Filets needed only 15 minutes to bake. Some were more done than others...preheated baking sheets are a good idea. Will definitely make again.

My husband can not stop raving about this dish -- definately in his top 5 favorites. I too seared the meat and doubled the mushroom & gorgonzola. For future, since I like my meat more well done (with little to no pink) I will sear for longer than 2 minutes. Loved how easy it was to make and could prepare everything in advance. My husband heated up the leftovers and enjoyed it just as much. Perfect for a dinner party.

I am making this for the second time this week, it is fantastic! Very easy, your guests will be impressed. I am changing it a bit this time by substituting fried shallots for the mushrooms. Definately take the suggestions of those who came before: sear the steaks first for five minutes each side (hint: if you want your steak medium rare, you can add the oven roasting to your pan-searing), double the cheese and mushroom mixture, and definitely preheat the pan. The sauce was great, I found an individual serving of the demi-glace at a local food mart, it was only $5.11, and worth the cost, although I simmered it longer to make it a bit more concentrated. With roasted carrots and garlic mashed potatoes, this is one of my favorites for a simple but super-fancy holiday dish!

This recipe was great, made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit. Instead of pre-baking the steaks though we just quickly seared them in a hot pan and stuck them back in the fridge.

This is a very simple recipe and we'll definitely do it again. The guests were duly impressed. Served with bacon-wrapped asperagus that were baked along with the wellingtons.

This is an amazing recipe - easy and dazzling at the same time, which is unbelievable. I doubled the mushroom and gorgonzola mixture as recommended (although I gave myself less mushrooms as I'm not a fan). I also seared the steaks rather than cooking them in the oven, and I preheated the baking tray in the oven as suggested. I served this with green beans, mashed potatoes, and a cranberry/madeira sauce, all washed down with an Aussie Shiraz. Yum.

Made for Father's Day dinner and it was terrific! This dish was actually quite simple to prepare - you just need to allow enough time for the various cooking & cooling stages. I drained my mushroom mixture in a fine strainer to remove excess liquid, which worked great. Would definitely add MORE gorgonzola to each wellington next time! I didn't have demi-glace, so I added beef drippings from the roasting pan to a can of beef broth and reduced it down before adding the wine. I lined my baking pan with parchment before baking off the wellingtons and it worked like a charm. Delicious.

I have made this recipe several times. It is very, very easy to make and will look like you slaved for hours. I love that it can be made ahead (day before). I sometimes substitute the Gorgonzola with the milder Borgonzola, Boursin, or Torta which is layers of Gorgonzola and Mascarpone. Serve with steamed asparagus and Rosemary Garlic Roasted Potatos, Australian Shiraz (Lindemann's Bin 50), and Creme Brulee for desert. You will feel like you died and went to heaven. Our guests are always delighted with this meal.

I, too, have reviewed this before and just prepared this for a Valentine's dinner with my husband. It was better than ever, but I disagree strongly with the technique of roasting to rare as your first step. As others have said, simply sear the tenderloins - about 60-90 seconds per side - before chilling. I seared mine in a bit of butter after brushing them lightly with Dijon mustard and seasoning with salt, pepper, and thyme. Also, I incorporated the gorgonzola into the cooked mushroom mixture after removing from the heat/ After wrapping in the pastry and chilling them, 20 minutes at 425 turned out beautifully medium rare beef with the pastry done just right. Also, agree that these stand on their own without a sauce, but I prefer a quick Madeira sauce, from Silver Palate Basics - without the expense of demi glace.

I have reviewed this before (last V-day, as a matter of fact!) but I have made it again, and I wanted to just reiterate how much I love this dish! I doubled the recipe for a V-day dinner party this year, and it was even better than the first time I made it. One small change I made - I only seared the filets, and did not roast them. My filets were only 1" thick and the result was beef that was perfectly cooked after being baked in the puff pastry. I also made a vegetarian version with portobello caps for our vegetarian guests, and they loved it!

I am a pastry student in Manhattan and had some frozen puff pastry i had made and wanted to use so I made this dish for Valentine's Day. My husband who takes clients out to all the best restaurants in Manhattan said it was the best thing he had ever eaten in his life. I do have some important pointers though. The first which I learned in pastry school is the bottom of your puff pastry will become very soggy unless it is baked on a PRE-HEATED sheet pan and the chilling for an hour before baking is very important or the puff pastry will lose it's shape and not hold in the contents well. Also, ditch the demi-glace and serve it with no sauce or maybe try a good beef gravy. I found the sauce to be very mediocre. I used three large portabella mushrooms and extra butter to saute them in and also put a little extra gorgonzola in. EXCELLENT!!! Can't wait to make it again.

To the cook who posted on 12/03/03...my meat market sells a concentrated Demi Glace for under $4.00. For a resource, go to www.morethangourmet.com.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve and everyone liked it. A couple of points: I thought the meat was a bit tough which could have been the luck of the draw or maybe the par-cooking method. Also--I found it easier to cut the puff pastry into quarters first and then roll it out. Lastly, I think it should have more of the mushrooms and gorgonzola than the recipe called for in each wellington.

Incredbile! The recipe received rave reviews and left guests asking for more! This is, however, a true holiday dish with a price tag worthy of a once-a-year indulgence. The jar of demiglace alone was $30...but the receipe is well worth every penny for a special dinner.

My feelings: Don't use any salt nor a demi glace that contains salt... the cheese topping is salty enough. Use a meat thermometer as the cooking times in this recipe produced a "bloody rare" finished entree. Use plenty of egg wash when constructing your pastry shell, the seams will adhere better! Enjoy...this was much easier than expected!

This went over great at Xmas eve dinner. I didn't have Gorgonzola, but substituted some Danish Blue cheese. The cheese seemed a little strong, but very good. I made the sauce that is in the Cook's Illustrated version, it was excellent. I also highly recommend dry aging the filets for a couple of days, gives the meat a richer flavor. Every single wellington leaked a bit, but that is probably ok since it kept the crust from getting soggy. This was probably due to my inexperience with sealing up the puff pastry, which I'll do a better job of next time. Overall, a spectacular result from a fairly easy recipe!

I definitely cheated & this dish was still great. I decided the puff pastry presentation was not worth the extra calories & fat (especially since creme brulee was planned for desert). I seared 6 oz steaks for 2 minutes per side & then roasted them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes- they were very tender and very rare- I'll cook them longer next time. I crumbled the gorgonzola on top of the steaks the last 2 minutes of cooking time so it would get nice & gooey & heated the mushroom mixture on the stove. Not as completely "hands off" as the puff pastry method, but was still very easy to do & enjoy time with my guests as well.

I'm making it again soon because I bought ingrediants for four and didn't want to waste it on my 5 yr old son who might tell me it's as good as cheese bologna. Cheers.

Oh my heavens! This was unforgettable. I didn't have 2 1/2 hours to make the demiglaze, so I made the "quick brown sauce" from Joy of Cooking (in 30 min) without the Madeira -and it was the finishing touch that made the dish to die for. I will make it again, without changing a thing. Try this recipe!!!!

Will not rate the recipe because not liking the dish had nothing to do with the recipe. I love bleu cheeses and I love steak. Thought this couldn't go wrong, but I found out that I despise melted or warm or hot bleu cheese in any form.

Oh wow! I made these for our first wedding anniversary yesterday. I pre-cooked the filet and mushroom mixture so all I had to do was assemble and let rest. So very yummy and pretty easy if you plan ahead. My internal temp was about 120 when I precooked them but were still very pink inside after cooking. No complaints from my husband as he likes his meat raw! I doubled the mushrooms and increased the cheese a bit since we are gorgonzola lovers. Mmmm. Think this will be a party favorite.

I made this for a six person Christmas dinner party. Everyone loved it. I agree about doubling mushrooms, but not the cheese. At first, I too thought that the squares weren't big enough for the 6-oz. filets; however, the dough stretches, so just play with it a little and it should completely cover the filet.

Rating: 4
This is a GREAT recipe. I've made it three times and have gotten rave reviews each time. I do not eat meat so for one of the wellingtons I substitute mashed potatoes for the beef...very tasty! The fact that you need to make them ahead of time is also a big help as there is no last minute fussing.

Rating: 4
Absolutely FANTASTIC!!! Would give this recipe 5 forks if I could. It's imperative that you double the mushroom mixture and Gorgonzola. My filets were also too big for the puff pastry, so I cut the other sheet into fourths and enclosed the beef that way. I followed the roasting instructions exactly, and my filets came out perfectly medium rare. Wasn't too excited about the demiglace sauce, so next time, I will try a different recipe -- or even cut out the sauce altogether. The Wellingtons are soooo good on their own.....they absolutely just melt in your mouth. A huge hit at my Christmas dinner!

WOW!! this is a show stopper!! I doubled the cheese and mushroom..this is a must, also I served at Christmas time and cut poinsetta flower petals and rolled a little pastry to form the center then"painted" with red food coloring with a pastry brush dipped first in egg,then the food color...they turned out beautiful!! I served asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes and scallop orange spinish salad as the first course

Excellent recipe - especially for entertaining purposes as you can do everything in advance and then just put it in the oven. Agree with previous reviewers about increasing the amount of mushrooms and gorgonzola.

I just don't know what I did wrong. I used the phillo paper instead of puff pastery, and the paper came out soggy. The steaks were cooked a bit too much, and I thought the sause was just OK. I think grilling the steaks and topping it with the mushroom/cheese mixture would have been so much better. Everyone was a bit disappointed.

I made this for the first time 3 years ago or so, and it was a smashing success at my small dinner party, have made it 2x since - again to rave reviews. I love it because I can make most of it before the guests arrive and all I need do is pop it into the oven when I am ready. I have followed the recipe to the letter (& I love the puff pastry, mine fits the fillets just great, and it hasn't burned once) there is nothing I would change what-so-ever!

Rating: 2
After reading all the hype others left for this recipe I made it last night for a small dinner party and I must say I was somewhat disappointed. I used phyllo instead of puffed pastry, it burned. The next time I would simply keep the filet whole, slice a 1" slice lengthwise and stuff it with the mushroom and gorgonzola mixture, still using the sauce. I doubled the mushrooms and would double the sauce also. The pastry covering wouldn't make or break the recipe.

Rating: 4
Cooked this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Doubling the mushroom mixture was a good idea but I think I will stick to the recommended amount of gorgonzola next time or use stilton which is less salty. Also, you could quite easily reduce the weight of each steak to around 4 ounces. I served them with roasted vegetables.

Rating: 3
OK, we love this dish. However, we find it better (and easier) to make with phyllo rather than puff pastry. For one, your standard package of Pepperidge Farm doesn't yield enough to wrap the filets; I ended up making pastry "boats" rather than packages. But, overall, the tastes are great.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious! I (very quickly) seared the filet mignons in a really hot cast iron skillet instead of starting them in the oven. After cooling, it helps to pat them dry before putting them in the pastry - they were bloody rare after searing but the final product came out to an extremely tender medium. Also, I used the brown bits from the skillet to cook the mushroom mixture in. Wonderful!

Made this as a trial run tonight for my father's birthday dinner tomorrow. I prefer the searing of the meat. For those of you whose puff pastry isn't cooking in the 20 minutes, resulting in overdone meat, make sure your oven is preheated. This recipe was good, add more mushroom/shallot mixture, and play with the sauce using a little good quality balsamic, etc. I feel the sauce is a must have, looks nice on the plate. I am going to ditch the cheese for myself from now on, but not for my guests. Overall very rich, 5 oz. filets more than enough for a serving if you are having garlic mashed, potatoes vegetable, salad, etc.

I made this for celebrating Christmas with my sis and brother in law....they were blown away and happily took the leftovers home as I wasn't going to have chance to use them. Great company meal. Although I changed the sauce by using merlot and adding sliced mushrooms and some thyme to it.

I read previous reviews carefully, as I hadn't worked with puff pastry before. Was a bit concerned that my squares weren't large enough to completely enclose the meat. Not to worry. They were delicious even though I had to make a well-done version for a weird relative. She loved it!

Rating: 3
Excellent......Word of caution, though if making several. I made 14 at once and they were too close to each other in the pan....causing the sides of the pastry to not get done at the appropriate time. Be sure and leave air space between each one...so the sides cook at the same pace as the tops. This was a good dinner party dish which everyone loved.

Rating: 3
I am pleased to have instructions how to prepare this dish in advanced. The trick is to have everything very cold, including the meat. Sear the meat,1 minute a side, and do not roast it. Wrap the fillets well before chilling and pat dry before wrapping in dough. Double the gorgonzola, but not the mushroom pate. My sauce was made with half a cup beef broth, half a cup Maderia, 1 teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet, juice from half a lemon, 2 tablespoons butter, and cornstarch to thicken. (Recipe from Colorado Cache Cookbook). Well received by guests and so pretty to serve.

Rating: 3
Although I didn't like mine very much my other family members did and my daughter is a very fussy eater. I grilled the filets on high for 2 minutes per side and after baking it before serving the meat was done perfectly and it looked beautiful. I didn't get the mushroom/cheese flavor at all! Based on all the great reviews I will try this again. This time I DID double the mushroom and cheese. Also, I bought veal demiglace ($7.15 for 5 oz) and supplimented it with veal stock the result was very thin and not very flavorful. Next time I'll add a cornstarch or flour - or try a different sauce recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner. To quote my sister (who is a very fussy eater) and my husband (who is a chef) -- "IT WAS THE BEST MEAL YOU'VE EVER MADE!!" I followed the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the mushroom and cheese mixtures. It was the first time I used puff pastry, so it took awhile to get used to it, but it was sure worth it. This recipe will become a gourmet staple for dinner parties. Thanks, Epicurious for making my Christmas dinner a success.

I just made this for Xmas Eve dinner and it was a hit. The Gorgonzola gave just a hint of flavor and even those who aren't in love with this cheese, savored every bite. I would cook the filets a touch less next time to ensure they remain pink in the middle when done. Some of the smaller ones were a little well done. Delicious and easier than it looks at first glance.

Rating: 3
After reading all the reviews I decided to double the mushrooms and gorgonzola which was a wise decision. I made our wellingtons 2 nights before serving with disappointing results. The meat was fine - added 3 minutes to the initial roast and added 7 minutes to the final roast. The centers of each wellington was pink and not bloody. The puff pastry was the disaster - ended up too doughy and tasteless despite initially rolling out, covering under refrigeration and egg wash. I think the puff pastry absorbed some of the juices of the chilled meat. Still not giving up hold on this recipe. Next time will try searing meat with the preroast.

Rating: 4
For those of you who have some venison in your freezer from this years hunting season - you MUST try this recipe with venison fillet! The gorgonzola adds wonderful taste to the venison. Try a medley of wild mushrooms instead of plain button mushrooms. I agree with other reviewers, that the amount of gorgonzola and mushrooms should be increased. Also, the venison fillets are usually smaller than beef, so the initial baking should be shortened a bit. If you have the opportunity to cook with venison, this is a must and will make a 5-star dinner with your venison fillets!

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe to the letter, with one exception the sauce. I used 1 can of beef broth (14 0z. size) reduced to 4 ozs., plus 4 ozs. veal reduction sauce...This recipe is fit for a king/queen. For those who are busy, it is marvelous, because you can have it ready hours ahead, except for the last 20 minutes. I used 6 0z filets, baked at 12 minutes (first step) and they were cooked to perfection. However, if you exceed the 6 oz. size, you had better adjust the initial baking time. One of the VERY BEST recipes ever....Thanks a million!!!

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful recipe, however, I agree with the other reviewers, need more of the gorgonzola and mushroom mixture. The initial 12 minute roasting was insufficient so I left it in the oven and used a meat thermometer to determine when the meat was rare. Unfortunately, the pastry took longer than 20 minutes to brown, so meat was a little overdone at the end. Overall, will definitely be making this again, with some modifications.

Rating: 4
I agree with most of the other "reviewers"...this is an incredibly wonderful dish! Double the gorgonzola and/or mushrooms to your taste. I tried searing the meat and also pre-roasting. Both worked well for me. Instead of the mushrooms, I used a wonderful duxelles recipe from a Beef Wellington recipe in the Nov/Dec 2001 issue of Cooks Illustrated. Ingredients are mushrooms, butter, shallots, heavy cream, Madeira and thyme. It was really superb. Email me if you want the recipe. I served the Wellingtons as a main course for Thanksgiving, with only fresh asparagus and hollandaise as an accompaniment. Really splendid! It's so wonderful to have such an elegant main dish that can be done completely ahead of time. Oh....I really didn't think it needed a sauce.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I made thsi for my husband's birthday and we were quite impressed. I did double the mushrooms mixture and cheese and it was quite flavorful. The meat needed to be roasted a bit longer than the time called for to reach the proper temperature during the initial roasting. I could not find demiglace so used beef consomme and mixed with some cabernet that we were drinking, and thickened for a sauce. Served it with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. I will be making this for Christmas dinner!

Rating: 4
It took longer than 20 minutes for the puff pastry to brown on the final roasting, so the beef ended up really overdone. I would definitely just sear the meat like others have recommended instead of preroasting for 12 minutes. Also recommend doubling the mushrooms but doubling the cheese was too much for me. Delicious with baby pearl onions and a brown sauce, and the presentation is spectacular if you decorate the wellingtons.

Rating: 4
I have made this on several occasions with great success. I add more cheese than it calls for, as I love the blend of flavors that the gorgonzola and the beef produce...have also used Maytag Blue when making this in lieu of the gorgonzola and it also is very delicious.

I made this for a dinner party of 8 and it was hugely successful. I seared the filets (7 to 8 ounces each)for 6 minutes on both sides and placed them in the pan in the oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. I also added some Pinot Noir to the sauteed mushroom. This is definately a keeper and extremely easy. I served the Wellingtons with asaragus flans and a simple salad to start.

Delicious! So easy to make and my husband loved it. Next time I would sprinkle the cheese all over the pastry dough. Having it just in the middle wasn't enough. Also, I have never used Demiglace before (real expensive), and did not know that I had to add water, oops. Sauce was very good, just too strong. Thank goodness I am having left overs tonight, and can weaken the sauce to perfection. Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, mushrooms, and gorgonzolla.

I was so impressed by this recipe! It was so simple and soooo good. This is definitely one to use for special occasions. The blend of flavors is well-balanced; I was worried that the cheese would be overpowering but it complemented the other ingredients nicely. I roasted the filets initially for 15 minutes rather than 12, as I prefer medium doneness, and they were perfectly tender and juicy. Also used Crimini mushrooms and had to improvise on the sauce, as I couldn't find any demiglace without special-ordering it. All things considered, this is a standout recipe, and I will likely be making this when I host my first dinner for my in-laws.

I think I've made this dish 3 times this month. It's delicious, very impressive, and so easy to make. Doubling the mushroom/Gorgonzola is a given. For the meat, I heat a little olive oil in a pan until smoking, season, then sear each side of beef 2 minutes exactly, then cool before assembling. Then, I have those yummy pan juices to saute shallots in, then deglaze with a little Madeira, reduce, add beef broth, reduce, swirl in some unsalted butter, and you have a delicious sauce.

I've made this three times, and will serve it at a dinner party for 24 next month. I love that everything can be made in advance. I add some red wine to the mushrooms at the end of cooking, and cook until liquid is evaporated. Instead of baking the fillets in the oven, I quickly sear them in a pan to seal in the juices. I serve this with a merlot/beef stock reduction. I've made several variations of welingtons, and this is the best.

I've made these twice and it's one of those great recipes when you want to spend time with your dinner companions. Do everything the night before and relax while it bakes. I doubled the puff pastry, because I doubled the mushrooms, cheese, garlic and shallots. Even with doubling the gorgonzola, the flavor is very subtle. I used additional puff pastry to make ribbons/bows on the outside. Baked until 120 degrees on final bakeoff and they were medium. A little difficult to regulate the meat temp, without watching closer.

Rating: 4
FABULOUS!!! We have made this many times for dinner parties. It's surprisingly easy and our guests are always very impressed. Our only change to the original recipe is to double the amount of the cheese/mushroom mixture. We serve it with a red wine reduction spread underneath it on the plate.

I liked the idea of this recipe a lot. I substituted feta to create the tang. A word to the wise, this recipe for beef is rare! For those of us who like medium cooked meat, i would suggest adding time to the roasting portion. I wasn't sure how to make the demiglace, so I used beef consumme, merlot and made a roux to develop the gravy. I paired this with balsalmic glazed carrots and three cheese scalloped potatoes- a great meal combination!

Despite being a reasonably accomplished home-cook, my relative inexperience with puff-pastry kept me from making this dish until last weekend. And boy, did it show. I roasted my medium sized filets 12 minutes and immediately popped them in the fridge. They turned out perfectly after the recommened cooking time. I also added extra cheese and shrooms with excellent results. My problem was with the pastry. My Wellingtons came out of the oven bigger than softballs. The dough on the bottom was thick and soggy. Next time I would cut away all the excess after folding the pastry. And finally, I saw no nice way of presenting the sauce without making things even soggier. In fact, I saw no purpose for the sauce at all if the meat is cooked to a proper juiciness. Have to admit though, it's hard not to like a recipe that can be 100% done the day before and simply baked for a few minutes before serving.

I made this dish for visiting out of town relatives--and it was a huge hit!!! Most people associate Beef Wellington with liver pate, which my family does not care for--so the substitutes of mushrooms, shallots and gorgonzola were unbelievably fabulous. It was extensive to put together, but worth every bit of prep and more. Our relatives spread word all over the family about how impressive this dinner was, and now I am beginning to gain an even better reputation as a great cook.

This was fantastic! It was my first time using puff pastry and the dish turned out beautiful. I doubled the amount of cheese and mushrooms. I used the other readers' suggestions and only seared the meat for 6 minutes, but I found at the end the meat was still too raw. I just baked it in the oven for 7 minutes longer and they came out perfctly medium rare. Next time I will follow the cooking times given in the recipe. Definitly a keeper!

I made this for our anniversary last night and it turned out great! I pre-roasted 2-5oz filets for 9 minutes and they were between rare and med. rare at the finish. My husband is not a huge blue cheese fan so I put very little in his and he never even knew it was in there and he raved about the meal! This was fun to prepare and a little nerve racking the first time, but I will definately cook this again!! I used a blend of portabello, shitake and buttons for the mushroom mix, but I could use more help with the sauce. I just served it in a bowl and it wasn't very thick, even though I added a bit of cream. I also served a french onion soup that I love to make from a Classic Recipe collection from Cooking Light!

Excellent recipe! I did this one for New Year's Eve and was told by several guests that it was the best entree they had ever had, (including restaurants!)

I liked this recipe a lot because it came together very easily, and following the recipe turned out a perfectly-cooked medium-rare beef.

Absolutely delicious and simplicity itself. I made this last year as the centerpiece of a romantic Christmas Eve dinner for two for my husband and me. We both loved it, and the dish is now a tradition. This year my husband put extra demiglace from the gourmet shop in my stocking so that I would make it again for Valentine's Day. I don't roast the filets but simply sear them in a red-hot cast iron pan before chilling, and I use extra gorgonzola and mushrooms. It takes me a whole sheet of pastry to wrap two filets and make cut-outs of Christmas trees and stars. I served this with "brioche" potatoes from an old Gourmet magazine-- potatoes mashed with butter and egg yolk, rolled in flour, shaped like a brioche, washed with egg, and baked in mini brioche pans at 425-- same temp as the Wellington, about 15 minutes longer. And Julia Child's zucchini gratin. We started with a salad of romaine with dried cranberries, crumbled Montrachet, and raspberry balsamic vinaigrette. Warm cappuccino pudding cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. The Beef Wellington, the sauce, and the potatoes can all be done ahead, so this great dish allows me to sit around sipping wine and listening to the Messiah on Christmas Eve instead of racing around like a Chicken with my head cut off. Forget turkey!

My boyfriend made this recipe for us for Christmas Day dinner this year and it was a symphony in our mouths!

I always assumed I couldn't make beef wellington but after reading the reviews to this recipe, I determined that I could! Like many other cooks, I recommend greatly increasing the amount of bleu cheese used, increasing the garlic and shallots and would even consider adding a dash of marsala to the mushroom mixture for more flavor. Following the directions as written, I found the overall flavor bland but I will try again increasing and altering the seasoning and amounts used. Also, be sure to oil the baking pan or it will stick.

Even pre-roasting the filets didn't keep them from coming out bloody. The gorgonzola melted into the mushroom mixture to make a yucky goo in the pastry shells. My fault, probably, but I still feel it's probably better to follow the New Joy of Cooking's recipe, which uses pate and duxelles and omits the preroasting step.

Absolutely delectable!! I served this and my guests felt as if they were eating at a 5 Star restaurant! I took the other reviewers' advice and made more of the mushroom mixture. Great suggestion. Next time, I might add just a bit more cheese. It disappeared in the mushrooms and the flavor was not as pronounced as I thought it would be.

Sept/2000. We made this recipe to try it ourselves (prior to serving it for company). The GREAT thing is that you can prepare everything the day ahead and just have 20 min of cooking when the guests arrive. NOTE: If you use only 4-5 oz of meat per square of pastry, it works well-- and is enough for one helping. It looks beautiful on the plate, surrounded by vegetables!! We are looking forward to serving it to guests.

Sauce was a half bottle of cabernet with 10 whole shallots and 8 garlic cloves and reduced for almost 2 hrs., some butter, then added to sauteed wild mushrooms, finished with a touch of cream. Perfect.

This recipe was a big hit with my husband, who compared it to the filet encroute he loves at a very fine restaurant we go to. I will add a bit more gorgonzola for added flavor next time or may experiment with with another cheese such as smoked gouda.

What a wonderful recipe which was surprisingly easy to prepare . I added extra gorgonzola and mushrooms with great results. I will definitely make this again.

O.K.- I had the my husbands boss over for dinner last night and took everyone's advice to make this. He didn't leave ANYTHING on his plate. Would highly recommend serving it with the glazed pearl onions recipe - a perfect match for the beef. I took the previous reviewers advice and only pre cooked for 7 minutes. I thought the meat was REALLY rare. I would stick closer to what the recipe calls for next time. I also needed a larger square of pastry to completely encase the filling. To send it over the top - I used a minature cookie cutter on the extra pastry and put the it on top of the package. Great presentation.

This was a delicious and elegant dinner that didn't require too much preparation. I served this to my most snobbish friends and blew them away! Don't save it for your most boring dinner parties though. Enjoy it yourself on a TV tray with the remote. It could be even better!

In the process of assembling this, I discovered that I had no gorgonzola left. Instead used half saga blue, mixed with half cream cheese, as my husband isn't fond of "strong" blue cheese flavor, it was still very good in spite of this substitution.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday dinner and it was perfect for a special occasion. I served it with a rich cognac sauce from another bon appetit recipe and warm green bean salad with pine nuts and basil. I brought leftovers to work the next day to share with my coworkers. Although I reheated it in foil in a toaster oven, it was still delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added more cheese and mushroom mixture.

I've made this dinner 5 times, a winner without exception. As passed reviews have warned, however, if you want the finished product medium rare, do not exceed 5-6 min. for the initial roasting. Then the 20 min. was perfect for the final roasting. I've used phyllo dough, works great. Also, don't be afraid to add some pate to the mushrooms and gorganzola mixture for a more traditional taste, it's awesome, and I and others who have eaten this are not liver lovers. Among other things I've served this with parsnips cooked in an orange and curry sauce & flambeed with apricot brandy, and with pear quarters fried with salt pepper cinnamon sugar and grand marnier.

Thank goodness you still have this recipe in your archives! I want to make it again for a special company dinner, and almost panicked when I couldn't find my copy anywhere. I was afraid it might be out of date. This recipe is wonderful in so many ways - prepare ahead, relatively easy to fix, looks impressive, men love it (women too), and oh yes, DELICIOUS! Please keep it in your files in case I get absentminded again in the future.

YUM! Loved it! It was so delicious and cooked to perfection. I added a little extra gorgonzola and mushroom mixture to each wellington, and I didn't have any beef demiglace (but really ... who does?) so instead, I just made a brown gravy and added a bit of wine to it to make a simple sauce. You really don't need much sauce - just a small amount around the beef wellingtons, so I don't think it made much difference. I served them with a mixture roasted asparagus, whole baby mushrooms and julienned carrots which I simply roasted at the same time as the wellingtons ... It was so easy! I will definetely make these again.

Depending on the size of your filets, the dough size may need to be larger than 6.5" square. I needed 8" square to cover the filets. My husband loved this dish. This would be easy for a dinner party - prepare the filets the day before. Then just pop in the oven for 20 minutes & create your sauce.

Wonderful recipe! Excellent for dinner parties as it's prepared mostly ahead of time. I didn't add the demiglace, but added extra gorgonzola and mushrooms - Delicious! (Try the Baked Penne Pasta with Mushroom Ragout and a steamed veggie on the side.) This is the entree to make if you want to impress someone (Boss, a Date etc.)!!

A savory and wonderful looking dish! Watch to not overcook the beef in the pan the first time. A bit more cheese + mushrooms tasted delicious. Served with 2x's baked potato and a bold Cabernet - yummy!

This was Christmas Dinner on two ocassions for a total of 13 people. The recipe requires time. However, it well worth it!! It was simply incredible. So much so that I'm preparing it again.

This is the easiest, most impressive main dish I have prepared in a long time. Excellent for entertaining because it can all be done ahead of time. I have made this dish many times for family and friends. If I cannot get demi - glace, I use a cognac sauce recipe I have. I also use more mushrooms and more gorgonzola than called for. Even a beginner cannot go wrong with this dish.

This was delicious and very easy once I got over my fear of working with puff pastry. The recipe says to roll out pastry which I did not understand since it was already rolled out. But, once I started rolling, it was very easy to enlarge the pastry size...........just make sure your rolling pin and surface are lightly floured. Our friends raved and want to continue coming to our test kitchen. I fixed twice baked potatos,a mixed green salad with mandarin oranges and homemade rolls.

Wonderful, but a heavy and rich entree. Side dishes should be chosen carefully. Gorgonzola taste was not as strong as I would have liked, so I would use more next time. Agree that 12 min. for the first roasting is too long.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. 12 minute pre-cook of the steaks is way too long for med-rare - no more than 5-6 min. Have substituted pate for gorgonzola on occasion with good results. XLNT for dinner party, as can prepare ahead.

Excellent and easy. I am not a very accomplished chef, but this was easy and impressive. Made it for New Year's Eve dinner party and got rave reviews from my guests!

I made this for a black-tie millennium dinner party for 10 in rural middle America. Local availability dictated substitutions: finely chopped sweet onion for shallots, prepared cheese with herbs (Boursin or Alouette)for the gorgonzola--different taste, but worked well, and packaged McCormick's brown gravy with Madeira added, for sauce. The gravy was lighter than a demiglace and given the hour and other menu items, seemed better suited even if I could have found the called for item. I also made mine a bit smaller since the pastry, cheese and mushroom saute are all rich. Everyone ate every bit so there was no waste to a very expensive cut of meat. It is time consuming, but all preparation is in advance and looks more difficult (hence impressive) than is the fact. I would definitely make it again but still probably for a large group because I had to buy a full 4 lb. tenderloin to get the right quality and cut of meat.

Excellent. I prepared this for Christmas dinner. I used a mixture of white and cremini mushrooms and served it with a port-cream sauce (ruby port and cream reduced, beef stock, shallots)--very delicious. Will definitely add to my repertoire.

We made this for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it. For a slight twist, we grilled the fillets in the first cooking; and I used portabella mushrooms. We might try a little more gorgonzola next time. I found that the puff pastry shells could be rolled out and worked better than the sheets.

This recipe is awesome. I've made it for several dinner parties and received rave reviews every time.

I served this dish to some friends and was able to accomodate a vegetarian friend by substituting the beef with 8 large mushroom caps that I had sauteed with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. I baked it along with the other wellingtons for the same amount of time and it came out superb.

This was great. It was easy to prepare (especially if you buy the prepared phyllo dough). I had my boss and his wife over for supper and they liked it a lot. More importantly, my husband liked it (he's very picky)! You could probably get away without the sauce, however, it does add a nice extra dimension. I'm sure I'll make this again.

One of the best recipes I've ever tried. Will definitely add it to my "special dinner" category. Easy to make and well worth the money and time to prepare. Not only does it taste fantastic, it looks elegant when served. So, light the candles, pour the wine and ENJOY!

I have made this recipe twice, each time was a success. For the sauce, I sauted shallots in butter, some port wine, and then added a beef demiglace. It was very tasty. Also after I wrapped the filet mignon in the puff pastry, I used miniture cookie cutters and get out decorative leaves and acorns out of the puff pastry scraps to decorate the puff pastry wrap, I egg washed the whole thing. It came out great!

My husband said it was the best meal he has ever had. It was not near as difficult to make as I thought it would be. I would not change anything.

This is great for a dinner party because it can be made ahead. Don't cook the meat for too long in the first step in the recipe (ten minutes tops). I did so the first time and the final product came out overcooked. This is a very elegant and delicious meal; sure to impress guests.

I made it for Valentine's Day and I thought it tasted good. However, the sauce didn't quite taste the way I thought it should. I used a beef demiglace that I picked up from a specialty grocery store, and mixed it with Madeira. I thought the sauce tasted good with the Beef Wellington, but didn't taste so good on its own. I'm not sure I would use that sauce next time. Otherwise, it is an excellent dish.

I made this for a dinner party for 8! It was all done hours ahead of time, which made it very easy for me! I was able to relax and enjoy my guests and serve a gourmet meal! Everyone raved and even requested "doggie bags" , as they adored it so much! Definately worth the time and effort for a truly superb meal!!

I made this for a dinner party I had for my mom's birthday. It was terrific. Everyone raved about how wonderful it was. And easy. Everything is assembled before you guests arrive -- just the way I like to entertain. Try it. You won't be sorry. P.S. left overs the next day were almost better!
