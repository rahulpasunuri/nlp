Thought I had ginger but didn't so added some fresh mint and left out the sugar. Transcendent!

Absolutely fantastic with small amount of fresh grated ginger in it. Everyone at the small dinner party was asking what I did to the fruit.

I thought grated fresh ginger might be a bit much... so I used candied ginger instead.. made an experimental batch using that, and honey instead of sugar.. no one else got to taste it, because I devoured it myself! YUM!!!! Going to add pineapple next time :)

Whoever suggested the ginger was brilliant. It completely made the dish. We were slurping the extra juices from our bowls!

Refreshing and delicious. The sweetened lime juice is an excellent compliment to the melon and mango. I have added blueberries and imagine you can add a multitude of other fruits to this simple yet sophisticated dessert.

This is sooo easy to make and perfect for summer. Great after a heavy meal. A real crowd pleaser. However, doesn't store long - best if used w/in 12 hours.

This is such a simple fruit salad, but one of the best for flavors. It's so much more than the sum of it's parts! A great summer dish.

This was so perfect for a summer barbeque with the fresh fruits available. I like the lime and watermelon combination and took the suggestion of the fresh grated ginger. Definitely give that a try. I also added blueberries for variety. Do over!

With many finicky dinner guests with diet requests and needs, I decided on the no fat nearly sugar free watermelon and lime dessert and what a hit! Everyone raved. This is definitely a keeper. The ginger was perfect with it. Next time I will add no sugar at all because the dish does not need it.

I didn't hesitate to add the ginger as suggested by another reviewer, and boy howdy, it was fabulous. I had to make extra copies of the recipe to give to guests. This was a quick, fresh and altogether delightful desert. Colorful and the lime and ginger made each bite an event.

I haven't tried this yet, but I find that adding a teaspoon or two of freshly grated ginger really adds a lot to recipes such as this one. Will submit my review later - both with and without the ginger.

I used this for mangos only, and was impressed with the lime zest and juice. I also used honey instead of sugar. Clean, refreshing and simple.
