This recipe is wonderful and practically impossible to mess up. Can be made days in advance and keeps well in the fridge. I often substitute the apricots for other fruits or berries and sometimes do a mix. The vanilla cream base works wonderfully with anything. The marsala wine can also be substituted to better suit your fruits or left out if you are serving children. A truly wonderful recipe that be used and changed again and again for any occasion!
