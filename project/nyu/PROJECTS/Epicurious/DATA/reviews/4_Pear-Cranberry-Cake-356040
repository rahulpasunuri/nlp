This one's always a hit. I use a bundt pan - the cake needs a little loosening around the edges and center, but always slides right out. The one adjustment I make is using half the glaze.

Great cake. I wanted to make it healthier, so used an entire bag of cranberries (~2.5 cups), mixed the AP with whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar, and used a mix of oil and applesauce. I increased the baking powder to 1.50 TB to compensate, and the cake was wonderful - very moist with all the fruit. Be sure to cool 30 minutes before turning it out, because all the fruit makes it more likely to break if not cooled enough.

Per other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the spices and added 1/2 tsp. of ginger, peeled & grated 3 fresh pears & drained well on paper towels, used 8 oz. pkg. of dried cranberries which I scissor-cut (obviously have too much time on my hands), simmer in a cup of sauterne & drained, plus drained again on paper towels. Maybe most important of all I made the cake a day before the event so it mellowed for 24+ hours. Glazed it the next day and served the rest of the glaze on the side. It was a big success. Guests had seconds plus took home additional slices.

This recipe made me register to Epicurious.com in order to submit a review. Wow! This is an excellent recipe. Made it exactly as written except for the cranberrys which I doubled. Also I couldn't find either fresh or frozen cranberrys so I used dried, which I moistened with a little brandy. Everyone loved the recipe and it was extremely easy to make. Made it in a bundt pan and came out beautiful. The glaze is to die for!!

Delicious cake that lives up to its description- the crumb is moist indeed, and quite tasty. I would personally double the spices as well as the amount of cranberries, but otherwise I would stick to the recipe for a lovely, fruity cake with a killer glaze.

love this bunt cake for the holidays. It's moist, fragrant, and tasty. The icing is a must, so don't skip it! I've made the recipe as listed and I've also substituted apples for the pears and it works just as well.

This cake is absolutely delicious. I just made it into small loaves (3"x5 3/4" x 2") to give as gifts. One batch makes 4-5 loaves. They are beautiful, and the cake is so moist and flavorful that the "bread" works just fine without any glaze. -- After reading the other reviews, I made adjustments from the beginning: 2 cups cranberries, double (+) the cinnamon, 1/2 the nutmeg, and add 1 t. ginger. I also measured very generously on the vanilla. -- I'll be making this (as a cake) for our family Christmas party. It is delicious and it looks beautiful and festive.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving this year. I always like to make a cake to have something different amongst all the pies. Well, this has been the most disappointing cake I've ever made for Thanksgiving. While it certainly did not taste bad, I thought it was quite bland and was nothing exceptional. Even though I increased the amount of spices slightly due to the reviews, I still felt it was a little bland. I also increased the amount of cranberries to 2 cups, and I am glad I did so. I probably won't make this cake again, too many better ones out there!!!

Can't imagine how anyone would find this cake too dry! I did find that there was way too much of the delicious glaze - am thinking that it might be better to lightly glaze the top and then serve the extra, warmed, over individual slices. I used rock hard pears because that was all I could find and I was impatient, and they softened up nicely during baking. I agree the chunks are a little big - I will cut them into about 1/2" dice next time. Also agree that it could use some more cranberries - they provide a nice tart balance to the sweetness of the pears and the actual cake. I'll try an extra half cup next time. Also, I have an intense dislike of nutmeg, so I left it out. All that said, this will be on my Thanksgiving table this year, and any left over will be great for breakfast the next day!

Yummy and super easy to make. I increased the cranberries to 2 cups. Nice moist cake. Spiced are quite muted though, would add some more cinnamon next time.

I was disappointed with this cake, given the raves. I followed the instructions exactly, and the cake came out too dry. The best thing I can say about it is that the blend of spices is excellent. My husband agreed that the cake was too dry, and he came up with a fix. He poured some Cointreau over his slice and popped it in the microwave to warm it up. That way, it was close to perfect.

Rating: 1
Given the abundant praise, this cake was surprisingly uninteresting. The spices were muted, and though the glaze on its own was very good, it did not particularly enhance the flavors in the cake. My guests and I did not feel the pears and cranberries were complementary in this pairing. Also, the fairly-large sized chunks of pear tended to fall out both when the cake was removed from the pan and as it was being sliced.

Rating: 4
Amazing cake recipe. I made it in a bundt pan. I didn't have any fresh cranberries so I used dry cranberries, but simmered them in lillet for about an hour to plump them up again. I poured the liquid off before I put the berries in the batter. Also, mine only took 50 minutes to bake and cooked perfectly. The glaze on this is super tasty and really makes this cake special. This is going in the rotation for sure!

I made this for an autumn dinner party. The glaze is fantastic. Per the advice of many reviewers, I used twice the amount of cranberries and I'm glad I did. The pear flavor was not very pronounced, but perhaps that's because I did not use Bosc pears as the directions state. The Boscs in the store were rock hard and I had to use whatever I could find soft. Anjou, perhaps.

Rating: 3
Very easy to make, and very tasty, but I didn't think it was spectacular (although some of my friends did). I did, however, cut 1/4c of the oil, and added some ginger and mace. I doubled the cranberries as suggested, but only used 1 large pear (which gave me 2c).

This was good and looked great. I would use more cranberry and less pear next time, though.

The foodie from Southfield who reviewed this a few days ago, made with orange zest, nuts, Grand Marnier etc, reports in...the bosc pears ripened and I made exactly as written. Let the glaze simmer about 20 minutes, poured over the cake and reapplied until all was used. What a fabulous cake, so different from the orange adaptation. Both excellent cakes...perfect for fall. Hard to choose which to make

Unexpected company and a bag of cranberries sent me scurrying to Epicurious for inspiration. Well, I did not have pears or cream, so...doubled the cranberries, added 1 cp chp walnuts, the zest of two navel oranges and 1 tbsp of Grand Marnier. Baked it in a 12 cp bundt pan, popped it out when like warm and brushed with 1/2 cp sugar dissolved in 1/2 cp orange juice. WOW!!! Just bought bosc pears and cream qand will try it as written when the pears are ripe, but I can'i imagine it being any better

I loved this recipe - used one cup whole wheat flour and one cup cake flour and the crumb was so tender. Also, I prefer the tart pop of whole cranberries, so just mixed a frozen bag into the batter along with some walnuts. This cake is wonderful!!

Yummy! Followed the recipe except for adding a second cup of cranberies (frozen, didn't bother to thaw). It doesn't "need" the glaze -- the cake is moist and flavorful on its own -- but the glaze is very tasty, so it's a nice addition. Will definitely make again.

Exceptional cake recipe. It will not disappoint!!

This is a delicious recipe. Making it in a tube pan allows the glaze to cover it nicely and drip down the sides. I added extra cranberries the second time I made it and was pleased with the results. Be sure to buy Bosc pears several days in advance (a week for me) to be sure the pears are ripe when you make it. This definitely adds to the flavor of the cake.

This cake is very easy to make and not only makes a beautiful presentation but also tastes great. It lasts several days at least, it is so very moist. You can also use apple instead of pear for all or part. I did not thaw my cranberries the second time I made it and the cake came out fine. It would probably be delicious even without the glaze.

This was fantastic for new years eve. Even though I only had 3 eggs on hand and cut back on oil by substituting some applesauce, it was delicious and beautiful! This is a very forgiving recipe. No need to peel pears, either.

Wow! What a great change from all the super heavy chocolate desserts. The pear & cranberry combo is so nice. Next time I will add a bit more cranberry. I also used half the glaze on the cake and passed the remaining half.

I just made this cake and it smells delicious! I hope it tastes good too. I put only 1 1/4 cup sugar but added 1 extra cup of fresh cranberries. Hmmm... hope it won't be too tart. I've made some sweet cranberry sauce to serve on the side, just in case. When combining the eggs, oil, vanilla and sugar, I beat it for more than 3 minutes on med. high. The cake didn't rise as high as in the picture. Perhaps I should have set my oven temp. a bit higher; altho I set it for 350 degrees, I don't think it really was heating at that temp. Any comments on the beating of the oil, eggs and vanilla? I'm a novice when it comes to oil cakes.

This is not a review, but rather an inquiry to those who have made the cake. Did you peel the pears? If no, was it ok? If yes, same question. Thanks. I want to make this for New Years Eve dinner party, so need the answer pretty quickly. Thanks.

Fantastic! Perfect dessert after a heavy holiday meal. Easy to make, pretty, flavorful, not too sweet, and the glaze is fabulous. I put about 1/2 the glaze on the cake, and served the rest separately so people could add more if they wanted. Rave reviews from adults and kids alike. I'll definitely add more cranberries next time, and I'll definitely be making it again. Really delicious.

This is the most fabulous holiday cake!! I used 3 very ripe bartlett pears, and grated them instead of sliced.

Good recipe. Without a doubt, it should call for at least 2 cups of cranberries. My glaze didn't thicken but I probably should have cooked it longer and I used soy cream instead of actual cream which could have changed the consistency. Great flavors though.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. It's a very easy recipe. I made the cake in a bundt pan the day before Thanksgiving, cooled it, and turned it out. Then I made the glaze on T-day. The glaze was awesome, yummy. I would probably add a couple of more cinnamon sticks next time. The cake itself is moist and redolent with holiday spices.

The cake was a really popular Thanksgiving'09 dessert and a terrific alternate choice to the pumpkin pie. I used an extra cup of cranberries and just one pear (peeled and diced); baked it in a BUNDT pan. After cooling, I popped it out and then carefully turned it bottom side up to display the cranberry patterns. I opted not to glaze it. I served it with vanilla ice cream!

I've brought this two places and it was a hit at both. There were a couple people who wanted to bathe in the glaze. I'm also making this for Thanksgiving.

Absolutely a 'keeper' recipe. I've made two so far and they've been moist with just enough spice. Letting the cake cool in the pan 30-45 minutes will prevent sticking. I also use the non-stick spray for baking - the type that has flour in it - and it works every time.

Absolutely a 'keeper' recipe. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out nice and moist, a perfect Fall cake. Really let it cool for at least 30-45 minutes and it won't stick to the pan. I made two and gave the 2nd cake to the neighbor kids for Hallowwen and told them the cranberries were 'blod clots' and draped worms on top. It was a hit.

This is a delicious, flavorful cake. I perhaps should have let it cool more, because parts of the top stuck to my bundt pan, but I was able to patch it back together, and when the glaze was on it, you couldn't tell.
