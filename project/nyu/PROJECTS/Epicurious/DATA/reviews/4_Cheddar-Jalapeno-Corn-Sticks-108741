Good. Not quite excellent but pretty good. I didn't have the right kind of pans so I just poured everything into a 9X9 pan and cut into squares. I served with pork ribs I had smoked for 4.5 hours. Everybody thought these were good, although I must admit I used more jalapenos than the recipe called for which kept most everyone from having seconds. oops. Next time--along with using not as many jalapenos, I'll add chopped red bell pepper to give it more of a southwestern look. Very easy to make--will most certainly do again.

I have made this recipe for several years now and never get tired of it! The pickled jalapeno's and extra sharp cheddar really make it and whether corn sticks or in a cast iron skillet, it is so good! The fact that there are no other flours is even better - just good ol' fine cornmeal.

I had leftover buttermilk, so I found this recipe to use it up. This makes a very light and fluffy cornbread with zip and zing. I added 1/4 c frozen roasted corn (Trader Joe's brand) for extra sweetness. I reduced buttermilk a smidge to compensate for the increased moisture from the corn. Next time I'll add 1/3 c corn. Like the other reviewers I used my cast-iron skillet, which worked great.

Mmmm So Tasty! I used a 9" pie plate. Maybe a whole half stick of butter wasn't necessary unless you use the fancy pan, but.. wait.. when is too much butter a problem?! Delish.

I don't have the special pan, so I just used my cast iron skillet and cut the results into sticks. These were gone in minutes. I had to slap my boyfriend's hand away so there would be some left for the guests. One thing...I forgot to add the cheese until I'd already poured the batter in the pan. I just sprinkled it on top. I actually think it might be better that way because you get the crunchy, chewy cheese.
