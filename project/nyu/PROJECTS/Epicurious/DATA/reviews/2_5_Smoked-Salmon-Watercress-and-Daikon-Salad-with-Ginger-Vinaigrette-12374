I did't even know this was an official recipe. I made a variation of this for New Years eve. It was almost exactly the same but I juilanned both daikon and kohlrabe for a crunchy mix. I dipped one side of the smoked salmon (I used the lox type) in toasted sesame seeds and added some mandarine orage slices to the mix. And then topped with a soy ginger vinagrette. It was delicious and a little more interesting that the basic recipe described here.

I'll admit that I'm a recipe's nightmare, but I've made this on several occasions, but with my own twist (mostly depending on what I have on hand). For the dressing, I used ground ginger, white wine vinegar, olive oil and a splash of sesame oil (no sugar). And instead of daikon, I used cucumber rounds. So, yes, I've basically made a new recipe, but I just wanted people to know there are options to play with...

This is really mediocre. As a cook living in Japan, this type of salad is everyday cooking and this one is especially mundane. I made the vinaigrette as the recipe called for, it was missing alot and I added just a tad of soy sauce and mirin. I also sprinkled some white sesame seeds and fresh daikon sprouts. It was just very ordinary in the Japanese standards but the guests ate it all up, which is always a good sign.
