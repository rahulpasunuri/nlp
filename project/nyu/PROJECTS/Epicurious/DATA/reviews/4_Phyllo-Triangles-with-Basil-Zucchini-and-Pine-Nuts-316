For others who made this and despaired over the fiddling of rolling the mixture into triangles, here is another approach that saved alot of time and had my family raving about this dish. I cut the phyllo pastry (I used a whole wheat phyllo, by the way) into several 8" squares and layered them in an 8" square baking dish - so easy! I used a small amount of grated cheese between some of the layers. My oldest teen- aged son, a vegetarian, liked this dish alot, but his younger brother, an avowed carnivore, adored it. Went together much faster than a lasagne and everyone loved it - a new staple at our house!

I liked making this recipe because it made a very pretty presentation. However, i thought the filling was better with something else. I used this recipe as well as potato stuffed triangles, and I thought the potato was a much more practical filling for the borekas. I liked the presentation but did not love the flavor. My boyfriend really liked it though.

This was good, it was my first time working with Phyllo dough and that was a little frustrating - but they ended up turning out great and eveybody really liked them. I would allow yourself time to play with the phyllo dough or try the pre-made cups that others suggested. It was delicious and I would definitely make them again.

GREAT RECIPE! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used an herb and sun-dried tomato feta and two layers of phyllo. I omitted the sesame seeds, and froze the assembled triangles before baking (don't thaw first!) I also made the triangles smaller, cutting the pyhllo into fourths. It was time consuming, but anyone who enjoys cooking wouldn't mind the assembling part. I will definitley be making these again!

These tasted good, and the presentation was wonderful. But they weren't great enough to justify all of the work. I would try something different next time.

since we don't measure ounces here, plus I'm not really talented for math calculations, neither do I have a cup measure, I have to eye whatever i'm cooking. "Your dough must be bad," was what was going through my head as I was happily folding my phyllo triangles, with no problem using only ONE layer. I think one layer was quite sufficient for my triangles. About halfway through I realized that I forgot to add an egg altogether. I dumped half of an egg in the zucchini mix (= just the yolk, since I'll be needing the white later anyway), and followed the rest of the instructions. (Regretfully I had to use dried basil, not fresh, because the market was already closed.) Everything else I kind of followed. This recipe is really a masterpiece. It leaves a large margin for error, because both types of phyllo triangle I created tasted excellent! We had dinner with them and a salad. Actually I liked the eggless ones MORE than the egg yolk ones. Then I ate them with earl grey tea for breakfast the next day. I still can't believe they survived that long. Normally, they wouldn't have survived for such a long time, but I had to wait until my boyfriend left, as I didn't want to seem like a pig in front of him. Delicious and light! mmm!

This was delicious, made by a participant in our dinner group. Phyllo cups made it easy, and they were inhaled by the group!

I, too, used pre-made phyllo shells. Cooked 8 minutes and saw them disappear!

Definately will be making again, however, will reduce the amount of onion or even eliminate altogether. I substituted walnuts for the pine nuts and liked the results. A nice change from tiropita/spanakopita!

Mmmm! I baked these in phylo cups ( MUCH easier.) I also only used about 2 T of butter. I made them as an appetizer on easter and everyone loved them!

I made these and received great reviews. Instead of zucchini, I sauteed fresh spinach with olive oil and garlic. There weren't any left at the end of the night.

I made this recipe this evening and it was so much better than i expected. This was my first time working with filo dough and it was easy and fun. I made the filling the night before, i followed the recipe exactly and it was YUMMY. I will make this again for sure.

We made this last night for the first time: AWESOME! However, instead of making it into triangles, since we weren't using the dish as an appetizer but as a "main course", we made it into two larger pies. It turned out really well, and I'm sure if you wanted you could make it into just one, like a spanakopita with a different filling (and yummy sesame seeds on top). Which is really what this is--we'll never stop making spanikopita but we were looking for a good alternative for variation's sake--and we found a GREAT alternative! Highly, highly recommended

I highly recommend making this recipe. These things are amazingly delicious and look impressive! I had one out of the oven, and they are very good warm. I used Athenos brand feta cheese that had basil and tomato in it, and two sheets of phyllo instead of one. I didn't put butter in between the two sheets, but brushed butter on the triangle when needed while I was wrapping it. This recipe took a long time but it was worth it, these triangles are to die for and there are a lot of them! Yum!

These were a huge hit at my Christmas Eve party. I used 2 sheets instead of 1 and had no problem working with the dough. These were gone in no time. Next time, I'll make a double batch.

Has anyone ever tried this recipe using phyllo cups? Any thoughts?

I made this for a get-together with some friends and they all loved it! I've made spanokopita for years, and this was a nice change. However, I've never used only one layer of phyllo. Perhaps I read the recipe wrong, but I tried wrapping with one layer and had a tough time. I stacked one on top of the first (with butter on each) and had a much easier time. My spanokopita recipe actually calls for three layers of phyllo, but two seemed to work as well. A great make-ahead appetizer, and just pop in the oven before your guests arrive!

The first few sheets of phyllo are always difficult and usually tear. I increased the ingredients, substituted goat cheese for feta, and added minced chicken. Dipping phyllo wraps in butter is common in Italy and very good.

Although this dish was tasty, wrapping each triangle individually was too labor-intensive for me to make it again without friends and family helping in the kitchen. Be sure to spread the filling across the entire area of the triangle, rather than leaving it in a clump, to reduce the dryness and the risk of burning the pastry. I'd like to try using the filling in a different recipe (perhaps with puff pastry?) to save time.

I've made this recipe for years and I've always received great compliments - it's delicious & it looks good too. As with most phyllo recipes, it's worth the work, but ONLY if you have the time! I've also frozen these before baking (make sure you place wax or parchment paper between layers). If frozen, don't thaw before baking - put it straight into the oven!

I've made these a few times and they've always received raves. They're very much like spanakopita (Greek spinach pies), but the zucchini, basil and sesame seeds are a nice variation on that theme. The recipe is great as is, but I've also substituted chevre (goat) cheese for feta and used whole wheat phyllo dough with excellent results.

To the reader who doesn't understand how to fold: bring the bottom right corner of the strip up and over to the left so that a triangle is formed, then fold the triangle straight up, then keep folding the triangle end over end until you get to the end of the strip. That is how a flag is folded, believe it or not, so that it looks like a triangle when it is folded.

This was great - a little time consuming, but worth the effort. Next time I'll use dough strips that are thinner and shorter - making smaller triangles.

This was a really tasty recipe- fairly simple to make and a big hit at the party where I served it. I cut the phyllo dough into 4 strips rather than 3 to make more manageable bite size pieces. Otherwise, the recipe is great as is.
