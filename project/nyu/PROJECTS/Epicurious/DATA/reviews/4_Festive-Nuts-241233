Delicious. Have made these the last two years for different holiday parties and host gifts and always asked for the recipe. Less sugar, more spices, amazing!

Less sugar, more spices = absolutely delicious! I couldn't stop eating it when we had left overs from our party and had to drop it off at my parents' house.

This was a boring, gooey mess. I'm throwing it out.

Way delicious. Just made 15 lbs of these for an event. Go heavy on the spices and add ginger and coriander. Addictive.

Everyone loves them. By popular demand, I'm making them for the holidays again this year.

Great taste, but definitely increase the cooking time by at least 10 minutes to dry out the nuts in the oven. Also, consider increasing spice quantities to give them more punch!
