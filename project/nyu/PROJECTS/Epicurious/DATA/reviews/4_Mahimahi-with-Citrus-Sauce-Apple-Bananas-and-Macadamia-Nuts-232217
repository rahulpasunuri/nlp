Loved this recipe, and will add it to my "Best macadamia Nut Recipes" blog over at Squidoo! I Used fresh Hawaii macadamia nuts for this recipe. I get mine from www.maunakeagold.com. In my opinion, Hawaii produces the best Mac Nuts!

Oops, meant to say shichimi. Also, I couldn't find passion fruit syrup, so I used guava-passionfruit juice, hence the extra honey.

I made this for my husband when we were vacationing in Hawaii. We used fresh caught Mahi Mahi. I'm not a big fan of citrus, so I added all the zest (plus some) but substituted extra passionfruit juice for the lemon juice. I also added an extra tablespoon of honey. I used finger bananas sliced lengthwise, but had to add extra canola oil. Instead of shirischi, I used Chinese 5-spice blend, which was delicious. We had scratch mai tais & passionfruit cake for dessert -- wonderful!

This recipe is definitely a keeper and special-dinner-guest-worthy! I get the passion fruit syrup from any local coffee shop. They sell me what I need for 75 cents an ounce. Note: This recipe takes me about 1.5 hours from start to finish.

Delicious! I made the recipe the way it was written. I'm not sure what apple bananas are but I used Finger Bananas that I found from Asia World Market in Plano, Texas. I also found the 'shichimi' and the passion fruit syrup there. NOTE: Passion Fruit syrup was labeled Passion Fruit Juice. The juice is thick as syrup. Also, the large navel orange I used to get the zest was not wasted. I supremed the orange segments and used them as garnish around the greens.

My husband gave me one of those unsure looks when I served this to him but raved about it. "bookmark this one" he said. So this may become one of our dishes that we have a lot. It is definitely one that I would serve to guests. I had to sub some ingredients but it came out wonderful still.

Although this was mighty tasty, I had to deduct a fork because of the use of obscure/hard to find ingredients. Although the passion fruit syrup can be replaced with more oj concentrate, there was no explanation about apple bananas. I did order passion fruit syrup on line and just used baby bananas and as mentioned, results were very good.

This is fabulous! seriously! the best recipe I have made in the last year. I made this for valentine's day and it was completely amazing. My fiance has requested this for his birthday dinner. The flavors blend well together. its extremely yummy and different. A little bit of effort, but a lot worth it. i didn't have shichimi or passion fruit syrup, don't let that stop you from trying this.

Great Recipe!!! Some things you need to know... 1. Mahi Mahi is not a common fish that you can find anywhere. I used fresh Halibut from a local fish market that tasted great. 2. Could not find passion fruit syrup or juice at my local grocery store. Used extra OJ and a little cranberry juice. Be prepared for a strong citrus flavor if going this route. Still very good though. Will make again once I find the passion fruit syrup. 3. Schishimi is also not available at your local grocer, maybe at an Asian food store. I did not use because I could not find, bananas and coconut were still good though. 4. I did not use Mesculin or any other lettuce to place this fish on. Needless to say, this dish turned out great and my family enjoyed; even our 2 1/2 year old son liked the fish. (Beware though it has a bite from the peppercorns, so not every kid will like it). Enjoy!!!

This is a great and tasty recipe!!! There are a couple fo things you must know though. 1. Mahi Mahi is not a common fish that you can find just anywhere. I used fresh halibut, which tasted great. If you have a meat and fish market nearby, go there! 2. I could not find Passion Fruit Syrup or Juice at my local grocery store. I did you extra OJ consentrate and a little cranberry juice I had in the fridge. The sauce was great, but was strong in citrus. I will make it again once I find the passion fruit syrup. 3. I could not find shichimi at the store either. So good luck finding that one. Maybe at an Asian foods store? Bananas were still good without it. 4. We did not use the Musculin mix either and it was find. Either way this recipe was a huge success and look forward to making it again. Enjoy!!!

I will invite friends over or sneak the recipe to a hotel chef and have him put it on his menu! It is delicious and the flavor just blends nicely with the fish. Aloha to all who tries this dish!
