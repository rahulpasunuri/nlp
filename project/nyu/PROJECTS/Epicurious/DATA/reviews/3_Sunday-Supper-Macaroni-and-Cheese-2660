This is a great comfort food recipe and made a huge pot, so I'll be eating leftovers for quite some time. I love the beet greens (I just roasted the beets. Yum!), but beware, the stems will turn the noodles pink! I had a good laugh about it and renamed the recipe "Pink Noodles". For those of you who like your food normal colors, I would substitute spinach. I added a bit more cheese than the recipe called for, and will be adding more garlic next time too. Great suggestion! Easy, filling, nutritious, and great for reheating if you take your lunch to work!

This is a good and tasty, quick and easy, one-dish meal. No, this is not gourmet fare, but it is a jazzed-up version of good ol' mac'n'cheese that never fails to please. Unless my beet tops are very fresh, I sub with spinach, reduce the corn to 1 cup and add halved grape or cherry tomatoes, and always add a couple of garlic cloves as well as a few dashes of cayenne. Have also used chopped cooked bacon instead of ham - very flavourful but ups the fat content considerably. I also like a breadcrumb topping mixed with grated parmesan for a bit of crunch. This is comfort food that evokes childhood memories of home. Don't we all need a little of that every now and again to satisfy our inner child?! Enjoy!

To the articulate cook from Suffolk, VA. I also did not care for this dish, but please spare the rest of us to gorey details of the fate of your dining adventure. Why someone would attempt to feed something with beet greens, corn, whipping cream and ham to children boggles my mind. My kids did not eat combination pizza until they were 15 because they did not like the "icky stuff" eg: anything other than cheese. Please honey, just stick with packaged macaroni and cheese. A sure hit for the kids, and much less frustration for you in the kitchen. So, echoing another reviewer, why do you continue to visit this website?

Every time I make this dish, everyone loves it! This is a more a pasta dish rather than a mac and cheese variation. Definately substitute spinach for the beet leaves. I was shocked to see that this recipe received low fork ratings!

Do not make the mistake of replying to this one or the one from Boston. They are no doubt pimply 15-year olds who've been banned from every other forum on the net for being obtrusive, abusive and generally obnoxious. Let them go on eating their cheesy-poofs and drinking coke and if we don't have any response they'll get tired of no one caring and go away to sulk at McDonald's.

To the reviewer from Suffolk....after reading a couple of your "strong" reviews, it begs the question, Why do you visit this site? Are there ANY recipes you like?

Probably won't make again even though it is very easy and does not require baking. I made it "as is" except for switching corn with peas and ham with smoked turkey. The beet stuff just doesn't work well... spinach would be much better. Overall, just too bland and boring. Doesn't taste rich and creamy which does not satisfy that "mac & cheese" craving.

Excellent variation of mac and cheese . Have been making it for years with spinach, garlic, a sprinkle of parmesan and assorted pasta shapes. We like tiny shells the best. Whole family of five loves it. Fast and easy one -dish meal .

I found this to be a great recipe. I modified it by omitting the corn and ham. I followed the tips submitted above and added minced garlic to the onions and it turned out well. I also topped it with bread crumbs (tossed with butter) and baked at 375 for 15 minutes. Next time, I might want to replace the beet greens with spinach and add chunks of chicken.

This is one of the best macaroni and cheese dishes I have ever made. I substituted spinach for the beet greens, sauteed some garlic in with the onions, and added some blue cheese for some spunk. It was wonderful and pleasing to both kids and adults!

I like this recipe a lot. I sauteed 1 clove of garlic with the vegetables. The garlic adds so much flavor to this recipe, especially when you're reheating leftovers.
