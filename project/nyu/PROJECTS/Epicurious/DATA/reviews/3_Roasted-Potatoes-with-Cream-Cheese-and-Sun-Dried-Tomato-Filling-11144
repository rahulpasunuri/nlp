This was just bad and everyone thought so. I like/love all the ingredients separately but together they made a bland not very appealing appetizer. Next time I want cream cheese and sun-dried tomato I will stick with store bought Cibo (which has a much better flavor). This is the only recipe I have tried from this web site that was not wonderful.

This was AWESOME! I loved it - and so did all of my guests. I served it more like a cracker and spread - left the toasted potatoes plain - and served with the cream cheese as a topping. YUM YUM!

This recipe was great. The tangy tomatoes were complimented by the cream cheese. The appetizers were gone in minutes. I think I will use a misto instead of brushing the olive oil on the potatoes the next time I make this recipe.

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit. I roasted the potatoes and prepared the filling the night before the event. Pre-party, I slightly warmed the potatoes before spreading the filling. The flavours worked very well together. The filling would also be great on bread rounds or as a vegetable filling.

I served these at a cocktail party and they were the only things not eaten. I normally love anything with sun-dried tomatoes, but this appetizer was just bad.
