This was the first time we made this cake, we made it for our annual senior dinner at our church. It was GREAT !!! The icing is something I will use on other desserts for sure. We will make this for our own family Thanksgiving Dinner !!! A +++

This Was very good. Although, doing it in layers did not seem so good. instead, we made it a non-layer cake.

I agree that this was WAY too sweet. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar as suggested. Otherwise the flavors were great, and the cake was moist without being heavy.

I made this cake a few years ago and remember finding it a little on the dry side. I decided since then, my skills had improved somewhat and I wanted to try it again. I was a little wary at first because of a lot of other reviews talked about cutting back on the sugar or finding the cake + frosting too sweet or the cake too dense. My cake produced an unexpectedly light crumb and wasn't too sweet at all. Ditto the frosting. I wouldn't change a thing. I did up a allspice a little but I don't think the cake really needed it. I wouldn't change anything in this cake and will definitely make it again.

I loved this cake, but I made some changes to the recipe. I used apple sauce instead of sour cream and ground cloves instead of allspice. I also used about 3/4 a cup of sugar rather than 1 and 1/4 cup. I don't like frosting so I left that off completely. The resault was a fabulous cake that was quite healthy as far as cakes go.

Very tasty pumpkin cake! The cake itself is nice and has a good balance of sweetness and spices. However, the frosting is what really steals the show. It is fabulous! Worth making for the frosting alone; I added a bit more pumpkin in the frosting to up the flavor and it worked well. Enjoy!

This is a delicious cake that's pretty easy to make for something layered, frosted and lovely looking (beware...reminded me of a Sara Lee cake when sliced...for better or for worse). My only change: I agree with others that the ingredients make for a VERY sweet frosting. I wanted to keep the honey flavor, so instead of leaving that out I used only about 1/2 cup icing sugar, which seemed perfect to me. Also, I used buckwheat honey for both cake and frosting to maximize the honey flavor. I served it to a dinner party of 9, not all cake lovers, and everyone raved and polished off their slices.

The cake came out very light especially for a homemade cake. The cream cheese icing was amazing. My father raved about this cake, definetly worth the effort

I was lazy and decided to make no layers and use a normal springform pan. The result was a little dense but still delicious, not at all cloying like I feared. Since there were no layers I had a lot of frosting left; 2 days later I added 3 eggs and made a cheesecake with the crust in the "Pumpkin cheesecake with caramel swirl" (Bon Appetit, Nov 1993). Even more delish. Will definitely make the cake again and will take the time to do layers for a more sophisticated touch.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but to A Cook From Manchester, I think Frangelico would be great here.

I think this cake would also be nice laced with a little liqueur, any suggestions?????

Because of the warnings of previous cooks, I used 1/2 honey, 1/2 molasses. I skipped the icing,used powdered sugar sprinkled on top & served with whipped cream.I made it for my son-in-law, who doesnt like real sweet things. He really liked it. I would make it again without the icing

Excellent. No modifications were made to recipe. Everybody in a group of ten ate every crumb of 3/4 inch slices after a large dinner party. Wonderful for after dinner. I have made this three times now. It also freezes well.

Well, I don't own a jelly roll pan so I halved the recipe and it went into 2 loaf pans. The first came out perfectly. The second, well, it ended up half in/half out of the pan and in chunks on the floor. The two of us wolfed down the chunks with blobs of the frosting...very deliciuos. I didn't use the honey in the frosting, but it did need more sugar and a touch of vanilla to taste. I always add an extra shake of spices, and it turned out tasty if not beautifully.

Made this cake with my 3-year-old and had a blast. Darn fine cake, but a bit too dense for us, and needed some jazzing up in the spice department. Try adding another teaspoon of baking powder, and go heavier on the Allspice. Agree with other reviewers that this recipe (both cake and frosting) is more tasty if made less sweet. Using some molasses was a great idea.

I loved this cake, but I substituted molasses for the honey in both the cake and the frosting--not overly sweet and I think more interesting than the cake would have been with honey. The frosting was very soft, so possibly I didn't chill it long enough before putting the cake together...

So much better than pumpkin pie or pumpkin cheesecake! Really delicious. But I made the frosting with NO sugar. Two cups of sugar plus honey would make the frosting too sweat. The cake is sweat so the frosting should be mild. Instead I added a bit more honey, about 1/4 cup sour cream and about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. Wow! was it good. mmmmm....

Made this cake for the first time last Thanksgiving and about 4-5 times since. It's now my Mother's favourite ! Texture makes it more like a European type of cake. Very flavourful & rich. Used one large can of pumpkin (for both the cake & icing), so that's more than is called for, but gives it a more pumpkin-flavour. Tried making it in three round pans the second time, but preferred the recipe cookie tray type.

I was disappointed. The cake wasn't as fluffy as I thought it should be and was very sweet. It tasted more like a honey/spice cake. IF you like honey - a lot - then, try this cake. You would like it. If not, you'd do better trying another recipe.

This cake sounded great and actually looks very elegant, but I was a little disappointed with the taste. It is very heavy and very sweet. I love pumpkin desserts and have had many that were better.

After reading the reviews, I was actually a little disappointed with this cake. It was much heavier than I expected and I wasn't crazy about the frosting. However, everyone at the dinner party where it was served LOVED it, so I upgraded my rating to three forks from two. The cake does have a very nice taste.

Though a bit time-consuming, this cake was splendid! It was drop-dead gorgeous, and its flavor and texture lived up to its looks beautifully. It has a very delicate and moist crumb, a rich and creamy frosting, and the long rectangular shape is extremely elegant.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. It's resting in the fridge right now, but I had a taste of the trimmings and frosting. The texture is fantastic, and it has just the right amount of spice. Delicious! Better than I had expected.

Loved the cake...it came out moist and tasty all on it's own...but I found the frosting a little too sweet...next time I'd omit the honey and add more pumpkin...also adding crushed walnuts to one of the frosting layers would make for an interesting texture...this will definitely be on our Thanksgiving table for years to come!

YUMMY ! YUMMY ! Cake was very flavorful & moist. The only change I made was not adding the whipping cream to the frosting which made a very nice cream cheese frosting!

I made this cake for thanksgiving and it was delicious. Just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and sweetness. The presentation is beautiful and the cream cheese icing is just the right amount if tartness to balance all the flavors.
