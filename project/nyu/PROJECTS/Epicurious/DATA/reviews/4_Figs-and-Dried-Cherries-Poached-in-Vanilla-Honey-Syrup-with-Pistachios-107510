So wonderful. Especially with the greek style vanilla yogurt rather than plain. my whole family loved it and it will be my christmas desert with a little brandy added and set on fire.

I made this dessert using Californian figs and did not add any cherries. When it was ready I used the bamix and made it into a paste I served it over gluten free Greek yoghurt and added walnuts. I sold it at my shop and it walked out the door. This time I am going to make it without the sugar and see if there is a difference. It really is beautiful

Wow - this dessert was fantastic! I recently made it while camping, and not only impressed my neighbours with it's incredible deliciousness, but (leaving out the yogurt), it was celiac-friendly. The only comment was that the dessert was really sweet, and I agree that little or no sugar is required; next time, I'll only use the honey. I also used hazelnuts, rather than pistachios. Yum.

I am not sure that this is a dish beyond compare, but it certainly is fantastic. This dessert is even more wodnerful because it is so low-fat. I personally would add a little less sugar next time because frankly, it wouldn't make any difference. I am going to make this again today for Easter...
