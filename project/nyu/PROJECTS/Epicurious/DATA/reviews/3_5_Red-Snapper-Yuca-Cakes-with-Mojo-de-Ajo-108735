I made this with leftover yuca prepared in a similar way to the directions but with added onions and garlic. Very tasty cakes and excellent when served with black beans.

good sause, although I added more cilantro and habanero peppers. Also to get the cakes to stick together~coat lightly with panko(japenese)bread crumbs. They get nice and crispy. serve with sweet rum and brown sugar sauted plantains. ( or mashed plantains)

It was quite tasty and everyone greatly enjoyed it both with and without the zippy mojo. I did have some problems getting the cakes to stay formed, as they mostly crumbled while cooking. I did use fresh yucca, which was rather difficult to "whittle"; and perhaps let to the formation problem as well.
