A great, easy recipe. I made it into a plain cornbread for my son: subbed equal amounts of plain yogurt and brown sugar for buttermilk and sugar respectively. Omitted the onions, jalepeno. Still perfect and delicious. I'm sure even better with the onions and jalepeno!

It was good enough, though I'm not saving the recipe to make again.

Have made this many times with chili and it's always a hit. Not a dry cornbread like many other recipes. The only substitution is milk with 1 tsp vinegar as I never have buttermilk on hand.

This is the best cornbread I have ever made. The texture is perfect. I like that it is relatively thin (a bit of the tasty crust in every bite). The only changes I made were to include a whole chopped jalapeno (probably more than the recipe calls for) and some grated sharp cheddar (probably around 3/4 c) to the batter. I could also see making a plain version to serve with butter and honey. Outstanding.

I hate to be one of those people who messes with a recipe and then reviews it, but here I am doing it. I usually make simple standard corn bread off the Bob's Red Mill package, but my husband wanted jalapeno corn bread. I used this recipe as a basis but it sounded more like a thick pancake, so I reduced the milk to less than 1 cup. I would have used both eggs but one fell on the floor. My husband got Serrano chilies instead of jalapeno. I added some grated sharp cheddar to the batter and on top and baked it in a preheated 10 inch cast iron pan at 400 degrees for about 17 minutes. It was really good. I loved the green onions in it.

This is my second or third time making this and I don't think I'll ever use a different recipe.

By far my favorite cornbread recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving this year to serve with pumpkin velouté and it was devoured. I loved the light texture and the perfect balance between sweet and savory. I added a scant cup of corn as some other reviewers suggested and I also threw in a half-cup of grated pepperjack cheese to up the jalapeño flavor and add a little melt in. For the presentation, I cut the cornbread into triangles and served in a lovely rustic basket with a checkered napkin. Fantastic!

I loved this receipe (used it to make Thanksgiving Stuffing). My only recommendation is that it needs to be cooked at a higher temperature... The inside was soggy in the middle and I didn't want the bread to burn in top so I had to remove. I think 400 to 425 would be the perfect temperature!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and felt it was only an average recipe. It felt a little too greasy and only tasted good with honey-butter. I look for a corn bread to be able to stand alone at first and then be enhanced with butter/honey butter or whatever.

Best cornbread I've made. Added about a (scant) cup of corn niblets and baked in a 9x9 square- ready a bit early despite the smaller pan, circa 22 minutes. Really delicious.

I like this a lot. Used Skim milk mixed with vinegar....as I didn't have buttermilk on hand. Used white corn meal and baked it in the cast iron skillet. This was great corn bread. Also used the whole seeded jalepeno and added 2/3 C frozen corn as others recommended. It was really good - it didn't raise too much and the white cornmeal made it very light but boy was it good!

Light with good texture. Onion and jalapeno are subtle, so if you want to taste those flavors just add more. I served this with a black bean turkey chili (ala Williams Sonoma)and it was delicious. This one is a keeper.

This is one of the better cornbreads that I've made. I made it with white bean turkey chili and it went well. Used a whole jalepeno and the heat was not too much (for us but we like hot food). I would make this again. My husband definitely seems to like it.

This is the best cornbread I have ever made. Moist, tender, and interesting. Just the right amount of sweet and savory to my taste. I added corn and cheese and made muffins.

Very deferent than your same ol corn bread pared with a spicy chili it was perfect....loved the texture the peppers and onions add....next time I will had corn as others have.

moist, cake-like, fluffy, totally strange for cornbread. i usually use kefir so maybe it was using buttermilk that made it so light? amazing with green onions and home-pickled serranos from the garden. lots of substitutions: egg-replacer of potato and tapioca starches since we didn't have eggs. too sweet for some in the group, but perfect for me.

Love this! It's raining in So Cal. I had made a pot of ham hocks and beans which always requires corn bread. I used two huge jalapenos because we like a little heat, added some TJ's corn suggested by another reviewer and some cheese. I always have buttermilk around so that stayed in the recipe. However, I didn't have any green onions handy. I could have gone down to the garden and cannibalized some from the white onions I'm growing, but as I said, it was raining  and it was dark. The result was wonderful. I highly recommend upping the Jalapeno quotient (if you are so inclined). Others may not like the kick, but we sure did. It was a bit spongey, no doubt from the two eggs and extra moisture from the corn. It would make a great dressing for Thanksgiving turkey if it were a tad drier.We will do this again.

This is a great basic cornbread recipe. I made mine in a cast iron skillet and added grated sharp cheddar cheese, bottled jalepenos, and canned green chiles. I also added slightly more buttermilk than called for. Everyone at the table loved it!

Made this for my husband's birthday as he isn't a sweets person and doesn't like cake. Overall it tasted pretty good. Maybe I had some weak jalpenos, but this wasn't very spicy, even after I had added 4 teaspoons of minced jalapenos... But I will definitly be making this again since it does have an overall nice flavor and isn't dry. Also, it isn't hard to make at all! I think next time though, for aesthetic purposes I might just slice the jalapeno(s) and lay them out over top of the batter...(just a suggestion from the Hubby...)

This is a great base recipe. I did add in corn kernels as others suggested (frozen roasted corn from Trader Joes...about 3/4 cup). Think next time I will add a bit more jalapeno and not yet sure what -- but something to add a bit of "umph" to the flavor. Consistency is fabulous.

This was an easy, tasty recipe -- much moister than most cornbreads I've made. Like some other reviewers suggested, I added about 1/2 cup frozen corn and a bit of grated cheddar to the batter. Also, I substituted half yogurt/half milk for the buttermilk -- I don't usually keep buttermilk around, and I've found that the yogurt/milk combination makes a great alternative. I'd definitely make this recipe again.

Subbed the green onions with 1/4 cup banana peppers and 1/4 onion (and used canned jalapeno slices that I diced finely.) I also added the tablespoon of brown sugar. Absolutely EXQUISITE, stayed moist and the flavor was great, although I may just use 1 tsp of salt next time.

Excellent, added a tablespoon of brown sugar. Everyone loved it, will make it again, again, and again.

Fabulous. follow the recipe & it will be perfect. I added 1/2 cup of frozen white corn (trader joe's) and it really helped add a strong corn flavor & chunky texture. Moisture was just about perfect- not dry at all (as I've noticed with most other corn bread). Make this with the ding dong 8 alarm chili!

I doubled the recipe (for a party); Added 1 1/4 cans creamed corn, Left the 1/4 c butter the same as for a single recipe amount; Added just a tad more sugar; Added 2 handfuls of shredded cheddar......everyone raved about it!

I make this without the green-onions...but only because I forgot to put them in the first time and didn't miss it. I also add about a cup of cheddar cheese and make it in a cast iron skillet. Very tarty!

PERFECTION. It was very well received by guests and family. I've made it once with scallions, and once with chives, and I loved it both times. Will use this everytime I make chilli from now on...

I have now made this recipe for two Thanksgivings and one Christmas. It is definitely a staple! It is excellent alone or used in stuffing. I find that it does not dry out like some cornbreads tend to, and the jalapeno adds just the right amount of spice.

This is a delicious cornbread with just enough spice. However, I replaced the sugar with about 1/3 cup honey, added about 1/2 cup fresh uncooked corn, eliminated the green onion and seeds from the jalapeno pepper.

Rating: 4
My new cornbread recipe. Green onions add a nice texture and moisture. Made exactly as is, with just one tweak: used red bird chiles instead of jalapenos becuase we wanted lots of heat. I think this would also be nice with a handful of extra sharp cheddar stirred in.

Made this as an accompaniment to black bean soup (Epicurious 3186). I made 1 batch x2 as written and 1 batch x2 vegan-ized and whole grain. The regular one was FABULOUS. I will definately make this again. The vegan one I also enjoyed a lot and would make again. If you are unfamilar with making cornbread, you will want to make a packet verison first to understand the consistancy. Both versions I added a tiny bit (less than 2 oz) more butter/soy-milk to get the appropriate consistancy. Figuring out the consistancy was not an issue for me as I make cornbreads frequently. Also, I baked these in well-sprayed muffin tins to ensure even portions and consistant baking. Spun around twice during baking. The vegan version took about 5 to 10 minutes longer to bake and did not rise as high as the regular ones. My vegan-ized version: sub'ed out all AP for 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 8-grain mix; sub'ed out the buttermilk for soy milk; sub'ed out the weight of eggs and butter for same weight less 2T of canola oil added 2T of walnut oil.

I loved this recipe! Easy to make. I left it in until I liked the color - this browned a nice golden, and was very buttery-moist! I used more jalepenos then asked for, seeds and all- not too spicy. My eleven yr old son loved the taste. We toasted it the next day in the toaster oven. I did omit the green onions - not a big onion fan.

Very good, moist, and a little spicy. Made with porterhouse steaks, and two-tone coleslaw with yogurt dressing also from this site. Great meal!

I thought this recipe looked wonderful but was disappointed with the final product. I could not get my cornbread to brown on top. The flavor was good although I would add more jalapeno if I ever make it again. I doesn't make a good presentation being so "pale".

This tasted ok but it didn't rise. I have tried so many other fabulous cornbread recipes from this site. I see no reason to repeat this medeocre one. The secret must be doing it in a skillet instead of a pan as the recipe states.

This cornbread is slightly sweet, slightly spicey, and moist, absolutely delicious. I also made it in a skillet and used a whole jalapeno pepper, and added a dash of cayenne

Very delicious, though I put it in a 10" cast iron skillet because I like a thick cornbread. Yum. Served with braised greens and a butternut squash gratin.
