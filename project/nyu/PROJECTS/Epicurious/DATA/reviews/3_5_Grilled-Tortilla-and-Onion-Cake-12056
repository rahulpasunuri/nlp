I thought this were very good, but I wonder if they might be even better with some type of dipping sauce. I did not toast the tortillas prior to stacking them, and I grilled the slices in a frying pan. I cut them into bite size pieces (held with toothpicks) and served as hors d' oeuvres at a cocktail party. I liked that the combination of sweet and savory going on, but I think they could've used just a little something else, like a dipping sauce. Maybe something with a bit of spice to it. So, if you have any ideas, please post....

Excellent. A friend made this for me and my husband 11 years ago and I have been making it ever since.

I made this when the recipe was first in Gourmet in 1994, I forgot how great it is until I made it again. I won't wait so long this time. The mayo/vinegar mixture shouln't be left out!!!

This is an awesome side dish to accompany grilled meats. I've made it several times and guests have loved it. The tortillas tend to melt in with the onion mix and the end result is quite creamy and simply superb. Guests don't even realize it's made out of tortillas. I would always do this on the grill and agree with previous counsel to make extra onion mix. The existing recipe gives one barely enough onion mixture to complete a sufficient number of layers. Great with the grilled rib-eyes with bernaise butter.

Simple and tasty yet a little different for a BBQ and very appealing to the eye. I increased amount of onions to 4 cups to cover tortillas better.
