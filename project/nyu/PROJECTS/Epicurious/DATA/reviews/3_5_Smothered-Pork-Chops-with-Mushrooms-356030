This was excellent and easy. Used wine to deglaze then added balance of chicken broth (instead of water). Added garlic to the mushroom and onion mixture. Will make again. May even consider adding marsala wine next time.

Delicious and easy! Used portabellas, since thats what I had on hand and threw in a good chunk of minced garlic. Also went with chicken stock instead of water to add a little extra flavor.

Great recipe! We did add some wine to the pan before adding the meat back in, but besides that followed the recipe. Excellent and easy.

Good and easy. I did as others suggested and added some wine. Also threw in some lemon juice, extra rosemary, minced garlic, and black pepper. All in all, this was an easy, basic, and tasty way to serve chops.

I agree with many of the previous cooks that this is a fabulous recipe, IF you make a few changes. I agree whole-heartedly that you MUSTreplace the water with either all stock or half wine and half stock. I recommend using a wine-stock mixture and deglazing the pan with the wine first. I also removed the pork from the sauce at the end, reduced the sauce slightly, and then added a few tablespoons of cream to make a lovely sauce/gravey. Beware the coooking time -- our chops were done in about 12 minutes -- not the 30 recommended by the recipe. That said, we like our chops medium and gave them plenty of resting time. One more tip -- I was using the more expensive boneless loin chops. To make them as tender as possible, I brined them in a solution of 1 tablespoon salt to 1 cup water. I also added an equal amount of sugar to the brining liquid, plus several cloves or garlic, a handfull of peppercorns, a few bay leaves, and a sprig of rosemary. I brined them for about 5 hours in this mixture (four and a half inch chops took about 5cups water and 5 T salt/5 T sugar plus those other add ins.) I have to admit, the chops had been in my freezer for over 6 months and they came out as tender as if they were freshly bought. This is a great recipe with these mods.

Made this with some modifications and turned out fabulous! I deglazed the pan with white wine after browning the chops, added garlic (3cloves) when I put the rosemary in, and also used half chicken stock half whipping cream instead of water. I also grated a small amount of lemon zest on top of the dish once plated to cut the heaviness of my cream sauce. Served with a "dirty" garlic mash potato and some crispy green beans. Even baby liked it! I know it has deviated from the recipe a fair bit but it did improve the flavor profile as some people felt it was too simple. Personally I agree that the most simple can be the best but I love to morph the recipes into something of my own. Happy Cooking!

I tried this once & thought with some work it might be worth keeping. Second try was better but I still wasn't impressed so won't do it again. I didn't dredge the chops in flour as you're too likely to burn the flour when trying to brown the chops; otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe although I did use white wine rather than water. The recipe calls for too much liquid. I thickened the sauce a bit the 1st time but didn't bother the second time. Reducing the cooking time by 5 -10 minutes helped but smothered/braised still equals boiled meat and that's not my favorite.

I love this recipe and have now made it several times. Sadly, my husband really dislikes mushrooms, so I make it sans-mushrooms and it's still delicious. The pork chops always have great flavor, I love the rosemary, and the sauce cooks up nicely. We love gravy, and so I always pull the chops out towards the end, throw in some extra flour, and use either beef broth or water....I also love using wine to deglaze the pan. This is simple recipe with ingredients I always have, so that's an extra bonus! I like to serve it either mashed potatoes or over rice and some sort of vegetable or salad....delicious and easy. Another thing I like about this recipe is that it is an easy recipe to have fun with and change up. :)

To f*** with opusbvd from Marblehead, MA:this was delicious and SUPPOSED to be simple. Just because it requires so called "basic" ingridents and zero pretentiousness doesn't mean its bad. Using quality mushrooms is a big helper,as is fresh rosemary if your local store sells it fresh.Although I will say a lil red wine (even "cheap" red wine) into the liquid is a must if you are really trying to get home-cook fancy. You should try it cause it sounds tasty;not cause some a-hole said it was too-retro!

A 1950s flashback. I should copy Betty Crocker on this review. Thin tasting with little of the complexities that should come with mushrooms. I will say its easy, but I won't be cooking it (ever) again. I'd encourage you to pass on it too

This is wonderfully simplebut very tasty. I may try it with wine instead of water next but it is very good the way it is written. And we know good pork recipes here in Iowa.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now -- it is one of the few dishes that gets served year-round. It has made mushroom-lovers out of my kids, so we increase the quantity. Read the whole story at http://mommyporch.blogspot.com/2010/11/smothered-pork-chops-with-mushrooms-and.html

Man, this dish is so damn good. The pork gets really tender and the mushrooms and rosemary make an incredible flavor combo. I've used baby bellas and regular white mushrooms. I made a video of the dish for my blog: http://makeityourdamnself.wordpress.com (Smothered Pork Chops with Mushrooms)

I made this for the first time last night and was extremely pleased. I pretty much followed the recipe (which is unusual for me) with the exception of using both butter and oil, and adding a bit of extra liquid - I mixed water with some left over white wine. I wanted the gravy to be a little thicker, so I removed the chops from the pan once they were done, and reduced it to my desired consistency. I tossed them back in to heat through right before serving. This recipe is super simple, extremely inexpensive, and quite tasty. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of the mushroom gravy, and ran off with all of my leftovers for lunch the next day, instead of his usual sandwich. I garnished the pork chops with some fresh chives and served them with smashed red skinned potatoes and roasted broccoli. This recipe is definitely being added to my weeknight dinner repertoire.

The recipe is very good, and with the modifications I made, I think it was excellent. As several other cooks have recommended, I used some butter in place of some of the oil (1 tablespoon of butter at the stage when you sautee the onions and mushrooms). I also used a full cup of white wine rather than water. After simmering for almost 1/2 hour, I removed the lid, added a touch of cream, and boiled away much of the liquid until there was just a bit of brownness on the bottom of the pan to deglaze by stirring and scraping. Delicious, even though I didn't have fresh rosemary and had to use dried. I served the pork chop over sliced Yukon Gold potatoes with a side salad of butter lettuce, mozarella, basil, and heirloom tomatoes from the garden. It was a hit with my family!

Looking forward to trying this tomorrow tonight! Regarding the objections that "A Cook from Philadelphia" has to the name of the recipe: "Smothered" _is_ an adjective, not a verb; a word of this kind is called a "participle" -- that is, a modifier formed by using the -ed or -ing form of a verb. I agree that the name is awkward, but the problem here is syntax, not grammar. Since it is presumably the mushroom sauce that is doing the smothering, a better name for the dish would be "Pork Chops Smothered with (or in) Mushrooms." Hope mine turns out well!

I am not an experienced cook but this recipe turned out great for me. I did not use the flour as I am doing low carb but did add 1 tsp of ThicknThin )alow carb thickener) to the sauce to bring it together a little. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and replaced half the water with white wine and added enough chicken stock to completely cover my chops. They came out very tender and delicious.

Really easy, very satisfying and easily modified. Like others, I used wine instead of water (1/2 and 1/2). But, I also added other veges I had on hand... brussel sprouts with the mushrooms and then green peppers right at the end. Served over rice. Really good, I'll go to this again for a weeknight dinner.

This was a very tasty and very simple recipe. The timing for the steps for the pork chops are a little off, but that is forgivable. I also recommend using a little bit of butter along with the olive oil to give the chops a bit more flavor. My only criticism is that "Smothered" is a verb, not an adjective as it used in the title of the recipe. That's ok, no one said you needed to have good grammar to be a good cook.

I thought it was not bad at all, pretty basic but a good quick recipe. I made this with chicken stock, garlic, boneless pork chops (cut cooking time) and reg white mushrooms. I also used a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce more. I served it with yam/russet mashed potatoes...yum!

I'm a complete cooking novice (read: clueless) and I thought this recipe was a good learning experience. Partially because it tasted good, but mostly because it's slight misdirections provided the right learning opportunities. My amateur chef boyfriend helped me figure out where it could be improved: 1. Don't need to dredge in flour. Just make sure the oil is good and hot and make sure you get it brown enough. 2. Unless you have a big and deep enough pan, better off getting the boneless chops and cutting cooking time. They took up too much space and probably screwed up cooking time. 3. Recommend cutting the onions in circles and skip the halving. It looks nicer and easier to eat too. The rest of the mistakes were all mine. But I learned some seriously important basics and can't wait to try making this again.

This is more a response to the cook who advised adding a can of mushroom soup to the gravy... that sounds like a very bad idea that would wreck the gravy. Please don't do that, just in case there are inexperienced cooks reading this. Mushroom soup is only good as soup. Canned soup is not a substitute for sauce. Gravy is not hard to make!

Made this for a dinner party, and they were a hit! i adjusted the recipe slightly by deglazing the pan with some leftover port and using chicken broth instead of water. Also, getting the bone-in pork shoulder chop is key since the meat has more fat that boils down during the simmer and keeps the meat extra tender. I made garlic mashed potatoes as a side and used the mushroom sauce as gravy. FANTASTIC!

Absolutely Delicious!!! I made these last night and they were great: flavorful, and tender. Perfect for a winter day with mashed potatoes, and pretty quick for a braise. The one thing that seemed off about the recipe was the small amount of water called for. I used 1/2 cup of water mixed with 1/2 cup white wine, and 3/4 cup of chicken stock because one cup wasn't enough liquid to cover the chops. Otherwise it came out prefectly with a rich creamy gravy. It's important to remeber that the recipe calls for bone-in pork shoulder chops, a fatty and inexpesive cut. If you use a leaner and more expensive cut like tenderlion, you might end up with dry pork chops.

this meal was satisfying, easy, and tasted and smelled delicious. my hearty-meal-loving husband liked it and it wasn't too heavy for me. served it with a green salad and sweet potato. will remember this one to make again.

This recipe is good but it can be improved via two simple changes. First, substitute apple cider or white wine for the water. Second, stir in 1 can of mushroom soup before beginning the covered braise. You will end up with tender chops and a mushroom-pork gravy that goes well over cooked rice. Pair this recipe with a Gewurtztraminer or Riesling. Buon Appetito!

The entire time this was cooking it smelled wonderful and I was sure we had a keeper. It just didn't deliver--the chopes were tough, though I bought good ones, the sauce didn't thicken, the flavors weren't absorbed by the pork.

This was a very nice and well balanced recipe. I added some dill for extra flavor. My boyfriend loved it.
