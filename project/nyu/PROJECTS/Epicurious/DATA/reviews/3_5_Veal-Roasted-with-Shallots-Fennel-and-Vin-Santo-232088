I have made this several times and although pricey, it's definitley worth it for a special occasion. I cannot imagine doing it without the Vin Santo!

I made a half recipe for 2 adults/1 teen; wine guy sold me a domestic Sauterne instead of the Vin Santo ($5 instead of $25). The meat was very tasty but the fennel/shallot mixture was way too much and lasted long after the meat was gone.

My family raved about this dish. I followed the recipe as written.

Invest in the Vin Santo - but not the sipping/dippping kind (like for biscotti). There are usually two prices for Van Santo ($15 - $20 range or $40 + a bottle). Use the $15 bottle - and use it with chicken also. A WONDEFUL change from the ordinary white wine.

I was interested in this recipe until I read the reviews. "Myson" received all of the reviews. Please ignore any reviews that aren't reviews for the recipe, which is what I assume is the purpose of the "review." Frustrated in Montgomery County, PA.

Pricey but doable, I used Riesling instead of the 45.00 dollar bottle of Vin Santo asked for in recipe. I was sold on the braising technique it was tender and moist really low calorie also.

This recipe was delicious. I will definately make it again. Couldn't find Vin Santo so I substituted with Marsala. Otherwise, followed the recipe right down to serving it with a side of sauteed spinach. Yummy and easy!

Rated 3 forks for the good laugh I had reading the reviews... I'll probably make it later and let you know. Really though, I do see a lot of pigs locally driving down the highway to a nearby slaughterhouse and feel a little bad that they look so happy in their ignorance, but I do soooo love prosciutto and bacon ... we're all born with a purpose!

I was quite disappointed in this dish. For one thing it is quite an expensive main dish (it cost me around $20) and dispite all the onion, fennel and wine the meat turned out rather bland and tough (I had "veal shoulder") - and what taste was there I did not care for at all.

The rude comments on these recipes makes coming to epicurious.com depressing. What happened to politeness?

Whew! After reading all 19 of the responses generated by "mysonvaughn", I conducted a general search of all recipes under "veal". Not surprisingly, of the 211 that resulted, he had submitted the exact same response to at least ten of them, and he probably only stopped there because a subsequent reviewer claimed that she reported him to epicurious.com. Let us hope that it worked.

Reading the comments is as good as making the dish. This is a riot. I will make this dish and hope I don't remember its mother. Does this jerk realize cows are in this world because farmers need their by-products? They would otherwise be in another field of endeavor (the breeders, that is). Let it go, guy and try another forum for your angst. glowing4

Hey West Village; Yes, I start with the number of forks, but then read all of the recipes to sort out people who have inappropriate reasons for rating them with one fork. 90% of people are not morons, and actually I do care what Montana thinks. 10-4 on the troll.

I rate this recipe two forks since it sounds wonderful. I will try it. I live in California and will only use calfs from happy cows.

Hey mysonvaughn. The rancher got tired of seeing his cow so forlorn at the loss of her offspring that he put her out of her misery. I had one of her T-bones, and it was delicious! However, my spinach did look upset after losing some sprouts. Enjoy this recipe!

Delicious! The vin santo made it extra special. RE:mysonvaughn - why don't you find some other way to save the world, like feeding the homeless, fostering a motherless CHILD, or cleaning up rivers where fish live - I would bet you don't approve of foie gras either! Move on....

MySonVaughn is a Troll - please quit feeding it! But I do have to get a bit snarky with Bellingham WA: Do you really decide whether or not to make a recipe by how many "forks" a recipe receives? Do you really care if Bessie from Montana thinks "This is a real keeper," or that " RecipeMaven" got "rave reviews" at her last Pot-Luck? Do you really rely on the opinions of a bunch of total strangers? For all you know, we could all be a bunch of syphilitic circus-mutants! Read the recipe, use your own judgements, and make decisions. Leave the rabble out of it. Statistically, 90% of the people reading this are morons.

To mysonvaugh: please, tell the sad cow that her calf was delicious. Perhaps this will make her feel better. We live in California where only happy cows excist.

This recipe looks delish, I will have to try it. To "mysonvaughn": I will make this dish every single day just to spite ignorant people like you!

We really enjoyed this recipe, although I had to play a bit with the cooking time. I also completely agree with mysonvaughn. I think that they should butcher the mother with the calf. Oh heck, they should also through in mysonvaughn!

To the bleeding heart "mysonvaughn": This is simply not the venue to vent ones personal views. I routinely sort recipes according to the number of forks and really resent someone slanting the review when they have never made the dish. This dish was fabulous and I would make it again; as someone else said, maybe I will make it three times a week now. By the way; have you seen the bumper sticker that says "CAT: the other white meat"? Does that also upset you? Good.

I agree a recipe review is not the appropriate place to submit anti veal preferences. Go for it it is super.

to the reviewer named "mysonvaughn": So, I'm guessing you didn't make this dish...

Ah, nothing like a veal recipe to bring out the wackos. This recipe is delicious; my only complaint is the difficulty in finding good veal. It's usually too old and stringy in the Northeast. When I lived in the mid-west, they knew what veal was. And in Italy and Japan, veal was an artform. It is important in this dish to invest in the Vin Santo--it's unique and distinctive. Substituting would probably taste okay, but it's like making Veal Marsala without Marsala....

To the freak-show vegetarian or animal rights activist who felt it necessary to tug at the heart strings at us soul-less meat-eaters. I believe there are some lions in Africa who are routinely killing young anteloupe and leaving many doe-eyed moms in mourning. perhaps you should attend to that or other such silliness and leave us alone. completely inappropriate.

Thanks for the PC review, myson - now I'll be sure and make this recipe twice this week.

I was so mooooved by the previous comment I tried the recipe using boneless shoulder of tofu with little success. C'mon get a grip! If you can't stand the "meat" get out of the "kitchen"

Oh, brother. If you think it's wrong to slaughter animals for food, just say so. Skip the melodrama in a recipie forum, and go write a book.

Okay.....what in the h-e double hockey sticks is this guy in the previous review talking about?....this is supposed to be a recipe review and it sounds delicious!...Dude, we never met the mother of that veal in the picture so there is no need to share her possible feelings about her calf winding up with some fennel and Vin Santo!

I made this recipe but I did not have fennel nor vin santo, I used regular sweet wine. Everybody loved it. Next time I'll do it the same way
