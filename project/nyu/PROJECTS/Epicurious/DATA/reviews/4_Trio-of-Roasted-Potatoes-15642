Plan on making this again and again. I used halved new potatoes and sliced sweet potato for this and everyone loved it. Just perfect.

I really liked the yams in this dish but I found the other potatoes were much too dry.

I cooked one sheet of two kinds of potatoes and found that one kind took longer to roast. I like the idea but might separate the potatoes and mix them together at the end next time.

I made this dish to accompany beef tenderloin at a big dinner party and it was a huge hit! Everyone asked for the recipe before the night was over. I used fresh sage, marjoram, rosemary and thyme, all to taste/appearance. Delish!

Wow -- this was really good. The sweet potatoes/yams make this taste like candy. I didn't have time to cook for the full 75 minutes, so I partially cooked the potato wedges in the microwave for about 5 minutes and then mixed them in the seasonings and did a combo bake/broil for about 30 mintues to get them browned. Very, very good recipe.

Easy and so delicious. I used russet potatoes and red-skinned sweet potatoes, chives and thyme. I had my convection oven on 400 degrees and the potatoes were DONE in 40 minutes. Will definitely be adding these to my favorites!

I've made this recipe several times and is always a crowd pleaser. I added in rosemary this last time since I used it in the main dis to tie everything together.

Fantastic! Wonderful flavor! A great compliment to almost anything. The herbs I used were chives, parsley, and rosemary, because that's what I had at hand. It went so well with pork tenderloin I made with cranberries, balsamic vinegar, and rosemary found on this site, too.

Everyone at dinner loved the combination of the three different potatoes. What a great way to prepare sweet potatoes, which in the Midwest are typically served with marshmellows on top (not my choice).

Made this with yams, russets and parsnips. Didn't bother to peel the potatoes. Delicious.

Even my picky family who only like the "potatoes mom used to make" liked this recipe. They begged me tonight to make it for Thanksgiving tomorrow!!!

This is my family's all-time favorite potato dish. In place of russets, I used purple (not red skinned, but purple) potatoes. It makes beautiful presentation as the purple potatoes are purple on the inside, as well. The purple potatoes are tough to find though. I've only ever seen them at the Whole Foods Market or Henry's.

Served this with roasted pork loin with balsamic creanberry sauce from this site. What a smash dinner party! Will make over and over again.

I used dried herbs but the smell and flavor were still good. Be careful not to overcook like I did.

No need to peel the potatoes. I've made this for a while and it's always gotten good comments.

I made this with 2 big yukon gold potatoes, a yam, 2 big carrots, garlic and olive oil. Used lavender, sage, rosemary and thyme for herbs. Yummmy! Quick enough for weeknights and good enough for company.

This was a great addition to a pork roast. I used yams, potatoes and carrots, as I could not find sweet potatoes. I had a mix of rosemary, thyme and parsley for the herbs. Will definitely make it again.

I and my guests agree; this is a terrific recipe. I served it with an orange and herb roasted turkey breast. It was the perfect sidedish. It is one of those recipes that encourages you to be creative. My "creative" touch was a combination of yams, Yukon gold and new (red-skinned) potatoes, plus whole garlic cloves unskinned. I used only olive oil and did not use minced garlic. My herb mixture was fresh lemon thyme, rosemary, French tarragon, and flat-leafed parsley. Everyone had seconds. I would suggest that you change the number of servings to 7 or 8 and don't plan to have lots of leftovers; I didn't!

Always looking for another inventive way to do potatoes - and this is it! I used parsnips, yams and russets, herbes de provence and wow! Quick and simple.

I really simplified this one and made potatoes for two: two large russets, olive oil, and herbs de Provence. Followed everything else for a delicious and very easy potato dish.

I made this for my husband and I for valentines, it was easy and tasted so good.

A delicious way to prepare potatoes. I used new potatoes, sweet potatoes and russets. Also used the olive oil and herbes de provence. The smell is incredible. My husband loved them and everytime I have a potato dish in the oven, he asks if I'm making this dish. It's not my favorite potato dish, but good.

I used yukon gold potatoes (not a fan of russets) which turned out really well. I didn't have any marjoram so I added some fresh rosemary instead - was a nice addition. I had a fairly lean turkey this year and very little drippings were to be found. I instead used duck fat saved from a roasted duck I made a month ago. The flavour was good and the smell was even better.

Wow! Hearty and simple and almost like dessert! A nice change from plain old potatoes, easy to make, and even easier to eat.

I made this to accompany a marinated grilled lamb recipe. My guests raved about both dishes.

A definite keeper--one of the better and simple potato recipes I've tried. Thanks Betsy for showing me this one!

This was very simple and tasty. I used Herbs de Provence instead which added a wonderful flavor. The combination of the sweeter potatoes with the rosemary, and lavendar was delicious!

Very good. I made a variation of this though. I used russetts, yams, and yukon golds. No one in my home is especially fond of sweet potatoes. They actually ate and liked this though.

Wonderful! I love the combination of flavors with the 3 different potatoes. Something different from the norm. This was also a very easy dish to prepare and will go with most anything.

I made a variation of this recipe because my husband hates yams. I used one russet potato, 3 small red potatoes and one yam. I then used fresh rosemary, thyme, parsley and a sage. He couldn't believe I'd serve him yams, but he really enjoyed the recipe. When asked .... if he'd eat it again....he said..yes. Now that's a complement. I plan to make it again.

Rave reviews from my guests. Everyone loved this different twist on potatoes and asked for it again soon.
