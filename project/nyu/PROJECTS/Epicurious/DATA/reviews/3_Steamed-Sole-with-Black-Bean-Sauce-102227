Where does the soy sauce go? I searched high and low and could not find in the directions where to add, so I just splashed a little on the fish after it was cooked.I will admit, I cheated, used bottled black bean sauce with garlic instead of black beans, and used fish filets instead of whole fish. It was very tasty; I put green beans in the bottom rack of my steamer, served everything with rice; couldn't be easier!
