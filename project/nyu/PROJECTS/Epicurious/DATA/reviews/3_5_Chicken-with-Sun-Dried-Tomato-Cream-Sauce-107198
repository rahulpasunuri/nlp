I was looking for a quick recipe for some chicken and sundried tomatoes and simple ingredients. I loved this recipe BUT not sure if this review even counts as I had to change a few ingredients based on what I had at home. So maybe if some of the people who gave it 2 forks would like this: I also used shrimp, I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and I actually used red wine because I didnt have white. I didnt' use immersion method as I was just running out of time. We all loved it and especially if you love sundried tomato. We ate over pasta , I would suggest bowties. I will try again with the original ingredients and see which tastes better. for us.

Everybody liked it and ate it, but it wasn´t anything special. I would make it again, but it´s not something I would make repeatedly. The sauce had little to do with the chicken, I thought. It would probably be better over pasta.

Rating: 2
Ok, but nothing special and not worth the work. I doubled the garlic and added more wine (reduce? it evaporated the second it hit the skillet). I also used almost 2 more cups of chicken broth and it still came out of the blender as a thick paste, definitely not sauce. I had intended to use my immersion blender but there's no way there was enough liquid for that to work, even with the extra chicken broth I used. Despite the description the recipe does not make plenty of sauce (another reason I bumped up the chicken stock). I'm suspicious there's a typo in the recipe. In the end it was just boring.

Rating: 2
This tasted okay, far from one of the best on this site. I decreased the amount of pepper flakes because I don't like anything very hot and served the sauce and chicken over pasta. The sauce would be better if were a little thicker and perhaps use a little more white wine.

This dish is absolutely delicious! I've been making it for about a year now. I double (or triple) the sauce and serve it over linguine. It's on the weekly menu at my house and every time I have dinner guests I make it. Everyone loves it so much that they ask for the recipe!

My husband who doesn't like sundried tomatoes loved it. Definitely will make this again! So easy too!

I found this recipe tasty and easy to make. I agree with the fact you could use shrimp instead of chicken and it would also be good. I did not puree the sauce as it is more flavorful with the bits of sundrid tomatoes. Also did not add pepper flakes. Would be good over pasta if you aren't watching calories!

This is a delicious recipe, just be careful with the red pepper flakes. A little goes a very long way. I found this same recipe on a sun dried tomato producer's website and have been making it for awhile now. My family has certainly enjoyed this dish.

beware if you're using sun dried tomatoes from a bulk food store, mine were really salty and ruined the dish. looking forward to trying it again after either a) washing the tomatoes or b) buying jarred.

I've been making this dish for about a year now, and it is always a hit. More often than not I use shrimp instead of chicken, because frozen shrimp can be thawed in a matter of minutes, which is great for a last minute meal. I don't puree it and I usually use half and half instead of heavy cream because I usually have that in the frig. I reduce the cream and tomato mixture for about 5 minutes for a thicker consistency. I serve with a side of angel hair pasta and a tossed green salad. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Also, I forgot to include in my previous review, double the sauce! It's so good and you'll want lots of it. I also did not blend the sauce up, it's good as it is. I served this with coucous!! Give it a try, it's worth it!

Rating: 4
Delish! Because I get so bored of cooking chicken breasts, I was looking for a recipe that was good but also easy, and am I glad I found this one! Pretty much all the ingredients needed are stables in my house. I did sub the heavy cream with whole milk. I did only add a dash of red peppers due to all the reviews about it. Next time I will add a bit more since both my husband and I like a little more heat. Definitely a keeper and I will likely add this to my retation.

Rating: 0
I agree with other respondents. The red peppers overwhelm the delicate sun-dried tomato and basil flavor. Leave it out! There is no need to puree. The chunky sun dried tomatoes and chiffonaded basil is lovely in the sauce.

This recipe is a favorite in my home. It is so easy- -few ingredients, relatively relaxed timing, minimal prep--perfect for a Friday evening when you want to enjoy a glass of wine and conversation while cooking. I double the amount of sauce, use the oil from the tomatoes for extra flavor, and usually throw in an additional clove of garlic. Oh, and I use half and half instead of heavy cream for a (slightly) lighter sauce.

This is great WITHOUT the pepper flakes if you dont like spicy as much. I served it over black rice, which goes great with any kind of cream sauce.

Rating: 2
It doesn't have enough of a creamy or sun-dried tomato flavor to be called what it is. It's a decent recipe but what stands out most are the pepper flakes. I love spice, but wasn't expecting the outcome that I got. Maybe a little grated parmesan and using oil from the sun-dried tomatoes would make it taste more like it should. Either way, the ratios just aren't right for this to be called "Sun-dried Tomato Cream Sauce".

This came out fantastic! The KEY is blending the sauce, it really comes together and tastes restaurant style (I used a blender). I used chicken thighs bone in and seared them for longer to make sure they cooked through. I halved the pepper flakes.

Excellent dish. My fiance adores it and thus adores me for sourcing the recipe and preparing it for him. While trying to decide what we would make for dinner tomorrow (Valentine's) I suggested this dish and the moan from the other end of the phone was all the answer I needed. I agree with the other reviewers, cut way back on the chili pepper. I like it hot, but not that hot. As per anothers suggestion, I did not puree the sauce but instead chopped up the tomatoes. If I may suggest serving it with a spinach salad topped with strawberries, kiwi, mango, toasted pine nuts and a raspberry balsamic vinegarette and a Gewürztraminer. Bon Appetit!

This was a very good recipe. It would have been better had I used good-quality chicken broth. I ended up adding a little more cream. Also I used dried sundried tomatoes that I had plumped up in hot water, drained and then chopped up in the food processor (couldn't find them in oil). It seemed to work just fine.

I seldom give four forks, but this is superb. I did cut back on the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp and it was still pretty bitey. I served this with green beans sauteed with kalamata olives and toasted pine nuts, and rice. Perfect in every way.

Wonderful! Served sauce(without pureeing) over linguini with chicken on the side. Next time will try salmon or just make sauce for pasta and add some mushrooms. Used a bit more garlic and Delallo Sundried Tomatoes Bruschetta topping(YUM!). Agree with others that you should double the sauce. Would definitely make for guest.

Easily my new favorite chicken recipe from this site, which I followed as directed. I could tell right away that fresh basil really made the sauce special. My fiance ate the left over chicken as a foccacia sandwich the next day and I used the left-over sauce (it makes a lot for just two people) in linguine. Superior recipe and very easy to put together.

It's an easy dish to make that tastes delicious! I've made it three times now for different groups of people and everyone has enjoyed the meal. I guess you could say it's a real crowd pleaser. Note: If you like spicy foods feel free to add more pepper flakes, or chop up freshly dried one's for an even spicer kick!

Great tip to double up on the sauce. I "slimmed" it down a bit with chicken stock in lieu of the entire amount of cream. Try topping it with toasted pinon nuts.....big hit.

I followed previous reviewers instructions and doubled the recipe. I couldnt find hot red pepper flakes, not sure if they are available in Australia so I used chilli 1 teaspoon although next time I would use 2 teaspoons as the kids didn't even notice the chilli. I also used semi dried tomatoes next time I would add more. I also cut the breasts in half like a schnitzel and they cooked alot easier and were more tender. I served this with roasted pumpkin and brocolli and the sauce was yummy over the brocolli as well. Overall a good dish for during the week, quick and easy to prepare.

This was so delicious! I am a big fan of sun dried tomatoes, and for this recipe, I used sun dried tomatoes in herbs and olive oil (a big ole container from Costco). I added a couple of more garlic cloves, too. I'm going to try a vegetarian version without the chicken and chicken broth and see how that goes. I'll definitely make this again!

The chicken in this dish turned out really juicy and delicious, but I wasn't thrilled with the taste of the sauce. I would have added some canned or fresh tomatoes and more wine and cream to make it better. A little parmesan on top would help it out too. I used a food processor to smooth out the sauce - worked well.

This dish is really delicious. I made it with a variation. First of all, I did not have fresh basil, so I used dried. Probably not quite as good. Second, I pan friend thin slices of eggplant, set them aside, then pan fried the chicken. When I added the chicken to the sauce, I layed the eggplant slices on top. Then when it was all cooked, because I was not serving it right away, I gently took the slices of eggplant and layed them in a 9x13 glass baking dish sprayed with olive oil cooking spray, then I took the chicken slices and put them on top, finally covering it all with the sauce. I sprinkled it with reggiano parmesan and baked it in a low oven until we were ready to eat. I would make it again!

I made this for my husband and I and kind of used a combination of 3 similar recipes from this site for a great dinner. I made a whole recipe of sauce for 2 of us. I Doubled the garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes, used 1/2 tsp of the red pepper flakes, used more basil, and FF half and half + whole milk for the cream. Easy to make and good flavor.

Great dorm room / low on supplies recipe. I used thawed chicken breasts, dried sun dried tomatos (not in oil), cider instead of wine / broth a mix of cream and milk, and dried basil instead of fresh and I didn't blend it (I really was low on supplies). Even with all of the changes, it was delicious! The only note is that it is spicy -- I would cut back on the red pepper flakes.

I made this for my boyfriend and my roommate and we all enjoyed this dish tremendously. The chicken was so tender! Tip: don't overcook the cream sauce or it will turn into a pesto consistency, instead of the creamy sauce it is suppose to be... althought it was still extremely tasty.

What a great recipe! So simple and quick to make. Next time I will double the sauce so there's enough for the leftover chicken. I also sliced the chicken diagonally and served it that way. This one's a definite keeper for weeknights!

I've made this twice. Once with chicken (just so-so - I couldn't get any decent basil) and once with salmon (which someone had written they were going to try and I happened to have some). Both tasted good but the salmon was better because of the fresh basil. The red pepper makes it very spicy and I added more garlic than called for both times. When I made the salmon I followed the recipe exactly but had to cook it longer in the sauce because the salmon wasn't getting thoroughly cooked. As a side dish I made potato gnocchi. It tasted amazing with the salmon. I had used all the recipe's sauce on the salmon so I put a light lemon cream and parsley sauce (1 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, 4 sticks butter, fresh chopped parsley) over the gnocci which believe it not went really well. I have no idea why. For my 8 year old he got the salmon without sauce and he loved it.

Wow! I made this recipe tonight for my husband's birthday dinner (along with the almond cheesecake recipe I also found on this site--YUM) and I was really impressed. It tastes like something you would eat in a fine Italian restaurant. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts, and it turned out great. I used white table wine (1997 Chardonnay) rather than cooking wine (I've heard you should always cook with wine good enough to drink!) and it was delicious. Also, you don't need to use sun dried tomatoes in oil (I used the dried ones from the whole foods market--just put them in a half cup boiling water and let them soften up for about 15-30 minutes before cooking). As other cooks here suggested, I used 1/2 cup of heavy cream rather than just 1/4 cup, since I wanted plenty of sauce. I used fresh basil and it was great!

This is a great recipe for weeknights because it is so quick and easy. I found that the cooking time is not sufficient for very thick chicken breasts, so I seared them until they were almost completely done, deglazing the pan with a little white wine, then made the sauce and added the chicken back in at the end.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did not find a need to blend the sauce, preferred the slight chunkiness. I did use 3/4 cup fat free half&half rather than the cream, which turned out great. I'd recommend using more cream if you want extra sauce to share with your potatoes, rice, etc. :)

I used fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden instead of sun-dried tomatoes - used about 2/3 cup. I got rave reviews from the family on this dish and wouldn't hesitate to serve it to guests. I did blend the sauce, but I could see serving it unblended. Fresh basil is essential - the flavor really shines through.

This receipe was so fabulous! We had new friends over for the first time and I served this dish with Basmati rice. The presentation was elegant! I increased the heavy cream to a pint and added black olives. I chose not to puree the sauce. The guests asked for seconds of the rice and sauce alone! This was very easy to prepare too! I will absolutely make this again and have passed this receipe on to many friends the last few days! Really gives another chance for chicken to shine!

I served this dish atop a bed of fettucine noodles and it was excellent! I added a bit of sugar and slightly more red pepper flakes than the recipe called for.

I made some changes to this recipe and it is terrific! For a change, I leave out the chicken and substitute with fresh sea scallops.

Chicken with sun-dried tomato cream sauce was a very easy but impressive recipe that I will most certainly make again. It makes an excellent meal for the whole (adult) family. Mom loved it (for Mother's Day)! The sweet and peppery taste of the tomatoes, and the fresh basil, add a lot of dimension to the cream sauce. I served this over long grain and wild rice. The sauce need not be blended, it's just as tasty before that step. But learn from my experience: open and blot the tomatoes with great care- otherwise, the oil they're packed in gets everywhere.

Very good! I don't have much wine in the house, so I just used a white one that I had on hand. I put this over pasta and my husband who is pretty picky loved it. I even brought some leftovers the next day to a co-worker and she wants me to make it again.

This was okay but not great. I must admit I forgot to add the chicken broth to the sauce, so maybe that made a difference. As a result of my omission, the sauce was thick, so I added a little more cream and water to get the desired consistency.

I made this last night. I had planned on having three for dinner, but wound up having six. I had no problem stretching this recipe to feed everyone and have leftovers. I actually converted this into a pasta dish using chicken tenders which I cut into pieces and added steamed brocolli and did not blend the sauce. I poured all of this over pasta, served it with a salad and a warm loaf of sourdough bread. It was really good. We used less pepper than recipe called for and it had a nice spice - not too hot. I saved the recipe, and will be making this again.

After reading one of the reviews, I decided to double the recipe and serve it with a side serving of angel hair pasta. I doubled evreything expect the basil and hot pepper flakes.
