I haven't made this salad yet, but I wanted to let everyone know that you can make pomegranate syrup using only pomegranate juice, no need to add sugar. Just reduce until it is syrupy, about 15 min.

Too expensive of ingredients for not enough "WOW" factor.

Wonderful tasting and different I really liked this salad as is. All of the different textures come together so well, and the addition of the pomegranate molasses at the end is a great way to showcase this exceptional ingredient. I'm looking forward to trying it with the goat cheese as others had recommended. This will remain a mainstay autumnal salad.

I made this using pumpkin as I had it to hand, and also added goat's cheese as it was in a recipe for a pumpkin salad similar to this one (along with lentils). Really excellent, hearty autumnal dish. We were silenced while eating it, but got compliments after.

Exceptional salad. Made for a small dinner party and was excellent. The squash was a big hit (I increased the red pepper flakes), and the flavors of the dressing and molasses (as per recipe in previous review, though didn't need to add much) were perfect. I added goat cheese and roasted chicken, though the chicken certainly wasn't needed; the salad was substantial enough without it. My husband typically wouldn't be excited about an all veg salad for dinner, but loved this! I highly recommend.

Wonderful salad: used dried cranberries, walnuts & goat cheese, and drizzled with tangerine balsamic from Old Town Oil in Chicago

Tried this recipe last fall and have made it maybe a dozen times since. So tasty AND nutritious. I make very few alterations - I make the pomagranite syrup from the recipe in these reviews, and I crumble a little goat cheese in - a great addition that makes the salad suitable for a light meal. Sometimes I add a little brown sugar to the squash (helps it brown), and fancy up the roasted walnuts a bit with a little EVOO, brown sugar, red pepper and soy sauce. I would not call this an easy salad as some others have - actually quite time consuming by the time you are done peeling and cutting up the squash, seeding the pomagranite, roasting the walnuts, making the syrup....

Excellent! loved the combination of the sweet squash, touch of heat from the red pepper, and tart pomegranate seeds. Cooked the squash a little longer to make it a little extra browned.

I loved the salad, especially the red pepper with the squash, but thought the dressing was awful. perhaps adding a little pom molasses to it would help, or use just OJ - it was sour from the lemon and just didn't work for me.

Wow... really unique and delicious. The flavors are great together and it's nice to have a different dressing in the repertoire - the walnut oil and lightly toasted nuts are very complementary. The pomegranite molasses recipe back on the first page of these reviews is a winner if it's hard to find at the market. Opening a pomegranite for the fruit (or seeds) is super easy if you slice off the ends, score the sides vertically, submerge and break apart in a bowl of water. The seeds sink and the bitter pith floats. Best of all, no pink stains on your clothes!

Wonderful! Thank you Kenny for the pomogranate molasses recipe, a must! as for the rest...use your head, watch the butternut squash, don't over cook and enjoy!

This salad is fantastic! The flavors really go together. I couldn't find pomegranate molasses so I concentrated some pomegranate juice and used that and it seemed to work great. I also use regular extra virgin olive oil because I didn't have any nut oil on hand. It's definitely become a favorite around here!

If you can find the ingredients it's easy to make. It provides an interesting & filling appetizer or salad.

A very nice use of squash and a fabulous fall-winter salad.

This salad wasn't too hard to make, and the squash was a nice autumnal touch. I used plain pomegranate because I couldn't find the seeds. Couldn't find pomegranate molasses, either, so I just skipped it. I added some dried cranberries, thyme, and cheese.

I made this salad exactly as written for a dinner party and it won rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. At a meal where I spent a lot more time on entrees and desserts, this easy salad won just as many accolades. I like the walnut oil as it enhances the slightly nutty flavor of arugula. The OJ adds a nice twist to the standard lemon juice/vinegar dressing. This is quite similar to a Middle Eastern recipes which substitute olive oil for walnut oil and sesame seeds for walnuts, omit the OJ and add chevre.

This salad was amazing, though I also substituted pumpkin seeds for pomegranate since I could not find the latter. It is a meal in itself, hearty but not heavy. I agree with the reviewers who suggested giving the squash higher heat for less time, but watch it so it does not burn. Thanks also to people who suggested alternatives to pomegranate molasses.

This is the greatet fall salad! Everyone I've made it for loves it. The roasted squash is great - and the dressing is perfect. I highly recommend it!

very disappointing. My only 'epicurious' flop to date. The dressing was so bland, i didn't like the squash texture in the salad... the pomegranate molasses was okay but didn't save it for me. Really disappointing. I wouldn't waste time or ingredients on this again.

This was a nice salad (and very pretty) except for the squash. I agree with a previous review that the texture of the squash is a little weird in the salad. I'd prefer a texture like beets. Not sure that the walnut oil really made a big difference. I liked the dressing. Did not have the molasses so I used some agave nectar.

I would not recommend using sesame seed oil in place of the walnut oil. The taste and smell are quite over bearing for this salad, completely drowns out the butternut squash. Next time I'll use good ole extra virgin instead.

Great combination of flavors and textures. I do recommend cooking the squash at 500 for 20 minutes (make sure you turn them over at 10 minutes in). I like the combination of heat and sweetness in the roasted squash. I did not have walnut oil or OJ, but just used more lemon juice and some pomegranate juice and toasted sesame oil and olive oil instead for the dressing. I thought it might be weird, or overpowering, but with all the other flavors it ended up being subtle and delicious.

Like everything about the recipe except the pomegranate seeds. They are quite hard and spoil what is otherwise a nice recipe.

Really good. After reading the mushy squash comments, I cut mine into 1-inch pieces and baked at 500F for 20 minutes. They were perfectly caramelized on the outside and tender on the inside. Also, I didn't have any blue cheese so I added 1 tsp. finely chopped shallot to the dressing to balance the sweetness. I also made the pomegranate molasses recipe provided by Kenny1971. Divine!

For the Pomegranate Molassas- Trader Joe's has a bottled Pomegranate Glaze which I used. It's slightly sweet. I wonder how this recipe would be using a Wok? You could control the crispness of the squash. Do the walnuts first, and set aside to slightly cool. Loved the idea of adding blue cheese crumbles. Delicious!

To A Cook on 10/13, cook your squash a little hotter and for less time, it will firm up the texture but still caramelize the outside.

I liked the recipe, except that the butternut squash was a bit mushy after it was cooked. It wasn't the best texture for a salad. Any suggestions on how to aviod the squash getting mushy? I wanted to cook it enough to brown it, but maybe it was too long?

Very good and beautiful salad using fall ingredients. I had pomegranate molasses, and it did not make the salad too sweet at all. I didn't read the reviews before I made this, but now that I have eaten the salad, I agree that bleu cheese would be great with it. Served with roasted chicken, and it was a simple, easy, but delicious meal. PS. I doubled the dressing because I like more dressing on my salad. I was generous with the red pepper flakes, but would be even more generous next time because the "bite" added a lot to the salad.

This was delicious! I made the pom. molasses as suggested by another reviewer, using 1/2 his recipe so one small bottle of Pom juice was enough. Everything was perfect, loved the flavor combination just as written. Served w/ grilled sirloin flap steaks and braised fingerling potato coins from Oct. '08 also on this site. Yum!

Very good although something about texture of the roasted squash combined with all of the other (crunchier) textures threw me off. Used blue cheese- great suggestion by prior reviewer. Pomegranate molasses is a must for this dish.

We took this for a test drive in preparation for a dinner party in 3 weeks. My husband was VERY skeptical, but even he could taste that this is a winner. We agreed that we'll carmelize the squash more and make the pomegranate molasses (Thank you!). Blue cheese is a nice companion to this. Oh, and a good beverage is a Belgian Wit, the floral notes pair nicely.

Hey Kenny1971, THANK YOU for the pommegranate molasses recipe! We have loads of pommegranates, and can find pommegranate juice in stores, but I have been unable to find pommegranate molasses. Thanks for your great tip! I'll be back to review the BA salad recipe, after I have made the pommegranate molasses! Again, thank you.

delicious salad but would add blue cheese to offset sweetness of the squash. beets are also a nice addition

For those that can't find Pomegranate Molasses, you can make your own quite simply. 4 cups Pomegranate Juice, 1/2 cup Sugar, 1/4 cup Lemon Juice. In a large uncovered pan heat all ingredients over medium high heat until the sugar has dissolved and the juice simmers. Reduce heat just enough to maintain simmer. Simmer for about an hour or until the juice has a syrupy consistency. Will reduce to 1 to 1 1/4 cups. Let cool. Store in refrigerator.

I made this for dinner tonight and, while I enjoyed the result, it was a challenge to find pomegranate seeds or pomegranate molasses, so I threw in toasted pumpkin seeds instead.

Very good; surprising combination of tastes. I used a little more crushed red pepper to up the spice which I enjoyed but is not needed. Like others pomegranate molasses not to be found in the store but I did substitute a drizzle of honey and pomegranate juice mixed. This tasted good (not too sweet) but wasn't the thick "reduction" feel I imagine from the molasses.

This was really delicious. I didn't use the pomegranate molasses (couldn't find it), but I think it would have made it too sweet. Could also serve the squash on the side if you just want a light and refreshing salad.

This was really delicious. Even my 9 & 12 year olds loved it. I couldn't find the pomegranate molasses and didn't use a substitute. I think it would have been too sweet with that ingredient. Also, you could serve the squash on the side if you just want a light and refreshing salad.
