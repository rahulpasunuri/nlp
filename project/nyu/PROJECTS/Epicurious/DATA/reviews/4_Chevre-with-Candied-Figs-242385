I did not bake the goat cheese, instead simply poured the glaze over the top and placed the figs on and around it as part of a larger cheese tray and appetizer selection. It was a huge hit, several people asked for the recipe. After reading the notes from others, the only other modification I made was to put the dried figs in just a portion of the glaze, so they wouldn't soak all of it up. Definitely taste the glaze mixture, I did add a bit more sugar. Easy and excellent - will make again.

This was great. I couldn't find dried figs, so I used dried apricots and almonds. I also doubled the recipe for a little more sauce:cheese ratio. I got rave reviews from all of my guests!!

It is a great recipe, which my friend and I modified completely. It is not time of the year to get fresh figs, so we used chopped dried figs, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, chopped green olives, almonds, dry apricots, lavender sugar and vanilla essence. We cut goat cheese into round pieces and topped it with dry fruits/nuts and warmed it up in the oven for 2-3 minutes. It was delicious!

Easy peasy! And soooooo scrumptious! It is well worth spending a bit more for a good quality balsamic vinegar. Fresh figs please!

This was so tasty. I used dried figs and added a bit of water to compensate. Served with sliced apple which I soaked briefly in some lemony water to prevent browning of the apples. Tossed a couple of whole figs on the plate for looks. Sliced the chevre and stacked it on top of a layer of balsamic candied figs also for looks. It was the first appy to disappear. Would definitely do this again!

I purchased a chevre log and spread a high quality fig jam across the top. Easy and delicious.

The flavours in this combination are great. I, however, had problems with the syrup/glaze. Cooking it until the mixture sticks to the spoon results in the mixture hardening. I had to repeat it and take it off the heat earlier. The dried figs also absorbed much of the syrup. There was not enough syrup/glaze to nap the cheese, so I had to make yet another recipe of the syrup/glaze. I'd make t again but with fresh figs.
