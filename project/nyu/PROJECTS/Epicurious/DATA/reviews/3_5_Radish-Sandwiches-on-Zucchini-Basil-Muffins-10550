Fantastic flavors. I don't use shortening, so I made these with butter, and since these were for a family breakfast I used half AP flour and half whole wheat. Baking these in regular muffin tins is easy but take care that they are baked enough. We make these in double and triple batches when zucchini and radishes are plentiful!

I made the muffin part only and they came out delicious! I didn't have shortening so I used butter and it came out very moist. I also added 3/4 cup of gruyere cheese and 2 tbsp of chopped chives, delicious!

Addendum to my last review. This bread is FABULOUS! Every time I had a sandwich with it, I loved it even more. Cut in thin lengthwise pieces, toast, and put some deli turkey and mayonnaise on it and you'll be in love. So, so great.

I made it as a bread. So far, I've had two slices and I like the crunchier part better, so maybe muffins is the way to go. The taste is great, a bit too salty, but that's easy to remedy. I bet a little mayo and some turkey with the radish would be fantastic.

Contest winner for a soup and sandwich event in Atlanta GA! I made the bread in two loaf pans with thyme instead of basil. Pressed the bread in a panini press with stilton and fresh peaches. Delish (served it with a maple butternut squash soup)

I reted this 4 forks not only because I loved it, but thought it was so inventive. I had zucchini, basil and radishes on hand. Didn't have shortening, so used butter; also added extra basil--probably 1/4 cup more and was glad I did; also used regular milk--no trips to the store! Made as regular muffins. Just ate one with several slices of radish and butter. YUM. I'm going to try adding some grated parmesan next time. I think it would take them up another notch. Next time, I'll make the minis and serve them as an appetizer.

these muffins are a delicious savoury treat! i am very happy that i decided to try this recipe, and the feedback from other reviewers has been a bonus. good advice from other cooks to avoid skimping on either the fresh basil or the black pepper...those are exactly the elements which make these muffins so delightful. as i had used up all of the fresh basil in my garden, i decided to try a batch using the same amount of fresh lemon thyme - oh my! i think i might even like these better than the basil batch...is that possible??

I think this might help the one fork folks. People who love basil want to fully taste it. Instead of putting it in the muffin, I used the same chopped basil sprinkled on the radish. What a difference! I made them both ways because my kids LOVE zuke bread. I omitted the pepper in the muffin too, and sprinked it on the radish.

I tried these today and honestly, what a waste of beautiful basil!

These are fantastic! I use the muffins not only as sandwich halves for the radishes, but also on their own with lunch. Fantastic flavor, definitely do not skimp on the pepper, can be made successfully with regular 1% milk as well. They also freeze well.

Because of this recipe, I planted three extra basil plants this year in my garden. I make the muffins large and serve them with homemade tomato soup. Since I try to avoid trans-fats, I wonder if anyone has tried to substitute oil for the shortening and what was the result?

I cannot figure out where I went wrong but for me these muffins were bland and tasteless!

I've made these probably six or seven times now; they're so, so good. (I reserve 4 forks for truly "beyond compare"). I make them regular size and, as much as I love radishes, these muffins are perfect on their own. You can also use other fresh herbs besides basil when great basil isn't available; I just tried a mix of chopped thyme, sage, and rosemary (about 1/4 cup) and the muffins were very good.

A really good savory muffin. I served these (without the radishes) with white bean and chard soup. Delicious!

I made this as regular size muffins as well. I really packed in the zucchini and the basil as I have an abundance of both and it still came out great. Tried it with the butter and radish and it was quite delicious, but will also just be serving as a dinner roll.

Used too much grated zuke and had a dry mixture so I added a pea-sized dollop of butter on top of each muffin before baking. We thought they were great.

I made these in a regular-size muffin tin, no radishes, and they were delicious. I added more basil, about 3/4 cup because I misread the recipe at first, but I would do the same again. I'll definitely make these again.

I make these in regular (1/3 cup) muffin tins and it makes 10 muffins to serve as a dinner bread. Bake 15 minutes at 400. Forget the radishes. They will be a regular while I have zucchini and basil in the garden! Surprisingly sweet for having only 1 tablespoon of sugar.
