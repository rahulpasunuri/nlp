This is for PrettyBritty...I am using this recipe, but another I have doesn't call for eggs so I am skipping them. Hope it works!

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to make this without the eggs? We have an egg allergy in the family, and I'm wondering if I should substitute something or could just make it with more stock.

Made this for Thanksgiving last night and thought it was great. I added some fresh thyme. Next time I will use a smaller dice on everything.

I've made this dressing every Thanksgiving since the recipe came out in 2000 - my favorite and a huge hit with family and friends. My neices ask me to double the recipe every year so that they can have a few days of "stuffing bowls" after T-Day and I'm happy to oblige! I agree with other reviewers that the stock needs to be increased to roughly four cups, depending on the bread you're using. I use sourdough baguettes for their tang and they do take a lot of liquid. I use a sage sausage, such as Jimmy Dean Sage, and also dice the apples into smaller pieces than recommended. Other than that, the recipe is "as is." Fabulous dressing and it will be made in my household for decades to come!

I made this dressing and my family thought it was delicious. I changed it up just a bit - I added more turkey stock, diced my apples a little smaller and did not use the baguettes instead I used Peppridge Farms cornbread stuffing. I will continue to use this recipe whenever I make dressing.

Tasted great! I used almost double the stock and still found the dressing a little dry. But the flavor was right on target.

Even the non stuffing lovers enjoy this - Fantastic and my absolute favorite. I do substitue regular whole bread for the baguettes - I cube the bread and toast it in the oven as directed in the recipe.

to make this over-the-top, make your own french bread (cuts down on the sog factor) and add 1 1/2 cups of homemade turkey stock just before serving. this can be made just as well with sweet italian turkey sausage and cut down tremendously on the fat. using home made turkey stock is an absolute must. this can be done a week or two in advance using turkey backs and wings & frozen for your dressing and gravy.

I thought the flavor was good...not great. Great would have been the result from more sausage, more sage and some thyme, too. I've made it before, and will make again. Be sure to add more liquid, too, as other reviewers have indicated.

Rating: 3
This is a decent, if rather uninspired, dressing. I used two complete baguettes as the recipe calls for, but this seemed to be too much bread when blended with the other ingredients. It's definitely way too dry - I doubled the liquid, and poured some of the spooned-off grease from the turkey over it to give it a little turkey flavor. Part of the problem may have been the bread - I used the long French baguettes that my grocery store sells, but it seemed too dense. I would suggest finding some lighter-textured baguettes. I tried an experiment with this recipe: since I wasn't cooking it in the turkey, I bought some turkey thighs for really cheap, and then pulled the skin off them and covered the stuffing in the pan with it during baking. This allowed some turkey flavor to drip into the dressing, while preventing it from getting too dried-out and crisp on top. This actually worked!

Rating: 3
Agree with other reviewers that the recipe needs a bit more sausage and a lot more liquid. I also chopped my ingredients more finely than the recipe calls for. I used a nice garlic/rosemary sausage...wish I would have bought just a bit more than 1 pound, though.

I made two dressings for Thanksgiving and no one had seconds of this one so I had a lot left over. When I reheated it I added more stock and it was MUCH better. I will make it again with more liquid and will cut the vegatables a little smaller.

This stuffing is unbelievably flavorful. My mom and I both make it to accompany turkey dinners and have converted numerous traditional stuffing fans. Chicken sausage is just as good and we have used focaccia as a sub for french bread which helps with the moisture. I do add a bit more liquid as well as additional fresh herbs. ENJOY... it is a fantastic treat!

Rating: 3
This is very similar to the delicious dressing that I ate growing up. Next time I will increase the sausage in the sausage-to-bread ratio.

I have made this over and over again to accompany roast chicken or turkey, and it's a winner. I do substitute cornbread for one baguette, and add some savory as well

My Thanksgiving day guests didn't normally eat bread dressing, so i wanted to try something flavorful, but not overpowering. This was a big hit, they even went back for seconds!

I make this stuffing every year, and though I do not generally like stuffing, this one is very good. I follow the recipe to the letter except I do chop everything a bit smaller.

I made this for Thanksgiving. The flavor was very good, but the top seemed quite dry. I might add more liquid next time.

I originally tried this recipe because of the rating given it by Aaron (it seemed so honest). Well, I have to tell you that it was absolutely terrific, and everyone is now asking for it! I found it very tasty, and will admit that I used only fresh herbs, and brought the bread at a local french bakery (makes a world of difference to any dressing/stuffing).

A meal in itself! Very clean flavors. Got to use apples from my tree. Next time, however, I'll dice the bread & sausage smaller. Everyone loved it for my recent Canadian Thanksgiving dinner for my friends.

i made this dish for a skeptical traditional in-the-bird-stuffing loving crowd of in-laws. they were all converts for an unstuffed turkey, and amazingly loved this even though they are quite used to their stove-top, but it was definately too dry. i loved it myself - first time ever for stuffing/dressing - but again it seemed awfully dry. the chewiness was nice, but i think next year ill try adding an extra cup or so of turkey stock just before i serve it. the flavor was great - those who found it flavorless should look into their quality of ingrediants or ability to follow directions.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year. I purchased an excellent, flavorful sausage, and still found this to be an utterly tasteless dish. Everyone else at the holiday table left it on their plates. Only my dogs devoured it with gusto.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe exactly, except the sausage was replaced with kielbasa, which was what I had in bulk in the freezer. The stuffing was nice, not spectacular. The flavor of the apples did not come through as much as expected, and some of the veggies became rather mushy. I think this might be fixed through a little adjustment of timing when addiing ingredients to the pan. Still, considering it was my first Thanksgiving dinner, and that up till then the most complicated western meal I had prepared was linguine with clams, this turned out surprisingly well!

Try this recipe - it's great. Doubled it for a party and had to make some slight changes. They only had 1 baguette left at the local market, so ended up using french sandwich rolls (Pioneer brand for those on the West coast). Was worried, but it came out fine. It took a little longer to toast in the oven (1 hour 15 min) and I ended up with over 25 cups (remember, this was a double recipe). Used 2 large disposable baking pans which worked out perfectly. I used golden delicious apples (what I had on hand) and was glad I did - they are slightly more sweet and soft than granny smiths - and it married well with the other flavors. I also added a small amount of dried cranberries ('craisins') for visual appeal. Took the advice of other cooks and cut the vegetables smaller and also cooked them a bit longer before mixing with the bread cubes. The fresh sage is a must. Oh, I also added sliced fresh mushrooms (2 packages of the plain, white ones). Any other type of mushrooms would have been too intense for this recipe - nothing should stand out on it's own - it's the overall mix of flavors and textures that's wonderful. Almost decreased the amount of eggs (seemed like too much) but was glad I stuck with the original recipe regarding proportions. May toss in a handful of pecans next time. Oh - last thing. I always use italian parsley for cooking, but had run out, so had to use regular parsley instead. I actually think the slight bitter edge worked for the best.

We made this without the sausage, as some reviewers suggested. Without the sausage, it was very bland, even with added poultry seasoning. Had to cook the veg's longer, and added more broth. Guess by the time I was done, it became a totally different recipe. Anyway, wouldn't do it again even with the sausage.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a classic. A good trick is to add dried porcini mushrooms and use granny smith apples. I usually mix this recipe with another one that has many of the same ingredients. It's a favorite with everyone. I make it every Thanksgiving in a large turkey roasting pan and somehow that is never enough.

I haven't tried this stuffing yet, but I will the next time I cook a turkey. However, I just had to comment on Aaron's review. I was howling with laughter. Thanks for the warning, Aaron.

I made this for Christmas dinner, a real change from the traditional cornbread stuffing I had been making for years. Thanks to the previous comments, I used the full amount of liquid. I also resisted the temptation to stuff the bird and cooked it separately. It was excellent. Every loved it and my brother commented, "this might be the best stuffing I've ever had!" I believe the cornbread stuffing has just been replaced!

First, I have to tell you that I personally don't like this dressing. But since the first time I made it, everyone raves about it, it all disappears every time, and people talk about it constantly. When we invite people for Thanksgiving they ask me if I'm making "that wonderful dressing" again. So beware. If you make this, and you don't personally like it, chances are overwhelming that everyone else will and you'll have to make it every year until you die.

Huge hit at Thanksgiving...used fake sausage (boca italian sausage) and even my meat-loving family enjoyed it atop their turkey. I enjoyed plain.

This dish was a great success on Thanksgiving! Although I did modify the recipe a bit ; ) I used turkey sausage and instead of baguettes used ~ 1 1/2 boxes of Pepperidge Farm "turkey stuffing" bread crumbs until I got the right consistency. Enjoy!

Thank you, Jasper! I was terrified that my first time making Thanksgiving dinner I would be doomed to failure in the stuffing department. I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT used only about half the sausage and added just a sprig of thyme. It was EXCELLENT, best stuffing ever (I stuffed some in the bird, baked the rest). I liked the big cut of the cubes and veggies--a bit more sophisticated, it seemed. Definitely toast the baguette long, light and slow--I think it helped the flavor. A real winner (I say this rarely). I finally feel like a grownup.

Awesome! Made this wonderful dish for Thanksgiving this year and the family ranted and raved about it for days. Out of all the leftovers, everyone immedidately started with the stuffing. Took advice of eariler reviewers and chopped vegetables smaller. Also modified recipe slightly...used a mixture of sweet and hot italian sausage (1.5 lbs), added 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms, and 3 cloves of Garlic. Used Red Delicious apples. It was wonderful. Excellent dish and definitely a keeper.

I was very pleased with the results of this recipe, and so were my 10 Thanksgiving guests. This was my first T-bird dinner and it was a raving success, this was one of the three recipes I used from this website. Excellent, I split up the combined stuffing in half and used half in the bird (to stuff with) and the other half baked in a small casserole (reduce cooking time to avoid drying out) and then my guests had a choice of dryer or moister stuffing, since there always is a dispute per personal taste..

This is simply a great dressing. I had vegetarians coming for Thanksgiving, so I omitted the sausage. It was still the best ever. Rave reviews from all my guests.

When mixing up the dressing it just looked too dry, so I added more chicken broth. It was unnecessary. It turned out too mushy for my family's taste. That said... I still didnt' have any leftovers. Next time I'll make it with no changes.

This was good stuffing...but too much sausage. Next time I would use less sausage as it overpowered the other flavors. YES, PLEASE chop all the ingredients finer, especially the sausage. I added mushrooms to mine. That was a nice addition. Also, during the baking process I added some turkey drippings. Good for moistening!

Rating: 4
Wow, wow, WOW! This was SO much better than mushy (or worse, dry) cornbread dressing!! I added 3/4 cup Craisins, two teaspoons of dried rosemary, and two teaspoons of dried thyme, which added even more complexity to the already overwhelming mix of flavors. (I took this addition from another dressing recipe I have.) I also took the advice of several reviewers to chop the ingredients smaller-- about 1/4" dice for everything but the bread, which I cut to a 3/4" dice. The people at my party devoured this before they had even made a dent in the cornbread dressing that someone else had brought!! I wish I had some leftovers, but it was so easy to make, I'll have no trouble whipping up some more!

I made this for an early Thanksgiving dinner and got raves from everyone at the table ... and 3 people demanded the recipe on the spot. Forgot to dot with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and it was still fantastic. In fact, that much butter might have made it overly heavy. Either way, this recipe is a keeper!

Doubled the recipe, and added toasted almonds finely chopped carrots and used bacon instead of sausage.( We are not big fans of mystery meat). Also added 2 table spoons of fresh rosemary and two teaspoons of dry thyme in place of the second half of sage. Killah!

This recipe was great! The bread cubes were the perfect texture, not mushy or hard. The sage added a wonderful flavor to the sausage and apples. However, I chopped the ingredients finer. Everyone at my table loved it. I will make this dressing every year for the holidays.

12/14/01 Very tasty! We made this recipe for Thanksgiving and my husband and son who loved it. I'm sending it to my daughter who wants to use it for Christmas. We substituted packaged bread cubes and dried herbs. This was the first time I'd made a dressing outside the turkey.

HI, I made this for some very picky eaters for Thanksgiving. I added cornbread in addition to the french bread and even made it the night before. Before baking, I just poured some chicken broth over the top. It came out just perfect and everyone wanted the recipe.

What a great recipe! Luckily, I still had some sage in my herb garden. I chopped everything smaller than recommended, I knew my family would like it better that way. To the dressing that was not in the turkey, I added a little more broth and butter. The toasted baguette pieces did not get mushy, but weren't croutons either. Was perfect and is destined to be a tradition.

Wonderful stuffing recipe - great texture and wonderful flavor. The use of toasted baguettes produced a stuffing that was moist, but not a pile of mush - the bread cubes remained intact. I agree about chopping the ingredients more fine than what is called for. I also added some dried cherries, which provided a nice contrast.

A terrific recipe. I think that the cube sizes should be a bit smaller (but this is also coming from someone whose husband said "I like the stuff from the box better, honey."). I toasted the bread cubes; it lent flavor and also a little more color to the dish. Also, I baked the stuffing on Sunday and froze until Thursday. I let it thaw for some of the morning and then baked it for a half hour at 350. Perfect.
