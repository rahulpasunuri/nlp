I haven't made this yet but I have the actual magazine from 1999 and the recipe states 1/3 cup of hazelnuts--I wonder if that's why one reviewer said the hazelnuts overpowered? Will try it w 1/3 and see what the topping feels like before adding additional.

I LOVE this recipe. Although I have not made it with hazelnuts, but almonds and pecans. I have gotten rave reviews from EVERYONE who has tried it!!!

This recipe, as written, is not very good. The hazelnuts are overpowering and if you used ripe pears, the sugar in the fruit filling is too much and is way too sweet. The overall effect is syrupy fruit with a fairly dry crust. You can omit the hazelnuts, substitute with almonds, decrease the sugar in the filling, add cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg to the recipe to improve it but it wouldn't be the recipe they have provided here.

This was fantastic - for a little variation I added cardamom and cinnamon to the crumb topping and cinnamon and orange juice to the filling - I used toasted walnuts because it's what I had - still devine!!

It's amazing something this ugly could taste soooooo good! It's a fabulous recipe, even though it's not the most beautiful of dishes. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla powder (not extract) to the sugar used in the pear filling to give it a little kick. Major yummy!

This is a great recipe. We've made this several times and it never fails to impress. I would actually give it 3.5 forks, but the rating system doesn't allow it. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I have made the "free-form" pie many times and it always comes out great. It is a perfect fall dessert; ideal for thanksgiving. It looks rustic and tastes luscious- not overly sweet.

The crust was easy; however if you leave it in the frig too long, it will be a challenge to roll out. Thirty minutes is probably enough. If in the frig overnight, let sit out 30 minutes before rolling. Parchment paper is a must. Some baking sheets will pop and become unlevel, causing a galette like this to slip off! Try using a large pizza pan (without holes); there is enough of a lip to prevent problems. To the pear filling I would add 1 tablespoon lemon zest, a teaspoon vanilla extract, and maybe the cinnamon as another reviewer recommended. The filling did need a boost.

I will surely make this often. Everyone loved it and it is easy to make. The toasted hazelnuts really give it a superb flavor.

Terrific pastry and so easy to prepare. I added one teaspoon of cinnamon to the pears and it was wonderful. The croustade took less than the 40 minutes in the recipe to start to brown, so watch it towards the end. The only thing we didn't care for was the addition of the vanilla ice cream. I used gourmet ice cream, so that wasn't the problem. I think that the ice ream was just too sweet to go wiith a relatively un-sweet dessert. Next time I will try some lightly whipped cream or maybe creme fraiche.

Made this recipe a few times and it was terrific. The crust was very easy to make and very tasty. Just use a parchment paper to pick up the sides to form the croustade. Haven't made for awhile but will be sure to do so again. Never topped pears w/cinnamon but I'm sure it would be very good. I will try it that way next time. Be sure to eat this dessert warm w/the vanilla a la mode!

This was a wonderful conclusion to a terrific fall meal. The crust is fabulous and (if you buy good quality pears) the filling is perfect as is. I didn't change a thing and my guests went back for seconds!

Delicious crust. Visually very appetizing. It was a big hit.

Easy and quick to make. Using the food processor for the dough is a must. Also the wax paper--makes dealing with pastry a breeze. Using the lower layer of paper to fold up the pastry provides a way to catch any juices that run out. I've already made many times.

Very easy to make, and just the right amount of sweetness. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Have already made it again!

Very bland -- at the very least I would suggest using SALTED butter, it needs salt. Also, try adding a pinch of cinnamon and/or nutmeg to the pears - they could use a little zip. Be careful with baking it, as mine stuck to the parchment and ended up looking more like a pile of pears and crust than the beautiful croustade it should have been.
