This was yummy but had some problems. First off, the pudding never did set and it's still quite runny (I was hoping chilling it would help but it didn't). It does have an excellent flavor. After 45 minutes of beating the eggs, sugar and vanilla at high speed (on my Kitchenaid Professional Mixer) the mixture still wasn't creating a ribbon and I finally gave up. I baked it and of course it didn't rise so I didn't bother with cutting anything off and saving (although it makes a great treat for chocolate fondue). It tasted okay but not great. Lastly it says it serves 4 but I'm guessing that is for people who can really eat because I would guess that I have enough servings for 6 more people after serving up 2 portions. Also you must cut the time the pecans bake to just under 10 minutes or they will burn like all hell, I had to throw the first batch out which did not make me happy as they are very expensive right now. Bon appetit!

I made the pudding 3 times and none set. Seems like something is missing in this recipe.

This recipe was a DISASTER; the pudding did not set and the sponge cake (which I have made before using other recipes) separated and I had to cut off the bottom layer. The only good thing were the glazed pecans, which could have stayed in the oven a little less longer. Also in the recipt for the spongecake, it does not specify whether the butter should be softened or melted. VERY DISAPPOINTED

Sorry about entering 2 reviews - I did not think the 1st one was submitted.

The pudding came out good although I think the portion is too big for the small cake. Too time-consuming and it does not leave you wanting to do it again. I love trying new recipes but this one was disappointing. Next time, I will make my own sponge cake as this one came out too hard and not absorbant enough.

I made the pudding last night to save time today. I don't know if the time this takes is worth it as the sponge cake came out hard and too thin. The amount of pudding is too big for such a small portion of cake. It tasted good but it's too time consuming and I was left feeling disappointed. I don't think I'll try it again and if I do, I have my own recipe for sponge cake that is truly a "sponge".

I have to start off by saying that we are a family of chocolate dessert eaters and rarely love anything that doesn't have chocolate in it. Despite this predispostion, we made and LOVED this recipe. It takes some time, but is absolutely worth it. For me, both the pudding and the cake batter took longer to reach the desired consistencies than the times listed in the recipes. For the cake batter, do not be timid and set your stand mixer to the higher speed. This is a recipe to impress dinner guests, and I recomment making it the night before (except the final layer of whipped cream). We had leftovers and put them in the fridge - tasted great the next day as well. This is a keeper!

I just made the pudding, no pecans, no cake. But let me tell you, this was the best pudding I've ever had! No lie!! The bourbon flavor is amazing (a may have put a smidge more in there than called for). I served it with sliced bananas and vanilla wafers, and my boyfriend (who is a cook, and I generally don't consider myself one) was floored! Highly recommended, especially if you love bourbon like I do!!

Have all day to devote to something? Make this! Seriously, I made it on a Saturday night and it really took about 3 hours from top to tail. I love banana pudding so I was excited to make this. I also love bourbon which, in hindsight, might have been why this took me so long to make. *chuckle* The pudding is really quite good. Do make sure to let it boil to thicken, though, as otherwise it will become quite runny in the dish. The sponge cake is also quite good. The glazed pecans would actually just be good to make on their own (had to chase husband out of kitchen to prevent him from eating them all. was hilarious given amount of bourbon consumed). I think to speed things along I'd buy a sponge cake and use that. Finally, we made it as a big trifle-type dessert instead of as individual desserts. That worked well, but you definitely need a lot of whipped cream for the top. In all, I liked it, but I'm not sure that for the effort it's that much better than vanilla wafer banana pudding. I think if I made it again I'd do the pudding and the nuts and probably use vanilla wafers.
