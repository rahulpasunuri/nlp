Excellent recipe. Pay special attention to the 2 ounce ramekin. I didn't-mine are 6 ounces. I ended up having to triple the recipe. Because of this, they didn't steam properly, and I ended up microwaving them to get the custard to set. With all the setbacks, it still came out perfectly, but next time, I will use 2 ounce ramekins.

Very simple flavors! Had hot sauce on hand to spice it up. Lets face it anything with crab is good. I'd make this again, but add maybe a little sherry and old bay to corn/egg!

Very light flavors that really compliment the crab. A breeze to make, would be great for parties. I made a triple recipe to fill 4 6oz ramekins as a main course. I also skipped the corn-straining part and they turned out fine. My only recommendation would be to let the custards cool a little before serving, as they are very hot!

I've made this recipe exactly as stated a couple of times to rave reviews... It's simple, delicious and elegant...

Used fresh Dungeness crab. Used 8 oz ramekins. Steamed them on a folding rack in the same pot used to boil the corn (as a bachelor, minimum clean-up is important to me). The larger ramekins needed about 12 minutes to cook. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Quick, easy, and delicious.

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I used 8 oz. ramekins so they needed to steam a little longer. The crab and corn combination was excellent. The taste was delicate and very sweet. Definately will make this for company. It's the kind of dish that will impress.

This is so simple to make, and the taste is incredible. I served this at a gourmet dinner party and it received rave reviews from all that attended. I will definitely make this again.

Be careful not too overcook the custards or they will become grainy. Good alternative for fresh corn.

Only complaint was that the custard was a bit wattery...probably just an error on our part. Other than that, the mix of flavors was great.

So easy and so tasty! I used fresh corn, but skipped the straining step (it was very smooth after a whirl in the blender.) Very, very good. I'll be making this quite a lot, perhaps with different toppings when crab is not available.

Wonderful! It was rich tasting, but light with a creamy texture. I added a little crab to the custard. I was amazed at how easy this recipe was and it produced big WOW's when served.

I thought this was a terrific recipe for a different way to prepare corn. I used shrimp instead of crab. Good, easy to prepare -- and would be great to serve to company.

I used other light fish flavors besides the crab and it was fantastic. Also I added the everpresent mexican jalapeño on the side.

Messy with the pureed corn but the flavor is fabulous.

This was wonderfully rich tasting, easy and looked wonderful! I used fresh corn, cut off the cob then boiled, but I skipped the straining step. It was still smooth and yummy! The crab topping was perfect and we even used chilled claw meat from a can. I will try other toppings like the previous reviewer mentioned. Both shrimp and bacon toppings both would be great!

The custard is the key. I used left over grilled corn on the cob and blended them with the cup of hot milk...really easy. The topping can be any combo of ingredients such as shrimp and herbes de provence or bacon and tomato saute. It's simply delicious.

I served this dish at a small dinner gathering and it was a big hit! The recipe consists of only several ingredients and it is very easy to make. The only thing I would suggest is increasing the measurements so there's more to go around!
