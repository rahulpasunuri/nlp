We ate this corn at a Mexican Restaurant in Boston and it was memorable as being excellent but hot off the grill at home is even better.

A tasty alternative to the traditional butter and garlic. Will do it again, albeit with a healthier mayo. LOL.

I will never eat corn prepared any other way. No kidding. I recommend a little extra cayenne, and I squeezed the lime juice right into the mayo, as other reviewers have suggested. I made a self-serve operation at the table, encouraging guests to "paint" their own corn with the mayo (had a brush on the table) and roll it in the cheese (which I spread out on a plate). Wet naps encouraged!

Wow - this was really, really good! After trying this once, this has been the only way we've been preparing corn all summer. For what it's worth, I recommend mixing the lime juice into the mayonnaise. We tried it both ways and prefer that to drizzling on top of the cheese...

Outrageously good. We have had this for dinner three times in two weeks. My friend in Chicago told me about a similar dish served by street vendors who cut the corn off of the cob, which we might try because we'd love to make it for guests, but it is as messy as it is sabroso. Four stars plus.

A tasty change up for a Mexican side dish. I boiled white corn, worked fine, although I'd like to try it again using grilled ears.

I used frozen white corn (i don't have a grill), a dollop of sour cream instead of mayo, a generous dash of chili powder, lime juice, and a bit of sweet lime-pepper seasoning. i was able to find the cotija, which i think was milder and a bit richer than parm would have been. very easy and utterly delicious result. the guest said it was the best corn dish he'd ever had and went back for seconds. i loved it and can't wait to share the recipe with friends.

This is one of my favorite dishes at a nearby local restaurant. The size of the grate is key (think small) and use mayo sparingly. Always delicious!

We loved this recipe. I was afraid the mayo flavor would be overwhelming, but it wasn't at all. Just tasted very rich and delicious. We served it as a side to the spicy grilled skirt steak - wonderful together. We'll definitely make this one again.

So so so good. It may be messy but totally worth it. I'll have to try taking the corn off the cob and making a mixture of all the ingredients like others have suggested.

yum yum yum! the mayo mixture was a huge hit at our bbq today. a refreshing change from the typical corn on the cob.

This is so delicious, that my husband refuses to eat corn any other way now! In fact he has requested it every night this week. I mixed the fresh squeexed lime into the mayo instead of directly on the corn to give it the "mayonnaisa" flavor. Yumm!!!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes and nearly everyone who eats it says that it is the best corn they've ever eaten. Call me a purist, but don't bother making this if your not going to use cotija. Rather than regular mayonnaise I use Mayonnaisa (mexican mayo, has lime mixed into it). Although it is typically very difficult to find I also use "Chile para Naranja" instead of cayenne.....it's a chile powder with salt and other spices added AND it's what they use when they sell this treat outside of the Latino markets in Texas.

Have been wanting to make Mexican corn for so long. Altered this recipe a bit. Used one part mayo to three parts sour cream and mixed with one minced chipotle pepper. For cheese, I mixed feta with parmasean and smeared this mixture on cob with gloved hand first. Then I brushed on sour cream/mayo/pepper mix. Finally, drizzled lime juice and a dash of paprika. Wrapped and served in tin foil. Corn Heaven!

For a true and more Mexican experience, you might want to add chilli powder -the one that includes salt and some acidity- to sprinkle on top. Also, if you're boiling it the corn, you might want to try adding a bit of butter and epazote to the pot. That way, either on the cob or cut off, the corn will taste particularly good. :) The cut off, served in a little plastic cup version is called esquite, and is the equivalent of corner-street hotdogs.

This was amazing! I couldn't grill because of the weather, so I used my grill pan inside and grilled the corn on that. Then, took the advice of others and cut the corn off the cob, put it in a pan with a bit of water - let that evaporate, then added the mayo, parmesan cheese (didn't have anything else), cayenne pepper & a dash of lime. It was gone! Soooo good. Can't wait for summer to try it as written!

This was amazing! I made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks for different friends. It got rave reviews all around. I did a few things different: I boiled the corn b/c I can't grill at my apartment. Also, instead of cojita or feta, I used already grated parmesan cheese. It cuts down on the preparation time and tastes awesome.

I've also had this corn at a place called El Habana while visiting a friend in NYC, and it blew me away. Last night I tried to recreate it and did not succeed. Can't wait to try this one out!

I have seen this made in Mexico by dipping the corn in mayo then sprinkle with hot sauce and add cheese. I use parmesan. It is not really suppose to melt. Then add lime... YUMMY!!!

I love the corn at Cafe Havana in New York, and now I can make it at home. Made the corn with feta cheese, and it was wonderful. However the cheese turned into slop and started to slide off. At the resturant in New York, the cheese appeared to be more "grated". Did anyone experience the same as I did?

I thought it was pretty good, but everyone else at the party wasn't too impressed. I'll definitely grill it the way described since it's better than using foil, but I may only make enough of the mayo stuff for my corn. My boyfriend asked me to never make it again, but I like it enough that I may defy him.

I made this last night and VERY pleased. I blended a chipolte pepper with my mayonaise and used only a light amount on each stalk of corn. I also skipped the boiling step and let the corn grill for a full 30 minutes in foil. When I pulled them off the grill I slathered on the mayo and used a liberal amount of cotija cheese, then I rewrapped them in foil to let everything melt together. Once the lime was sprinkled on, it tasted amazing! Kinda messy, but well worth it. My wife and I will be using the recipe more often.

The biggest hit at my "Last Day of being 49" celebration-even the kids liked it. Have never made it with the cheese called for in the recipe but always used whatever slightly salty cheese strikes my fancy and always use freshly picked sweet corn.

Rating: 4
Wonderful, and just like they sell at the stands in Mexico! If you don't have cotija or feta, grated parmesan or even romano cheese work quite well. The important thing is for the corn to be fresh.

Simple, beautiful, messy and delicious. The cheese is easy to find in Washignton state markets.

I nearly skipped over this recipe for my fourth of July menu because I didn't think it sounded all that appetizing. Mayo on corn? But I took a chance on it and I'm glad I did. Delicious, messy, spicy, the flavors work well together. I rubbed lime on the corn before grilling and used feta.

This is served at a nearby popular restaurant in NoLiTa called Cafe Habana. Everyone orders it there and now I am thrilled to be able to make it at home. Try it for a cookout! So simple and so delicious.

I first had this dish while in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico. I loved it so much, I had it every day. This recipe is as authentic as you can get without being in the jardin standing next to the street vendor.

Outstanding! I tried asiago but I think it would have been better with a slightly softer cheese so it melts better. I'll try feta next time. Will definitely make again!

When I was first presented with this recipe three years ago I was skeptical, but we made the corn for a party where it was met with rave reviews. This corn is great for nearly any occassion, especially when you need a dish that is going to make a lasting impression. Whenever I make this recipe for a party I always have copies of the recipe, because someone always asks for it! An all time favorite!!

Yes indeedy, this is a definite keeper. The first time I made it I tried the one reviewer's method of mixing the cheese with the mayo but I like it better the other way. It gets gooey when you mix it up and doesn't look nearly as appetizing when serving. I must say that mayo on corn sounded very unappealing but this was a truly delicious way of serving corn.

This recipe rocks! Soooo good. Tried with grated parmesan and second time with cotija. Both different, both excellent. Definitely mix the cheese with mayo before spreading on hot corn. I did eventually cut the corn off the cob because it does get messy.

I made this last month for family and friends and everyone loved it so much I've been asked to make it again this Labor Day weekend. It is quite messy to eat, but well worth it. I've had not luck however finding cojita, but feta works just fine. A great way to re-create corn on the cob.

I cooked this corn for a family gathering in South Carolina. There was not a kernel left! Finding the Cotija cheese is a bit of a challenge, but well worth it. I will make it again soon!

This was outstanding--highly recommended!! I made it the first time with Asiago, the second time with cotija. It was WAY better with asiago--probably wouldn't have made it again had I originally used cotija.

Fabulous!! Messy, but wonderful flavor. I used grated fresh asagio cheese, because that is what I had on hand. We are planning to do this for a party this weekend! Try!

Rating: 4
This rather simple dish is beyond delicious and has found a permanent place on all our BBQ menus. Guests devour it every time. One suggestion: a better balance of flavors is achieved when you mix the cotija into the mayo before putting it on the corn. And don't skimp on the lime!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe, although cotija is rather difficult to find. It's sold in both powdered form (similar to parmesan cheese), and solid (similar to feta). I think the powdered version is definitely superior (this is the way i've had it served to me at cuban restaurants as well). If I can't find the powdered variety again, i'd try preparing it with parmesan rather than feta.

This was terrific and easy! I too substituted feta and it worked well. Will definitely make this again soon.

Fantastic! No leftovers with this one. I used crumbled herb feta and added more cayenne to the mayo. Extra lime wedges helped also. Definately a cookout favorite.

This was better than it sounded, and it was so easy to make. Used feta cheese and at least doubled the cayenne pepper. Between the lime and the mayonnaise it ends up being a slightly sweet dish. Yum!

I used feta with basil instead of the cotja (it was in the refrigerator) and everyone raved over the corn. Messy indeed but my guests quibbled over who would take the extra ears home.

Wow! Simply delicious. At first I was a bit skeptical about this, since I don't particularly like mayonnaise. But now I have reason to use that tiny jar of Best Foods. I don't think I'll ever go back to butter. Note: I did add more than the specified amount of cayenne.

I was recently given a version of this recipe that used mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce and parmesan cheese (the dry stuff). I was initially leery, but after having devoured three ears of corn in record time, I can tell you that this will be the best corn on the cob you have ever tried.
