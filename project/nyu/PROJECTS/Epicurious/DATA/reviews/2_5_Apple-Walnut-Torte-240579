Sorry to say, this wasn't anything special. And I had such high hopes, since I LOVE apple-caramel ANYTHING! Don't bother...

I love the flavors of this cake. I've made it twice now. The first time, I barely brushed the apples with apple jelly at the end and the textures were all lovely. The second time, I used all the apple jelly called for in the recipe and it made the cake mushy. In future, I'll completely omit the apple jelly because I don't see that it adds anything. It does seem that the cake needs to cook a little longer than called for, but I'm at 5000ft elevation and always have to fiddle with cooking times and/or temps

First, this is very bland - the spices need to be tripled. And after baking for 55 minutes, it was still not done - yes, my oven temp was correct.

Though I think it is a great combination of flavors, I would not make this again. The apples turned to mush, which was not a big problem, but then they sank into the cake, making for a poor presentation. Worse, the cake seemed condensed, perhaps the result of the weight of the apples. I would NOT make this again.

My family and guests really enjoyed this cake. Perfect end for an Autumn Sunday night dinner. I used a 10" springform form pan which worked great. Other than that followed the recipe exactly. Be sure to let carmel darken to a rich brown color. I will definitely make again.

I made this for a dinner party and loved it but didn't do a good job of carmelizing the apples properly - they kind of turned to applesauce but it was lovely. Made a carmel ice cream to go along with (and disguise that the apples had gotten mushy.)

I made this torte last week with a variety of apples but didn't use a sauce for the finish. The torte had a delicious flavor but I thought the torte without the apples was rather dry and I followed the recipe. Many steps to this recipe and I probably won't make this again. Carole Miller

There where a lot of steps and pans for a rather mediocre result. There are far easier and tastier recipes for a Fall apple dessert.

I thought this was delightful. I served it as an afternoon treat on a nice sunny fall Sunday afternoon. I did not make the Calva cream, and also omitted the apple jelly. It did not need any further dressing. The deliciously caramelized apples (I cooked them longer than the recipe called for) were a perfect contrast to the nutty and moist cake. Nothing extraordinary, just very very nice. Everybody asked for seconds as well as for the recipe.

Made this for a birthday and was very happy with it. You need to use good quality cooking apples that will hold their shape and let their flavor come through. The Calvados cream needed a little more sugar than two teaspoons as the calvados tends to dominate the flavor of the cream.

As an experienced cook I find this recipe a disappointment. It is time-consuming and not at all special. My husband would rather have a Dutch apple pie.

Made this today for a dinner party. Very good. Turned out just like the picture. The texture of the cake is wonderful. Only took 45 minutes to bake. No matter what the weight, you need 4 apples, halved, to fill the 9" pan. 7 halves around the sides and one in the middle. Couldn't find apple brandy so I subbed cinnamon cream. 1 cup heavy cream, 2 T sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon. Very nice, rustic fall dessert. Will make again.
