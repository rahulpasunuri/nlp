I baked this in a hollowed-out 12-pound pumpkin and it was delicious. My pumpkin could only hold half this recipe, and even that half was enough for 18-20 people as a side-dish, so it makes a LOT. I used fresh sage, didn't have any marjoram, substituted vegetable broth, and excluded the eggs all together but baking it in a pumpkin kept it nice and moist and gave it a delicious earthiness. I might even be able to use the same pumpkin to bake the 2nd half of the recipe!

Unfortunately, I was delegated the task of cooking this year's stuffing, which is the one Thanksgiving food I can't stand. However, this recipe proved me wrong! We subbed veg broth for the chicken and added toasted pine nuts, along with a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and it was heavenly. Turned out really moist, too! It serves way more than indicated though.

Easy to prepare. One of the most delicious and versitile stuffings ever!!! It freezes well, and i like to keep it on hand through the winter months.

this has been a thanksgiving fixture in my house since 2000--when it was first published in bon apetit. it always gets rave reviews--and while it is indeed labor intensive, it is well worth it.

I thought this was perfect; moist, nutty, tart, savory and the sage aroma...when eating this stuffing I forgot that this recipe is essentially meatless. Delicious!

I made this recipe when it was first published, I thought it had a great flavor but was just a tad dry. I made it again but added an extra egg, 1 cup cream, 1 cup Medium-Dry Sherry, 1 cube butter and 1 lb. Chorizo Seco. Use good quality Chorizo. I like Chorizo Seco, which is a dry Chorizo. You can usually find it hanging in the back counter of a Mexican Butcher shop.

Different but delicious. Yes it made a generous amount (maybe not tons extra), but Thanksgiving leftovers are at least half the fun. Next day I'm to tired to do anything but heat them up.

OK. I had my doubts. Apricots? No more doubts. This dressing will earn a permanent place in my recipe file. The only change I will make is to reduce the amount. I think Bon Appetit meant it would feed ten linebackers. There was enough here for the dish specified in the recipe and a smaller 9x9 dish (which a relative quickly volunteered to take home with her.)

Although quite labor intensive, this is a most unusual and delicious dressing, and the corn bread and pumpkin seeds most certainly enhance it. I made the corn bread in advance, froze it, then thawed it when ready to prepare the actual recipe. The previous reviewer was actually quite right when they said that it makes a ton of dressing, so be well advised if you're thinking about making more than what the recipe "as is" calls for!

Every year I can count on Bon Appetit to enhance my Thanksgiving dinner and it did again this year. This stuffing was really good. Be warned though -- the recipe makes a ton of stuffing! The cornbread recipe is fantastic and I'll definitely make it again on its own. I used a bit less of the dried apricots called for and it seemed like enough.
