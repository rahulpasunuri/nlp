My favourite make-ahead chocolate cake. Make sure not to over-bake it - it should be a little squidgy in the centre. I never bother with the sauce; instead, I just dust it with icing sugar and serve it with raspberries or other seasonal fruit. Also great with creme anglaise or vanilla ice cream.

As kmfortier wrote in an earlier post, you can make the sauce the day before. However, I would take the peel out of it, I found it was a little too bitter and made a second fresh batch that I liked better. I baked some of the peel that had soaked overnight at 350F for about 5 minutes and used the candied peel as a nice garnish!

Had to bake the cake in a 10" springform for 1 hr 35 min instead of 1 hr indicated. I use an oven thermometer so I was surprised it too this long. Recipe was fine otherwise.

The cake turned out well and was easier than you might think. My sauce also turned out very thin (even when chilled) but the taste was good.

This is the only chocolate cake I bother to make. It's foolproof and delicous every time.

I bake this cake all the time. It's great for dinner parties since it's best made the night before so the flavors develop. I always make the sauce--well worth the extra 10 minutes of cook and prep (you can also make the sauce the day before too).

I took this to my work Christmas party, and it was a hit! Several people (the good cooks) asked for the recipe. I wanted to say that this is a great high-altitude cake because it's supposed to deflate :). I also used 70% cacao chocolate, which worked fine. And I added two teaspoons of Grand Marnier to the the sauce to make it a little more sophisticated. Will definitely be making this again.

I don't bake but this cake is foolproof and delicous. I don't bother with the sauce but serve it dusted with icing sugar and whipped cream. I use Lindt 70% which works beautifully!

I thought the cake was fine. I can't buy Chocolate less than 70% here in Japan, but it turned out just fine regardless. Also, I don't have a springform pan here, and did it in a non stick lined brownie pan with no problems. My problem was with the "sauce". It was liquid, never thickened. I melted another 1/2 cup of sugar, and added in the first attempt, and this was maybe 20% better, but certainly not good enough to serve to guests. I whipped some cream, and drizzled the sauce over the cream. The recipe fails to mention if you cook the sugar to hard ball, soft ball, or gives a temperature guideline. Important when cooking sugar.

My wife loves this recipe. It is her favorite dessert. She doesn't bake so I am the one making it in our home. I do not bother with the glaze. I always serve it with freshly whipped cream and most often whip up a batch of raspberry or strawberry coulee too cut through the sweetness. When I want something I make this souflee for my honey and she's putty in my hands!!!

Though I am not a great baker, I found great success with this cake. I used Lindt semi-sweet bars that I found at the grocery store and thought they provided terrific flavor. It was rich and chocolatey but not so much that you couldn't enjoy more than one bite. It looks beautiful and rustic, too. I thought the sauce had good flavor but wasn't necessarily worth the hassle. My guests preferred the cake by itself. For a special occasion I might serve it with a ganache instead.

To the cook who used unsweetened chocolate: Bittersweet is sweetened chocolate; the name simply means that it's close to dark chocolate. Usually, you can find it in bars in the same place as the unsweetened bars and chocolate chips.

The cakes looks great but I used unsweeten chocolate since I couldn't fine bittersweet. I looked at the next recipe in the list and it says not to use unsweeten. I will make again but with semi-sweet??
