Thank you for all your comments, so helpful. We used one 3/4 lb gorgeous grassfed rib eye for two and doubled the sauce. It was perfection! Served up a 2000 cab and we were in heaven.

I agree that there was not enough sauce for the meat. I added shallot to the sauce and used brandy. There are other au poivre recipes I prefer, but I do enjoy the addition of fennel.

Fantastic recipe, my b/f loved it... the peppers formed a crust around the steak which was a really nice contrast. Used brandy instead of cognac and turned out great!

I simply don't understand all of the rave reviews on this one. Not so special. Sure, it's simple, but cooking a steak is almost always simple. Keep on searching for a better steak au poivre....

Make more sauce than this recipe notes, and don't worry so much about the fennel. Basically its a steak in a peppercorn-cream-brandy sauce, and what's not to like about that? Easy to make, hard to mess up.

As easy as it is delicious. I followed the suggestions of many others and tripled the amount of sauce (and it still wasn't enough). The fennel gave it a very nice and unusal taste and it was a huge hit.

This is a delicious recipe that is always a crowd pleaser. As others have said, there is never enough sauce with the recipe as-is. For each diner, I use two ounces of light cream, 1.5 ounces of beef broth, and an ounce of cognac. A little cornstarch also does wonders and creates a very thick sauce after it has been reduced by about a third. (A tip: make sure that you add the cognac first...not only is it the best de-glazer, but not all of the alcohol will cook out if added later.) I made this with some 8oz NY strips and they were plenty big once the rich sauce was added. This is the best recipe that I've found for this classic dish...definitely added to my permanent rotation.

I rarely give a four fork rating, but my husband said our meal last night was as good as any 5 star Manhattan resturant (we lived there, he knows). I used an adjustible peppermill to crack the peppercorns, used a whole filet, which I tied, then rolled in the pepper. I omited the fennel. Seared it on the stove and finished in the oven to 125F, perfectly cooked. While the meat was resting, I sauteed some shittake mushrooms, deglazed with the congac and cream, then enriched with a big spoonful of homemade demi-glace. Served with homemade rosemary foccacia and a light salad. It turned out very well. I used the left over foccacia and some of the meat to make my husbands lunch, a sandwich with thinly sliced tenderloin, pesto, arugula and shaved parmesean. He said that was fabulous too!

We tried this using some of the suggestions of other reviewers, namely doubline the sauce and adding melted stilton. Both changes were good ones. The doubled sauce was more than enough, but it went quite quickly with a baguette! A couple things that others have not mentioned: the skillet pepper crushing technique didn't work at all, nor did a mortar and pestle. An andjustable pepper mill did the trick. Also, when frying the steaks, the room filled with peppery smoke. This was not a problem per se, but something to watch out for if you have sensitive fire alarms...

Very quick and easy and impressive! Great for a weeknight dinner!

This is quick and easy, but delicious. It's great if you want to impress someone or even if you're just in the mood for a good dinner. Try beef tenderloin for best result.

Yum, Yum, Yum! So easy to prepare! I added half a quart of sliced fresh mushrooms before I deglazed the pan with my airline sized bottle brandy. I too used light cream. I had expected the concoction to be more carmelized but wasn't disappointed after tasting my first bite. Next time, I'll use a petite filet.

Show of hands. Who likes me?

We love this easy to make recipe, so I have made it several times. It definitely benefits from more sauce, so I double the cream and brandy. I also subsitute light cream for heavy cream. We enjoyed our steak with the crisp rosemary potatoes and some steamed asparagus. Fast and delicious!

Have made this with and without the fennel seeds, and liked both versions. If you leave out the seeds, use more peppercorns.Any variety of peppercorns can be used too.Definitely make extra sauce if you like to soak it up with bread,potatoes,rice,etc.

Rating: 3
I agree with the previous reviewer that this version of steak au poivre beats the twisty-turny "Cook's Illustrated" without much (if any)sacrifice in flavor. The only ingredient I questioned was the fennel. Since I enjoy the taste of fennel, I tried it, but I won't use it again. Other than that, easy, satisfying cold-weather food.

My husband and I loved this recipe. If you like sauce I would double if not triple the sauce portion. We will make this again in the very near future

Rating: 3
This quick and easy recipe beats the intricate Cook's Illustrated version if your in a hurry; only takes 25 minutes from start to finish. Go easy on the peppercorns if you use all black. I also suggest doubling the sauce recipe if you like enough to cover the steaks. Serve it with Yukon Gold lumpy mashed potatoes for a complimentary starch; creamy flavor smooths sharpness from peppered steak. Enjoy!

This is delicious and so easy. I used butter instead of oil (with a dish this rich, calories don't seem so important). You can keep the steak warm in a pre-warmed oven while you make the sauce. I didn't use the fennel, but I did throw some tarragon in with the cognac and cream and then garnished with fresh chives. Perfect!

Be sure to let the sauce thicken properly...on my first try the sauce was thin and not bold enough. Liberal use of salt is recommended.

Rating: 4
Awesome recipe. To the reviewer 6/23...you probably should cook nothing more complicated than spaghettios.

Rating: 4
this is a classic dish. There is no reason to add the fennel or any other ingredient, for then it becomes a totally different dish with a different name. To increase sauce, add a little beef stock. Reduce and then add the Cognac and cream. I always am begged to make this dish!

The whole family loves this recipe. We like it better with Cognac than Brandy. Very easy to make. I also double the sauce.

Rave reviews from the whole family for Valentines Dinner. Doubled all ingredients except the fennel and veg. oil and it was great - next time I'll triple the cream and brandy to make sure we have plenty of the sauce (it's not gravy!)

Made this and then threw a dallop of butter and a large dallop of Stilton in the frying pan and melted them together and threw it on top of the steak. This was to die for! It is also extreemly self indulgent and in no way low cal but that is what makes life worth living. B.P. Gill

Pretty boring, I must say. I hate fennel, so I left out that, but otherwise all I had was a too-peppery steak in a tasteless sauce. I've definitely made better wine sauces for steak, either made-up or from this site--this recipe will not be a keeper.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, I usually make this for my husband's birthday. This year I'm making it for 8 adults. Any suggestions on increasing the sauce would be helpful.

Rating: 3
very easy! from start to finish, the whole thing only took 10 minutes. I just used black peppercorns and some salt- all the other flavor comes from the sauce. I found that the cream and cognac needed to be doubled for the right amount of sauce, And there is no reason to drain the pan before adding them

Rating: 4
Great flavour. Very nice for company. I would definitely make this again.

Thumbs up except not enough gravy. Maybe if I went to cooking school I could find out how to stretch what little gravy there is. Very quick and especially good if you like pepper. I also substituted red wine for the cognac with good results.

my husband has been making a similar steak au poivre dish for years - the recipe we have is from a 1980's gourmet - do you have that recipe in the archive? I can't find our copy.

Very simple and delicious. Would skip the fennel the next time though.

The fennel was a nice addition to a great dish, it really added another layer flavor
