You must first parboil a stinging nettle to remove the formic acid which causes the sting. (This is the same toxin that ants release when they sting). Once parboiled the stinging nettles have a consistancy of sauteed spinach, a flavor like a sweet pea and a glorious bright, deep, green color. They are well worth the extra work, but make sure to boil a stinging nettle!!

A question really....the farmer's market where I got the nettles called them "stinging" nettles and said they need to be boiled awhile to avoid the sting. Is this the same type of nettles used here?

This was absolutely divine! The first time I made this I just put the pesto over some whole wheat penne and had some sauteed romain with it. My boyfriend LOVED it! I don't live where nettles are available so I just used extra arugula. The second time was for a New Year's party and I used whole wheat rolls sliced up and also added a sliver of roasted red pepper on each one...I got rave reviews...from engineers in my fam who are very particular about their food. Oh, one suggestion is that you roast the garlic before you add it...that way you have a sweet garlic flavor istead of a "Oh crap that's strong" garlic flavor! Make this...you'll LOVE it!

Yummy! Finally a good recipe for nettle. I had to add water to get it to puree in the blender.
