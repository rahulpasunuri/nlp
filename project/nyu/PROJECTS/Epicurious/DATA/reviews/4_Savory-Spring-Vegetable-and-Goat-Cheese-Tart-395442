This was a great Easter dish. It is quite rich and I think as an appetizer for small bits could work better. My tart pan was a true french tart pan and only 2 eggs were needed and I omitted the tarragon. My grocery store ran out of creme fraiche so I thought to sub Mexican table crema instead... which worked excellent. My family was impressed :) I would make it again and maybe experiment with another veggie besides asparagus... although it was quite nice

I ended up only using 2 eggs instead of 3 since I ran out of room in the pan, but it still held together nicely. Flavor was amazing. Easy to make. Total crowd pleaser!

I was able to find asparagus and made this. It was fantastic! Got rave reviews. I did not have tarragon so left it out. Creme fraiche is not available here so I found out online how to make it (1 tbsp sour cream added to one cup heavy cream, leave out overnight, at least 9 hrs, then refrigerate 4 hrs before using.) I followed one reviewer's advice and looked for a recipe for tart dough, and found a fantastic recipe here: http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2009/05/french-tart-dough-a-la-francaise/. Unfortunately I didn't realize until later that it was for sweet tarts, and had used the full tbsp of sugar. Later I read that a tsp would have been better. In any case it was an amazing crust and I highly recommend it (with 1 tsp sugar.) Would absolutely make this again.

My vegetarian sister and I made this for a brunch at our place and everyone loved it. As always, we were rushed toward the end of our preparations and this actually came together in a snap (with a few shortcuts)! Can't wait to make it again!

I really want to make this but asparagus are now out of season (I live in Italy and things really are very seasonal here...no asparagus in sight!) Any suggestions, has anyone substituted something else, like snap peas, maybe chopped red peppers, or as one reviewer suggested, sauteed mushrooms? I gave it four forks because I can tell it's going to be fabulous!

I have to wade in on Gym's comments. All those "healthy" foods stripped of their natural structure are probably worse for you than anything else. Natural foods are good for you, and dare I say that even BUTTER in its natural form is healthier than margarine! Obesity comes from eating the entire tart! Killjoys who preach their unpalatable puritanical recipes as some form of virtue could learn to live a little. Balance in all things etc!

Pretty good! I would make it again, but i would probably cover the top of the crust with tinfoil or not prebake the crust for as long because it started to burn.

This recipe is fantastic. It got rave reviews when I made it. I did not use a store bought crust though, I made my own crust using a recipe (Tart Dough) from a french cook book. Either way, this filling is fantastic. Yes, it is high in fat, but like everything else, it must be eaten in moderation. Serve with a nice green salad on the side et Voila! I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely divine. Made a tart shell at home and it turned out amazing. Excellent balance of flavors.

I absolutely agree with everyone who has taken "gym" to task. Epicurious should provide a forum for those who ALWAYS alter the recipes and then give one fork! I have made this 3 times to rave reviews. I served it twice as an appetizer/first course, so the servings were small. I just made another for a friend to serve at HER party. Excellent use of seasonal and fresh ingredients. The creme fraiche adds a nice tang. I used a scant 1/2 t. of salt and thought it was plenty. I did make a whole wheat crust and it added some sweetness to the taste. Definitely a keeper! I will make it all summer...

Love the combination of flavors and textures -- the crunch of the sauteed asparagus against the creaminess of the cheese mixture. The goat cheese and creme fraiche give it just enough tang to make it interesting, and the herbs give it a nice fresh flavor. It would probably be good with some sauteed mushrooms, too. This is easy, very tasty, and I would make again.

Very good, it really does taste like spring! I wish the author would have given suggested amounts of salt and pepper, as it's quite difficult to season a raw egg mixture to taste, and I felt mine could have used more salt.

I didn't have enough asparagus, so I added some wilted spinach. It was not nearly as rich as I thought it would be, but it was oh, so delicious! Sadly, I let Mom take home the leftovers!

i added some lemon zest with the herbs. i also scattered chive flowers on the top. the lavender flowers were very pretty with the dark green roasted asparagus tips against the pale yellow egg mixture.

This is a great recipe and I couldn't agree more with all the others railing against "gym" for the quite unnecessary comments. If you'd like to share your tweaks of a given recipe, fine, in the meantime please get off your high horse! This isn't the "Biggest Loser" site, it's Epicurious, deal with it.

Thank you Gym for the advice on what to feed my active 18 month old. I would much rather feed my daughter small portions of a recipe like this once in a while, than to serve her processed foods with added flavor and coloring. So I will make a deal with you, if you don't critique my food choices, I won't critique you for your choice of eating (or feeding to a child)egg substitute.

Unless you don't possess the ability to think for yourself, making changes to any classic great recipe to suit your own particular need, shouldn't be too much of a challenge. A health conscious cook from CA

I tried this the other night, didn't have spring onions, used scallions instead and roasted everything together. The scallions were too stringy so roasted up some shallots, was really good. I didn't use cream, lactose intolerant but soy creamer was fine also added a bit of gruyere cheese. Good easy recipe.

It's getting really tiresome to read the self-righteous posts of people who feel the need to monitor the diets of complete strangers. I'm sure you're perfect in every way, gym, but that doesn't confer on you the authority to tell the rest of us what you think we should be doing.

Amen! PC Food Police go away.....we are not stupid nor are we children. Eat your own garbage or check out the food police mags/websites. Thank you.

And to think I threw away your invitation to brunch. What ever was I thinking?? Hey, I am a foodie, and *I* would quibble over your changes. This is a foodie site, and this recipe is a keeper! Change it for yourself, and enjoy if you can, but no need to get snarky with Epicurious. After all, YOU subscribe to THEM, not vice versa.

Little bit annoying when I am looking to my fellow foodies for a review of the flavor of a certain recipe and I get the fat police instead. If you don't like the recipe or it doesn't fit your lifestyle, DON'T MAKE IT, or make it with your own low-fat modifications and share it with us. But getting irritated with Epicurious for having the AUDACITY to print it and accusing the website of promoting obesity is completely ludicrous.

Oof! C'mon Epicurious - are you trying to encourage obesity and heart attacks in honor of Mother's Day? No way should an 18-month-old, much less an 38-year-old (unless a gym rat), be eating something this rich! It would have been so easy to make this a HEALTHY dish...whole wheat crust, more veg, egg substitute, low-fat/nonfat dairy products. With fresh herbs, no foodie would quibble over the changes.

This was so good. The only thing I changed was to use sour cream for the creme fraiche because I didn't have any on hand. My 18 month old wanted seconds. Don't plan on having leftovers.

Yummy flavors especially the tarragon. Easy to assemble. Couldn't find spring onions,maybe should have been in the April edition! Making again for my foodies friends tomorrow for brunch:)
