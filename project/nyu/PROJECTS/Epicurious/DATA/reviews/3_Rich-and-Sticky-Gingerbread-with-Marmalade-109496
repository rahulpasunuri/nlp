This caje is less than okay, unless you are a real fan of molasses. I used a delicious home-made orange and ginger marmalade to no avail. The cake was dry, the molasses overwhelming. It has nothing to recommend it.

Very good gingerbread. It took more like 50 minutes to bake than the 38 specified. A cream cheese icing with a bit of lemon was good on top. It's a nice change from the darker gingerbread I usually make.

Sounds great, but it's only OK.

If you love ginger this recipe is for you. I've made it 2x's this past week for work and friends and everyone's loved it. It has the perfect amount of ginger. A lot. And best of all, it's quick and easy.

Wonderful gingerbread, and very moist. We even spread some additional marmalade on the gingerbread when we were eating it. I used the size pan listed in the recipe, but it took just shy of an hour to bake. Sealed tight, the gingerbread stayed soft and fresh for over a week.

It was ok, but I think I prefer a more traditional gingerbread. If I made it again (although I probably won't), I'd leave out the raisins and double the crystallized ginger

I made this as soon as it appeared as gingerbread and marmalade are two of my favourite tastes. It turned out excellent although I used the specified tin size and it took more like 50 minutes to cook. I'll definitely make it again - although I will probably leave out the raisins, they seemed a little superfluous. Not as dark as some gingerbread recipes (which I also like) but very very good.
