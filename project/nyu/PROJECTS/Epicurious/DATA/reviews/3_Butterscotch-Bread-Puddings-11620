I ended up using skim milk instead of half and half, and the result was very buttery and custardy. I thought it was a little too sweet served hot, but served cold it's absolutely delicious.

This was easy and delicious. Yields a silky custard and crisp surface. I let the puddings stand for about and hour before cooking while I finished preparing dinner. I also cooked them for about 35-40 minutes to achieve 'puffed and golden'. I will decrease the sugar next time. It was a bit too sweet when served topped with vanilla ice cream.

try adding a couple of slices of banana and a few raisins.. Steps the dish up nicely.

These bread puddings were terrible. Didn't taste the least bit like butterscotch--more just like soggy bread.

This dessert is very easy to make and very tasty. Great for company!
