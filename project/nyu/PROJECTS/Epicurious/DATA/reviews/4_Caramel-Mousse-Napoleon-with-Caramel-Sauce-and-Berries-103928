Served this at a dinner party and it was definitely a hit. I thought I was watching the caramel syrup closely but apparently not closely enough since I scorched it and had to start over. But it was worth it. The only change I made was, instead of putting 1 cup of the mousse on each pastry sheet I just divided the mouse into three portions. This turned out to be a bit more than 1 c. per sheet, but just added to the yumminess!

I've been making it for years, it's one of my "show stopper" desserts that always gets raves. It's to die for. Lots of caramel sauce left, keep it for ice cream or apple pie. You won't complain : )

I made this decadent cake many times for birthdays... It was a special request from my kids! Delicious, tasty, and OH SO SWEET! This tasty cake is also very easy to make, especially for me who's not a baker.

Outstanding and I though easy to make, you need time however. I would suggest omitting the sugar to the layers except for the layer you would use for the top and only for appearance. With the sugar it was a little too sweet. Very impressive dessert.

Everyone loved this dessert! I did have a lot of caramel sauce left over, but it was sinfully delicious to eat on its own. Lots of requests for me to make it again.

I made this dessert for a Valentine's Day fundraiser for a local food bank. It got rave reviews! The caramel mousse was divine - however when combining the cooled geletin mix with the whipped cream, the mixture split on me. Chilling until set and whipping vigorously fixed the problem. In the future,I would fold the whipped cream into the geletin mixture. Delicious!

I made the mousse only -- very very tasty, but wayyy too much butter! The caramel sauce was greasy, which in turn made the mousse taste more like buttercream icing. I lightened it up a little by folding some stiffly whipped egg whites in.. also, I think there's too much gelatin in the recipe... it was a bit gooey. but the flavor -- amazing! When I make it again I'll try just a pat of butter in the sauce, 3/4 packet of gelatin and half cream/half eggwhites for the mousse.

When I made it for my friend's bridal shower, everyone was amazed and loved it. It looked grand and tasted fantastic. I would definitely make it again, but only for special occasions because I found that it takes quite a bit of time and effort.

This is a fine recipe. I woefully mishandled the puff pastry sheets, getting them too browned and then breaking them to boot, but the recipe and its presentation are very forgiving. For my taste (and I never thought I would say this), it's caramel overkill. This dish should be called "death by caramel" - if that sounds good to you, go for it! I may borrow Jan from North Platte's suggestion about serving the mousse alone, though....

I made this and everyone thought it was great. A word of advice: when you fold the carmel into the whipped cream, make sure you really incorporate it well. I folded the two together and then left the assembly for the next day(probably a bad idea), I had big clumps of carmel that I had to re-whip out.Even making this mistake, it was a special dessert.

This was to die for. I'm mystified by the reviewer whose guests complained it was messy and didn't eat it! My guests were swooning, as was I. I served it with a drizzle of bittersweet chocolate sauce (as well as the caramel) on the plates, and some slices of pears sauteed with a little butter and finished with armagnac. I, who possess the dubious gift of being able to find something wrong with nearly everything, thought this was perfect.

This recipe is delicious, although it is rich it is refreshing. In my town, I could purchase only the puff pastry shells and not the sheets, and I loved the results. I had left over mousse so I used an ice cream scoop, scooped the mousse onto wax paper (ball shape) and froze it for two weeks. To serve, since I didn't have any caramel sauce left over, I used Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Ice Cream topping, wonderful.

I was excited to try this recipe, but disappointed in the final product. The overall taste was too sweet and a bit too difficult to eat. My guests left large amounts on their plates and complained of the mess from the puff pastry. The mousse was delicious and next time I'll serve a small scoop of mousse accompanied by fruit

I made this for a French recipe party, and the guests were amazed when we unveiled this dessert. Sinfully delicious... I will definitely make it again!

For my 9th grade English project I had to make some French recipes. Everyone thought this was absolutely beautiful. The caramel taste was wonderful, but it crumbled as it got softer.

Delicious! It takes sometime to prepare but really not difficult. A little tip, if I may share, when cooling down the gelatin-caramel mixture, stir it occasionally. Our kitchen was so cold, what happen was the gelatin-caramel mixture formed a skin on top and made the cooled mixture a bit lumpy. Other than that, it was yummy!

My husband has made this twice and it is absolutely the most delicious dessert I have ever had. Guests are totally impressed and even though the recipe provides a generous amount of the dessert - there are rarely leftovers. The first time my husband made this it was all gone before he'd even had a chance to sample it himself!!

Delicious and easy too!! I was a little intimidated at first but this recipe was really simple. The gelatin really firms up the whipped cream so that it is easy to work with - this also helped the presentation so that there was not whipped cream oozing everywhere. I had to cook my caramel for much longer than the recipe called for but the color picture in the magazine makes it fool-proof. I am using this as a show stopper for my holiday party!!
