Awesome! I made this with the Spicy Rice and Kale. I basically followed the shrimp recipe and it was perfect.

I like Questhaven's cumin suggestion. Also, I'd suggest adding a small amount of lime juice to the tomatillo salsa and/or the avocado/watercress mix.

Yum! This was a surprising and original twist on seafood tacos. I guess you could say it's inspired by Cajun and Baja cuisine without really resembling either one. I'd just suggest using a little red pepper and/or Cajun seasoning mix in the shrimp mixture to round out the flavor.

Loved this recipe and think it's great for an easy weeknight dinner. I did a few things differently from the recipe though. We didn't make the chili sour cream and I used bottled tomatillo salsa. I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin to the spices for the shrimp, let spice rub sit for a few hours on the shrimp prior to making the dish, and also used flour tortillas instead of hard taco shells. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly! ;) This recipe is going to be a regular at our house!

This was so yummy and really easy! Made with Cuban Black Beans (the recipe on the back of the black bean can) - amazing! I only gave it 3 forks because I didn't think the tomatillo salsa was anything special.

Terrific combo with the tomatillo salsa. Added a teaspoon of cumin to the rub (let sit for an hour+ based on another review) and used soft flour and corn tortillas instead of taco shells (I don't think hard shells would work with this nearly as well). Everyone loved it. Also chopped up some cilantro to add to it - wasn't necessary with all the other flavors.

I love the idea of the recipe, and have modified significantly. First for the sour cream I just add half a package of taco seasoning. It may be cheating, but it is always a fan favorite. Next, for the shrimp I use Emeril's essence (you will have to search the web for this spice recipe). The tomatillo is awesome. All in all the flavour is excellent. Enjoy!

Excellent recipe! It was a huge crowd-pleaser. It's especially good with a mango salsa. I recommend marinating the shrimp in paprika, chili powder etc. for an hour before cooking rather than 5 mins.

I love this recipie and have added it to the family cookbook. I don't like the watercress, so leave that out, and my favorite salsa to use with this is a spicy pineapple salsa.

This was really good and easy for a weeknight! I did make a couple changes, though. I added the garlic to the shrimp, along with a little lime juice and Tony Chachere's seasoning and let it sit for longer than 5 minutes. I also added lime juice and Tony's seasoning to the sour cream. It was SO yummy!

These were terrific. As I said in my review of the tomatillo salsa, I was skeptical (apples???) until I tried it, and it really does work. Only changes I made were to serve these as soft tacos with corn tortillas, and made guacamole instead of just sliced avocados.

We loved this and continue to make our sour cream according to this recipe for all of our mexican dishes. Yum!

it was yummy. my boyfriend is a fiend for shrimp and he absolutely devoured these. i'm ambivalent about shrimp but i thought they were really good.

I made this a weeknight supper and added 1/2 tspn of ground coriander based on a couple of "bland/boring" reviews. I also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream. Used fresh tomato salsa, added guacamole and fresh tomatillos. Corn tortillas cooked over an open flame. The results were very good and we will add this to our "quick weeknight" supper repertoire.

I substituted pan fried chicken breast for the shrimp (I couldnt find a taco recipe with chicken). I accompanied it with guacamole and used yogurt instead of the sourcream. Quite tasty.

We used yogurt instead of sour cream.

The shrimp and sour cream were terrific. We served it with steamed corn tortillas rather than hard shells, and made a basic pico de gallo instead of the tomatillo salsa. Delish! Perfect for a gloomy March night when you'd give anything to be on the beach. Don't forget the Corona with lime!

This dinner is designed for families accustomed to spicy food. I know that sounds simplistic, but I've made it twice. Kids vs no Kids. Mine balked at the pepper but the wifey and I loved it. Marinate for intense flavor to those not satisifed with the follow up taste. I used those 'U" shaped weber.com kabob holders with great success (no more shrinps spinning on a single pole skewer.) Other than that, med heat, 3 to 4 mins /side depending. Fresh Ceaser's salad (also on this site) works well with this and, of course,a good Sonoma wine. Enjoy!

THis dish was left wanting. It looked great. a few were worried about eating such red shrimp, but really there was little flavor. It was okay but with such great color and smells we were all of us let down.

My husband made this for me for dinner as a surprise when I had to work one Saturday. As I entered the house, it smelled sooooooooo gooooood!! It tasted spectacular. Even my daughter, who has refused to eat shrimp at restaurants, ate hers and asked for another.

I made this recipe exactly as it was listed, and it was SO good. When I was putting it together, I was a little apprehensive about the unlikely mix of ingredients, but it was absolutely perfect. This makes a great dish for casual entertaining. It looked and tasted great.

Very good version of an old standby. On second version I took the oil and garlic, tossed in a bit of butter, whisked in the shrimp seasonings and cooked the shrimp on skewers over a mesquite fire brushing shrimp with the butter mixture. The presentation, fresh off the grill,on the greens dressed with with avacado wedges. Very nice. A bottle of Veuve Cliquot along side and tuck me in for the night !

I'll be making this recipe for the 3rd time. It's so easy and good.

fantastic taste for such an easy dish to make. if you like spice add a bit more cayenne and chili powder to the shrimp. As recommended from another chef below the flour tortillas were perfect. ps- try the two bean corn salad as a side

This was a very easy recipe. Next time I will make it with just Cajun seasoning instead of the paprika, etc. LOve it.

I followed one reviewer's advice and mixed tomatillo salsa with sour cream and avocado for the sauce. When cooking the shrimp, I just sauteed with garlic and salt and pepper. My husband really liked this - he said I can make this again! As modified, it was super easy and not too spicy.

I enjoyed this recipe - for those with sensitive stomachs, I seasoned the shrimp with just a dash of salt, some pepper & garlic. I used a 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 avocado and 1/4 cup of tomatillo salsa and put in blender til creamy, and then spread on shrimp in taco shells- for guests that want to kick it up a notch have a side dish with just tomatillo salsa.

This was a hit at home. We used flour tortillas, and it was great. Also, the salsa was delicious--the flavors were all a great blend.

Very good dish. I used the recipe for the "essential tomato-serrrano salsa" instead. It was very hot. I skipped the chili in the sour cream because the salsa was so hot. Easy to make, good to eat, definitely a keeper.

This immediately became one of my family's favorite dishes. I use flour tortillas because we prefer them. I have made this with frozen uncooked shrimp as well as fresh. Both work very well. A teenage friend from Mexico took the recipe home with her. I know everyone will be home for dinner if I'm making this.

I served this for a buffet supper on the deck, and it was a major hit! Made it with the accompanying sides, but used fresh corn tortillas (yum!) rather than the shells suggested in the recipe (ugh). Very easy and tasty!

Fabulous. I offered both soft and hard tacos. I think that both are delicous. I used prepared salsa (red/green)along with the sour cream and avacodos. This was hit and I will make this again. Easy for a casual party.

full-blooded cajun here who definitely enjoyed this recipe, of course b/c of the cayenne pepper. we also used soft tortillas and squeezed fresh lime juice onto the tacos after they were done. our guests liked them as well!

My husband and I agree this was delicious. We substituted soft tortillas and also used frozen precooked shrimp. After defrosting the shrimp thoroughly and seasoning them, we added them to the skillet just long enough to heat through. We'll definitely make this again.

Now who ever got the brilliant idea that cajuns would make tacos? It must have been some Emeril obsessed flake who had to slap the 'cajun' label on everything they made. This recipe stinks.

The chili sour cream and shrimp are great. The salsa seemed to be a bit mild.

This is a summertime favorite at our house. It is easy to make and you can use store-bought salsa verde to make it even faster. We will be making this one again soon!
