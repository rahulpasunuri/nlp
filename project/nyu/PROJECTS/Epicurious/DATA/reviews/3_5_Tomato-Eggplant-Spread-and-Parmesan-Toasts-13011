I have made this repeatedly since it first came out in Gourmet and every time, it's perfect. I always make it when the tomatoes are good in summer, and it's always a winner. Everyone wants the recipe. Cannot recommend it too highly.

After reading some of the other comments, I ended up seeding the tomatoes and then tossing them into the pan with the other veggies for a few minutes to evaporate some of the excess juice. I also pureed slightly in the food processor, since I was in the mood for something less chunky. I didn't have pine nuts, so I tossed in some almonds instead and I forgot to oil the bread, but I don't think we missed that. The overall flavor was very nice - we'll definitely be making this again as it's the first time we've actually enjoyed eggplant!

This was excellent when it was eaten with the parmesan toasts. I used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. I also used a little less lemon juice than called for and a little more sugar than called for. I think that the raw garlic added to the cooled eggplant is a must and I used dried herbs, adding them after the eggplant had softened a little on the stove. I didn't measure my ingredients, just did everything to taste so mine was not bland at all. Not something I would eat on it's own but it really was tasty when eaten with the toasts.

Not quite what I was expecting...more like a gazpacho, which is probably how I will serve the rest of it - most of it was left from a party, where nearly everything else disappeared.

Followed the recipe as written. (Did not take out all the seeds as another reviewer suggested - no bitter flavor in my batch.) Wow! So fresh. My boyfriend would take a bite, close his eyes and proclaim, "I'm trying to savor this flavor." - he's never done THAT before! Delicious.

Great recipe! The flavors came together really well. Rave reviews. The only thing I'd change is that I'd half the lemon juice next time. Otherwise, very tasty just as it is!

This was an excellent way to use some of the eggplants, tomatoes, onions and garlic from my garden! I, too, found it a little bland and added some ground cumin, which really enhanced the flavors. Took it to a party last night and it got rave reviews.

I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but last summer I joined a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) Farm and found myself with dozens of eggplants arriving at my door all summer. I gave away as many as I could, and turned to this recipe in desperation. I made it for a party and everyone (including me) absolutely loved it. I've made it several times since then--always with excellent results.

I feel badly about being the only voice of dissent, but this recipe disappointed me. It had all of my favorites in it, but I felt it really lacked flavor. Perhaps my vegetables weren't as ripe as they should have been, but I was disappointed.

This was a great lowfat recipe. I did reduce the oil significantly. My guests loved it and begged for the recipe. I also pureed the completed mixture in a blender befor adding the pine nuts so it was more like a spread or dip than a salsa. We loved it.

Love it! I have made this for 5 different crowds and got the same results...excellent!! I used plum tomatoes to cut back on the "liquid" and added cilantro for an extra kick of flavor. The only problem with this recipe is that I am asked to make it every time there is a party!

I was looking for a caponata recipe and this one seemed pretty easy. It tasted great! But a lot of liquid accumulated after I let it sit for an hour. Next time I would cut back on the olive oil a little and make sure the tomatoes aren't too watery after chopping them.

Delicious with the parmesan toasts, but this is also really good substituting cilantro for the basil, served with fresh Ak-Mak crackers. To my taste, this spread could be a bit less forthright so the eggplant's natural flavor can shine. I used only one cubed and seeded tomato, only 3 Tablesp pignolis toasted in a dry skillet(and added at the last minute so they stay whole), only 1/4 teasp sugar, only ONE Tablespoon of lemon juice and 4 Tablespoons olive oil. Also, instead of cooking the eggplant on the stove, I took the easy way out by roasting UNSKINNED baby eggplants in a 350F oven for 45 minutes until soft and wrinkly, then diced them and whirled them --plus the sauteed onion and garlic and seeded tomatoes-- in the food processor. If you use small eggplants they're never bitter.

Yummy! I made it several years ago and have been trying to re-create it ever since!

This is so delicious and easy. The parmesan toasts added a nice crispy contrast to the texture of the spread and would work well with other dips/spreads as well. I think I liked it better without the pine nuts.

We made this yesterday and absolutely loved it! The only suggestion I would make is to drain the tomatoes after chopping so that the spread is a little less "soupy". Wonderful, fresh flavors! We used both a delicious olive baguette and 3-seed baguette which adapted well to the recipe. Give it a try! KIMBER

This was delicious!!! I took made it for my mother's birthday and the electricity had gone out so my sister and her boyfriend, who don't like eggplant, were eating it and raving about it, unaware of what it was!!!!!! Everybody loved it and the the parmesan toasts were a big hit and delicious as well. It does make a lot though - much more that 3 cups and 1 baguette is not enough. Had some leftovers and it was even great the next day!!!!

I served this at a cocktail party and everyone loved it. I made the parmesan toasts - 1 baguette was not enough for this recipe. The first time I did the toasts they were very hard because of the 30 minute baking time. The second time I broiled one side of the toasts, turned them, sprinkled the parmesan on top and baked them at 325 for 15 minutes and they came out perfect.

This was a party favorite! I cheated and bought toasts from the store which worked out well.
