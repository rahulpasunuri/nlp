Wow, something went wrong on this, as the consistency was very grainy. I'm not sure if cooling the mousse completely had something to do with it. I will try again, though, as it looked very pretty with whipped cream on top and peppermint sprinkles.

Delicious recipe! Very easy yet impressive. My only advice would be to wait to sprinkle the extra candy over the top until just before you serve it - I did it earlier and it sort of melted and looked weird. Mini candy canes would make a great alternative garnish.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve dessert and it was a big hit. It's easy and I liked the fact that it didn't have the raw eggs most mousse has. It looked very pretty served in a champagne flute, garnised with a thin, rolled cookie and a mini-candy cane!
