I had some egg yolks from another recipe and this was a tasty way to use them. I made half the recipe and used some bit of vanilla extract and 3 yolks because that's what I had from the chocolate mousse... was delicious.

This recipe could be great if the rice amount was reduced to 1/2-3/4 cups. I have to make it a second time and play with the amounts that would make it great. I also added the sugar at the beginning, added liquid vanilla at the end since it was all I had on hand and tempered the egg yolks. I didn't want them to curdle.

Really creamy, simple and delicious! Canaroli rice and tangerine peel were the substitutions and my vanilla bean was a little old so I just broke up the whole bean and left it in there to simmer. I had to simmer more than 23 minutes but I think the rice I used is starchier. I halved the recipe exactly, but as it did not taste as sweet as I liked, I added slightly less than 1/4 cup more sugar at the end. I was surprised how rich it was for so few ingredients and it was very satisfying.
