Delicious! I treated this as a consomme for the first course of my Christmas feast. Followed the recipe almost to the letter, except I added fresh thin-sliced tarragon at the very end. The tarragon added a world of flavor! I highly recommend it. It really highlighted the flavor of the peas, they were jangly! Super good!

Very delicious, especially w/ homemade broth. Like others, I added some of the lemon's juice to the broth and some cream cheese to the filling.

This recipe is fabulous! I don't have a food mill, so I just used the food processor to chop the peas down a bit. The filling was still chunky, but that certainly didn't affect the flavour. I used half the amount of broth and it was plenty. I will be making this again - delicious!

A keeper! Instead of using a food mill, I blanched the peas and pureed them. More pea flavor. I added lemon zest to the filling. Since I added freshly cracked black pepper and lemon zest and garlic to the broth, I sieved it before pouring into bowls. I thought the broth wasn't very exciting so I added some lemon juice to it. Better. Gave it another level. I am serving this as my first course for my Christmas eve dinner. Can't wait for the raves. I'm going to use the same filling but make ravioli instead of won tons and serve with a light wine/lemon flavored white sauce. Sound yummy? Happy cooking!

for presentation at a recent party, i place three ravioli in each bowl, garnished with a very thin lemon slice, fresh chives and tarragon. i put this at each guest's setting, and then poured steaming broth over each bowl at the table. everyone was so excited by the drama of it all, and the ravioli look beautiful before the broth is added.

I made and rated the original recipe, which is good. But if you want something really amazing, try this variation I developed after trial and error. Use more peas (a lot of volume is lost with the skins), and pass them through the food mill when just barely defrosted. This will yield about a third of a cup or so of sweet pea-flavored liquid. Strain puree but reserve liquid. To the filling, add mascarpone cheese (about a third of a cup, roughly; use your judgment), a tablespoon or two of ricotta for body and chopped mint. As the broth reheats, add a few tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice. Then in each individual bowl, add a few tablespoons of reserved pea water to the broth. Both the broth and the tortellini are unbelievably delicious this way.

This was an excellent and easy dish to make. We made it for a starter at a recent party and it was a HUGE hit. Used wonton wrappers and can't wait to try fresh dough....would be even better. For color and Flavor....I added oven roasted cherry tomatos (just a couple ) to each bowl as well as some minced green onion.

Even the meat-and-potaotes skeptics at the table ate all of this--it was a crowd-pleaser.

The subtle combination of peas and cheese along with the lemon in the broth is wonderful. I served this as a main course for two. An elegant dish - worth the extra effort

This turned out to be a very good. I thought "this is a lot of work" especially the pea straining, but it was worth it. There didn't seem to be much "there, there" after doing the food mill thing, but I kept at it. The end result was light, but with a depth of flavor that endured.
