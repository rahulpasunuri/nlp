Great for Sunday brunch-didn't do the sauce; phyllo doesn't come that large so you'll need to adapt but I still used same amount of filling. Liquid for filling was too much- will use Calvados in place of wine next time and only 1/2-3/4 of the apple juice. I used Gingerbread cookie crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs. 4 of us ate the whole thing after a night of Halloween libations & carrying on until the wee hours.

I made this last year for Oktoberfest. Thanks to other reviewers, I scaled up the filling recipe by half, and made two strudels. I took the prettiest one to the party, and kept the other for myself. I pre-sliced the strudel and I'm glad I did. Slicing afterwards is a delicate proposition. I baked my strudels on parchment paper and will definitely do so again. I ended up being shy on the strudel dry ingredients. This year I'll scale those up 3x, so I won't have to stop and grind more while layering. I'll mix any extra into my next pie crust. Last year I made the chocolate sauce. I liked the contribution it made to the appearance, but the flavor would have been just as good without. This year, I'll warm a little Nutella and drizzle that over the top. Just enough for appearances.

This was a real crowd-pleaser--I served it to 16 people, and everyone thought it was delicious. Friends who don't usually ask for seconds wanted more! It's also really adaptable--I used fresh cherries and dried figs and dates, and while hazelnuts were great, I'm sure that walnuts, pecans, or almonds would work just as well. The other reviewers are right in that it would be difficult to serve this if you're expecting beautiful presentation. The outer phyllo layers crack, and the filling seeps out a bit. Also, I found that there was more than enough filling, and stretched it to 1 1/2 rolls--so if you increase the amount of filling a bit, you can make two rolls.

I absolutely loved this recipe! The earlier review that said that the chocolate sauce was not necessary is pretty right on, but I did like the German style it lent the dessert and it was tasty. I will totally be making this again in the future.

An additional comment: Pre-sclicing the roll before baking is an excellent idea, but don't overdo it. Slice only approx. 1/3 down, or the filling will leak out.

This is an excellent recipe, with a Eurpean feel- not too sweet. Some comments: 1. The filling recipe makes 1 1/2 rolls, so fold the remaining fillo dough in half to make a mini-roll. 2. Try to get #7 fillo dough. It's thicker and much easier to work with. 3.A slightly heavier hand with the cherries and prunes doesn't hurt. 3.The chocolate sauce is unnecessary. Simple vanilla ice cream or whipped cream is more appropriate.

I recently made this for an Oktoberfest we hosted and everyone loved it! I was able to make two strudels with the amount of filling this recipe yielded. There was more than enough chocolate sauce (which many said was the best part) for this amount of strudel. It smelled and looked incredible. My mother said this may replace apple pie on the Thanksgiving table. Great recipe!

This is an easy and yummy treat.Anytime you use Phyllo in a roll, always pre-cut prior to baking. I opted to pair this with a velvety caramel sauce, that really made the fruit pop, and the ice cream scream!

I plan on making this as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving, Hanna is correct about pre-slicing the phillo before cooking, you will find this the perfect solution. I will be serving this with a Brown Sugar Ice Cream, the recipe also found on this sight.

As a baklava baker, working with Phillo is always exciting. Trick with the slicing is to "preslice" before you bake it. The phillo is soft and cuts easily. After it's baked and reaches the consistancy of parchment paper, just slice again at the existing seams. It will look just like the picture.

The filo did crack when cut for serving so no perfectly pretty. The chocolate sauce is yummy on ice cream, but drowned th strudel flavor.

It was delicious. I liked that apples are mixed with prunes and cherries. and the taste and aroma of hazelnuts, so typical for German cuisine.

I gave it 3 forks for the wonderful taste. This recipe is great for family dinners. However, I was a little disappointed with the presentation. When I cut the strudel into slices the beautiful top golden layer cracked into pieces and the final product did not look suitable for an elegant party table.

Great recipe. Cooking time was only about 30 minutes and I covered it with foil to prevent burning.Chocolate sauce adds a nice touch.

wonderful Fall recipe that's simple but with a WOW presentation. You can substitute walnuts or almonds if you prefer where it calls for hazlenuts
