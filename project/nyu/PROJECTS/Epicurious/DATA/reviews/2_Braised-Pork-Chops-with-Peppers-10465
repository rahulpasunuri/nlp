I don't see the point of using the microwave. They turn out a little tough as a result. Just finish cooking the chops in the pan; take them out and keep them warm while still pink in the middle. Quickly cook the peppers adding the vinegar late, then deglaze the pan with the stock to make the sauce.

The chops ended up rather bland and the receipe was uninteresting. One would think that with the vinegar, peppers, and chops that this would at least have some taste. Next time, a nice marinade or season to taste in lieu of this receipe.

Sometimes when you're in a hurry it's convenient to have a recipe that can cook quickly in the microwave, an appliance I rarely use except for softening butter, reheating leftovers and making popcorn. I'm always on the lookout for good microwave recipes, however, because there are some evenings when we have to get home and then out of the house very quickly. I was disapponted not to have found such a recipe here. Don't bother to make this. You'll be much better off picking up a hamburger or making a quick sandwich.

Pretty good. I cooked the pork chops too much when I was supposed only to brown them. Chops were a little tough as a result. It made a nice colorful presentation, though, with a tossed salad and asparagus.

This is a great recipe if you don't make the mistake of using the microwave. I followed the directions exactly except I put it in the oven for 25-30 minutes instead of in the microwave.

I should have known when I saw this dish used a microwave. It was gross and tasted like something I made up from a half-empty larder. Do not try this at home.
