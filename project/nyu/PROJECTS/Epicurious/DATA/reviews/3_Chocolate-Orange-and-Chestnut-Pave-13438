It's fine, but far from great. I'd alter the chocolate to chestnut ratio. Too much chocolate. It's a good frozen treat, but again, a mediocre dessert.

I see that the problems the other reviwers noted have been corrected. The recipe as originally printed here said 4 cups of cream, rather than ¼ cup as it says now. My guess was that 1 cup was the right amount, but the ¼ cup should work fine! I made the garnishes from candied orange slices and dried pears, cut into leaf and acorn shapes, and placed them in the bottom of the loaf pan before adding the mousse.

There's no way this fits in a seven-cup loaf pan! The white chocolate cream layer was delicious, but made much more than necessary...we used the extra as pie topping. Also, the dark chocolate layers had a much harder consistency than the white which made slicing and serving difficult. Great taste, though, and a very rich dessert.

It was quite good, but I suspect that the quantity listed for cream for the white chocolate layer is wrong, I ended up with way too much of that layer.
