Based on reviews, I cut way back on cayenne and, given all the complaints about watery sauce, on the chicken broth. After about 20 minutes, I had to add the rest of the broth--the sauce had nearly boiled away. Maybe others are using a pot instead of a skillet, and that's why the sauce doesn't reduce quickly enough? I cut the entire recipe in half (except the shrimp) to serve 2, which also may have hastened reduction. I wish I'd also cut back on black pepper, not because it was too spicy, but the sauce had an unpleasant aftertaste. Overall, I just wasn't thrilled with the results.

This was also a hot at our Jamaican Me Crazy party. Just beware, it is VERY spicy. Had great flavors, so it would be just as good with a little less kick for those who like a little more moderate heat.

This is my go-to dish when we're in the mood for shrimp! It's easy and delish. Serve over polenta, roasted sweet potatoes or brown rice. I have to stifle a laugh at others that think 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne is TOO spicy! I use about a tablespoon, but I do realize that spiciness is like art - all in the eye of the beholder. To speed up the thickening process, I always add a little corn starch dissolved in water. Yum every time!

1 1/2 tsp cayenne?? Are you nuts? I added only 1 tsp and it was still way too hot. I'm all for spice but this was overwhelming. Has potential to be better with some tweaking.

I tossed this together tonight and didn't even measure a single ingredient. And still it was fantastic. Having great seafood helps, but the sauce is fabulous and we soaked up every drop with some french bread.

Delicio! A friend brought this appetizer over to our football gathering and it was gone in no time! Everyone loved it. I'll defininately give it a try for myself.

Yummy. Used 1 t black pepper, 1/4 t cayenne, and 1 t fresh thyme. Used 4C homemade, unsalted chicken broth & 2C store bought with salt. I think it's best to start small with the pepper and then add to taste after sauce is reduced. Which took about 1-1/2 hr, but doesn't need attention & is totally worth it.

This was fabulous! I added 1 bunch chopped green onions when I added the shrimp back to the skillet at the end of the recipe. Served alongside a salad composed of hearts of palm, grapefruit segments, avocado and arugula. Dressing was EVOO, lime juice, honey and kosher salt. Highly recommend this wonderful island dish!

I am a terrible cook, this in the one dish I've made that's come out absolutely delicious every time... I could almost sip the sauce like soup!

This recipe is amazing. We make it all the time. People love to dip bread in the sauce. Nothing is ever wasted.

I am ambivalent about this recipe, if I could give it 2.5 forks I would ... on the one hand it was good, I was hesitant to try it due to all the reviews noting the spiciness but I didn't really find it excessively hot. I do think that the recipe would be greatly improved with the addition of a fruity salsa or...something. I think I will make this again though, the shrimp tasted fantastic.

I was so excited to realize that this was the same sauce they make at Cha Cha Cha's sister restaurant, Prado. The only difference is that Prado adds fresh pineapple which I did! It was scrumptious. I also used someone's suggestion of Red Stripe Beer which was an excellent choice. I'd been looking for this recipe for so long!!!

Rating: 3
Much more flavorful than I expected, we enjoyed very much and will make again. I added onion and red pepper and sweated with the butter before adding the garlic. The sauce needs to boil for the full 45 minutes to reduce, it will thicken some and intensify in flavor but it will still be a thinner sauce. The sauce is wonderful over rice or sopped up with good bread. The spice level is high. We love spicy food and it was about right for us. I recommend adding the cayenne pepper gradually and tasting until you achieve your desired heat level.

This is a wonderful recipe! I have made it many times dinner parties or a quiet night at home. Great flavor.

We made this the other night for dinner. Aside from it being VERY easy to prepare, it was delicious! We used a little extra Cayenne Pepper and made it extra spicy and used Red Stripe beer...YUM YUM!

I didn't have any worcestershire sauce, used 8 shakes of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne, used a lager AND a porter for the beer, and only used half of the chicken broth (I used the rest to cook the rice). It was STILL delicious! My husband (who adores spicy food) loved it. Next time I'll stick closer to the recipe, but this was GREAT.

Rating: 2
Why oh why didn't I heed others advice when making this? I should have scaled WAY back on the spices as well. They don't call it spicy chili/beer sauce for nothin'! My husband & I love spicy food too but this was definitely more than we could handle. Otherwise a good recipe.

Rating: 4
Love this! I have made this many times, always with rave reviews. I do however use a couple of "shakes" of red pepper flakes rather than the cayenne - comes out spicy but not overwhelming and someone who wants more fire can always add more. An excellent variation is to add cooked and cut turkey sausage, a can of rinsed black beans and some pre-cooked chicken for a makeshift gumbo. That also helps to soak up some of the extra sauce folks are mentioning - boiling rather than simmering the sauce helps it thicken as well as the cornstarch idea...enjoy!

Rating: 2
This was pretty savory and good, but waaay too spicy for me and my family, and we like spicy food. I had to dilute the sauce with more broth at the end. I will try it again next time, but I would add 1/2 the cayenne and then taste before serving. You can always add more heat at the end.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Based on earlier reviews, I scaled back the pepper, but it was pretty tame. Next time, I'll add the full amount. Also -- be sure to use unsalted butter and the low-salt chicken stock, because it still comes out salty.

I don't know if it was just that the celestial bodies were aligned correctly or what, but everyone in my family devoured this and asked for more. I reduced the cayenne quite a bit and used the beer on hand (a blonde ale). I'm still in shock - my 4-year-old and 8-year-old, who don't like ANYTHING(!), truly gobbled it up. 3.5 forks

It's spicy, but not too spicy. Certainly no spicier than 3/4 stars at the Thai restaurants in Seattle. I thickened it with cornstarch as suggested, and didn't have to wait forever. Will make again.

This recipe was delicious and easy. My guests and I all loved it. I did heed the advice of the other reviewers and I used only 1 tsp. of cayenne and this was plenty spicy. I also used a little extra honey and added half a yellow onion when I added the shrimp at the end. It was great for company because the prep is quick and easy and you have plenty of time to make a salad and get everything else together as the sauce reduces. Terrific!

Great flavor! Very spicy though! Next time, to eat as a main dish, I'll add gumbo type veggies and not as much spice! I love spice but this was VERY spicy. Just a tad less.

Rating: 2
This dish came out too saucy (after I'd reduced it forever) and the shrimp were almost flavorless. I added at least another teaspoon of cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes, until it was at least somewhat spicy. Where's the 'spicy chili' in this recipe? Chopped peppers could really give this dish some potential.

This is the best recipe for shrimp that I have ever made. My friends actually think I am a great cook now. I am impressed with how easy it is to make and how complex the flavors are. I intend to make this my signature dish when friends come over.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have regular lager around so I used a honey wheat beer. I was also out of honey (and too lazy to go to the store) so I substituted syrup for the honey. Since there was just the two of us I used about 3/4 amounts of all the ingredients. The result was good. It reduced beautifully in the 45 minutes and wasn't too spicy. I think next time I might increase the syrup or honey even more to add an extra touch of sweetness. I think this would be great to try with some black beans and corn thrown in.

This is a wonderful recipe, although it's awfully hot (and I reduced the amount of pepper). It really should be served with rice or something else to ccool the burn. I added some stringless sugar snap peas and made it a complete meal.

I'm really surprised this recipe got rave reviews. I love to cook, my husband loves to eat, we did not think this was a good recipe at all. The liquid although boiling never reduced the way the recipe indicated it would. I ended up at the end adding some of the liquid to a few tablespoons of cornstarch and then stirring that in. I love heat in recipes but this was just tasteless heat as far as we are concerned. It was edible but I wouldn't make this again.

I can't believe I am writing this, but this recipe was actually TOO spicy for my husband and me!! NEVER has this happened before. I laughed at other reviewers that suggested lowering the pepper, thinking that the title says "Spicy" so it should be expected, but I really think it is a bit extreme. I WILL make this again, but will cut the peppers in half. Otherwise the timing was correct and the shrimp was great, when the sauce wasn't too heavy!

Sorry folks, but I just didn't see what the hoopla was all about on this one and I LOVE spicy food! It was OK, but doubt I'd make it again -there are too many other recipes out there!

Good recipe but the cayenne MUST be cut in half unless you like super spicy food. Had no trouble reducing the sauce in 45 minutes (make sure it's constantly at a low boil). Will definately make again.

I chose this recipe for our Caribean themed dinner party. It was a big sucess and everyone loved it. I did double the recipe and made it in a stock pot. After an hour and a half the sauce had not boiled down like the recipe said it would, so we made so with soupy sauce. We still enjoyed it!

I love this shrimp recipe. I agree that the cayenne pepper needs to be reduced to about 1 tsp (the first time I made it with 2 tsp and I actually got gastritis! Even so, I had to make it again.) This is a great meal for company becuase it can be mostly made as people are arriving, and then the sauce cooks during hors devours.

A little disappointing. It was not what we were expecting. With the amount of butter it called for it should have been better!

I made this dish the first time I saw the recipe in Bon Appetit. It has become my husband's favorite, and a favorite for guests as well. I, too, cut the cayenne in half. It was so spicy the first time I made it that I turned bright red! As a main meal I serve this with rice, but a few times I have served it up in in a large bowl with wedges of sourdough for my guests to mop up the wonderful broth. A great recipe. Note:"Red Stripe" is the name of the Lager from Jamaica. It's very good.

Good and spicy. I used Fosters Lager as I couldnt find caribbean lager at the market. Sauce did take some time to reduce, but the results are worth the wait. Next time I think I will increase the cayenne to 2 tsp for more hot, as I like it that way. Made this with the West Indian Rice and Beans and enjoyed both very much.

Warner Robins is not a gourmet foods mecca, and it is usually hard to find fresh shrimp. When they appeared yesterday at the local Kroger, I jumped at the chance to try this recipe and was not disappointed. Absolutely wonderful. It is very spicy though, so if you only like things medium hot, you might want to cut down a little on the cayenne pepper.

Rating: 4
Loved this dish, but definitely not for the faint of heart (or tastebuds). My only complaint was that the cayenne tasted "burnt" -- I think I sauteed too long before adding the beer. My dinner crowd has been begging for it again ever since I first served it. Have plenty of beer on hand, and your friends who like spicy hot foods will be forever in your debt.

VERY spicy and good. We did find we tired of the taste a bit by the end of the meal. It wasn't one of those meals we are craving again and again. We had the left overs the next night on a grilled corn, tomatoe, and black bean salad with some grilled scallops, all over baby greens. Not outstanding, but good.

Yeah Boy! Love it hot. My girl has cooked this favorite three times: once at full cayenne strength, once at 1 1/2 strength (by mistake), last at 3/4 strength. Flavors are absolutely fantastic. Loved 'em all, but the second was the best. Not for the meek of heart, but dy-no-mite!

This is more like 3 1/2 forks. Wow, fantastic!! I got scared after reading all the reviews and cut the black pepper to 1 tsp and the cayenne to 1tsp; Worchestershire to 1/3C. After it reduced (which, by the way, DOES take more than 45 minutes to get to the 1 1/2C as called for in the recipe, even at a full boil), I thought it could have used the full amount of cayenne, but better to be too mild than too spicy to eat. :) Served with recommended rice as well as sauteed zucchini "matchsticks" and the rest of the 6 pack of Red Stripe beer. Enjoy!!!!

I've eaten this dish at Cha Cha Cha dozens of times. The sauce isn't supposed to be very thick. It is fairly thin. I think you're all over-reducing it. Also, this is supposed to be an extremely spicy dish. If you don't like spicy foods, don't make it. It's really that simple.

Rating: 2
I was so disappointed with this dish. It tasted GREAT while the sauce was reducing, but by the time it was done, I thought the sauce was too syrupy and that the honey and worchestershire tastes overpowered everything else. If I ever make this again, I'm going to reduce it less and then just thicken the sauce with a roux.

3.5 forks - thanks for all the great suggestions - my result was not too spicy (for husband), not too salty. Suggested substitutions: 1 t black pepper, 1/2 t cayenne with 1/2 t chipotle tabasco, 1/3 c worcestershire. It took about 1 hr to reduce and it was great with basmati rice. Add salt and chipotle tabasco after serving to suit individual tastes. I chose ease and purchased a jarred fruit salad from the refrigerated section - Del Monte Sunfresh Tropical in Passion Fruit Juice - it was perfect.

DELICIOUS,USED ALL SPICE BUT USED HALF CAYENNE +HALF TABASCO CHIPOTLE SAUCE. FOLLOWING OTHER REVIEWS I USED LESS THA 1/4 CP OF WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE. ONLY USED 4CP CHICKEN BROTH WICH REDUCED TO 1 1/4 IN ABOUT 45 MIN AT A "BOIL" BUT MADE A QUICK ROUX TO THICKEN SAUCE IN THE END

Agreed, it takes alot longer to reduce. Also, needs more rice than I origionally used to dilute the sauce. Spicy, but good!

Rating: 2
I would have given it 3 forks, because it's a great combination of underlying flavors, but I found that it needed much more time to reduce in order to get the sauce thick enough not to be soupy. By that time (maybe an hour) it had become WAY too salty even though I cut down on the amount of Worcestershire sauce. When I asked my boyfriend what he had for lunch the next day (he had eaten the leftovers), he said "the salt lick"!

Great combination of flavors. Agree that cayenne is way too much. Served with both brown and white rice - both fine.

I should've read these reviews before I prepared this dish...as others said, we loved the flavors but will reduce the spices next time. Also, we do enjoy spicy dishes. We've eaten things like jerk chicken in Jamaica, at roadside grills that cater to locals, and haven't experienced "too hot" dishes. I will take another reviewer's suggestion about serving a fruit salad with this dish.

Mega-dittoes to Jerry and Denny!! My husband and I both like spicy food, too, and this was WAY TOO MUCH. However, we liked the flavours we could discern despite the incediary nature of the dish and will try again with less cayenne. We also served with basmati... perfect rice for it. And I made a fruit salad for the side.

OK. I would definitely make this again, BUT BUT But take a look at the amount of cayenne pepper and also black pepper. These measurements are truly for the Caribbean taste buds.The next time we make it we would put in a dash of cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp. black pepper. The flavor is awesome . We added 3 tbsp. of honey thinking it would counter act all the cayenne. It didn't. The sauce flavor is outstanding, but much too spicy, and we both like spicy foods, I mean spicy. We served Basmati rice, and it was the perfect kind to eat with this spicy food. Does any of this make sense? I think you get the picture. Jerry and Denny
