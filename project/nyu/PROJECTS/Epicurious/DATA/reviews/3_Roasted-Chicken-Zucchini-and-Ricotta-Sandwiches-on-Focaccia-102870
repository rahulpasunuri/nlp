This recipe was just ok. It tasted fine and wasn't difficult, but it was rather bland. Not sure what it needed to spruce it up, but it definitely needs something. Also, I agree that using Ciabatta makes it messy to eat.

Wow, as with everything else that calls for fresh lemon zest, the cheese spread was bursting with flavor! Be sure to use quality tomatoes. The recipe didn't state cold or hot chicken, but I definitely prefer hot.

I used skim ricotta and the taste was still excellent as if I used whole. If you are going to make these sandwiches you have to put a little fresh garlic and basil in when sautéing the zucchini. The taste is fabulous!!

Last night I divided this recipe in half to make 2 servings. This made 2 MONSTER sandwiches; I'm glad I didn't try to serve a side dish. Even though I nuked and used 2 Great Value grilled chicken breast fillets with rib meat (because some reviewers said this was lacking in flavor as written), it was still only just OK. I used part-skim ricotta cheese, and there was too much basically flavorless zucchini/ricotta filling. I will not make these again.

Very good and fast, easy way to use summer's bounty. Finely chopped tomato and basil and tossed with a tsp of white wine vinegar, salt and pepper, instead of tomato slices. Used FF ricotta and added a little extra asiago. Seasoned and cooked up some chicken breasts and shredded instead of buying a whole roasted bird. I was going to serve it with some gazpacho, but the sandwiches were more than adequate alone. I will add this to my collection.

This was fantastic!!! I made it low fat, making my own FF focaccia, using a low-fat ricotta, and sauteeing the zucchini in olive oil Pam. The only addition I made was to top the tomato slices with fresh basil. Wonderful, filling, quick week-night supper!

I served this for a casual lunch, and my date went away quite impressed. An excellent sandwich. I served it with cherry pie and mashed potatos.

An interesting combination of good ingredients. Fresh bread, flavorful chicken, and good tomatoes make the difference. This is not bland, but not bursting with flavor, either. It was a nice change for a casual dinner, especially when served with a flavorful salad. My main complaint was that it was messy -- the ricotta mixture kept smushing out of the bread. Focaccia works better than ciabatta, as the latter made a sandwich too thick to eat easily.

Blahh! I made this for dinner last night and it lacks flavor. I used a good focaccia, fresh parmesan and roasted my own chicken breasts. Now that I look at the recipe it's obvious there are no flavorful ingredients. A real disappoinment.

This is an outstanding dish. I made it for a summer lunch, along with a green bean, watercress and walnut salad (also Bon Appetit). The ricotta/zucchini filling was delicious. I roasted the chicken myself. I also did not use focaccia but a good, solid Italian bread. I will definitely make this again. For dessert, I served apricots and cherries in white wine and almond biscotti (both Bon Appetit, June 96). It was a memorable meal!
