Made exactly as written. Guests agreed that it was wonderful. All the flavors melded together beautifully. Served as an hors d'oeuvre on sliced, toasted baguette.

This caponata came out quite well, with many dinner guests taking second helpings. It was served with grilled steak. After thinking back to other caponatas I have had, and then referring to a recipe from Molto Mario, I added about a teaspoon of cacao powder. It added a nice depth to the flavor. Will make this one again.

This was my favorite caponata recipe of all time--interesting flavors and textures. I substituted three tablespoons of tomato paste mixed with some water for the diced tomato.

I used to make copanata frequently years ago and this recipe sparked my interest again. I made this recipe and thought it was wonderful. Our family always made caponata with both celery, raisins and pignoli. I recently ate at a restaurant in California where they gave their patrons a bowl of caponata with bruschetta compliments of the chef. Their version had celery and pine nuts but did not contain raisins. Also delicious, but I like the sweet/sour taste with the raisins added.

I was curious how caponata would taste with tomatoes. It was good, but this is not traditional caponata, which contains tomato paste, no raisin, or pignoli nuts. It also requires that after frying, you cook the eggplant with all the other ingredients. I did this and added more vinegar, tomatoes and basil. I prefer the more authentic recipes

Mediocre at best, this recipe made my husband beg me never to make caponata again. If you don't love caponata, this recipe won't change your mind.

This recipe is really interesting to me because I have been making something so very similar to it for many years now. I started out trying to copy the caponata at a restaurant nearby, and now I think that they might have derived their recipe from the magazine issue! I don't add celery because, to me, the flavor is somewhat contrary to the flavors that beautify caponata. One thing I do that makes the dish different is I soak the golden raisins in 1/2 cup red wine, and I omit the vinegar. Also add some black olives!

VERY GOOD CAPONATA RECIPE

Very versatile, I make often. Try with grilled lamb, tuna or swordfish. You can also drain the juice, mix in a small amount of Ital breadcrumbs and use to stuff large mushrooms for a low-cal hors d'ouevre.

Yum! I substituted balsamic vinegar for wine vinegar and the caponata had a wonderful tangy taste. I took this to a party and the entire bowl vanished in 20 minutes. Once I substituted chic peas for pine nuts and it still tasted wonderful.

I took this recipe to a friends place and we all enjoyed it. As I left the remains there, next time when I have leftovers (any you definately will) I will do as the previous person did and serve it up with pasta and goat cheese.

This was a great dish that everyone loved.It's also great if you spread a little goat cheese on the bread under the caponata. I ate the leftover caponata with pasta and over fish as well, it's really quite versatile.

I prefer more traditional bruschetta recipes, but this was actually more suited for pasta, which was excellent the next day. I'd make it again as a pasta dish.

I added two cloves garlic, sustituted apple cider vinegar( that is all I had), and used a whole can of Dole diced tomatoes(14 oz can, unsalted), simmered until liquid reduced. At the end, when cooled I added a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. Scrumptious, a kind of densely flavored ratatouille. I had planned to serve it as a first course, but maybe will serve it over my baked fish main course. Yum

Not sure about the golden raisins, would omit them in my recipe. I put in a half a can of good tomato paste for a real tomato-ey taste and good color. Goes great with orzo!

This is my favorite caponata recipe - I usually add some tomato sauce if I have some availabe - it benefits from more tomato. Everyone always loves it and it freezes beautifully!!!

I prepared this recipe for a welcome part for out of town guests. EVERYONE raved over the caponato and most everyone asked for the recipe. I was very glad to have found this recipe on Epicurious Food and have no quams about using any other of your recipes from now on.
