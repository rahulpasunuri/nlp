I added a little extra rum and soaked my raisins in it after first soaking them in 1/3 cup boiling water. Used 1 cup white and 2/3 cup brown sugar, and added 1/2 cup applesauce since others found the cake dry. Mine came out fabulous!

I dont make a lot of pound cake so I dont have much to compare it to, but its ok - could use a stronger rum flavour.

I used chopped dates instead of raisins and mixed using a hand mixer. It was very good. Would try this again and maybe add more rum or dream to get it a little more moist.

Wonderful! I made this without any fancy baking tools and no raisins. I didn't make the frosting and it still came out delicious. I put in an extra Tbsp of rum and the flavor still came out great and not overpowering at all - it just added to the delicious aroma of the cake. Didn't bake it for a whole hour though. Took it straight from the over and plated it. Real comfort food!

This one is a keeper! It is a little on the dry side, but not dried out, which makes it also a very good breakfast cake, spread with butter and served with a cup of good, hot strong coffee. I have served this for dessert (even the chocolate cake lovers love this) and also for brunch and it is a winner every time, for all ages! For brunch I would recommend omitting the glaze.

I've made this recipe a few times, and it was a bit on the dry side, however, I just made it again this week and incorporated about 1/2 c of heavy cream while blending in the flour at the end. It turned out great, less dry and still delicous after 2 days. Did use one extra Tbsp of rum in the batter also.

I baked this for the first time in a kitchen without ANY measuring utensils, a very small hand mixer, no proper baking pan, almost not enough of any of the ingredients. I had to substitute orange juice for the rum for teetotaling diners. The finished product was still delicious - the cake was not too dry and finished baking in the allotted time.

I thought this pound cake was delicious. I didn't bake the entire time...about 45 minutes.

The initial recipe is quite dry (even when you mix some of the flour into the raisins), I added a half cup of milk and added 2 tablespoons of the extract (a little heavy, true). Also, an alternative for the recipe is to use golden raisins and a light rum, it is turns out a pretty yellow color.

This poundcake had plenty of flavor, but was very dry. I'll probably try it once more with some adjustments.

This cake was very good! Next time I think I will add more raisins. I used about one tablespoon more rum than it called for, and the rum flavor was great and not overpowering.
