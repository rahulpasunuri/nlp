Not bad, but will try other recipes in the future. Liked the horseradish in the glaze. Overcooked the ham, because I used the cooking times but I had a smaller (spiral) ham.

I didn't use cloves and used a spiral ham. It was easy and superb.

Presentation was beautiful. I tasted the glaze and was worried I wasn't going to like it but, it was good. However, next time I will skip the cloves and use a spiral ham to get the glaze into the ham slices more.

I prepared this for Easter dinner and it was a real hit. The flavor of the orange with the horseradish is yummy. I followed the recipe exactly, only added a heaping teaspoon of plain horseradish, we really liked it. I didn't use the Cranberry Mustard sauce, it seemed fine.

Excellent flavor, everyone liked it and it was easy. Just make sure you time it for the 10 minutes

Made this with a 9lb half ham, used much more horseradish than called for and did not use cream style - we like it spicy, made extra glaze and served w/ ham on table. Fantastic! I never make ham - it was a special diner's request but am going to make it again while ham is on sale at all the stores!

Fantastic. The only changes I made were to tent with foil up 'til the glazing stage, and to baste and glaze somewhat longer 'til the ham was just the color I wanted.,

Fantastic. The only changes I made were to tent with foil before I began to glaze, and to allow a bit more time for the glazing and basting until the ham was just the color I wanted.

I used this as the jumping off point and this was outstanding. I used a 10lb spiral sliced ham instead and warmed it to room temp by submerging it while it was still in its sealed wrapper in hot tap water for 90 minutes, changing water once. Skipped the whole cloves. Then I baked the ham at 250 degrees in an oven bag with the cut side of the ham down and 4 slits cut in the top of the bag for about an hour and a half (10 minutes/lb, or until the center reached 100 degrees). The ham was on a rack in a roasting pan and I'd added about 1 cup of water to the roasting pan. I mixed the glaze in a blender, doubling the horseradish as suggested by others and adding 1/2 to 1 tsp ground cloves. Took the ham from the oven, increased temp to 325 degrees, discarded pan water, unwrapped ham and pretty much followed the recipe from there on -- though the final bake time was about 20 minutes. Moist and delicious; best ham ever!

This was a hit at the Christmas dinner table. Followed the recipe, but skipped the OJ and brushed on the glaze 3X in 30 minutes. I followed the advice of another poster and made extra to pass around.

I bought a spiral sliced ham and skipped the diamonds/cloves step. The juice and glaze was able to penetrate between the slices just enough to give a delicious flavor. Good for holiday dinners or as part of a buffet.

Haven't tried it yet but will tomorrow. After reading reviews about the flavor not penetrating, I'm thinking injection if I can get the glaze thru the needle. Also will leave out the cloves.

this is a good recipe, not every one liked the glaze but it was certainly a do again ham.

Really liked this simple, tasty, and good for a large group. Microplaned some orange zest into it too for more tanginess.

I liked this recipe very much, the spicy horseradish offsets the sweetness of the marmalade/brown sugar nicely. the only thing I would do different is if using a chunky marmalde I would put it in the food processor for a couple of seconds. The bigger pieces of orange made the basting a little difficult and the finished ham did not have a smooth glossy appearance but was still delicious.

Made this for Christmas dinner. It was good but you really don't get the benefit of the glaze if you cut the fat off when eating! Next time I will do as suggested and add more horseradish AND, double the glaze to pass at the table. FYI, The OJ in the roasting pan kept evaporating during the last 40 minutes of basting.

This was my first ham, it was delicious, very moist and tender and the glaze was very easy to make and delicious. I did double the horseradish to cut down on the sweetness of the marmelade and it was excellent. Rave reviews from everyone at Easter dinner.

This is the first ham I have ever attempted. I used a precooked 15lb. ham. The scoring and cloves make for a great presentation. The marmalade glaze turned out well. However, I was sort of disappointed that the taste didn't carry thru the to the meat more. Nonetheless, my ham was juicy and very good. For a group of 8-10 people, I would scale this ham down to about a 10lb. ham.

Prepared this with a spiral-cut ham, so I used ground cloves instead of whole. My marmalade was a somewhat bitter variety, and a very hot horseradish. Was good but not great. Most probably not a repeat.

Rating: 1
Definitely not my favorite. Made the ham a little too sweet for my taste. I think it was the orange juice, which I thought would be good, that I really don't like. Oh well, most of the recipes from this site that I try, I really like. Just not this one.

I made this recipe with a 14# spiral cut ham from Costco. Since the ham was pre-sliced I didn't bake with the water but instead replaced with 1c. of orange juice. Didn't need the second cup. The glaze was wonderful. Will look for a slightly more "bitter" marmalade next time or reduce the brown sugar since the Smuckers brand was a little too sweet in my opinion. Made a sauce with the de-fatted pan drippings and left-over glaze to serve on the side. Nice change from the usual pineapple, brown sugar and mustard glaze.

Rating: 2
Not bad, a nice alternative to the usual sweet, gooey glaze. I wish there was a way to get more of the clove flavor into the ham. I am glad I tried it as it has been posted in my recipe box for a long time. Still will be in the hunt for another not so sweet ham glaze.

Delicious, and loved by all. Only complaint: a few people who don't like cloves cut the edges off. 18 lb. ham feeds an army. Great with Cranberry Mustard.

This is a GREAT ham recipe. I made it 2 years ago for my son's birthday dinner and am back to get the recipe for this easter. Everyone loved it, so I'm doing it again. Just used less cloves and followed the rest of the instructions. GREAT!

This was good but not amazing. It would have been nice if the flavours penetrated the ham a bit more, but ham is so dense that it can't really be helped. At any rate, it was tough to keep basting it while making so many other things that needed tending to...it might do well to be covered for a bit toward the end so it doesn't dry out. But all in all, very tasty!

The marmalade horseradish glaze was incredible. I actually had to make more of it in the middle of the meal - that's how well everyone liked it!

Wonderfully easy special dish! This was my first time baking ham for a special Christmas family meal and this worked out just as expected. The whole family enjoyed it. The best part was it reheated beautifully for left overs for several more meals too! Yummy

I used this with an unbaked ham, figuring I could start glazing it with the marmalade when the ham had just 30 minutes left to cook. I'd never cooked a ham before and didn't know what I was doing, so it didn't work out--the fat layer was too thick so you couldn't taste any of the glaze. But the next day I reheated the slices with fresh glaze on them and put some extra glaze out that people spooned onto their sandwiches. Everyone raved, saying it was even better than the night before.

This was wonderful, with nice presentation. MKade it for the in-laws who don't like "nothing but good plain cooking!" and they loved it. They even took some of both the ham and mustard home. The mustard makes nice homemade gifts also- and it seems to keep for a lot longer then indicated if refrigerated.

This is hands-down the BEST ham recipe ever (and all 12 of us who tried it agreed). We stepped away from our tried and true family recipe to give this one a whirl and have decided that this is the new family recipe. I substituted apricot jam for the orange marmalade and it was just delicious. I can't wait to make it again (and again and again).

This was great. I used a 20 lb ham and the presentation was beautiful. Excellent taste. Hint of orange through out the ham. Be sure to make the mustard to go with it.,made a great side dish. Everyone loved and took some home. Both the ham and the mustard.

I made this for Christmas and lost the recipe. Thank goodness I found it on the internet to make it for Easter. This ham is wonderful! Also, the longer it was refrigerated the better it tasted.

Stop looking, you have found it. The method is sound, preparation easy. I was blown away at the result. It was a beauty. Instead of marmalade apricot conserve was used. And I opted not to use the cloves. Truly a show stopper.

I seem to be the lone dissenter. I found this recipe just okay. The glaze does not penetrate the ham, so flavor is just a thin coating on the outside. Also did not think the mustard was worth the effort.

This was just wonderful!!! I served it with the cranberry mustard. I took another writers suggestion and served it with old-fashioned scalloped potatoes and green beans with roasted onions.
