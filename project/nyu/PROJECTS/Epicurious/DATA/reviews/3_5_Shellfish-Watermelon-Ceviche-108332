I have made this several times and it's delicious! Really refreshing. I added more jalapeno, some celery for texture, extra orange and watermelon, as well as mint. My family ate the leftovers as an appetizer the next day, scouping it up with tortilla chips. As for comments about ceviche not being cooked but "cooking" in the lime, that only works for fish. Shellfish has a high bacteria content needs to be cooked first.

Aug 2, 2009, on 2707 Roofdeck in Adams Morgan to celebrate Celia's B-day: I had selected 8 wines from Italy's Piedmont and the 13 other attendees each collaborated to make a dish to match each wine. Sonny & Laura made this ceviche to pair with a 2008 Gavi from La Slina/Giorgio Cichero. It ABSOLUTELY ROCKED! And the watermelon was the distinctive element. 28 thumbs up!

I know about ceviche, having lived for years in Latin America. Usually find it too acidic, but not this one. Served it at a dinner party and our guests absolutely raved! They could not guess what the crunchy ingredient was..... watermelon!

This is terrific. I used shrimp and thinly cut sea scallops, but the delicate texture of the seas scallops was terrific and more interesting than the shrimp. The sweet watermelon and the hot pepper juxtaposition is so interesting with the tart of the citrus. Next time, more jalapeño (and I am not usually a fan), more ginger, and only sea scallops.

THIS CEVICHE WAS OUTSTANDING!!! RAVE REVIEWS BY ALL...NOT BEING FOND OF MINT, I USED CILANTRO WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT FLAVOR FOR MOST CEVICHES!!!! THE FRUITS AND SEAFOOD COMBO WAS QUITE REFRESHING.....

I wasn't sure if I would like this as I am not a big fan of watermelon. It turned out to be surprising unique flavor with spicy, sweet and savory tones as well as a lovely mix of textures. The key is to use fresh seafood and all the kinds the recipe it calls for.

Recipe is very good, I added cilantro and more jalapeno, the one I had must not've been hot enough. Will definitely make again.

I didn't want to buy a lobster so I put in additional shrimp and scallops. I served individual portions in martini glasses lined with the lettuce. I thought the taste was a bit lifeless but my guests loved it. I would make it again with some tweaking.

This is a wonderful summer appetizer! I made this ceviche and a second ceviche and this was the hands-down favorite. My guests lapped it up! I would definitely reccomend this. I would probably add a little more ginger and jalapeno second time around for added bite/dimension. Very good dish!

YUM! this was awesome. the ginger and the mint and the watermelon were so refreshing with the seafood. i subbed a can of lump crab for the lobster and that was great. scooped it with some tortilla chips, but the plantain idea is a good one. and the remains in the bowl wrapped up in the boston lettuce leaves were tasty too.

This dish is truly outstanding. I made it to snack on while working on the main course of a get-together with friends, along with two other ceviches -- the Peruvian Ceviche de Pescado from this site (replacing the fish with shrimp), and Diana Kennedy's ceviche (the only one that actually began raw). This one was everybody's favorite, and well-deservedly so. The sweetness of the watermelon was a fantastic combination with the citrus, mint, and zip of the pepper. I will absolutely make this again. Snack on it with chips, and put out a bowl of salsa too. Looked for fried plantain chips and couldn't find them at the store; too lazy to make my own. I'm sure that would have been great too. We had left-overs, which we froze, but the texture of the shellfish had suffered by the time we defrosted it to enjoy it again a week later. Eat it all up if you can. Or invite more friends! And dude, cook from Vancouver, ceviche is normally raw -- chicken it ain't.

I made this dish last night for my wife. We are huge fans of ceviche, and this dish did not disappoint. We like our ceviche kind of "soupy" with lots of juice, so I doubled the lime juice with a mix of small and key limes. I also chopped fresh cilantro and added it to the mix. In the future, I will double the amount of watermelon and, perhaps, add a bit more red onion. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for a late lunch yesterday and followed the basic recipe (tweaked it here and there as I typically do) and it went over very well. Only change I would make is to add the chopped watermelon and orange right before serving - did that with the leftovers and the contrast between the texture and flavors improved it a great deal.

I don't believe that fruit and seafood go very well together. I'm not a very good cook but i believe that using chicken instead of seafood will taste better.

This dish is absolutely amazing. The people that I made it for are still talking about it 9 months later and asking me to make it again. I recommend fresh seafood and taking advantage of the jalapeno. I found that the servings were smaller than I expected however, so I would make more of it. Great first course that I will be making again.

Liked it, didn't love it. Put this together at the last minute for a cookout using reviews from other cooks. Definitely needed additional jalepeno(s). Even though I used fresh high-grade shellfish and fruit, it just lacked pizazz, even though it was a $30+ dish to make.

I made a double batch for my housewarming last night to be sure I would have some leftovers and my darn guests ate it all! :) he he :) THIS CEVICHE IS OUTSTANDING! For simplicity I bought all of the shellfish precooked from the market - and that's how I'll continue to make this...no need to spend the extra time on cooking the fish. I eyeballed all of my ingredients and put in more of everything (except the liquids) because it just looked so good! I will definitely add more jalapeno next time...the jals mellowed too much after a few hours of chillin in the fridge...and I want a little more kick next time. Yummy - perhaps I'll make another batch just for me today....

This was so lovely and refreshing as a first course. Every bite had so much flavor! It is important to get a little of all the ingredients in each serving or you really miss out. They just don't stand up on their own.

This was made for us as a starter for a 4th of July BBQ and it was absolutely delicious, even without the lobster. Refreshing, flavorful, and colorful!

Followed the recipe to the letter. We found it to be too bland and uninteresting compared to other ceviches we've made. Discouraging considering how expensive the ingredients were. We ended up adding hot sauce to it and more salt to give it some flavor but it still lacked punch.

Yes, real ceviche is "cooked" by letting the fish sit in citris juice for several hours. This method is just a faster way of cooking the fish, with the same end result.

What all of your "cooks" have left out about Ceviche is that the "raw" fish is cooked not by heat, but from the citrus juices added. So it is, in fact, cooked fish. Tasted pretty good also!

my hubby loves seafood and citrus flavors this is such a nice cool dinner on a hot evening, he absolutely adored it and it saved me hrs in the kitchen cooking lol.

I haven't made this yet, but don't see any raw seafood in the receipe either. It says in the ingredients list to add 1/4 lb of "cooked" lobster

Ceviche is often made from shrimp, so it's a valid name. Any form of uncooked seafood qualifies as Ceviche. The recipe is quite different from the classic, but it looks interesting.

In the US, most people don't want to/don't feel safe eating raw fish. They're probably right--you can contract Hep A from ceviche in Ecuador :)

Ceviche: An appetizer popular in Latin America consisting of _raw fish_ marinated in citrus (usually lime) juice. Just one question - where's the raw fish?
