I picked up some catfish at Whole Foods and pulled up this recipe. Had to do a little substituting using plain yogurt, dried shallots and I found my tube of tomato paste was passed its prime so I used Heinz Ketchup with balsamic and some crunchy dill pickles that I buy at the Farmers market. The sauce still turned piquant and a perfect match. With fresh corn and a zucchini (oregano and melted brie) side dish it was a great meal...oh yeah, heirloom maters.

The breading was nice and crunchy but, as another reviewer said, didn't brown well. Also, I used stone ground polenta meal and should have used a finer corn meal. The remoulade was nice but next time I may whiz it up in the food processor. Even though I cut the pickles and shallots as fine as possible I think it would be better if it was creamy instead of crunchy. My 1 1/2 year old son loved the catfish (without the remoulade).

I actually made just the remoulade sauce from this recipe,and liked it,I would suggest decreasing the parsley to one tablespoon,and make sure the dill pickles are super fine. I made this for a shrimp po'boy,and the crunch of the dill pickle interfered with the crust on the shrimp,but with a few revisions i would make it again.

This was glorified fish sticks with tarter sauce. I see there's great reviews here, but I followed the recipe to a T and was completely unimpressed. Maybe I just prefer catfish blackened and less greasy. Would not make again.

This is a wonderful receipe that we followed to a T. We complemented the main course with steamed snap peas and a fruit salad of cantiloupe and blue berries. The sweetness of the fruit was wonderful alongside the zestiness of the fish and remoulade. We served a sauvignon blanc as well. Fab. One change could easily be made for those who are calorie conscious: the recipe calls for drizzling oil on the fillets before flipping. Not necessary. Also, we used low-fat mayo and sour cream in the remoulade. No problem. Will be using this recipe again? You betcha!

The breading process was better than any I've used in the past and turned out nicely crusted, just not browned much. Since I used panko instead of bread crumbs it may have affected the browning.

Just like the category says, quick and easy. I served this as sandwiches on hoagie rolls with a mix of iceberg lettuce and shredded cabbage.

This is a great recipe!! Quick easy, I had all the ingredients in the house, did not have to go out and purchase. More importantly, my husband hates fish and he LOVED LOVED this dish. And yes you can subsitute.

OK, I made changes, but great results. I dusted red snapper in a bag of seasoned rice flour, next into a bath of beaten egg with a little cream and nonfat milk, then a final bag of panko, seasoned Italian breadcrumbs, and crushed cornflakes (and seasoning). Baked as directed on a sheet covered with foil that I sprayed, also sprayed the fillets. Did a parallel pan with chicken tenders for non-fish-eaters. Served with Bobby Flay's cumin coleslaw, red beans and rice, and Mississippi caviar (spicy black bean dish). Fish and chicken were crisp outside, tender in, VERY tasty.

Delicious and very easy. I luckily had really fresh catfish. I used panko instead of breadcrumbs and we all loved it. I will definitely make this my go-to oven fried fish recipe.

This Alabama gal says "yum". A great weeknight dinner. I subsituted red onion for the shallots and used store bought seasoned bread crumbs. The lemon came from our next door neighbors tree.

This was an excellent recipe. Made this for my boyfriend who was raised on traditional deep fried catfish. He was skeptical, but he loved it. I used Panko bread crumbs and the taste and texture was great. Will definately make again soon.

This was quite tasty - and even better, quick and easy. I just made the fish, not the sauce, and served with a lemon wedge and lemon risotto from this site. Will make again.

This sounds awfully good, since we love catfish. While I know it's not a true remoulade sauce, I don't think it really matters. It looks like it'll be just a nice spicy sauce to top the catfish. I'm going to serve this with a sweet potato casserole, and some spinach. It'll be a lovely dinner!

Catfish yummy. Have made twice. 1st time roasted asparagus under it - smoked up oven & cat didn't crisp up - doh! I like to soak fillets in milk a few hours, then pat dry. Cut recipe in half with no problems. We didn't think it needed Remoulade and just had it plain 2nd time.

A simple and tasty dish. Although it didn't completely blow us away, we will definitely make it again. Served this with asparagus and rice.

This was an easy recipe but not the best flavor. I replaced reg breadcrumbs with panko and added some additional garlic and cayenne to egg mixture, but the fish was still rather bland. I kicked up the remoulade with chopped capers, extra hot sauce and a little dill and it rocked! The leftover fish was reheated (and remained crispy) under the broiler the next day and thrown in a whole wheat wrap with veggies and the remoualde - pretty good. I would make it again but spice it up the coating more.

I also added a final panko dredge to the fish. My 7 year old said he liked catfish better than macaroni and cheese...that is the highest compliment. I did a different sauce. I used 3 parts greek yogurt to one part mayo with a handful of finely chopped fresh dill.

Remoulade was really good - I followed that recipe exactly, except I subbed cornichons for dills (not a huge difference). I used the catfish cooking method, but I'm a fan of using panko crumbs and dredging in rice flour, so didn't follow the ingredients list exactly. Everyone loved it, esp. the remoulade. The fish was great, too.

The catfish was absolutely delicious. Quick & easy & a guilt-free way to enjoy fried fish. Now about the sauce -- blech. Followed recipe to the letter, and my husband's polite comment was it was "weird". Nasty is more like it. Make the fish, but skip the sauce.

this fish came out crunchy and delicious- better than fried. i added a little wheat germ (for whole grain) and cayenne to the breadcrumb mixture and it tasted so good that my husband said it didn't even need the remoulade.

I loved this recipe and now I only bake catfish in the oven. For a regular meal, I don't bread the fish - I just put the filets w. salt and pepper on the oiled baking pan. I save the breading and the remoulade for special occasions.

Very good! Better than fried and I used gluten free bread crumbs and coconut oil for dietary reasons. Add a little cayenne for an extra kick. I will make this catfish again and again. Not so sure about the remoulade it was good but not great.

Great way to have 'fried' fish. if you want to lighten this up even more, go much easy on the veg oil and use fat free sour cream in the remoulade. I secretly use the ff sour cream ALL THE TIME and no one in my family seems to notice-especially if everything else is packed w/flavor.

My new "secret"recipe for a quick, easy and delicious meal. Last week with catfish, with cumin, cayenne and garlic powder added to the crumbs. This week with haddock and just salt and pepper to season the crumbs. I do dust with a bit of flour before the eggwash which I think made for a more even crust. Born and raised on the New England coast, we are serious about seafood, and this recipe meets all criteria.

This was a great recipe!! I served it topped with the crab imperial from this website. What a crowd pleaser!! Used hot sauce instead of tabasco sauce and it turned out lovely. will definitely make again!! My first time making catfish, but definitely not my last

Unbelievably delicious. It's the first time I have ever cooked catfish and it cooked out perfectly. The only change I would make next time is to use a little less Tobasco sauce, however my family liked the recipe and my husband even thanked me for a "great" dinner and asked me to make it again.

I used 1/8 tsp tabasco sauce and light mayo for the remoulde sauce and it still came out excellent. The fish came out cooked perfectly. This dish was quick and easy to make.

Except for using slightly less Tobasco sauce, made this as directed and found it to be excellent.
