The filling for me is 4 forks.. I love this recipe and make it often but...I get the crust from the pastry shop ! Ok, so I cheat but still comes out great everytime and guests are so impressed.

I love lemon so I was anxious to try this. I added extra lemon zest to the filling for more tartness, which was perfect. Tried it a second time using store bought lemon curd; just as good, but more expensive to make. Crust was dry for me, too. Probably use a different crust recipe next time.

What a disappointment! I took this to a party for a friend's birthday tonight and was embarrassed when we took the first bite. There are many recipes for a lemon tart that are far superior to this one...the crust was nothing memorable, and the filling very ordinary...definitely would not make this again. Love this website, however, and this is the first time I've had a "flop".

This tart won rave reviews at our Easter dinner.

I served this after a BBQ of garlic rosemary lamb with salads. It cleared the palette wonderfully. My photocopier was busy with all the requests for it.

I lived in Budapest where I used to go to a French restaurant just for the tarte au citron they had for dessert. I have been looking for a recipe that tastes that good for some time, and now I've found it! I probably used more grated lemon peel in the filling because I love that aroma. I also added two extra egg yolks to the filling because I wanted the tart to come out really yellow. It was perfect! I didn't do the "brulee" part because after baking it came out of the oven with a nice golden top anyway. I drizzled a bit of raspberry sauce over each piece before serving. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water, so I will probably make it again tonight.

I loved this dessert!!! The second time I made it I doubled the filling, I liked that better. I served the tart with fresh raspberries and a creme anglaise sauce which put it over the edge! big hit!

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. It's very easy to make. I don't add any extra water either. It's light and goes well with some fresh fruit.

I made this Saturday, May 1 for a dinner party. The crust was very dry. I added more water than it called for, too. It wasn't quite what I expected.I did, however toast some pecans and added that to the crust - for some flavor... could be what made it appear so dry. I probably would not make it again - I have other tart recipes I know turn out much better!

A friend brought this dessert to my dinner party. It was very good; lemony, light and we all had a second piece!

Excellent recipe, not a heavy dessert. I did have to add more than 2 tablespoons of water to the crust, probably three.
