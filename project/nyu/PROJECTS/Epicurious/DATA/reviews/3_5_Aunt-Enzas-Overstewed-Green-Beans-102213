I used 2 fresh tomatoes - chopped after squeezing most of the seeds out - adding about a tablespoon of tomato paste. Also, I used a couple of shallots instead of the onion. And I was out of olive oil and had to use canola. Start to finish was under an hour. I plan to follow the recipe more closely next time, but we were all happy with the results.

I simmered the beans for nearly three hours and they were tender but did not turn to mush, so I would say that a two- to three-hour cooking period is about right. I used canned crushed tomatoes because I wasn't sure what "tomato pulp" was, and I felt the taste was WAY too tomatoey almost tasting as if the beans were sauced with tomato paste. The beans themselves were delicious, and I'll definitelty make this recipe again but will use a lot less crushed tomatoes or possibly start with chopped fresh tomatoes and see if that works out better.

It's fine to say that cooking time will depend on the freshness and quality of the beans, but some HINT would help. Is it a half hour or several hours? And do extra-fresh beans mean you'll need to cook them a longer period or shorter?

I wasn't such a fan of this recipe. My husband thought it was very good, but the tomatoes and pepper overwhelmed the flavor of the fresh green beans. Even though I didn't like it, I made this dish for a potluck, and people seemed to enjoy it.

This is a great way to eat green beans! I used 1-1/2 cups of canned tomatoes crushed up in place of the tomato pulp which worked nicely. I also added some potato and crumbled bacon which was really good. I cooked it for a couple of hours on medium low and the beans were almost all the way limp which was really good. This will definitely be the way I fix green beans from now on!!!

After years of claiming I prefer my green beans crunchy, I am now eating my words. This recipe is really, really good.

The olive oil and tomato pulp make a glorious combination in this recipe, not to mention the garlic and onion. I used fresh red pepper, which finishes it quite well, leaving nothing amiss. Only, next time, I shall make certain no seeds get into the mix (from the red pepper), and will probably use half or 2/3 of it instead of the whole thing. Add the basil and "Mwa"!-Delicioso!

I love these, even the kids who are so picky love these! The beans are so flavorful and tender! Fantastic recipe!

I expected more. Something's missing from this recipe, I think using parsley or dill instead of basil would complement it better. Other small changes might improve it.

I did not overcook the green beans, because I didn't plan well, and the rest of the dinner was ready. But they were good, anyway. Today I took the leftovers and tossed them with pasta, balsamic vinegar, more olive oil, capers and olives (trying to use up condiments). It sounds strange, but it's actually kind of tasty. The balsamic vinegar would be a nice addition to the regular recipe, too.

With fresh ingredients, it is almost as good as something my mom would make! Very good for Sunday dinners..I agree, a definite comfort food!

Excellent! Will make again.

Delicious!!! I used frozen beans from Trader Joe's (that's what I had on hand) and they worked great. I also used Pomi' chopped tomatoes. Be careful with the Kosher salt---a little goes a long way. I served this with Chicken Marsala and it was a great combination.

This was terrific! We've made it several times now and each time it's great. It doesn't make much, although it doubles well.

I'm not a green bean lover, I find them rather tasteless but these were very good. I added the red pepper flakes to spice them up and my husband remarked 3 times during dinner about how good the green beans were. Will certainly make again!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I added just a little more garlic and basil than the recipe called for.

Loved this dish, it was easy to make and a definite improvement on the average green bean. My husband hates vegetables but loved this dish. Highly recommend it.

My husband, who doesn't like green beans, loves this dish! While cooking, the wonderful aroma already prepares one for what is to come. I used 1 teaspoon Frank's hot sauce for the hot red pepper flavoring.

Everytime I smelled these wonderful beans, I returned to a tiny, homey restaurant in Rome. Nothing compares to vegetables Italian-style.

I can't wait for summer when I can get all these ingredients fresh at the farmer's market. I made it every other week last year. It took me an hour to cook everything to "overstewed," but was well worth it. Also, I cut back on the oil during cooking, but drizzled a tablespoon or two at the end, as suggested. Yum!

I tried this recipe, and cooked the dish on med-high for maybe 30 minutes and the beans still seemed undercooked. How long did others cook it to achieve proper results? Maybe my grocery store beans were inferior?

This was very good - I probably could have cooked it longer, but it was delicious with a little crispness to the beans. Used canned, diced tomatoes - I wasn't sure what tomato pulp was. I had to keep checking the temperature; the sauce's thickness was a little temperamental. A definite comfort food!

What flavor! This will become a definite new side dish.

Well again I have to say you made my memories come alive. This dish was one that my grandmother made so many times. When I smelled it cooking and then tasted it the the memories came rushing back. I love the dish and never knew how to make it, but thanks to you I have found the recipe and will continue to make this dish. My grandmother used to add potatoes to it and it was wonderful. Not too many but enough to make a wonderful dish. Thanks again for refreshing my Italian taste bids. You have made me very happy to finally find this receipe.

Delicious! I left out the onion because I didn't have any and added extra garlic (hey, I don't have any room mates!). I also used only a tiny bit of oil. I cooked and covered for 5 minutes and then uncovered for about 15 minutes since I don't like this watery. The flavor was concentrated and very good. What also helped was using tomatoes and beans from the farmers' market. I believe whenver you have a dish that only calls for a few ingredients, you have to use the freshest and best. If I was using winter or canned tomatos, I'd only give it a 2 or 3 rating probably.

Ok I admit it. I like my green beans overcooked, not crisp. This was quite good. I combined leftovers with other vegetables to make vegetable soup the next day (adding chicken broth, herbs, etc)

I really enjoyed green beans this way. I needed to cook them longer than 10 minutes but it was worth it. I made three of the five recipies in this series and my mom "stole" them to serve at her own dinner party!

Interesting twist to a vegetable dish.

Great comfort food, especially on a rainy night. It reminded me that not all vegetables have to be crunchy enough to loosen one's fillings to be considered good. We had this with roasted chicken, scalloped potatoes with parmesan and a loaf of really good bread, and it was wonderful.

I have been making yhis dish for many years since an Italian friend gave it to me. We like it very much and was one which my veggie hating kids would eat.
