Too many cooks don't spoil the broth, but rather make a good moussaka recipe amazing! Yes to the garlic with the beef and onions, instead of tomato sauce I used diced tomatoes and their juices, yes to sweating the eggplant, yes to the Pernod instead of wine, and yes to the goat cheese, but I added it to the bechamel instead of to the top of the custard. The custard texture was *perfect*, and the beef was exactly juicy but not soppy. I erred on the side of slicing my (peeled) eggplant too thin -- it got lost in the layering, but oh well. Still tasty -- I made it with the point of leftovers, and well, you can probably guess the rest. :-)

I made two basic changes to this recipe that make it OUT OF THIS WORLD WONDERFUL! Instead of wine, use any anise-flavored liquor (such as Pernod or Sambucca). Secondly, replace some of the Parmesan cheese in the custard topping with crumbled goat cheese. With these changes in the recipe, I won First Place in our local (very competitive) culinary club's competition. Try this! You'll love it!!

Fast and excellent. I used Japanese eggplants--comes out nice and tender.

I love moussaka normally but found this a little on the dull side. I think next time I'd use more eggplant, switch to lamb or a lamb/beef mix, spice up the bechamel a bit, and maybe throw in some tomatoes or greens or SOMETHING. As it stands, it's pretty good but didn't knock my socks off. Easy to put together. Preroasting the eggplant is definitely worth it.

This is a great recipe because of not frying the eggplant in oil first, but I made changes, for instance, using lamb. I used organic ground lamb - makes a difference as it is less fatty. I used canned diced Muir Glen tomatoes and added more garlic to the meat sauce, added nutmeg to the bechamel. As to the proportions, I used my judgement when it came to assembling the dish. I sweated the eggplant with salt and paper towels, then sprayed with Pam and baked for 15 minutes. This dish came out great - a lighter moussaka, really delicious and not oily or greasy.

Added a little garlic to meat as suggested by other reviewers. You can up the custard to 1.5x or 2x for better balance. 3 layers instead of 4 cooks the eggplant better (eggplant on bottom)and I also cooked the first 2 layers for 20 min before adding custard (then 40 min covered, no additional 10 min- it was browned/cooked perfectly- convection oven) in order to avoid pre-baking eggplant and to ensure custard turned out fluffy.

This recipe was fabulous! My husband and I couldn't stop eating it! As with a couple of the other reviewers I added 2 cloves of garlic to the ground beef and baked the eggplant in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 first. I did not peel it. I also omitted the red wine.

I'd actually give this less than a fork - It was so bland & disappointing. I threw out the whole pan, since no one would eat it. I really like Moussaka, but this left alot to be desired. What a waste of good ingrediants.

Straightforward and relatively fast. Delicious outcome. All in all a fabulous recipe. Worthwhile incorporating other reviewers suggestions - adding garlic, sweating the eggplant and baking it in oven 15 mins before assembling.

This was pretty easy and very delicious. I was a little worried my kids would complain about the eggplant or spices since it's unique. Instead, they gobbled it up like it was candy! I did roast the eggplant first in the oven so it would cook through, other than that, it was a perfect recipe!

Very tasty. I would recommend using 93 percent lean beef, though, since it's very oily otherwise. I also added garlic to beef, per reviewers' advice. I also added cloves to beef and nutmeg to sauce. Overall, very, very rich. I have to admit I doubled the sauce and even though I used two eggplants, it was a lot of sauce. So good, but seems really, really rich. I used skim milk and it worked just fine, so that makes it lighter. Next time: I will use leaner beef and even more eggplant and perhaps won't double sauce. Oh, and I salted the eggplant and let it sit between paper towels in the fridge for an afternoon before cooking. I think it made a difference. My dish was not watery at all. Also: You really have to cook the beef mixture down. When you add the sauce and the wine, it's quite wet, but after cooking on medium-high, it's very dry and ready to bake. The only downside, as I said, is how rich it is. I think it's best made for a party when you won't be tempted to have more than a slice and there won't be leftovers in the fridge.

Used chicken instead of the beef, upped all the herbs and spices, and used a much lighter version of the sauce. It was good. Not as good as it probably would have been if I hadn't lightened it, but good!

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of others and added a bit of garlic to the meat sauce; I also salted/drained then par-baked the eggplant. The end product had a little too much moisture, so next time I will skim the fat off the meat sauce. Make sure to use a baking dish large enough to comfortably accommodate everything- I used a slightly smaller dish, which made for a tightly packed casserole and the bechamel didn't distribute through the layers as I would have hoped. Next time I'll leave the foil tent off longer to ensure a more golden brown crust!

Delicious. Used less oil. Added some garlic to the onions, and a little ground clove to sauce, as others recommended. Will make it again.

I think this is a very good "shortcut" moussaka recipe because it has all the basic flavours and ingredients of the more traditional version. I did make a few changes to enhance the flavour. I added a dash of nutmeg in the meat sauce and 3/4 c. diced sun- dried tomatoes, used only 2 eggs in the bechamel sauce to make it lighter, and used 1/3 c. grated Parmesan, and 2/3 c. of aged Reggiano. Because I really short on cook time, I sliced the eggplant thinly as usual, but saute them lightly in a little olive oil with a bit of salt while the meat sauce was simmering. I assembled the dish using only one layer of each in a large casserole dish and baked uncovered for 35 minutes. It was declared very good.

Rating: 4
I have never made moussaka before until now. This is a great recipe. I took the advice from others and placed the eggplant in the oven for 15 minutes after salting and sprinkling the slices with olive oil, and cut the overall cooking time by 15. I also used 1 lb. of ground bison instead of beef, and halved the wine and parsley. This recipe took some time to prepare, but it was worth it. I will certainly make it again.

Rating: 4
This was light and yummy. My husband has been asking for Moussaka for years, but I hesitated to make it; I don't like greasy foods....WELL, we omitted the olive oil completely, and added 2 heads of garlic to the meat mixture. We did bake the eggplant first, as suggested by others, and we used Italian Eggplant which is supposed to be more dense than standard eggplant. The result was delicious. Next time we will try it with lamb which wasn't available at the grocer today.

Rating: 4
I sliced the eggplant, sprayed it with PAM, placed it on a rimmed baking sheet in a 350 oven for 15 minutes. This guarantees the eggplant will be fully cooked when served and MUCH better. The meat sauce needs some salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves. Great casserole to accompany a Greek dinner or alone. My guests ate every bite, and I was hoping for leftovers....

Rating: 4
Like others, I would call this a good basis for a moussaka. It does need a little spicing up. I use all ground lamb instead of beef and brown and drain the fat off first. Then I saute the onions and some garlic in the olive oil and add the drained browned lamb back in. I double (at least) the cinnamon, add some allspice, currants and toasted pine nuts to the meat in addition to the listed ingredients. All in all, it's fabulous. The raw, unpeeled eggplant works fine, and the parmesan sauce is great.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and I just had to let other users know how great it is. All 3 of my children request it regularly! I don't change a thing and it is always a family hit.

It was a hit after i doctored it up!! LOVED IT however it needed some work (very bland!) so added the following which really kicked up the flavor and it got RAVE REVIEWS from my guests. Balsamic vinegar, worsteshire sauce and granulated garlic, salt, lots of pepper was added to sauce. also chopped up alot of other veggies into the meat sauce (green peppers,brocoli,mushrooms, extra onion)Added MORE cheese (mixed the parmesan w sharp cheddar also) and this now flavorful dish was a HIT. WILL DEFINITELY put it on my favorites list now!

What an excellent shortcut to not peel and pre-salt and bake the eggplant... and it came out just fine! I agree that it needs more spices throughout. I added 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of allspice to the meat, and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the bechamel, for a much more authentic taste.

Was very good and easy. Just sliced the eggplant and did not peel or salt it. Was great with no bitterness. Did not add the olive oil, and drained grease before adding other ingredients.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish - I did add garlic when sauteeing the beef and onion and I had to substitute white wine for red (no alcohol sold on Sundays in GA). We didn't find it bland at all and the parmesan really hit the spot. One change I would make is to use 2 eggplant vs. 1.

Very bland. While I realize this is a shortcut recipe, I would advise taking the time to at least add chopped garlic, salt, pepper and a pinch of allspice to the lamb mixture.

This was FANTASTIC! Wow - it was easy, inexpensive, impressive and fast. It was really a perfect recipe. The guests loved it - but I loved it even more. So - YES I will definately be doing this recipe again. Let me just say that the time in the oven is imperative to get the beef really soft - just the way it should be.

I used a little nutmeg in the sauce. And the best tip I would give is less meat, more veggies. I added more eggplant plus zucchini for the leftovers the next day and it was much better. It was good in its own right, and easy, I will make it again.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I'm used to using ground lamb in my moussaka, so I used it this time too. I couldn't get an eggplant, so had to substitute spinach and it was fabulous...for those who can't get to the eggplant. I also added some gratings of fresh nutmeg to the bechamel sauce. This was so good, I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers.

This is a really good recipe; this moussaka tastes as good as I've had in restaurants. I took the advice of previous reviewers--salting the eggplant for a good hour or so and also draining the meat before adding the tomato sauce and spices, and the end consistency was just right. I used a pound and a half of meat and a bit more eggplant than the recipe called for--next time I would use even less meat, maybe a pound to a pound and a quarter, as there was still a bit too much meat as compared to the other components. I also made sure to add adequate salt and pepper to each step as noted by others, and the end result was not bland but just right. I also reduced the amount of olive oil by about half and added some fresh basil I had lying around to the meat mixture. This recipe is a keeper--very good.

This was incredibly delicious and very easy to make. We had it with crusty bread and Greek salad. Also seems to be very low in carbs and is inexpensive. This is definitely going into my permanent collection!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used 1% milk in the recipe which we felt reduced the fat, but not the flavor. I also did not salt the eggplant and had no problems with bitterness or mushiness. I was told long ago that the problem of bitterness can be eliminated by buying small eggplant. I also feel that there isn't any way that this recipe would serve twelve people unless it was one of many dishes on a buffet. I'll definitely make this again.

Folks - the one thing this recipe is missing and desparately needs is salt and pepper. Use white pepper in the bechamel (the cheese sauce) and be sure to salt both the beef and the custard. No wonder one reviewer thought it was bland. Also, this might serve 12 people who just ate but I multiplied it by 1.5 and it barely served 14. I wish I'd thought to broil the eggplant slices or salt them - as other moussaka recipes on this site call for. I'll try it again though, but with my own variations.

I made this recently for a dinner party and was really pleased with how it turned out. I didn't have a problem with soggy eggplant, but I had prepped the eggplant early, so it had time to drain onto some paper towels (no salt needed). It was easy and tasty and made for great leftovers.

This was wonderful! I used Edensoy Vanilla soymilk, and also half lamb and half beef. I also used a bit more cinnamon than was called for. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious. The custard topping, especially with the added sweetness of the vanilla soymilk was HEAVENLY. I definitely will make this again - but will be sure to have lots of people over - this won't freeze well and isn't as good the second day.

I made a slightly altered vegetarian version of this for dinner last night. Made a nice sauce with onion, garlic, tomato, red wine, the spices and peas. I also increased the amount of the topping by 1 1/2x. (Could have doubled it, really) It was GREAT!!

This was an easy dish to put together. Not too bad in the calorie department either (I used turkey and 2% milk). I had a very fresh eggplant and didn't bother to salt it. The eggplant was tender and not watery. I thought it was really tasty and so did my guest who doesn't usually eat eggplant.

Based on reviews from other cooks, I halved the olive oil, used 1 3/4 lbs. beef and 2 1/4 lbs. of sliced eggplant. DELICIOUS! I salted the eggplant and pressed it dry before layering and had no problems with it being watery. This was a fun and easy dish I made side by side with a special friend.

Rating: 3
This is a great dish to serve to a crowd, or family night dinners. I followed the recipe exactly, except used less olive oil and drained the fat before adding the wine and sauce. Had no trouble with the eggplant going watery or runny as others mentioned. The recipe says it will serve 12, closer to 8 is my guess. All so thought it was better the first day rather then left overs. True comfort food.

This is really great. A nice alternative to lasagna. Definitely salt and drain the eggplant - it works.

This is an excellent formula, but I wondered why it calls for ground beef instead of ground lamb. I see some others have mixed in a little lamb with the beef, but classic moussaka is, to the best of my knowledge, made exclusively with lamb. So, I used only lamb. I happened upon some oriental eggplant at the market, and subbed them for the American type. They worked just fine, and required no salting, peeling, or pre-cooking, so there was less oil to deal with. All-in-all, an excellent recipe that probably deserves a 3+ forks rating. If 4 forks is supposed to be a "dish beyond compare," I'll have to hold to 3+, but it is certainly a crowd pleaser. My 13-yr-old ate it(!), but I didn't tell him it had eggplant in it 'til afterward.

My husband loves Moussaka, but he's Bulgarian and likes it with poatatoes,not eggplant, so I substituted eggplant for potatoes fried in olive oil. He loved it so much, and so did I, I could have ate the whole thing in one sitting, the only change I would make next time is to make extra custard, because it's especially yummy! I cooked covered for 25 minutes and then uncovered for ten more. Perfect!

Rating: 3
Made this last night and it's a keeper. I listened to other reviewers and salted the eggplant to cut down on liquid, but it was still pretty runny. I think the trick is you really need to drain your beef before adding the wine and tomato sauce and spices, which I didn't do because I use low fat beef, but probably should have. Second, I wonder how thick the egglant can be and still cook -- I did thin slices and wish there had been more of a substantial eggplant presence. Next time I might cut back on the meat. I also made this a lower fat version by trimming the oil, trimming the butter to about 3 tbsp and using 1 percent milk. Worked fine.

Rating: 4
Great recipe - not too difficult, either. Made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. Our family is hesitant to try new things, but they loved it as well. In fact, one recipe was not enough for 8 adults and 2 kids - Good thing I made two! I would probably salt the eggplant for 10 min. and then drain before baking to cut down on the moisture in the final product.

This was absolutely delicious! I couldn't stop eating it! I sauteed a small onion in only 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then added 1 package of Yves veggie ground, a soy product (1 pkg. equals 1.5 lbs. ground beef) & one 5 oz. can of tomato paste and 1 can of water. I used fresh oregano and parsley. I roasted the sliced eggplant and also 2 zucchini, using a minimal amount of oil and a little salt. My bottom layer was eggplant, then "meat" sauce, a layer of zucchini and then the custard. The end product was restaurant quality. I'll definitely make this again!

I loved this Great Big Fat Greek Moussaka!!! It was a hit on a very cold snowy winter night with my dinner guests (read "comfort food"). My only difficulties with the recipe were that it said it served 12, but I served it to 6 people (all had seconds) & there were only 3 pieces left over, so I think it would only serve 12 unhungary people....hmm maybe my guests should practice a little restraint? Also, when I took the foil off to brown the top, it took 20 minutes to make it golden brown as opposed to the 10 min.'s called for. Overall, delicious (1 guest phoned the next day to ask for the recipe)!!!

I attemped this receipe for a Greek dinner for my in laws 40th. It was okay - I think it would have been better if I had used ground beef rather than turkey meat. I used ground turkey and ended up having to add a lot of spice to the mixture. I combined a few moussaka recipe's including adding more cinnamon, alspice and a few dashes of cayene. My guests enjoyed it - I may make it again. I did salt the eggplant and let it sit for about two hours adnd the eggplant was cooked!

This was an excellent Moussaka recipe. I did not first cook the eggplant as someone else recommended. The raw eggplant turns into the perfect texture after baking in the oven. Also, I had to add a ton of pepper to the meat mixture, as I found it very bland. But, once I added the pepper, the recipe was perfect.

Delicious and so easy to prepare. Made two changes: I took other reviewers suggestion and cut the amount of beef in half; and before putting the moussaka together, I popped the eggplant into the oven, drizzled with olive oil, for 10 minutes, then cut 15 minutes off the total baking time. I did this because moussaka recipes (at least around here) usually call for frying the eggplants, and adding them raw seemed odd.

I love moussaka and this recipe is easy and delicous. I have prepared this a number of times. I use two pounds of 13% fat ground meat. It also works with turkey. I also add some garlic, use two medium size eggplants, extra onion. I have found the longer I salt the eggplant, the better it tastes; sometimes as long as two hours. I like to saute some mushrooms which I add to the bechamel sauce. Other than that, it's definitely a simple way to prepare a scrumptious dish.

My family has always loved moussaka, but the time and work involved made it a dish I seldom made. This version cuts the time in half and the whole family agreed it tastes wonderful. We will now have a lot more moussaka in our lives, and that is "a very happy thing," as my seven year old says!

I really liked this recipe. I will probably use one less egg in the future. I took the leftovers to work the next day and got a great reaction. It was a little more work than I first anticipated and I would suggest making the meat mixer ahead of time.

I haven't made this but for those reviewers who commented about the watery-ness of the dish, it's most likely from the eggplants. If you slice them, sprinkle some salt over and set them in a colander to drain for a few hours (or even overnight in the fridge) you shouldn't have the problem and you won't sacrifice taste by draining the meat cooking liquid.

Rating: 3
I actually combined this recipe and the low-fat moussaka. I made the first half of the shortcut moussaka but put the low-fat white sauce on top. It turned out really well. It was much tastier after a day or two, though, after the flavors have blended.

My family loved this recipe. The directions said the meat mixture should be almost dry after 20 minutes, but mine was no where near dry, so I drained the meat before layering with the eggplant. Next time, I'd drain the meat after browning and before adding the other ingredients. Nobody walked away with less than 2 helpings....

This dish was delicious. Like other reviewers I used less meat and oil -- a pound of ground lamb and just 1-2 Tablespoons of oil -- and drained the meat mixture well. I also threw in a handful of dried currants (inspired by another Moussaka recipe on this site). Most yummy.

Rating: 3
Halfway through, I found out we didn't have any red wine, so I used white. Per other reviewers' comments, I decreased the olive oil to maybe 1-2 Tbsp. I also halved the amount of ground beef and kept everything else the same, and it turned out fine. (I think 2lbs of meat would've been too much, anyway.) The end result was somewhat messy--a lot of liquid left in the bottom of the pan, probably from the eggplant. It tasted very good, though, and we will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
We LOVE this recipe! It is as good as our favorite Greek restaurant (which is unfortunately 7 hours away now that we've moved). The only thing I change is that I do not use all of the olive oil as it makes the dish too greasy. I probably use about 1/4 to 1/2 the amount called for. If you like Moussaka, you will love this recipe.

This dish is so RICH! I am making it again, however next time I will drain the meat better and cut the butter in half. Also make sure you use a "lasagne" pan so you can spread out the custard thinly, I didn't and I think that was part of the richness problem.

Choose eggplant carefully and you've got a wonderful dish -- even for eggplant haters. I used 1 lb. ground turkey instead of 2 lb. ground beef, and less tomato sauce than called for.
