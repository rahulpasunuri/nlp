A tasty homemade condiment. I used pluots and coriander seeds (what I happened to have), about 5 additional allspice berries, and cooked a quarter of the recipe. I worried a little that the resulting chutney might not be too complex, but the vinegar, pluot-tartness, sugar, and spices combined to make something interesting. I look forward to using it.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written. so easy! It is excellent and I can't wait to serve it with a nice pork roast.
