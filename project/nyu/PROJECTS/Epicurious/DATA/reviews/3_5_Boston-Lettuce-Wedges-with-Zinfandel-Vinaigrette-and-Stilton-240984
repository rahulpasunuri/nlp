It had never occurred to me to eat a wedge of anything other than iceburg, but this lettuce is pretty tasty and was easy to find. I didn't have Zinfandel vingear, so used red wine vinegar I had on hand. All summer I had been using just EVOO on salads and completely missed how wonderful walnut oil is! I store it in the fridge and it doesn't solidify like peanut oil does. Worth the investment!

This wedge salad is simple and elegant. It is perfect for any dinner party or just a night at home. The vinaigrette goes great on an arugula and granny smith apple salad as well. One of my favorites.

Very easy and very good (especially when it accompanies a Christmas dinner where so many other dishes require time/attention). Keep the core of the lettuce intact and it maintains the wedge shape. Made with very few modifications (a little salt&pepper int he dressing; a litte heavy on the vinegar) and it was enjoyed by all. Next year I might add some craisins for a more festive look.

Eh.... it was ok. Good for a basic salad, but not much to it.

The vinaigrette is wonderful, a perfect compliment to the stilton. I added fresh pears, which were excellent. The lettuce did not maintain its "wedge" shape, but it was good regardless. TIP: walnut oil should be kept refrigerated to prevent it from going rancid.

Fantabulous--all the guilty pleasure of nutritionless ice berg & blue cheese with the added nutrients of real leaf lettuce! :-)

Excellent Salad. No way can you possibly obtain equally good results using a white vinegar -- gotta have the Zin. And why the heck did the first reviewer say s/he didn't like 'store bought' dressings? Does anybody else who has actually READ the recipe see anything about a store bought dressing? OMG...it's not rocket science to read a recipe before trying it...Enjoy...

This was an excellent wedge salad. You would not attain the same result substituting a white vinegar for a red wine vinegar as powerful as a Zin (and the O brand is the best)! (nor do I see any store-bought dressing). When made according to the recipe, it is quite good!

This was OK. I couldn't find the Zinfandel Vinaigrette so I substituted with an Italian white Vinegar. I was not impressed with the walnut oil or walnuts. I like a salad with alot of vinegar and flavor. I am not into store bought dressings. I would not make this again.
