I would actually give this dish closer to 2.5 stars. While it was very nice -with the orange and clove adding interesting and pleasing flavor backdrops - I found the cake's crumb to be a tad too light for my liking (I prefer a moister, slightly denser cake). Next time I might add a dollop of sour cream to the batter and bake for 5 less minutes. All-in-all it was a good cake that went nicely with the recommended sweetened strawberries and cream.

This was good, the poundcake did not even need strawberries. But there are still better desserts out there.

I made this for Easter dinner and followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer to use cinnamon whipped cream. My husband loved this (and guests complimented me on it) but I was surprised at how clove-y it was. Next time I think I will try a different spice combination to de-emphasize the cloves. But the cake itself is a great, basic, lighter version of pound cake I'll definitely keep in my repertoire.

It was okay. I served it to 12 people for dessert on Easter and no one commented on it. It was easy to make though.

This was delicious,so simple to make and not time consuming at all. I opted for the vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream. Guests loved it. Will certainly do it again.

This is a truly wonderful pound cake. I made it without the glaze and topped it with freshly-made cinnamon whipped cream and sliced berries. The cinnamon brings out the subtle spices in the cake and goes well with strawberries.

Yummy!! My husband is not a huge fan of cloves so the next time i make this i'll sub cinnamon and nutmeg with just a dash of the cloves. The icing was delicious - this would make an outstanding breakfast bread too.

A really great recipe. I've made this at least a half dozen times now and use it as a fall back when I want something quick and really good.

I made this recipe with a few alterations. We were at the cottage for the weekend and I was missing a few ingredients, so I subsitituted Bailey's Irish Cream for the vanilla, fresh lemon peel & juice instead of orange and 1/2 skim and 1/2 10% cream for the milk. It was great and every one raved about it. It would be great with any fresh or stewed fruit.

A mother's day delight. I followed the recipe exactly and was quite pleased with the results. I debated eliminating the glaze but that extra sweetness was a treat with little effort.

Definately easy and very tasty. I added Grand Marnier to the cake batter and the strawberries. Buttermilk substituted for milk complemented the essence of orange. I also served the cake with vanilla ice cream instead of sweetened whipped cream. I bet creme fraiche would be yummy as well.

Delicious! Instead of using an angel food pan, I used 3 mini-loaf pans. Great for a little hostess gift.

A friend brought this to work for our staff meeting (complete with berries and cream) and it is by far the best dessert I've had in a LONG time. Will recommend it to many friends. Can't wait to make it myself.
