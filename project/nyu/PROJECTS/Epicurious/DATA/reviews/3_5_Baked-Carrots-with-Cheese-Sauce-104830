I doubled everything (more than doubled the cheese) except used 2 pounds of carrots (plus about 3 more carrots) for a large group of 15, and it was really good. Be careful not to overcook the carrots when boiling them, since they cook some more in the casserole dish. This is easy and delicious.

Well, this certainly isn't a healthy recipe, or a fancy recipe, but it is an irresistable and filling one. It is a good way to get the kids and the 'hubbys' excited about their veggies. I used a mix of carrots and cauliflour in mine, and I used half and half.

I make this for a homeless shelter I volunteer at and the clients and the other volunteers raved about it. I used a bit more cheese than the recipe called for, and used Wondra flour instead of regular. Use real carrots, not baby ones. Much better!!!

This has turned out to be one of our favorite holiday dishes. Everyone loves it. I substitute baby carrots for the whole carrots. One less thing to chop and they come out just fine.

I was not impressed. It wasn't very creamy, and the celery flavor was too pronounced. I used flavored bread crumbs which was marginally successful. There are only two of us so I halved the recipe except cheese and cream, and baked it in a 9x9 glass dish. Hubby liked it - good thing since he has to finish the leftovers!

I have to agree with the reviewer who said that this is a great everyday dish...but not for company...I wouldn't make it for a fancy dinner, but this is great comfort food! I did use a tad more cheese. The real test will be when my hubby gets a chance to try this, as he absolutely hates carrots. Can't imagine anyone truly disliking this dish though.

I tried this recipe for something different. It was for Easter and let me tell you.... EVERYONE LOVED IT! They continued to comment on how they were not carrot fans but they loved this dish. It has a very lovely appearance and the topping is wonderful. I used more topping and more cheese. I WILL make this again.

Yuck! This is just as awful as it sounds. Stuffing mix? How could that be ok?

Everyone loves this dish! It is so easy to make. I cut down on the amount of carrots. 2 Lbs is more than enough. Enjoy.........

Delicious.. Jeff the cook concerned about all the cream needn't be so concerned. The cream and cheese both highlighted the carrots without masking their flavor. I also cut the amount of carrots down to 2 lbs instead of 4 and the proportions seemed fine. I can't imagine using the entire amount that's called for. Julienning the carrots makes a pretty presentation. The corn stuffing topping was a perfect crunchy balance to the creamy carrots. Will definitely make it again.

I have no problem using fat to enrich a dish, but a full cup of cream and quite a bit of cheese didn't add anything meaningful to this. I suppose if one is trying to mask the flavor of the carrots in the way people sometimes drown broccoli in cheese sauce, this recipe may be a good way to get kids to eat their vegetables. Not me though. If you insist on making these, do your heart a favor and use milk instead of cream.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was a huge hit. Four of us devoured it all. Going to make it again tonight too. A delicious and different way to prepare carrots.

This is oh so tasty, and very pretty (I julienned the carrots instead of cutting into rounds). The carrot taste is clear and distinctive. Despite cheese sauce, this is not a heavy dish. We served with ham, green salad and crusty bread; made a perfect light dinner. IMO, not special enough for company, but great for regular meals. A Note: the recipe calls for 4 lbs. of carrots; I used a 2 lb. bag of baby carrots and it completely filled a 13X9X2 dish. Can't imagine using more.

A geat vegetable dish for a gathering at Easter or anytime. My son in law like it and he said he doesn't normally like carrots! I made it ahead and left only the baking until the serving day. Makes too much for just two but is great for a crowd and leftovers taste good. Anyone concerned with too much fat could easily substitute low fat cheese and milk for the cheese and cream.

This is now my boyfriend's favorite carrot dish. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix and it was fine. Definitely needs the celery and onions. Very tasty.
