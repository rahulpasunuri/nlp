I like veggies very much and the atoli is a very good different way to prepare my roasted veggies.besides looking nice it also adds to the flavor

I really liked the concept of this recipe, but the final product I found lacking something. I tried including adding some homemade red pepper pesto, artichoke and cayenne for spice, but even that didn't give this recipe the pleasant wow I was looking for.

This aioli is the real McCoy! Good enough to eat with a spoon.
