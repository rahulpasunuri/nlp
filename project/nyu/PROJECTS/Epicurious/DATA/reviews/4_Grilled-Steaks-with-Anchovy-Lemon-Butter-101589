I made this in the middle of winter and used my broiler. After I had a a nice crispness to the steak sides, I put the anchovy butter on and then back in the broiler. I then took out, put more of the butter on and tented the steaks with aluminum for 5 minutes to rest. They will melt in your mouth. Delicious!

I never imagined fish tasting so good paired with meat! Quick, easy and yummy. I used my blender and it came out smooth like butter.

Sensational with steak! A rare four forks from me.

What a splendid addition to steaks. I keep the butter mixture in the freezer and just slice off what I need for my next meal.

I liked this recipe quite a bit. However, I may have prepared it incorrectly by adding the "butter mixture" after broiling. So, I popped it under the broiler for a few extra minutes, and voila--much better looking and tasting.

Love Anchovy-Lemon Butter. And N.Y. Strip Loins are the best -- on the grill or in the cast iron fry pan. But not together. We make a big batch of the A-L Butter for the freezer. What it does for pan fried Sole ! As for a good steak . . . hmmm . . . but I believe everyone should try everything once !

The Anchovy-Lemon butter makes for an excellent topping for gilled steaks, prefferably a porterhouse or boneless rib-eye. I use the recipe in conjuction with a number of my favorite marinades, but find it works best with those in the spicey range. If you don't care for anchovy flavor substitute anchovy paste 1/2-1 teaspoon. the taste is hardly noticeable and you aren't left wondering what to do with the rest of the can. Enjoy!
