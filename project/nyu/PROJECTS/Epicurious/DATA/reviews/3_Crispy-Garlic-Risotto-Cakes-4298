This is a good recipe by very time consuming. The cakes could easily be prepared the day before and sauteed before serving. I used chicken broth instead of water, and mashed all the garlic - slicing soft garlic? not possible.Otherwise I followed the recipe. The result was crispy and garlicky. I served this as an accompaniment to Braised Short Ribs with Carrots and Onions for a fantastic dinner.

I would suggest using chicken stock to give this recipe more flavour I never use water when making risotto, vegitarians could use veggie stock.

Had this as the vegetarian alternative to crab cakes at Easter Brunch. I added very finely diced marinated tofu and some sauteed leeks. Vegetarians and meat eaters went for them.

Instead of roasting garlic, which I find produces too pungent a flavor, I boil whole garlic bulbs which produces a very mild flavor. I added flat leaf parsley to the cooked risotto for color before shaping and upped the seasoning and cheese a bit. Have served cakes with chicken marsala and beef bourguignon. Delicious with both and makes a nice presentation peaking beneath the entree.

I made this with left over risotto with parmigiano-reggiano cheese. It was okay, nothing that great. We love garlic so the flavor was okay, I think it would be better with seasoned mashed potatoes as a spicy/zesty garlicky side or appetizer. I might make it again if there was left over risotto but not likely by it self.

Finally, a use for leftover risotto! I made a nice mushroom risotto and used the cooking techniques in this recipe to make patties, served with asparagus spears and some grilled shrimp. It was great!

Had about 9 or 10 people over for dinner, half liked this. I found these sort of bland. Seemed to be missing something.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. We love garlic so unlike the other comments that suggest it was too garlicky we thought that it had a great flavor. We served this side dish with a main course that included a variety of herbs and spices so the simplicity of the recipe made it an excellent compliment rather than competitor to the main course.

Very good, but not spectacular. Though there is plenty of garlic, I was a little worried about the relative lack of seasoning, and doctored it up a bit with fresh ground pepper and a bunch of different herbs, plus a little salt. With the additions it tasted great! Though the presentation is a bit unorthodox (I would serve these perhaps only for informal gatherings), I liked the crispness--an interesting twist on the usual risotto dish. I would also suggest, instead of roasting 14 separate garlic cloves, to roast a small head of garlic intact for about 45 minutes at the same temperature. This way they're less likely to toughen up and will be uniformly soft. I'll definitely try this one again!

Delicious! The second time I made these I used less garlic. Also, a more flavorful cheese and in larger quantity. I think I used gruyere. A tad more wine and a bit less water. It was fabulous. Most definitely a favorite in our house!

Loved this recipe. Every time I'm planning a menu for a dinner party, my partner insists I include it!!

Really a great way to use left-over risotto....you can make this with ANY risotto. If you don't like so much garlic (I love it), you don't have to put it in. Try it with mushrooms, too.

I rolled the risotto into balls, breaded with romano cheese and bread crumbs and deep-fried in Wesson Oil. Made a great appetizer...guests couldn't get enough!

I'm a garlic lover, but these risotto cakes were overwhelmingly garlicky. They pack enough garlic wallop to kill off Lestat, Angel, and Dracula himself, all with one bite. They would be very good with the garlic quanity _halved_.

I have prepared these several times for guests. They rave about them. Sometimes, I will put lobster with a mushroom sauce on top.

I have made this recipe a few times now and find it easy and delicious for entertaining

I've made this numerous times and it always comes out great. If you don't have time to roast the garlic then just omit it, it still comes out delicious. I make it ahead of time and then just reheat in the oven -- great for entertaining.

I substituted half chicken broth for water when cooking rice. Also added oil to butter when cooking cakes - butter would have burned before cakes were crisp.
