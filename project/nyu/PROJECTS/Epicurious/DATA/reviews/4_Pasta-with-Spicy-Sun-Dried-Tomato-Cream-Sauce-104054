Made it for dinner tonight and it came out delicious. I used lighter cream and add mushrooms, everyone loved it.

This was very good and very simple. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 2 grilled chicken breasts (which I cut into bite-size pieces) and a bit more cream to make it saucier (in lieu of the pasta water). My husband, who has a lot to say about what he eats, called it "restaurant quality". I definitely will make this one again.

I agree with the comments about watching the sun dried tomatoes for excess oil, salt, etc. I rinsed half of my tomatoes for this concern and it came out well. I served it with butterflied charcoal grilled italian-seasoned shrimp on top but not mixed in. Everyone loved it. Being from south Louisiana, I omitted the crushed red pepper knowing that everyone could adjust the kick with seasoning themselves.

Salt content made this a disaster. No salt in the recipe? I checked my sundried tomatoes -- no sulphur dioxide or other preservatives, but 460 mg salt per serving. That's what killed it. This was barely edible. Recipe writer should have noted this somewhere - "check label on sundried tomatoes, do not exceed X mg salt". I don't know what the other reviewers used, but my ingredients were all from Whole Foods and the pasta -- sobbing here -- was my first order of fresh spinach fettucine from EATily in Manhattan. I'm not salt-sensitive; this was just way past the point of no return for me. Pity. It could have been wonderful.

I made this recipe as is. I tasted it and it was a little bland..so I added a little salt...fresh ground peppercorn and two tablespoons red wine vinegar...and WOW did that pull the flavor out in the recipe....Amazing taste....I cook a lot with that vinegar when the flavor needs to be brought out....I served it over cheese ravioli...yummy..... Thank you so much for this recipe...

I appreciate the situation that prompted this recipe, but it is wildly undeserving of the rating it has gotten. It tastes like an en vogue 1990's dish from any of a 1000 Wofgang Puck knock-off restaurants. Fine for a Tuesday night, but seriously, '4 forks'??...

It doesn't get any easier than this. The ingredients really come together well, and it takes so little effort. The flavor is nice, although a bit on the rich side. I added a little bit of tomato paste to my sauce, which really perfected the recipe for me. Easy, cheap, fast and yummy!

Fixed this recipe for myself and hubby tonight just as written. Hubby is not normally a big fan of meatless meals (he's from Nebraska), but LOVED this dish.

When I first saw this recipe I didn't think it was anything special... but the other day I needed to make something tasty & quick. I added a diced small onion to start but otherwise followed the recipe, more or less, and added shrimp at the end & left the parm on the table to be added to taste. Phenomenal! Very balanced dish. The shrimp's sweetness is accentuated by the peppers. Definitely will make it into the weeknight rotation.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe and make it every time we have leftover red peppers or sundried tomatoes. It's extremely easy and absolutely delicious. In addition, we don't eat meat, and my boyfriend pointed out that it is a great substitute for pasta carbonara -- the sundried tomatoes have a smoky flavor and a meaty texture that is reminiscent of the bacon in carbonara, and really gives added dimension to the dish. A total winner that has now become a regular in our house!

I give it 3 stars but all my boys would give it 4. I made this for my boyfriend and 3 guy friends and they all LOVED this. I made it with half and half as well. Next time I would reduce the amount of fresh basil. While it is a wonderful taste, it was a little overpowering. But this dish was delicious and easy to make. Will definitely make it again!!

Rating: 4
this is an exquisite one! We loved it. I did make a few additions to make it into a more rounded meal for the family. I cut a pound of chicken into bite sized pieces and dusted them in flour with salt, pepper and herbes de provence and I cooked them in olive oil and set them aside. Then, I also cooked 1 onion, 4 oz button mushrooms sliced, 1 zucchini, sliced in olive oil briefly. While making the sauce itself, I added another half cup of 2% milk to the sauce before pouring it onto the pasta. Everyone had seconds. This will become a staple at our house. One more note: I dried several large plum tomatoes in the oven last night. To get a cup of 'sundried' tomatoes for this recipe took about 6 plum tomatoes, dried in the oven. It was totally worth it. The flavor is amazing.

I've made this dish two times now -- there is something slightly unexpected about this dish, and it's difficult to put a finger on... I'm torn between blaming the complete lack of heat (and I'm a spicy-food lightweight), and the texture of the sundried tomatoes, which reminded me somewhat of the texture of accidentally biting one's own tongue (minus the pain). It was an odd texture, to say the least, and I think it will keep me from making this recipe again...

I liked, but did not love this recipe. Made it for the first time. Added chicken, spinach, and mushrooms. Also used 1/2 and 1/2 because I could not bring myself to use whipping cream. Next time, I will add some white wine, more garlic, and not use sundried tomatoes in oil: I think the oil made the tomato favor less prominent.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! So easy and simple, and mixture of sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and cream is so good! I also substituted 1/2 & 1/2 to make it a little less fattening. I will keep this one around to make again. It's best served immediately, since it gets a little dry after refrigeration - still delicious, just not as nice for company.

This was a great, easy weeknight recipe! I know it's not really fair to rate something that's been changed, but I felt that the mods I made were relatively minor and stayed true to the spirit (if not the letter) of the original. I halved the recipe but left the red pepper flake measurement the same (we like some kick). Roasted my own peppers and then pureed them before adding to garlic/tomato mixture. Added a small splash of white wine to the whipping dream, and a dash of cayenne for extra heat. Topped with shrimp and a served with homemade french bread. Delicious and so easy!

To tmcdowell from San Francisco, only 35% cream doesn't curdle when you boil it. If you use a little flour with the oil to make a roux, you can whisk in whatever cream you like and it won't curdle. I added boneless chicken breast pieces and steamed broccoli and my son and boyfriend loved it. I did too. It was very tasty for such a simple dish. His mother said the way to a man's heart is through his stomach so I'm set! :)

My husband, the picky eater liked it! He was worried about the crushed red pepper but also loved that. He said I should make it for the next dinner party. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream. The food processor idea is also good, gives it more of a sauce appearance.

I have been making this dish at least twice a week for the past 2 months. Delicious and healthy. I don't care for garlic so I substitute a shallot sliced and cooked in about a 1/4 cup of white wine. I omit the roasted peppers, it was too sweet with them for my taste and instead up the basil to 1 1/2 cups. I also use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream. The sauce is out of this world on blackened chicken and mashed potatoes. It's perfect for dinner after work and leftovers the next day.

I made this for dinnner guests, and with a few modifications, based on readers reviews it was great! I pureed the roasted red peppers, I added a tsp more of crushed red pepper, used boursin cheese(with a bit of skim milk) instead of cream and added a few dashes of red wine. Also cooked some fresh shrimp in the oil from the tomatoes. All dinner guests raved and requested the recipe. Next time I am going to add chicken with mushrooms. Would make again for sure!

Excellent and quite easy. I sauteed some shrimp in the sundried tomato oil with a bit of garlic and red pepper (love spicy foods). Then, realized that I didn't have cream on hand so substituted garlic/herb Alouette (sp?)cheese with a good dose of milk to thin it out. In all turned out great. Will definitely make again.

One of my girlfriends told me that she got her last boyfriend by serving him this dish. How's that for a vote of confidence. This has become a staple at my place. However, I have made some changes. I use parmesan cheese instead of feta. It gives it more of an Italian zing!

Rating: 3
The recipe looks very promising as is, but with a couple of minor tweaks, it became a truly fabulous dish! Two spoonfuls of basil pesto enhanced the flavours, as did a splash of dry red cooking wine. I used half and half cream, and the texture remained perfect... And I added fresh parsley along with the basil. Pureeing the roasted red peppers ensured a smoother texture and made the sauce stand out as more than just your average tomato sauce.

This dish definitely gets high marks for being quick and easy to prepare. I was looking for a recipe with a spicy cream sauce - and this fit the bill. The roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes give it a good flavor - especially when combined with the cream. I added sausage and used goat cheese on top instead of parmesan. If you are looking for a simple and satisfying dish, this would be a good choice.

Over Christmas, we gathered family (16) for dinner at the last minute. My wife fixed a new pasta dish and I tried this one for the first time. Quick, easy and as everyone here has said, a big HIT! Leftovers warmed in the microwave were even better the next day. Excellent for a buffet supper for 12 or more guests. Next time I will add fresh shrimp.

We made this wonderful dish for dinner guests and it was a hit!! There were a few alterations based on the different tastes that were dining. For instance, we used less basil (about 1/3 of a cup), we added about 3 more oz. of cream for a creamier consistency, and we let it simmer longer. We also sauteed seasoned chicken breasts in olive oil and tossed with the pasta. This one is going into our favorite recipe collection!!!

This is now one of my favorite dishes to cook...at least twice a month! I usually add a little tomato puree to the mix plus some Italian sausage. I also recommend scallions. One nice alternative is to top the dish at the end with bread crumbs and little shavings of butter (to help brown) and put put it under the broiler for 5 minutes.

The advice of other reviewers was on point for this one...I infused the oil from the tomatoes with garlic and half the red pepper flakes and sauteed the shrimp in the oil just until they were pink...I pulled them out and then threw in some more garlic, shallots, and mushrooms...from that point on followed the recipe to the t, adding a little extra half and half to make sure the sauce coated everything, and adding in the shrimp with the basil...it was fabulous!

Upon taking my first bite of this dish, I literally shouted out "oh my gosh, this is the best thing I've ever made!"

This was good but not great. I added sauteed chicken, fresh sauteed red and yellow peppers instead of the jar, and shrimp. It needed more sauce and more spice.

Excellent! I sauteed 2 chopped shallots in butter, proceeded to add chopped red/yellow roasted peppers and browned, meanwhile roasting fresh sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and herbs. Added those, tomato sauce plus crushed tomatoes. The key was blending a whole head of roasted garlic into the sauce which helped acheive a nutty, sweet flavor. Reduced with a touch of sugar, added cream and basil. So easy and such great flavor!

I have made this recipe 4 times now and LOVE it! It is great with shrimp or chicken added to it. I eliminated the roasted red peppers the last two times - I just like the sauce without them.

I made this the other night for a quick dinner and was disappointed. I used the fat free half and half as suggested by another reviewer (it was indeed very rich and creamy with no fat!) However, I did not think that the sauce had a whole lot of flavor - admittedly I was out of fresh basil. Maybe that would have added the flavor I was expecting.

Rating: 3
As suggested by the previous reviewer, fat free half and half works very well in this and any other recipe calling for whipping cream. The BEST substitute is "Gourmet Fat Free Half and Half" by Land O' Lakes. It is ultra pasteurized and has the real dairy symbol on the label(they just remove the fatty oil). I live in Florida and this product is readily available in the dairy aisle at Publix Supermarkets, Albertsons and Winn Dixie. It takes the guilt out of Penne ala Vodka, too!

This is a good recipe. I did make a few changes. I added a little bit more fresh basil. I added artichoke hearts also. I marinated some chicken strips in lemon and wine for about 15 minutes, coated the pieces in flour, and sauted in a little olive oil. After making the sauce, I added the chicken strips. I decided it was missing something, so I added marsala (cooking) wine. The flour from the chicken helped to thicken the sauce up. After the changes I made, I found it to be very flavorful. I think by itself it is a bit bland, but basically it is a good recipe.

The beauty of this dish is its ease of preparation. I add either grilled chicken or italian sausage, and both work well. Some fresh peas are also nice.

It really is a bit more than three forks but not quite four. What makes this dish so fantastic is the quick and ease of prepartion with such great tasting results. I used a tube of sun dried tomato paste, which made the sauce wonderful, instead of regular sun dried tomatoes. Next time I might use the paste as well as a few chopped up tomato pieces. This is even good enough to serve to guests even though it only takes a few minutes to put together.

Great flavor - easy to make. I've made this several times. Do not use the sun dried tomatoes in a jar. Instead, soak real dried tomatoes in oil and cut them with a knife. A pain, but well worth it when you taste this one.

Easy excellent dish. I improvised since I didn't have all the ingredients but it was still very tasty. I used half and half and I didn't have any fresh basil so I used dried. Still it is a keeper.

This was very good and very easy to make. I followed the other reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 cream & 1/2 lowfat milk to cut calories. I also used 1/2 sundried tomatoes in oil and 1/2 dried, blanched in water. I also added to chicken breast cut into strips. Next time I will process the sauce to make a cream. I think asparagus would also be good to add.

I used half a cup of lowfat milk to cut down on the richness of the cream, and added 1 cup shitake mushrooms to the recipe. My guests loved it!

This recipe has always been a hit. I put it all in the blender and make a thick cream sauce (adding the cream after the processing). Everyone always insist it is a cheese sauce, so it my secret!

I have made this Recipe for several dinner parties that I've had and the compliments have been endless. I like to Blend all the ingred. together in cuis. then put in saucpan with the cream. I also use half cream and canlowfat milk to cut down on the calories. I like to serve the sauce with Grilled chicken, and sauteed spinich and garlic. For fun add toasted pinenuts to the sauteeing spinich and garlic. Serve right away over hot pasta.

Being the son of a Chef and my Dad was really the Best coming from Macedonia. We has a small Restaurant in Buffalo N.Y. and across the street from all the factories and all Blue Collar workers and I always said for them to desert their Brown Bag to eat at my Dads place that was a compliment and he was so very very fair with the prices. He worked 18 hours a day to support 5 children and I was the only one who stayed with him to help out the family situation. He even made his own Soap for his dishwashing, which we had to stir all day when passing the formula in the Kitchen and it was better than what you bought at the stores. however he always was a Candy Maker when he first came to U.S.A. and then eventually Cooking.Starting at 9 years old in the Kitchen washing dishes to a Waiter and then a Bartender for 20 years, and I really didn't enjoy it at all howeve I was just a loyal Son. These are my credentials if anyone is interested in my background to make my opinion on the Sauce.

Every December I host a "pastafest". We get together with 3 other couples and taste 4 different pastas that I have tried over the past year. This year I was looking for a tomato cream sauce when I happened on this recipe. I boiled two small Maine lobsters and added the fresh lobster meat to the sauce and instead of adding pasta water, I used the water that came out of the lobsters as I was shelling them. Also, I served it over angel hair pasta and the end result was the favorite of the night....absolutely delicious!

This recipe was delicious and easy and the guests raved. I added some chicken to the sauce when it was finished since it was the main dish and the men always want meat. Use a mini-chopper on the sun dried tomatoes. They can be a little too tough to cut with a knife.

Yum! This pasta is so delicious, you'd never know how easy it is. It's become a staple for me.

Wonderful pasta! Will certainly add to my files. Might add more cream or maybe chicken broth next time. Simple to cook, but a while to chop all of the ingredients. All in all, though, a perfect fall meal with grilled Italian turkey sausage and a salad.

A winner! MY dinner party couldn't get enough of this. It can be made even faster by using already prepared sun dried tomato pesto that comes in jars.

This recipe is really delicious. My sauce turned out a little heavy and I wish I had diluted it with the pasta liquid. So I added some of the liquid to the leftovers and had it the next day. It was even better. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for friends - they loved it! My husband had 6 helpings! I used homemade roasted tomatoes and peppers and added shrimp at the end.MMMMM!

I cut the recipe amounts in half and it was delicious. The best part? It took minutes prepare. I'll use this dish to impress dinner guests...this should be categorized in 'best kept secrets' file! Recommended.

I've been making this about once a week. I tried blending the ingredients once and hated it. I use half the roasted peppers, twice as much crushed red pepper, and 2 cups of light cream.

We made this dish exactly per the recipe. It was excellent. Everyone enjoyed it, including my eight and eleven year old boys! We had it along with garlic scampi on the grill. A wonderful combination. We will certainly enjoy this one many more times in the future. TRY IT!

I added 4 more cloves of garlic and roasted my own peppers. This is definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe with a no-cook sauce by omitting the red peppers, garlic, and basil and substituting 6 chopped scallions. I ran everything through a food processor, except the cheese, which we sprinkled on at the end -- we thought 1/2 cup was enough. I also used farfalle (bow-tie) pasta, which seemed to be well-suited for the chunky, creamy sauce.

This was very easy to make and just the right amount of spice. I used fresh red peppers instead of the roasted red peppers and it worked out well.

Does it get any better than this? This recipe is bang bang quick and delicious...perfect for an after-work vegetarian dinner. In my mind, this would also work well as an accompaniment to a bold main entree...grilled or stuffed portabellas, grilled chicken, etc.

Great dinner party food! I use sundried tomatoes with no oil, omit the peppers and add spinach and pine nuts and toss with cheese tortelini. Out of this world.

This dish is delightful and lighter than I expected-- the cream is spread out enough to tone down the richness. I used dried basil b/c I had it in the house, but I'm sure it would be tastier with fresh. Super yummy!!!!

I thought this was a tasty dish with eye appeal. I processed the tomatoes and red peppers before continuing. I also added a few extra spices.

This dish was bland. Certainly nothing to write home about. It needed some sort of kick - which is surprising considering the potency of some of the ingredients. I took another reviewers suggestion and used sundried tomatoes that were not packed in oil so as to reduce the caloric content, and also ran the sauce through a blender leaving it a bit chunky. I would not bother making this recipe again.

Fantastic dish!!! I have passed this recipe on to many friends, and everyone has loved it!! I once added a bit of sauteed onion, nice flavor. This pasta tastes even better the second time around if there are any leftovers. I roasted my own peppers and added a bit more parmesean. EXCELLENT!!

I thought this dish was fantastic. My fiance loved it! I used angel hair instead of the penne, though; and, I also grilled up some chicken breast slices and mushrooms and mounded those on top of the pasta with a sprig of the basil. Definitely one for the permanent recipe file.

DELICIOUS with a few changes. I used dry sun dried tomatoes instead of oil packed and put them in boiling water for about 10 min to soften them up. It worked out just fine. I also blended all the ingredients together as another reviwer suggested. Awesome!

My entire family loved this recipe! I added cooked, sliced chicken breast & cut back on the peppers (my kids aren't too fond of spiciness like I am). I made it for the first time last night & they're already begging me to make it for them again tonight!

This was so easy and so incredibly delicious! I used a box of rigatoni instead of penne and there was enough to feed about 6, and there was plenty of sauce to cover all the noodles. I ate two bowls of this by myself, I mean HUGE bowls. Yummy. Used lots of quality parmesan.

This was a delicious change from your ordinary tomato cream sauce. I roasted my own red pepper and also used fat free half and half. I didn't have enough fresh basil so I used dried. My husband loved it. I think it's going to be a staple.

This was a terrific recipe. I used fat free half n half, a 2 oz jar of capers, and 1/4 cup asiago cheese instead of parmesian, and some cubed cooked chicken and we loved it!

This is a great recipe-- I really don't get the review from Los Angeles where this nut said he or she usually turns out meals "with pizzaz"-- what does that mean?? Very wacky. Anyway, that person must have done something wrong because it turned out great when I made it, and the people I served it to are very fussy.

I took another readers advice and blended the sauce first. Great recipe, and goes with almost and red wine. Another plus is that all the ingredients can be purchased at Trader Joes.

Well, it's certainly quick-and-easy, but poorly named. While I enjoy roasted peppers, they are the predominant flavor in this dish, not the tomatoes. I may make this again, but with a fraction of the roasted peppers.

I really enjoy this recipe. It is wonderful because you can follow the recipe exactly, or vary it by substituting the peppers or the sun dried tomatoes or adding grilled shrimp or chicken.

Excellent sauce -- spicy and with a nice afterburn kick! I am a culinary student who used this sauce for a class project to rave reviews from classmates and instructor. We used 1 1/2 cups of cream and roasted our own peppers.

Ok,this recipe is not all everyone cracks it up to be. It was much too sour with a one cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes. I actually roasted the red peppers myself after seeing what the jar of roasted red peppers was submerged in. At any rate, if I ever use this recipe again; and I'm not sure I would the way it is right now, I would definately put it in a food processor and make a cream sauce out of it instead of serving it with all those chunks of tomato and pepper. It would just make a better sauce "smoothed out." My friends and family also told me it wasn't my finest hour because they know I turn out quality meals with pizazz and this was a dud!
