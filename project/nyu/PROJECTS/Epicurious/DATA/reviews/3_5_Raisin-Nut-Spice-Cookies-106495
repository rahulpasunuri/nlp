I have been making these for 3 years, I adore them. Mine are never cut in perfect diamonds but I love the rustic look. I have been known to double the spices.

This is my favorite cookie recipe. Very European and adult in nature. Hard to cut into diamond shape so I roll balls and flatten. Glaze according to your own like of sweetness. I did not change the recipe and wouldn't think of it.

Good crunchy-nutty flavor. I do think the icing is a nice touch. But, I did not find them durable...in fact quite delicate!!

I used half brown sugar, to bring out the nutty-spice flavors. These were hard to cut into diamonds (darn raisins and nuts kept getting in the way!) so they didn't come out too uniform or perfect looking, but they taste great. I think the glaze is crucial--it doesn't have a flavor, so I'm not sure how it could contrast with the cookie. It just provides a nice texture difference.

A very different and delicious cookie. I did not much like the icing glaze on top of the cookies. I felt it did not blend well with the other flavors so instead I added more sugar to the cookie dough and they were great.

Not only are these cookies absolutely delicious, but they also are perfect for that package from home for the kid in camp or college, because they are so durable.
