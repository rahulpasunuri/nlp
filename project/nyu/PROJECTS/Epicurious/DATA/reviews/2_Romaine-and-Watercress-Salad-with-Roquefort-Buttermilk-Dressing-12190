To the punctuation-happy cook from CA -- where it says "roquefort buttermilk dressing" in blue is a link. click on it and it gives the recipe for the dressing.

This salad was pretty good. I made the dressing with more cheese than called for, like the reviews with that recipe suggested. Then I added some blue cheese crumbles to the salad. Yum! I sort of want this salad to have some crunch too though. I tried toasted walnuts, but the flavor was too powerful for this delicate salad.

Haven't figured out how to make the dressing or rate it??!! How much buttermilk? Or am I just not reading this right??!!
