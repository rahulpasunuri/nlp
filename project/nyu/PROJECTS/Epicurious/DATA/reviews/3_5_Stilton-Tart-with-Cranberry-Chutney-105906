I've been making this for years. I love the tart itself, but am not in love with the chutney. It does cut through the richness of the tart though. MIL asks me to make this for her regularly and has even hired me to make these for some of her events.

This received rave reviews at a holiday get-together. Not having a rectangular tart pan, I bought one and was glad I did; I think it would be hard to cut a round one into small serving-size pieces.

It wouldn't be Thanksgiving or Christmas at our house without the Stilton Tart! However, we use the stinkiest Blue Cheese we can find because Stilton is just too mild for us! I buy the "Cranberry Walnut Celebration" chutney from the QFC Deli. It pairs beautifully with this recipe and cuts the prep time down considerably over the holidays. (And besides, we like it better than the Cranberry Chutney recipe.) And to save time, I use two Pillsbury pie crusts. Cut the ends off of both. Overlap the cut edges slightly, fold the ends under, and then roll the seam smooth with a rolling pin. This appetizer is a wonderful tradition!

This was a MARVELOUS recipe! I bought a delicious Stilton that already had cranberries in it, and this worked out divinely. The cranberry chutney supplied with this recipe is a little unusual (foul) tasting, so I used the cranberry sauce with port and dried figs recipe on this site. EXCELLENT!

This is my favorite "go-to" recipe for a party. It is especially pretty at Christmas and Valentine's. The tart and the chutney are incredibly easy to prepare and can be done in advance. In addition they look so elegant together and are delicious. The tangy-sweet flavor of the chutney is a wonderful counterbalance to the mild Stilton flavor of the tart. Highly recommend!

I've been making a double batch of this recipe for my Christmas party since 2001 and I have people practically fighting over it. Some guests arrive early to the party just so can grab a few before they vanish.

I love this recipe. I'm a caterer, and it is great for individual tarts or made in a large sheet pan to serve 40-100 folks, depending on how large you cut them. I have a difficult time finding stilton so have substituted gorganzola every time. Turns out delish! The chutney is wonderful, and I've experimented with different kinds, from plum chutney to cranberry-pear - all wonderful additions, especially with the ginger. The last reviewer was right, you have to have an affinity towards 'stinky' cheese to enjoy this dish, but after passing out hundreds of samples, I would say that the majority of the people loved it.

Made this for a New Year's Eve party and none of us were impressed - followed recipe as written. I would only recommend making this to people who love bleu cheese.

Not worth the cost or the effort. A few of my guests liked it but on the whole it is not worth it and I throw out almost half of it.

Delicious! Make this for a Thanksgiving and Xmas hors d'oeurve. Make a day ahead and reheat just before serving.

This is a very good, simple recipe. I used store-bought crust, because I am crust- challenged (they just never come out right for me). I also didn't have the tart pan so I used a regular pie dish and cut it into squares. I also used the cranberry-ginger chutney recipe (also on this site) rather than the one listed because of the mixed reviews. A big hit with my quests who are lucky my husband didn't eat the whole plate first before they arrived!

Outstanding! Each part stands alone really - the stilton tart is great on it's own and the cranberry chutney is equally delish!, but put them together and wow. It was a hit at a recent cocktail party.

I've made this twice substituting a strong blue cheese for the Stilton (it's what I had in the fridge) and substituting rhubarb for cranberry (tough to get fresh cranberries outside of New England unless it's the week before Thanksgiving). I didn't change anything else, and the results were amazing.

What a hit! Really not that complicated or time consuming. Must have the chutney with it.

This was a perfect buffet lunch dish which had rave reviews. Very easy to make and definitely needed the cranberry chutney. Will most certainly be made again...

This is a fabulous appetizer. When I first printed it out in Dec. '02, the pastry and chutney recipes were available, but the link to the chutney was not working today. It is an absolute must with this dish. Do not substitute. The pastry dough was heavenly. Do use best quality Stilton. I've received rave reviews of this recipe at each function where I've brought it. It makes enough chutney for using in another dish as well.

I made this as an appitizer and before I could even try it, it was gone. I'm told it was delicious. I made tiny pastry leaves with the the remaining pastry and tucked them into the chutney to add to the presentation. I've frozen the remaining chutney and hope it freezes well as I will try the recipe again at Christmas.

My husband and I love all of the blue cheese varieties. I have made this tart many times and it always gets raves. Apparantly many other people like the cheesy taste. I had to substitute raspberries for the cranberries as the latter was not available. I folowed the cranberry chutney exactly but with the aforementioned substitute.

This dish went over extremely well at our recent cocktail party. Almost everyone there asked me for the recipe. I went a little lighter on the cheese than the recipe called for, so as not to scare off anyone who wasn't a huge fan of that type of cheese. It has become a signature dish for us. Whenever we go to any pot luck party or situation, our friends ask for "that cranberry one..." FABULOUS!

To the cook from California... if you click on accompaniment: cranberry chutney... you will get to it. Everyone's reviews were so good that I'm going to make it for a New Year's day party which is why I'm not reviewing it here.

I used Pillsbury frozen pie dough to make the shell, and it was great. The tart itself is fine, but next time I am going to add more cheese. This didn't have the "oomph" I would expect from a Stilton. The chutney is a definite must. I'm trying to think of other ways to use it.

I cut this recipe out from Bon Appetit, but did not tear out the pastry dough recipe on page 156 with it. I was delighted I could trace this recipe on Epicurious. But, the recipe I printed out does not include the pastry dough recipe used for this tart. I understand that I could use another pastry dough recipe, but wanted the specific one that was used for this recipe. What did others use? Is it possible to receive the pastry dough recipe

Rating: 1
I was underwhelmed, but it could be the quality of the stilton i used (Trader Joes, you let me down!). I like really gnarly, stinky cheese, so next time i'd use good ol' regular blue cheese. I'd also increase the salt amount; the custard has little or no flavor. The chutney was fantastic, however, and essential to the appetizer.

This is a response to the person who asked about the cranberry chutney. Trader Joe's sells a wonderful cranberry chutney in a jar--I would just use that with this wonderful-sounding tart which I have not yet tried to make.

I made this for a holiday party and it went over so so. Partly my own fault though, I got so busy I forgot to serve it w/ the chutney!! Those who liked blue cheese said it was good. Everyone else stayed away. Also, it looked like quiche so those that didn't like quiche avoided it. I had not problems making the chutney, the cranberries popped in the stated timeframe. I also made the pastry dough a day ahead and divided it into 4 portions as the recipe said. Of course, I realized the next morning that for the tart recipe I should NOT have divided it. It worked out okay though, was just a bit tough to get it all back together. I would make it again, just pay more attention and follow the directions this time. :)

I made this dish for Thanksgiving without knowing how many of my guests liked blue cheese, but it didn't matter. Everyone loved it and the chutney. A few even asked for the recipe, which rarely happens with this crowd. My crust shriveled significantly during baking, despite following the recipe to the letter. It didn't matter, however, once baked with the filing and served. Easy to make and delicious!

I thought this was a great recipe-had several comments from guests as to what the tarts were.

I used puff pastry and, therefore, a little less of the custard filling (since it wouldn't all fit). I made a triple recipe (40 guests) and using a pastry bag to add the chutney saved some time. A very pretty presentation and the cranberry chutney mellowed the Stilton flavor quite well.

I made this last fall for a ladies evening get together and even my thin-as-a-rail "may no fat pass my lips" friends couldn't stop eating this. Got several requests for the recipe. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I had people tell me that even thougth they don't generally like blue cheeses, they liked this a lot. The sweet, svaory chutney is the perfect complement to the cheese. I didn't change a thing and will be making it again this weekend.

This is a great holiday recipe. I brought it to Christmas dinner and much of it was gone before it left the kitchen. If you have bleu cheese lovers in the family you want to try this one, but be sure to use Stilton cheese. The chutney blends with the cheese perfectly. You can be sure to see this at my Thanksgiving gathering this year.

Rating: 3
I used prepared puff pastry in place of the specified tart dough, and it worked beautifully. I also add more Stilton,too. If you don't have time to make the cranberry chutney, lingonberries are a great substitute. I do like the chutney, however (I used rice vinegar instead of cider). Serving this as a first course is only tricky if you don't know whether your guests like blue cheese or not; people either love it or hate it.

I made this for a New Year's Eve Party and it went over pretty well. Stilton is not a real strong 'blue' cheese but certainly doesn't diminish the pungent flavor. The combination with the cranberry chutney is great but all in all it won't be for everyone.

Stilton, being a stinky cheese, was a little too strong for me, so I cut it with a milder Caerfilly. The cranberry chutney was a superb combination. The dish received many compliments.

Made this over the holidays. It is very rich, pretty on a platter, but most of my guests just ate one square and moved on to other appetizers. Thats why I can only give it 2 forks.

I was in a rush so used pre-made pastry dough- thus making the tart easy to make and fairly quick. I highly recommend using more stilton though- it is a little plain otherwise. I doubled the amount of cheese which I think helped. I may use even more next time. The cranberry chutney is amazing!!

This is a fabulous hor's doeuvre. Particularly good for bringing to parties, because you can do it all ahead and serve at room temp. Some people had a tough time with Stilton, but fortunately I made another tart with Gorgonzola. To die for!

This was a good recipe, however with no more chutney than you put on each piece of the tart, if you're in a hurry, I would see no problem with useing a canned cranberry sauce. I'll probably be drummed out of the "gourmet group" for saying this, but if you're in a pinch, it can save you time. Otherwise, it was a good recipe and one I might make again for my guests that like stilton (not everyone does).

Made this dish for New Years Eve and used really good stilton. It was the hit of the party and I had to promise to give out the recipe to many guests. Plenty of chutney so if you double up like I did you certainly don't have to make additional chutney. Plan to try the same recipe using goat cheese and serving it with a salad for a lucheon.

"How Sweet It Is"...This was wonderful. The chutney is "to die for". I baked it in a round removeable bottom tart pan and made 50% more filling and used a store bought piecrust, (as I had ruined the one I made last week for the Holidays). Wish I had 3 of the 30 people, I had over for Christmas Brunch to share it with. As Steve from Dallas says; "quit reading and make it".

Made for a cocktail party--apparently my guests are somewhat more conservative than me... My husband and I loved it--the tart and the chutney play off one another brilliantly. Great looks as well--the creamy yellow of the tart, with blue peaking through from the cheese, and the bright red of the chutney. All in all, a favorite for sure.

I'm not really qualified to rate this dish, as it DISAPPEARED before I got a chance to taste more than two tiny bites. Next time I make it, which will be soon, I'll double the tart recipe (it yields plenty of chutney) and hide a big slice in the kitchen.

Great balance of flavors. The leftover chutney was very nice with turkey and on sandwiches. I used a 10-inch round springform pan and cut the tart into squares, which worked just fine. Very easy to make ahead of time.

This recipe was the hit of my party. I had left over cranberry, ginger chutney from Thanksgiving which I served with it and it was delicious. The only problem with the recipe is that it gives no tart shell recipe. You must find your own. I used a cream cheese pastry that you pressed into the fluted pan. It turned out great! Highly recommend this one.
