This was delicious. As an inexperienced cook, I wasn't able to get the lamb of the bone, so I just cooked it with. Eventually the meat came off the bone, so I didn't have to serve it with bones. Probably added some flavor. Only because I already had dried plums and dried apricots in the house, I used those to substitute the fig. The lemon, saffron, and ginger cut through the richness of the rest of it, so it's my favorite of the three different lamb stews I've made. I used the amount of chicken broth recommended, but it made it soupy. In the end I had to add some flour to thicken it. I served it with orzo. Big hit.

Made this recipe for friends last week. Meyer lemons aren't readily available in our part of Oklahoma so I used a Cutie tangerine which complemented the lamb. A soul warming meal for winter Sunday dinner.

Made this many times, with almost all the variations suggested as well as strictly following the recipe. It's lovely every time, regardless.

Wonderful!!! Used preserved Meyer lemons and served with couscous and slices of Japanese cucumbers, perfect with the mint yoghirt. The whole family loved this dish.

Followed the recipe to a "t" with the exception of the lemons -- couldn't find Meyer's lemons anywhere. In any case, the meal was delicious and is definitely going in the "do again" stack. Used dried unsulfured Turkish figs as that's all that Wegman's had. Used organic lamb from the farm up the road. The lemons gave a wonderful light flavor to a full-bodied meal. And serving it over the crispy noodle cake was a nice touch.

Delicious! I used the Black Mission figs. Served it with the Crispy Noodle Cake- perfect!

Loved this. Be sure to use black mission figs though as lighter figs turn an unappetizing color.

This got rave reviews and looked very interesting so off I went to Whole Foods to get the lamb,figs,and Meyer lemon. You'll notice in the reviews that no one followed the recipe, but made their own additions. I stuck to the recipe, even made the crispy noodle cakes and was very disappointed with the overpowering flavor...couldn't taste the lamb, figs, or lemon. Nothing fresh and light about this dish. Was able to finish my plate but threw the leftovers down the drain. So disappointing...

My husband and I loved this stew! Made it as is. Served it over pearled couscous.

This was delicious, and a fun change from the French and Irish versions of lamb stew. I added some cumin and coriander and a bit more cinnamon. We served it with large pearled couscous, which was perfect. I did not fuss with the way they described the yogurt. Used thick Greek yogurt and whisked in the mint: easy and a fine accompaniment.

I made this for a small dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I did not have saffron so I used cumin instead which was also good. I also added raisins and more diced tomatoes in juice. Very easy to make.

I've made this recipe twice and always with leftover roasted leg of lamb. Spring lamb is more tender and tastier. This time, I only had about a cup of lamb so I added one 15 oz. can of chickpeas for substance. I added 28 oz. of tomatoes instead of 14 oz. and used cut up dates instead of figs. The dates are very sweet, but this sweetness countered the tartness of just a regular lemon. My husband and mother- in-law both rate this as outstanding!

Great--so many flavors in one dish! I made a few modifications, some out of necessity, some because I can never seem to leave a recipe alone. I used dried apricots and golden raisins and then threw in some fig preserves; the store I went to did not have dried figs available (!). I also added a little bit of coriander (always great with lamb), cardamom, and cumin (to offset the sweetness of the preserves with a little extra heat). Took the recommendation to pull out the lemon early as well. We passed on the noodles and chose Israeli couscous instead--large couscous that absorbs sauces like this perfectly. Loved it!

Just FYI, not so good as left overs. The figs are too mushy and the lamb toughens up when reheated.

Made this last night with some left over Leg of Lamb. Because my lamb was already cooked once, I simmered it for about 30 minutes (instead of 60) so it didn't get too tough. Served over brown rice. All in all, it was a very tasty dish. The figs are very sweet, so just know to expect that. Also, don't skip the yogurt! We ate some with and some without the yogurt sauce, both were great. The sauce definitly adds a completely different taste to the dish.

Rating: 3
I thought this was good, but not outstanding. There was a lot more liquid left in the pot after it simmered for 2 hours than I was led to believe from the instructions and the photo in the magazine. I thought the sauce would have been thicker as well. However the dish was flavorful and satisfying.

I've made this for a couple of dinner parties and both times I got rave reviews, even from the ones who don't usually like "different" foods (different being anything other than steak and potatoes). I used lamb stew rather than lamb shoulder because it was in my freezer, but next time I'll use the shoulder cut.

This was a very good stew. I had not found a meyer lemon so I added some honey as suggested and I also removed the lemon slices half way through the simmering process. This prevented the bitter taste some have reported. Served with couscous and it was enjoyed by everyone. For those from Ottawa, ON Canada, Byward Fruit Market in the market area have Meyer lemons. Found them after I made the stew.

This is a fabulous recipe. It was better with Meyer lemon, but it's still great with regular lemon. I needed to simmer for 2 hours to get fork tender meat, but there was plenty of sauce, excellent over cous cous. Don't leave out the yogurt -- it really adds something to the dish. And we tend to run out of yogurt before stew, so I'll make 3 cups next time.

Made this on a cold winter day and let it braise in the oven for a few hours (at 250). The noodle cake wasn't so exciting but the stew and minted yogurt were lovely. This is a pretty easy dish to throw together and then let the fantastic aroma fill your house for a while.

I used boneless leg of lamb as well and it was great. Instead of figs I used prunes and also added generous pour of Pomegranate Glaze (from Trader Joes). I added some roasted eggplant too. Served on couscous with a sprinkle of fresh pomegranate seeds and it was a huge hit.

Excellent blend of flavors! I was glad to have a use for my meyer lemons. I used lamb leg, about 4 lbs. Next time, I'll increase spices if I use that much meat. The yogurt adds a lot.

Excellent as everyone attests. For the yogurt I simply purchase Liberty brand Mediterranean-style (thick), add the mint and seasoning and done.

Made the recipe as written, used a regular yellow lemon. Served with couscous with crushed pistachios. Great with the yougurt sauce and the mint. Fabulous meal.

Really great meal time and time again. I use an entire leg of lamb on the bone and cook it in a large Cocotte pot, but any large cast iron pot w/ lid will do, but you may have to cut the bone to make it fit. Bake for 2.5 hrs at 160C. I also only use lemon juice, not the rind and didn't bother with the yogurt. Results are super tender fall off the bone meat in a rich sauce. Thumbs up all around the table !

This is a great stew. I think the cook who found it sour might have used the cup measure for the figs rather than the weight measure. I placed one cup of quartered figs in my scale and realized I'd need a lot more than I had to get it to four ounces. I had no more dried figs, so I threw in some raisins and there was no lemon sourness - just the richness of the figs and raisins with a lovely citrus flavour to balance it out. Yum!

Rating: 4
Fantastic stew that really impressed friends at a recent dinner. Yes, it's worth draining that yogurt! And though I've used regular lemons, the Meyer lemon is really wonderful in this recipe. The last time that I made this, without the Meyer lemon, I added about 1/2 teas. honey to counter the tartness of the lemon.

If I could give this dish ZERO forks, I would. I had high hopes for this dish after all the 4 fork reviews. It smelled great early on in the cooking, but this dish was inedible in the end. The lemon sourness overwhelmed everything, the stew was greasy- even though I drained the fat before cooking the onions. There was nothing I could do to salvage this meal.

i'd have to admit, i was a little skeptical about this dish, especially since i'm usually not a huge fan of stews. i've cooked other dishes from this site that were rated 4 forks, but they've mostly disappointed me. this one is definitely an exception! i made it for a dinner party, and everyone RAVED about it. they even asked for the recipe. i served the dish with cous cous, which complemented it quite well. this absolutely deserves 4 forks!

This is a really GREAT stew! It's summer here right now, and not really stew weather, but a storm was brewing, the air a little cooler, and the mood was right. So I made it exactly as directed while the sky rumbled, but without the accompaniments of minted yogurt and noodles. I used lamb 'rump' which is great for a slow cook and with very little trimming, is totally lean. I too used a regular lemon, added additional cup of stock and simmered for extra 15 mins - perfect! The aroma in the kitchen was just wonderful! There was plenty of sauce of good consistency. I served it with a choice of white crusty bread and cous cous with chopped mint and crushed pistachio nuts tossed through. Everyone just kept eating and mopping and groaning in happiness between mouthfuls about how good it was, until it was all gone and no one could move! No excuse required to make this one again!

I prefer lamb on bone for its flavor. Used local lamb from green market, a few handfuls of currants instead of figs (didn't have them, and resorted to foodsubs.com). Paired with roasted dumpling squash, turnip greens sautéed quick like brazilian collard, and couscous. Worked!

Absolutely wonderful. However, it really isn't enough for six servings. Plan on four servings.

Without a doubt the best lamb stew (or stew of any type) that I've ever made/had/dreamed of. I'll make this anytime I'm trying to impress someone-- and it's really very easy. I used lamb shoulder chops (that I deboned), because I had them in the freezer. I used a regular lemon also, worked fine. I also added a dash of red wine toward the end, which was nice, but I don't think necessary. Make sure you keep it simmering for at least the hour and a half-- it really will thicken the sauce, mellow the lemon, and mature the flavors. I wasn't convinced until I tasted the mature, simmered, sauce. You will need an iron will to keep from eating this all before your guests arrive. Served with fresh bread and couscous.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. It is sooo good. Great with or without the minted yogurt. Served like stew with no starch other than bread. Deviations -- I used leftover leg of lamb and a regular lemon.

After tasting this dish, my boyfriend declared me a "genius." Regular lemons work fine. I served it over quick-cooking cous-cous and it was delicious.

I used organic lamb shoulder, the flavour was brilliant and the lamb was very tender "melt in your mouth tender'. Can't seem to find Meyer lemons in London so i substituted a 1/4 of an orange and 1/2 lemon and with the saffron and other spices, it worked well. The dried figs absorb all the juices, soft and plump. This truly is an exotic dish! The crispy noodle cake ddid not come out crisp though , just crispy in certain parts, so perhaps i didn't use enough oil or the wrong pan. Minted couscous, quinoa or bulghar wheat would be great to soak up all the juices as it is quite soupy, even with 3 pounds of lamb and no extra broth.

Rating: 3
I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs since my husband won't eat lamb and it was still very flavorful. I don't think the noodle cakes were worth the mess or effort. Next time I'll add more figs (loved the sweet crunch) and will make brown rice as a side.

Very tasty and really quite easy! I didn't even bother with the yogurt sauce; though I tried the noodle cake (it was OK), I think it would be great with cous cous. And I used plain lemons.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! I agree with other reviewers that it remained a liitle too soupy. I encourage those who didn't make the Noodle Cake or the strained yogurt w/ mint as written to do so. They both added tremendously to the elegant balance of this dish.

I made this dish exactly as written, and I thought it was quite good. Next time I might try to braise it in the oven rather than stovetop, and go a little slower. I'd like it to thicken up a tad. The minted yogurt was great, and draining it made it very creamy and really added to the overall dish. I served mine with minted Israeli couscous.

Pretty good. I didn't bother draining the yogurt; I just mixed plain yogurt with mint and called it a day. This stew is on the soupy side, so make sure you have bread or a good side for soaking up the juices.

i would absolutely make th is again. Wonderfully easy--although I didn't use the minted yogurt on top. The only suggestion I would make is to cut the figs a little smaller. The texture of the larger pieces was a little weird.
