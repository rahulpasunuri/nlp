This recipe could have been amazing except for TOO MUCH DILL! I like to follow recipes exactly but as I was sprinkling on the dill, I could tell it was overpowering even then. So I left off and brushed off about 25%. Still a little too much now that they are baked- I would cut the dill in half at least, and this is from someone who likes dill. Otherwise, through the dill, everything else is quite delicious! I wouldn't omit the cream sherry- adds amazing faint sweet undertones. And I can see how sauteed kale or spinach would help up the "oomph" of the filling. Also, mine wouldn't bake- had to do 400 for 20-25 min to get teh middle to bake but that might be how thick I rolled everything?

These savory rolls were AMAZING. I made the dough, roasted the mushrooms, and assembled the whole mess over the course of one day, then chilled them overnight. Popped them in the oven on New Years morning - no big deal - and sat happily as my friends dug in and were reduced to silence, punctuated by moans of pleasure. The nitty gritty: for the filling, I used onions instead of shallots, added chopped and sauteed kale, and omitted the dill and cream sherry. I also used a trio of cheeses (aged cheddar, parrano, and asiago). You know, as long as you follow the dough recipe carefully and add lots of cheese, you can probably put any vegetable-based filling in these and they would still be tops.
