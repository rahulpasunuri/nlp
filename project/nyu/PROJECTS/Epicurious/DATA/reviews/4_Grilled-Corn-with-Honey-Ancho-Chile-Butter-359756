This is a great recipe. You can use honey or agave syrup. I added a little extra to sweeten it up a bit when the corn wasn't so sweet. I also have Cotija cheese available to sprinkle on the corn.

Made this today for guests and got rave reviews! Used mexican chili powder since that is what I had on hand. Also did not melt any of the butter, just used softened butter and mixed everything together. Soaked the husked corn in water for 30 minutes before grilling for 15 minutes on medium heat. Soooo good!!

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made this several times, always to rave reviews. My wife typically doesn't like corn, but she'll eat two ears with this butter smothered on it, even my kids (3 & 5) love it. The butter is also really yummy on steak!

We've tried a variety of butter recipes to go with corn and this is my new favorite. We just ground up dried Anchos for the chile powder. I'm sure this would also be good with chipotle or mexican chili poweder too.

What a fantastic recipe! I made it for an improptu dinner for 6 and everyone loved it. Definately make it with cornbread- I used the Sage and Honey Skillet Cornbread recipe without the sage. I also made the Gilled Jerk Chicken. I added some grilled zuchinni. What a meal. I will definately make this one again.

Very good! Couldn't find ancho chili, so substituded Mexican Chili powder and it was delicious! Will try again when I find the ancho chile.

The butter...is wonderful. Will make again and again. Try it! It goes well with the corn, and on everything else.

Good flavour. I loved grilling the corn. The corn looked beautiful and tasted fantastic. My only issue with the butter is that the you kind of feel the graininess of the ancho and cumin. Other than that, we liked it and will make it again.

Outstanding. Made if for our gourmet club and it was a hit. Had trouble finding the ancho chiles but it was worth the effort to find the pods and grind them.

The corn is better if you go ahead and take off the husks before grilling. The heat from the grill will caramelize the sugars in the corn, giving it a wonderful, smokey flavor.
