Used combo peaches/apricots since I couldn't find nectarines. Crust was beautiful and turned out great--thought it wasn't going to come together, but it finally did. Used by-hand method. Brushed top with egg wash and sugar. A little tart, ice cream definitely helped.

My final product was 2 forks but I think it was my fault: my nectarines were falling-apart mushy ripe, and I didn't have kirsch (honestly I don't even know what it is-liqueur?). I didn't get much liquid after maceration, and the pie is a bit dry and bland, but certainly edible. I would like to try again with better ingredients.

I really enjoyed this pie - I was fortunate to find lovely peaches in december, so I made this recipe with them (I blanched them to remove the skins), and left out the kirsch - the pie was delightful, if not spectacular, though that may be due to my alterations. The recipe is definetly going into my summer pie rotation.

excellent recipe! i didn't have the kirch, but it still turned out yummy. was a painstaking process, but worth it. i added just a touch more sugar--perhaps a tablespoon (max), and found the filling to be perfect as the nectarines were very tart.

An earlier poster mentioned that the addition of extra raspberries made the pie a little tart. I served this pie without additional accompaniments but with the correct proportion of nectarines to raspberries and still found it a tad tart. Some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream would have helped significantly. My current guess on the problem was that I could not get the nectarines to produce 1 cup of juices even with the full wait. They produced about half a cup. I'd like to try this again and see if that will change. The texture was great.

Delicious pie! Have a nectarine tree, so I've already made this pie three times. The nectarines and raspberries went really well together. As mentioned by other reviewers, 6 nectarines is not enough -- I used closer to 20 but mine were small. Let the pie sit at least 1 hour before serving to avoid liquid.

This was a nice pie variation and the flavours are really beautiful together. I found it extremely juicy which is not a bad thing, but should have probably allowed time to set more before serving. The sweetness is just perfect.

This was a huge hit at 4th of July and a great way to enjoy fresh summer nectarines. I agree a few more nectarines than you think are needed, but what I had ended up being enough. Great flavor and not too difficult. It was my first attempt at a crust using that recipe and that turned out great as well. Highly recommended!

This was amazing. The texture is wonderful, not soupy at all.I used a regular all butter crust so can't judge the crust, but the filling has a great complex flavor. 8 cups of nectarines is more than 6 average sized nectarines, so have extras on hand, I'd say about 2 to 2 1/2 lbs of fruit.

This is the first pie I've ever made and it did not disappoint. The crust was perfect and I'll definitely use it in all future pie recipes. I did not, however, have enough nectarines (6 medium were not enough) so I substituted more raspberries, which were too bitter for my taste. But with a little fresh whipped cream on the side to temper the acidity, this pie was killer and everyone loved it. Will make again, with more nectarines

This pie was awesome. I brought it to a birthday party and everyone passed on the b-day cake and had this instead. It was pretty liduid--it was great with ice cream, but I might try to cut back on the liquid next time I make it--and I willmake it again!
