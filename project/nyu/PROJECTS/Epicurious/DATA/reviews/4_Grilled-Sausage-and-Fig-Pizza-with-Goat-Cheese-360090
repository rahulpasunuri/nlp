Prepared these for myself and my parents. WORTH the effort! We used Naan instead of fresh pizza dough and baked the pizzas in the oven. I recommend making enough dressing that you can refrigerate it and prepare a second batch of pizzas in the near future...they're that yummy. Now that I've moved to Virginia, I mourn the loss of inexpensive, fresh figs. This recipe is frequently on my mind!

This pizza is delicious! I did a trial run making individual pizzas for a cocktail party and used Arnold whole wheat flax & fiber sandwich thins (separated) in place of pizza dough. It made the tastiest little pizzas. I froze them and was delighted that they held up beautifully, directly from freezer to oven (400 degrees) for 9-11 minutes. The only change I'd make is cutting the onions into small pieces--it can be messy taking a bite and tugging on a long onion ring. I taste-tested the pizza "experiments" every night until they were gone!! Delicious!!

Really excellent recipe. Love love love this flavor sensation. I had cooked chicken sausage on hand, so I used that, but otherwise followed the directions with my own crust recipe. A hint for grilling the crust - cook first side as directed, flip it over then pull it off the grill while you put toppings on, slide it back on grill and close lid. Viola! No burnt crust.

My pizza dough burned to a crisp on the grill but I had spent so much time & energy on the ingredient prep for the topping that I decided to pull some large pita breads I had in the freezer and use them. I heated them in the oven to get them soft, put on the toppings as directed and it was a great alternative to grilling pizza dough.

just excellent. the second time i made this, i used naan which i browned lightly in skillet first, then finished it in the oven instead of the grill. i also carmelized the onions first. the combination of flavors in this recipe is really outstanding.

We really enjoyed this pizza and will have it again. I followed the recipe exactly, well, maybe added a little extra dressing. It was even good cold the next day for lunch...

This was easy and really delicious. A perfect meal for the summer time. One substitute I made was that I brushed on apricot preserves on the pizza instead of the pomegranate dressing and it was fantastic with NO prep time :)

Excellent ingredient combination. Be sure to monitor the pomegranate juice on the stove top if you are reducing the juice to the molasses consistency. It will thicken more after you take it off the stove top.

We burned our pizza dough the first time, and substitute Naan bread, which was fantastic. Our grocery store was out of arugula, so I substituted some fresh basil, which tasted wonderful. The heat of the spicy sausage is balanced nicely by the figs and the cheese. I reduced pomegrantae juice to make the molasses, and it worked fine (except after redoing the crust we really didn't have enough!). Wonderful recipe and we will definintely make it again!

Have made this twice already. Once I made a spicy lamb sausage and the second time used thinly sliced spanish chorizo...both times wonderful.

I have been making the most awesome pizza at home on a cast iron skillet, heated on a full flame for ten minutes, with a raging broiler standing by. Use Mark Bittman's crunchy pizza dough from "How To Cook Everything" and top it with this sausage, arugula, fig, pomegranate, goat cheese wonder, and you will die from it. It is the most flavorful, delectable, amazing pizza I have ever cooked or eaten! It's the world's most perfect food!!!

I have grilled a lot of pizza on my backyard BBQ with all variety of toppings but this version is by far one of my favorites! Believe it or not I had never eaten a fresh fig. Sad but true. My experience with this "exotic" fruit had been limited to fig newtons in my lunch box back in the early 60's. The combination of all the flavors on this "pie" is outstanding... I wish I would have made two! Fantastic. This is going o be one of my specialties... "do'in the big fig pizza!" FYI, make your own pomegranate molasses, its a snap.

We made this for dinner tonight, and it was amazing. Instead of grilling it (our little grill is too small for pizza), we made it in the oven at 500 degrees and just grilled the sausage. We used sweet Italian sausage from Trader Joe's, as well as their prepared pizza dough. I cut the recipe for the dressing in half and ended up using about half of that on the pizza. I brushed some on the stretched out dough, baked it for 4 minutes, then added more dressing and the fontina, onions and figs. I baked it for another 8 minutes, then added the goat cheese and arugula. Very tasty!

The combination of ingredients in this recipe is really outstanding...the sweet and salty really come together nicely. The pomegranate-cumin dressing is easy to make (the recipe is under the grilled sausage recipe) and carmelizes very nicely on the grill...I added about a tablespoon extra pomegranate molasses to up the sweetness. Keep in mind the arugula will shrink down a lot on the grill, so add lots. Very tasty and looks fantastic on the plate!
