If you are having trouble finding Cope's Dried Corn in your local stores, you can always order directly from John Cope's at www.johncopes.com

This recipe is very easy. The results are delicious. This dish is one of the most popular at the T'day table.

I made this for the second time recently, and because I used a bigger baking dish, the mixture was more spread out, and I accidentally overcooked the pudding a bit, even though I reduced the cooking time. Once overcooked, it was just okay, but didn't have the amazing custard-like texture on top contrasted with the chewy corn on the bottom. So if you're going to make this, make sure you are very careful about the depth of the pudding/cooking time! It's not very forgiving.

This is absolutely delicious and easy to make. It is super rich due to the whole milk, butter and buttermilk. A little goes a long way as a side dish. I noticed that it did bubble over slightly in a square 2 qt. dish, causing some dripping and smoking in the oven. Next time I'll put a sheet of foil under the casserole dish.

This was very good. I ordered a dozen corn packages and gave some to friends with this recipe. For our Christmas party, I made a double batch,but never got a taste of it, it was gone so fast. Made it again for a smaller group to finally get a taste. This makes a Lot!

I made for thankgiving for the first time. I found it to have an unusual and savory texture which complemented the meal. The recipe noted that many recipes suggest grinding the corn, I think Ill try next time. the generalstore was very expensive to ship.Instead, I tracked down the manufacturer - minimum shipment 3 bags but very reasonable shipping cost and ground shipment reached me the next day in MA.

I ordered to Cope's corn and made this for Thanksgiving. I was very disappointed. The texture was very strange.. dry and crumbly. Not at all what I expected. I'm looking for another corn pudding recipe to try.

I ordered just one package of the cope's corn from pageneralstore.com, for a Thanksgiving side. The pudding was super easy and a big hit with adults and children alike. I think it would be nice at brunch as well. The shipping was expensive, took a long time, and the PA general store people weirdly required a signature with UPS for delivery, which was super annoying because I am not home all day to receive corn packages. However, I totally loved the result, so I will minimize annoyance/cost in the future by placing a big order to keep on hand. If the recipe sounds like it's very much to your taste and you would make it repeatedly, then I'd say order multiple packages. Otherwise, it's probably too expensive for a one time lark. If the corn is available at your local specialty store, that seems like a good way to go as well.

I first tried Cope's when I was in Pennsylvania last year - a friend cooked it up and I brought a few boxes home (and have my friends send it to me as well!) This was nice! I made it a touch sweeter (Splenda) just because I happen to like dishes like this a bit on the sweet side.

Be sure to check out the "where to shop" section - it states exactly how to order it. www.pageneralstore.com Since it is spendy and time consuming to get the Cope's Corn, I gave this recipe 3 forks. Otherwise, quite tasty! And a nice addition to veggie portion of Thanksgiving. As a test, I purchased dried corn locally at the organic store bulk food section and compared it to the Cope's corn once it arrived - one would have to grind up the full kernels in a mill to have it be the same. And not sure how it would taste either - so I'm sticking with Cope's corn. Like other post, people do ask for the recipe ... yummy if I say so myself!

How can you post a recipe in which the main ingredient is impossible to purchase. I have called 2 local gourment food markets, Whole Foods and Publix Greenwise Market and am unable to find the main toasted dried corn ingredient???? Any idea where it can be purchased?

Made this last night for a small dinner party. No one left without a copy of the recipe.Finding the Cope's corn was not difficult at a specialty store. If you can't get it, don't make this. The toasted dried corn gives a unique but accessible delicious flavor. I rarely feel this kind of enthusiasm. Easy. Simple...once you have the toasted corn. Thank you!!!!

I planned on making this for Thanksgiving and did a trial run last night. Ordered the Cope's Corn and followed the recipe exactly. Not exceptional in taste/texture and certainly not worth the time and cost of ordering the special corn.
