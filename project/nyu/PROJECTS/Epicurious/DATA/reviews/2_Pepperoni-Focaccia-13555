I used to manage a restaurant in a major shopping mall...one of our part time grill men gave me a recipie for pepperoni or sausage stuffed bread...I made two wheels of it for our super bowl party and it was gone before what I considered outstanding foods made by my employes...it is so simple to make...go to a local pizzerea and buy fresh pizza dough...roll it flat and stuff it with thin slices of peperonni or sausage...roll it a bit and add chopped motzerella cheese...repeat the process until the dough is full...roll it into the shape of a half moon...coat the bread with a little egg white to brown properly and bake at 350% until it is golden brown...let rest for about ten minutes and serve sliced with ice cold beer as an appetizer....also a little dipping pasta sauce
