My children (12-15) have begun picking out recipes that either they cook or I cook. This is one they picked. Although I had most of the ingredients on hand (with a few substitutions, broccoli instead of yau choy-and I was actually out of bacon, but had some procuitto on hand from another recipe)- this is easy and easily fed 5 with some leftovers.
