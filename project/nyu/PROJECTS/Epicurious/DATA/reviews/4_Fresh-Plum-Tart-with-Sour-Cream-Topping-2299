Great, and easy. No need to brush with egg or even make cream topping -- rich enough as is. Knott's Berry Farms makes plum preserves if you're having a hard time finding them.

There were groans of plesure at the table when this was eaten. I used 1/2 Granny Smith apple with the plums; I used 6 TB sugar rather than 7; I used apricot preserves instead of plum. I'll make it again.

Being something of a puff-pastry novice, I was surprised to see just how much the tart border actually did puff up-- the method certainly works for creating a square tart quickly. The saved effort gets made up in the eating, however, since it's a bit challenging to slice the tart after baking. I think puff pastry is best used when cut into smaller, individual-sized portions. Underbaking it slightly might also help. It's easier to slice between the plums (depending on how you've arranged them), but that might change the number of servings you can offer. Another recommendation: use reduced-sugar preserves, since the tart doesn't really need much extra sugar. Because the nuts didn't add much, I omitted them on the second try and didn't miss them at all. The sour cream topping provides an excellent counterpoint to the tart flavor of the plum. Overall, a very good dish that I think might work better as tartlets.
