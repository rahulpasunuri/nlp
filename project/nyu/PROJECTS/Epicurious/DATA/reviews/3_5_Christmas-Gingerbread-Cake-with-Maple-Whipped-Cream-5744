when i made this recipe i doubled it (to fit a hotel pan at work) and i omitted the orange zest and candied ginger. this cake was so moist and flavorful! i will make this recipe again and again.. and possibly add the zest and ginger! yum!

After reading the reviews of this cake I decided to change the recipe a bit. Reading that it was a dense cake I changed into it a chiffon of sorts. I used vegetable oil instead of butter, white sugar in replace of brown sugar. Then I separated the eggs. 3 yolks like it calls for and added an extra 3 whites, totaling 6 whites. After all ingredients were added, whip the whites and fold in. With these changes the cake comes out much airy and fluffy but still has the spiciness of gingerbread!

The gingerbread fans in the family were in heaven. Now make this every year.

This was a great dessert! I didn't have light molasses so I used what I had, and it turned out fine. It is a dense cake, but served with the marvelous maple whipped cream, it was a hit of my family's Christmas.

Considering the 86% rating on this cake I was very disappointed. Shame on me for foregoing my pretesting rule, but I got slammed this time. My guests were gracious but no one asked for the recipe. They did rave about the sugared walnuts I sprinkled over each piece and the maple whipped cream is to die for. I'll definitely make the topping again for a pecan or pumpkin pie. The cake is mediocre...I've had better.

I found this cake a bit too sweet, but loved the combination of the maple and the ginger. I did find the cake a little too heavy, but my cousin won't stop asking me to make it again, so it will end up making an appearance at the holidays this year.

This cake was great! I made it in a 9" x 13" pan and added the whipped cream on top of individual pieces instead of frosting. I will definitely make it again.

I have made this cake several times and was asked, at the last minute, to make this for Christmas at my parent's house. Also at the last minute, I discovered that they had no layer cake pans, and I am happy to be able to report that it works extremely well as a Bundt cake. Be sure to serve it with plenty of whipped cream as it is just dry enough to need it for dessert (although it is incredible without for breakfast, tea, and snack!) A great and very ginger-y cake. It's nowhere near as light as an angel food cake, but who said every cake needed to be?

Although it looked great and tasted pretty good (loved the maple whipped cream) the cake itself was too dense and heavy. Not sure if it is just the recipe or if I did something to cause it, but the cake was like a brick. Good flavor though.

This cake was delicious! The maple whipped cream was the perfect compliment to the gingerbread and the crystallized ginger added great flavor! It also made my house smell wonderful! Perfect for the holidays.

I made this as desert for Christmas dinner. I doubled all the spices and tripled the crystalized ginger and right when it came out of the oven I poked holes in it and soaked it with a cup of spiced rum. It was delicious!

Clove and Molasses flavour was too strong and the cake tasted burnt. I am looking for real gingerbread flavour. I love ginger and crave it. I want a strong ginger flavour, a moist cake that does not have a strong molasses taste either. If anyone has a great gingerbread cake or even a really great spice cake recipe that is moist! Please send it to me at Cathlicgla@aol.com, Please.

The cake was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I thought the candied ginger was a wonderful touch. I modified the instructions by baking it in a 8" sqare pan and making four layers (like a torte). It worked great.

I would diffently make this cake again - but next time I'd cut the ground ginger by at least half, I'd also cut the clove and nutmeg alittle. It was very RICH, and had a STRONG ginger taste.

As others have said this cake is great! I didn't have any orange peel left to garnish with so I smoothed the frosting and dusting the top with nutmeg and sprinked matchsticks of crystalized ginger over it. It was very nice and the nutmeg smelled so good.

The visual effect of my version of this cake received an enthusiastic response at the Christmas party--everyone liked the taste, too. I baked two 9" rounds, sliced them in half and wound up with a 4 layer torte. The frosting was not sufficient to completely cover the size of cake I wound up with, so I just generously slathered the whipped cream in between the layers which made a nice color contrast between the dark gingerbread and the light-colored whipped cream.

This cake was a hit after Thanksgiving dinner. I never even got to have seconds! To make handling easier, I baked two layers individually for 30 minutes. The three cups of whipping cream made way too much for the cake, so I saved the extra amount for pancakes. Also, since I didn't have any maple syrup available, I made some with brown sugar, water, maple flavoring and vanilla. Worked great.

I made this for a birthday dinner last weekend. It got raves for its fresh taste and it easily fed 20 people after a big meal.

I made this for Christmas dinner 1998, and my family is STILL talking about it. Unfortunately, I had a terrible cold at the time so I could barely taste it myself. . .But I'll definitely try it again this year!
