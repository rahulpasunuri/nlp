I would like to point out that there is another version of this recipe at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chicken-Marengo-109306 However, both fail to include the eggs and shrimp that are part of the original, traditional recipe. This one definitely needs garlic as well. Eggs and shrimp might seem odd, but they are essential to the true Marengo recipe.

This is an easy to make and yummy recipe. I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and added fresh chopped garlic and basil; did not add the butter - it turned out very nice and will definitely make it again, and again.

I make this dish all the time! It is fool proof. Perfect when company unexpectedly drops in.

My husband and I liked this recipe and will make it again but it wasn't out of this world.. easy, yes.. good, yes...great, no. I made it a second time with fire roasted canned tomotoes and it gave it an additonal flavor. Without this additional flavor we found it a bit bland. Adding artichoke hearts or something with some tangy flavor could make it better.

Love this dish! My secret is substituting portabellos for regular button mushrooms. Otherwise, I follow the recipe and it's a hit with everyone in my household.

The best chicken recipe ever. I served it to guests and took it for my lunch for several days. Am making it again today.

This was easy to prepare, especially on a busy weeknight, but I found the flavor a little dull. I did add fresh basil and garlic, with little success. Not something I would try again.

Absolutely delicious. I used chicken thighs and they were perfect for this recipe. Based on the reviews below, I used one 14-1/2 oz can of chopped tomatoes (undrained) and added minced fresh rosemary and bay leaves. I added the pearl onions to the skillet right after I removed the chicken and before I added the mushrooms, this allowed the pearl onions to brown and slightly carmelize which added beautiful flavor to the dish. Served with good bread, this will be a regular at our house!

Quick, easy and wonderful

This was delicious! I used a fresh chicken and brined the chicken pieces for an hour or so, used shallots instead of pearl onions, threw in a couple bay leaves and a few sprigs of fresh thyme. The sauce is amazing, we went through a whole baguette just from dipping! I think the fresh chicken on the bone is important to add flavour to the broth.

I made this dish with chicken thighs and they turned out rather soggy. For this reason, the next time I'll definitely use boneless skinless chicken breasts. Sauce was tasty. Added basil and garlic for some more flavor, per other reviewers suggestions.

I tried most of the suggestions made by other cooks and still found this dish lacking in flavor. I will be adding tomato sauce or paste to the leftovers as a last ditch effort.

This was good. It didn't knock us out, but it was incredibly convenient, and for that reason, I imagine that we will make it again.

Deliciousas written. Better with fresh basil and two mashed garlics sauteed with the onion and tomatoes.

This chicken was wonderful! Like other reviewers, I used chopped onions and canned tomatoes. I also added a little minced garlic. It was so easy and unbelievably tasty!

This is an easy and excellent dish; it's one of my stand-bys, especially for busy nights. I have made it for several friends, who have all requested the recipe. I make a couple of changes -- I use boneless chicken breasts, canned chopped tomatoes, and a large, coarsely chopped white onion.

Incredible that a dish so fast, so easy, with such simple ingredients, can attain such complexity and depth of flavor, and such elegance in appearance! Since the first time I tried this, it has become a staple of my kitchen, good especially for evenings when time is short. Often I use canned diced tomatoes and boneless cuts of chicken, though I compensate by adding a little chicken stock to the pan. I like to serve it with spinach gnocchi (easy to make after a little practice), though pasta works just as well.

It was really good the night before, but today when I went to have it for lunch it had some gnarly congealed fat that was not so appetizing. I know that's what happens when you refrigerate chicken with skin on it, but it just wasn't pretty to look at. Next time, I will remove the skin before serving.

Outstanding! As an Army Reservist I was facinated with the historical aspect of this receipe which drew me in. Living here in New England this delicious meal is just right on a cold night. We serve it with a couple of loafs of Julie's French bread to soak up the rich juices. I substitute the chicken with venison and it becomes the toast of the evening at our annual game dinner. Always sought after as a repeat winner-dinner.

I just love this dish! It's so simple but delicious. The parsley and the wine are indispensible, but I substitute chicken breast with no problems.

After reading all these reviews, maybe I got my hopes up too high. I thought this was OK, but there are many, better recipes on this site. I preferred the sauce with Linguine with Tomatoes and Artichokes (also on this site); the chicken part of this dish was good though (I used boneless breasts).

I love the one-pot aspect of this recipe. I serve it over a bed of rice so that none of the delicious juices go to waste. This is a good dish for entertaining because the pearl onions and wine make it elegant yet is hearty enough to be appetite satisfying.

Really good! I did sustitute a couple of items. Since it's Vidalia onion season, I sub'ed a chopped Vidalia for the pearl onions. Also, I used a can of Italian-style stewed tomatoes, and threw in a couple of cloves of garlic (which I sauteed up with the onions). I would gladly serve this recipe to company!

First had it at my Mom's. Loved it. Made it at home later. Not as good as Mom's, byut still great!!! Served it twice to guests and received rave reviews!!

This is so good! I substituted four boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, and shortened the after-work preparation time by using a jar of drained pearl onions and a can of diced tomatoes. Being of the opinion that pasta goes with everything, I served it with linguine tossed with some of the sauce.

Terrific dish. Quick to make, easy cleanup. good for company - made it with non-alcoholic wine-chardonnay and it was terrific. Have served it twice now to guest and received raves. served only with green salad and lots of italian bread and a very simple dessert(strawberries in whipped cream). Try it - you will love it.

Delicious! Substituted chicken breasts for the whole chicken without much apparent difference. The recommended wine is extremely expensive -- we downgraded to something like a chianti. Don't forget the bread!
