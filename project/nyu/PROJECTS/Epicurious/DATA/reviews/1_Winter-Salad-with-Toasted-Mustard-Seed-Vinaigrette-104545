I agree that this recipe was a dud. It really lacked flavor. It's exactly the kind of recipe you want to stay away from in the winter--monochronomatic and dull in flavor.

I made this for a dinner party this weekend and thought it was quite boring. I cut the recipe in half for 8 people it could have served 12. The dressing recipe is skimpy and should actually be tossed with the greens before serving. Also the quantity of flat leaf parsley was too much. The parsley flavor really came out.
