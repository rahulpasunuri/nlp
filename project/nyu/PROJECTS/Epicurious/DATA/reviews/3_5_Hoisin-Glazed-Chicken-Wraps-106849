loved this, everyone in my family did! I made this as lettuce wraps just as recipe calls for. Then put a bit of hoisin in a large iceberg leaf, topped with chicken mixture and chopped cilantro. Added cashews for extra crunch. The flavors were great and it was a quick meal. I may try it as the previous reviewer mentioned, chilled as a grab and go dinner.

Very good meal for nights when everyone's on a different schedule. I added 1 tsp sriracha sauce and 1/4 cup peanuts to the pan with the hoisin. Also added julienned cucumbers as a topping. Rolled them all up, cut them in half, put them on a platter and chilled them. Everyone ate as they got home from the evening's activities, and everyone thought they were great!

Simple, quick, and bursting with flavor. I did add 1/2 C. chopped cashews before serving. Perfect for when you don't feel like making something time-consuming. Not a morsel left.

After having this in my recipe box for a while I finally made it last night. It was a hit. I thought it needed a little kick, and "garlic chili sauce" just popped into my head - and I see that's already been suggested. I definitely think I'll do that next time.

Everyone loved it, even my 13 and 16 year olds! It's a definite winner and wil be made again.

I also used the lettuce to wrap, and not in the actual preparation, and gave the hoisin sauce some punch with some hot pepper sauce and threw sesame oil and soy sauce in too for good measure...

Sounded like a great idea, but it was just missing something, it needed a little zip. Perhaps some red pepper and crushed red pepper?

We made these into lettuce wraps, to cut the carb content. It was delicious! We added spicy chili garlic sauce (in the Asian foods isle of the supermarket) and just wrapped the finished product in leaves of iceberg lettuce. Wonderful, and so quick!

Liked the idea, and liked the taste except for the lettuce. I found it to be a jarring note, so will probably substitute a chopped cucumber and/or can of water chestnuts for some extra texture and interest. I also sauteed the chicken and garlic in peanut oil to give it a little extra zing and I liked that a lot. Probably be a 3 fork recipe with the aforementioned changes, but it definitely gets 5 forks for ease and speed.

I made this for my family and it was very good! I only gave it 3 forks because we didn't care for the fresh cilantro. I did add roasted sesame seeds and red pepper. I will definetly make this again. Even my 6 year enjoyed this!

I doubled the recipe and added steak to the mix. It was a good dish. I also substituted the tortilla with flat bread-buttered and warmed. It was a crowd pleaser without too much difficulty.

This is very tasty and easy to make! I sauteed some peanuts with the chicken and added celery to the vegetable. When assembling the wraps I also added some cold chopped cucumber. It is a great weeknight dinner & I have made it 3 times in the past month or so.

I took one of the reviewer's advice and put this on top of rice. Added snow peas and red pepper and roasted seasme seeds on top. Great!

This is a quick and easy recipe and very tasty. The whole family enjoyed this. I sliced a quorn fillet then cooked it the same way for my vegetarian daughter.

These were very good wraps; they were quick and easy and unbelievable tasty for something with so few ingredients. Next time, I'll try it on a bed of white rice rather than in a tortilla.

I loved this recipe as well as the results, however, it didn't go over well with my 3 and 5 year old children. My husband didn't love the lettuce inside the wrap, either. I'll have to eat it all myself next time if I make it again.

Quick, easy and excellent flavor. Next time I may add some vegies for a variation.

For a couple looking for a quick and tasty meal during the week, this was perfect. The flavor and ease to make made this into our permanent recipe book for future meals. Highly recommended.

My four-year-old said, "Mom, you have to make this sandwich again, OK?" And anything that elicits that sort of response from her gets, in my book, an automatic four stars. Next time I might try adding some chopped roasted cashews for a little crunch, but it's perfectly good as is.

This was great - nice blend of flavors, nothing too overpowering. I might add chopped peanuts and a dash of dried red pepper flakes, but it's fine as it is! Great on a hot night as it is a fast meal to cook and easy too.
