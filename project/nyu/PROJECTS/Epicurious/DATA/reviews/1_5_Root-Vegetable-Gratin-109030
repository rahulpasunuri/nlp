I substituted a handful of spinach, a broccoli stalk and a third of an onion for the celery root. I also used chedder instead of gruyere, and added a half cup of feta. I also added a cup of breadcrumbs to the mixture. I didn't let the cream go down to 3/4 of a cup. I also used a couple tablespoons of chives instead of thyme. I thought it was decent, but my boyfriend LOVED it.

I like bland food. It isn't that this is bland so much as way too heavy for the subtle tastes of the vegetables. I really can't imagine anybody liking this.

Made this dish for Christmas as one of the side dishes. Followed the recipe exactly, very bland, very disappointing. Wouldn't make again.

I made this as a vegetarian element for a ham holiday dinner. I had to use parsnips because my store was out of celeriac. I would not recommend this dish. It was very dry (even adding another 1/2 cup milk) and tasted somewhat like warm cole slaw. There is not enough cheese in the recipe to be noticeable.
