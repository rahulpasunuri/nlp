If you parcook your vegetables in salted water, be careful of the salt in this recipe. I'd also like to remind you to strain the juice before adding it to your vegetables!

I used this juice to pickle beets. Love the combination of orange and beet flavors so I added the rind of an orange to the mix - yummy!

Great flavour, but too salty (so salty it makes the mouth ache)! I would use half the salt next time.

This is the best pickling juice I have ever made. I used it with beets but I look forward to using it with other veggies as well. Great flavor!

Great recipe for pickling veggies and more. I used a habenero pepper in place of the jalapeno which I did not have. Gave a nice and "warm" taste to my pickling juice.

This recipe is the best pickling juice I've tried. I made it with beets and used the beet cooking juice.. I marinated them overnight and served them for Thanksgiving... They are great!
