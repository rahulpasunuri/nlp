The concept was good, but it didn't translate into reality. The ice cream was brown and more like ice milk than ice cream despite the fatty yolks and cream. Perhaps that's why banana ice cream isn't a big seller to begin with. I'd take strawberry over this flavor anytime.

I substituted half and half for the whipping cream and increased the rum by a tablespoon. Turned out great with a good flavor and creamy texture. Will definitely make again, perhaps adding walnuts and/or bittersweet chocolate chips.
