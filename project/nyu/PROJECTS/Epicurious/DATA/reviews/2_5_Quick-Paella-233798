While I can recognize that this is not a traditional paella, I thought it was a wonderfully delicious and very quick meal to make. Will definitely make it again.

Having been raised in a Spanish household, where a paella was as common as cereal for breakfast, I would recommend passing this recipe up. Polish sausage is not intended for a Spanish dish - use chorizo or if you're lucky enough to have a Spanish or Basque community around - txistera is also phenomenal. all the meats and shellfish should be done al ajillo. anyways, I could just go on and on...

aaah! i was looking for a paella recipe to inspire dinner and thought 'quick paella' would be close to my usual paella preparation. i may be spoiled with fresh seafood at my local, urban market, but frozen onions? this dish is so far from the beautiful , highly regionalized idea of what paella is, i would recommend anyone interested in learning to make paella skip it, and anyone who has had paella before and wants to recreate the flavors will be terribly disappointed by this 'tv dinner' version.

I found this recipe similar but not quite as good as regular paella. It is missing the standard mussels and other meat BUT it is a quick meal for a hungry family!

Edible but very blah. I bought saffron and scrubbed clams for this? Next time I try a paella recipe it won't be this one.
