This was a nice, smooth custard...not too sweet...perfect almond flavor. Not exactly the best custard type dessert. It kind of lacked texture and richness, which is why I gave it three forks. But it was easy to make, maybe it took a few steps, but none of them were difficult...even steeping the almonds, just buy pre-roasted, sliced almonds.

Stunning! My mother always made custards for desert at Christmas and Thanksgiving. For another idea - as I was growing up, being Scandinavian we often had simple beef broth served before a big meal and in it would be an almond "dumpling" really a custard because there was no flour in it, floating at the top. I have looked for years for a recipe that would fit the bill and this is exactly what I remember!

This is great. I and all of my guests and family who have tried this love it. I very highly recommend using real almonds - tastes next to nothing like the extract and (in our opinions) produces a far superior taste and custard. I roast them on a sheet in the oven at 350 or so until browned (happens fast), cool a little, grind well (to a little coarser that a sugar- or sand-like consistency, takes a few seconds) in the food processor, and strain the custard milk in a strainer lined with a double layer of cheese cloth. This is virtually no work, does not take long at all, and (again, I find) it is definitely worth it.

I love a twist on simple egg custard and this is wonderful! Because I had a LOT of cream on hand, I used heavy cream instead of half & half. Also, it was very late at night and rather than go through the straining of the almonds (which I did have on hand), I opted for the extract. It did take about 20 minutes longer to cook, but the end result was superb! Yes - this is a high fat dessert, but if you want low-fat, stay away from dairy! Non fat milk is not going to give you the results. Cardamom is also an acquired taste, I suppose, but it ranks high among my favorite spices. Its a wonderful "mystery" flavoring and I often search these pages specifically for the ingredient! Anyway - bravo for this recipe. I'll make it over and over again... with heavy cream, to be sure!

This was absolutely one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time! I didn't have a way to strain the almonds out, so I used a very small amount of almond extract....it was delicious! I have already made this 3 times and will continue to make it again and again and again. The person who said it was disgusting (and they said they were a cook) needs to retire, or at least go back to school!

This recipe was a huge hit at an Indian-theme dinner party I recently attended. I used a teaspoon of pure almond extract and it came out beautifully.

I followed the suggestions below - thanks! I don't have custard cups so i used a glass baking dish and set it inside another pan full of water. I made this in Italy where they don't even have cardamom, so i soaked nutmeg, cinnamon sticks, and whole cloves in the hot milk for a while. Strained it out. Nice flavor.

ugh, a real waste of time and ingredients.

Fantastic and yes, high in fat which is very clear from the recipe. If you are on a low-fat diet, perhaps you should skip this and not bother to review it.

Very tasty yet simple and elegant. The person who said it has too much fat should learn to enjoy life.

Fantastic!! I needed an easy dessert to go with an indian dinner. I make simple custards alot (which only use 2 cups whole milk and 3 whole eggs), and this one sounded great, but needed less milk. I used what I had on hand, and took the advice of using the almond extract (which saves a ton of time - and makes it a very quick and easy dessert, I think). I used 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup 1% milk, 1/3 cup of sugar, 1 1/2 Tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and 1/2 tsp ground cardomom, 3 yolks, 2 whole eggs. I heated the milk/ cream in the microwave, (whisked the eggs and yolks while it was heating) stirred everything but the eggs into the hot liquid, then slowly whisked it into the eggs. The whole thing only took me about 10 minutes (including getting ingredients out and measuring). I cooked it a little longer (an hour I think) until a knife came out clean. We couldn't wait to try them, so we had them warm, and they were delicious. No need to make a day ahead. I will make this many times again! (The comment about the fat.. oh please, just eat one serving, and enjoy it!) Nice and simple finish, especially for an indian meal (Smothered Lamb from Madhur Jaffrey's Quick and Easy Indian Cooking) with so many complex flavors. Definitely a wonderful creamy ending to a meal. Even my 3 year old loved it!

I tried this dessert when I came into possesion of a 1 kilo package of cardamom. The texture is wonderfully smooth and creamy. I used almond extract instead of steeping almond grounds and topped the custard with fresh sliced strawberries. My guests raved!

The recipe looks interesting but has way too much fat.
