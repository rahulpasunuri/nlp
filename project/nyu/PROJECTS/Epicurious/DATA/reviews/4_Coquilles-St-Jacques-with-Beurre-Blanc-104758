This dish has become a holiday tradition with us. I always make it with vermouth and fresh tarragon, though I sometimes do not have the white wine vinegar. Typically pasta is another way to use the sauce to some advantage.

Excellent! Served over rice to soak up the sauce.

This is a special recipe.

Delicious and quite easy and quick to prepare. Get everything ready before starting, because it moves quickly once you start and it's not a chop as you go recipe. The sauce is surprisingly light in spite of all the butter--it's not the thick, rich sauce you might be expecting, but the delicate flavors are just right for the scallops.

Surprisingly easy. No fresh tarragon at the market, so I added 1/2 tsp. dried tarragon to the shallot-wine mixture at the beginning, with good results. Still delicious. Quite rich, and therefore filling, with all that butter. Truly a special occasion dish.

For the cook from London, Ontarion, there is a recipe on this site for Duchesse Potato, which is what I think you're looking for. I'm trying this recipe this weekend and plan on serving it in the classic style with piped Duchesse potatoes around the Coquille.

Fantastic flavor. The sauce is excellent and extremely easy to make.

I would like to know a recipe for mashed potatoes to be put into a pastry bag and piped around the scallops. Mine did not come out in an artistic way so I made rosettes. Also the bag was quite hot to handle.

Flavor is okay, but I would prefer something with a more substantial sauce. I made it for my husband and myself, and we left 1/3 of the recipe in the pan uneaten. I will be deleting this recipe from my box.

This is the dish I crave after a rough day at work. I don't care if I have to make it all myself. Using fresh tarragon is probably my favorite (although fresh chives are also excellent). I usually buy the 16oz pkg of Trader Joe's scallops, and make the sauce as written, just for the two of us. We never use all the sauce, but running out would be a crying shame. In the past I've scaled the entire recipe down, but then we have to fight over the scallops. Fantastic!

This was made different than the way I have made this in the past. My husband raved over this when I served it! I thought it was out of this world too!

This is a simple and delicious recipe. My husband and I had it for a weeknight dinner with steamed asparagus. Perhaps it is because we had only one side, but the recipe only served the two of us--with no leftovers! Yum!

MMMM, GREAT!

Very simple and very tasty, but very rich. I really did enjoy it, but had a problem getting the beurre blanc thickened enough. Did I keep it over the heat too long? I tried hard not to, but it was a little runnier than it should have been. Still, very good, and I'll be making it again.

Lovely, classic sauce was extremely simple to make. I served the scallops (which I purchased frozen from Trader Joe's for next to nothing) with turned potatoes (boiled for about 15 minutes) and haricots vertes (microwaved for 2 minutes), with the sauce over all. A snap and good enough for company!

Really very simple to make. I had some fresh wild 'shrooms which I'd sauteed separately and I had BAY scallops. If you cook them more than a few secs they're tough. So I just stirred them into the shrooms and steamed for 2-3 minutes then served them over cous-cous with the sauce poured over the top. Very good. oh, and re the sauce - I was out of white wine vinegar but used raspberry vinegar, figuring that the little sweetness would go with the sweet bay scallops. I was right.

I thought that this recipe was excellent. It was fairly simple to make and really good. It's a definite try.
