Where's the beef? I made this exactly as written and felt the beef got drowned with both sauce and confit. The sauce and confit are very similar to each other--really don't need both. I will make again, but with just the onion confit and perhaps a little blue cheese sprinkled over.

This was spectacular, not too difficult and I will definitely make it again!

This was an excellent recipe. I made the recipe with Rib-eye steaks instead of Filet Mignon, as that is what I had available. The sauce was excellent and truly complimented the beef. My husband stated it was one of the best sauces he has ever had with beef. I would agree whole heartedly. I highly recommend this recipe to all.

I am split on this one. I loved the onions and was disappointed in the sauce.

An absolute favorite with my family!!!

Very good -- takes a little while to prepare, though. There was a bit too much confit (the recipe says it makes about 1 cup, but I think we had more like 2-3 cups).

Very good recipe and a great way to serve filet mignon. Easy meal.

eh, this didn't thrill us. We often rate dishes on whether we would be satisfied with it if we ordered it in a restaurant. This didn't make the cut. I accept that the difference could be the wine - when selecting, make sure that you try a more full-bodied bottle. We used a pinot noir and the sauce and confit were pretty dull. I'd also recommend making a bit more of the sauce for the meat. The full recipe barely covered the three small filets we had. The onion confit also desperately needed some butter to spruce it up. It was definitely a passable dish, just not a recipe to use with more precious cuts.

I made this for my anniversary dinner. My husband and I agreed it was a "restaurant-class" recipe. It's a little tricky and long to prepare, but oh so worth it! The only modification I made was to replace the beurre manie with a little bit of heavy cream.

I can't wait to make this again! It was so good. the sauce was incredible, the onions were perfect. And the thyme was a great flavor, I added it everywhere.

This was great - the sauce was amazing, sweetness of the confit balanced the steaks wonderfully. Although it took longer to put everything together than I expected. I will make this again.

We made this for a gourmet club and it went over very well. We were last minute and were unable to buy port because it was Sunday, but the other sweet red wine worked great. There were no left overs on this dish.

A Valentine's Day dinner success. Delicious and easy to prepare. I'll make it again for sure. (Note: I used Australian port and a really good Zinfandel, which probably helped.)

While my partner liked it, I really didn't care for it, it had a strong, bite to it. Perhaps it was too much balsamic and onion. I'd eat it again, but I wouldn't make it myself.

Awesome! I am very much looking forward to making this for guests--I wouldn't change a thing!

This was a bit on the bland side.

Very quick and easy. Looks great on the plate. I served it over garlic mashed potatos with blanched fresh baby asparagus. My guests were duly impressed.

Fantastic! This has become our "Romantic New Year's Eve" dinner. I make the whole menu(except the dessert) from the Jan.'93 issue --pommes anna and buttered snow peas and carrots, and we start with the puff pastry/caviar thingies. Truly celebratory.

A perfect New Year's Eve menu for two. I have made it on several occasions and it always works. I would include the confit, though. It's a very low-maintenance side and adds some different flavors.

This was a first class dish. You and your guests will think they were eating a four star restaurant. You don't have to go throuh all the trouble with the onion confeit if you don't want to. The sauce is so delicous that with a salad and perhaps some potatoes or another vegetable you really don't need the onions. Try it you'll love it.
