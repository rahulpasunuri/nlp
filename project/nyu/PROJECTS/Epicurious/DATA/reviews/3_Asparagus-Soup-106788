It was DELISH! It was the starter to our gourmetThanksgiving! I had some kale that I added in the soup and my garnish was sour cream dollop, crab meat and diced red pepper. I like the fact that it taste great without any cream - but if you feel the need you could add Fat Free half & half. I will make it again - low in calories!

Deeeeeelish! I opted to leave out the cream as mentioned by other reviews and added a few tsp. of grated parmesan before the puree process. So good! I also made a 1/2 batch and the veggies cooked for about 25 minutes.

Followed the recipe to the letter. Not the least bit impressive. I had to add a few tablespoons of 10% cream to give it some body. Wouldn't make it again.

My first disapointment from Epicurious. I found it quite bland. There was hardly any taste of asparagus. I don't like taragon and substituted marjarom but I can't believe this would make a difference. Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T". Love asparagus and would like to have a good recipe for the soup.

This was excellent. The tarragon and asparagus are a match made in heaven. Added the tiniest bit of cream in the end before pureeing, and did not strain. It was velvety smooth, delicious, and healthy!

Very good and easy recipe. I halved the recipe and the vegetables took significantly shorter to cook (about 25 min). I also added about 1/3 cup of whipping cream when I blended the soup. It came out very creamy and yummy...

Wonderful and rich tasting soup without cream. I did not need to strain the soup but I do use a very good blender (Vita Mix) so it turned out very smooth.

This is a very good soup. I did tinker around with it a little; added more garlic, some heavy cream. It was even better the second day.

I am a member of Weight Watchers and this is a great recipe! A serving size is generous, the points are very low, and it is a great way to get one's veggies in each day!

This was the best!! We really enjoyed this soup. I did add a little whipping cream (what's asparagus soup without it) ? We had leftovers for the next day. I do feel you need to play around with it a little. My end result was delicious !! Will make again & again. I topped with creme fraiche & the diced tomatoes.

I pre-made this last night for a dinner party on Saturday (it's Tuesday). It's only OK - quite bland and the colour is gross. I'm either going to tinker a little with it or start over with something else. I'm glad I tried it first.... $10 worth of asparagus can't be thrown out!

This is absolutely delicious! We started making a very similar recipe about a year ago which we enjoyed, but this has it beaten. We serve it cold or luke warm with a dallop of sour cream and one or two cantalope balls(if in season). I keep extra copies of the recipe on hand because after folks taste it they love it - all being surprised it is asparagus based!!

I haven't tried this recipe yet but it sounds wonderful! My fiance' and step daughter have re-introduced me to BRUSSEL SPROUTS (I hated them as a child) and have asked me to make a cream soup with this vegetable. I can not find a specific recipe for their request. I wonder if this Asparagus recipe would work? Any suggestions for the herb or any other additions I should use?

We love the asparagus soup. We had it as an appetizer, with a nice little sauvignon blanc. It ws fantastic. I left the tomoatos out, and made one more modification; while sauteeing the onions and garlic, I added a dash of red cooking wine. It added a very nice flavor.

I didn't rate this recipe because I didn't have any terragon on hand, so I used thyme. It was very good, I will make this again!

Loved it! Used yoghurt and no tomatos like the other cook suggested. By mistake I put in turmeric instead of tarragon and it was very tasty!

Was skeptical of this recipe but needed to use up some large- not so fresh asparagus. Skipped the tarragon and tomato on top. Added a couple dallops of plain yogurt into blender- Very tasty soup- good color and meld of flavors. Would make an excellent light first course- will make again for sure!

This recipe is a must do for asparagus lovers. It was so good! It melted in my mouth and revitalized my spirit.
