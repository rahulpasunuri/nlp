This is an absolutely fabulous dish. I didn't change a thing and made the recipe as is. Served it with mashed potatoes with green onions and the flavor was fantastic! I bought veal cutlets at Costco and they were tasty and tender! This one is a keeper!

This dish was really good! I added a little fresh thyme and veal demi glace just to beef up the flavor. I will definitely make this again!

This is really easy to prepare, especially for the outcome. It is a little rich, but great if you want to make a casual dinner a little special. I substituted chicken breastes for the veal, and added fresh thyme. Still very delicious.

This is basically beef stroganoff with veal. The sauce seemed a little heavy for the delicate meat, and like tandyb, my veal was kind of tough. Probably would not make again for such an expensive cut of meat.

Excellent, easy recipe. Can also use chicken, turkey, pork cutlets pounded thin.

The second time I made this I added 1 tablespoon of whole grain mustard to the sauce. It was a great addition to bump up the already great flavor. I used 3/4 cup 2% instead of cream to cut out some fat. The sauce still came out wonderful. Definitely company worthy however it is last minute prep.

Wonderfully tasty! The sauce was so easy to make. I will be making this often - especially for entertaining.

I loved the sauce but must have gone wrong with my veal. It was a bit tough although it came from the butcher. I would have liked to have doubled the sauce....will try with pork tender as mentioned earlier.

this is delicious!! I used a small white onion since I didn't have shallots and the juice of a lemon instead of the wine, still turned out great!

in an attempt to work with the ingredients on hand and to be a bit healthier, i opted to use fresh dill and modified the recipe to use vegetable broth instead of the white wine, onion instead of shallots, and did not add the heavy cream.... perhaps it changed beyond its original intent, but it was a delicious, and quick too!

Suggetions on what to serve with this: Saffron rice along with artichokes. Both were lovely with the sauce and veal. We suggest Velletri, an Italian red, with this.

Yummy! I made this recipe tonight for my hubby and hi sfather and they LOVED IT! I used a little less butter than the recipe asked for. My husband kept raving about it, even though he is not wild about cream sauces. quick to make, perfect with sauteed baby red potatoes and a veggie to soak up the juices.

Don't let the mushrooms / onions simmer too long. The mushrooms lose their taste rather quickly... I used medium heat for the meat -- it was really nice and tender in the end.

Great recipe. Very very easy and quick. Next time I think that I will add a splash of cognac or brandy to the sauce.

This dish was delicious. The sauce reminded me of the delicate sauces one finds in the best restaurants in France.

This was a great recipe, simple to make and great taste. I only had button mushrooms at home, so I just used those and it was just as great! I have also made it with Red wine and it was delicious also!

This recipe is as good as anything you would order in any fancy restaurant. The only problem is what to serve with it. I served fresh pasta, rice and oven roasted potatoes. There was nothing left of anything.

Both my husband and I loved this recipe. I added about 1 tsp of fresh thyme to the sauce and it was fantastic. Will definitely make this again and look forward to serving it for a dinner party as well.

Definitely a great quick meal. I served it with mashed potatoes, and as stated in the other reviews, the sauce was fantastic. Next time I'll try the sauce with pork tenderloin.

This was WONDERFUL! My only problem was my husband wouldn't let me get some bread to get up the last of the sauce. I am supposed to be eating low-fat meals.

Best 10 minute sauce that I ever made...

I made this recipe for someone who must have everything with some sort of sauce and as an avid sauce eater he knows his sauces. Result: He absolutely LOVED it. For me, I absolutely liked that it was extremely easy to make.

Excellent! I've yet to make it with veal though! I've used turkey tenderloin and pork scalloppini,also used several kinds of mushrooms-portobellos included. It's great over plain egg noodles with a simple hot veggie to complete the meal.

the cream sauce was delicious. I could not find the mushrooms on an moments notice but I did add 1 teaspoon of raw bacon (meat only) and sauteed that with the shallots. . . great!!!! I would love to eat other dishes from this great chef.

Being a Minneapolis native, Schumacher's Restaurant has always been one of my favorites. I made this recipe for my husband and I and we loved it. I used a little less cream than called for and next time might add more mushrooms. I served it with Tomatoes Provencal (Cooking Light 9/01) and a Potato Puff (Mastercook) both recipes were light offsetting the cream in the scallops. It was a great menu/dinner very company worthy.

Based on this dish, if I ever get to Minnesota, I'll try Schumacher's. Good dinner.
