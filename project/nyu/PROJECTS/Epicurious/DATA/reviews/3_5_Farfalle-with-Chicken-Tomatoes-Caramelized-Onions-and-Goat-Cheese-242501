Has a lot of flavor, definitely going to make again! Never had a problem of it being soupy like others; just allow it more than enough time to reduce. Enjoyed the goat cheese but love the other persons comment about feta. Also thought about adding mushrooms. Can't wait to eat the left overs!

YUCK! I wish I had avoided this recipe after reading the other reviews stating that this was no good. Even after some changes, which I hoped would clear up some of the soupiness issues, seasoning problems, etc. it was still just strange. Correction: gross. Where to start... The goat cheese, although I love goat cheese, was a compete mistake. French cheese should not go on an Italian dish. When is a French Italian fusion ever a good idea? By the end of the meal I had probably used over an ounce of parmesan just trying to mask the weird flavor combination and get it down. This recipe had no flow and the flavors didn't blend at all. What a disappointment. Especially since I'll be eating the leftovers, sans chèvre, tomorrow for lunch.

The ratio of ingredients in this recipe is absurd. Why would you add a CUP of chicken broth? This was more like a soup. As another reviewer observed, the people who liked this recipe seem to be the ones who did not make it as written. Not only was it soupy, but the flavor combinations were strange. The flavor of the caramelized onions got lost, mostly due to the very strong flavor of the marjoram. Would NOT make again.

I make this all the time for dinner parties...it makes a lot of food and you can do it all ahead of time. BUT, I make the following alterations: Linguini or spaghetti (I use whole wheat), not farfalle. Cook the spinach (or swiss chard) with the sauce and use lots of garlic and salt. Cook out all of the liquid. We don't eat meat, so I omit the chicken and put roasted butternut squash on the top. DEEEE- LISH.

One of my favorite recipes! I've made this quite a few times, it's just so good. One tricky thing though is the caramelized onions - you've really got to keep an eye on them or they'll burn. This was my first encounter with goat cheese, and this recipe won me over; I now use goat cheese in other recipes. also, you don't really need the sherry wine vinegar, it's just as great without it.

Followed recipe to a T and was quite disappointed. The finished product was soupy, bland, and lacking in appearance. I would not make this again.

This was terrible - the flavor combination was just odd. My family endured it for dinner and I ended up throwing the left overs out immediately. Don't bother - you can come up with a better pasta salad on your own.

Another delicious Summer dish! Indeed the caramelized onions are the key ingreadients to this recipe...This is a keeper too...Everyone loved it!

Rating: 1
This was one of my least favorite recipes I've ever made from this site. The recipe calls for an insane amount of onion to be used, even after it reduced during the caramelizing. I just didn't enjoy the flavors together at all. I have no idea why it's apparently gotten so many positive reviews. I will be deleting this one from my recipe box.

Rating: 1
I don't usually follow recipes too closely but this time I did. Although, I added more pasta because it's clearly not enough for the amount of other ingredients. It was over all flat tasting. I should have trusted my instinct and roasted the spinach in garlic and added it to the pot at the end. This recipe needs major help. You'd be better off just winging it.

I don't know what is with the inconsistencies in the reviews but skimming through it seems like most of the people who gave this recipe high marks modified the dish. I made this recipe as written and I agree with those reviewers who made the following comments: 1) Unbalanced. Think about it: 2 cups of liquid PLUS 5 cups of chopped tomato to only 8 oz of pasta with two cups of chicken? You end up with gobs of chicken and tomato in quite a bit of watery, creamy liquid (goat cheese melts) and not much pasta. My suggestion: either double the pasta OR halve the chicken, broth and wine and omit tomato seeds using only the flesh. Then it might turn out looking more like the picture and tasting better. 2) The final product isn't as good as the individual ingredients alone. The caramelized onions were lost in the soupy pasta. My suggestion--don't let them get completely brown like you would if you were making them to put on a burger. Instead, stop when the onions are browned but still dense and holding their shape. Or use sauteed shallots and garlic instead. Consider using the dark meat for more flavor. I'd leave out the marjoram, it seemed out of place. Remember to salt to taste. Maybe saute the spinach w/ some garlic and incorporate at the end rather than spooning the pasta onto raw spinach leaves. Keep the goat cheese in the fridge until you're ready to crumble on top.

This is tasty, but MAN does it make a lot of food! When they say 4-6 servings, they are talking very generous portions.

Rating: 3
I used arugula instead of spinach (tasted very good) and took reviewers' suggestions to add the greens and the cheese to the hot pasta. Omitted the marjoram. I would say the result was excellent but for one thing -- careful which goat cheese you pick. Any aged goat cheese with a rind gives this dish a stinky, old-shoe flavor when it needs a nice bright flavor. I should have used a tangy fresh goat cheese. Otherwise I thought the recipe was very nice.

Rating: 1
Very unbalanced.Too acidic.Too much liquid with wine, broth and 5 cups of tomatoes. Should use less tomatoes or a variety that doesn't throw off as much liquid. Heirlooms are a waste for this recipe (I prefer raw). Couldn't taste chicken OR onions. Too much work for the results.

Rating: 3
Very good. I grilled chicken breasts with garlic, herbs, olive oil, then sliced for recipe. Substituted chives for marjoram. Used roasted grape tomatoes, halved.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe...you have to prepare it just as it states in the directions otherwise it ends up not working out well. I agree with another reviewer who states that the caramelized onions makes this dish. The white wine also adds to the taste. I also cook the chicken from scratch and it does make a huge difference to the store bought rotisserie chicken.

Rating: 2
I would give this 2 1/2 forks if I could. I agree with other reviewers who said the end result was less than the sum of its parts. It just seemed flat and one-dimensional. Definitely needs salt (or maybe something briny like capers or olives), a little spice and a little more zing.

Rating: 4
Caramelised onions made it! Didn't have cooked chicken so grilled chicken breasts with oil and rosemary which gave delicious flavour. Cooked the tomatoes and spinach to heat, and mixed goats cheese into pasta to melt it and spread the flavour. Family hit!

Rating: 2
This dish was just ok...especially for all the prep that goes into it. Definitely leave out the marjoram and add some oregano..maybe about a teaspoon. It definitely needs something to kick up the flavors a bit. Try adding some capers or sundried tomatoes toward the end of cook time, otherwise the flavors are quite bland.

Rating: 3
I've made this twice, and it definitely needs tweaking. First of all, OMIT the marjoram. It tastes like soap and overwhelmes the dish. The first time I made this I used dried oregano and basil, having no fresh herbs on hand. It was delicious and my family gobbled it up. I made it last night for a cooking class demonstration, this time using the fresh basil and marjoram. Just trust me, unless you love the flavor, the marjoram has got to go. Added a tad more salt, some fresh lemon juice and feta instead of goat cheese. Olives and pine nuts would be a nice addition, and maybe some pancetta or bacon. This is a delicious recipe, but quite subtle. Definitely good enough to make again with some tweaking.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and easy to make! I made the mistake of only using one onion, because once I'd chopped the first one, it look like a LOT of onion for a small dish. However, once the onions are caramelized, they shrink up exponentially. So make sure to use both!

Rating: 4
This was simply a great pasta dish. I used the suggestion of one of the others & used oregano instead of marjoram. I also used a jar of sun dried tomatoes packed in oil as I honestly have no idea what heirloom tomatoes are. And, I added the spinach & goat cheese to the mixture at the end & cooked about another 5-6 min. until the spinach was wilted. My husband & daughter loved it!

Rating: 3
Very good and easy. Didn't have a rotisserie chicken available, so I just poached some chicken breasts in seasoned water- tender and tasty. I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry and followed the others advice to stir the spinach and goat cheese into the warm pasta mixture. The result is a light, slightly creamy, well-seasoned dish. The marjoram is a little weird though, maybe next time I would use a bit of oregano with some lemon juice...or just leave it out. I would make it again for sure!

Rating: 3
Very good...my family enjoyed it. I took others' advice and added the spinach in with the pasta to wilt it, and I stirred in the cheese, too. I also topped with toasted pine nuts. I plan to make it this summer and NOT add the spinach and cheese to the pot. So, it doubles as two dishes: winter comfort food and a summer salad. One thing I will try, for either version, is adding sliced, pitted Kalamata olives, and see how that works. I will definitely make this again.

This was OK and certainly didn't taste fattening...but it just wasn't great. Glad to have tried this recipe...but would alter greatly to make it better tasting.

I agree with other reviewers... this dish is lacking something. The flavor of the caramelized onions is indiscernible.The ingredients are all so good it's hard to believe that together they create such a bland dish. I would definitely add salt and garlic next time. Maybe crushed red pepper flakes.

I'm always looking for new pasta recipes and this one was fantastic! The only changes I made was to add the goat cheese and spinach in with the pasta for the last minute of cooking. It wilted the spinach a bit and made the sauce really creamy. It will definately be a recipe I'll make again and again!

Rating: 4
This turned out fantastic, definitely a keeper though I did not follow the recipe exactly (well, I hardly ever do). Did not have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned (the diced ones with basil and oregano). Cooked them with their liquid until reduced, and only added a little chicken stock, as needed. I used chicken thighs that I browned first, then cooked the onions in the same pan. I only had 1 red onion, so I used that and a regular (not Vidalia) one. Caramelized, they were nice and sweet, no need to add the sugar or the vinegar. The addition of goat cheese was fantastic, and brought the sauce together. Followed the advice here, toasted some pine nuts to sprinkle over, and while they gave the dish a nice touch were not really needed. It had a ton of flavor. Will definitely make this again.

Rating: 1
The marjoram overpowers all the other flavors in the recipe. I cut the marjoram in half this time and it was still too strong - omit! I mixed the goat cheese into the dish just before serving which added a nice creaminess. I really like Sara Foster's cooking, but this is not a winner.

Rating: 0
I wanted a different recipe and this seemed easy enough. My 5 and 8 year old sons both liked it, as well as my husband. I didn't have the sherry vinegar or marjoram on hand so I omitted them and used canned Muir Glen diced tomatoes since I didn't have fresh. Skipped the spinach since I was out of that, too. It was a tad bland, I think next time I'd add more pepper and I also drizzled with a bit of lemon juice. I'll try again with the sherry vinegar and marjoram and I'm certain that will help, too.

Here's the thing - if you use sweet (yellow, Vidalia) onions, you don't need the sugar and balsamic vinegar is perfect. Also no need for wine in the sauce. We LOVE carmelized onions so I did the same as if I was making French onion soup - carmelized in butter and olive oil for about 30 minutes on moderately low heat, arugula instead of spinach, 1/2 crumbled goat cheese, 1/2 feta, heirloom tomatoes (all varieties and colors) and served with a baguette. Enjoy!

Excellent. We used tarragon instead of marjoram, and freshly grilled chicken breast as opposed to rotisserie. Next time, we'll probably add some dried Moroccan olives.

I will definitely make this dish again. Needs to be tweaked a little; thought it was a smidge too bland. I will try the other ideas, i.e. chili flakes, pine nuts perhaps, garlic & will cut back on the tomatoes. It was pretty juicy! Good dish though, everyone loved it. Oh.....I will definitely keep it on a bed of fresh, uncooked spinach. It really added a different & delicious touch!

Rating: 3
This is an excellent recipe. Only reason for 3 instead of 4 forks is the sauce is rather thin unless you cook it down quite a bit as others suggested. I might even try a little bit of cornstarch next time. But, I would definitely make this again.

I made this for my husband for a welcome home dinner after he returned from a trip to Budapest, and was very disappointed. My expectations were much higher for this recipe based off of some of the other reviews. In my opinion, the recipe turned out much too sweet (although I normally do enjoy the taste of carmelized onions). I will not make this variation of this recipe again.

Rating: 0
Yuck. The sherry vinegar, carmelized onions and tomatoes were WAY too sweet and no counterbalance. I battled this recipe! I added bacon and that helped, but the proportions were wrong, and the tomatoes should have been peeled. It would have been better with Feta on top instead of the mild goat cheese. Overall, so mediocre.

We thought this was good but not great for the effort involved. I'd avise cutting the marjoramm in half; it was a little overpowering. This is not a recipe, though, that I'd consider a "keeper."

This was excellent. I used 12 oz pasta, added red chili flakes, and mixed in the spinash at the end. I used 3/4 cup each wine and broth, and reduced them together to about 3/4 cup total. I served the pasta and topped with the goat cheese rather than mixed it in to ensure it didn't turn the dish gooey. It was delicious!

Most flavors are lost in the marjoram. Timing is short, proportions are off, but there is definitely potential... Perhaps mushrooms and cooked spinach as other reviewers suggested?

I didn't have white wine, ripe tomatoes, or spinach. Still, turned out fantastic! Used sundried tomatoes and sweet vidalia onions. Whipped up some Montrachet cheese, and placed a drop of cheese on top of the finished pasta. Grilled asparagus pieces on the side...would be great with some light flatbread!

This pasta is great, both for flavor and because much of it can be made ahead. Various circumstances demanded that I serve dinner right after returning home from an event. I did all the prep other than cooking the pasta earlier in the day. Then, simply boiled the pasta and added the other ingredients. The just cooked pasta warmed the other ingredients perfectly. Had the chilled cucumber/feta soup for a starter and the lemon semifreddo as dessert, both from this Bon Appetit edition and both excellent as well.

I made this for a party and doubled the recipe. I used two aluminum lasagna pans and put the spinach leaves in the bottom of each pan. As other reviewers suggested, I roasted the tomatoes and added bacon, because Everything's Better with Bacon, right? In this case, the bacon didn't stand out and I'll probably skip it next time. I also omitted the marjoram as I didn't have any. The shredded chicken came from a rotisserie chicken I picked up at the grocery deli. People really, really liked this dish. The only change I might make would be to increase the amount of onion, maybe double or just by half. But then I'm a BIG fan of caramelized onions.

Rating: 3
My suggestions: Definitely use a strong goat cheese - mild ones get washed out with the other flavors and don't add the needed tangy/salty kick. Next time, I would add portabello mushrooms for that added earthy taste, and pancetta, as others have suggested.

Rating: 3
Wow, this was fabulous! I roasted some chopped roma tomatoes in the oven to begin with. I would probably use 3 onions next time because they were so good. I did add some garlic to the onion mixture toward the end of the cooking process. I probably used a little more wine and stock- this did take longer than 3 minutes to reduce. Can't wait to make this again.

I'm sorry, but I really didn't get this recipe. I made it for a potluck dinner and when I got it all into the dish, it had a rather unappetezing appearance. It is rather unidentifable as a potluck dish. I doctored it up with some bacon, which helped the taste but not the appearance. I can see why they recommend putting this all on a bed of spinach-- it needs some help in the looks department. Marjoram may not be the best spice for this dish either. You really need to like marjoram!

This was probably the best pasta I've ever tasted! I skipped the chicken and added sundried tomatoes and some chili flakes...I also used heirloom cherry tomatoes in place of the big ones. I didn't cook the spinach like some other reviewers and thought it was perfect as is. The warm pasta heated it just enough for my liking- warm, but still crunchy. Absolutely delish!! Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe as is except increased the pasta to 16 oz (12 would probably be just right). I loved the sweetness of the tomatoes and onions with the richness of the goat cheese. I found the spinach too bitter and would not include it next time. Overall delicious and a repeat-er!

This was indeed a very tasty dish but I thought the ingredient ratios were askew. I increased the pasta to 12 oz. and reduced the tomatoes to 2 cups. I also chopped the basil and added it along with the marjoram.

This dish was surprisingly flavorful! I too cut the onions in half and stirred in the spinach at the end rather than serve it over as a salad. Go heavy on the herbs. Consider blanching and peeling the tomatoes first to get rid of the skins. It was fairly easy to make this dish vegetarian by eliminating the chicken and chicken broth. I replaced with just a little extra water and 2-3 large portabello mushrooms. Delicious!

Wow! This was a hit! I had 1/2 leftover roasted chicken, and this recipe was great. I followed some of the advise of previous reviewers and made some other changes: used bacon and sauteed the onions in some of the bacon drizzle. Used the stock leftover from the chicken (this worked great and added lots of flavor), used cilantro from the garden instead of basil and majoram (didn't have those at hand). And added the spinach to the pasta as suggested. The bacon and spinach suggestions worked great (Thanks) It turned into a very flavorful dish.

Use only half the amount of onion specified; add and reduce the chicken stock with the wine (otherwise you are making soup instead of sauce and your noodles will overcook); mix the spinach in with the pasta after it's removed from the heat instead of putting the pasta on top like a salad. Next time I will add crisp pancetta or bacon to help counterbalance the sweetness of the onions.
