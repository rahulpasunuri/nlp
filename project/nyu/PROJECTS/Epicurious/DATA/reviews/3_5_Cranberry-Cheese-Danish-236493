My aunt highly recommended this recipe but I thought it was blah. The crescent roll flavor really overpowers the flavors of the cheese and cranberries and makes the whole thing taste store-bought and cheap, even if your other ingredients are good. Bleh.

I also made it with the blueberry pie filling and it was a hit. One of the easiest desserts/breakfasts to make and always delicious.

I made this a couple of times with blueberry pie filling. Everyone absolutely loved it.

I've made this recipe and versions of it many times. An easy step to add: forget the baking sheet and just place the crescent rolls on the bottom of a 9x13" pan, top with filling, place second package of rolls over it and bake. No seeping, easy to cut.

Made this with reaspberry sauce left over from New Years in lieu of cranberries. Sprinkeled some raw sugar atop. Marvelous warm from the oven. This would work great with many different fruits.

The best breakfast I've ever made... This was a huge hit the morning after Thanksgiving. No one was paying attention to anything anyone was saying - they were concentrating too hard on the danish! It tasted great and was gone in 5 seconds. We used cherry pie filling this time, but are planning on using blueberry next time. And it's the perfect size for 10 people!

Delicious and easy! Prep time was less than stated. I used apricot pie filling instead and it just disappeared for breakfast. I will try with pineapple and cherry because I am sure that will be great too.

This was so easy to make and delicious. I always have some cranberry sauce left over after Thanksgiving and usually throw it out. Not this year. I think I will try this one with blueberries. Yum Yum.
