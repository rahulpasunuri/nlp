Watercress tastes terrible, without the rest of these ingredients. I've made this salad a few times and we enjoy it.

I love watercress & this dressing was OK. However, I thought the combination of watercress & flat-leaf parsley was terrible ! The parsley (which I love in other recipes) had a flat, bitter flavour with the cress & the celery struck a rather odd note too. Not good.

I love this non-lettuce salad. The texture and spicy taste are great for cleaning the palette.
