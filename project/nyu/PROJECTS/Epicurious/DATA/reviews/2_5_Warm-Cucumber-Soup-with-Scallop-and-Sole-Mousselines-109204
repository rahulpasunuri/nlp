The mousselines were labor intensive and very rich although bland. I made sure to buy the freshest scallops and flounder but doing that didn't seem to add much. The soup was beautiful but the flavor was also bland. I realize that the flavors were meant to be delicate, however for that much work I had hoped for more. Also, I used a mini muffin tin in place of the timabales. It worked out great.

Very interesting and tasty. I will make again, but will serve the soup warmer. The fish and scallop combination is very good. Just garnished with dill.
