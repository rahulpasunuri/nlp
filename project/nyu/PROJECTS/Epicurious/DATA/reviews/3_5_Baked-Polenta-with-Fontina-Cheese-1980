I would saute the shallots first, unless you can chop them very fine. Also, 4 tsps. of marjoram sounds like a lot. I used a tsp. of thyme as it fit my recipe better. I also sauteed some Italian parsley, which made the layers look more interesting. All that being said, it was a great recipe which I highly recommend. Oh, if fontina's too expensive, just use half grated Parmesan and half mozzarella.

It was a bit moist at first. I didn't give it time to cool before digging in. It is so good, especially with the fontina. Instead of layering the cheese and polenta, I topped the polenta with fontina and cream. Makes plenty of leftovers.

The last polenta dish I made came out very firm and flavorful. This one was good but runny. I recommend that anyone making this dish make it and bake it the day before and then warm it up on the day you plan to serve it.

Delicious, easy! (Substituted chicken stock for chicken broth.)
