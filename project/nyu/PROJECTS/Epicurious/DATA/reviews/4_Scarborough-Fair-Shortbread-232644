I should have followed my instincts when I read this recipe: room-temperature butter for shortbread??? Really??? Only if you like your shortbread crispy-chewy... Next time, I'm going to use my favorite shortbread recipe (hint: the butter's chilled and there's an egg in it) and add herbs. The herbs here were a nice touch, and would so especially well with Republic of Tea's "Desert Sage" tea.

This was phenomenal. I've never been a fan of shortbread and this was my first attempt making it myself, but it's already a favorite. I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used dry and halved the herb requirements. I sprinkled a little dried parsley around the edge of each wheel and put one dry rosemary leaf on each piece. I also tried to make it a little healthier by using half wheat flour. I had to use a pizza cutter to slice up the pieces without them breaking and it was hard to pinch the crust, but I'm definitely making this again!

I really enjoyed these little biscuits. I used only rosemary and added a half teaspoon of vanilla, because the dough tasted a little bland at first. I definitely wouldn't call these "very" sweet, as I see some other have. To me, it was a very lightly sweet bread, with a light, refreshing herbal taste. I served mine with a warm, three berry sugar glaze and it was a great dish we all loved!

This cookie/biscuit is amazing and very simple to make. It is the perfect appetizer to bring to any type of party from breakfast to dinner. I used the mixer to make the dough come together as by fork it took awhile. If using the mixer...use a paddle attachment and it comes together in less than 10 seconds so keep an eye out. The recipe also doubles very easily.

I love this recipe. It has become an every Christmas tration. I usually roll and cut the dough in the shape of Christmas trees and use only rosemary. I also add just a little more salt. Somehow, they always seem to disappear.

I sometimes make this on a pizza stone for a darker, burnt-butter taste. I suppose you could actually use burnt butter, but why bother?

A co-worker brought these cookies in to share today - OMG they are SO good!! She said they were very easy, and made her house smell wonderful. I plan on making them later this week (hopefully I'll be able to resist eating them all at once). Definitely a keeper!

A big hit at our Christmas Open House! A perfect balance of herbs and sweetness. I whirled regular white sugar in the Cuisinart to make it superfine, and rolled and cut the dough in holly leaf shapes before baking but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as above. A definite addition to our Christmas goodies from now on.

Very nice. Simple to make. Be careful not to overmix as I did the first time - that obviously causes the gluten in the flour to make the cookies a bit too chewy. The combination of sweet and savory is addictive. I used a cookie cutter for perfectly shaped cookies.

these were AMAZING !!!!! Sweet and savory at the same time. Melt in your mouth buttery texture with a little sparkle of sweet crunchiness from the bruleed sugar on top. Would be perfect with a simple cup of tea, because it would outshine anything else you tried to pair it with !!
