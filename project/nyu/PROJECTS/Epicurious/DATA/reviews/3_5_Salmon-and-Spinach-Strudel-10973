We have always enjoyed this recipe. However, the accompanying sauce suggested by the cook from Berlin elevated the dish to a different level.....stunning!. I surrounded the salmon with the spinach mix which kept the salmon nice and moist.

This was fantastic! but there are a few things i will do differently next time. I agree that there was a lot of filling - i will use a little less of the spinach mixture next time. and i will use another layer or two of phyllo. this was a big hit and i found it easy to make.

Needed to use up some fresh poached wild salmon and decided to use this recipe for a quiche. I left out the flour and added eggs and cream. Used the spinach, onion, fennel, cheese, as the recipe called for. It was good. Next time, I would probably do a top crust and make more of a salmon pie.

This is deee-licious, especially for friends who love their salmon. A couple of things about the recipe: the filling and salmon together make A LOT of filling. I ended up with more than could fit inside the strudel. Also, the strudel needs only 15 minutes (at the most) at 425 degrees. When I make this again, I think I'll set the oven at 375 and cook the time allocated in the recipe. But it is divine ... the salmon and licorice and spinach flavours are wonderful. A postscript: the re-heat instructions (15 minutes @ 450 degrees) are not accurate. Re-heat the strudel at a lower heat (350) for more time (minimum 30 mintes).

Very good, but I liked more than guests. Too much Spinach. Next time I'll cut back and use more salmon

A really elegant festive dish. I served slices atop a saffron-green peppercorn reduction (1 shallot sauteed in olive oil, add a pinch of saffro, tsp green peppercorns, half cup white wine, reduce, then a cup and a half of cream, reduce) and piped designs onto the plate with basil pesto. Next time I make it, I think I'll try to make sure the salmon is surrounded by the spinach mixture.

This recipe seems like a bit of work, but is well worth the effort. The phyllo I used was smaller than called for in the recipe, so I made two smaller strudels. Because phyllo is so delicate this was actually easier.
