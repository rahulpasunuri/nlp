This was a great 4th of July dish. Soaking the chicken in the sugar & salt gave the chicken a unique tenderness & flavor. I used individual pieces of chicken instead of the half birds and used a local BBQ sauce and rub (I didn't have time to order Clarks). Cooking time at 300 in a gas oven was about 1 hour & 15 minutes. There were no "juices" to baste as the recipe recommends but I slathered bbq sauce on the pieces a few times during the cooking process. Not only did it taste great but I was able to make it a couple of hours in advance of our dinner. So I spent more time with family & friends than working over the food - always a plus! I would make this again for a crowd anytime.

Delicious and great for a crowd! I want to try soaking, skinning chicken parts then baking but not sure if any adjustments need to be made. Any suggesstions?

I have been making this recipe since it was first published in 1995, my copy of that issue is very worn. I use the Rub and Mop from CHILI-RUBBED CHICKEN WITH BARBECUE TABLE MOP recipe and BBQ the chicken. Each recipe is good on its own but beyond compare when combined.

I did not use the Clark's rub or sauce, but marinating the chicken in the brown sugar mixture really kept it moist. Very good. I used the molasses beer barbecue sauce and a roasted garlic rub. It was a beg hit at our Memorial Day PicNic.

This recipe is excellent - the chicken is extremely moist. My 2 year old son loves it - it is also easy for babies to chew. I use another spice rub recipe with paprike, brown sugar, etc.

I've made this recipe numerous times for large crowds, and it's always a hit. Very moist and delicious chicken. I found that using free-range chicken produced the best results.
