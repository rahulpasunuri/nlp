This turned out to be a nice twist on a classic basic. I mostly made it as written, but added 1 c of chicken bullion along with the water, to thin it out and add some flavor. I let it all simmer for 20 min longer than indicated. Substituted fat free Greek Yogurt for the cream--added it in the blender. It turned out creamy and tasty, not too heavy on the anise.

This is the third summer I'm relying on this recipe to use up squash from the garden. My husband and I love this soup, especially cold. I prefer the soup strained after blending. It also needs a generous amount of salt and pepper, and I add extra thyme sprigs. I prefer to add the creme fresch at serving time, spooned on top. Great recipe!

I was super excited about this soup recipe. We always have too many zucchini in the summer and I love fennel and Pernod, the anise flavor liqueur I chose. I found it to be exceedingly boring and bland and would not make it again.

Surprising, refreshing, out of the ordinary soup. Anise adds an orginal taste to it. I will definetly make it again.

This is one of our favorite soups, though I think one needs to like anise flavor in order to enjoy this soup. After reading other reviewers comments I cut down on the anise seeds to half a Tbs to avoid bitterness. I also used 2 Tbs of Ouzo (Greek anise liqueur) but I think 1-1.5 Tbs would also be enough if you don't want a dominant anise flavor.

I found this soup to be wonderful. Didn't have any problems with bitterness because of the fennel seeds. I suggest straining the soup after blending to get any larger chunks of seed that may be left. Followed a previous reviewer's advice and served it with the goat cheese tart, and with lavender honey profiteroles for dessert. Great for a warm day!

This is a nice little soup, I will make it again but will omit the fennel seeds and use instead fresh fennel bulb as the seeds lend a bitterness as one reviewer noted.

With all the great recipes out there, I won't make this again. It tasted somewhat bitter to me.

Served cold as a first course (on a hot summer day) as part of a Bastille Day dinner party. Great way to start the meal, very refreshing.

Nice flavor and interesting consistency. I could not buy Pernod at my local state store so I used a domestic anisette. I served it with the lavender and goat cheese tart from Gourmet 1997. I served it with a Pinot Blanc from Alsace. The combination of the three made for a lovely summer dinner on the deck.
