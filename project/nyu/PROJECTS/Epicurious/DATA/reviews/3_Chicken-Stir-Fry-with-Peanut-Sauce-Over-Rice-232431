This was tasty and came together quickly. I would double the sauce if I made it again - there was not enough to flavour the rice so the whole thing was a bit dry.

Epic fail with 4/5 of my kids. Go figure. They eat spoons full of peanut butter as snacks, but this was a little too "out there" for them. They ate it (because that's the house rule), but I won't try it again. Bummer - I liked it. Especially with Sriracha!

I added a small chopped onion, sliced 2 celery sticks, and diced 2 potatoes, sauteing them in that order. I added the ginger and garlic when I added the potatoes because i like to sweat those and not brown them so much. I left the chicken drippings in the pan to keep flavor, but I agree, cook slowly to avoid scalding the peanut sauce (adding more water and then let it simmer down). I tripled the peanut sauce to cover about 1 lb of bit sized chicken thighs. Hot pepper flakes to simmer. Didn't have cayenne on hand but used srirhacha sauce to taste once served. Yum!

This was very good. I used broccoli, onions, mushrooms and some sweet and hot peppers for the veg. Added some salt and pepper and a little crushed red pepper to the final mix, as it seemed a little bland. As another reviewer suggested, added lime juice to the sauce, which brightened it up considerably. Served with rice, asparagus with sesame seed, and a simple green salad with pineapple/sesame dressing. A very satisfying and tasty meal without a lot of effort.

I would definitely make this again because it's so easy and simple. A tad on the bland side, though, without the hot sauce. Next time, I'm going to increase the amount of peanut butter. I would rate this as a kid favourite.

Very good recipe. Do put cook this too fast. Let the flavors cook together. It's better if you just let the flavor do its thing. I used hot sauce and red peper to give it a little heat. Enjoy!!

I have made many a good stir fry ... and this was not one of them. The peanut sauce was terrible! Luckily, I did a taste test and realized this before I poured it over my chicken and veggies and was able to salvage the meal with a concoction of my own, but I would definitely not recommend this recipe.

This worked out really well for a quick dinner. I used zucchini, mushrooms, and broccoli for the veggies and took other reviewers' advice about substituting chicken broth for the water in the sauce. I like that this was so healthy and easy. I think I'll make it again.

It was a pretty decent stir-fry. I added more water to the peanut sauce recipe (which I ended up doubling, thank god) to make it not as clumpy and a tad bit more soy sauce.

I wouldn't put garlic and ginger in ahead of the veggies again. They got too brown. Tasty anyway!

I kind of mixed this peanut sauce recipe with another. I used 2 heaping TBS crunchy peanut butter, 1/4 cup of water with chicken bouillon (chicken broth would work if you have it), 1TBS rice vinegar, 1/2 TSP red pepper flakes (could use more if you like it hot) and hot sauce (I used Tabasco-cuz that's what I had-to taste). I didn't have soy sauce but may use this the next time to see how it changes the flavor.

This was a hit with my family. I made a few modifications per some reviews, but over all it was almost identical. I used chicken broth instead of water and spiced rice vinegar. I used about have the vinegar and doubled the recipe since the serving size was only for 2. I will make the sauce a little thicker next time and add some roasted peanuts for some extra crunch. Very tasty!!!

After all the rave reviews, I was suprised how disgusting this dish was. The peanut sauce was revolting.

VERY good, even for my husband who doesn't usually like peanut sauces. I used chicken broth instead of water as recommended, and I actually added more to thin out the sauce, it was a little too thick for me. I think I added extra soy sauce too. Also, I didn't add chili oil (for kids) but would have liked to. Serving recommendation: it was stilly a little too peanut buttery to spoon over the stir fry so I actually stirred it into the meat & veggies before serving. Garnished with seasame seeds because I didn't have seasame oil. Great low carb sauce, as most other asian sauces called for sugar. We didn't serve with rice, just extra veggies.

This was a really good recipe. The only changes I made were that I used seasoned rice vinegar, instead of hot water-I used chicken buillon dissolved in the hot water with the peanut butter, and fish sauce for a little salty taste when it was done. My husband really enjoyed this. Now I know what to make with chicken breasts.

Was looking for something to approximate a dish my college roommate used to make. This is pretty much it! Doubled the sauce as suggested, but I thought the vinegar was a touch strong. Also added red pepper flakes in addition to the chili oil. Didn't add the vegetables, but served steamed bokchoy on the side. Cooked the sauce with the chicken for the last two minutes. Fantastic!!

Delish! Too often stir-fries are tasteless but because of the division between sautees and the sauce it is incredibly flavorful! I recommend a sticky rice and the sesame asparagus to go with - which yo ucan also find on this site.

The sauce is what makes or breaks this dish. In our case, it broke it. Sauce aside, the chicken, garlic, and ginger make a great base for a stir-fry. We weren't fond of the sauce at all. One plus: since the sauce is made separately instead of being mixed in with the meat and veggies right away, it's very easy to just leave the sauce out and add something tastier.

We liked this a lot, although additionally I wasn't sure about the peanut sauce. It's very good, just tastes completely different than the sweeter, coconut milk based peanut sauce I'm used to. Used carrots and cabbage for the veggie, and doubled the sauce.

I really did like this recipie, and seriously recommend following the "double the sauce" recommendation. However, I personally found the ginger/garlic far too strong for my tastes, and will be using less next time. (Then again, maybe it was the veggies i used not being very strong tasting ones)

YUM! I left out the hot stuff, but this dish still had plenty of flavor... absolutely delicious! I agree about making double the sauce, it's the best part!

Double the recipe. Make extra sauce.

Yes, double the peanut sauce. We also added a bit of lime juice to the sauce and it was delicious.

My husband and I thought this was delicious, and simple. We doubled the sauce as suggested. This dish holds up well to reheating, too. I thought the addition of hot chile sauce as a condiment really made the dish, and I would not substitute chili oil.

This is a great dish! I will make this over and over. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce and used chili oil instead of sauce. So much better than everyday stir fry.

I made this for dinner last night; so quick and easy! I added more chicken to up the protein value a bit. I love the saltiness of the peanut butter and soy sauce blended with the spicy chili sauce. Served with a simple salad tossed in ginger dressing. Will definitely make this dish again!

As quick and easy as a ready made stir fry, but better than the last stir fry I got out. Simply fab.

Not often does something go over THAT well with everyone. This is an amazing recipe, definately double the sauce with it though. I can't recommend this enough to anyone.

The sauce makes the recipe. I recommend doubling the sauce. I also used freshly ground peanut butter and substituted hot Asian sesame oil for the chile sauce.
