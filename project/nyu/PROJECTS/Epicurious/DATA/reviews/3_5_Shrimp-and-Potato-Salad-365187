I tried this last night and I was wowed by it. I did use big russets (2 big ones equaled 1.5 lbs.)so 45 minutes was perfect. The white wine is a very good idea. I let the red onion soak in the vinegar for about 25-30 minutes to soften them--I find I like them better that way. I thought the amount was about right. I was also in a quandary about whether to mix the potatoes into the onion mix, then I decided to pile the potatoes on a plate and top them with the shrimp/onion mix. I liked it that way but I am sure mixing both together would be just fine. This is a wonderful blending of texture and taste.

This is my idea of a perfect weekday meal...quick, filling, flavourful and healthy.

On paper this recipes was exciting even with it's missing PRINTED steps. When completed it was a tad underwhelming and lacking complex flavors. You do get the white wine notes, but after that not much more. Needed more textural contrast i.e. crunch. If you do make the recipe use it as a guideline and add some crunch and ingredients that add some depth of flavor.

I had the same question as HolbrookMA. Looks like a step is missing. I also question the amount of strong-flavored, pungent red onion in this dish. To me, it looks like the onion would overwhelm all the other flavors in the dish. I would dump the red onion and use a sweet onion like Vidalia, Texas Sweet, Walla Walla Sweet or Maui Sweet to get a better balance.

This sounds great with the wine marinated potatoes and the onions+shrimp with vinegar...but when do you put them together? Together to let flavors meld OR separately to meld flavors then tossing together to serve...I want to try this but too expensive to experiment :-(

i enjoyed this recipe as a fresh summer supper, despite my issues: 1. 45min may not be an appropriate boiling time for all potatoes. i suppose mine were a little smaller than expected, causing them to burst at ~40min. i should have watched them more carefully for tenderness w/o overcooking, which leads me to #2. 2. overcooked potatoes will turn these beautiful ingredients into a sloppy mess. for me, the seasoning was perfect, but next time, i might chill the salad an hour or so before serving to let the flavors meld more.
