Highly recommend this recipe - makes a wonderfully flavoured sauce. No need to separate addition of water and sugar - just add all at beginning. Great with vanilla ice cream.

A big hit at our Christmas brunch! I was pressed for time and didn't peel the upper quarter of the apple which might explain why most of them popped their peel but no one complained. Really good as a side dish or as a dessert. I also put the whole load into the water right up front and didn't notice a difference

I followed this recipe exactly, and the result was the best baked apples I've ever had.

To Redondo Beach...I think they taste fine using your short-cut.

I made several changes: I cut the apples in half and cored them; I soaked golden raisins in Grand Marnier and added them to the core; I put the brown sugar/nutmeg/cinnamon mix on top of the raisins; I baked the apple halves generally as directed, basting frequently. I put everything in at one time - excellent. Oh and I used Braeburn apples, which are my favorite!

made this last thanksgiving and will do so again this year. peeled, cored and sliced apples into wedges, added the rest of the ingredients and baked. wonderful as a side dish and it is delicious over ice cream.

Is it really necessary to add the additional sugar mixture and water AFTER 35 minutes in the oven? Is there a problem in just throwing it all in from the beginning? Just wondering as I'm planning to make this, but want to keep things as simple as possible...

This simple recipe outshined a full days worth of cooking elaborate courses. Serving with a butter pecan ice cream and a little bit of kaluha in the sauce made this a perfect finish to the evening.

I made these with Golden delicious apples (only made half the recipe for the four of us), and out of sheer laziness, I peeled and cored them completely (I don't like to work at eating my food), and baked them in a loaf pan. The only other change I made was to add some golden raisins (I soaked them overnight in dark rum and vanilla extract, with a touch of lemon oil) to the center of the apples. I basted frequently during baking, and my daughter wanted seconds! This would be great with vanilla ice cream.

If you like good old fashioned southern style baked apples, this is the one. The children in my large family loved it so much for Thanksgiving that I'm making it again for Christmas!

I used the golden delicicous and it really was golden and delicious. The apples were infused with the sauce flavors and I was actually fooled into thinking that I was enjoying something that will clog my arteries and kill me. What could be better?

I made this with Rome apples, have some golden delicious to try next. Makes a delicious sauce which makes gives the apples a very satisfying rich taste.
