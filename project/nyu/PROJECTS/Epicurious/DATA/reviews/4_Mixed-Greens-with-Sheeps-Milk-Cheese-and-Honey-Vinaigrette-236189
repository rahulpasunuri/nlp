Doubled this and brought to a party. Disappeared quickly. Simple and delicious. We used manchego, which was fine. Go easy on the dressing. Walnuts would be a great addition.

This has become a staple for me. Quick, easy and good.

Has quickly become a favorite go-to dressing. The suggested cheese was wonderful... but expensive. Usually toss with arugula and baby spinach, then top with dried cranberries, toasted pecans or almonds, thinly sliced pear, and goat cheese.

This is a great flavorful but light salad that will complement a variety of menus.

Loved this salad! If you can find the Petit Basque, absolutely buy it (Whole Foods usually has it). It's one of the most delicious cheeses ever.

Great basic salad dressing. Took mere moments to make and is a classic, will go with everything. I might ease up on the honey next time

Wonderful, light vinaigrette. I served it with baby romaine lettuce, sliced pear, gorgonzola cheese and chopped walnut sakad. Excellent

Was trying to replicate a salad we enjoyed at a restaurant the other night and came across this one which I made last night. The dressing is fabulous and just what I was looking for. Could not locate sheep's milk cheese @ Trad. Joe's, so I substituted goat cheese. Mde the mistake, though of tossing the cheese along with the dressing, etc. Gets a little too messy. Next time if I use goat cheese again, I will just sprinkle it on top rather than tossing it into the salad. Loved the dried cherries. Could substitute dried cranberries, although those are getting a little overused these days. The salad we had at the restaurant had figs soaked in port ~ YUM!

This is a great fall salad recipe. I used manchengo cheese, and tried Craisins instead of dried cherries. Also added some sliced apple. The dressing for this salad is fabulous!
