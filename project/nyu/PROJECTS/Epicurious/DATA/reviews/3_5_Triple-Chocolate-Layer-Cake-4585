This is a relatively simple but all-purpose show stopper to serve guests.

I did what one reviewer said, and mixed the fillings for this recipe with the cake and icing from "Chocolate Cake with Caramel-Coconut-Almond Filling." The fillings were very good.

I'm giving four stars to the fillings of this recipe only. After reading the reviews, my cousin decided to combine these fillings with another cake and frosting recipe and it was one of the best cakes we've ever had. The cook used the cake and frosting recipe from the "Chocolate Cake with Caramel-Coconut-Almond Filling" recipe on this website but substituted these fillings for the caramel-almond filling called for in that recipe. It's a fabulous sour cream cake and frosting recipe (I've made it too). Even the cateror said it was one of the best cakes he's ever had! Give it a try!

I thought the cake was too light for the frosting and the frosting was too heavy for the cake. Both tasted good, but needed a different cake/frosting to complete the dessert. Also, the cake didn't rise very much. The white chocolate and milk chocolate frosting didn't melt with hot cream. I had to melt them further in a double boiler. The bittersweet frosting had a strange texture but I iced the cake anyway and put it in the fridge. It looked chunky, but I smoothed it then added a bit more of the bittersweet frosting and it looked great. My husband really liked it. Though, I'm going to keep searching for that perfect chocolate cake recipe.

Loved this recipe...great for those who love chocolate. About Escondido....with enough Vodka, it doesn't matter how much curry powder you use!

What a disaster! I should have known better, seeing the vanishingly small quantity of baking powder/soda, that there would be a problem. Layers did not rise a bit, so had three pancake-like layers. Of the three frostings, only the white behaved itself. The milk chocolate whipped up perfectly, but stiffened almost instantly and was unspreadable. Neither melted just using the hot cream; I had to put over a double boiler to melt, then put in fridge to chill. Dark chocolate was the worst, it never did set up, even after leaving it in the FREEZER for 2 hours. We would up getting ice cream and using the "frosting" as an excellent fudge sauce. (I left the pan on the counter overnight; it was perfect this morning!) All in all, the worst recipe experience I have had from Gourmet/Bon Appetit. Luckily my husband was not picky, and had two pieces anyway, but I was humiliated.

I love Vodka too

I would suggest that the "cook" from Escondito, CA stay away from any open flame; and anyone knowing this person should hide the matches and the vodka.

I'm confused, no one in their right mind who has cooked before would even think about substituting curry powder for espresso powder in a chocolate cake recipe. And vodka? Why was this being cooked on a barbecue? You must have responded to the wrong recipe.

Stay away from this recipe-- it's really bad! I only had enough espresso powder for half of the recipe, so I substituted curry for the rest of it. Also, I added a cup of vodka. When I tried to turn the heat down on the barbecue, the pan tipped and I lost half of the batter-- it was a goopy mess that is impossible to remove from the burners. Other reviewers complained about the proportions-- I didn't find that to be a problem. However, I needed to add about an hour to the baking time.

Rating: 3
I, too, wonder about the proportions -- used two six-inch diameter pans (planning to make cupcakes with the rest), but found that I only had enough batter for those two layers. Nonetheless -- a delicious, very moist cake if you only bake it for 24 min. or so, and the six-inch cake (cut into four layers) makes a perfect dessert for a smaller gathering. P.S. used a chocolate buttercream to frost and placed fresh raspberries on top.

The recipe says that you make a cake with the ingredients, however, unless Im mistaken it referred to a layer. This means that you need to make three times the amount for 3 layers

Rating: 4
I used Folger's coffee crystals (instant) instead of espresso powder. I used all Ghirardelli chocolate (unsweetened cocoa; white; milk; bittersweet). The cake layers were done in 18 minutes. This family of chocolate LOVERS rated this an 11 on a scale of one to ten.

I was very dissappointed in this cake, esp after reading so many positive reviews. I found the cake to be dry (and was VERY careful NOT to over cook). It was also rich without being delicious. Good thing I also make the New York Cheesecake from this site as well for Christmas dessert - that was a HUGE hit.

Rating: 4
Highly recommended. I decorated the top with fresh raspberries, and made a raspberry sauce to spoon alongside the cake. Definitely leave out for 30 min before serving, and consider beating the bittersweet frosting though the recipe indicates that you should just stir it. If you are able, make this _two_ days ahead--it just got better and better as it sat.

Excellent cake. Easy to make. I had no problems with any portion of the recipe. Will definitely pass this on to my chocolate loving friends.

I have made this cake many times now, and there are never leftovers. It isn´t fudgy, but it is well loaded with chocolate. Be careful not to overbake the layers,they dry quickly and if you think the frosting it´s too thick to spread, add just a LITTLE amount of cream,if you use too much, the layers will slip. IT´S DELICIOUS.

Rating: 1
Given the good reviews for this cake, I was shocked and disappointed with the results. The cake was plain, and both fillings were almost hard after being refrigerated--definitely needed more cream in each. Frosting was good, but the cake certainly wasn't worth the work.

I would make this cake again, but I would not use super-expensive Valrhona chocolate. It didn't melt especially well, buying it in big blocks makes it difficult to measure without a scale, and I had to keep melting it and cooling, and never quite got the right consistency so the layers didn't hold together well. But it tasted great and looked elegant before it fell apart when I cut it.

I made this for my OWN birthday cake. I made a 9" version using all 4 layers, it was big and beautiful.

I thought the espresso in the cake was a bit too strong. However, I was impressed with the bittersweet frosting--very shiny, and sets to a fudge-like consistency. I only made the white chocolate and bittersweet frosting. The cake was done in 15 minutes (careful not to overbake--the layers are thin so it can dry out quickly). Wasn't a real chocolatey, fudgy or rich cake. I may bake it again since I didn't seem to have the outstanding results that others did. Will reduce amount of espresso.

This was the best chocolate layer cake I have ever had or made! Dense, moist, and beautiful.Rather simple for how elegant it was. Frosting is very forgiving. I am not good at icing a beautiful cake but this came out beautifully.This is a keeper!!

Fabulous cake. I made it for a dinner party and the guests raved that it was the best chocolate cake that they had ever tasted! I would have to agree. This one is definitely a keeper!!

I brought this cake to a dinner party where a guest was a food critic. I was a little nervous since I never made it before but it was a real hit. My husband, who is not a desserter, had two slices. It way easy to make and delicious. I can not wait to impress the next dinner party with it.

I made this recipe for a birthday cake, and wow, it turned out great. I've had many different chocolate cakes, but this was definitely the best. It was very delicious. It's just one of those things that you have to try to fully understand what I mean.

Amazing, rich, wonderful. I didn't realize that the semisweet chocolate hadn't fully melted until i stirred the frosting prior to spreading on the cake. The result was a creamy frosting with tiny chunks of chocolate and a "speckled" look. I drizzled melted white chocolate over the top instead of piping frosting. I'm still getting compliments and I made it 2 weeks ago!

This cake was fabulous. Dense and rich, like eating a candy bar. I think next time I'll just use bittersweet chocolate, although the three colors do look great when the cake is cut. A little time-consuming, but not hard to make. I loved the daintiness of the 8-inch size - it packs a powerhouse punch in a small package!

Part of the reason I liked this reipe so much was how easy it was considering its relatively elegant presentation. Also, it was delicious. I was in a bit of a rush, so I beat in some sifted confectioner's sugar to the frosting to firm it up faster. Worked great.

A Keeper, I can stop looking! I made only the bittersweet frosting, and this turned out to be the best chocolate cake I've found.

Rating: 4
This is a REALLY good cake. Extremely rich. Don't be afraid to add more of the bittersweet chocolate to the icing mixture if it has not thickened enough to spread after 30 minutes, 1oz at a time. Also, let it stand at room temp for 30 minutes before serving. A truly "GOT MILK" commercial.

Wonderful!! I only had 9" cake tins so I split the batter between two pans and made another batch. I didn't use the fourth cake when I put it together but you could and just make another white chocolate filling for contrast. I made an extra batch of bittersweet frosting and piped it around the top and bottom layers, then sprinkled white chocolate shavings over the top. Everyone thought it came straight from the bakery! Also - strawberries really finish off the presentation!
