Delicious, easy and a HIT! at a dinner party as a palate cleanser course.

This was really good. I wasn't sure how the creme fraiche/citrus pairing would be, but I thought it was an interesting contrast - I served this at a brunch, and some people liked the creme fraiche and some preferred it without.

A friend made this for our annual girls only summer get away. She had to 1/2 the sugar because it was really too sweet but after that adjusment it was the perfect summer dessert. The hollowed out limes were beautiful, the sour cream/sugar topping was incredible. She did not bother with candied mint leaves but used the mint as a garnish. Beautiful and yummy. I am now making it for a luncheon.

Just wonderful! I made this for our gourmet group. People wished for seconds! I made the shortbread as well and packed the leftovers as favors and the guests confessed to eating them on the way home.
