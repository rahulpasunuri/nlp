Holy cow! I'm so impressed with myself. First time deep frying. Surprisingly easy. I had some peanut oil that was expiring, so I figured it was time to try to deep fry. Glad I chose this recipe - these were the lightest, tastiest hush puppies I've ever had and I made them myself. How fun. As you can see in other reviews, recipe is very forgiving for substitutions and/or omissions. Big chunks of goat cheese are great here. Exceptional.

I made a lot of on-the-fly changes... Made a half batch, adding fresh corn from one ear, half a diced garlic clove, and some cilantro. I did not have buttermilk so used milk thickened with a bit of yogurt. I omitted the egg entirely and used half goat cheese, half cheddar. I loved it but my puppies were a bit too wet- and so spread a little bit.

These were delicious, easy to make. I omitted the egg, was out of buttermilk so used milk with two TBS of cottage cheese in the batter. I only used one jalapeno, and found that I like how just one pepper complemented rather than over powered the goat cheese. The goat cheese was just the run of the mill chevre log from Trader Joe's which I crumble by hand inside a small zip-lock sandwich bag. I will make these again. Perhaps with plate of Hopping John and a side of lightly sautéed kale or collards.

I followed the suggestion of several other reviewers and added double jalapeno - I think next time I'll also leave the seeds in at least one. My husband loved these; I liked them but wasn't nearly as impressed as he was, but hey, they were easy enough to make frequently (oh, used an ebelskiver pan instead of deep-frying).

This was easy and relatively quick to prepare. I agree that it needs a 2nd jalapeno (or maybe throw in some of the membrane/seeds next time) to give it more of a kick. My only complaint was, even though the pockets of goat cheese were visible inside the fritter, the taste of the chevre was not as pronounced as I'd hoped. It seems to get overpowered. But it was still a yummy dish and I will try to use it as a base for future forays into hush puppy making.

Wow these were great! Our goat cheese was a little creamy and didn't crumble well(used error is likely), so I would suggest getting pre-crumbled goat cheese, and adding right at the end of the mixing process so that it doesn't simply disappear into the batter. Flavor was still great. The recipe was a little lo0se so I ended up some extra flour, but that aside, they were a hit. Trying them again tonight as an app for a barbeque, and subbing sharp cheddar for the goat cheese....

Yum...Love these things. If you let the dough rest for about 20 minutes after mixing, you won't have problem with the shape. If you like hush puppies, make this recipe.

I rarely fry food but was intrigued as soon as I saw this recipe for hush puppies (a childhood favorite). They are delicious - the texture is light and fluffy. My only recommendation is to roll small balls in a light dusting of flour before dropping into the oil. I started by dropping spoonfuls of dough but the shapes were random and started to look like fried shellfish. By the end of the batter, after shaping by hand with flour, I was able to fry round oblong shapes in more controlled sizes. The goat cheese melts away leaving pockets of cheese. The recipe calls for only 1 jalapeno, which is a subtle addition - particularly for one who does not like very spicy foods - but I can appreciate how an earlier reviewer suggested 2 jalapenos for more flavor. These are very good, and I will make them again. For me, the recipe made (19) small ones (about 1.5 in diameter) and (6) oddly-shaped medium ones (about 2.5 in diameter).

So easy, so delicious - and a perfect diving board for all kinds of other hushpuppies... What about zucchini and shaved parmesan? Or crushed red peppers and pepperjack? Or to get really crazy, think about peaches and maple syrup... I'm just saying.

Really tasty! I halved the recipe but still used a full jalapeno and it was just enough hotness. If you use the full recipe, use two jalapenos instead!
