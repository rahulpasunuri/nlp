So good

As a cook who is forever looking for a good, fresh, healthy and tasty recipe...with a few modifications, this one fit the bill! I subbed shrimp for the mahi, added double the lime juice and the zest of one lime to the marinade. I would let it marinate a bit longer next time. The cole slaw is great...I added more lime juice, more honey, more cilantro, and shallots instead of red onion...delish! Lastly in the cream I did the lime juice and zest, but added some cumin, honey, salt, pepper and chipotle tobasco...so good! I ran out of onion so I skipped the pico all together and just added some more chipotle tobasco to the finished taco...absolutely a new favorite dish!

Look no further, this is simply the best, freshest, most delicious fish taco recipe you will try. please take my word for it, I have been looking a very long time. Mahi mahi is not readily available here, but any firm white fish will work nicely. My husband and I prefer the flour tortillas as the milder flavour lets the fish and other flavours through with more prevalence. but if you're not sure, why not try both and let your own taste decide! Of all the ingredients, the tortillas are among the least expensive. Great recipe, it does not disappoint. But you must have it with the slaw as others recommend.

This fish taco recipe is our favorite. Grilling makes it that much easier and healthier. Use corn or flavored corn tortillas instead of flour. The slaw is a must but we like just regular, fresh pico de gallo. Don't make the slaw too far in advance,,, it looses its crunch with time because of the lime.

This was a nice change to tilapia. I wouldn't recommend using tilapia because it is so bland. I marinated the fish for two hours and it still didn't have the flavor I hoped for. But this was a good dish and I will definitely make it again using a different white fish. I broiled the fish as well. The slaw was great and I, too, used greek yogurt. I found a bag of shredded cabbage, broccoli and carrots; made it so much easier.

We thought this recipe was a keeper. The fish was excellent - added a bit more salt and Tony's. Next time I'll add a chopped up jalapeno to the marinade. Will also double the slaw - it's just outstanding. So simple and delicious! I did double the Mexican Crema. This will be made often...SO GOOD!!!

This was awesome. My brother, who never eats fish, raved about this recipe. The slaw was definitely an essential part of this recipe. This is going to become a regular part of my barbecue rotation.

It rained, so we broiled fresh mahi rather than grilling. Other than that, followed recipe to the "T." The tacos were fantastic! Will make again and again.

I have made this recipe in its entirety many times and I just love it, always yummy and satisfying! Now I use it as my baseline for judging fish tacos everywhere. So far (and Im from California), I havent found any I like better. Tip: I halve the recipe for the marinade, there is always a lot remaining and it seems a waste. Other than that... Enjoy!

I found this to be bland, however with some small changes I would elevate it to three forks. For one, the slaw needs more lime juice (and perhaps black pepper). For another, I would double the chilis (I used chilis in adobo, and the sauce helped) in the salsa. Plus, slap on plenty of the crema to add moisture to the whole thing.

Rating: 4
Loved this. I made it in oven under broiler. I placed on aluminum foil and cooked longer than the recipe recommended. My husband said it was great. I used store bought salsa which may not be as good but took less time. Generally this is a very easy meal to cook.

made it pretty much as is except for the crema (made it with yoghurt instead and added some adobo sauce). And used corn tortillas. Cos there's only two of us we halved everything except the slaw and glad we didn't reduce the amount of that we made! was delish! and will make again!

This was easy and excellent. I made it with a basic white fish. The kids ate it wrapped up with cheese and my husband and I added the Southwestern slaw. Great alternative to a beef or chicken taco for the family. So good I would serve it for guests too!

Rating: 4
Excellent. Made this for only two, but made entire recipe of sides and ate all of cabbage and most of the salsa. Not sure how much chipolte it really calls for, half a pepper or half a can? I put in two peppers and it was nice and fresh. Cabbage side was great. Cooked 1/2 lb Alaskan cod for the two of us, on tin foil on the grill because the grill master doesn't like to grill naked fish. Also wrapped torts in foil and put on grill. Had with a sparkling Bugey Mondeuse rose which was lovely, stood up to the acid of the salsa. Will make again.

Boyfriend and I are big on flawless entertaining, so we made this recipe twice this week- once as a practice run, and once for our dinner party. Lesson learned: reduce the vegetable oil! The tidal wave of oil caused the practice-run fish to catch fire on the grill; we cut it in half and didn't miss it at all on the night of the party. We grilled and cut largish filets into three pieces and let our guests assemble their own tacos: fish, vinegar-marinated cabbage, radishes, and fresh Mexican crema, all wrapped in fresh corn tortillas heated on a griddle. Great marinade.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe - made everything except the crema (used Greek yogurt instead). Was a little shy about the chipotle peppers in the Pico de Gallo but next time will up the ante, but probably not 1/2 a can. Small steps. Used cod and sauteed on stove; warmed tortillas in cast iron pan. DH even ate tomatoes, which he doesn't like! Can't wait for leftovers.

Really good fish tacos - my husband said they were better than ones he had at McCormick and Schmick's. I cooked the fish under the broiler and it came out fine. Great healthy meal.

perfect! used regular red chiles instead, and greek yogurt instead of the mexican crema. delicious, easy, fresh, and healthy!

Very good, definitely would make again. My husband liked it as well, and he can sometimes be picky with veggies. The flavors were great together, but felt like I couldn't taste the fish marinade very much...and I even let it sit for about 20 minutes before broiling. I would definitely make it with all the accompanying sides listed. I did all of them exactly as stated and they were all wonderful, and added a lot of flavor to the tacos. The leftovers make a great salad; I threw in all the sides, including the sour cream, let it sit overnight, and then added the fish.AMAZING! I think I will always plan on making enough sides to do salad the next day. Double the enjoyment!

I've tried many fish taco recipes and this one is by far the best! I had to use the broiler and a cooling rack instead of a grill, and had far too little lime juice, but it still came out fantastic!

I bought cod today, along with bok choy and other ingredients preparing to cook something else, but as I came across this recipe I changed directions... WOW~ Loved the results. Admittedly I had to sub a few ingredients. The chili was subbed with chipotle in adobo sauce (2), I only had fresh parsley instead of cilantro. Without tortillas, I put the fish onto a bed of red slaw made with lemon olive oil, seasoned rice wine vinegar, a dab of mayonnaise and hemp hearts. This meal was so tasty... I really look forward to playing with this recipe again!

Rating: 4
This dish is exceptional! Fresh cilantro is essential for the bright fresh flavors, and the Mexican Crema has a cheesier taste and is less sour than regular sour cream. The slaw is excellent, and I will definitely make this entire dish again, and probably make the slaw as a salad topped with grilled shrimp as well. I halved the crema and taco parts of the recipe and kept the original amount of the slaw, which I recommend, because we ate all of it. I used bottled pico de gallo to save time, next time may make from scratch.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Couldn't get fresh mahi-mahi, so I subbed cod, which I made in a cast iron grill pan on the stove (also blistered the flour tortillas in a pan). Make double the Southwestern Slaw - it's so good that you'll want to eat some plain, on the side!

Rating: 2
Usually epicurious does not fail me. However, I thought this recipe was good, but not great. I did not use the chipotle pico de gallo and would like to think that maybe it is this omission that made it less than the spectacular ratings of everyone else. For me, I'll be in search of another fish taco recipe next time...

Rating: 4
Simple to make and perfect! I used fresh halibut, which didn't hold together quite as well as mahi-mahi would have, but it was perfect. I skipped the Chipotle Pico de Gallo because it seemed overkill. Instead, I added 1/8 tsp of chipotle powder to the marinade and skipped the coriander. Perfect. I also added tomatillo to the slaw. I would recommend doubling the slaw recipe. I ran out both times I used this recipe. Use a whole head of cabbage and double the rest. Serve with fresh avocado for California-style.

Can be any easier...didnt have coriander and still tasted great. Will make next time for a crowd!!

Loved this! I've been looking for a good fish taco recipe for awhile. The only thing I did differently was to use tilapia which worked fine and left out the pico de gallo because I didn't have the ingredients. I also made some extra slaw because I like a lot on my tacos. great recipe!!

Rating: 4
It was a hit! We will make again for sure. I added much more lime juice to both the slaw and the marinade and more garlic and cilantro. I also used less chili 3 tsp vs. 5 tsp - delicious fast and easy. We also used tilapia as that was what was available.

Rating: 4
I made some minor substitutions to the recipe including using Tilapia instead of Mahi Mahi and swapping the Sour Cream with Plain Greek Yogurt to make it healthier and it turned out delicious!! They even taste great as leftovers the next day if you just store the slaw and crema separately and cook up the fish whenever you're ready to eat!

these fish tacos are amazing. the whole family and guests loved them! make them with all the additions, it's worth the effort!

I have made this recipe numerous times. Each time a bit differently. I use tilapia and prepare as indicated, however I saute it. Both the Southwestern Slaw and the Mexican Crema need more lime than indicated. And I doubled the cilantro in the Slaw. I pass all together on the Pico de Gallo. I don't think it is necessary. A flour tortilla with a dollop of the crema and a good hand-full of the slaw and it is perfect!

Rating: 4
this is so good! everyone i've ever made it for has loved it. if you like it spicy with big flavors, double the marinade.

Rating: 4
We loved this! I used tuna (mahi mahi's not available here) and a mixture of crisp corn tacos and flour tortillas. I particularly loved the tomato relish - I used a mixture of regular and sunblush tomatoes which gave it a real richness. I wasn't sure about the slaw; I think the variety of cabbage i used (savoy) was a bit too bitter, though I loved the honey in the dressing. Maybe next time I would make it with roughly shredded carrot instead of the cabbage. Would that be weird?

Rating: 4
This recipe was delish! I made all to specs, other than using regular sour cream with a dash of salt in place of Mexican Crema. My husband raved! Great make ahead supper as all can be done ahead of time save grilling the mahi.

Tilapia also works well. Use 12 oz. bag of cabbage (4 C.) for the slaw. Mixed some canned chipotles in adobo and a little lime juice into sour cream. Great!

This recipe was delicious and easy -- even when making the slaw and the crema from scratch. For the crema I used half sour cream and half Greek style plain yogurt and added some salt -- very nice complement to the spicy and tart slaw. I also did not want to break out the grill so I just sauteed the fish in the marinade quickly. I used Tilapia. It was great.

Rating: 4
delicious. used sprouted corn torillas and baked cod. it can be a fast fresh meal with storebought guacamole. hint - a few squirts of green tabasco on top of the slaw kicks it over the edge!

Rating: 4
the flavors were out of this world! i used red cabbage in the "slaw" recipe and it was great. i considered using plain sour cream and was so glad i went the extra (simple) step to make the mexican crema. i used reduced fat sour cream and didn't notice any flavor or texture difference.

Twice made this with halibut. Even the cold leftovers were excellent. Tried it tonight using the marinade over white chicken chunks. I added a roasted tomatillo sauce to the condiments and that was FABULOUS!

These were really good and I'll definitely make them again - the slaw is simple and light, nice to have a fish taco option that does not involve frying, batter and a creamy dressing.

LOVED this! Couldn't find Mahi Mahi so I used tilapia. Baked it in the oven. Used corn tortillas. HAH! I guess I changed a few too many things to make this a realistic review. But I followed the recipe with the fish, coleslaw, crema, and pico de gallo. Really very good! Next time I'd use a store bought pico de gallo or a chipotle salsa to make it even easier.

These were delicious - I had to use grouper as I could not get Mahi Mahi, and skipped the slaw in favor of more traditional toppings, but did make the Pico de Gallo and Crema. Every bite disappeared... Will make again.

Northern Baja is the home of Fish Tacos, and no decent Taqueria will even have flour Tortillas to offer customers. Flour Tortillas are no good with Fish Tacos because the batter contains flour, wich will overwhelm the flavors if served with again, flour Tortillas. Taquerias in certain tourist areas do offer a choice betwen flour and corn, but only because americans ask for them. Fish Tacos in flour tortillas equals not knowing your Mexican food.

These were delicious and so easy! I doubled the amount of cabbage in the slaw, I think it was a 12 oz. bag. Mixed some canned chipotles in adobo sauce and a little lime juice into sour cream to drizzle over and they were amazing.

My wife and I absolutely loved the tacos. We opted to skip the mahi mahi and made them with halibut instead - still wonderful! Substituted regular slaw and added avacado for a great blend of flavors and textures.

Loved this recipe. Made a few substitutions: Cod because my market was out of mahi; chopped cilantro for the coriander; and fresh bean salsa from the market for the pico. I marinated the fish for about 40 minutes before grilling. Very flavorful dish. The Southwestern Slaw is a wonderful accent.

This recipe is okay but it's not a Baja fish taco. A Baja fish taco is made from a firm white fish that it is battered and fried (go read read "Good Calories, Bad Calories" by gary taubes before rejecting this nutritionally). It should be on a corn tortilla and have shreded cabbage with a mayo dressing. The history of this dish is well known in southern california. If you want to put grilled fish in a flour tortilla - that's fine, just don't call it a Baja Fish Taco!

These fish tacos were great. I used Barramundi, and reduced the vegetable oil. We liked them with the flour tortillas. It was a nice change.

Rating: 2
Someone commented that fish tacos have to be on corn tortillas.. Wrong...it's up to you . As an 18 year resident of Baja, I have found that most places serve both. One thing that is most common is that they are usually deep fried with a liquid batter. Usually flour mixed with egg and water. The fish is picked up with tongs, dipped and into the hot oil. One of my favorite fish taco places is Taco's Rossey in San Jose del Cabo, Los Cabos.. Their scallop tacos are good as well as their shrimps.

Made these for Fathers Day, the Poker Guys ate em til they thought they were growing Gills and Fins. We used Cor and Flour Tortillas split decision on that but the recipe is spot on. Try some different fish types to get a diff. taste experience. Also try making your own taco dip sauce MMMmmMMMM

Great recipe for the Tacos, Taste is for the better on Corn Tortillas but Flour comes in real close, its all subjective to taste. We had these on Fathers day and served both ways BIG HIT, Really BIG!! Poker Guys all gave thumbs up here. Dont forget a good White Sangria icy cold!!

FLOUR tortillas? You will not see a fish taco served on a flour tortilla anywhere in Baja! They have to be corn!

I am curious about the marinating time. i was always under the impression you should never marinate fish for more than 30 minutes. With the long marinating time and the acid from the lime, are you running the risk of getting a ceviche? perhaps the oil prevents this? any opinions?

Rating: 4
Deeelicious! I used tilapia and Ahi tuna, separately, because I wanted to see which worked better. They were both good - one steakier (Ahi) and the other light and tender. Hubbie liked the tilapia ones more, I liked the Ahi ones more. I, too, marinated the fish for about 6 hours. Forgot to add salt to the marinade so figure I need about a half teaspoon next time. I'd double or even triple the great slaw recipe next time because it softens into half the volume after it sits awhile with the salt and lime juice on it. Didn't find Crema so I subbed 2/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup buttermilk. Fantastic! Used store- bought Chipotle salsa because I didn't want to spend any more time in the kitchen (LOL). It added the heat if you weren't already wowed by the "crema" alone. Cooked fish on a griddle, lightly oiled, over my stove (Father's Day - didn't want to make Hubbie move a finger). Also warmed corn tortillas (for more authenticity) on the griddle, with just a little oil). Be brave about warming the tortillas. They become beautifully pliant when they're warmed enough. Look for a little bit of steam coming up. I live on the California coast so I've had some experience over the years (55) with eating fish tacos. These are the best fish tacos I've ever had. Easy to make, too.

I am a huge fish taco fan in Atlanta who grew up in Southern California. I have tried several fish taco recipes and freelanced many times, but never created anything that was worth repeating. This recipe is the one. Just enough ingredients in the cabbage to make it really flavorful instead of "plain old cabbage w/yogurt". It was as tasty as the fish. Similar to the previous reviewer, we also marinated the fish for several hours prior to grilling and then basted it in the marinade while cooking. Very flavorful. This one will stay in my recipe box.

okay, I don't usually rate recipes because if I change them too much then I am not really rating the recipe listed but rating my own. With this being said, I was hankering for some fish tacos just like the ones we use to eat on the beach at La Jolla. This recipe comes awfully close. Followed the recipe except used only 1/4 c. oil and marinated the fish in a ziplock bag in the fridge overnight. I used the mahi-mahi (but also threw in some cod because that's what the tacos were stuffed with way back then on the beach). They were great and to tell the truth, I did like the cod better and am pretty sure any white fish would work just as well. I had to grill the cod on my vegetable tray on the grill to keep it from falling through but it was fantastic. I like a bit more kick to my stuff so I added some chipotle to my individual taco and that did the trick. My family liked them better without. I used the southwestern slaw just as written and it was great- not too sweet but not too spicy. The mexican crema I did change a tiny bit by adding a smidge of honey to the cream as well to balance out the sour. I did not use the Chipotle Pico de Gallo as I have an old standard that I always use but it is very similar and this was a great, easy quick dish. Great outside with some chips and salsa and a peach margarita!!
