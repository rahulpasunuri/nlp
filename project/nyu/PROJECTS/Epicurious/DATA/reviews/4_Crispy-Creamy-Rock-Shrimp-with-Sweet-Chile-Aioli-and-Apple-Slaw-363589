We had this last night for dinner and it is ridiculously delicious. We will be making this again.I made a few changes due to the ingredients I had at hand. I replaced the white miso with 1 teas of anchovy paste..it worked.I used regular medium shrimp and I used a beer we had. It was wonderful. I think it would make a great po-boy sandwich.
