I only made the dressing, which was exceptional on a spring mix salad with dried cherries, toasted pecans and thinly sliced pear.The only change was substituting 1 tablespoon of almond oil (you could also use walnut)for the tablespoon of olive oil.

This salad is very appealing to the eyes. I slice shallots in more vinegar than recommended (1/2 c.) and then use the recommended 2 T. of vinegar for the dressing.
