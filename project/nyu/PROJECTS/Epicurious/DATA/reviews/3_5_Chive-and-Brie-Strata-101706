this was phenomenal. the tarragon was great and no one seemed to think about it too much. i used a disposable 9x9 pan and found that the egg mixture only looked to be enough to make one strata, but that one strata was delicious! my guests were scraping the pan after it was gone.

Delicious. One of my go-to brunch recipes. My guests and I didn't find the tarragon out of place at all.

We had mixed reviews about this recipe. The tarragon definitely has to go - way out of place. I thought there would be too many chives but they blended in with the cheeses, etc. I made a recipe for 2 and couldn't do the layers but it turned out fine. This really seems like a glorified french toast recipe. I did not trim the bread or do the soaking and squeezing and would use a little less milk next time because, other than the crusts, the bread was a little too soggy.

I have been making this recipe for years. Everytime I make it, I get so many compliments. Even picky eaters love this.

The best part of this is was the presentation & make ahead-those aside-strata was too bland to be so rich."What do I taste?" was a frequent comment, guests trying to find a defining flavor-tarragon. I'm sure there are better make aheads on this site...

After reading all the reviews I was so certain this would be a hit!! I am not sure if all the work justified the end product,and really think a less expensive cheese with a sharper flavor would have worked better with the herbs.

Fantastic. I did make some substitutions that added flavor and reduced time. First, I substituted croissants so there was no removing the crust. Second, I used half and half. Finally, I added some cambozola so it would have some extra bite. My guests simply raved about it.

We have made this recipe for both of our boy's baptisms. It is certainly labor intensive (find a relative to remove crusts and rind!) but always delicious

This was delicious. It was fairly labor intensive, but all the labor was done the night before I served it to my guests on Christmas morning, which allowed me to thoroughly enjoy my morning.

Given an adequate amount of time to prepare this dish, it's a wonderful brunch or entertaining supper!!! I prepared it the night before, and while it took a little bit of time, it was worth the effort. Sinfully delicious, it's a special treat for those times you want to entertain and socialize with the guests, not just cook all day. We served it with a Sauvingon Blanc for the white drinkers, a Beaujolias for the reds, and spinach salad and a pureed summer squash soup. Filling and delish!

Excellent! I used some green onion in place of some of the chives (i ran out) and it was great. I had to get used to the tarragon, but it was good. Very filling!

this was a great dish that everyone loved. i will definitely make again. however, i may have misunderstood the bread instructions, but i ran out of cubes and had to use other bread i had on had to finish off the strata. it still turned out great. the blend of cheese and spices was excellent.

ohhh, this is so very tasty. and it provoked numerous raves from brunch guests. the squeezing the bread part is a pain, don't worry if the bread doesn't look perfect. there's so much cheese involved, no one will notice. make sure you buy enough chives.

I have made this dish several times and always get rave reviews. Maybe because its a bit different then your average brunch fare. In any case it is lovely.

I enjoyed this, but it got mixed reviews (on each end of the spectrum). I think the tarragon may taste out of place; maybe a different herb would have been less "distinctive"? Also, it took me longer than expected to make, though I loved that I could prepare it in advance. I'm not sure I would make this again....

We really thought this hit the mark for a vegetarian dinner we had last night. We cut the recipe in half, and four of us were delighted. There are a couple of small pieces left which we will probably reheat for lunch. Call all vegetarians--try it even if you aren't a vegetarian.

I made this for Mothers Day and it was truly a hit. Everyone said you couldn't do better if you ate at a gourmet restuarant. I used herb brie and I left out the tarragon and parsley. Next time I would add basil. It's a keeper and I've added it to my holiday breakfast list.

Made this for New Year's Day brunch and everyone loved it. Rave reviews and not one bite left in the pan.

Very nice dish, easy to prepare. Used for a brunch of 23 people along with Vegetable and Cheese Strata from Gourmet 91' (this site), crisp bacon and the "Hash browns 21" also from this site. Holds up well with sterno/racks. Menu was well recieved, and I would recommend this dish to anyone who likes brie cheese. Used jalsberg cheese for the Swiss and layered it in a 1/2- pan (disposible) with medium depth, otherwise I did not change anything in recipe.

Served this recipe at a bridal shower. It was a big hit. Beautiful presentation. Made a double recipe. One 9X13 and also the 2 cake plates. Have passed it on to friends that have also raved about it. Wouldn't change a thing. Plan on making it for Christmas brunch.

This was very good. I made it for a brunch while my parents were visiting. I used a mix of brie and camembert and it was very good. Make sure you chill the cheese before peeling the rind and slicing. It makes preparation much easier.

Excellent blend of flavors. I made this for a brunch, and everyone loved it. I didn't bother soaking and squeezing the bread... Just layered it all in a 15x10x2 pyrex baking dish and poured the milk/egg mixture on top. I don't know how all this stuff would fit into two little 9-inch cake pans. It easily served 14 hungry adults, and there was about 1/4 left over afterwards. I'd say you could easily feed 15 and possibly 18 people (especially if you serve more side dishes).

Made this for Easter brunch & it was a big hit. VERY rich -- I subbed Asiago & goat cheese for the cheese and cut it about in half and it was still incredibly cheesy. A little went a long way.

Delicious! Wonderful blend of flavors. (I didn't bother layering anything - just mixed it all up in a big bowl and poured it in the baking dish. Turned out great.)

I served this at a ladies brunch they loved it, I'm getting calls for the recipe.

Everyone who I have served this to has been overwhelmed. At our last dinner party we skipped the main course and had seconds of the strata!

We made this for a graduation brunch and received rave reviews! It easily worked into a too busy schedule and left time for family and friends.
