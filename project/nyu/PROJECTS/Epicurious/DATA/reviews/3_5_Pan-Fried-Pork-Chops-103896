Easy to make, tasty to eat. I don't usually fry but really wanted to have this old standard from my southern childhood. Loved the cornstarch idea and, the reviewer tip, about letting it rest 15 min after flouring. Also, used fresh ground black pepper,garlic powder, dried thyme leaves and reduced the depth of the oil.

Excellent results and basically followed the receipe - added a couple spices (rosemary and celery seed)and let the 6 (not 4) chops rest after dredging then dredged again before putting in the pan. Reduced amount of oil (about a 1/4 inch). As described in other reviews, these were exceptionally moist and easy to prepare. I also made a cream gravy using the drippings and some of the dredge mixture and it turned out really well. Rave reviews from kids and guests. And, in addition to making the pork chops again will definitely use the flour/cornstarch mixture again for other fried foods.

Did not have corn starch but did have cornmeal which I used as a substitute. My husband is gluten intolerant so i also used Bob's RedMill All Purpose Gluten Free Flour--I can say it was not bad. I am Southern and do not think even I could cook my grannie's fried pork chop recipe like I remember but this is a GREAT recipe I would make again.

I have had these pork chops at the Side Street Inn and there is nothing better--I have made them using this recipe and I feel the same way--except I would rather be served at the Side Street Inn than be the server in my home

I'm a cook in a BBQ restaurant and I tried these pork chops. We've been selling these chops every day now and the customers love them.

I added cumin and black peper to the flour/breadcrumb mix(didn't have cornstarch).Like other reviewers, I used a small amount of oil. Easy mid-week recipe!

I've never fried anything with cornstarch - was worried about that but so many reviews were positive that I had to try it - added extra spices as many suggested - we are spicy eaters - and they were probably the best pork chops I've made - nice and juicy with a good crispy coating - I did let my pork chops "rest" 10-15 min. after coating them so I wouldn't loose the crust - I've found that to work on most fried foods. Thank you for this recipe!

i tried this before i found the exact recipe here. could use a little egg to make the flour coat better. u can try to cut them into cubes before frying - makes it alot easier for amateurs. and to add a little more flavour, my guy used salt, pepper and cayenne/paprika powder (according to your tastebud) - we used quite alot. And it tasted great. this is one of the most basic pork chop recipe u can find.

1 inch of oil is definitely too much! I didn't want to deep-fry them, so I used just a tiny bit of olive oil to fry these. Also I use some egg to get the coating to stick. These turned out GREAT!

The flour/cornstarch mixture didn't stick well to the chops. Next time I'll use some egg to get it to stick better. Otherwise these turned out pretty good! Fast and easy!

Easy and great. I also did not use an inch of oil, but end results were delicious anyway.

This was a grease fest with little flavour. I won't make this again.

I served this dish with some homemade applesauce for my gf and her parents. It went over very well. The chops were nice and crispy on the outside and very moist inside. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent!! Very easy! The cornstarch makes it crusty.

This was very good. The frying made me a little nervous - I've never fried anything with that much oil (successfully that is). But the pork was crispy on the outside and moist (not greasy on the inside). I took other posters advice and increased the seasoning with some thyme. My pork was cut thin - so the frying time was about 5 minutes total. Definately would make again.

Just like my grandmother used to make!

This has become a weekly dish in my home. I don't use the full inch of oil. Great flavor. Last time I served it with sugar snap peas sauteed in olive oil with garlic mashed potatoes. Delicious! Even my kids like this and they don't like anything.

This recipe makes a very "average" pork chop as flavor goes. I won't make it again. Try the Pork Chops with Parmesan and Sage Crust on this site. Much more flavor and much less fat. Begins with a quick saute in an ovenproof skillet and then finishes off in the oven. Very moist.

Rating: 4
Even though this recipe was delicious tasting, I probably wouldn't make it again. The 1 inch of oil was a little to much to deal with, leading to a guilt ridden feeling while loving every morsel. Also, it took me several days to get rid of the smell in my kitchen. If you don't mind fried food go for it. It's a great indulgence.

Yucky, whatever I did wrong. I added a touch of pepper, paprika and thyme. They gave me an upset stomach, my Husband hated them, and the kids would not touch them. Not enough Tums in the house to try this again.

WOOHOO....Great stuff. I was trying to make them like my dad did growing up, but I always fail. But this one was as close as I could get. Anyone that likes fried pork will love this. I also can't seem to find any 3/4 size.

This was so easy and my husband loved it. But I also had thicker cut chops and had to increase the cooking time. Tastes great with sweet potatoes mashed with apple butter.

Rating: 4
I was desperate! This was the easiest quick recipe I could find and it was great. In addtion to the flour, cornstarch and garlic powder I added ground thyme and a little ground black pepper, and I used a mix of butter and vegetable oil and they were wonderful. My chops were also a lot thicker than 3/4 inch, so I browned them for about 7 minutes per side and then smeared dijon mustard on them, covered the pan and turned the heat down to medium low for another 6 minutes until they were cooked through. I will definitely make these again!

This is so good. Very basic recipe, but the chops are so juicy and flavorful, you can tell why it stands the test of time. I served with rice pilaf and asparagus. Definately add some extra spices with the s&p. I used paprika and garlic powder.

This is the standard american fried pork chop. To the cook from Wilmington, the key word in the recipe and title is "PORK chops", not fish. wow.

Since frying is so high-fat, I replaced pork chops with frozen fish pieces to reduce the fat and cholesterol. Very greasy and burned, little flavor, lots of grease. Oil splatters everywhere, very dangerous. My mom was so disgusted that she purged this food after dinner.

These are the best pork chops I have ever made! I followed the exact recipe and was surprised at how moist and flavourful it turned out. I'm making it again tonight and will add more spices to experiment. I will not be doing my chops any other way.

Great chops. Listened to previous reviews and added more spices and did the apple schnopps deglaze...Awsome. A slight twist on what Mom made. If you're looking for moist, tasty, easy chops...This is a winner!

Used thinner chops as that is what I had on hand. Added fresh chopped marjoram, thyme, rosemary and sage to flour mixture. Poured off most of the oil after cooking and deglazed with apple shnapps to pour over chops. YUM!!

This was so good and easy. I added Italian seasoning,garlic powder, paprika and s&p. I had almost giving up on pork chops, they were so tough,but with this recipe we will be having them at least once a month.

Easy, tasty, moist chops, though I also added some extra garlic. Served with mashed potatoes and corn, I felt quite retro -- my mom would have made this decades ago. Would have given it a 4th fork if it was a truly exciting, innovative dish but, hey, they're fried pork chops.

These were suprisingly good. Stayed nice and juicy, however you MUST add some more spices. Much to bland. I just followed some earlier suggestions and it turned out great.

Crispy outside and moisture inside!!! However, as we like very much spices I sprinkle them with salt, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper and a little touch of cumin, before the flour. I served the pork chops with gravy. Absolutely delicious!!! You have to try this recipe!!!

Literally a 20 meal and you do not sacrifice the taste! Jazz up the flour/cornstarch mixture with a little more spice. Goes will with baked sweet potatoes and a glass of 1998 Johannesburg Reisling.

I have never made pork chops that weren't dry before I tried this recipe. They were tender and juicy, not to mention fast and easy. I will cook my chops using this recipe from now on!

This recipe WORKS. That's its beauty. I jazzed up the spices in the flour/cornstarch mix, too, but was really impressed with how moist the chops were inside and how lovely the goldish-brown color of the finished chops was. My boyfriend loved these, so they go on my "list."

This recipe is OK. A notch better than Shake-N-Bake. We spruced up the spices a bit.

Excellent recipe! My wife and (even) my 5 year old son raved about it. It may not be terribly exotic, but it's quick and easy to make, and the pork chops turn out moist and flavorful. I usually over-spice and overcook pork chops. This disk goes well with Red Beans and Rice, and greens.

This dish was very easy to prepare and the coating remained crisp while keeping the chops very moist. I did season the chops prior to frying for about 5 hours in a marinade of fresh garlic, a little salt and mojo. Then added sauteed onions to the finished chops.They were delicious.

Not worth making, even after adding the thyme and seasoned salt as suggested by another reviewer. Try a different one.

Rating: 3
A very delicious, old-fashioned recipe. Based on the other comments, I added spices to the flour mixture; ground pepper, dried thyme, and seasoned salt--about 1/2 teaspoon each. The recipe really needs this. Also, I after frying, I poured out the oil and made gravy with the drippings--Yum! A definite keeper.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe, although next time I make it, I'll season the pork chops with seasoned salt and garlic to make it a bit more flavorful. The pork chops turned out nice and moist...good basic recipe.

This taste just like my Kentucky Grandmother used to make. Sure couldn't have been invented by the Hawaiians! She was born and raised in the mountains. I can't, nutritionally, afford to make it often but it sure will be a treat!

Rating: 3
I can't believe that someone would make a comment about the Hawaiians because of this recipe. This is the classic fried pork chop, something I am sure the Hawaiians didn't invent. I think this is a great recipe for frying them, giving the flour a little more seasoning than most recipes. As for some people, if you want a low-fat recipe, maybe you shouldn't go to recipes with the word 'fried' in the title.

This recipe is easy to make and if you add some slice onions it is even better
