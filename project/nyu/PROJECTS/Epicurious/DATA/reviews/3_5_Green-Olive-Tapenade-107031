I love this dish. Substitute most any ingredient and it is still awesome. I love to play with different olives.

I love tapenade- and people are always impressed when I serve my own at parties. I like to up the garlic allotted- and if I'm in a pinch and don't have capers, I substitute half a pickle.

This is a wonderful simple yet delicious recipe though I would suggest, for those who like less salty food, black olives instead of green. The combo of green olives, capers, and anchovy made this too salty for my taste and my guests.

Excellent as a spread for crostini. A nice complement to a sun-dried tomato pesto and goat cheese.

Wonderful! But the best part is its simplicity. Great for parties.

Easy and delicious. The only drawback to this dish was that it was hard to stop eating....umm
