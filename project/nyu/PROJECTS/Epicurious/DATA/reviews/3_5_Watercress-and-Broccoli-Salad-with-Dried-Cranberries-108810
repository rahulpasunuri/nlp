Looking at the ingredients, you might think they'd be foul together. They're not. But they're not great together, either. I didn't have cranberries, so I omitted them, but I can definitely see how they'd work. I think the super-sweetened variety available at most supermarkets would be TOO sweet, though - the honey already competes a little strangely with the more pungent ingredients. I'll finish the bowl - no sense in wasting food - but I won't make it again.

Easy to make, pretty healthy, and very popular with my guests. Getting the leafs from the watercress was a pain, but otherwise, it was a great dish.

I had to alter this recipe according to what I had. I didn't have watercress or garlic. I added about 2 Tbsp Mayo and whipped it to make it slightly thicker. Then I added Apple chunks, dried Cranberries and almond slivers. Very Good! I would probably try adding the garlic next time if I have it. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

I omitted the watercress completely, added a couple tablespoons of olive oil, went heavy on the salt, and loved it.

I made a double recipe for Thanksgiving with friends. I substituted arugula for the watercress, and added olive oil to the dressing as other reviewers suggested. (The dressing would have been very thin without it.) Every bite got eaten, and I was asked to make it again for another gathering of the same people later that weekend.

My family was pleasantly surprised by this dish. They LOVED it. It has a lovely clean and bright flavor. I'm always trying to find different ways to serve broccoli and this is a keeper! I didn't have dried cranberries so I used frozen, that I defrosted, tossed with sugar which I let set while the onions and dressing set. I also added in toasted almonds and 2 Cutie tangerines at the end.

This dressing is great. I used spinach instead (for ease) and it was great. Make sure to have the right amount of greens/broccoli to dressing.

With a couple of minor changes, this salad is refreshingly delicious. I used arugula instead of watercress and added 2 Tbsp of olive oil to the dressing. Also tossed in about 1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds. It was a huge hit with my guests and I'm planning on making it again tomorrow night to serve with steamed shrimp.

I made this recipe adding a small diced orange. It sounded good but my family did not like it at all. The dressing was overwhelming. Too sweet, too sour.

I made this tonight for the second time this week, as the first time it turned out TOO sweet. Both times I subbed Dole "Field Greens" for the watercress (none available here) and garlic powder for the fresh. Tonight I added 2 small fresh oranges (segmented and cut into small pieces) to the onion marinate, decreased the cranberries by 50%, and decreased both the vinegar and honey by 25%. NOW it was refreshingly different and something I will definitely serve again!!!

Served this after a mushroom soup for Christmas Dinner. Wonderful! Colorful and fun, I added the orange too and liked the balance. Will probably go a little lighter on the onion next time if I know I've got a strong one. Removing the watercress's thick stems was the worst part aboput it-time consuming-it takes the 30 minutes of marinade time.

Lovely colors, especially at Christmas, but the dressing was much thinner than I like and the onion overpowered.

This is a wonderful recipe. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a chopped orange. I let the onions soak in the dressing and the orange and its juice. The salad was very colorful and delicious.

It looks nice, but we did not like the taste enough to prepare this again.

This is an incredible recipe! I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to find a recipe that all I have to do is follow the instructions and it turns out perfectly. Enjoy this one - it is a keeper.

A beautiful salad and so healthy! I didn't change a thing and thought it was delicious. I'm having the leftovers for lunch with some sliced middle eastern chicken on top!

I increased the amount of cranberries...soaked them in hot merlot, then drained and chilled... added blanched sugarsnaped peas, canned mandarin orange slices (for color), and a small amount of olive oil. It was was a big hit for 30 people at Thanksgiving....many has seconds!
