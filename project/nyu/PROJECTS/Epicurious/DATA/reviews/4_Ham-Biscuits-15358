I TOTALLY agree with the reviewer regarding fats. I have always believed that lards, bacon fat etc are much more natural and healthier in general than using any kind of man-made hydrogenated manufactured stuff. This recipe is very reminiscent of an old Southern classic called Angel Biscuits. The yeast imparts a very light texture and another layer of flavor. My grandmother used to make the BEST biscuits using rendered bacon fat & lard.

Wonderful little biscuits/rolls. I use half butter and half lard for improved flavor while keeping the wonderful texture lard imparts.

You may make this dough several days ahead of time and keep refrigerated-- Follow the recipe and be sure to let the biscuits rise after you remove the dough from the frig.

Thank heaven someone realizes that certain fats (lard) CREATE CERTAIN TASTES and if you eat reasonably, you can sometimes indulge in things like ham biscuits. Be sure the ham is good enough!
