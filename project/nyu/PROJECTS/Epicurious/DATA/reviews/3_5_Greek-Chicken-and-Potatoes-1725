I have been doing a variation of this for years. My variations make it less Greek but so delicious! I add crushed tomato and red wine to the marinade, along with lots of fresh rosemary. I poke the chicken all over with a fork and do at least a 24 hour marinade. It smells amazing cooking and always gets raves.

This was surprisingly good. I figured it was so simple that it wouldn't be all that great but was actually quite tasty. I used less oil than called for & used a tbls of dijon in the OO mixture. I also tripled the garlic - you can never have too much garlic! Potatoes were baby red ones that I quartered. Next time I might skip the potatoes & put the 'sauce' and chicken over rice.

Delicious! My notes: Used (4) organic, free- range chicken legs with the thighs (1 per person) and put in a glass 9x11 baking dish. Reduced to (3) medium baking potatoes sliced lengthwise as suggested and put them in a second 9x11 baking dish. Added additional garlic. Split the liquids between the two pans. Make sure the chicken and potatoes are coated with the liquid. I stood the potatoes up (skin side down) so they would get crisp on the edges. I removed the chicken at 1 hour (tent with foil) and it was perfectly brown, crispy and tender. Cooked the potatoes an additional 15 minutes and they were done. Served with a spinach salad with red onion, sectioned oranges, toasted chopped almonds tossed in a little olive oil and Nakano Seasoned Rice Vinegar. Everyone said it was a keeper!

My (picky) husband's favorite chicken recipe. I've made it several times and now use less oil (by half). Otherwise, follow the recipe and the chicken is nicely browned, potatoes tender. Delicious!

Even with a lot of basting and extra lemon, this recipe was rather bland and dry.

Made this as an early Valentines Day dinner for my parents. Used bone in Chicken breasts because they were on sale. Browned the breasts on the stove before baking. Added 1/2 cup white wine to the oil/lemon mix, crushed the garlic into the liquid mixture and added an extra tsp of oregano, 1 tsp each basil, rosemary, sea salt and black pepper, plus 1/2 tsp of dried mint. Threw in 2 quartered yellow onions, a green pepper and whole button mushroms to get them out of the fridge. WOW!!! It had great flavor and the family raved! My Brother dropped in unanounced and his kids (7, 5 and 3 years old) devoured it as well. This was a hit across all age groups! Did have to cook the potatoes longer than the recommended time. Next time I will plan ahead and bake the potatoes for a bit before adding to the mix and will also double the sauce and marinate the chicken while the potatoes bake. Also, will plan to add an extra clove of garlic.

Based on others' reviews I used only 1/4 c. olive oil and increased the oven temperature. I used about half the suggested amount of potatoes (3 lbs seemed like a lot...) and cut them in 1-inch dice (not quartered). The chicken *looked* gorgeous, but it lacked flavor. Very bland. The potatoes were ok, but I don't think I'd make them again.

Thank you to the cook from Phoenix, for reminding me of home. Put water in pan when ready to bake. Never saw my mother use butter but, will try it next time! Key is fresh lemon equal part oil and Season! Used fresh dried oregano since I have it and one lemon and extra virgin oil. Marinated in frig for the afternoon, brushed again with juices from pan. Added spices to taste. Added 1/2 c water to pan and baked for an hour covered than about 1/2 hour uncoved. Mom never measured this recipe either. I didn't spare the seasoning. I had chicken and potatoes for two. Finally, tasted like Mom made it!

I find this recipe to be pretty good. I made it three times now and it just keeps on getting better as I am getting more familiar with adjusting seasonings and liquid amounts. Anyone who finds the chicken bland probably didn't prepare/cook/baste it properly.

Incredible recipe. My adjustments are: 1. I use only chicken drumsticks. 2. I use about 3 heads of garlic, actually, and leave the cloves whole. 3. I use extra oregano. 4. I often add quartered mushrooms and slices of yellow onion. 5. I add a few shallots in with the sauce. Delicious! It's a standard around our house.

I followed Ms Berry's recomendation and the only change I would do is a little less lemon. I sprinkled it with fresh oregano and thyme. I dont think it needs any chicken broth (I omitted) and I did brown the chicken first on the stove..

I read Diane Berry's review (which should be just below mine) and followed it. My husband has asked me to give up our standard chicken recipe and use this one instead. Greek Chicken and Potatoes are now in the weekly rotation due to the ease of preparation and comforting taste. Definitely follow Ms. Berry's ammended instructions. My family thanks you Ms. Berry!

This was a recipe I submitted but Bon Appetit changed it. IN my original recipe, I never added chicken broth. My recipe is one that my relatives have used for years and there was never any measuring. What we always did was place cut up chicken pieces and cut up potatoes in a pan. In a small mixing bowl, combine apprix. 1/2 cup oil (olive or vegetable), juice of 2 lemons, and 1 stick of melted butter. Pour this over your chicken and potatoes. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and oregano on top of chicken/potatoes and bake in 350 oven for approx. one hour. You can play with the oil/lemon mixture until you get it to your liking. Also, our potatoes here in the southwest are hard and do not roast well at all. I like to boil them a little before putting them in the roasting pan. Otherwise, you will have hard potatoes.

ick. I really wanted to like this recipe, despite mixed reviews (I love my cousin's Greek husband's lemon chicken, and was hoping to replicate). I reduced oil as have many, and upped the lemon and oregano. I also added a bit of grated lemon zest to the juice. But, basically, all the flavor (and oil) went into the potatoes, not into the chicken, despite basting. My husband kept referring to the "oily, lemony potatoes" (there were lots leftover). The chicken was fine (oh, I put it under the broiler for appx 5 mins at end, to brown, which worked well), but hadn't really absorbed much lemon or oregano flavor at all (except for a bit in the skin). I rarely give 1-fork ratings, but definitely will not be making this one again.

Rating: 2
Like previous cooks, I used four whole chicken legs and added a few carrots. I also doubled the split garlic cloves and added half as many again, crushed with the oil, lemon juice and oregano. The chicken was very good, with a nice, crisp skin. However, the potatoes were disappointingly firm. If I make this again I will try parboiling the potatoes and adding them 15 minutes into mission.

Rating: 3
This is a good, simple dish. At the temperature given it browned nicely - no need to fry ahead of time. Instead of a whole chicken I used four legs with thighs attached. I minced the garlic and added it to the lemon juice and olive oil (which I cut to about 1 cup total). It distributed the garlic better. You need broth, to help moisten the chicken. I also put some fresh oregano sprigs under the chicken pieces. Make sure to baste the chicken once or twice, and drizzle some of the sauce over the chicken before serving.

Rating: 3
Like another review wrote, this dish has real potential. I will likely modify this next time to include much more lemon and herbs. Another option is to cook the potatoes seperately and put just a covering of chicken broth on the bottom so that the chicken is not soaked in the broth but gets a good baking.

Rating: 2
There was not enough flavor in the chicken to merit the waste of all that liquid, tons of olive oil and lemon juice and chicken broth. I could simply have stuck plain chicken into the oven and sprinkled lemon juice and oregano on at the end with the same result.

Rating: 4
This dish was excellent. I cut it down and made it for myself, so I think I was a little heavier on herbs and lemon, but it was excellent. I will definitely brown the chicken beforehand next time, as it came out a little white. I used a kitchen thermometer to make sure I didn't overcook, so maybe if I left it in, or used the broiler I will have better luck.

Rating: 2
I think this chicken dish has potential. The lemon flavor needs to be punched up a bit. I'll double the lemon juice next time I make this. The oregano could probably be increased as well. Before adding the potatoes and garlic, I sauteed the seasoned chicken skin side down in a tablespoon of olive oil. The skin was beautifully crisped. Used red potatoes with the skins on with good results as that was all that I had.

yummy! my hubby loved it! i used baby yukon potatoes and made a little more sauce. the potatoes soaked up the sauce and the chicken stayed very moist. i loved that it required so few ingredients and little prep work.

Rating: 4
Absolutely a dish beyond compare! I made this also with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Instead of a roasting pan, I put everything into a Pyrex baking dish so that the pan juices would completely cover the breasts, thus ensuring they stay moist. It turned out phenomenal!!!! I paired this with avgolemono soup (also on the epicurious site, but make sure to use Boston's recipe, not the one listed), and both were a hit ~ no need to head to our neighborhood Greek place when we need a Greek fix anymore, I can make it at home and it tastes even better!

Rating: 3
Really most delicious and good. I used boneless breasts, which got a bit dry, so I sliced them up and kind of stewed them in the pan juices after they were done cooking. I also added carrots and onions. Used an entire head of roasted garlic instead of the fresh, and fresh oregano instead of dried. Will use bone-in chix next time, but will not change anything else. Pretty quick to make, too.

The chicken was very tender and the potatoes were nicely roasted. I used 1 3 1/2 lb. chickens and cut them in half. They fit nicely in a 11X15 roasting pan. I didn't double anything else except the garlic because one can never add too much garlic in my opinion! I did turn the convection fan on for the last 15 minutes for more browing. Otherwise I would've roasted at a higher temperature.

Made this recipe earlier this week as I really like greek food. Blah. I found this chicken to be very, very bland, the kind of food I would eat if I were recovering from an upset stomach (it basically tasted like plain broiled chicken with a hint of lemon & oil). It was still edible, but not inspired. Since this makes a lot of chicken, there were quite a few leftovers. I ended up tearing the chicken into bite size pieces and cooking them for 5 minutes in 1 tablespoon butter, 2 tablespoons white wine, 1/4 cup diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup chicken broth, 3 shakes of onion powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander, 2 shakes celery seed, 3 shakes lemon pepper, and 2 dashes of salt. I added the potatoes to this as well because they hadn't cooked enough in the oven. Served over rice. It was MUCH better.

Rating: 3
After reading the previous reviews, I made these changes. 1) Reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. 2) Added 2 T dijon mustard. 3) Marinated the chicken that morning first, so that it absorbed the full flavor. 4) Cut the potatoes smaller. Would give it four stars with these changes-! Fragrant and slightly tart, nicely crisp and brown. It still turned out a little bit greasy, but I think that's inevitable since you need the oil for the potatoes, then combine that with the fat cooking off the chicken. My family raved-- which is very, very rare, since being Vietnamese they often think a lot of other foods are either bland, heavy or weird. This is a simple but tasty dish, and also completely flexible

We found this very good-not spectacular, but good enough for company as a quick and easy comfort food. Potatoes we just barely done and the chicken was VERY moist. Might add carrots nx time(sliced thin). I used chicken leg quarters and I baked it the full hour and 15 minutes. Might try breasts and thighs. Served with a greek salad made with grape tomatoes, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, red onion and avocado.

The chicken in this dish is nothing special but the potatoes really absorb a nice tang from the lemon. I extended the cooking time by about 20 additional minutes but still the potatoes had a very firm feel. I noticed that another reviewer used red potatoes with success. Maybe its worth a try. I will probably try it again because i enjoyed the lemony flavor so much.

This is one of my favourite recipes for its simplicity in preparation and its wonderful flavour. The chicken always comes out so tender and moist.

WONDERFUL! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added sliced onions, carrots and celery along with the potatoes. I also added a teaspoon of dried rosemary along with the oregano.

I baked at 400, covered for the first 45 minutes and uncovered for the last half-hour. This was so easy, looks beautiful and tastes delicious - try it soon!

A true delight! My wife and I have made this dish several times. We use boneless breasts and thighs. We have added carrots, celery and onions with the potatoes. We roast it covered till the last 30 minutes. Then, we uncover it, add some paprika to give it a nice roasted color and stir it frequently till it is roasted. We have used this dish to entertain large groups of friends for many occasions and we serve it with a Greek salad. Two of our friends who have restaurants, have added it as part of their Greek cuisine menus. Try it! If you don't succeed the first time, try it again!

Though I would use this recipe to make the potatoes again, I found it a little boring with the chicken.

This is a very appealing dish, with slight modifications proposed by others. I added 1 tbsp fresh rosemary, and cut down the oil a bit. With these changes, I was able to recreate the 'Grecian Chicken' that I always find at the restaurants, with almost no effort whatsoever. A definite find.

I've been serving this dish since I discovered the recipe years ago. I use chicken breasts ( sometimes boneless if it's all I have ) and slice the potatoes crosswise. Bake @400.

It's one of my daughter's favorites, and company always raves.

I'm a beginner cook who usually requires a recipe and my mom on the phone when I'm in the kitchen. Last weekend I decided to make this easy dish for five friends. I was running short on time, but I followed the recipe, adding what other reviewers suggested (used chicken thighs, onions, carrots and a side Greek salad) and it was a great success. My only complaint is that the recipe calls for a little too much olive oil for my taste. In fact, even though I removed most of the skin off the chicken parts, it was still pretty oily when served. Still, I love this recipe. It's super easy and delicious. Thank you.

turned out fabulous with only minor altercations, using only 1/2 cup of lemon juice and adding one medium sized onion... the key, in my opinion (via trial & erros), is to use a whole chicken or thighs and saving the stock to use in the recipe... of course, it is more time consuming but, well worth the effort and wait! maybe it's that extra added love and care ;)

The first time I tried this recipe I totally messed it up (I only 1 lemon on hand and accidentally added 2 Tablespoons of oregano intstead of the required 2 teaspoons) and it was still terriffic! Made it correctly last night. MMMMM! Will probalby reduce the lemon a bit in the future. Never had a problem with the potatoes. A salad of romaine lettuce, red onion, plum tomatoes, feta cheese, croutons and Ken's Steakhouse Greek dressing is the perfect accompaniment.

I agree with everyone that this is really a delicious recipe, except for the "potato problem," which I also discovered after making it for the first time. Subsequently, I cut the potatoes into SMALLER wedges. The suggestion of par boiling the potatoes is a great one. YOu can also microwave the potatoes, covered, on high for 4-5 minutes to give them a "boost."

First of all, this was a very simple & tasty meal. My husband & 2 year both loved it!! I used chicken breasts & red potatoes ... and slightly more lemon than the recipe called for and was really happy on how it turned out.

Loved the flavour of this recipe BUT took way longer than specified, I wound up cranking up the heat after 1 hour 15 minutes as the potatoes weren't even close to being done. Took 2.5 hours even after cranking heat to 425, although everything was golden and delicious. Will make again but will either plan for longer or may parboil potatoes first. UPDATE: Tried parboiling potatoes for 7 minutes in boiling water first, which I normally do when roasting, and cranked the heat to 400 but they were still raw in the middle after 1hr 15 min. will try one more time as I don't want to be defeated as the flavour is awefully good. Will try parboiling longer and cut down on liquids, I think there is too much in the pan and I am using a very large roasting pan.

I forgot to baste the dish while it was in the oven, and after eating the dish, I have determined that basting is absolutely necessary. Make sure you have enough oil to coat the chicken and potatoes so they crisp up. Throw some lemon wedges in the baking dish. Use more garlic, or chop up the garlic and spread over the chicken before baking. I used a 400 degree oven and baked for 1hr10min. Perfect.

I didn't try this particular recipe but I roast chicken and potatoes pretty often. If you are having trouble with the potatoes not beeing done, no wonder. Every time you will cook potatoes in something acidic they will not have the same texture. On my greek potatoes the lemon goes on in the end, that way they are buttery inside, crispy on the outside and delicious. Also the oven could be hotter. 400-425.

Loved this - Tangy lemon and flavorful oregano penetrate the chicken giving the dish a refreshing taste that's a nice change of pace. I used just a few tablespoons of oil, and while the lemon was really strong as a result, both my husband and I loved it. Also used boneless, skinless breasts instead of the whole bird w/ great results.

This dish has been a staple in my kitchen for years. If served with a greek lettuce salad and a nice white wine, it's even good enough for company! I cut the amount of oil by half though. I usually start the cooking process at 375, then reduce the temp to about 275 and cook longer than recommended. That way the potatoes will definately be cooked throughly. As a variation, have omitted the lemon juice and oregano and used lots of sprigs of fresh rosemary. It's not really "greek" then, but it smells great roasting and tastes wonderful. Great Sunday dinner. I've already just tossed the roasting pan in on a low temp., left the house for a few hours and returned home to a fragrant kitchen and dinner just minutes to the table!

The chicken didn't brown -- I think there was too much chicken broth and it steamed instead of baked. I had to put it under the broiler at the end to brown it up.

Also, I would chop up the garlic and sprinkle it all over the chicken to get a stronger garlic flavor.

This was really, really good! I am glad, however, that I read the reviews before I made it, because I took the advice of just about all of them! I reduced the amount of olive oil to 1/3 cup and increased the amount of chicken broth to 1 and 1/2 cups. I decreased the lemon juice to 1/2 cup. Used 1 tsp. each of oregano and thyme and added 1/2 cup of white wine, 2 TB Dijon mustard and (my own addition) 5 TB of plain yogurt. I also added baby carrots, celery, and quartered red onions, but would advise you leaving out the celery and carrots - not good additions! Let it bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes and it was tasty. Oh yes, don't use skinless chicken- I had some of both and the skinless pieces were much drier than the skin-on pieces.

This turned out beautifully! The chicken roasted to a lovely golden brown -- deliciously crispy on the outside and juicy everywhere else. The potatoes also kept surprisingly firm, even with so long in the oven. It's excellent as is, but I think I'll try a touch less oil next time -- I think it can get by without it. It probably isn't authentic, but I added some paprika to the chicken for a little color, a nice touch. Because it makes quite a lot, this would be a great dish for company.

Made this last night and even my picky daughter loved it. I reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup and the lemon juice to 1/2 cup. I zested the lemon peel over the chicken and potatoes for added punch. Delicious and the juices in the pan when mixed w/ the potatoes was killer. Add a green salad w/ feta and red onion and you have a wonderful meal.

There was a "comfort food" quality to this recipe. I was almost tempted to serve it with a big glass of milk, but we opted for a nice pinot noir instead. I cut the oil to less than half. This dish had a huge amount of juice, nevertheless, the chicken and potatoes were surprisingly crisp. I basted often and poured off almost all the juice about 15 minutes before it was done (simply because we were in the mood for a less stew-like dish) but I'm sure it's wonderful served with the juice too. I just loved the fact that it all goes in the pan and you can forget about it till you're ready to eat. Delicious!

Just didn't find this very interesting, and I made it as directed.

The chicken was wonderful! My family didn't care for the lemon taste in the potatoes though, so next time I will bake them separately.

I made this dish for a group of friends. They all thought it tasted great! I loved that it was easy to prepare ahead of time and cook while we spent time with our friends. Next time I will try as someone else suggested and replace some of the oil with chicken broth and add more garlic.

This recipe was simple, easy and had a wonderful lemony taste. Would easily prepare ahead, and bake later. My husband, who comes from Sarajevo, says this recipe reminds him of home. We'll definately make it again.

Very tasty and easy to prepare, I even lined the roasting pan with foil so clean up was also effortless. Definitely a recipe I'll add to my favorites. Served it with fresh peas.

I had a recipe for Greek Potatoes but found something lacking. This recipe is much superior. I did cut down on the oil and made up the difference in water with no change in taste. My husband raved about this one. Next time I will add more garlic....my husband and I fought over the last remaining roasted wonders!

Our family loves chicken. I am always looking for good recipes and this recipe is easy to fix and can be prepared in one dish. I use this recipe also for entertaining because your can prepare ahead of time, bake, and relax with your guest while it is cooking.

I found the flavors of this recipe to be very exciting! However, I will probably use less lemon juice--to allow more of the oregano to shine through--when I make it again. And, I definitely WILL make it again. My family has already asked WHEN!
