Taste wise this recipe was ok but I was really looking for a good old fashioned recipe like my mom used to make...dark in colour. Will keep trying!

I found them to be quite bland, as did some other reviewers as well as too runny. I baked them at 300 for 2 hours and then upped the temperature to 325 or so to cook the liquid. I cooked them for a total of 3 hours and still found them too watery. Perhaps less water and more maple syrup AND brown sugar? Needs more spice, too. I'd use more onion and more bacon - can't get salt pork around here. I wonder if that would make a huge difference? Maybe some cayenne? Garlic? Am I crazy? I guess I'm also searching for the perfect baked bean recipe like the cook in FL.

These are a distinctly Canadian version of baked beans, much as my grandmother taught my father to make while growing up in Quebec during the depression. It is essential that PURE maple syrup be used as maple flavoured syrup doesn't give enough flavour. I lower the cooking temperature to 250F and use my oven timer to cook them for 6 hours overnight, as this approximates the wood stove they were originally made in. Guaranteed to make my husband sniff in the scent while he sleeps!

I've made these beans a few times and after the first time, I always tweak it a little: more maple, brown sugar, or molassas. It always comes out tasty enough, but I'm still in search of the perfect baked bean recipe.

I grew up on my mom's baked beans. She called herself a "purist" and never put tomato in her beans. Sometimes there was brown sugar, sometimes there was maple syrup--she was a Depression baby, so she always "made do" with what she had. These beans approximate the homey, cozy nature of her beans. I modify the recipe, by using the Randall's cooked, plain beans, instead of starting from dried beans (there's never enough time!). I use thick sliced bacon, or sometimes a smoked sausage product, diced. They're very good. No pretention, but a warm taste of Mom's memory.

This recipe was somewhat bland. I don't have a heavy pot for baking so maybe that made a difference. I had doubled the recipe and ended up adding about a quarter cup of molases and some ketchup to add more color. The flavor was fine but it just didn't look right.

Made this from a huge basket of beans given to me by a gardener friend, requiring me to triple the recipe. A surprise snowstorm descended on us that day, which upped the dish's comfort factor considerably! I'm not really a beans person myself, but this recipe was a huge hit with my family, neighbours, and my daughter's boyfriend, so I'm sure they'd give it three or four forks next to my two. Unpretentious, satisfying and easy to make -- can't argue with that!

Should have had more maple syrup, I think. Perhaps more onion too. A little lacking in flavor for my taste, I think.
