I think this is a great recipe! It has simplified Eggs Benedict for me (which I love!) by taking out all the stress of the Hollandaise Sauce which can be tricky. This sauce is very easy and has a nice consistency to go with the other parts of the dish. It can be changed according to the flavor of cheese you decide to use. I have brought this to different brunches and people think I really went all out but it is really very simple to put together and very attractive when they are all layed out in a pretty casserole dish.

Try these changes, the recipe was adapted for a simple cooking column. Use James Beard's recipe for homemade biscuits instead of an English muffin. For the cheese, use a dry white Canadian Cheddar or a Tilamook Cheddar from Oregon. Feel free to use a low fat or non fat milk too. For some zip, try a hit of a pepper sauce; or (in my mind even better) you can put in some freshly chopped tarragon and parsley. You can also try smoked salmon instead of the Canadian bacon. E.

The sauce needs more of a kick.

The cheese sauce is ho-hum. I added a little sour cream to it, it helped. However, if you are going to pump the calories into the body first thing in the morning, it should be well worth it. It wasn't.
