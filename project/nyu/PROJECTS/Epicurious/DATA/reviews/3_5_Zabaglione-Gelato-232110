Good flavor, nice amount of alchohol in it. Maybe next time I may change the ratio of milk to cream, I think I want to make it less fatty.

Would try this again but would defintely put through the sieve--probably twice as I think the alcohol curdles the custard a bit. Flavor was great but there was some curds in it that didn't add to the texture.

Nice and boozy, an adult taste treat. It cries out for fruit accompaniment, so I served it with nectarines. I'd recommend this recipe. Fun to experiment with different alcohols.

I made this last night for friends (tripled the recipe) and came home with an empty container. I'm making it again tonight so my family can taste it. Everyone said they loved it

I dug my old Donvier out of the garage for this. It was fantastic! I made it with sherry (½ dry & ½ sweet) and light rum which I had on hand. Creamy texture and as good as any gelato I had in Italy!

My daughter is in Italy and has said the gelatos are just absolutely wonderful, like no ice cream she has ever tasted. So when I saw this recipe I just had to try it.It was so creamy.My husband and I love it. I did need a second pair of hands to whisk the milk mixture into the egg mixture. My husband was very happy to help with this. We would definitely make it again. I can't wait for my daughter to compare it to the gelatos she is trying in Italy.
