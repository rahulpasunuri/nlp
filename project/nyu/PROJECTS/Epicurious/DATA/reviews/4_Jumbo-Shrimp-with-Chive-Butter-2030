Great! I added a bit of cayenne powder and half a teaspoonful of Sambal (indonesian chili paste, similar to Siracha rooster sauce) It gave it that extra kick without the harsh taste of regular hot sauce.

I followed the suggestions of adding garlic, a bit of cayenne, and a small splash of white wine. This was really elegant and rich. Would be a great starter, was a good main course just keep the sides simple to balance out the richness. Did not have chives, used green onions and it was very nice. The sauce will break a little, if it does, just adjust the temperature. Really a great payoff for a little effort. Delicious.

Gorgeous! Definitely gonna be a starter on Christmas Day, got raves! I used pre cooked but very high quality prawns (sorry, shrimp!) peeled but tails on for aesthetic reasons and drizzled the warm butter over them at room temp and served with a french baguette. Lovely.

Very good. I added a tiny bit of cayenne pepper, and loved it!

The sauce is awsome and easy. I made this as a prelude to my steak dinner. My boyfriend took the left over sauce and poured it on the mini potatoes I cooked for the steak!

SO easy and yummy...my husbnad literally licked his plate and then asked if we could have the same thing tomorrow night! the garlic and red pepper additions were great. This will become a staple in my dinner repetoire! Not only that, but it would make a great dinner for entertaining...

Victor Ross is right. I roasted 3 heads of garlic and squeezed them into the butter. Heavenly!

One of the easiest weeknight dinners I make! I serve it with pasta to soak up the extra butter. Definitely take the suggestion of the garlic!

I made this recipe 2 nights in a row. The first time I did exactly as the recipe read. The second night I did the same except I added 3 pressed cloves of garlic, a splash of white wine and a pinch of red pepper flakes. All I can say is "Wow". My 3 extra ingredients turned this good recipe into something you would get at a fine gourmet restaurant. The scent of wafting butter and garlic through the house is enough to wet anyone's appetite.

I too am amazed that no one else has reviewed this recipe, it is so delicious and very, very easy. The only thing I do is add a touch of salt to the sauce. This has become my all time favourite for flavour, ease and crowd appeal. The last time I served it with a little pasta on the side tossed with some homemade pesto, salad and garlic bread, a must for sopping up the extra sauce.

This recipe was great! Simple to make, yet full of flavor. I used medium shrimp and found the shrimp took on the flavor wonderfully (and I usually need sauce on everything)! Will definitely make this again.

Another simple, delicious shrimp recipe. I used a little less butter and stir-fried it instead of broiling and it STILL was delicious.

Used JUMBO shrip (4 = 1lb). Pluses are quick, easy prep. Not that exciting, however, until we "dipped" back in to the marinade on the pan. Extra sauce is a must.

I'm surprised no one else has reviewed this recipe. It is fantastic! I do a lot of cooking, and almost always find myself changing little things about a recipe, if only to make extra sauce, etc. This is perfect as is...easy (can make ahead of time, and pop under the broiler)flavorful and attractive! I just added a bit of salt after plating, and gently warmed the sauce (a few seconds in the microwave) before serving. It's flavorful, attractive and rich, and 2-3 shrimp would make a wonderful starter for a formal meal. Try it....you'll love it!
