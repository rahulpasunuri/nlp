I really liked this soup. It was quick to put together and didn't require a trip to the grocery store. I added sliced mushrooms and a handful of mung bean sprouts. I'm sure I'll make it again!

Good recipe to play with and use for proportion of water to soy to mirin to miso paste. I really loved the minced ginger/carrot: made the broth a beautiful color and much more delicate infused flavor than diced carrots. I used frozen, shelled shrimp, but I was only doing half a recipe, and wanted the added flavor of the shell. But that was probably dumb, given they are very hot to peel! But it allowed me to easily separate the shrimp from the broth (to peel) after about 1 minute, keeping the shrimp very tender and not overcooked, so that when I reheated soup the next day, I added the shrimp back in, and it never was overcooked. BUT IT IS WAY TOO SALTY, and this was after listening to other reviewers -- AND using lower sodium soy, lower sodium miso paste, AND diluting the chicken broth with water. I like flavors and ease of this soup, but next time, I will omit the chicken broth -- the other ingredients should offer plenty of flavor. I added peas and a bunch of baby bok choy instead of the cress. No reason not to load this up with veggies....

This was a very easy and surprisingly good soup. I also added about 3/4 cup of chopped cilantro. I had only about 12 ounces of shrimp on hand, so I added some shirataki noodles. It was filling enough to eat as a main course.

Great soup that was incredibly easy to make. I substituted spinach for the watercress, tofu for the shrimp and added brown rice. a great addition to our soup repertoire for the winter

Very good. A little hot, so use 1/2 chili oil. Didn't find miso paste so used the instant miso soup envelope and it worked well.

This was one of the easiest and best recipes I have made to date. Though a little salty as mentioned by other reviewers, I wouldn't change the recipe.

I used this recipe as a base to create a spicy seafood miso soup that I usually order from a small sushi restaurant in Malden, MA. I also chose it b/c the ingredients seemed easy to find compared to other recipes I found on this site. Instead of the chicken broth, I used shrimp stock I made from the shrimp shells. I used red instead of yellow miso. Next time I will seriously reduce the amt of soy sauce as I thought it made the soup way too salty. I did add to the soup fresh salmon, tofu, sea kelp, as well as a tsp of chili garlic sauce for the spiciness. My boyfriend loved it but i gave it two stars since it was a bit too salty for my tastes.

This recipe was delicious. Since I am a pescatarian I substituted chicken broth with vegetable bouillon. I served it with the suggested soba noodles and edaname. I felt the peanut sauce on the noodles was too much. Instead we added the cold soba noodles to the soup...it was delish!

This soup was wonderful. It had a great rich flavor. I could only find the brown miso, but nonetheless the soup was delicious.

Even using low sodium chicken broth, this recipe was far too salty for me and my Japanese significant other. Next time we make it, we'll probably cut down on the soy sauce and/or miso. On the plus side, it was quick and easy and would be good ladled over a bowl of cooked rice - kind of like a Japanese 'gumbo'.

Very, very easy and quick. The shredded carrots and watercress didn't do much for us, so I will leave them out next time for an even less work. Otherwise, I will follow the recipe exactly as is. You can substitute tofu for the shrimp, but the shrimp does add a little extra touch. I like to serve it before heavier meals in small Japanese cups. Be sure to use low sodium broth, as it would be too salty otherwise.
