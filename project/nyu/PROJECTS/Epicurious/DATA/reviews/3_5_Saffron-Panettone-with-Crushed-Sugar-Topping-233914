Mine turned out rather dry and I don't know why. I followed the recipe exactly. I used the Panettone for a bread pudding, and it was delicious! Served that way with a warm caramel sauce, you would never know it was dry!

Delicious and authentic! Made this 3x during the holidays and I found that you could allow the 1st rise to go even 4 hours without problems! I also added candied lemon peel with great results.

This was a very easy recipe. The crumb was tender, almost cakelike, with very fine pores. I appreciated the fact that the recipe used whole quantities of ingredients- one stick of butter, four whole eggs, etc. so that I didn't have extra whites or butter bits in the fridge. The cardamom scent and flavor were very light, and I would crush a few pods the next time to get a more intense flavor. I might also steep the saffron in a very small amount of hot water for a more intense color. I used 2% milk since I didn't have any other kind, and used candied orange peel I prepared the day before (much tastier than the supermarket kind). I added some lemon zest and a tablespoon of lemon juice, something I saw in another recipe. I'm not sure whether the lemon helped the recipe. I also added 1/4 cup of supermarket-grade candied lemon peel to use it up- this definitely didn't help the recipe. Instead of using a tube pan, I used small loaf paper forms and they worked very well. I didn't do the sugar topping since I didn't have any sugar cubes but I don't think the recipe needed it- the panettone was sweet enough. I soaked the raisins in vodka overnight to soften them. This is definitely a keeper recipe.
