This salad was well liked by my guests. I too found the dressing too bland and added a bit of basalmic vinegar which helped.

My first post! When I drained the sundried tomatoes, I used the oil in addition to the required amount of olive oil. I think it really added to the flavor.

I was dissapointed with this, seeing as the reviews were so good and it seem so simple. I found the dressing to be really boring, and not that complimentary to the ingredients...though the pinenuts, tomatoes and smoked mozz complimented each other nicely, i would probably use a differnt dressing next time.

Delicious! The toasted pine nuts were key--do not neglect to toast them! Besides the lemon I also add a bit of Balsamic vinegar. That improves it, in my view.

This salad was simple and very tasty, especially with the toated pinenuts. It goes well with toasted pecans too. We went easy on the chesse. The vinaigrette goes nicely.

My husband and I were a little unsure after the first few bites; however, this recipe grew on us. It is important to get a little sundried tomato, a little smoked mozarella, pine nuts and argula in each bite. The combination of the flavors all together is really nice.
