I forgot to write that I also used lemon juice instead of apple cider vinegar, as recommended by other reviewers.

I read the reviews of the aioli and so cut down the mayonnaise to one cup. Still, it was pretty mayonnaisy. I'd like to try it with a more classic recipe. However, dipping cold asparagus in this mixture was heavenly! I have found a new favorite way to eat asparagus. It did make a ton of this dip and I hope to find other uses for it and soon!

I thought it was delicious and easy!

I'm sorry I mixed up the recipes, that is Asparagus with Roasted-Garlic Aioli and, the Asparagus Wrapped in Serrano Ham... but, if you mixed the two recipes that would be delicious or not... that is serve the boiled asparagus by themselves with the aioli!! Or, serve the asparagus wrapped in the serrano ham/prosciutto and serve with aioli!!

It does seem like a lot of mayo. In some of the aioli that I make for many recipes, such as bouillabaisse or roast pork and vegetables I use a garlic clove finely minced, and use less mayo. but add olive oil and use lemon juice and saffron threads, and season to taste. Take the time to taste the result before you serve it, and adjust by adding lemon juice or salt and pepper. The more this recipe has time to "cure" in the refrigerator the better it tastes. I have not made this recipe but am suscpecting that the combination of asparagus and ham/proscuitto would be marvelous with the aioli!!

I'm looking forward to making this. While reading the reviews I was thinking that if you add some lemon juice (maybe instead of the vinegar) it may be more of a traditional Aioli, which I always love.

I chose to grill the asparagus (used half white and half green) but made the aioli exactly as written. I was very disappointed in the overpowering mayo flavor. I think the concept is great but to overwhelm the asparagus and the delicious roasted garlic with so much mayo is a tragedy. I will make this again, but will experiment with the aioli to get a fresher, more complimentary flavor.

I have seen aioli on restaurant menus everywhere and didn't know what it was. Finding this recipe, I decided to make it, since we love asparagus and garlic, and most of the reviews were so positive. Gack! We found it, indeed, to taste like mayonnaise-y tartar sauce. Very disappointing.

Not my favorite. I couldn't get over the flavor of the mayo. Everytime I took a bite I felt like there should be a ham and cheese sandwich to accompany it....so much mayo. If I ever make it again I think I will use more garlic and less mayonnaise. But hey, I loved the asparagus!

I really enjoyed this dish. I also roasted my asparagus and I thinned the aioli out with a little milk and drizzled it on the asparagus right out of the oven. (I made it the night before so it had thickened up considerably.) I made a full recipe so I would have plenty left over - also roasted some extra garlic while I was at it and I'm putting roasted garlic in just about everything now. Great versatile recipe!

Yeah, this was a little different way to prepare the asparagus but it was still good. We also did a half recipe and thought the aioli was wonderful. We immediately started thinking of other applications for it.

Made half a recipe for two people, and the aioli , lasted about a week. We used the leftover as a dip with raw, and a sauce with cooked veggies. Excellent.

Didn't like this at all. I was probably naive to expect a more sophisticated taste. This really is just mayonnaise and tasted too much like tartar sauce on asparagus. I was extremely embarrassed because I served it to guests the first time I made it. It wasn't worth the trouble.

VERY VERY GOOD,I CUT RECIPE IN HALF FOR JUST OVER 1# OF ASPARAGUS AND HAD PLENTY LEFT OVER. I ROASTED ASPARAGUS IN OLIVE OIL,ABOUT 15-20 MIN. 350, THEN TOPPED WITH AIOLI. JUST BEFORE SERVING SPRINKLED WITH PARMESAN....SO SO GOOD...WILL SERVE SOON AGAIN FOR GUESTS. TRY IT!!! HUSBAND WANTS TO TRY AIOLI OVER PASTA...AWESOME FLAVORS!

Break off the tough couple of inches at the bottom of the spears....This is also good with roasted asparagus -- lightly drizele with olive oil, spread out on a large cookie sheet and roast in a hot oven till tender, but still crisp....Tope with the garlic Aioli and sprinkle with parmesean cheese right before serving.

Very good asparagus! My husband loved the aioli and even said it would be good on other food -- steaks, potatoes, etc. Definitely a keeper!
