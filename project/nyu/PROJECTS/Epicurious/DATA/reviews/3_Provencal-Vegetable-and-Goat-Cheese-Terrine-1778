One fork is too much. What a sad waste of ingredients and time. This was bad in many ways. For starters it was mostly greyish and off white with a bit of color. I'm not a giagantic fan of eggplant anyway, so I tried to help it along by "sweating" and then grilling it. I tried to add a bit more flavor by adding shallots to the creme cheese. As far as structure of the terrine, B A D. I don't know how anyone kept it together enough to even slice through it. It wasn't just me either - I made it for a party and even a bunch of "foodies" gave it a giant thumbs down. 7/8 of it ended up in the garbage. Very sad.

Wow! I read the reviews and dived in... Though crunched for prep time, I roasted and peeled and seasoned and blended and drained and let the terrine sit overnight. The texture and fragrance were not appealing and - no exaggeration- I threw the ENTIRE thing away after taking one bite. Ok, I've read those reviews by people who change a recipe and then say they didnt like it. I didnt want to mess this up so I followed the instructions exactly (even measured my loaf pan to make sure it was 9"x5"). I dont know what went wrong- but something did- so just be careful with this one.

I made this as part of a picnic lunch to take along to an outdoor concert. I took the previous reviewers advice and made a mixed layer of chopped kalamata olives, semi dried tomatoes and fresh basil, which although tasted good, didn't really make for a stable construction to slice well. Other than that, the terrine travelled well, looked great and for those that love mediterranean flavours, tasted sensational - especially the roasted red pepper goat cheese and arugula (rocket where I come from) layer. One of my friends loved it so much that the leftovers disappeared before lunch the next day! Would make again without hesitation.

So easy, so healthy and such a hit! I've done it many times - try adding a layer of basil, and oven-dried plum tomatoes. I serve with a dijon viniagrette which I stole from Andre Soltner's "Lutece" book -- add chopped hard cooked eggs to the dressing and the dish becomes something else entirely, fantastic!!

I have made this many times, and always get raves. It is a good deal of work, but fantastic.

This dish left me cold. My cooking club wasn't raving about it either. Nice flavor but for the time, there are much better things you could be making.

Great tasting/great looking do-ahead recipe for warm weather entertaining. Unusual for me, I pretty much followed the recipe. I added the peppers as another layer though, rather than add them to the cheese. Be sure to bring the cheese to room temperature and whip well with plenty of olive oil, otherwise it's difficult to spread. I also sprinled a little salt, pepper and herbs de provence on each layer. Arugula is required!

We substituted spinach for the arugula, which worked just fine. It's a good summer dish, with a nice blend of the goats cheese and the roasted vegetable flavours.
