Have made this recipe twice exactly as written and it comes out great. I think I underbaked the first few as I accidentally left one tray in a couple of minutes longer and they looked better a little darker, probably a bit crispier on the edges too. No eggy taste either, very good flavor.

I'm surprised that the recipe doesn't call for browned butter. I've recently learned from a few pastry chefs that classically, madeleines are made with browned butter instead ...

Solid recipe and simple to make. The base can be refrigerated and used for a couple of days. Also, you can change up the flavors.

I am Jennifer's boyfriend and the secret to her Madeleines was authentic Vanilla extract from Mexico. You can probably find a bottle of that at any specialty foods market. It comes in a dark brown bottle.

This was my first attempt at Madeleines and they turned out beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly, but used a metal pan. I also used a large vanilla bean. They were done in 10 minutes. Definitely a keeper!

Followed the recipe, but used a metal Madeleine pan. Came out beautiful, rich, soft, light, and elegant. They're more rich, eggy and cakelike than those coffeeshop madeleines I've had which come 3 for $2. To reproduce the portability of the latter I might try reducing the butter and egg, and see what happens.

Fabulous! Is indeed the best madelaine recipe!

I hate to tear a recipe apart, but I simply don't know what happened here, nor how to improve on it. I'm not a madeleine novice, but something went awfully wrong: I followed the recipe exactly, but when they came out of the oven after almost 17 minutes and with a clean toothpick, they were very brown on top but far too sticky inside, and needed to be scraped out of their molds, at which point they fell to pieces and didn't remotely hold the delicate shell shape. I tried them, but didn't like the eggy taste. So frustrating, and what a waste of a vanilla bean! I wanted to try something new, but I'll stick with the always-perfect rosebud madeleines from Nigella Lawson's How to Be a Domestic Goddess.

This recipe was easy, and turned out well: the madeleines were beautiful and delicious, with delightfully crisp golden edges and a spongy interior. I do have a couple of recommendations that ought to make them absolutely irrestisible: if your vanilla bean is on the small side, add a bit of extract to make sure its taste is strong enough to really back up the lemon and butter; and for a subtle variation, try slipping some almond extract in the mix. I also have one practical suggestion: to avoid messy spoon-drips, dispense the batter into the molds using a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag.
