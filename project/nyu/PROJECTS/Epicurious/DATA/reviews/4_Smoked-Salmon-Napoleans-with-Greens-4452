I substituted the clam juice for water and a tsp of mustard (clam allergy) Then I used 1" squares of puff pastry and only one layer to make a bite size appetizer. Very nice.

The white wine vinegar sauce is truly outstanding and goes exceptionally well with this dish! Instead of phyllo dough, I used puff pastry brushed with olive oil, baked, then sprinkled with fresh parmesan areggiano. In addition, I whipped some Chevre goat cheese with cream, then pureed in smoked Idaho trout and using a pastry bag piped them into the napoleons. When baking your puff pastry, roll it as thin as possible, then cut into desired shapes.

I used chicken stock instead of clam juice and it was great. Worth the effort for a special meal.

served this as a starter on Christmas Eve with a bottle of Krug Grande Cuvee Champagne. The pairing was spectacular...the flavors literally exploded in your mouth! Perfect matchup.

Spectacular and delicious. This recipe is a lot of work--most can be done in advance--but provides a truly scrumptious and impressive first course or light luncheon. There is a lot of sauce left over; either make less sauce or enjoy it over vegetables.
