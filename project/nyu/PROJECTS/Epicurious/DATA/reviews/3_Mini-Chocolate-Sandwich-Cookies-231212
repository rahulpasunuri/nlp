Thought I'd try this recipe for a cookie exchange - they taste ok, but there are other cookie recipes out there that require far less work and taste better.

It was too much work and the cookies came out really dry.

It's really easy to make, and I'm new to cooking.The cookies are very rich, and they're great for your WHOLE family.

Absolutely loved them! I scooped and flattened mine as you would for a peanut butter cookie - the same size, too. My 5 teenagers wouldn't even notice a tiny cookie in their mouths! They were a HUGE hit.

A lot of ratings on this one. Hope you get to this recipe review. First and most importantly, THESE COOKIES DON'T STICK TO THE BAKING PAN SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPRAY IT OR OIL IT DOWN!! This is a god send!! I'm so sick of cookies that stick to the sheet and make a huge mess. You don't even have to buy the nonstick paper either. I make these almost every week and my boys constantly ask for them. My 6 year old says he wants his own dozen separate than my older son. They're very territorial about great cookies like these. I sometimes use semi-sweet chocolate and don't bother with the rich filling. These are perfect cookies and if anyone has one better, in their opinion, send the recipe my way. Can't keep enough in our home!!!!

Wonderful and decadant...I found it tedious to drop half teaspoons of the cookie batter, so I put it into a disposable pastry bag, cut the tip and piped it onto the cookie sheet. Also dusting the top with powdered sugar adds a nice touch.

very ordinary and way too much trouble to do again.

These are delicious. I made them slightly larger than the dainty 1/2 tsp called for and still got more than 4 dozen sandwiches. Very pretty and with Schaaffen Berger chocolate - outrageously yummy.

Very good. I made mine slightly larger than the 1/2 tsp called for and still got more than 4 dozen sandwiches. Used Schaaffen Berger chocolate and had excellent results. Very chocolatey and very pretty.
