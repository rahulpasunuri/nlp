Okay, I've never eaten this before, so I really had no expectations, but I thought it was pretty good. For those who can't find farmer's cheese, Queso Blanco is an equivalent, and is much more prevalent in the grocery stores in my area. I think if I made it again, I would add a few different types of dried fruit. Also I might try combining the cheese and egg in the food processor--it was a little crumbly/grainy with the ricer. I would also make a half batch--I didn't comprehend that this recipe is pretty huge. I was just making it as an appetizer spread so I got to eat leftovers for a very long time--but that being said, it seemed to get better with age, so you could definitely make it a few days in advance.

I have been making this recipe every year since it first came out in Gourmet 2004 for my Ukrainian Canadian husband. I am Chinese American. I could not find Farmer's cheese but find that ricotta cheese works just as well and leaves very little liquid to drain. My husband who likes to do woodworking made a wooden Paskha mold for me just like the one in the photo, so bringing this cheese for the Paskha bread each Easter to church has become our family tradition. I really think the brandy-soaked raisins make this spread extraordinarily decadent.

This was the first time I tried to recreate a childhood memory. The results tasted authentic to me. This will become an Easter tradition for us.

Has anyone made this without the eggs??? I just made it and it came out good but I can definitely taste the eggs a bit--when my Russian grandmother made it, it was much more creamy, a little sweeter and didn't have any sort of egg taste. Other than that I am pretty impressed with this recipe and my first try at Russian Easter! I will bake the Kulich tonight--hoping it comes out well!!! Happy Easter!

I have made this recipe since I discovering it in the April 2004 issue of Gourmet. It was found at a time when I was frustelrated with the pasckha recipes I have tried. Personally, I have eliminated the raisens (my husband does not like raisens) it is a wonderful recipe that resembles a crustless cheesecake isn't too "eggy"which was my objection to the other recipes I have tried.

I have only used my mother's recipe which was passed down from my grandmother. My mom used maraschino cherries instead of raisins. And Farmer cheese is also known as pot cheese, so try looking for that also. By the way, this is great when you spread it on the Kulich!!

Is Bakers cheese the same as Farmers cheese? I used Bakers as it looks exactly the same, soft..white... I found I did not care for the taste of this at all. It was completly hit or miss with my family. It was very bitter with a distinctive after taste. Since I am unsure if bakers cheese is the same I am not sure if that flavor is excpected. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I was very disappointed .

Pashka must be the Russian version of Tiramisu - every cook's is a bit different. My mother if Baltic German (born in Riga) and makes a very similar version to this recipe, except she uses black currants instead of raisins - and it is delicious!

I haven't made this recipe either; I think every family has its own secret recipe! But here's another hint: my mother always makes her Pascha well in advance and freezes it. It freezes beautifully and only needs 3-4 hours to thaw (i.e. she takes it out of the freezer before going to church on Easter night).

A hint (or confession, however you wish to read it): rather than using my husband's grandmother's pascha mold, I sometimes put the cheese mixture into a cheesecloth-lined colandar set over a small bowl to drain. This would be an easy way for those new to the recipe to test it out. And it really is delicious - somewhat akin to a crustless cheesecake.

I have not made this recipe from this site but would like to share a family secret recipe for Cheese Pascha - aka "Russian Ice Cream". You can use half this recipe because it makes alot. Ingredients: 1/2 lb. unsalted sweet butter; 2 1/2 lbs. Farmer's cheese; 1 pint heavy cream; 1-2 stick vanilla bean (sliced open lengthwise); 3/4 lb sugar squares; 1/2 cup white raisins; 1/2 cup blanched almonds chopped fine; 1/2 cup red cherries, chopped and drained. cheese cloth, mold or Flower pots. Directions: Cook vanilla bean, cream and sugar over low heat. Stir constantly and cook over very low heat 20 minutes after boiling. Consistency should be creamy and thick. Cool. Strain farmer's cheese (I use a potato ricer). Whip butter and cheese together until fluffy. Beat until blended smoothly. Add almonds, cherries, raisins. Moisten cheesecloth in cold water. Place in flower pot. Pour mixture into molds or flower pots. Refrigerate for 12 hours or more. A weight can be placed on top of mold to help drain.
