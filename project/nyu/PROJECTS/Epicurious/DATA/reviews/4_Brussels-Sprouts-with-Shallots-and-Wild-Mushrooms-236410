This was pretty good. Not spectacular, but pretty good. The combo of earthy flavors was nice. Made for Thanksgiving, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I don't like deep frying shallots, so I caramelized them instead.

Made for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. We prepared the shallots the day before and stored (as suggested). We roasted the sprouts earlier in the day. It came together beautifully! Made again tonight without the shallots and it was still very tasty.

Made as a Thanksgiving side and followed recipe exactly. It was good but too time consuming for a side dish... I would make again without deep frying the shallots.

It turned out very good. I did not fry the shallots bur saute them with butter. It is harvesting time for the Sprouts here in the Southern Hemisphere so I will be preparing this dish a lot.

This is a great base recipe with many opportunities to enhance and experiment. I haven't read all the reviews but, I do think any mushrooms can be used with thyme and white wine being optional. I did add Hazelnuts but walnuts, pine nuts, would work just as well. I added balsamic vinegar at the end to deepen the flavors. .

Such a fantastic recipe! I've made this twice and have these modifications/suggestions: -Baby bellas instead of chanterelles (cheaper and they suck up the wine) -Add a small handful of freshly toasted pine nuts -Add the brussel sprouts to the mushrooms at the very last second to keep them from getting soggy -Smush the whole thing together with a few healthy chunks of goat cheese right before serving

DIVINE! I always wanted to like Brussels sprouts, but was always completely disappointed when I tried them. Got some very tiny, very fresh sprouts (still on the stem) in my farm bag and gave them a try. This recipe is proof God loves us! Yum!

Very straight-forward and tasty. Followed the other tips and roasted the sprouts for 15 on 400 and 15 on 425, then did another 5 @ 425. Crispy shallots are a pain, but WORTH IT.

Roasting Brussels Sprouts is definitely the best way to get that wonderful nutty flavor. This recipe is probably not worth doing again, however. It was good, just nothing spectacular. The mushrooms didn't have much flavor despite the wine and thyme. I would keep them simple and use white button mushrooms, which might absorb the flavors better.

This recipe will convert all those who have had bad experiences with nasty, boiled, poorly cooked, mushy and gross brussel sprouts. This will reverse the years of vegetable abuse they endured as children. I've made this innumerable times and it's decimated by the masses each time. Oh, I skip the shallots. Too much of a mess and hassle for me.

I loved the idea of these combination of flavors, but had a few issues with the recipe. First off, to brown mushrooms it's extremely important that you do not crowd them in the saute pan. Otherwise, they will sweat too quickly, get liquidy, and then steam instead of browning. Make sure you have very large pan or use multiple pans, or brown in batches. Secondly, my shallots became horribly bitter, so I ended up not using them. It seems they need to be cooked at a lower heat and not browned too much. Other than that, this was good and made a great Thanksgiving side.

My 11-year old niece couldn't stop eating them! Everyone loved these even those who dislike brussels sprouts. I used mini-brussels from the farmer's market and adjusted the roasting time to 20 minutes. Each step to recipe definitely added to the dish, including the fried shallots which I made the night before. Next time I would probably add more wine in creating the glaze as my mushrooms seemed to soak up the recommended amount immediately. Definite keeper!

Rating: 4
This was great for Thanksgiving - a great side that replaces that gross green bean thing people like. I think that without the fried shallots and maybe a tad less butter the sprout/fancy mushroom combo is delicious and healthier for more everyday meals. I agree with the person who wrote about brightening the dish with a squeeze of lemon...was good that way.

Rating: 4
This was a first for us as neither myself or husband has had brussels sprouts before. This recipe was just awesome. As others suggested, I roasted at 400 for 15 and 425 for 15. I also just fried the shallots in butter then added the mushrooms and such. Will be a keeper in my house! *I may try adding a bit of lemon at the end to brighten it up a bit

This recipe is SO delicious! I have never liked brussels sprouts before, but after reading about how fantastically healthy they are, thought I would give them another try. So glad that I did, especially starting with this recipe! I did not fry the shallots as that gets messy, so I sauteed them in olive oil instead. They were not crispy but they contributed greatly to the overall deliciousness of the dish.

SO good! A perfect fall dish. I used the button mushrooms I had on hand and skipped the shallots because I didn't have any. Everything came out perfectly for me following the directions.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I was cooking a quiche simultaneously so i simplified the recipe and kept the temperature at 425 for 25 minutes. The brussel sprouts came out perfectly. I also used what I had on hand - crimini mushrooms, which I thinly sliced. I sauteed the shallots in the butter and added the mushrooms to the pan later since I didn't feel like contributing another pan to my growing dishwashing cue. Additionally I winged all the quantities since I was making a meal for two, not twelve, and i didn't have the proper proportions anyways. It's a very robust recipe that handles a lot of substitution beautifully.

Yum - but the sprouts did get a bit too brown, so I'd go with the 15 min at 400, 15 min at 425 suggestion from another poster (rather than saute - roasting gets 'em nuttier). Cooking the shallots and mushrooms separately is a pain, but worth it, to keep the flavors distinct and fresh. Oyster mushrooms are wonderful in this.

This recipe is great. I think it is easier to cook the shallots in a pan with a little olive oil and then add the mushrooms with the butter. No reason to fry them separately with all that oil. I would also recommend keeping an eye on the brussel sprouts when you roast them. Mine were a little over done.... but still delicious.

Simple and delicious. I skipped the shallots, which seemed too labor intensive. Used more olive oil on the brussels sprouts as it helped them to roast better, and next time will use less butter on the mushrooms to balance out the extra oil.

This is a keeper! I made this twice in the last week. I added a bit more olive oil because the Brussels sprouts roast better. Second time around, I roasted for 15 min. at 400 degrees and then 425 for the last 15 min. I did add some water like past reviews to help keep the Brussel Sprouts moist. In retrospect, would use less butter. Not really necessarsy. I also made the shallots ahead of time. Like one review mentioned, keeping them air tight only made not crunchy. I had to reheat in the toaster oven to get them crunchy. Really delicious!

Delicious!! Brussels were sweet, shallots were great and mushrooms were rich. The combo worked well. I used the Cook's notes because I like getting things done ahead of time, but it you don't, there could be a time management problem, for this recipe has many steps and if entertaining, will keep you in the kitchen instead of enjoying your guests.

I love this recipe and have made it, or variants thereof, many times. Roasting the sprouts is just a brilliant thing and imbues them with a nutty/woodsy flavor. In fairness, I tend to skip the deep-fried shallots as they're kind of a pain. Bottom line: love 'em and will keep making them.

also I used a lot less butter and salt.

Great, but you can cut down on prep time by sauteing brussel sprouts (quartered) in (less) olive oil and jarred minced garlic, takes 6-7 minutes. Add them to wine mushroom mixture before wine has totally reduced and the liquid will help cook them more if you need to. I left out shallots and didn't add water to mushrooms.

Love this one! Great as is, but I've tried variations since that work well - skip the mushrooms, deglaze with beer instead of wine, etc. To make the meal go quicker, I've paired with fish steamed in parchment paper in the same oven for the last 10 minutes of the baking time.

I was sort of surprised to see this recipe has Four forks. Just sort of. It's good -- if the ingredients appeal to you, as they did me, by all means give it a try. I have made this dish twice and I just feel like it's a touch labor-intensive for the end result. That said, I will probably make it again. Maybe with practice the process will quicken.

Made this once after I bought some brussel sprouts on sale. Incredible. Did not fry the shallots but instead sauteed them -- would likely be good fried but not worth the hassle. I made this dish for a second time on Thanksgiving. Due to some family that believes they don't like brussel sprouts, I halved the recipe and made one dish of brussels sprouts and one dish with roasted green beans as a base.Both turned out very well. If doing green beans, you only need to roast for 15 minutes or so.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe at Thanksgiving and kept getting raves about it. The roasted brussel sprouts really make the dish. Keep checking the sprouts to make sure they don't burn since there can be a lot of differences between the thickness of the outer leaves and some can be more delicate than others. The recipe is fairly straightforward and you can turn this out pretty quickly if you manage your time efficiently. The shallots were addicting to even eat on their own. Maybe others didn't use quality shallots? It was one of the things people liked most. Wild mushrooms can get expensive but since mushrooms tend to be pretty forgiving, I'm sure other standard types would also work ok. I made it a secord time since and it was a hit yet again, and I've already been asked to make it again for next Thanksgiving.

Rating: 1
Just ok. I love brussel sprouts, but the mushrooms (used chantrelles) were a distraction, and the shallots didn't even show up as a flavor. I'll continue with my usual: halved, tossed w/ melted butter, s&p and roasted at 400 for 20 min.

Rating: 3
Pretty good. Will make again. Easy to overcook sprouts, so do be careful. Just used baby bellas. I had recently made a mushroom dish with thyme and thought the thyme taste was too strong, so instead here I used a pinch of herbes de provence. Once the dish was done, I tossed it with grated Parm-Reg, a little olive oil, and spaghetti, made a great main course that way. Probably could use hot spices such as cayenne, paprika, or crushed red pepper here also.

This is a keeper! I was running behind so I roasted the sprouts using convection. Worked out swell. Did everything else the day before and all went well. Used button and shitake due to budget constraints. All 19 of my Christmas guests loved it. Okay, there was one that didn't! There's always one! :)

Rating: 4
Definite winner for Sprouts. I like to roast the mushrooms in the oven too, which eliminates the wine at roasting time. So a wine/butter/thyme saute can be added in final assembly. Fried shallots are fine, but a bit of an option based on the extra labor and mess. If omitted, shallots can be roasted with the sprouts or mushrooms/ Definitely a recipe to rely on.

I made this for Thanksgiving and will now share it on Christmas. Growing up I always had sprouts on Christmas Eve and considered them tradition so I was looking for a way to incorporate them into my family's holiday dinner...this was it! Everyone enjoyed them, even those who said they didn't like brussel sprouts! I sauted pancetta bacon and added it to the sprouts while they roasted.YUM!

Great dish...served it at Thanksgiving and all loved it. a bit time and work intensive, but well worth it.

Fabulous as is. I thought this was extremely easy and straightforward, even frying the shallots. I used a small, 7" skillet, which made the oil layer deeper. It wasn't time-consuming to look over into the skillet, give it a shake, every couple of minutes, while I was doing something else. Very likely, that step could be done later, closer to serving or recrisped in the oven. Most important, IMO, there's no way you should be adding any liquid to the brussels sprouts while they're roasting. If you do, you might as well boil or steam them. The browned bits are leaves are integral to roasted veg. Don't be afraid of them or think they're ruined as a result. I loved the browned parts and couldn't stop nibbling on them. Definitely something to make again with different mushroom combinations. This time I used shitake and crimini.

Rating: 4
A Thanksgiving hit! All nine people loved it and 3 did not previously even like Brussells Sprouts; I couldn't get the recipe to them fast enough. I used fresh Chanterelles - fewer than the recipe called for. They looked beautiful layed down the center of the serving dish on top of the Brussells Sprouts with the CRISP Shallots layed over the mushrooms. Hint: to keep the shallots crisp after frying, I placed them between 4 layers of paper towels in an oven- proof dish in a very low oven and added them just prior to serving.

Everyone loved it... received rave reviews. I sautéed the shallots instead of frying... very tasty. I do agree that this is more of a "mushroom dish" than a brussel sprout dish. If possible, definitely try to use more exotic mushrooms& it gives it a woody, autumnal flavor. Make sure not to over cook the brussel sprouts during the roasting process. Over cooked sprout become bitter& this is usually why a lot of people think they dont like brussel sprouts.

This recipe was okay, and I will make it again with some changes. There were far too many mushrooms and not enough brussels sprouts for my taste. Also, frying the shallots was a lot of work for very little return. They just soften when you add them to the dish. Next time, I will increase the brussels sprouts, decrease the mushrooms, and sautee onions with the mushrooms instead of frying shallots. This recipe is a very nice idea, and you might like it as is, but it was more of a mushroom dish than anything else.

This recipe gets 4 forks for just the brussel sprouts and crispy shallots part of the recipe. So good! The mushrooms are great, but next time I make I will omit that part, partially because 1 1/4 lbs of shitake mushrooms costs about $15.

This was good but didn't get any raves. The kids didn't like it, and I didn't convert any brussels sprout "haters". Since I had to share the oven with a whole turkey, I roasted the brussel sprouts at 325 for around 40 minutes and let them sit, and reheated in the oven before serving. I halved the recipe, and used Trader Joe's fried onions to save a step. This was great at room temperature which would make it a great pot luck or brunch dish.

Brussel sprouts have been controversial in my house for years. I love them and everyone else hates them. This recipe changed my husbands mind and kind of changed my children's minds. I do recommend a few changes. 450 degrees for 35 minutes is is too hot and too long to cook the brussel sprouts. The leaves burn and re bitter. Reduce the heart to about 375 degrees, stir frequently, and cook about 25 minutes depending on the size of your sprouts. Sautee the shallots in olive oil and add the garlic to the shallots instead of the sprouts to reduce burning. Carmelize the onions and garlic together. Cook the mushrooms in half olive oil and half butter, instead of all butter. Delicious!

I loved this dish! I made it for a family dinner and even those who said they don't usually like brussel sprouts ended up eating them. I made the fried shallots in the morning, drained them, the put them in a container. That didn't work, they ended up soggy and not so tasty. It was a lot of work, so next time I'll just carmelize them or will will just used those silly canned things if its just for immediate family.

This is one fabulous brussels sprouts recipe. I made it for Christmas dinner and even those clamining to hate brussels sprouts liked this dish. Based on other warnings of the sprouts burning in the oven, I modified the recipe a bit cooked the brussels sprouts cut-side down on a sheet pan (still oiled and seasoned per recipe) at the recommended temperature. Once the sprouts browned, I reduced the temperature by 50 degrees and poured water into the pan, just to cover the bottom of the sprouts, and let them cook / steam until tender. This gave a tender sprout that wasn't dreid or burned. Making the shallots a day ahead of time was no problem. They also make a yummy addition to a salad topped with a creamy dressing. I used baby bellas instead of mixed wild mushrooms. Couldn't really justify the price of wild mushrooms in this case. I will certainly make this again.

This is a great combination of flavors to add to basic brussel sprouts. I used portobello mushrooms since the looked the most fresh at the market. As far as deep frying the shallots go, it seemed too much. I sauteed them in a little olive oil in very hot pan so they retained their crispness.

We eat Brussels sprouts frequently during the winter and this recipe is a keeper. One way to keep your sprouts from blackening is to give the pan a good back-and-forth shaking (or toss w/ wooden spoon) 3/4 of the way thru the roasting time. Works every time for me!

I paired this with smoked turkey, wild rice with roasted red peppers & toasted almonds (from Epicurious), and butternut squash with fruit chutney for Thanksgiving dinner. I have to say, it was a perfect combo. I used only oyster mushrooms and next time will try the mix - also roasting at a lower temperature. But this one's a keeper.

Made for a family Thanksgiving where there were few brussel sprouts fans. It was the hit of the meal! Everyone tried it and loved it. My sprouts browned a bit too much so I'll take out a few minutes earlier next time. A variety of wild mushrooms was worth the extra expense. The only shortcut I might take is using canned fried onions on top. I didn't think the shallots added enough to the dish to be worth the time and effort. Great dish.

Yum yum!! We bought an entire stalk of brussel sprouts at the farmer's market this weekend, so I was looking for some new ways to prepare them. This is a winner! I just used some cremini mushrooms because that's all I had in the house, but they were so delicious with the sprouts. I also didn't have thyme, but I did have sage so used that instead and loved it. We paired this with lamchops (the rosemary and garlic ones, also from Epicurious.com) and it was really a fantastic meal. My fiance even said that if brussel sprouts can be this good, we should buy them more often!

I took the advice of the other reviewers and sauted the brussels sprouts with a little veggie broth and sherry. Making a sauce from the wild mushrooms is a must, since it infuses the brussels with a rich, woody taste.

I'd definitely would make this recipe again but I wouldn't put my fried shallots in a sealed plastic bag. They got soggy. I would try a larger dry container where the fried shallots can sit on a paper towel without being compressed. Also, I followed the advice of others, who rated this recipe, and cooked my brussel sprouts at a lower temperature, 350 degrees, for 25 minutes. They were perfect and the garlic didn't get bitter.

I loved this recipe! It was my first time cooking brussel sprouts and will definitely make this again. It was totally delicious. The only recipe adjustment I made was that I turned the oven down to 350 after the first 20 minutes so prevent the sprouts from getting too heavily roasted. It all came together perfectly. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it. Transported well, too, as I was able to put the finishing touches with the mushrooms and final assembly when it was time to eat.

I roasted the brussels sprouts at 400 degrees for a total of 22 minutes, shaking every 5 minutes or so and flipping them over halfway through. They got delicious caramelized. Even the brussels sprouts skeptics at the table loved them. Had to go to 2 stores to get 3 kinds of mushrooms, but it was worth it. This one will be back on the table soon - no need to wait for next Thanksgiving!

I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe has promise but needs some work to improve it. I love the enhancement that mushrooms and onions add to a vegetable. My roasted and halved Brussels sprouts were dry and chewy and not tender. I think that the amount of butter and oil in this recipe were excessive. I fried my shallots in a very small amount of butter, and used only about 2 tablespoons of butter for the mushrooms. I'll try this recipe again, but I'll probably just boil or saute the sprouts instead of roasting them.

Couldn't get the mushrooms, so made this without, an omission that was probably a mistake, since the result was a bit dry. Worth trying again with the mushrooms included. However, roasting the sprouts resulted in blackened, dry, papery leaves on the outsides, which were very unappetizing. In the second attempt, will pan braise the sprouts instead. NB: while the recipe says to fry the shallots until "golden brown," it's better to take them out of the oil while still just golden. Those that got even the least bit brown turned bitter, while the golden ones were sweet, crunchy and delish.
