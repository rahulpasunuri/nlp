Good recipe. I substituted herbes de provence for the garlic and red pepper. It worked well with the spinach and mushrooms.

This was good! I too had boneless skinless chicken breasts so I sliced them in half and put the stuffing inside and the butter just on the top. I thought the stuffing was a little bland so I added some garlic salt and some parmesean cheese. I also used cream cheese instead of sour cream because it's what I had. But came out tasty! Needed more than 30 minutes, although maybe my oven is off because everything in there tends to take longer than recipes say.

Did the rolled chicken breast idea...great. Covered in foil with holes poked to keep moist...awesome. But it just didn't have enough flavor. Maybe I didn't use enough salt and pepper in the stuffing, but it seemed like this was destined to have more of a punch than it actually did with the red pepper flakes and garlic. I would make it again, but adding parmesan and more salt to the filling and more red pepper flakes to the mushrooms during the first cooking step.

I added some lemon juice in the last five minutes of baking and it added a delicious tang! Also, I cut the butter in half and used olive oil instead and because I didn't have any mushrooms I put onions and tomatoes in the pan and sauteed them before adding the spinach and it was delicious.

This is really a great combo of tastes. I modified it a bit: First I almost doubled the amount of fresh spinach, when wilted it just didn't seem like enought. Second I started with some slivered almonds I had in the pantry and chopped them rather than grinding into a powder, the chunky nuts gave a nice texture to the pallete. Third we used large boneless / skinless breasts, pounded out with a meat mallet, then rolled the stuffing mixture into them and bound with string. Make a little extra of the garlic butter and put an ample amount on top of each rolled breast in the baking pan. This was an excellent meal and really simple to prepare, I like that

I halved this recipe and used skinless chicken, bone in and replaced the sour cream with philly cream cheese. I also used tooth picks and string to secure the stuffing. I covered the chicken to prevent moisture from escaping. I served it with a fragrant red rice from Bali, however I would recommend serving it with a spinach salad with walnuts, maple syrup and goat cheese. The nuts and cheese in each dish will blend well. Succulent dish! Suzanne Taker

Made exactly as recipe specified and was delicious. Worth the indulgence of using chicken breast with skin.

Yum! I stuffed mine with Boursin cheese and sundried tomatoes. Don't forget to baste the chicken as it cooks; otherwise, it might dry out. Great weekday, easy, fast meal!

I thought this dish was delish! It's a little bit more work than I like for an everyday recipe but as we're a small family, I made the full recipe, stuffed only 3 breasts and froze the remaining butter & spinach stuffing for a later time. They defrosted & cooked up fine. I also used boneless skinless breasts and sliced & stuffed them instead of skin on.

Definitely worth repeating even with substitutions. Be sure to salt the breasts and let sit prior to adding butter and stuffing, it helps chicken to absorb more flavor.

This is worth keeping in the recipe box. Substituting boursin cheese for the sour cream was a great idea. To grind the almonds, I used a coffee bean grinder. Using organic chicken breasts minus the skin worked perfectly. For lower cholesterol, use canola oil buttery spread instead of full on butter. Covering the pan loosely with aluminum foil with holes on top helped keep the chicken moist although I found it had to bake for close to an hour. Awesome recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I, too, skipped the dijon mustard and honey. I also breaded the chicken, and my guests couldn't get enough! This recipe is going into my box.

I loved it! I made this recipe substituting the sour cream with Boursin Cheese and used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I made enough stuffing for 6 breasts, but only used 3 breasts and put the rest of the stuffing on top. I baked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for another 20 minutes. The chicken was juicy and the stuffing was great!

I changed this recipe somewhat. Used 2 skinless boneless breasts and cut a pocket. Used frozen chopped spinach, thawed. Mixed 1 cup of spinach with 2 T. cream cheese, 2 T. grated parm cheese and 1/2 t. ground almond. Spread the garlic butter inside the pocket of the chicken, topped with spinach mixture and pinned together with toothpicks. Spread more garlic butter on top and sprinkled with grated mozz. cheese. Baked in a glass dish Covered with foil for 20 minutes, removed foil and baked for a further 10 minutes. Really juicy and tasty! Had leftover butter and spinach mixture so could have made 3 or possibly 4 chicken breasts with this amount.

This was a big disappointment. The garlic butter smelled wonderful but the chicken was dry and bland. I even added sun dried tomatoes, additional cheese and garlic to dress up. Needed a sauce to counter the dry texture. This used up left over spinach and mushrooms but next time I wouldn't bother.

This recipe was great! I followed some other's advice and add cheese to the filling instead of nuts, I used feta. I made this meal with the roasted potatoes and herbs and I just grilled some aspargus to go with it. It was fantastic, the left-overs were even tasty. I liked this so much I am going to make it again next weekend.

I too used the parmasan cheese instead of almonds. I also did not use as much of the sour cream as specified but it still came out somewhat runny. Also, the butter/parsley/garlic mixture just ran off the chicken while cooking, so I'm not sure if I did that right or if the chicken was just supposed to cook in the mixture. Never the less, the meal was fantastic, I served the chicken with roasted red potatos and lemon. YUM!

recipe was ok, definetly lacking something. I put parmesan in like others suggested, subsituted pine nuts for the almonds. I think it needs more cheese, like swiss or jack. I will try again with some additions.

I followed the advice of others and used parmesan instead of almonds. I loved the garlic butter and would make it again. However, I did not care for the stuffing. I have had similar dishes with goats cheese stuffing and they were much better. The stuffing became a melty mess and was not really tasty. I think the chicken would have been better made only with the garlic butter and no stuffing.

Made this with a red pepper/goat cheese pasta dish that finished the meal off well. Everyone loved the chicken and thought it looked very hard to make. Cheese and Portabello's would be a great addition to it next time.

My lovely man made this dish with a few alterations. It was fabulous. Substituted parm for the almonds, as suggested, used boneless, skinless breasts, and topped with smoked mozzerella. The mozz gave it a great flavor that was even better reheated the next day for lunch. Use the smoked mozz--it makes all the difference. Really, really good stuff.

I brought whipping cream to a boil and spooned it over the top before serving. I think it added alot of moisture to the chicken.

I love this recipe for its simplicity and flavor. I have used both skinless and skin-on breasts with great results. As recommended in an earlier review, a little parmesan cheese in the mushroom mixture adds another wonderful layer of flavor. Be sure to make plenty of extra garlic butter. It's great for cooking everything from veggies to omelets!

We loved this! I do a goat-cheese stuffing recipe for chicken sometimes and liked this much more - even with low fat sour cream. Rich, flavorful and delicious.

I'm not sure what I did wrong - other than use skinless chicken, but it did not come out right. The garlic butter smelled great though, I think I'll make some just for eating on bread.

I followed the advise of some of the others who made this dish and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut a slit in each one for the filling. I had extra mushrooms and spinach which I just put on the bottom of the baking dish and then put the chicken breasts on top of that - it added a lot to the presentation. My guests were delighted with this recipe. Also, I used Boursin cheese instead of Sour Cream and I used the almonds which I felt added a lot to the texture. I don't understand how some people said this was dry because it came out moist and tender - unless they overcooked it. I will make this again!

This is a delicious chicken recipe. I substituted the ground almonds for bread crumbs. Used chicken cutlets, lightly pounded and rolled the filling in the middle. Very easy and great eats.

this dish was a huge success! instead if sour cream, i used creme fraishe. i also used skinless chicken breasts and it worked fine. to keep the stuffing inside the chicken, i rolled it up and used tooth picks to keep it intact. i served this dish with rosemary mashed potatoes, buttered veggies, and a baby green salad. it all went very well together.

This was an excellent dish to prepare. I prepared this meal with skinless chicken breasts and just brushed the garlic butter on top of the chicken breasts. It was absolutely delicious. I'll definitely make this dish again and again.

While not a bad dish, to me it wasn't worth the effort of boning and stuffing. I expected the vast quantity of butter in the recipe to keep the chicken more tender, but it ended up just like the usual hard, baked chicken breast. My guests cleaned their plates, but I'll not bother with this one again.

This was really quick and easy. I varied from the recipe a bit, I used a mixture of white and crimini mushrooms, and added about 2 Tbsp of cream cheese when adding the sour cream. My husband says it was the best chicken dish ever!

I cut the sour cream in half and made up the difference with feta cheese. Awesome! The last few minutes I placed the chicken under the broiler which gave it a nice crispness and color.

Loved it! but changed it a lot too - didn't have any mushrooms. Instead I made some bacon, then sauteed 1/2 a chopped up onion in the same pan. While it was still firm, added spinach and some of the butter mix for a minute. Took all that out to cool, and browned some chopped up pecans in the same pan. When cool, put in the pecans, crumbled bacon, sour cream, into the spinach mix, then dumped all that on 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, with more butter mix dabbed on top. Baked in glass dish for 20 min. covered, 15 uncovered. Excellent! My boyfriend loved it - I loved it. Will definitely make again.

really good, but the filling needs a lot more seasoning, or else it's just too bland. loved the almonds - i actually used slivered almonds and chopped them a bit, and i liked the texture a lot.

My room mate and I made this one night when we needed to use up our spinach. We omitted the nuts because we didn't have any on hand. The chicken we had was skinless and boneless so we slit the breasts open with knife and stuffed the spinach mixture into the breast itself. It took a wee bit longer than I had expected but its very good.

Delicious, but rich, maybe because I used walnuts instead of almonds. Rather than stuffing the chickent I placed the mixture on top and covered the dish while baking except for last 10 minutes and it worked out fine. The family raved. A good dish for company.

Very tasty and fairly easy to make. I like that it can be made ahead. All I had to do for company was to put it in the oven. Like a few others I added a bit of grated fresh parmesaen. I didn't add much so it wasn't noticable. I would add more if I wanted a cheesier taste but I don't think it needs it. I didn't like the "crunch" of the nuts in an otherwise smooth filling but they tasted fine. One note-I used 8 breasts instead of 6 because I wanted to have enough but I didn't increase anything else and it was still fine. Also, it can be difficult to find boneless chicken breast that still has the skin. The butcher at the local grocery store de-boned the breasts for me.

Really good recipe....2.5 forks. Could really do without the almonds. The garlic butter added alot of flavor to the chicken, and the presentation was good. I used skinless breasts and sliced a pocket in the chicken. My family really liked this dish and I'm looking forward to making it again without the almonds.

I altered this recipe in an attempt to make it lower in fat and calories and the results were excellent. I used skinless breasts, fat-free sour cream and replaced the nuts with some grated romano cheese. Instead of covering with butter I topped it with Stonewall Kitchen's Farmhouse Chutney- the sweetness really helped. I just reheated the leftovers at work and I can hear people ask what that great smell is!

We used boneless, skinless chicken and cut a slit for the stuffing. We also thought it sounded too bland adding sour cream to the stuffing, thinking it should be some type of soft, flavorful cheese. We used goat cheese, and it was terrific, but I am sure another type would work, too. A definite make again recipe.

My husband and I thought this made a very tasty dinner. It was very easy to make. The only change I made was using parmesan cheese instead of the almonds as someone else suggested. It was delicious and very moist.

Along with the rest of my family, I thought this recipe was terrific. As some of the other cooks did, I also used cutlets and made a pocket for the stuffing. I don't know why one of the cooks said that her chicken was dry because they came out extremely moist. I covered my chicken while it cooked, so maybe that helped. The almonds, however, didn't seem to add any flavor to this dish so I probably won't use them next time. My husband suggested I substitute fresh parm for the almonds. Sounds good to me!

This was a great recipe. I followed the recipe- I think that adding the dijon adds a tangy kick to each bite. I removed the skin and cut pockets into each breast.

I made this recipe using boneless tenderized breasts and finely crushed almonds. The almonds added consistency. I basted the breasts with the remaining garlic butter and the final result were very tender, juicy and moist breasts.

Well, 2 forks is for a rating of "Like it, don't love it" and that was my reaction. The reviews were so good, and the garlic butter smelled divine, but the overall effect was just ok. "It's fine," my boyfriend said. I'm not desperate to eat it again, as i have been with other recipes i've found online. I think it would be better if the chicken were breaded and then baked with dabs of the butter. I may try it again like that. We decided that it's more of a wintery meal than a summer one.

I made this dish with skinless chicken breasts but it came out a bit too dry. The stuffing was delicious and would be wonderful inside a veal chop or a filet mignon as well. Next time I would either cook the chicken for 20 minutes instead of 30, or create a sauce to go over it to add moisture.

I have made this for two separate dinner parties and everybody has LOVED it. The stuffing keeps the chicken really moist. I find the almonds give the stuffing texture and stop it from becoming runny..(I have made it for myself without the almonds).

I've made this recipe at least 8 times. It's great for company and extremely easy. I use skinless breasts, however, and simply cut pockets into the meat and stuff them that way, instead of stuffing the spinach into the skin as the recipe recommends.
