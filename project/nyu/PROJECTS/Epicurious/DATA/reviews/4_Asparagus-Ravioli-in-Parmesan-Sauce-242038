Loved the ravioli. The broth is a bit bland. Next time I might try different sauce. My one and three year olds gobbled these up!

I wound up making 18 ravioli and also had leftover asparagus filling, but just decided to throw it in the broth. Doing this changed the consistency and appearance a little, but tasted great and meant I didn't have to let anything go to waste. In the future, I'd make a bit less filling and maybe 24 ravioli.

I had a pound of asparagus to use up and found this recipe. I was skeptical about the filling, but after reading a few reviews, decided to give it a try. And boy am I glad I did! The ravioli is absolutely delicious and works perfectly with the savory broth. I made two substitutions: I used pecorino romano instead of parmesan for the filling. And I didn't have homemade broth, so I sauteed leeks, garlic and carrots and simmered them with Trader Joe's organic chicken broth. Highly recommend this recipe.

I've made this soup twice and it was well received both times. I used wonton wrappers instead of fresh pasta and the result was great! I thought the filling needed a little something extra so I added 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts and 2 large basil leaves. As per another review, fried extra "raviolis" until golden and served as appetizers.

This was an excellent recipe. The broth was a nice salty contrast to the sweet asparagus. The flavours were not overpowering, nor was the broth too salty from the parmesan. I added a bit of dried porcini to my ravioli mixture the second time and that gave it a nice earthy flavour - a nice alternative. I'll definitely be making this again. Nice and light.

I made this last night and it was great! I used won ton wrapers and added a couple drops of hot sauce to the filling. Will make again with vegetable broth for my vegetarian friends!!!

Worth the effort - the broth complements the ravioli perfectly. Definitely will be making again.

except that i used won ton wrappers, i did make this as written and we loved it! i wasn't sure we would because it didn't smell particularly appealing as i was mixing the filling, but it was wonderful! i was a little short on stock and had a fair amount of filling left over, so i continued with the wrappers and baked them in the oven for roughly 8 or 10 minutes. those little appetizers were winners too and i'll look forward to having both the soup and the appetizer again soon!

Walnut Creek, why not just ignore the Monterey note?

This was great! I love the pasta dough for the ravioli but could see how wonton or shumai wrappers would save time and work well. The broth was really flavorful. (I used homemade chx stk, and extra parmesan rinds). I will say, however that I had a lot of asparagus filling left over, so I will down size next time. Overall, it was wonderful, fresh, delicate and flavorful all at the same time.

I made this with wonton wrappers instead of homemade pasta, and it still turned out great (and saved loads of time). The parmesan flavor was subtle but a delicious component of the broth. The ravioli filling was what really made this great. Excellent and easy spring dish for when asparagus is abundant in the market.

to a cook from monterey: you substituted fresh garlic chicken ravioli but "followed the rest of the recipe to the letter"? that's like following a recipe for grilled chicken and saying, "i substituted beef! it was great!" i'm all for substitutions, i do it too, and i appreciate people's notes about what works/what doesn't. but when you change a recipe this substantially... i.e. the recipe is for homemade ravioli in a simple broth, and you sub in store-bought... i'm not sure what's really left. at the very least, did you know you can leave comments for a recipe without rating it or voting for whether you'd make it again? you should try that next time.

Gourmet? I think not! Never had we experienced such bland cuisine. We followed this recipe to the letter, and two wasted hours later, were fruitlessly disappointed. The "broth" was beyond bland. The ravioli tasteless. What a sad end to an evening! At least we have dessert to look forward to.

The addition of this recipe was very spur of the moment. I already had planned the menu for a dinner party I was hosting. But I had some extra time so I decided to add this to the menu. I cheated a bit and purchased fresh garlic chicken ravioli. But I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. This was a major hit at the dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. I will be making it again. P.S. This recipe is called "Asparagus Ravioli in Parmesan Broth". There is a typo on epicurious.com
