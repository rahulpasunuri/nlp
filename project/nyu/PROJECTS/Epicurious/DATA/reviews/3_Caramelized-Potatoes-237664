Ohh, and I forgot to say. We usually measure it equal amounts of sugar and butter. That makes the caramel mass softer and yummier. For a pound+ of poatotes I would use 1/4 cup each of sugar and butter.

I was raised in Denmark and always make caramelized potatoes for christmas. It is not really a spring dish though. In DK we always use small white potatoes, I would recommend fingerlings as an option. We also make a little more caramel in the pan. My mom and I always argue over whether we should stirr the caramel as the sugar is melting. She says if you do it causes clumps which is not preferable. I say if you dont you risk it burns and gets bitter. In short - caramelized potatoes are actually not easy to make. Burnt caramel is horrifically bitter, but you dont want hard clumps in the caramel either. You want to let the potatoes sit in the caramel mass for at least 30 mins to really get the potatoes to soak in the wonderful caramel. I often let them sit there for an hour or more on very low heat while I finish up the christmas meal prep. The potatoes have to be precooked to exactly the right amount of hardness. Too hard and they never become tender, too soft and they just fall apart. I usually undercook the potatoes slightly if you compare to how tender you want them when you eat them. So far I havent met anyone who doesnt love it when its done right.

I was excited to try this dish, my friend who is also on this site had her doubts. Well, upon finishing the dish, she was right. It was really bland, boring and tasted like slightly sweet boiled potatos. With some apprehension we decided to hand it over to my husband. He added carmelized onions, more butter, and cream. Then they were awesome!

People you must try these. So simple and tasty. I'm Danish and of course grew up having these at Christmas but they are yummy anytime.

In reading the recipe I had my doubts - but the previous comments were so favorable that I gave it a try. I normally enjoy potatoes - the caramelization did not add anything - they were bland and dissatisfying. Even plain boiled with a little salt and pepper is better.

I want to keep this recipe to myself, and apparently so do others who have tried it but won't review it. It is wonderful. "I want some more."
