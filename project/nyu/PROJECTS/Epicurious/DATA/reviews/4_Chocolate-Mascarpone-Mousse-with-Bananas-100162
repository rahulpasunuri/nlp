Delicious, decadent, and easy! I subbed dark amber agave (all I had) for the corn syrup and it turned out just fine.

Loved the ease of prep and the fact that since there is an egg recall, this has none. It was very dense, so on second day I folded in a little more whipped cream. Used ladyfingers instead of bananas. Really good. And, dont believe the mascarpone container when it says not to freeze. I bought some, didnt use it right away, froze it, and it worked just fine in this recipe.

Does anyone know of any way to make this without corn syrup--any substitutions?

Hit of the party and the best dessert I've ever made. No need to have any other dessert if everyone's a chocolate lover and it does serve 10. Super easy, you can add or switch out fruit. I added rum to the cream for the top. It needs the 4 hours to chill.

I have made this numerous times. It pretty straight forward & easy to do. I have skipped the bananas all together, I have substituted Frangelico for the Rum. I have made it with both bittersweet & milk chocolate. It's always great! Use the base recipe, and then tweak it for your own personal taste.

rich does not even begin to describe this magnificent mousse! omitted the rum, since i was making it for a teetotaler, and chilled the dessert without the bananas. i've also made variations with dark chocolate and matcha (no banana). chocolate and green tea--what a combo!

I followed the recipe and the advice of the person who added the ladyfingers. Upon reflection what you wind up with is a chocolate Charlotte Malakoff with raspberries. The mousse being made with mascarpone cheese. You can substitute the rhum for Grand Marnier adding a little orange zest as a variant. The recipe is easy to make and is bullet proof.

Made the recipe exactly as stated...it tasted good, but was a little dense. On the plus side, it was easy...

I looked high and low for a mousse recipe that did not contain egg yolks. I found a few, but this one is beyond incredible! Thanks!

This was amazing! I've made the mousse twice. Once I made it as the recipe stated. and the other time I made just the mousse without the bananas and used it as a filling for a chocolate tiramisu with fresh raspberries. To die for! All you do is soak lady fingers in coffee and rum and layer them with the mousse and fresh raspberries. Then top with whipped cream.

This was amazingly rich and delicious - I actually couldn't finish my portion, and I am normally a big eater. Next time I will serve smaller amounts of chocolate mousse relative to the amount of bananas and whipped cream to balance out the intense chocolate flavor.

Excellent! It takes less time then the recipe indicates. Your chocolate will melt at a luke warm temp, so you don't have to wait 20 minutes to cool.

Oh my! This was delicious. Not to mention it was incredibly easy and you are able to make it ahead. I used Grand Marnier and mandarin oranges and added some Grand Marnier to the whip cream garnish. I also used really good, dark chocolate.

Don't make this recipe if you are on a diet, it is to die for! My dinner guests included two children under five so I left out the rum, it was amazing...rich, chocolately, not too sweet. Might try it with white chocolate and raspberries next time....

I made this recipe for christmas dinner for a party of 30. It was a BIG HIT!! I did change a few things... I put the Mousse in choc cups and added fresh raspberries instead of the bananas... It was wonderful and pretty easy to make.. Will make it again

This is fantastic! It's not as light as most mousses I've ever had; I thought it was just right. I made mine with white chocolate (same amount as bittersweet) and used light corn syrup instead of dark. Otherwise the same as recipe. My dinner guests loved it! Use really ripe bananas.

This is a keeper. I used a large bowl instead of individual parfaits and garnished with halved strawberries and chocolate shavings. I also increased to about 1/3 cup of rum. Just the right balance of sweetness and perfect for any occasion!

Wonderful and easy to make! Can't go wrong.

Damn good and damn easy to make. Will add more bananas and a touch more rum next time. Hits the spot and then some.

Excellent taste and simple to prepare. I prefer lighter desserts and the mascarpone cheese probably helped to accomplish this. Will definitely make this again and again.

This was absolutely sinful and easy! I've made it twice now, and have not heard one negative comment. I used chambord instead of rum and it gave it a hint of raspberry. I'm making it for my upcoming Christmas party!

I made this for a dinner party, and my friends thought it was fantastic. I forgot to bring the mascarpone, so I substituted a mixture of 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup cream, and 1/2 cup sour cream (only use one cup of this mixture, not the whole batch). I also substituted Napoleon brandy for the rum, and I added brandy and a little sugar to the whipped cream. The result was absolutely delicious, and not overwhelmingly sweet. Easy, too!

Mm,mm, good! Very rich, sinful, and a must to impress your family and guests. I added a smaller amount of dark rum at first in response to an earlier reviewer's comment but found that I had to put in the full amount. I can see altering the recipe to suit your mood using Grand Marnier, Framboise, or any other chocolate-compatible liqueur. I would really recommend this as a trouble free dinner party recipe, as it makes a good 10 servings and has great presentation.

This was a rich, relatively easy mousse recipe. The rum flavor was stronger than I like, so next time I'll probably put less or substitute cognac or grand marnier. Our guests liked it.

This is very good but very rich. I always waited to put the bananas on immediately before serving.
