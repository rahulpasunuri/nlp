This was a great recipe and very simple with some appropriate modifications. I added andouille sausage, 1 jalapeno, some diced celery, 1 green pepper, and traded black beans for red beans. The jalapeno and the cayenne added just the right amount of kick. Tastes better the day after.'

This is so good, have been making it for a while my husband from NO loves it as does my picky LA sister. I add 3 bay leaves when simmering, use red beans, 1/2 beer/broth, steam my rice with a few sprigs of time and use whatever sausage I have on hand. Usually left over italian turkey or brats from grill night. Always fab, easy and makes yummy left overs for lunch. I use the weber's cajun which is the best imo.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is really good!! Easy to make, the only thing that I add is a small bell pepper to the mix. Excellent over brown rice.

A few weeks ago I tried this recipe, (actually have never made Red Beans & Rice before), and thought it was delicious, easy to make and the family loved it. I looked for a recipe that had some of the ingriedients I had on hand, then added the chicken broth and onion (which prompted my search as I was not sure what I was missing).

Tried this tonight and very disappointed! I will not use canned kidney beans again - S&W adds sugar to thier bean. Yuck! I added extra garlic, cayenne, 2 bay leaves, a touch of oregano, and used turkey saugage, as I do not eat mammals - very disappointing. I will use dried red beans if I bother to try again. Maybe black eyed peas, as they are magic with their natural smokiness - love them with smoked turkey wings and legs in my mammal friendly version of "Ham hocks and beans.

I added celery and red and green pepper to the onion garlic mix and used andouille smoked sausage. 2 cans of kidneybeans and sauce (goya) 2 cans ro*tel 1 cup beer 2 tsp Tony Chachers Creole seasoning. Nice flavor and heat its cooking down now can't wait!

I made this as written but with no sausage and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I expected it to be a little bland but it was fabulous. The caramelized onions have such a nice flavor, and with sausage and beer I bet it's even more amazing. It's so easy and delicious I will definitely make it again and again.

The market had Butterball Turkey Sausage on a two for one sale. I bought one Kielbasa which I haven't cooked in years. When searching for recipes this one came up. Wow -- it's great and easy. I had no cajun spices so used only cayenne. May husband loved it and found it plenty spicy. Now that I've read the reviews I'll try the beer,bay leaf and tomatoes next time. I'm sure the leftovers will be even better.

I don't have a dutch oven, so I threw the ingredients in a crock pot on low for 7 hours and then let it rest for the rest of the day. Went with the beer and bay leaf mods (half cup beer + half cup chicken broth, 3 bay leaves). It needs more Tobasco.

Too many substitutions needed to make this work. I made largely as written, and it was a dreary mess.

This receipe was great I did do the recommendations of Dark ale, Bay Leaf Tomatoes. So cut back to two cans of beans. I added the rice to the entire pot .

Made this for a Mardi Gras party and everyone loved it, adults and toddlers alike. Here are the changes I made: used dried red beans (Goya), which had a much better texture than kidney beans (also had to cook it longer, which blended favors well), used andouille sausage, used half stock/half Sierra Nevada (added more as I cooked beans), added 3 bay leaves. My husband is from Louisiana and pronounced in delicious too. Spicy, even with the 1 teaspoon of Tony's Cajun Seasoning.

I made this recipe with turkey smoked sausage, Goya kidney beans, and substituted half of the chicken broth with Shiner Bock. It was delicious and ridiculously easy! I agree that garlic bread goes really well with it. Next time I am going to try adding bay leaves. Delicious!

wow. I was skeptical, but this was great, and unbelievably easy. I reduced the sausage and beans (oh, and used proper red beans instead of kidney) by 2/3, but used a small onion and left the garlic the same. followed the reviews and used half beer and half broth. we will eat this all the time.

Very yummy! Have missed red beans & rice since moving to Central Florida. I've made several time, using the majority of the prior comments: Omit broth; add 1 can undrained toms; use increased amount of andouille sausage; 3 bay leaves (a MUST); Goya or Blue Runner red beans OR dried red beans (even better); increase cajun/creole seasoning to taste; add a half bottle of darker beer (Newcastle, Negro Modelo, Guinness are good). Serve with hot peel-and-eat shrimp cooked with white wine and Old Bay. Crusty rolls or flat bread with butter. Heaven!

Rating: 4
Really yummy. I had some veggies around so I added some celery, red pepper and jalapeno. i also added some beer and bay leaves (as per suggestions before). Also, I didn't have any creole or cajun seasoning, so I used a little emeril's original essence and some cayenne pepper. I also added some hot sauce and served it over brown rice. It was great!

Rating: 4
This recipe is a great, quick way to make some tasty red beans. My family is from Louisiana; I was craving red beans one night when I realized I'd never gotten my mom's recipe. I found this one and have been making it ever since. I never have time to soak dried beans and all of that! I throw it over brown rice and dinner is done.

This is really good for such a simple recipe. I made it with turkey Kielbasa and it was great.

Simply lovely. I highly recommend vidalia onions, andouille sausage, Emerils Bayou Blast Seasoning, and a dark beer, like Shiner Bock or Guinness Stout. A great meal fit for a king.

Rating: 4
Per the advice of prior reviewers, I used half beer/half stock, 2 tsp of Cajun seasoning (Emeril's Essence), and 3 bay leaves. I thought the flavor was fantastic, but a touch too salty for my taste. Next time I'll use low sodium beans as well as low sodium stock. Otherwise, this is my new favorite beans and rice dish.

Rating: 4
I took SpocksBrain's advice and used half beer/half stock. The recipe turned out great! It smelled pretty strongly of beer while it was cooking but it really mellowed out. I used turkey kielbasa and brown rice for a great low fat/high fiber dish. I will definitely be making this one again.

Easy, fairly quick, freezes well. Tastes authentic, at least according to my two friends from Lafayette, LA. I use half chicken stock and half hoppy beer. A little extra cajun seasoning, and a gratuitous dash or two of cayenne to top it off. And three bay leaves. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Solid performer. I recommend using beer in place of stock. If you want to use this a main dish, increase the sausage to bean ratio.

really good and simple. i used pink beans instead as i had them on hand. threw in a california chili pod which added great flavor. also added red and green peppers. yum!

Rating: 4
Very easy and delicious! I stirred in the cooked rice into the beans mixture when it still had some liquid in it (it had already simmered 40 minutes at that point), and let the rice soak up the juice and thicken it quicker. Doing that gave the rice the wonderful flavors of the dish.

Used skinless sausage & brown rice. 2 cans of beans work fine. Added a couple bay leaves. Used the low sodium broth, but it was still really salty. Serve with LA sauce & lemon.

I threw in about twice as much Cayenne, and it really spiced it up. Great in hot weather because it gets you sweating! Also keeps well in the fridge if you're cooking for a smaller number of people and want to eat for a week...

I made this, the first time, with a couple suggested modifications, and I haven't gone back! So if you want to try something new with this one, this is what I suggest: add bay leaves use bola roja beans instead of red beans The bola roja (made by Goya) really meatens up the dish. I got them quite by accident the first time and now my husband and I are addicted to them! Seriously, this is absolutely a delicious, meaty dish. But don't add any salt! Between the beans, the keilbasa, and the creole seasoning, it's spicy enough, I think. Enjoy!

Made this and 2 other recipes from this site for our Mardi Gras event this past weekend. This was the best of the 3. I made my own beans (tripled the recipe) and cooked them all day. Fantastic!!

Wonderful and easy. I used Ham instead of the sausage and used dried beans instead of the canned. What a simple dinner that smelled great while cooking. I added very little hot spice while it was cooking because of my son, but my husband and I added it at the table. I also used some Old Bay seasoning, just perfect.

I lost this recipe 3 years ago. I am delighted to find it again in Epicurious. It's great just as it is. I'm sure the additions made by others are interesting, but the "original" can stand by itself. It's quick and easy comfort food that can be made in 40 minutes after a busy day at work.

As did many before me, I substituted stewed tomatoes and juice for the broth. What a winner! The smell of this dish cooking had everyone panting for dinner and even my picky eaters had seconds (or thirds!) I used hot Italian sausage and Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning. The dish had some heat, but wasn't overwhelming. This has rapidly become a favorite around here.

I used Andoille-style chicken sausage from Trader Joes which worked really well. My hubby complained that it was a little too hot even though I used very little cayenne. Good stuff!

Rating: 3
This was really easy and tasty! I did add a can of diced Italian tomatoes as others suggested. Also, I used a mix of 7 brown rices (you can buy packages of the mix) and it gave it a nice texture - some of the rice kind of 'pops' when you bite into it. This will become a staple - even a nice dish without the sausage.

Rating: 3
This was an easy and really tasty recipe. I also substituted one of the cans of beans with chopped tomatoes + juice. I also used a mixture of onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and cayenne in place of the creole seasoning (figured it was about the same thing). I did have to cook with the top off to get it to the consistency I wanted it. Yum.

My entire family loves this dish, but it is important to ease off on the spices if you have small children who can't handle the heat. Or you can simply increase the ratio of rice you serve it with. For heat-lovers use hot links or Andouille sausage.

Rating: 3
This is a hearty staple that even our kids love! Definitely back off on the spices if you have little children because the garlic elevates the overall heat in the dish. Put it together with garlic bread for a simple dinner that will fill everyone up!

I would not make this recipe again. I made it on Mardi Gras and was disappointed. It was a bunch of hot spice (which I like) but seemed to be missing on simple stuff like salt. It was bland in that area. I made it with the rice as suggested. Thank goodness the hurricanes we made with the meal were awesome so the night wasn't spoiled!

Thanks to all below who gave great suggestions to add to this recipe. A few bay leaves and a seasoned can of tomatos instead of boullion made for a wonderfully authentic dish (and aroma in the kitchen!) I gave it 4 forks, not so much because it was to-die-for, but because it tasted great and you can feed at least four people for under $10. On my second try, I added medium shrimp half way through simmering - excellent! (I apologize if adding shrimp is an insult to any canjun purists out there....)

We just tried this dish last night and it was OUTSTANDING!! I followed previously mention tips and omitted the broth, added in a can of Italian stewed tomatoes (drained one of the cans of beans to compensate for liquid - the consistency was perfect!) And, since we like it a little hotter I used the Cajun spice, a 1/2 tsp. of cumin and some cayenne pepper (3-4 strong dashes). I also added 3 bay leaves. This was so good I will definitely make a double batch next time so we can have more leftovers!

MMM MMM Good. I Followed a lot of the suggestions mantioned. Added tomatoes and celery. I think next time I will cook the Red Beans instead of using canned, but that takes much longer obviously.

Added a half bottle of beer to give a little "soul" to this timeless favorite. This time I chose an Ipswich I.P.A, but bet a Guinness would be great, too! The addition of a 14 oz. can of chunky tomatoes and 2 bay leaves provided greater dimension to the flavor of this mixture.

Having lived in New Orleans, this isn't involved creole cooking, but an easy version someone's mom might make. Definitely needs more red beans, tho. And I couldn't use all that juice... And..how could they forget? It NEEDS 2-3 bay leaves. How can you have red beans without bay leaves?! Lordy, lordy! Also, if you want to make it more authentic for N'awlins...Monday is always red beans & rice day. ALWAYS.

This was much better the next day for some reason. I drained all of the fat after cooking the sausage mixture - and there was a lot of it (used kielbasa). It would have been very greasy if I hadn't taken it out. I, too, used a mixture of white beans and red beans and plenty of McCormick cajun seasoning. Not for the sensitive stomach!

I have made this dish before, but this time I substituted cannelini (white beans) for one of the cans of kidney beans. Also, I used both the Cajun seasoning and the cayenne pepper. It was wonderful and easy!

This was a good, hearty meal. I added a box of frozen spinach at the end--it gave the dish more color and more flavor--and really worked well. Consider halfing the recipe if you are only cooking for 2-otherwise you will have a lot of leftovers (but you can freeze those, too.) Also, I served it over basmati rice.

I used this recipe and reviewed it back in January. This time I used some of the suggestions from others plus some changes of my own and it was much better. Since there are only three of us, I halved the recipe. Then I made the following changes. I used three links of Aidell's Turkey & Chicken Artichoke with Roasted Garlic and one link of Aidell's Turkey & Chicken Habanero & Green Chili Sausage. I did not use the liquid from the kidney beans. I used the Cajun seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of Tabasco Sauce. I added one 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatos, including liquid and one 13 3/4 oz can of quartered artichoke hearts, each one halved again. Came out great!

I've made this dish several times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and after that I made a few modifications. My family insists that the second way is the best way, and begs me to make this every week! I replaced the cup of chicken broth with a can of Cajun seasoned stewed tomatoes and a teaspoon of chicken buillon crystals. And added a bay leaf to the mixture as it cooks. Since I'm using pre-seasoned tomatoes, I cut back a bit on the extra cajun spices. This recipe is simple enough for my kids to make for dinner.

As a Cajun in Cajun country, this is a staple in our home. To those that would decrease the liquid, I suggest that you allow it to simmer a little longer for the beans to break down and make a creamier gravy. This is also GREAT with a slightly sweet cornbread (some would say in addition to rice, but also instead of rice).

My fiancé & I are trying to really cut our food budget; describing myself as what I believe to be a gourmet, yuppie cook this is no easy task.

As a native of Lafayette, La. and currently living in Mandeville, La. right outside of New Orleans, I will admit that this is good for a quick dish of Red Beans. Normally I would use dried beans and andouille and cook it all day. I always add green onions to my onions, bells, and garlic, and also garnish will g.o. and parsley. Thyme is a great herb in the beans also!

This is very good stuff. I agree with one of the other reviewers that this can be too salty; use the low-salt chicken broth, if you can. Since you don't drain and rinse the canned beans, there's that extra salt, too, to consider. I can see that playing around with this recipe would be adventurous and worthwhile, even though it's great as is. This is a keeper for me.

I made this recipe for my husband and I for dinner. He didn't care for it as he's a basic meat-n-potatoes guy. However, I am happily eating leftovers for the third day in a row. The flavor seems to be getting better. I can imagine leftover chicken or turkey would be good in it as well. Cooking tip: I simmered it uncovered for the last 20 min. to thicken it up. For low salt diets, I'd recommend cayenne pepper and a dash of salt over the cajun spices which are VERY salty.

For such an easy recipe, this is really very good. I aslo use both Creole seasoning & cayenne, then add Tabascoo at the table. Some mashing of the beans with a fork contributes to the texture IMO.
