I made this dish for a cocktail party. I made sure that I followed the recipe exactly as instructed. After I finished, I tasted it and it was delicious! I put the mixture in the fridge for approx. 5 hours (the recipe said that it could be stored for up to 8 hours). After I assembled them on the egg roll wrapper I tasted it and gagged! It went bad!! I had to throw everything out and scramble to pull something together for the party. All that hard work and money down the drain. If you are going to make this, serve it right away.

This was a great dish! I made this for a party for 25, and it was the first appetizer to disappear. We loved it so much that we made it 2 nights later for my folks who were coming for dinner. I also did not use the enoki, just couldn't find it when I wanted it. I was pressed for time trying to put together hors d'oeurvres for 25.

This is an extremely easy recipe to make. I used a mixture of mushrooms such as portobello, white, oyster etc. but left out the enoki mushrooms as they are a little more expensive and the crowd that I was cooking for is not that sophisticated to realize that the enoki mushrooms were missing. I also used my home made salad dressing instead of store bought but I am sure that even with the store bought dressing this recipe would be hit!

This is a great appetizer. I've made it twice and everyone loves it. I couldn't get all the types of mushrooms called for. I used all shiitake mushrooms and it still tasted great. Instead of fat free dressing, I used regular. This is a great make ahead appetizer and easy to put together.
