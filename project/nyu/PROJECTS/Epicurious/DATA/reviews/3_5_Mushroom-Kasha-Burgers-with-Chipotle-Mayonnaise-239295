So, I have made these a bunch of times, and I love them. However, I am only just now noticing that I haven't fully been following the recipe. For one, I don't use portabellos, because I feel like you're mostly paying for the size, and here they're getting minced anyway. So I use criminis, and I just get the 8 oz container, not a pound. (Of course, if you're buying a pound of portobellos and then removing the stems, that would bring the weight down, so maybe my result isn't actually half the called-for amount?) Many of the negative reviews here are because this dirtied too many dishes or took too long. That's just a personal preference, of course, but those gripes never even complained to me. I actually came in thinking this recipe was really simple. So I guess if this recipe sounds annoying to you based on what things tend to be annoying to you, that can't be helped. But I think these burgers are really delicious.

Meh. Good enough that I enjoyed dinner. Not so good that the left overs got eaten or that I'll make it again. One thing I did like about this is that it wasn't too heavy like many of the black bean based veggie burgers. Still searching for the perfect veggie burger recipe.

I thought this was very nice, but I agree with some other reviewers that it was too much work for the result. So many dirty dishes and so much chopping! I do like the idea of finely chopping and cooking the mushrooms, as I think that solves a textural problem that I always have with grilled portobello sandwiches/burgers. But it's not worth the work, unless you are crazy for mushroom flavor, or have a nut allergy. If not, just do the bulgur veggie burgers with lime mayo on this site. Equally tasty, if not more so, and much, much easier.

I guess we're the voice of dissent, but these "burgers" turned out tasteless and nasty! We had to choke them down.(Incidentally, we usually like vegetarian/vegan food.) A waste of beautiful ingredients and time. Never again. You'd do better by grilling the mushrooms, slapping them on a bun and adding chipotle mayo or pesto.

while i do say this gourmet veggie burger is delicious, it took way too long and made way to big a mess to be worth it. note that you can cut down the prep time by using the freezer.

We totally screwed up this recipe but it was still excellent. We accidentally only put in 1/2 the mushrooms. We skipped the chilling part. We used twice as much egg. we put all the bread crumbs in at the same time. Disaster? Nope. Delicious? Yip.

I was suprised how tasty the burgers came out. my second-time around, i added some carrots and zuchinni to bell peppers, and i thought the addition was good. it's an excellent recipie if you're making meat and have vegetarian guests - but even my meat-loving family LOVED this one. Will definitely become a staple in our menu

This made yummy burgers to serve with homemade bread. I added an extra egg as others suggested.

Having made these again recently, I thought I'd add another review. I wanted to make these for hors d'oeuvres so to form the mixture into patties I used a cookie scoop. I think it think it was a 1.5 or 2 tbsp sized one. I got a total of 22 alider-sized patties out of this recipe. I was very liberal with the breadcrumbs for coating and I'm almost certain I used more than was called for. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe. Perhaps because the patties were small, I sis not have trouble with them falling apart. I used a spatula and a spoon to guide them when turning over. I only had baguette on hand, so I served the patties with chipotle tabasco-mayo smear baguette slices. They went over really well. I'll definitely be making these again, perhaps with rye bread next time.

This is a great recipe. We have made it a number of times. If you use rice breadcrumbs, this is a fabulous glutenfree dish!

This was delicious--extra-serving-worthy--the first day, but kind of disappointing the next day. (I had refrigerated the mixture and cooked more the next day). I added an egg to help the mixture hold together. The chipotle mayo was delicious. I used to process actual chipotles with mayo, but using this Tabasco was much easier and had a nice extra bite so from now on I'll be doing that.

I added an extra egg yolk to try to keep it frm falling apart, but thought the consistency left something to be desired. The taste was great though! This recipe made 6 patties though, and with the extra yolk it stayed together well enough to put on a roll, but tricky to flip in the pan!

These are delicious, but I served them with a ratatouille instead of on bread. Hearty and satisfying.

We found these to be a very tasty meatless burger. Even my meat loving husband said we should make them again but I agree they are a little crumbly to eat on bread. I think I might try to make them into meatballs next time.

Really tasty, but they fall apart (Hard to eat between bread slices. Use a pita pocket or they're super with no bread at all.) For me, this recipe made 7 fat, 3.5 inch patties. The mushrooms took closer to 15 mins. to cook off the liquid. I also used italian breadcrumbs, 2x the soy, and I threw them in the freezer for 25 mins. instead of an hour in the fridge. A mess in the kitchen before and after dinner, but I will definitely make many more!

This is a lengthy recipe but worth it in the end.My meat eating husband put it on our make it again list
