Agree with another reviewer that the recipe is far too complicated. I made it the following the recipe except I used only whole milk. When when I added the lime sugar syrup to the hot milk/sugar/lime peel there was minor curdling of the milk that I strained out when done. Also, I added the extra 1/4 cup lime juice per recipe when the custard had cooled. The Ice cream was good. I repeated the entire recipe for a second batch except I mixed all ingredients in the milk and scalded. I tempered the egg yolks and added those slowly as I whisked the hot milk mixture and this time there was no curdling. I added a little green food color to pretty up the ice cream and the result was really delicious. I feel my method is faster and it tasted slightly better. My wife prepared confectioner sugar coated lime cookies and with them we made lime ice cream sandwiches. That combo rates 4 forks.

Fantastic ice cream. I didn't add the final 1/4 cup of lime juice because I liked the taste of the custard without it. Only bad part is that it's so good it'll be gone too quickly.

Excellent! I simplified it even more than others suggested, but it seems to have worked--I just mixed everything, heated to 170, and chilled. I served it with Blackberry Sorbet (also from this site) and it was a big hit with my guests.

This was a wonderful recipe but I think the directions are unnecessarily time consuming. To simplify, I mixed the sugar, zest, yolks, then whisked in the cream and milk. Then slowly heat to 170 degrees, whisk in the juice, strain, and chill. It worked beautifully and still produced a great lime flavor.

I love this recipe. I added the ice cream to some lemon-lime soda to make a float and it was outstanding.

This recipe has now become my favorite summer time desert. It is a perfect creamy/tangy combination. I usually serve on top of a lemon shortbread cookie.

I found this recipe to be very creamy and delicious. Also, I guess my expectations are different - this is the first time i have made ice cream and didn't find the recipe too complicated at all. It has a very strong key lime flavor which I enjoy. I will take SLC's (thanks for the recipe!)advice and serve this with the candied lime to add a little more sweetness.

Too tart and not creamy enough. Also to complicated for a simple ice cream.

I thought this recipe was great! And following the cook from Atlanta's suggestion, I served it with candied lime. But rather than sell it to you (cheesy) - here is the recipe (for free) : CANDIED LIME PEEL, 2 limes, 1/2 C. sugar, 1 1/2 C. water. Squeeze juice from limes and save in refrigerator for later use. Slice lime peels thinly. In a heavy saucepan on high heat, boil sugar and water for 3 minutes. Add lime peels. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour, or until skin is softened. Cool on a wire rack set over a cookie sheet. Dry on the rack for 12 hours. Refrigerate in a covered container.

Everyone loved this recipe and were quite impressed with the presentation. The meringue was wonderful as were the blackberries. Perfect combination.

This was good once I got it figured out. Was a tad difficult to make, but tasty. I even fed some to my dog and she loved it too - and she is a fussy eater. I actually served candied lime with mine which I made myself and will sell to you if you e-mail me.

I always love making ice cream and this was delicious! I didn't use the lime zest though and it still turned out wonderfull. I'm more of a Sherbert lover (as I'm trying to watch my waistline) but this was really good. will definately make it again!
