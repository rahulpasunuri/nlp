I made this using chorizo sausage meat and quail eggs but kept everything else the same. It was delicious. All my guests loved it.

I have made this recipe three different times, playing around with the amounts and herbs and I love the way it turns out. I've found that I need to use slightly less than 1/3 cup of sausage around each egg, the flour is almost unneccessary, and that the temperature of the oil needs to be slightly higher than listed here so that you can flash fry them quickly to avoid the pulling of the sausage. The flavor is amazing, my inlaws love them!

Excellent! Made them for a party and they were a hit. I had my oil a little warmer, and I found they were done right at 6min.

I made these and baked them, as one other reviewer said they had, and it was not worth it. They came out dry and not browned,and it took 30 min in the oven before they were done. I used Bob Evans sausage, which we like and have used many times. The low rating is a little unfair since I didn't cook them as directed. These would be much better fried (isn't almost everything?)

Oh sweet mercy. I made these for Father's Day and they are incredible!! I've had them once before and these were so much better. I doubled the recipe but only got 7 eggs made: I was a little shy of 2 lbs of bulk sausage, and it was fairly coarsely ground, which made it harder to get as thin as I should have. I ended up having to put a batch back in, as they sausage closest to the egg was a little uncooked--next time I'll use a more finely ground sausage and really try to keep it closer to 1/3 cup. Insanely good. Used GF bread crumbs and still quite spectacular. I agree w/prev reviewers--I used well under 2 cups of bread crumbs, and a half-cup of flour was fine (and arguably not needed anyway). I also had to add a beaten egg to my sausage, as it wasn't sticking together well, but again, I think this was because it was a "house-made" sausage that was coarsely ground.

forgot to mention that i only needed about 1/2 cup of flour and I used 1 cup seasoned Panko bread crumbs. Not sure why the recipe call for 5 cups of bread crumbs.

We loved the scotch eggs. I didn't have sausage, so used ground round. Also, we were out of fresh herbs so used dried and still turned out delicious. Used Panko bread crumbs and pan fried. Can't wait to make them according to the recipe. What a fun new recipe!

These have become a family favorite. Messy to make but SO worth it. I use turkey sausage and whatever fresh herbs we have in the garden or find in the store. (I love changing the herbs for fun.) I use Mestemacher Three Grain Bread with whole rye kernels so the breading is coarse and thick and fries up crispy brown. One egg is a complete meal. Wonderful recipe!

These are excellent straight out of the fridge. They make a great snack - yes 'pub food' too.

MMMM-MMMM cheap and delicous! I made it exactly as written.

I made these twice as an appetizer using quail eggs so each is about two bites. Everyone wanted the recipe. Really good but I think I'll try them with hot italian sausage next time.

We made these with our leftover dyed Easter eggs and they were a huge success. Very easy to make, followed the recipe as wriiten (except we added a little extra sage and black pepper to the sausage mixture and omitted the mustard). The only problem was that the sausage was a little under-cooked on the first we tested. We had to cut them in half and drop them back in the oil for a few more minutes. The whole family loved them, served with a big spinach salad for a lite Easter supper.

I know there a few comments from people who haven't even bothered to try the recipe but seem to have something to say, negative, about it...well pay NO attention. I will admit it was a bit of a new concept for me, I had never heard of these before, but let me tell you - YUM. I dont use recipes for measurements, but more for the "general idea". I had no problem with sausage falling off or anything. They came out perfect and oh-so-tasty! Thanks for another wonderful recipe.

I had to adapt the recipe using turkey sausage, because we ended up eating LOTS of these! Had to cut the fat and calories somehow. I work for a busy computer shop, and these are PERFECT for lunch or snacking when you can't sit and you need a hand free to work and eat at the same time. And yes, we're neat about it. Another modification I've made is to combine a bunch of cilantro and / or curly parsley with the chives and sausage for extra flavor.

This is a great recipe..but instead of deep frying the Scotch Eggs, I bake them in the oven on a rack. they turn out great this way!

This recipe is very similar to how my mom made Scotch Eggs for me when I was little - a rare breakfest treat! I looked the recipe up to remember at what temperature to fry them. Our family uses Jimmy Dean sausage so the extra herbs are not really needed. Instead dried herbs are added to the bread crumbs. Truly delicious!

Perfect with a cocktail ... or on a picnic ... or watching the game with a beer.

Truly delicious, but doesn't fit breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

kashmira - you could try a product called Boca Burger or Boca Ground Beef. It is a soy-meat substitute. Can not guarantee that soy-meat will stay together when put around the egg. Something to try.

I also found that 1/2 cup of flour and 1 cup of breadcrumbs was more than enough.

I changed a lot in this recipe including using ground beef, regular mustard and pan frying. This is the 1st time making it and was very pleased with the results.

Really like this recipe, but question 5, count'em FIVE cups of bread crumbs to 1 lb of sausage! Should think 2 would be sufficient.

We love these at the pub but we thought that these were even better than what we get there. Quite easy to make - we used panko for the breadcrumbs and they turned out quite well.

served these at beakfast prior to Burns night. They are a bit of a production but are very good. My kids love them as well.

No disrespect to Scotland intended, but this seems like a ridiculous waste of time and engery. I like HB eggs, sausage, herbs and breading as much as the next guy, but I don't have to have them all smooshed together into a ball.

For the cook who had 2 eggs burst: most likely there were air bubbles between the eggs and the sausage. I have had this happen as well. When you are wrapping the eggs, make sure the sausage is flattened just enough to cover the eggs, not much bigger. Also, once the egg is covered, "smoosh" the whole thing all around (kind of how pitchers hold a baseball before they pitch it).

Classic scotch eggs - a childhood favorite! I can't wait to tell my mother I made these. This is an excellent, easy recipe with perfect proportions given for meat and eggs. We served yesterday with mustard, as suggested, and a yogurt curry sauce as an alternative. Just had one for lunch and they are even better the second day.

I was sure I had covered the eggs completely with the sausage but after frying, 2 eggs came out without a complete sausage covering. Can anyone explain why the sausage seemed to have "shrunk" on those 2 eggs?

Soy-sage would be a meat substitute...

Hmmm...this recipe sounds very interesting, but I don't eat meat. What can I use instead of the sausage? any suggestions?

Made these for Easter as an appetizer and even people who don't like boiled eggs loved them! The herbs are a great addition.

Have not tried this specific recipe, but it sounds great. I've tasted Scotch eggs in an English pub and have made them myself. Love them! Will definitely be trying this recipe soon.

I love this recipe! They're fun to make (even if it is a little sloppy until you get the hang of it). My husband said these were better than the Scotch eggs he had in Scotland!
