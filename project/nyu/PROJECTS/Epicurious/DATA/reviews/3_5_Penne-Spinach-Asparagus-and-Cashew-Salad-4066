I'm not doing a fork rating because I used it as the basis of pasta salad that included lightly grilled sliced chicken for a light dinner entree. I added more lemon and added a little sliced pepperoncini for a little kick. The cashews are a great idea so as a base for other things, it's good.

I've made the original recipe and it's very good. Then I kicked it up a notch and made it a bit more Asian by substituting Sesame Oil for the Olive Oil. I've also used shallots instead of green onions, added a garlic clove, used toasted pine nuts instead of cashews, even swapped fresh tortellini for the penne -- as you can see, it's versatile. And, it's always a fave at parties.

Made this again this time with the Mixed Antipasto marinade on this site.

I made this once as written and found it way too oily. The second time I made the following changes: (1) used 1/3 of the oil (2) added 1/3 cup of grainy dijon mustard (3) used shallots instead of green onions (4) a nice squeezed of fresh lemon and a squirt of honey and little minced garlic clove. Also, I blanched the asparagus for only 30 seconds, mixed with pasta and dressing and a couple tablespoons of mandarin oranges. I let the flavors merry for a few hours.

Sorry to respond so late (8/13/06) but this recipe is anything but bland. I've made this salad since the issue came out and get demands for it at gatherings, still. I don't deviate one bit from the original and it's always a crowd pleaser.

I made this today and like other reviews, found it bland. I added high quality blue cheese, used the red wine vinegar lemon etc. dressing in the blender like another reviewer suggested and it was still blah. Added some smoked sun dried tomatoes (always rescues my pasta dishes in distress) and crumbled bacon and STILL bland. The pasta & asparagus sat overnight in the dressing so I can't think of anything I did wrong. Don't bother with this one UNLESS you serve it warm- maybe that will intensify the flavors. As a cold dish, buy store-bought potato salad in the cardboard box before you take this to a picnic!

After reading some of the comments about how bland this was, I changed up the dressing a bit. I added feta cheese, and for the dressing I made it the following way: 3 T Red Wine Vinegar 12 T Extra Virgin Olive Oil 1/2 t salt 1/4 t pepper 2 T Fresh chopped Thyme 2 large garlic cloves pressed 3/4 cup chopped green onions Juiced squeezed from one lemon I put all ingredients into a blender and voila! An awesome dressing that tasted fabulous with the rest of the salad. I also put the dressing over the pasta and asparagus for 24 hours before serving and added the spinach, cashews (which I toasted more, and feta and tossed before serving. Got raves on the salad.

Liked it, but didn't love it. Followed reviewers recommendations and added blue cheese crumbles (which helped a lot), 1/2 the oil, 1/2 the spinach, and doubled the dressing, but it was still a little bland. Searching for a better dressing and I think it could be much improved. I also think it tastes better served warm which allows the blue cheese to permeate. I refrigerated overnight.

For people concerned about the lack of flavor - I concur. Here is the way to remedy it. Add to the dressing: tsp sesame oil tsp ginger tbl smashed garlic tsp sri racha chili 1/2 cup of white wine rosemary and chives if available To salad: chopped basil crumbled gorgonzola And take the chopped onions out of the blender and toss into the salad. Mix and match with the other techniques suggested in the reviews and this turns out to be a powerful salad, enjoy with others.

Was introduced to this dish at a family reunion. Turned me onto epicurious.com, and have repeated this recipe for several gatherings. I add fresh basil which makes all the difference! Several people have asked me for the recipe, and they all get rave reviews too! Goes really well with Dijon BBQ chicken.

I was looking for a pasta salad that wasn't drenched in mayo and easy to prepare in advance for a luncheon with my co-workers. It was both of those things but lacked "WOW". People asked for every recipe except this one. I will delete it from my recipe box.

Rating: 1
I wasn't sure whether or not to rate this recipe because I did make a substitution....used rice vinegar as I didn't have white wine vinegar. Probably didn't make that much of a difference but I thought the salad lacked "oomph". Had to add sesame oil to oomph it up a notch but it's still not a keeper as there are so many better recipes out there.....and it kills me that I will never be able to make them all even if I live to be 100!

Interesting combination of flavors. Needs the cashews. Yum yum. A keeper.

Rating: 1
In my opinion, this is NOT a keeper in any way. The components seemed disjointed and there was not enough dressing to adquately top the whole conglomeration. Even if I had doubled the dressing, I wouldn't have liked the salad because I didn't care for its taste. Apparently neither did any of my guests since this was one of the few dishes that was barely touched at the end of our holiday brunch.

Just what I was looking for to match what I wanted to use for dinner tonight! Easy and tasty. I roasted the asparagus instead of boiled it (we prefer it roasted), and since I was making it for two, I just eyeballed the amounts for the dressing. What was listed in the recipe seemed like an awful lot of oil, but it was simple to reduce for our needs (also for making it lower in fat).

Made this for a recent cook-out. There was a little left over so I thought I would be having a great lunch next day. No such luck! My sister-in-law spotted it and took it home with her!! I took the advice from another reviewer and made extra dressing. I love this salad.

Great recipe - nice and easy and great picnic food due to the lack of mayo. I roasted my asparagus and only used one pound of penne - I like the balance of veggies to pasta better. Made the dressing a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge and it mellowed very nicely. Much nicer tasting than when first made. A definite keeper!

I served this at a dinner party and got rave reviews. One small change would be to either make less pasta or more dressing. This salad is a great base for creative additions such as grilled chicken, roasted red bell pepper, etc...

Delicious and light. I agree with San Franciso cook about the dressing--next time I will make more dressing or use less pasta.

This is a very good salad. I think it could use a little more dressing than is called for. I also added cherry tomatoes, sugar snap peas, and some smoked trout, and it's just fabulous. The flavors all work well together.

I loved this. It is so easy to make. The dressing is good with a simple spinach salad as well. If asparagus isn't in season you can substitute peas, green beans or cherry tomatoes. Also, I use 3 tablespoons of soy sauce instead of 2, just adds a bit of extra flavor. I have made it several times and each time someone asks for the recipe.

The recipe isn't that exciting but I added grilled chicken that I rubbed with Chinese Five Spice before grilling and what a big difference. Took the salad from okay to yum-yum.

I've added cooked chicken and fresly grated parmesan cheese, making it a wonderful summer meal. I've also added grape tomatoes, or left out the asparagus and used sweet peas. My family really enjoys the combination of pasta and spinach. Grilled salmon instead of the chicken would be wonderful....

I made this for a summer cookout. It was very popular! Several people wanted the recipe. I couldn't find white wine vinegar so just added vinegar. It is a good recipe to take to pot lucks or cookouts.The cashews add a nice flavor.

Great pasta salad - wonderful for a barbecue. I substitute rice wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar and use 3 Tbs of soy sauce instead of 2 Tbs. I don't wilt the spinach -- but I do occasionally add snow peas or sugar snap peas. Delicious!

This is delicious with some help. I also added blue cheese, I put only half the spinach, and I made 1-1/2 recipes of the dressing. I made it the night before to marinate the pasta and asparagus, then added 1/2 recipe of dressing before serving. It was a refreshing change from the ordinary pasta salad. It makes a ton, so if it's for under 10 people, you may want to alter the recipe. I served 8, and still have a large bowl leftover.

Made this recipe last night for some dinner guests - it was a hit! I did add some additional sliced green onions to the salad (not the dressing) and crumbled blue cheese. The blue cheese really made an impact -- in my opinion it wouldn't have been as good without the cheese. Topped it off with some crab cakes and white wine and crusty french bread - and we had an awesome summer meal - very elegant, and EASY!

I also added some red and yellow pepper for color and agreed that wilting the spinach would be a good idea. I made the dressing and did not like it at all, so I used a good bottled vinagrette instead. I think it needed that for flavor. We liked it that way and found the crunch porvided by the cashews a nice touch.

This was fabulous! I made it for a 4th of July dinner with grilled chicken and red cabbage slaw (vinaigrette, not creamy). I choose the bowtie pasta, which did make for a very pretty presentation!

Loved the textures and flavors of this salad! I made just a couple of changes - substituted veg oil for the 1/2C olive oil (I didn't think the olive flavor would work here) and 1T sesame oil for the 1T olive oil. The sesame oil added a bit more nuttiness (if this is a word?) to it. Made this twice and used sliced almonds the first time since they are what i had on hand.

This has been a favorite at our house since it was published in 1997! We like raw asparagus so I don't cook it. Also I use bow-tie pasta for a more festive look. This salad is a sure hit -- the bowl always comes home empty!

I used a spiral-shaped pasta and red-wine vinegar. Mixed everything just before serving, with toasted walnuts. It's Great! Very different. A nice spring-time salad. Will definately do again.

I made this for my Thanksgiving dinner as a side dish on the buffet table. I loved the flavors and the textures of the spinach, pasta, cashews, and the asparagus. This recipe is plentiful. I would definitely make this again.

A different and delicious new salad to add to my favorite recipe collection. I prepared the pasta, asparagus and dressing the night before and heated them prior to mixing so that it was room temperature when served. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. All four ladies requested the recipe.

DELICIOUS! I ALSO ADDED GARLIC, AND I SUBSTITUTED WALNUTS(TOASTED) FOR THE CASHEWS. I TOOK IT TO A SUMMER LUNCHEON AND EVERYONE ASKED FOR THE RECIPE! A BIG HIT.

This sounded so great! What happened? Very over-powering flavor of olive oil. The idea is good; however, the dressing really stinks. Sorry. I'd use the pasta, asparagus, spinach and some kind of nut with another dressing - one that truly compliments the other ingredients.

This is a great salad. The dressing also makes a nice marinade chicken for chicken. Recently, I added sliced grilled chicken to the salad for a office lunch: it was terrific.

This is a spring favorite for company. I've never once served it that people haven't raved about it. For a dish without garlic (we're all garlic fiends around here) the dressing is delightfully tangy. Not only do I adore this recipe, but I crave it each spring, and have to invent a reason for company so I can serve it. It's pretty soaked in the next day, so although I like to dig through it, I would not recommend tossing the pasta with the dressing ahead of time. The cashews get a little soaked by the next day too.

I've made this for a number of parties and people always rave about it. Try it with toasted almonds instead of the cashews. It's a GREAT pasta salad!

Very good, but I think it will taste better warm than cooled. Aside from the nuts, the spinach is the only ingredient not cooked. When added to the cooked pasta and asparagus, I find that the textures don't blend well. My advice: Cook the spinach a little to soften it up. Also, if you don't have cashews, try walnuts. Finally, add a little grated reggiano cheese on top.

The concept of this dish is wonderful. I found that it did not have much flavor. Although the ingredients are strong, the pasta does not seem to absorb the dressing. Someone suggested that I add 1/3 of the dressing after I drain the pasta, but while it's still hot; that way the pasta will absorb the flavor of the dressing. I will try this again.

This pasta salad has become a staple at our summer, outdoor dinner parties. The dressing is fantastic and can be used for other salads as well.
