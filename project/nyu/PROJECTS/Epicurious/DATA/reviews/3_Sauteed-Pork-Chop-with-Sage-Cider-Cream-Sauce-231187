I wanted to double the sauce for 2 chops, and the moment the 3rd spoon of vinegar hit the pan I realized it was a mistake. If you double this, do not double the vinegar. I tried to pour some off, with mixed success. So then I remembered that many people eliminated the water, which I did, and that was my next mistake. The second the cream hit the pan and curdled I thought "duh that was stupid." You need the liquid to avoid the curdling (I assume). Anyways, it tasted meh but I suppose it was my fault. I tell this story so others who come after me don't make the same mistakes.

Very simple recipe with a nice subtle flavor. I used shallots rather than onions and highly recommend the change as they really complement the cider vinegar flavor. Fresh sage is a must. As other reviewers suggested omitted the water, but used chicken broth for additional flavor. Mushrooms would be a nice addition to try next time.

Delicious. Brined the pork for an hour beforehand. Forgot the vinegar and it didn't seem to matter. Instead of heavy cream, made a roux by adding flour once the onions were almost done, cooking for a couple minutes, then pouring in milk. So tender and savory.

I've been making this recipe for about four years now. Every time I make it, I remember that this is the recipe that inspired my four-year old obsession with all things sage and all things vinegar. There are some other amazing recipes on Epi using both of these, but I always come back to this one. The only thing I've changed is I now use about a tablespoon of sage; other than that, I go by the recipe exactly.

Delicious. I browned the chop by placing it on a cold skillet while sauteing the onions on the side. Once the pork chop was seared, I added the cider and continued. I served with mashed parsnips and greens only. Very tasty and pleasant looking.

I would definitely make this dish again. I couldn't wait to write my review! I made a few changes. Instead of onions I used garlic. Kept everything else the same but added mushrooms and a pinch of cinnamon at the end, which really complemented the cider vinegar and the sage. I could really picture this dish over a split roasted chicken breast a bit more, which I will try next time. Overall, the sauce was very interesting and savory. To the new cooks out there, don't worry about the cream separating when you add it to the pan, it comes back together when simmering!

Sauce was ok. Pork was dry, cooked exactly as recipe specified. I'd make again only for the sauce. I made the full meal ("Perfect Pork Chop") with some changes to the other recipes. This sauce did complement the side dishes extremely well at least.

This was wonderful, I added roasted walnuts at the end-perfect!

This was absolutely delightful. I left out the water and used a pork loin cut into chops. I left out the water and added more cream. I also added roasted walnuts at the end-perfect flavor with the sage! My husband loved this!

This is an easy and tasty recipe. The apple cider vinegar and sage pair wonderfully. I made it for two and served it with spaetzle. The only change I made was to increase the amount of sauce.

Delicious! This is a great recipe, pork was tender and very flavorful. It was so good it inspired me to write my first epicurious.com review. I am currently between jobs and am looking for 20 "go to" recipes to add to my cooking arsenal. So when I return to work I have a good array of quick and easy recipes to make with simple ingredients for my family. This will be the first recipe I am adding to my repertoire. 19 more to go. p.s. I didn't have any sage on hand so I used some rosemary, oregano, and thyme I had in the garden. Turned out great. I might need to plant some sage now.

On advice from others, I also omitted the water. Sauce was terrific. Great with wild rice and sauteed greens.

Amor from Idaho USA on 10/09/06 - you did use cider vinegar, and not just cider I hope. If you did accidentally use apple cider instead of cider vinegar, that would explain why it was so sweet and you should try it again with the vinegar.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Everyone loved it. The cider and sage were subtle and a wonderful blend of flavors. I will be making this many more times. Just goes to show that it's not always good to modify a recipe.

I made this last night with mushrooms. I thought it was good but my boyfriend thought it was too sweet. I did add some extra onion that i needed to use up and omitted the water so perhaps that was why? Good flavor and lovely presentation but didn't make the favorites list.

This sauce was good. I omitted the water per comments below. I also sauteed diced mushroom in advance which I added to the sauce at the end when reducing it. Otherwise I made as written including the fresh sage and parsley; used a "high-quality" apple cider vinegar. The sauce was smooth and creamy with a little tang from the vinegar. Fresh sage is an absolute MUST in this. I tasted the sauce at the end before adding the parsley, however, and feel the parsley could honestly be skipped; I don't think it was worth the trouble for how little it added but definitely make a special trip for the sage. The mushrooms were a nice addition but I could tell the sauce itself was good; I would do the mushrooms again myself but they aren't necessary (nor in the original recipe, I know!). I had nice fat 1 inch thick chops and they were delicious with this sauce. While not a four fork revelation, it is easy enough for a weeknight, tasty enough for the usual rotation, and nice enough for company, especially with some dressed-up sides.

I wasn't very impressed by this recipe. It sounded really good on paper, but when I actually made it, I thought it was very bland. I ended up having to add a lot more sage to even taste it, plus there was no "cider" flavor from the cider vinegar. I definitely won't make this again.

Great, easy dish! I used thin cut pork chops, halved the cooking time for the meat, and doubled the recipe for the sacue. Also I didn't have any sage on hand so I used thyme. I thought the sauce was delicious and creamy, not thin at all. I used a large skillet and let it reduce until thick. The sauce was very flavorful! Would have been even better if I had the sage. Will definitely make again!

use light cream - and added a bit of regular apple cider.... wonderful dish!

I substituted eggs for the pork chops and swiss cheese for the sage and made a cheese omelet...I couldn't find oregano. DEELICIOUS!!!

EXCELLENT!! Why do people review a recipe when they use oregano instead of sage?

This is simple and elegant. I don't understand how someone can rate the recipe when they buy oregano instead of sage. But, this is GREAT!

i thought this was a fine recipe, but nothing special. It certainly is easy - with barely any prep time. I doubled the recipe for two pork chops. I used fresh oregano since my local market had no sage. I also added mushrooms as other reviewers suggested. Maybe it would have been stellar if I'd had fresh sage, but I doubt it. I think the recipe is just too mild for our taste.

Simple recipe, and the sauce has great flavor! Would definitely make again.

EXCELLENT! I made a few changes: used two 1/2" pork chops, added mushrooms to the sauce, used 3T cider vinegar (end of bottle) and used lowfat sour cream instead of heavy cream. Great flavor, easy to make this while cooking sides. Served it with mashed red potatoes and spinach. Definitely a keeper!

My husband and son went bonkers over this recipe. Both love pork chops and so I am always looking for different receipes for them. I am going to make again this weekend.

Rating: 3
This was great; I was surprised to see such a low "make again" rating. Of course, I didn't make quite exactly as written. Based on other reviews, I added a bunch of finely chopped mushrooms when sauteeing the onion, and didn't use as much water as called for. I even had to ADD a little water as it had thickened significantly when the pork chops were cooking covered. I think with the mushrooms this would be brilliant as well on chicken or rabbit.

This recipe was fast, easy, and I would definitely make it again. I had no problem reducing the sauce, maybe because I used a large frying pan. With the sauce reduced enough to just cover the chops, the flavor was concentrated and not bland at all.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish. I substituted a flavorful raspberry/apple cider instead of the water and thickened the sauce slightly with some starch and this had to be one of the best dishes the family has enjoyed.

I agree with another comment on omitting the water and reducing it significantly. It took forever to reduce the sauce ... but the flavor was well worth it!

After reading reveiws here, I went ahead and prepared this dish but simply ommited the water. It was amazing! Quick & easy, but good enough for a dinner party.

This was freakin' dreadful . A classic case of "looks good on paper....." . The sauce was tasteless - water with floating lumps of onion .Swine Flu must taste better than this . Spare the piggies this insult.

Not impressive, but a good start. As "ncage from IL on 12/09/04" said, the sauce is a bit thin. I also thought it was a bit bland. I found that stirring in a little Dijon mustard gave it more flavor. Since I LOVE both pork chops & sage, I'll try this again & next time, I might add a dash of Vermouth to the sauce too. It's also possible that I didn't reduce the sauce enough this time.

Hi everyone. This is my first rating. If they had a 2.5 starts i would rate it that. I found it to be a little better than average but i can't give it a 3. I did make small modification to the recipe. Where i buy my meat either had .5 or 1.5 in pork chops. Well i chose the .5 in ones. You have to love sage to like this recipe because the sage flavor is very strong. When i make it again, i will use less sage. Also the sauce is a little to thin for my taste. Either use less water or use cornstarch/flour to thicken it up. Also some mushrooms might be a nice modification to this recipe.

I don't understand you people. How can you rate something, that you are going to make again if you haven't even tried this recipe.. It's very annoying, that there are so many stupid people, that are rating these recipes before even trying them... What don't you understand, you either make it and rate it or don't rate it at all..A simple concept....

I marked that I would make it again only because I am going to make this. What I wanted to say was that I make a similar dish that is almost identical but is for four people and I use a bottle hard cider as opposed to the vinegar. Reduce the cider by three quarters and follow this recipe. It is a bit sweeter but has more tang than straight cider. The complexity it adds is just astounding. Cheers!
