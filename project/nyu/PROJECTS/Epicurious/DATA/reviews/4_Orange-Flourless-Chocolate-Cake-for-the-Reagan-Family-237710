Outstanding recipe. I wish I could give it more than 4 forks. It was dubbed the 26 second cake at my last function. That's how long it took for everyone to gobble it up. I didn't find it to be ugly either. I think you just have to be very careful not to over-beat it. Everyone wanted the recipe. I'll be making it for Thanksgiving this year. It's a keeper.

Fastastic recipe that I've made with rave reviews every time. Tried it also with a smaller pan (8") for a denser cake --- tasted great but the look wasn't as nice. I always add a splash of Cointreau or Grand Marnier before mixing in the eggs. Serve with a blackberry or other berry coulis -- just cook and crush fresh berries down a bit - can add liquor or not -- strain and make a bright stripe across the plate. Great.

This is my go-to gluten-free recipe. It's always a hit! I don't think the cake is ugly, it's not very tall though. I decorate with confectioner's sugar sifted over a doily with candied oranges slices in the centre.

Incredibly Dry! I made this in a 8 inch pan because I wanted the cake to be thicker, so I baked it for the full 40 minutes. It was terribly dry. The orange flavor was bitter and it didn't have a great chocolate flavor. If you make this cake, do use a springform pan to make unmolding easier.

I would like to make this recipe for a birthday party. The reviews all agree that the taste is great. However, many reviews talk about the presentation of the cake. Short of making a ganache, does anyone have the secret to produce a "presentable" cake?

Great recipe, super easy and quick to make! Used good quality dark chocolate instead of bittersweet (all i had on hand),and turned out great although a tad too sweet (will use half bittersweet and half dark next time). Looked great, used a doilley to cover cake when sifting sugar as decorations Made it look extra special.

This is absolutely the best. I added the zest of two oranges and also a couple of tablespoons of orange liqueur, I used Cointreau but I think Grand Marnier would work just as well. An absolute breeze to make. Can't go wrong. Covered it with sieved confectioners sugar and some fresh raspberries. I've made ti several times since I found it and people love it.

Made this for a friend who is allergic to gluten. I'd have no trouble embracing a gluten-free diet if all recipes are as delicious as this. I used just the rind and a bit of orange juice and dusted the cake pan with cocoa powder. :)

The cake is delicious and if you do not overbeat it after you add the eggs, it should not be unattractive. Mine looked terrific. I wanted more orange flavor so I took the juice of one orange and reduced it by simmering until a syrup and added that to the chocolate and butter. It added a wonderful orange flavor. Easy and delicious and you can cool it in the pan.

This recipe is great. I read some of the previous reviews, and I agree with it being an ugly cake. I made a rapberry chocolate ganache (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/raspberry-ganache-fudge-cake-recipe/index.html) to put on top of the cake to combat this. Other than that, the cake is absolutely delicious and really easy to make.

I've made this cake twice and it's true that it's not very attractive, but delicious. To fix the ugly, I mixed 1 Tbs orange juice (squeeze from the orange for the rind) with 1/2 C of powdered sugar, put it in a plastic bag with the end cut off & simply drizzled a swirl over the cake. Much better.

Delicious! Wowza! Made it for my MIL's bday (she's on a gluten-free diet and forever pessimistic that nothing gluten-free tastes good). It was demolished by five of us (it IS rather sweet - and I def recommend the ice cream). Half of the chocolate I used was orange-flavoured Lindt for an extra orangey kick, and decorated it with strawberries. Super easy and good!

Made this for a housemate's birthday on request, and I too had a less than aesthetic result. I tasted some crumbs after baking, and there was very little orange flavour, so I drizzled the cake with a little Orange Flower Water which helped. It had risen away from the bottom of the pan, so inverting it would have left a big hollow, therefore I left it right side up and dusted generously with powdered sugar and served with some homemade Bailey's ice cream. All in all a very tasty, moist and rich cake, but not overly heavy as some flourless cakes can be.

Delicious. A keeper.

The cake redeemed itself with the first taste - it was very moist and chocolaty, and the orange zest was just the right touch. It still looked funky and required a fair amount of doctoring (which is why I give it 3 forks instead of 4.) I dusted the cake with confectioner's sugar, mounded fresh raspberries in the center, and garnished with candied orange peel to disguise all the flaws. We put a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on each plate - very tasty!

My review is based entirely on appearance...we're serving it for dessert tonight so have not yet tasted it. This is a pretty homely cake - lots of bumps and craters top and bottom. I followed the recipe exactly - twice - with the same results. Now figuring out how to dress it up to hide the flaws. Fingers crossed that it tastes much better than it looks! Am serving it with raspberries, homemade vanilla ice cream and candied orange peel garnish.

This was absolutely fabulous! I was looking for a way to use up 2 extra egg yolks I had on hand and couldn't have found a better way to do it- and with ingredients I had on hand. Easy and delicious, my chocoholic husband loved it, too!

So simple and so good. Just made this for my family during the blizzard, when no one wanted to venture out and we used whatever we had in the pantry. This cake was a big hit. The orange is a great addition but isn't too strong. Delicious!

Spectacular, and spectacularly easy. Used a scary 99% cocoa chocolate [Lindt] instead of cocoa powder. Some less intense - the 85% version - for the rest. All in all, the cake retains the particular taste of the chocolate put in it rather faithfully. Served with a dark frozen chocolate mousse [funny - the recipe is very similar, sans butter], for a hot & cold version of the taste at once. Supremely recommended! ... with a caveat: make something for the reformed, denying or recovering chocolate addicts on the guest list.

This cake is spectacular. It was incredibly easy to make and I didn't even use a double boiler... I put the chocolate and the butter in the microwave for a minute or so and then I proceeded with the rest of the steps. The entire preparation took about 10 minutes and the result was amazing. I got so many compliments from my guests about how delicious and refined this cake was. I wouldn't skip the orange zest. It takes it above and beyond.

This cake is very quick and easy to make, and is nothing short of amazing. This is one to "wow" your friends with!

This cake is a BIG hit. I used to swear by a different flourless chocolate cake recipe here, but that one was a little flatter and had to be timed exactly right or it would be dry and a bit too bitter. This recipe is more forgiving and makes a slightly bigger cake. I use this recipe as a base and substitute other flavors for the orange zest and it's always, always a hit.

Made this for a friend's party, and it was a huge hit. Found the recipe super easy and relatively quick. I omitted the orange peel and added a pinch of salt to heighten flavor. All in all, an amazing (if decadent) dessert. One tip: make sure the cake is completely cooled, and sprinkle powdered sugar on top just before serving.

This cake is delicious, so chocolately. I gave a piece to a friend who cannot eat wheat flour and she loved it. It raised up in the middle, don't know what caused that.I will definitely be making this again.

my first time made this type of cake, it wasn't complicated to make, and came out wonderful! All of my guests loved it, a little dense and smooth, perfect for chocolate lovers. I didn't use candy orange peel, so I put 2 extra orange peel and 1/2 cup of orange juice. Will make it again tonight!

Incredibly smooth and a family favorite. Must like orange and chocolate together though! The orange flavor is beautiful and strong. I make my own orange peels and always serve with orange cardamon ice cream. Everyone loves it and it is soooo easy!
