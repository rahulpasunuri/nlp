Fantastic! Though I bought the premade crust. The trick it to get the crust nice and crispy.

I thought this was delicious. It was not hard to make. Enjoyed by all at my office!

The rhubarb tart is good, but more work than my favourite rhubarb custard pie recipe. I used strawberry jam instead of apricot jam with good results.

My husband is from Ireland and likes his rhubarb tart TART! He loves this tart as is. If you want it a little sweeter add 1/2 pound of strawberries and 1 1/2 pounds of rhubarb. Vanilla Ice cream is a must.
