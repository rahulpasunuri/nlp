This was quite yummy and so easy to make, too. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was very good but a little decadent. Next time, I think I will reduce the amount of butter. I served it over couscous, and it was an excellent combination.

This recipe is awesome and unbelievably easy. Want to prep and prepare in less than 10 minutes? Revise to this... saute precooked shrimp in ginger-herb butter. I served with snow peas and ginger fried rice. Can't get easier than that!

I love cilantro, ginger and chives so I enjoyed it. My family requested it with pasta which I was not too excited about but turned out that it was very good. I served with pasta, sauteed asparagus and fresh tomatoes. Very refreshing.

My husband is not a shrimp lover by any means, but I thought this sounded so good that I made it for him anyway and he loved it. I have to say that he was very surpised himself. The recipe was so easy to prepare. I wouldn't change a thing and can't wait to make it again.

So easy and so good. This was one the whole family liked. I didn't make any changes in the recipe.

I served this shrimp over pasta, and give it four forks for its wonderful flavor, ease of preparation, and the fact that EVERYONE in my family of seven loved this dish --- a rare find indeed!

This turned out to be great. My guests raved about it, and ate all of it! I would make this again in a heartbeat, only i would skip the other things on the plate. It would also be great over pasta!

Not fantastic, but better than mediocre. A good, solid meal with relatively easy preparation.

Delicious. I used 4 tbsp instead of 6 tbsp butter and it still had a nice buttery flavor and feel.

None of the ingredients overwhelmed but blended perfectly to create a really unique flavor. I also combined with linguine and it was delicious.

This shrimp recipe is to die for. I served it with a linguine dish and a nice spinach salad. We felt like we had a meal from a nice restaurant.

This is the first shrimp recipe from the internet that my husband and I really liked. It was delicious and reminded me of a meal at The Olive Garden - only better because I made it. Thank you.

I have had nothing but rave reviews whenever I have served this =)

I have made this recipe several times now. It is amazingly simple to make. I, like prior users, put all of the ingredients in a processor. I do cut down on the butter. I get cravings for this & just have to make it again & again!

This dish is very easy and quick. My family loved it! I put it over pasta once and stemmed rice the other. It's a good during the week dish.

An excellent, excellent dish, although perhaps too much butter.

I used this herb-butter mix on some catfish filets that I baked. I think the amount of garlic is excessive, but otherwise a solid recipe.

I have made this several times; I love ginger. I like to experiment with recipes so one time (at kitchen camp) I added some rosemary. The result was wonderful. This may be a contrast for some. Try the orignal recipe then experiment with rosemary on a few shrimps.

the shrimp was very tender and juicy, but i found the butter surprisingly bland.

Delicious! After following the directions and taking the time to evenly blend the herb butter, then realizing it was going to melt immediately when in the oven, I decided the next time I would melt the butter, add the other ingredients, and pour the mixture over the shrimp. Then I read Robert's review and his idea to use the processor. Great suggestion!

I gave this a 4 fork more for its ease of preparation. I bought pre-deveined shrimp...wisking off the shells was no problem. I did however melt the butter and stirred in the other ingredient, tossed in the shrimp and gave it a stir, and dumped it onto the broiling pan. Much easier than brushing it on. The minimal cooking time resulted in tender, juicy shrimp and allowed the freshness of the garlic, ginger and cilantro to come through. Next time to make it EVEN EASIER, I may toss all the ingredients (except shrimp) into the food processor. This recipe is also very forgiving in the measurements...I eyeballed everything...enjoy!

I knew when I read this recipe that I was going to like it, I love all the ingredients. It was really fast to prepare and very easy. I bought peeled and deveined shrimp which made it hassle free. We tossed it with penne pasta and had a great lunch!
