This was okay. I might make it again. I'm always looking for new ways to spark up my veggies.

I disagree with the last review; I enjoyed the flavors in this dish very much. I used red wine vinegar instead of white and the pureed walnuts impart a nice flavor to green beans, even if using so-so produce. I don't think you can go wrong with this one-- it was simple and good.

This recipe isn't bad. It just isn't that good. There are so many great recipes for green beans that I don't plan to make this one again.
