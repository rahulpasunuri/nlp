I made a vegetarian version, replacing the baking drippings with butter. The result is certainly tasty, though more a veggie chowder than a corn chowder. It was great with some fresh, crusty bread. Also, even a half batch makes a lot of very rich soup!

This is a very yummy corn chowder. The sweet potato was subtle, but it added nice color. I followed the instructions, with cilantro instead of basil/parsley and 1.5 limes (as recommended by prior reviewer). I garnished with chives and hungarian paprika. I would suggest the cheddar cheese be used as a garnish on individual bowls also. When you stir it into the chowder, it clumps and falls to the bottom. I used the kernels from exactly 4 ears and it was perfect. Next time I might add some jalapenos or other spicy pepper. I would definitely make this again.

Wonderful corn chowder! Kind of prep intensive, but once you get that out of the way, it's super easy. I added a can of Trader Joe's Crab meat, and I pan-seared the sweet potato chunks to give them some browned umami goodness. And I subbed one cup of coconut milk for one cup of the cream, which really turned out nice. And I added the juice of two limes to bump up the acidity. But I'll bet it would be just fine without all that. I'm just a little slutty that way. I like a LOT of flavor. This can roll right into rotation for the summer.
