I've happily tripled this recipe, doing as others have suggested; using smoked fish, sauteing the onion in butter and then roasting the curry powder in it, starting with cold cooked rice. It's also great with brown rice and peas and makes a lovely potluck contribution. If you keep or occasionally cook Kosher, this is also a nice change from traditional Ashkenazi cuisine, but it still has the smoked fish...

This recipe was exactly perfect for my needs, and of course it's highly adaptable to preference and what's available in your fridge or panty. I used leftover Zatarain's Yellow Rice, parsley and a good handful of chopped peppers and greens I had on hand from my wee summer garden, and used a home-blend Garam Masala for my curry powder. This time I used canned red salmon; next time I'll try mackerel or even canned smoked oysters. Healthy, quick, tasty, and easily scaled down to a one-serving portion. Thank you! My new breakfast favorite!

Youre right! This is way off. Start with shallots or onions cooked in oil/butter  I added ginger, curry, cayenne, a little turmeric and nutmeg (Im from Connecticut). Then I add the cold rinsed rice (which I cooked earlier with 6 cloves, chicken stock (or cubes)and a nugget of butter). I like it to get a little crunch. Then I add the fish (the whole idea of this recipe is using leftovers), some yogurt (especially if I went too hot), a handful of cilantro, some hard-boiled egg and VOILA!

This was a waste of both rice and fish. I've been trying to discover a way to simplify kedgeree and this is not it. Cooking the eggs with the rice at the very beginning is madness! The eggs should go in last. Also it needs onions at the very least. This all would be fine if a higher quality of fish were to be used but as of now this is a "find on the back of a soup can" style recipe.

This is a good, basic recipe. Not something I would serve guests, but a tasty enough meal in and of itself.

It is VERY important to use cold cooked rice in this recipe. Do NOT use hot rice! I did, and it was a mushy mess. As with all fried rice dishes, use day old, already cooked rice that has been sitting in the fridge. I'll make this again, but I won't make the same mistake again. Good flavor and love the eggs, regardless.

I make my family's version, which is close to this. However, we never used salmon! Poached, flaked smoked haddock (finnan haddie) is traditional - and utterly delicious.

I have been making this dish for years - but to make it work it is essential to use smoked fish - any sort of smoked fish - but I use John West Canned Boneless Kipper Fillets in brine!! add the total contents of the can as the brine adds a flavour. From David Cheetham a Boarding School Chef in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia (down under!).

Tried this recipe hot for breakfast one day and it was ummm...well different. It's not all that that, but it was a change of pace for all the eggs we usually eat for breakfast. I probably won't make it again.

Very easy to make.. and the ingredients are usually around the house anyway. It's great to come up with a recipe for canned salmon! It was a big hit at my house both for dinner (hot) as well as at breakfast (served cold). For breakfast, we topped the cold kedgeree with sour cream.

I love salmon and keep looking for new recipes that enhance its taste but do not smother it. Up to this point my best for breakfast had been "Salmon Hash" from The Heathman Hotel in Portland, but must confess the frozen hashbrown potatoes do not always come out with the perfect crispiness. While - I am good at making white rice, which is always perfect, and the ingredients involved can not go wrong - the mixture and taste are beautiful !! Loved this recipe.
