I took the foil over the cavity advice and this turned out delicious! It was fresh and light and I will definitely be repeating at my next dinner party.

good, easy to make, a little salty - I made without looking at the reviews and next time would do a better job of sealing the cavity

Pretty good. Salty -- admittedly -- and the branzino does have a lot of bones to deal with (even after filleting). But it was moist and pleasant. Would make again, and try to tinker. Probably try a coarse salt for easier removal and less salt left behind....

Very tasty & moist. Used Orato. Not salty like the recipes w/salt on both sides of fis. Cover cavity w/foil so it doesn't seep in. Done even when you don't think it is.

Very moist & good. Not saltly like the recipes where you put salt on both sides. Put foil over the cavity to prevent from entering. Don't overcook. Done even when you think it isn't

Great recipe!! If you are looking to reduce the salt, sandwich the fish between 2 pieces of parchment so that the salt does not touch the flesh. This dish should not be salty, and the fish should steam in it own juices. A very true Adriatic preperation.

LOVED THIS DISH! It was so flavorful and delicious. I wanted to lick the plate. I substituted cilantro for the parsley & rosemary and used less salt (but according to the directions). I will DEFINITELY make this again. Better than our favorite high end mediteranean restaurant in NYC.

The fish was very moist but extremely salty. If I could reduce the saltiness, it would have ranked 4 forks. Does anyone have any suggestions about what I might have done wrong? I thought I followed the recipe closely.

Just like what I get in Italy. Had a dinner party for some Italian experts and all agreed it was as good as you get in Milan. The best part is that it is so easy to do. Need to serve on hot plates or else the fish cools off to fast. I serve it with boiled potatoes and green beans and the best virgin olive oil you can find, drizzed over.

I was inspired to make this dish from episodes of one of my favorite over-the-top cooking shows: Iron Chef. Very simple and the result is extremely moist flavorful fish. Don't let this recipe intimidate you...TRY IT!

I havent actually made this dish, but I have eaten it in italy in a restaurant by the sea, and it was absolutely delicious...the fish was moist and tender and the sauce that was served with it enhanced the flavour..
