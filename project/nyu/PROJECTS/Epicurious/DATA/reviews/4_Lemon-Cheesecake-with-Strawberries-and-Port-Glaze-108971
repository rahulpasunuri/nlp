This is the first cheesecake that I ever made and it turned out perfectly. Plan ahead like the recipe says and give yourself at least three hours to prepare it the evening before serving. I followed the directions exactly as posted and added a different berry sauce. It melted in my guests mouths. Excellent!

I have made this cake three times now and at last think I have mastered the recipe. I made the port sauce twice and really think its not worth it, much nicer with some fresh berries. The cheesecake is really good, but you must make it 24 hours in advance and also leave it about 10 minutes longer in the oven.

recipe is definitely a keeper!

I was very disappointed with this. The receipe makes way too much cheesecake for a 10 inch pan. It overflowed to the top, cracked, and was still slightly gooey in the center bottom. I was also not impressed with the consistancy or the taste. I did not make the port sauce, but make a simpler strawberry sauce instead, which was very good.

Very good! I made this for my husband's birthday-he loves lemon. Turned out exceptionally well-even with very little cheesecake making experience!

I've made this several times for company and it always gets rave reviews. I add extra lemon peel/ juice, and I also put peel in the crust, just to give it a bit more lemony flavor. The port wine sauce really adds pop. It's very good!

I made this for our end of the summer block party. I was a big hit although I did skip the port glaze and instead provided cherry, blueberry, and strawberry toppings that I made from fresh fruit and reduced over the stove to concentrate the flavor. Took longer than I expected to make. Make sure to make at least one day before. I finished mine (2 cakes) about 1 hour before the party. The freezer brought the temperature to a reasonable level and every thing held together nicely but it would have been better with more time. I did bake them about 15 minutes longer but I had two cakes and they were in glass pans since I didn't have the high backed springform pans. Would definitely make again.

Wish I could have shared the same results as others, but after following recipe as written, the next day I opened the springform to find the crust completely soggy. The cake itself was also crumbly/soggy. It did taste good (at least the cake part that is), but the sogginess of the crust pretty much ruined it. One recommendation to others is not to increase the proportion of lemon. I used slightly less than suggested and the lemon flavor was still quite pronounced.

Absolutely delicious! The perfect creamy light cheesecake. My guests are still talking about it! I only had a 9 inch pan so I used 3.5 packages of cream cheese and 3 eggs and it came out perfect. Will definitely make this again.

I have been looking for a cheesecake recipe with sour cream in mix AND a sour cream topping. This one was perfect. I made it in individual mini cheesecake shells and froze them once they were cooled for a party. Came out perfect! Rave reviews!

A fun and easy cheesecake recipe! I didn't have enough lemons to make 3 tbsp of zest, so I used one tbsp zest and an extra 1/3 cup lemon juice. I also used more graham crackers (not sure how much, 2 of the 3 packets in the box) since I've found that the graham cracker crusts tend to burn when I follow the recipes. The cheesecake turned out beautifully and received rave reviews!

This is an excellent cheesecake! Received raves on this one. Great tart/sweet combo and beautiful presentation when topped with large, ripe strawberries. The port glaze is not at all necessary since the cheesecake is so delicious on its own. I won't make the glaze next time, but will definitely make the cheesecake again and again.

Absolutely excellent. Great flavor, texture and thoroughly enjoyed by everyone on Christmas Day. Did make the port sauce, which was very thick so had to zap in the microwave so that it would pour. Although good, dont think it was really necessary as the cheesecake was so good on its own. This is a keeper and will make again and again.

Made this for Christmas Day and what a huge success! Absolutely delicious, great texture and flavor. Did make the port sauce, which became so thick I had to zap in the microwave so we could drizzle on the cake. Flavor was also good, but dont think the cheesecake really needed it, it was great on its own. Will definitely make this one again and again. Best cheesecake I have ever made.

Easily one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made. I ditched the Strawberries and Port Glaze for Blueberry Sauce from LEMON-POPPY SEED WAFFLES WITH BLUEBERRY SAUCE. Put the sauce through a fine meshed sieve to get rid of seeds. Lemon and Blueberry, yum!

I almost cried to see this recipe which was one of the first desserts I learned to make in my mother's kitchen when I was ten years old. I happened to describe it to a friend last week, explaining that I had lost this favourite recipe. I am so excited to have it again. It is THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER. And you can substitute many flavours in lieu of the lemon as you prefer. Thank you thank you! P.S. I never made it with the glaze although I did accompany with blueberries (I am allergic to strawberries)

Very creamy cheesecake. I mixed the ingredients in a food processor because in my experience that makes it creamier. This was also the first time that I didn't bake a cheesecake in a water bath--I would have, but didn't have an outer pan that a 10" springform would fit inside of. Being concerned about that, I lowered the baking temp by 25 degrees and baked it a little longer. My topping also cracked, but I covered the whole top with home made thickened cranberry sauce, didn't make the port glaze this time. I think next time I will add more lemon zest or some lemon oil that I have, to increase the lemon flavor. This is a very rich and smooth cheesecake, a little tartness is welcome.

Wonderful cheesecake! I used Meyer lemons which gave the filling a whisper of bitterness that blended so well with the creaminess of the cheese and sour cream. Next time I will make a bit more of the crust--mine came up just slightly short.

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone raved how delicious it was. I used raspberries instead of the port glaze. It was a big hit.

made this dish for family at christmas and everyone raved. i definitely recommend making this recipe with the port glaze!

mmmmmmm delicious. I didn't even bother making the Port glaze and had it for desert at a dinner party - it didn't need the glaze so you can save yourself some added trouble. Maybe next time I'll try to make the glaze as well, but only if I have extra time. The cake did crack through the middle after taking it out of the oven, but I covered it with strawberries and no one noticed.

Using this recipe, I made a cheesecake for the first time. A couple of my guests and I thought it was the best we've tasted. I did not do the port syrup or strawberries, but simply added 3 tablespoons of raspberry preserves to the topping. Next time, I will bake my crust less than 10 minutes. Thank you.

Wonderul, creamy cheesecake. The topping cracked--but the cheesecake did not. I put a pan of water underneath while baking this. Did not use the port sauce, but made a strawberry coulis instead. I didn't give this four forks because of the crust--for some reason, it just did not work for me. Instead of molding it up the pan, I ended up just patting all of the crumbs on the bottom--it was still delicious.

This was very rich but delicious. Everyone loved it. The port sauce gave it a nice touch. It presented beautifully.

Absolutely, positively, the BEST lemon cheesecake I've ever had. Creamy and smooth, with a wonderfully intense lemon flavor. Instead of the port wine glaze, I paired this with the cherries in spiced wine syrup from the July 2003 issue of Gourmet, and used a shortbread crust instead of graham crackers. The cheesecake baked up perfectly -- no cracks, and almost totally even across the top (just a slight rise at the edges). Everyone who ate it raved -- and I had a great time scarfing the leftovers the next day!

Delicious!!! This is a wonderfully smooth and creamy cheesecake. Definately better the day after it is made. Did not make the syrup. Will definately be making this again. It got rave reviews from family members.

I love lemon desserts as well as cheesecake, and this is a lovely marriage of the two. As a reviewer said below, it has a perfect lemon flavor and texture. I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have graham crackers available, so I made the gingersnap crust from the Lemon-Ginger Cheesecake on this site. Wonderful! My husband and guests loved it too.

Made this for New Year's Eve, and everyone loved it. Have been asked to make again this weekend for a friend's birthday. Wonderful lemon flavor.

I am not a huge lemon fan, but I thought this was too lemony. Next time I would omit the lemon from the crust and maybe lower the amount of lemon in the filling as well. The sweetness of the port syrup was necessary to balance the lemon in the cheesecake. The texture of the cheesecake was good, but it rose more around the edges versus the center than most cheesecakes that I have made from Bon Appetit.

I made this for Christmas. WOW! Light texture and perfect lemon taste. This would also be excellent served with a raspberry puree topping. I will definately make this again.
