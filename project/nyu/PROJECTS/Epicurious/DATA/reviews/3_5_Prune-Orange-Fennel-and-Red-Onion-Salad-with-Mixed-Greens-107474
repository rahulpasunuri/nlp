An interesting combination! Rarely have prunes for dinner, but this worked.

The adjusted version I made was very nice. I didn't use prunes, just red onions, oranges, red lead leatuce, and fenel tops. I sliced the celery-like stalks and chopped the dill-like leafy bits. In the dressing I used fresh orange juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. It went well with our favorite easy recipe from this site Brazilian Chicken with Olives.

I found this to have no flavor. I used a combination of oranges and tangerines and was unhappy with the result. The actual salad dressing needed a total of 5 TBS of olive oil to cut the acidity. The dressing is good as a dressing, but the whole combo of the salad had no zip.
