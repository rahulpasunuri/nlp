The shrimp salad is fabulous and make it frequently in the summer as is.

Awesome. So fresh, simple and yet complex flavors, a snap to make. My father (86) who only eats meatloaf and tuna casserole said, "This is quite unusual...GOOD! Made just as the recipe said, make the sauce early on to meld flavors and make set up easy. Served with roasted baked potato slices (fries) and a spinach salad.

This is really a fabulous sandwich for eight people. Taking the advice of others, I avoided the bun and went to a full-size loaf of ciabata bread, cut in half horizontally. Doubled the tarragon-caper mayo and made it the day before. I cut a few medium shrimps in half (longwise) and began to layer onto one-half of the loaf, adding an extra large sliced tomato, avocado, and butter lettuce. This makes for a very high sandwich, so I used 8 inch wooden screwers, decorated with cherry tomatoes. What a presentation and a major hit with my guests. Served it with a cold green-bean/watercress salad and a fresh fruit salad with orange dressing.

I followed the recipe except that I chopped my shrimp up and mixed them with the mayo and celery. My only gripe is that this belongs on a sourdough roll or baguette. I had a momentary lapse in sanity and bought buns like the recipe said and they just aren't strong enough to hold the moist mix. And sourdough is just plain better in my opinion. Sourdough roll all the way next time. Otherwise tasty, fast and worth making again. Served with oven fries.

Excellent flavors! Love the idea of chopping up the shrimp or using small ones and adding to the mayo. Will try that next time. But I loved the tarragon-caper mayo and did make it a day ahead to allow the flavors to blend. The buttered and grilled roll is a must. I can't believe how much of a difference that makes.

Drat - reviewed this but neglected to provide the fork rating; correcting that now.

Wonderful! I used small shrimp (51/60) so I wouldn't need to chop them and mix them with the mayo; to save time I bought these little ones already cooked, peeled, and deveined from Whole Foods. Making the mayo ahead of time was a good idea, as the flavors had a chance to meld; I prepared it in the morning while I was cooking breakfast. Agree with another comment about quality of the capers being important. Be sure to use sweet onion (Vidalia, Maui, or Texas 1015), as regular onion will throw things out of balance. Finally, buttering and lightly cooking the rolls - YUM!

You will NOT be disappointed with this simple, but delicious recipe. It makes a world of difference if you get good quality capers. All the flavors come together to make a feast in your mouth!!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what, but my mayo mixture came out very liquid and didn't have much taste. I had to sub celery salt for the celery seed, but I don't think that would make much difference.

I coarsely chopped the shrimp and added to the mayo mixture as suggested by another reviewer.We get wild caught gulf shrimp here so it was delicious! Very similar to a lobster roll.

I used jumbo sized shrimp and believe the sandwiches would have been easier to handle if the shrimp were coarsely chopped and added to the mayo mixture. Next time, I'll use smaller shrimp and also cut back on the onion.

This sandwich was so good, I went to the store the next morning to purchase more shrimp. We made it again the next day for lunch! I marinated the shrimp in olive oil, lemon peel, garlic and S&P for 30 minutes first. Then I roasted them in the oven at 350 for 7 minutes. Delish!
