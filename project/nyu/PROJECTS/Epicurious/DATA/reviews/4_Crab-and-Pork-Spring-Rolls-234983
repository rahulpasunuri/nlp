These are awsome. I used a dipping sauce from allrecipes.com and it was perfect. Definatly going to be a hit on new years eve.

These are sublime! I love spring rolls, although I'd never made them myself before. These are the best I've ever had, by far. I'm not sure what I loved more -- the complex way the progression of flavors unfolds itself in your mouth, or the contrast between the crisp, light exterior and the meaty filling. Truly one of the better things I've ever made.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!! My only complaint is that the recipe didn't make enough. I used canned crab which worked fine. Was good with the nuoc mam dipping sauce and purchased Mae Ploy sweet/sour chili sauce.
