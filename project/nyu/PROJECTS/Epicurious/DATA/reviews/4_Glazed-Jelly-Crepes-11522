I'm not getting this either. Last critique is 10/21/07. Ok. The posting before was in 2003. And this is a top rated recipe? Explain, please.

Delicious and easy! I didn't think this recipe would yield enough for two, so I doubled it. Doubled, it made just enough for two.

Delicious and easy. Good way to show off homeade or gourmet jellies and jams.

This recipe gets four forks because it is not only very delicious, but also very easy. The crepes can easily be made ahead of time, and the rest of the preparation takes no time at all. We'll be making these for Mother's Day brunch this year.
