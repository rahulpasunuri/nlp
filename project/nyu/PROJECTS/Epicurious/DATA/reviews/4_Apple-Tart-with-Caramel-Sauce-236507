Hated it! As previous reviewer says, it does not use a true caramel sauce. The brown sugar sauce is not amazing. Frankly, too much effort for too little flavor return. It was edible, but uninspired. Won't be making again.

Tasty! Kid friendly but not too sweet. I plan to peel the apples next time I make this, but other than that I won't change a thing...

So delicious! And pretty easy to make, too. I had a ton of caramel sauce left over though - may cut it down to a third next time I make it. The crust was too dry so I added another egg yolk and it came out flaky and delicious. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over.

delicious!!!! I whip the extra cream with honey and a pinch of cardamom to top it off. I've made this 3 times now and will definitely make again!

My only complaint is that the one egg in the dough is not enough moisture to pull it together, so I added some water. I also decided to put a little caramel sauce along the inside of the crust before putting in the apples, and it was delicious!!!

This was good but not amazing. I also cooked it for only an hour. I didn't like the texture of the caramel sauce and was hoping for a creamier, dulce de leche-type sauce. I made this for Thanksgiving and people liked it, but preferred my other dessert.

Gorgeous, relatively easy ... keep an eye on temperature and length of time in oven. I had the over on 350, not 375 and it only took an hour. Homemade caramel? what could possibly go wrong? I bring this to the in-laws ... that speaks for itself!

More like 3 1/2 forks. I really enjoyed this but as other reviewers have mentioned, the cooking time really seems too long. Mine was ready in about 50 minutes using a convection oven. I also only made 1/3 of the caramel sauce and that was plenty! The crust is simple and very tasty (reminds me of shortbread), but the cardamom really makes this recipe shine.

This is a great recipe - once you make the changes suggested by the reviewers: don't cook so long, make less caramel sauce, add some liquid to the dough - or be ready to process it for a long time (and from me, don't cover with foil too tightly at the end or the apples will steam and burst ruining the pretty browned top and leaving you with applesauce). We used an 11" tart pan and overlapped some of the apples (all cut into eighths). This recipe is a good example of one of the few things that irks me about this site: the disconnect between recipe and reviews. There is no way that tart could cook as long as the recipe says without burning, but that's how the recipe reads, and it won't be changed. Thank goodness for reviewers!

Everyone loved this dessert...even the small grandchildren that never eat "pie"! The caramel sauce really makes this....don't buy store sauce!

So easy, so good! I used premade crust and it was fine. I'm sure the recipe crust is much better. Baking time seemed too long, but then I used a convection oven. Using MacIntosh apples, 40 minutes was all it needed.

I cheateed and used store bought caramel sauce because every time I try to make it, it exploes. Also, I don't like cardamom so I used clove instead. This was simple, elegant & delicious. A perfect fall dessert. I would so make this again!

(1) Photo is inaccurate--those are eighths, not quarters. Food stylists take liberties. (2) The large amount of apples is key to moistness, apple-to-crust ratio, and the long bake time. To fit all the apples put them on edge, so the wide side is sideways, and crowd them in. You end up with hardly any space between apples. (3) Sauce isn't traditional caramel, but it's easy to make and not overcook, and I like brown sugar. Mine is baking right now and smells great, but I'll check the crust at 45 minutes for burning. I'm making it for a harvest-themed dinner and using local Macintoshes that are tart, crisp, and delicious. My beef: why roll out crust to 13 inches for a 9-inch pan with 1/2-inch sides? Enough leftover crust for a 7-inch tart. I used one whole egg instead of 2 yolks and 1/3 cup granulated sugar instead of confectioner's. Will rate after consuming.

Loved this! Made 1/2 the recipe for the caramel sauce and used a frozen pie crust to save some time.

This recipe went down a real treat! Added double the amount of cinnamon as I am a cinnamon fan :) I admit I'm not a dab hand with pastry but this crust recipe was easy to follow, it turned out lovely and crisp. The thick caramel sauce really adds that extra oomph though - I made a third of what the recipe recommends (thanks to other reviewers who advised doing so, I still have quite a bit left over!) and I didn't have whipping cream so I subbed in single cream. Yum! To add to other comments on timing - I baked it for the full hour and fifteen minutes, and when I took it out the crust was literally teetering on the verge of blackening, any longer and it would've burnt. Anyway, the family loved it!

I have made this dessert at least 5 times now and it always gets great reviews from my guest. The only thing I do different is buy puff pastry sheets and roll out and put in a spring form pan. If you really want to be quick then you can buy good quality caramel sauce, but when I have time the homemade sauce is the best

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and I only made half of the caramel sauce. It was delish. I will make again but add a bit of apple brandy for more flavor.

great recipe but very very sweet! what to do with all the extra carmel though...

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe, but needs a few modifications (as other reviewers have helpfully suggested before me): 1.) Only 1/3 of the caramel sauce is needed (I poured all of this over the tart before serving, and it was perfect) 2.) The baking time needs drastic cutting as well -I baked mine for 45 minutes 3.) Finally, 6 large apples is way too much if you want your tart to look like the accompanying picture (and quartering the apples leaves you with pieces that are too large and bulky). I used four medium apples that I cut into eighths. I also tossed them with a bit of lemon, since I used sweeter apples.

Rating: 4
I made this for a quick weeknight dessert, and it was great. Easy to prepare and an awesome presentation. I garnished it peanuts for a little texture. I agree with the previous reviews...I only made 25% of the caramel sauce, which was plenty for the tart and accompanying ice cream. This is definitely going to become a fall favorite.

Rating: 4
Simply amazing! And the the crust... wow.... turned out perfect. The caramel sauce is a must! People licked their plate. The only thing, mine did not need to bake for an hour and 15. Watch the crust and make sure it does not burn... I covered mine after about 45 min and then baked for another 10.

I made this tart for a dinner party my boyfriend and I were having, and got rave reviews! That little bit of cardamom just adds something too it, making it even extra delicious.

This tart is really excellent - although I found that if you follow the recipe, you will have far more caramel sauce than you will need. I used about 1/4 of the sauce I made by following the recipe, and it was still delicious! (Had I used much more than that, I think the tart would have been drowning in caramel - but now we have plenty left over to use over ice cream!)

Made two of these for a party. People raved! Thanks to the cook who let us know that the carmel sauce made a large quantity. Saved me from making a double recipe of the sauce.

What a beatiful and simple dessert! I used granny smith apples and the tartness went perfect with the sweeteness of caramel. I only used 5 apples and still it was too much for a 9 inch pan. Also, the caramel sauce portion makes 5 times as much as needed. I used raw sugar instead of brown and came out just fine. The crust was easy to handle although I had to add a 1 tbs of ice water as it wouldn't bind with just egg yolks alone. Can't wait to make this again!!

Very good and easier to make than other apple pies because of the big chunks of apple (less slicing).

Terrific tart. Looks wonderful and taste even better. Followed the directions to a T, and all turned out well.

The crust of this tart was lovely. It was easy to handle. I rolled it out between sheets of plastic wrap and froze it in the tart pan. When I filled it (thawed) and baked it,it browned up beautifully. My Austrian niece pronounced this "just like a French apple tart". The caramel sauce was awful, however. I would never make it again (the sauce). The dark brown sugar was too powerful and the sauce was grainy and unpleasant. It made entirely too much, as well, which is a waste of ingredients. I made a typical caramel sauce using caramelized white sugar, butter and cream.

This was an excellent dessert at Thanksgiving dinner and incredibly easy. We re-warmed it prior to serving and served it with french vanilla ice cream. It was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie.

Excellent! However, I took out the tart much earlier than in the recipe and there was a lot of apples left (which we did not mind as the apple was good as such anyway).

Rating: 3
This was truly excellent- Much faster and better than your tradtitional apple pie. The pastry crust was really easy to deal with (even if you're just using a hand pastry blender rather than a food processor) The caramel recipe is a little extreme- it makes about three times what you need but it's great leftover. I followed the recipie exactly but using honey crisp apples from NY state- they've been great in this recipe. I also recommend adding a dash of unsweetened cocoa to the filling before you toss the apples with it- keeps them guessing.

I made this recipe for a family gathering, and it was gobbled up. Everyone said it was even better than apple pie. To follow up on the other reviewers, I added 1 tbsp of butter, 1 tbsp of sour cream, and 1 tsp of lemon juice to the dough. It turned out a little too moist, but I think that may be the trick, as it baked up perfectly with the apples in 1 hour and 15 minutes. I didn't use foil and the crust was just perfectly round. In the future, I would make sure to preheat a baking sheet and place the tart plate on the baking sheet to keep the bottom crust a little bit more crisp and to prevent the apples from dripping into the oven. I used 5 small to medium sized granny smiths, and they fit pretty well. I would probably use 6 apples next time. I also cut the caramel sauce by 1/3 and it was still way too much. As a side note, I believe this recipe would be fabulous without the caramel sauce as well.

i cheated, i cheated, i cheated! however, despite my penchant for all things bad, this may be the most bautiful dessert i've ever made. it was a snap to make--only difference was i had to cover the edges of the tart crust with foil about halfway through baking to prevent burning-- they were darkening too fast. and about my cheating: i used bottled caramel sauce. yes, bottled! worked just fine, saved some work, not as tasty as homemade, i know. but it looked just as gorgeous and tasted delish! oh, yeah, i could fit in only 4 apples, no way could the tart pan have held 6 of them. everyone raved about this dessert; it looked fab; it's one of my new faves.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe for a simple, delicious tart- although I deviated from the crust by adding 2 additional tbsp of butter and pressed the crust in the tart pan rather than rolling which saved time and less mess. I also only used half the apples and found that was enough for a very full tart. Caramel sauce made enough that I saved the rest for the next tart. Rave reviews from my friends.

Rating: 2
I am not sure where this tart went wrong as I followed the recipe, but I just didn't enjoy it at all! I ended up with too many apples (enough to make 2 pies), and I thought the baking time was a bit long as the crust burned on its top edges. It tasted like an ordinary dried out apple pie.

a cook from RI This is a fabulous recipe! To speed it up, use prepared Pillsbury pie crust. If you don't have a tart pan, use a pie pan....received awsome reviews! The Coriander is a must even if you need to grind your own and 1/4 cup of dark rum added to the caramel makes it sublime!

Excellent. I followed the recipe exactly with great success. I had no trouble rolling the dough, but be sure to let it rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour-- that usually makes things easier. The caramel sauce is delicious as well, and it's very impressive looking to boot.

i have made this tart 2 years in a row now for several holidays and its so easy and wonderful. the crust is the most time consuming so if you are pressed for time just buy the crust at your grocers. the rest is so easy! the carmel recipe i have done many times and it says to cook unil it coats a spoon thickly. it never does that for me but once i start to cool it it thickens. love this recipe!

I also had trouble with the dough. It was dry so I added water, then it was too sticky so I had to throw some of it out. It worked out eventually though, and was very beautiful and delicious.

Rating: 4
The tart got good reviews from everyone who ate it. I had to add a little water to the dough while it was in the processor to get it to moisten into clumps (about 2 tablespoons). Also, lacking ground cardamon, I extracted cardamom seeds from some cardamom pods I had and ground them in a coffee grinder. Last, I didnt have a 9 inch tart pan, so I used an 11 inch pan instead. I covered the tart with foil after 30 minutes and removed it from the oven after 60 minutes.

I made this last night for a potluck dinner party and everyone raved about it. I will say that the dough was difficult and resisted rolling, so i ended up just pressing it out in the tart pan with my fingers. But the caramel sauce was to die for, and I didn't think there was too much. I drizzled it on the tart after cutting it, and then had some on the side for people to put on their ice cream.

I hate to be the lone dissenter here! After reading such positive reviews and being a lover of tarts, I decided I had to make this one. Certainly not the best! The crust was not great, the apples were okay. The only delicious part was the caramel sauce, which I made better by adding bourbon after heating. Yummy! Overall, like a caramel apple in tart form. For a really great crust and filling, try the nectarine tart with brown sugar crust on this site...

Delicious!!! I'll make it many times more. The biggest hit on a table with other fine desserts. And, it makes the house smell great when baking. I wonder if it should be made in a larger tart pan as the 9-inch doesn't seem to accommodate all of the apples called for.

Agree with other reviewers. Absolutely delicious all three times I've made it. I've replaced one third of the crust flour with whole wheat flour, and that tasted great. Honey Crisp apples have been delicious in this tart!!!!

Many compliments on this dish at our thanksgiving table as well. I do agree that there is a lot of caramel left over, so next time I will likely cut that part of the recipe in half. I also used Fuji apples to go along with the cinnamon feel of the dish. I find Golden Delicious to mushy when cooked and I like my apples to be a bit more firm. The fuji apples worked great.

At my thanksgiving table, you will find an array of desserts. This was the only dish where I swear they were licking the pan! This apple tart was incredible. I lightly glazed the apples with the carmel and then let folks add as much carmel as they needed. (This was a wonderful plan for those diabetics at the table who were watching their sugar intake...) I probably have enough carmel left over to serve over 2 more tarts. This is fine as I will be making this tart 2 more times this week, on request! Great recipe!

This was a huge hit. There is a lot of carmel, but I figure it will be delicious on Ice Cream. I made the tart with half apples and half pears and it was superb. Beautiful presentation!

I made this as the 2nd dessert for Thanksgiving dinner. Family and friends LOVED it! As a matter for fact, one of our guests indicated he liked it better than any of the many, many desserts I've served over the years. High praise indeed. Was most assuredly a hit. A few things, however. Because caramel is so inherently sweet, I substituted 4 Granny Smith and 2 Idared apples for the 6 Golden Delicious (which I feared would be too sweet). Also, the recipe makes A LOT of caramel. I think you could easily cut it in half unless you want a lot of caramel on the side.

I don't normally like dessert nor do I usually make them but this was so easy and delicious, I can't wait to make it again. My family loved it and I liked it much better than apple pie.
