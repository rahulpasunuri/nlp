Simple recipe and easy to make. 2nd time I made it. First time I found it needed a little something. I used GF corn pasta and made a few other changes. Doubled the parsley, added a dozen grape tomatoes 1/2ed and 20 medium sized capers to add some zing. Put some goat cheese on each plated I served. Delish. Everyone loved it.

Delicious. Also tried it with the following mods: Used soba noodles instead of linguine. Sautéed shallots and mushrooms and added them to the mixture (replacing onions)

Yummy, easy, healthy, and inexpensive. You can't do much better than that! I appreciated other reviewers' suggstions; I used Starkist packed in olive oil and added a little more olive oil to keep the pasta from gumming together. I was skeptical about the amount of lemon juice and about the raw onion and garlic, but I'm a believer now.

Qiuck, easy, tasty, and healthy. A keeper. (I used Starkist tuna in olive oil and Trader Joe's spinach-chive linguini.)

I made this with oil-packed BumbleBee tuna with chipotle- gave it a pretty good zing, but not too hot to enjoy. even my 8-year old granddaughter liked it. Also put in some white onions and green onions, but sauteed them along with part of the garlic first. Served the result a bit warmed - delicious. I used plain linguine but i think spinach linguine would be better.

Lovely and, like all simple recipes, it's all in the ingredients (tuna & pasta here): the tuna doesn't necessarily need to be italian (I'm italian born and bred), there is some fantastic Spanish or Portuguese tuna as well, just make sure it's in fillets rather than flakes and preserved in a jar in extra virgin olive oil. I advise to use italian branded dry spinach or "paglia e fieno" tagliatelle, it's a must. Enjoy!

Classic recipe which is ideal for Weight Watchers. Lots of protein paired with good carbs and appropriate healthy oils. It is also delicious!!! Serve it with a salad of mixed greens and vegetables and it is a perfect lunch.

Love the recipe, easy with staples, fast. Harris Teeter has Italian tuna in olive oil for 2.40, 4.5 oz

After having Italian tuna in Italy years ago I vowed to never eat any other kind of canned tuna. Costco now carries a reasonably good brand at a Costco price. Toss in a few capers or black olives if you want to add a bit more panache. I assume this San Francisco brand of pasta is only available regionally, but Alfredo's brand makes a WONDERFUL variety of spinach linguine.

Easy and nutritious, and oh-so-tasty. Trader Joe's sells canned Italian tuna in oil at a much lower price than the SF cook paid.

I made this recipe last night and we loved it! It's packed full of flavor. I was surprised the Italian tuna in a jar that I bought was so expensive - $15, but well worth it. I tweaked it a little by cooking the garlic and red onions first. The recipe didn't say anything about cooking those. I don't like raw garlic and onions so I cooked them and the dish was amazing. The leftovers were even better then next day.

This is a very simple pantry-staple meal to throw together on the fly. I had really nice tuna in olive oil from Italy, perhaps that made it extra delish! I think you can switch it up according to taste. I used oregano instead of parsley, added some diced tomato and used a rotini-sort of pasta bc I had that on hand.

Loved this! I used tuna packed in water instead (it's what I had). I drained the tuna and didn't keep the water. I added extra virgin olive oil to the liquids to replace the oil from the canned tuna. Very delicious and great as leftovers. Will definitely make again.

I liked this recipe and will make it again. It is very quick and easy, and I usually have the ingredients on hand, great for a weeknight! This would also be good to bring as a pasta salad to a barbecue or similar.
