I like this recipe a lot as a base. Prepared on its own it somehow seems a little too acidic for me. I usually add an apple sliced thinly, raisins, and a tiny bit of mayo as well as using sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. Having tried Napa and green cabbage I think I actually like the green better. That said, it makes for a very tasty and flavorful dish that is absolutely amazing on sandwiches or mixed into a big salad. My go to for a slaw.

This is a really good recipe for all of that cabbage from the CSA. I've tried many on this site and this one is the best. Some changes I've made that really make it tastier and more substantial: grated carrots as others have suggested, chopped red pepper, golden raisins, and sliced almonds. I usually also double the ginger and add an extra jalapeno.

This was a very nice change from most slaw recipes that call for mayo or yogurt based dressing. I added sweet red and orange peppers for color rather than the traditional carrots. As others suggested, used some sesame oil. Light, a little heat, and healthy!

This recipe was pretty good as is. I made a few changes (replaced half of the oil with sesame oil as suggested, used a whole jalapeno with seeds instead of a serrano, used seasoned rice vinegar and no sugar, and also added some lime juice). It was delicious. I would probably follow some of the other suggestions next time, such as, add some red cabbage for color and texture and maybe some sliced almonds as well. I used a whole jalapeno and it was not very noticeably spicy, so definitely use a serrano or more jalapeno if you like spicy food! Would definitely make this again!

Amazing and fresh partner with pork ribs. I took the advice of other cooks and added shredded carrot for color, toasted semsame oil in stead of veggie oil. Had no serranos so used hot sauce instead.

I just love this slaw. I usually forget the ginger on accident, I always use red cabbage instead (I like the color and crunch) and sometimes add sesame oil. No matter how I make it, I just can't mess it up. It has such a refreshing flavor. It was 90 yesterday for the first time all year and I immediately ran to the store, picked up the ingredients to make this slaw and fish tacos and some Corona, of course! I sat on my back patio, with a fire in the chiminia, our fountain going, with my two dogs and couldn't have had a better evening.

This is excellent! Doesn't need the sugar at all. I made this to go with the Seared Asian Steak and Mushrooms instead of the mixed greens and it was delicious.

This is a very refreshing cole slaw with some good spice and Asian flavors. As per the other suggestions, I added a few other ingredients to give it some more color and taste. I added some rainbow salad mix (slivered broccoli, carrots, and red cabbage). I also doubled the cilantro, added some coarse ground pepper, and added some toasted sesame seeds. I will definitely do this again.

This is a delicious recipe that, as other reviewers have said, needs an extra bit of color. Shredded carrot fills that role nicely. I had some walnuts in the cupboard, so I toasted some of those in the oven until they were dark, chopped them up, and mixed them into the slaw. They added a satisfying texture and smoky/earthy contrast. I'd add those again next time.

We made this just as written and really enjoyed it! We served it inside of and on the side of fish tacos. It was such a nice, clean, fresh accompaniment.

This was a delicious slaw with fish tacos! I doubled the dressing and used it as tilapia marinade. Like others, I added some lime and sesame oil (plus a bit of green curry paste). I had 1/2 head napa cabbage, and 1/2 head of red cabbage, so the colors were stunning. I rated this 3 of 4 forks since I had to add ingredients for more pizazz.

Used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar and a jalapeno pepper instead of serrano and it was great. Very easy to make. Topped it with poached king salmon for a great summer supper.

This was great. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and made a few changes. Instead of the vegetable oil, I used the toasted sesame oil. I also added a touch of lime juice and some lime zest. I had to turn the heat down and use a anaheim chili, instead of the serrano, so my husband didn't burst into flames. It gave the perfect amount of heat for us. I topped this off with about a quarter cup of chopped cashews. Delish.

Very very good. I added lime, a grated carrot and sesame oil as suggested and it gave it color and subtlety. My loved it.

Delicious! This zippy dressing really jazzes up a head of Napa cabbage. Nice balance of sweetness, tang, and spice. Very fresh and light. I think the play of the bright green scallion and cilantro looks great against the pale green cabbage, but I bet a shredded carrot and maybe some grated radishes would look nice and add to the flavors. I'm definitely filing this one away to make again next winter during the seemingly endless cabbage season!

I used regular green cabbage, and like other cooks substituted sesame oil and added juice of 1 lime. I thought it was delicious! although it is not colorful. Adding carrots would have made it more visually appealing. This must be one of lowest calorie recipes on epicurious, surely 75 calories per serving, and very healthy. Also a good recession option, cabbage is 79 cents a head at my local supermarket.

As a shopper at Trader Joe's, I used their broccoli slaw and orange champagne vinegar (a staple in my pantry), and added wedges of clementines. I had no chiles, so substituted a bit of the oil with chili oil instead. Great for a party as it doesn't wilt on the buffet. A nice, mild, light side salad that would be a great lunch with sliced chicken thrown in.

I used regular white cabbage instead of napa, and I added the zest and juice of one lime. I got rave reviews at the barbecue I took it to and will make this again to eat the whole salad at home!

Tasty and easy. I added cumin because I love it and substituted siracha because I did not have a fresh chili. I also added a touch of sesame oil. You could make many minor changes, it is a good basic reipe.

This is a nice simple recipe that is easy to improve. Instead of vegetable oil i used sesame oil. To give it some color I added two carrots. I then lightly wilted the scallions, cabbage and carrot (~30 secs) and then tossed with a bit of fish sauce. I poured the dressing over right before serving and it was nice simple side dish to an Asian flavoured fish dish.

we loved this recipe. i made it w/ one of those pre-cut bags of cabbage for making slaw, and cut back on the oil. so it was super easy, healthy and really delicious!

Good but not great. Husband wasn't too thrilled, I liked it more than him. It's very lite and has a subtle and refreshing flavor. I only added half the amount of the fresh pepper and I used jalapeno. Husband doesn't like too much heat.The slaw lacked colour, it was a little boring to look at. All in all this was nothing spectacular, but not bad either. I probably won't make this again because I only tend to repeat recipes that are 100% fabulous.

Pretty good stuff. I forgot to buy fresh ginger and had to use dried, but added the juice of 1/2 lime to both accent the chiles and get a little of the citrusness of the fresh ginger back. The cabbage is just kind of there, but it's great on a BBQ steak sandwich. I might try adding a dash of cumin and back off a little on the cilantro next time.

This is a wonderfully light and spicy dish. Check out the Spicy Thai Shrimp with Mint Raita, as they suggest. The two make for a lovely meal that is quite easy to prepare. And a sauvignon blanc pairs delightfully with the spices; the food and the wine together seem more vibrant and your palate is not taken over by the chiles.

We made it to pair with the Miso Sesame Grilled Blade Steaks, as suggested in Gourmet of August 2008. Oh, man. They were perfect together. The flavors really complement each other. We loved this one. Bright, clean flavors, zippy and brisk.

We absolutely loved this. The serrano chile made the difference. (Jalapenos are too hot for my husband.) Definitely a BBQ keeper.

I liked this recipe, but like others said, it's not out of this world. I hate soggy, regular coleslaw and felt this was a wonderful option instead. Next time I don't think I will leave the seeds in the pepper though, just to reduce the heat a bit.

So, since the recipe doesn't say I can't, I made it ahead. Got very soggy and sad looking, but tasted okay. Not delicious, but what do I expect when I start with a Napa cabbage?

We also substituted jalapeno and I added in thinly sliced mango. the sweetness was great with the spicy dressing. the whole family enjoyed it.

I too substituted jalapeno for serrano peppers. Everyone in my family liked it except for my hubby who does not like spicy food. I will still keep it in the till to take as a BBQ side.

Definitely worth doing for a BBQ as a nice, easy side. With other heavy foods, this is a nice counter-balance.

This was a tasty and super easy picnic contribution. Used jalapeno instead of serrano, still a surprising kick (warn guests!), make sure to use fresh herbs. Not a mind-blowing recipe by any means but a nice summer side.
