Everyone loved this one.... It looks as though no 'forkage' means a zero rating.... Think that this will be dinner tonight. 'Forking' the recipe in advance so that people won't think that it's awful. : )

We loved this recipe. Super easy and quick with ingredients always on hand. Great weeknight meal. Even my young daughter loved it. Will definitely make again whenever I can find turkey thighs.

Oh please! It's turkey, not Turkey. The Republic of Turkey is a country located mostly on the Anatolian peninsula. Sarcasm intended. The recipe? Loved it, but made it with chicken thighs instead of turkey...on the grill. No sarcasm about that.

Um, chili not Chile. Chile is a country in South America.

Just made this for 6 and everyone raved. Made it the same way I make all poultry: mixed up the paste (doubled the amount which was plenty, but I like to not run out), put it between the skin and meat, and marinated for a few hours. Because I don't have a grill, I just baked it in the oven. I used legs and thighs, and then sliced it off the bone. Accompaniments were prepared Tamarind and another flavored chutneys. Couldn't have been easier or better. I usually make turkey breast, but will do this much more often. Everyone loves dark meat, it's half the price, and juicier.

This was exceptionally wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!
