Amazing dish. I added some leftover basmati rice slightly warmed and it was a wonderful compliment. Got all main ingredients from the local farmer's market, including the smoked chicken which was out of this world. For a cold dish, all the flavors mingle together nicely. Not too much onion or ginger flavor. I tossed the heck out of this, turning it over at least 30 times because it looked dry. It wasn't and I'm glad I trusted the recipe. Served it with toasted baguette and a grenache/chardonnay blend from Cote Est-Catalan.

This is a really great recipe for summer days when the last thing you want to do is to turn on the oven or stove. I don't like cucumbers, so I omitted that and doubled the peas, I substituted leftover chives for the scallions, and used a lemon-pressed olive oil. Really fantastic. If you want the ginger flavor to stand out, let it sit in the lime juice to bring out the flavor.
