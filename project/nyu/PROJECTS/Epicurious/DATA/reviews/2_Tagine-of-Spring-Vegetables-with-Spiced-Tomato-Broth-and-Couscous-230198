Nothing special. The eggplant needs a lot more than 20 minutes in the oven to make it soft. This is dish has too many ingredients that don't come together with a single theme. I doubt I'll make this again, but if I did, I would boil all the vegetables in the broth and I know the dish would taste 10 times better.

This recipe was disappointing and not worth all the chopping, I will not make it again.

I thought this was delicious and agree with the previous reviewer that the spiced tomato broth makes the dish. I lightly steamed the carrots and cauliflower instead of blanching them and left out the onions, radishes and mushrooms. I also used Rah-el-Hanout instead of garam masala, which gave it a more complex flavour as I find garam masala a bit overpowering sometimes. Loved the use of greens in the dish and was pleasantly suprised how well they roasted up. This will be a regular in my house this year.

The spiced tomato broth really makes this dish. I didn't blanch the baby carrots or the cauliflower. Though the cauliflower turned out tender and brown w/o blanching, the baby carrots were too crunchy. Also, I roasted the vegetables closer to 25 minutes to brown them. I only used 1 TB oil on the roasted vegetables and found that was enough. In the future I might reduce the amount of garam masala from 1 TB to 2 tsp. I served it with a dollup of drained plain yogurt. I will probably make this again, but with those tweaks.
