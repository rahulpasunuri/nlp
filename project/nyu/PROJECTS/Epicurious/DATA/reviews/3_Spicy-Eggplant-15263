This was pretty good-used the little purple/white eggplant from our local fresh market-loved the flavors-hubby wasnt terribly impressed but he is not an eggplant fan. I am, and this was good.

To the prior poster: The recipe reads "the cut sides", NOT "cut the sides."

i, too, love PF Chang's spicy eggplant! i hope this one tastes like it! one more thing: what does "brown cut the sides of the eggplant" mean?

My Korean boyfriend likes it! I added some cornstarch-coldwater mix at the very end to make the sauce thicker so that it would cling to the eggplant. I think garlic would add a lot of depth to the dish.

I was trying to duplicate a delicious dish from PF Chang's called, "spicy eggplant." TO make it more like so I added scallions and two cloves of garlic to the sauce. It added much more depth and flavor to the dish. My version was not only delicious, but also, less salty.

Kind of bland.
