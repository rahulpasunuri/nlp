Made twice - here are suggestions from second effort. Crust: added 1/3 c. more rice cereal and crust wasn't so hard. Used Gourmet 2004 chocolate cake and it was more moist and flavorful, but made taller layer so I made foil collar to hold up mousse. Spread Nutella on cake (crust side) before dropping on crust and it adhered MUCH better. Mousse: added 1 T. warm cream to 3 T. water and had no trouble with seizing chocolate. Sifted powdered sugar over paper doily to make pretty design. Finally, painted Nutella thinned with cream on plates to keep cake slices from sliding. Apologies for rating with alterations, but people loved this dessert!

Just made this cake. Ordered the best gianduja (5.5 pounds). All was going well until the mousse. The chocolate seized up and I ended up with chocolate chip mousse. I spread it on the cake anyway - looks more like a chocolate cloud than the flat layer in the picture, but fine. What do you do when the chocolate seizes up? It could not have been the quality of the chocolate, so it must have been something I did.

A rich, cool-looking cake with lots of hazelnut flavour. I would make it again. I made several substitutions... Cake: I didn't use clarified butter, used regular unsalted butter instead. My egg yolks were not whipped enough or didn't hold their volume, so cake turned out flat (1/4 inch high). I would substitute a more reliable chocolate cake recipe next time. Crust: used 4 oz. Nutella and 1 oz. good chocolate instead of gianduja (couldn't find it here). Worked very well! Mousse: fantastic! Substituted 8 oz. Nutella and 2 oz. good chocolate for gianduja.

I didn't end up with as much cake or crunch as shown in this photo. I think that next time I will double the crunch. It's good, but a lot of work. I also used Lindt chocolate on the crunch. I couldn't find Lindt without the hazelnuts already chopped in the chocolate, so I used a small bottle of Nutella hazelnut spread and incorporated that into the whipped cream. Worked great for the mousse.

Help! How finely should I chop the hazelnuts? Should I use the food processor to grind them or do it manually?

This was a major hit. The bottom crunchy layer tastes just like roeche (not sure I spelled that correctly) candies. I did find the cake a little dry and would bake it a little shorter time next year, but the Frangelica does soften it up a bit. Everyone loved the flavors.

This cake is a TOTAL FRIGGIN' pain in the wazoo to make, but TOTALLY worth it. You'll want to eat the whole thing yourself. The mousse is phenomenal. Use the best eggs you can get.

If you are a novice baker like myself, I would strongly recommend doing some research on how to properly make a genoise before diving into this recipe. That extra planning really prepared me before I started fumbling through the recipe. The rest was pretty straightforward, including mixing in the water into the melted chocolate. Again, some basic research can really go a long way if you are not already experienced.

absolutely AMAZING!!!! I brought this to a Christmas party and everyone LOVED it! for the decoration just top the whole cake with a medium coat of cocoa powder and then cut out a stencil to make the powdered sugar designs. It takes a bit of work but it is sooooo worth it, it turned out picture perfect I will definitely make it again.

I made this and it was wonderful!!! I substituted Grand Marnier for the Hazelnut liquer and it was a bit hit!!! I was literally chasing my boyfriend and his mother away from my mixing bowl. I'll be doing it for Thanksgiving this year for some chocolate lovers coming to dinner, I'm sure it'll win new fans.

I've made this cake two or three times. It seems quite complicated - but if you make it once, the second time is really easy. I thought this cake was SO good. It always gets rave reviews. The only thing I have a hard time with is making the powder sugar on top as cool as the picture, and gathering all of the proper ingredients.

I have made this cake several times, and have always loved it. Family members now request that I bring it to special gatherings. You definitely need to feel comfortable with baking, the gianduja is available at whole foods. so yummy!

I made this for Christmas dinner. Well, this was a last minute decision so I could not find the chocolate so, after desperately looking for a substitute, y opted for crushing a good brand of chocolate covered hazelnuts for the bottom layer and now, if you are very delicate about fine ingredients you may not want to continue reading...Nutella for the mousse portion of the recipe. I was so surprised at how FABULOUS this turned out! My family was actually licking the plate. I had problems getting it to stiffen but I put it in the freezer for a bit and perfect! Now the reviewer before me asked about the size of the pan. The reason why you'd bake on a 9 inch is so you can trim it so it looks nice. Usually the edges of the cakes are not perfect so the wider cake allows for you to trim it. That's all :)

Rating: 0
I hope to make the cake this week-end but I had a question. Why bake in a 9-in cake pan if you have to trim it down to 8-in? Couldn't you just bake it in an 8-in pan to begin with?

I thought this was a pretty cake and I loved the contrasting textures. The taste was very good, just not as rich as I had hoped. I picked up the brand of gianduja available at my local market--next time I will search for a high-end chocolate and hope it gives the flavor more depth. I had some trouble with the gianduja stiffening but it softened when I added a little cream. The genoise was the loveliest I've ever made and was not that difficult to prepare. The crunch layer was a big hit with my guests, and though it was a bit hard to cut, it really made the cake. A word to the wise: follow the recipe! Some dishes can handle a little experimentation but this one is too delicate to allow for substitutions.

I made this cake for a coworkers birthday and had a hard time finding gianduja chocolates so ended up ordering them online. The taste was good, but I had trouble with assembly and presentation.

Do not listen to the nay-sayers!!! This dish was an absolute hit. It might be a little time consuming, but not difficult at all. The crunch crust adheres best to the cake when just made. Use the gianduja, as recommended it's worth it. Everyone raved for weeks about this cake. I layed strawberries on top of the cake and sprinkled with powdered sugar and it complimented the rich chocolate wonderfully. And the cake definitely did not turn out too dry. It was actually very good.

The cake is not that hard to make. The only problems I had was the crunch layer - it didn't stick to the cake layer and it was hard to cut. Overall, if you eliminate the crunch layer, it was a very delicious cake.

Since I'm not using the hazelnut liqueur, I decided to substitute a different (moister) recipe for the cake layer. I used a half batch (one layer) of the chocolate cake in the February 2004 Gourmet--it has consistently been light and moist, and I thought it would go well with the mousse. For the mousse, I did not have any trouble with the chocolate seizing when I added the water (I used Callebaut gianduja). A quick stir brought it to uniform consistency. FYI, for readers living in metropolitan areas in Texas, Central Market carries gianduja chocolate.

I was nervous after I'd read all the previous reviews (a mixed bag, at best), but I'd already bought the chocolate specifically to try this recipe and since I'd wanted to try it since last year, I went ahead. Yes, it is time-consuming. I baked the genoise Christmas day and then got tired of cooking and so the cake sat for 2 days until I could get back to it. It stayed very moist, no problem. I had no problems with the other procedures in the recipe and the final result turned out beautifully. If you press the genoise down firmly right after spreading the crunch layer, it should adhere. The first piece may separate when you cut it, but the rest should be fine. The only problem I had was my pretty sugar snowflakes melted into the cocoa layer. Next time I'll order the non-melting powdered sugar from King Arthur. I thought it was an impressive dessert for a party and I hope my upscale grocery store carries the gianduja chocolate again next year! If not, it's definitely worth ordering ahead. The taste was wonderful. The mousse is very light and melts quickly (the chocolate itself is very high-quality and so melts quickly), so it absolutely can't be let to sit out on the counter during a warm party atmosphere, but otherwise, it's perfect!

I made this dish for Christmas lunch. There were several other cakes, squares and desserts - this cake disappeared. It seems more complicated to make than it really is. It is necessary to take your time. I made the crisp ahead of time and used a 9"springform pan for assembly. I followed the recipe as recommended and the mousse was great - adding the water firmed up the chocolate and the mousse was the right texture. I made extra crisp and cut it into shapes with cookie cutters to decorate with. totally wonderful - very rich dessert. Just right for the decadent Christmas feast

I have not made this cake, yet. Instead of trimming the cake down to 8 inches, wouldn't it be easier to use a 9 inch springform or an 8 inch cake pan. Why make this more difficult? Am I missing something?

This is one of the best desserts I've made, (and I make wedding cakes for kicks)it's phenomenal. I special order the chocolate, make a double recipe and freeze one. The cake is a foil for the mousse and crunchy bottom layer, I've gotten rave reviews whenever I've served it and often give it as a gift.

Anything this pretty is bound to be a little time consuming. However, this one was well worth the effort! The taste and textures were phenomenal--everyone wanted more! Spread it out over two days and it's not so bad.

I made this twice and both times it was a hit. I took one cake to work for a bithday and really impressed my co-workers. It was a bit intimidating at first but it turned out to be easier with each step and making it a second time was a breeze. I ordered the chocolate from where the magazine suggested and it worked great. I did use an 8.5 inch pan which made the bottom layer a bit thinner and easier to cut. Overall, I would make this cake again and again all the different textures really blended well.

Rating: 2
I loved the presentation but overall, I thought it was more trouble than it was worth. Nothing difficult but just a bit more time consuming than I was looking for in a cake. I cheated as I used Nutella and dark chocolate so I did not have the chocolate and assemly issues that other reviews commented on. Other than that substitution, I followed the recipe exactly as specified. I wasn't impressed by the cake but the rest I thought was good. I'm giving it 2 forks because I just didn't think the overall flavor and texture matched the time it took to make.

I can't believe the reviews of this recipe! All this carrying on about a simple genoise - you'd think it was an exotic dish rather than one of the most basic components of pastry making. These cakes are supposed to be a little dry - all the better to soak up the liqueur (I used about 4 tablespoons) and the moisture from the mousse. And yes, you always use clarified butter for genoise. I finally got around to trying this after the holiday rush was over. I liked the interplay of textures, though my bottom layer wasn't that hard - maybe because I used the right chocolate and chopped the nuts very finely. Also the chocolate didn't really sieze that much after adding the water - probably due to the high fat content of the Gianduja, which can be found on chocosphere.com. All in all, spreading the work out over two days, I thought it wasn't that involved and well worth the effort for a beautiful product. I will start offering this cake to my clients immediately.

Made this twice, both times with cake I made from a box (one of the pudding mixes) as I find them more moist. I've made genoise such as the one in the recipe before several times but find them a lot of work. Used milk chocolate for the mousse and crust. Rave reviews from all each time I made it. One group of 12 loved the crust and raved for 2 weeks! I had trouble with the mousse-worried about adding the water so didn't and then the chocolate did not incorporate well into the cream. The second time I made with a different chocolate mousse recipe that I've made maybe 20 times and never a flop. All 20 I served this to remarked that they loved the combination of textures from the crust to the mousse. I did not put cocoa powder on top-used a snowflake stencil with powdered sugar.

Rating: 2
I got great responses from those who ate this, but to me the crust was much too firm and crunchy to pair well with the mousse cake. Next time, I would make the crust out of chocolate wafers or chocolate sandwich cookies and butter and add ground hazelnuts to that.

Rating: 4
Okay - - enough of the whining. This is a great recipe but not for the novice. It requires some knowledge of how chocolate reacts to liquid, and how to time your work. For that reason, I think the recipe should have been written differently. The type of chocolate suggested is very difficult to find, even gourmet cooking stores don't carry it. For that reason, I chose to substitute Amaretto flavors for the hazelnut flavor. Still used the hazelnuts in the crust, but added Amaretto to the chocolate, and brushed it liberally onto the cake. Of course, the liquid Amaretto caused the chocolate to sieze, but that is fixed easily enough by stirring in vegetable shortening until smooth. For that reason, when I substituted Amaretto for the water in the mouse, I added the liquor to the cream prior to whipping. So no problem. As far as too time consuming - - it usually helps to read a recipe through prior to starting, and judging when you might take on each step, rather than trying to make it all at once. All in all it was a delicious cake, that everyone really enjoyed and was duly impressed with.

I'm not quite sure what all the negative to-do is regarding this delicious cake. I made it yesterday for a dinner party last night, and it was a big hit. Granted, I didn't follow the recipe to the letter (but if it had flopped I would have considered it my fault for straying, and wouldn't be complaining about it here). The genoise has always been a particular bugaboo of mine, so I would recommend to those that are interested in baking this cake to check in on the wisdom of Flo Braker or Rose Beranbaum, among others, for guidance. The cake, in fact, worked so well, that after trimming the top and bottom, I divided it in half, horizontally, and added a layer of mousse in between. I didn't order gianduia milk chocolate in advance; rather, I used some hazelnut milk chocolate on hand, but I wasn't sure if the water called for in the mousse might have disastrous results, so I omitted it with no apparent harm done. I also opted not to use the rice krispies in the hazelnut crunch; just a personal preference. The finished cake set up more quickly than the overnight time suggested, btw (in fact, the whole thing took less time than I thought, having read the various reviews). Just before serving I spread the whole thing with slightly sweetened whipped cream over which I dusted cocoa powder, and it looked and tasted great.

Rating: 2
Although the cover recipe was gorgeous, it too far too much time and was overly involved for the results. The crust was too hard and the center, although edible, was not wonderful. I shouldn't have tried it when I was making the full other courses for Christmas dinner. It would have been better as a single item, but still too much work.

Rating: 1
The mousse was the best part of this recipe. The mid-cake layer was good-not great, and the bottom layer was far too hard, making it near impossible to tame as you chased it all over the plate.All in all, I would save my time and resources elsewhere, as there are other exceptional recipes to be found in the Epicurious archives.

we embarked on this adventure without realizing how much work it would be. our results were mixed. the mousse turned out really well and we loved the crust, but the middle section didn't turn out well at all. the texture was odd - like squishy rubber foam. we ate around that section. i wouldn't make it again - it's too much work for questionable results.

A beautiful and fabulous Christmas dessert! I appreciated reading the previous reviews. I baked the cake a few minutes less than the recipe called for and before brushing on the Frangelico, I poked the cake with a fork to allow the Frangelico to penetrate the cake (the cake was not at all dry). The chocolate also stiffened on me when I slowly added the water (I only used 1 Tbs. of water), however as soon as I added the whipped cream it became manageable again. I took out the cake from the refrigerator and let it set at room temperature for a few minutes before serving. A sharp knife helped with the crust but it was not really a problem. The combination of the three layers worked perfectly for me and the flavors and textures were great. I definitely plan to make this again for a special occasion!

Rating: 2
First of all, I thought making the cake was a LOT of fun. I had to buy some new cake pans as I seemed to have all the wrong sizes. The crunch layer was a problem. I took this to a buffet, and when I went to get a slice for myself, I found no one had cut through the bottom layer. After finally cutting thorough, I found the bottom layer difficult to eat. Kind of flew around when trying to cut a bite with a fork. The rest of the cake and mousse were pretty good. IF I make it again, I want to come up with a different bottom layer

Rating: 2
I also had problems with the cake not adhering to the crunch layer so the second time I made it I spread a thin layer of Nutella between the two and it worked like a charm. Although it was stunning to look at I was dissapointed that the taste was somewhat unsophisticated considering the labor intensity and expense. I would not make this again for myself but have had several request from friends.

I like to make the December cover dessert recipe for my staff Christmas dinner each year. Everybody looks forward to it! This recipe was fun to make because it did call for quite a few steps. The result looked like the cover (yeah!) and it tasted good but not great. Early reviews were available when I made this and so I decided to use half the hazelnut-rice crispy crunch for the crust and the other half, I chilled and broke into pieces to scatter on the presentation. My cake did not adhere to the crunch layer very well and the crunch layer was hard to cut (a warm knife helped.) The flavor was wonderful and there were few slices left over. I would make this again if I have the time (I made mine over the course of 2 days) and I would likely incorporate more hazelnuts into the cake rather than as a separate layer.

To simplify this recipe I also used a box cake, but to make it even more simple I substituted coco puffs for the crunch and Jello Pudding for the mousse. It turned out awful. I wonder why?

My brother made this cake for Christmas. It was equivalent, if not better, than desserts from four star restaurants in NYC and Philly. Absolutely fabulous, sinful, decadent, delicious. I could go on. He did say there were many steps, and it was time consuming. But oh my gosh, worth every bite.

This recipe was a flop! The cake was extremely time consuming and after it was said and done, it wasn't very moist. The mousse was the only saving grace of this dessert. I was so disapointed that so much effort resulted in something that was not worth the calories.

I loved this recipe as well. To simplify I used a box chocolate cake mix. I find box cake mixes are the only way to get a moist cake. I also didn't cut down the size of the cake. The mousse was my favorite part and I was dipping apples in the leftover mousse to ease the guilt of licking the bowl!

This cake was awesome! I am not sure what is wrong with some of the previous reviewers, but this is a very easy cake - it just has alot of steps. Also, nothing wrong w/ adding rice krispies to the expensive chocolate. It made such a delicious chocolate crust. With regard to the difficulting in cutting the cake, I found the secret to be if you rock the knife down towards you as you cut, it works well. If you try and cut it all at once, it breaks thru too quickly and crashes down on the plate. I also experienced the chocolate getting a weird consistancy when the water was added, but once you added the whipped cream, there was no problem. I hope others out there ignore the other reviewers and try this cake for themselves.

I made this for Christmas and don't know why so many people are reviewing this poorly because it was simply DIVINE! Everyone LOVED it and raved. I told everyone at my dinner table about the reviews here as they are epicurious fans, and they couldn't believe it because flavor and presentation were AWESOME! The cake is no harder to make than most recipes in Bon Appetit or Gourmet. I made the cake Thursday (12/23), and the crunch and mousse on Saturday (12/25). Not hard at all. I did undercook the cake by 5 minutes, but I always check the cake a few minutes before the recipe says it'll be done. If you want a beautiful cake with wonderful, unique textures and flavors, make this cake!!!

I loved the mousse and thought the crunch was a nice texture change but for all of the effort the cake took with the sifting, sifting and more sifting--it was not worth it. The mousse alone would make a great dessert.

I made this dessert over the course of 2 days; it was worth every ounce of effort. My finished product looked exactly like the cover of Bon Appetit and tasted divine. The cake part was not dry, the bottom part was crunchy, but not so much that it detracted from the dessert. I followed the directions to a "T" and they worked perfectly. I will definitely make it again for another dinner party.

I agree with other readers. The crunch layer was very hard and difficult to eat. The cake layer was dry. I have been baking desserts for thirty years and think I know what I am doing. I followed this recipe to the letter and it was disgusting. My husband who will eat anything that has chocolate in it, hated this dessert. Very disappointing.

I did not think this cake was worth the effort. The bottom layer was hard as a rock and impossible to cut through, the middle cake layer was nothing special and the mousse layer was way too sweet for my taste.

But, I would not make this again.

This was one of the most beautiful cakes I have ever made. I was so proud of how well it turned out. However with only one bite, all my pride disappeared. I was actually embarrassed to have brought it to a potluck dinner! I couldn't believe how awful it tasted! Trying to serve it was disastrous, because the crust was very hard to cut through. The cake was dry, and even the mousse was dry! If you choose to ignore the negative ratings for this recipe and bake it anyway, do the following: slightly underbake the cake or consider adding more liquid on top of the genoise, and make absolutely positively sure that you do not overbeat the whipped cream. Even if I hadn't overbeaten the cream (which I must have), I still don't know how this could have tasted good. I have subscribed to Bon Appetit for 10 years, and this is by far the most disappointing (and embarrassing) recipe I have ever made...

This recipe was an enormous hit with family and friends. I made it with dark chocolate hazelnut bars. I couldn't get the chocolate recommended in the recipe, so I bought regular imported dark chocolate hazelnut bars and ground them in the food processor before melting the chocolate so that it would be smooth. It worked great. My cake looked exactly like the picture and tasted wonderful. I originally made it for Thanksgiving and have since made it for a luncheon I gave. Now my son has requested that I make it again for Christmas. It is labor intensive, but worth it. I also used the cut off cake for chocolate parfaits with homemade whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Also a big hit.

Despite the varied reviews, I went ahead and made it anyway and I am glad I did. I thought it was very good and I am very picky when it comes to desserts!! It really isn't as hard has it seems, just needs some time to prepare it. I did use a 9 inch spring form instead of the 8 inch and it worked well. Didn't had the water to the mousse because of the reviews on that part, but everything else was done as written. Yummy!

This cake was very impressive. I did subsitute milk chocolate with hazelnuts (chopped the nuts), it was quite delicious. The powdered sugar on top was pretty, but not worth the time, better effect by drizzeling chocolate on the plate with each slice.

this is the most vile and disgusting recipe i've ever tried and i'm disappointed that it actually made the cover of the magazine. the only place i could find the chocolate was online, for the tune of $30 plus shipping. then i realized after spending that much for the chocolate, the recipe called for "rice krispies"!! i don't think so, not to put with $30 worth of chocolate. adding water to melted chocolate causes a diaster and any idiot that has walked into a kitchen knows that. in all, a horrible recipe that i wouldn't give even half a fork to and definitely will never make again. i would also never recommend it to someone. those of you who gave it more than 1 fork had to of made serious modifications, and there are much better recipes out there. save your time and ingredients...

I had high hopes for this cake. The crunch part was an odd texture and actually took away from the rest of the cake. The genoise was bland with no real taste. The mousse was presumably the best part with the exception of the preparation which changed the texture. Adding water to the chocolate prior to folding into the whipped cream caused the chocolate to seize. I had to beat the mousse for several minutes in order to incorporate the chocolate. As a result the mousse because very stiff and crumbled when sliced. Conceptually it's a good idea, but if I try this again, it will be with a chocolate butter cake and a modified chocolate mousse. I would also skip the cocoa and just use powdered sugar for the finish.

Rating: 3
After much searching I was able to find the chocolate at an Italian grocery store (AG Ferrari). I doused the cake layer with a Frangelico simple syrup as one might do to a genoise cake. I though it turned out pretty good (I'm my own worst critic). I may make some small changes next time, like cooking the cake a little less and not overwhipping the cream in the mousse.

Rating: 1
I had high hopes for this, but alas, the picture looks much better than it tastes. First of all, I never heard of clarifying butter for a cake. I thought clarifying was done in order for the butter not to burn when you fry in it. Definitely no fried cake, so i skipped this step. I also decided if the thing was to be baked in a nine ince pan, why cut it down afterwards to fit an 8 inch pan? THis recipe definitely has toooo much 'potchkying' in it. So, I made and served it as a nine inch cake. THe cake part was definitely too dry, and the whipped cream toppping was not much more than whipped cream, ie not enough character on it's own. The chocolate rice kripie bottom was interesting, but I would scrap the rest. Definitely not worth doing again. Definitely far better alternatives on this web site. And mind, I think this is the first recipe I have ever given one fork.

It is a great balance of textures. I made it twice. The second time I put chocolate shavings on top instead of the dramatic design (I'm not talented enough to pull that off and it got everyone covered in cocoa powder the first time I made it). It isn't hard, but make it over 2 days and it is easier. I couldn't find the chocolate, so I used chocolate hazelnut from the grocery store mixed with nutella. Can't go wrong with nutella in my book. I'm making just the bottom layer for guests over Christmas as it was everyone's favorite part when I made it last time. If you need something impressive and have a bit of advance cooking time, this is a great recipe!

Excellent combination of light textured moist cake, airy but rich mousse and crunch. The directions sound complicated but it's actually a very easy recipe. Very impressive results for the effort. I'd happily make this again and again. I baked the cake for 2 minutes less than called for.

I agree that the cake layer is the element of this recipe that is not worth the effort. I found it too light and dry to compliment the mouse and crunch layers. I will use another cake recipe and see how that fares. Adding the water did "gum up" my chocolate as well but after stirring and smoothing it out with a spatula I managed to get a nice smooth consistency. I did, however, overbeat the whip cream a bit too much so the mouse was too stiff to present nicely. Even after all of that I still got good reviews- so I'll try again with modifications forementioned above.

I would make this cake again, with modifications: I didn't like the cake layer, and would use an easier, moister chocolate cake from this site. The mousse was sublime, and I liked the crunch layer, but the three didn't quite come together for me. Perhaps with a different cake layer it would. Finally, it looked nothing like the picture, but I did use a larger springform, so it didn't stand as tall. Good, but not worth the effort.

This cake was absolutely wonderful. I made it for a client who told me it was a keeper. I unfortunaly live where I was not able to get gianduja so I did a little improvising and used some milk chocolate with hazelnuts in it and used the food processor to chop it up. I think it turned out great.I also think you could mix nutella and milk chocolate together to make the mousse. There is a chocolate hazelnut mousse tart on this web site. Yummy!

Brought this to a party last night and it was DELICIOUS! Water was absolutely necessary to make mousse. Crust was hard to cut through but well worth it.

I agree that it is a bit time consuming, but well worth the effort. Adding the water to the chocolate worked very well for me and I think it's imperative in order to create the perfect mousse consistency. Yes the crust was a bit tricky cutting it and if I make it again I will look for another way to combine the ingredients, but perhaps in different proportions.
