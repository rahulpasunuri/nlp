Perfect ending is right!! Even proclaimed non-dessert eaters loved it. I am just back from an Italian vacation where I ate a lot of granita. It is a perfect make-ahead light summer dessert. I used a good Cava thought the macerated berries with the Grand Marnier dressed it up a bit.

Fantastic and easy. Appeals to everyone. Light and perfect for summer. Have made the non-alcoholic version with sprite... it freezes much faster without alcohol so keep that in mind and scrape more frequently. Stores in the freezer forever. Made a big pan and my boyfriend picks at it for days.

So refreshing! Everyone wanted the recipe. Served on a hot July night at my wine pairing party. It was a great pallate cleanser in between courses, I didn't alter this recipe a bit! No need!

I served this over the Memorial Day weekend and got rave reviews. I can't even imagine trying to improve upon it. Refreshing, light, and oh the mix of flavors. Very intense and juicy. I would definitely keep the Grand Marnier...just adds to the flavor complexity.

This is a great summer desert, with little effort involved. The strawberry is great, but liked using raspberries even more. Used frozen raspberries for the granita, and strained once all liquids were combined. Used fresh berries for the bottom of the glass though, with not as much grand mariner. I used a good champagne ($12 at Trader Joes), not an outstanding one, and the fresh grapefruit juice is a must. Very refreshing.

I have made this twice and both times my dinner companions have raved about how refreshing and satisfying this dessert is after a summer meal. I'm making it again tomorrow.

Delicious and Refreshing! I used orange blood juice in place of grapefruit. It was great! Of course, use a good quality champagne and you don't need the grand marnier either.
