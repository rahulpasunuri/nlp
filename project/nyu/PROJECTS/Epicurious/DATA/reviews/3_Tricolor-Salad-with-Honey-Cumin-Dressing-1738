The rating surprised me. I've made this several times as a holiday salad, always to rave reviews from my seriously foodie friends!

I make this salad all the time for parties & it's always a big hit. I've been asked for the recipe countless times. The combination of flavors is unique and delicious.

My family did not like the dressing. They guessed the chili powder immediately. Could use possibly 2 cans of drained mandarin oranges instead. I personally found it a nice change and very colorful.
