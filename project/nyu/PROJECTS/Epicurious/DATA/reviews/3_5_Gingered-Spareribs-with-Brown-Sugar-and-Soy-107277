WOW really good, easy dish that everyone loved. Added a little bit of Teriyaki sauce for added zing

This is a fantastic recipe especially when you don't have multiple hours to prepare your spareribs. I made it last night and to enhance the meal, I also added in 2 green bell peppers to the dish as it was cooking. I also used brown rice to make it a little more healthy. Serving it with steamed broccoli and slices of fresh tomatoes and a Syrah wine, made it all just perfect for my guests who really enjoyed it.

Very nice flavor. Made with chicken since we don't eat pork.

So much easier than the baked kind. I used country style (thicker) ribs and just over a half cup of vinegar to please my beloved and it was very good. I thickened the sauce at the end with 3 Tbs cornstarch (again to please The Other) and it is now our favorite pork dish. I've made it twice now and will keep it in the rotation.

Fast and easy! Everyone loved it. I substituted 1/4 cup of maple syrup for the brown sugar and it was still very sweet!

Great! Love this recipe. Will definitely make it again.

This is an outstanding recipe! The sauce was a little thin, but that is easily fixed with corn starch. My family ate these leftovers for a week running and it was as good the last day as it was the first.

I've made this twice, once with rice vinegar and once with cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand and both times it was yummy! Do try and ditch some of the first round oil, though, or your sauce will be congealed and weird with pools of oils all over the place. Not appetizing. My sauce actually was too thick both times, so I thinned it w/a little orange juice. Added a nice zing!

Wonderful recipe! Following some other cook's ideas, I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. In addition, I substituted 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar for 1/4 cup of rice vinegar. It added a nice zing.

so simple and delicious. Made it for my family, and they all hoovered it (including a 6 year old and a picky 9 year old). It is a natural for a dinner party buffet. Takes no time.

If I could give a half fork addition I would! This recipe is so quick and stunningly delish...I tend to like a little heat in my dishes, so I add cayenne or whatever chilies I have on hand, but it is stead-fast as is. I like to serve it with coconut cilantro rice and siced mango. If you are having problems with your sauce being too liquidy simply add more cornstarch and it will amend the problem.

this is fantastic. I would double the sauce though with a little bit more garlic and ginger. It is great over rice.

I took the advice of another reviewer and browned these ribs first in canola oil, then transferred them to a slow cooker with the remaining ingrediets (minus the cornstarch) over top. These came out AMAZING with meat falling off the bone and a terrific flavor in the sauce. Once the ribs were finished cooking, I poured the sauce into a pan with a bit of cornstarch and reduced it. A thicker sauce resulted that was then poured over top the ribs. Delicious!

These ribs are so tangy! I had no problems with thickening the sauce like some of the other reviewers. Mine turned out deliciously finger-licking good with a nice thick sauce for the rice!

Oh my gosh -- these were finger-licking good! Made them in my slow cooker - browned the ribs then threw all the ingredients in the cooker and cooked 8 hours on low. Removed the ribs, defatted the sauce and poured it into a saucepan. Reduced it to about half or three-quarters and then added the thickener (2 tsp cornstarch with 2 tb water). We just couldn't get enough of these ribs - juicy, tender, sweet and sour at the same time. Can't wait to make them again.

Some tips for a too thin sauce turnout: Remove the ribs after the 45 minutes from the pan. Try to remove most of the oil, then turn the burner on high to reduce the sauce to a syrupy consistency. When you drag your spoon through the sauce, a clean line should follow. Once you achieve the correct consistency, return the ribs to the pot and stir to coat. I do this in batches. I also use baby back ribs which turn out superb. Every time I make these for parties, I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The extra steps are well worth it. I do not use the cornstarch. My kids love them - they turn up their noses to everything.

The recipe was easy to follow. The fresh ginger really adds to the flavor. We added this to our recipe book.

These are easy and tasty. I've made them a number of times and they are always a hit.

The best ribs I ever had and very easy to make.

We made with country style ribs. Not a keeper in our book. Sauce texture was not correct. Flavor was ok but not great.

I made this recipe for friend of mine. They loved it!! They were still commenting on it two weeks later. The meat was tender and juicy. I'm new to cooking and found this to be a fairly easy recipe to make after a day at work.

These were pretty good and relatively easy to put together. I got the ribs on sale and wasn't sure what to do with them without the advantage of my grill. I found this recipe and happened to have all ingredients on hand. The ribs were tender and fell off the bone. I think the key to this is choosing ribs that look like they are pretty meaty. I have made the mistake in the past and wound up with tough, grisly and unsatisfying results, no matter the recipe. With this one, make sure you have plenty of napkins! It's messy, but good.

I was not that excited about the spareribs. I did brown them and actually followed the recipe religiously, but my ribs were sort of tough. Also, the sauce (which definitely needed the cornstarch slurry as it was very thin) was so greasy that it just was not that appealing.

This was one of the best Asian style ribs I have ever tasted. I have made this about three times since the recipe came out. Its a little messy on the stove though. One time I tried to brown them on a little lower heat to save some mess but the sauce never thickened up. Brown them as the recipe indicates and they will be great. Also good the next day. I think it would make a good appetizer using baby back ribs.

These were very yummy. I used country style ribs, and they were extremely tender after the long cooking time. I must say, however, that the ribs I made didn't look like the ribs in the picture. The sauce never really thickened (even though I used the cornstarch), and the meat didn't hold the sauce like I thought it would. Maybe next time I will finish the ribs in the oven. I must say also that these were even better the next day--definitely a do-ahead recipie.
