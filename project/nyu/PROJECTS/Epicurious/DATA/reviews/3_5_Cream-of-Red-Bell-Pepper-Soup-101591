This was a great soup if you have a bunch of peppers to use up. I substituted a few items based on what I had in the house. Onions, chicken stock, dried thyme and white wine vinegar. I used 1% milk to lighten it up and it was plenty creamy for me with lovely subtle flavours.

This was soooooo gooood!! Although I have to admit I added some roasted tomatoes I had in the fridge and added those in as well, so I ended up with about 5 peppers and 6 roma tomatoes. Maybe I didn't have 2.5 lbs of peppers or something because it only made about 3 bowls of soup. I will be adding this into the rotation for sure!

I didn't have the ability to char the peppers and remove the skins, so I just cooked all the peppers in the broth. I then used the stick/immersion blender, and the soup came out great.

absolutely delicious. I would probably use chicken stock if not serving vegetarians. I made a golden/yellow bell pepper soup at the same time using the smae method, and served the red first, with a ladel of golden in the middle -- so pretty, and with wonderfully complementary flavours

I had 4 largish yellow bell peppers to use up that were just a bit shy of the 2 1/2 lbs required, so I also used some jarred roasted red peppers to make up the difference. I followed the recipe exactly. This was outstanding! I truly didn't expect to love it as much as I did as I couldn't quite get my head wrapped around a bell pepper soup. This will definitely go into my soup rotation.

So delicious! I made as written but I had to use lite cream because the market had no half and half. This was OK with me because the creamier the better! I used a stick blender right in the pot to blend everything together instead of a traditional blender, stick blender is much easier- I recommend everyone who doesn't have one to get one!! After tasting the finished result,I added just a touch more cream to the pot than the recipe said for extra creaminess. I used the recommended garnish, I sliced some basil leaves then cut them on the diagonal to make little diamond shapes, then I sprinkled them inside the center of each bowl leaving a ring of pure red soup visible around the perimeter of the bowl. Then I drizzled some cream in the form of a circle over the top of the basil. Then I lay two thin slices of roasted pepper criss cross in the center of the bowl on top of the basil and cream. This made for a beautiful and colourful presentation, very elegant served in a white bowl. When my husband tasted it he said the flavor reminded him of stuffed peppers and he voted this recipe as a keeper, as do I! I served fried flattened crispy plantains on the side next to the soup bowl. We had the soup and plantains as a main course for the two of us.

This is a outstanding recipe. The one tip that I would give is that having used both the fresh peppers and roasting them and a jar of roated peppers there is not much different. However make sure that you use a trusted brand of jar of peppers.

I had fewer peppers than called for but tried to adjust ingredients accordingly. Prepared it pretty much as written. It was quite good.

Roasting and peeling the peppers made it take more like 2 hours. I added some heavy cream because the 1/2 cup half & half wasn't quite creamy enough for me. I also added croutons I made out of a garlic sourdough loaf. It would probably be good with some asiago, romano, or feta on top.

I found this recipe to be decent, but nothing to write home about. I liked it with the basil, so if I make it again, I'll cut up more basil and serve it on the side. Also at that amount, the cayenne seemed to be either too much or too little. If you want it to be spicy, add more.

Rating: 2
I tasted this soup before I added the cream and thought it was delicious. I didn't add thyme, but did add s&p. The soup had a deep and complex flavor, and I thought it was so good. Then I added the vinegar, cream and cayenne and I thought it killed the texture of the soup. I'll definitely make this soup again, but only the first half of the recipe. (I'll probably still add a little cayenne.)

Peeling and seeding the peppers can be a pain, but when they are sale, it is a must recipe to make. I add more red pepper to taste, so it definitely has a spicey kick when I am done.

I think this is a great soup. I've made it many times and always to rave reviews.

The "something missing" from this recipe is three fold: some salt, croutons, and grated cheese. The salt takes care of the blandness; the croutons the consistensy; and the cheese will melt in the soup to add to the creamy flavor.

Rating: 2
This was good, but not memorable or something that I would make again. Roasting the peppers and peeling them is more time consuming than the 45 min. that the recipe claims. I made this for three male friends from different regions of the states and they all said that it was good, but needed "something". I do not know what that something is so this recipe will be retired.

Lovely and delicious. Have made it as written and its great, but this time around I threw in 2 small sun dried tomatoes for color and some added flavor, and, because I had forgotten to buy half/half, I used some leftover coconut milk. It added a delicate sweetness that was very nice. Even my 16 month old devoured it.

Flavor was great. I substituted the half and half with tofu. Just blended some soup and tofu together and added it the batch. I also used Sherry instead of vinegar. We enjoyed this low fat version a lot.

Delightful! I used mostly orange bell peppers with a couple of red peppers. I also strained the soup as I was having guests for dinner and a velvety soup is so wonderful. Just before serving I swirled in about 1 tbsp of butter.

I have already made this soup 2 times in a week. The first time I roasted the pepper which I found to be a lot of work! So the second time I just microwave the peppers to soften them, then I chopped them with the skin and I did what the recipe said. The only difference was after I purée the soup, I filtered out the bell pepper skin (using a drainer) before I put it back to the pot. It tastes almost the same, maybe better! I am really happy with my lazy, delicious way of cooking.

Both myself and my husband love this soup. A tip for making the peppers... cut them in half lenthwise, clean out the stem and seeds and make small cuts in the curved edges. Place on a LINED cookie sheet and into the broiler. As the peppers blacken, smash them flat gently with the back of a fork (that's why I make small slits in the curves, they lay down better) They will blacken more evenly once slightly smashed. Once most of the pepper is blackened, fork them into a heavy weight plastic shopping bag, twist the opening to seal off the escaping heat and let sit. In about 15 minutes the pepper is cool enough to handle and the skin should come right off. Although you can do the peeling over the sink, don't rinse the skinned pepper in water, you'll wash off the good juices. Now you are ready for the rest of the recipe. P.S. I make roasted peppers frequently, there are delicious in a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a little sugar!!!

Rating: 3
The soup is nicely rich tasting (without too much fat). I had 4 huge red bell peppers, cut them in half length ways and seeded them. I then flattened the halves with the palm of my hands, placed on a roasting pan & broiled to blacken the outer skins (took me about 30 mins). After cooling in a glass bowl with plastic wrap, I removed the skins and followed the recipe (with the added juices from the peppers). It's still a lot of work for a soup so I'd double it up (or freeze the peppers as per a previous cook). Made a nice Valentine lunch with a squeeze of sour cream in the shape of a heart.

I am NOT a red pepper fan and I just LOVED this soup. We made it to start our Thanksgiving meal this year, and it was very comparable to a spicy, rich, creamy tomato soup.

Everyone I have ever made this for loves it. Although I made A LOT of it once and in my efforts to stretch it, I made it kind of weak. I was out of time and used jarred roasted red peppers that i purchased at the Italian market. It was OK, but roasting the peppers yourself seems to make a big difference. The ones in the jar were a little bitter.

This dish was simply intoxicating!!! It did take me more than 45 minutes...closer to an hour. I believe the recipe makers forgot to consider the sometimes tedious work of peeling peppers (it added about 15 minutes, and I consider myself fairly experienced at the task). If you want to cut down on time, simmering can be reduced to 10 minutes. Also, I chose to use skim milk instead of half and half for diet considerations; the flavor was still excellent. The red wine vinegar adds a distinctive kick.

Definitely a good soup and my family liked very much, however, as many other reviewers said, it was very time consuming. Roasting wasn't nearly as tedious as trying to remove the seeds. Maybe there's a reason, but why couldn't the seed bulb be removed from the top of the pepper before roasting? My husband agreed that although the soup was good, it wasn't good enough to through all the work.

I gave it a 2-fork rating because the soup had a sour taste even before I added the red wine vinegar. Perhaps that was due to my using commercial mushroom broth instead of veggie or chicken stock. I had to modify it by making a roux of flour, butter and leeks, then some milk, and that rounded out the flavour. In fact it tasted pretty good after that! I"d make it again, with my modifications. And I'd omit the vinegar (I've noticed that most other recipes don't call for it).

I made this soup for Valentine's Day in honor of my boyfriend's love of red peppers and it was a great first course--full of flavor and velvety rich! Half veg. broth and half chicken stock adds to the flavor. I added about a quarter cup additional chicken broth when rewarming and soup was still nicely thick. It held the garnish--dollop of sour cream plus the pepper strip and basil--with no problem. I'll definitely make this again and again.

I made a similar recipe to this from another book without the half and half. That recipe also used red pepper flakes rather than cayenne pepper. I absolutely love the rich bodied flavor from the roasted red peppers, and so do my picky-eater family members. I swirl sour cream into my bowl at the table. One thing you could do for those who don't like spicy foods is to omit the pepper and offer it at the table so those who do like it spicy can add as much or as little pepper as they like. I would use cream in this recipe rather than half and half - just my preference.

I made this for a party that I catered, and was a bit leery about using my guests as gunea pigs, but I was happy with the results as were my clients. The recipe produced a velvety texture and a well rounded taste, with a hint of "attitude" at the end as a result of the cayenne pepper. I too used a half and half mix of vegetable and chicken broth(low salt). Though labor intensive, I would make it again. I tried a strip of pepper and a dollop of sour cream as the recipe suggests, but the body of the soup was not thick enough to hold them on top, so I substituted julliened basil, which worked quite well. This would probably be equally good served cold.

My family loves roasted red bell peppers, so we buy, roast and freeze red peppers when they are on sale. For us, this recipe involves pulling frozen peppers out of the freezer, which cuts down considerably on prep. This is a crowd pleaser - have given this recipe to boss's wife and will be on our New Years Eve menu - great way to see in new millenium! Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper to taste - some like it hotter than others, and a dollop of sour cream is also great addition.
