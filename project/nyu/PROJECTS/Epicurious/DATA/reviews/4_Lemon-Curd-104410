Loved it. Definitely better than some lemon curds that take an hour. I use this with Epicurious' open faced blueberry pie. So yummy.

Took longer than recipe indicated but lovely - very tart and lemony

This was my first time making lemon curd correctly. It definately took me longer to cook, more like 20 - 25 minutes, but it was worth the effort. It was so yummy and tangy. I made this to go on the Lemon Swirl Cheesecake (also found on this site), and it was the perfect topper. I have some leftover and I can't wait to put some strawberries with it.

Exquisite. Best lemon curd I've ever tasted. I used fresh Tahitian limes from my tree instead. No need to strain. Used the pulp as well which I processed fine in a blender and added to the juice. Quadrupled the recipe to make a total of 3 cups (lime pulp & uice combined). 10-12 mins whisking and you're done. Friends are asking for more and wanting to buy some!

Sublime lemon curd! As stated by other reviewers, it takes quite a bit longer than 6 minutes if you do it on very low heat. I used this method and I didn't even have to strain the curd, as you sometimes have to do. It is smooth, slightly tart and delicious. Also, I have tried this with about 2-3 tablespoons less than the recipe calls for and it still turns out wonderfully.

This was a pretty good recipe. Not may favorite Lemon Curd, but good. It definitely took longer than 6 minutes. I was using pretty low heat and a heavy pan (all-clad). It began to thicken at about 8 minutes & took another 8 minutes to get to the thick consistancy I wanted. I used leftovers to make a lemon ice cream - slightly tart, and very yummy.

Very easy. Mis-read the recipe and still it turns out so good. Will do it again.

Solid recipe. I used Meyer lemons, cooked for 13 minutes, passed the cooked curd through a chinois making the texture so smooth, and served with shortbread, I mean come on, does it get any better than this???

After cooking over low-med for 20 minutes, I too added a tbsp of cornstarch (w/ juice)to help thicken. I tastes great! Using w/ lemon cake and fresh berries.

Why is someone lazy because they use cornstarch instsead of flour? What about people that are unable to use flour in recipes because of allergies to the gluten, are they lazy? That was not a fair statement.

Yum! Side note: I'm growing rather tired of raters berating other raters for their approach to a recipe. If San Francisco wants to add cornstarch, who cares? If you don't agree San Antonio del Mar, don't do it. No need for name calling.

Only lazy cooks add cornstarch to lemon curd and it ruins the consistency. If you're wisking this in a heavy saucepan it only takes about 10 minutes on medium low heat.

To me, this recipe is best when served with the powdered sugar pound cake. I, too, found the cooking time too short and it is SOOO tart, but excellent. I make it often as an accompaniment to something sweet and cake-y for contrast.

I thought this was lovely, a rather typical lemon curd I think, but very nice. I added an extra teaspoon of zest and another 1/4 cup of lemon juice, and found the cooking time and temperature to be too short/low. I cooked for about 12 minutes on medium, then added about 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a little lemon juice towards the end to help it thicken up.
