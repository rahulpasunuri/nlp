Mixed with coarse kosher salt and a bit of allspice, this makes a phenomenal pot roast rub!

It's also fabulous in homemade sausages with fresh thyme & lots of garlic.

What a nice tang this added to the chutney! I included extra nutmeg and cinnamon and a touch of allspice. Have to find other uses for it now! Maybe in a dark chocolate cookie recipe that calls for pepper?
