This is definitely an interesting recipe. At first taste I didn't think I was going to like it, however, it was addicting and despite my doubt I kept tasting it. Overall, I liked it a lot and am about to make it again.

I would never make this again. I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband had to choke it down (because I threatened him). My mom, a huge fan of my cooking, had to side with him, and I myself couldn't stand it. Too thickly creamy in texture--but not a good creamy, like an asparagus veloute might be. All flavor of avocado is lost, leaving you tasting slightly of sour cream and strongly of mystery. Since the smoked salmon didn't add enough texture, out of desperation I even sauteed a mirepoix just to have something in there with some flavor and bite. No luck. My audience tried it both ways, still thumbs down. I'd like to try a good avocado soup recipe.

I doubled the hot sauce and added some black pepper for a little kick. Although this is definitely creamy, it was very tasty and my friends and I liked it a lot,

I made this for my in-laws as it sounded so delicious. we were all fairly disappointed as it turned out way too creamy - so smooth that even top notch salmon couldn't cut it. Waste of great ingredients, in future I'll stick with my husband's great avocado soup recipe!
