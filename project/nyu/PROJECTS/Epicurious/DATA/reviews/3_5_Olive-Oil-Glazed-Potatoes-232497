I'm surprised this has gotten such good reviews. It seemed totally bland and flavorless to me. Thank god we had some gravy handy.

This is so simple and tasted so good. I love it. I used yukon gold potatoes because that's all I had. I can't wait to make this again.

This was good but next time I will triple the garlic and add more olive oil. A sprinkle of high quality sea salt just before serving gave the potatoes a bit of pop. I also think adding some fresh parsley would be nice.

Surprisingly good and simple. The liquid did not get completely absorbed, but it turned out ok nonetheless. I added 1/2 tsp of granulated chicken broth instead of salt for extra flavor, and served with a small slice of herb goat cheese. Yum! A keeper!

Definitely a keeper. I agree with the other comment about not peeling the potatoes. Don't think it needed much salt though - the potatoes had a nice flavor on their own.

This was plain, but had a yummy flavor. It was super easy to make, great for a quick potato recipe!

I thought this recipe was very good and tasty. And I thought it looked good. The trick - I NEVER EVER peel potatoes - not in this dish and not in any other dish. It looked fine, was delicious and easy to make quickly on the stovetop while the main course cooked in the oven. A definite keeper!!

This is a delicious accompaniment to grilled or roasted meats. If the water isn't all evaporated by the time the potatoes are tender, simply boil it off uncovered, at high heat. And don't forget that potatoes require quite a bit of salt.

I agree with the less than impressive 'look' so the next time I changed things slightly. I only used one tbsp. of oil in the skillet. When the potatoes were done, I drizzled the remaining tbsp of oil, to which I had added chopped fresh parsley and another time, fresh chopped dill...then they did have a glazed and scrumptious, 'I fussed a little' look.

These potatoes don't look very impressive, but they are so easy and very tasty. They will become a regular side in my house.
