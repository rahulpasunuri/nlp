I was looking for a complimentary sauce to go with venison tenderloin I had already marinated overnight in olive oil with garlic, lemon juice, and crushed black peppercorns. Thus, I left out the orange in the sauce, and added a small amount of minced lemon zest along with the juniper berries. I think the lighter, less sweet tang of lemon goes better with venison than oranges.

This was a good basic recipe, but I felt the orange really didn't go properly with the venison--it was too bright and citrusy for a dark, gamy meat, and competed with the meat instead of complementing it. A fruit like cherries or cranberries would have been better than orange, especially with the juniper berries (which is a fantastic flavor with venison).
