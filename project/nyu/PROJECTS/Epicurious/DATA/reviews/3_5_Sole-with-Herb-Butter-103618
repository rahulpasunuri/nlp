Super simple and quick to make but next time I think I'll dredge the sole in some flour. It could use some crunch I think but otherwise a great meal!

have made this several times, always delicious, no need to change anything

Didn't have fresh dill so I used a bit of dried. Added some fresh mint and rosemary. Sole is generally too delicate for my taste, but this came out nicely.

Tasty and really quick / easy. Next time I'll make the butter using half olive oil to lighten it up a bit, it will taste just as good. I served it with the tomato / leek compote from the Sole with Tomato and Leeks recipe (we love this one!) and Buttery Rice Pilaf which were well balanced with the sole. One mistake I made on the fish; I didn't use a big enough pan, so the bottom of the fish was a bit more poached (mushy) than broiled. Rookie move - don't do it!

I didn't have chives on hand so omitted them. I gave this 4 forks because of its ease and flavor. This is a perfect recipe for busy people that like to eat healthy. VERY YUMMY - Even the kids agree.

I'm surprised to see no one put up the classic "I substituted filet mignon for sole, grilled instead of broiled, and finished with some roasted potatoes". Perhaps, reviews are best when they make constructive criticism of the recipe--notes about the butter and fresh vs. dried herbs were helpful: a review of KFC when I'm looking up baked chicken is not. Personally I made the recipe as is and enjoyed it.

I agree with "a cook", it's not that useful to read a review that completely changes every aspect of the recipe, and then rates their own version. Interestingly, the comments that criticize "a cook" for being catty, suggest poisoning or lemon to the eyes. Meeooowww. Hiss hiss.

I've made this once and am about to have it again for dinner this evening. Since I prefer the texture of pan-fried fish to baked, I followed Karen's suggestions (see review below) and was quite pleased. Also cut down on the sauce quantity and added extra lemon. I'd give it 3 1/2 forks if I could - excellent dish. And I too appreciate the trend of thinking "outside the recipe box" when common sense and cooking wisdom suggests that a recipe might benefit from being tweaked a bit.

I cooked this on the grill (in a grill pan) instead of in the broiler and served it with grilled green beans marinated in olive oil and lemon juice. While we loved the green beans, my husband and I both thought the fish was just okay. His objection was there was too much butter. My objection is it was just too bland.....there are much better ways to cook sole. The herb-butter by itself is really delicious and would probably be excellent on steamed veggies or egg noodles, but it really didn't do much to flavor the fish. Also, as other reviewers mention, there was way more herb-butter than needed.

I have made this twice...the first w/ fresh herbs and the second w/dried. It tasted great both ways! Just make sure to use the fresh to dry ratio or the butter is way too overpowering. I served this with brown rice and Trader Joe's organic succotash. It is my "I don't have alot of time to prepare" meal. It does make alot of butter. I used the leftover on herb bread (garlic bread) with a sprinkling of grated romano cheese. I have also tried on baked chicken breasts for a yummy twist I added lemon zest.

Very nice. I omitted the salt & pepper and substituted a tablespoon of Becel for the butter. I used fresh herbs from the garden and served with new potatoes, swiss chard, and a tossed green salad.

Quite good! I cut back on the thyme, as advised, but I think that the full amount would work best. Watch the cooking time: my fish wasn't quite cooked through. Who taught Karen how to spel?

Rating: 3
This dish was so easy. I might cut back on the herbs next time. It sort of clumped on top of the fish and overpowered in some areas. I'll definitely make this one again, though.

This was extremely easy and had delicious flavor and texture. I will cut down on butter next time, however. I only used 3/4 stick and could have used half that much. Used garlic chives and it was herb-tastic!! I like the broiler method, as it's so low maintenance and low clean-up if you use foil.

This is so fresh and simple, it belongs in a French home cooking book! It's been a summer staple for a couple of months now, served at everything from quick suppers at home to luxurious dinner parties. One caveat: NO WHERE NEAR 1/2 c butter is required, I allow 1 - 2 TEASPOONS per filet. The chives are necessary, without them it's just herb butter without spark.

Let's put Karen in a cast iron skillet for 15 minutes and then transferred her to the oven. After basting with lemon (to sting her eyes) we can cover her with herb butter and then bring her to the table! Give her a break...she's sounds like an energetic member of the cooking community!

I haven't even tried this recipe yet, but for those of you reading this...you have to read the previous reviews. I give four forks for the sheer entertainment from the reviewers of this particular recipe. Look out for Karen on the next page of reviews and then start your way up...Comedy/Caddiness at its finest! (I hope I spelled that all correctly)

I should have used about half of the amounts of the herbs...it was too much for such a mild fish. I served it with Jasmine rice, green onions, and peas ( a reciped on this site) and it made for a very nice light dinner.

This dish is very nice as is. Simple, attractive and tasty. It cooks perfectly with the butter melting away over the fish and leaving a nice line of herbs over each fillet. I served it with roasted garlic tomatoes and fresh new potatoes.

Great recipe as is, very soft and delicate flavors! Couldn't have been easier, but I'll take the time to do Karen's just to spite the previous women. How comical! Is there a more peculiar place to post snide comments on people's experiences and criticize existent typos? Reader's feedback is an incredibly cool aspect to this database that's invaluable to me.

Fantastic weekday dish! I served it with pine nut couscous and prepared the entire meal in 15 minutes.

I actually used a combination of the epicurious recipe and Karen's. And that was before I read the reviews! I think sole lends itself to pan frying, and coated it in flour, so it wouldn't fall apart. It was pretty good.

Very good and easy to prepare. I'll definitely make it again, and I wouldn't change a thing about it.

Thank you Eileen, this dish was Delicious & easy, I will make it again. And Karen gave us a new recipe, she needs her own review has anyone tried hers?

None of us cared for this preparation for this type fish. Should be pan sauteed. The thyme didn't work either--too overpowering for this mild fish.

This was an incredible dish, my fiance' and I absolutely LOVED it. I will Definitely make this quite often. I used all fresh herbs from my garden, which I strongly suggest. (using FRESH herbs) It was so simple, anyone with a broiler can make this. Print this out and start cooking, you'll be glad you did!

This is a lovely, elegant dish. Some fresh peas or a lamb's lettuce salad would set it off nicely. And about the catty-ness over sugestions: Get a life!! How could someone get offended over another person taking the time to explain alternate cooking methods?

My husband and son loved this recipe. Unfortunately, I'm allergic to fish but it was simple for me to make for them. I just can't get over how nasty some of you people are who respond to other reviews. Why don't you nasties find a nice recipe for poison and use it. Bon appettit!

My goodness! No need to be catty ladies and/or gentlemen! Karen was merely letting us know another way to cook the recipe. This is common on epicurious. I, for one, don't like to use my broiler and I appreciated the idea.

I agree with "a cook"! come on Karen from Tucson, how is cooking with a cast iron pan the same as broiling??? And by the way, lemon only has one "m" in it!

Not BAD! Works pretty well with snapper too.

Karen from Tucson: try rating a recipe you actually cooked, will you? I want to read ratings from those who actually followed the recipe! Get a job writing for your local newspaper's food column if you are such a great chef! (By the way, this is good, as written).

I altered the cooking by soaking the sole in an egg and milk bath and then dredged in flour seasoned with salt & pepper. I then pan fried the sole in olive oil and some of the herb butter just until it was golden brown on both sides. I used a heavy cast iron skillit. I transfered the pan and fish into a pre-heated 400 degree oven to cook for 8 minutes. I served it by laying the fish on top of the Angel's Hair Pasta with Lemon and Pine Nuts,a dollop of herb butter on the fish, and a lemmon wedge. It was very light and delicious.
