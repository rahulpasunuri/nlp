This was a good, but not great, way to roast a goose. I followed the recipe exactly, down to the cheesecloth which kept the basting juices close to the skin. In the end the skin wasn't quite crispy enough and I found the herbs in the stuffing a little too much. One big caveat is the roasting time. I can't imagine how you can cook an 11 pound goose in under two hours like this recipe says. Mine was in the oven for more than 3 hours and was still the tiniest bit pink in the thighs. Definitely watch the time if you make this.

I only made the stuffing and it was delicious! I used home-made turkey stock and dried my own bread for the stuffing. It was full of flavor. A definate keeper.

I just made the stuffing, it turned out like stove top..even my partner thought it was stove top. It was dry and bland though smelled great,

Really good recipe for goose!! As with another review, I didn't use the bacon nor did I wrap in cheesecloth, however, I put the bird in a turkey size roasting bag (with a light spraying of Pam and a small amount of flour) then cooked as directed. Everyone at out Thanksgiving dinner was pleasantly surprised, including me, on how good the goose was. Have passed this recipe on to others and I will certainly use it again.

This is the best stuffing I have ever had!

For a more crisper goose, I blanched or boiled the goose for 2-5 min. two days ahead of time and then refrigerated it. I prefer my mother's bread stuffing to this one. The stuffing seemed too dry. The flavor was good but maybe one should add more broth. I also wondered if I didn't boil the goose, the fat from the bird would have given more moisture to the dressing. I will try this recipe again without boiling the goose. I'll let you know.

I used this recipe plus the one that appears in the book "Pass the Polenta" as a guide.The stuffing was good but I think that cooking it in the goose made it too greasy.If I did it again I would not stuff the bird with it I would cook it in a dish.

This recipe was great. i had never roasted a goose before, and I made a couple changes. I didn't bard the goose with bacon, because there was so much fat in the goose already. I also didn't wrap it in cheesecloth--I just roasted it on a roack like a normal bird. But the stuffing was _fabulous_, very moist and tasty, and the goose turned out very tender. Yum. I would try this again any time
