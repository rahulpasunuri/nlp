This was a fantastic and relatively quick and easy recipe, perfect for a weeknight. Goes very nicely with egg noodles or rice. I used herbs de Provence instead of tarragon, which I thought worked quite well. I also added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to accent the flavors. Will definitely be making this again.

We really enjoyed this meal. I did not have tarragon so used sage and oregano instead with fresh ground pepper. Used half and half instead of whipping cream. ANd put it on top of egg noodles. This is simple and easy to make for a quick yummy dinner. Now going to be on rotation in our home

This is a new favorite in our house. We had some trouble trying to get the sauce to thicken (it didn't, really), but it still tastes amazing.

This is absolutely delicious. And if you can't find leeks, substitute Anise. Yeah, I know, licorice but it rocks in this dish.

This recipe needs work. The timing is all off. It doesn't make sense to cook everything all at once. My sister and I tried this tonight, we decided to saute the mushrooms separately and add them only at the last moment with the tarragon. Reducing the wine takes a while, which led to slightly overcooked chicken. It's just not clear enough. We also thought it could use a little acid - lemon or something. There is a tarragon chicken and dumplings recipe my sister makes with pretty much all these same ingredients (except mushrooms) which is always reliable. I think we'll just stick with that from now on.

I would have browned the chicken separately from the leeks and mushrooms. Otherwise - OK, nothing super special about this recipe.

This dish is an excellent way to enjoy the flavor of tarragon. I use bnls sknls thighs sometimes and have an equally delicious meal. We serve it with buttered noodles.

We have made this dish twice- once as directed and the second with the addition of artichokes. Both ways were delicious and you could add a variety of other "green" vegetables or even sun dried tomatoes. This recipe was easily made and will be a weeknight addition.

I combined this recipe with the "Chicken Reisling" recipe and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and Vermouth instead of Reisling. I am so glad I grew tarragon and leeks in my garden. This is very tasty, easy and a go to for comfort. Thank you, Bon Appetit!

used leftover roast chicken and dried tarragon and it was great. Served over lundberg's rice medley. One note, it must have been the leftover chicken being a little drier, but I used more cream than called for or it was not even a sauce. I also added a splash of sherry with the wine, as I really like the flavor with mushrooms.

Rating: 4
Very easy and very good. Used shitake mushrooms. The fast preparation will make this a regular to our diet. Might experiment on the heavy cream to improve diet.

Rating: 4
Delicious and incredibly easy. I used whole pieces of chicken. Browned first in butter, then removed from pan and sauteed mushrooms and leek with tarragon until softened. Added chicken back to pan, added wine & cream, covered and cooked until done. BTW, I'm sure fresh tarragon is the best but as my market was out I did use dried with good success.

Rating: 3
This is a nice, easy recipe. As other reviewers mentioned, it has the potential to be a bit "eh". Turn up the flavor by browning the chicken first, then remove the chicken, saute the veggies and then add the wine, scraping up the brown bits. Then return your chicken to complete the cooking. I added the cream last.

This is a great recipe "as-is," no modifications required (or desired!). Fast, easy, delicious. It certainly qualifies as a dish for dinner guests, and is a very tasty way to deal with holiday turkey leftovers. You really must use fresh tarragon, or else the results won't be as spectacular. I use Noilly Prat in just about every recipe that calls for white wine and find that it works brilliantly well with this one. Can't help but comment on a few other reviews: Don't confuse subtlety in flavours with "blandness." If it's overpowering, you've done it wrong. The dish is delightfully flavourful, especially if you use fresh tarragon (and the Noilly Prat adds a certain something, too...). Also, the sauce isn't supposed to be some heavy, thick, glutinous concoction. If you use the right cream and pay attention to what you're doing, the sauce will thicken to just the right consistency on its own (just so it coats the spoon) without ruining it with thickeners.

This was not amazing and was even a bit on the bland side, but it was very easy to make, and still quite enjoyable, so I will make it again on a weeknight.

very very yummy. As others said, the sauce needed to be thicker, I suggest sauteeing mushrooms first to get the water out, and add wondra at end to thicken. I used two leeks, as well.

I loved this dish, in part because it was so quick and easy. I used chicken tenderloins dusted with flour, reduced the wine before adding half & half and I served the whole thing over wide egg noodles and garnished with parsley. My husband kept calling it chicken tetrazzini (which I wasn't happy about), but he couldn't stop eating it!

Great Flavor! I add a whole shallot, but it turned our wonderful. Very french!

So simple and yet so delicious! I didn't change anything and don't think it requires enhancement. A simple dish that I can make in the future from memory, as it really is that basic and probably not dependent on exactness in proportions. A 1/3 of a cup of this and a 1/3 of a cup of that with a tsp of dried tarragon. Easy peasy and delish. If you love French bistro fare and want it quickly, this is for you.

Incredibly easy to make. Not a lot of bang-up flavor, but a very pleasant dish. Sort of like the inside of a posh pot pie. As suggested by previous reviewers, I used two leeks. Didn't have any problem getting the sauce to reduce. Tarragon is essential, but then, I really love tarragon.

I loved this dish! Even though I forgot the tarragon, and had trouble getting the sauce to reduce (I am a novice) my boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dish! Next time I will add more leeks and make with mashed potatoes as others suggested. Really nice flavor.

Very very rich but very good. I kept the chicken breast whole for better presentation and served with mashed potatoes like another reviewer.

This was a delicious dish. Only change that I made was coating the chicken very, very lightly with flour (like other reviewers had suggested, with goal of thickening sauce a bit). It worked because sauce was perfect. Personally, I would have liked more tarragon but husband likes but does not love tarragon. Next time I'll increase liquid ingredients to have more sauce...sauce was wonderful, served with rice! Forgot that I did make one change..didn't use wine, just used chicken broth. Final thought - dish was sort of monochromatic, especially when served with starch (be it rice, noodles, pototoes). A sprinkling of parsley would have taken care of the single color issue.

Rating: 3
I somehow had only 1/2 tsp or so of tarragon so added other spices (savory). This still made for a very tasty meal. I browned the chicken pieces as suggested after coating them with flour,then cooked the leek and mushrooms seperately with the wine and in my case 1/2 & 1/2, added the chicken and a little more wine, and served this over plain rice cooked in chicken broth. All in all very good. I have a feeling that one could spice this up with some garlic and perhaps cayenne and it might be even better, however, I will most likely make this or some variation of it again. Good recipe, and yes there a million chicken recipes out there, but this is a keeper.

Rating: 4
My family absolutely loves this recipe, it's one of our favorites. I use dried tarragon instead of fresh and cook the sauce down until it reaches the perfect consistency for us. I've also used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts and served the dish over mashed potatoes as more of a "stew" -- wonderful on a cold night.

I appreciated all the reviews. Made this last night, added flour to the chicken prior to cooking, used white and wild mushrooms, white vermouth in equal amounts with half & half and mushroom broth, added a little cayenne with the fresh and dried tarragon, and some canned artichoke hearts just prior to the final simmering, and thickened the sauce with Wondra at the end. Served it over rice pilaf. Everyone loved it. Simple and good on a cool fall eve.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I floured the chicken strips and dusted them with a little paprika for color, made sure they were quite brown before adding the liquid, and I cooked the mushrooms separately. I also used half-and-half instead of cream and all was well -- the sauce thickened up fine. Very simple, tasty dish. I think fresh tarragon is a must; dried is too wimpy.

This is similar to a dish I have made for many years. I have always sauted the mushrooms separately and I have always used dry white vermouth instead of wine.

This was a typical subtle french dish. It was most easy and delicious. It's not much to look at on the plate, and with thousands of chicken recipes available, I probably won't make it again, but it's worthy of a try.

Nice and easy. I too rolled the chicken in flour to thicken the sauce. I also added some sage. Instead of whipping cream I used sour cream, but this, together with the wine, made it slightly tart so that wasn't a good idea. I served it with paprika rice and asparagus bundles wrapped in thin slices of bacon.

My wife and I thought this was wonderful. I used chicken breast tenders and rolled them in flour. I used bacon fat instead of butter and I had no problem with the sauce at all. We have placed this into our regular rotation. It is very simple and delicious.

Wow.. yumyumyum. I had the same problem with sauce being too thin, but a pinch of flour and some cooling took care of that. Can't wait to make it again, perhaps a notch lower on heat.

I made this in a slow cooker with chicken thighs and the results were fabulous! The first time I served it over saffron rice. The next time I made it I served it over roasted baby red bliss potatoes. I increased the serving size- 4-6 chicken thighs, doubled the mushrooms, onions, wine and cream. I substituted a rosemary blend in place of the tarragon. Cooked in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high.

Rating: 3
Simple solution to the problem of the thin sauce. Roll the chicken pieces in flour, then brown it in oil ( I cheated and browned bacon first, and then browned the chicken in the bacon fat) As you add the ingredients, the sauce will automatically thicken...duh!! My kids loved it. My diet did not!

My family loves this recipe! I do add flour to thicken the sauce.

It often sounds as though the negative reviews come from the same few people! This is a simple, fairly classic French recipe that can easily be tweaked to round out the flavors if one is truly a good cook. I haven't made this particular version but have often made this dish (use all the parts of the chicken - better flavors)in a very similar manner and it is always enjoyed by all. It seems that many of the negative reviewers have lost their taste buds for the true and simple tastes of the food and need to over salt, over pepper or slop a lot of hot sauce on to everything. Why bother cooking. Just drink the stuff straight from the bottle and gnaw on a clove of garlic! Bon appétit!

I have made this dish a number of times and my family absolutely loves it. I understand the problem some reviewers have had with the sauce seeming too thin. This is how I solve that problem: I sauté only the mushrooms in the butter until the liquid they expel is almost reabsorbed, then I continue with the recipe as written. I found that this eliminates a lot of liquid which thinned the sauce - this revised method allows the sauce to thicken up beautifully. Personally I use a just bit less wine and in its place add a handful of fresh, seeded/diced tomatoes to add color and flavor. I use about a tablespoon (+/-) of dried tarragon because we like the flavor better than fresh, and generously season with salt and pepper throughout. Delicious!

Rating: 2
Very good, though my sauce never thickened. I had to make some modifications as I only had thighs/legs (probably shouldn't have bothered cutting them up), & I ended up with more mushrooms and leeks than chicken. Used dried tarragon as fresh is not available here. Good flavor, but the dish never came together as I thought it would, and I definitely expected the sauce to be thicker. My boyfriend loved it.

My family (and friends!) absolutely loved this! The recipe is so simple, quick and easy to make but tastes as though you've spent the day in the kitchen preparing it. The second time I made this dish, I added some fresh parmesean cheese to the sauce at the end and enjoyed it even more! This is so delicious it makes any everyday cook seem like a chef!

This dish was awesome...quick and easy! The only thing I did differently was brine the chicken (soaked for 1/2 an hour in 1/8 c kosher salt, 1/8 c sugar and 4 c cold water). I then served it over a quick rice pilaf (sautéed some finely chopped shallot then rice over med-high heat and then added chicken stock instead of water and some parsley).

We enjoyed the receipt very much. I didn't have white wine at home, but I had vermouth which worked. The only thing I would do different is add a little flour and water at the end to thicken the sauce. I cooked the sauce longer then advised and it never thickened up the way I wanted it to. A winner non the less, I would make this again.

Mighty fine! I'm not really sure how you could make this badly unless you used bad wine. If you like traditional French food, you'll like it - I loved it. I did S & P the chicken before the first saute and I also seasoned the sauce when it was done.
