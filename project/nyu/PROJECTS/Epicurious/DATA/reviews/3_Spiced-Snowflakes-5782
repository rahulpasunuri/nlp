Disappointing. The flavor was interesting, but became monotonous quickly. Also, the cookies are very dry.

A very flavorful cookie. It was a hit for Christmas. I did find the dough easier to work after I froze my 2nd batch and then cut it. It thaws very quickly! I also dusted the powdered sugar on while they were fairly warm out of the oven and it stayed on the cookies nicely.
