This is about the 5th time that I have made this and it tastes amazing every time. I used salted butter and add salt. I also put in a tsp of vanilla. So fantastically good. Always, always gets rave reviews.

I make this every Christmas time--some to give away, some to eat. Its fairly easy, and looks beautiful. I use a little less of the chocolate chips (about 8 to 10 oz per batch). Sometimes I don't bother with the sprinkling of almonds on top of the chocolate too, because it falls off pretty easily.

Made this in advance of a dinner party for a friend who loves toffee, read many other reviews... used salted butter, salt and vanilla for a wonderfully buttery toffee, used whole/chopped almonds/cashews which cooled the toffee too quickly, will press them into the spread toffee next time around, didn't have the right size pan so the toffee was thicker than wanted but delicious, much better with the salt and the darkened (300 temp) finished toffee, also used semi ghiradelli.

This toffee tastes like something I would purchase out of a gourmet candies shop. It is fantastic. I have made it twice now- both times including a tsp of salt & 2 of vanilla. The first time I used the Nestles' semi-sweet chocolate I had hanging around my kitchen, and I regretted it every bite. This is GOOD toffee & deserves GOOD chocolate. Enjoy!

Excellent and easy recipe. I used 1/2 tsp of salt and vanilla as suggested by earlier reviewer. I think a candy thermometer is key. I cooked to 300*. The texture was perfect. Also Trader Joe's bittersweet chocolate, chopped well. This is a keeper.

I use Macadamia nuts and it is FANTASTIC. And unusual. Also cook to 325 or so, cool on the counter at least an hour before refrigerating, and the chocolate stays put. I use unsalted butter, but salted nuts. Otherwise, exactly as written, It is a family classic in our house.

Excellent and easy recipe. You do not really need a candy thermometer. Just follow prior suggestions of knowing it is done when it is a dark peanut butter color. I also added a quarter tsp of vanilla extract and a quarter tsp of almond extract. It's my holiday staple right now. Made a batch true to the recipe - Made another batch with semisweet chocolate chips and peanut butter chips on top with chopped almonds and walnuts inside - Made a batch with toasted pecans mixed in and chopped candy canes as a topping pressed in. It's far too easy not to make and everyone seems to love it... which is good, because it is too dangerous to leave lying within arm's reach at home.

Cooking to less dark color, my toffee is chewy. The toffee spread out and is fairly thin. Can be cut with hot knife after adding chocolate. As mentioned, it can seem greasy if not cooked to hot enough temperature. I will make this again and attempt to get it crisp for gift giving. Would like to try Queen Sophia's version, using equal, nearly sugar to butter.

The silpat mat works great for this recipe and using good quality chocolate (not chips) will bring rave reviews.If you have a candy thermometer, than 300 degrees is the hard crack temperature and what you want. This is such an easy recipe for blue ribbon candy!!!

I decided I needed to add a little sea salt. I will cook it to a darker color next time. Overall, very good and very simple. I put it in the freezer to cool the chocolate more quickly. I had to use pecans but I have substituted mixed salted nuts (from Costco) in other toffee recipes with great results. Will make again.

I used some of the other good suggestions (baking soda, vanilla, salt), and I also liked the idea of not refrigerating right away so that the chocolate would adhere. But I thought the toffee would look (and taste) better if there were chocolate on both sides. So instead of oiling the pan i lined the pan with parchment paper, folding the paper at the bottom so it came up the side edges of the pan. After adding the chocolate and chopped nuts to the top of the toffee and letting it rest at room temperature and refrigerating, I carefully removed the toffee from the pan by lifting the edges of the parchment paper, then inverted the toffee back onto the pan and peeled off the paper. Then I melted an equal amount of chocolate (I used the full 12 oz for each side!) in the microwave and spread the melted chocolate on the second side, then sprinkled more chopped nuts onto that side as well. Refrigerate again until firm and break into pieces...great stuff!

I too followed changes suggested by the cook from Massachusetts 11/21/05, and my toffee turned out splendidly! I used 1/2 t of vanilla and 1/2 t sea salt, and that was just right. I discovered too late my candy thermometer was broken, so cooked until it was the color of dark peanut butter, then spread it on a small pan covered in that new non-stick foil. I used a silicone spatula to stir and spread and that worked great. I left it at room temperature for a couple of hours, then moved it to a very cool room, and did not freeze. The chocolate did not separate, and the candy is the perfect texture. I'll be making a lot more this week! I want to try using tempered chocolate to solve the melting problem.

I used toasted pecans, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. salt, and only about 8 oz. giradelli's chocolate chips. I did use a candy thermometer and cooked until it reached 300 degrees. My husband said he's never had better toffee. The only trouble I had was when I got inventive with the last batch, and had the cookie sheet preheated so the toffee wouldn't set up quite so quickly, giving me a chance to get it evenly spread. This unfortunately caused the toffee to stay hot too long I think, giving it a scorched taste. But the first several batches came out great--a definite repeat!

I followed the changes suggested by Massachusetts 11/21/05 (thanks!). The changes greatly improved this toffee. I cooked at 300 for ~3 min to ensure it was at hard crack stage. I used whole, toasted almonds, sprinkled chocolate chips, spread after melting. I didn't freeze the toffee, so perhaps that's why mine was a bit chewy.

This recipe definitely needs salt, salted butter alone doesn't give it enough flavor. I used just under 1/2 tsp of salt the second time I made this, and I used salted butter. I also added 2 tsp of vanilla just before pouring the toffee into the pan. I melted bittersweet chocolate over the top and used sliced almonds - it was prettier than the chopped almonds. With the changes it turned into a 4-fork recipe, but without it is just so-so.

This is the 3rd year I have made this recipe, and this year's was the best. I used several other reviewer's suggestions and added some of my own.I added 1/2 tsp salt to the sugar, corn syrup and butter mixture. I heated the candy up to the hard crack stage (300 F). Then I added 1 tsp vanilla (stand back) and 1/2 tsp baking soda while quickly stirring the mixture. After pouring the toffee into the pan and spreading the mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on (6 oz), I ground some almonds in my coffee grinder and dusted the top of the chocolate with it. I let the mixture sit on the counter for an hour before chilling it in the refrigerator. Last year, I put the toffee in the refrigerator immediately, and the chocolate separated from the toffee. These additions made the toffee more crunchy, buttery and airy, and less stick to your teeth chewy.

Like everyone else, I adapted this slightly. The salt and vanilla help. I used natural honey instead of corn-based sweetners for extra taste (more if you want it crackly, less if you want a softer toffee). Roasted pecans work great, as do walnuts and raisins or chopped cherries (yum). Key ingredient is to use good chocolate on top - as much as you like. Nestle and toll-house have too much parafin to melt and reform properly. Great xmas gift and seriously addictive!

I am giving this recipe only three forks because I made up my own recipe based off of this one, as so many epicurious readers do. Reading the recipe makes me think the toffee would be bland. I used everyone's suggestions about adding 1/2 t. salt, 1-2 t. vanilla. I cut back on the Karo to 2 T. (I had 6 batches to make and I was running out of syrup!) Boil everything together until it reaches 300 on a candy thermometer, or as other cooks suggest, it looks like dark peanut butter--it really does! I didn't bother with the chocolate. I love this recipe because it is FAST, simple, and tastes SO good! You don't actually have to stand over the stove while it cooks. I just left it and stirred it periodically until the very end; this allowed me to multi-task! Everyone asked me for the recipe. I packed it in little cellophane baggies tied with ribbon to give away as party favours/goodbye gifts at my boyfriend's birthday party. The party had an Indian food theme, so I used roasted, unsalted cashews as the nut in the toffee--a huge success.

This recipe was easy to follow, and with the tips from prior reviewers (added salt and vanilla and boiled until it turned a golden brown color), the toffee turned out crisp and delicious. I'd like to use this recipe for gifts, but I had the problem mentioned in other reviews with the chocolate melting and separating from the toffee at room temperature. Does anyone have tips for this?

The toffee did not get crisp. Is there anyone out there with a perfect recipe?

This toffee is ONLY delicious when you make it with the recommended changes supplied by previous reviewers. Those changes are: add 1 tbl. pure vanilla extract; use SALTED butter, not unsalted; forget the candy thermometer-- instead, cook the toffee until it is the color of peanut butter (about 8-10 minutes); reduce the amount of chocolate to 6oz or 8oz. I also used toasted pecans rather than almonds-- it really added more depth. Great hit at parties and makes a wonderful holiday gift-- VERY popular!

The first batch cooked too long to a deep caramel color, but still tasted wonderful. The second batch cooked to the correct temperature and color but the chocolate wouldn't adhere. Still tasted good, though. Preferred the first way.

This is a great toffee recipe!! As discussed by other reviewers, I use salted butter, milk chocolate (only 6 oz) and toasted pecan pieces. Deeeeeee-lish! Everyone clamors for more...and the recipe. Easy to make, nice crunch, no separating, not oily. This one is a keeper.

I just made a quick half batch of this and it is fabulous! I followed suggestions to add vanilla extract and cook the toffee until the color is similar to peanut butter (which was about 310 degrees for me). I can't wait to make it again and use premium chocolate like valrhona.

Rating: 4
So easy and good! I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers to good effect. I used a candy thermometer and heated to 300 (a darkened carmel brown). I added a little salt, and this worked wonderfully. I added a dash of vanilla to the mix with the water and thought this added depth. I chopped nuts and covered the bottom of a small loaf pan, then poured the toffee over them (I also did a nuts, melted chocolate, toffee mix that worked well). Will make again.

I've been doing this since last year, when the reviews made me curious enough to try it; never done candy before, don't have the thermometer. But I've done caramel before so I thought why not? Like the cook from Tucson, I go by colour, and it works. But yes, cook the candy properly, otherwise it would get greasy, or chewy. Decreased the chocolate; personal preference. If I can do this, you can too. Thank you, reviewers, for all the useful tips (like the timing). Good one.

I have been making this for Christmas gifts for 3 or 4 years and get rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. I use chopped whole toasted almonds and Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips. I agree with others that is sets up quick. I use two wooden spatulas to pull and pat out the toffee to the desired depth. I no longer use a thermometer or cold water method for the candy. When it becomes the color of peanut butter or a little darker (because I like it crunchy), it is ready to add the nuts. Very simple that way. I think that the comments about greasiness were because the candy wasn't cooked enough. Chewy toffee is just plain annoying! Keep it on the heat! My friend uses the same recipe, but with a Pyrex cup in the microwave. She swears by it.

This recipe, as printed, is bland - plain and simple. Maybe it is because I am a candy and sweets nut, that it did not live up to my expectations - especially after reading all of the good reviews it got. I'm disappointed - it's pain, bland, and greasey - I wanted rich, buttery, & flavorful :-(

Ah, the benefits of using other cook's reviews! I greased the pan lightly with Crisco instead of oil, and used 1 1/2 C. toasted peacans, some in the toffee and some on top of the chocolate! Also, it took me 15 min. to reach 290+ degrees using a candy thermometer. I also had the Merkens dark chocolate on hand and used other cooks advice of 6 oz. (3/4 C.). What a wonderful holiday treat! Not oily and no separation of chocolate that others experienced. Set nicely in 'frig.

Made the recipe exactly as stated. Turned out wonderful. Reminded me of Almond Roca. Just as a personal preference, next time, I will cut down the chocolate to 6 ounces.

Rating: 3
Kinda ho-hum. If you're looking for the buttery style of almond toffee found in Heath or Scor bars or in Almond Roca, then you MUST add salt (1-1/4 tsp) or use SALTED butter. It makes a world of difference! I recommend milk chocolate on top rather than semi-sweet -- particularly if you're adding salt (the saltiness nicely offsets the sweetness of milk chocolate). Also, the toffee breaks more cleanly if you heat it to 300 degrees rather than 290 (it's more brittle than crunchy at 290 due to the large amount of corn syrup).

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe at least 20 times in the past few years. I never put the nuts in with the toffee, but simply press the toasted nuts into the chocolate. I prefer pecans. I've found that the toffee tastes much richer and more buttery with the nuts on top. I also cut back on the amount of chocolate as it does seem to overwhelm the candy. I have requests for it every year from the most ardent of toffee lovers.

I tried this toffee but will go back to my tried and true recipe which is just as easy but has a better texture and more buttery taste. It calls for 2 cups almonds, 1 cup butter, 1-1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tbsp. light corn syrup, 2 Tbsp. water and the 12 oz. of chocolate chips. Cook the same way but candy thermometer registers at 300 degrees. I think you will agree that this is so much better.

Wonderful and easy. Delicious! I use all different kinds of toasted nuts, this time whole chopped almonds and macadamias (no such thing as too many nuts in my book). This recipe is still amazing without the chocolate on top. I always have to make two batches and hide some in the freezer to add to my favorite cookies. Everyone I share it with tears it up : )

This toffee was wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I agree with the other reviewers, it just doesn't have the buttery toffee flavor I was looking for. All toffee is fairly easy to make, it takes the right combination of ingredients. I'll look for another recipe next year.

I am a novice candy maker, but felt this turned out well. I had no trouble with "melty" chocolate. Perhaps it has something to do with the brand used. Next time I will use less chocolate, as I feel the entire amount overwhelms the toffee. All in all -- everyone seemed to like it, so I'll make it again.

Rating: 3
As a novice candy maker, I was very pleased with the results but the 'Cook from Whitehall, PA on 12/25/01' made some excellent points, i.e., lack of a rich toffee taste, the greasy feel, the meltiness of the chocolate, etc. Having said that, I would make this recipe again because it is so simple. Also I found that you had to work fast once the almonds were added to the hot mixture because it starts setting up like concrete and it makes it difficult to spread it evenly in the baking pan.

Rating: 2
I see this recipe got a lot of great reviews, but I thought this recipe was just 'okay'. The finished product looked great, and it was easy to make, but the taste of the toffee itself left a bit to be desired...I make a lot of candy, and was really looking for more of a rich toffee taste...It had a plain sugar/almond flavor, and seemed a little bit greasy. I used less than 2 c. almonds, which was more than enough, and also found that 8-10 oz. of chocolate was all that was needed...a bit of parrafin would also help the chocolate be less 'melty' at room temperature (needs to be kept referigerated). Mixture does need to be cooked to the hard ball stage and finished product broken into pieces when cold to prevent chocolate from separating from the toffee.

Best toffee recipe I've tried as of yet. Great texture and the chocolate stays on well. I followed another reviewer's advice and didn't add all of the nuts. I used chopped almonds and found that 1 1/2 cups total was plenty for this recipe. Could probably get by with even less. Great recipe!

This recipe is very easy to make. The directions were clear and accurate. The only slight glitch I had was that the chocolate chips didn't seem to be melting. I stuck the pan in the oven (which was still warm from toasting the nuts) for 1-2 minutes and after that, the chips melted just fine. I cooled the pan in the 'fridge, but didn't have a problem with the chocolate sticking to the toffee (as the previous reviewer mentioned). I used sliced almonds rather than slivered, and the recipe came out fine, so thanks the the reviewer who suggested sliced almonds would be ok.

I had a small problem with the recipe. My chocolate coating didn't stick to the toffee when I broke it into bite sized pieces. Maybe I should have cooled it on the countertop instead of the refrigerator. The taste of the toffee was terrific and the instructions for cooking were right on target. I didn't have almonds so I used toasted pecans. They were just as tasty. I plan on trying this again to see if I can remedy the chocolate problem.

Rating: 3
This toffee tastes great and is easy to make. The recipe calls for far more almonds than are necessary, however. I use about 1 cup almonds for the toffee itself and about 1/3-1/2 cup to top the chocolate. I also use high-quality milk chocolate instead of the semi-sweet. With these adjustments, this recipe is a great holiday treat that will impress all those in the office who don't think you can cook!

This toffee is great! I made it with a friend as a yummy mid-day treat. We didn't have a candy thermometer, so we judged when it should be poured by its color. If it turns a brown caramel color, it is done. We also substituted macadamia nuts for almonds--it was wonderful!! A definite must-make!!!

I've made this many times now and each time it is a real winner. It tastes great with pecans too.
