This was an excellent dish. I omitted the parmesan, added extra swiss and mixed all the ingredients together (rather than layering) in the baking dish. Our guests kept going back for more.

OMG. I have loved this recipe since it was first published and look it up every year at Thanksgiving! A nice change from the usual sweet potato casserole. I love that it has options - options for preparing and options for ingredients. Try it in the microwave for a quicker version, but oven is better. I add onion slices (rings) and asiago cheese. Love that rosemary! The dish is ALWAYS A HIT. Thanks for this wonderful recipe year after year!

i used yukons instead of russets and the sweet pottotes cooked almost to mush before the yukons got done. It may have been the choose of potatoe. Added parmesan between each layer. Baked in oven at 400. I think other gratins would be better but maybe not as easy.

This was so easy, and it was such a beautiful presentation, plus it was absolutely delicious! I will make this over and over! LOVE IT! I put caramelized onions on top of each layer of sweet potatoes and it's amazing!

Made it as written, except for the last step - I baked it in the oven after I added the cheese and it browned and bubbled nicely. Turns out no one (including me) liked the rosemary and I think I would try it with chives next time. Don't be cheap with the salt - it needs alot.

Very good! I made aome modifications. I added cheese and garlic to each layer alternating the type of cheese. I am not a fan of microwave cooking so I put it in the oven at 400 for 45 minutes. It wasn't quite done so I finished it off in the microwave for an additional 5 minutes on high. It turn out perfectly, next time I think I will try whole milk to cut back on some calories.

Found this to be too soupy - I believe that some time in the oven to crisp it would do wonders.

Yum! Made it just as the recipe dictated and thought the result was awesome. We'll be making it again soon.

"Two-potato Gratin" is a fine dish, but I was still hungry. I suggest using 2 LARGE potatoes.

Made this 2 days ago pretty much as the recipe dictates (did add red onion as reviewers suggested). However, did use half and half instead of heavy cream, so it did stay a bit juicy. Also, nuked this on high for 10 minutes, then on medium for about 5 minutes, and then on low a few minutes until the potatoes were soft. (I did not have a mess in my microwave.) This was DELICIOUS!!! The longer it sat before serving, the better it got. The leftovers were AWESOME!!! A definite remake. [P.S: Wal-Mart sells an excellent Wisconsin Swiss cheese that is very flavorful (CacheValley). Since it is a block, you do have to shred it yourself.]

Pretty to look at, and edible, but totally unremarkable. I used asiago instead of swiss because I had it already. I also crushed corn flakes on top because I thought it was going to be too watery. I totally agree it needs to be done in the oven!! This recipe has potential, but it reallt needs something. Served it with prime rib with cabernet jus from this website.

Holy Moly - you can't get an easier recipe! The only change I made was Romano Cheese instead of the Swiss. Great dish. A definate keeper!

Very good dish. Im not a sweet potato fan, but the mixture of the two potatoes balanced each other well.

We make this dish often, and it has always been a crowd pleaser. It is also good reheated as leftovers. We always cook in the oven. We substitute the cheeses as swiss has next to zero flavor. We have used a smoke gouda and a gruyere and the parmesan with good result (note, don't put the gouda on top - does not melt well). We also put some fresh rosemary or tarragon between the layers. Adds a really fresh flavor.

A nice and easy gratin! I baked mine for 1 hr at 350 as others did. I liked using two different potatoes and the tastes complemented each other. I also used low fat milk instead of cream.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I used Fat-Free Half and Half and that was my only substitution. I don't think it needs onion or garlic. I 'cooked' the potatoes in the microwave (half the recipe did not take 18 minutes - oops! what a mess) I then added the cheese and finished the gratin in a 375 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Excellent flavor and so easy. I plan a repeat on Christmas Day.

Made this for thanksgiving--adding onion. Everyone liked it but it was VERY rich. There were six of us and I had half leftover.

This is a perpetual favorite. I start it in the microwave and finish in the oven, to get the cheese nice and bubbly. Very easy.

This was good, but not great. I, to, added diced onion and garlic in between the layers of potatoes and I cannot imagine the dish without them. I still found it to be a little boring. I also did mine in the oven at 350 for an hour.

Delicious dish, quick and easy to prepare. I added a little chopped onion to the last layer and used half-and-half. I also baked it in the oven at 350 for and hour. It was wonderful. I noticed my Dad and brother eyeing it suspiciously because it had sweet potatoes but they both had seconds (something my Dad VERY rarely does) very good recipe. My husband commented how good it was several times but also suggested that next time I add some more swiss cheese in the layers as well as on top.

Fantastic dish! I've made this twice now - to accompany pork loin. Both times it was devoured, even by those who claim they don't like sweet potatoes. Both times I've added a bit of minced onion and garlic, lightened it considerably (using a mixture of skim milk and half-half) and baked in the oven. It was plenty rich. Will definitely make again and again!

Definitely try but be sure to bake, not microwave (the crusty bits on side are alone worth the baking!). Try as suggested by previous reviewers @ 350 for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, covering with foil till last 15 minutes. I smoothed the top with a crispy breadcrumb and butter mixture - yum! Next time will try with fresh basil or oregano for another taste/dimension. I needed a larger pan than the 8" x 8" called for. Enjoy!

EVERYONE loved it...I baked it in the oven covered with foil. I doubled the amaount of every thing except the cream. It was A big success. A very nice recipe.

Awesome dish! I prepared this to accompany grilled steak and squash for a small gathering. Everyone raved about this dish. I doubled the recipe and used russets only (not a big sweet potato fan). Next time, I will try using reduced fat Swiss and 'half and half' in place of whip. cream, to cut down on some fat/calories. I also baked at 350, for an hour, uncovered, and then covered with foil for the last 15 min.

Without a doubt -- bake rather than microwave. I took reviewers advice and popped them in the oven at 350F for an hour (keep them covered with foil until the last 15 minutes.) I thought they looked beautiful, but there were a lot of leftovers. My family found them too rich (could it be all the cheese and cream!) so maybe you could substitute whole milk? Also -- I like rosemary, but it's can be an overwhelming taste. Nevertheless, a good dish - try it.

Bham! I kicked it up a notch and added garlic, more parm & swiss cheese, layered more, added chopped sweet onions, parsley & 2 T. butter AND BREAD CRUMBS ON TOP. WOW! The guests had seconds and all asked for the recipe. I BAKED at 350 for 1 1/2 hrs. My gourmet group LOVED this recipe!

We love this recipe. I think baking in the oven helps blend the flavors. I also added an onion. I'll be doubling the recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and having this instead of the usual yams and mashed potatoes!

Now this is comfort food beyond belief. I love this recipe. I added 1/2 cup of minced red onion and 1/4 cup of parsley to the recipe. So creamy and wonderful. I served it along with garlic and oregano grilled lamb chops. My 4 year old Emma asked for 2nds!

Very tasty. I added sliced scallions. The cream boiled over in the microwave, but the potatoes still came out great.

I baked this dish at 350d. for one hour (I doubled the recipe). I also added one medium onion, sliced. Next time I think I would layer half of the potatoes with the onion and the cheese. It was a Big success at my Easter dinner.

Can't believe how good this is! I've been making potato gratins for years and have never found a better recipe. I cut the rosemary to 1 tsp., used half russet and half red-skinned potatoes, and added 1/4 cup finely minced onion and 2 Tbs. finely minced prosciutto between the potato layers. Topped with cheese AFTER microwaving and finished, uncovered, in 400 degree oven for ten minutes to brown cheese. Got absolute raves from the family.

At the risk of being redundant, this is a great recipe. Try it with white yams or whatever mix of potatoes you like. Add onions or chopped ham or whatever tempts you. Put it in the over after you add the cheese. It's quick and easy and it makes grown men groan.

It's so easy to add more punch to this recipe, especially if you don't like sweet potatoes, as we don't. I used Yukon Gold & Red pototoes, threw in a couple layers of mushrooms and red onions, some paprika and YUM! Also, flavor is best if you microwave JUST the potatoes for 20 - 30 minutes, then layer on stuff, and pop in oven to finish baking.

This was wonderful! Definitely use the regular oven and consider adding a small onion, thinly sliced mixed in with the potato layers.

Very tasty dish. My guests who didn't like rosemary asked for seconds.Seems to work well in the microwave or in the oven. Depends on the amount of time you have.

This is especially nice if you have a mandolin to slice the potatoes thinly. The rosemary added a great flavor, it was not too cheesy, but I would recommend doing this in the oven for a more thoroughly cooked flavor.

Very tasty. Not terribly fond of microwave cooking, so we baked this at 350 for approximately 1 hour. Cheeses turn an attractive brown and bubbly. Everyone agreed these would be made again.

This was very easy to make and pleased all of my dinner guests (even the kids ate it!). I had a little trouble with the potatoes not absorbing the cream in the microwave so after putting the cheese on top, I put it in the oven for 10 minutes or so. This made the cheese brown and crispy too.
