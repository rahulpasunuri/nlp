It was great tasting, but quite expensive to make! In the future I would save it for a special date, and make sure i have nice crusty (maybe garlic) bread with it!

Truly excellent stew. I was faithful to the spirit of the recipe, but omitted the mussels, added some lemon zest to the cooking veggies, used seafood stock instead of clam juice, and added a bit more wine and Calvados than called for. I also added about 1.5 c water as the stew cooked down.

This stew is fantastic, but it's much more sophisticated than a stew. The flavors of the calvados and the white wine only make the shellfish flavors more intense. It's delicious! I have never ever found celery root, though; each time I make it, I add a little more of the potato and leeks, and the dish doesn't seem to suffer for it! This is a great dish for special occasions.
