this gets a 2 1/2 stars from me...good but a bit dry even tho i added some more oil and vinegar before serving. i also didnt add enough chile.it also needed salt and pepper. i am still searching for a better recipe. i served it with coconut carrot soup, spicy chinese ribs, chopped salad so the meal was good overall but still....

i thought this was a great summer potato salad! and, everyone loved that it had no mayonnaise! i did make a few changes, though: the salsa needed salt, and quite a bit of it. i, too, substituted half a sweet yellow onion for the shallots. i also added three or four cherry tomatoes to the food processor and a tablespoon or so of diced green chilies. oh, and about a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. i felt the other peppers, while not adding inordinate heat did keep the flavor from ringing one-note. and, finally, i served it with barbecued pork chops, cucumber salad with mint and dill, simple roasted summer squash and nice mealy cornbread. it was a total success.

The raw shallots were too overpowering and left a strong aftertaste and I only used one, instead of the 1.5 the recipe called for. I would try a red onion or green onions because this recipe has great potential, and adds flavor to grilled chicken with a light spread. My guess is that the shallots is the taste that some other reviewers thought was strong, not the peppers.

This recipe is so awesome. I only made half because there are only two of us. Had the leftovers the next day. I know this will make this a lot when we grill in the summer.

this chile-cilantro sauce is SO delicious and can be poured liberally over anything and everything - pasta for a pasta salad, potatoes of course, steak, the list goes on!

No one was more surprised how delicious this was than me. I didn't have 4lbs of fingerlings so I mixed what I had with some small red bliss potatoes and it was fabulous. Really simple, really cheap, really good.

I agree with veggiesforlife -- this really is a fabulous dish and my favorite potato salad to date (narrowly pulling ahead of German potato salad). It was one of the most popular things at a party I brought it to, and was gone in a matter of minutes. Double the recipe!

It is good, but I agree with one reviewer that it is certainly not a show-stopper. If you like the ingredients that the recipe is made of then you will enjoy the dish.

This was simple and excellent. I, of course made some changes according to what I had on hand. I did the thing with the celery and scallions instead of shallots. And I served it with radish sprouts on top. Ooooh, spicey!

This is a tasty salad, but keep in mind it is just a potato salad and is not going to change your life. It is not a an earth-shattering, knee-quaking, best-thing-you-ever-tasted recipe. It is just a potato salad. But a pretty good and unusual one. Oh, I recommend adding salt to the recipe. Not enough flavor for my taste without it.

simple, easy, and flavorful. great leftover dish...tastes even better a couple days later.

Fast, easy, & flavorful. Used baby Yukon golds I had on hand. If you don't like cilantro, this is NOT for you.

I made this for a party and there was not a single bit left in the bowl. It was a hit. Delicious! The only thing I changed was that I added chopped up celery and spring onions instead of shallots to make it even more green.

I make this all the time and use it over EVERYTHING. Makes a great chip dip, too if you tire of plain salsa. I used to think cilantro was just another parsley...but now I am it's biggest fan. Notice this is salt free: it doesn't need it and you won't miss it.

I loved this dish. I had to use white wine vinegar instead of cider but it still turned out beautifully. A nice summer side dish with a refreshing taste. This is a keeper.

This is excellent. I have made this numerous times and it always gets rave reviews. My kids who don't prefer potatoes will eat this. I have used white and red potatoes but recently made it with the fingerling potatoes and would say they are the best choice. I use more jalapenos and more garlic than called for and it makes a difference. I have also substituted balsamic vinegar and it works well. This is a make again and again recipe

I made this twice recently for two different potluck dinners and both times received rave comments and requests for the recipe. It is a very good, lower fat potato salad recipe. Since it doesn't require referigeration it worked out great for a buffet or a picnic.

Rating: 4
This was so easy to make and very inexpensive! It is spicy but I enjoy spicy foods. I would suggest cutting back on the jalepeno if you do not like much spice. The cilantro was an excellent balance to the jalepeno and the overflavor was unique and fresh tasting.

I love spicy food, cilantro, and potatos are my favorite vegetable so I thought I'd love this but it just turned out kinda bland for my taste. There was some overpowering strong flavor (maybe the raw green chile?)but I just felt it needed something else. I took it to work for a potluck but brought lots home uneaten so I tried mashing it up and added cheese and salt and made a pretty good potato burrito filling out of it though.

I've made this several times and its great. I only use one jalapeno though. Fantastic flavor.

Rating: 3
Delish. I increased the sauce amount by 50%. Because I didn't know the heat tolerance of my audience, I cut down the jalapenos, but I served them (minced) on the side for those who like it hot. This dish is a great picnic or potluck dish because it can sit at room temperature for a long time without spoiling.

Maybe it's just me, but the chili pepper was too biting; I shouldn't have used all three. It overpowered any of the other flavors. The burning of the pepper remained after you thought you had finished with it! and I like hot and spicy foods. I am not creative enough to "fix it up" like so many of you so I've just thrown out the recipe instead.

The other night I had a picnic to attend at the local winery situated on a bluff overlooking the river. Because I had both cilantro and green chiles in my garden, I decied to make this recipe. I substituted green chiles for jalapenos. Rave reviews for the salad from everyone there. Some asked for the recipe as well! My friends are always amazed that my cooking is based primarily on reicpes from this site. Thanks to the fork reviews, I seldom "practice" the recipe prior to taking it to an event. Thanks to everyone's contributions and comments!

Now this is a great potato salad! Wonderful combination, interesting and full of flavors, I just wish there had been leftovers.

A big hit at a party--I made about three times the recipe with half tiny red new potatos and half white heaped in a big shallow pasta bowl--looked spectacular. Guests couldn't stop nibbling with fingers even before dinner was officially on the table, and lots asked for the recipe.

I wouldn't rave. If you're trying to assess this recipe, just know that it's the sum of its parts: it doesn't soar above its ingredients into something other than chili-cilantro-oil-vinegar, etc. like a green salsa potato salad cousin. What you see is what you get. Certainly not bad, but not a show-stopper, although I seem to be in the minority. And don't forget the salt.

Loved this potato salad - and those that tried it too! Much better than the mayonnaise based salads.

Fresh and bright - doesn't get gummy the way a mayonaissed salad does. Everyone loves this potato salad

I made this because of the "buckle at the knees" & "whole bowl myself" comments below. This is the best potato salad!! I've been on a 20 year search for a good one that didn't use mayonnaise and was semi-healthful. I would eat this one even if it had lard in it.

A definite keeper! I've made this 3 times now for various occasions, and get rave reviews from the cilantro lovers every time.

Ready for a really strange review? I made the recipe, but it was the eve of a big camping trip and I was feeling exhausted. Maybe I fudged the ingredients a bit. The big surprise came when I took my first taste--I thought the salsa would burn a trench right through my throat with all of the raw onions, etc. I guess the key is to let the sauce mellow. Or, even better, take the salsa (like I did) and mix it with a big bowl of plain, low-fat yoghurt. Potato salad? Nah! Try a phenomenal dip instead. And buy some sugar snap peas to go with it!

Oh my gosh! I could have eaten the entire bowl by myself. I used red potatoes because Fingerling's are not available in my area. Just incredible!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I loved this dish! Cilantro lovers of the culinary world will buckle at the knees after one bite. I modified this recipe to include some chorizo sausage and a few more pepper pieces than called for. I then sent it along to work with my boyfriend and the whole office loved it! (They are big fans of spicy dishes). Also, I don't think fingerling potatoes are necessary; any potato salad potato should work great. Olive oil makes this dish healthier than a traditional mayonnaise based salad---great benefit!

Easy and WONDERFUL! I came accross fingerling potatoes by chance at an out of the way farmer's market, and this dish came to mind immediately. I also added some unusual purple potatoes for color's sake, and it was beautiful. I partially seeded 2 jalepenos, and did not seed the last one. It was spicy, just delicious. The salsa is also killer on plain ol' French baguette. I'll gladly make this dish again and again.

Spectacular! I needed a quick, easy, yet dazzling dish to take to a picnic and this was it. As I unveiled the dish, friends swarmed around wanting to try it. The potatoes looked and smelled so inviting, wonderful color. While I was still dishing the potatoes out, friends stood around asking for the recipe. I doubled the recipe, but still only kept the seeds to one chile and it was spicy but not too hot. I substituted rice vinegar for cider vinegar. I used both fingerling and tiny red potatoes to add color and sprinkled a very small amount of olive oil on the potatoes just before adding the salsa. The salsa was so good you can use it in other dishes. I added a dollop of the salsa to a basil, tomato and mozzarella salad to add a little zing, and my friends loved that too. I had to give up the recipe to that as well.
