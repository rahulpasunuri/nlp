This salad is as good as everyone says. It is absolutely perfect the way it is, don't change a thing. Slice the red onion as thin as possible. No matter what you serve, THIS is the recipe people will ask for.

This was just so-so. Followed the recipe exactly but found nothing outstanding about it. Didn't taste the prosciutto which was a waste of money.

Served this at a baptism yesterday and everyone loved it. However, we made a major modification - skipped the migas because we wanted it to be a little lighter. Also, did not use arugula, replaced romaine with frisee and added some red peppers. Simple and great. Will try the original next time.

I totally agree, this salad is awesome. I halfed the recipe and it was a perfect side salad for five. Ever see someone lick a salad bowl--My boyfriend did!

Fabulous. Pricey for a salad, but definately worth it. The best salad I've ever had.

Fantastic .... I throw in a little more proscuitto for more flavor - serve more migas and make it often as a whole meal.

My husband and I both loved this salad, I would recommend it to anyone! I followed the recipe exactly, using the balsamic vinegar and with the generous portion of prosciutto we thought it would be a great light main dish for a summer evening. This is a keeper, give it a try!

This is one of the best salads I've ever eaten.

Wow - really great salad. Note that you can do the 'migas' ahead of time, let cool, and keep separate, tossing with the salad when you are about to serve.

What a hit - I was asked for the recipe from several guests. Hubby doesn't like raw onions, so I carmelized them. It mellows out the taste a bit. I served it with a lamb recipe from your site (with red pepper relish). Definitely a keeper. Gwen

I made this salad when it was originally published in Bon Appetit. It is so good, I was thrilled to find the recipe again! It is so delicate and flavourful, yet complex.

This is the best salad I have ever made. It can't be beat. Now I make all the time and never seem to grow tired of it.

I have made this salad a number of times since finding it on this site last year and it has always been a huge hit, sometimes even overshadowing the main course. The flavors are wonderful!

I've made this salad several times, and always to ecstatic reviews. There are so many interesting flavors in it that people tend to eat quite a lot. While it nominally serves 10, I've seen 6 people polish it off. I wouldn't substitute for the arugula, which adds a lot of depth of flavor, or for the goat cheese, which is the high bright flavor note in this composition.

Well received. With make often.

What a great salad! The croutons are delicious; just the right amount of garlic flavor. Another nice thing about this dish is that the dressing is light and does not overwhelm the salad.

Oh, so good and different from the usual salad. I substitued baby greens for the arugula. This is a real standout dish.

For my husband's birthday, we served this wonderful salad along with the rest of the March '99 Birthday part menu. This is the best salad that I have made in a long time. It is very true to its preparation steps. It was so good that some of my guests wanted a third helping. Everyone was especially thrilled with the migas (croutons). The goat cheese was also a great idea. If you can't find it, you could substitute a creamy feta.
