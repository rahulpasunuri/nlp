I use more pepper and parmesan for extra flavor. This is a very simple,quick and delicious side dish for almost any protein. It's great paired with the garlic confit roasted chicken when the recipe was originally presented.

I made this again, substituting a little over a 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella (I used skim) instead of the parmesan and it was delicious...highly recommended for a quick side dish!

This is very simple but good. I added about three times the amount of parmesan and fresh black pepper. I think this would pair nicely with any simple protein and roasted vegetables dish. If nothing else, it's quick comfort food!

Not great; not bad; nothing special. I would make it again only if I was short on time.
