I just finished dumping out the bars down the disposal and shredding the recipe in the shredder. This was my first recipe in a series of items for Christmas trays! Ha! Where was the fudge? After following the recipe and the suggestions of others (and locating an 11x7 pan), I ended up with sweet cakey stuff that vaguely tasted of chocolate. The crust was flavorful, and if it wasn't that the "chocolate" goop was laying on top, I might have spooned some of that out. This reminds me (again) that I shouldn't make thing that only 75% of bakers would make again.

I thought this recipe was great...easy and yummy...perfect "comfort food" for me! I used semi-sweet chocolate, purchased graham cracker crumbs and salted butter (omitting the salt from the recipe) so I could use items on hand, and it turned out fine. Mine were very chewy, but kind of grainy from the suger but I loved them anyway! If you have a sweet tooth, this'll do the trick!

I took these bars to work and several people asked for the recipe. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips. It worked great.

These were to die for. I did, however, make some changes because of other reviews. Instead of using unsweetened chocolate, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and the sweetness was perfect. Also, I used three eggs instead of two so they would be a little more like brownies. I thought the texture was perfect this way and couldn't imagine them any more fudgy. Since I don't like nuts, I didn't use any and instead used one more graham cracker than called for. Since I (and my family) love graham cracker crusts, I think next time I'll make a little more crust, maybe one and a half times the amount. But these were the most delicious chocolate bars I have ever had.

A sure winner at any gathering. Rich, decadent and delicious

These were a big disappointment. The crust was potentially good but spoiled by the dry, bitter fudge topping. Despite the huge amounts of brown sugar and butter, the 'flat'one-dimensional flavour of the unsweetened chocolate came right through, leaving a harsh after-taste. I guess I just don't like brownies made with unsweetened chocolate alone. Just a small amount of bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate seems to mellow out & enrich the flavour. I wouldn't bother with these again although they were very easy to make.

I thought that these were fair, although my husband thought that they were great. I will make them again for him. ljc

Very good. It was a treat for everyone...we all had seconds. The crust is marvolous!

If you like chocolate, you won't find a more decadent treat than this. The graham crust is an amazing complement to the fudgy topping. Don't substitute margarine for the unsalted butter...it loses some of its flavor. Eat the "full-fat" version...it's worth the calories!!!
