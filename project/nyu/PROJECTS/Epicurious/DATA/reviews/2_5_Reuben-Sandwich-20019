Ya. I agree. Name is misleading. The cole slaw, however, is a NY thing to do with rebuens. A really good Russian dressing is a must. All that said---it's a really great way to deal with left over turkey! Beats the usual day after Thanksgiving turkey sandwich.

Where's the saurkraut? Get real - this isn't a Reuben by any stretch of the imagination.

Firstly, let me say that the Beard recipe is a travesty that we occasionally find in this country. The name Beard carries so much weight that whatever is associated with it is accepted as gospel. This happens with many very famous people's opinions. Next, let me say that to call this a Reuben is the same as calling cricket baseball. It is unfathomable to consider this anything other than a Rachael. Today is Reuben Sandwich Day in Minnesota: http://www.reuben_sandwich.blogspot.com/ I simply wanted to call a spade a spade.

I am a long-time fan of the Turkey Reuben - try it as described without ham, but add strawberry preservesor cranberry chutney. Delish!

Sounds good, but it's not a Reuben. Order a Reuben in any Jewish delicatessen -- you won't get this.

OK people. As it is stated below the recipe, it is a great way to use up some leftover turkey. I think that James Beard probably knows what a real Reuben is made of. So maybe the few egotistical commentators on this website should respect that this is simply a variation of the original; nothing more. Open your minds people.

To refer to this sandwich as a Reuben is a joke. I can see why some are insulted.

Why on earth would anyone rinse saurkraut??? Wouldn't that take all the flavor out, and make it bland cabbage?

This recipe is great for left over turkey etc. but the real thing... I am in agreement with Mr Schimmel.The tastiest and most original way to have a "Rueben" is with corned beef and Russian Dressing soaked saurkraut!

As a fifteen-year veteran line cook in Omaha restaurants, I am very glad that Mr. Schimmel, Jr. was the first to defend the name of the Reuben. The astute cdhays@yahoo almost has the correct name for this sandwich. It is a Rachel, but only if you remove the ham and grill the sandwich. While I mean no disrepect to Mr. Beard, for he does know good cooking, he doesn't know the real Reuben. This website should not shame the name of an Omaha original, or embarrass the name of a great cook by posting this recipe incorrectly.

James Beard, like the Reuben, is an American classic. To all those of you who don't think anyone should mess with the latter, there are an equal number who would be pretty put out at anyone messing with the former. So, call it a delicious recipe for a Rachel, look at what the inestimable Mr. Beard did for American cooking, and find another outlet for your frustration.

Lighten up. The sandwich is called a Rachael and it's commonly served in restaurants and enjoyed by those who desire lower fat content.

A travesty, agreed. What was Beard thinking? Use corned beef, of course; sauerkraut, washed thoroughly; rye or pumpernickel; usually Russian or French, but temper it with Dijon or deli mustard; and absolutely grill it in a cast iron pan. Incidentally, Omaha notwithstanding the Reuben was invented on 58th Street in Manhattan.

Substitute corned beef or pastrami for turkey and sauerkraut for cole slaw, grill and it may work; otherwise, ???

Oh c'mon guys - it may be misnamed, but it's a perfectly tasty sandwich! And it's quite nice grilled, too...

The name Reuben should not be given to this sandwich. It would confuse the very concept of the grilled delight. Instead, maybe it should be called the "Leftover Turkey Suprise" sandwich.

This is the most idiotic recipe for a reuben sandwich I have ever seen. It should be placed in the "Recipe Hall of Shame".

This sandwich is a fake. The true and original Reuben sandwich was make with corned beef. The item was born in Omaha when Blackstone Hotel innkeeper,Charles Schimmel,with one of his poker pals REUBEN [Kay] Koolakofsky make the sandwich with sauerkraut for Schimmel had run out of lettuce. Their poker games were played in "wee" hours of the AM. Schimel, then, grilled the item to mask the kraut taste and melt the cheese. The real secret of the receipe is to marinate the kraut in the Russian Dressing 24 hours prior to serving. I know, I am a nephew of this famous Schimmel and worked in the kitchens that made thousands and thousands of Reubens!
