This wasn't the worst dish I ever made, but that isn't saying too much. I followed the recipe to a T, and I agree with what others have said about the bland flavor and texture. I added a lot of dried dill and fried them up in a touch of olive oil like pancakes, but they were only marginally better. I will probably scramble the leftovers in with some eggs for breakfast. I don't plan on making again, though.

Like the other reviewers, I found this to be very bland and lacking textural variety. So, I took the leftovers (there was a LOT left uneaten) and made them into croquettes. I dredged them in an egg/milk mix, then a breadcrumb mix with cayanne pepper, garlic, and seasoning salt. I pan fried them in my cast-iron skillet (with reserved bacon grease and veggie oil) on medium turning occastionally until they were crispy on both sides. As a croquette, it was good, but I would not make this as a casserole again.

This was great. It turned out like a souffle. The goat cheese gave it a tart flavor that made it the best canned salmon recipe I have ever tasted.

I tweaked this recipe and really liked it. I used a 5 oz. can of evaporated milk instead of the low-fat milk, a sauteed mirepoix instead of just onions, and added a good shot of dill, salt and pepper to the mixture before baking it.

I'm gving this 4 forks because of ease of prepation and flexibility. From other reviews, just about anything can be substituted successfully as long as you stay with the liquid, eggs cheese, salmon ratio. I used buttermilk, feta,cream cheese and cottage cheese. had some store prepared mirepoix which I added raw probably would be better if I'd sauteed the veggies. I did not bother to mash the sweet potatoes and they added nice color. Good way to dispose of odds and ends. I like spicy food and this was acceptable to me and my bland food loving husband loved it. I'm giving it to a 2 yr old tomorrow to see how it goes over and am thinking of serving it to guests. I would prepare a dill sauce if serving to guests and add some fresh parsley and chives for color. If not for my husband I would have added a few drops of tabasco. Next time I will. It is bland for a spice lover.

This recipe isn't bad; it's just nothing special. On paper, it sounds delicious, but in reality, something is lacking. I will probably try it again and experiment with it a bit. Adding herbs or using a different cheese might help.

Recipe has potential. Potato and salmon is a great combination, but it needs something to kick in flavor. I added freshly sliced mushrooms and spicy goat cheese, which still did not do much for me. Next time, I could add canned green peas like someone else suggested, or sour cream, but it's hard to doctor up this dish without sacrificing the health value.

I thought this would make good comfort food during the miserable January Minnesota had. But I was wrong. Despite attempts to liven it up, it was very bland. It just made me feel more miserable.

I used fresh salmon and substituted the milk with water (for allergies reasons). It was a refreshing change from baked salmon fillets. My dinner guest (a vegetarian who's been feeling super tired of salmon) thought it was terrific too - a change from the ordinary.

I used feta instead of goat cheese, but otherwise I folled the recipe as written. I was underwhelmed. I won't make again.

This was nothing special. It was pretty bland. I used red onion since I didn't have any scallions and I added fresh dill since I had some on hand. It was like mashed potatoes with some salmon in it- more of a side dish than a main course. I wouldn't make it again.

I followed another cook's suggestion and used sweet potatoes and sauteed leeks. Also used skim milk. Delicious comfort food!

I have to admit I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I did the feta and cream cheese thing instead of goat cheese added some fresh oregano and peas. OK I think the thing is with this recipe it's one that you take and run with. Anyway, I will make it again using the proportions as a guide. I think this would be a great potluck dish.

I thought this recipe was delicious each time I made it. One time, instead of the goat cheese, I used equal amounts of feta and cream cheese blended together (which I had seen in another magazine as a recipe for "mock goat cheese". Several previous writers considered it bland, but my way to combat that(every time), is to make a briefly cooked sauce of fresh tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and perhaps fresh basil if I have it. It's a great combination. (Kind of a more sophisticated variation on salmon patties with ketchup). I never found it to be too fishy, and leftovers are great just reheated in the microwave.

We thought that it was a bit bland and the salmon to potatoe ratio was off. We never use canned salmon. The fresh is so much better and relatively inexpensive for what you need. Next time we will use more goat cheese and finely chopped asparagus.

This was definitely better the second day, but not that great overall. Following this recipe doesn't give this recipe enough flavor. I added capers and a lot more goat cheese just before serving to try to kick up the flavor.

I used sweet potatoes, fresh smoked salmon and leeks and it was lovely. If anything it was too moist and i'm hoping the leftovers will dry up.

I followed the recipe exactly, and was disappointed. If you took mashed potatoes, stirred in some canned salmon and baked it, the effect would be the same. But on a more positive note, my two nieces (ages 1 and 4) loved it--I guess because it was soft, creamy, and not too fishy.

The trick to this recipe and many casserole/pasta dishes in my opinion is that they are better the second day after they have a opportunity for the ingredients to blend. Especially when you have strong ingredients like goat cheese and salmon.

Very good casserole. I used this recipe as a springboard, really; didn't follow it to the letter. I had some oldish potatoes I needed to use up, so I used them all (more than 2 1/2 lbs.). I added light sour cream and used havarti with dill and spices instead of goat cheese. I really enjoyed this dish -- and my cat loved the juice and skin from the canned salmon!

Well, I somehow completely forgot to add the eggs, but it didn't seem to hurt the casserole. I also thought it would probably be a little bland as written, so I added herbes de Provence and cracked pepper, which really worked well with the goat cheese. And I wanted some veggies, so I tossed in dried carrots, which also worked well. I cut the potatoes down to just 1.5 lbs. Overall, I'd say that this is a decent basic recipe, but you should definitely expect to customize it to suit your own tastes. If all else fails, you can always add cheese!

Hey, folks, this is a good, basic, casserole -- don't expect fresh fish taste, but we don't get awesome salmon in the northeast! I thought it was too bland the first time so I reduced the amount of potatoes a bit (used 2 lb?) and it was fine. I also didn't use goat cheese; monterey jack was in the fridge so it went into the casserole. As another cook said, it's a good winter dish with lots of vegies on the side.

I substituted low-fat sour cream for the goat cheese, used a diced small white onion AND green onions and 3 average-sized potatoes. I liked it okay, my husband thought it was boring and needed some sour cream or something on top. If all you've got in your cupboard is canned salmon and potatoes, make salmon patties and roasted rosemary potatoes instead of this.

We thought this was delicious but I didn't have goat cheese and substituted low fat sour cream which perhaps made it moister. Also baked it in a deeper casserole dish.

The dish is very light, but is missing something... maybe next time I would add a bit of fresh dill and lemon and not so much cheese. The cheese and potato overpower the salmon... Dish has great appearance though.

Very bland and dry.

It was very dry... cook time can be less than a half hour in oven. needs some doctoring up, perhaps fresh chives and some sour cream. I did not think it was too "fishy" as others did. It's a good alternative to us that live in the desert when good fresh fish is not always avaialable

It's a great comfort food dish for my sis and I away @ college. Only added some garlic powder to the recipe.

I used fresh Copper River salmon (left overs) & an Italian sharp cheddar. It was wonderful. I doubt I'd ever make it with canned salmon.

This recipe really does have potential. Although it was tough for this native northwesterner to remove salmon from a can (vs using fresh product)and actually feed it to my family (instead of the cat), I am glad I did. I thought the dish was quite bland made according to the recipe. I used goat cheese and substituted Yukon Golds for Russet potatoes and served roasted asparagus and a green salad of frisee and dandelion greens on the side. I doctored up the leftovers by layering them with a bit of non fat sour cream, fresh chives and garlic powder then topped the whole thing off with a layer of homemade garlic and herb breadcrumbs whirled in the food processor. It was great. The added crunch and punch made a difference. When I make it again I will use goat cheese flavored with black pepper, fresh garlic and lemon juice in the potato mixture and use a breadcrumb topping like that mentioned above.

We did not like this dish. We typically eat fresh salmon, so I think that the canned salmon was a little too fishy tasting.

It was excellent and a new use for canned salmon other than patties. I substituted the goat cheese with grated parmesan, romano & swiss which blended really well with the other ingredients. No overwhelming fish taste which is good for my family! My co-workers ate the leftovers and asked for the recipe too.

This casserole was very good. I also substituted grated cheddar cheese for the goat cheese, as suggested by a reader. It is a good winter dish, accompanied by assorted vegetables and a salad.

I liked the recipe very much, but I added an additional can of salmon for a better salmon favor and I used red salmon instead of pink.

Easy,tasty one dish meal for a week night. One thought I had - the goat cheese flavor is very subtle - so subtle in fact, that for the price of goat cheese, the next time I make this I may try the same amount of cheddar. Add a bit of salt to avoid blandness.
