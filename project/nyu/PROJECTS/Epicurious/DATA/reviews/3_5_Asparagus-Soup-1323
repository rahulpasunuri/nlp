My husband and I loved this recipe. I added some minced garlic to it and did everything else according to the recipe. Tasted fantastic! Will definitely make again.

Despite following a number of suggestions to boost the flavor, this simple recipe lacked impact. I added garlic, a bit of lemon juice, herbes de Provence, kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, and swirled in some low fat sour cream at the end, after first tasting the ungarnished version. It's nice, but needs a lot of tinkering if you like a soup that has more depth. I agree that the chicken broth quality is key; Pacific brand organic chicken broth is good. I will save this one to serve cold with some herb crostini as a starter on a very hot day.

I've made this extremely simple yet flavorful soup a few times now - eating low carb, I omit the flour and use a little less stock to keep it thick. The biggest improvement I made was using lemon pepper when adding the asparaus, as well as some crushed garlic. And ALWAYS use my own chicken stock. My 2.5 year old daughter went nuts eating helping after helping saying "this is delicious!" - I've never heard her use that word :-)

Oh my yum! This recipe is wonderful! It's healthy and delicious-- what's not to love? It's super simple and has a wonderful earthy, natural asparagus flavor that nourishes & pleases. If you think it's too simple, you could throw in some crisp bacon bits or carrots. But I wouldn't change a thing.

This is terrible with the wrong broth. Results with Safeway low-fat, low-sodium broth are awful, but it's good with Safeway Organics low-sodium. Adding back all the broth yields four cups of soup. Yummy paired with a goat cheese and roasted red pepper sandwhich grilled with EVOO.

This soup is very good and easy - but you should modify based on other reviews. The potato over the flour is definitely the way to go, and I think the savory adds the right flavor. I also added a couple of big roasted red peppers from the jar and pureed everything with a stick blender. The peppers added some smokiness and made it a nice orange color. Excellent!

I took some of the ideas added by other cooks - added a potato, some Italian herbs and a little bit of skim milk at the end. I also used tinned asparagus, so did not need to prepare it in any way. I'm really not a huge fan of asparagus, but loved this soup. It was a hit at work, too with my coworker who had had recent oral surgery.

I made some adjustments and the soup was FAB! Doubled the onion & added a big garlic clove. Used 1/2 the stock but made it strong. Skipped the flour and added a potato 10 mins before the asparagus. Used 1.5 x the asparagus and only simmered it 12 mins (fresher flavour). Added juice of 1/4 lemon and 1.5 cups skim milk at the end. Used my immersion blender to whip up the whole shebang and seasoned with lots of S&P. Served hot the same day and cold the next with light sour cream - very YUMMY!

I made a few changes but this soup is the BOMB! No flour or chicken broth in the house so I boiled the vegetables. Spooned out to puree sea salt, lemon pepper, 1/2 stick butter, olive oil, fresh lemon zest,asparagus with a whole leak, fresh spinach (to keep it green) and a few whole garlic bulbs. Oh MY GOD!!! The layers of flavor are amazing!

wonderful. At another raters suggestion, used shallots instead of onion. Also reserved all of the liquid and slowly added to blender 1/2 cup at a time until desired consistency. dolloped with tablespoon of Greek yogurt in each serving. Served chilled. rave reviews.

I made a slightly plus version of the recipe, substituted Herbs of Provance for the Summer Savory and added a half pound of crab meat at the end. It was wonderful. My wife and I ate the whole thing for dinner (I had a bowl and a half) along with a salad and a bottle of Australian Semillon - Sauvignon Blanc. Great dinner!

Great simple recipe. I did not have summer savory, so I used a citrus-pepper blend instead (a pricey, upscale version of lemon pepper). Added a spoonful of fat-free sour cream to garnish. Simple but satisfying. If you want a richer soup, just add a cup or so of heavy cream or half-and-half at the end. My only suggestion: Do not cook the asparagus for 25 minutes or it will be mushy and will lose its lovely green color. 10 minutes max is more like it, just until the spears can be pierced with a fork. Also, I would coarsely chop the onion so that you can easily lift both the onion and asparagus out of the soup pot to puree them in the food processor.

I have read the reviews on this receipe and all I have to say is that it is a fantastic base for any veggie soup!!! THE KEY TO ANY SOUP LIKE THIS IS A GOOD CHICKEN BROOTH!!!!! If you dont use a good one your might as well quite, and that is the only reason that I can come up for all the discourage people. Added spices, herbs, wine, garlic, etc are great, and I used my own version. I used sour cream and chives/green onion on top to garnish, but I would use greek yogurt if you can get access to it. I served with white wine, fresh italian bread, lacey swiss cheese, and fresh fruit. However, while this receipe is not large enough for dinner portions for 4, it is big enough for appetizer sizes when serving a meal after the soup. What I wonder is if it is better the day after? For those who did not like this receipe, my recommendation is to use a different vegetable and a good brooth. Add a little half and half (a couple of tbs) to the soup at the end to refine it if you want a more finished touch. THIS IS A GREAT RECEIPE!!!

this was so delicious and relatively low fat. I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I instead of the herbs they called for, I added oregano, marjoram, a pinch of mustard powder and a tablespoon of lemon juice at the end. I also used a hand blender in the pot and though the consistency was great. I would definitely try other veggies using this base in the future.

Rating: 4
The base of this soup is low fat and excellent for just about any vegetable chosen to use. I have used it for mushroom soup, carrot soup, spinach soup and broccoli soup. I often substitute thyme as the herb.

Great soup! - my husband and I each had 2 bowls - but I did make a few small changes: - Added back all the liquid, it has so much great flavor and the soup kept it's consistency - Used a blender instead of food processor (find this to be easier and make all my pureed soups this way) - Used 1 t dried Tarragon and 1/2 t ground coriander as seasoning in place of savory - Added 2 cloves minced garlic to broth and 1/4 cup dry white wine before cooking. I would definately recommend this as a nice alternative to plain old steamed asparagus! I was fun to slurp down this veggie!

This soup is great. I've made it with summer savory, substituted chives, parsley, skipped herbs altogether and it's always tasty. Thanks to the other reviewers, I don't even bother trying to add the liquid back a bit at a time, just put it all in the blender. (I've tried a hand blender and like the consistency in the standard blender better.) I've also reduced some white wine in a separate pan and added a bit which made it richer, but truthfully, I rarely do it. Prefer the yogurt to sour cream, but both work. Also sometimes sprinkle parmesean cheese on top.

We thought this was fantastic! I listened to the other reviewers and practically tripled the recipe--or at least the asparagus--and also used Herbs of Provence since I had it on hand. I thought it was delicious and easy. I look foward to making it again.

Quick easy and so boring!There is no way to "fix" or "save" this soup. I am going to feed it to our dogs. Perhaps, they will eat it if I mix it with meat scraps or other treats.

A Cook from atlanta.ga on 11/09/03 I've been looking for a really good cream of asparagus soup for my vegetarian friends. This soup is fabulous, very easy and of course, since I want it creamed just add cream at end. My whole family loves it. PS you can substitue broccoli and get cream of broccoli for the asparagus and still get the great vegetable taste.Many thanks for listing this basic recipe.

This is a quick, easy recipe that looks like you went to a lot of work. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding some fresh garlic when sauteing the onions and then I added some white wine with the chicken broth.

Very delicious. I made this soup for 6 people. I ended up doubling the recipe but had to add 3 pounds of asparagus instead of 2. It made 6 small servings. I added shallots, onion, and garlic. I couldn't find Summer Savory so I used the Herbs of Provence. I also added quite a bit of salt and pepper - more so than I would usually add. Also, it's def. better made in advance.

I have made this soup twice. It was delicious both times. The recipe did not yield 6 servings, as a matter of fact it just barely served 4. I will make it again, but will double the recipe to serv 4 people. I added a dollop of sour cream and it was perfect.

This was superb. I used a bit more onion than called for and also added two small shallots, some fresh-ground white pepper and a touch of white wine. Then I finished the whole thing off with about 2 oz. of half 'n' half. It was elegant and had a great asparagus flavor. Definitely a keeper.

I didn't follow the directions for the draining, etc. I just used my stick blender and whizzed it up which seemed easier and less clean up. I used more asparagus that it called for. Good and easy!

For some reason, this soup really didn't work out for me. I followed the recipe exactly (adding only 1/2c. coooking liquid) at it was too thick, so I added more. Still it tasted like terrible, overcooked asparagus goo, nothing like some of the delicious, fresh tasting versions I've had in restaurants. Odd, given the stellar reviews. Maybe I made some kind of mistake, or maybe it was a bad idea to try to make this soup in january instead of in the spring!

I have made this soup for two different dinner parties. It tastes so rich and it is easy to make. I just made it this past weekend for 12 people (tripled the recipe) & it turned out great.

Don't make the mistake I did. After cooking the asparagus you throw out all the cooking liquid except the half cup that goes into the blender. You do not return the puree to the liquid you cooked the asparagus in. Otherwise this comes out tasting like dishwater, like mine did. Silly me.

Rating: 4
Absolutely loved it. You'd never know it wasn't cream-based! I added a little more garlic, adjusted the amout of liquid added back to get a perfect, smooth consistency, and finished it for presentation with a litle dollop of sour cream, fanned out. I'd recommend doubling the recipe. So easy but really impressive! :)

I've made this soup four times since finding the recipe on your site. It is just perfect for anyone who is on a low fat diet. You would never know it didn't have cream in it. I added grated nutmeg and a spoonful of chicken base and it is just terrific.

i kind of used this recipe as a jumping-off point -- i varied a number of things: shallots instead of onion, no savory (didn't have any), a couple pinches of saffron in the broth (vegetable instead of chicken), and a couple of little white potatoes, cubed, thrown in at the same time as the asparagus. basically a simpler version of the saffron & asparagus soup featured elsewhere on this site, and it turned out wonderfully.

Super..thanks CT., the addition of garlic really worked...Ipeeled the spears and only used lots of ground coriander for spice. A good broth is necessary. Enjoy!

This soup is easy and very tasty. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and shallots for the onion. I steamed the asparagus tips separately, then tossed them in at the end for a bit of crunch. You can add 1/2 cup cream at the end if you want a richer soup.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Just 2 thoughts--I usually snap each asparagus spear at its natural breaking point; this technique may have left too little asparagus for the recipe, because I had to add more cooked and pureed spears at the end to punch up the taste. Next time, I would use 2 pounds or more. I also advise against adding all the liquid--it will dilute the asparagus taste too much--just keep adding and tasting until you achieve a texture and taste you like. With extra asparagus and about 2/3 of the liquid, I got 6 modest servings, just right for a first course.

I was a little disappointed in this soup given all the great reviews. It is extremely easy and quick which is nice. I guess it just didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I used an immersion blender and might try food processor next time for a silkier texture.

I loved how easy this excellent soup is to prepare. But I agree with the cook from New Canaan--this recipe will not serve six, even as a first course (unless you plan to use demitasse cups).

What a great soup...I'm thrilled asparagus is coming back in season as we will be eating this soup often. I did find thought that it didn't make very much - the whole recipe made two hearty portions. Next time I'm going to double it so I have leftovers.

This was a very creamy tasting soup! I added 2 minced garlic cloves when sauteeing the onions, used fat free chick. broth, pureed the soup all together and stirred in 1/4 cup non-fat sour cream to the mixture. Will definitely make again. Great with fresh bread & salad!

Truly a wonderful soup! It must be the simplicity that makes it so good but, whatever the reason, this is a must-have whenever the asparagus looks good enough! I made it for Christmas dinner this year and perfectly accomodated the vegetarians and the meat-eaters at the table (and it could easily be made vegan using margarine instead of butter). This will be a standard winter dinner with salad and a good french bread or as a first course... yum!

The soup was excellent and very easy to make. I used left over cooked asparagus and just reduced cooking time to 10 minutes. I, too, used all the left over liquid and added it at the end. My husband is on his second cup. We will definitely have this again!

Absolutely wonderful! Simple, tasty, elegant. I've halved the recipe (made three servings instead of the six stated) and you definitely need to add more chicken broth (an additional 1/2 cup) in this instance. I've also made 4 times the recipe (24 servings)and in this instance following the recipe x 4 yields the right amount of broth.

Rating: 4
I agree with all the other cooks that this recipe is fabulous. I think it is a very flexible recipe. I didn't have summer savory, so I used ground savory and it worked beautifully. Also, I added ALL the liquid back, then added about 1/4-1/2 cup milk. The soup still retained a great consistency. Also, I reserved the asparagus tips and added them at the last minute. My husband just raved over this soup. With my changes, we got 4 servings.

Excellent recipe. I used chicken broth with roasted garlic, herbs de provence, and added about 1/2C crab meat as was suggested by a previous viewer. Also kept the asparagus tips separate and cooked them in the pureed soup for about 3 minutes. Topped with chopped fresh chives and shredded lovage.

This is delicious! Tastes rich, yet has minimal fat in it. I used a teaspoon of Southwestern seasoning instead of Savory. I used all the liquid, not just 1/2 cup. After ladeling it into the bowls, I added a small amount of crab meat. Superb! I will serve it at my next dinner party!

Very good and easy to make. I also added Provencal herbs and got great results. As for the amount of stock needed, I just threw everthing into the food processor and got a soup that was perfect in its consistency. You could even add more stock if you want a lighter texture.

This soup tastes and looks fantastic. We tried it the other day for the first time, and our guests were all impressed. One thing that confused me (and obviously some of the people below) was the amount of liquid that needs to be returned to the pureed asparagus mixture. As the instructions were unclear, I added the mixture back a little at a time, keeping the soup over a low flame and constantly stirring to confirm consistency. I returned almost all of the liquid back into the mixture, getting a yield of 5 decent-sized bowls of soup of a good consistency. I drizzled a circle of fresh cream on top and tossed on a spray of finely chopped fresh parsley to add a different shade of green to the presentation. Yum!

This was really easy to make but the flavor (and the color!) were wonderful. I used Herbs de Provence instead of savory and pureed it in the blender for a smoother texture. I also added back in more liquid than 1/2 cup and still wound up with only 2 large servings.

Just don't get carried away with the savory, it takes away the taste from the asparagus if you use more than recipe calls for
