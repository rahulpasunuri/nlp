LOVE THIS RECIPE!

The Tostadas were excellect, followed recipe with the addition of cumin and lime juice to taste to the Chicken mixture. Used romaine instead of iceberg. Be sure to serve with a wedge of lime for spritzing the the salad topping. Next time, will broil corn tortillas till crisp. Prep to finish, about 1 hour

I made this exactly to the recipe and it was outstanding. My only complaint is the "active" time it took to prepare -- a little over two hours. Will definitely make again, when I have lots of time to prepare a meal.

Easy and delicious! Will definitely make again.

This was excellent! I will definitely make this again. Instead of a rotisserie chicken, I used 1 1/2 lb. ground turkey. After reading other reviews about bland sauce, I decided to add some orange peppers I had on hand to the roasting pan and spicy chipotle seasoning while browning the ground turkey. Served on store bought tostadas, after crisping in the oven. Black beans and rice on the side. SO GOOD.

I make this almost weekly, yet I agree with other reviewers that tomato and onion puree is not worth the extra effort. Instead I would recommend either making your own pico de gallo and adding a little to both the chicken and refried beans. Otherwise, very delicious.

Very easy to make and so yummy!! Would work even better as a soft taco.

Recipe is very good, with one exception - the roasted tomato salsa is bland and boring. Will use a much better recipe for the salsa next time. Used store bought tostada shells to save time and they were awesome. Love the combination of flavors and textures!

Rating: 3
This was really good, although I do agree with many of the other reviewers... the salsa wasn't really anything all that special. Next time I think I will try what one other reviewer suggested and use chipotle! This is a recipe I will definitely make time and time again... just with a few tweaks.

I did the recipe exactly as stated, using all of the recommended toppings, but used store-bought tostadas instead of frying my own. Overall, it was a great midweek meal. I made the Green Poblano Rice from this site, as well as roasted corn on the cob next to it and it was great. The kids loved it, although the salsa was a little spicy (with one serrano pepper), so I left some plain chicken for the younger ones. The only reason I didn't give it a 4 is that I personally didn't think that the salsa was all that, I may try to change it around next time or add more spices to it, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it was a little bland. Once you eat everything together, it is pretty good, but maybe adding some cumin, chili powder or something would make it pop more. I'd definitely make it again though!

This is absolutely fabulous! The roasted tomato sauce is divine. I've done it as written and also with chipotles to give it a smokey edge. Either is sublime. This is a go-to quick weeknight dinner for us! Yum!

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have any peppers or veggies (Aside from tomatoes and lettuce and avocado) but that worked too. I bought the store bought tostadas and a hot sauce at the store to save time. I baked the chicken in the oven and then cut in shredded pieces, mixed it with diced tomatoes and onions and that was my chicken mix. We loved this for a lunch meal or you can do it for dinner.

We really enjoyed these. I bought Tostadas pre-made and heated them in the oven to save time. Served with lime wedges and salsa. I only used 1 of the serrano chiles and that was plenty!

Wow. Everyone in the family agrees.

We paired it with the tortilla soup, what a delicious dinner! The chicken was just spicy enough. We just use shredded mexi cheese, its what we had. It will be added into the dinner rotation. Made my duaghters without the spice and mine with vegetarian fake chicken.

This was amazing. I used 2 jalapenos instead of serrano chiles -- and threw both in the blender with the roasted veggies. I omitted the sour cream and cheese and salt to the tomato/onion/chick mixture. I'm not sure about frying the tortillas individually, though. This took a really long time. Next time I will pop them in the oven on a cookie sheet (less authentic, but more practical when you have hungry people to feed). This will definitely go on my regular rotation.

The tostadas were good, a nice weekday dinner, but they didn't blow my mind. A good standby, but not fit for a special ocassion.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! A little more work than usual for a weeknight meal with three little ones, but well worth it. Plus the children can pick and choose what they would like on their tostada. The sauce that comes out of the roasted veggies has an exceptional flavour. I burned the crap out of my chiles, but used one anyway (I think they were thai - what I had) it was super hot and wonderful. I will definitely make this again, a little work, just all these little steps, nothing too arduous. Lots one could do in advance.

Rating: 4
This recipe is spectacular!!! I roasted my own chicken and refried my own red beans (dried) the first time i made it. The second time, i used a purchased rotisserie chicken and refried my own black beans (dried). It was great both times and i'm sure will be prepared in my home many times in the future. It is easy enough for a weeknight.

This was good, but not as amazing as I was expecting based on other reviews. I probably won't make it again.

Amazing! I normally NEVER go by the recipe but this time I did and WOW!!! My husband is Mexican (growing up around authenticity) and had nothing but good things to say about this dinner!! Will make for next Get-Together with Friends/Family!!!

I didn't have serrano chiles but had some bottled red jajapenos. Also, used normal gem lettuce and made my own refried beans as I realised they weren't JUST kidney beans! Also, used some Swedish cheese. It was easy to make and we enjoyed it. My friend asked for the recipe. I served it with virgin margarita (Organic Belvoir Lemonade with lime and salt on the rim of the glass) and beer Sol.

Great Tostados, Layers of flavor. I made a few changes though. I already had a tomato jalapeno salsa made so I used that. Added lime zest and juice to the sour cream. I used thinly sliced cabbage instead of lettuce for more crunch and just before serving put a little lime juice over the cabbage with a little salt. Wow!!

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. My husband can't eat tomatoes, so I left the chicken plain and used the roasted tomato combo as a salsa. This was good hot for dinner and cold for lunch the next day.

My husband and I made this with black beans (instead of refried beans) and nonfat Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream), and it was fantastic! Definitely a keeper!

I didnt like these much. They were a bit bland. I used only half the tomatoes, but overall this seemed to hardly have any flavor.

Rating: 4
Wow! This recipe is fantastic - it will be the mexican food go to meal for me from now on. Made as is but I would use a little bit less raw onion in the slaw next time. As another reviewer recommended - store bought tostadas save time and still are delicious. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

I reviewed this in 2008 but had to add a comment. We love this recipe but I've made some adjustments to make it easier and thought I'd share. I buy the ready made corn tostadas from El Ranchera (available at most groceries). I put all veggies including any peppers(I add extra) under the broiler or on the grill depending on the season. Then I blend with a stick blender-a wonderful invention- and add other ingredients to the bowl. Less clean up. The recipe as is , is mild so if you like a spicier tostada add a good salsa or more herb/peppers.

Rating: 0
Very good, i might add some spices to the chicken mixture next time though. I also put grated cheddar on the beans instead of the other cheese. It was perfect.

Rating: 3
This has become a staple summer dish when we have leftover chicken - and we sometimes plan our meals just so we have leftover chicken to make this! We use regular store-bought shredded Mexican cheese mix. We always have leftovers, so halving the recipe is a good idea.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Absolutely delicious! But a warning - not date food. It is incredibly messy & try not to over fry the tortillas because the extra crunchiness only makes the messiness worse.

Rating: 4
We made this as the recipe called excepted we replaced iceberg with mixed greens and it was wonderful. If you want a taste of delicious mexican food that isn't smothered in cheese and sauce but has a delicate balance of flavors...try this. It pleases.

Rating: 4
I loved the chicken mixture, the flavors were very complimentary. My only complaint is the amount of smoke that waas produced by frying the tostadas. It took hours for all of the smoke to clear. Next time, I will likely bake the tortillas to keep the smoke and the grease down a bit more. Will definitely make again!

I've served this over and over...everyone loves it! Quick and easy...perfect for a weeknight! Dos serranos make it a little piquante for some.

Rating: 4
I have never had a tostada in my life, but I like to try new things. This was outstanding! I used feta cheese instead of the mexican cheese and the saltiness was perfect! This isn't something I normally would make, but the flavors are melded together perfectly. This is a winner!

Really good! and for the guy from portland who said its a bit bland, try adding a load of salsa valentina (mexican hot sauce) for a real kick and a squeeze of lemon. its one of my fave mexican recipes and we make it all the time with sopa azteca..easy and delish!!

Very good recipe. The roasted salsa is yummy--I only used 1 pepper but should have used 2 since roasting diminishes the heat. Otherwise.....this was a hit at my house!

This was excellent. I used premade corn tostadas which shortened time and mess. The chiles added a nice kick. Next time I will probably put some salsa on as well. The nice thing is that leftovers can be used for salads.

very boring and not flavorful as is. improved greatly with seasoning. used chili powder and cumin. the hot chilis are great for flavor in the salsa as well so make sure you use them! also sliced the avocado and squeezed lime juice on them for an added taste.

Excellent and really not that hard to pull together on a weeknight! I boiled and shredded my own chicken, and I couldn't find serrano chilies but any chili with some heat will do. I also followed the other suggestions of adding some cumin to the tomato mixture. A keeper!

I have made this several times and love it! Last time I substituted Trader Joe's fresh roasted Cabo salsa in place of roasting your own and it was fabulous - quick and easy! I'll do that again next time to cut the prep time way down. You won't be disappointed with this one!

This was great- we make fish tostadas alot and will try this recipe with fish next time. I also added cumin to the tomato mix and the salad, along with adding lime juice to the salad and it gave it an even fresher taste. Will make again.

My teenagers loved this. I've made this twice now and was unable to use serranos this time and really found it missing something. We also didn't have the radishes which I wont forget again. It is still good without these but just didn't have the punch. It does take 45 minutes to an hour but it's worth it. A great summer meal.

Fabulous... made as directed and loved every bite. I also served a side os ground beef with taco seasoning just for an option, and it got rave reveiws as well!

This was delicious. We used whole wheat tortillas and it was just as good. We've made it two weeks in a row now! The first time I forgot the salt, which is definitely needed to bring out all the flavors. This is a keeper!

I did not love the flavors in the chicken mix as much as I wanted to. Just so-so overall. probably not a keeper in my kitchen.

My BF said this was a keeper. I made it exactly as written with the exception of the serrano chiles since they've all been removed from the grocery store. So I used a couple of jalepenos purchased prior to the warnings and it was ok, but I'll try with the serranos next time. I also thought this was a bit labor intensive, not difficult but it did take some time to get everything ready. Delicious though!

Rating: 4
I don't usually do this but I have to share-- this recipe inspired me to make a tostada that was fantastic & simple, but mostly unrelated to this recipe. Shredded chicken tossed with cumin, cilantro, & lime juice; refried beans, guacamole (avocado, lime juice, cilantro, salt, jalepeno, onion), cheese, lettuce, tomato on a fried tortilla. So good!

Definitely a keeper. Easy and delicious. To make it more diet-conscious I used whole wheat tortillas, non-fat refried black beans and low fat sour cream. If you want to reduce the fat even more, you can bake instead of fry the tortillas. We're using the leftovers for soft tacos.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did use both peppers and it was perfect. The only change I made was adding red cabbage to the salad mixture. It added more color and crunch. This will go into my make again list!!

These were delicious. Even the teenagers liked them. Used black beans instead of refried. I used 1.5 serano peppers but 2 would have been better. The Mexican cheese was interesting and worth the money. Tastes a bit like parmesan with a softer texture.

This was great! You won't be disappointed - not terribly difficult, or spendy - a really good solid meal. I used white cheddar instead of cotija (less expensive and still a good cheese.) And my kids won't touch radishes, so we left those out. Will definitely make this again!

My husband and I both LOVED this dish. I substituted black beans for refried beans; wheat tortillas for corn tortillas; and jalapenos for serranos. On our second tostada, we dolloped some of the leftover sauce on top and it was very tasty, better than the first. Will definitely be making this dish again soon.

These tostadas were delicious. Substituted whole black beans for refried beans to suit my husband's taste. The salsa was delicious and very spicy (I don't see how it could come out bland) but I used 1.5 whole roasted serranos. Overall a great dish.

Overall a good and easy recipe. Only downside was that the tomato puree was on the bland side. Tortilla frying worked perfectly.

Absolutely fantastic. I made the recipe exactly as written (except I skipped the radishes). I had no experience with queso anejo until now. Both the spouse and I were extremely impressed. Very easy to make, and worth every fork! If you like well-made tacos with good, fresh ingredients, you will LOVE this.
