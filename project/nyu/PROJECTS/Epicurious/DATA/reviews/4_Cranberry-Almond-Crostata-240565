good but tart...needs whipped cream on side. Used 1C ground almond meal. Just used topping as crumble (much easier but I suppose not as pretty). All I had was orange pineapple marmalade and it was fine. Baked convection 350 x 45min.

I just made another of her Crostata recipes with a very similar crust, and this should call for 3/4 cup of almonds, not 1/8. I know this was mentioned in other reviews but I wanted to make a specific point about it. (Since I didn't make this recipe, I can't really rate it, but don't want to "skew" the fork rating, so I gave it 3 forks which is what I would give the other crostata recipe.)

This will be the fourth time I've made this and is now a tradition for Thanksgiving. Absolutely love it and has always turned out picture perfect from following the recipe. There are never any leftovers. I highly recommend serving it with a lightly whipped Cointreau or brandy cream.

I would have liked more almond flavor in the crust, even though I already doubled the almond extract to 1/4 t and followed Marilyngov's hint to use 5/8 c almonds  next time I would try 1/2 t extract. I would also increase the sugar in the crust a bit: it was pie-dough like, but I'd prefer it a bit more cookie-like. Overall, not sure it was worth all that grinding, blending, freezing, rolling.

Worth the work. . . as mentionned in previous reviews the recipe had some problems but it was delicious. Every bit dissappeared at the Thanksgiving table.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was amazing. Everyone loved it and any leftover dough would make great cookies.

I used almond meal (1 cup) instead of weighing and grinding the almonds, which worked really well. I couldn't find cranberries (not quite the right time of year, I suppose), so I substituted frozen cherries, and used cranberry juice and cranberry preserves so that it wouldn't get too sweet. I added a little flour to the filling while it was cooking since it didn't look thick enough on its own. It turned out really well, and I'd love to try it as-written once I can find cranberries!

Thankfully, I read the reviews before making the crostata: thanks to Marilyngov for her corrections. The crostata was the hit of my "pi day" affair on Mar 14. The small piece that was left over until the next day survived quite well.

I used leftover fresh cranberry sauce my usband made for anksgiving and supplemented with frozen pie cherries and outstanding. Watch the almond crust carefully...it browns very quickly. Many raves around the table.

The crosata was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. My sister, niece, nephew, and I made 3 pies, but was the one we photographed! The crust was delicious and handled well; we used dried cranberries, dried cherries, and a chopped-up orange to replace the orange marmalade. Looking forward to variations with mincemeat, raspberries, and cherries.

This was excellent, but the recipe has a few problems (typos?). First, 1/8 cup almonds is not equal to 1/4 lb. I weighed mine, and 1/4 lb. was more like 5/8 cup. I used that amount and the results were great. Also, when you cut a 12" round of the crust into 10 strips, they cannot be 1/3" wide. I made mine 1/2" wide and still had plenty of dough to spare. The result was a crust like you see in the photo. And finally, if you trim the dough in the pan to only 1/2", the filling would spill over. You can see by the photo that the tart is more like 1" high; that is what I did and with excellent results. All that chilling and freezing of the dough looks like a lot of trouble, but it really makes the dough a lot easier to work with.

I did make this as one of three desserts for a party. It was outstanding and the crust worth the extra effort - compared to a standard butter or lard pie crust. I did double the filling as after preparing the first batch, it looked scant so I quickly doubled the recipe. Definitely will be making this again at Christmas.

I didn't make the crostata yet; even though the ingredients look delicious, it seems like an unnecessarily complicated way of making a much simpler pie, equally good.
