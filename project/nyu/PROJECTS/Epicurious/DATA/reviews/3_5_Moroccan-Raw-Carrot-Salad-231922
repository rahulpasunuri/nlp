This is amazing salad and easy to make. I am now regularly doubling the recipe. It occurred to me that peanuts loom large in African-influenced cuisine, so I added 1/4C melted peanut butter to the doubled recipe dand, OMG--even more amazing!!! Next time I will try chopped peanuts instead of the peanut butter, but my oh my, it will be hard to beat!

Easy salad for a weeknight dinner. Made this recipe as written, but didn't use cinnamon. Added a little honey to cut the acidity. A nice change to mayonaise based salads.

Good, easy. Shredded the carrots in the food procssor. Doubled the cumin, added 1 tsp chili powder, and 1 tsp sugar - only because it was pretty acidic without that (and I am a lemon lover). I drained the shredded carrots for about 30 minutes before mixing with the dressing.

This was good, light, and refreshing compared to other carrot salads that use mayo. It was also easy, I did the carrots in the food processor. I doubled the cumin and added 1/2 tsp. of chili powder. It was a bit acidic for my husbands taste so I added 2 tsp agave syrup (you could add sugar).

really good. i made it without the cinnamon and added some extra harissa. i served it with grilled lamb chops. a delicious meal.

Instead of grating the carrots, I just use a vegetable peeler and peel the whole carrot into nice shavings. I use orange juice instead of lemon, cilantro, not parsley, cumin not cinnamon and no harissa because I really dislike it. I also add raisins. It's much better the second day.

There is only one thing to say about this: YUM! It's easy, too!!

Excellent recipe! I will make this again and again! I added extra cumin and the juice of 3 clementines along with the lemon to add a bit of sweetness. YUMMY!

Easy, quick using packaged carrot shreds, and a perfect combination of spices and flavors. Fresh parsley is imperative, not dried. Make ahead at least one day so the flavors can marry. B.J. Harrick

Pleasant. We ate it 30 minutes after making and it definitely needs to marinate longer. Don't skimp on fresh herbs here, they are essential. Next time I'll try orange juice, I think some sweetness would be nice here.

This recipe is fantastic! When I read the ingredients it doesn't sound that appealing, but it works. It is very authentic as well. It gets better after it sits for a bit. The flavors meld beautifully. Absolutely delicious! Love it!

Thank you to all of you who led us to try this. This recipe and all its variations is outstanding. Very flavorful, each variation is unique. I like carrots well enough, but traditional carrot salads are a bore to me. This recipe and its variations are superb. I have my own variation, which is to follow the basic recipe and then add toasted slivered almonds and orange or tangerine pieces. I found the ratio of spices here very balanced and exquisite. For an easy and very exciting dish, try this one. We loved it. Highly recommended. Best to you!

This recipe looked as if it had potential. I think it was the cinnamon that did it in. Yech! Perhaps that combination was just not good for me. I guess it must appeal to the tastes of others.

Very good, but I thought a bit oily. I found out by accident that it makes a very good slaw if you add some golden raisins and slivered almonds!

Great recipe. I use more garlic than they ask for because I'm a garlic freak; the combination of it with the carrots is great. The cumin and paprika also add an extra zing. It's a fantastic way to use up extra carrots.

I am not a big carrot fan, but I really liked this recipe. It has a wonderful, almost exotic spice flavor. This was wonderful to take for lunch as a cold veggie side to a sandwich or soup.

I really liked this recipe and my friends did also. It was really easy to make and so tasty! I took another reviewers advice and used Trader Joe's carrots, which I would highly recommend doing. They stayed crunchy, even the leftovers! I would also recommend using only 3 T of lemon juice, as I thought 4 was a bit too acidic for my tastes, but I'm sure many people would still enjoy it that way. I also had to use dried parsley (adjusting the amt used), being a college kid on a budget, but it was still delicious. I would have preferred to use the fresh stuff, though! I'm excited to try some of the variations now.

Super easy to make, excellent picnic salad. I strongly recommend making it at least a day before you want to use it.

I liked this a lot. I also made the Turkish version with yogurt, very fresh and delicious. The next time I will add some orange segments.

Seasonings needed a little adjusting, but had very good flavor. In order to make this dish more substantial I mixed it with some couscous and olives - I highly recommend it!

Made the Moroccan version - nice. Crisp, clean easy. Would make again. Made the Turkish version - the yogurt and olive oil made slimy texture. Might try it again without the olive oil. Otherwise, I would not eat it as is.

I enjoyed this, but didn't think it was as special as the other reviews suggested. I might make it again. I used the cinnamon/cumin mix; the cinnamon and garlic ended up being dominant flavors. Next time I would probably increase the parsley and harissa a little bit.

Delicous and very easy, even if you take the extra 15 minutes to cook and strain the carrots.

A delicious twist to the classic carrot salad and still healthy. I made it two times and everybody loved it. The only comment would be to start with two cloves of garlic. Then taste it and if you think it needs more, you can always add some.

I made this for a family dinner a couple weeks ago. A couple minor changes though for me: I cut the carrots into thin coins, and did not add harissa. I let it marinate overnight in the regrigerator, then took it out an hour before serving. It was a hit beyond my imagination. I am making this salad again tonight to serve tomorrow.

We made this for a dinner with friends who were staying with us. My friend, who is a great cook, and I adjusted the recipe slightly for our particular tastes -- we like spice and strong flavors -- by adding some additional cumin, cinnamon, salt and throwing in some preserved lemon. We also added a little honey as the carrots weren't the sweetest. Because we had lots of carrots we made a double batch. It was such a hit -- and these are serious foodies -- that there was very little left and what was went into braised lentils to add flavor and interest. Shred the carrots in a food processor and this is quick and easy to make. It will be a staple in our refrigerator in summer.

This salad is absolutely fantastic. A great way to use up extra carrots. I didn't have harissa, so I minced a few chili peppers in abdobo sauce. I aslo added pineapple just because I had one. It added a refreshing sweetness to the spicy flavors. I had some no-shows at our dinner party and ended up with about two cups leftover salad. I decided to experiment and see if it would work as a carrot soup. WOW! It was amazing! I simmered the salad in about 1.5 cups beef broth and 1/2 cup coconut milk (I had some opened that I needed to use), then pureed the soup in the blender. Absolutely delicious. A fantastic way to get two dishes out of one recipe. I'm freezing the rest of the soup so we can enjoy it later. Now I'm happy I spent all that time shredding carrots!!

This really deserves 3 1/2 forks in my book, but I am a tough customer so I give out 4 forks very rarely. I made the version with the orange for a Moroccan themed dinner. I used the shredded carrots from Trader Joe's which greatly simplified things and they stayed crunchy for several hours at least (there were no leftovers!). I did add some finely minced lemon zest for added zing and used the oj. Yummy and refreshing!

Made the orange version, it was an easy make-ahead, and the flavors came together very well after a few hours in the fridge.

Very good side salad. The version with oranges is really good, too.

MUCH better if the carrots are sliced into thin discs (as served in Morocco in the places we went) or julienned. Quirky cinnamon flavor great with lamb. See also M. Hazan's Tasty Carrot Sticks in Classic... which is always a hit at parties and even simpler.

Despite the seasonings, let's face it, these are just shredded carrots. Not exotic or particularly interesting.

This is a wonderful do-ahead salad with an exotic twist. You can also use lightly steamed baby carrots.
