I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Sooo delish. I realized last minute that I didn't have chicken broth, so I caramelized a small onion in 4 T butter. Then I added the remaining ingredients (except the remaining 2 T butter). This was a spectacular dish and I can't wait to make it again.

Only used 1/2 stick of butter and sub'd in veg broth to make it vegetarian. This turned out to be wonderful side dish for our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner.

Didn't have thyme, so added 1 tsp orange zest. Everyone said it was the best squash ever and a great side to the usual Thanksgiving dishes.

This turned out so sweet it could be a pie filling, even with the thyme.

Easy to prepare and oh, so delicious. You'll never look at squash the same way again. Reduced butter in half and substituted EVOO. This is quickly becoming a classic at our table!

I used less than half the butter called for, veggie broth instead of chicken broth, and honey instead of maple syrup. Wonderful nonetheless!

I never thought I would say this, but there was too much butter! Overall, a delicious and easy recipe worthy of the Thanksgiving table.

This was fantastic. Reduced down at the end, the maple, butter and chicken stock made a wonderfully sweet and rich sauce that complimented the natural sweetness of the squash perfectly. Don't skimp on the pepper. Though I was skeptical of the cooking times, they're spot on.

excellent recipe, I added braised plantains with brown sugar on top
