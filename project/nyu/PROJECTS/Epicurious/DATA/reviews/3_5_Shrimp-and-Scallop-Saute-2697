My family's Christmas dinner is on Christmas eve and then I do something with seafood on Christmas day. I found this recipe and tried it out. Glad I did. I added some finely chopped shallots along with the garlic and then to tone down the acidity of the tomato paste, I added about a teaspoon of white sugar. The sugar blended the whole thing together. The change I will make next time will be to double the lemon juice, wine, and tomato paste to make more sauce. This was so yummy that I won't wait until next Christmas to make it again. Served it over steamed jasmine rice.

The only reason I didn't give this 4 forks is because I didn't have most of the ingredients! I ended up using mini sweet peppers (yellow and orange), because that's what I had. I also didn't have white wine, so I used 1/4 cup of the cabernet we were drinking. I also used creole spices, because ultimately I was adding my gumbo base (see Gumbo Ya Ya recipe) to the cooked shrimp/scallop mix just before I served over rice. It was amazing. I love finding these recipes and being able to modify them to great results.

I was disappointed in this dish. I was looking for something quick and easy and, of course, I should have known it was going to be lacking, since most easy dishes are just that, easy "period". If you are looking for a great seafood dish, try Ann Pachett's Seafood Chowder. It is delicious.

Delicious & easy, though of course I made a few changes. Sauteed the mushrooms & onions (not green onions) first as so many below recommend, then browned the scallops which I had dusted lightly with flour, salt & pepper (no shrimp on hand) with the garlic. Added wine, lemon juice, 1 chopped tomato to quickly finish cooking the scallops.

I thought this was quite tasty, with a few modifications. I used chunks of wild salmon instead of shrimp, and did sear both that and the scallops (with plenty of herbs and spices) and set them aside. Instead of green onions, I used one large regular sweet onion. I actually only had 8 oz of mushrooms, so that had to do. One thing that I noticed was that the lemon is a bit strong, so I would recommend cutting it down a bit. I also used oregano, thyme, white pepper, and my favorite old standby from Trader Joe's--"21 Seasoning Salute". It was good, saucy, and makes quite a lot.

I followed the advice of others and used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of paste, and added a shake (or two) of red pepper flakes. tatterdemalion's instructions were useful to me...seared the shrimp and scallops then cooked down the rest...it was delicious. When I told my husband that there were highly varying reviews, he suggested it might be the source of everyone's seafood. The depth of flavor varies so much from place to place that it can make or break a recipe. If you have fresh, local scallops (say, in Gloucester Massachusetts), forget the shrimp. If you're on the Gulf Coast, maybe you should double the shrimp. If you have a good fresh fish, I'll bet you could use that, too. Fresh lemons (as we have in Florida) make a lot of difference as well. I prefer cilantro over parsely, so I used it, but it's a matter of taste. Hubby can't eat pasta, we didn't have any couscous, so we just slurped up the sauce...This is a good basic recipe just perfect for adapting to whatever you have on hand and whatever your personal tastes are.

I thought this recipe was slightly flawed upon my initial assessment, and after reading the reviews, it seems my suspicions were confirmed. So I changed things. I seasoned the shellfish and quickly seared them, leaving them half uncooked, and removed from the pan. Added the garlic as well as shallots until soft, then deglazed with the wine - I used a verdejo which worked outstandingly well, and also was the perfect match to drink. Scraping up the fond with the wine & lemon juice, I then added the tomato paste, some thyme & oregano, white pepper, and some dried chili flakes. Brought it to a boil, then reduced the heat, added back the shellfish for a couple of minutes and turned off the heat. The parsley livened things up, and you can also finish it off with a little browned butter or maybe even a splash of lemon juice at the end. Rice is a great vehicle to soak up the sauce. So in the end, the way I cooked it deviated significantly from the recipe, but it turned out fantastic. Heed the warnings from the reviews, and make your own appropriate adjustments.

I am not that into scallops, but I really liked this recipe. I added diced tomatoes and chipotle peppers as suggested by another reviewer and the sauce was just great.I used lime instead of lemon and added some zest. I paired it with some wild mushroom couscous and voila, now thats what I call fusion. Goes great with some Pinot.

with a lot of shell fish recipes, I use white pepper. I cut back on the garlic, used diced canned tomatoes and served over fried chinese noodles. I feathered scallions and topped the dish. Wonderful!

My husband thought this was fine, but I really didn't care for it at all. Perhaps it wuld have been ok served over pasta, but cooked according to directions, it was like the seafood was poached. I might try it another time, first sauteing the seafood to get some caramelization and cooking the sauce separately and then serving it over the shrimp.

I used this recipe as a base to create a spicy saute~ Used lime juice and cilantro in place of lemon and parsley. I added canned chipoltes in adobo ~ 1 or 2 chopped with a splash of the adobo sauce. Served it over polenta. Yummy!

Didn't have shrimp or mushrooms, adjusted the recipe accordingly. Used teeny sweet tomatoes, halved, and it was quick and easy-great over a thin spaghetti or angel hair-delicious! Also, please correct the spelling of Gloucester and Provincetown. (Gloss-ter)

This recipe is awesome! It was so fast to prepare and tasted fantastic. I left the mushrooms out (not a big fan) and used homemade diced tomatoes instead of tomato paste. The sauce was creamy and I served it over white rice. This recipe is a keeper!

I agree with previous reviewers that it lacked something - I used fresh cherry tomatoes halved and will try cilantro instead of parsley next time. I noticed a comment about "creamy" consistency, but mine resulted in a broth-like consistency that called for pasta. I too love the ingredients and the concept, but will experiment with this recipe a bit more. Tabasco maybe?

Great taste and easy. I too chopped up 3 plum tomatoes instead of paste. After reading reviews - I sauteed a small onion after the garlic and I also added some chicken broth. I had no edible green onions. Served with small shell noodles. Yum!

Loved it! I also made some easy changes. I only used 4-5 cloves garlic, sauted the shrimp & scallops first, used cilantro instead of parsley, and used fresh chopped tomatos instead of tomato paste. The recipe was quick, easy and tasted very fresh and light. I will make it again and will use it to entertain.

This is a great "new thing" you can do if you are looking for something different to do wtih shrimp and scallops. I changed the recipe slightly (I had only about 1/2 the amount of shrimp that the recipe called for) by adding some fresh diced garden tomatoes at the very end with the scallops. I also "stretched" it a but with a cup of fish stock, and doubled the amount of tomato paste. This kept the nice creamy consistency but provided more "sauce". I also added about 1/2 tsp of crushed chile flakes at the end for a little "zip". Serve it with a Sauvignon Blanc or white Rioja, crusty bread, and a salad for a great summer meal.

I totally agree with the previous reviewer. Had good potential, but overall lacked flavor. I think the seafood should have been browned first in the white wine along with the mushrooms. This would have given the dish much needed flavor. It was good, but not great.

Really lacked in flavor. I'll give it another shot (because I love all of the ingredients), but will double the tomato paste and add some more wine. The mushrooms were flavorfull, but the shrimp and scallops needed more.

Five of us just loved it! Simple and quick with great flavor. If I did it again I would a little broth for a little extra sauce.

I sauteed all the veggies; then did the seafood; then made the sauce with fresh Thai basil, cilantro, and West Indian seasoning peppers; then mixed everything together for a really superb dish....served it over pasta.

It was very very easy, light and tasty. I cut way down on the garlic, added a healthier shot of wine than called for and added oregano for added flavor. Also can be done with all shrimp.

This recipe was wonderful! I used cilantro instead of parsley - it did add some flavor but it was also tasty without it. My sons are picky eaters and even they loved it - onions and all!

i've made this recipe several times, always substituting cilantro for the parsley because, frankly, parsley is boring, and because cilantro is used extensively in authentic portuguese cuisine. i serve it with rice prepared with fish stock and peas. everyone loves it as i am sure would those who complained about its blandness. just use the cilantro.

I disagree with those who called this dish bland. I found it subtle and delicious. I served it for guests and it was very much appreciated by all. I intend to make it frequently in the future. It IS a keeper.

While this wasn't inedible, it was very bland - a poor use of $30 worth of seafood. If I ever decided to make it again, I would saute the seafood, remove it from the pan, and add it back to the liquid ingredients,

I really liked it. I used half of the lemon juice called for in the recipe and passed extra wedges of lemon along.

Good recipe but I just had to comment on the intro: there are no such places in Massachusetts called "Providencetown" or "Glochester". There is a "Provincetown" on Cape Cod and a "Gloucester" on the north shore of Massachusetts. Providence is the capital of Rhode Island. Just FYI.

Used only scallops in preparing this recipe and it worked great. Shrimp alone would be wonderful, also. Used a good dry white wine and found the ingredients blended beautifully. Of course tasted as I went along to be sure all was correct. My husband is a VERY fussy eater, and he loved it. Served it with rice pilaf. A good dish for company.

This recipe I thought was very good, my suggestion to others who wish to make this dish is, be careful with the type of white wine you use. The wine that I used was a little to strong, though upon reheating the leftovers, the imprint that the wine left was reduced significantly. In my opinion the mushrooms were a welcome touch that helped accent the taste of the paste.
