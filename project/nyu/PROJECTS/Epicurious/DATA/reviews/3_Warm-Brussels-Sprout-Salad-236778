I added chopped pecans when sauteing, and threw on feta cheese after taking them off the heat. Delicious, I will definitely add this to my repertoire. I'm always looking for ways to dress up my veggies.

If you dont like Brussels Sprouts you're still not going to like them with this recipe but if you like them, as I do, you will really enjoy this recipe. I totally agree that the recipe is wrong. You need to increase the number of Brussels Sprouts to get 12 cups and you can probably cut the butter in half at least and a use a good amount of salt & pepper. Despite the inaccuracies of the recipe, I really love Brussels Sprouts made this way.

Try this instead: Cut sprouts in half and steam (briefly) first, then sautee in butter and a little olive oil with a bit of garlic and crumbled pancetta. A much nicer way to enjoy sprouts!

This is a delicious and simple way to eat brussels sprouts, and a very versatile side dish. I also do not follow the quantities listed - I use whatever amount of brussels sprouts needed for the amount of people I am serving and a moderate to small amount of butter.

without following the actual amounts of the ingredients the concept of this dish is great. i now just take the brussels sprout leaves and saute them in butter and use it as a light side dish.

Bought lots of brussels sprouts, so I got a full 12 cups. Was a decent enough of butter. The brussels sprouts came out bitter, probably because the short cooking time wasn't long enough to cook out the bitter compounds. They were also very bland, even after a hefty sprinkling of salt and freshly-ground pepper. This is the sort of dish that'll make kids hate brussels sprouts.

No forks, as I'd never consider these either a salad or a dish by any other name worth repeating. All that butter over the leaves of 12 brussels sprouts is #1 too much butter, #2 not a salad and #3 not 12 cups. Since when does one brussels sprout yield a cup of leaves?
