This was just too bland. Won't try this one again...

This was really good for a weekday inexpensive dinner, especially with all the tomatoes coming in from the garden. I didn't have olives so used capers. Baked 12 mins and 4 mins to rest in tin foil. Perfect.

We loved this recipe. We used fresh thyme which added great flavor. We are looking forward to making this again.

I'm surprised the previous review was so poor, this is a very good, simple, weeknight dish. Either they don't like the olive-tomato combination or they used some old fish. Certainly, there's nothging wrong with the recipe!

Bland. Horrible. We stopped eating it 1/2 way through and went out. Will be no next time

I've made this dish several times; we love it! As noted below, be generous with the thyme and the salt and pepper. I also add sliced garlic, and use halved cherry tomatoes. I assembled the packets a few hours in advance, which I would recommend if you have time as the fish basically marinates in all those yummy flavors. The fish steams in its own juices, and the end result is flavorful, tender, healthy and delicious. Enjoy!

I made this dish a second time, with onion and garlic since I was out of shallot, and it was even better.

My thyme plant is in sad shape and most store bought dried thyme tastes like dirt, so I used fresh basil from my garden. This was really tasty and a good way to prepare red snapper. I added capers to my husband and the kalamata olives to mine. I look forward to trying the dish with thyme.

Delicious, straightforward (if not extravagant) flavors. And VERY simple and quick (including cleanup!). I used capers instead of olives. Be sure to use way more salt and pepper than you think or it will be bland.

I made this for my husband. We couldn't find anything offensive about it, but wouldn't make it again. I'll try the suggestion for the red snapper recipe on food tv website, thanks!

It is an easy to make recipe for a healthy meal. I did it a couple of times. Nothing spectacular, but can be prepared ahead of time and is good for a quick meal.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. i accompanied it with asparagus. the sauce can also be used for huevos rancheros (omit the fish, of course). really good. highly recommend this one...easy too!

This was good. Three forks only, though, because my favorite snapper recipe remains Alfred Portale's on foodtv.com (Red Snapper Braised with Rosemary, Potatoes, and Garlic Confit.) It uses alot of the same ingredients, and has a much more interesting texture and flavor.

Does anyone have any recommendations for side dishes? Thanks!

I recently took a job as a private chef for a family in Scarsdale, NY who are on a rather strict diet, i.e., no cooking with fat, oils, no carbs etc....this was the first dish i made for them and I ommitted the olives because of the fat content.....not only did they love it, so did their 3 daughters!!!...and the mother told me they don't usually eat fish unless she prepares it!!.....next time i will add some olives as they are a little "flexible" on the diet!!! But this was a dish they called me the next morning to tell me how much they loved it!!!

I made some omissions that did not work at all, so thought I should warn others: if you omit the olives and thyme and use flounder instead of red snapper, the dish will be extremely dull. The technique is fool-proof, though, so I will try it again with different aromatics.

My husband loved this recipe, which prompted me to share this easy recipe with friends and family. I would use a bit more thyme than the recipe suggests. I served with jasmine rice and string beans with garlic. It was delish. Two days later I used left-over thyme and olives, this time sauteeing them in olive oil with garlic and topping over fresh fettucine. Delish again!

This recipe was simple, yet full of flavor. I cooked it over the barbecue for 8 minutes and served it on a bed of rice. Perfect serving for my man and I

This is so easy! And the taste is outstanding - I plan on using this as a delectible easy entree for entertaining!

This is such an easy and delicious dinner, it has become one of my staples. I substitute garlic for the shallot and add capers as well. It is also great that you can make ahead, a bonus when you have two kids!

Aay light & flaky fish will do, the market was out of Red Snapper, so I chose Tilapia. Used a lot of thyme. Complimented it with saffron rice. Baked beets as a side dish. Very nourshing meal. My boyfriend loved it.

Everyone seems to rave about this recipe, but I found it a little bitter and kind of bland. If I were to make it again, I would add some brown sugar to the tomatoes and would serve it with a tastier rice.

Delicious, quick and easy, a real keeper - I added much more thyme and and a pinch of cayenne.

I have made this dish many times. It is excellent with any mild fish. I also add capers to this dish and the fresh thyme does make a difference. VERY elegant and VERY easy.

Wow- so easy,tastes so good! Be sure to use fresh thyme-it makes this dish. Wonderful flavors for such a mild white fish, without taking away from the delicate flavor of the fish-fast, easy, good. I will be making this every time I get the fresh red snapper on sale-and easy cleanup too!

We made this last night for dinner, very last minute. This was absolutely delicious! It was very easy, and took only a few minutes to throw together. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again!

Delicious and easy to prepare. Made a hit with my non meat eatting children for Thanksgiving.

We enjoyed this meal. I didn't prepare it ahead of time but that would be a real bonus another time.
