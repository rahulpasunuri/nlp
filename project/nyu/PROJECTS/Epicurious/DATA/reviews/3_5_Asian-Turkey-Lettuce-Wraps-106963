I've made this a few times now. Since I am not a fan of either cucumbers or mint I used the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted water chestnuts and cilantro. I also added some thinly sliced garlic with the onions. I really like the recipe with those changes and will continue making it.

DELICIOUS! I used waterchestnuts and borrowed a reviewers peanut sauce recipe (thanks Konalisa), then cut the hoisin and subbed Tamari for the soy sauce because we are a Gluten Free family& just putting the peanut sauce on the turkey is just delicious!

Delicious and healthy!!!! Thoroughly enjoyed. Previous reviews appreciated, added garlic (2 large cloves), 1/2 & 1/2 of cilantro and mint and sriracha hot chili sauce to taste.I too added more hoisin. I too served this warm on butter lettuce. But leftovers great with iceberg lettuce and/or on a bed of salad bed of crispy lettuce. Sooo easy for a quick lunch or dinner.

Huge hit! As an added bonus, it's "safe" for Passover! I did not use mint. I made my own peanut sauce with 3T peanut butter, 3T soy sauce, 3T hot water, 1T rice vinegar and 2 cloves of garlic. I also added about 1T of diced ginger to the ground chicken. I served cucumber, red pepper and waterchestnuts on "taco bar". Super easy and super yummy!

This is awesome. i made the peanut sauce myself, which made it not quite so quick and easy, but still not bad. i doubled the cucumber to get a little more veggies in there.

Rating: 4
This is easily as good as PF Chang's and any other Asian lettuce wraps I've had. I shredded some meat from a store-bought chicken in place of the turkey. I cut the cucumber in paper-thin strips, added matchstick-cut water chestnuts, a little minced ginger and a drizzle of Thai chile sauce at serving. Sublime.

Made these tonight. Made my own peanut sauce as I couldn't find any in store. Lots of great flavor. I made extra peanut sauce for dipping but it wasn't necessary. Here's the peanut sauce recipe: Peanut Sauce Prep Time: 5 Min Original Recipe Yield 1 cup Ingredients " 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter " 2 tablespoons soy sauce " 1 teaspoon brown sugar " 2 drops hot pepper sauce " 1 clove garlic, minced " 1/2 cup coconut milk " juice of ½ lime " 1 teaspoon ground ginger Directions 1. In a small bowl, stir together peanut butter, soy sauce, sugar, hot pepper sauce and garlic until well mixed. Gradually stir in water until texture is smooth and creamy.

This recipe was off the hook, y'all! Follow the ingredient list, but not the measurements. Play some Coltrane (Love Supreme) and get to it. Go by taste. I added a lil spice to mine, and I definitely put more than one teaspoon of Hoisin and lots of Soysauce. Now, I will say that I had mine warm (lettuce cold) because I wasn't down with the idea of cold turkey. And it turned out pretty damn good. I added some leftover peanut sauce on top of the filling, and some crushed peanuts. Gotta give it some extra love and soul.

Rating: 4
My friends and I cook together often, and this is a recipe we have returned to more than once. It is important to select a trusted peanut sauce--I prefer one that is a bit spicy because it blends well with the coolness of the cucumber, mint and lettuce. Have also made with tofu and it tastes just as good.

Rating: 3
This was a very easy dish to make. At first the amount of onions concerned me, but it all came together. Added 2 cloves garlic, chopped water chestnuts, and sriracha sauce (thank you reviewers!) Used both mint and cilantro as suggested by other reviewers though the mint added the most interest to the dish. At the end I still felt it needed something so made a side sauce (from another reviewer) of soy, hoison, and sriracha. That did the trick!

Rating: 4
Loved these lettuce wraps! I added a few cloves of crushed garlic to the turkey and onion, took another reviewer's advice and used 1/2 mint 1/2 cilantro, and added some chopped peanuts and Sriracha hot chili sauce. I also used iceburg lettuce instead of butter. The Thai Cucumber Salad was the perfect side dish to go with this.

Great concept! I will make this again with a few changes - added 2 cloves of minced garlic while browning the turkey and onion, used 1/2 mint and 1/2 cilantro. I used the cucumbers to make the Asian cucumber and peanut salad from this site. Nice, refreshing and light.

These were fun and delicious! We compared them with the Summ Yi lettuce wraps available from Costco and these won hands down, though the kids prefer iceberg to butter lettuce.

This was awesome. Although it probably makes a big difference which brand of peanut and hoisin sauce you use. I used Bangkok Thai Peanut sauce (yummy) and a lower sodium hoisin (I checked labels at the Chinese market). Some Hoisin sauces have so much salt that they can ruin your dish. This was really good. My husband ate more than half! I will be including this as a appetizer at my Super Bowl party.

Decided to make this because I had defrosted too much ground turkey. Made my own peanut sauce from another recipe and the meal was a huge success. Added chopped water chesnuts and cilantro at the end instead of the cucumbers and mint. Served with additional peanut sauce and sweet Thai chili sauce. Everyone wanted more. Will definitely do again

Wonderful dish- we LOVED it! Made the "ASIAN PEAR AND WATERCRESS SALAD WITH SESAME DRESSING" from this site to accompany- really great recipe too. If you make the salad, make extra dressing (which is really peanut sauce) to use in the Lettuce Wrap recipe. Added jasmine rice, cilantro & chopped peanuts to the "make your own wrap" buffet. Will make again for sure!

I absolutely hate it when people give poor reviews, don't follow recipes and improvise with horrible ingredients. This dish is yummy if you follow it correctly. I have made it many many times with butter lettuce and iceberg. My family likes the iceberg better because it's "crunchier" YUM!

Rating: 4
This dish was so delicious and sooo simple to make. it was done in minutes. I used both cilantro and mint and I think it was a fabulous combination. I served it with a spicy chili sauce. I used boston lettuce since I couldn't find butter lettuce and I found iceberg too unmanageable. I also cooked the turkey in olive oil since I had no peanut. I served this dish with a salad of chopped red bell peppers, red onions, more cucumbers and jasmine rice. I do wish I had read some of the other reviews suggesting chopped peanuts, ginger and garlic because I think that would have made this dish even better. I also think I would have liked it a bit spicier but all in all it was a light yet filling dish that I will surely make over and over again.

We tried this for Chinese New Year dinner. It turned out really yummy. The only changes were that I used chopped chicken breast instead of turkey and peanut sauce from Nina Simonds' Asian Noodle cookbook. We added Chili sauce to the wrap which balanced the other flavors. It also made a great lunch to bring to work for the next day.

simple dish to make and leftovers are easy to heat up for lunch at work or for dinner then next night. instead of peanut oil i used sesame and i used a green onion instead of a large onion. i also added some portobello mushrooms and a green and red pepper. this is also great over rice.

I used this recipe while hosting a party and it was a hit. People got to make their own lettuce wraps with the meat mixture, coconut rice, chopped mint, chopped basil, and different sauces. Another reviewer had suggested adding chopped water chestnut for crunch, which I agree with. I would say to keep the mint over substituting cilantro - makes for a great fresh taste with the cucumber. And made excellent leftovers for an at-the-desk lunch (coconut rice and meat only since lettuce does not microwave well).

Rating: 3
Great, much simpler than Gourmet version (Turkey in Jade) on this site and fine with cilantro vs. mint though the latter would be nice. I recommend using the recipe for Asian peanut sauce fr Gourmet, April 1996 if you don't have bottled stuff. Eliminate the T of soy sauce since salty enough without it. Basmati rice with coconut milk on side.

Rating: 3
Delicious. Added chopped water chestnuts for crunch. Used cilantro instead of mint. Served it on lettuce leaves as the recipe recommends and also served it inside spring roll wrappers with the lettuce shredded and rolled inside. Served either way, I made a dipping sauce of some extra hoisin sauce, garlic chili sauce and soy sauce mixed to taste.

I used peanut butter in place of the peanut sauce, I just added more soy sauce to it to make it more liquified. I also add 3 cloves of roasted garlic. I used Cilantro in place of mint. This recipe is very quick and easy, and oh so tasty!

This dish is delicious and easy. I would suggest first chopping the cucumber and mint and letting them sit together in a small bowl to maximize the fresh flavors. Do this before you start the rest of the recipe and then add at the end. I used scallions instead of onions but followed all other ingredients. Excellent dish will definitely make again and again. Yum!

OK. Didn't knock my socks off, because it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked. Might have been the brand of Hoisin or peanut sauce that I purchased, but don't think I'll try it again to find out.

Wow! Delicious and very simple to make. Omitted the mint and cucumber because of a picky husband and 4 year-old. 4 year-old loved the ground turkey (hurray!) because of its mildly sweet taste; husband loved this dish too. I added mint and cucumber to mine, but would not miss the mint next time.

I was in the midst of making stuffed peppers and deciding what to do with the extra gr. beef. I had a lot of romaine lettuce left and decided to try a version of lettuce wraps. I found this recipe and adapted to whatever I had in the kitchen. Yum! (although, I think chix would taste best)....I used grape tomatoes since I didn't have any other fresh veggies and added some red pepper flakes for spiciness. Next time I'll make it more Asian and use chix, cucumbers, bean sprouts and probably nuoc mam to dip.

Rating: 2
I didn't find this recipe very flavorful at all. It was all right but did not seem very Asian to me. If you do make this recipe I suggest adding more peanut sauce (or some creamy peanut butter mixed with soy sauce.) I mixed some up as a dipping sauce for the wraps which improved them (to my husband and me, at least.)

good way to make ground turkey less bland. I merged a few recipes into this one. I added sherry, mushroom, and water chesnuts. I thickened with cornstarch. I did not think the peanut sauce I bought at local grocery store was very good so it is a good thing that I used less. Served with marinated cukes and chopped peanuts which I put on top and lime to squeeze over all before rolling up

This dish was good, but could use some refining. I switched out Bean Sprouts for the Cucumber, which was a good choice. I didn't have Hoisin so I used Oyster Sauce, which also worked well. I didn't like the mint, however, I'd leave it out in the future. Also, the wraps were better dipped in teriyaki sauce...the soy was too salty. I'd make it again, it's easy enough!

This dish was great! We made a few modifications to make it spicier (chili oil, hot sauce) and added lots of extra veggies. And definitely drain the mixture after cooking, the turkey gives off a lot of water that can make the wraps drippy. We went with butter lettuce, but next time would use iceberg. Overall, this is a wonderful meal that we will make again and again.

I decided to make this recipe for a shower, but I was worried about how messey it seemed. Instead of ground turkey, I cut chicken into strips. Also, I used chili oil instead of the peanut oil.

This was sooo yummy! I chopped up a cucumber and let it soak in rice wine vinegar and fresh ground pepper while I cooked the turkey. Used seasame oil and added a diced fresh jalapeno w/ the onion.

This was delicious. I used toasted sesame oil instead of peanut oil and I think it added even more flavor. and since cucumbers were out of season, a little fresh cilantro and sliced red peppers (also dashes of coriander). The extra peanuts were wonderful too. On the lettuce: every time I've had these at restaurants, they seem to favor using Bibb lettuce. First time attempting Oriental food - I can't wait to make it again!

My entire family loved this recipe--kids and teenagers included. I would make a few adjustments. I would use iceberg lettuce instead if romaine because it could hold more food.

This recipe is however a good start.

This was a hit at our house! I added cilantro and hot chili-garlic paste. Also had to improvise the peanut sauce (3T. peanut butter, 2 T. water, 2 T. soy, 1 T. vinegar, powdered ginger and some honey) as I had none. My sister made each of my teenagers a recipe notebook, and I will add this recipe to the binder since it was well loved.

Oh, my, is this ever GOOD! I took the advice of other reviewers and used flour tortillas in place of the lettuce leaves, as we like things a bit heartier. Easy, fast, DELICIOUS recipe that will become a weeknight staple in our house. My husband raved, something that doesn't happen often. I added a little extra peanut sauce in my tortillas, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait to serve it to guests or over rice. Yum......

As the recipe is written it's just pretty good. It will be truly outstanding next time I make this, and that will be with some red pepper flakes or like another cook did, some chili garlic paste. I used iceberg lettuce and I thought that was fine, my husband though is still trying to talk me into using cabbage leaves next time.... (I don't think so honey... sorry!)

Used veggie ground round we had in the fridge, and iceberg does seem more suited for this dish due to it's shape. Even though iceberg lettuce isn't usually allowed in the house, I'll buy it for this. Also, added asian chili garlic sauce as we like things *spicy*. Very Yummy and a good dish for those hot summer days.

All my father could say while eating this dish was "Oh my gosh, this is good!" He did continue to repeat that all through dinner. I mixed soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and szechuan sauce to drizzle over the wraps (we like things spicy). Just as good the next day!

I tried this recipe because we love the lettuce wraps at Stir Crazy. I changed several things to get close to what theirs are like. I have a small meat grinder so I made this using ground chicken instead of turkey. I only used 1/2 of a large onion. Instead of cucumber, I added 1 can of diced water chestnuts. I doubled the soy and hoisin, and added a teaspoon or two of Chile Garlic Puree. (we like things spicy :) Garnish to put in the wraps was ribbons of green onion (green part only) and fried rice sticks. (you know, the ones that resemble styrofoam!). Turned out excellent. The next day I made a salad with the leftovers - chopped the leftover lettuce & green onions and put warm chicken mixture over it. YUM!

Rating: 3
I made this tonight for dinner for my husband and he was thrilled. He wasn't really looking forward to it when I told him what I was making, but by the end of the meal he was spooning the filling into his mouth without the lettuce. It is just the right combination of sweet and spicy. I used diced chicken instead of ground turkey(just my preference) and just sprayed the pan with Pam rather than the peanut oil to lighten it up a little. I'll probably make this as an appetizer for a dinner party soon.

Really good! I only made a "few" changes which worked well and you may want to consider...sometimes you have to improvise with what you have on hand!...here they are...I marinated the cucumber slices overnight in seasoned rice vinegar and then added a few slices on top of each wrap before folding up. I also made my own peanut sauce, which was easy...if I was in a rush however I would gladly use bottled. I used basil instead of mint because that's what I had fresh. Personally, using all-white meat ground turkey just tastes better. Both my husband and I enjoyed these...light but filling. Make them and enjoy!

I was skeptical about the amount of onions and mint, however, this turned out to be a great dish. Easy to make as well. Dipped in chinese chili and soy sauce. It does make a lot of meat however, so next time we will 1/2 the meat side of the recipe.
