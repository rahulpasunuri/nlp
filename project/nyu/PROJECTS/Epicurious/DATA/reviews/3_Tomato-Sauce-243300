This sauce was our first foray into homemade pasta sauce, and we loved it. Instead of just Romas we used a variety of heirloom tomatoes from our garden, and we also added a little fresh oregano. It was a little thin at first, so we pulsed about half of it in the food processor to break up the chunks.
