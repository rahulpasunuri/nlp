Good rolls, will make again. Nice crunchy outside and a good sub for cornbread.

I kind of messed up when making this recipe because I didn't read it properly all the way through and added the full amount of flour all at once. And my dough was a bit dry as a result. Aside from that the only change I made was to use rapid-rise yeast, which cut the rising time in half. The rolls were very tasty - we had them with bean burgers, which was quite a nice combination.

Easy and delicious. I made 8 large rolls for blue cheese burgers. They will be great in the lunch bag too. I'll definately make again, maybe experimenting with something other than caraway seeds next time.

These are the best rolls I have ever made! The cornmeal taste is not overpowering - just enough to give them a great flavor. My husband (who is generally not impressed with bread-baking in general) devoured them. I think I have found a new everyday dinner roll recipe!

This was agreat recipe for cornmeal yeast rools, just like the rolls my grandmother use to make. I had missplaced this recipe and am so glad that i have once again found it. Thank you so much
