Loved this easy recipe. Served for Christmas Eve dinner Monday and will take to family dinner on Thursday! I used chopped chives instead of green onions, they looked pretty and were scarfed down by everyone.

I serve these before dinner and my friends and family rave every time. So easy to make and very delicious.

I have a secret - went to a party where these were being served and guess what they put on top after it comes out the oven??? A piece of steak (this one was cooked in a TurboChef). It was outstanding. She just cooked a NY strip rare, let rest, sliced it up. Takes it up a notch. We are making tomorrow night for New Year's Eve - without the TurboChef.

This was absolutely delicious. Next time I will make a larger quantity since they disappeared very quickly.

very easy, a huge hit at my christmas party. I toasted the bread ahead of time and just schmeared on the cheese mixture as more were needed. Couldn't have been easier.

This is one of my all-time favorites. Even friends that aren't blue cheese lovers can't seem to get enough of them. Great for parties and just to have in the fridge for a quick snack.

I clipped this recipe from Bon Appetit several years ago and use it often. Recently had some spread left over and added it to hot mashed potatoes, Delicious. Just add to taste after mashing potatoes with a little milk.

I made these toasts 3 times in the last 2 weeks, each time to rave reviews. They didn't stay on the plate for very long. Like other reviewers I mixed the green onions in with the rest of the ingredients. Also, I didn't brush the bread with olive oil and bake. I put the topping on the rounds and baked as directed. They came out crispy and the cheese bubbling and delicious. Next time I might include the extra step to see if there is a big difference. This is a quick, easy, delicious recipe. A keeper!

Ridiculously easy, quick, and delicious. I mixed the white parts of the scallions with the cheeses, and then sprinkled on the green parts after they were out of the oven.

These are so good! I used a french baguette and just lightly toasted the rounds. I covered them with the spread and froze them. They reheat perfectly! Great make ahead recipe!

made twice in the past week and both times this was a big hit! everyone wanted the recipe. i too added the green onions right in -- absolutely a no-brainer on that. used pre-grated parm and didn't use as much as called for and it was plenty salty. didn't bother with the olive oil the second time and don't think it made for much loss of flavor. broiled for 5 mins instead of baking with great results!

I give this recipe four forks - delicious and easy to make ahead. My other two tasters only rated it 3 1/2 forks, but what do they know! I also added the green onions to the mixture.

Great recipe. Easy to make. Made them twice this week and had lots of requests for the recipe.

Love this recipe; make it frequently and people always ask for the recipe. One note, in case you're a freak like me and keep all your back issues for reference and just use this site as your index: this recipe appears in the November 2003 issue of Bon Appetit, rather than Gourmet!

This dish is just a given when you read the ingredients! And, it's true - the appetizer is great! Especially if you like blue cheese. I just used store bought toasts (b/c the lack of time I had) and they were perfect. I also served the app early b/c they are filling. Enjoy!

What a hit! I too took the advice to mix in the green onions. It was fast and easy to prepare and just taste great.

This was a wonderful recipe! I made it last night for my Bunko group, and it was a hit! I used the advice of mixing the onions into the mixture instead of on top, and added sauteed mushrooms to the top. It was easy and very yummy!

I took this to a party and it was the first appetizer eaten. It had rave reviews. I think I would put the green onions in the mixture next time. They did not stick to the tops. I did not use sourdough. A great recipe.

I made this for a New Years Day snack. It received rave reviews from all who tried it. I didn't have enough mayo for the recipe and it was still wonderful. Definately added to my recipe box!

These toasts are simple to make, delicious to eat, and they certainly please a crowd! I used a high quality blue cheese and I feel this makes them exceptional!

After eating this my friend told me that if he could be reincarnated, he would come back as Blue Cheese....I think that was a compliment.

This was great! Very simple to make (especially if you're crunched for time) and wonderful. Served it at a party last weekend and it was by far the favorite appetizer. Definitely making again!

Very easy and delicious. I actually left them in the oven a couple of minutes longer (so the tops started to brown). The cheeses melted wonderfully into the bread. Don't slice the bread too thin!

Four forks because it was delicious and so easy. It even tasted good by itself as a dip with veggies or cooked cold spinich tortellini on skewers. Making it again this weekend.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I really wouldn't change a thing, but I suppose it helps that I adore, bread, blue and parmesan cheese, and garlic. It just doesn't get any better than that combination for me. I have sensed passed it on to many friends. This will be one of my staples - very easy too.

I agree: I thought it sounded a bit pedestrian but I was in a hurry and had all the ingredients on hand: everyone really liked it! It does look a bit boring though: mushrooms might be nice, or even red peppers?

This was a smashing success, went like hotcakes. Could sautee mushroom and place on top. Quick and painless.
