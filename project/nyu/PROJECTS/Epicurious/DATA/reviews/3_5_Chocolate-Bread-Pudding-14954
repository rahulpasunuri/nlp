Easy dessert for great response from guests. We serve it with fresh whipped cream or french vanilla ice cream. Always a hit!

I modified this recipe with left over Easter panetone that was flavored with candied orange peel and sliced almonds instead of the white bread. I also added the chopped chocolate to the warm cream while it was still simmering, then waited until it cooled a bit to add the yolks. I served it with a tbsp. of warmed store bought Fudge Grand Marnier sauce and a dollop of whipped cream. Incredibly decadent, but oh-so-good.

I don't bake, but use this recipe whenever I have company and have to use something homemade. It is so choclatey! Everyone loves it. I serve it with fresh whipped cream or a premium vanilla ice cream. YUM!!!!

I admit to taking major liberties with this recipe, substituting 1% milk and light cream for the whole milk and heavy cream, and even using a low-cal bread. I was thrilled at how rich and delicious it tasted, very chocolately and moist. The absolutely perfect comfort food!

I really liked this recipe. Easy and tasty. I have added nuts and raisins, whipped cream on the side and have been asked for the recipe.

This was awesome, I made it for Christmas dinner and it was perfect. Something I'll definitely make again. I'd cook it a little longer than they call for , though.

I made this for a work lucheon and received praise from everyone. I used 2% milk and replaced 1/2 cup of the cream with milk. It was still rich and wonderful!

I thought it was very good, but next time I will pour warm chocolate sauce in the middle of the souffle after it has been cooked to make it sweeter.

This was very easy to make and my family loved it. It's a "comfort food" dessert.

Not the best chocolate dessert I have made. It is very rich and tastes good, but it just wasn't anything spectacular. I even made the creme anglaise, which was delicious, but it just wasn't the impressive dish I had hoped it would be.

This is a winner. It passed the test for my whole family...a tall order!! I used challah bread and served it with creme anglaise. Very rich and worth every calorie!!

Very easy to make, great taste that improves by the next day. I would recommend making it 1 day ahead for this reason. Warm gently in micro and serve with a scoop of good vanilla ice-cream.

My husband is a bread pudding connoiseur and he loved this. It is particularly good eaten right after it has cooled down a bit, like warm chocolate pudding. It was incredibly easy and quick to make. However, I used stale croissants (about 2 large) and halved the butter. I also baked it in an oval shallow baking dish. We all agreed that it would be sinfully good with creme anglaise!
