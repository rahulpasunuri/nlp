This is absolutely delicious. I find that one recipe of sauce is sufficient for 2 separate makings, but I did not serve extra sauce. Also, making tortilla chips sounds like a lot of messy work to me, so I skipped that. Many packaged chips are not "large" I think, so I put around 50 chips and that came out well.

Excellent, easy recipe. I made as stated but substituted feta for the queso fresco, used store-bought chips (lazy) and added black beans. Fantastic and a snap to prepare. This is not a light meal! But worth every calorie!

Substituted Anchos for Guajillo/New Mexico because the store was out. It was excellent. Also doubled jalepenos and did half pepper jack cheese to complement the queso fresco and monterey jack.

Also delicious made with chile verde (green sauce). Yum!

Delicious, even though I only had 3 guajillo chiles on hand. Looking forward to making it again, at 'full strength'. I was questioning the radishes as a garnish but they actually add a very nice flavor.
