Our family, including small children, LOVED this salad. We used 1/2 grapefruit (all sour pith removed) and 2 clementines, cut up. We also used 1 T honey, and lots more vinegar, and a good bit of salt. We pitted and cut up fresh farmer's market green olives, and a bunch of fresh garlic, which made it really amazing. A regular repeat in our house!

Fantastic! I love lettuce-free salads, especially for dinner parties because you can dress the salad in advance. This one was a hit. I used clementine oranges and basic pimento-stuffed green olives because that's what I had. Every guest asked for the recipe. Very simple and quick. A great side to pair with a more complicated main courses as it takes mere minutes to prepare. Will be going in my weeknight veggie recipe rotation.

This looked beautiful but was NOT good. The simple dressing was very nice but the combination of oranges and green olives was very bad. I wasted money and food making this.

This was gorgeous. I used large green olives from the olive bar that were marinated with red pepper flakes. They added an amazing kick. Everything else I kept as is and I would definitely make this again! I can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow!

Made this for 6 gourmet diners last night and received raves. Passed on a platter with some pear slices added for decor. Used tangerines because they are easy to break into segments. I doubled the recipe and had only a cup left over........everyone loved the contrast in flavors....served with cheese toasts.......

This salad sounds better than it tastes. The flavours of orange and olives do not necessarily go well together. It also needs to be eaten the day of preparation. It doesn't keep well in the fridge.

Again, I made this whole menu for a party, and it went over great. I love this salad, because it is so unique! Again, I needed to make some changes. I used two bags of good frozen whole thin green beans (steamed on stove and plunged into cold water afterwards), three naval oranges, and the only unstuffed small green olives I could find in a jar. The dish turned out great.
