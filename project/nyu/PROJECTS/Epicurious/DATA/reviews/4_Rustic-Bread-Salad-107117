I really enjoyed this. Because it's a salad I didn't follow the directions precisely: no carrots, added avocado and feta, omitted mint, added chopped garlic. But the general idea is the same and it was a great warm-weather supper. Next time I would bake the bread for a shorter time so as to retain some chewiness. Such a simple, fresh-tasting salad! (And a great way to clean out the produce drawer.)

My family flipped over it. I added chunks of avocado and feta once, and kalamata olives and fresh mozzerella another time. Even my 7 year old likes it, and he doesn't like much of anything.

If you want a middle eastern bread salad... make fatoush with mint and/or parsley. Of if you want a rustic italian bread salad, make an italian tomato salad with basil and/or oregano. I found this mish/mosh of both influences distracting. It didn't create a new identity of it's own, just kept me pining for either a fatoush or an italian rustic.

I've made this several times (I have Sheila's cookbook), with a few alterations. People LOVE this dish. I do not add the celery or carrots. I add crumbled blue cheese & capers (or black olives), and I also use balsamic vinegar. I also toss the bread cubes in olive oil & S & P and toast them under the broiler before incorporating them into the salad. Play with this recipe... but the basics of it are the foundation for a fabulous summertime salad.

Very fresh and summery tasting. Good bread and tomatoes are the key. Left out the carrots and celery and used balsamic vinegar. A yummy way to eat your veggies!

This is a delicious salad. It's great for using whatever is in the vegetable drawer. I skipped the carrot, bell pepper and mint, but added radish. I loved the flavor of the bread after it soaked up some of the dressing.

This is a great recipe! I left out the carrots, but did everything else by the recipe. I have made this several times since. Make sure you use vine-ripened tomatoes, since it is their wonderful flavor that makes this dish so special.
