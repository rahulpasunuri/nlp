The balance of vinegarband salt is key. I used an aged balsamic white vinegar and used less sugar and itnhas a nice refined flavor. I cannot imagine just using celery. The fennel addition makes it feel a bit Provencal but it is so good.

This was delicious as soon as I mixed it all together. I'm sure it's even better after it all melds together overnight. Question - is anyone else nervous about the recommendation to leave this at room temperature for 8 hours? Did anyone do so, and live to tell about it? I left mine out for 4 before I refrigerated, and now I'm wondering if that's even ok, given government says not to eat anything that's been at room temp for longer than 2 hours. Thoughts?

I forgot to add: I also used a largish batch of roasted plum tomatoes rather than either fresh or canned tomatoes. I first poured them into a bowl, then used my 'stick blender' to chop them as finely as I wanted before adding them to the pan as called for in the recipe. I LOVE the concentrated, sweet taste of the roasted tomatoes. I MIGHT add a few 'sun dried' tomatoes in oil to the roasted tomatoes next time. I think that would be good and still not overpower the other ingredients. And, of course I sprinkled a chiffonade of fresh basil to finish the dish!

Just as another cook noted, replacing the celery with fennel is a wonderful change. I also added a several cloves of garlic, grated on a 'plane' grater towards the end of the cooking time, and used the fig balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar as per another cook's suggestion. It is great reading other reviews before making the first time, as I know which flavour profiles I prefer. It's just achieving them the first time that's problematic. The suggestions save SO much time. Thanks everyone who helped me tailor this to my exact tastes.

This is great. I used fresh fennel instead of celery (it was on hand) and fresh tomatoes, but otherwise did everything to the recipe. Yum, yum.

Has everyone really been happy with 1/3 cup vinegar??? This is WAY too sour. All you taste is vinegar. After hours of work chopping, caramelizing, salting, squeezing I finally tasted it and I am SO disappointed. I could have done with maybe a tablespoon. This tastes nothing like what I had in Sicily. This probably would be great with WAY less vinegar.

I have made this 3 weeks in a row because eggplant is abundent right now. Excellent over pasta! I took other reviewers advice and added the eggplant during cooking. I also use fresh tomatoes so added a heaping Tablespoon of tomato paste.

This is great & so easy to make, I can't imagine why people say its difficult. I did follow one reviewer's comment and added the eggplant to the onions and celery at the end to cook. The longest part was waiting over night for it to be ready to eat!

Made this several times with great success using fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I just add the eggplant to the rest of the ingredients after the caramelizing step is done. Add a little parsley and balsamic vinegar for an extra kick of flavor. Yum!

This took some serious time (looks easy on paper, and indeed it is, just takes some effort!), but my golly was it worth it. I couldnt wait all those long hours to let it soak and meld, but Im glad there was plenty left over for later--when the true reward came! I made the thyme and Parmesan focaccia to go with it, also from Epicurious. YUM! Definitely will make again! And yes, let the onion and celery cook just about as long as possible. Turn heat down as you go. I am thinking about some leftovers for brunch with eggs and focaccia.

Lovely side dish for lamb, steak and also a great antipasto, plus you can use it the next day for sandwiches and pasta sauce. careful with the olives, capers and salt because it could end up tasting like a salt lick.

EXCELLENT caponata!! Here are my slight changes to this recipe...I used fennel instead of celery because that's what I had on hand and I happen to love fennel in an obsessive sort of way... also instead of canned tomatoes, I used a large spoonful of tomato paste and some halved, fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden. I also didn't fry the eggplant separately. After almost caramelizing the onion and fennel I simply tossed it in and continued to saute. Absolutely fantastic!! Served half over penne pasta and kept the rest as a snack with baguette.

Oh My! I've read all the varations and incorporated many. Especially the tomatoes and onions oven roasted and I did sliced eggplant drizzled with olive oil and salt, also oven roasted. The Onion and Celery done in the skillet until very dark is the core of the taste. Oh My! This is some work but way worth the payoff. A great dish!

This takes some work, but it is definitely worth the effort! I have made it twice - once roasting the eggplant in the over and once cooking on the stove. Both were great. I used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes the first time and thought that was delicious. I have shared this with about 6 friends and still get comments from a dinner party I threw!

One of the best Caponata recipes I've tasted. Served it at a dinner party as an appetizer, and it was a big hit.

Having had a caponata at a small Italian restaurant in Victoria, British Columbia, on our recent vacation to Maui I decided to replicate their starter using two caponata recipes I found on Epicurious! I was very pleased with the result! Hope you will be too! The other recipe's ingredients and instructions that changed to this recipe follow: With respect to the eggplants, prior to sauteing the other ingredients, deal with the eggplants so they can cool to handle easier. RATHER THAN fry the eggplant I brushed the eggplant with olive oil and seasoned with sea salt and GRILLED them on the BBQ until browned. When finished, cool and chop into smaller chunks, and then add into the rest of your ingredients before you begin to simmer and reduce your liquids. Add 4 crushed/chopped garlic cloves to the onions and celery in the saute stage. Add in 1 14 1/2-ounce can diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings in juice and the following ingredients "3 tablespoons red wine vinegar "2 tablespoons drained capers at the stage before bringing to a boil and then simmering to reduce liquid. Once you've reduced and simmered the balance of the instructions are fine in the original recipe. A wonderful "light and Healthy" addition is to take a can of olive oil-packed tuna (preferably Italian)and plate as much of the caponata that you would like to serve and them top it with the tuna and lightly mix it in with the caponata just prior to serving and serve with either crackers, baguette, flatbread of your choice! Enjoy! The link below should take you to the other recipe that I took some ingredients from. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/no tes/Caponata-235724#ixzz0hRHBDHWx

Very delicious. I did not take the time to salt & rinse the eggplant. I just browned it in the frying pan. I also used whatever olives I had in the frig and I used a combination of vinegars. I also took time in browning the onions, celery & eggplant so as to get the most flavor. I added some garlic too.

I've never enjoyed the caponata one buys in jars in the grocery store, so I was hesitant to make this. However, I was hosting a Sicilian Night for my Italian cultural club and there was no way out. To my delight, this recipe was absolutely delicious! I included some large caper berries (sliced in half) and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Made the day before. Delightful spread on crunchy Sicilian bread!

holy hell. this is a darn good recipe. i took a cue from another reviewer and ROASTED the eggplant (and only the eggplant) in my cast iron rather than pressing it. after about 20 minutes i finished it off on the stove. the only other variation i made was adding a handful of golden raisins. don't skimp on the browning time for the onions and celery! 10 minutes isn't enough! let them really caramelize and you'll be in for a treat.

Well worth the work! Used local Creoles and baby eggplant with great results altho didn't need sugar. Perfect with swordfish.

Taste was good, but procedure was too difficult. A better--and easier--way to make caponata is to dice unpeeled eggplant and mix on a large cookie sheet with roughly chopped, peeled onion and roughly chopped red & green pepper. Drizzle generously with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake at 350*F until veggies are lightly browned, about 30 minutes. (Even if you over-cook this it will still work out!) Transfer to a bowl and add 2-3 tablespoons tomato paste, a few cloves roasted garlic and chopped cherry peppers for heat (if desired). Puree lightly (some people like it chunky--I like to really mash it) with a hand blender and VOILA! Caponata perfect for baguettes. You can even use this to sneak vegetables into your pasta sauce for those picky kids & husbands.

This is an excellent receipe. Easy to make, it lasts for days and a great party dish. It looks beautiful. You can add pine nuts to dress it up for a party. Really tasty with great flavor, I make it often.
