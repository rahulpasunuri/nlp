I used Safeway's premade cornbread (sweet & soft & delicious), sweet Italian sausage and roasted chestnuts in the fire place (fun for kids, husband & inlaws). Consensus: very good. Incredibly moist. Will definitely make it again.

Made as directed, although I added some cubes of stale bread with the cornbread (maybe in a 1:3 ratio? and I added an another egg to compensate). It was a nice addition as it provided some structure and chewiness to the mix. The flavors and textures were lovely, however and I can't think of what else I would possibly change.

Maybe my ham was not salty, but me and my guests found it needed a little salt at the table and I even used regular chicken broth. The cornbread recipe was a bit bland, but I would not have wanted it too sweet or too moist like Jiffy.

This is a good recipes however I made my own variations to it. I used bacon choepped in small pieces and fried instead of ham. I added chopped leeks to the vegies and next time I will omit the chestnuts, they didn't seem to add to the flavor or texture. I make a smaller side stuffing with out the meat for the ones that don't eat pork. I would do it again!

The dish came out well,but i think it needs some adjustments. I felt it was a little dry and could have been more buttery. I also felt it was a little salty.

This is great. It reminds me of a stuffing with chestnugs that my aunt used to make just for me - fresh chestnuts are a labor of love. I'll stick to the prepared product - I'm afraid the fresh would never make it into the stuffing!

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using chopped freshly roasted chestnuts and my own cornbread recipe. I liked the texture and taste. I used a ham that was more like a Smithfield ham. The combination of taste and texture was great. Will definitely make it again!

This was great! We had vegetarians at the table so I left out the ham and used vegetable broth...still fab.

Make sure you use unsalted butter when you make the cornbread. Everyone liked it because I didn't add more salt. But I think next time I'll use a cornbread with a little sweetness to it. I might also try fresh chestnuts, sounds like a good idea.

I gave it a 1 fork rating because there is no Corn Bread amount in the recipe. Please someone help me out and give me an amount. I would love to make this recipe at least for Christmas!

To the person who wants to know HOW MUCH cornbread. Click on cornbread in the stuffing recipe. It will take you to the cornbread recipe. I assume you use the entire bread for the stuffing. I haven't made this, but I might for the next holday dinner.

HOW MUCH CORNBREAD? The recipe doesn't say.

This recipe is a great starting point but overall there are a few adjustments I make which I think are better. Instead of Ham use a high quality sweet Italian Sausage, and instead of jarred chestnuts use fresh chestnuts you steam yourself. The flavor is much better.
