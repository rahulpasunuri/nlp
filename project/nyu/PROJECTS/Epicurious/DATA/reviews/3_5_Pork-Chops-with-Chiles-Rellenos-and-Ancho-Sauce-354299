Not bad as is, but a few tweeks makes it better. The sauce needs more ancho powder and I would nix the honey. The OJ makes it sweet enough. Also, too much ancho on the chops. I would use 2 tsp for the chops and the other 3 for the sauce. The grilled rellenos are good! We are low-carbers, so used just cheese and added some diced tomatoes. We used a southwest seasoning on those. Will make again with these changes.

I loved the stuffed chilis! They were so flavorful! The pork was delicious as well but I did add chipotle tobasco, and apple cider vinegar as it was too sweet. This probably was my fault because I used apple juice instead of orange juice. All around very yummy!

This recipe is outstanding. The sauce was unique, potent, & intensely flavorful when reduced. The poblano side was elegant, unique, and also delicious. A fantastic way to eat pork chops.

I thought it was great. I only made the relleno part since I'm vegetarian though so I don't know how the meat is

This stuff is not only time consuming but god awful...what a waste of good pork chops!

The stuffed chiles are outstanding and the sauce is very good too. I usually brine the chops before grilling them.

Yummy! Roasting the peppers individually over a flame worked well, and was able to control the charring so they were not overdone. The filling was great! Probably needs more cheese. The pork was a huge hit, and the sauce was well loved!

This recipe was very good and the pork chops were very juicy. My husband has requested it for our Valentine's Day Dinner. I like it because I can make the chiles ahead of time.

I loved this. The sauce is unique. I "really" love the poblano peppers as a unique side dish. Next time I'll up the cheese (maybe double) and maybe use montery jack cheese instead of the white chedder. They were not as creamy as I hoped. Also, unless you buy really small poblano peppers, you will need to increase quantity of potato. The full amount was enough to stuff 4, not 6 peppers.

Excellent dish! I'm not sure why several readers thought there was not enough flavor, and I thought the diced potatoes were a welcome change to the standard Relleno stuffing. I did substitue a pork tenderloin for the pork chop, which I rubbed with the seasoning and let sit for about an hour before grilling everything. The sauce was the bomb, but be careful not to let it get too thick when you reheat it before serving! We love hot and spicy foods, so this is definately a keeper in my house. I can't wait to make it again!

I thought this was just okay. I've stuffed and baked roasted peppers with mashed potatoes with all sorts of ingredients before and I thought these were a bit dry compared to ones I have thrown together previously. Overall there was not enough flavor for me, which was surprising due to the wonderful ingredients. I will not make this one again.

Omigosh! This was amazing! I subbed a few things, but it was wonderful and no where near as complicated as the recipe made it sound. If you know how to cook, you know how to multi task and that makes this recipe easier. Worth every bit of effort! Vegetarians will love the chiles. I am thinking of doing them stuffed with chopped chicken.

Chile Ancho is a dried Chile Poblano. It is NEVER called Chile Pasilla-which is a very dark long chile an entirely different chile. When it is green it is called Chile Chilaca. There is absolutely no need to add chile ancho to the recipe-the poblano chile is flavourful enough on it's own. Kathy Waugh, Mexican Chef & Mexican Food Consultant

I like this recipe a lot. Loved making the chilies whithout frying them. We also do eggplant parm on the grill this way to save the frying. The dryness of the porkchops have more to do with the cooking time and quality of the meat than the recipe. This doesn't seem like a valid criticism of the recipe.

Made this for dinner --dreadfully disappointed. The chops were dry, dry, dry. The chiles, however were quite good. Served the left over chiles the next day with chicken and they were delicious.

We did these today for the game. Just a bit intensive prep wise but the Poker guys give this a big thumbs up!

I questioned the 4 and 6 also. The ingredients work out fine, I actually had pepper stuffing left over. The extra two chops and peppers are lunch for my wife and I today.

Fixed this last night and the familiy loved it. I substituted ground ancho peppers w/ flakes(blender)for the powder and ground cumin for the seeds.The sauce was an exellent blend of flavors.I would recommend mashing the potatos, so that stuffing the pepper is easier. This recipe is a homerun. Will definitly fix this one again.

? Why 4 servings with 6 chops and 6 poblano chiles? Will that change the other ingredients.
