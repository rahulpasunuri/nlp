I loved the lemon cream tart! It was simply delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. Watch the crust so it does not get too brown - mine was done a few minutes before the suggested baking time. I also put a foil ring over it for the second baking with the filling. I had no problem with sticking - just used parchment paper in the pan.

I used my own basic tart crust recipe and had no issue with sticking as others did. Great filling!! I have added my basic crust recipe below. BASIC PASTRY TART CRUST 1 cup flour ½ cup powder sugar ½ cup butter (chilled/cubed) ½ tsp vanilla Combine all ingredients using a pastry blender, until dough just begins to hold together. Press into 9 tart pan with removable bottom. Bake 20-25 minutes @350; or until lightly golden brown. Cool completely before filling.

same problems as the rest of the cookers. the crust could not get out of the pan. I put the waxed paper on the bottom. But idea, people had to eat it with the paper on. The filling is exceptional and delicious. Will try another crust receipe next time.

I'm home for Xmas vacation and wanted to make a quick dessert with fresh Meyer lemons I brought with me. This was easy and tasty. Very happy with the results.

I found that using a cooking spray (like PAM) on the tart pan worked, and the crust didn't stick at all. I subsituted fresh strawberries and raspberries instead of the raspberry/apricot compote.

I used a different crust (Flaky Pie Crust from this website), so I can't comment on the crust sticking issues, but the filling is excellent! I served it with a blueberry compote.

I agree with first reviewer about the crust sticking. I used nonstick tartlet pans (hoping they would work) but had difficutly removing the tarts. Parchment paper would do the trick. Otherwise the crust had a wonderful flavor as did the filling and my guests raved. I served with mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries). A nice spring/summer dessert. Recipe made 8 tartlets.

The recipe worked well. The dough/crust came out perfect and the filling was very yummy and lemony! The only suggestion that I would make is to use a parchment paper circle in the tart pan and/or serve the tart at room temperature after it has chilled. I found that the crust really stuck to the tart pan. Maybe omitting the butter on the tart pan would solve the problem, too. Also, I substituted fresh blackberries instead of the raspberry apricot compote.
