So so so good. And easy. Made it exactly as described and then other times with some of the variations listed here (chickpeas are a nice addition). Enjoy!

Yum! Used vegetable broth and added smoked paprika. Definitely a keeper!

This was really easy and hearty for a cold winter weeknight dinner. Subs: used pre-cooked chicken andouille sausage, and swapped half the chicken bullion for adobo bullion. If the recipe depends so much on the sausage, and it was totally good with a subpar switch-out, it will probably pop with the linguica. But really, a quick great weeknight dinner. Served with crusty bread and manchego.

Made several substitutions...used mustard greens instead of collard greens, unpeeled white rose potatoes instead of russets & a red torpedo onion. Also diced linguica instead of using rounds + browned these first and THEN added onion & garlic. Also left the soup chunky (did not process 1/2 as recommended). Overall, not impressed with the soup - fairly bland & not very flavorful. Had higher expectations with the linguica. My substitutions don't seem that far off from the original, so sticking to the recipe would probably yield the same results for me. Won't be trying this recipe again :(

A great way to use up collard greens from my CSA. I substituted caulflower for the potatoes, added a rind of parmesan during the simmering period, and gave it a splash of cider vinegar at the end to brighten it.

This recipe departs from the traditional portuguese version - for better and for worse. It's more authentic and much tastier to make a thread-thin chiffonade of the collard greens (lacinto kale is also excellent), and don't add them until 5 minutes before the end. If they're too cooked it takes away from the flavor. A traditional portuguese cook would NEVER use chicken broth, only water - however, I confess that I like it better with the chicken broth. If you can find linguiça, it's SO worth it! The best substiture is spanish (NOT mexican) chorizo.

This soup is delicious and easy to make. It is a favorite that I make again and again and it is always full of flavor. A little lemon juice added at the end perfects it. I sometimes use chick peas instead of potatoes, depending on what's around.

I used organic berkshire garlic sausage that i cooked ahead of time, and added 2 slit dried chilies for the spice - best soup i have made in a long time.Try adding a spash of white wine to wilt the greens with.

This was a delicious soup. We made it with linguicia and did not blend the potion of broth and veggies. IT was out of this world!

This was always called caldo verde when i was a kid. My dad made it with kale and spicy linguicia (a portuguese version of chorizo). The smoky paprika in the linguicia really makes the soup.

Yummy -- a perfect winter soup for the two feet of snow that just fell in the middle of April! I substituted veggie sausage.

this soup is wonderful! my pup went crazy when I was making it so I shared it with her and she loved it too! I was lucky enough to have locally grown, organic collards and local farmer made sausage! I didn't have any onions but it didn't seem to suffer much for not having them! I'll make this again and again!

Great family recipe. Healthy, easy and very flavorful. I usually use spicy italian turkey sausage to keep the fat down.

I used rich homemade chicken stock. I had kale on hand and put that in along with the collards. Instead of dicing the potatoes I sliced them thinly, then used a potato masher to easily break up the potatoes instead of pureeing. For my tastes, I thought the texture would be preferable to pureeing. I added crushed cayenne before serving. This is a good recipe, easy adjust to taste.

I have to say that this recipe has great ingredients however it needs a bit of sprucing up. First I sautéed whole sausage with 1/2 large onion ( set aside 1/2 ) on high heat until browned, then and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup white wine ( whatever is on hand ) reduce heat to simmer then I removed the sausage & cut into 1/4 slices and set aside. Meanwhile on a different burner in a large pot sauté the other 1/2 of the onion with the garlic ( I used three table spoons of crushed garlic ), crushed red peppers, and a splash of olive oil ( this will pull the flavors out better ) cook until garlic turns golden add collard greens reduce heat and sauté until wilted then resume to the original recipe.

I did not have kale, so I threw in a package of frozen cream spinach instead. This was quite tasty - although I've had this soup in a Portugese restaurant and it was incredible. I think I could have put more of the potatoes in the food processor to make the soup a little thicker. I still enjoyed and would tinker and make again.

Love, love, love this one. I've made it a ton of times. Best use of greens we've found yet. I also have a small cafe and this soup flies out the door.

A very simple yet bold-tasting recipe! I have made it with both pork and turkey andouille sausage and have found that it is usually spicy enough without adding quite as much crushed red pepper at the end. It's great for entertaining!
