I was a meat cutter for 16 years. Pork shoulder (also called pork butt) is the the cut you want. The boneless ribs are just pork shoulder cut into strips. BTW, pork steak is the same, too. Sausage needs fat for flavor. The meat to fat ratio should be about 65/35.

I have made this twice now using ground pork with no extra fat. I found that it needs the spice to be doubled. If you are not serving with a hearty mustard like the horseradish mustard, it may need even more spice. Also found that skipping the steaming step gives a better result...nicely browned bites.

I just finished the sauce. I was amazed that a mustard sauce wasn't simpler. What's worse, it's terrible. Very little flavor, except for an overwhelming bitterness. I will taste again after it cools, then see what I can add to salvage and hopefully avoid having to start over with a different recipe.

I've never had a recipe fail before; this was my first! The pork mixture totally fell apart when I tried to turn them over. I tried adding two eggs and some bread crumbs as a binder to the next batch which still crumbled. Where did I go wrong?

I made this for my cooking group. They are good and they turn out exactly as they are shown but we did not find them to be memorable, just another nice appetizer that is loaded with calories. Good recipe but I don't know if it is worth the trouble. I liked the dipping mustard, I used less horseradish, although I am horseradish fan, more honey, and a splash of really good balsamic.

I loved this sausage, especially the way they were cooked. They made a great starter and I ended up making extra for freezing. So easy to pull out and cook when friends drop over for a beer. I did not like the mustard. I used Zatarains instead, the mustard in the recipe was too much work and not good. If you are looking for a good piece of pork to use for sausage, try shoulder, sometimes called butt in some parts of the country.

to answer tjswan's question: the recipe calls for 'country style ribs' these don't look like regular ribs but more like a large roast cut into big strips. All the grocery stores in Cali sell them. If it doesn't say boneless don't worry they generally have very few to no bones that are easy to cut out.

I would like to try this recipe, but have never seen boneless ribs at the grocery store. Any ideas for another pork cut that would have a similar amount of fat and texture? Thanks.
