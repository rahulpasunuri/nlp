This really was one of he more challenging recipes to pull off that I've ever executed from Epicurious, but the result was well worth it and it showed very well for brunch company. I went with Cooks Illustrated's method of poaching, which calls for bringing the water to a boil in a skillet filled nearly to the rim with water and the vinegar added before boiling. They also recommend adding the eggs to the water and then removing the skillet from the heat for 3-4 minutes depending on desired yolk firmness. I went with 3 1/2 minutes, anticipating that the yolks would cook a bit more during the frying process. And I poached at night and finished the next morning. Again anticipating.. I poached 6 eggs when I only needed 4, allowing for error. And error there was. 2 of the eggs oozed yolk during transfers to the egg white and Panko mixture and were discarded. Not sure that letting them "drain" on a kitchen towel was necessary - the added step increased opportunities to err as it wasn't an easy surface to extricate these delicate pillows from and any movement can disrupt the yolks. So.. I'll definitely make this again, but my lessons learned are: (1) Poach the eggs for 4 minutes in water brought to a boil and removed from heat, and (2) skip the kitchen towel draining step - go right to the egg white/Panko mix. Last bit of advice that I did implement with success: If using a good ham (e.g. Prosciutto or Speck) there's no need to add salt post fry.

Definitely a culinary challange to fry poached eggs, but I was very successful with 3 of the 4 eggs and managed to salvage most of the 4th! Agree that the pepper/prosciutto mixture was great. Won't be making it every week but certainly happy I attempted it at least once.

I made this easier by just frying up the eggs instead of poaching. That way, with no fear of breakage, it was a lot easier to dip them and re-fry them. I suggest making a lot more of the red pepper/bacon/sherry mix as it was a huge hit and there just wasn't enough!
