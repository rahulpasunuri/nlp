I really like desserts that seem simple but offer a unique flavor, and this one is great. I chopped the ginger, bacon and pecans fairly fine, so flavors were balanced and there was no 'gummy bear' effect.

I was a vegetarian for 16+ years and eventually caved in to the siren song of bacon, the gate-way meat. Once broken, I simply couldn't find enough ways to eat it. This was delicious! Smokey, salty, maple-y AND ice cream? Yeah, I'm in!

Noooo...bacon, no matter how sweet, does not belong on ice cream. I tried the sauce, with the bacon, on vanilla ice cream and coffee ice cream. No, no, no, no, no. The bacon was like a gummy bear! I liked the sauce though, without the bacon, and am going to try it again on pumpkin ice cream topped with a little bourbon whipped cream. OH..stir the pecans into the sauce, so that the sauce has time to settle into all the pecan nook and crannys.

This has wonderful flavor and is very simple to make a few hours ahead. Some skipped the candied ginger but I think it gave a depth of flavor that was wonderful. Be careful with the bacon though, it burns easily during the broiling stage!

The concept for this dessert was great but it had too many strong conflicting flavors. I found the ginger and lemon juice to be overwhelming along with everything else and would leave them out in the future. My husband and I also were not huge fans of the sauce over ice cream. Again, it was just too much. Although, I bet it would be awesome drizzled over pancakes or waffles for a fancy brunch!

Excellent way to put half your guests in diabetic coma and the rest in cardiac arrest!

I made this for a big party along with Giada Delaurentis' apple zeppole. It was a great beginning of fall dessert! I didn't have maple sugar so I used brown sugar and it was still great. Also didn't have the ginger that I thought I did, so left that out. This definitely goes into the permanent recipe box.

King Arthur Flour sells maple sugar - www.kingarthurfloour.com. It's item #1293. HTH!

Just curious, where do you find maple sugar?

Quadrupled the recipe for a party of 50 and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone loved the bacon...I could have eaten the bacon on it's own! Just make sure the ginger is in tiny pieces and is mixed well.
