Love this recipe! So easy and nutritious. Sometimes I put roasted peppers and a little parmesan in, and cut down on the olive oil . Most importantly, my children love it too and beg me to make it for them!

I used only 1/2 TBS lemon, added seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar, chopped fresh Sorrel and Basil. I didn't have any parsley or olives. Will add cherry tomatoes next time. Yum!

An exceptional recipe for a weeknight when I did not have anything planned for dinner. I searched for a recipe with tuna and pasta, and picked this one. I was delighted to find such a sophisticated recipe for Costco tuna packed in water. I'll have to hunt down Italian tuna! I added hearts of palm and sundried tomatoes to the cruda, and sprinkled cilantro and mint in addition to the parsley on top. Yum, I will definitely make this again!

Made this because we had some slightly freezer-burned tuna from a fishing trip. I trimmed the tuna and poached it in olive oil and was looking for recipes for "canned tuna". My husband wants it once a week!

Rating: 4
Loved it!!! I ran low on Capers and Kalamata olives, but had a jar of Marinated hearts of palm, so I added them into the mix...since it seemed like a salad type dish...it worked beautifully. The only other ingredient that was added were some fresh cherry tomatoes cut in two from my garden. It added a little sweetness to the bite of Caper and salt of the olives. Even my fiance, who is not a huge fish fan, loved this dish. Excellent

Found this recipe online a couple days ago and needed something quick tonight so gave it a try; we LOVED it! I read many of the reviews and so added thyme, crushed red pepper and some of the artichoke marinade. It was yummy, super easy, quick & used pantry items I have on hand... what's not to like!

Perfect for summer as an almost no-cook meal. I used store-bought artichoke lemon pesto in place of the marinated art hearts, doubled the fresh lemon juice and zest, and added a splash of white wine. Lovely served at room temperature. Four forks for being quick, easy and simply delicious.

Rating: 2
I like the strong flavours this dish provides. I didn't add the Kalamatas as I didn't have them in the house. I agree with another that a more flavourful herb (basil, dill, or tarragon perhaps) would be better than the parsley. This needs some colour as well. Good summer dish.

We thoroughly enjoyed the lemon accent. The Italian tuna was a bit pricey. We will marinate our own tuna next time. Fast, fun and satisfying.

This is quite tasty and very easy. I made it with regular tuna in oil and not as much olive oil. I think it might be better with a more flavorful herb like cilantro or mint.

I made this constantly when I was in Afghanistan, since the only fresh ingredient required was lemons, and they were available, and friends sent me everything else from an Italian market in Europe. Big hit, every time. I added sun-dried tomatoes, and backed off the olive oil -- added a bit of oil from the tuna jar. I've also used this as a sandwich filling. Just terrific.

I used canned artichokes, which I usually don't love, but I sauteed them over high heat to get rid of some of the brinyness, and they were much better. Didn't have olives or capers, but added garlic, halved the lemon, and the whole thing was fantastic. Would definetly make again.

This pasta salad is yummy...i just made it. I did not reserve the water from the pasta and I could not find the italian tuna, i used regular tuna in water, drained and added the sundried tomatoes also, they are a must. I used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes..yum..I think the people who did not like this recipe probably don't like strong flavors. I used the juice of 1/2 a very juicy lemon, the red pepper and black pepper and believe it or not, you will need salt, keep tasting as you add the salt, lemon and red pepper to get it to your liking...The taste of the capers with the peppers and artichokes is a perfect combo..I can't say enough about this one!!! loved it!!!

Omigod, I cannot stop making this since summer started. It's so easy, and so satisfying for how light it is! I don't rinse the capers, which I think helps keep it from getting bland, and am super generous with the black pepper. Leftovers make a great lunch too!

As I type, I'm just finishing my first plate and going back for more. I used penne, drained a little more than the directions, added more olives and a pkg of crumbled garlic/tomato/basil feta cheese. Mmmm. I'm sure leftovers will have more intense flavors.

This recipe did not click with me or my family. I followed the recipe as written, but the results were underwhelming. I was encouraged to try this recipe by all the positive reviews it had received, but it just seems blah to me. Oh well - - I have had great success with lots of other pasta recipes on epicurious, and I'll move on to try another one.

I tried this tonight and it was excellent! I was cleaning out my cupboards and added just about every possible ingredient suggested by others: sundried tomatoes, red pepper flakes, roasted red pepper, anchovies, and a drizzle of 1/2 and 1/2 cream. I used water-packed tuna and rigatoni pasta, because that's what I had and used the oil from the anchovies. I only used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1/2 cup. I also sprinkled pecorino romano cheese on top. It was delicious! I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I made this recently for a gathering, and got lots of positive feedback. I did follow previous user's suggestions of adding halved grape tomatoes and using the oil from the tuna.The second time I made it, I added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes, and that gave it an extra boost of flavor. I also used white tuna packed in water, olive oil and red wine vinegar instead of the lemon (I was in a hurry). I thought the tuna was just as good as the more expensive Italian variety.Either way, it tastes good, it's easy, and the leftovers make a good lunch.

I don't give many single-fork ratings, but this is definitely one. Sulky-heads all around the dinner table last night. The dish had no flavor, the lemon overpowered the dish, and the reserved water never absorbed. It was a soupy disaster. If you have tuna and lemon juice, I recommend MEDITERRANEAN TUNA AND RADISH SALAD instead, which is find on this site.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! Made it on Ash Wednesday for myself and my non-Catholic (and picky) roommate, and we both adored it. The pepper flakes are worth adding for a bit of zip, and the parmesean is a must. I also added strips of roasted red peppers- their sweetness balanced the acidity of the dish nicely.

This recipe was astonishlngly good!!!! I followed the basic outlines and was delighted with the results. I don't recommend adding parmesan cheese, as it overwhelms the clean, simple, yet charming, flavors of the other ingredients. Highly recommended!

this was amazing, i made half of the recipe and didn't bother with the olive oil instead just used the oil from the tuna and a drop from the artichokes. the only thing i would do diffrently next time is add a bit more lemon juice otherwise it was great

I am making this again for lunch today. Definately add a wee bit of parmasan cheese. I also added a quarter cup of chickpeas because I had them in the fridge. Delish!

Fantastic! We made this on a 98 degree summer night. Used organic tri-color pasta shells and it looked so pretty! Used juice of 1 very juicy lemon and didn't bother with zest - it was perfect. The next day we ate it as pasta salad for lunch and stirred in some avocado. Grape tomatoes would also be a nice addition for pasta salad leftovers. I would recommend this to anyone. I was so excited to find such a simple and delicious summer recipe!

Rating: 3
It was pouring rain, time for dinner, the cupboards were bare and I didn't feel like venturing out for groceries. I used spaghettini, tuna in water, lemon, capers, and slightly more olive oil. That's it, because that's all I had on hand, and we were eating within 25 minutes of surfing for the recipe. Garnish with a little parmesan -- not absolutely necessary -- and red pepper flakes for more zip. Definitely a do-again.

Rating: 3
This was very easy and very refreshing. I thought that with all the salty ingredients I wouldn't need to add any extra but the tuna and pasta tasted oddly bland next to the other assertive flavors. A little salt makes it a better balanced and integrated dish. For those who thought it was either too tart or not lemony enough, I think lemon is one of those ingredients you have to taste as you add because each lemon is different in size, acidity, age, etc, and that affects final flavor. Makes very good cold leftovers, too, which is always a plus in my book.

Rating: 2
It's okay, I think I would have likes it better without the tuna and on smaller pasta. The mediteranean chicken salad on this website is similar but SO much better

Rating: 3
You really can not go wrong with pasta, artichokes and capers.... For the one's who felt it was too tart or acidic... it did call for an entire lemon plus the zest, so maybe this recipe is best for lemon lovers. When it came time for leftovers, I wanted to twist it a bit. I added halved grape tomatoes and a small amount of cream. The cream really smoothed out the lemon flavor, left it very mild. Either way, it's a keeper.

Rating: 3
This was so easy to put together (salsa is ready before the pasta is!), and so visually pleasing! Great summer dinner, you won't turn your kitchen into a furnace cooking this! Flavors go together well as written, but because of flavors I like, next time I might use a little more of the lemon juice, olives and artichokes. I will make sure that I always have the ingredients for this dish on hand, it is perfect for unexpected dinner guests that you want to impress.

I thought this was much too acidic, between the lemon juice and zest, olives, capers and artichokes. There are better recipes for pasta with tuna.

This is a staple in our household. We leave out the olives - personal preference and increase the lemon juice. We also occasionally throw the artichokes in a hot pan and saute for a couple of minutes before adding them in. It gives the dish a whole different flavor!

I used way less pasta and trader joes tuna steak. I thought it was very tasty. I think good canned tuna would also work. Oh, yes, and I use a big 14 oz jar of artichoke hearts.

Ah, bella italia! A true summer dinner staple of my childhood. I'm amazed that other nations see this as a cold 'pasta salad'- to me raw sauces on hot pasta are perfectly natural. The pasta heat slightly cooks the sauce. One tip I'd add is to chop and mix raw sauces around an hour before you cook the pasta- any more and the herbs lose their crunch (I always add more at the table anyway)any less time and the flavours don't combine to nirvana status! Delizioso!

I generally don't go for pasta salad which I find to be overly dry or overly oily and tasteless, but this was really tasty. Quick, easy, and pairs really nicely with a light tossed salad. I actually mixed a couple bites of my pasta with some extra Caesar vinegarette dressing which gave it even more punch (I think it was the parmesan). Next time I'll follow others' advice and add grape tomatoes and feta or parmesan and increase the lemon zest. Definitely would stick with small shells or other smaller pastas as I think rotini or other thicker types of pasta could get too heavy.

Rating: 2
This was a nice, quick summer recipe. The lemon juice and zest made the flavor. I didn't think the tuna was any great shakes, though (yes, I used italian tuna) so I might just grill up some garlic shrimp next time to add a little more ooomph. But, very easy and fast.

Rating: 4
This was perfect for a hot humid night. Italian tuna in olive oil is the key here. And DON'T waste the tuna oil! It's so good! I added some slivers of red onion, grape tomatoes & feta cheese. Husband licked his plate when he thought I wasn't looking. Next time I will add mushrooms. Actually, one could add/change just about anything except the tuna in olive oil, lemon juice, capers & Kalamata olives. They're what makes it.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous summer meal! I've made this many times and everyone loves it. We've found that this recipe needs the best and freshest ingredients one can find as there is no cooking (other than the pasta) involved. I use the oil from the tuna to measure 1/4 cup and don't bother with the additional olive oil. The depth of flavor is excellent - the lemon zest and juice make this a refreshing entree for the warm weather. LOVE this stuff!

Rating: 4
Loved it! At the spur of the moment couldn't find any tunna tonno (oil) so had to use straight tuna in water. Found that It was dry and kept adding oil. I think next time I will add some light italian dressing instead to thin it out. Also just an idea which I intend to try. Why not try using Trader Joe's Artichoke Antipasto in a 12 oz. jar. It can stand on its own and I can just imagine the marvelous things it could do for this pasta salad. The second day (if you have any leftovers, which I doubt) it is even better. The nice thing about taking this to pot lucks or picnics is that you don't have to worry about it spoiling as with mayo. Enjoy! I didn't want to spend the $4 for the fancy olives so I used the humble black olive, and it was still delicious.

Rating: 4
We love this and make it all the time- the only thing I change is to cut down a bit on the olive oil- otherwise, don't change a thing- the olive oil packed tuna is so much more flavorful, don't use the water packed, it's not worth it.

Rating: 4
A perennial favorite, especially in the summer when hot dishes just DON'T work. Skip the extra olive oil, though. The oil from the tuna and artichokes is MORE than enough. The real secret? Don't skimp on the lemon zest. This makes a really good dish into one of those things people LOVE! I agree with the cook who said it's a great potluck dish. I've actually taken away empty gallon bowls from cookouts!

Rating: 3
Yummy yummy yummy!! To cut down on fat, I used tuna packed in water, and didn't add the oil, although I do admit to using a couple tbsp's to sautee the capers along with 1/4 cup sliced onions. I wonder if some canned mushrooms wouldn't be a good addition? Used bowtie pasta

I use Sweet Sue packaged chicken instead of tuna (much better than it sounds), increase the artichoke hearts, and use different types of pasta--bowtie,etc. This is tangy, delicious, very easy to make, great for potlucks at work. It makes 4 very large servings (or 6-8 average ones).

Rating: 3
We enjoyed this. I do not have italian tuna, but water packed worked as did artichoke hearts canned in water. The capers were added as we served because they are loved and hated here. I love the other suggestions, tomatoes and anchovies. I did add some diced celery for crunch and will use it again. The lemon on the artichoke hearts was delicious. Red pepper flakes and parmessan or feta cheese rounded out the dish. This is definitely worth doing as written or improvised again.

Rating: 3
Followed the recipe except that I added halved cherry tomatos and minced garlic to the salsa. I suggest perhaps reducing the amount of pasta in order to further appreciate the salsa. I also will add more artichokes next time. We also want to try the salsa on a baguette for a modified version of pan bagna

Rating: 4
This recipe is similar to one that I enjoy at a restaurant in Half Moon Bay, CA. I used fresh (peppered) tuna grilled very rare and sliced thin. I added more oil, capers and olives, too. My husband and I like full-flavored food, so for us, it could have used a little more zip. Next time I will add some chopped anchovies and thinly sliced fresh garlic. Really good, though, and very easy.

Rating: 4
Excellent, easy and the kids loved it (our kids eat what we eat or they go to bed hungry - try it and you won't believe what they'll try and like). Instead of canned tuna, I grilled 1.5 lbs. of fresh tuna steak over real mesquite charcoal briquettes (cook it rare or you'll ruin it; and get rid of that propane grill and re-discover flavor with charcoal - it's worth the effort), sliced it thinly and mixed it in. I'd also recommend FRESH flat leaf parsley (i.e., the opposite of what you can buy at most grocery stores). It makes the dish. After I started planting parsley in my garden several years ago, I just can't bring myself to buy that flavorless stuff they have at the grocery store. You won't believe the difference in aroma and flavor intensity of fresh-out-of-the-garden parsley compared to grocery-store-bought. It grows like a weed, comes back great after pruning and doesn't flower and die in two weeks like cilantro.

This is such a good easy recipe. It takes almost no time to throw together, and it's really good for you.

I made this for dinner on day 7 of an 8 day sea kayaking trip. It was delicious, even though I had to substitute dried parsley. I know everyone will think "yuck", but we were camping!! I used some Italian artichoke hearts packed in olive oil - very nice - and some locally canned tuna from a very small producer - great stuff. This dish has great flavor and zip and was a wonderful meal to enjoy at our campsite in the San Juan Islands. Our group enjoyed this so much that I will need to make it for next year's trip.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed it as given although probably cut the oil a little bit. The combination of flavours is great. I'm not a huge fan of kalamata olives on their own as I find them bitter but thought they would work well in this and they do. There's a real depth and intensity of flavour. It's very easy to make (obviously) so the result completely outweighs the effort required. It's great - I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe reads like a simple tuna pasta salad, but it tastes and looks surprisingly delicious and far more gourmet. And I don't even like olives much. I really like the combination of the hot pasta and the room temperature/cold salsa cruda. BTW, I tasted the salsa cruda alone and thought, this is OK -- tasted the pasta alone and thought, this is a little salty -- then combined them and really loved the dish! I omitted the olive oil, used tuna packed in water, and didn't miss anything. BTW, I think this dish works better with shells instead of penne because the salsa cruda has something to stick to.

This dish really is beautiful and bursting with big flavors. Easy to make, too. And it's a great summer dish, because the combination of the room-temperature salsa cruda and the cooked pasta produces a warm dish (rather than hot), which seems lighter than standard pasta dishes.
