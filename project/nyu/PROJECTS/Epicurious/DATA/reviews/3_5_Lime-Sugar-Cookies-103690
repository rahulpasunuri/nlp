This recipe is WONDERFUL! It is easy to make and a quick one. I did not use the shortening so instead I used a whole stick of VERY soft butter..it was so soft it was almost melted. I also did not roll and refrigerate them i used this as a drop cookie recipe. I must say it is one of the best cookies I have come across and even with the insane humidity that we have had this summer they stood up beautifully. Also, i used organic sugar which completely changes the whole taste as well as instead of limes i used lemons as that was all i had on hand. i cannot wait to make this one again..perhaps tonight! Happy baking.

I used butter only and traded lime sugar for lavender sugar, got compliments from everyone who tried them. Goes great with fresh lemonade!! A nice light sugar cookie rather than a heavy one.

Best sugar cookie recipe I've tried in a while! I made some with lemon, as well.

One thing I forgot to add- the lemon version is even better! With the lemon sugar zest, I put most of it on before they went into the oven. Very delicious!

I love this sugar cookie recipe! I followed it every but except I had run out of wax paper so i went ahead and spooned the mix onto a cold baking sheet. I also used a grater with an attached little reservoir for keeping all the yummy shavings. I may end up putting the lime sugar on right before they need to come out of the oven.

These are really great cookies and are perfect for a summer time dessert. I did add a bit more lime juice than called for and they were very limey. I would definitely recommend these.

This is basically just a really sweet sugar cookie. The lime flavor did not come through as much as I had hoped. If I make them again, I would add a bit of lime juice or lime oil to boost the flavor. Also, the lime sugar sprinkled on the top is not necessary, The cookies are almost too sweet to begin with. And if you do plan on using the lime sugar, know that the recipe makes over 2 cups of the stuff. You only need 4-6 tablespoons to sprinkle the entire batch. Thats a huge amount of sugar I threw away.

they were great! I would love to make them again I liked the lime taste with the sugar. They taste sweet but they made me thirsty. I would say to go with these cookies! YUM!!!!

A tweak to my previous post - the all-butter batch wasn't as flavorful right out of the oven, but a day or two later the lime taste was much more pronounced, and the cookies had a very tender texture. Delicious!

I've made these cookies twice - once as written, once all-butter, trying for a more tender cookie. Using all-butter, the richness overwhelmed the delicate lime flavor. The next time I make these (and I will!) I'll stick to the recipe and bake them a minute or two less. Very tasty - perfect for a picnic or cookout.

These cookies are amazing! I did tweak the recipe a bit, though... I put about 3 limes into the sugar, even though it was quite liquidy. I tried rolling the dough into the wax paper, but that did not work at all. Just put the dough in the bowl you made it in and stick it in the freezer for a few hours. Also, under- cook them so they aren't hard when they come out! They are great and I highly recommend them!

Didn't make as written. Used all butter instead of shortening, used a lime zester instead of a food processor, and used 1 cup lime sugar and 1/2 cup regular sugar and rolled dough into balls, rolling again in lime zest and flattening slightly before baking. They were great! would likely be too bland as other reviewers suggested without the extra lime zest.

Followed previous reviewers' recommendations and rolled the dough into small balls, rolled them into the sugar, and then dipped a glass into the sugar to press them thin. These are good, not amazing. I'd add more zest to the dough next time.

Very delicate, tender cookie; I actually just added grated lime zest directly to the dough instead of making the lime sugar, and then rolled the cookies into balls and flattened them with a glass dipped in more sugar and lime zest. GREAT flavor!

These were a big hit at two separate parties! I left the dough in the fridge for 2 days,(well wrapped) and they cooked up nicely. I like the idea of rolling in the sugar. I used more of the lime sugar in the cookie recipe, replacing the plain sugar, and the lime flavor was more pronounced.

I actually rolled the dough into balls, rolled them in the lime sugar and flattened them on the sheet before baking. Got a lot of raves on this variation (more than when I made them as instructed). Excellent for hot summer weather.

Not very interesting. Quite bland despite adding a bit of lime juice to the dough to see if this would help. However, one of my guests said that she enjoyed them.

I made the unfortunate mistake of baking these cookies in the middle of a very cold new england weekend. Although they were excellent (light, sweet, but brisk) they would probably be even better in a summer menu. A zester worked like a charm.

These cookies look a little odd...but taste amazing and are a big hit around the office. They are very summer evocative.

These are delicious. I followed other reviewers' advice about putting the topping on immediately upon removing the cookies from the oven. It helped some. The dough is very soft and must be chilled before shaping. Even though I refrigerated it 24 hours after shaping, the dough spread quite a bit and produced a thinner cookie than the picture shows. The taste and delicate texture overcome these problems.

I have tried alot of different variations of lime cookies or lime shortbread. This is my second favorite one!! It's textuure is great, compliments from everyone on them!! I also took Key Lime juice and mixed it with powdered sugar and grated in some lime zest. That really livened them up. Really Great!

Great Flavor and texture. Cookies are best eaten within 24 hours -- in that they got a bit too crunchy after that.

These are just wonderful. I came up with a solution for the sugar fall-off. I used a cheese shaker and sprinkled/shook the lime sugar on the tops of the cookies BEFORE baking, then again immediately after taking them out of the oven (before taking them off the pan). They come off the pan easier if they are a bit browned but not overdone. Very good!

Pretty good. My husband, who is not wild about typically sweet cookies, loved these. My kids did, too, but for them, I'd change the topping to a less crumbly confectioner's sugar & cream glaze, loaded of course with lime zest. I'd also add more zest to the dough.

This simple but unique recipe is fabulous! Their light texture and fresh taste makes these cookies great for the spring/summertime. The only setback is that the lime sugar tends to fall off the tops of the cookies when you move them into another container. Make sure to sprinkle the tops of the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven, and be careful when transferring to the storage container.

These were good. I like lime, so I added more zest and some lime oil to the cookie dough and also a drop into the sugar mixture, which made a big difference. I cut them a little thinner. they took about 8 minutes to bake. These are good with a cup of strong coffee.

My guests loved these. The dough is somewhat soft; I suggest chilling a little before shaping into the log. The dough spreads some, so there needs to be about 2 inches between when placing on cookie sheets; 1/2 inch is far too little. I have a citrus zester which made quick work of preparing the lime rind.

Simply a mediocre recipe, starting with the cookie dough, which is rather flavorless and undistinguished. The lime sugar addition is more bitter than tart. The whole thing is rather unsalvageable.

Great recipe! Lime sugar really gives the cookies a kick! The dough was a little sticky to make into a round log, so I recommend chilling it for a 1/2 hr. and then reshaping it and chilling it the remainder of the time.
