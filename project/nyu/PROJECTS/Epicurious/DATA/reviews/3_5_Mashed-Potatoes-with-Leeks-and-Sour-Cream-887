Delicious! Next time I need to use fewer leeks, though. I had small leeks, so had to estimate the equivalent amount. Does anyone know roughly how many cups of sliced leeks should be used? Many thanks. Will make this again!

I couldn't resist and added some diced bacon. Loved it!

I enjoyed this version of mashed potatoes, but didn't LOVE them. I left the skins on (which I usually like) but it created an unpleasant color so I wouldn't recommend it. I also found the consistency to be a bit too pasty for my taste and was even careful not too add too much water. Will make again when leeks are looking good.

Also nice with a bit of horseradish or mustard.

I have made this recipe many, many times now - certainly at many Thanksgivings. It is a favorite each time. You can mix with the proportions I have found to suit your taste for creamy vs. starchy potatoes ...

Made this recipe last Thanksgiving for friends in London, UK. Great success. So much so, it has been specially requested for this year's Thanksgiving too! altho' def. agree with previous reviews, best to add extra sour cream.

I really liked this recipe. It's the first time I've made mashed potatoes by following a recipe (usually I make up a garlic mashed based on taste). I had never used leeks before and only put in 3 instead of 4. It definitely needed the fourth of course (sorry I didn't trust you!). And the way the potatoes and leeks are cooked together worked beautifully. It was a smooth and tasty dish. Thanks!

The leeks give a nice suble flavor to the potatoes. I added a little extra sour cream and 1 tbs. butter. Delicious!

This is a great combination and easy to make. I agree, however, that it wouldn't hurt a bit to double the amount of sour cream.

Scrumptious! I'm taking these to someone's house for Thanksgiving dinner. I can't wait to see how they are received. My taste tester at home declared them 'the best'!

Use only 2 cups of water, easy to make and the leeks boiled with potatoes made the kitchen aroma delightful, made a hit at our Thanksgiving feast.

Very easy, and great flavor. Next time I would use less water (I had to drain some off), and I would cook the leeks on a lower temperature (medium-low to low) to prevent them from browning too fast. I loved this, and will make it again. This is one of those great recipes that you probably won't have to measure out the ingredients for, just eye-ball it.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner...what a hit! Everyone raved about it. The sour cream and leeks add a great touch!

super yummy! i agree with the other reviews...cut down the water a bit and add more sour cream (only a quarter cup extra in my opinion, but if you love sour cream go for a little bit more). also....make this dish early and let it sit for a while, the flavor triples! i brought this dish to a thanksgiving party and found out later that other people where taking credit for it! absolute comfort food gold!

This dish was excellent! Our children (who usually balk at leeks and sour cream) even enjoyed it. I will definitely add this to my arsenal.

I had a bad feeling about this recipe - way too much water! After cooking, the leeks completely disintegrate into the overly watered potatoes. The end result shows - complete lack of richness or real taste - only a watery flavor, and that's with reducing the amount of liquid. This recipe would be improved dramatically if the potatoes were cooked separately from the leeks and they were combined at the end.

Very easy, very nice, good dish for company (tastes impressive without being a lot of work). The flavors really do come together well if you let it sit for a few hours before serving. The only thing I changed was increasing the amount of sour cream to about 3/4 C. Everyone loved this dish.

I made this recipe for my first-ever dinner party. Not a big fan of potatoes, but these were DELICIOUS! One tip, don't overcook the leeks. They start to taste a little sweet, not the image that best suites these taters.

Very easy to make and tasty. The sour cream and leeks give a great taste. I used olive oil to saute so it was low cholesterol as well.
