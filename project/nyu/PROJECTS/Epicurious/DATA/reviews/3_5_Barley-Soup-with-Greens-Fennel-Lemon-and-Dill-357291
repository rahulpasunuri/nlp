This is really good but you need all of the ingredients especially the feta!

This was the first dish of the new year - resolutions forced us to try and be healthier. My husband was pleasantly surprised. It as not too difficult to prepare and had more flavor than I was expecting. The barley makes it feel more substantial. Overall will stay on the recipe list especially in the cold winter months.

I had to invest a lot of thought and time at the end of preparing this soup -- before adding lemon juice (I wound up putting in about 1/4 c), salt & pepper (lots), NUTMEG (about 3/4 t), and a big pinch of cayenne, it was all but flavorless (include the feta or forget it!). The soup was, after all that, pleasant but no great shakes. . .my friends were pretty good sports, and pleased to have a healthy alternative to all the rich food we've been eating over the holidays. Other reviewers have noted it's better the next day, and that may be, but I don't think I'll make it again. Not quite worth the effort.

Very tasty. Omitted the spinach. Will make again.

We served it with a marinated feta and enjoyed the mix of flavors. The feta help to balance out the dill.

Just okay - maybe too many flavors? Came out just a bit creepy...which is too harsh of a review since next day it got better, but I was surprised I didn't care for this as much since I love all the flavors in this. Worth trying to see if it's for you, I won't be making it again.

A fantastic soup! My boyfriend and I are vegan, so we cut the feta and added extra herbs (about a tablespoon more of each. As other reviewers noted, we did not add the spinach, and still found the soup plenty hearty. Try substituting wheat berries for the barley- they are wonderful in soup.

I am not a soup person but made this for my wife. Now I make it for me but let her still think it is just for her. Oh the sacrifices we make. I absolutely love this soup. Have not tried it with regular vegetable stock. I had made the Light Vegetable Broth which made quite an amount and froze what I did not make. I am about to use the last frozen broth. So next time I will try it with Swanson's and compare.

This soup was soo tasty! I browned the onion with mushrooms and threw in all of the greens (minus spinach) and added beans and barley and stock and cooked it all down for two hours. The greens melt in your mouth. Lemon, dill and feta really finish it nicely. My husband is greek and loved it.

I tried this recipe thinking it might be a palatable way to eat a whole lots of greens at one time. Nutrition aside, it is worth making in its own right. I did add garlic along with the onions. Using three different kinds of greens, plus fennel, plus dill, makes for a lot of rinsing and chopping. Next time I may drop the chard and use extra frozen spinach. Don't skip the lemon and cheese (parmesan works great, too!).

This was good & certainly very healthy, but the cheese is a must.

once this soup simmers and marinates for a bit, it's tasty, pleasing and filling. the feta and lemon juice at the end is a MUST.

Right so its nice little approach to Avgolemono, the Greek egg lemon soup served at Easter, but with lots of lovely winter greens and barley instead of rice and feta instead of the egg. It was enjoyable to make and really quite easy. That said, I'll be going back to my aunt's Avgolemono. It just wasn't really good enough to make again when there is a universe of receipts and food out there. I think most disturbing was how light the flavor was yet how ridiculously full it makes you feel.

Excellent soup - I am on my 3 bowl. I made it pretty much as written except no spinach and I added some carrots for colour. (And a big pinch of MSG because I am not afraid to admit it makes everything more delicious ;-) Really interesting flavour with the lemon and dill, and the feta is a must.

While my family said it was good, this soup was so unappealing. Maybe it was the skanky smelling veg broth from Whole Foods. It's expensive, too, once you buy all those fresh herbs. Will not make again.

I'm not going to rate this recipe, as I made some ingredient changes which probably affected the flavor. Process-wise I followed the recipe. If I would rate the version I made, I'd only give it a 2 out of 4 forks. The flavor was much too tangy for me. I used Swanson Veggie Broth. I couldn't find green Swiss Chard so I subbed Lacinato Kale along with my standard kale. Didn't have fresh dill, so I added one heaping Tbsp of dry dill. Since I had the fennel bulb attached to the fronds, I chopped it up and added it to the soup. No green onions, so I used leaks. Didn't add the spinach at the end, because the soup was so already so thick. The soup I made was hearty - I enjoyed the barley and greens, but perhaps I added too much dill or lemon. Not sure, but I won't be making this again.

We loved this soup even though I did not make my own broth. The photo, I believe, is a mistake. This recipe is contained within a vegetable soup article in the magazine. This photo is labeled as the barley soup in the magazine as well, but the soup appears to be ribollita, a different soup in the same article, described as a classic Tuscan soup made up of vegetable soup mixed with pieces of rustic bread. This one contains white beans, kale, chard, potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots, like the picture. The menu guide in the back of the magazine features a vegetarian feast which includes the barley soup. All menu items are pictured, and the barley soup looks different. More like mine looked, and less like a ribollita, which is what you see in the picture.

This soup is delicious and flavorful when made with fresh, good quality ingredients (suprise! Isn't that always important :) ). It's true that the garnishes are crucial- you need that feta, olive oil, squeeze of lemon and fresh ground black pepper! As another reviewer mentioned, the picture shows some additional ingredients in the soup. I added a can of rinsed cannellini beans and I loved the added texture and flavor they brought to the soup. I plan on making a second batch to warm me up today!

Pretty good. Definitely healthy. However as others have mentioned, the feta makes it, so if you don't like/don't plan to add the feta, I'd look for another soup; this one really relies on that salty, creamy garnish and is otherwise rather bland, in my opinion.

Rating: 4
This soup was surprisingly delicious despite the main ingredients sounded bland. I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable stock and it was excellent.

Great soup....perfect for a cold winter day! I made it with the vegetable broth as instructed, my first time making a veg stock from scratch and I loved it! Bouillon and box stocks can sometimes overwhelm the flavor intended in the soup. Added slightly more lemon to bring the soup more balance. Feta garnish is an absolute must! Make sure you use green chard, not red....this will yield a pink soup, unless you like that color in your soups.

I would have never thought to sprinkle feta cheese on a soup, but the combination of flavors here was really delicious. The only change I made was to use vegetable bullion instead of pre-made (or making my own) vegetable broth. Really great tasting, and packed with healthy greens!

Really good... we made it as directed. This soup is basically deconstructed stuffed grape leaves (dolmas, or dolmades). It has all the same flavors and textures. Easier than rolling all those grape leaves, too!

Very tasty! I used some homemade hambone stock to replace some of the vegetable broth. We added the parsley dumplings from the same issue of Bon Appétit. Will definitely make again.

This soup is tremendous. It's a bit of work if you need to make the light vegetable broth, but I'd highly recommend you do and then just freeze the left over broth for the next time. Two differences in my version: in the picture, it appears that there are white beans and carrots in the photograph but these are not contained in the recipe. I added two diced carrots and cooked them with the onions prior to adding them to the barley. Then, after adding the onions and carrots, I added a scant cup of cooked white Northern beans to the barley. It made the soup very robust, plus gave it good color and texture. Regardless, it's good stuff--my seven year old loved it and that's a big compliment.

This recipe is great! It's makes a delicious and filling soup. The only thing I'd alter would be using less kale and adding 1/2 cp more barley, but that's my own preference. But other than that it is one of the few recipes that does not need much tweaking at all.

Rating: 4
This is excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little more lemon. I wouldn't change a thing! My husband ate two bowls and usually isn't crazy about greens. I'll definitely make it again.

Yummy! I used red kale and it turned an obnoxious pink color, but the soup was delicious.

This soup is delicious and incredibly healthy. The lemon juice is clutch and so is the feta. I think I might double the amount of barley next time though.

We thought this was nicely stupendous. The greens are chief and the barley provides substance and chewiness. The broth is nicely flavored by the herbs and onions and lemon juice. I liked the drizzle of oil and the feta. Rounded the body.
