I made this dessing recipe and it had good flavor without too many calories! I added some fresh dill to mine because I had it and it complimented the meal. Served over green leaf salad, steamed asparagus, and baked salmon!

This is a good quick buttermilk dressing. I add 1 tablespoon of dried buttermilk, dried parsley from my garden a bit of salt and pepper, and use greek yogurt for more tang.

I love this dressing. I usually make a big batch of it and serve it over iceberg wedges or even chilled asparagus spears. Kids love it too -- a big plus in my life!

Good salad. Won't necessarily win any awards or anything, but good. I love the texture of red leaf lettuce. The dressing for this salad is the best part. Fresh tarragon is a must. I added a few tomatos for color. Will definitely make the dressing again for other salads too.

I liked it. Simple and easy. For the meat and potato crowd this is manna from heaven. I find that this is the perfect side dish to take to a potluck or gathering. I do like to add other veggies to it. Like grated carrots, jicama julienned, halves of cherry tomatoes, and radish slices. I use this dressing recipe for Super Bowl Parties when a Ranch Dip is needed. To do that, double or triple the dressing recipe adn add 8 ounces of room temperature cream cheese and give it a pulse blend to make creamy. I will add a full teaspoon of Beau Monde for the dip and a quick squirt of lemon.

I love this salad dressing! I have made it countless times over the last 2 years (usually with dried tarragon, since I can't seem to find it fresh). The dressing is always a hit with guests, and I confess I can be seen with a spoon, trying to scoop up leftover dressing from the bottom of my salad bowl, after having finished the salad. I will continue looking for excuses to make this dressing for years to come--I highly recommend it!

Refreshing and light, I added a little feta which really made a great difference.

I made this recipe and made a few adjustments for a Mexican twist and think it's great: Instead of tarragon, I added a bunch of fresh cilantro leaves (about 1/2 cup) and popped all dressing ingredients in food processor. Then, for salad, I sauteed some canned black beans (1/2 cup), red onion, and one chili peper, with some pureed tomatoes (1/4 cup). Once that cooled I topped the bed of lettuce with it, sprinkled shredded lo-fat sharp cheddar and poured dressing over it. Served with blue corn tortilla chips and it was cool veggie taco salad!

I made this for a client's lunch entree, and was pleasantly surprised at how good this dressing is. I was skeptical of the reviews, but I thought the thickness was nice, and the plus here is that it is so low fat. I may have added a touch more fresh tarragon, and that is the ingredient that surely makes the taste. I used white pepper and a touch of Diamond Crystal Kosher salt.

I really liked this salad and dressing - I skipped the watercress and just used red leaf lettuce. Also fresh tarragon is key.

I found the dressing was too strong on the tarragon and too weak on the other flavors. Also, it was a bit thin. Not really worth making again.

Looking to make a quick potato salad, I mixed up this dressing and poured it over some boiled, chopped Yukon Gold potatoes and added a bit more salt. Excellent! I am sure the dressing will taste just as good on the salad, tonight!

Finally - a terrific buttermilk dressing. This salad was light and refreshing. I served it with the pork roast with garlic and rosemary (from this website) and sauteed yellow squash. My guests raved and cleaned their plates.
