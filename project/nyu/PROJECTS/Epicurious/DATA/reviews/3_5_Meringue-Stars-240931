This was the first time I made meringues, and it was so easy! They had a nice, toasty flavor and weren't too sweet. They also look very attractive.

these were very easy to make. I made the mistake of making them for a cookie swap. the stickyness was a disaster.

I used this recipe to make the white meringue cookies for a Halloween birthday. Instead of forming them into stars, I piped free-form blobs, each with a little peak on the top to resemble ghosts. Once they were cooked, I dipped the bottoms in chocolate, as directed in this recipe. I used a toothpick and made tiny chocolate dots for eyes on each ghost. As a final touch, I made miniature paper party hats for some of the ghosts. The recipe was very good and the presentation was cute. I agree with other reviewers that the bittersweet chocolate tones down the super-sweetness of the meringues. I have not tried the espresso or chocolate versions, but will do that soon.

I have made this recipe every year since I read it in 2007. It is a hands down WINNER!!! Everyone who receives them begs for more every year. The only problem is keeping my husbands hands off them so I can give them away.

I made just the vanilla and dipped them in the chocolate. What a difference the chocolate makes! The bittersweet chocolate helps to tone down the super sweet of the meringue. Piping the cookies also makes for the perfect bite-sized treat; also a plus as they are quite sweet. Only gave it 3 forks because I haven't made the chocolate or coffee variants.

I started these at 2PM and finally finished at 8PM. Granted, there is a lot of inactive time (hours for cooking and cooling) but they are a bit time consuming. Delicious though! Mine came out looking just like the photo. I found they needed about 10 minutes in the freezer for the chocolate to set (the suggested 3 min wasn't long enough). I plan to serve them at our New Year's Eve party, so we'll see how it goes, although advanced tasting from the hubby indicates they will be a hit.

I only made the vanilla but they were fantastic and easy to make! I didn't fold in the sugar at the end (they were already quite sweet) and they turned out perfectly. Almost too good to give away!

A friend and I made these the other night. Two egg whites just weren't getting whipped in the mixer (I think because they were in the groove of the bowl), so we just decided to make the whole batch at once. Mocha meringues sounded good, so why not? They were amazing!!! We only got about 30 out of it though...I think maybe because I gradually added all of the sugar while beating instead of reserving some to fold in at the end.

Fun and easy, even for someone like me who doesn't have much experience beating egg whites. Made 1/3 recipe and used peppermint extract, as one of the reviewers suggested. Tried out my new cookie press, and the shapes held, no problem. I'm adding this to my holiday cookie list and next time will make different shapes and flavors and will try dusting them with cocoa and colored sprinkles.

I made a simplified version of this recipe tonight - I used regular granulated sugar, and made all the cookies vanilla flavored. I didn't bother with the chocolate dip - they're so cute and really quite tasty. Very easy to make - I love the star shapes for Christmas.

These cookies were fantastic! I made them yesterday using regular sugar, and made the entire batch vanilla. I don't have a pastry bag and so I just dropped them on the silpat using a spatula and spoon. So, they are hideously ugly, but oh so crisp and airy, and they melt away in your mouth. My husband requested I make another batch and add pecans. Today, I am going to buy a decorating set and make 2 more batches with chocolate and pecans!

I haven't made these yet, but wanted to comment on not having superfine sugar. If you don't have it (or don't want to buy it) you can put regular sugar in a Cuisinart and make your own.

forgot to add, that the egg and sugar quantities were the same in martha's recipe. hope this helps anyone else without superfine sugar!

I didn't rate this recipe as I didn't use the technique but just the flavors and their quantities. I used Martha's recipe, and found this worked for me because it allowed me to use regular sugar which is all i had and it was less fussy. I made vanilla as my base starter, separated into different bowls, folded in either cocoa or coffee and left one plain. Martha's version: Preheat oven to 175 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; secure corners with meringue. Fit a pastry bag with a small open- star tip (such as Ateco #22). Set aside. Make meringues: Put egg whites and sugar in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set bowl over a pan of simmering water, and stir gently until sugar has dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer bowl to an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Bake cookies until crisp but not brown, about 1 hour 40 minutes. Let cool completely on sheets on wire racks.

Sooooo pretty. I did choc and vanilla to decorate my cookie platters....and was surprised that everyone gobbled them up

These are fabulous! I tried the suggestion with peppermint extract and food coloring stripes inside the pastry bag and the result was a scene steeler. The only suggestion is use just a dash of the extract and continue to taste it to determine how much you want in there, as it is very overpowering. I didn't fold the last of the sugar in but continued whipping at a top speed. And lastly, if you have a problem with stiffnes after adding the sugar and flavoring (do the flavoring ALWAYS at the very beginning), use a bit (or more) of meringue powder. Awesome! Will definetely do again!

I added blue colorant and made them for Hanukkah. Mix them with the vanilla onea and made a great centerpiece.

Use peppermint extract and leave the meringue white. Paint stripes of red and green food coloring inside a pastry bag (from tip to wide end). Add white meringue. When you pipe the stars, they will be peppermint swirled. Very pretty.I've never thought to dip the bottoms in chocolate--a great idea.

I made this recipe with only the vanilla version. I added a dash of cinnamon per the recommendation below, and it was great. The addition of the chocolate dipping really made these meringues stand out. Do not add any oil, since it's unnecessary and will not let the chocolate dry completely. If you're not getting the star shape, keep beating until you get stiff peaks. It takes time but it is worth it!

I did not care for these. The coffee ones tasted burned and although piping them is a neat way to make meringues, mine didn't look any nicer for it.

I think the recipe is incorrect. Instead of 1 Tbs. it should read 1 Tbs. vegetable shortening. Using this method the chocolate sets up and remains solid even in room temperatue.

WysteriaJ how much maple syrup did you use and did you add it as you beat the whites?

To the person that could not get star shapes: beat the egg mixture again after adding the last two tablespoons of sugar - my vanilla stars turned into blobs after folding in the last bit of sugar, so I scooped them up and re- beat them. Maybe I didn't get to the stiff peak stage the first time or maybe I stirred the last bit of sugar too much? Anyway, they turned out like the picture after more beating. Also, the chocolate base worked well for me - no problem with melting for me. I used oil rather than tempering per the recipe. (I also did this step the next day.)

well, they taste great! I didnt use the oil in the chocolate - tempered the chocolate and it worked fine .. the only problem is that i could not get the star shapes .. mine were more like chocolate kisses. does anyone have any suggestions as i woul like to make these for christmas

I had no luck with this recipe and had to toss out two tries. I beat them to stiff and glossy peaks, but the star shape did not hold. After baking for the full time and leaving in the oven they were still chewy (and not in a good way). The taste was okay, the chocolate and coffee ones much better than the vanilla. Luckily they don't cost much to make.

I made these today and only wish I had read the previous review first! Made all 3 flavors exactly as recipe and all were very good. I dipped the chocolate ones first in the melted chocolate with oil, and had the same problem. When I removed them from the freezer to package the chocolate melted. So I used another bar of chocolate and melted without the oil and did the vanilla & coffee ones. They still melted a bit but no where near as much as with the oil. I would highly recommend omitting the oil when doing these. Only problem, ended up using 1 1/2 bars chocolate to dip the remaining ones. Can't wait to see how they hold up for cookie swap in a weeks time.

These meringues turned out well, although they aren't particularly different from other meringue cookies. I added cinnamon to the vanilla meringues in the last step and they turned out delicious. I did the chocolate as is and did not do the coffee. As I said, the meringues turned out very well. However, I had problems with the dipping chocolate. Usually I would just use tempered chocolate, but I decided to do the recipe with the oil addition and untempered. While the chocolate hardened within a few minutes of freezer time, it became soft and melty again as the cookies came to room temperature. Did anyone else have this problem?

I didn't have all the stuff to make anything aside from the vanilla so I decided to experiment a little. I made the vanilla and their texture was PERFECT! My next two endeavors were pumpkin...which had a not quite right texture and maple syrup (the real stuff from tree's). So...after the baking was done, which was time consuming (I took my dogs for a walk) I had the hubby be my panel of judges. The pumpkin was his favorite (best flavor gonna have to tweak the recipe to get the look I want) then the maple ones (which came out with maple crystals in the cookies, then the vanilla. The recipe was a great starting point and I will be making more for holiday gifts!

I made these today for a Christmas luncheon. They are delicious and unique.I only made the vanilla and chocolate and must store them for a week until my party. That will be the true test. They do take time but I think my guests will enjoy them. Follow the instructions exactly as they can be tricky to make. I will be curious to see if they store well for a week and eagerly await my guest's comments.
