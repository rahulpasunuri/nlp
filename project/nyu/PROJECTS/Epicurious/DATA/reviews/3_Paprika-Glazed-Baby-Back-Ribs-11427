Hmm. The instructions were ambiguous as to how long to bake, as are the reviews that range from 45 minutes to 3 hours. I went for 2 hours and stupidly forgot to check in the 2nd hour. After 2 hrs at 375 degrees, the whole pan was charred and meat so dehydrated that there wasn't anything to salvage. It smelled great though and probably would of tasted good if edible.

I appreciate the previous reviews. To improve this recipe, I increased the wine and water. This provided more sauce for passing.

Thought these were good not great. There are far better rib recipes on epicurious.

Terrible !!! Very little taste - - tough and hard to get off the rib bone. Sorry, but this is one I will not recommend.

Very disappointing recipe. The cooking technique left the ribs with a weird texture and taste, even though I used a good red wine and premium paprika.

Excellent. I used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and the ribs tasted great.

Excellent method to cook pork - marinade keeps very moist. Cook for 45 minutes only! I had to add a little liquid to my pan to prevent burning -(could be because I halved recipe). Then deglazed with a little water and intense plum jam I made last year. MAKE SURE TO ALTER COOKING TIME!

I was sooo disappointed. After reading the reviews I thought this recipe would be great. I'm not sure what was up, but I had a ton of liquid at the end. My sauce never reduced enough to thicken. Granted, I doubled the recipe, but I had about 8lbs of ribs??? I even added the apricot jam at the end like some other reviews suggested. I let the ribs cook for better than 1 & 1/2 hours. It was just O.K. & not worth making again.

This is a fabulous recipe. My thanks to previous reveiwers for their tips about adding sugar or apricot preserve to the sauce... I used about a tblsp of apricot jam, extra cracked pepper and a splash of Worchestershire to finish it off. I also used a crock-pot (4 hours, High) with great results. This is a must-make for ribs lovers.

Made these for a work luncheon. HUGE hit. I doubled the recipe and used 3 tablespoons sweet paprika and 1 tablespoon hot Hungarian. During the last 45 min I put brown sugar over the ribs. The result was a wonderful spicy/sweet combination. The taste was outstanding. I cooked for a total of 3 hours until falling off bone.

Delicious and easy. A very popular item at my tapas party. I think the recipe is great as is, except for the odd way the cooking time is described. The ribs were ready after 45 minutes. BTW - for any readers looking to cook tapas, I highly recommend TAPAS by Penelope Casas.

Excellent recipe. Took others' advice and deglazed pan with some strawberry preserves I had made this summer after pooring off the grease from the drippings. Added some red wine vinegar to the dipping sauce made to give it back some bite.

Yummy! A big hit at my tapas party. I had lots of sauce so I reduced it a bit and added some peach jam, which gave it a sweeter flavour.

Nice recipe. I took the suggestions of other cooks and used 2T. vinegar and 1T. sherry and they had a pleasant taste. I also scraped up the remnants from the pan after the ribs cooked and used that plus extra red wine and apricot spread to make a dipping sauce. My ribs only needed to cook 45 min. to an hour, though, so be careful to check on them when cooking!

made this as an addition to my regular red sauce BBQ ribs for a recent party and was a great sucess - took the suggestion and purchased at our local Overland Park -Pensky's spice store Sweet Paprika - and found Sherry Vinegar right down the street at the Whole Foods Store in Overland Park ---Dip sauce idea worked great!

Excellent! After the roasting was done, I deglazed the roasting pan w/vinegar, poured the little bit of marinade left into a pan. I added a bit of apricot jam and some more red wine and reduced it....used it as a dipping sauce. A real hit at the Tapas party.

Made these for a tapas party and they were a hit. Following others' suggestions I mixed most of a jar of apricot preserves with the marinade after I cooked the ribs at home. Went to the party and heated the ribs with the marinade/preserve mixture and it became a tasty glaze.

I always soak my ribs in brine before cooking. This recipe came out pretty good. Sherry vinegar for the person in KS...I found it in a health food store here in Colorado called Wild Oats. If you have something similar they would probably carry it. My regular grocery store looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when I inquired about it.

Made this recipe for Super Bowl and basked in the rave reviews. I also did not have sherry vinegar so used 2/3 white vinegar and 1/3 good sherry. I increased the garlic and brown sugar and prepared in a disposable roasting pan for easy clean-up. Will try adding peach jam or similar to marinade once ribs are removed and serve as added dipping sauce. This was a great rec. from previous cook. Instructions for length of cooking time are hard to understand - just cook about 1 to 1 1/2 hours at 375 and this should work. If you are particular about spices then consider finding high quality sweet paprika for ultimate flavor. Enjoy!

I made these for a Tapas party. They came out wonderful. I could not, however, fine sherry vinegar. I substituted sherry wine. My guests loved them, very moist and tender. Help, could anyone find sherry vinegar?

Very easy. We left them in the oven for a full 2 hours - allowed them to cool in the pan, then re-heated them 5 hrs later. The pan was dry, but the ribs were still moist. Meat would fall from the bone when eaten - perfect! Next time I'll add some kind of sweetness at the end or when its time to reheat. Apricot Jam sounds like a good choice.

I love this recipe! I like to stir in a cup of Major Grey chutney when they are finished. (I am always unclear as to how long to cook the ribs. The recipe says 2 hours, or until marinade is reduced, about 50 minutes. That's a big difference.)

I used 2 1/2 lbs of baby back ribs and the full recipe for the marinade and after 1 hour in a 325-degree oven, the marinade had burned to the pan and was smoking. The ribs turned out OK, but a little dry.

Made these for a tapas party. They were very good and largely consumed even though my guests had already eaten a fair amount by the time they came out. They're convenient, too. Prepare and marinate the day before, throw into a roasting pan (I used a disposable), and cook.

I halved the ribs but 1/4 the marinade. Came out very well. Just like tapas I had in Spain. I used Spanish pimenton (smoked sweet papika) and 50 old sherry with a drikable red wine as marinade.

I made these for a party I am catering and they are wonderful. I couldn't find sherry vinegar, so I used 2/3 white vinegar and 1/3 Sherry, increased the garlic and brown sugar a little and stirred in about a cup of home made peach jam after they were cooked. I will make these again and again!
