I love this recipe - make them every Christmas and always get comments on them. The flavor combination is great and not too sweet. The fresh ginger is what really makes it for me. The recipe makes a lot of cookies too.

these were pretty good but I think you should use less baking soda

I love this recipe.not too sweet and the ginger is fabulous with the orange and cran.I made them a few times a few years back during some lean years as X-mas presents for friends and family. My family members started angling to get larger cookie packets. I do leave out the pistachios because i am not a fan.

These were really tasty - the combination of flavors is original, and the cookies were not too sweet which was a nice change. Maybe a little more buttery than I usually like, but I'd definitely make them again.

Oh my goodness, these are simply wonderful. The ginger/orange/cranberry flavors combined definitely make these different from normal cookies. I used all ground ginger instead of fresh and didn't put the full amount of fresh cranberries in. Turned out delicious.

I can't believe the voices of disappointment with this recipe: I've made these a number of times and I gave the recipe to family and friends. It even worked when my adventurous sister replaced the hard to find in Poland fresh cranberries with lingonberries. They even look great.

I can't believe the voices of disappointment with this recipe: I made these a number of times, and gave the recipe to family and friends and it worked well even when the hard to find in Poland fresh cranberries got replaced with lingonberries by my creative sister. They also look great on a festive table and would make a great gift.

Loved this recipe. They were a big hit. Flavorful, moist and a nice change. They balanced the sweet and salty well. Will definitely keep as a regular in my rotation. They are delicious for breakfast even!

I really hated these cookies. Away too much! The final product is a tasteless conflicted mass. Too many diferent things in the recipe. I never will make these again and I do not recommend this recipe.

i gotta tell you these weren't as exciting as they sound, so many ingredients confuses the palate, i've had better.

These were great -- I admittedly omitted the pistachios. Also added double the orange zest based on previous reviews. They were so moist, surprisingly light, and just perfect for the holiday season. A surprise hit. Will make them again as gifts for colleagues before xmas.

Subtle and aromatic combination of flavors that blend together perfectly. The fresh ginger is a great touch. Chunky and satisfying. This is the best new recipe I have tried in quite a while! Will defininely make again.

I made these cookies when they were first printed in Bon Appetit. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. Since I make them every Christmas. I follow the recipe except maybe adding a little more Orange Zest and we all love them!

I made these for a Christmas Eve party last year and they were a huge hit. These and the almond lace cookies (also from this website) were completely gone by the end of the night. Definitely worth making again...which I'm going to do tonight!

These were very delicious: a fiesta for the mouth! I increased orange zest and juice, so that the cookie was dominated by orange and cranberry flavors with a hint of ginger. The sour fresh cranberries are essential. The only thing that might improve the flavor of these cookies would be some white chocolate...maybe next time!

Wow!! These were sooo good! I added chopped dried apricots and used only fresh chopped cranberries instead of dried. I also made a caramel out of sugar, tangelo zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, fresh oj and a bit of butter-for the top...so good!! Enjoy.

Guess I'm the odd one out but I think these cookies are simply OK. I certainly wouldn't go back for another from a tray of other choices. And after the hassle of shelling pistachios, I guess I just hoped for better. I even upped the orange zest and added a little more ginger. Rather blah and uninspiring if you ask my family. One positive note, they aren't very sweet, so they will provide a balance to the richer more decadent items in our Christmas cookie boxes.

I couldn't find natural unsalted pistachios, so I used regular salted ones. This recipe took longer to make (since I had to shell the pistachios), but it was well worth it. I made it for a party and many people loved them. Several people commented on how "Christmasy" they tasted.

Soooo good! I didn't have enought dried cranberries, so I used part dried apricots, and I also didn't have the right nuts so I used sliced almonds. The cookies were delicious, and next time I'll actually get the right ingredients. And add lots of extra fresh cranberries- there are the most important part so don't leave them out.

A pretty yummy cookie. I also added coconut - it gives the cookie a bit more texture. I also used more orange peel than the recipe called for and substituted ground ginger for the fresh ginger and it turned out fine.

My boyfriend hates fruit and he loved these cookies and kept asking me to make them again. I added extra orange zest and they were terrific. They also keep well.

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper. I too will probably add more orange next time, but they are excellent even just as they are. I used Hazelnuts instead of walnuts, because that's what I had, and they were a huge hit!

Rating: 3
These cookies are really lovely, but I was surprised that the orange flavor was so subtle. They would be better named Cranberry-Ginger cookies. Next time I will try using all the orange zest instead of just 1 1/2 tsps.

Great cookies - very different and flavorfull, gave for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them!

Tastes like a sweet mini-cranberry bread. I split the fresh cranberries so they wouldn't explode while cooking, just in case. I also used all walnuts (no pistachios), and it was great.

I made these cookies for Christmas last year and they were such a hit that I'm making them again. I guess this is going in my "Christmas Traditions" recipe folder!

LOVED THESE!!!!! Make them!

Outstanding and delicious !! I made these exactly as stated and they turned out wonderfully. The ginger, orange, cinnamon and cranberry (dried and fresh) really packed in flavor. Even though it seems as if the recipe uses a lot of butter, don't skimp on it. My cookies were done after 14 minutes in the oven, so watch them towards the end of the cooking time. I will definitely make these again.

I made these cookies simply because I had a small amount of fresh cranberries left over and OOOoooohhhh! These are GOOD. Many people have written that they left out the fresh cranberries. DON'T! I made these cookies with the fresh cranberries and they were awesome. Some of the cookies managed to not have a single fresh cranberry in them and they didn't taste as good. The ginger really tastes great with the orange and cranberry. Plus it makes the house smell all Holiday-y! Definately a keeper.

This recipe is a definite keeper!!! I made gift baskets for the holidays and these cookies were the most popular items in the basket. I think the fresh flavors of the ginger, cranberries, and orange juice make the end result worth the effort.

I made this recipe with leftover ingredients after Christmas. WONDERFUL! Not bland at all, I was concerned at first with the lack of white sugar. They were excellent!

I made a few changes and it worked out beautifuly: skip the fresh cranberrys, cut the fat to 2/3 of a cup and make it 1/3 cup of butter and 1/3 cup of vegetable shortening. Also cut the baking time to 11 minutes and you'll have wonderful cookies.

I didn't have enough dried cranberries, so I added some golden raisins. Everyone loved these cookies. A good snack to have when skiing. The recipe is a keeper.

The red cranberries and green pistachios in these make them perfect for the holidays! I did modify the recipe a bit though: I left out the fresh cranberries, the fresh ginger, and the walnuts. And I substituted the orange juice for some orange extract. I did not like the way they came out of the oven in little balls (just like the picture) so I smashed them down a bit before baking and left in for only 15 minutes. But it did not impact the flavor and they are still crisp and chewy and delicious either way!

We liked the cookies a lot. However, when baking they didn't spread out but maintained their original dropped shape. It was difficult to tell when they were done because the bottoms cooked very fast, but the rest of the cookie remained very soft. Very much a holiday cookie.

Rating: 4
the cookies are light and delicious!! however too fragile to wrap up to bring to a friend's house for dinner. also the fresh cranberries are too tangy for my taste.

Rating: 1
This recipe was so-so. I left out the fresh cranberries because after adding 2 cups of dried cranberries there was more than enough cranberry taste! The cookies were way overdone at 18 minutes. The came out much better at around 12 minutes. I also made another cranberry orange oatmeal cookie off of the website. These were much better!

I thought these were an interesting variation on your basic drop cookie. I did leave out the fresh cranberries but kept everything else the same, and I really liked the flavor combination. As for the previous reviewer's flat brown cookies, try refrigerating the dough before baking and definitely watch the baking time since your oven temperature could be off.

Something happened with the recipe. The flat brown cookie I made don't look like the picture. Not so great on the taste either.

Very good, soft cookies. It was a long ingredient list but they turned out to be pretty easy to make. I used a 2 teaspoon cookie scoop and ended up with 58 cookies (cut the baking time to 12 minutes).
