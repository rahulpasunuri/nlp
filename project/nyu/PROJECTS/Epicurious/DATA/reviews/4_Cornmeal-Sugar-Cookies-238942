I chilled the dough about 20 minutes and formed them into crescents. I sprinkled them with confectioners sugar. Very nice looking and delicious. A double batch made about 30 small crescent cookies. Caution, they are very fragile until they cool.

Agree these are great, made last year and this. Definitely forgo rolling and wrap in fridge/slice after. I added dried cranberries and this gives a nice tartness and pretty color. Dough freezes well so they can be ready at any time!

i followed the other reviewers' suggestions to just hand roll these and flatten them with the bottom of a water glass dipped in sugar. perfect! these are incredibly light, lemony, and buttery - the texture is beyond compare, esp if you like the crunch of cornmeal. make them - they take 15 minutes including the baking!

I really thought that "cornmeal sugar cookies" didn't really sound good. They were just an experiment. But I was proved wrong. The moment they got out of the oven someone took a nibble, and that was the end of the lives of the cookies. The lemon zest makes up for the dryness, (there still a little dry, though) but over all, these are some of the best cookies I have ever baked. These will be family favorites for a very long time.

Really yummy recipe. I added a little lemon juice for extra tang (maybe 1 Tbsp) and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup (I don't like them too sweet). They were delicious. I didn't have vanilla extract so I subbed half a vanilla bean, finely chopped then blended with the sugar. Yum!

Oh wow...these are so good...little yummy lemony ooolalala! I am not a fan (usually) of lemon cookies, but my boyfriend is, so I made these on the spur of the moment. So easy, so good...only problem?? You need to quadruple the recipe! Can't wait to have these with summer berries and whipped cream, but these will go in my regular cookie rotation! I know am a lemon-y cookie convert! ;)

To roll dough: layer of plastic wrap on work surface, place crumbly dough on it and cover with another layer of plastic wrap. Roll out. Easy, no mess. And you can re-roll as often as needed.

Super fast and easy, tasty and great texture. Used white corn meal because that's what I had on hand. Subbed lemon oil for zest (just a few drops of oil). Also followed the tip of an earlier reviewer by not rolling out the dough. I rolled the dough into balls, placed on Silpat sheet liner, then sprinkled sugar over and pressed flat with the bottom of a measuring cup. Worked perfectly. This is a shortbread-like sugar cookie, and the cornmeal adds that extra crispiness. A keeper!

These were quite delicious, I'd say they were above average.

Needed to make something to go with a fruit salad quickly and these were great! I did not roll out the dough (as previously suggested) but used my hands to roll out small rounds and then flattened each with a sugar coated glass bottom.This suggestion made everything go faster. Used orange zest as I did not have lemons.

Very good, just the way they are! Didn't have any citrus lying around, so I used vinegar. Still tasty, but would have been better with the real thing.

I liked these cookies a lot but have two suggestions. Softened butter does not mean almost liquid. Keep it slightly firm to prevent the dough being too soft to work. These cookies are very fragile so if you need to travel them lay them flat in single layers.

these are so good! I made one batch, and then made about a dozen more, gave them as presents, ate them, so so yummy!! and so easy. I didn't bother rolling out the dough, just made balls and pressed them down with the bottom of a glass and sprinkled with sugar.

YUM!!! What an simple, delicious and quick recipe! My daughter and I used a heart shaped cookie cutter for these and instead of granulated sugar for the top sprinkles, we used red sprinkles. So cute and surprisingly better tasting than I thought! :) I will definitely be making these again!

Fantastic and easy but don't even bother trying to roll this dough out! Using as light a touch as possible, simply roll a spoonful into a ball between your palms. Drop on cookie sheet about an inch apart. Lightly press flat w glass, sprinkle w sugar and press again. Job done!

Certainly put the dough in the freezer and pat the dough out rather than roll, then return to the freezer after cutting, but before lifting to ease the stickiness of the dough. I have made these 3 different times. The first time I made as is, and they were slightly dry - chalky to my taste, as shortbread can sometimes be. The second time I omitted the lemon zest, subbed brown sugar for the powdered sugar, and topped with raw sugar and pistachios, much better texture and taste to me. Third time I subbed honey and raw sugar for powdered sugar, omitted lemon zest, and made a filling of white choc./lime sadnwich fillinf. Much better again! This is a good, fast, versatile base recipe. Try it!

Spread some "dulce de leche" on these and off you go! Definitely chill the dough and consider processing the cornmeal for a smoother texture.

I love the sandy texture in this recipe. The dough is pretty easy to work with, not too sweet, and very addictive.

Very delicious! Many people raved about this cookie. I substituted lime zest and used more it than called for. Added more citrus kick with still the buttery sweetness. I could not roll this dough out, so I rolled the whole blob into a cylinder and put it into the frig for awhile. Took it out later and simply cut my cookies! Made it easier and less crumbly.

I find this to be a great springboard for a creative appetizer platter. Made as the round cookies, but skipped dusting with sugar. I then topped with various cream cheese spreads- both sweet and savory.

These cookies are delicious and I look forward to trying them again with different toppings - jams, finely chopped nuts, and maybe even cheese. One tip - I did not even want to try rolling out this sticky dough, so I just used my small cookie scoop. After the cookies were dusted with sugar, I flattened them out with the bottom of a glass. Much easier!

I also found the dough way too soft and sticky to roll. Chilling in refrigerator helped a lot. Rolled them thin with colored sugar on top. Great cookie. Crispy, not too sweet and simple. Can't stop eating them.

Made these again with following revisions: Threw the cornmeal in the Cuisinart before the other ingredients for a few seconds to reduce the grittiness of the cornmeal slightly. Made a better texture cookies. Also, used colored coarse sanding sugar for the top which made the cookies a bit more pretty. LOVE these!

Great dough, great crisp cookie. But - my family hated the cornmeal - they said that it tasted like sand. I cook with cornmeal a fair amount, so this is normally not a concern, but I did taste the "sand" element.

Loved these cookies! The cornmeal makes them delicious and crunchy. They are light, crisp and buttery. Agree with rolling dough a bit thinner and the tip about 15 min in the fridge is a good one. This is my favoriate sugar cookie recipe ever.

Agree with previous reviewers on most points. These really grew on us and now we love them. Definately good w/ raspberry jam sandwiched. Do not leave out the sprinkled sugar on top since they need the additional sweetness and crunch to balance the cornmeal crunch. I also rolled these out a little thinner after the first batch. Taste better that way. This will be a summer favorite!

I found this recipe to be frustrating. The suggestion to put the dough in the freezer would have been a good one as it was much too wet to roll out as instructed. I ended up adding extra flour and cornmeal and still struggled to roll out the dough and cut the shapes without ruining them.

We loved these cookies! I too followed the recipe exactly,except, I put the dough in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. Then I took it out and lightly floured my work surface. Rolled them out. Cut out, Took out of oven after 11 minutes-depends on your own oven. They were crisp and lightly browned on the edges. They are perfect! Best Sugar cookies ever ! Will replace my recipe for Sugar Cookies. THANK YOU !

These are pretty good, though certainly not the best cookies I've ever had. I followed the instructions exactly, though I didn't sprinkle extra sugar on top of the cookies. The dough was very, very soft and so I had to add probably another 1/4 cup of flour during the process of rolling out the cookies. The cookies were done after 12 minutes in the oven (in fact, I wish I'd taken them out a minute or two earlier). The taste? Pretty good. The cornmeal adds a definite crunch to the cookie and they're not too sweet. They're also very crisp - don't expect a soft or chewy cookie. After enjoying one on its own, I decided to turn these into sandwich cookies with some raspberry jam in the middle. The flavor of the raspberry jam complemented the lemon and cornmeal really well. I much prefer them as sandwich cookies than on their own.

If you like shortbread -- I do -- and cornmeal -- again, I do -- you'll love this cookie. The flavors are fresh and have just the right balance of buttery and not-too-sweet. The lemon zest is essential so don't leave it out. I found rolling the cookies to 1/3 an inch was making them much thicker than I like, so I rolled them to about 1/4 inch. Fast, easy, delicious, a good summer cookie; it has a permanent place in my collection!
