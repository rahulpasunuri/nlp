Fantastic. I started this the night before I wanted to serve it based on prior reviews and let the chicken brine overnight. The next morning I discarded the brine and spread the herb rub on the chicken and then let it sit in a covered dish in the fridge all day. That evening I braised it at 325 degr for 2.5 hrs with the lid removed for the last 1/2 hr (it was raining here, so barbecuing was not an option). Excellent flavor and incredibly moist chicken. Comment I got: do the same thing with the turkey for Thanksgiving this year! I did not need the chimichurri sauce after all, it was plenty flavorful as it was. Served it with tiny red potatoes with rosemary and sea salt. Will definitely make this again!

Made this just as directed, though I bought two chicken legs and two chicken breasts rather than butchering a whole chicken, because I was in a hurry. This dish was astoundingly good. We also had roasted fingerling potatoes, green beans sauteed with garlic and then finished with white wine and lime juice and Manchego cheese, and a salad with arugula, pickled shallots, and shaved Manchego. It was seriously the best dinner we've had in quite a while.

This is *exactly* what I've been looking for to take pastured chicken - much less tender than factory birds - up several notches. Instead of cooking all the way on the grill, I roasted thighs & legs for about 40 mins @315, then finished them on the grill. Phenomenal. I brined overnight and left the herb coat on all the follow day. The brine & herb coat is well worth the pre-planning. Not 100% sold on the chimichurri - there's a better recipe for it on epi - but it's not bad. Still, I'll probably skip it next time. And there will definitely be a next time!

This was amazing. I also brined and marinated the chicken the night before and think that this made a big difference with the flavor of the chicken itself. The chimichurri sauce was excellent and the meat so flavorful that it would have been fine without. I use a charcoal grill which can be tricky for uneven cuts of meat such as chicken parts. However, the meat was perfectly juicy and the skin perfectly crisp. It was alot of work though, and I would probably make it again for company rather than just my husband and I :)

I splurged and bought a fresh organic chicken to try out this dish. Since I was using a whole chicken I brined the chicken overnight and then marinated it over night,I cooked the chicken over charcoal. I decided to try my first bite plain, the meat had so much flavour from the grill I didn't think the sauce was necessary and decided to use it on my salad instead! Today I used the left over breast meat in a cabbage coleslaw with fresh raw corn, black beans tomatoes and green onions topped with chimichurri sauce. That was also delicious!

This was the best chicken I've had, definitely will repeat! I did make a few changes... Didn't have a bbq so I heated up a cast iron pan, seared both sides of each, then threw it in the oven for 23 minutes. Also, I used two whole chicken breast (skin on but boneless). Although I was wary of a two-day recipe during the middle of the week, 90% of this is hands off or blender time, so it was super easy and fast. Served with a spicy slaw and fresh black beans. Everyone Loved it!

A leftover chicken breast with the remaining sauce, the drippings from the platter and a little mayonnaise made two delectable sandwiches the next day.

I wanted to love this because of the ingredients and the glowing reviews. My guests really enjoyed the chimichurri sauce but thought the chicken was surprisingly bland. I used chicken breasts and maybe that was part of the problem. I will try it again using a whole chicken. Definitely recommend the sauce!

This is hands down the best BBQ chicken we've had in a very long time! The only difference made was baking the chicken pieces @ 325' for 40 minutes and finishing on the grill. Flavorful and juicy!

This chicken is AMAZING. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and through a scheduling snafu, I ended up marinating them for two days. Though it obviously requires some planing ahead, brining the chicken really improves its texture and should definitely not be skipped. I grilled the breasts for 15 minutes on each side and they were perfectly cooked (although I think because the brining adds moisture to the chicken, there is more leeway with the cooking time - another good reason to do it!). The smell was amazing as they grilled. The chimichurri sauce was also excellent - I didn't have cilantro on hand but used extra basil and parsley in its place. It added a very nice kick to the chicken, which I served on a bed of bulgur wheat. As someone else mentioned, it would really be great with just about any grilled meat or fish. All in all, this recipe will become a new summer standby for me.

Used chicken breasts and couldn't get pickling spices anywhere (substituted with what I could) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The sauce is great, guests at our BBQ were putting it on everything from steak to tofu burgers. Everyone was asking where I bought the chicken because it was so moist and tender but I know it was the brining and marinating that made it so good.

This recipe was so tasty! The chicken was moist and flavorful. We broiled it because we cant have a grill at our condo and it came out great! The recipe was followed exactly except that we used chicken breast.

Although this recipe takes a bit of extra time - it is worth it. I brined the chicken the night before and marinated it over night. I also made the chimichurri from the night before and i think that helped the flavors in it develop. After grilling the chicken (I used deboned and skinless chicken breasts) I sliced it and served it over arugula. The chimichurri was just enough because the flavors of the marinade had penetrated the chicken well from the night before.I will definately make it again and again. ( i served it with the garbanzo and green bean salad recipe from Bon Appetit - Aug 2010, pg 47).

Just made this today and it was really good and tasty! I followed it to the T!. No need for any editing. Chicken was tasty and juicy due to the brining process. The sauce was amazing. Adds a nice tangy zing to the the whole thing. Nice balance. I would definitely cook this again.

OK, a real review. This was delicious, the chicken (we used an organic one) was moist and really tasty, and the sauce added a nice, tangy flavor.
