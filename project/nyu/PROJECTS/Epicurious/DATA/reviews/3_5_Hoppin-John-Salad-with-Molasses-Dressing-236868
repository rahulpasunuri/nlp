My husband and I thought this was delicious as a warm salad with roasting the sweet potato and leaving out the okra. I could see deep fried okra sprinkled on top like tasty, crunchy croutons, but not done as described in this recipe.

If you are not a cajun fan, do not make this dish. I bit off more than I could chew with this dish for a Cajun/Creole themed dinner. It very well could have been my inexperience handling okra but these little things were slimy and gross. Surprisingly I enjoyed the flavor but texture was something to be desired. Too much cayenne for my liking.

I tried this recipe for New Years Day. It was pretty good but their are better recipes for Hoppin John. The peas where a little under cooked and the potatoes were mush. If I try this recipe again I will cook the peas for a while before adding the sweetpotatoes.

My wife is from Mississippi and she was very skeptical about any non-traditional Hoppin John. I am very adventurous in the kitchen and keep trying new things. Some are .1 fork and some are 4+. This is the latter. Incredible combination of tastes with the andouile sausage, the yams,okra and molasses. Trust me, if you make this, you will be making it again.

My company loved this - I served also with the collard greens and bacon, with oven-baked ribs as the main. I refrigerated this salad all day, and the next morning, added diced tomatoes and heated through...served over fried eggs for breakfast - delish as a brunch "hash".

A solid black eyed pea preparation for New Years, but way too heavy on dressing for me. I'd cut it by 1/3 next time.

Interesting combination. Will make again next New Year's, but not before. Served with excellent Collard Greens with Red Onions and Bacon from this site.

A huge hit with the entire family. Requested time and time again now. Served without rice.

Wasn't sure about the molasses dressing, but my fears were put aside. Dressing was not over powering ended up using all of it. Very easy to make. Prepared the vegetables 3 hours before hand then added dressing about 1/2 before serving so favors blended. Served without the rice. The salad was a hit at our 2007 New Year Good Luck Brunch
