I was very impressed with this marinade. Followed recipe exactly and it was very tasty. We eat lamb often and this is now one of my favorite leg of lamb recipes. Very simple and tasty.

It takes a lot to get me out of the Greek flavourings for barbecued lamb, but I took my chances on this one and wasn't disappointed. Will probably make a bit more sauce next time, for the lefotvers.

My family and I loved this lamb dish. You could really taste the red wine in the meat. I would make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, used fresh sage from my garden and it was good, not great. I probably won't make it again.
