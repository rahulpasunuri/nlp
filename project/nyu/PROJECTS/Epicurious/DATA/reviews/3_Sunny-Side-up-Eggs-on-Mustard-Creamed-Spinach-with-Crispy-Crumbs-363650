A surprisingly simple but delicious breakfast. The dijon mustard gave the spinach a rich flavor that was even enjoyed by those who don't typically like spinach.

This recipe sounded so good. I like all the ingredients, so why not combine them? Nope! Yuck!! Somehow the mustard brought out the earthiness of the spinach. It tasted like dirt! Maybe a different mustard would have a different outcome.

Made this for Hubby on Valentines Day for brunch, and he said "BLAAAH". The spinach just didn't taste good. But I thought that the recipe had possibilities, so about a week later, I made "my" version of "CREAMED SPINACH WITH CROUTONS" (from this site), and my changes were incorporated in my review on 10/02/04. I did press the excess liquid out of the wilted spinach before combining it with the cream sauce from the older recipe. Made 4 sunny-side-up eggs (2 apiece) and put them on top of the creamed spinach. Served with fresh orange slices and an English muffin apiece, it made a hearty supper, and it was VERY GOOD. I would not make the spinach or crumbs again as written in this recipe.

I am always looking for new ways to enjoy eggs as a meal. Unfortunately this did not live up to my expectations. The spinach was bland (agree with earlier review), mushy, and overall, this was not worth the effort. Would not recommend, will not make again.

This was excellent. The combination of spinach with dijon, and the crispy breadcrumbs was great. Then the egg on top finishes it off perfectly. Definitely will make again.

i thought it was overall pretty darn bland... and not enough to make a breakfast for two people with.

This was OK, but not worth all the work involved. The best part was the fresh thyme in the creamed spinach. I'll use that next time I make creamed spinach, which I absolutely love. The thyme added a new dimension.

very easy to make and tasty as well! i didn't have half & half so made it without and it was quite good. i think this would also be good with poached eggs -- will definitely be making again.

Quick and simple. Used slightly crushed croutons. My mustard seems to have disappeared, used curry paste instead. Awesome!

I actually only made the creamed spinach part, and served it with chicken cutlets with green olives, also from this month. I absolutely loved the spinach and the breadcrumbs. This is great stand alone and would be wonderful with eggs for brunch, but a fun/different side for spinach.

Super-yum! I would pay for this on a brunch menu. Very easy, quick brunch or light dinner dish with lots of zing. Made no substitutions. Use good Dijon (Maille) instead of Grey Poupon and a generous grind of black pepper for more flavor payoff.

The "crispy crumbs" were A.Maze.Ing. Thought the spinach (although I used kale) needed a bit more dijon boost. I would absolutely make it again, though.
