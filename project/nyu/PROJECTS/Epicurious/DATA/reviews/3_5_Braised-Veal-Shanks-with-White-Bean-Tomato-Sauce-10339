Followed the recipe as stated, though I cut the recipe in half for 2. It was easy. Best part was once it was in the oven we had time for Happy hour at the local pub plus a delicious meal when we returned. This is a keeper and very suitable for company!

Comfort food at its best, this osso buco-type concoction exudes flavor. I made one third of the recipe and cooked the meat and sauce in a pressure cooker for 35 minutes. The result was fork tender meat and a zesty tomato gravy which I reduced to 1 1/2 c and served over mashed potatoes. I've made several osso buco recipes in the oven and did not see a significant difference in cooking methods. I used ingredients specified and in the same proportions but substituted veal broth for the chicken broth and wine since I needed to use the veal broth. Hubby really liked this dish so it'll reappear on our table.

This is the quintessential veal shank. Perfect, no changes...in fact the whole dinner is wonderful!

Very tasty. Next time I will prepare it the day before so that I can skim off the fat, take the meat from the bones and get rid of some of the non-edible stuff that is part of veal shanks.
