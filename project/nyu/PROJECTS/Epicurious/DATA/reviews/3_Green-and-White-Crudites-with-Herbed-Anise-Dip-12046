The consistency of this dip is not very thick which I happen to like. When the veggies are immersed they do not stick to a sickening amount of dip but just enough to flavor the pallet. I did use fat free yougert but blended it with real mayo and sour cream. Maybe a "real" yougert would have thickened it a bit more. I am glad I halved the Pernod and used only a little less than a teaspoon of anise because any more would have been much to overpowering. Also, the grocer did not have chevril so fresh parsley made a fine substitute. The overall taste resembled a dill-like flavor which was different from the typical ranch style dips out there. I really like the gourmet uniqueness of this recipe. Also, just having green and white crudites (veggies) made such a lovely presentation!
