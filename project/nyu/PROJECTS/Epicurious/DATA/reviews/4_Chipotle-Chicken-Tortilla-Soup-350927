Odd recipe, the flavors are a mix of sweet and very spicy. We thought it was just okay, nothing we would look forward to making again. Recipe takes a very long time to make.

I only make the soup part and used a rotisserie chicken. After a few times, I made a few adjustments: leave out the rice. It just adds more volume and takes away from the tortillas. Add extra broth, because I like it soupy. And add bell peppers if you have them. I love the extra crunch!

This is a wintertime staple. I make a double batch and freeze it. The sweet potatoes and brown rice always make me feel better, the chipotles add just enough spice (though my children still claim it to be too spicy) and the toppings add the right flavors and textures.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes to make. It's good in hot or cold weather. It's packed with flavor and pretty easy to make. I usually use a full can of chipotles and add serrano chiles as well. Also, I never seem to have enough stock and I usually add about 4 cups of stock. The sweet potatoes are delicious, but are definitely optional.

This soup is delicious! The only thing I did not add was the rice and that's only because I wanted more broth. We're Pacific islanders so rice is a staple; you can always have a scoop thrown into your soup. This is definitely worth the effort, thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the soup was delicious. I disagree with other reviewers that you get the same results if you skip making the stock. The recipe makes a rich, flavorful broth that does not compare to store bought. This has become my go-to base for chicken soup. I sometimes use parsley instead of cilantro, depending on what kind of soup I am making, but the results are always outstanding, especially if I can get free-range chicken from a local farm.

This was really, really delicious but maybe not quiiiiiiite worth the amount of work as written. The thing that makes it awesome is the spicing and the pureeing step, so you could probably get away with using leftover chicken and a reputable bought stock. Anyway, I made as directed except I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste. It's great, and better left over (I'm eating some right now!)

The soup was missing something. It wasn't as rich tasting as I would have thought. Good but not great.

Excellent just as written. I took a whole can of chipotles and proportioned up the other ingredients and froze several tiny containers of purée I call "flavor bombs" to add to other Mexican soup recipes in the future.

Great recipe for using up leftovers. I used a bit too much chili in adobo (I puree them then freeze in ice cube trays ...really handy)So was TOO spicy for the kids although my husband thought it was perfect. I diluted the leftover soup and it was much better...for next time. I think a bit of chicken bouillon would enhance the flavors as well.

This is an addition to my last review-I left out the sweet potatoes. Certainly don't think this soup needs it!

I made this soup last night for my husband and he loved it! Since I don't have all day to be in the kitchen, I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded and added it at the end instead of brewing it all together for 3 hours. I did boil the veggies in stock for ~40min until tender and added 1/2 a chicken bouillon cube, but not sure that I needed it since the chopotle puree was so flavorful. I also added at the end 1 can of peeled and diced tomatoes and 1 cup of corn. I skipped the tortilla preparation altogether and just bought blue corn tortilla chips, but the soup really didn't need it. I topped the bowels with shredded low fat cheese, sliced avacados and chopped cilantro and squeezed a lime wedge on each bowel and served it up. Great presentation and what a delicious soup!! I will definitely be making this again.

My husband took one bite of this soup and said, "Wow!" I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but I used ground allspice and white rice. Amazingly enough, I didn't have to correct the seasonings - it was spicy, but in my opinion it had just the right amount of heat. A restaurant-quality soup with lovely complex flavors. A total winner!

Fabulous layers of flavors. I did cut back on the amount of pepper puree I added to the full pot of soup but offered the reserved puree to be added to one's own tastes.

This soup is really delicious. I did make the broth and paste a day ahead and then finished the soup the following day. I skipped the tortillas completely and it was still delicious. It makes a lot so is great for freezing and bringing to work for lunch. The avocados,limes, and cilantro are a must, so I chopped the avocado, tossed in lime juice and sealed in individual small pouches with vacuum sealer. The avocado kept wonderfully. Highly recommend.

This soup was excellent. I left out the sweet potatoes, but other than that followed the recipe faithfully, and everyone really enjoyed it. The level of spiciness is perfect, and contrasts nicely with the diced avocado topping.

I think that roasted chicken always has a better texture than boiled chicken, but I agree with other reviewers that homemade stock is always better than storebought. Therefore, I started from a base of some homemade stock that I had in the freezer, simply adding cilantro. However, I roasted and shredded a chicken to mix in at the end. I realize that not everyone makes homemade stock on a regular basis, but if you've got it, I think using that + roasted chicken, either homemade or purchased, improves this even more. Omitted the beans due to a guest's allergy and it was still incredibly hearty and great. Deep fried the tortilla strips since I felt this was so virtuous already.

I just made this amazing soup, and it was worth the time and effort. The soup broth was absolutely delicious, and I agree with other reviewers that shortcuts should not be taken. The only changes I made were to use some ground spices, as I didn't have the whole ones on hand. I also only used 1 Tbls. of the oil on the tortilla strips in addition to spraying with PAM. This is a WOW that I'll make again!

This was a fantastic recipe. The only substitutions I made were: butternut squash in place of the sweet potatoes and double the garlic. I recommend all of "finishing" touches, but fewer tortillas are necessary...I think I still have leftovers of those from 2 weeks ago!

DELICIOUS! Perfect for a weekend dinner when you have time to make the stock (which truly makes all the difference). I halved the recipe for just me and my husband, who said after a few bites: "This is the best thing I've eaten in a long time." Score! I will definitely make this again.

It really is delicious! I made it exactly as written except I only had 2/3 cup of LONG-grain brown rice, rather than the 1 cup of short- or medium-grain. I also prepped all the accompaniments, including making the tortilla strips, as directed. Yes, the final product is very thick, but completely enjoyable. Even with the required amount of chipotles and adobo the soup was far from too spicy. It is so rich, really, that the avocado garnish seemed overkill. I froze half of it to enjoy later this fall.

I just made this for a group of friends, and they all loved it as did I. The flavor is richly delicious. I was a bit concerned about the strength of the chiles (I jused less than one T of the chopped chipotle) but no one really mentioned that the heat was too much, and it worked out just fine with a bit of a zing. The toasted tortillas added to the amazing tecture and flavor, but the lime was the surprise ingredient (I served a bowl of sliced limes, cilantro and avacados for people to add to the soup just before eating). There were many steps to making this soup so it helps to make it ahead as much as possible. I cooked the chicken the night before serving, as well as the chipotle mixture, so I just had to chop the sweet potatoes and add the remaining ingredients. I would certainly make this again - wonderful flavors.

Similar to other reviewers, I made a "cheat" 1 hour version of this recipe using pre-made stock, a rotisserie chicken, and corn chips. It's still incredibly delicious! All of my guests raved about it.

Consistently good recipe - stock from scratch gives a savory brothiness and the synergy between chipotle and sweet potato can't be beat.

I'm an accomplished cook and this recipe is one of the best soups I've ever made. While I understand wanting to "quicken" the process- please don't. The amazing, deep flavor of this soup comes largely from its long-cooking stock. Make this one as written and be prepared to say "OMG". The only change I make is to buy organic tortilla strips ( already cooked) to top the soup. Fabulous!

Made this the first time for a Super Bowl party. Was told it was the best tortilla soup ever. I did make some addition based on other reviews. I made my own stock with (3) skinless bone-in chicken breasts. I didn't use cooked stock chicken for soup because it was really dry and had no flavor. I roasted 2 skin on/bone in chicken breasts (after rubbing with olive oil and kosher salt & pepper) at 350 for about 35 minutes. Removed the skin and shredded chicken - much more flavorful. I added (1) large can of diced tomatoes and about 2 T of tomato paste. For an additional garnish I added crumbled mexican queso. (Next time I might try sauteing onion/garlic/spice/chipolte mixture and then pureeing). It made a very large batch. It's a high maintenance soup but well worth it for special occasions. Healthy and full of flavor! p.s. - might be too spicy for most kids.

Bland at first. Delicious after I doubled the garlic, allspice, clove and chipotle peppers.

This is an awesome use of a leftover chicken from a dinner party. I ended up making the stock while I was doing the dishes. The next day I finshed the soup and made just a few alterations. I used chipotle paste I had in the fridge and used ground allspice. Other than that, I used whole wheat tortillas and used the technique that others have used...a little spray olive oil and sea salt to make it a little healthier. This was such a great dinner that I'm making it again soon! By the way, make it the way it is written and you won't be disappointed!

I didn't have time to make the stock, so I simmered 4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts in 2 qts of good store-bought broth, along with the cilantro and some carrot and celery. While that simmered, I started cooking the rice in another 2 cups of stock. When the chicken was cooked through, I took it out and chopped it, strained the broth, then used my immersion blender to puree the broth (and some of the cilantro stems) with the onions and garlic. I ground the spices separately and added them. I also added a 28oz can of diced tomatoes with the juices and a large (19 oz) can of black beans. I dumped the partially cooked rice in when I added the sweet potatoes, and then the whole thing only needed another 20 minutes or so. I was serving this to my 2yo daughter, so I only put in 1 teaspoon of the chipotle, then let the adults add their own to taste at the table (I normally keep a tupperware in the fridge full of pureed canned chipotles in adobo). i also followed others' suggestions to just spray the tortilla strips with cooking spray. Everyone loved the soup -- definitely making this again.

I am a tortilla soup snob and I Loved this soup. I did use the extra water for the broth as recommed by other reviewers. Also I used Pam on my backed tortilla strips to save on the fat count; they came out perfect.. I did throw in some extra carrots for some extra veggie servings. And I have a bad habit of eyeball measureing and the used a pinch to much pepper sause so some of my dinners that it was to spicy. Other great thing is now I have soups that lasts for day and I cost about $10.00 for a whole pot.:)

This is an amazing stew! Served it to friends and they all asked for seconds. Since then, it's become one of our all-time favorites. It does take some time to prepare, but I've found that it's a bit easier if you make the stock and spice paste in advance and freeze them. Then, you can just get a roasted chicken from the grocery, shred and add all the other ingredients, and it's a lot quicker to prepare. I agree with other reviewers that it's a bit too thick, so I use a bit more water and cover the stock halfway through the cooking time. We are very health conscious, so I made a few amendments to lighten it up a bit. It has the benefit of the sweet potatoes, black beans and brown rice for a high fiber content. I also 1) use only bone-in chicken breasts with skins removed for the stock; 2) use only 1 Tbsp of oil for the tortillas and toss them with the oil and salt in a large bowl before spreading on a baking sheet (6 Tbsp is way too greasy); 3) use much less salt than called for. These changes sacrifice none of the flavor of this fantastic stew!

Wow - this was AWESOME!!! I used a little more than 4 QTs of cold water for the stock and left it uncovered for only the first 45 minutes of simmering (this left me with about 4 QTs of stock - I like a lot of stock in my soup). The chicken just fell apart - i used a 4.3 lb chicken and threw in a frozen backbone I had in the freezer. The stock was great. Some additional changes: I ground the spices in a spice grinder then added to the blender; I added two heirloom tomatoes that I blanched, peeled and chopped (for last 15 minutes of cooking); left out the rice (don't like it); added frozen corn at the very end; topped with some queso fresco. I'm also a WUSS when it comes to spice (much to my boyfriend's chagrin) so i just put in 1 TB of chopped chipotles (seeds and ribs removed). It was plenty spicy for me. Also, check the tortillas around 15 minutes - mine were a little too dark around 20 minutes. This makes a TON so i'm going to freeze some in portion size tupperware.

This recipe is amazing! Just spicy enough! Like several of the other reviews, it does seem thicker than a soup&just add more stock in the second phase of cooking. I also added a can of corn with the can of beans. This is not a complex recipe, just time consuming. However, the layers of flavor are well worth the added effort. If you need to speed up the process, you could use a store bought rotisserie chicken and canned chicken stock and skip the homemade chicken stock step. Fairly large yield, so this would be a good recipe for a crowd. I will definitely be making this again!

This is great! The stock is exceptional, except I substituted parley for the cilantro (think it tastes like soap) I also addded another can of beans. The sweet potatoes worked well with the other flavors. Also, it had visual appeal.

A very nice recipe, definitely a stew/goulash vs. a soup. Not sure why the recipe said to simmer the stock uncovered, though - I had to add water after the water I first put in completely (and predictably) evaporated away. Store-bought tortilla chips worked great, as others have mentioned. Not terribly spicy to my taste, but a nice combination of flavors (I think the sweet potatoes are the key).

I hate being disappointed in a recipe, esp one that uses so many good ingredients and takes so long to make! Ugh. Something was just off in the flavor of this soup. I am really familiar with Mexican cooking and this just didn't do it for me. I don't know what I did wrong...it was something in the spice/pepper blend. I think if I make it again (which I probably won't) I would omit the raw onion blended in to the spice mix. Also the whole soup is WAY TOO SPICY. I made it with only 1 Tbsp of chipotles and I would reduce that again by at least half.

Rating: 4
This soup is really a winner. Feeds 10 people for sure and captures the flavor of Mexico. I worried that it was too hot the first time I made it, but after you garnish with the fresh avocado, cilantro and fresh lime juice, the chile fits right in. I've made it 4 times now, and my daughter once for a party.

Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! It was delicious tonight but I used the stock left from our St. Patrick's Day Corned Beef and Cabbage so I will probably not be able to duplicate how I made it today. I just dropped in some shredded chicken breast meat. I also did not bother making the tortilla chips from scratch but rather I used corn chips which work well too. It is quite spicy but not too spicy. Next time, maybe just a tad less chipotle for less spice. There's no need to chop the chipotles ahead - just throw them in the blender with everything else. I did not feel that it was that time consuming but probably because I had the stock done already. I even made this with a baby strapped on me!

This soup is time consuming, but delicious. I made the broth one night, refrigerated it, then skimmed the fat the next day before finishing the soup. Also did not use avocados or tortillas and doubled the amount of garlic, onions and chiles. I thought the sweet potatoes, allspice and cloves sounded weird for tortilla soup, but they were very tasty as a foil to all the other spicy, savory ingredients. Very healthy and flavorful when prepared as I did. Can't wait to make it again.

This soup is so good; unique, but not odd. I will definitely be making this again. I tripled it for our annual holidy party, using 6 lbs. bone-in breast instead of whole chicken. Be sure to remove the chicken from the broth before it starts falling off the bone! Also used corn chips instead of frying tortillas. There were no leftovers. Delicious!

So good! I made a veggie version, so when I made the stock I did so as listed but used veggie stock instead of water and of course no chicken. I then added fake chicken (Follow Your Heart Chicken Free Chicken) during the last five minutes of the cooking time. Warning: if you can't handle hot food-this dish is spicy, even if you remove the seeds from the chipotle. If you can handle a little heat it's worth it. Don't skimp on the avocados-really helps balance the heat and smokiness of the dish. Also, I didn't have whole spices available so used the ground version instead (without toasting), so it was easier to make and still complex in flavor, warm, and delicious.

Great tortilla soup! I omited the all spice and cloves because it sounded too wierd. Must be my San Antonio background where tortilla soup was invented! Also, I pan fried the tortilla chips in oil and let rest on paper towels to drain off the oil. Must add salt as soon as they hit the paper towel! I too used a 5lb chicken which adds a ton of broth flavor. The only thing I would have changed in this is to double the black beans. I will make this soup again and again!

Found this soup to be exceptional- and I make alot of scratch soups. Incredible depth of flavor and the sweet potatoes and avocado are the perfect "cool" counter to the spiciness of the broth. Totally different from any other Tortilla soup I've made before. The only change I made was to skim most of the fat off the broth after it refrigerated overnight. I also used substituted pre-ground spices ( in very slightly less amounts) rather than buy whole allspice and clove. I toasted them very briefly in a little olive oil, and then blended along with the other ingredients in my food processor. I'm sure it would be even more incredible if you ground the whole spices.

This is a wonderful winter soup. It's time consuming but not at all difficult and, as with most recipes like this, the more often you make it the easier it gets. I ground up an additional double recipe of spices and kept it on hand to use to taste. This soup is terrric leftover especially with more of the spice mixture added. I can never find a small chicken, so I used a 6 pounder, which gave the broth lots of flavor. I'll be making this a lot this winter.

For all the time (not labor intensive, just time) that goes into making the stock I expected more. I had to supplement it with bouillon to get any flavor. The soup was OK. Nothing special. I'm not sure what purpose that rice had, I barely noticed it was there. The sweet potato added unique flavor when eaten but again... just OK. There are better Tortilla Soup recipes out there.
