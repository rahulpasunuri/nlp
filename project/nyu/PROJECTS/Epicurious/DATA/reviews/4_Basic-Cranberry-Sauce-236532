This is wonderful, but it's also the basis for Pineapple Cranberry Sauce with Chiles and Cilantro which is what I went on to make. It was amazing!!!

Made it exactly according to the recipe and turned out perfect. The zest really brings a nice flavor to the berries. Will definitely make this again next year.

This is a fantastic no fail cranberry sauce recipe. Super versatile. I typically replace 1/2 of the water with orange juice, add a cinnamon stick and a splash of red wine. Turns out delicious every time.

What a great recipe! I have always made cranberry sauce and given it to neighbors for the holidays because none of them make their own. I can't wait to give it this year because this recipe is wonderful!!I didn't have Kosher salt so I had to use regular, just cut the amount in half. Now I'm going to try the one that uses vodka and Grand Marnier, sounds good too.

This was great! I made it for Thanksgiving and it was easy and delicious. I added some freshly squeezed orange juice and a little less water and it added just the right amount of tang.

Amazing recipe! Sure to please even the most hard-core canned cranberry sauce lovers! It was simple and fast, ending up far more appetizing than an Alpo style red log on a plate.

I was pleasently surprised at how simple and good this sauce is. We are having company for Thanksgiving, and I just couldn't bring myself to serve the canned sauce as was traditional in our family. I followed the recipe exactly. This was easy to make and turned out delicious! So much more appitizing than an ALPO style red log on a plate.

My sister made this at Thanksgiving and I had to have the recipe. Everyone agreed it was the best cranberry sauce we had ever had.

Very easy to follow however a splash of port and some of the juice from the orangejust gives it that extra kick.

If you replace the water with orange juice and honey for the sugar, now you've got something special!

Every year I look at all the interesting recipes for cranberry sauce and I have tried a few but I always find myself wanting this one. I have made it for about 10 years. When Thanksgiving is over I can stuff it into little pie shells or serve the left overs with salmon, I can make it into a salad dressing......I just love it's versatility. I also love that it lets cranberry be the star. That tart juicy irresistible berry flavor.

Excellent basic recipe for cranberry sauce. I thought it needed a bit more sugar (1/4 cup) but it may be that my cranberries were to bitter.

I have made this for many years and it is a family favorite.I also buy extra bags of cranberries, freeze them, and make this during the year to serve with pork roast.
