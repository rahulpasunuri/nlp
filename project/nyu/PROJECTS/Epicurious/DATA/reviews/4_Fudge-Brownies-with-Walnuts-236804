I loved these brownies. I used cocoa powder instead of unsweetened chocolate squares. Also, used a 9x13 pan and cooked them for 25-30 minutes. As a veteran brownie maker, it's always important not to overcook. Mine turned out fantastic. These brownies are moist, absolutely decadent, & divine!!! I will most definitely make these again.

I like my chocolate less sweet. 1 cup sugar worked better for me. I used beaters to really whip the egg/sugar mixture. Also, my first batch turned out a little dry, because I think I overbaked it - so make sure not to over bake. Delicious!

I tried this recipe while living in Milan, Italy where traditional baking chocolate as we know it in the USA is not easily found. Instead - I substituted Lindt 90% cocoa chocolate for the unsweetened and 70% cocoa chocolate for the semi-sweet. All else was as specified in the recipe and I must say these are among the best - if not the best - brownies I have ever made. A pan measuring 11.5"x8" produced evenly cooked brownes 1" in height.

Chocolate chips spoiled the whole thing. Maybe I used poor quality chips (Ghirardelli)but they did not melt at all. After I put the brownies in the fridge, the chips became hard as stones. i had to bring the brownies to room temperature to soften them a little. Other than that, the brownies have a very rich taste and nice texture. I don't think they need an addition of chips or chunks at all. I'll probably make them again, without the chips.

These brownies are amazing! I did have to cook about 10 min. longer than the recipe stated. I used an 8 x 11 glass dish with non stick spray. (the kitchen I was using didn't have the 9 x 9 pan).

Using a 9x13 pan these brownies come out perfectly, and you almost need to bake for 25-30 minutes. VERY fudgey, but you have to admit that you're warned in the title. Everyone loves this recipe and with a little powdered sugar (omitting the walnuts) this is a fantastic desert or treat. My suggestion to get the brownies out easier is to use Pam for baking. However they make it, the brownies just peeled off the sides and didn't stick to the bottom at all. Good luck!

These brownies are absolutely fantastic. Really rich and surprisingly moist. I accidentally put in about 8 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate instead of 5 for the brownie base but it turned out to be an improvement! Note that the "glaze" is kind of liquid-y but when it dries it really solidifies the moisture in the brownies. Excellent recipe. I will DEFINITELY make these again!

These were good but definitely should be made in an 8x13 pan - made them in the smaller pan per the receipe, and had to bake at least an extra 15 minutes, still not quite done. But yummy, in any case.

These brownies are AWESOME. Every person who has tried them have raved about them, I even had one friend joke that he would pay me for a weekly batch of these beauties. The only thing I would change is to shorten the baking time just a bit, to about 25-30 miuntes.

I made this without the glaze and thought they were excellent. I would have baked for 40 minutes, they were still a little too gooey when they came out.

As another reviewer said, these are exactly what brownies should be, rich and fudgy and chocolatey. I followed the recipe exactly but used a 9x13 pan, and baked for only 30 minutes. They came out perfectly. I will definitely make these over and over again.

These were great but very cake-like. Next time I'd use only 2 or 3 eggs. Also I couldn't find any unsweetened chocolate but using all bitter chocolate and then the chocolate chips was fine.

I made these for Christmas dessert this year - warm with vanilla ice cream - and every single person raved about them. Even though I am not a chocolate person, I found them to be amazing. Dense and sweet (of course) but not sugary sweet. The recipe is perfect as is (I am usually a big tinkerer).

This is a very dense, fudge-like brownie made for chocoholics. The "glaze" on top hardened to a dark chocolate layer after chilling and it was definitely a hit at the dinner party. I sprinkled the plate with powdered sugar and then topped the brownies with a large dollop of home made whipped cream. I am allergic to dairy products so I made the brownies with margarine and soy creamer instead of the butter and whipping cream but no one noticed. The whipped cream topping was the real deal and helped off-set anything they might have missed. I ate it "plain" and loved every bite and can't wait to eat more tomorrow! I used a 9 x 13" pan (the brownies were very thick and moist still!) lined with parchment paper and baked it for 35 minutes exactly. I omitted the walnuts, but think they would have been a nice addition if I had been serving people who like walnuts. I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again!

This is everything a brownie should be - fudgy. Who wants a brownie that tastes just like chocolate cake? Didn't change the recipe except I toasted the walnuts before adding to the batter and I put it in a 9" x 13" pan. I chose to use semi-sweet chocolate chips throughout the recipe. I'll never use another brownie recipe.

These are pretty good.They are super fudgy. Very fast to make with standard ingredients. I had bittersweet chocolate chips and they really upped the chocolate factor. I also put a sheet of parchment on the bottom of the pan, and that definitely helped get them out of the pan because they are very gooey.

This is one of the best brownie recipes I have ever tried. All of my chocoholic friends and family just love them. I don't use walnuts so I add even more chocolate chips. These are so wonderful and I will make them again and again.

I made this recipe exactly as printed and loved it! I am a huge chocolate lover, though. My whole family died over it and people at parties asked for the recipe. So, I guess based on the other reviews, each recipe appeals to different tastes. I do suggest, though, that if you are not a fudge lover, don't make this recipe. There was no false advertizing in the title of the recipe-these are fudgy!

I give it 3 forks WITH modifications...use only 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate (not 5 ounces) to melt with butter and unsweetened chocolate. Completely eliminate the 6 ounces of chocolate chips in the batter. Line your pan with parchment paper, lightly butter the paper, pour batter into pan and bake 45 minutes. Melt 3 ounces of semi-sweet chips with 1/2 a cup of half & half. Pour glaze over the baked brownies, cool, then refridgerate. These brownies are still intensely fudgey without the extra chocolate. Before cutting, remove brownies (with paper) from pan and cut on a flat surface (easier!). These keep very well in the fridge for a few days.

I gave it two forks because it is chocolate, and who doesn't like chocolate. But that is about its only worthwhile quality. I kept it in the oven for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for and it was still too "fudgy" in the middle. The recommended pan size is off--It could use a bigger pan. I will not be making these again.
