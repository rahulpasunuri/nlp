It is really important to use California apricots and not Mediterranean as they are not as tangy and are too apricoty.

Love this recipe. It is so easy, and is so impressive...and delicious! Every time I make this people rave about it. I do it in individual small ramekins.

These were easy, light and delicous. I used Turkish apricots, and did not find them too "apricoty". Also, I did not use all of the cooking water in pureeing them, nor did I bother to strain it. However, I did find that the recipe serves more than 6,and the creme anglaise makes much more than is needed.

Like a previous reviewer, my dinner guests and I all found the souffle to be too apricot-y. The flavor was over powering (and I generally like apricots very much). I might try this again using less of the dried apricots. The creme anglaise, however, was fabulous and drew rave reviews.

These were fabulous! I only had 4 suitably-sized ramekins, so I poured the excess meringue into 1 larger ramekin, placed them all on a cookie sheet, baked them for 23 minutes, and they came out beautifully. I made these using this recipe from the big yellow Gourmet cookbook, and the intro to the recipe makes a big deal about using California apricots instead of Turkish ones; however, I only had the latter, so I added about 2 tsp. of strained tamarind liquid of the puree, to increase its "tangyness." Also, I didn't strain the puree beforehand, and the souffles still rose dramatically and didn't fall for a while. Overall, delicious, and relatively easy because it can be done over 2 days. A keeper, for sure.

This made for an interesting conversation piece- the souffles were found to be too apricoty for most of my guests. I enjoyed it, but I would perhaps make smaller portions next time. Overall, a yummy dessert needing a little adjustment for my taste.

I was looking for a creme anglaise and this one is really super. I doubled the rum to give it a more distinctive flavor. This is foolproof and keeps well when made ahead.

Absolutely marvelous. I had this souffle in La Tulipe in the early 1980's and have been searching for it ever since. Sometimes one's memory of food can't compete with the real thing. Twenty years later, this recipe brought tears of joy to my eyes. Thank you so much

So yummy! Everyone to whom I have ever served this has begged me to make it again, and none of them believes how simple it is (though I must admit that sieveing the apricots is a chore). The corresponding creme anglaise recipe made far more than needed for the souffles.

This is one of my all time favorites to serve when having a small dinner party.

I used to think souffles were for the experts only, this was so easy and the best tangy apricot sensation - perfect after braised lamb shanks with caramelised shallots and onions!!
