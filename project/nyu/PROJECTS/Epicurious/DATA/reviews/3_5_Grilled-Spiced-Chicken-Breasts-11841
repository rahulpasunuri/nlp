I did not like this combination of flavors and would not make it again. Unlike some other reviewers, though, I did not find it too spicy.

Too spicy for generic taste buds. Salsa would make an excellent vegetarian spaghetti sauce. Family thought they were being served chicken cacciatore with chicken gone awry.

This recipe is fast and easy, made from ingredients easily kept on hand. We made it for company two weeks ago, and liked it so much, we're serving it again tonight.

This is a great spice rub for those who are tired of store-bought Cajun/Creole blends that seem to be made up of at least 30% salt. I made this after making the mistake of using said store-bought stuff as a rub (my bad, I should have tasted it first!) - and this worked beautifully. I used skinless breasts and "grilled" them on the Georgie. Then I simplified the sauce to one yellow bell, one small onion, a couple cloves of garlic, and a dash of thyme, cooked till the onions were tender, then added a couple diced fresh tomatoes and let those warm through, just a bit. It still tasted great as a warm salsa of sorts with the hot, spicy chicken. Try this dish!

This dish leaves a really nice flavor in your mouth. Since it was cold outside I made the chicken on the stovetop and it was still very good. I can see where the creole sauce would make a great soup base as the person before me suggested. It's a keeper!

I made this for a recent dinner party and everyone really liked it. The creole sauce w/yellow peppers was the best part by far! What a wonderful taste to have in your mouth! I had some of the sauce left over and made soup with it the next day. I used 6 or 7 cups of beef broth, about 1/2 cup of rice, 3/4 cup cubed ham and a can of great northern beans. With the creole sauce, it was the best soup I've ever made. Exactly the right amount of tang and texture. I'll definitely make this again.
