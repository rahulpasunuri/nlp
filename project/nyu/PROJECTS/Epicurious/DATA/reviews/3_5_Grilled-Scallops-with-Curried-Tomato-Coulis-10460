This is excellent and fast. I used canned, diced tomatoes and simply sauteed the scallops in a bit of oil. I also followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and served this with Near East brand parmesan couscous. It made for a nice combination with some corn on the side.

Not bad, would recommend blending a little after cooking for sure. Tastes much better on grilled salmon steaks though.

Made this as a first course. After cooking the tomato coulis, I put it through a food mill for a smooth texture, then added 2 Tblsp. cream to soften the flavors a bit. I then placed 3 scallops on top of the coulis. It was delicious and I will do this again.

This recipe was great! Even my husband, who is not super keen on tomatoes, loved it. Very simple to prepare, yet interesting w/ great presentation.

Another recipe where increasing the tomato mixture and serving over angel hair works real well.

This was wonderful, I thought. Mu husband thought it was on the sweet side. Made it in a hurry and didn't seed the tomatoes, still came out fine. Served it with couscous with leeks, olives and corn.

I served this with tomato and basil angel hair pasta and also coated the scallops in Italian bread crumbs before browning in butter, rather than olive oil. An absolutely delishous dinner!! I used a hand blender to whiz the tomato mixture - some prefer a chunky sauce, but I like smooth - it's up to the individual. Don't skimp on curry powder. I also did as someone suggested and used 1 tbsp of honey instead of the sugar and I think that helped improve the flavor too. I also cooked my sauce around 15 mins.

This was so easy and very tasty. I served it with Parmesan cous-cous and it was perfect. i did add quite a bit of pepper to taste to give it an added punch. Will definitely make again!

This is one of the best recepies I've ever found at Epicurious. Simple, elegant and wonderfully powerful without being overwhelming. Just be careful not to overcook the coulis, because the tomatos will become mushy. I think it looks much better, and the textture more pleasing, when the coulis cooked, but firm.

This was a simple dish to prepare that packed a ton of flavor. I did substitute about a tablespoon of honey for the sugar - it both mellowed the tomato and thickened the coulis a bit. I served this over linguini, there was plenty of sauce. The only downside: three days after cooking it my kitchen still smells of curry.

I simply cannot believe I am the first to write about this dish. I made this last summer for a groupof 10 at our summer Beach house and it was a huge hit. It is very, very easy and the interplay of the grilled scallops and the coulis was perfect - people walked away thinking I was a genius. We like to cook a lot - but I would rate myself as an intermediate in terms of skill - but this was one you can be proud of. Trust me - this dish is a winner and easy to prepare
