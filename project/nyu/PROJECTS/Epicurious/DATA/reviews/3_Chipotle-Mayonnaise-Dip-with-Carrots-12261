As mentioned in the other reviews, this is a fantastic base recipe that shines with personalization. I used lime flavored mayo, extra chipotle chile and sauce, and a few dashes of garlic salt. Keep your additions simple as to not hide the flavor of the chipotle. Will make again and is a great way to get my 2 yr old to eat her veggies!

I agree with the previous review in that it is a great dip, but you have to adjust this to taste. I doubled the chipotle and adobo and thought it was just right. My son thought it was too weak. I also added some lime zest based on earlier review.

Hard to understand why this wasn't more popular. The amount of chipotle and adobo sauce is a matter of taste. Other than that, this is delicious with baby carrots, and a great way to have a raw vegetable when youre not making a salad.

Can someone email me the receipe for adobo sauce? I can't find it in the markets here and in any case i like to make my own. Tks!

I think I see the problem with this one. I make something similar myself. Try adding some garlic, cilantro, green onions and lime zest. Then sit down because it will blow your socks off! Delicious.

I like spicy - but this had no complexity to it. It was too hot for most folks and there are many more recipes out there - which are far better.
