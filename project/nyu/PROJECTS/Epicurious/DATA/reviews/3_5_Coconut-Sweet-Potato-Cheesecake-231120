This was a hit! I grew up on the gulf coast and always prefer sweet potatoes to pumpkin. I followed the other reviewers advice. I doubled the crust recipe, omitted the ricotta (and substituted cream cheese) and left out the coconut flakes in the filling. I topped the cheesecake with whipped cream flavored with powdered sugar and coconut rum. I topped of each slice with whipped cream and then sprinkled toasted coconut, chopped crystalized ginger and grated lemon zest. I made this several days in advance which was nice.

For all the work involved, it really wasn't that good. Would not make it again - trash this recipe.

I took this to a thanksgiving pot luck - it was a hit. Much better than the standard pumpkin pie. Everyone loved it.

a few tips: 1) boil the potatoes beforehand to soften them up (45min-1hr) 2) cut back on creamcheese and add yogurt, and/or seltzer water, to lighten and fluffen up. otherwise, delicious and will gladly make again.

This cheesecake was sensational made with fresh frozen unsweetened coconut and double the crust. (I passed on the coconut garnish.) Not knowing what to expect, people were blown away by the lightness of it and the complex flavors. They commented too on the beautiful color. This is a very special occasion indulgence!

Flavor of this cheesecake filling was the best I have ever tasted!!! Didn't goof with making a crust in a springform pan, so I halved the recipe to use a pre-made Keebler 2 extra serving graham cracker crust. I had a bit too much filling. Next time I may try to use 1/2 of the recipe to fill two regular size Keebler crusts. DELICIOUS

I couldn't believe how good this was! Even though I wasn't sure too many people would like it because of hte coconut, it was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner and will be used again. Out of over 20 people, not one person didn't like it. Two cheesecakes didn't last very long!

Overall interesting cheesecake, but not as good as I had hoped. To solve the chunky potato problem, I mashed the potatoes in my old-fashioned potato ricer, and had no strings. I love coconut, but would omit shredded coconut if I make this again. The Coco Casa adds enough coconut flavor, and the shreds of coconut in the finished product make for a stringy "mouth- feel", which is diconcerting in what should be a smooth rich cheesecake. I would also omit the ricotta. I have never liked the consistancy that ricotta imparts to cheesecake and this recipe is no exception, as it makes it too "gritty". Not the nice firm and smooth consistency that I prefer in New York style cheesecakes.

this was a big hit for our Thanksgiving dinner. I loved how all the flavors blended together.

Followed others' advice to prep more graham crackers and skip the coconut in the filling. It was a big hit. I also advise using the bottom of a glass to help tamp down the crust into the pan. (You can use the side of the glass to even out the crust sides, too.) Also, beat the batter until it is very smooth, scraping down the bowl several times, and bake with a pan of water in the oven.

This was a really good holiday dessert. Lighter than other cheesecakes with an intriguing and exotic taste. I doubled the crust which made a thick crust which I like. For the sweet potato filling I used all of the sweet potato puree (did not bother to measure out 2 1/3cups). To make sure the puree is smooth, mix the cream and egg together and them process in cuisinart with the sweet potato puree. I had extra filling which I used to make another small cheesecake. This was really good because it was different and I like to serves recipes "with a twist" alongside the traditional stand- bys. Enjoy!

This definitely was a show-stopper, but it wasn't my cup of tea. It was a lot of work, too. Wouldn't mind a similar recipe that does not include the coconut. As much as my company loved it (and they were very impressed!) I don't think it's worth the effort.

As a fan of both sweet potato pie and cheesecake, I was bound to love this recipe. It's a lot of trouble, but I will definitely make it again. It's a real showstopper for a "southern style" holiday meal. However, I agree completely with the cooks who said the crumb crust amounts were insufficient. By all means, double, even triple it!

I've made this several times and it is always a hit. I think the combination of flavors are fantastic. However: The quantity of crust ingredients is way off. I have to multiply them by at least 1.5 to get enough to coat the sides and bottom of the pan. Also, just a general note for cheesecakes which is not in the recipe: you will get better results if you put a roasting pan filled 50% with water under the cake while it bakes. This keeps the oven moist and prevents the outside of the cake from drying out. Also remember that cheesecakes continue to cook even after you take them from the oven, so they shouldn't be completely set. Most bad cheesecakes are ruined by overcooking. Sort of like a steak in that regard.

Very good, although my Thanksgiving guests would have liked a bit more sweet potato flavor (there's plenty of coconut). My one big complaint, though, is that the accuracy of the quantities was about the worst I've experienced in a recipe. I came up 15 percent short on the sweet potato mixture, 25 percent short on the crumb crust (recipe doesn't even state how high to make the crust -- I assumed it was close to the top of the pan), and I had 25 percent more filling than needed. Finally, the cooking time was about 20 percent less than stated, and while one might say this is due to the vagaries of ovens, I would also say that rarely have I had such a time shortfall in baking in this particular oven. Long story short, it took me too long to make this cheesecake simply because I had to repeat my work in two instances in order to correct recipe errors. So, baker beware.

I have made this only once, and the results were well-received. There is certainly a diversity of flavors which may not be for some. Several comments: 1.) I found the time investment to be not much greater than most cheesecakes I have made 2.) I agree with the previous reviewer that the potatoes need to be thoroughly processed 3.) I was not overly enthused with the texture, and I believe this to be for two reasons: a. store bought ricotta rather than fresh b. the coconut, which I would instead place either atop the cheesecake or neglect entirely as the Coco Lopez delivers plenty of flavor. Enjoy.

Everyone at Thanksgiving loved this cheesecake. The flavors were great together, almost tropical, and it wasn't overly rich, as some cheesecakes are. It took some time to make, but well worth the effort. It looked great, too.

I thought the cake was alright. The recipe worked well and the flavors went well together, but I didn't think the overall result was outstanding. There were others who really liked it, but I would probably not make this one again.

I made this cheesecake for our Thanksgiving meal. It was absolutely delicious, I received lots of comments. Great blend of flavors and it made a beautiful presentation. I will definitely make it again at Christmas. Happy Holidays!

This cheesecake is AWESOME! The key is making sure the sweet potatoes are soft enough so there are no lumps. I had to cook it longer than the recipe stated. I placed them in the food processor & still had to pick out a few pieces that didn't mush. Raw sweet potatoes are very hard to cut into small pieces. Overall, I would make this again. Everyone loved it! Happy Cooking!

This was the best. The only downside for me was that I didn't have a food processor(my mom didn't have one!!!) so my cheesecake wasn't as smooth as it should have been but otherwise it was sooo good! I can't wait to make it again for Christmas!

Unusual combination of flavors, but worth it. I'm a sweet potato fan and always looking for new uses and this was a hit - even for those who disliked sweet potatoes.

I made this right before Thanksgiving as a treat for the office. Since then I have made 8 for all in the office. What a hit. Excellent combination of ingredients and easy to prepare.
