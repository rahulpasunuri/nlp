Loved this! Great combination of flavors. My husband said we should have it once a week!

I was glad to find a recipe that used maple syrup, but not soy sauce, which is a fine, but somewhat tired, combination. This was easy and came out well.

Found this recipe years ago and have made it many times since. Tried the sauce on chicken once, but it doesn't have the same impact. Something about the sweet and spicy with the salmon flavor really works well.

Very easy and quick. I didn't have pepper flakes, so I added chili oil for a bit of zip. This is a keeper.

This is our favorite salmon recipe BY FAR! We double the sauce and bake the salmon as per several recommendations. Add a little coconut to rice for a perfect accompanyment. Never a morsel left over.

My husband & I loved this sauce on the salmon--the sweet & spicy flavors worked surprisingly well together. We didn't have red pepper flakes, but substituted cayenne pepper and that worked well. Also a plus was that it was very quick to prepare.

I made this salmon for a weeknight dinner, and was surprised to see that it was quick and delicious. My husband even loved it, and he doesn't usually like fish!!

I love the combination of sweet and spicy. I pan grilled the fish rather than broiling it and it came out great. I also used Grade A syrup since Grade B is not sold in my area.

A++ would broil again. I served with edamame and rice with shiitake and garlic.

This is one of our favourite recipes. But I like to do the salmon in the pan instead of under the broiler because then all that lovely sauce gets cooked down even more and starts to 'caramelize' by the time the fish is done. Fantastic! Note that you MUST use grade B syrup: grade A just doesn't have a strong enough maple flavour.

Rating: 4
Excellent. This is easy and wonderfully tasty. It's sweet, savory and spicy, in series. The carmelized topping makes for a delicious crunch.

This was a big hit for dinner tonight. I used powdered ginger and Grade A Syrup...no need for extract!! Fast and easy. A keeper!

This is a fantastic recipe! It's very, very easy to prepare, and it tastes like it's a lot more work than it really is. I tried making this with salmon steaks instead of filets, and being a garlic devotee, I substituted a tablespoon of Chinese chili garlic sauce for the red pepper flakes. I can imagine using this recipe as a guidline for all sorts of interesting variations.

Amazing!!! So easy and appears like it took more time to make. I am making it for the second time for guests and will make more of the sauce this time. I didn't use the extract either, it doesn't need it.

Very easy. The diners ate it all up. If you like it spicy, you'll need a lot more pepperflakes than stated in this recipe

I made this tonight and it was very quick and much too easy considering how well it came out. An interesting way to do salmon, but even the picky eater of the group enjoyed it.

Rating: 3
Very quick, easy and delicious. Used regular (Grade A) maple syrup w/o adding maple extract and it was fine. Also, added soy sauce to the basting sauce to add depth. And, added more galic. Baked at 400 for 20 minutes with some of the basting sauce. This thickens up the sauce and you can serve the fish w/ the sauce.

Rating: 4
WOW! This is the best salmon I have ever had! So easy and impressive. The aroma from cooking the basting sauce is phenomenal. The only thing I left out was the 3 drops of extract - I had Grade A syrup. I can't see that it would have been any better with it, however. I served it with some steamed baby spinach and drizzled some basting sauce over it and the salmon before serving. The more the better! The only downside to this recipe is cleaning the broiler pan afterwards. I'd make this every week if salmon didn't just show up on the food police's radar. Bummer.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Nice combination of flavors--good enough for company! (I used half the pepper flakes, just the right amount of spice for us.) Next time I will triple the sauce and keep some in the freezer for a quick and delicious meal.

This is an easy dish that tastes like it must have taken a long time to make! Just wonderful! I've already shared it with a friend!

Yum. Another great salmon recipe, and really easy. I used cayenne instead of the flakes (and put in a little extra), and just normal maple syrup, and it was heavenly. I thought the sauce might be a little too spicy, but once it went onto the salmon, it worked perfectly.

Rating: 3
I used more syrup than the recipe called for to get a stronger flavor. In a word, WOW. Made this for my husband and his mum. I think they'll keep me in the family. :-) I think next time I'll cook it less under the broiler and at a lower temp so the sugar doesn't burn. At least this time it only burned in the pan and not the fish.

I have made this for company several times. It is a sure fire hit for entertaining -- unless your company hates any kind of fish. I love the sweet and spiciness. Even my picky kids like this.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times, and it gets better every time. I usually serve it with asparagus and cous cous, and the maple sauce spices up the latter nicely. I even think my sister-in-law Anna would enjoy this dish.

I get regular requests from friends for this dish. The sweet & spicy combination is delicious. I add a dish of soy sauce (not too much or it will taste like teriyaki sauce) and some grated orange zest to the sauce.

This recipe was a hit at my house, where we love spicy food. The sauce is thick and hearty and provide a really nice compliment to the fish. For those who have found the sauce a bit bland, I would say to check the freshness of your chili flakes. Old, stale chili flakes will lose their potency and leave a spicy recipe tasting dull. On the other hand, for those who don't like spicy food, it's quite easy to reduce the chili flakes to just a smidgen and still be left with a wonderful maple sauce.

Who can complain about this recipe? (I guess quite a few have). It's a quick, easy recipe. Not much mess or effort. It gives salmon a nice, sweet & spicy taste. I used whatever syrup I had in the house. Great results. Perfect weekday recipe.

This recipe has become a family favorite. I get regular requests to make it when company comes over.

After reading reviews that implied the fish needed either more or less intense flavor, I decided to omit the pepper flakes and add 1/3 cup of water thickened with a little cornstarch instead of 1/2 cup. I also substituted rainbow trout for the salmon. It was a nice change.

I liked this dish, however, I have had better. I followed the recipe exactly, but I felt I just about ruined a good piece of fish with all these spices. I would eat it again though, maybe.

This was good, but I wish the sauce was a little thicker & flavors were more intense.

This is definitely a keeper. However it's summer so I like to start the salmon on the grill skin side down and then finish it under the broiler ,making time adjustments as needed

Rating: 4
Followed recipe almost exactly (added a little corn starch to thicken marinade). Basted fillets while broiling.Carmalized crust had bits of toasted ginger and garlic. Friends say best fish they ever had. I'll definately fix this again, perhaps adding a bit more red pepper and ginger.

Wow! Was I a hit at my dinner party? You know it! Everyone raved about the flavors of this dish. I seared the salmon instead of broiling it. I can't wait to make it again.

I noticed that many of the reviewers could not find Grade B Maple Syrup. It is available through mail order from The Baker's Catalogue, www.KingArthurFlour.com. The cost is $10.95 for 1 pint. I only had about 1/2 of the recommended amount of maple syrup in my cupboard, but this recipe was still terrific. I can imagine that it will be fabulous with the correct amount of maple syrup. I am saving this one in my recipe box.

this was a hit with everyone. It was a delightful blend of sweet and spicy. I think I would bake fish next time instead of broiling it. I also couldn't find grade B syrup, but used grade A without extract addition and it was still delicious.

Lovely results when I tried this...the maple syrup lent a nice "Canadian" touch to the Asian flavors. I, too, added a bit of extra ginger and garlic to the sauce and served the salmon alongside fresh, cooked green beans and white rice steamed with chopped ginger, garlic, and cilantro, salt, and a bit of crushed red pepper. Had doubled the sauce and offered that "on the side" to pour over the salmon and/or rice. My husband, not a fish fan, loved it, as did our Chinese friend who'd joined us for dinner.

Great beach recipe! Very easy and different.

Grade A is light, thus the recommendation for grade B. I found 4 inches from broiler is too close. Suggest middle shelf to avoid burning. Great dish, would do again.

I grilled the salmon and brushed on the sauce as each side was finished. Served the sauce with the fish to rave reviews. Even my daughter, who claims all fish to be too "fishy", loved it--she said the spicyness took away from the fishy.

I ruined a fine piece of alaskan king salmon with this cloyingly sweet concoction. Perhaps the treatment could be justified if one were using a flavorless piece of farmed fish.

I found that the sweet ginger garlic sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavour of the salmon. Where great combinations enhance, these flavours and textures do not come close to succeeding. Why not just use dill butter and enjoy the fish for what it is.

I followed the recipe exactly but I was disappointed. I was expecting to really taste the sauce, but barely tasted a thing, just a slightly watery maple flavour. I will try this recipe based on previous recipes and hope that it goes better next time.

I wouldn't change a thing! PERFECT as it is written. I got a perfect piece of fresh Alaska salmon today, and I just happened upon this recipe. I can't wait to make it again. Turn up the broiler at the end and get a little touch of char on it! You won't be sorry!
