This recipe was just what I was looking for. After reading some of the reviews I made the following adjustments and my family loved this dish: used 1 10 oz. pkg frozen chopped spinach, increased nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, increased pesto to 4 tbl, sauteed shallot in 3 tbl olive oil, added 1/2 cup Harvarti cheese and 1/4 cup Asiago cheese to the extra sharp cheddar cheese. I was a little hesitant to just pile the cheese on top of the casserole, but it turned out to be scrumptious. The next time I make this I won't change it all. It was moist and flavorful.

The idea behind this recipe is good; the recipe itself needed tweaking. I substituted penne (a 13 oz box) for egg noodles, used frozen spinach, added salt and pepper, as well as a half cup more of whole sour cream. Instead of using real pesto, I used the 1 and a half of those dry pesto packets (I recommend these for casserole dishes, but nothing else), a tablespoon of olive oil, and about a tablespoon of granulated parmesan cheese. As a topping, instead of cheddar (yuck) I used a mixture of white cheeses (provolone, swiss, and grated parmesan). I was very satisfied with the result. If you don't want to add extra sour cream, other options include adding cream cheese or cottage cheese to the mixture. They "dryness" people note come from a lack of creaminess, and the "blandness" from the lack of pesto.

Huge disappointment, even though I used 1 cup of pesto, 1 lb. of spinach, more sour cream and doubled the nutmeg. Still dry and bland. I wouldn' even bother futzing with it to improve it. I give it "no forks," although that's not an option.

I made this twice, the second time with more pesto, plus sauteed mushrooms, garlic and shallots, as another reviewer suggested. It's just so-so. Quite bland, really.

This dish was delicious. I played with the recipe and used all the advise and more. Used light creme fraiche instead of sour cream, doubled that to two cups, used 4 tbsp pesto, added sauteed mushrooms w/2 cloves garlic and 3 shallots (this was great addition), and I added fresh chopped basil to the mix as well as salt + pepper. Then I topped with croutons (crumbled italian bruschetta was what was around). I added sharp cheddar (less than amount recommended) during the last 15 mins. It was so good. The mushrooms added a pleasing earthiness that balanced out the dish. Will make again just like this.

Didn't make or rate, but thought I would chime in for the cook from Maine. Stouffer's makes a frozen spinach souffle side dish...

Rating: 1
I thought this was just okay. Perhaps it was dull because I used frozen chopped spinach instead of "spinach souffle." I've never even heard of spinach souffle, but I'm guessing it's the same thing as creamed spinach. I'll try using that next time, give this recipe one more chance and hope for the best!

I made this again last night for company. Still too dry. Next time I will increase sour cream and pesto plus add the cheese topping the last 15 minutes.

Family loved this. I took the advice of others and doubled the pesto and nutmeg and threw in some mushroom I'd sauteed -- rave reviews. Easy and healthy and something I'll be making regularly since it can easily be prepared ahead and reheated.

This is a quick and easy (and tasty) weeknight meal. I followed the adivce of earlier reviewers and added Gruyere and extra pesto.

Followed the advice of the cook from NV. Extra pesto, chicken and the cheese substitution made this dish great. I have made it twice now and my family is fighting for the leftovers if there are any.

I wanted to love this as it seemed like such easy comfort food for the family but it did not do it for us at all. Way too bland and a little dry. Not even promising enough to experiment with a second time.

BAM!This was a homerun at our house! I used 2 lbs of fresh spinach, blanched them in a callender with the hot water from the noodles. Added an extra tablespoon of pesto. Cut up two breasts of rotiserie chicken, did the gruyere cheese. We were fighting over the leftovers.This is now a regular.

Bland, but has potential. I tried the recipe as written except that I subbed light (not fat free) sour cream and cut down on the cheese and added fresh chopped spinach that I sauteed with garlic and butter before adding to the mix. Next time I will follow the advice of others on increasing pesto, adding garlic, possibly using a stronger cheese. I also like the idea of bread crumbs on top. Mine also came out dry - not at all greasy. Full amount of cheese might have remedied dryness, but I also think it's important not to overbake.

Rating: 2
A nice, easy dish that everyone seems to like. I agree that the recipe could benefit from some tweaking, but I've made it twice this week, following the recipe exactly. I agree with the idea of the blended cottage cheese, or perhaps ricotta, but I think chopped spinach instead of the souffle would be missing something.

A very good and hearty winter dish! I used frozen spinach instead of soufle, sauteed mushrooms and 3 TBSP of pesto. I would definately make this again!

okey, made it last night. yes, it is quick + easy, but it needs some major work. i doubled the pesto + nutmeg as advised, but it was still pretty bland. the doubled nutmeg was overpowering. my boyfriend says 'it has potential...' + i agree! i will make it again, but with some changes: blended cottage cheese instead of sour cream to make it 'cheesier', extra garlic, and some black pepper! also i think bread crumbs or some other such 'topping' would be a welcome addition.

Rave reviews from my fiance. However, I did change the recipe a bit...frozen chopped spinach, sauteed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, and doubled the pesto and nutmeg, also used lowfat sour cream. Absolutely a keeper..will make often.

This recipe was good, but mine came out too dry. Not sure what happened. I used lowfat sour cream and plain spinach, so it did not seem too "fatty". While eating it, i felt some mushrooms would add a great taste to the dish. I would make this again, but maybe with something to make it less dry.

I thought this was pretty good, and can definitely make lots of interesting modifications. I used swiss instead of cheddar, and regular frozen spinach instead of souffle. Added 2 cloves crushed garlic, and followed earlier suggestions to double the pesto. Also added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese to the spinach, and 2 tablespoons of milk. I'll make it again.

This recipe is good, but with substitutions, its great. I used lowfat sour cream, lowfat contadina pesto (4tbsp) and, when I'm looking to do something with meat, I saute chicken breast in a nonstick pan with some shallot and garlic and toss it all together. The cheese of choice - definetely gruyere. Everyone I've served it to has asked for the recipe.

Rating: 2
Ok, so this is definitely not a dish I would serve to company, but as a quick and effortless weeknight meal I'll admit it was very satisfying in that high-fat casserole way. Definitely add the extra 2 T of pesto as suggested by others - I used the frozen spinach souffle and sour cream (yikes!) and buttered breadcrumbs on top.

A friend served this at a dinner party and it was so delicious I asked for the recipe. We make the suggested substitutions-- regular frozen chopped spinach instead of souffle, plain yogurt, gruyere cheese, and extra (4 T) pesto-- and it's fantastic. I make it all the time now. It is also nice with shallots.

Rating: 2
Easy enough and perfect for a busy weeknight and meatless alternative. I used Classico's new pesto sauce, in the small jar, and it was the best bottled pesto i've tasted. I also did a lot of alterations. I used 4T pesto, 1 cup low fat plain yogurt, 16oz frozen chopped spinach, medium flat egg noodles. My husband and I both thought it was good.

Rating: 2
I made this as written with the substitution of bow-tie noodles in the place of the egg noodles (none on hand) and the addition of some lightly sautéed shallots. Not "delicious", hardly "gourmet," but tasty enough, easy, and, as I had all the ingredients on hand, perfect for a lazy Tuesday night. I thought the shallots really added a needed layer. The cheese was a bit too much for me (too much dairy and it was a little greasy) so I might use a layer of bread crumbs next time. I will make it the next time I am feeling lazy.

Rating: 1
Definitely a dull recipe by my standards. I can only see finding it scrumptious by making massive alterations/additions. Start by adding an egg or two for more body. I would suggest adding more vegetables, too, such as sauteed onions and mushrooms. Better yet, go the hippie-food route and take a look at some of Mollie Katzen's recipes in the various Moosewood cookbooks. She's got some great casserole recipes.

BORING!!!!

I followed the recipe, which was probably my problem. With the combo of pesto and sour cream, I found it too fatty and oily tasting. Next time, I'll add more pesto (4 T sounds good), and use yogurt in place of the sour cream. I couldn't find spinach souffle, so I used frozen creamed spinach -- might be what added to the fattiness of the dish. I'd use chopped spinach next time. I'd also add a good bit of salt & pepper because I did find it a little bland.

We had this for dinner tonight. My husband and I absolutely loved it. It is very filling, and the perfect dish when you want to go meatless. I did use lowfat sour cream (probably will use plain yogurt next time to see how that works), and it came out just fine. It was SO easy! I had everything put together by the time my oven pre-heated. I'll definitely keep this one around for busy work nights!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I would definitely use chopped spinach instead of fresh in this recipe when I make it again. It is terrific the next day as well.

I used fat free sour cream and made my own version of pesto (lots of basil, garlic, pine nuts, but easy on the olive oil). I was unable to find spinach soufle so I used chopped, frozen. Delicious and nothing bland about it.

This recipe is the definition of comfort food and it multiplies easily. I tripled the recipe and froze it, unbaked, for future meals. This dish freezes and then bakes beautifully. I added one box of chopped frozen spinach for every box of frozen spinach souffle, and I took the Gruyere advice. I also used tons of homemade, garlic-laden pesto, which is really where this dish gets its flavor.

Gruyere Cheese is a definite. I also added a cup of fresh broccoli, which was very yummy. Great reheated!

Good recipe, but I was overwhelmed by the fat content when I made it. Next time I'll try fat free sour cream. It was nice to have a meatless dish and filled us up. We had a focaccia bread on the side with some olive oil and pepper.

What a great recipe, a nice change when you don't want meat. I added 1 teaspoon of garlic to the mix and topped with grated cheese. Next time I will try Gruyere Cheese for extra flavour. A great stand by meal.

I dont particularly care for this dish but my 13year old daughter insists I make it once a week. This is a staple for her and she loves it. I always have it in the fridge and she eats it after school and even for breakfast in the morning....hey, I'll do anythingn to get a picky eater to EAT!!!!

I have been making this casserole since '93. It always is well received and is so quick and easy to prepare. I,too, use store bought pesto and use 4 T. I always use gruyere cheese and increase nutmeg to 1 t. It's a reliable side dish. I make it the night before, cover and chill.

This was quick and easy! I used 2 tablespoons of a concentrated presto, which was just right. I like the idea of a Gruyere or perhaps a mild Provolone. Chicken also sound like a nice addition.

Added the chicken, doubled the pesto, used the little egg noodle twits, and use gruyere cheese. It was WONDERFUL! I have also made this for 125 people and lots asked for the recipe. It is very quick to make. It's a keeper!

I love pesto, so I doubled the amount and it tasted great. It's a snap to make and perfect if you're short on time. I will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe several times - even my four year old loves it. I've made it with more pesto than called for and left out the sour cream when I've been out of it too and it is still good. It's a great side dish with plain chicken and I've made it as a meatless main dish with just garlic bread and salad. I've also made it as a main dish casserole adding shredded chicken to it. It's a great, versatile recipe. I love it!
