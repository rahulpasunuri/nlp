Good, but a little too bland. I added more lime juice and more tequila! I just froze it in 4 plastic cups and served it as a slushie.

I thought these were good and very refreshing, but perhaps a little too boozy. Not that that's a bad thing, but I felt like the tequila flavor was too front and center. I'd make these again but perhaps just skip the tequila all together. If you like that flavor you'll probably like these. Or, I could see making traditional margarita ice pops with just lime as the flavor. That would be delicious. I just didn't think these flavors went together, but in parts would be yummy.
