I made this tonight for several guests. I did not care for it and it was obvious no one else did either! Perhaps the endive I used were too large? It was somewhat bitter - the only thing I enjoyed was the cheese with the nuts! Would not make again.

I have made this dish about a half-dozen times and am always very impressed. Given the incredibly quick and simple preparation, it offers an elegance and unique combination of flavors that is really quite amazing. I find that toasted walnuts or pine nuts are an improvement - hazelnuts have a bit of a love 'em or hate 'em quality. I also like to ring the plate with wedges of very ripe pear - endive and pear is a classic combination and it adds a great contrasting note to this dish. I have never bothered with chives as I rarely can use an entire bunch and hate throwing out herbs. I have substituted cooking sherry when no white wine was on hand with nice results. If you are a bit stumped by Belgian endive and want to see what it can do - this is a great and easy recipe.

Excellent. I would add that the endive should be served on a separate plate from other food as the liquid sauce flows across the plate. We had burgers and I did not want the buns to soak in the liquid. Also, I would add that the hazelnuts should be chopped or shredded, and not whole. Otherwise, easy to make and excellent.

I made this tonight (halved, for 2) and we both agreed it was delicious. I am an endive addict and am always looking for other things to do with it (braised, gratin, salad, soup...). This recipe is fast, simple, delicious, and healthy... doesn't even need to be tweaked. Mr van Wye, I hope your books are as well written as your recipes! :)

On Valentine's Day 2007, my husband (who mind you is a boil-in-the-bag master) made dinner for me and this fabulous and elegant salad was the starter! He had to google what endive is as he had no idea what it looked like!! I was blown away by the presentation and the flavors were exquisite!

Very impressive...doesn't look fabulous, but tastes great and was compared to restaurant quality. I would increase the amount per person if you intend it to be a substantial salad for a meal.

More of a side dish than a salad in my mind but different and delicious nevertheless. The only change I made was to cut down on the amount of cheese.

Loved it so much that I made it three times in a week. Really got us started on braised endives. We couldn't get enough. Didn't use hazelnuts but it was exquisite anyhow.
