I used frozen lima beans and corn and it turned out delicious. Such an easy side dish that brings lots of color and flavor to the meal.

We made this dish up while on vacation in Cape Cod with some grilled salmon. Perfect beach meal veggie. It was exceptional -- used fresh local corn, frozen limas, good bacon. Next time I will try 1/2 & 1/2, the cream is overkill. I will likely leave out the water. We did not separate the green onion parts. I might use a tad more bacon...who doesn't love bacon?

I love this. I don't take the bacon out of the pan, I just throw in the veggies after the bacon is crisp and mix them together, with a little butter if I'm using turkey bacon. Red onion instead of scallions is also good. I also don't put in the water and use half and half. It's really tasty even with a can of corn and frozen lima beans.

Yum! Used fresh corn and lima beans and chicken broth instead of water. I let it simmer longer then indicated, it was delicious.

This was oh so delicious, and even better the next day (in the future I may make this the day before and reheat to serve). Used half and half instead of cream, and it was perfect -- might be too rich for our tastes w/ cream.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used frozen corn. This was tasty but the cream seemed like overkill. Bacon was a nice addition, though. Next time I'd try it with just water (instead of cream) or a small amount of half and half. Frankly, I'd rather save my calories for dessert.

An excellent succotash rendition. For a great variation on the classic, use edamame instead of lima beans

Delicious AND easy! I live in South Jersey so fresh limas and corn were in abundance. Used 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream.

This was so, so good! I left out the bell peppers and added peas. My only complaint is that it's really not the healthiest side of veggies...

This dish was absolutely incredible. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I have been asked to make it for Christmas. I didn't use the green pepper and only used frozen lima beans and corn. Also, I didn't bother separating the white and green parts of the scallions.
