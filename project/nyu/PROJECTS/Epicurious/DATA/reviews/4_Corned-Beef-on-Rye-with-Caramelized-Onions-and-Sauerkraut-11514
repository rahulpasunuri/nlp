Awesome recipe. Brinded my brisket for 8 days & this was a great way to enjoy it with friends. Only change was I minced to garlic cloves then added melted unsalted butter.

I used corned beef from the deli. My wife, Godzilla, has never liked corned beef, but she loved these sandwiches. Even asked me to make them again.

Delicious! I used my left over brisket from ST Patty's day. I only made one alteration, because I hate sauerkraut I just caramelized some cabbage and added to the onion apple mixture. Served with dijon mustard, ssoooooo good! I will make this again when ever I have left over corned beef.

I have been making this dish on a regular basis for years now, but always with my own adjustments. I add 3/4 cup of apple cider and about 3 tbsps. of pickling spice to the corned beef (some pre-packaged cuts come with their own spice some don't). I slice off most of the fat before cooking and scrape off whats left afterwards. I add a full cup of sauerkraut to the onions and substitute half of the water for white vinegar. I also skip the butter (only because the bread that we got was a little dense and wouldn't toast buttered) and just rubbed the garlic on one side of the bread after toasting it. One of my boyfriends favorite dishes!

This is one of our families favorite sandwiches, and we make it for informal saturday lunches with friends.

This recipe, in no way, tells me how to prepare the basic corned beef/

Now this is a sandwich! I served corned beef with cabbage, potatoes, onion, and carrots one night. Two days later made this sandwich with the leftover beef. Forget the first meal, I'm going straight for the sandwich next time!

My family loved the sauerkraut fixed this way. This was the first time they all put sauerkraut on their corned beef and the first time my kids liked it. The sweetness of the apple made the difference. I'm usually a strictly without any sweetness on the rueben, not even thousand island dressing. Strong mustard or horseradish is yummy and the pickle is good on the side.

I thought that the onion, sauerkraut and apple mixture was a bit sweet and rather bland and didn't stand up well to the corned beef. It's a matter of personal taste, but I prefer a classic reuben with sauerkraut alone.

This was really delicious, and I am a die-hard classic reuben fan. I put 1000 Island on the side and dipped the sandwich in. Refrigerate leftover beef and kraut mixture and it makes another great sandwich (cold) on bread or toast, with mustard, 1000 Island, whichever flavor you prefer.

Yum! I made the sandwiches with a really good deli corned beef, which worked just fine. I also left out the apple, just used equal amounts of caramelized onions and sauerkraut. This one's a real keeper.

Wonderful! I did not make any changes to the recipe, except to use spicy mustard. My husband and I both branded this one a keeper.

The onion sauerkraut apple mixture is excellent on rueben sandwiches.

The onion/sauerkraut/apple mixture is heavenly - yummy as hell! It should have it's own, separate recipe listing. Due to time constraints, I made it the day before, and the flavors had time to meld. My hubby doesn't like onions, but loved this. I will be making sandwiches with the leftovers and roast chicken on French rolls.

I thought this was a great Friday night sandwich at the end of a hectic week. I used a whole apple, one medium onion (didn't measure it so it probably wasn't 3 cups!) and an entire jar of the fresh (?) sauerkraut from the deli section (rinsed and drained). Also used a spicier mustard. Very yummy!

This was a good sandwich. The corned beef was very tender and flavorful. I especially loved the carmilized vidalia onions

I have been making this sandwich since 1994, when it first appeared in the magazine. It always draws rave reviews from my wife and guests. It may be the best sandwich I have ever tasted. Don't wait for St. P day-- make it all year!!

Absolutely wonderful! Tasted as good as it sounded and looked.

Well balanced flavors with a "delicate boldness" that was very satisfying for us, we will definitely be making this again! It's so much better than anything you could get at a bar or restaurant.

Great melding of flavors. It was meal in a sandwich. I used rye bread made in a bread machine and added a "twist" to the initial corned beef preparation: after boiling the corned beef, remove and place in roast pan; sprinkle brown sugar and paprika over top and put in oven at 300 degrees for another 20 minutes. (This from my great grandmother's vorned beef recipe) Absolutely scrumptious.

It looked good on paper, but the flavors weren't as pronounced as I had imagined. Worth giving it a try if you haven't.
