I was looking for a smooth black bean soup recipe and this one was perfect. I used canned beans, just let them drain in a colander while I prepped.

Hate to be the dissenter here, and have to admit I used canned beans, but it was way overly liquidy, even though I cut the broth to six cups! The flavors were just okay. I was really disappointed, because it took a long time to make with mediocre results.

We've been making this soup for many years. It's tasty and healthy, full of veggies and protein! Use an immulsion blender instead of tranferring it to a blender - much easier, faster, safer and cleaner.

Very tasty and easy to make (just time consuming). I particularly enjoyed the lime cilantro sour cream. I would definitely make this again.

This soup was absolutely fantastic. I would make this again in a heart beat. The only changes i made were extra jalapenos and garlic for a spicier soup, only used six cups of broth and extra black beans for a little thicker puree. A perfect compliment to quesadillas on a crisp winter day!

This is a staple at our annual pumpkin carving party - I don't puree, because the black beans and carrots provide the requisite black and orange. Also makes it easy. This soup is awesome.

This is our favorite black bean soup and we have tried many. Most people who try this, ask for the recipe. It is a rich full bodied soup. I do add extra veggies, garlic,and less liquid. Try it. You will love it!

Good recipe but a lot of ingredients. I used the fast soak method for the beans and it was just fine.

I've made this soup many times - it is absolutely delicious. It is rather time-consuming, so if I am making it for weeknight guests I'll make it the day before and reheat it. One recommendation I would give is that you must soak the beans overnight. One time I did the "quick-soak" method listed on the package of beans and some of the black color leached out into the soaking water. The final color of the soup was rather gray.

I made these with canned beans and it was amazing. I quickly turned around and made a double batch and froze it - it froze very well. All the veggies are beautiful cooking together and really give you an idea of how healthy it is I am not a black bean soup fan and loved this recipe. My husband would take the frozen ones to work and would not even wait to heat it up he would drink the thawed soup right from the freezer jar.

We really enjoyed this soup. Good thing that we had enough for leftovers as we mixed it with shredded chicken and fresh cilantro as a topping for tostados.

Good recipe but here's how I made it better ! I chopped and browned 2 chorizo instead of bacon. Roasted a green and hungarian pepper. Reseverd 1/3 of the beans then blitzed it up a bit whith the stick blender the added the rest of the beans. Also added a bit of Ancho chile powder. SOO GOOD !!!

Great soup! I did not finely chop the veggies to maintain the vitamin content, and because I like chunky soup. There, you have it. I like chunky soup. Very easy to make. I used soy bacon...soy bacon! This recipe would be good if you make your own veggie broth--sometimes soups are better with the store bought veggie broth, but this soup is forgiving enough.

I don't even like black bean soup and I loved this soup. My hubby loved it as well. It is a wonderful mix of smokey, spicy, and tangy. Super yum!!!

I made this soup for my sisters a year ago and they keep asking me to make it again. I have made it numerous times and am making some as Christmas gifts this year. (We all have enough "stuff" and prefer consumables in our family.)

This recipe rocks! Spicy, savory, and full of texture. I will definitely make it again, but this time I'm going to cut the bacon into small chunks before I cook it, and I'll add more vegetables. It's also important to use a low- salt chicken broth, or to thin a salty chicken stock with water, or it's a bit on the salty side. (not too salty, but high sodium for anyone trying to reduce their intake) For the Cilantro-Lime Sour Cream (which is a worthwhile recipe all by itself) I recommend using a food processor or making sure the cilantro is FINELY diced. I also substituted a low fat sour cream. Delicious as an offset to the savory flavors of the soup!

Great recipe. I added a little cooking sherry, used canned beans, and about 6 cups of stock. It was wonderful!

Rating: 3
This is really good. I reserved the bean soaking liquid (I did a fast soak) and used that for about half of the liquid, along with most of a quart of homemade chicken stock eked out with a little canned and reduced the liquid to 8 cups. The store was also out of cilantro. Otherwise, I followed the recipe fairly closely, and it came out brilliantly. It's got a nice low heat to it and it's really good with the lime sour cream.

This is wonderful, such a great depth of flavor. I used canned beans and served it with the cheese soup from the Black and White soup recipe from this site (a must try) instead of the sour cream. This has been in my recipe box for a long time, I'm just sorry I didn't make it sooner.

The soup was delicious. I only made two changes: I added a minced canned chipotle pepper in adobo with a little sauce, and I added the tomatoes after the beaned were almost thoroughly cooked - otherwise the acid can make them hard.

Perfect soup recipe. I diced the bacon before cooking and used 8 cups of broth instead of 10. Instead of sour cream I used greek yogurt and it was delicious. This is my new favorite soup recipe!

A very good soup. I suggest adding more chopped tomato and more chopped cilantro. Other than that, I followed the recipe and was very happy with the results.

This recipe is amazing! I used a vegetable stock (from this site) and soaked the beans overnight, cooked them on Saturday, and reheated and served on Sunday. I used fresh jalapenos for a kick and cooked the beans, probably 6 hours total. It did take them a while to soften, but it happened. Don't omit the cilantro lime sout cream. It makes the dish.

This is a great recipe. I x4 the recipe to serve my baking/pastry class. I vegan-ized (sour cream on the side) and no-salted (salt on the side) the recipe to accomidate everyone in the 50+ group. Only about 5 servings were left by the end. To vegan-ize: omitted the bacon and chicken broth - used filtered water; sauted the beginning veggies with a bit of canola oil; in the last 10 minutes of cooking - added about 1 smoked adobo pepper per pound of beans. Used an immersan (sp?) blender to do the blending for that big of a VAT of soup. Everyone loved it. Paired with corn muffins (from Epicurious 231072).

I don't know what happened, but this was just awful. I am a very experienced cook, and I have made many black bean soups. Canned chicken broth doesn't exist here, so I made the broth from a high quality powdered broth mix. Other than that, I made the soup exactly as directed. The soup never smelled good from the start and the beans never softened, even after 3 hours (perhaps too much salt in the broth?). Very disappointing, especially after all that chopping.

I just finished making my second pot in less than a week. My son and I love it! I did cut the liquid to 6 cups, added 2 bay leaves, an extra 1/2 Tbs. vinegar and a few good sprinkles of crushed red pepper in lieu of jalapeno. Pureed about 1/2 to thicken, and left the rest of the beans whole. Add the garnish, and there's just one word... wonderful!!

A wonderful soup that depends on the cilantro, lime, and sour cream garnishes for its superb taste. The flavors together create quite a harmony. Will definitely keep this one handy for chilly autumn days.

Really liked this soup. It reheats well, but the cilantro lime sour cream does not.

Rating: 2
it was good, not great. serves eight, but is definitely not company worthy, so leaves you with a lot of leftovers. i made it because i had umpteen cans of black beans in my pantry. was pretty good over coconut rice and thank goodness for the cilantro lime sour cream. (i used light sour cream & turkey bacon w/o harming the flavor of the soup).

This the only Black Bean soup to make. Always delicious! Sometimes I make it vegan and it's just as good, and in a pinch I have used canned beans with good results. Freezes well too.

Rating: 3
Yum! The recipe definitely calls for too much stock; we used 6 cups and ended up letting it boil uncovered for a bit to thicken up more. We used three cans of black beans and let it simmer for an hour. The sour cream was delightful. Will definitely make this again.

Half of the broth is plenty to start (as they say, it's easier to thin something down if needed than to try to thicken it). I used a ham hock instead of bacon to get smoky flavor with less fat, and added a teaspoon of chipotle chili powder for added spice. It seemed better to me with just a splash more red wine vinegar, too. To make it even spicier, a few red pepper flakes sprinkled on with the other garnishes works and is colorful. For texture and thickness, I didn't blend the soup completely, but used a hand blender in the cooking pot to get the consistency I wanted (much easier and safer than hauling out the blender for hot soup).

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I omitted the bacon, but regained a bit of the smoky flavor people are raving about here with a diced chipotle chile. Might try lime juice instead of vinegar in the soup next time.

Rating: 3
Great soup. Skipped the bacon with gain to health and no loss to flavor. However, cilantro-line sour cream a must. Agree with other reviewers that there is too much stock. Next time will use less. Oh, I added 2 bay leaves to pot - a "must" when cooking beans.

This soup was delicious. I put in 5 cups of stock and did not put it in the blender. It is prettier as is.

I loved the soup and got rave reviews from guests. I used two cans black beans (in a hurry) and reduced broth like suggested. Next time I will use three cans beans since I thought it could have been a little thicker. Otherwise a winner.

Definately reduce liquid to 6-7 cups. Vegetables add a lot to the overall flavor as does the lime sour cream topping. Crumble white corn tortilla chips and use like you would crackers in other soups.

This soup was really good, but I have made (including recipes on this website) easier versions of Black Bean Soup. A couple of ingredients found in this one I will include in easier versions: bacon for smokiness (delicious addition), Cilantro-Lime Sour Cream. Other than that, there are easier recipes. This one just seemed very time consuming.

Yummy, yummy soup. I've been searching for a black bean soup recipe that tastes smoky, not tomatoe-y. This one is it. I had to omit the leeks, jalapeno and parsley (didn't have on hand) and it was still delicious. The bacon adds just the right amount of smokiness. Give it a try!

My husband and I loved this soup. Instead of the bacon, I used the leftover ham bone from our Easter ham. I also cut down the amount of broth to 7 cups and added a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes rather than the fresh. This is a hearty and tasty soup. The recipe has gone into my "tried and true" collection.

Rating: 3
Good flavor, but a lot of prep time to make this. I agree on cutting down on the broth. It is just not thick enough otherwise and black bean soup should be heavy. Do not skip the garnish as it brings out the flavors.

Great recipe! My husband likes his black bean soup with whole beans so I didn't puree his 1/2. I like mine smooth so I REALLY pureed my 1/2. I skipped the sour cream recipe, just used a dollop of regular sour cream with a squeeze of fresh lime. I used leftovers for a sauce over burritos! YUM. My housekeeper LOVED it and she's from Guatemala, the land of black beans.

This is a classic black bean soup recipe, and the lime sour cream was a perfect topping! My 9 year old daughter picked this recipe because of the review that said her 8 year old ate it. My daughter concurs! I agree with reducing the broth. I found 8 cups worked well. This one will be made again and again.

I made the soup vegan skipping the bacon and substituting vegetable broth for the chicken. the soup was delicious. Even my eight year old had two helpings! Next time i'll make a double batch so we'll have leftovers for lunch.

Great soup! I loved all the vegetables. It gave it a nice flavor. I halfed the recipe for just me and my husband. It was plenty. I used 1/2 cup of the vegetables and cooked the beans first. I only used 4 cups of chicken broth so it would'nt be too soupy. I did'nt like the lime sour cream and tomatoes. I thought it was too tangy. It covered up the rich flavors. I think it would be better enhanced with just cilantro and chopped onions. Also, the "thick" soup was great as a dip with corn tortilla chips.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and very tasty. I don't use as much both, about 6-7 cups and put in about 1/2 c. of good salsa for spice. Makes great leftovers with flour tortillas.

I loved this recipe. It had loads of veggies with just a touch of meat. I soaked the beans overnight and changed the water a couple of times to prevent gas. Deee-licious and noone complained of gas :-) Freezes well.

This is really good soup. I love the flavor, and the lime sour cream it wonderful with it. Next time, however, I will cook the beans before adding the other ingredients, then continue to simmer the beans for a while longer after adding the bacon, tomatoes, etc. I think the beans will be more tender if they are cooked before adding salty or acid items.

This soup recipe is absolutely delicious. The cilantro-lime sour cream and chopped tomato on top are a very nice compliment to the soup. I agree that it would be great if a little thicker, but next day leftovers solve that! A definite crowd pleaser. Thanks Bon Appetit!

I made this recipe twice for guests at our Bed & Breakfast and steakhouse. I was complimented very heartily each time. This is a definite must save recipe. I made 4 times the quantity and it really is a big hit. It is even better if allowed to set overnight and served the next day.

Wonderful, very flavorful. The bacon gives it a nice smoky flavor. I've also made it without bacon for my vegetarian friends (just added more salt and used vegetable broth). The cilantro/lime sour cream is a nice touch also. I found 10 cups of broth was too much, about 7 cups was better, made it thicker.
