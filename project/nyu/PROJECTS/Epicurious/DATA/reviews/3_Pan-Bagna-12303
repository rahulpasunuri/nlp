The only made a couple of substitutions to this recipe is due to my fiance's distaste for olives, so I substituted capers. I used a seeded baguette. Added extra olive oil to the emulsion and 2 more cloves of garlic. And cucumbers. HUGE hit. Next time I think I'll add red peppers. Possibly roasted.

I added red bellpepper, anchovies, and just a couple rings of red onion to my PAN BAGNA...wonderful.

Great summet time sandwich. The flavors blends well together. It is sophisticated but even non-gourmets like it. I agree with another reviewer that high quality canned tuna can stand in for the fresh, but it makes good use of leftover tuna steak!

Wonderful! Have made this several times, always to rave reviews. A bit time-consuming, but well worth it. A great recipe for summer-time outdoor concerts.

I have made this recipe on several occasions, it has always been a winner. Everyone who has tasted it just loves it. I've subsituted canned tuna for the fresh and it is still wonderful
