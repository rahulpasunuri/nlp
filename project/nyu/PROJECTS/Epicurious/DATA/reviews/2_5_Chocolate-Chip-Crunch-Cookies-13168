I was very disappointed with these cookies, especially after reading the rave reviews. I added a few tablespoons of peanut butter for extra flavor but it didn't help. The rice cereal created a strange texture and they came out tasting like virtually nothing. A waste of ingredients and calories if you ask me!

I've had problems with spreading in the past and eventually learned the source: substituting ingredients or not following directions. Use butter, not something else; make sure its softened; not melted. I've made this recipe three times and haven't had a problem. I also doubled all the ingredients except for the chocolate, same cooking time and the results were delish. Crunchy and chewy at the same time.

Great Recipe Would make it with less chocolate chips and more rice crispies. Recomend doubling the recipie because cookies come out really small so make bigger cookies. I used a pampered chef medium scoop for the sizes.

I made a few adjustments due to on-hand ingredients. For instance, I didn't have the rice cereal. I also, on some advice from a friend, added a few tablespoons of candied orange rind to the mix. Incredible!

I agree with the reviewer who said that these weren't bad but they weren't great either. I much prefer traditional chocolate chip cookies. I had no problem with the cookies spreading.

These were really GOOD very simple and quick. I left out the crunch part because I did not have any. I did not have any spreading they were a bit too salty however.

This is a great cookie! I doubled the recipe because I didn't think there would be enough to go around. It doubles easily. These cookies freeze very well and even taste great only a few minutes out of the freezer! The crunch makes them special. I add a packet of instant coffee to the dry ingredients for a mocha flavor!

I've had better chocolate chip cookies but there's something about the Rice Krispies in the dough that makes them special. Everyone is delightfully surprised when they bite into them. They need something more though...the flavor is not as buttery as it should be.

These cookies weren't bad...but they weren't great either. They ended up spreading too much for my liking while baking. Although I did enjoy the crunch that the rice krispie cereal gave them.

too much effort for a few cookies i like a recipe that will make a couple of dozen at a time. My children were not fussy about them either

I found the cookies quite tasty but portion of chocolat chipe was to much for 1/2 cup of flour. I would give the recipe 2 forks.

I only rated this dish one fork because they didn't have a zero fork option. The cookies were terrible, melted all over the pan, and in general were a waste of good chocolate.

This is a good cookie. It has a crisp chocolate toffee taste.
