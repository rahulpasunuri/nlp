Wow! The best thing I've made in a long time. I used locally caught red grouper and a basket-full of beets from the farmer's market. I substituted escarole for arugula because that is what I had, but I wouldn't opt for that again. Couldn't find creme fraiche at Publix, so used sour cream. We only use greek yogurt on a normal day, so it was quite a delicacy despite. I would make this again and again!

Great recipe. First rate choice when you're putting on a dinner for guests you'd like to impress.

I wasn't sure I'd like the horseradish sauce (similar to one I've made for beef tenderloin) with the halibut and beets, but it actually worked very well. Everyone enjoyed it and ate every bit of the halibut. The good thing about this recipe is that it can be ready in advance and then just cook the fish and assemble it in the last few minutes.

This is really outstanding. I bought this cookbook when it was published but for some reason I never cooked from it and it has been sitting on a shelf. I was looking for a good halibut recipe and this popped up. I've already tabbed a couple of ofher recipes in the cookbook! In this dish, it was amazing how much flavor the lemon and thyme infused in the fish. Search for the beets separately on epicurious. They are absolutely delicious and the horseradish creme fraiche was essential. Wouldn't change a thing.

This was amazing, a definite keeper for guests or simply us. I followed the recipe as written and it was easy, beautiful, and absolutely delicious. Since I didn't know how to make the horseradish creme fraiche, I simply searched for a recipe on epicurious and found it. A simple hyperlink to the recipe would be easy and helpful. We enjoyed this with a bottle of 2008 B.C. Kettle Valley Gewurztraminer - perfect!

I'm sure the dish itself is very good. My review is of the recipe. One of the ingredients is "Roasted beets with Horseradish Crème Fraîche". Usually, there'd be a link from that "ingredient" to a recipe for it. If I'm going to make this dish, I need to know how many beets to use, how to roast them and what, exactly, is "Horseradish Crème Fraîche". Perhaps there is a recipe for Horseradish Crème Fraîche elsewhere on epicurious. I'll look. Either way, this recipe--as it currently exists on the site--is lacking some important information.

This is an excellent and easy dinner that will wow your guests. We added fresh goat cheese to the Roasted Beets.
