The recipe calls for removing the rhubarb from the wine before it falls apart, which I never manage to do, but the results are amazing anyway. I just fish out whatever rhubarb is still intact and reduce the wine/sugar less than it calls for. This recipe also makes amazing sorbet, pureed and frozen in an ice cream freezer. (I use 3 cups in my 1.5-quart machine.)

I added about two tablespoons of diced candied ginger. This recipe accompanied perfectly barbecued rib pork chops.

Really great recipe. Easy to make and tastes great with vanilla ice cream!

This is very good, but a little too sweet. I think I liked the rhubarb better when I was sampling it before chilling it in the wine reduction. I'm wondering if I did something wrong, although it still got good reviews and I would make this again.

incredibly delicious, lowfat (vegen, even)! I served it over coconut sorbet because we are currently not eating dairy. I came across little pieces of orange rind that had been boiled in the syrup...yum! Make this with the spring rhubarb that is probably just coming on now in your garden now. Don't worry about peeling the rhubarb.

I used excellent Cabernet for this and the result was outstanding. Mixed in fresh strawberries at the last minute and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Wow.....

This was simple and tasty served over vanilla ice cream. The wine flavor really came through, so don't use really cheap stuff. In fact, the wine almost overpowers the rhubarb. That said, I'm make it again.

This was great! Only problem - the wine needs to be boiled for more like 10-15 minutes to reduce down to 1 1/4 cups...

Fantastic! Followed the recipe, but halved it and still had plenty. A lovely well-balanced flavour.
