Delicious!! I added red and black pepper as well as some chile powder. It was delicious! I pan fried the snapper filets and topped it with the sauce. It was a big hit!

I have cooked this dish many times...each time altering the ingredients. Try pan frying or searing the fish. It adds a nice texture to the dish. To finish, while fish is still warm, top fish with sauce. Very Good

i think if you use very fresh high-quaity curry powder (like kalustyan's) you will be happy with the depth of flavor, i also used twice as much ginger and garlic as was called for.

I make this sauce, served over lentils and rice, ALL THE TIME. My guests are always WOWED.

If you are craving a good, rich curry dish, skip this one.

The sauce was very tasty and very easy to make. I used snapper fillets instead and wrapped the whole lot in foil and baked. I think it would work well with other fish. I think the freshness of the fish makes a big difference.
