I made this recipe with a couple of tweaks and substitutions (using what I already had on hand). Instead of buying Italian dressing, I made on my own (something I don't usually keep around). Used my own blend for the curry power (coriander, nutmeg, turmeric, and cumin), and a fresh red pepper, seeds and membrane removed and finely chopped. Being short on time and hungry, I only marinated my drumsticks for 20 minutes. I then browned the chicken in a dutch oven and braised for about 30 minutes. Served with coconut and cucumber rice. Pretty sure this was authentic but it sure was delicious, flavorful and easy. The braising definitely helped the flavors, I didn't even have the use the extra sauce I made from the leftover liquid. Will definitely make again.

I second that. SERIOUSLY. Get over it. I LOVE to cook AND I work for a living so I consider having bottled salad dressing in my Refrigerator a time saver. This is a dinner I can make during the week. In fact, I can start this in the morning while Im having my latte and cook it when I get home from the office.

When will Epicurious stop including recipes such as this one, which calls for "bottled dressing???" The fact that the "cook" chops ginger hardly qualifies this as a recipe. Why not just say, "Go to freezer section of store, buy pre-made chicken curry," and be done with it? This is pathetic, even ridiculous.

Beware of any recipe that calls for italian dressing in an indian curry. I decided to try this due to the rave reviews. Sorely dissapointed. There are plenty of easy to make curries that are far superior to this one.

very good and very easy. I was initally very skeptical, particularly since I could smell the Italian dressing even as the chicken was cooking. You could not taste it at all in the dish though. I did make a few changes. As others have mentioned, I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before marinating. I also added a dash of chili powder to the marinade for more heat and some garam masala. The color is a lurid yellow, so I added a tablespoon of tomato paste while cooking which brought it down to a more palatable color. I thickened it up with a little cornstarch, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, threw in some petite peas near the end

Outstanding & so easy. Doubled the marinade + extra curry for whole cut up (skinless)chicken. Used homemade stock (more than called for) & simmered uncovered for hours until the meat was falling off the bone. Roasted carrots, onions & broccoli & served w/jasmine rice & yogurt. Was asked to make it again the following week!

This is an incredibly easy recipe. I liked it very well, and based on that alone would give it a 3--very yummy--but the ease with which it goes together, plus the over-the-top raves from my picky kids make this one a four. Definitely making again soon, and doubling the recipe.

This was exceptional. I made this for my fiance and he really liked it too. I don't think he ate anything other than American and Mexican before he met me - so if he liked it...REALLY good sign...

Excellant! Would have never made this if it were'nt for the reviews. I make authentis Indian all the time and this dish is just as good if not better than most of the time consuming authentic Indian dishes. Surprisingly complex flavors. I did double the sauce and added fesh basil at the end.

I loved this dish. I made it for the first time for 2 people who both know and love curry dishes well, and they thought it was exceptional. One point. I agree that more sauce is needed. Once the chicken was cooked at the very end, I removed the chicken and then added another cup of chicken broth and let the extra sauce boil down and thicken a bit more. I also made it ahead to time, and kept in in a 300 degree oven for about 1 hour. Knowing I was going to do this, I made sure that the chicken was not overcooked so that it wouldn't dry out. I think leaving it in the oven helped the spices to permeate the chicken. This one is a keeper!!

Simple recipe with great results. I only use home made chicken stock and that was the only variation I made to this recipe. I served it with Basmati rice with dried cranberries and green beans. Lovely color and presentation for a everyday meal.

This is an excellent dish! It is true that you need more liquid, and I also add more pepper to make it spicy. My whole family loves it!

Thanks to everyone's advice, I doubled the Italian dressing, left in 1/2 cup of chicken broth but also added 1/2 cup of coconut milk. I also added a small amount of flour mixed with water to slightly thicken it, even though the coco milk did make it pretty creamy! This was fabulous - my husband and even one of my picky sons loved it! Served with Jasmine rice - perfect!

Previous notes had said to add more liquid, either broth or dressing. This is a definite! I added the additional liquid while the chicken cooked on the stove. I added a little cornstarch to thicken sauce after chicken was removed. It was great to spoon over chicken. We made the Baked Basmati Rice dish too. This was a hit for a gourmet club dinner. I will make again since we love Indian food.

Excellent! My boyfriend and I loved it. I marinated it for 24 hours, and doubled the sauce. I left out the broth completely and used yogurt instead. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful- I didn't have sundried tomatos so I added some chopped seeded fresh tomatos and some roasted corn. I put the left overs over a salad the next day.

Quick, easy,delicious with surprisingly complex flavors. Thanks for the advice: cut chicken into nearly bite sized pieces to start. Had fat free balsamic vinagarette on hand (trader Joes) so used that. Could not taste "salad dressing" at all in the end. Extra 1/4 tsp or so of curry and red pepper. Marinated 6 hrs. Cooked it all together (a bit dry), but after adding light coconut milk and a bit of yogurt, it was awesome. Tossed in tiny peas, served over brown basmati rice and naan on the side. Requests for adding this to the menu more often. I don't know how authentic this may be, but thought that something a bit sweet (raisins? a bit of pineapple?) would offset the heat and add more depth. It is so quick and easy yet would be great for guests who would appreciate these flavors.

Absolutely delicious! So easy and fast to make. This is a keeper!

I loved this dish, very flavourfull! I added the chicken broth at the end and simmered it for 15 minutes to thicken the sauce. It felt like cheating using Italian dressing though. Does anyone have any suggestions on creating a similar flavour but with out the bottled dressing? Will definitely make again, good enough for company for sure! A tip for people who like to add stock to their dishes, I freeze my chicken stock in ice cube trays and store them in bags in my freezer, that way when i need to add some extra flavour I just throw in a few cubes.

This turned out okay, but kind of weird with the Italian dressing taste. I upped the curry powder, and next time I will add other ingredients (raisins, coconut milk) as suggested by others.

my family likes curries foods, so when i made this it was great. it was very quick and required very litle before-cooking preparation...i pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch thick so they would cook faster...and added white wine to the marinade b/c it looked to dry..will definetely make it again

A few shakes of garam masala turned this good Indian dish into a great one, and gave it a 4-fork rating.Stir in yogurt at the end instead of coconut milk or flour (as some reviewers have suggested) if you want a thicker sauce and an authentic Indian curry. (Okay, okay, so the Italian Dressing took it out of the "authentic" category...) Coconut milk belongs in Thai curry, and the Japanese people use flour to thicken theirs. If you like coconut milk in your curry, I would suggest that you try some of the fabulous authentic Thai curry recipes available on the web. (Authentic Thai cuisine NEVER calls for curry powder, by the way!)

I've made this one for years and really like it. Very easy to make, and easy to add to so it doesn't seem like the same old same old. In the past I've added raisins, potatoes, broccoli - whatever I have on hand.

Rating: 4
Definitely a 4 fork dinner. The only modification I have made is I cut the chicken into small pieces (per earlier reviewer's recommendation). I always marinate overnight for better flavor. Lately I have added veggies (frozen stir-fry veggie mix from Trader Joes) at the end and tossed with the sauce to make it a more nutritionally complete meal. If you are heat (spice) sensitive, you may want to reduce the red pepper flakes by 1/4 tsp. Forget white rice - this tastes better over basmati or jasmine rice. This recipe couldn't be more simple.

This is a really good basic curry, it tastes good, is easy to make, easy to find ingredients. A good idea to add extra/more of the things you love in a curry - coconut milk, flour to thicken sauce. I also made this with beef (used vegetable stock) it was good!

I thought the sauce was rather gloppy although the flavor was nice. Overall, much as I like to cook, $12 can buy a great Indian meal here, so I wouldn't bother to make a dish that I'd call "not bad".

I served this dish to a friend of mine who loves Indian food. It was my first time making an Indian dish. My friend absolutely loved it, as did I. My husband also loved this dish and he is not a big Indian food fan. I did add some cocunut milk and omitted the broth.

Love this recipe, but made some modifications to make it the chicken more tender. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and marinated it for 1 day. I stir fried the chicken and omitted the broth entirely since it seemed to make the chicken tougher. Who would have thought that Italian non fat dressing would make all the differenced?

Very tasty. We used coconut milk instead of chicken broth and it made all the difference. Make extra sauce and put it on top of rice (we used yellow rice). This will become one of our standards.

very good and super simple. marinated it for at least a day, and just dumped all of it in the pan. took the chicken out when it was done, then added a bit of water to the remaining marinade in the pan and let it reduce for the sauce. i also added some cucumber and garlic to the yogurt, and the textures and flavors complemented the chicken really well.

A very simple and easy to make recipe. Just a few changes that I would recommend. Cut the chicken into strips as the marinade will work much better. And I like to substitute a 1/3 cup of Coconut Milk for the Chicken Broth, and up the ginger and red pepper, and oftentimes substitute a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies for half of the chicken. Hmmmm... seems it's almost not the same recipe anymore, but it comes out quite nice.

This dish was fast and extremely flavorful - and low fat! We figured out that it was between 7 and 9 weight watcher points, depending on the size of the piece of chicken and whether you use yogurt. I will be making it again soon!
