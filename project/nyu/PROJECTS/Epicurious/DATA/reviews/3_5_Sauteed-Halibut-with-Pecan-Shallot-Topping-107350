I agree with others that this is an easy recipe but it was far from delicious -- fish was tasty iteelf but the nuts/shallot combo was dry and not too flavorful. I followed the directions as noted and tried some other reviewers suggestions. I will not make it again -- no one in my family liked it.

Simple, quick and great flavor!

Yeah! I like walnuts better. Other than that, a great topping, and gives you a chance to show off your halibut fillet sautee skills.

Wow! I made this for a simple middle of the week dinner and was so pleased! My halibut fillets were thinner than 1 1/4 inch, and I did end up overcooking it slightly in order to get the browned effect. Would cook it less next time. If it is not cooked through with the original searing, don't distress the resting time and the heat from the topping will complete it. (better under than over). Secondly: Do not rush the saute of the shallots. The sweetness that they impart when caramelized makes the whole dish. I served it with butter sauteed asparagus that was accented with shallot and lemon peel as well.A really good meal. prepared in under an hour- most ingredients were already in my fridge/ pantry.

Straightforward, healthful, delicious and easy. I can always make this by simply picking up fresh fish on the way home since I always have the rest on hand.

Delicious, quick and easy! I was liberal with the pepper and salt in seasoning the fish, with the fresh lemon zest in the topping and squeezed lemon juice over the filet as we ate. I served it over the "Green" (herb) risotto from this website, using brown rice to keep it healthier. (The risotto took 40 minutes so I wouldn't recommend it unless you have time to spare.)

Used most of the recipe ingredients, but cooked in a slightly different way. Dipped two filets first (1 1/2 lb total) in one whisked egg, then in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Then placed in pre-heated olive oil on medium heat over the stove. Patted a mixture of 3/4 cup chopped pecans, 3/4 cup chopped parsley, 3/4 cup grated parmesan, 4 cloves of pressed garlic on top of each fillet, flipping after about 3 minutes and cooking on other side until flaky. Then placed the halibut on plate with foil. Scraped up bits from the pan, added one tablespoon butter, and sauteed the shallots with remaining bits of nuts and herbs, adding grated lemon zest at end, then topped the fish. Served with sauce from PECAN-CRUSTED TROUT WITH ORANGE-ROSEMARY BUTTER SAUCE on this site. Had fun cooking this together with my sister-in-law on a fish night, north shore of Boston, with the scallops and cilantro gremolata from here, and we had an incredibly happy and delicious feast with our families. Even my husband who doesn't like white fish loved it.

I've already made this twice and both times, it turned out perfectly. The fish was not overcooked and the topping was delicious. Quick and easy to throw together.

This dish was excellent. It was very simple -- it presents itself and was quick. I will definitely keep this is my favorite recipe book!

Very good. Season well. Used all topping w/half amount of fish. Cook less.

Good and simple. I would use only with a fresh flavorful fish, and though I made for company I will prob. "downgrade" to an every night recipe, because it has easy ingredients and minimal preparation -- will try out something more complex and spectacular for guests next time, although they all enjoyed it.

Easy, elegant looking and delicious. I reduced the oil and added a bit more butter at the end.

Easy, very good, made the full recipe of pecan for 2. Would give this a 3 1/2 if it was available. It's up there with it's simplicity.

Loved this recipe. Quick and easy. Would reduce olive oil a bit and increase lemon zest. For those who have a problem with sticking, make sure to use a heavy pan that is very hot before putting oil in to sear the fish.

I replaced the parsley with cilentro and used almonds instead of pecans. It was wonderful.

Prepared it twice so far .. it is easy and delicious. I used chopped Hazelnuts for a change and it was equally good. I highly recommend this recipe.

Was looking for something new to do with some halibut fillets and picked this because it looked good and I have some wonderful Georgia pecans from Xmas. We were not impressed - this is just boring. Saffron mashed yukons and sauteed chard with garlic couldn't save it!

My husband and I loved this recipe and would definately not hesitate to use it again. I would recommend having everything chopped up ahead of time and side dishes nearly complete since this dish goes together pretty fast. We had no leftovers!

Very nice and easy. I disagree with the previous reviewer; the topping does not overpower the halibut. (If it does, just put a little less on!)

Rating: 2
Halibut is too delicate of a fish for this topping. It overpowers rather than enhances. A fruit salsa would have been nicer.

We substituted swordfish because the day I went to the fish monger, the swordfish was totally fresh! We grilled the fish out doors and I prepared the topping on the stove...we both loved it!

Excellent! Used a whole calico bass and micro steam it. Used chopped green onions instead of shallots. Seasoned cavity with salt & pepper, sprinkle some green onions and thinly sliced lemons in cavity. Added slice lemons on top of the fish. Cover with plastic wrapped and micro cook 5 mins on high, then turned fish over and 3 mins more. Sprinkled pecan green onion topping. Served with basmati rice. Yum!

We liked this recipe, but if I make it again I will use a non-stick skillet. I lost the nice brown crust on the fish when I turned it, and the same thing happened when I lifted the fish out of the pan. Flavor was good.

This was the first thing I have cooked in several years, and my girlfriend just about fainted it was so good. I wish I could take credit - the recipe is fabulous.

We loved this fish! I used orange roughy instead of the halibut, and it was fabulous. I served it to my kids without the nuts, and they loved the fish just plain. Such an easy recipe! I'll make it again and send the recipe to my friends.

Nice presentation for one of our favorite fishes without too much time or trouble. We'll have this one again. No changes needed.

This is wonderful for an easy weeknight meal that tastes and looks really special. I used Tilapia fillets - my usual substitute (inexpensive and low mercury content) - and it turned out perfectly. Highly recommended.

Excellent recipe! I forget the butter (had planned to use margarine) and it still turned out awesome! Great opportunity to impress my wife!

I am not a big fan of pecans, but I thought this dish was delicious. It is quick and easy to prepare. I served it with mashed potatoes and my family loved it.

Definitely a winner and very easy to prepare. I used scrod, which was available that day. Rather than cook the fish first (I don't like the idea of keeping it warm), I prepared the topping separately, then sauteed the fish and immediately served it with the topping. Good enough for guests next time around.

This was pretty tasty. The only trouble I had was that my halibut fell apart. I think next time I will broil in the oven, so I won't have to turn the fillets.

this was hideous. the shallot and pecans sauteed in the same pan that the halibut was cooked in made the whole thing taste fishy. The nuts compeletely overpowered the fish. would def. not make again.

Simple, quick to prepare, tasty and elegant. The shallot nut topping adds the perfect amount of richness to the halibut. I followed the recipe to the letter, and the only thing I might change next time is to add a bit more lemon zest. The halibut only needs 4-5 minutes at most; resist the urge to leave it on the heat any longer.
