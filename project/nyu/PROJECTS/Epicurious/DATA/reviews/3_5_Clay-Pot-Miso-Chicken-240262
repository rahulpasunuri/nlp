I didn't find this overly fatty at all--I think it may depend on the source of your chicken. Ours was from an asian market that uses small chickens, and we defatted the pan juices as prescribed. I liked the burdock, but if it's hard for you to find, you could sub another root veggie, yes, but I'd use something other than parsnip or carrot to avoid the dish getting too sweet overall.

Has anyone tried using chicken drumsticks and the wing and drumlette for this recipe? Thanks!

Chicken Miso---without the Miso...This is a great one pot meal with a Japanese flair. Having moved to a remote location, I was unable to find miso and the burdock root(what a shame, but typical) but purchashed all other ingredients before figuring that out so went with it anyway. It turned out great, wasn't too sweet as I had worried. I used 3 boneless skinless breasts and cut each into 1 inch squares. First browned them, then sauteed onions, etc followed as writtten then returned chicken to pan and cooked slowly 220 for 3 hours. I only used about 3.5 cups of the chicken stock and no water. Why dilute a great thing? Will be making again! Enjoy!

Yum! I am really impressed with how this came out, considering I made quite a few deviations from the recipe. My version was with boneless, skinless chicken thighs that came out over-roasted when I left them in the oven for 45 mins on 500, and I eyeballed the amounts as I only had a few chicken thighs to eat. I didn't have the burdock root and I substituted dried shiitake mushrooms for the wood ear and fresh white mushrooms instead of shiitakes. I refrigerated the chicken overnight and then added the mustard greens the next day, and the flavor is very hearty and full. I was nervous about using the mustard greens, as I don't usually like them, but I'm loving how this turned out!

I was served a tempura style burdock last week made by Japanese friend. Loved it so looked it up and only found this recipe which I will try. Burdock can probably be found in oriantal markets as my friend said it is common in Japan.

soooo good. asI made the entiremenu we were quite full when we reached the main course, but the chicken was soooo good. Vegetarian version with adzuki beans and zukini was appreciated too. The quantity is too large for such a meal and we have enough leftovers for another meal. the idea of dry roasting the chicken instead of browning it on the stove is great and will be used the next time we want to feed a large crowd. Definitely a keeper. PS we were going to add spinach instead of mustard greens, but ended up not adding anything since we were so full.

this is exceptional! except, it is a bit too sweet, and i didn't add all that water, maybe half. Not sure why all the water is needed. Anyways, I didn't this with mushrooms for a vegan version. and stuffed them in buns. Here they are: http://kitchensidecar.blogspot.com/2008/12/shitake-buns-veggie-and-delicious.html

I have made this a number of times, every time getting rave reviews! I've even made it for a group of Japanese friends, and they asked for the recipe. I always try to reduce fat in any way I can, and for this I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, it was every bit as good, if not better, with the added bonus of not having to deal with the bones (I tried with with breast meat, and it's not nearly as good). I'm not a fan of burdock root, so I left that out altogether and didn't miss it. And I usually double the amount of ginger and garlic. Just like the note says, it definitely gets better after a couple days... Phenomenal!!!

I waited a long time to make this dish because of the gobo. I got everything, made to the t, and was really disappointed.

Usually I like to follow recipes the first time, and I did with this one with a couple of exceptions - replaced 2 cups of the chicken broth with two cups of sake. Though I don't know exactly what it would taste like without the sake, my family loved it. Also used parsnips instead of burdock root, and baby bok choy instead of mustard greens. The flavors are sweet, salty, pungent, earthy, and very comforting. This recipe lends itself to creative variations.

This was really good. The burdock truly is optional; I didn't find it added anything to the dish. If you must add a root vegetable, parsnips would do as well. I didn't have enough mirin, so topped the measuring cup up with Chinese rice wine (shaoxing)and an addn'l teaspoon of sugar. Fattiness wasn't a problem - I did make the casserole a day ahead, but only scraped about 2 Tbsps off the top. The only reason this got only 3 stars is that I'm not a huge fan of braised chicken. I think this might be ravishing made with fried tofu and gailan!

I loved this recipe, worth the effort. I did not use the wood ear mushrooms though as I couldnt find them. Big hit with everyone.

i really liked this recipe. I didn't follow it exactly -- no wood ears, no burdock, no mirin (white wine instead) -- but you can't skip the miso! The greens are great -- use whatever you have, but a hearty green is great here. homey and delicious!

Flavors great. Good make- ahead dish. One question: Do you serve the rice on the side since the sauce is a broth?

This was DELICIOUS! I was unable to find burdock (even at Whole Foods), but otherwise made the recipe as written. The flavors are wonderfully deep and complex, and it's even better the next day. Definitely a keeper.

So easy to make and incredibly flavorfull and delicious. Asian comfort food that was a hit with all of my friends. I don't think the burdock root is necessary and I used dried shitake mushrooms instead of fresh.

I truly struggled in the beginning of the dish not to add salt or pepper to the necked chicken; but stuck to the recipe the first time over like always. In the end this dish tasted magnificent despite my reservations of many included ingredients of which were, to me odd. This dish turned out to be a huge favorite and success.

this took about 4 hours with all the searching for special ingredients, and was not worth the time. it was edible, but not amazing or reflective of such an involved and laborious recipe. won't bother again.

Made this last night. Very satisfying Sunday dinner, with rice... nice, complex taste in the broth and super tender chicken and mushrooms. Couldn't find mustard greens, so we used spinach... but we did have burdock root, first time for me. Yum! It's in season right now, so try to find it at your farmer's market or CSA. We used high quality, pasture-raised chicken, and the fattiness wasn't a problem. We prefer our skins crispy, not braised, so we pulled off the skins before eating. But, the overall taste was helped, I think, by leaving the oven-roasted skins in, with their lovely brown bits, during the braise.

I made this for a couples book club and they loved it. I thought it was a little sweet so I added 1/2 cp rice wine vinegar and I would recommend taking the skin off the chicken thighs after you roast them. It was not too fatty after that. I think 1 1/2 thighs per person is plenty, not 2 per person. I could not find burdock root but used its cousin artichoke hearts instead. A good meal. (I put the sushi rice in the middle of the bowl as well).

fins a source for lean chickens. Note that the other European reviewer to date had no problem with fattiness - that's because European chickens aren't loaded with fat and water.

yum yum yum. was a relatively arduous process, but well worth it... chicken perfect, sauce incredible!!

I'd skin the thighs, and that would eliminate a lot of the fat.

I don't know about the richness, but to cut down the fat, after you roast the chicken, remove the skin before you place the chicken in the pot. I think you'll be surprised by the amount of fat that you lose that way ... and the chicken thighs will be just fine without their skin.

I was so excited to make this recipe, and even used the burdock root, which I was unfamiliar with. Everything was certainly intensely flavored and delicious, but sooo rich and fatty ( and I am not afraid of fatty or rich food) it was over-powering. I made this a day in advance and chilled, then scraped off a huge layer of fat before re-heating, still, just too fatty. Great flavor, could someone recommend a way to cut the richness, maybe the addition of an acid component?
