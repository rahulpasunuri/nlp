I've made this more times than I can count! Serve it with Molten Chocolate Lava Cakes (the recipe on this site suggests Mint Fudge Sauce) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (the good stuff). Straining the berries is a step you cannot skip!

Made this to go with chocolate molten cakes. Quick, very easy,and tasted great. Left out lemon juice completely, and added 2 tbsp. of chambord, because I had some on hand. Would be fine without too. Will make again and again.

Easy and just perfect for a quick, simple raspberry sauce. Yummy on ice cream or with a molten chocolate cake.

This is a very easy and delicious sauce. Not too sweet! I served this dessert at a romantic dinner for two. It was a perfect ending to a candlelit dinner. I served it over pound cake. Again, it was a very tasty sauce and not too sweet.
