Absolutely fabulous with hazelnuts (I prefer) or pine nuts (husband prefers). Ridiculously easy for work night dinner.

Love this recipe--have been making it for years. I love this with the original asparagus;but change the vegetable seasonally(roasted zucchini in the summer,roasted butternut squash in the winter)with great results. Definitely do prefer it with toasted pignoli nut rather than the hazlenuts.

The is one of my favorite recipes! I make it quite often and it is delicious each time. Ocassionally, I will add grilled skinless chicken cut up into bite sized pieces. I also used chopped walnuts as I have a hard time finding hazelnuts.

Blah - I made the recipe as written and it was dullsville. It definitly needs some pep - maybe lemon zest or basil to lighten it up. But I won't bother again...

I made this exactly as written. Very rich but delicious. The hazelnuts are perfect with the mascarpone and asparagus. I can't imagine that pinenuts would be as good but I guess if you are not a hazelnut fan.... I'll definitely make this again.

Adding this one to the work night dinner rotation. I took other's advice and added garlic and pancetta & that combined with the roasted asparagus was great. Tasty and easy!

I have made this several times, and it is so good and so simple. I also added some sauteed crimini mushrooms and used pignoli nuts instead of hazelnuts. And put chopped parsley on top for garnish. The sauce is so creamy, and adding the pasta water helps with that. This makes a great first course. Light but delicious!

I used ricotta cheese and fontinella instead of the mascarpone and parmesan. I also added mushrooms to make it a more substantial dish for an entree. This would be excellent as a side for chicken or salmon. Defintely use the pasta water to make this moist. I had to heat the dish in the oven and it dried out quickly so I wish I had added the extra fluid.

I added some pancetta sauted with garlic to this, as it seemed likely to be bland. I think it would be good with salmon as well.

This meal has become one of our favorites!! It is absolutely delicious and we didn't change a thing. It is so good we served it to company and they raved about it. Will make it many more times.

Made as a first course. It was easy and tasty. I agree a great way to use fresh asparagus. I too might omit the Hazelnuts.

A dish that's easy to prepare on a busy night. Very flavorful. Added salmon to rave reviews!

Tasty and simple, as advertised, while being special enough to merit opening a decent bottle of white wine on a week night. Next time I will increase the quantity of salmon however, to perhaps 6 ounces. Be sure to season generously with salt and pepper.

My family thought this dish needed garlic and or onion to give it a bit more flavor. We did not think the hazelnuts were a positive addition - in fact we would definitely omit them if we ever tried the recipe again. This recipe definitely makes at least 8 servings.

Made it, loved it, great way to celebrate asparagus season, and we had a leftover container of mascarpone from Christmas. However... the recipe says the dish makes "4 servings" from a pound of pasta and half a pound of cheese. I figured about 1400 calories per serving for four. I think that's a misprint, should say 8 servings. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper, the recipe fails to mention that.

I found it to be bland. I added chicken and salt and pepper. Overall the dish was okay but lacked flavor to make it great.

I was very disappointed with this dish. My husband liked it, so I will make it again for him. You need to add the reserved pasta water at the end it helps makes the sauce creamier. I found the dish to be to bland.

I was looking for a recipe to use left over grilled Salmon in and this was perfect. Also added crimini sliced mushrooms to the liquid before simmering. The Salmon chunks I added just before the final heat through. Was wonderful with salad, rustic bread and pinot grigio!

I have made this twice already - my family loves it. I added some fresh Morel mushrooms (but any mushrooms will do) for a special dinner and it got rave reviews. We served this with the Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio, homemade garlic bread and an endive salad - excellent!

This was just absolutely delicious. Of course, I did play with the recipe a bit and added some peas and then some chicken, just to give us a more substantial dish. But even if you made it "as written" it would be lovely and simple, fast and elegant. How could anything with mascarpone cheese NOT be good?

I was hesitant to make this for my "food-spoiled" husband (he is the manager of a popular restaurant) but we both loved it! It's a nice side dish and so easy to make!

My husband and I loved this. The only thing I'd improve would be to use more asparagus, maybe a whole bundle for two.

Substituted toasted pine nuts for the hazelnuts as we don't like those. Would also substitute ricotta for the mascarpone as it's a little too rich and high in fat for our taste. Finally, I added garlic to the asparagus as nothing with pasta, olive oil and parmesan tastes good without lots of fresh garlic!

This was a great weeknight meal. I added more hazelnuts than called for and loved the extra crunch.

I thought this dish was very good. Very simple and light. I did not use the hazelnuts and next time I don't think I will bother buying the chives because I don't think they added much to the dish. I was also thinking about substituting other items for the asparagus such as proscuitto and peas.

Great dish I added some squirrel I found on the road it was superb!!

Very bland. After I made it and tasted it I added cajun chicken (that I had leftover) and some "Fox Point Seasoning" from Penzys. This helped, but, I wouldn't make it again.

This was a great pasta dish & was suprisingly light. Next time I would cook the asparagus a little less, but overall this is a great dish.

Loved this! It is so simple to make. I would recommend not cooking the asparagus as long as suggested, was a little on the mushy side (Iprefer a little more crunch). The toasted hazelnuts really add a great flavor.

I made this as an alternative to lasagna, stuff shells or manicotti on Easter Sunday. Everyone was oohing and ahhing and I just e-mailed the recipe to my sister-in-law who said she cannot stop thinking of this pasta dish and wants to make it. It was very simple and had such a wonderful clean taste and all the textures in the dish made for a wonderful alternative to the usual. Another recipe that made us a hit!

This is an ideal light dish for a busy work night. I followed the recipe explicitly. Although not outstanding, it was great for something so easy and quick. Would also work nicely in small servings as a pasta dish with a grilled meat.
