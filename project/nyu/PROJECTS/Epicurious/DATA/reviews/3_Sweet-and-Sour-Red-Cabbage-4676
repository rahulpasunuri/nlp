Easy, fast and a great combination of flavors. I wasn't sure how caraway seed and dill would complement each other but the end result was nicely layered flavors.

Both me and my husband liked this recipe. I thought it would be better with a little less sugar. Otherwise it was great.

On a cold rainy night, this cabbage was a great compliment for schnitzel -- pork or veal. I added a bit of whole grain mustard to the dish and it gave it a nice kick.

If you like cabbage, this is pretty good. My husband loved it and I liked it.

I was never that interested in cabbage until I made this dish. Fabulous! Ever since I saw the recipe in the Oct 97 issue, I have made it every autumn.

Minus the butter and dill--add oriental noodles (crumbled) and toasted almonds. Mix ingredients and toss with the vinegar and oil. Makes a great salad and adds an "oriental flare". Try it. It's delicious! I like it both ways!!!
