Very easy, quick and delivers on flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the parsley and it was fine. I used a sauvignon blanc for the wine. I will certainly make this again and share this recipe with friends.

Very tasty. We added capers and doubled the lemon juice and wine. We also pounded the chicken breasts - like paillard. A do over for sure.

I added a slice of provolone on top of each thinly sliced chicken breast, as well as extra wine, and it was mouthwatering. Button mushrooms worked fine but it would be fun to class this up with more variety in the fungus department. Paired with a salad this is a superb weeknight meal.

I have made this dish several times and am about to do it again tonight. Each time I used whatever mushrooms I had and they each affect the outcome as does the wine that I use, but no matter what I used it was always very good. A Keeper, thank you.

Very good! I doubled the sauce ingredients as others suggested and served it over pasta. I had no mushrooms in the house, so I added some sun dried tomatoes at the end when the sauce was reducing. Relatively quick and easy - definitely will make this again!

This recipe sounded good on paper, and the reviews were very positive...but... The amount of work to make this recipe, compared to the taste was not in sync. Even with wonderful ingredients like lots of garlic, wine and mushrooms, the taste was plain.

This is an awesome recipe that I have been making on a regular basis since it was published in 1991. It is almost identical to something I got in a local restaurant. I serve it over fettuccine like they did in the restaurant. Low carbers can use shredded squash instead of pasta.

Previous person ranked it low because they do not like wine nor do they want chicken?! LOOK FOR ANOTHER RECIPE!! DON'T RANK THIS ONE LOW BECAUSE IT IS WHAT IT IS! Your ranking was unfair! I liked it! but I put a light breading on it before cooking. I also added more wine than what was called for so I would have more sauce.

I make this dish time and time again. My 21 year old son requests it when he comes home to visit. The only thing I add is capers... I serve it with Angel Hair Pasta tossed in toasted garlic olive oil with parsley and steamed green beans lightly buttered and salted. Delicious!

Not bad, just bland. I would make 3 times the sauce recommended next time.

Very easy to prepare, and quite tasty for something so simple

This was a pretty simple dish to make but it wasn't anything special. It's only one step above grilled chicken with lemon juice. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

This is a super easy, quick, and delicious meal. The flavor is much more flavorful than you might think. Add lemon to your taste, and dust chicken with flour before cooking to help thicken the sauce. I have made this for many successful parties. This is a keeper!

Tasty and quick...I agree with the reviewer who threw the mushrooms back in while the sauce is reducing...definitely adds some flavor.

This dish was delicious. I doubled the sauce, but I halved the amount of lemon juice. It was just right that way, any more lemon would have been overpowering. This was an easy and tasty after-work meal that I will definitely make again.

This recipe is very easy to make, especially if your a mom who works full time, and needs a great, quick main dish to feed the family. I made this with the garlic mashed potatoes recipe in here, and the two went very well together. Family loved it!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish -- definitely a winner. I doubled the sauce which seemed to be just right. Easy & delicious!

The sauce was great and the dish required little effort to make. I thought the mushrooms needed a little more flavor though, so next time I will add them back to the pan while sauce is reducing. I tripled the sauce ingredients, and still wished there was more. Maybe add some cherry tomatoes and asparagus for color next time too.

Wow! This was fantastic! The sauce had such a robust flavor!

Very easy, and tasted great--my husband LOVED the mushrooms and sauce especially. I did use more garlic than the recipe called for, and dredged the chicken in flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Next time, I would increase the amount of sauce like the other suggested.

This recipe was excellent and incredibly fast and easy. I would boost the seasoning next time since chicken is so bland and more than triple the sauce ingredients. I added steamed asparagus for a nice color splash.

This was a good and very easy to make dish- perfect for a weeknight when I don't have much time to cook. I served it over angel-hair, which was good, but would have better if there had been more sauce. I think that next time I will increase the amount of sauce significantly, as some of the other reviewers suggested.

Tasty recipe. However, placing the mushrooms atop chicken is visually more appealing than putting chicken on top. Also, the recipe's a quick-cook and healthy, to boot! ruthkin

This was great and easy to prepare. Next time I make it, I will at least double the mushrooms and wine sauce because it is so good.

This was wonderful and very easy. I tripled the ingredients for the sauce and added a tablespoon of capers. For an "upscale" presentation I served this on a china platter with coil vermicelli, next layered the mushrooms, then diagonally sliced the chicken and placed across the top. Poured the sauce over all and sprinkled with the fresh parsley. Beautiful!

This was GREAT! I doubled the mushroom and chicken. Added 1 Tablespoon of butter to the wine & lemon sauce. Served over angel hair pasta. The kids loved it too!

Very moist and flavorful. Also excellent when shelled and deveined fresh shrimp is substituted for the chicken (adjusting cooking time)and served over angel hair pasta.
