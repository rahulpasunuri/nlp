I am always looking to add more veg...so I put it on top of a fresh tomato slice with a few leaves of spinage and I loved it . the egg yoke added a dressing to the veg that with the curry and blu cheese was very tasty!

Searched for three things I had on hand Canadian bacon, blue cheese and eggs and found this recipe. I placed each egg on an english muffin and it was delicious.

Nice quick egg recipe. The blue cheese and curry went nicely together. I tried the egg rings (first time using them) and they didn't work, the egg ran outside of them but that's maybe a problem with what I did (or my rings are defective). I'd definitely make it again.

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious. I made the recipe as directed and used "Sambhar Curry Powder" from Whole Foods, I love the hint of smokyness in this particular curry.

I have to admit that the reason I made this recipe, was that my cupboards are bare after Easter and I only had three main ingrediants to work with (Blue cheese, eggs & bacon) and this is the recipe that Epicurious.com came up with. Love that I could put 3 odd ingrediants in 'recipe search' and that it generated not only a recipe, but a good one! I did enjoy this, but b/c it's so rich & fattening, I'm 50/50 on making it again. THANK YOU to the previous reviewers that recommended using egg rings, as that was very helpful keeping everything together.

DElICIOUS! this is a great recipe for a full flavored breakfast. the blue cheese and the curry complemented well. i did have trouble controlling the egg. i recommend using egg rings or similar device to control the whites. or, as i did with the second batch, pull the whites back up onto the bacon as they are spreading, then flip the whole concoction like a fried egg. delicious, if not quite as aesthetic, results. definitely adding to the morning repertoire.

Only in Canada eh? How ironic is it that unlike my Aussie friend, I, a native Canadian, failed to have Canadian bacon in my fridge - egads! Undeterred, I used regular strip bacon and made a "waffle" weave which probably made for a slightly fatter, square shape but I digest... :) All kidding aside, after low-carbing for 2 weeks, I really needed a change to my morning bacon and eggs. I took Marc's suggestion and added more blue cheese.. maybe too much? (it was a little over-powering). Still, a delightful, quick and easy change to bacon and eggs.

an excellent breakfast/brunch recipe. i'm always on the lookout for tasty savoury brekkie dishes and this one fits the bill perfectly. i suggest being generous with the curry powder and blue cheese (i used stilton - fab) and position the bacon in a ring so that the egg sits neatly on top.
