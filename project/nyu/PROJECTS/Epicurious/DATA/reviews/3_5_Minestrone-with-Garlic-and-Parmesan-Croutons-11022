Delicious and easy. I ended up adding some water toward the end, but it didn't affect the flavor. The croutons are great.

I LOVED this. I did not use lettuce as moist greens freak me out a bit. My boyfriend ate two bowls which is unheard of. I am not a skilled cook but felt like one when making this; the croutons especially.(I had to make extra) Added some water and more broth. Ate it 3 days in a row and never got bored. DO IT! xoxo Kate-Ashley

The first time I made this as written and it was good. The second time I changed a few things and it was excellent. I didn't bother with the croutons since they didn't really dissolve and I'd rather just dip some crusty bread into my soup anyways. Instead of just 1 1/4 cups I added a whole quart of chx broth and thinned it even more with about a cup of water. I threw in a parmesan rind while it simmered as well. I omitted the romaine but added some basil. I also added some black pepper and a teeny bit of garlic to give it a little more kick. Everyone I served it to really liked it and it tasted great the next day as well.

Easy to modify to whatever is on-hand. Good winter comfort food.

The tomato completely overpowers the dish and makes it very acidic. The other flavors are definitely lacking something. The parmesan crouton was good; will consider using that in other dishes.

This is a delicious and hearty soup, but I did feel it needed a few minor modifications. 1) As other reviewers mentioned, it definitely needs more broth. The issue is that the croutons that are dissolved in the soup towards the end of cooking, while necessary for flavor and texture, tend to thicken it up a bit too much. If you add another 8 oz of broth that'll do the trick. 2) I added a can of Cannellini beans, which were yummy and made it more suitable as a main course soup. 3) I wasn't thrilled with how the romaine lettuce worked, so I tried it with thinly-sliced swiss chard greens. It added a really delicious bite to the flavor. 4) I also tossed in some chopped fresh basil at the same time as the greens, which also helped the flavor. With these modifications, it was a HUGE hit, and I will be making it regularly for a nice healthy dinner on cool Autumn evenings.

So much flavor with ingredients I got at the supermarket, and so easy to make. I substitued some leftover pesto for the parley & lettuce, since it was available. Loved the croutons.

We are planning on making this for a gourmet group we are in and did a dry run tonight. We thought this soup was delicious and easy. The croutons were wonderful. We did add extra broth and water as suggested by the other reviews. This is a real keeper!

This soup was flavourful, filling, and aesthetically pleasing! I am glad I read the reviews beforehand -- I added an extra cup of broth to the recipe and sprinkled shredded parmesan over the finished soup. Mmm...

This is a delicious, rich meal I can make for my friends. We love it with a little extra parmesan grated over the top. It's amazingly filling.

Loved this soup! Didn't have any "ditalini" so I just broke up several long fettuccini noodles into 1/2" pieces.... worked great. Definitely needs more broth. Croutons are a must! We also shredded Mozzarella over the top. This is now our favorite fall/winter soup!

Very tasty. Will make again, but will use more broth to make it soupier.

This colorful dish has so much flavor!! The croutons were great and easy to make. Only suggestion: lots of the liquid seems to get absorbed into the vegetables, so I added an extra cup or so of chicken broth to make it more soupy. Will definitely make again.
