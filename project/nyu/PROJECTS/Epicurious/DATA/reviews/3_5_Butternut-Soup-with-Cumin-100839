My husband and I loved this soup - although we varied a few items. We sliced the squash in half and roasted at 350 for 20 min, skinned and cubed, then roasted with onion and 5 cloves garlic for 1 hr. Liquified in blender with 2 cans broth then heated soup with seasonings and more broth. Overall the soup needs more broth (although with less it would make a nice mashed potato type substitute) and salt will vary depending on the type of broth used. I doubled the cumin and thyme. The cumin, thyme, garlic and squash made a sweet and savory combination that we LOVED. This is a vegetable puree soup, so it will have a thick consistancy...2 cups of broth could be substituted for milk for a creamier soup.

I too was having a difficult time with the pureeing. I ended up adding 2 more cups of liquid to the finished product along with a tsp extra cumin, 1/2 tsp paprika and a bit of celery salt. To garnish, instead of croutons I roasted four carrots, a bell pepper and fresh corn and topped the soup with that. It added that little bit of extra texture, and the roasted veggies gave it that little bit of a boost of sweetness with the cumin. I too pressure-cooked the squash for 4 minutes before to soften the rind, and added 2 cloves of garlic in with the Onions. Still a bit on the heavy side, it was a great soup. Easy to make and enjoy.

Like it better with curry powder instead of cumin. Otherwise made it exactly as is. A favourite at our house, even the kids.

Well, I baked the squash at 375 degrees for about 25 minuntes so that it would be easy to peel, but not too done. I had a large squash - so I tripled the cumin and thyme (not sure the thyme comes thru, so it may be optional). The cumin was delightful. I had to add more broth, and for the last leftover serving I added cream and I should have added more cumin. We loved it, lucky since my squash made enough for 10 - 12 servings.

I was hesitant to try this with the last reviews making it sound so awful! I had some squash already cubed that I did not want to go to waste so I tried it anyway. I roasted the squash and added the garlic and curry as others did and I thought the soup was very good. I will definitely make it again. To those who thought the soup was too thick--add more broth and adjust the seasoning!

I still can't get over how awful this was. How it has almost 4 forks is beyond me. This is too close to baby food with some pepper & spices in it. Why would I make this when there is a bomb proof wonderful leek/potato w/dill waiting to be made? Omg, what am I going to do with a gallon of this bilge before the garbage man comes next week? It can't even go in the compost due to the broth and olive oil. I'm so mad to have wasted good squash & time over this. Save yourself and find another soup to make.

This was awful; like baby food mixed with pepper and spices. I followed the recipe exactly as stated w/chicken broth. Croutons cannot save this mess.

Made this for my hubbie who loves butternut soup and cumin- but he did not eat this. I don't know if there is something wrong with this recipe, as this is just a puree of squash with cumin added. It's more like a side-dish you might find in an Indian Restaurant than a soup as it's too thick and the cumin overpowers the squash completely. Butternut Squash is a great flavor and deserves better than to be treated like this.

Think Babyfood consistency. YUCK!! I want my Mommy. Probably good for you, but not worth the chopping time.

This recipe produces a rather unpalatable soup. I can't believe it was dreamt up by Lydie Marshall. I'll put it in the fridge overnight and try to think of some way to salvage it. I'm sure that any more spices will kill the taste of the squash completely. That seems to be the point of some reviewers' suggestions. You have to wonder--why bother to make squash soup?

This is very thick and the cumin ruined the beautiful flavor of the squash. I added more chicken stock than indicated and the "soup" was still more like mashed squash with mexican flavorings. I tried to "save" the dish by adding curry like other reviewers had suggested, but this only made a curried mashed squash dish. So many other ways to present butternut...

A great soup! Will make it again. Very versatile. I used the recommended spice and added some of my own, just to taste, ginger, cayenne, coriander, the possibilities are endless!

This soup really needs to be made with 4-5 cups chicken broth or it's too thick, in my opinion. I used 1/2 carrots and 1/2 squash as that's what I had and it worked well. I also increased the cumin and added curry, as suggested by other reviewers and I agree on that choice. I also roasted the squash and carrots, along with 3 garlic cloves, instead of braising.

As other reviewers have stated, the only chore is peeling the squash. Otherwise, I made this soup in my pressure cooker in 10 minutes. It would be perfect for Thanksgiving.

We first had this at a dinner party and I immediately asked for the recipe. The hardest part is peeling and cutting everything up, but after that it's a breeze. I too added some garlic and additional salt, cumin and thyme. We also pureed with a hand mixer in the pot, then poured in blender to get a really smooth texture. The first time we made it we doubled it. This time we tripled the recipe. It freezes great and taste even better after defrosting! I guess the flavors have time to blend. Delicious!!

This recipe was fabulous! I used pre-cut and cubed squash (from Trader Joe's)...perfect for a quick and healthy week-night meal. I also doubled-up on the cumin and added a bit more broth (just to thin it some...personal preference). I know I will be making this recipe again!

I made this soup on thanksgiving and my only complaint was that I did not double the recipe! It was so well recieved that there were some that had gone for seconds! I too put 2 teaspoons cumin and curry powder and a couple of garlic cloves. It was delicious!

This soup is delicious (I roasted the squah then added it to the cooked onions). I made it a couple days before, froze it, then reheated on the stove. I added a little bit of heavy cream before serving and served with homemade croutons. Fabulous!

Very delicious, big hit entertaining guests. A bit labor intensive cutting all the onions and squash because I doubled the recipe.

Delish! Definitely roast the squash. One can never have too much garlic & cumin is super in this recipe - as much as you like. Thanx.

This soup is good as it stands, but by roasting both the squash halved with a bit of butter and I touch of honey, and the garlic cloves in a 350 degree oven, the carmilization brough out the best of what might be the blandness of the squash. Also, on occasion, I added 1/2 cup of carrots for variety....the cumin is excellent..but you can change the spices or add on if desired. The soup looks lovely served with a dollop of sour cream on top.

My butternut sat on the counter for weeks before I looked up a recipe for it. This soup is easy! I also added a bit of curry...just go easy on the ground pepper, as I used too much.

This was so easy to make and incredibly delicious. I added a little bit of buttermilk to make it creamy and it was perfect!

The soup turned out great but I made some changes. I roasted the squash, onions and garlic in the oven for about an hour. I then pureed the onions and garlic and mashed this mixture into the roasted squash. Added 2 t cumin, 2 t garlic, 2 t curry powder and about 1.5 t curry paste. Yummy, spicy goodness.

I am a real fan of butternut squash soup and have had some excellent ones, but this one was disappointing. It tasted like a puree of butternut squash, which is essentially what it is. Even a dollop of sour cream could only do so much to give it life. It was uninteresting, to put it politely.

This soup was very tasty, especially with the addition of the garlic and extra cumin as recommended by another cook.

A smooth, full-bodied texture soup. I added 2 cloves of garlic, 2 t curry powder, and doubled the cumin. Delicious with crusty french bread and a sharp cheese. My husband and friends loved it - even the girls (aged 9, 11, 13) who helped me make it.

This was great! Nice and rich without all the fat. I did reduce the salt, otherwise followed exactly. Next time I will bake the squash first and scoop out the meat. I nearly cut my hand off several times trying to peel the squash.

This was fantastic, I took the suggestion of the earlier reviewer who said to cut the salt in half and double the cumin. It was so delicious, and perfect for the coming winter months. I might even serve it at Thanksgiving!

Easy and Delicious! I added a few cloves of fresh crushed garlic and a teaspoon of curry to give it more of a kick. Nothing like it to warm the chills of a Candian winetr. Will definitely make again.

For those who like winter squash, this is a wonderful recipe. It is smooth and tastes rich. We served it with about 1/2 tablespoon sour cream dolloped intot the center of each bowl. We definitely plan to make this one again.

nice ! I roasted the squash instead of braizing which added nice carmalized note. Cumin is a nice touch - delicious. I will make again - wonderful flavors

I made this today with our last "accidental home-grown" butternut squash. I think a seed sowed itself in our garden! My husband and I loved it! I doubled the cumin and halved the salt. It was so easy - used the immersible blender - and only got one pot and one cutting board dirty!! YUM!!!!!!!

The Cumin compliments the Butternut beautifully! There's no cream called for in the recipe and is certainly not necessary if the soup is used as an appetiser. Extremely tasty!

Excellent! It can be made with or without the cumin for a change in taste. It's a great soup for fall.

This soup was excellent! It tasted much richer than it actually is. The diet and health conscious will love this. The cumin makes the taste lightly exotic. Everyone in my househols loved it. My husband raved about it.
