Even tripling the sauce (as other reviewers recommended) and adding ginger, this was still bland bland bland. Disappointing.

I agree with the previous reviewer about browning the tofu. I also cut my tofu in slices, dredged it with cornstarch and browned it. I also agree with previous reviewers that the recipe needs more sauce. I used 1/4 cup of oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. If you use all of the red chilies the recipe calls for it won't be bland. I didn't use as many, but will use more the next time. I served my eggplant with brown rice for a good vegetarian supper. It is a very good way to use Asian eggplant which I got in my CSA box.

For those who are having trouble with the tofu browning: Buy extra-firm tofu and drain out the extra liquid by pressing it between two plates weighted with books. Slice into planks (or cubes, but it's easier to turn planks), rinse and pat dry. Sprinkle with corn starch on both sides. THEN fry. You'll need less oil and you'll get a crispier result! As for the actual recipe, I wonder if I did something wrong. It was very underwhelming. Maybe it's just not to my taste? Maybe my sesame oil has started to turn -- it's pretty old. I dunno. But I won't be making it again. And does it annoy anyone else that Self recipes aren't posted with the number of servings they make? Especially as it gives nutrition info per serving.

This was pretty tasty, but definitely required a bit more oil than the recipe called for. Hence, not quite as healthy as would indicate by the recipe. I also tripled the sauce, since I was serving it over brown rice, and still it wasn't very saucy. You can substitute in almost any veggie that you want. I used eggplant, onion, and greens. Overall nice flavors and an easy weeknight meal.

You must use oyster sauce in this recipe, it has a distinct flavour and consistency (clam juice isn't even close). It can be found in Asian food markets or large supermarkets with a good international foods section. Also available is a "vegetarian" oyster sauce which uses shiitake mushrooms as the base instead of oysters. I sprinkled some spring onions after everything was cooked, just before serving.

My family loves this recipe. I use a tad bit more oil and I usually double the sauce. I also don't use the chiles (gotta keep it less spicy for my kids) but instead use a teaspoon or so of chili sauce. This is prefect because it has tons of flavor, but isn't too spicy for the little ones. This has become a weekly staple in our house. I love to find recipes that the WHOLE family enjoys. :)

I chose this recipe because of the homemade sauce, making it healthier than others. But, the sauce is kind of bland. I am wondering if it came out bland because I only find clam juice (not oyster sauce or juice) and this is what I used instead. I also did not add any pepper (I am very sensitive for hot spices) to the vegetables, so it may be that the combination of the sauce with the chiles would bring a more strong/unique taste. I used palm sugar, which I think goes better with asian food recipes in general. Added also shitake mushrooms and green onions. As usual, I did not follow the amount of ingredients; for the amount of vegetables I had, the amount of sauce was perfect (I only added a lit bit of each of the ingredients for the sauce). Thus, I would not double it.

Tasty, easy sauce recipe! I used eggplant from the garden (only had 2), tossed in some fresh green beans for color and body, and had a great stir-fry. Will definitely use this simple sauce again. Serve with some brown rice and sprinkle with Thai basil for a great looking and super healthy dish. Double the sauce if you like a more robust taste.

This is delicious. I used very little oil and toss a lot (eggplant) then added my tofu all in one pan. you don't need as much oil. anyway, I think some of the reviewers are expecting a saucy recipe- this is much more of a whole foods recipe type where you truly taste the flavor of the food, in this example, asian eggplant really tastes yummy with sesame seeds and lite oil....don't use regular eggplant...it's the wrong veggie.

Too much eggplant or not enough sauce. I think next time I will make double the sauce with a little less eggplant. That being said, my family enjoyed the meal, even my 11 month old.

I love the Spicy Eggplant Tofu dish at Chin's Szechwan in Carlsbad, CA. It's better than the Panda Express version. This recipe is a good start to your own home cooked version. A little practice and a little tweaking and you'll have a close second to your favorite restaurant version. I used my Calphalon Chef's pan since I don't have a wok, set on the power-burner on my gas stove. The tofu took me about 20 min to brown on all sides. May try deep-frying it next time to see if it's quicker. The eggplant also took longer to cook, about 25 min before it was softened. Might try oven-roasting the eggplant next time. In the last step when you add the sauce and the tofu back to the pan I mixed and let it warm for another 5 mins. Accidentally minced 2tsp of ginger so I added it along with the garlic and it tasted great. Left out the red chilli's. My 18 month old, 3-and-a-half year old, husband and I really liked it. Will use more sauce next time too.

I was wondering if this tastes anything like Panda Express's Eggplant Tofu...

This was my first attempt to cook tofu and eggplant. I liked it. The recipe is simple, but I was looking for something with more sauce.

I thought it was a good, satisfying vegetarian recipe. It's probably not low fat though after you've used enough oil to fry the tofu and eggplant. I didn't have oyster sauce and used a combination of fish sauce and soy sauce. I can see someone wanting to speed it up by buying pre-fried tofu.

We are trying to cook more vegetarian recipes and the whole family agreed this one is worth repeating. I left the chiles out, so the kids would eat it and it still had lots of flavor. Served with brown rice.

This is a great, everyday recipe, especially when cooking for one or two in a small kitchen. Add rice and you have a healthy, quick meal. From the comments below, it looks like people are having trouble with the tofu. Make sure you buy the type of tofu that is good for pan frying. When you look at it in the little carton, it should be a nice firm block with little pockmarks and have plenty of water around it. The silken kind will be smooth and take up the whole carton. You don't want to try this recipe with the silken kind!

I thought this was a pretty good recipe but it just needed more flavour. I added some soy sauce, extra oyster sauce, and a little extra sugar. Next time I make it, I'm going to marinate the tofu in soy sauce for 5 minutes before frying. Then I think it would be perfect.

I don't understand why this recipe has gotten such bad reviews. It turned out great for me. I added a little more oyster sauce and sesame oil at the end for more flavor. You do fry the tofu in the beginning, so why would you use fried tofu? And the eggplant released adequate liquid once it started to soften. I will definately make this again.

Works better if you use fried tofu. I also used chili flakes instead of the fresh chili pepper. doubled the quantities for the sauce and it turned out much better.

Well, I used this as a base for something that bears little resemblance to the original recipe.

I was really disappointed by this recipe. First since there is no cooking liquid I ended up with burned garlic and pepper after having to leave them 10min in a hot pan. Then the end result is not even spicy!!! Too bad, the ingredients had potential.

I only used one pepper - a jalepeno. Tasty dish, but seemed like more sauce was needed to better flavor the tofu. But then again we are new to the tofu world. I'd try it again.
