So so. I found that much of the filling melted and leaked out during cooking. Also the chinken was a bit tough, I would try pounding out the breast and rolling it like a roulade.

Because I live in Miami and am married to a Cuban...Guava Paste is a staple in my kitchen. I always have at least 3 packages on hand! When I need to mix guava with cream cheese, I find it helpful to use a grater. It is still messy and sticky, but is does finally mix in. I add it to muffins, cookies and make lots of desserts with it as well as add it to Black beans and other savory dishes! Hope this helps someone...grating it is easier than trying to melt it for sure! BTW....this recipe is delicious!

i thought this recipe was extremely simple, although i don't think it's entirely necessary to leave the chicken to season for as long as the recipe states.

This recipe was more trouble than it was worth. I used nine breasts and the six large cloves were enough. The filling didn't add anything to the recipe. It needed something else to comensate for the garlic. How do you soften guava paste? I found it hard to work with in the cream cheese . The broth was good and the best part was the carmelized mango! One mango is NOT enough. I used three.

COMMENT: I've not make this recipe yet, but I have a question. How do you get the guava paste soft enough to mix with anything like a cream cheese or nuts? I would like it soft enough to spread it with a knife. I've tried putting it in the microwave for a couple of minutes, but it doesn't seem to soften it. Thanks.

I thought that this dish was really yummy! I actually removed the tenderloin in order to make the chicken breasts a little smaller and added some extra stuffing. They were excellent with the tender mango! Tip: I threw the tenderloins in the remaining marinade and put them in the freezer... a couple of weeks later we had a bonus of tender, tasty chicken tenderloins!!!

Prep work takes a while, but well worth the effort.

Although the recipe calls for large chicken breasts, I'd recommend small ones. I couldn't even taste the filling in the large ones. The overall taste of the dish was good; it's just that I wanted to taste the filling and couldn't.

Everyone loves this when I make it. I have made it a few times. I serve it with a coconut rice. I thought the filling needed a little more so I chopped up Jalapenos and added them to the filling........... even better.

This is a fussy dish but it the end product tastes really good. I have Cuban heritage and this reminds me of a typical Cuban snack of cream cheese and guava on crackers.

I thought 6 cloves of garlic were overwhelming. It was a considerable amount of work considering the various steps. I consider guava to be one of my top 10 favorite foods but I didn't even taste it OR the cream cheese because of the overwhelming garlic flavor. A waste of time & ingredients. I'll admit the mango I bought was underripe (I bought it in desperation) but even at that, it was more flavorful than the guava. My guests were polite but refused a second helping and were not too sincerely complimentary. If I made the dish again, I would make some major adjustments.

I admit I made a mess with the presentation, but the flavors of the buttery, sweet mango and savory chicken were great. My boyfriend loved it and so did I. My mistakes were using an overripe mango and not correctly stuffing the chicken pieces. I like one reviewer's idea of using thin pieces and rolling them up. I might try that next time, although maybe it would come out dry. Very good and will try again!

This came out delicious! I am from the Dominican Republic so we use guava all the time; and this definitely had a taste of home.I did have one goof though, my husband bought thin chix breast so I had to roll the filling in the breasts...they still turned out great!

This was an absolutely delicious dish and I marinated the chicken the night before and stuffed it in the morning. Everybody is asking for more and I will satisfy them soon. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this on Mother's Day for my entire family. Everyone loved it. I had one piece left over and had it for lunch the next day and it was even better. I marinated the chicken overnight and stuffed it in the morning. Made things a lot easier.
