I love the recipe. I did add mushrooms with the shallots and herbes de provence that i purchased in france and a pinch of sea salt to the saute process. The HDP was the perfect addition. ps.. they make a little potholder that slips directly on the handle of the skillet.. I purchased this after grabbing a hot handle a few years ago.

We made this in the oven the first time, and it was great, however, since then we have made it on the bbq, with the sauce on the side. We actually prefer it on the grill, because of the issue of smoke coming from the oven, and the sauce doesn't seem to suffer from the lack of fat from browning the meat. It's a great "surf and turf" with Grilled Oregano Shrimp.

Followed the recipe exactly. I gave it three forks because I'm hoping someone will play around with it to help give input as to what's missing. It's good, but it's not great. Needs an herb maybe. The flavor isn't quite there. Might try it with sauteed garlic and fresh thyme added to everything else next time. I'd make it again though with some tweaking.

the best recepie ever! My husband loves this. I made it for him on our first valentines day. Remember to be careful that the pan stays hot for a long time and that it is super easy to burn yourself (I have done it several times).. this recepie is amazing and anyone who appreciates good beef will LOVE it. I am making it again tonight with smaller cuts of beef to celebrate the elections!!
