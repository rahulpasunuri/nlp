Fruits have ways been a favorite of mine. Finding this recipe is a winner because I could say that in general fruits fills us up in a healthy way. For sure I will have this most of the say. Do you have another recipe you could share?

i never cease to be amazed by how good real food is. this is just astounding. i started with oranges and strawberries that were sweet, so I reduced the brown sugar down to a teaspoon. perfect, sweet, tangy and fresh, with just enough juice given off by the added sugar. this is great for breakfast, but i would also pair it with angel food cake or a dollop of freshly whipped cream for a springtime dessert.

added some watermelon chunks and increased the mint. Leftovers were breakfast this morning

Simple and easy - and easy to modify. I used two grapefruit and one orange. Absolutely amazing - great for my friends and my family. Even my one-year-old nephew preferred this to dessert!

A great recipe for any summer meal. The only change I made was I used pineapple mint (used pineapple mint because it is in my herb garden, can't get any fresher "pick and pot"). This recipe is going to be come the base to alot of other menu items this summer :-)

This was wonderful and sweet. I used Splenda brown sugar instead and added raspberries too. BTW, to the reviewer below, it does not call for 2cups of sugar, just 2tbsp.

Simply fabulous. The mint added a great taste of freshness. I love that it's not so busy with lots of different fruits, although, having said that, I admit that I added a nectarine just because it looked good at the store, and it was really nice.

This salad is so deliciously yummy I had to comment. The combination of flavors is exquisite. Mint? My goodness yes indeed! I couldn't stop eating it. That being said, my husband was so dubious about the thought of eating mint leaves that he didn't eat any at all. His loss, I'm afraid. I will make this again and again and again.

Simple and delicious.

I thought this was light and refreshing. Strawberries are in season here, so they are very sweet. I tasted them first and then added a lesser amount of brown sugar.

Light and fresh with a lot of flavor. Good brunch fare. I cut up the fruit the night before but I kept them separate until serving time, saved a lot of work.

really nice change of pace from the typical fruit salad. I made a poundcake and used this on top. 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar is not too much, particularly if you need the juices for the cake (shortcake or poundcake).

Tasty, easy and simple. I dont usually put sugar on fruit but did for the sake of the recipe and my boyfriend who likes it that way. Sprinkle the brown sugar on to your own taste.

This is a very simple, delicious salad. The only thing is -- I did not put in the full 2 cups. Instead, I put in 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I think any more would be overkill. Nevertheless -- yum!

Ultra simple and very refreshing. Reduced the sugar by half and added more mint. Works well with pineapple, orange and mango too.
