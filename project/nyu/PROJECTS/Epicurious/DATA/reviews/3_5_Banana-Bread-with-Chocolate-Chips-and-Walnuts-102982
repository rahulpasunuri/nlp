Made this yesterday to take to a staff meeting at school this AM. It was given a big thumbs up. Modifications to the original recipe were- less sugar, since I used candied pecans for the nuts (chopped up in food processor), 3 large bananas (which yielded more than the specified 1 cup) and less chocolate chips on recommendation of several other posters. A nice, moist, flavorful loaf.

I have always had problems with center of banana breads being uncooked...but not with this recipe. I layer the choc. Chips and nuts ...my daughter..and all kids love the chips...it would be awesome with just nuts too! I am making it again soon!

Guess I'll chime in at review #453...This was a good loaf of bread, baked 55 minutes and had a sweet, crackly crust (its best feature). Not a recipe I'd call four-star, however, mainly because the taste is just so-so, and there are too many choc chips. Rises okay and looks okay inside. Hard to come up with an exciting review or find tantalizing words when the bread is simply not that inspiring. Since there's not much else out there like this on epi, I'll suggest cutting down on the chips and perhaps substituting mini chips, as well as saving a bit of the crumble mixture for the top of the bread instead of the inside. There must be a better recipe out there.

Despite following the recipe, the bread did not rise much (was flat) and was soggy on the inside. If I left it in the oven any more it would have burned the outside. Also, I like chocolate chips -- which was a factor in trying this recipe -- but this recipe calls for too much and they ended up being overpowering and perhaps affecting the consistency of the bread. The bottom of the bread was so heavy and moist it ended up sticking to the bottom of the pan and did not pop-out when I when to turn it onto the rack to cool. I'm still looking for a banana bread recipe that ticks all the boxes: rises well, cooks uniformly and tastes great. The banana flavor in this recipe is good but for all the prep you put into it, it is disappointing to get a flat-top, mushy-center cake. I have a top-of-the-line oven and followed the recipe but it just didn't work for me and I can't rate it highly. I'll keep looking for one that turns out the way I want it to.

Too many chocolate chips (should stick to 1/2 cup), too much sugar (3/4 cup is enough), and way too long of a baking time! I set my timer for 45 mins even though the recipe says an hour and 5 mins. It still burnt the outside. It's a shame because the inside was still flavorful and moist.

I LOVE this recipe! The only thing that needed to be changed was, because a person in my household has a food allergy to nuts, instead of using a full tablespoon of the flour mixture in the chips, i just used a teaspoon. Also, LESS SUGAR! Definately use no more than 3/4 cup. Otherwise, I loved this bread!

WOw, this came out sooo good. I was actually suprised from reading the reviews. Mine came out tasty (not too sweet but sweet enough, my 4 year old who has a BIG sweet tooth loved em!) and MOIST! I doubled the recipe and added 2 more bananas (from reading reviews), used mexican vanilla, made cupcakes instead, and not so many chocolates, oh and used earth balance buttery spread since I had no butter. I will definitely make these delish muffins again!

Easy and delicious. I made several changes, however. I used egg replacer (vegan) instead of the eggs. I omitted the white sugar and instead used a few tablespoons of maple syrup and 1 1/2 C of Rappadura (raw "healthy" sugar). I also added approx a 1/2 cup of coconut, went a little light on the choco chips & used 3 bananas. I baked for about 30 minutes at 350 and then turned it down to 300 for another 30 minutes. Delicious, moist, not too sweet. Perfect!

This recipe was fine but did not come close to topping my old standby recipe for banana bread. Also, it was a lot more trouble. As one who bakes all the time, I would not bother with this recipe. And all 4 of my kids agreed, even with the chocolate chips in it.

I am always looking for good banana bread recipes to use when my bananas are getting over-ripe and this one turned out great -- the result was a delicious banana bread that was moist and not too sweet. I used 2 bananas which turned out to be just under a cup because that is all I had left and I used 1/2 cup (instead of 3/4 cup) of chocolate chips based on other reviewers' feeling that the chips overpowered the banana. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, which worked very well with this recipe. I omitted the nuts because I have a nut-allergic child and it was still really good. I would definitely make this my go-to banana bread recipe from now on.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a favorite of mine and my families. I am known for my Banana Bread within my community thanks to this recipe. I always add more bananas which make it moister and omit the nuts. My daughter prefers me to make it without the chocolate chips. However, my boys LOVE the chocolate chips. I am off to bake 50 Banana Cupcakes using this recipe for may daughters Birthday.

Kids loved it, not my fave. I prefer banana bread sans chocolate, but the kids wanted me to try making it so I found this recipe. To me, the chocolate overpowers the banana. But I will try again with less chocolate and see if that comes out more balanced. The bread itself rose perfectly and was nice and fluffy. Cooked perfectly at 55 minutes.

Rating: 2
I have to say, I am really surprised how this turned out. It is not pretty at all. No rounded top, and it looks really greasy. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things: I excluded the chocolate chips and walnuts (husband says I make everything too chocolatey (????), daughter doesn't like nuts in things). I wanted to try a new banana bread recipe and with over 440 reviews with 90%+ saying they'd make it again....well, I had to try it. The flavor is okay...but the presentation is not pretty and I think it is just too greasy. I would recommend using 6 TBS of butter, not an entire stick. Maybe that would have helped. I am a pretty experienced baker, and I double checked to make sure I had all the ingredients correct. Oh well. Win some, lose some!

I love this banana bread, but I like mine a bit richer so I added an extra half cup of banana, a full cup of walnuts, and a full cup of white chocolate instead of milk (it caramelizes). Everybody goes crazy for it. My oven is a bit hot so, still figuring out the timing, m old oven was fine with 1 hour.

Easy to make....not enough of a "banana" taste for me. I also toasted the walnuts a little too long. They are still good in the bread though. I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on the top of the dough before baking. Added a nice little crunch to the top of the loaves.

My very first attempt at making banana bread and it was delicious. I did omit the nuts. Mine looked done after baking for 43 minutes instead of the 1 hour 5 minutes listed. Will definitely make again. I would like to try muffins next time as they'll be easier to put in the kids lunches.

Amazing recipe! I added some more chocolate chips (I like things chocolaty). I also sprinkle some ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg on top of the loaf before baking and it makes the outside very tasty! Doubling this recipe doesn't hurt it at all. I've made it over and over!

Delicious and sweet treat - our whole family loves them! I subbed a half cup of whole wheat flour for half a cup of ap flour and forgot to toast my walnuts, but these still came out moist and tasty. I made muffins instead of a loaf and 25 minutes in the oven was perfect - my chocolate chips did sink a bit, but I haven't heard anyone complain about it. :) Next time I might experiment with using less sugar or a different sweetener to make these a little healthier.

Rating: 4
The recipe is great but don't do the layering bit. Just mix the dry ingredients, mix the wet ingredients, and combine the two just until the flour is folded in. Don't mix too much or too hard or the bread will be too dense. Sprinkle the top with a few extra chocolate chips doesn't hurt.

Rating: 3
I am not a fan of walnuts, but the toasting of them before putting them into the mix makes for a great crunchy and rich banana bread. A neat mix with the chocolate chips and the banana bread itself is moist, hearty and just plain delicious...a real pleaser...my whole family loved it. It was gone in 2 hours! :)

I hate bananas. I don't like them in bread or smoothies or muffins. But my family likes them & occasionally we have a couple in the house that go brown. So, to appease my family I made this bread & it's awesome. We all love it! The only change I made was to skip the layering & mix it all together. I had no issues with the chocolate sinking to the bottom. YUM!

very good and moist. An hour and five minutes seems like a long cook time but it was great. I baked it late at night and left it in the pan covered with foil overnight. The next morning the chocolate chips were still gooey. Delicious!

I decided to follow the recipe exactly the first time I made it and then see if I should use any of the suggestions. I think it turned out excellent. The chocolate chips didn't sink to the bottom and the amount was just right. I did bake it for 55 minutes and turned the temperature down after I put it in the oven like others said and it turned out very moist and just a little dark around the edges. This is my new banana bread recipe! Maybe next time I will try a little cinnamon. The only thing I don't like is how in the middle the bread sank inward while it was cooling and I don't know how to fix that.

My son and I made this recipe and it was a cinch. We used 3 very ripe bananas. We didn't have a loaf pan so we made muffins instead. The recipe made a dozen perfectly. Because we made muffins, we mixed the walnuts and chocolate chips in with the rest of the batter. The batter was nice and thick so the chips didn't sink at all. Baked them for 25 minutes and they were nice and brown. Delicious! Might try adding some cinnamon next time.

made this recipe for a second time (forgot I had made it before). this time I made 3 mini loaves. baked for 30 minutes. because I was making the mini version, I cut back on the chocolate chips to a generous 1/2 cup. that is plenty. next time I would cut back on the butter. the bread is a bit too buttery, almost greasy.

I've tried a jillion banana bread recipes, and this is my favorite! Excellent fluffy texture. Turns out perfect every time! I don't bother with the layers... Just stir it all together. Great with or without the chocolate chips (though I add extra nuts if I skip the chocolate).

This is about as good as banana bread gets. I made it on a whim one night, took it to work the next day, and it was given RAVE reviews by my coworkers. If you make this bread, plan to share it - otherwise you may eat the whole loaf yourself in one day. It's really that good.

I don't normally rate recipes, cause I don't normally cook. But I had to tell you that this is a keeper. The only thing I changed was I chop the chocolate chips so they don't sink to the bottom and then I don't have to separate the steps of one part batter, one part chips and nuts, one part batter. etc. I just mix the nuts and chips into the batter as the last step and pour the whole thing into the pan and shove it into the oven. I doubled this recipe and make two loaves so I can stuff my face with one and freeze the other for when company comes. My husband and kids love this. I'm just sorry I have to share it. Sigh. So good it really is sinful. I have made this with an additional banana that i sliced up and overlapped on top in rows on either side. It comes out very nicely and provides an extra banana flavor. Of course this is overkill, but who is complaining?

Delicious! I used almost 3 very ripe bananas, which really brought out the sweetness. I also found that layering the walnuts and chocolate chips proved to create a balanced consistency of all ingredients. I can't wait to eat another piece!

After baking countless failed banana bread recipes, this is the best foolproof one to date! It`s not only super delicious, it`s very versatile! Of course, I modify the recipe to my liking each time I make it - depending on my mood. I don`t like chocolate in banana bread ever, so I always completely omit the chips. Sometimes I will add oatmeal and zucchini - which is amazing! This bread is also fabulous with nothing in it but bananas...which is how I make it the most of the time! I also make a streusel topping for it each time...so much better than chocolate in this type of bread. It is FABULOUS!

I thought it had too much chocolate chips, partially my own fault for not layering them as the recipe said, but still too much on the ratio. I decided I much prefer with only walnuts and spices, which I felt were lacking...ginger, cinnamon, cloves, etc. maybe also too floury and not banana-y enough.

I made these as cupcakes instead - and didn't layer the chips and nuts, they didn't fall. I also added shredded coconut to half the batch. It was a nice texture addition without throwing off the flavor. Will use for holiday gifts this year!

I had been having a very hard time getting my banana bread to come out with the right texture. It was very heavy like pudding. But then I discovered this recipe and it came out beautifully. I make only two change, I use milk instead of lemon juice and I use half the measurement of baking soda. I don't do mine with chocolate chips either. Anyway, I got rave reviews when I gave it to my friends.

Yum! I was short on sugar, so only added 3/4 a cup. I'm at high altitude (5280) and didn't need to make any changes which was nice. Also set the timer for 60 minutes and came back to a crispy crust - didn't effect moisture or taste - but next time i'll only bake for 50 minutes. Definitely a tasty treat for a snack or breakfast and super easy...will make again soon!

Liked another reviewer said, this recipe is very forgiving. I dropped the bowl with the wet ingredients on the floor and lost about 1/3 of the batter. I decided to forge ahead anyway and added the dry ingredients, minus about 1/3. It still turned out delicious, with a great crumb and moist. Next time I make this I'll try to get the whole thing in the oven without dropping anything and see if it's even better.

This loaf is super yummy. I used canola oil in place of butter; it's less expensive, heart healthy and creates a lighter more moist crumb. I also mixed some cinnamon in with the walnut chocolate chip mixture. The layering method works nicely. Be sure to use a good quality dark chocolate!

I made this bread with a couple of tweaks to make it a tad healthier. It turned out delicious!

Yum! Delicious, moist, and full of bananas. I don't think I've ever made anything this simple and successful. I made a few edits: using whole wheat flour, white chocolate chips instead of semisweet, subbing the 1cup white sugar for 3/4cup brown sugar. The butter I think was key - don't skimp on that - because the crust came out a nice slightly crispy brown.

Rating: 4
Wow! Currently scarfing down fresh out of the oven, and it's amazing. I made a few suggested changes- concern over moistness led me to use 3 bananas instead of the requisite 2, and I added 1/3 cup of sweetened coconut flakes. The coconut does not alter the texture but added the right amount of moistness. I also subbed some of the regular sugar for brown sugar and skipped the walnuts (I didn't have any). All I had was one lemon, which yielded 1 T, so that's all I added, and since I used a muffin tray instead of a loaf pan, I skipped the whole layering of the chocolate chips process- they didn't sink anyway. These are absolutely fabulous!

My new go-to banana bread recipe. Left out the walnuts since I'm not a fan, but loved the addition of chocolate chips. It came out moist on the inside with a nice crust. I used extra-ripe bananas, which I think was the reason it turned out a little on the sweet side. nonetheless, great banana flavor and everyone who tried it thought it was delicious. Next time, I'll double the recipe - one loaf just isn't enough!

Simply fabulous. And don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. Really, I think there is something to be said for a recipe that is as simple and straight forward as this. Butter, sugar, flour, eggs. Combined just so. I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe to a 'T', and loved it. It was fairly well balanced, if a little too sweet for my taste, though didn't rise quite as I had hoped. And so, at altitude, I noticed some adjustments that could have yielded a better loaf, thus vowed to follow up with a tweaked version. And I did make it again, this time cutting back on the baking powder ever so slightly, adding several table spoons more flour, and cutting back on the sugar by almost a quarter cup. Too, I mixed both white granulated and light brown sugar, which in my opinion creates a deeper flavour. I used three good- sized VERY ripe bananas that, although produced more than one cup once mashed, lent a fabulously ferocious banana punch. The bread rose to attention, the bread cracked down the center to perfection, and the bread browned blissfully. And it did so all in my questionably- aged, original to the home midcentury kitchen oven. I would recommend this recipe without reservation, and will make this banana bread my go-to banana bread, tried and true and ready to repeat.

Love this Banana bread recipe. I started baking it when I would babysit an ex-coworker's children. she had this recipe sitting out and it's FUN for the kids. they mix, break the eggs and get all flour-y. It's hard not to eat the entire thing when you're done.

I cut back slightly on the chips and walnuts, but I still think that it was too much texture and distracts from the banana bread itself. I will definitely make this again, but I will try using 1/3 c each of the nuts and chips.

I believe this is the first epicurious recipe I ever tried and I've been using it for years. One of the things I love most about the recipe is that it's really easy to modify. I often add golden raisins or dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips and I usually bake these as muffins--and when this is the case I frequently top them with cream cheese frosting :) Also, if you happen to be vegan or are lacking butter and eggs (the latter is often the case for myself) you can substitute applesauce for the butter and an extra banana for the eggs and it will still turn out perfectly.

Took suggestions of reviewers. Used Bundt pan, no lemon juice or walnuts, substituted with 1/2 c white sugar 1/4 c brown sugar, mini chocolate chips and 4 ripe bananas.

What's with the zig-zaggy fold in of chips and nuts?? I just mixed them in directly and it was fine... Anyway the first time I made it, it wasn't banana-y enough and the chips and nuts were overwhelming and the base of the bread was more like cake because of the high amount of sugar. So I made it again: 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 large bananas instead of the equivalent of two. I also baked them 45mins instead of 55 (much better). Overall good recipe after listening to the reviewer's suggestions.

Rating: 4
I've made and reviewed this recipe once before, but I made a second batch today and wanted to post some adjustments I made. I kept the same sugar modifications: 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. But this time I substituted whole wheat flour into the recipe and cut the butter in half. Then I added 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce as a substitute for the reduced butter. Made 12 muffins and baked for 25 minutes. They came out perfect! And the reduced butter and wheat flour result in a hearty muffin that doesn't taste like cardboard. Note: I should have used riper bananas, to make it a tad sweeter.

Rating: 3
This is a really nice and moist cake, but I really wish I had used raisins instead of the chocolate chips which are too sweet for it. Next time I will also skip the fussy layering and zigzag instructions, and just mix the add-ins with the batter directly. 2 medium bananas yielded just over the one cup that the recipe calls for (sure would have been helpful if it was specified).

Made this recipe last night, but made them into muffins since I don't have a loaf pan. I used the previous suggestion of 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar and they taste wonderful. Since I was worried about them being a little dry, I used about 1 and 1/3 c. mashed bananas (4 bananas). I baked them for 30 min, but probably could have taken them out a hair sooner. These are delicious and very well balanced and this will be my go-to banana bread recipe for long time!

I followed the suggestion of reducing sugar to 1/2 c white and 1/4 c brown, and it turned out great! The only thing was it was a little dry, so I'm going to try adding some applesauce the next time I make it. I made 1 loaf and 1 tray of muffins (took the muffins out early, of course). The muffins are great for a snack on-the-run!

I made this exactly according to the recipe (except that I used pecans rather than walnuts, just because I had them on hand), and it was terrific. Despite the chocolate, you can really taste the banana. Mine was done after about an hour. You could cut back on the chocolate chips and nuts and it would still be really good.

I substituted pecans for the walnuts and lightly stirred in about 1/3 c of frozen raspberries (broken into small pieces by hand as added) after beating the banana into the mixture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and the result was deliciously fantastic!!

This is a favorite of my family, but we all prefer it when I use a Bundt pan rather than a loaf pan. The crispy outer crust contrasts nicely with the tender middle. We can't see much difference between layering the nut mixture and just mixing it in - either way is great.

I have made this banana bread countless times and it never ceases to get compliments!

I make banana bread all the time. This recipe is too sweet for my taste. I use 1/4 c. of good maple syrup and 1/2 c. of organic brown sugar. I also add 1/4 c. of flax seed with freeze dried blueberries. Instead of chocolate chips add fresh or frozen blueberries to the mix. My husband thought it tasted so good last time that he thought he was eating chocolate chips instead of blueberries!

I doubled the recipe b/c I had 4 large very ripe bananas and oops only one loaf pan. Made the rest into mini muffins. Excellent. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Next time I would use less sugar as it is a little sweet for my taste. Since my children are VEGAN and WHEAT FREE, I made it with a combination of spelt, oat, barley and millet flours, Enrg egg replacer and soy margarine. No one could tell it was not the exact recipe. My guests all wanted more.

More like a coffee cake (or sweeter) than a true bread. Make sure you add enough batter to the first layer so the chocolate chips don't melt through and make it stick to the pan. The chocolate/nut layers are very rich and even with an extra banana, they overpower the taste of the fruit...which in my case is a good thing because I don't care for plain ole banana bread. Brought it to a Halloween potluck and heard many compliments.

I don't care for traditional banana bread but had over ripe bananas that needed to be used so I was nicely surprised by how good this banana bread is! It is very moist and flavorful - more like cake than bread (and without that nasty pudding mix in it!). I instinctively reduced the amount of sugar to about 3/4 cup, and next time would reduce it even more. The chocolate chips add enough sweetness that it doesn't need that much sugar. Otherwise I would have given it 4 forks.

Excellent recipe. I threw in some golden raisins instead of choc. chips. That was delish. I also used 1/4c. brown sugar, 1/2c white sugar and added 1 t. of cinnamon. Baked in muffin tins instead and really enjoyed how moist the muffins turned out.

Turned out great. I agree... use less sugar, and I halved the butter then added a little olive oil instead. Next time I would add more banana.

Very good recipe. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup +2 Tbps (125 g), only used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (100 g) and a hanful of macademia. Although the recipe is very good I think I prefer "Aunt's Holly banana bread" from the database for breakfast: more intense on the banana flavor and not as rich.

White Chocolate chips in one heavy layer in the middle creates a deliciously integrated flavor of moisture! This is a keeper!

Add extra bananas, a little cinnamon and pecans instead of walnuts. I don't bother layering, just mix it all together and bake. Wonderful! I make it all the time, and get requests for more from everyone who tries it!

This recipe has won me rave reviews with our friends and co-workers. I substitute the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips and the walnuts with pecan pieces, also adding a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. My husband's co- workers beg him to have me bake this recipe for them! It's definitely a crowd pleaser! I agree, the layering is not necessary as long as you put a small layer of the batter without chip mixture in the bottom to keep the chips from settling to the bottom and sticking. Yumm!

Ummmm, this recipe was AWESOME. When reading the reviews prior to starting, 1 too many said they cut the sugar so I did the same and I think I could have even cut it a little more than I did. They (I made muffins instead) baked up beatiful, took 25 minutes, and were a hit. I did half plain and half with chocolate chips. What a treat! I love finding great, easy recipes that are worthy of passing on. I think everyone loves a good banana bread recipe and this is for sure one worthy of a star!!

Ok. they're out of the oven. And awesome. But a little sweet. I made the following adjustments & they still came out absolutely great... I will definitely make these again. I used 50%/50% white/whole wheat flour + 2tbs quick oats as I wanted these to be more on-the-go breakfast muffins I used 1/3 stick of butter, 1/3 light sour cream 1/3 berry applesauce. I also added 2 tablespoons of leftover chocolate ganache as I had this, and no chocolate chips. Muffin pan +25min = perfect.

they're not out of the oven yet... but 1c. of sugar seemed a bit much. I added 3/4 of a cup, and the batter tasted pretty sweet- more of a cake than bread. If you're trying this for the first time, don't be afraid to cut on the sugar

I made this several times, and everybody loves it. After following the recipe exactly the first time, I reduced chocolate chips and walnuts to half cup each, and added a bit of cinnamon, and for me it makes it even better. Sometimes I use half walnuts and half pecans too, and that works very well. A real treaT!

I made a few changes that really improved this bread. I added 2tsp. of cinnamon and 1tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the dry ingred. I used mini choc. chips instead of the larger ones. I used ¼ cup of butter and ¼ cup of non fat sour cream to lighten it up a bit. Also, I used 1/3 cup each of brown sugar and white sugar because the chips make this bread quite sweet enough to stand less sugar. Give it a try and enjoy. This is a delicious bread.

i JUST made it again... tripled the recipe and made 12 3x5 minis. Some chips sank to the bottom. Cooked it for 20-25 mins.

love this banana bread recipe as does everyone who tastes it. the lemon juice gives the banana flavor a boost and adds a nice depth rather than the standard cinnamon in other recipes. i skip the layering of the chocolate chips and just mix them right into the bread mix before popping in the oven.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of substituting a 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the white, omitting the lemon juice and using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. This was delicious....and I am not a huge fan of banana flavored items. I will try it with dark chocolate chips next time, just for something different. I recommend this recipe...it was quick, easy and delicious.

Even non-banana-bread-lovers enjoyed this (i.e. not too banana-y, and the chocolate chips cinched it). I used 2 bananas which was probably slightly more than 1C., omitted the lemon juice, added 1 tsp cinnamon according to another review, used 1C. white and 1/2 C. whole wheat flour (ran out of white!), and used milk choco chips and no nuts. 1 hr 5 min was perfect. I LOVED the buttery, crisp crust - yum!!!

Great recipe. Definetly a keeper. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was great. I agree with others that it is more like a cake so the second time I made it I doubled the recipe and put it in a bundt pan.

Great recipe! I left out the nuts and folded the chocolate chips into the batter. Oh, and I baked it in a glass pan because I didn't have a metal one, adn it required an extra 6 minutes of baking time. It's more of a cake than a bread, but that's not a bad thing in my book.

Due to constant presence of bananas in our weekly delivered organic box, am forced to try many banana breads. We like this one with the following changes: Halved the butter. Halved the sugar.

I found it worked much better to just stir the nuts and chips into the batter rather than interlayering them with the batter.

I made two mini loaves. There was enough filling for three minis, though you can fit only one layer of filling in a mini loaf pan (skipped the zig zaggy thing.)

Well, I've heard the good and the bad, mainly good about this recipe. I love banana bread and I absolutely loved this bread. I used 1/2 stick margarine instead of butter, 1/2 c. chips as well as walnuts, 3/4 c. sugar and maybe half the lemon juice plus eggbeaters instead of real eggs and it turned out beautiful! I used reg. semi sweet chips and the walnuts weren't exactly small, but nothing sunk to the bottom. It was layered beautifully. I did finish the layering with chips and walnuts though as an earlier writer suggested and that helped I'm sure. I may add a bit of buttermilk in the future to make it even more moist. Enjoy this and don't let the naysayers discourage you from trying it.

Very good. I wish I had listened to some of the reviewers who suggested cutting down the chocolate, as it is quite sweet. Everybody loves it, but I think it would be better with a few less chips. I DID chop up the chocolate chips a little, and I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I had 3 bananas and didn't measure but they were probably 1-1/2 cups. I also followed the suggestion to cover with foil for the first 40 minutes to ensure the middle cooked. Well, the middle did cook fine but the bread really didn't rise and I think the foil might have been the reason. Next time I think I'll try it without the foil. There will definitely be a next time.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious, when a few previous user suggestions are taken into account. I've made a list to make it easier: use 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 chocolate chips-- the bananas make the bread naturally sweet, so you don't need the extra sugar. Chop up your chips into smaller bits so they don't sink in the batter, and cover the pan with aluminum foil for the first forty minutes of bake time; this makes sure the bread cooks in the middle. If you let the bread sit overnight with a cloth covering it tastes better in the morning. I used chopped almonds in place of walnuts-- lovely!

I've tried this one twice to get the right combination - I was looking for something that was less suitable for dessert and better for breakfast or snacking. So I cut the chocolate chips completely and used sightly less than a full cup of sugar - I used half regular sugar, half brown sugar for a more complex flavor. I also added some cinammon. It turned out moist, delicious and not too sweet - and it's even better after it sits overnight.

My two cents: This was very good. A few changes; chopped up large chunks of sweet bakers chocolate and added it to the center of the bread (between batter) and on top of the bread, added three bananas (might add another one next time), and squeezed half a lemon into the batter. Great alternative to cake, still a sweet treat good for dessert or breakfast!

I will definitely make this again. The bread is very moist and delicious. I used little less than 1 c sugar to keep it from being too sweet. Immediately after roasting the walnuts, I stirred in 1 tablespoon of butter. After the nuts cooled, I stirred in the chocolate and then added the flour. Therefore, the chocolate and nuts didn't sink to the bottom. I chopped up a chocolate bar instread of the chips and this worked out well. My family loved this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Flavorful, and very easy to throw together. I would note that a non-stick pan is insufficient to keep the bread from sticking. I had buttered the non-stick pan, and lined the bottom and long sides with parchment, and the short ends stuck when I turned it out. Not complaining though - the ends were cook's treat, and they were delicious :-) Next time I will butter and flour as directed. Will definitely make this again...

I thought these were yummy, I couldn't find my loaf pan so I split the batter up into a big muffin tin. I did what another viewer suggested and used small chocolate chips and that made a big difference in them not sinking to the bottom. I also sprinkled remaining nut and chocolate chip mix on top before baking so that when serving it to company they could plainly see what kind of banana bread it was. Served it to my girlfriend Karen who is a big fan of sweets and she loved it!! Will make again! Remember the more ripe the banana the sweeter the bread!

Excellent Recipe. This is always a hit and has become a staple for me -- easy recipe and great way to make use of bananas that are getting too ripe. I would not bake it for the hour and 5 minutes -- no more than an hour and probably less -- I would start checking on it after 50 minutes to make sure it doesn't burn around the edges and get dried out. Thanks to the poster who recommended using smaller chocolate chips so they don't sink - I use chocolate chunks (I'm also a chocoholic), but always wonder why they end up on the bottom :-)

Overall a fantastic recipe! I took the other cook's advice to back for 40 min with foil, it then needed another 25 min without foil. I omitted the nuts because I'm a chocaholic. I put in 1 cup of choc chips. Everyone liked the bread, but said it had too much choc. Also, I would use mini choc chips next time because the regular size chips sunk to the bottom a bit so there were no dhips in the top quarter of the bread.

I have made this banana bread 2x already and it both times it hasn't survived the day. My boyfriend thiinks I can open a bakery and sell just this.

terrific recipe. I'm not normally a fan of bannana bread, there's just so much mediocre bannana bread out there & it's an overdone food choice. But with the chocolate chips, it adds a new twist & chocolate & bannanas are a perfect combination. I cut back on the sugar a bit. And make sure you avoid my mistake of putting the chocolate chips into the warm ingredients. If you do this, the chips because liquified & lose their chipness (which you don't want).

An extra yummy banana bread because of the chips. I chose to make a double batch because I had too many bananas turning brown. With 1/3 less sugar and only 1/2 the chips (I ran out) it was perfect. This would have received a 4 four rating but "beyond compare" sounds like it needs to be a freaky rave to get that status. I'd really give it 3 forks and 2 prongs (of a four prong fork).

This is the very best I made 2 loaves they came out perfect, moist, and very tasty. I am impressed, anyone viewing this recipe needs to try it - you'll like it.

This banana bread is fantastic! I have been searching for the perfect banana bread for a few years now and have finally found it! Everytime that I make this recipe it comes out perfect. It is so good that I'll make several batches of it at once and freeze the rest so that I have it on hand all the timee!

I make this banana bread recipe almost every week. I use mini chocolate chips which I think spread more evenly.

This was my first time making banana bread and I thought this was a great recipe! I added some creme fraiche which I think brought out the lemon flavor, as well as some cinammon. For my own personal taste, I think that the recipe calls for a bit too much chocolate (and I am a chocolate lover!)... so I would recommend maybe just a half a cup... a little less sugar would also not hurt. I had no problems with getting it to bake properly... it took about an hour and did not burn. I also recommend letting it sit over night before eating... it tasted better after it set. But for my first banana bread I was quite pleased, as were my friends!

Used pecans, 3/4 stick butter, 1/3 c. sour cream, 2 c. banana. Needed to bake for 20 extra minutes. Covered with foil for first 40 minutes and uncovered for 20 and found that outside was very brown and inside was still not finished. Covered with foil again and lowered heat to 335 until done. Still came out too crusty for and brown. Will cook at 335 for the entire time next time to avoid all that browning. Even with coating nuts and choc with flour and layering, most of chocolate sank to bottom. Need to remedy that and work on cooking time. Will try again. MUST HAVES: extra banana, foil for majority of cooking time.

I used 3 bananas and did not mash completely. Turned out great and very soft. I will try to use less butter next time (perhaps just 3/4 of a stick). Will definitely make this on a regular basis.

GREAT BANANA BREAD!! Definitely one of the better heathier version of banana bread! I followed the last person's advice and changed it up a bit. I used splena sugar sub and whole wheat flour and increased the bananas and added chocolate chips. The lemon juice did the trick and kept the Best for Bread whole wheat flour dense yet fluffy. Applesauce might not make it as moist...that's the only dilemma...

I'm a personal chef and when I got to a client's home today, I saw they had a bunch of very ripe bananas. I hadn't planned on that and didn't have my recipe (a knockout one using low-fat yogurt, olive oil and flax), so searched and made this one with the following changes: - use Best for Bread Whole Wheat (the lemon juice helps the batter stay light) - reduced butter to 3 oz - added 1/4 cup of ground flax meal (not seeds) - an extra 1/4 cup of mashed banana - no chocolate chips - no nuts (the bran in the whole wheat flour, plus the flax give it a nice nutty flavour) - took the suggestions of cooking covered for 40 minutes, then uncovered for 20 Beauty!

My boyfriend ate almost the whole loaf in one sitting. VERY tasty! I added an extra banana than it called for. The only thing i would recommend, is add more time. It took at least 20 extra minutes.

This bread was amazing!! I made a few changes to the recipe, I listened to the review by the Beverly Hills cook. I did not put in any sour cream but it still ended up moist. The last time i had made banana bread the middle did not cook. If you cover the bread with foil for the first 40 minutes it makes a difference. I did not use the nuts or the chocolate. It ended up fine without it. I also sprinkled sugar on the top adding to it's taste. I put in a little more than 1/4 a cup of sugar and about 1/4 a cup of brown. I also added a touch more lemon. It's my new favorite recipe and this is coming from someone who has made a lot of banana bread.

This recipe is just plain bad. I had to bake the bread 25 EXTRA minutes, and it still was underdone in the middle. (there's nothing wrong with my oven!!) It is way too sweet. When you add lemon juice to the batter it curdles the butter. There are good banana bread recipes out there - DO NOT MAKE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!

It's only banana bread but every time I make it I do something different with quantities, nuts, whatever. It's always great! Use whats on hand.

I loved this recipe! I made a few minor alterations...used organic whole wheat pastry flour, it has a lighter flakier texture than all purpose flour, used 3 very very ripe (I mean some ripe, black spotted) bananas! Instead of 1 cup sugar (c'mon!) I used 1/4 cup loosly packed golden brown sugar and a little less than 1/4 cup sugar. And when i was mixing the liquids I added two tablespoons non-fat sour cream. The rest of the recipe I followed religiously, made sure to toast walnuts and cool before mixing w/chips and flour. I used a vanilla bean paste instead of regular vanilla extract. The lemon juice is a genius ingredient, don't leave it out. For the first 45 minutes baking time I covered my loaf pan with foil (make two-three 1" slits with a knife to let steam out) , then removed the foil and baked the bread for 20 more minutes. When it was nicely done and the pick was clean, I turned it onto a rack and put it back in the oven at 325 for 10 minutes. This made a very buttery crispy brown crust, and the inside was perfectly deliciously moist and tasty. Wow. I ate more than half of it and I rarely enjoy my own cooking that enthusiastically...can't wait to make it again! I'm letting those bananas ripen as I type this...

Since we have a nut allergy in the family, we skipped the walnuts all together, and added a few extra chocolate chips. I used baker's chocolate chips, which are big and dark....it tasted amazing. Definitely didn't miss the walnuts!

I took several of the suggestions below and reduced the butter to 3/4 of a stick, the sugar to 3/4 cup, and chocolate chipes to 1/2 cup. I also covered the bread w/ aluminum foil for the first 40 minutes and then uncovered it for the rest of the time it took to bake (about 20 minutes in my oven). Delicious!

I loved it. Instead of making a bread I made muffins and layered the ingredients directly into the muffin tin. The only recipie modification I made was to add some extra banana. I took the advise of others and used mini chocolate chips and I didn't toast the walnuts (too lazy). My only mistake was to run the knife through batter after filling the tins. Where ever I ran the knife that part of the muffin did not rise. So they were a little funny looking but magicaly delicious! I will definately make them again and this time I won't mix them with the knife.

I took the advise of others and used only 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I placed foil loosely on top. With these modifications it turned out very well. Served it for a "Hunt Breakfast" for my group of girls before going out to tag/sample sales with Belini cocktails and chicken sausages and fruit this morning. What a hit.

Not a good banana bread at all. Cloyingly sweet and gooey/sticky inside with a dry overdone crust. There are far better recipes out there, so don't waste your time, effort and money on this one.

I have tried this recipe twice and it has failed both times. It is entirely too sweet and there is so much chocolate in it that the bread gets mushy and gooey. I had to bake it an extra half hour and it still wasn't cooked all the way through. I love to bake and I have never had a problem like this before. Definately not going to try this again.

Whoa. I love banana bread and I love chocolate, but I did not love this recipe. It was entirely too sweet--all I could taste was the cloying sweetness. I actually tossed the loaf in the bin after trying one piece. I NEVER do that. I was so excited for banana bread too...

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious! The first time I made this as written and had the dark crust problem. The second time around I covered it with tin foil for the first 40 minutes and it came out a much nicer golden brown color. I used a cup of toasted walnuts and next time will probably use even more - we love nuts!

Rating: 4
I've been using this recipe for years - very yummy! I think an hour is too long, though. If you are having problems with over-cooking, try reducing the oven temperature to 335...Bake for 40 minutes, cover with foil, then bake an additional 15-20 minutes. This yields a perfect loaf for me. My husband will eat the entire loaf in one sitting if not forcibly restrained.

I don't know why people are having trouble with the baking of this bread. I have a Thermadore and it cooked perfectly. I did however, cover with foil half way through and baked it for exactly 1 hour. Didn't use the chocolate chips but did toast pecans for the nut. We enjoyed it!

I've tried over 25 banana bread recipes in the past few months (much to the detriment of my family - my guinea pigs) and this is by far the best one. It IS sweet but that is what is so great about it, and if it is too sweet, then take out the chocolate chips. It is dense, moist, and full of flavor. You should definitely toast your walnuts for extra flavor.

Rating: 3
Very good banana bread, but I found the timing to be a little tricky. Mine went from raw in the middle to over-baked within a very short time span. Even over-baked and a little crispy on the exterior, the inside was still moist with a great banana flavor. Also, I baked two separate loaves, one in metal and one in glass, and found that the loaf in the metal pan browned more quickly and darker, but the loaf in the glass pan cooked in the middle more quickly. I will try this experiment again. Right now, I'm favoring the glass pan.

I'm from South Africa and possibly have a less sweet tooth than Americans, so I added 3/4 cup of finely chopped dried apricots to create a balance. This worked very well. Having read comments about it being too dark, I covered the top lightly with foil halfway through the baking. Worked for me. Mine cooked through in an hour. My companion really like it.

My bread also was raw in the middle and I cooked it an extra 20 minutes. The top was so brown and hard that it cleaned off the tester when I pulled it out so I thought it was done.

I've made this several times now and it's been great each time. I've used both regular and mini chocolate chips and I highly recommend mini chips for better distribution of chocolate flavor. My only complaint is the dark crust - I don't like that it gets so dark but that's my husband's favorite part. I only cook for about 45-50 minutes and it's perfect (except for dark crust). I like to keep my loaf in the refrigerator and eat it chilled for best flavor.

Delicious and probably the best I've ever had, but I also had a problem with the sinking chips (didn't use nuts) even though I foured them. I think I'll omit next time. The banana part is great on its own. I used a glass loaf dish instead of metal and noticed that the bread browed a really rich chocolate color even before the inside was done. Is there any particular reason to use a metal loaf pan instead?

The flavor of this banana bread is wonderful, and it is very moist. I floured the choc chips and followed the layering step, but still had a problem with sinking chips.

This makes a really delicious banana bread. I don't care for nuts so I omit them all together. What I've found easiest is to use mini chocolate chips and just stir them into the batter after it is mixed. This prevents the chips from sinking to the bottom because they are much smaller.

Delicious and quite simple to make. I didn't have unsalted butter so I used salted butter and put in a little less salt. I used toasted pecans since we prefer them instead of walnuts. I also put in slightly less than the three quarters of a cup of chocolate chips that the recipe called for. My 2 large ripe bananas made just a little less than 1 cup but the flavours were still wonderful all combined. Yummy to smell baking and yummy to eat.

Very simple and super quick to prepare. I throw this together in 5 minutes! I also like the recipe because it only requires 1 cup of mashed bananas (which is about 2 bananas) whereas others require 3-4 bananas. I usually end up with less than that at the end of the week.

Had pecans on hand instead of walnuts which was perfectly fine, forgot the lemon juice but maybe the fact that I substituted unsweetened applesauce for moisture instead of butter to lower fat and cholesterol content made up for it; I also used 1/2 cup of egg substitute instead of 2 eggs to reduce fat and cholesterol and replaced up to half of the flour in the batter with a whole wheat flour to increase fiber (it's so full of good stuff that no one noticed). It was absolutely delicious and is being requested again ASAP. We'll enjoy it often!

This is absolutely the best banana bread I have ever had. I have been using this recipe for several years, and it always gets rave reviews. It works well both with and without the chocolate chips (for those times when you want a more traditional banana bread). I also cut down the chips to 1/2 cup. Just make sure you toast the walnuts and don't bake the bread too long. I find that it works just as well if you mix the chips and the nuts in with the batter. The layering is an extra step that's not really needed.

I think using very ripe bananas is key -- since I had some black and gooey bananas I needed to use up I got to try a few variations. Try raisins instead of chocolate chips and add some cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, if you use only one egg and add 1/4 c cocoa to half the batter and pour the banana half over the cocoa half in a regular cake pan and bake for 25 minutes you get an AMAZINGLY moist and delicious cake.

Scrumptious! I used 1 1/2 cups VERY ripe banana puree plus an additional mashed ripe banana, omitted the walnuts (hate 'em)and added 3/4c mini chocolate chips.

I mixed the chips right in the batter (I didn't bother to flour them first)and experienced no sinking issues.

DISASTER! First I didn't let the toasted walnuts cool down enough before tossing them with the chips. So the chips melted and I ended up with a big globby mess. Also, I used a 9 X 5 X 2 1/2 loaf pan as directed and within 10 minutes of baking it was overflowing, causing quite a mess. I transferred it from the 9 X 5 pan to a bigger loaf pan at that time, which I'm afraid may have had a detrimental effect on the texture so I don't feel I can fairly review the final product. But just to warn others: let the nuts cool completely before tossing with chips and use a bigger loaf pan.

Yum! Best warm out of the oven, but if you eat it the next day, put a slice in the microwave and nuke for 10 sec. Much better when the choco chips are slightly melted... No idea how you can overcook this recipe. I had to cook it for an hour and 30 minutes because our crappy Magic Chef oven is weak. You're supposed to keep checking on it. I even screwed up by not greasing the pan and not zigzagging the chips and it still came out well :-) Update: the recipe can be used to make 3 mini-loaves which make great gifts if you're willing to give this yummy bread/desert out; the full-size loaf browns much better on top because it can cook longer though. Roughly 2.5 bananas is what's needed for the recipe.

Extremely moist. I'm not a nut fan, so increased the chocolate chips to 1 cup and it was fine. I'm going to try mini-chips next... had the same problem with chips sinking to the bottom. The cooking time was 1 hour.

This was my first quick bread as well - I made several on the same day and this came out the best. At my husbands suggestion I added some banana baby food to increase the banana flavor and it came out great. Next time I might use only baby food bananas. I must say that this is more like a desert than anything else - I might try a bundt pan next time like the reviewer below suggested.

Great bread/dessert. Had problems in the past with chips as others have indicated, but have found a solution! If you toast the nuts, and mix them with the chips as directed (with a tablespoon of flour mixture), the chocolate chips melt and coat the nuts thereby eliminating the density of the chips and the problem that we have all had making this. Also, toasting the walnuts (or my favorite, pecans) is not addressed. Under 500 degree broiler, toast for 2-3 minutes. They are perfect! Good luck!

Rating: 3
Nice recipe. Like others, I increased the amount of bananas. I also used half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate. Lastly, I baked the bread in a bundt pan, which made it more dessert-like. Everyone loved it and it looked beautiful as well.

This was a big hit in our house. I'm glad I only baked the bread for 50 minutes (thanks to the advice from others!). I didn't have walnuts in the house so I substituted pecans-a great plus. I agree with the other chef who suggested mini chocolate chips as my layers all sunk into one as well. We'll make this one again- Yummy!

NEEDS MORE BANANAS!!!! A lot of chocolate. Maybe next time I will decrease choc.

Rating: 3
I did not add any nuts but I doubled the banana ingredients as I had many very ripe bananas and ripe bananas are the key. I increased the flour by a tablespoon to compensate. I floured the chocolate chips but even though I added them in two layers they sunk to one layer and made a heck of a chocolate chunk level at the lower level. We have had it in the refrigerator for 6 days and is still yummy. I did not flour the pan, after buttering I used fine bread crumbs instead. Watch your oven and the pan as I agree with the other reviewers who said it was under an hour. Even with the extra bananas, I was under an hour. Would be interested to hear how one can avoid the chocolate chunk line, might have been even more interesting if the chips were spread throughout. Maybe mini chips?

I am a college student, and jumped at the opportunity to make this easy but yummy banana bread. I skipped the walnuts and added a few more chocolate chips, and it turned out great. I've made it several times so far and my roommates have eaten most of it before it even cooled!

We LOVE this recipe! My 4 year old son thinks that the chocolate chips in this bread make it the best banana bread ever. Every time I bring it to a bakesale or family event, someone asks for the recipe. We usually don't include the walnuts, as the kids don't really like them, but it still comes out great.

This bread is delicious. I did add about another half cup of banana as suggested by another reviewer. My family devoured the loaf in an evening and has already asked for more!

I made the bread with pecans and semi-sweet chocolate (chopped up into small pieces) and the result was excellent! I also used an extra half cup of bananas than was called for. The cake was therefore very moist and banana-y. Much praise from my husband...will definitely make it again and again!

This is as good a banana bread as any - maybe better than most. If you're not pleased with the taste of your banana breads, decide if you are using bananas that are ripe enough. Good banana bread bananas should look rotten. The peel should be dark brown and the banana very mushy. The only changes that I made to the recipe were that I doubled the salt, added a touch of cinnamon, and left out the vanilla because I didn't have any. Also, I used half AP flour and half whole wheat. It's healthier and very tasty. The whole weat probably adds some density. Also, I made mini-loaves (bake about 40 minutes) and preferred the ones where I didn't layer the chocolate chips but mixed them in throughout. Yes, the top does get dark but that is okay. It's definitely tasty and will be my staple banana bread recipe until someone recommends otherwise.

Rating: 4
This bread was divine. I used 'King Arthur %100 Whole Wheat Flour' as half of the flour combined with half all purpose flour - it was wonderful. I also used 1/8 C less sugar and almost doubled the amount of bananas, doubled the salt (since there was none in the butter) and used bitter sweet chocolate chips. My husband and kids whom are very picky eaters just raved!

Rating: 3
Good recipe: omitted the nuts, and used Toblerone chocolate bar instead of chocolate chips (they have bits of toffee in them). Also added cinammon and nutmeg to taste, and a bit more banana than the recipe called for (I like a strong banana taste). I didn't layer in the chocolate, I just mixed it all together with the batter and sprinkled some chocolate pieces over the top while baking... nice crust on the top because of it. Overall, good bread.

neccesity being the mother invention and all, i tried something different...i was out of chocolate chips (and what is banana bread with out chocolatey goodness?) so i put cocoa powder in half of the batter and baked it marble cake style. came out pretty good!

This was a great recipe! I substituted hazlenuts and added coconut to the chocolate chip mixture, making for a lighter filling. I had to cover the loaf pan with aluminum foil half-way through baking because it was getting a little too dark on top. The end product was nicely browned and consistently cooked - I will certainly make this again!

Rating: 4
TERRIFIC! I made this with only some slight changes--I used mini-chocolate chips (semi-sweet) and didn't have any problems with the chips settling into the bottom of the bread during baking. Also, I substituted pecans and added an extra banana. For dessert,I combined thick slices, topped with vanilla ice cream and homemade bitterweeet chocolate sauce, and my dinner guests actually swooned!! This is a double-thumbs up!

Rating: 3
I made this using the suggestions of 4 bananas, pecans instead of walnuts, 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips. I brought it into work and everyone loved it and has been asking me to make it again. Definitely not your typical banana bread it that is what you are looking for but it is delicious.

Rating: 3
Everyone loved this banana-bread, my son, friends, other mothers at my son's school. People wanted to know how i made this delicious bread. i did add one more banana than it asked for, and found that it was moister. also, since i didnt want my son bouncing off the walls, like he normally does after sweets, i substituted splenda for sugar (and some brown sugar). the first time, i burned the bread by leaving it in for an hour. the next time i took it out after 45-50 minutes, and it was perfect.

I made this with the help of my 2 and 4-year old. We all thought it was great. Having read the previous reviews I added a little extra baking powder and had no problems with it falling. We have also tried it using 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. This will definately become a staple in our house. Wonderful.

Rating: 2
This is really a chocolate chip cake with banana. While it has a good flavor, I was disappointed. The texture is light and caky, not dense like a typical banana bread. It is VERY sweet (I even cut down on the sugar). I also had problems with the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom, and I did flour them. That meant that I could not turn the loaf out of the pan without the bottom splitting off. I also think the recipe does not call for enough salt if you use unsalted butter as directed. The predominant flavors are chocolate, butter and sugar. While you can't really go wrong with that, you may be disappointed if you really want banana bread.

I will make this again with the following substitutions: 4 bananas, Milk Chocolate chips and pecans. I think the extra banana made it super moist.

I call this the Rise and Fall of Banana Bread, because while it's baking it looks like it's going to practically spill out of the pan, and then, all of a sudden, it's down to nothing. No big deal, still delish, moist and flavourful. I had to use a crushed Crunch bar since I had no morsels in the pantry, but it came out just divine.

Rating: 4
My coworkers thought this banana bread was the best they've ever tasted (and I've brought in many different recipes.) I left out the walnuts and coated the chocolate chips in flour and that seemed to prevent them from sinking to the bottom. It didn't seem to rise at all, but it turned out very good anyway.

What a great recipe. Turned out great albeit a little darker than I would have liked. Next time, I'll bake for 10 minutes or so less than what the recipe calls for. I layered the choc chips so they wouldn't fall to the bottom - that will work well if you have the reg (not mini) choc chips.

Rating: 3
This banana bread was very moist (compared to most). I mixed in mini-chocolate chips and left out the walnuts. About 10 minutes prior to it being done, I did notice it was getting pretty dark, so I layed a piece of tin foil over the top. The best chocolate chip banana bread recipe I have found yet. My husband thought there were too many chocolate chips (I thought it was perfect).

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe with only a few minor changes: first, mix in the chips and the nuts as others have recommended. My secret ingredient for banana bread? Crushed Pineapple. I used 4oz. here and increased the flour by 2 tablespoons, this gives your bread extra sweetness and moisture. You may need to prolong the time in the oven by 15 minutes or so, so that it's thoroughly cooked through. Everyone loved this at brunch! Delicious with a schmear of cream cheese. Yum.

Rating: 3
Nice twist on an old favourite. I heeded the words of other reviewers and mixed the chocolate chips (I used mini - worked great!) and walnuts in with the batter rather than trying to layer. Also, as I had 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" pans instead of 9 x 5, I used two pans and baked for about 35-40 minutes. No problem with the outside getting too done with this method. This is going in the "dessert breads for company" file.

This bread was yummy. I used mini chocolate chips and omitted the walnuts. Instead of the recommended amount of sugar I used 1/2 cup of regular sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. To finish I sprinkled brown sugar on top. I've made it several times. The loaf doesn't last very long!

Hmmmm.....I'm not real sure about this one. It has really good flavor, I added 1/2 teas cinnamon and stirred in the chips and nuts rather than layering. But it almost got too on the outside around edges and still a little not done in the center at 1 hour. I've made quite a few banana breads that were just as easy and turned out great the first time. Not sure I'll try this one again.

Good banana bread. I used 4 mashed bananas (had to use before they went in the garbage), and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and omitted the choc. chips.

Very moist. I used roughly 1 1/2 cups of bananas (because I had four old bananas sitting on the windowsill), omitted the nuts and chocolate, and baked in an 8 inch square pan (didn't have a loaf pan) for 40 minutes. It was by far the best banana bread I have ever tasted -- extremely moist, full of banana flavor and evenly cooked -- this will be my standard recipe going forward.

The moistest banana bread ever! Very rich and more-ish. Here were my changes: I used 1 C. all purpose flour and 1/2 C. whole wheat. I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and used 1/4 C. mini chocolate chips which I mixed in with the batter. No nuts. It baked 65 minutes, very dark exterior/interior and it didn't rise much but it is so rich and delicious, who cares what it looks like? Better the next day, too.

I liked this recipe pretty well but not near as much as the other reviewers. I followed the recipe exactly, putting the chocolate chips and walnuts in two layers in the middle. This created large pockets of melted chocolate in the loaf, highly concentrating the chocolate flavor and overpowering the banana. If I ever make it again - and I'm not sure I'll bother - I'd try mixing the chocolate chips into the batter in hopes of better dispersing them. The loaf was very moist and had nice texture, but the balance of flavors just didn't seem right.

I wanted to see for myself what all the raves were about so I made this bread. Personally I really did not care for it. I'm thinking that maybe the bananas were not ripe enough. It also was dry.

I have made this twice, once using white chocolate when I had no dark chocolate, and once following the recipe. Both times I couldn't get the bread out of the pan and left half of the bread in the pan, I believe this is because of the layering of chocolate. I will wait next time until the bread and chocolate has cooled. Much preferred the white chocolate over the dark, it gave it a milder flavor. Unfortunately I would only make this for family, since I haven't been successful with the removal from the pan....

Overall, this is one of the best Banana Bread recipes I've come along in a while. Everyone loved it and at Christmas time, this will be one of the goodies put in my gift baskets of baked goods. I would like to add however, that either the cooking time or the oven temperature needs to be adjusted. At 350 degrees, the bread was getting much to brown yet the center was not cooked yet. I ended up turning down the heat to 300 degrees and watching the bread very carefully so that it didn't burn on top before cooking through the middle! Maybe someone didn't get the oven temperature right when transfering this recipe?

Beware - based on the reviews I planned to bake for only 55 minutes, but found the loaf wasn't ready and needed at least the full 1 hour 5 minutes in my oven. I do agree that 1/2 cup of chocolate was more than enough although I personally would have enjoyed more nuts... to each her own! Compared to other banana bread recipes, I thought the texture - thin, crispy crust and soft, moist interior - was excellent, even the next day.

I LOVE this recipe but I made a couple of changes and that is why I did not give it a rating of 4 forks. 1) 1/2 C nuts and 1/2 C choc chips is enough.

I also mixed the nuts and chocolate chips in the batter and it turned out great. I only used about 1/4 cup of chips; glad I did. I think the whole amount would've made the bread too sweet. May also cut back on the nuts next time. I cooked it for 55 min, the crust was very dark but it was nice and moist inside. This is a great recipe, definitely a keeper.

Pretty good. Cut down sugar to 3/4 cup and used only 1/2 cup walnuts and choc chips each. Baked it only 50 min.(but this depends on your oven). Also found it better to beat butter and sugar together instead of first butter and then adding sugar bit by bit. And I just stirred the walnuts and choc chips into the batter instead of layering.

This was pretty easy to make. It has a moist, dense texture. I used about 1/3 cup of nuts and the recommended amount of chips and the bread was "full".

Don't through away your Betty Crocker Cookbook recipe because you're going to want to use it instead of this recipe. This loaf has a great flavor but: 1) it doesn't rise; 2) if you cooked it as long as the recipe calls for you'd have a burnt brick of banana bread; and 3) it has a very dark interior which is unatractive. It cooked so long that the chocolate chips had melted to nothing, they just bled into the surrounding loaf. It would have worked better if you mixed the nuts/chips thoroughly into the batter instead of the two layers. Also cut the cooking time to 50 minutes.

I have tried alot of banana bread recipes and this one is the best. It was easy to make and I loved that it was moist. I sent some to my daughter at college and her and her friends are begging for more!!!
