Hints: Tossing and coating: Use a plastic bag from the grocery store. Put all ingredients in bottom of bag, add potatoes, and shake to coat. Empty bag contents into 450 degree pre-heated hot pan and cook as instructed. Result: Even coating  much better than toss method. Rosemary  if using fresh, pre-strip stems, and add to oil mixture in plastic bag, and shake. Or use dried rosemary and add to oil, salt, garlic, pepper, and other bag ingredients. No noticible difference in taste.

This is a standard combination of ingredients for oven fries, so it's difficult to mess up, but I just wanted to chime in that dropping whole Rosemary sprigs on top of the potatoes removed a step that I used to employ (plucking Rosemary leaves from sprigs and sprinkling them over the potatoes). The oven temp crisps the leaves so that they fall off the stems easily and then naturally and evenly distribute with each potato flipping step. Only criticism of the process published is I might suggest spaying the non-stick pan with oil lightly before adding the potatoes, in case some of them are not coated from the toss.

I've been making oven fries for years with different blends of herbs, spices and garlic. Sometimes I keep it simple with just olive oil and sea salt. Turn this into an even simpler recipe by putting the potatoes on the baking sheet skin side down. Since the skin is a curved, not flat, surface, the potatoes don't burn before they're totally crispy. They don't need to be turned. Small quartered potatoes work nicely as do the spears described in the recipe.

This was simple and tasty. I did have a little problem with the garlic getting a bit too brown and crunchy.

Delicious! Just don't get too heavy-handed with the rosemary. Mine was so fresh and strong it almost overpowered my palette.

Did not have olive oil only veg oil and they turned out delish. Will make them again.

Great recipe! If you have to cook it at a different temperature because you've got something else in the over, it is not a problem.

My boyfriend makes these for breakfast when I've been a good girl. Served with eggs over-easy and a little sriracha it makes a killer breakfast. We tried the sweet potato route, but the texture is pretty mushy.

Turn these potatoes from good to great by substituting sweet potatoes! My favorite is to use red garnet yams.

I added Thyme and garlic powder to the fresh rosemary. Put cut up potatoes in a bowl cover with the mixture and toss with plastic wrap on top. Put on the baking sheet and roast. Turn every 10 minutes until done (about 45 minutes at 425.
