As stated above, it was never Christmas unless mom or grandma made struffoli. But they modified the recipe many decades ago (adding baking powder and sifted flour) so that the struffoli was softer when fried and the dough was easier to handle. Also, the honey they used was always orange blossom and they added orange zest not lemon. I always make it their way now. It is different than the traditional recipe but it is more popular with everyone. No Christmas goes by in my home now without this dessert.

Yes, I don't think some of you are familiar with this recipe or what it should turn out/taste like. I an Italian and have had these growning up. They are meant to be hard and crunchy. I love them, but they may not be for everyone.....

Oh, what did I do? This dough was so difficult to work with. They came out too dry, too dense, and too yucky. Shouldn't there be some sort of wet ingredients besides eggs? What about some type of fat? Are the eggs doing all of that work? I would not make this recipe again.

My grandmothers would make these and form them into a Christmas tree.

Ponch, are you familiar with struffoli? They are supposed to be crunchy.

I was very disappointed by this recipe. The finished product was hard and unpleasant - definitely NOT worth the effort! The entire batch was thrown away the next day.
