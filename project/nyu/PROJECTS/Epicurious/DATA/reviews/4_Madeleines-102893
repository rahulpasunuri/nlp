Loved these. I followed the recie as written except after reading the reviews I used Lemon Extract instead of vanilla. I did melt a little extra butter and brushed the madeleine pan with melted butter and then sifted flour over it. Madeleines release beautifully from the metal pan. Classic bump, beautiful lines, brown slightly on edges. My partner declared them "jumbolicious" as soon as he had one which I am sure means I will make these many more times.I took one batch out at 11 minutes and the other 1t 15 minutes. Both timings were good. The longer time just added a little more color. Oh and I got 24 out of the batter with absolutely no batter left in the bowl. I sifted the powdered sugar over them for a pretty effect. Not sure I would dip them in chocolate because it might overpower the delicate flavour. But think they will go well with the citrus chocolate dipped strawberries from this site.

Wonderful to eat and easy to make - what could be better than that? I have made these a couple of times - including once for my son's French preschool - always to rave reviews (even from the Parisians!). I never used the powder sugar and agree with previous reviewers that 16 minutes is too long. I usually just shave a minute or two off as i like prefer my madeleines slightly less brown. I also bump up the lemon just a tab. Wonderful. Enjoy!

Truly delicious. I have tried Madeleines with Earl Grey Tea, Jasmine Green tea and it looks all those flavors just ruined the taste of what the cookie needed to be. This recipe is great. I doubled the amount of lemon peel, as suggested by reviewers and it make the cookies come alive.

I've made these MANY times - they're very easy and always impress. Making the batter ahead and chilling it is a good option if you're going to be rushed the day you want to serve them. The recipe is terrific as is and can be adapted to your taste. My favorite variation is to use 8 T of butter instead of 10, substitute the zest of a small orange for the lemon zest and add 1/8 tsp. of cardamom.

[corrected version] A very lovely cake; I cut back the temperature and then still went pretty scant on the baking time as the first batch came out a little brown for my taste, even at only 15 minutes. I also found better results when I used a rounded TBS of batter as it filled the pans better.

This recipe was fast & easy to make, but it was only three-quarters of the way to tasting like an authentic madeleine. Even so, it was still delicious! I did not use any lemon, nor did I use a special pan. I used a 3x3 in. cupcake pan for 16 mins., and that was fine. I would recommend this recipe because it is absolutely delicious, even though it tastes only partly like a madeleine.

I've made this recipe several times. Once a taster said it was the best baked treat he'd ever had. I put the buttered & floured madeleine pan in the freezer before the first batch, which usually turned out prettier than the subsequent batches. I also added 1/8 tsp almond extract to the batter.

I made a Gluten Free Version. I simply substituted Pamela's baking mix for the flour 1 to 1. I also increased the grated lemon peel to 1 teaspoon since GF baking tends to need a little more flavor enhancement. I made 16, but had enough batter for 20. The guests had no idea these were wheat free. They tasted delicious. I served them with coffee and ice cream. It was a nice finish to the meal. This recipe was quick and easy to make.

I was disappointed by the texture and density. Also thought they were too lemony. They weren't nearly as light as madeleines should be. I didn't read any of the reviews beforehand so I will try again and incorporate some of the suggestions.

These cookies were delicious and SO easy to make! The lemon adds a really nice flavor but the baking time mentioned was a little long. I find 9 minutes in the oven gives them the perfect golden color with a little crispiness around the edges. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These are so EASY and DELICIOUS! Not quite like the ones from Costco or Starbucks (as those are the only ones I've ever had) but still really good. I've made these twice, once following the recipe directly and they come out great, slightly dense but still light. The second time I added 1/8 tsp of baking powder per another reviewer and beat longer than the recipe called for and they came out really light and fluffy. I used a non stick pan and spritzed lightly with some Pam and didn't have any issues with sticking. I only baked for 10 minutes and they were done.

Great recipe. I happen to like orange madeleines, so I substituted orange zest, and a lot of it - at least 1.5 tsp. of orange zest. I may dip the end in chocolate, I haven't decided that yet. They are so light and have a nice slightly crispy texture to them. I baked them at 13 minutes. I will serve them with my other goodies at book club tomorrow night.

Very good recipe-- except i would change the cooking time to 10-12 minutes. Also, I substituted almond extract for the lemon zest.

First time making madeleines here, with Costco's as my standard (they are really good). Admittedly, I don't know what a "real" one tastes like, but these were just okay. I'll keep searching... This recipe is very light, but do not have a great mouth feel. Also, the recipe's timing is definitely too long. Other recipes that say 8-10 minutes are correct. These would be overcooked and dry at 15. They did have the famous 'bump' tho!

Definetely wonderful outcome,but should not be cooked longer then 11 minutes.

I added 1 tsp of baking powder, and the result was a lighter version of a great thing. Also, I agree it needs more lemon zest and perhaps a squeeze of that same lemon. Make sure the batter is chilled before spooning it into the pan, or you'll taste the butter a little more around the edges.

good but definitely needs more lemon zest!

I was looking for a healthier recipe for Madeleines and was quite impressed with this one. The only thing I would change for next time is to double quantity of lemon zest and forget about the vanilla. I think the vanilla was overpowering the lemon in this recipe. Other than that, it was simply delicious.

After receiving a brand new madeleine pan, I was desperate for a good, solid recipe to test it out. This was it. The madeleines baked up beautifully and had a gorgeous light crumb and wonderful mouthfeel. Do not overbake! I pulled my madeleines out at 13 minutes and they were perfect, with delicately golden edges. The only substitution I made was replacing the lemon zest with orange zest,and the resulting flavour was wonderfully subtle. Increasing the amount of zest certainly would not wreck these babies.

I had searched for a recipe for Madeleines because they are my boyfriend's niece's favorite cookie, and I wanted to make them for her for Christmas. I've only ever had the pre-made variety, so that's all I have to compare them to, but I have to say they were quite good. I did without the powdered sugar, and I did remove them at about 13 minutes, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. And I have to say, they made the kitchen smell divine! I would definitely make them again.

My luck day. I had made these in 2000 and remembered how wonderful they were. Here is is 8yrs later found the recipe and the madeleines were as wonderful as I remembered. Followed the recipe exactly, however I added a bit more lemon. As another reviewer (could be my oven) mine were baked at 10 mins. Planning on serving these wonderful treats with strawberries dusted with cardamom sugar. Bu the way I only got 19 madeleines, I confess I ate a tablespoon of the batter. Yum!

I used a tinned steel pan which made beautiful golden brown Madeleines. After reading the reviews, I tried several variations. I melted a little extra butter and buttered the indentations in the pan with a pastry brush. Dusting with flour does, indeed, make them easier to remove and waiting 5 minutes before taking them out of the pan keeps them from looking mottled (if you take them out sooner, the butter/flour sticks to them). I didn't find that putting the pans in the freezer made a difference. I've had good results making the batter a day ahead (as some suggest) and good results using it immediately. Ive made them with 10 T butter and 8 T of butter and preferred the lighter ones. VERY easy to make and very enthusiastically received. Definitely worth investing in a tinned steel pan. (I bought mine on amazon for $12.)

These are wonderful! I loved them sooo much! What I highly recommend you do, is once you're done cooking them and they are somewhat cool, get some really good and expensive chocolate and melt it, dip half of the madaleine inside the chocolate, and then dip it in again, and then put it into the refridgerator and let the chocolate harden inside. Be sure to put plastic wrap over the cookies! Absolutely funomonal! I don't know if I just spelt that word right, but these cookies kick some serious ass!

Oh my!!! These are wonderful. Don't taste the batter or you'll eat it all. YUM! I added 1/8 tsp Almond Extract. Also, I baked the cookies in a decorative cookie tin instead of the traditional madeleine pan. Also, I decreased the cooking time to 9 minutes. When they were done, I dipped them in the batter. SO GOOD and So SINFUL!!!

I researched my books (considerable task) and this and 2 other cooking sites (including all the reviews!). This recipe seemed to make the most sense to me, so I gave it a try. I did make a few revisions: Doubled the recipe, and so used 18 Tblsp. butter, 4 extra large eggs, 1-1/3 c. sugar, 1 Tblsp. Orange Flower Water, 1-1/2 tsp. finely grated lime zest, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. baking powder, and 1 c. ea. cake and reg. unbleached white flour. The result was monumental! 12 minutes in steelpans, sprayed with canola one time and buttered AND sprayed the next- perfect 'hump', texture and incredible aftetaste that'll blow your mind! (Warning: DON'T taste the batter, or it'll never make it as far as the oven!!)

Rating: 4
I added 1/8 tsp baking powder and beat at each step longer then "just blended." I also substituted cake flour. I added 2X the lemon zest. Mine turned out PERFECT. They even have the characteristic "French hump" that indicates a perfect dough structure. I used 2 coats of melted butter in silcone baking pans prior to baking by placing in the freezer in between coats. This made for a crispy, light and brown edge. Proust would be proud.

Having read the other reviews and a general madeleine recipe in Joy of Cooking, I followed this one except that I used l cup of cake flour rather than regular flour and beat the batter until very light. Results were great -- even at 7000 feet!

Rating: 3
One more thing: in France, the batter is actuallly made the day before cooking if at all possible. And I know Proust says Madeleines should be dry and compared to most cakes I agree, but they should not be so dry that they cannot keep for a few days. Generally, these were the kind of cakes taken on long trips because they keep so well.

I have not made this recipe, but I am currently in cooking school in Paris and we made Madeleines pastry class. In France, the better the bakery, the higher the lump rising out of the top of the Madeleine. All thought the recipe photo does not show the lump side of the Madeleines, its really should be very large and exagerrated. The lump means the cakes have risen properly and should be light and fluffy. So, to the previous reviewer, in order to get a fluffier Madeleine add a little more baking powder, as French recipes I have seen use more (though they also use more butter and more eggs and generally tend to be larger to make the same amount of Madeleines) and really really work the dough to develop elasticity so that the dough will develop a structure as it bakes. This seems to have worked for previous reviewers as one noted that she beat the dough for longer than recommended and the cakes turned out reallly well. When I made them at school, the chef instructors kept telling us to keep beating to really develop the batter. We also really heavily buttered and floured our pans - and I mean heavily, which made a huge difference in the taste and keeps the madeleines moister for longer out of the oven. Ultimately, this may be a good recipe, but I agree with previous reviewers that its not a Madeleine if its not really fluffy and really buttery.

Rating: 3
Even if I would consider making this again, I would definitely change the recipe a little. I guess my disappointment was in the texture or dense-ness of this cookie. Any suggestions? Although I added 1/8 tsp of baking powder, the madeleins still came out a bit denser than the ones I've tasted from Starbucks. I originally used the orange flower/ blossom water (OBW) as suggested by some other reviewers (the french baking and cooking books that I have also calls for OBW), but I think the lemon zest gives it a more refreshing fragrance. Reducing the baking time to 13-14 minutes resulted in a less burned and a more golden color. I used the larger mold pans and this recipe yielded about 15 cookies. The non-stick pans are great, you can forego greasing/buttering the pan. That should reduce a little bit of calories that you can put into having another cookie instead!

I think I have to agree with the few dissenting voices about this recipe. They are good, but not buttery and light like the madeleines I've had in France. I checked out some other madeleine recipes, which use way less flour, and I think I'll try one of these next time. Also, I made half the batch per the recipe and half with a bit of orange blossom water. I think the ones with the orange blossom water were much better. It's not a strong orangey flavor, but a certain indescribable deliciousness. Also, next time, I'll try using fresh vanilla beans instead of the extract I make at home.

These madeleines are sinfully delicious. I'm not much of a baker, but I couldn't wait to try out my new madeleine pan, and my very first batch of these came out perfectly. My neighbors (as well as my building's handyman, who'd come by to fix a leaky faucet) were so impressed they all said I should try to sell them in local cafes. They're wonderful made with either orange or lemon juice. Arrange two of these on a small plate with a few fresh raspberries, a dusting of confectioner's sugar, and a drizzle of crème fraîche for a simple-but-elegant dessert that will make your guests beg for more.

I love this recipe, it's so simple and produces consistently good results. Sometimes I leave out the lemon and substitute vanilla bean paste for the extract. If I'm feeling industrious, I'll brush the molds with brown butter, which imparts a wonderful, subtle nutty flavor.

This recipe is way better than the one in my French cookbook. Absolutely delicious! I used a non-stick pan and there seemed to be no difference in the cookies if I just buttered the pan and didn't flour it. When I floured it, I found it more difficult to work the batter into the molds so flouring wasn't worth the trouble. I also sifted the flour into the mix. Not sure if it would have made a difference but the cookies turned out great. I used orangeflower water instead of lemon peel for a more traditional flavor. Baked for 13 minutes in convection oven.

I baked them for 13 min in bottom 1/3 of my non-convection oven. I used a non-stick pan, and the only difference between greased vs. non-greased was the edges of the madeleines are slightly crunchier if the pan is greased. These vanished in my house (even the overcooked ones).

I made these for the first time and they were fabulous. I added one teaspoon of baking powder as many other recipies suggest. I think they came out puffier than otherwise, which I liked. I also used nonstick pans which I liberally buttered and lightly floured. Since I baked both pans at the same time, I used a convection oven at 375 for 12 minutes. They came out perfect.

I haven't tried to make Madeleines with this particular recipe yet. However, I've been testing numerous other Madeleines recipes in the past and was never happy with one. Most of the recipes I'd tried, produced dry, hard, and tasteless cookies. I will try this recipe since I've read a number of good reviews about it - hopefully it will turn out to be soft, moist, buttery and not too sweet Madeleines.

I used a new silicone madeleine pan and didn't butter or grease it at all. They didn't slide but did come out fine with a bit of poking on the back side. Next time, I will try spray oil, but I would like to save the calories if I can. I checked after 10 minutes but really needed the full 16. Maybe my madeleines are bigger. One pan holds a dozen and I got 18 from the recipe. Next time, I will also put less batter in each indentation. They were yummy and went quickly.

I made this recipe few times and found the temp and baking time too high. I did a little research and if you have a dark pan, you need to lower the temp by 50 degrees and baking time to approx. 10 min. The time and degree for this recipe only works if you have the stainless steel pan. Once I figured it out, it came out perfectly everytime.

Rating: 3
Wow, this throws together so quickly and easily! After a little trial-n- error with my stainless steel madeleine pan, I found that spraying the pan with cooking spray made the cookies slide out with ease. I'd spray the pan then place a slightly rounded tablespoon of dough right in the center of the cookie mould. When the cookies were a little golden around the edges, I'd just slide them right out of the moulds. Then I'd wipe off the pan and spray again just before putting in a new batch of cookie dough. The cookies were golden and moist and a little crunchy around the edges. Proust would be so proud!

These madeleines are delicious! I used vegetable shortening but no flour to grease the molds. No sticking! Length of baking time depends on how much batter is put into the molds. Mine took 12 minutes. I got 15 cookies out of this batch. I did as one other cook did and used only one stick of butter. I used a little more lemon peel than called for because I love lemon. My results are delicious madeleines with a light lemony flavor!!

These were excellent! I made the cookies according to the instructions - except I did not flour the molds before putting in the batter (I did generously grease them though) and there were no problems with sticking at all, they slid right out. I only have one pan and was using it for several batches - if I floured AND greased it, the flour would clump up where the butter had pooled (the pan was warm from the oven) and my cookies looked a bit mottled (tasted good!), so I stopped flouring them and got great looking and great tasting cookies. If you like madeleines, this is a must have classic recipe.

This is a great recipe! I've made it 10 times in the past month. It's so easy and makes an elegant gift for friends. It stores perfectly in the freezer too...not need to defrost. It's tastety straight from the freezer too! OK...I think I figured out the baking time discrepancy. I have one non-stick pan and one stainless steel. When I bake them together in the same oven, the non-stick pan is ready in about 11-13 minutes. The stainless steel requires 16 minutes. Let me know if this holds true for you. Because of the different baking times, having two different types of pans is driving me crazy!

I give it another rave! Really VERY simple and very tasty. They expanded quite a bit, and I liked the smaller ones more, so take that into account. (I found out that buttering a nonstick pan with melted butter doesn't work, and you can't flour it, but if the butter hardens a bit after melting it doesn't bead up and you can go ahead as directed.) Give this recipe a try.

Made these for the holidays for the first time and I love them! The recipe is quite easy (although I'll probably double it next time) and the result is delicious.

Easy to make and very tasty. Only needed 10 minutes in the oven and I recommend at least checking yours at 10 - unless your oven is out of whack 16 minutes is far too long. Will make them again as written but also looking forward to making them with orange zest, almonds and chocolate.

Everyone I gave these madeleines to loved them so much that I'm afraid to share the recipe with them, lest they find out how easy they were to make! I made them twice in one week, with little effort. Instead of lemon zest I opted for almond extract (about 1/2 tsp), but next time I think I'll try orange zest. I am also looking for a madeleine mold. I couldn't find one in time for my two batches, so I used tartlet molds instead. Worked perfectly fine, but returned a bigger size (due to size of mold) -- which is not a bad thing considering how good these turned out!

On a whim, I decided to give my new madeleine pan which I got for Christmas a test-drive tonight. It was absolutely delicious and I made instant madeleine fans of my roommates, who have never had it before! I've got one of those non-stick pans, and had to lower the temp to 350 to prevent overbrowning (which was what happened to my first pan of madeleines. It gave it a crunchier, although less attractive outside, and the inside was not affected adversely). I sprayed the pan with Baker's Joy(tm). I was wondering if this was necessary with a non-stick pan. And has anyone tried doubling this recipe? I'll be making this often.

They only offer the regular size Madeleine mold, but I found the minature at a cookware/hardware store in Houston called Berrings. The miniatures took 14 minutes. They turned out great.

Absolutely scrumptious and delicious. I make a batch every week so that we can have madeleines for breakfast every morning. they are a great treat to look forward to. Easy to make, and their light, soft and fresh taste just keeps forming new memories every day.

I have tried many recipes for Madeleines searching for even an adequate one. I was about to revert to store-bought until I tried this recipe. It's GREAT! Made 2 batches and brought to a party where everyone (including some tough critics)raved. I followed the recipe and instructions to the letter - including the baking time - and it was all quite easy and accurate. No need for further searching - use this recipe!

In my experience, it was essential to grease and flour the madeleine pans to insure that the cookies browned evenly, came out of the pans easily without sticking and breaking and were well-formed. The baking time is also correct.

I wanted to challenge myself this Easter for a new recipe...but with not much time, I tried this one! Sent them off-straight out of the oven-lightly covered with the sugar, and they were a hit with friends and family...didn't even use a tray...just a cookie sheet spread wide apart(because they spread). Will make again and again!

I just want to add a note as the reviewer before me disagreed with the cooking time, amount, etc. I, however, did bake them in the middle of my oven for @15minutes and put @one tablespoon batter in each mold, and they turned out great. Maybe she/he needs to readjust their oven?

The recipe is not very precise. It should be baked in the lower third of the oven, which wasn't specified. And it's enough to spray the pan with an oil spray, no need for the flour(if a non stick pan is used). A whole tablespoon is too much batter for one mold,(the larger mold)--one teaspoon is enough,or even less. The time is too much as well,10 min is plenty or untill edges are slightly golden. The cakes came out too dry and not very fluffy. But its edible.
