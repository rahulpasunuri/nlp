This pie turned out very well, despite a freak out at the beginning. The filling was very soupy (and I only added 1 cup of whipping cream). It is not a sweet pie per say, but the flavors go together well.

I have to agree with another reviewer. This pie was not very good. The crust is great and easy to work with and I will keep it handy for future use.

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I have a friend that hates pies and she loved it. I loved the crust, it was very easy to work with and delicious.

What a disappointment! Low on pumpkin flavor and strange mouth feel due to the random crunchy toffee bits. Thanksgiving night we all felt kind of cheated, so we baked a traditional pumpkin pie.
