Loved this! The combo of mushrooms are nice and makes for a filling slice. Also prepared some muffin size crustless quiches with left over filling.

Very tasty quiche and was a hit for my dinner party. Followed recipe except for the following alterations: 1. As another reviewer recommended, used Mark Bittman's savory pie crust recipe-- yum. 2. Added one garlic clove (pressed) with shallots 3. Added chopped fresh basil to the mixture pre-baking. Served quiche with a spinach-pear-walnut salad and it fit perfectly.

One of the best and easiest quiches I've ever made! It's all about the ingredients. I used my friend's chicken's gorgeously fresh eggs, Fontal cheese plus a little Parmesan, and a combination of oyster, shiitake, and baby bella mushrooms. I also used a premade spelt crust. 45 minutes in the oven was just the right amount of time.

I made this for my family Christmas morning. It was exceptional. Easy to make, especially with prepping the mushrooms (I used a combination of crimini and oyster) the night before). I agree with the previous post about the crust having a tendency to get overdone. Mine didn't burn, but got a little brown. It was still excellent, however, as the liquid from the filling more than compensated for a crust which I would have thought would be too dry. Great for company or even a mid-week dinner.

I made this for a luncheon I hosted for a vegetarian friend. The last time I had quiche of any kind I didn't particularly like it (too heavy! -- soggy crust!) but everyone -- meatatarians included -- thought this one was terrific. One comment: bake the single pie crust shell according to package directions (prick with a fork the bottom and sides, too) which in my case was more like 11-13 minutes; I burned the first one when I kept it in for 17 minutes. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! Only changes were as follows... 2 med shallots (only bought 3 and one was bad), 3/4 C half and half, 1/4 C skim milk, no nutmeg, sautéed the shallots and mushrooms in a splash of white wine then let the excess liquid cook off a bit. The flavor was amazing! Definitely will make again for dinner parties and to take to family functions.

I've made this quiche many times and its always a huge success! I love to use at least a cup of oyster mushrooms because of their unique flavor and then typically use shittake, crimini, baby bella, or other brown mushrooms. I also add a little extra black pepper and nutmeg--yum! I used a pre-made crust (Pilsbury or Trader Joe's). I flour it, place it in the dish, and then let that sit in the fridge until I'm ready to pour the filling in and bake it all together. Keeping it cool keeps it firm and keeps it from getting soggy--I didn't find it necessary to bake it separately before-hand.

4 forks for versatility! I skipped the crust, used skim milk for both the half and half and whole milk, and used 1/2 a cup of Parmesan instead of the Fontina (I had some already shredded). Everyone enjoyed it. Next time I'll use olive oil instead of the butter and some basil/oregano instead of the nutmeg.

This recipe makes a great quiche, and with some small changes, makes an absolutely wonderful meal. I decided to make my own crust as store-bought never seem to cut it for me. With Mark Bitman's savory tart crust rolled out and pre-baked in my tart pan, I set about tweaking the recipe slightly to get it where I wanted: I used a blend of fontina, parmesan and gouda cheeses, about two cups fewer mushrooms (tarts are not nearly as deep as refrigerated pie crusts), and used low-fat milk in place of the whole (as that's what I had on hand). Make sure to include an exotic blend of mushrooms as opposed to just button or baby bella -- it really does make a huge difference. Overall, I loved the simplicity of this. And because a true, buttery and flaky crust is so integral to an authentic quiche, Bitman's crust recipe (which doesn't take more than a couple pulses in the food processor and 30 minutes of waiting for it to chill) really sent this dish right over the edge.

This quiche was easy and had wonderful flavor. I made it as written with the exception of using 1% milk instead of whole, and swiss for half of the cheese. I made it in 9" cake pans, and doubled it to make two. It filled to the absolute top, but did not go over. It was done well before the time alotted, so next time I might lower the heat in the oven and cook the full time. I will definitely make this again, but will add at least one more egg, as it was really heavy on the mushrooms- which I like, but it just needs a bit more balance to be really quiche-like.

Oh, and I added spinach, no nutmeg, and used Shitake and Portabellas.

I am not a cook. I can barely try to act like a cook. This recipe was so simple, so fast, that I actually looked like I knew what I was doing in the kitchen. I cut the Fontina into large chunks and that was so great in the eating process. I think I used too many mushrooms as well becasue I had enough for 2 (!!!) quiches. I did not complain though because my co-workers, friends, and family could not get enough. If only I could do that with things like Toast.

I love mushrooms, so I was thrilled to give this a try for a brunch with girlfriends. Our local grocery limited the reciped a bit, since I could only find crimini and button mushororms and there was no fontina to be found (I susbstituted an aged cheddar.) The quiche was simple to make and so tasty. I thought that the proportion of mushrooms to eggs was nice, as the quiches that are more egg than anything else are not my favorite. Next time I may use a little less nutmeg since the flavor was very prominent. I also think it would be delicious with fresh basil instead of the nutmeg. All my guests enjoyed it and I'm glad there are a few slices left to share with my family. Definitely a recipe I'll make again as I want to taste the difference in using fontina.

Delicious. I've only tried this recipe once, with the following modifications: Mushrooms- Shitake, Oyster, Cremini cooked as directed but deglazed the pan with some Sherry for added flavor. Used Swiss Cheese and reduced fat Kerry Gold Sharp White Cheddar (what I had on hand) Fresh, blanched asparagus Store-bought crust (next time, I'll make my own). I substituted Fat Free Fage Greek Yogurt for the 1/2 and 1/2 and egg whites for two of the eggs. The result was rich in flavor, but I suspect lighter in the belly with my lower fat substitutions. It goes great with a Sauv Blanc too! Very nice dinner

i was missing ingredients so i substituted some onions/garlic for the mushrooms. sauteed them with sundried tomato, fresh basil, and a dash of white wine. i also used white cheddar, swiss, parmesan, and fresh mozzerella, all thinly sliced in layers (parm and mozz on top to get bubblyyy). also didn't have milk so used vodka sauce that was in the fridge. this exited the oven so bangin!!

Easy and good but could use more seasoning-maybe more shallots and nutmeg

I only had extra sharp cheddar on hand, and added a little leftover ham, too. I feel kind of silly changing the recipe then rating and reviewing it, but I always appreciate cooks who review and tell how they modified and whether it worked, so I do it, too. My modification was yummy. Next time I'll try it with lower fat milk. Whoever pegged it as "low cal" in dietary considerations lives in a dream world, and I wish I lived there too.

Tried this recipe twice - first time with fontina cheese and then the next time making it I substituted fontina with gruyere cheese. The original recipe with fontina was good but not something I would make again. Using gruyere really gave more depth to the flavour of the quiche. I would definitely make this recipe again only with gruyere.

best quiche a ever made!

WOW that was AMAZING. I used a homemade crust, Italian Fontina, and a mix of chanterelle, shiitake, and crimini mushooms. The result was an explosion of rich, earthy tastes. Went perfect with a green salad, warm baguette and and a Cali Chardonnay. My brain is exploding with reward signal as I write this..

This is a great and easy recipe for quiche. It's become a favorite for brunches, including when we have company over. You can use different vegetables as well (we did brocoli another time and that worked well too).

This was the first quiche I've ever made but it is a very easy recipe as well as quick to make. I only used button mushrooms but added chopped spinach, bacon & more shallots. It made alot of filling;it spilled over a bit on to the baking sheet under the pie dish in the oven while cooking. I had anticipated this would spill over so I halved the filling and mushrooms/spinach/bacon mix and made two quiches. Absolutely delicious and I was impressed it came out so well.

Rating: 4
Yeah, this is great as is or as a base recipe to add other ingredients to. I added asparagus and used gruyere instead of fontina because the fontina I could get was very mild. Anyway, it was delicious and very easy to make. It's better than a lot of quiches I've had and no worse than the best of them.

Rating: 4
Really delicious! I used shiitake and cremini mushrooms, and then a mixture of fontina and gruyere cheese. The filling had perfect consistency and flavor. I also made my own crust, but I'm sure it's great with store-bought crust as well.

Really tasty quiche. Added a bit of old cheddar and used 2% milk, but otherwise made just as is. Great for brunch.

Rating: 4
Definitely delicious but I did wander a little from the original recipe. I added 200g of bacon to add a little more flavor. The only mushrooms I could find at my local grocery store were button mushrooms, but even with the one type of mushroom it was wonderful. I live in France where they don't carry half and half so I substituted it for a heavier cream and then used low-fat milk in place of whole milk.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I bought a Marie Callendars deep dish pie crust, & did not need to pre-bake it. I reduced the recipe to 3 eggs, and the liquid to 2/3 cup of whole milk -this way, it all fits into the pie crust. This is a great base recipe from which you can make many different versions! I have used broccoli, salmon, and/or asparagus depending on what I have in the refrigerator.

I made this quiche for a baby shower today, and with the blend of wild mushrooms and the flavor of nutmeg, I found it to be delicious and complex...anything but boring to my taste. I was a bit concerned that the mushrooms wouldn't be flavorful enough to compensate for lack of meat, but I was delighted with the taste and texture. To each his own, I suppose. Incidentally, I used a dehydrated blend of porcini, morels, brazilian, ivory portabellas, shiitake and oyster mushrooms from my local big box store, reconstituted according to package instructions before sauteeing with butter and shallots. Everyone loved it, and we had no leftovers!

Rating: 2
This is a very boring quiche. Fontina is a very mild cheese...mushrooms didn't add tremendously to the flavors. The quiche wasn't as solid as I would expect from a quiche. As is I wouldn't make this again. If you plan on trying this substitute h/h for heavy cream and add another sharper cheese. I would also consider adding prusciutto...it definitely needs a meat.

Really delicious! A crowd-pleaser and not hard to make.

Yummy! Used low-fat milk instead of the half and half/whole milk recipe called for. Turned out fine with this substitution. Used gouda instead of fontina since that's what I had and it was wonderful. Used a combination of cremini, button, and shitake. Crust browned very quickly, will cover with foil at the very beginning next time.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic!! I used foil and dry beans (as pie weights) to keep the crust shape as it cooked. Mushrooms were button, cremini and shitake, which I sliced into fat slices rather than only cutting in half. Served with the Mixed Greens, Orange and Endive salad from this site. My husband was thrilled and as a side benefit, my house smelled wonderful. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Rating: 3
Very good and fairly easy. Used frozen pie crust and did not pre-bake it. Turned out fine. Mostly used button and crimini mushrooms. Added about 2/3 cups dried porcini and oyster mushrooms. They were expensive and I'm not sure how much difference that made to the flavor. Seemed like the shallots and fontina may add enough goodness without the fancy shrooms.

Rating: 3
I used sliced portabellas and it muddied the color. They turned the quiche a little gray. Next time I'll use chanterelles, shiitakes, and other light colored mushrooms. Its a solid enough recipe that its worth tweaking the mushroom combination in order to get it just right.

I made this for dinner tonight -- yum! I used a frozen pie crust from Trader Joes, and cremini, chanterelle and oyster mushrooms. I baked the pie crust for 15 min (use crust saver/foil to avoid burning) and the quiche for 50 min. Great comfort food!

I quadrupled this recipe, but used 14 eggs, not 16. I used 1/4 oyster, 1/4 shiitake, 1/4 cremini, and 1/4 button. It turned out delicious; I made about 35 mini quiches, placing the mushrooms and cheese in the crust before pouring the filling in. They were adorable, and turned out wonderfully. Sadly, I only got to have a bite, but I can't wait to make this for my family.:)

My fillings ended up being enough for two 9 inch pies. I used baby portabellas and fresh shitake, which turned out good. Sliced in the food processor saved time, cooking time was just under 1 1/5 hours. very easy, foolproof recipe.

I made this for a brunch party after reading all the rave reviews and it was a big hit with our friends. I blind baked the crust with parchment paper filled with rice, but wish I had covered the edge better as it browned more than I had wanted. I ended up covering the edge with foil before baking a second time to avoid burning. Next time, I will probably brush the crust with an egg wash as one user suggested. Still though, everyone loved the dish and I will definitely make it again.

Mine also took quite a bit longer than 45 minutes to bake. I used a mix of goat gouda and fontina, and mixed fresh mushrooms with reconstituted dried shitakes. So tasty!

This was delicious. I followed the ingredients exactly, using crimini mushrooms. However, the quiche took about an hour and a half to bake, as opposed to the stated 45 minutes in the directions. Good thing all my guests were still hungry!

Excellent. Followed directions exactly except I couldn't find Fontina so used another mild Italian grating cheese - Brigante.

This recipe was wonderful and a breeze to make. I made a small change to incorporate some fresh baby spinach I had on hand. I cut the mushrooms to about three cups and after I sauted the shallots and the mushrooms, I tossed in a few cups of the spinach and sauted it down a bit - just enough to wilt it. I made the quiche the night before and reheated it from brunch the next day. Raves from all!

To ACook: yes you can do this without crust. It will turn out like a custard. It won't serve like the picture, but it will be tasty nonetheless. I told my schroomer sister I would make this for our trip to the Oregon Coast. She was appalled that I was mixing wild mushrooms. So I made this with these changes: 1) Chantarelles only; 2) reduce nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon; 3) 1 cup half 'n' half; 4) about 1 Tbsp fresh marjoram, finely chopped; and 5) reduce cheese (I used danish fontina-couldn't find italian, but italian crucciolo would be good too although a little more assertive than fontina). Everything else exactly the same. WOW!!! I can see why my Sis would recommend using only one wild mushroom variety in this dish. The chantarelles, very lightly seasoned, were completely, overwhelmingly delicious. Neither one of us could figure out why this would be tagged as a low-calorie dish. Leave out the crust and switch to whole milk and the reduced amount of cheese and you might, in a stretch, call it low-calorie. We decided that it's much better to forget the calorie/fat thing and immensely enjoy this treat. P.S. there were leftovers (only 2 of us for heaven's sake) which my daughter polished off in fine style. WE will definitely be making this soon and often!!! I'm off to the kitchen to prepare packets of chantarelles for future quiches!

FANTASTIC!!! But, don't follow the crust instructions. Instead, blind bake it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights and prick the bottom all over with a fork. Put back in the oven for another 3-4 minutes until golden. Remove. Brush crust lightly with a beaten egg white. Add filling. I use a 10 inch quiche pan (not deep dish) It overflows the crust some, but it really doesn't matter. It still comes out great and you use all the filling.

Great quiche. My family loved it, they were fighting for last piece, no leftovers. I made it with portabella mushrooms that I had on hand. Ill be definitely making this quiche again. Make sure to use weights /beans when baking crust.

ADDENDUM: I did not have any overflow of mushrooms, even with my adding the sausage. Perhaps other bakers did not use deep dish pans or did not saute the mushrooms long enough?

This was so good......especially since I made major changes, one of which was unintenional, the other a major.....DUH! And my husband, who is not crazy about mushrooms or quiche surprisingly liked this a lot. I used a combo of shitake, oyster, & crimini mushrooms. However, I did add some diced up pork sausage links I had browned in the morning....meat is the way to my man's heart. Then, I unintentionally used Emental cheese instead of Fontina (I guess I"m used to using it or Gruyere in quiche. However,evem with those two changes, it was very good, very easy, & pretty quick. I liked the aspect of parbaking the crust....it kept the bottom nice and crisp. My husband liked it so much that aside from having seconds, he ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. I would prefer it without the sausage, but since the sausage was not highly seasoned, it was a good addition. Will definately make again.....the directed way.

I never made a quiche before yesterday and this recipe. I was surprized it didn't take many chantrelles to make 5 cups, either. La la, I followed the recipe and the kitchen began to smell yummy and savory and like recipe success. I took my quiche to a friends house and it was the center of our mini-dinner party. Once it warmed up again, it was devoured faster than the wine was drunk. There was no 'one slice is enough for me,' which is more quiche-normal I thought. I got handshakes... over a quiche! I emailed the recipe to three people already, and plan to make it again in the next few days while I still have half and half in the fridge.

Delicious combination of flavors. As previous review stated, there is about a cup of filing left over if you use a frozen prepared pie crust. I think next time I make this I will make my own pie crust and use a deep pie plate. Went really well with a white wine and mixed green salad.

This gets 4 forks because the effort to taste ratio is high. I made the recipe exactly as directed, except I used a frozen pie crust I had on hand. Warning to those who might make the same adjustment: there was at least a cup of filling left over.
