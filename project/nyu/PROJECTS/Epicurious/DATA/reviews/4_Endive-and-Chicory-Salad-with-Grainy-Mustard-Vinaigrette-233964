use this dressing for any salad, it is excellent

This dressing is terrific, I agree with everything said by the other reviewers. It's easy to make but here are two ways to make it even easier. First, take a little more garlic than the recipe calls for and mash the cloves in a garlic press instead of mincing them up; second, use a cruet with a top to dump the ingredients in and then just shake them up rather than doing all the whisking.

I used arugula and lettuce because I didn't have endives or chicory on hand, and it tasted great. I added toasted sesame seeds to bring in some nutty flavor and topped it with Parmesan cheese.

This salad dressing was delicious! I had a dinner party and served it to 15 people and had to make extra dressing because people loved it so much!

I agree with the other reviewers - this salad dressing is the best! It really goes with any green salad, but pairs especially well with salads containing greens, fruit (pears, plums, apricots), nuts (pinenuts, walnuts), and a hard cheese (Parmesan, Asiago). I've been making variations on this salad all summer and each time I think it's the best yet.

The mustard vinaigrette is a really nice dressing. I used arugula because I couldn't find curly endive.

I haven't made this with endive, but the dressing is so good that I make it every week!
