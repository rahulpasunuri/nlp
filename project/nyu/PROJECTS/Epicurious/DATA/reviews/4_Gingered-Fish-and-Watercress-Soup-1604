WOW! This is definitely going onto my go-to recipes list. I made a few modifications; I couldn't get my hands on watercress, but spinach did just fine with a liberal sprinkling (or four) of white pepper. Also, I used fish sauce rather than clam juice. I used dried porcini mushrooms. I never understood why anyone would throw away mushroom stems, and I never understood why anyone would need to peel ginger, so I did neither. I used rainbow trout, which even on day two of leftovers retained its robust, meaty texture. Not just yum, but YUM.

Divine! In fact three of us finished the whole pot in one sitting. Some enhancements I made ... used mixed dried shrooms instead of just black or shiitake, plus added about a cup of fresh shiitake and baby portobellos. More green onion, garlic, and ginger. Added about a cup of sliced asparagus. Doubled the fish and used both sole and catfish. ... I ended up making it again the next day when a cold set in and swapped out the fish for chicken, plus added some carrot and celery. Delicious and nourishing.

This is a great easy soup. You can easily do it on a weeknight or even serve to guest on a weekend. I didn't use mushrooms because I didn't have them and I also pureed the watercress in the soup before adding fish. I can't imagine having it any other way. Also, I subbed Asian fish sauce for clam juice. Again, it's what I had. Only used a half teaspoon of that. I also amped up the ginger a bit because I Looove ginger.

Very very fast and easy, yet the broth is pretty nuanced and tasty. I usually make it with a little more fish to be a main course and I also recommend reducing the watercress to two bunches (and I considermyself a watercress fan).

This soup tasted absolutely fantastic! I'm chinese and I was very impressed with the taste of this soup and it was very easy to make! By the way if you can't find Catfish, "Orange Roughy" works just as well, maybe even better.

I thought this soup was delicious. After a few meals of chicken beef and pork its deliciously light! My family loved it. Too much watercrest however will make the broth too bitter!

My husband really likes this soup. I've made it a few times for him and he's always very pleased.

I approached this dish wondering what it would turn out to be. I was surprised. It was very good. It was well received by the "fish-eaters" in my family and one of my sons ranked it among his favorites. I doubled the recipe, used only 4 bunches of watercress (they were big and that was plenty). I used a cup of clam juice but pretty well stuck with the other proportions.
