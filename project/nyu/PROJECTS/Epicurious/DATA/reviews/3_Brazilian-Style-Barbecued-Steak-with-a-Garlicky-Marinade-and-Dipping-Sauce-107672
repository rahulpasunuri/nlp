We like spicy food but found the chimichurri Rojo overpowering. I cut back on the hot paprika to 1 T. and cut the cayenne to 1/2 T.

An interesting change from the usual steak. The chimichurri sauce was a great marinade. Some might find it quite hot--not us.

Instead of Beef, I used Kangaroo Steaks (rump)which were delicious. Kangaroo has a strong taste like Venison so the marinade sofened this. Our guests (who like spicey food) raved about them. - Go Wallabies!!!!!
