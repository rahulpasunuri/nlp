I like the idea of using butter -- I should have read the reviews before making. It turned out fine with sugar and water. I took it to a party, where it didn't seem to go over well, though. I will try again!

Not sure why others had problems with the water in the recipe. It worked perfectly for me. Maybe it should be called pumpkin seed brittle rather than pumpkin seed praline. By the way, non-stick foil made this a breeze to prepare. No oil, no mess.

The idea that adding water to a praline recipe is going to make anything more than a mess is laughable. I agree that the idea behind this recipe is wonderful, but it just doesn't work. My sugestion is to replace the water with about 2 tbl. of butter and 1 tsp. vanilla. This way the sugar carmelizes nicely and your pralines have a wonderful creamy texture.

Why add water at all? Most praline recipes use none and I've never had a problem getting caramel from just plain sugar. Don't understand why anyone adds water, except perhaps because some people would end up melting their cheap cookware. Don't attempt plain caramel in a cheap pan, make sure you use a heavy one. I just stir the sugar in the pan until it starts to melt, then leave it alone until it's the color I want. No secret to it, it's super-simple. Don't add ANY water at all.

Great concept but the recipe does not work as written. Follow the advice of others and use less water or another basic recipe. The flan and praline have been big hits the 3-4 times I've made them but the praline method needs adjusting.

Add me to the list of sugar coated seeds. I let the sugar and water reduce WAY longer than suggested (over an hour) and still only had clear liquid. Use another praline recipe and substitute the pumkin seeds. The flan recipe that goes with this praline came out beautifully (amazingly, my first) but also took longer than described.

Pumpkin seed praline is a great idea, it's just this recipe that doesn't work (at least not for me and a few of the other reviewers). There is too much water. I actually compared this recipe to other praline recipes and noticed that they called for much less water. All I got was sugar covered pumpkin seeds.

I've just finished struggling with the praline making which is always my downfall. It took an inordinate amount of time to color and then never was more than a pale beige when it cooled. I will try it again but would like to take caramelization 101 before I do. It's a wonderful idea and obviously someone else has been successful with it. I have successfully created sugared pepitas!

I think this would work out great. I made the flan. But I tried to make 1.5 times the recipe and my carmel wouldn't set. I just got sugar water. I am sure I did something silly wrong. I will try it again without the water.

This brittle is an excellent accompaniment to many different dishes on this wesite, especially pumpkin desserts. I've served it with both the Pumpkin Cheesecake with Bourbon Cream and the Pumpkin Roll Cake with Cream Cheese Filling. It gives a nice texture contrast, looks dramatic poking out of a slice of something, and has a wonderfully carmelly taste. I used a re-useable parchment sheet (like a Silpat) instead of the foil with great results ... just make sure you don't use a non-tempered rubber spatula to mix in the pepitas! ;)
