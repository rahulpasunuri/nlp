This is easy and super tasty! I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they say the chicken is bland...maybe they didn't season it enough? Or maybe they tried to "cut the fat" and didn't cook it in butter and oil? I've made this multiple times, and each time it's been excellent. Be sure to use fresh corn (frozen or canned will leave you with chewy corn). I usually double the relish because it's so delicious.

I didn't read the reviews and I wish I had. There are definitely some good suggestions. I think that marinating the chicken in lemon juice would improvie it. It's not bland, it just wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped.

This was easy and delicious. Like other reviewers suggested, I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, red pepper flakes, cracked black pepper and a teeny bit of thyme....I think I threw a touch of garlic powder in there too. I made the relish as directed.

I read many of the reviews and - because of personal choices - I didn't use any olive oil in the roasting of the corn, I just sprayed the pan with some olive oil spray. I also added the juice of 1 lemon (and the zest of half of same) to brighten the flavors a little bit. LOVELY! I will definitely make it again.

The relish was delicious, although I added a bit of vinegar and roasted the tomatoes. It has a lot of flavor, but not quite enough to make up for the blandness of the chicken in the recipe. The second time I made it I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and added red pepper and a few dried herbs to the flour, which made this much better.

Delicious! Picked this recipe to use our garden tomatoes in and it was a snap. Didn't use fresh corn...used a can of Libby's Naturals instead. My husband loved it and I was able to whip it up in 30 minutes flat. Mixed flour w/ Panko to get more crunch and less fat.

Extremely tasty. Added dry oregano, crushed red pepper and dry basil to the flour. Wouldn't consider this a quick and easy recipe, however. Between roasting the corn, preparing the relish, and prepping the chicken, there was a lot of time and mess involved.

Not bland at all, despite the reviews. Fresh and summery, simple and quick. Used half a Vidalia onion instead of green onions.

I'm only reviewing the relish... It's delicious. I salt-and-peppered the corn before roasting--- the pepper came through beautifully but wasn't overpowering. I also crumbled a little goat cheese on top.

This is a fantastic recipe for a quick, tasty and lovely summer meal. I used a combination of regular and lemon basil from my garden and it added a wonderful zest. I will make this relish again and again whether it's for chicken or a nice firm fish.

Very tasty, but it needed some enhancements. I used red onion instead of green onion and I added some minced garlic to the tomato mixture. For the chicken, I deglazed the pan with some white wine and minced garlic, then added some fresh lemon juice and 1/2 tblspn butter to the pan before returning the chicken to the pan for a quick rewarm before serving. I served this with rice pilaf and steamed asparagus - very yummy!

The corn relish was great -- roasting the corn is an excellent idea. The flavor is excellent, and it doesn't need the added oil at the end. I'd make the relish again. The chicken as written would have been dreadfully bland -- I coated with a mix of flour, bread crumbs and lots of herbs, which was good.

Deliciously simple chicken. I was rather in a hurry so I substituted canned shoepeg corn for the fresh corn that I drained and you could not tell the difference. I don't usually add much salt in my cooking, however this relish needed the additional flavor. A great "many time, any time" fresh flavor meal.

This is a very pretty recipe - it looks great on the plate. However, it did not have enough taste. The relish was seasoned, but did not compensate for the chicken's flavor as it was prepared.

Easy, yet fantastically delicious! My son's favorite chicken, I have made it dozens of times by now and my 9 year old has nicknamed it..Eliot's favorite chciken. The only time consuming part of this dish is scrapping the kernels off the cob and roasting them. I also tend to add more corn than the recipe included and cutdown a tad on the tomatoes. I also use the grape tomatoes cut in half....ENJOY!

Great summer dish. Super easy and super tasty. I cooked the chicken for exactly 3 minutes per side. Comes out perfectly done every time. Make sure to pound the chicken breast thinly!

I only made the relish from the recipe and served it cold with grilled chicken breasts. This is a fantastic summer meal!

Superb. This meal is great for entertaining...can be made ahead, and my children enjoyed it! It is preferable for a summer evening meal. Serve with a salad and crusty bread.

With a little modification, this could be a great recipe. Medium-high heat on my fairly normal stove resulted in burnt butter, so I cooked at medium heat for 5 minutes a side, still had overcooked chicken. Next time I'll try 4 minutes a side.

the relish was good, but the chicken was a bit boring. the relish as a side dish would be good enough for me..but i'm not sure if i'll make it again

Loved the relish. Chicken was just okay. Will definitely use relish for other dishes.

I used 4 ears of corn, added 1-2 tbs. fresh thyme and parsley and additional basil. Tsp of each white wine viniger and lemon. And I added equal parts of Italian bread crumbs to the flour before dredging the chicken. It was delicious!!!!

We loved the fresh tastes and the light feel of the flavors. Found it easy to make and quick, which comes in handy. The relish benefits from the generous use of salt and pepper.

We think this is a nice, light summer recipe and a great way to use what's fresh in the vegetable garden, if you have one. It just needs a bit of a tune-up. I use chicken tenders for this recipe. Cuts out the need for pounding. Also, I've found that dredging the chicken in my favorite oyster breading, which is more highly seasoned than flour alone, adds a lot of flavor. Make sure to get good, ripe tomatoes, fresh-as-possible sweet corn, and high-quality olive oil for best flavor with the relish. And don't be shy with the salt and pepper.

This recipe needs to have some seasoning - a major dose of seasoning, as a matter of fact! There is a Bon Appetite recipe from the late '70's, with almost the same ingredients, but with a cumin viniagrette - 100% better. Ignore this one and find something else to make use of wonderful ingredients.
