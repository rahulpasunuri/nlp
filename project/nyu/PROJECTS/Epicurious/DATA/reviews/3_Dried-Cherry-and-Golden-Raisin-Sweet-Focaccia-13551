Not bad, but I did make some changes...used Craisins since no dried cherries and cut it down to 1C each raisins & craisins, however I would cut that in half as well - just too many for my taste. Also, brown sugar never really carmelized on top so I would throw it into the dough and (if needed) do a glaze, etc after. Smelled great cooking!
