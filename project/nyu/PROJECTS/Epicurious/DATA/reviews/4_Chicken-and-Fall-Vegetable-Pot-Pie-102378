I made this recipe in 1999 when it was first in the magazine and annually since, it is a lovely meal when prepared as listed, but the sauce is even more exceptional when you use a white Zinfandel wine instead of the dry white wine. I've tried other variations as well, but the original (with the Zin exception) is still the best! Def serve with Chardonnay and a salad for a well rounded meal. Suitable for company dinner as well

Excellent! Subbed potatoes for half the turnips and spinach for the turnip greens because I couldn't find the latter. Used the cream cheese crust from another chicken pot pie recipe on this website, and it turned out great.

I followed the ingredients exactly. The turnips took over the taste, and the gravy was pretty lifeless.

This was good, but the taste wasn't much different from the standard turkey pot pie with peas and carrots that we make after Thanksgiving. This took much more effort to cook, though, so I'll probably just go back to the turkey recipe.

Excellent. Made this to satisfy the tastes of family that prefer comfort food while at the same time satisfying my wish for a lighter, more balanced meal. I rated the recipe as is, but I've also made with a couple variations at times: puff pastry instead of the herb crust (if I'm in a rush), and Herbes de Provence instead of the thyme (just for variety).

Used leftover "fried" chicken boiled in chicken broth and garlic, then shredded. Leftover onions, red and gr peppers, carrots,peas, beet greens. Used some leftover beef gravy I had and added coconut milk (due to dairy allergy) for the sauce. Margarine and leftover(was used for breading the fried chicken) spelt flour used in the crust. Mixed it in my f.processor...maybe too much because the dough was very "greasy" not in lumps as it should have been. Could not even incorporate the water. Due to time constraints I just made "patties" and plopped them on top of the already hot filling. Baked for 40min.at 400. I thought it was really good. Husband and son not so thrilled but they don't like pot pie at the best of times so... The crust is just that, a crust...it is not dumpling, cobbler, or biscuit type. Just a thick crust which tasted good.Next time I'll reduce the amount of shortening/butter/marg. Pardon me for deviating from the listed recipe but I do love to hear how other people use what's on hand to make a yummy dish even if it doesn't follow the recipe exactly.So this post is for those type of people.

My wife and I absolutely love this recipe. We have made it a half-dozen times already and have done some small modifications. First off, don't waste your time making the Herb Crust. Tried it, and it wasn't worth the effort nor was it that tasty. We buy a frozen pie crust and it works and tastes better. Secondly, we cut the amount of turnips in half and add Yukon Gold potatoes, frozen peas, corn and celery as well. Never been able to find turnip greens, so we omit any sort of green all together. This is a delicious meal and well worth the effort.

Rating: 3
The filling is absolutely delicious, but sadly, the pastry was very disappointing. I would definitely make again, but would use a better pastry recipe. It was still a big hit though! Also - couldn't find turnip greens, so I used spinach. Turned out great!

Wonderful in every way. I forgot/improvised in many ways (forgot the carrots, added green beans and mushrooms, didn't have time to cool before putting in the oven, etc. etc.) but it was still amazing! Served 10 people with some leftovers.

Rating: 3
It's all been said, but yes - this is a really great recipe! I followed it exactly with the exception of turnip greens (can't have leafy greens, as I'm on blood thinners), but subbed some green beans instead with excellent results. The herb crust is yummy, but watch how much water you add to the dough. I added about 6 Tbsp, and it came out just shy of being too doughy. It could have crisped up a bit better, but it was still delicious! I think perhaps a teaspoon or so of curry powder might add a nice zing to the sauce and I will probably try doing that the next time I make this. Yes, it's a lot of work and makes LOTS of dirty dishes, but if you have a lazy weekend, you can spread the work out over two days and have a yummy one dish meal at the end of it all. Makes plenty for a crowd!

Fabulous recipe. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, boiled in 4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth, along with a half pound of turnips, a half pound of potatoes and the carrots. Used 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper in the gravy, which worked out perfectly. The reviewers who said the gravy was addictive are correct! I also used a puff pastry sheet, which I rolled out with some dried thyme. Cut out the leaf shapes and stretched it across the top of the oval casserole. Had to cover it with foil for the last 10 minutes of baking to avoid the crust getting too dark, but was it DELICIOUS! Impressed everyone, and the little ones loved all the veggies - they helped plant and care for the garden all year, and got to enjoy the tasty results. Highly recommend this recipe!

Rating: 4
Excellent. The turnips make for a nice substitution to more starchy potatoes. The turnip greens give it a more earthy flavor than traditional pot pie; which is usually on the sweet end of the spectrum. If you are looking for the more common pot pie recipe this is not for you but if you want a more grownup tasting recipe go with this one. Careful, the gravy is addicting.

Won't rate as haven't made this recipe but responding to gavins from American in London. I toss parsnips and carrots in a little olive oil and roast them fairly high heat to get some brown on them. When cooled I chop them and basically follow this recipe. I've gotten a huge response and think the roasting adds a depth of flavor and nuttiness that really works. Hope you try this method and let me know if you enjoyed.

Rating: 4
Amazing! Don't change a thing! Well, actually, I used half a pound of potatoes and half a pound of turnips. But other than that I made exactly as written and it was a huge hit at my dinner party. A couple of people went in for 4ths! Yes, this recipe takes a long time to make. But if you're cooking for people you love and have a weekend day to get it done go for it....you won't be dissapointed! Thanks to previous reviewers who raised the salt issue. I used more than I would normally feel comfortable using and it was glad...it really does need quite a bit.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Made this as written, with fresh herbs, except I cut down the sugar in the crust to just a large pinch. The herb crust is to die for! I think those who say it was bland did not season the gravy enough. It needs to be quite aggressively seasoned as it has to flavor the whole filling.

Good solid recipe but quite a bit of work and got a ho-hum response. still searching for my perfect pot pie.

tried this recipe last night and it is to die for. for anyone thinking that the sauce was bland, just keep adding black pepper until it doesn't taste bland. salt is too overrated, just add a bit. i cheated and used frozen pie crust and just added the thyme and parsley to it and it was just great. i can see why this one's a blue ribbon recipe.

a very very tasty pie but the pastry was sooo evil that I felt too guilty eating it. Next time I will make with a healthier pastry so I can enjoy the meal more.

Rating: 4
Incredibly good, when made with good quality ingredients. I can imagine it would be pretty dull with anaemic supermarket value chicken and canned low-sodium broth. I make this recipe roughly every fortnight during the cold months, and have found a routine that makes it MUCH easier. Firstly, use a large, free-range, corn-fed chicken to make a roast or pot-roast chicken for dinner. Enjoy immensely. When it's cooled, pick the carcass clean, putting any meat aside for the pot pie and dumping all the bones, skin, plate scrapings and leftover gravy into a slow cooker. Throw in the usual stock veggies and seasonings. Fill to the top with water and cook on low all night AND the following day. The next afternoon, about two hours before you want to eat your pot pie, strain stock into a saucepan and chop the vegetables while the it comes to a boil, and then chop up the chicken meat, leek and onions while the vegetables cook. Proceed with the recipe as directed. I find that it takes me about 30 minutes of actual work to make this - 25 minutes to slice, dice and make the filling, and another 5 minutes after it has all rested to roll out the pasty. I use an all-butter, ready-made shortcrust block from the freezer, and just sprinkle the herbs on top as I roll it out. I've made this about a dozen times now, and my personal taste is to use about half the quantity of chicken called for and double the vegetables. I also like to use celery, peas, sweet potato, butternut squash, jerusalem artichokes, chestnut mushrooms, whatever needs to be used from the CSA, and I like to dice things a little smaller (about 1/3 of a an inch cubes). We usually have enough stock to make risotto the next night and then we have pot pie leftovers the night after that. So one really good quality chicken does four meals, and you have the satisfaction of knowing that you haven't wasted a single morsel of food.

I don't know why everyone thinks this is so bland. It is wonderful! Yes it is a lot work but isn't anything worth having that way? And in my opinion, if you did not follow the recipe to the letter you can't really say that you made it.

My family and I were disappointed. Agree with previous reviewer that sauce was very bland. Recipe says salt and pepper to taste. I am not afraid of salt and added what I thought was sufficient..it needed a lot more. I didn't grow up eating pot pies and so it doesn't have the comfort food hook for me...just found it boring.

Rating: 2
Made according to the recipe. BLAND. The sauce seemed to be amazing when I made it, but when it was baked with the veggies, it was lost, and it was not rich, and not as wonderful as I expected from the other reviews. My first real Epicurious disappointment.

this is my husband's favorite and a step up form my childhood version with Cream of chicken soup. I use a mix of different veggies and I don't parboil-just put in sauce. I also use half and half instead.I do not use the herb crust- drop "dumplings" from mom's recipe ontop of "stew" and bake for 30 min.

Rating: 4
If you like to cook, this is well worth the time and effort! The herb crust is heaven. It's even better if you let it sit for awhile after cooking or make a day ahead since the flavors only get better. Substituted potatoes once when no turnips were available. Used frozen turnip greens and already cut carrots.

Rating: 2
This was a ton of work. I did it in separate steps and cooked filling day before. The taste was bland and not what I expected. The veggies were not cooked through even though I cooked much longer than the required 10 minutes. Quite disappointing! Will not be making this recipe again.

Rating: 4
What is UP with the 'so much effort' comments? It's a lot of steps but it's a lot of super easy stoppable steps where you can take plenty of breaks if you want. Cool the chicken the day before if you want. Use leftover chicken from Sunday's roast. Boil veggies and put all in a container to wait some more. Make cream sauce... not hard at all! Didn't even really take much time since I only spent ten or twenty minutes on it at a time. Definitely something you can slowly make over the day if you have rambunctious little kids. ANYWAY to the actual review - it is FANTASTIC, easy, simple and seriously you think it feeds a lot until you put the whole tray in front of a hungry husband. I managed to sneak two mini-pies for a friend out of it first, thank goodness!!!

This is a regular winner at our house now, and I make it with different vegetables each time: rutabaga or butternut squash for the orange; kale, chard, or spinach for greens; toss in some frozen peas and corn; carrot coins; sliced mushrooms. I use Marsala as the wine. The herb crust makes the recipe. Using a rotisserie chicken helps immensely on time, but it is still a four hour act. Love it! Well worth the effort. Everyone who has tried it asks for the recipe.

This was really, really good. The only change I made was to skip the turnip greens (because of the "slimey" review), and add green peas. It's a keeper, for sure.

This recipe was soooooo good. The only change that I made was that I used store bought pie crust and sprinkled the suggested herbs on the mixture before laying the crust on it. I made a half recipe and it yielded 5 very generous portions. Next time I will make the full batch so that I have more leftovers. It is worth the time.

This was my first time making pot pie and it was so delicious! I didn't make the Herb Crust, I just used "plain" Pate Briseé, the same recipe I use for ALL my pies, sweet and savory. It's basically the same recipe as the Herb Crust but without the herbs. For the filling, I omitted the turnip greens and by mistake used half-and-half instead of whipping cream. I also added some fresh chopped rosemary. I had to halve the recipe because my baking dish wasn't big enough... This recipe definitely will make me run out and get a bigger dish so I can make more of this delicious pot pie!!!

Made a batch with tofu alongside the chicken pot pie -- both delicious. I just sauteed extra firm tofu in olive oil with plenty of salt and pepper to replace the boiled chicken, then used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth. Great recipe and a crowd pleaser.

This was great... But if i had to make it again i would substitute the turnip greens for something more appealing like peas or string beans. Turnip greens just added a weird dark green color and a slimy texture. Ewww... Don't get me wrong though, it is still definitely worth making. The gravy had me licking my bowl.

I substituted potatoes for the turnip and kale for the turnip greens. It tasted fine, but for me it was WAY too much work for just "fine". I did think the herb crust was very interesting and good if not exactly the healthiest.

Rating: 4
For those of you who need a lower fat version: I used skim milk instead of cream and only 1/4 c. flour and the sauce was perfect. For the crust I used low fat "refrigerated crescent rolls." Thus I cooked it for 20 min w/o the crust and another 15 with the crust. Delicious! (I also used celery and snow peas and potatoes for the turnips and greens because that is what was in the fridge.)

Rating: 4
This was by far the most sophisticated chicken pot pie I've had. The only substitution I made was for Kale instead of turnip greens because that's what I had on hand. It was a bit time consuming but can be made ahead of time which works for me. Very comforting and so good.

Excellent - first time pot pie-er here and this was great. didn't have turnip so skipped it. Would reduce cream and add more wine next time - also added more salt. Used Edna Staebler's recipe for regular pie crust and was great. Next time will make in a whole pie shell instead of just putting a crust on top. Was a little bit runny but had left over gravy so next time will only put in as much as necessary. Also made stock by boiling a whole chicken with the veggies - have left over stock for later and the damn thing was excellent. everybody loved it including dad who is extremely picky...

First of all, please don't judge me. I read most of the reviews and the one that hit home was the woman who asked for the review to be made using only the ingredients in the recipe. Okay, so I did that except for the crust. I used store bought, it's just so against my nature to buy lard so I bought the store bought. This was a labor intensive recipe for me at least with three kids running around. But it's in the oven as I type and I will let you know how it tastes in a moment or two. It smells so yummy. I made two pot pies, one for tonight and the other for company this weekend. This is delicious! four forks it is!! Enjoy.

I have made this a couple of time with some variations for our taste (hence the three forks) to rave reviews. I use a couple of yams instead of carrots, potatoes instead of turnips and kale instead of turnip greens. My boyfriend's son really loves this! I will only use one leek next time. I used 3 both times but only because I forgot to make that change the second time. This takes a lot of time but a great result.

wow! Just made this for a family birthday celebration and thought it was fabulous! Even with such great reviews, I was afraid it was going to be bland, but not so. The leeks, fresh thyme and white wine made for great flavor. I made some minor changes: 1) made homemade stock with breast halves and thighs, 2) swapped some veggies. Used celery root instead of turnips and added green beans instead of the greens 3) sauteed the leeks/shallots in the pan drippings from 1/2 pound bacon plus the butter. IMO, these changes are minor and this recipe probably would have been great even as written. Much better than another pot pie recipe on epicurious--Mini Chicken Pot Pies with Bacon and Marjoram, which I've also made but did not find as flavorful. Great recipe, try it with your own changes and see! I plan on making it again this week because we had NO leftovers!

Made this for supper today. It was fantastic - very much a comfort food. I did alter it a little: used potato and corn instead of turnip greens; onion and garlic instead of leek & shallots; apple juice instead of wine (I'm pregnant); and only 1/2 of whipping cream. To save time I purchased pie crust though I would have preferred to make my own. Still, it was wonderful.

I have tried many versions of chicken potpie and the basics here work well. The thing with a potpie is that you have a basic way to prepare, and you can add variations with ingredients and steps. Cooked ingredients Sauce to bind it all together Crust, or puff pastry on the side Normally I avoid frozen foods, but you can use here frozen pearl onions and peas. I prefer fresh carrots and greens. A pre cooked rotisserie chicken that you shred the meat from (eliminating skin and bones) works fine and saves a step in cooking the chicken yourself. The thing with doing your own chicken breast is that you can cube the white meat for an attractive presentation. As far a vegetables, I do like to add sautéed sliced mushrooms, frozen peas (simply thawed by draining with water) and fresh carrots, steamed or boiled. You can use the wilted turnip greens, or Swiss chard or spinach. You can add the turnips or use precooked cubed potatoes You can add cooked cubed ham. You can add parboiled pearl onions. Frozen is easy, as you do not have to deal with the skins. For the sauce, which binds it all together, I like this version in this recipe. I prefer to chop rather than slice the leeks. Thyme works very well, and I like a very tiny bit of cayenne to the sauce. You do not have to do a crust: I like the frozen puff pastry shells, baked separately ahead of time and sliced in half. The bottom with some of the filling on the plate and then the cap jauntily placed on top each serving. A sprig of fresh time is like the feather in the cap.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe, although I did alter it a bit to fit in my 2.5 quart dish. I used half the amount of chicken and vegetables (added mushrooms and peas as others have), and used the full amounts of everything in the gravy except for the broth - only 2 cups instead of 4. It actually worked out perfectly and the gravy thickened well, was delicious and there was just the right amount for the dish. Will definitely make this again. Agree that fresh thyme really helps, and I added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper along with the seasoning.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing. I made chicken broth and used the chicken for the pot pie. Also, I substituted a non dairy liquid whipped topping. The turnip greens took a while to prepare but it was worth the effort and I can't believe that my children liked it. The crust is perfect for the recipe.

I have made one of the other recipes for Chicken Pot Pie on this site (the one with Creme Fraiche) and this one was greatly preferred by my family. Just delicious. I added mushroom and peas, subbed kale for the turnip greens, used chicken pulled from a rotisserie chicken and made my favorite homemade pie crust. Will make again and again.

NO FORKS FOR THIS - I'm amazed it was rated 4 forks! Did anyone notice there's no seasoning (salt & pepper) in the recipe? All the prep (cook this, then that, then reheat it all for 40 mins) was excessive, the sauce was tasteless, and making the roux with the leeks/shallot mixture in the pan seemed odd and didn't work. It was a gluggy mess and the liquid quantity was way too much and made it a runny tasteless mess. I spent 40 mins trying to trick it up so it was edible for a now very late dinner. The leftovers went in the trash. The amount of work for a pot pie,especially when it ended up bland and soupy was ridiculous. Total waste of time and ingredients. I'll stick to my own recipe which always turns out well and gets rave reviews.

This a great basic recipe that's easy to play with to tailor to your own tastes. I used earlier suggestions of using potatoes instead of turnips and chard instead of turnip greens. I also added more carrots and some mushrooms. It was perfect. And the herb crust is a great compliment. This is going into the regular rotation...probably with a little tweak everytime :)

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and LOVE it. I boil chicken breasts with bones to add flavor and body to the stock then shred the chicken. During the summer I will pick up turnips from the farmer's market but otherwise use russet potatoes instead of turnips. I also use Chard instead of turnip greens even though I do not typically like chard. The gravy is my favorite and I always like to put more on than less so I will increase some ingredients for more bulk. I also use pie pans with the frozen crust then cover with store bought again. It doesn't sound very gourmet but works just fine. I finish with about 6 pies. Reheating frozen pies takes about an hour and a half. The texture kept with the carrots.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Yes, feel free to mix and match with veggies and turkey vs. chicken, etc. I used a small whole chicken, boiling down some of the bones for stock to bolster the commercial broth. I also did not have the right size baking pan, so I made it in a deep dish pie pan. Everything fit in (although it was swelling high up top like a smurf pie -- very abundant looking) except about 1 1/2 C of the sauce. Which means I reserved that much sauce for another use, and the pie was still delicious. I like the idea of using half-and-half instead of cream, to lighten up the sauce a bit. Fresh herbs in the crust are important.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I used a splash of half-and-half instead of the cream. It does make a thin sauce after it bakes, but with proper seasoning, it was very tasty. For guests, I would probably use the cream, but for my husband and I this was perfect. I also subbed in other vegetables (mushrooms, peas). Perfect comfort food.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used fresh rosemary in place of fresh thyme in the sauce and crust; used roasted turkey breast; and Christmas tree cutouts instead of leaf shapes. Our guests loved it! Next time I would increase the butter/flour in the sauce to make it thicker, as by the time it was done baking, the sauce was pretty thin.

Rating: 4
The PERFECT post-thanksgiving recipe (with four suggested substitutes): switch out the chicken for turkey, -use turkey stock from boiling the carcass, leftover seasonings, drippings, etc., -possible alternative to pie crust is to pile on mashed potatoes (shephard's pie, essentially) - vegetable options: peas, broccoli, and potato instead of turnips. This year, we had leftover bacon/brussel sprouts to add to the mix. One other note: for kid friendly cooking, have individual 4-5" ramekins, having prepared ingredients separately, display them in an assembly line, and let kids/guests choose their favorite vegetable options to mix in with rest of ingredients. Then let them finish off with their own pastry decoration/potato sculpture.

Rating: 3
Great comfort food! I used a 4+ pound whole chicken and cut it into 4 pieces. I bought puffed pastry sheets instead of making the dough. I used baby spinach leaves instead of turnip greens, a combination of turnip, parsnips, and potatoes to total 1#, a medium onion instead of leeks. It only took about 20 or so minutes in the oven by the time the crust was brown and the filling was bubbling over.

Second time I have made this and just loved it! This time left out the turnip (just didnt have) and was SO tasty! I used 3 chicken quarters, which yeiled about 1/2 of what was needed, but I was 1/2ing it anyway. I used half and half and it was a bit watery even with a bit of corn starch, so whipping cream is needed Will make this one again!

This is really a great pot pie. I have made modifications to the recipe to suit our tastes and what we had in the fridge, but that is the beauty of a recipe like this, add veggies you like. I used a Reisling for the wine in the sauce though and wasn't happy with the sweet tang it imparted. I will look to a drier wine next time. I made three 9" pies and froze two (prior to baking). Thaw before baking and you have an easy and delicious weeknight meal.

Well, MarcOttawa from Canada, you missed out by buying the crusts because this one really compliments the recipe. It's part of the whole configuration. This pot pie has become a staple in our household and I follow it exactly as is. Whoever thought this recipe up is a true chef in my book.

On 09JAN08, I made and ate 1 of the six 6, 6 inch pies I was able to yield following the recipe quantities. I used store bought shells for ease of use.

In the future I will serve small segments as an appetizer before a multiple course meal. Simply delicious!

I made this two night ago, then realized that I did not allow sufficient prep time, so I refrigerated the chicken and vegetables mixture. The next day, there was barely any sauce (could be because I added one potato, and peas), so I made an additional batch of sauce, using nearly 2/3 of it. The problem was the crust. I used phyllo. This was my first time ever using it, so perhaps it was my error. The result was a paper-like crust that we both ended up scraping off around the edges. Would someone please let me know if there is another phyllo-like that would have worked better? Thanks.

Excellent crust- it really made the pie. It is A LOT OF WORK, but the end result is worth-while. Next time I make this, I will add mushrooms, potatoes and parsnips. I will use less than 1/2 of the turnips because I think they made the end result a little bitter.

I first tried this recipe 4 yrs ago! wow time flies...anyway I still use it when I have time....one thing I have to say about this recipe as with any recipe is read it through before you strat....start early...and prep prep prep....have things cut up and measured out before starting..or you'll think it's a nightmare to make....it's not so bad...also try the curst homemade..its so much better...do it the day before and just keep it chilled....well..that's my little tip...enjoy!

I used a local, farm- raised chicken, vegetables from the farmer's market, and herbs from my garden for the crust. It takes a while but was worth the effort. Totally delicious. I augmented the cream base with a little marsala wine, which boosted the flavor. The herb crust is a GREAT complement to the filling.

Very tasty! My husband loved it. My substitutions: store-bought crust and rotisserie chicken, as well as spinach. I chopped all the veggies the day before to minimize prep time. Other reviewers were right: make sure to add salt and pepper to taste!

This is a very good recipe. I made the pot pie with traditional ingredients- pototatoes, corn, peas , carrot and a one leek. The sauce was not thick but was very tasty. I would definitely make this again

Wow. I, too, made substitutions - phyllo dough with butter instead of the crust, brusselini (the greens from the tops of brussels sprouts) instead of turnip greens. I think it would be hard to mess this one up. Even my kids loved it!

Didn't notice the 45 minute cooling off period, so that threw my schedule off a bit. I'm sure the herb crust is great, but that's just too fussy for me--I used a store-bought one. Overall, it was a hit, though personally I thought it could use a touch more flavor. Definately check the gravy for salt and pepper.

Just terrific! Subbed celery root and winter squash for turnips, but everything else as written. Don't be shy with the salt and pepper - the dish needs it.

This is a really good take on the traditional pot pie. Several of the reviewers substituted things that saved time; I used chicken stock and then put in cooked rotisserie chicken. I used baby white turnips, carrots, then turnip greens, green beans, peeled broccoli stems, thyme and rosemary. I also used prepared pie crust and baked the whole thing in a large casserole. Yum! It's a great way to use turnips and bitter greens. We get lots from our farm share, and I don't particularly like them, so it's a great way to not waste, and the pie is quite delicious.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe as a base and added a lot of veggies to it. Instead of turnips an turnip greens I used parsnips, broccoli, potatoes and some mushrooms. It was great! I also made one version totally vegetarian with tofu instead of chicken, soy milk and veggie bullion. It was a big hit all around. I would definitely make it again (with the additional veggies).

Rating: 4
Wonderfully delicious and total comfort food. I use store-bought pie dough (because I'm lazy) and it was just fine. I make it in a deep dish pie pan, so I have leftover filling to freeze. When I want another one, I can simply thaw the filling and get another pie crust from my freezer and it's ready to go. Great to make on a weekend when I have lots of prep time, and then I can make the other after work when I don't have much time. Very hearty. I served it for a small dinner party one night, and my guests loved it.

Perfect! Can't wait to make it for friends.

This wasn't exactly what I expected. I personally felt that the turnip and turnip greens added more of a mustard, pungent smell that wasn't exactly suitable for my "comfort food" taste. My husband loved it and having been raised on "Banquet Chicken Pot Pies" this recipe was more than heavenly. If I make this again, I will shorten the prep time by using a large package of frozen mixed vegetables and keep the sauce the same. The Herb Crust was tasty and unique but I found that the dough was too moist and difficult to handle.

I substitued red kale for the turnip greens- it was fabulous. I also cheated and purchased a store pie crust- but it saved a lot of time. Perfect on a Fall night.

My snobby gourmet loving boyfriend says this is the best pot pie he has ever had & I agree. I had never cooked turnips before but they were a very pleasant surprise and it is fun to improvise a little with this recipe. This is a time consuming recipe but I usually boil extra chicken to make soup, or chicken salad and turnip greens can be purchased bagged. YUM!

This is definitly a time consuming process to make this dish. I was very excited to try this after everything was made but the filling was bland and the crust was not so good (I'm not a baker so I probably made the crust wrong anyway) I would suggest leaving out the turnip leaves and adding dried mushrooms to the sauce mixture.

NOT A LAST MINUTE DISH!!!!!!!! Delicious,superb, but time consuming, even with lefover chicken and frozen broth. Didn't have time to think about dessert. Added collard greens, leftover corn off the cob, red pepper. The greens added a bite that spinach couldn't. With the 30-45 min cooling off period, start this at noon or the day before.

Outstanding recipe. It has become a regular and I don't change a thing. The turnip greens gives it the special flavor and I wouldn't think of substituting spinach or anything else. Yes it is time consuming -- but some things are just worth it.

Rating: 4
I've made this repeatedly, and it's always an enormous hit. I substitute a bag of organic baby spinach for the turnip greens, and use a few small turnips as well as a few parsnips for some sweetness. No potatoes, as they would absorb sauce, making the pot pie too dry. One thing I've found makes a wonderful addition is a small amount of sliced jarred pimento, well drained (I dry it completely on paper towels). It adds some sparkle to an otherwise pale-looking dish and a subtle, bright flavor. The crust is easy to make if you use cold ingredients and mix it in a food processor up to the stage where you mix in water with a fork. (You can now get transfat-free shortening, which is a plus and yields the same good results.)

make this lotZ, add potatoes, mushrooms, whatever veggies i have on hand, use rotissery chicken from the deli...fast, easy, yumZ! i have frozen the filling before, let it thaw in the fridge during the day and bake as instructed, i think i added about 15min extra, comes out great!

I like this dish a lot. I've made it several times, and just use whatever veggies I have on hand. I also add potatoes. I tried making the crust once but it didn't come out great and so now I use store bought croissant-like pastry dough. Very yummy.

Chicken pie impressive? You bet. This is a regular when I have a crowd to feed and it's always a hit. However, rather than turnips and greens, I use the usual chicken pie veggies: peas, carrots and potatoes. The herb crust gives a touch of elegance as well as flavor. I cut an appropriate design out of the scraps (Christmas tree; heart, etc.) and it wows the audience. This pie is a bit labor intensive, though not difficult. I start a couple of days ahead. You can make the crust, cook the chicken, etc. Put it together early in the day, pop it in the oven, make a salad and take a bow.

Made the recipe exactly as specified. The herb crust had great texture, but I didn't love the herbs (and I love thyme). Next time, I'll leave the herbs out of the crust. The filling was very good - and leaves plenty of room for experimentation.

I made this in 6 individual small baking dishes and froze 4. While this was good the first time around the frozen pies were fantastic...time to let flavors meld, I guess. I found that using four cups of broth left the filling too dry. I used leftover roast chicken and added mushrooms because I had a few to use up. Wonderful comfort food on a cold winter evening. Next time I'll try using a rough pastry crust although this one was fine.

A great dish to make when you're wondering what do do with your roast chicken and vegetable leftovers! I used the leftover chicken and veggies from a previous meal, added collard greens, and substituted non-fat evaporated milk for the whipping cream. I also used half the suggested butter. It was delicious and my 8 year old son had 3 helpings!!

Very good pot pie, love the herb crust, but next time I would add more cracked pepper for it really needs it. Would also buy a whole chicken to be more frugal, using the bones to add more flavor to the broth (used 1/2 breast and 1/2 leg meat anyway this time, worked fine). Wonderful fall recipe, liked the turnip greens and turnips in it too. Split it into two dishes without a problem, froze one to have later.

I felt this recipe was fantastic! I changed a couple things, instead of adding white wine I added Madeira for a sweeter taste, added mushrooms to the tyme and leeks, and I also made enough crust to do a bottom layer so it was a "true" pot pie.

You want comfort food? This is it! This was awesome. No one in our family had ever knowingly eaten turnips, but they were perfect in this. Our three kids all thought they tasted similar to potatoes, but they had a better consistency for a pot pie - not so mushy or mealy. No way would I substitute potatoes. One substitution I did make was the vegetable shortening in the crust. I can't stand the idea of eating something so manufactured, so I used unsalted butter for the whole thing. It was awesome. Even as leftovers reheated in the microwave, the crust retained some flakiness. This recipe would work really well as a make-ahead dish. We really, really liked it.

This is one of my favorite all time recipes w/ a few changes. I substitute more common pot pie vegetables for all the root vegetables (broccoli, peas, potatoes, etc.) The rest of the recipe is fabulous. My mother and I catered my wedding this summer and the pot pie (which we served in small individual ramekins) was one of the most popular dishes. And, as others have remarked, it freezes remarkably well.

Rich! Skip your dessert. I took other reviewer's suggestions and used potatoes and spinach instead of turnips and greens, BUT I did add one small turnip and that particular taste accounts for the "fall vegetable" taste. Fresh thyme makes all the difference in the world here so don't skimp on it. I could give this three and a half forks but this pie is delish, and I certainly wouldn't want to ruin the fan's winning streak on this one!

I made some major modifications to this recipe, based on what I had on hand: I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, substituted frozen chopped spinach for the turnip greens, substituted one rutabega and four little potatoes for the turnips, used dried herbs instead of fresh, and eliminated the wine. But I am sure that making the recipe as is would have come out just as delicious if not even more (although I have never eaten turnip greens and have no idea what they're like), but this was one of the yummiest things I've ever made. Oh, and I didn't have a big enough casserole, so I made two 8-by-8 ones without changing any of the amounts in the recipe, which worked fine. If I could give this five forks I would. Yes it's time consuming but SO worth it!!

This dish is fabulous! I wanted a more traditional pie so i omited the turnips and greens but added parsnips, potatoes, and peas. I'm also a vegetarian so i added some fake chicken. It turned out wonderful. The gravy and herb crust are delicious! Yes, it is time consuming so be prepared, however, it is well worth the time spent.

Excellent!! the most delicious pie I have ever had -takes a long time to make but totally worth it. My friend Susan who recommended this recipe suggested I use 2 3/4 lb potatoes instead of turnips and greens but then it was too dry so I doubled the liquid part of the recipe (broth, cream, leeks, butter, wine, flour, thyme, and shallots) and it is amazing. I also triple the herb crust recipe so I can make individual pot pies instead of a casserole. The best recipe so far on Epicurious.

Very good, a bit more time consuming than expected, but I should have remembered potpies always take me more time than I think they will.

Fresh parsley and dried thyme on hand, so that's what I used.

Absolutely wonderful! As many other reviewers, I substituted the greens and turnips for potatoes and frozen peas. I couldn't find leeks at the store, so I used scallions instead. This was EXCELLENT!

This was an amazing recipe everyone loved it. I would have given it 5 forks if possible. I substituted potatoes for turnip which I think is a must and left out the greens other than that I followed it exactly. I made this with my daughter and so I divided the recipe to make 2 smaller pies. She said her boyfriend loved it and her more now as a result. He even took a picture of it. One recommendation for a novice cook. The herb crust was delicious but if you are not good with pastry it can be difficult to make pastry with butter with butter. I would just make normal pastry if you are not good with it.Thanks for an amazing recipe my status as a cook has improved after this.

This was amazing - even my 18-month-old loved it! I substituted potatoes for the turnips, and left out the greens. Next time I might add broccoli. It was time-intensive to make, but a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Definitely make the herb crust - it's fabulous.

I made a few changes, used homemade turkey stock and leftover thanksgiving turkey, and substituted potatoes for the turnips (I'm just not crazy about them). I also threw in some mushrooms and frozen green beans I had laying around. The great thing about this recipe is that you can modify it to what you have around the house or what fresh produce you can get, and it still turns out great. I made individual servings in small disposable loaf pans and froze them, and they cook up great straight from the freezer when you don't feel like cooking :)

The sauce is spectacular. I will likely change the crust next time around and use white and dark meats from the chicken.

This is a wonderful recipie, and it's not difficult to do. I followed the recipe with only one substantial change (substitued baby spinach for turnip greens, 'cause I couldn't find any). I also boiled a whole chicken for use instead of breast and used the stock from that ILO canned or boxed stock. The result was a very rich, delicious comforting meal that pleased the whole family (including a very finicky 3 year old). The star of the dish is the sauce...as someone else previously stated. I'd bet it would be good with any combination of veggies you have(and maybe even seafood instead of poultry)on hand. This is SO GOOD. If you're craving a pot pie, this one will become your signature dish. Be creative, have a good time, and enjoy the results!

Just curious, but several reviewers mention making this with 'roasted garlic chicken stock'. Is the recipe for that stock on this site, or is is just the addition of roasted garlic in making your stock? Planning on making this pot pie tonight.

WOW!! I think this is the best pot pie I've ever tasted, and I didnt even follow the recipe exactly. I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, stock I made earlier from the carcass, potatoes (hate turnips), scallions instead of leeks, peas instead of greens, and a small onion instead of shallots. Also, I used whole milk and thickened the sauce with a cornstarch slurry instead - much less fat, just as creamy. I agree with the other reviewers, the crust and the sauce really makes this dish, well worth the extra time if you can spare it. My husband, who was sick and tired of eating leftover Thanksgiving turkey, couldnt get enough of this pie!

This is definately a keeper! I made this for our dinner club and it received great reviews. I'm not good with homemade crusts but had to give this one a try. It was terrific. The whole pie freezes well and rewarms for leftovers too. Can't wait to make it again.

I used potatoes, onions, celery and bits of roasted red pepper, peas and shoepeg corn that I had in the freezer. I used fresh marjoram, thyme, parsely and rosemary with the vegetables. I followed the recipe for the sauce, though, and for the herb crust as well. It was a huge hit -- my husband was putty in my hands the entire evening!! It's a great recipe, and I'll make it again for sure (but probably not the same way twice :-)!! I think the sauce is so flavorful because the chicken is cooked in the broth, then the vegetables. It really enrichens the flavor.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe for fall/winter. However, I wouldn't use turnips in the recipe again. I really didn't like the taste, and they tended to overpower the whole pie. When I make this again, I'll probably subsitute potatoes for the turnips, which would make this a 4 fork recipe in my eyes. Also...instead of making this as one big dish, I made several small pies and froze them. They taste just as good when you cook them after being frozen as they do fresh.

Had to try this pie crust recipe and found that it beat out my long-time standard (Pillsbury All-Ready Pie Crust, rolled thin). I will use it for all savory pies and tarts from now on. However -- a pot pie without both a top and bottom crust is like a plane without a wing: it won't fly with my family.

I modified the recipe slightly. Instead of the chicken, I cubed a roasted turkey breast that I had in the freezer. I also used evaporated milk instead of whipping cream. Not quite as rich, but lower in fat. And still delicious. All in all, I was very pleased with the results, particularly the herbed crust. I'd make it again.

This is a keeper, not to difficult. I used leftover oven stuffer chicken and cut up leftover potatoes, added carrots and parsnips and a small red pepper just for the color. It was a last minute dinner so didn't have time for the crust used puff pastry and it was delicous. Also used fresh thyme and garlic and parsley cubes to cook the veg and as the base of the gravy. Will make again and try the herb crust.

I did not make a large enough pie and had much filling left over. I reheated it and put it over cooked pasta. It was WONDERFUL!!! I highly recommend to make a full recipe of the filling, half recipe of the crust and then use the filling for two different meals. Have fun!!!

Excellent - rich, flavourful and very satisfying. The sauce/gravy was outstanding, although a little thin - will reduce the amount of broth next time. I did make a few changes: garlic herb chicken broth, deleted turnip greens, added green peas and sliced mushrooms, used chicken breasts and thighs. The herb crust was excellent. Time consuming and dirtied a lot of dishes, but well worth it. Hearty comfort food at its best!

I needed some serious comfort food the day after a plumbing disaster, and this was exactly what I was craving. A hug with a flaky golden crust. Of course, I tweaked it depending on what I had on hand: spinach (not greens), dried thyme, butter not shortening, and I substituted about a quarter cup of corn meal for some of the flour to give the crust more texture. I used low fat half & half instead of cream, and spring onions instead of leeks, and the sauce was still so good we actually ate the little bit left over with a spoon while the pie baked (embarassing, but true). One bit of advice: use a decent (not cooking) wine. (Luna di Luna was great--have a glass while you're chopping everything up.) It was long process, but not hard, and very worth it. I can't wait to get home to a dry house and leftovers!

Delicious. My kids, ages 6 and 9, love this dish. My husband says it is the BEST POT PIE he's ever tasted. I have made it twice now -- once as a pot pie using a Pilsbury pie crust and once as a shepherd's pie using mashed potatoes as a crust. (The kids liked this the best). I used chicken and pork loin chops (cubed) for the meat. For the vegetables, I add whatever I have in the house that strikes my fancy -- carrots, russet potatoes, sweet potatoes, red lentils, frozen green beans, green peas, spinach, leeks, onions, red and orange bell peppers, zucchini, summer squash, portabella mushrooms. Next time, for convenience, I will substitute a reduced calorie cream of chicken soup for the sauce. Since I add so many vegetables, I end up with enough filling for three or four pies. I freeze the additional filling in ziploc freezer bags. Then, when I want a quick meal, I can defrost it, top it with a pie crust or mashed potatoes, and --VOILA -- a gourmet meal in less than an hour! This has become a regular feature in our family's meal plans.

Rating: 3
Definitely a good recipe--mostly due to the reviews I think. I substituted a parsnip and spinach for the turnip and greens, and also added a chopped russet potato to the veggie mix. I used a roasted garlic chicken broth which really gave the whole dish great flavor, and added mushrooms and peas to the sauce before tossing it in with the vegetables. It was a time consuming and messy preparation, but the dish is definitely worth it. I think the extra veggies increased the over all volume of filling, so I ended up with some leftovers, which I'm going to mix with some rice and the leftover sauce.

Rating: 4
The sauce is delicious and not difficult to make. I used potatoes, turnips, carrots, green beans, mushrooms and spinach. The whole process was time-consuming and I even skipped the 45-minute cooling period for the sauce/veggie/chix mixture and it made no difference at all. I worried the crust would get soggy or steamed but the crust came out crisp and thoroughly cooked. I brushed a beaten egg over the crust before baking for a nice shiny golden top.

Terrific. I made this a month or so ago just for the filling---didn't do the crust. Substituted fresh spinach for the turnip greens. Leftovers freeze well. I had forgotten about them, and they were a tasty surprise on a cold day. Thick and delicious, accompanied by a couple of slices of toasted bread. Yum.

Excellent! I adjusted it to fit my personal tastes: parsnips and spinach for the turnips and greens. Will add peas and maybe pearl onions next time. Also, I will add a little more wine and thyme when I make it again though the sauce was great as written. The crust is a fabulous! Will agree that it was time consuming to make, but worth every minute. I may try making either the filling or the crust the day before to break up the cooking time. Received rave reviews from my family and guests.

I've made this twice now and it's a wonderful fall and winter meal. It takes some time to make but well worth the effort. You can also make it ahead which is always nice. My 82 year old finicky friend said it was the best pot pie he's ever eaten. I may try adding 1/2 tsp. or so of red pepper flakes next time. It needs a little spicing-up in my opinion. Very yummy and impressive!

This is a good dish,but I will do a few things different next time. fist of all I used fresh potatos, fresh carrots and peas from a can. For the gravy I used yellow onion, fresh garlic, and thyme.this was a wonderfull combination.the things I will change are less thyme in the crust(it was a bit overbearing) and maybe a bit less in the gravy too. but most importantly I would start my gravy first. so it can cool while I cook the reast of the ingrediance. I also found that the crust can be made while you cook the chicken. it doesnt take that long. what takes long is it has to go in the fridge for half an hour. but this is worth the time.

This is one of my favorite meals. I've made it many times and always vary the ingredients based on what I have on hand. It's always wonderful. It gets raves from my family and guests. Even my daughter who shys away from chicken will eat it. I'd recommend that you always used the herb crust, as it seems to make the meal. I never use leek or turnips; instead I use spinach, potato and mushrooms. This is the best pot pie I've ever had.

Wow - just made this for the first time this Sunday, and just finished the last bite today. Easy to do (albeit time consuming). Used purple potatoes instead of turnips, baby spinach instead of greens, and added sauted shitakes. The crust is wonderful. Quick question - does anyone have a suggestion on how to freeze this? Make filling and freeze that, adding crust later?

My fiance says this is the 'best thing I've ever had' and insists that I make it for guests. I make individual pies for guests with their initial on top instead of a leaf. Everyone loves it -- and I have even fed it to children of guests. They mostly pick out the chicken, but still, it's rare to be able to feed discriminating (European) adults as well as their children who really only like ketchup.

This is a really great recipe. I substituted parsnips for the turnips and that worked out great.

I've made this once before but didn't have the time to make the crust. I used a box of cornbread mix (prepped right off the box according to spoon bread) and put that on top. Raves all around! Also a little nutmeg in the sauce is wonderful.

This pot-pie had the whole family drooling! It was wonderful and I thank previous reviewers for tips on adding other veggies. I do not like turnips, so substituted potatoes, substituted baby spinach and added celery and mushrooms. The herb crust really makes the dish. One note -- double or triple wash the spinach! I made the crust on Friday, the filling on Saturday and then put the two together on Sunday and this was a fabulous Sunday Birthday dinner for Dad.

This is one of my most favorite things to make in the fall. The preparation is a bit consuming, but the dish is just so wonderful. I have fed many large groups on this pie. I love the crust so much that one time I tried to double it. Bad idea, made the crust too heavey instead of light and wonderful. Outstanding!

This is one of the few 4-fork ratings I have awarded a recipe. I made this when the the fall issue first came out in 1999 and have made it at least 7 times since. It is absolutely delish and looks spectacular. I do the leaf cut outs and brush the entire top with an egg wash. People just love this...true comfort food. I also add a stick or two of carrots and a large celery stalk. I also use spinach instead of turnip greens as it is easier. I used greens the first time and couldn't taste them. Plus the spinach retains a nicer color. I also use a small turnip and a large potato. The last time I added a bunch of fresh green beans (cut into 1/2 pieces) that I had lying around. Make this -- you'll love it. The crust is wonderful. I wouldn't use a store bought. Take the time...have a glass of wine and cook away! Bon Appetite!

My husband and I love this pot pie! I almost always vary the vegetables to accomodate what's good at the market or on hand, but I always make the sauce verbatim. It is sooo tasty. And its still good with a store-bought pie crust on top.

I needed a recipe to use some leftover turkey and steamed veggies (brocolli, carrots, zucchini) that I had. I followed the recipe for the sauce, threw in the turkey and veggies and used a store bought crust. It was delicious!! The sauce really makes this recipe. This freezes really well. I plan on trying the recipe the way it was intended soon.

This chicken pot pie recipe has become a Halloween Eve tradition at our home. Just pop it in the open while the children and guests trick or treat and then serve it with a toss salad. The children love it and there is no need for dessert. Freezes ahead nicely.

I liked the sauce to this pie but I would change the vegetables in it the next time. I tried parsnips since I don't care for turnips. Next time I will try potatoes and celery. I used baby spinach leaves in place of turnip greens. I will do that again. Also,I used 2 leeks and that was more than enough. Crust was very good.

Fantabulous! I didn't use the wine since (or the turnips) I didn't have any in the house... I just used broth and cream and I must say it turned out better then any pot pie I've had so far. The leeks gave it a great taste!

This is a great comfort food type of dish. I used turkey leftovers and canned broth, so it probably took a little less time to prepare. I also didn't have fresh thyme or parsley, so I used dried parsley and dried rosemary. It was stellar.

I am quite positive that this recipe yields a four fork rating if prepared properly. However, unfortunately, I took the liberty of adding extra liquid to the pot pie. This was a huge mistake because the beautifully speckled herb crust sunk like the Titanic into the depths of the pot pie. I attempted a rescue mission by pouring out some of the pot pie's liquid midway through its cooking time. Regrettably, I lost the delicious cream sauce. I will definitely try this recipe again, but, I will follow the directions. Some changes that I made were to add some new potatoes to the turnips and peas instead of turnip greens. The color of the peas became bland so I would not use them again. Also, I used chives and thyme for the herbs. My boyfriend liked the pot pie but did not love it.

We have had this delicious pot pie twice now and it is definitely the best recipe I have tried. I have used puff pastry both times but will try the herb crust next time. The sauce is superb!! My children ask for this dish.

This is a great recipe! I added parsnips in place of the turnip and also used spinach in place of the greens. The sauce was great (add more wine!)and the leftovers froze well. The pastry was well worth the work and I liked the melt-in-the-mouth texture. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely wonderful -- I've made a lot of pot pies and this is the best yet. Because my kids won't eat anything with green specks I skipped the thyme and it still had lots of rich flavor. Additionally, I substituted light cream for whipping -- didn't miss the extra fat one bit. I also topped the dish with puff pastry as a shortcut and thought it was fine, but it didn't add much. If I don't have time to make the herb crust next time, I'll just serve the chicken mixture over slices of French bread and skip the pastry altogether.

Fabulous comfort food! I also added potatoes as well as peas to make a more traditional pot pie. The herb crust is fabulous. We usually make individual pot pies rather than one big one and freeze the extra.

A VERY tasty sauce--I recommend the recipe, with a few substitutions; I used carrots (3), celery (3 stalks), mushrooms (8 oz.), and onion (1/2) for my filling. My sauce needed a bit more wine. The crust however was too 'short' in my opinion, disolving in the mouth (too much shortening)--and it turned green due to the parsley. Next time I will use a traditional pie dough recipe, with the addition of 2 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme. It is a time-consuming endeavor, but worth it, especially if you double the recipe so you can freeze one pie for another time!

We love this. We have a 16 year old and his friends always want to stay for dinner if I am making this. I have prepared the herb crust, however my husband and son like the contents better so I substitute frozen puff pastry and it can be prepared pretty quickly( the night before)

Used potato in place of turnip and spinach in place of greens. Excellent recipe! The herb crust makes it. Don't substitute, and cooking the chicken and making the crust a day before was wonderful suggestion.

Time-consuming but well worth it. The herb crust was exquisite. Especially surprising and absolutely delicious were the turnips. Very tasty!

I've made this dish twice. I substituted a bag of baby spinach for the turnip greens... also added an 8 oz. pkg. of fresh mushrooms. The herb crust melts in your mouth and really adds do the recipe.

This does take a long time to prepare. I did it over three consecutive evenings- crust the first night, filling the second, then, the evening of my company, I justhad to put it all together and bake. Delicious! Next time I'll increase the vegetables and decrease the amount of chicken.

This recipe was delicious, but I'll never make it again because of how time consuming it was. I was in the kitchen for HOURS. By the time it came out of the oven, I didn't care what it would taste like. I was just ready for bed.

This recipe is fantastic! I made it last night for dinner for my fiance and myself, and a friend just happened to come by to visit. The pie got RAVE reviews from both of them. I took the tips about using the store bought pie crusts, and using more cream in lieu of wine...I also used potatoes and carrots, and it was fabulous!

Well, I cheated a bit, using Pillsbury pie crust. I just through in various things in for the filling like carrots, potatoes, broccoli, cabbage, onion, and whole cloves of garlic -- but followed the recipe for the sauce. Yum!

I made this dish in the fall for a small dinner party and I can honestly say it got rave reviews! The vegetables were crunchy, the crust was delicious and it was beautiful to look at!

Add the wine and herbs to the poaching broth before paoching to intensify the flavor. Tarragon and garlic are terrific additions and you need lots of fresh-cracked pepper. I used raddichio intead of the greens. I'm not really sure that you need the heavy cream....

Great worth every moment of preparation, the leftovers were even better the next day. I used the baby spinach instead of the turnip greens and the all butter herb crust. A bottle of "Toasted Head" Chardonnay was the perfect compliment. My 15 month old loved those carrots and tender chicken.

I've made this several times. The sauce is delicious! I skipped the suggested crust and used a store bought. I double the recipe and cook them in individual dishes and freeze for later-much better than the store bought frozen dinner kind.

Excellent! Absolute comfort food with a gourmet twist.

The whole family loves this recipe. It can be made in a variety of ways. I substituted spinach and potatoes for the turnips in one dish and peas and potatoes for the turnips in another. My daughter substituted herb dumplings for the crust at another time. Either way the dish is absolutely delicious.

Flavorful blend of fall's best. The herbed crust with leaf shape cutouts was a handsome touch. The family loved it!

Great comfort food! I used potatoes instead of turnips, added mushrooms and used a cup of cream in lieu of white wine. I also used all butter in the herb crust, and replaced the parsley with rosemary. I'll definitely make this one again!

Absolutely delicious comfort food! The turnips gave it a flavor with depth, and although we substituted kale for the greens (couldn't get that day) it delighted our dinner guests. The herb crust adds zing.

I was very proud to serve this delicious (and beautiful-the herbs in the pastry look so nice) pot pie for a casual Sunday dinner with friends.

This was a time consuming but well worth the effort recipe. It certainly beats canned soup and vegetables. I did not however, use canned stock. The recipe seemed to good to spoil it with canned broth.

A fabulous fall/winter weather dish. The ultimate comfort food. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. The crust is flaky with good flavor and the filling is a delicious blend of flavors. A little time consuming to make, but worth the effort. I made it in two casseroles and froze one - 6 weeks later it was just as good!

Amazing. I'm not a big turnip fan so I replaced the turnip with potato and the greens with spinach. Surprisingly, the spinach didn't turn that awful over-cooked color. Crust is absolutely to die for. I used all butter and it was still very flaky.

I made some changes to the recipe because I wanted a more traditional chiken pot pie. I used potatoes instead of turnips, peas instead of turnip greens, and left out the leeks. We loved it. My husband said it is probably the best chicken pot pie he has ever had. The filling, sauce and crust are all really good.
