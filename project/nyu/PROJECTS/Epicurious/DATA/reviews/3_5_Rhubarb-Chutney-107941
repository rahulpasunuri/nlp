Does this recipe freeze well? Thank you.

By boiling the syrup mixture a little longer I avoided the need for any thickening agents

The flavors in this are realy nice. I cut my rhubarb about 1/2 inch and in 4 mins it was over cooked. Really watch it the carry-over cooking killed it. But it's really tasty with pork loin.

Wow! This recipe makes a lot of chutney, but that's a good thing. Everyone asked for the recipe, so we were able to send it home with them accompanied with a small jar. I did add a bit of cornstarch as others suggested, and it was just perfect. This will be a go-to over baked cheese, or with pork or poultry.

I can't wait to try this recipe. I had rhubarb chutney over heirloom tomatoes at a little cafe in the Adirondacks run by a retired chef. He grew his own rhubarb and tomatoes in the backyard. It was a taste I have never forgotten. Try it this summer for something totally wonderful.

This just an excellent recipe! We served it with pork tenderloin, both hot and cold. This will definitely be a family favorite.

A very yummy chutney! I added a little cornstarch since some reviews suggested a thickener. Next time I might try using 3/4 the amount of sugar. I served it over a small wheel of heated brie. It was "to die for!"

excellent. I served it with a ham steak I threw on the grill and it was a perfect match. I doubled the ginger and I would cut the sugar to a scant cup.

This was really nice. I used cranberries instead of currants and served it with lamb and I'm sure it would be great with ham as suggested in the original recipe. Be careful not to overcook the rhubarb (which I did) or it will become a mushy brown mess that tastes good but doesn't look anything like the picture that accompanies the ham recipe.

Excellent flavors!! I actually omitted the currents and used strawberries in their place. It gives it a great Springtime/Summertime flavor. I served the chutney with grilled boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Everyone at my dinner party absolutely loved it and everyone requested the recipe. This has become a Spring/Summer menu favorite in our house.

Perfect accompaniment to ham. Everyone at Easter dinner loved it and had second helpings. Didn't change anything in the recipe.

This was an amazing hit with the ham at Easter. I'm making it again for New Year's Eve. I'm going to try 1/2 craisins and 1/2 raisins this time around, and add a little arrowroot. Be aware it makes A LOT. Thanks for the suggestions.

This chutney is amazing. The flavors are incredible, and they all manage to come through in their own way. Since several reviewers had mentioned the chutney came out runny, I added arrowroot during the cooking as a thickener, which seemed to get us to exactly the right consistency- juicy, but not sloppy liquid. My mother-in-law requested this as her next birthday present!

I love Rhubard chutneys and have made many over the years. I like my chutney a little more firm also. I substituted 1/2 of the currents for craisins and used boiling onions instead. If you like the chutney to be a little firmer, mix all but rhubarb, onions & craisin/currants. Parboil about 1/2-2/3's cup boing onions til the skins will slip off easily. Blanch in cold water to stop cooking, cut in half. Add 1/2 of the onions & cook with rest of the mixture for about 10 minutes. Add rest of onions and cook 5 more minutes. Add rhubarb and the craisins/currants and cook for another 5 minutes or so, don't let rhubarb get mushy. In this adaptation the boiling onions will seperate into half ringlets and some will be softer and some crunchier. It makes for a nice texture with sweet ham. The Honey-Glazed Bunny rolls on this website are not only adorable, but are soft as pillows and rich and eggy. Look in Easter Recipes.

This tastes great with ham, but the recipe, which I followed exactly, results in a runny and ugly chutney. The ugly part came primarily from the green scallions, which turned an unappetizing dark color and served no useful purpose. The instructions didn't say to use the white part only, but clearly ought to. Better yet, use shallots. There was also an unattractive look to the currants; they turned into little black balls that looked out of place against the rhurbarb. I would be inclined to omit them if I make this again, perhaps substituting something else, such as the cranberries another cook suggested. The cranberries would have the added benefit of adding a thickener, which the recipe needs. Although it thickens up somewhat when it rests in the refrigerator, it is too runny even when cold. Moreover, the instructions say to serve it at room temperature, which makes it rather soupy. It needs either less liquid or a thickening agent. It's worth working with, though, because it is really, really tasty.

Chutney is delicious. I added 1/4 t mustard seed. I did not have cardamom, so I used 1/4 t cumin, 1/8 t. smoked paprika, 1/8 t. mace and 1/4t. coriander. Not really substitutes, but flavors I have liked in other chutneys. Try it on a tea sandwich with cream cheese or on a rustic bread with ham and brie. Great with a spicy curry chicken salad.

I love rhubarb and this is really yummy. I did have to substitute the currents for dried mixed berries but it was still good. Great with the ham and I think it will be great on a sandwich too.

This was good the first day, but much better the 2nd.

I made this to accompany a simple baked ham for Easter lunch - the adults in the family enjoyed it very much, while the children eyed it suspiciously. I love eating it by itself. I wonder how it would taste over vanilla ice cream...

I also substituted cranberries and found it to be a very nice sweet, yet tart, flavor. This will be a regular side for ham or a nice roast pork loin!

Very, very good - an interesting combination of flavors that's easy to make and not overpowering! It complemented the ham perfectly. Had to sub. raisins for the currants and frozen rhubarb for the fresh, but didn't change anything else. A keeper!

This was a major hit at my recent party. Everyone wanted the recipe. I used dried cranberries instead of currents to enhance the tartness to play against the sweet pork glaze.
