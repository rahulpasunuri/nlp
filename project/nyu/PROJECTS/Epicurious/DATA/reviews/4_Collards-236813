I am from the Pacific Northwest and had never even seen a collard before we got some with our CSA share (I had to ask what they were). So, I do not have the real "legit" advice, BUT I followed this recipe as closely as I could. I am not really sure what a ham hock is (sorry - dumb I guess) and the grocery store didn't seem to have them, or I wasn't looking in the right place, so I tripled the bacon and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We had visitors from Virginia and they said they were surprised to see me cooking collards. I told them I had no idea what I was doing and they said they looked and tasted right - yay! I, personally, couldn't stop eating them. I could eat an entire plate of these for dinner alone. Yum!!

This was my grandmother signature dish. I loved her collard greens. I never got her recipe but could remember the ingredients. I was using the same ingredients but in the wrong order. I cook my greens with a ham hock but don't add onion. I was also cooking the bacon and pouring the bacon grease in after the greens were at a boil. Greens without bacon grease are not real greens. I will try it this way next time I cook collard greens.

Amazing. This is how collards were meant to be. Followed the recipe exactly. I didn't really see what the big deal was about the smell, it just smelled like my grandma's kitchen growing up. And that is always a good thing. This will be my new staple recipe for collards.

With all due respect to Bill, people who don't like the smell of collards cooking probably won't like collards--and four pecans in the pot ain't gonna make that dog hunt--or smell like a rose. As a southerner--and a fan of collards, I'd recommend skipping Bill's bacon shortcut and going instead with a few smoked ham hocks, in a big pot of water, simmered for a few hours, until the meat on hocks is fork tender. Remove the hocks, add the collards to the pot and cook for two hours. When the hocks are cool enough to handle, remove the meat and any fat, chop the meat coarsely and put the fat in a saute pan over medium high heat. Add one chopped medium onion--as the onions soften, add the chopped meat and stir frequently until the meat and onions are just starting to brown. Remove the collards from the pot liquor with a slotted spoon, drain in a colander and then chop and add to the meat and onions in saute pan, stir to blend, sprinkle on a few drops of vinegar. Save the pot liquor to cook your black eyed peas in

I really enjoy the simplicity of this recipe. No fooling with sugar or vinegar. The sweetness of the onions and the smokiness of the bacon cut the bitterness of the collards completely out. I have made this recipe several times and have been pleased with the results.

Want to thank Cook from Atlanta for the Collard Greens with Red Onion and Bacon recommendation. I AM from the south (Atlanta actually), and these were absolutely the best collards I have ever had-they have this terrific tanginess to them which completely overrides the bitterness that you can get from them. As someone who always likes to try different recipes, I think this one might be it where collards are concerned. I made them with Emeril's Smoked Sausage and Black- Eyed Peas recipe...what a great start to the year!

The best collards I have ever had is another recipe on this site: http://www.epicuriou s.com/recipes/food/v iews/13471. I am not from the south, but live in Atlanta now and have made this recipe to rave Southern reviews. In case the link does not work, it is the Collard Greens with Red Onion and Bacon - highly recommended!!!

As a Southern, I can say that this is the way collards are meant to be
