I have so many of this type of recipe (for side dish, brunch, etc) but decided to try anyway bc I love love love zucchini. Followed the suggestions by other reviewers and didn't steam first and loved the texture it gave. Also used wheat bread crumbs bc that's what I had on hand and added extra cheese bc I love cheese. Next time I will grate with food processor instead of chopping (so smaller pieces) and bake in full size muffin tins. YUM

This recipe is a 4-star if the zucchini not steamed first, but rather put in the food process and then left on a towel to drain for a bit. I also added extra cheese, but that's just because I love cheese.

I thought the taste was great (although I admit to adding double the amount of parmesan). Next time I would skip the steaming & mashing and just put the zucchini in the food processor instead. Since it will be in the oven for 45 minutes, I don't think it's necessary to precook the vegetables. My guests requested this recipe, so it was a hit!

I didn't care for the consistency (I'd prefer a firmer dish) but the flavors were nice. Although I've made better zucchini casseroles, my friend loved it and asked for the recipe.

This is one of most creative things I've seen done with zucchini. Even if there were several steps, it wasn't complicated and it didn't take a ton of time. And it was delicious. I was surprised by the texture, which I loved (reminded me of my mother's potato pie) but next time I will try it with just one egg to see if that gives it a harder consistency (like a brownie -- which is what I'd imagined).

To my taste, this was both fussy (nearly 30 minutes hands-on time and 4 cooking pans) for limited nutrition (zucchini). It did, however, taste good. I used 8 smallish zucchini, cut the butter to 2 T and substituted panko for fresh bread crumbs (which would have added still more time and the use of the food processor). I steamed the zucchini longer than suggested and had no trouble mashing them. Also had no trouble with the dried basil (what I had on hand) which IS unusual. What I liked most about this was that I could make it with ingredients I typically have on hand.

I made this for Thanksgiving and for a homeless shelter meal....and it was loved by all. Now I am making it for a potluck. It is easy and very good.

LOVE zucchini and with the bumper crop this summer was looking for a differnt way to prepare. It was difficult to mash the zucchini like the recipe requires. Next time I will cook and quickly pulse in the food processor. Will also use more zucchini, these squares were a little flat and could have used more density.

Good way to use extra summer zucchini and basil. And very tasty...we even enjoyed it cold.

There was no leftovers when I made this dish. It was great with the freshly grated parmesan cheese I used. Definitely will make this again for my family!

Very Good! An excellent side dish for a holiday or any day. Next time I will try more herbs along with the basil.

Disappointing, especially after the great reviews it received from other cooks.

I loved this recipe. I modifed it by replacing some of the parmesan with asiago cheese.

This delicious recipe is ridiculously easy to make. I made it for someone who didn't like zucchini and they loved it. I imagine that it would taste just as good with squash.

Since my family is vegetarian (and this includes 2 teenagers) I'm always searching for new ways to make zucchini. This reminded me of a zucchini dish from an Italian cookbook: it was delectable! My only suggestion would be to be sure, when you steam the zucchini, that the outside is also tender...otherwise it makes for difficult mashing with a fork, as the recipe directs.

The only way I can get my family to eat zucchini!
