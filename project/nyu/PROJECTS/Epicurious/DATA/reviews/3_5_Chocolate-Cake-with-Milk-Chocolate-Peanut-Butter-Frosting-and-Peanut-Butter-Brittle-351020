I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about the cake for this. I thought my cake came out moist and tasted very good, but I also used cake flour instead of regular flour, and the crumb texture was very nice. However, my issue was with the frosting. After I put together the powdered sugar, heavy cream, and mascarpone, it was like soup! There was way too much heavy cream. I ended up adding almost an extra cup of powdered sugar to thicken it along with a bit extra peanut butter. I don't recommend letting the cake sit at room temperature too long in the summer as I frosted the cake and left it out, and the frosting melted slightly down the sides of the cake.

I have a very similar recipe like this but I use gluten-free cake mix for the cake layers w/c actually tastes very chocolatey and moist. For the frosting I double the amount of peanut butter (regular smooth kind). I'm a baker in a restaurant and this cake always gets raves from our customers!

Waaaaaaaay too sweet. Blech. Couldn't even finish one piece. Kids loved it.

This is a great recipe. The cake was easy and turned out nice and moist. I didn't use as much of the brittle as called for because I didn't want to over power the cake. The frosting turned out beautifully.

After I made several modifications, this recipe was fantastic! I added 2 eggs and a 1 1/4c cocoa powder to the cake batter, which made it incredibly moist and very chocolaty. Using regular instead of natural peanut butter and quadrupling the quantity of PB in the frosting turned a bland, insipid frosting into a "decadent delight" (quote from a dinner quest). As a side-bar, use a candy thermometer to make sure you've cooked the brittle long enough, the recommended 10 minutes wasn't enough on my stove. If you really want to give the cake a wow-factor, double the amount of peanut brittle and ganache, cut the 2 layers in half to make it a 4- layer cake. When frosted press the brittle into top of the cake, but also onto the side so it covers the bottom 1/3 of the cake and drizzle chocolate ganache over the top/sides of the cake. Yum!!

Since the cake part of this cake seemed to get pretty dismal reviews, I used one of my stand by chocolate cake recipes for that part, but followed this recipe for the ganache/ brittle/ frosting. All I have to say is: The frosting is the SHIT. Best peanut butter frosting I ever had!

I made this cake and everyone very much loved it but I also thought the recipie for the layers looked weird so used the layers that go with the milk chocolate cake (searched for chocolate layers on this site) which were fantastic. My chef friend has requested this for his birthday cake it's that good.

I made this cake twice, it was super easy to make especially the icing. Both times it came out picture perfect. I agree the chocolate cake wasn't memorable but the icing and the brittle made up for it big time.

The cakes themselves were nothing special -- moist enough, but not super chocolatey. Kind of plain. The peanut butter frosting was AWESOME though (not grainy at all) and the brittle was great too. I will definitely make the frosting again, but will find a different chocolate cake to lather it on.

Made this for my boss's birthday and it was a HUGE hit. I loved the icing. The mascarpone gave it a really different flavor. I've made the chocolate cake (or something very close to it) for years. It's a very simple recipe, but I haven't found anything to beat it yet -- very moist.

OK, I really hate it when people start altering recipes, but after the first two reviews I opted to use a store bought devil's food cake mix. The ganache, frosting and brittle I followed exactly and it turned out to be one of the best cakes ever. My daughter requested it for her birthday and it was a HIT!

What a disappointment! I had such high hopes for this cake. The cake itself was terrible. The frosting was OK, but the brittle was excellent.

The eggless cake layers were just okay. Nothing particularly good. The peanut butter frosting was bland and grainy. The natural peanut butter I used met the recipe specifications but it didn't work in the finished product.
