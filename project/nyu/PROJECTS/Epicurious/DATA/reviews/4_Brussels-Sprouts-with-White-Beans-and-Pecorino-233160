I thought this sounded really tasty, but it was just okay. The beans were pretty bland. Might be good with some tweaking - like cooking the beans longer to pick up more flavor. Might also try cooking with a little bit of ham or sausage, and adding a little cayenne or red pepper flakes to brighten it up.

I've tried three different brussel sprout recipes from epicurious this winter: this one, brussel sprouts and carrots, and the kale and brussel sprout salad. This is the best.

Oh! Forgot to add that I skipped the butter on many previous reviewers' suggestion (thanks, you were right!) and used white northern beans instead of cannellini. Again, made no difference--still tasted great!

This was a fantastic addition to our Thanksgiving table. We are vegetarian and don't particularly like the taste of store-bought broths, so I just used water. I also used Romano cheese to save a little $. Neither choice made a bit of difference. The dish was delicious. Would definitely make again!

This recipe is wonderful - I really look forward to making it each year when the weather turns cold. However, as written it is missing two things that to my palate elevate it from good to great - pork and spice. I start by frying some chopped bacon, then use some of the bacon grease to fry the brussels sprouts. I skip the butter and add red chili pepper flakes to finish. The creaminess of the beans and cheese, the bitterness of the sprouts, and the salty smokiness of the bacon are a truly magical combination!

This recipe is a delicious starting point but over time I've made a few alterations that, I think, really make it a star. I brown diced pancetta in the pan first and then brown the brussles sprouts. I basically follow the recipe from there except I add chopped sun-dried tomato with the garlic and then fresh oregano and the crispy pancetta at the end with the cheese. My family can't get enough!

Wow. I've made it my mission to try as many sprouts recipes this winter as I can. Oven-roasted recipes had an edge until last night. At a dinner for 10, an arm-wrestling match was held to see who got the beans, sprouts and cheese that were still stuck to the serving spoon. This recipe was voted Best Brussels Sprouts of 2012. Goes great with chicken.

I understand when people get upset after reviewing a recipe not followed but sometimes those reviews are the best, because they give you additional ideas. Ive eaten shredded Brussell Sprouts with Pecorino in Italian restaurants and loved them, but then I love brussies almost anyway. After returning from a week out of town at a conference to an empty fridge, I liked the idea of adding a little chicken to this recipe and making it a one-dish meal. Basically following the recipe, I sautéed the sprouts (adding a little sweet onion and sage as previously suggested) and set aside. I then sautéed some (quickly defrosted) boneless chicken thighs (courtesy of Costco) in olive oil adding the garlic. I added the white beans, stock and then the shredded brussies. I added Parmesan Reggiano cheese and served alone (hubbie had a roasted sweet potato). Delightful! And dare I say pretty healthy?

A remarkable recipe for brussels sprouts. Just delicious, and even better the next day. I would say the cheese is a must. Yum!

We love this recipe and have shared it with many non-brussel sprout lovers. It's a meal in itself. At the time you saute the garlic, we add 1/2 red onion, 2 Tbsps of fresh sage and pepper to taste. AMAZINGLY SIMPLE & FILLING.

I enjoyed this recipe... but having had a brussel sprout recipe with blue cheese, lemon & walnuts last week... this pales!

This is one of my absolute favorite ways to prepare brussels sprouts. You can reduce the amount of butter slightly, and it's still delicious. I use Parmesan cheese instead of the Pecorino because I always have it on hand. I have used a cast iron skillet, and a stainless steal and they both work fantastically. Delicious!

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving and LOVED it! I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was a bit heavy for a large traditional Thanksgiving meal, but I have made it a number of times since then and it is always a big hit. It is my new favorite "go to" side dish, as long as I can find fresh sprouts. Made with sprouts still on the stalk: amazing! I have used other Italian cheeses besides the difficult to find pecorino toscano, and they have worked fine.

Brussels sprouts are wonderful on their own, but this recipe adds a richness that is very satisfying. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a little richer than needed when paired with all the other dishes, but a great recipe for a non-holiday night.

This was a fantastic recipe! I was out of broth so I just used water and cut back on the oil/butter...it seems like you can really play with this and it will work. I'm glad I made this super easy dish!

I love brussel sprouts, white beans, garlic and pecorino so figured this recipe would be great. Sorry to say it was a big disappointment. I thought it was just a gloppy mess when it was done so just fished out the sprouts. Will not make this again, but recommend shredding the brussel sprouts and woking them with garlic, pancetta and pine nuts. Heavenly!

Rating: 4
Yep, I have tried a bunch of brussel sprout recipes and this beats them all...even the one with tons of bacon (and that's hard to beat). I do recommend letting them simmer in the broth longer than recommended so they soften. If you follow the recipe exactly they will be crunchy and there is NOTHING worse than undercooked brussel sprouts.

This recipe is a must - it's so delicious. It's been a big hit with everyone we've made this for, even people that don't care for brussel sprouts that much. The combination with the beans is perfect. I also have used vegeterian broth for certain friends, still fabulous. The pecorino is a great addition.

Rating: 4
Very simply, make this recipe: so easy and pleasing to prepare (the bright greening of the sprouts!, the sizzling sounds upon the addition of broth, and more) and a savory and sophisticated (yet comfort-food like) flavour. As a vegetarian, I use vegetable broth; I also cut the butter (no need). A recipe with tremendous returns for a simple investment. I wish I knew more recipes so good.

Wow. I absolutely loved this recipe - I can't believe it's taken me 4 years to try it. I used less olive oil than stated and skipped the butter all together, as we're trying to detox after the holidays - but I still found it be satisfying and delicious. This is an easy weeknight vegetarian supper, but would also be a great side dish for a dinner party. If I wanted to gild the lily, I would add some bacon. and next time, I'm going to try an aged hard cheese, like grana parmesan.

I've been making this recipe for a few years and love it. Have also altered it a bit and always cut back on the fat. I use very little oil and often will skip the butter altogether or just add a small pat. Today, I added chopped roasted tomatoes that were in the fridge - awesome.

I made this recipe several years ago after discovering I kind of liked Brussel Sprouts (hated them for 32 years). The first time followed recipe fairly close and fell madly in love since them I have improvised many ways.. outstanding basic recipe. Sometimes I add a bit of white wine, cured meat(salami etc) and fiddle with the ratio of sprouts to beans. I usually have Locatelli in the fridge so I use that, very seldom use any butter and I don't measure much, but I am sure I do not use 8tblsps. I like my greens cooked a bit so I simmer a bit longer. If you haven't tried this... you should.This really isn't a side dish, build your menu around it. Amazing.

I am not a fan of brussels sprouts, but I LOVE this dish! The richness of the beans and cheese is a great compliment to the slightly bitter and funky flavor of the brussels sprouts. The texture contrast is good too. It's great as is, but over the years I have modified it to increase the amount of beans relative to the brussels sprouts. This makes it into a hearty vegetarian main course. I currently use two 15-oz cans of beans to one pound of brussels sprouts.

Rating: 4
I love this hearty, peasant-style dish. For a vegetarian it's a complete delicious meal in a pan. The cheese really makes it and I use veggie broth instead of chicken broth. I've used plain old parmesan from the grocery store and it's still great. Sometimes the cheese integrates with the juices and makes almost a cream sauce and other times the cheese kinda clumps up. I'm not sure why... I don't like to cook the sprouts as hot as recommended because it burns the outer leaves so doesn't look or taste as good that way. Just scale it back a little to get more of a roasting effect. Also, I just press the garlic and that works fine.

Rating: 4
This dish was really fantastic. I brought it to a potluck holiday dinner, it traveled well and is even good when it's room temperature. I used parmesan because that's what I had on hand, and used my large cast iron skillet which browned the sprouts perfectly. This has become my go-to brussels sprouts recipe.

Really easy to make and delicious, too. I threw in a handful of pine nuts along with the garlic, it added a nice textural element. Also I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. Will definately make it again.

Rating: 3
Wonderfully easy and seriously delicious. I was concerned about this being texturally too homogeneous, but the sprouts stay surprisingly crisp while the beans fall apart and make them creamy. (I would, however, suggest quartering all but the smallest sprouts in order to avoid having to cook them for a long time to soften them sufficiently.) Also, the dish does not suffer if you omit the butter, as I did.

Rating: 4
so good and so easy! everyone was suprised and impressed - it was as if none of us had never had good brussels sprouts before! the butter isn't necessary and the cheese adds all the salt and good flavor that's needed. oh, and the leftovers (should there be any) are soooo good!

This was really good! I made the mistake of over salting. The cheese has plenty of salt. The recipe reminds me of escarole and beans. Next time I'll salt less and add red pepper flakes with the garlic.

This recipe is fantastic...I made it straight out of Bon Appetit three years ago, and we've had it for Thanksgiving ever since. That was the first big meal I ever prepared for my family & it got rave reviews - VERY gourmet for my midwestern family who are used to overcooked veggies! I have since cut back on the oil a bit, which makes it even tastier. Also, make sure to really brown the sprouts; it helps create a great caramelized flavor.

Rating: 3
I think I overcooked the beans because I accidently dropped the sprouts and beans in at the same time. But, the dish still turned out pretty tasty (fresh brussel sprouts from the farmer's market!). I added some smoked paprika for an alternative flavor and left out the cheese/butter.

I tried this recipe for the first time for Christmas dinner in 2006. I hoped my picky nephews would eat it because of the cheese, but, lo and behold, they liked the brussels sprouts! All 3 generations gave me rave reviews (I'm not really a very good cook, so that was fun!) My friends have all given me similar raves in the half dozen times I've made this dish since, and I love it, but this is a dish for a crowd. As a single person I have leftovers for a week.I didn't change anything from the original recipe. If you can, get FRESH brussels sprouts - not so easy to find in Northern CA - you'll notice the difference.

I will be making this again to serve over pasta, or with a mixed whole grain, as the entre. Tonight it went with pork chops and sweet potatos. We are Bsprout fans, and I find l like steam/saute preps most of all. What a nice addition to my Bsprout repetoire. I had 3/4 lb Bsprouts, cleaned and quartered, and halved all the other ingredients, except for the stock used as needed. Left over mixed Mexi shredded cheese went in at the end. Not bad. Next time I'll go for gruyere or Jarlsberg.

I served this with Thanksgiving in order to jazz up the veg part of the menu. Holy cow was it good! In my rush to get the food out I changed the recipe a bit with great results. I had just sauteed a few pounds of wild mushrooms in butter & herbs, and instead of tossing out the gorgeous broth I cooked the sprouts in the mushroom jus. It was devine!

I thought this was great. I agree with previous reviewers not to skimp on the cheese; it really makes it. I also sprinkled the dish with some chopped bacon for color, flavor, and an extra texture (and to encourage sprout haters to give the dish a shot). I might add some more beans for myself in the future, but my sister, who hates white beans, appreciated that the bean was primarily there to make the dish a little heartier - which it did beautifully. Most people went back for seconds.

We were pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I was a skeptic--I don't love white beans, and my boyfriend's not keen on brussel sprouts, but we had to use them up--but the reviews sold me, and they were on the ball. Great, unusual dish. We had it as an entree, but it would work well as a base for fish or meat, too.

Yum! Great way to get brussels sprouts into your body. I like them anyway, but this recipe made them even better. Think of it as pasta with beans and cheese, but instead of pasta, it's brussels sprouts. Much healthier, and more interesting, too. Will definitely make again.

I'm not normally a huge brussels sprouts fan but this was a lovely, savoury way to deal with the mid-winter glut & there was not a leaf left over. The texture of the beans makes a nice foil to the crisp veg & I found the stock made it quite rich enough without needing to add the extra butter and cheese. A small grating of pecorino might be nice but it's not necessary.

This was a BIG hit - and I'd like to give it three and one-half forks (I think a 4-fork rating should render me speechless and lightheaded with joy). Since I was cooking for a smaller crowd, I halved the recipe and so spending the initial time sauteing the sprouts wasn't a chore, but if I were cooking for a larger crowd, I might roast them as another cook suggested.

Great Save! I found out late that I needed to bring a green vegetable to Thanksgiving and didn't want to make the usual green bean casserole so I tried this. I quartered the brussels sprouts and let them go just a bit longer than the recipe said. Their texture was perfect! I used fresh parmigiano reggiano instead of the pecorino, and it lent the veggies a fantastic flavor! Definitely goes into the family cookbook

We also got good reviews. Mine came out a bit too garlicky, we had big cloves and I did cut back but apparently not enough. I also put the sprouts in microwave for 3 minutes before I started cooking them according to the recipe and they came out just right. Still bright green but done.

I made these Brussels sprouts for an office luncheon and it was a real crowd-pleaser (how often do you see "Brussels sprouts" and "crowd-pleaser" in the same sentence?). The one recommendation I would make is that, if in fact you are able to locate a very "young" pecorino, grate it directly over the sprouts. Unlike your usual run-of-the-mill grated pecorino (which is like parmesan), "young" pecorino is soft and delicate, a bit like mozzarella (but even softer). If you grate it into a pile, it's just going to clump together, which makes it very hard to distribute throughout the dish. I bet you could use a not-so-young pecorino and get away with it.

Rating: 3
Quite a different preparation with the beans--very mild, tasty and filling. I cut the sprouts into quarters so that more surface area would be browned in an attempt to erase the 'typical' cabbage-y aspect of the sprouts (that also made the sprouts approximately the same size as the cannellini beans I used). Use a broad skillet or saute pan (12" would be a good size); I used a 3-qt. saucier and had to remove the sprouts/beans with a slotted spoon in order to get the broth to cook down to a glaze (since the sprouts will release their own water in cooking). Also, definitely use a rich, flavorful cheese.
