I have to agree with the previous reviewers. I decided to make this recipe because I happened to have all of the ingrediants on hand (I also substituted canned crab meat). I love Asian dishes, especially recipes with bold ingrediants, such as ginger as a main ingrediant. But ginger did little to pep this one up for me. I think if I were to make it again, I would add garlic and hot oil and I would steam the broccoli first... not boil it. I found when boiled it was limp but still bitter.

Too much work. Too many greens. A waste of crabmeat, because you don't really taste it. Good crabmeat is so distinctive and so expensive, that it's taste should dominate any dish it is in.

This was a nice quick weekday meal. It made canned crabmeat taste decent. I have one quibble with the ingredient list though - it says to stir-fry with 2 1/4 teaspoons of oil - I went out on a limb and only used 2 tsp. I can't even imagine measuring out 2 1/4 tsp for stir-frying.
