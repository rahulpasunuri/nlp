Rigo Jancsi was a Hungarian vilinist in the 1800's who seduced a Belgian Countess who left her husband for him. The cake is absolutely Hungarian and does have a mousse-like chocolate-rum filling, no whipped cream with gelatin, though. A thin layer of chocolate mocha cake, then a very thick layer of cream filling, another thin cake layer then a chocolate ganache topping. The cake layers are imbued with a rum syrup. Usually a square cake cut into square portions. The best ever! The gentleman who lives in Hungary could not have missed it! Just walk into any of the wonderful pastry shops and have a feast!

In response to the writer from Hungary, while it may be true that there is no such thing as a Hungarian 'mousse cake' this recipe is very similar to one for Rigo Jancsi. Rigo Jancsi is a luscious dessert with roots in Hungary and Vienna. It is named after a gypsy violinist and has a very romantic story attached to it - you can look it up on the Internet. Rigo Jancsi is made of a rich, thick creamy chocolate filling sandwiched between sponge layers and iced with a dark chocolate fondant glaze.

Hi there. Whether you like this recipe or not, dont call it Hungarian. I live here, and mousse is not part of the cuisine here. So, this recipe is about as Hungarian as Dim Sum is Hungarian. Stick with the gulyas and for a great Hungarian cake, try an eszterhazy.

Sorry that my review was not clear- as this recipe is fabulous and the intent was just to make the mousse making process less time consuming. I did not suggest to mix the layers. I suggested to make the chocolate mousse layer the same way you make the whipped cream layer- with gelatin- as opposed to the suggested boiling- ice bath method. Adding gelatin to the chocolate and cream is merely a quicker method of getting the mousse to set (a typical European bakery method of mousse making for pastries). To make the chocolate mousse, simply follow the same steps that the recipe instructs for the whipped cream layer but take it a step further and add the melted chocolate that has been slightly cooled (Ive also used a high quality cocoa instead of melted chocolate and it works just as well- in fact I think it adds a more intense flavor) and whip as you would any whipping cream. Done. The mousse will set up firmly and will not weep or melt into the cake, because of the added use of gelatin. Not only is this less time consuming, but for the novice mousse maker it is much, much easier.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always perfect. I do divide the whipped cream up into separate bowls to flavor and color them with flavors like raspberry, coffee and mint. Very pretty to have an assortment!

I too followed the advice with the spring form pan. It increased the baking time and then the cake fell as it cooled. However, it was still very good and relatively easy to work with. I also tried the suggestion of the last reviewer and found their suggestions to be vague and not very helpful, esp since I've never made a mousse before. It reads as if you're to mix the mousse and the whipped cream layers and that did not work. But, being frustrated that cake didnt turn out after about 5 hours of work, I put the "mousse" in the fridge and after a while it firmed up and turned out to be pretty dang good. So I threw it on the cake and am now finally able to enjoy it. If you've not made mousse before, perhaps do a practice run first. Oh, and I also added the 10 oz of apricot glaze and it was a great suggestion. I think any less glaze and the flavor would be lost with all the chocolate happiness.

Excellent. I followed the advice to bake cake layers in a springform pan. Worked fabulously. Just cut like a cake as opposed to a bar. I also made the chocolate mousse by simply whipping the cream about half way, adding gelatin as directed for the whipped cream layer, and then added the melted chocolate and finished whipping. Perfect mousse consistency. A lot less time consuming than the method in the recipe. I also used more apricot glaze as suggested (a 10oz jar). My father, who does not like cream filled desserts or any dessert really for that matter, came by and had two slices in the course of 5 minutes. It's that good.

Not worth the effort, also mousse recipe is not very good as it doesn't set properly. If in need of chocolate overdose: try chocolate caramel diamonds instead.

Very good! Pretty easy to make but for some reason not quite as good as I thot it would be. The mousse doesnt really whip up much, I might use a different mousse recipe next time. Id prolly also double the apricote jam next time too

Good, but not my personal all time favorite. Looks incredibly impressive though and *everyone* at party wanted a piece. Much easier than other folks said it would be to make, I think.

My wife recently requested a chocolate recipe for her fellow workers to enjoy and celebrate some upcoming time off of work. I understand they can't wait to come back to work and perhaps celebrate the return with this recipe again. Delicious and sinfully chocolate. I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate.

I made this completely different and it turned out wonderfully and didn't take much time. I baked the cake in a 10" springorm pan and split the layers and then followed the recipe from there everyone absolutely loved it. Although, I found the cake part to be kind of heavy I think it would be better with a lighter base, perhaps a modified cake mix.

It is labor-intensive (it took me 3 hours), but it tastes absolutely sinful...very rich...definitely worth making for a special occasion

Delicious! I made this for my lab group meeting and it really wowed everyone. It took about four hours all told (except the chilling). Very rich but my boss had two pieces!

Although this recipe is very (very) labor intensive - it is worth every minute. I served the bars at a dinner party and got rave reviews! You must try this recipe the next time you are having company (great recipe for a rainy sunday).

I made this for my son's christening party. There's no denying this is delicious, but I'm not convinced it's worth the time. For a VERY SIMILAR intense chocolate flavor, try the Chocolate Mousse Pie (Bon Appetit 11/92)and substitute bittersweet choc. chips for semi-sweet chocolate. Very quick & easy.

Great recipe,but had trouble with chocolate mousse whipping up. had to chill many times. I have easier choc. mousse recipe that I would substitue in. I'm thinking of also tyring substituting a white chocolate mousse layer for the whip cream layer....but a yummy treat

Very labor intensive, but the finished product is well worth the time. The first time preparing the dish took the better part of an evening, but my guests and husband loved it. Another plus is that it can be made up to 3 days in advance, which is extremely helpful if you're preparing for a sizeable croud. It's definately a keeper!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. It was very rich and smooth. I will definitely make this again.

We thought this was terrific. However, for the mousse part, I used half bitter sweet and half semi sweet chocolate. I will definitely make this again.

To anyone who is a real chocolate lover like me, this dish is heaven.
