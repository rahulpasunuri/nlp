I made ths recipe twice. The first time I followed the directions. The second time I mixed half macintosh with half Granny Smith. I also sprinkled a lil' extra cinnamon on the pie once i poured the filling in. I would recommend doing both of this options in the future. This pie is delicious and the orange zest really makes the pie assertive in flavor

This is hands down the best apple pie I have ever eaten or made. I added a tablespoon of vanilla, a little candied ginger, a sprinkle of nutmeg. Like other reviewers I also add a tablespoon of flour before I spooned the apples in. I also let the apples soak for a little while before I put them in the pie crust. To prevent a runny pie I made sure that I didn't put all the liquid that the apples were soaking in, into the pie. I just spooned a little over the top to add flavor. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I made this on a frosty October evening..following the recipe accurately (other than just using enough apples to fill my pie pan..not measuring them out). It is such a simple recipe I didn't expect much, but was happily surprised when this turned out to be absolutely fabulous. I will make this for our Christmas dinner! Oh yes , I just remembered I did add a dash of nutmeg! Try it , you'll love it!

This recipe is a delish alternative to classic apple pie. In my first attempt, the orange flavors overwhelmed the pie, so the second time I made it I used a little less orange zest. It's fun to serve it with strange ice cream flavors that bring out the grand marnier and orange zest!

I made this recipe for christmas with a couple of changes. I used two different types of apples, 3 Tbsp of flour, 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar & 1/3 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup sugar as recipe suggested. I cut the orange peel in half & used a bright orange tangeine (very yummy). I added 1/8 tsp nutmeg, topped the apple filling with a handful of crushed pecans, placed thin butter pats in the openings on top of the filling. Next time I will use a crumb topping though. The grand marnier was an excellent addition to a great recipe!

I made this pie basically as the recipe called for, with minor exceptions of leaving out the orange peel, adding 3 rounded Tablespoons of flour, and using Triple Sec instead of the Grand Marnier. Since I had only one ready-made crust, I used the streusal topping from the Sour-Cherry Streusel Pie recipe (on this site)exactly as written. I packed it in over the apples, then as soon as it was golden brown, I covered it lightly with foil until done...it took over an hour. This combination is one I'll use again and again. All agreed it was one of the very best apple pies ever!

This pie was good, and easy. I took other's advice & left out the orange peel. I will say 2 1/4 lb. apples was WAY too much! I had to make an additional turnover from an extra pie crust round. I would think that just under 2 lbs. would be more than enough.

The orange peel and Grand Marnier gave this pie a great taste. I used a mix of Granny Smith, Honey Crisp and Yellow Delicious apples. Like other reviewers, I had more liquid than I might have liked. However, I forgot to add the extra teaspoon of flour to the bottom of the crust and I believe I should have cut my apples slices thinner. I will make this again. My husband is not a sweets eater but loved this pie.

I took the advice of other reviewers and left out the orange zest. The end result was excellent but didn't stand out as much as I would have liked compared to others (I entered it in a pie baking contest through work). The Grand Marnier blends the flavours together very well and smooth them out. Overall, 4 forks. The next time, however, I will add about half of the orange zest just for effect. As for the wateriness, I did add a little extra flour to the filling and I dusted both sides of the dough with some flour before baking. Afterwards, I let the pie stand overnight. Some people commented how nice a moist the texture was without being runny. Enjoy this one, it's a keeper.

I made this for a pie contest through work. It did turn out very well (3rd place) but I took the advice of other reviewers and left out the orange zest. The liquor smooths the flavours and blends them together. The only change I would make is to add about half the orange zest the next time. The taste was extremely good overall, but didn't stand out as much against the others. As for the wateriness of it, I did add a little extra flour and dusted the bottom of bottom of the pie dough on both sides and let it stand overnight. I got some compliments on how it was just moist enough without being too runny.

I am blessed with really great Dutch apples on my property, very tart and firm of flesh. I have made this recipe about 20 times now. Everyone says it is the best apple pie they have ever tasted. Very important to be sure and use some liquor; I have used Kirschwasser, brandy, Grand Marnier, and Cointreau. The liquor is the secret, although you can't taste it. I use Trader Joe's pre-made crusts. I also add a little more spice, a pinch of allspice and mace.

Very dissapointed in this recipe. I followed everything except left out any liquor, just used orange peel. Very soupy and too much orange flavor. I don't see why everyone is raving.

The amazing thing is that this pie is more delicious than other more difficult recipes for apple pie. My husband has declared that this should be the only apple pie I bake.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe. I also made my own pie crust from scratch. On the fourth time, I made this pie for my diabetic mom, I used Fuji Apples with 4 tablespoons of sugar (Splenda is gross) and she loved it.

I have made this pie 3 times in a week. I make my own crusts from scratch instead of the ready made crusts. Everyone loves it. I did cut the sugar to less than 1/2 cup the second and third times.

Good Pie, certainly a keeper. I didn't have GM so I used triple sec (1Tbsp) but felt that it made the pie a little too tart. Next time I will just stick to the orange zest. Used two frozen shells and finished the crust with a bit of sugar - tough to tell from home made one it was all done.

for years I searched for the 'perfect/little out of the ordinary' apple pie, and this is the one! I used Triple Sec instead of Grand Marnier and made my own crust with half butter and half oil (I'm not for shortening/hydrogenated fats) and just a hint of nutmeg. I have a feeling I'll make this pie again and again ...

I did not add the orange rind, as others suggested, and I found that the Grand Marnier gave this pie a wonderful flavor by itself. The end result was very watery- I actually had to drain the pie. I would make this pie again only if I figure out how to stop the flooding.

Excellent recipe. Very fresh and light tasting without being too sweet. Planning on making it again this weekend.

This recipe is great. My family loved it, and they are apple pie nuts! It has replaced my old apple pie recipe that I used for years. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I really don't like apple pie that much, but my husband is an aficionado, so this review reflects his opinion. I have made countless apple pies for him, all of which he gladly gobbled up. None, however, garnered the praise heaped upon me after he tasted this one! He finished it off this morning for breakfast (!) and even left me a note saying that it was the best I'd ever made (store-bought pie crust and all). I followed other reader's recommendations and left out the orange peel. The pie did look a bit juicy when it first came out of the oven, but was just perfect once it cooled. This one's a keeper!

We also dropped the orange zest from the recipe. The Grand Marnier more than made up for it. This is the type of dessert where all of your friends think you are a genius in the kitchen!

This has become one of my favorite apple pie recipes. I think this is about my ninth year of making it! I'm so glad that it is online. Now I don't have to dig through my stained, gnarled, ratty old magazine copy!

This was the first apple pie I've ever made that was not watery - at all. This is now my exclusive apple pie recipe!

I made this recipe from a print out which did not include all the words. As a result I brushed the crust with the 1 tsp of flour and placed the crust face up. There was no wateriness as encountered by other reviewers. Perhaps this small mistake took care of it.

this recipe is the best...with a few modifications. to begin with, i added 2 teaspoons of nutmeg for additional flavor and 2 teaspoons (or more) of cornstarch to combat any wateriness. i also baked it at 350 for 1 hour. secondly, i ommitted the orange zest. the marnier is more than sufficient. my guests chose the butter pecan ice cream over the vanilla and found this dessert delectable. this is definitely an addition to my recipe book.

I haven't made pie in years, and I'd forgotten what a chore it is: fussing with pastry, etc. But for a special occasion, it's SOOO worth it! Everyone raved about the pies (I made an apple/cranberry pie too) and it was really fun 'creating' such a special dessert. I'm going to make them more often!

Love this recipe, have made it for a second time, cooked a litter longer and cooled completely before serving, hope this reduces the wateriness.

My favorite apple pie of all time. Make sure you use Granny Smith apples. Also I've never used Grand Marnier--I use Cointreau instead...it may help with the "overwhelming orange" flavor people are commenting on. Great flavor--and it's not a watery pie...It's my standard apple pie recipe which all others now have to live up to. Great served with vanilla ice cream mixed with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (per quart of ice cream).

I agree with another reviewer that it was too strongly orange tasting. I cut the peel back to begin with, but next time would use maybe 1/2 of the Grand Marnier called for. I do plan to make it again.

I liked the pie but felt it had too much orange flavor. This time I will cut out the orange peel or Grand Marnier instead of using both.
