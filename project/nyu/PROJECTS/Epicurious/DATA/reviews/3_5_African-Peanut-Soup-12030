Made this for our Gourmet Group of foodiesall loved it. Made a few adjustments, some inspired by others comments. First, sautéed with coconut oil. At the end of the cooking, the recipe recommends skimming the oil, but we just mixed it in before serving. The real difference makers were the added spices--1/2 t cinnamon, 1 t paprika, and ½ cup coconut milk. The cinnamon and paprika will tend to clump, so stir them well into a small amount of soup on the side before adding to the pot. Let the soup simmer open-top for a couple hours to thicken a bit. Finally, right before serving, sprinkle a small amount of paprika for a nice presentation.

Made this as a first course with a lamb stew and it got raves!

I enjoyed this. Thanks for the suggestions - added chopped onion, ginger, additional garlic and coconut milk. Also accidentally doubled the tomato paste by not measuring - but I think it turned out great, nice balance with the peanut butter. Served over brown rice with a squeeze of lime. Not a big meat eater but next time I will add chicken to make more of a well-rounded dish.

Years ago, as a Peace Corp Volunteer in West Africa, I would look forward to eating Groundpea (Peanut) Soup. This recipe is good, but if you want a bit more authenticity and personality, try browning some chopped onion and cubed chicken breast with the garlic. Try a little more salt and a little more hot pepper and cook until it is the consistency of medium thick gravy. Also (very important), serve on rice. Brings it more in line with what I remember.

I just made this recipe a few minutes ago with a few sugested changes from some reviewers. I added 3 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper.I also sauted the peanut butter for a couple minutes before I started, and set the cooked peanut butter aside in a contianer while I sauted the garlic in oil. I used the imersion blender to mix the ingredients all together in the pot.The finished result is a quite tasty soup on the thin side.I like it. I think next time I will add only TWO garlic cloves if I serve it as a thin soup in the future, it is a tiny bit too garlicy with three. If I add meat and tomatoes I would leave the Three cloves of garlic in. Without meat added it might be nice to serve before a meal as an appatizer because its not super heavy. to make this into a more substantial meal,I think I will run to the store and buy a little chicken and some roma tomatoes {Peeled & coursely chopped} to saute and throw in for lite supper tonight instead of as an appatizer. An African reviewer suggested using stewing beef, and another person who lived in Africa suggested Tuna. I might try these variations in the future. This is a Keeper for me, We'll see what Hub's thinks tonight.

We made a couple of minor alterations to this recipe; we sauté'd the peanut butter and onions first as had instructed another reviewer, we used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and since we all enjoy lots of spice, we added Insanity hot sauce for some extra zing. This all combined to make one of our favorite soup recipes! We highly recommend it.

Whoever doesn't like this, I don't think you made it right, because it is so good! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added more parsley, but other than that, I don't think it needs anything else. Its a great appetizer to have with some herbed bread. I loved it!

This was really really tasty. I think the trick is to let is simmer slowly for a while (longer than suggested), so that the flavors can mix well. I also added cubed potatoes in it and while serving it I sprinkled some coutons overtop. I agree that without them, it can seem a bit blah. :) A total success every time.

All of your suggestions are wonderful, and, what I've always done is use V8 juice instead of the chicken broth, or as a substitute for some of the broth.

I made this soup hoping to have finally have found a peanut soup that would please my costumers but i found it was to thin (putting potatos in it to thicken it only made it worse)and tasted like nothing but watery peanut butter. You may try too make it and find differently but i did not like it.

I've been looking for a peanut soup recipe since I had it at an African restaurant in Edinburgh in 1997 - and I'm so happy to have this one! I agree that it's a good base, but I also think it's really tasty as it is. Last time I made it, I added chunks of sweet potatoes, a little coconut milk and rice noodles (adding chicken broth since it turned into a noodle-only dish fast!). My boyfriend swears this is the best thing I make.

I figured that this was a bit too basic so I added some things. I added lots of fresh parsley and lots of black pepper, some chopped celery leaves, ground allspice and chopped tomatoes for freshness. I served it over rice as a kind of sauce. Delicious.

I first tried African peanut soup at a restaurant and LOVED it. I was very happy to find this recipe and think it is very good. I make it a lot. One thing that is nice is that you can make it from stock items in your pantry. A nice soup for a cold winter day. Sometimes I add other things for interest--often a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles. Gives it a little more zing too.

I made it as is and enjoyed it with bread for dipping in it. Certainly a good base and might try adding some meat and veggies next time + a bit more garlic.

How dissapointing. I made this as is, and I've had tastier African peanut soup from the cafeteria at work. I'm with Lisa on this. Sorry. :o(

Other variations are to add 1 can of coconut milk and use a tin of diced tomatoes instead of tomato paste. It makes it less authentic but is delicious all the same. A friend also adds chopped cilantro.

I really hate Peanutbutter but this recipe is just my favourite (I cook it for every special occation and EVERYONE loves it!)!!! I start cooking a half pot of water with choped 3 tomatoes, 3 onions, 3 green peppers and 1/2 lbs chicken filet/breast bevore I add the paenut butter and cayenne pepper and serve it with sticked rice... Delicious!!! (Even though everyone first doubts it's yammie taste!)

This is a fine recipe. My African friends often add more; garlic, tomatoes, yams etc. They say it really is a basic staple soup, also very tasty. Worth making and experimenting with .

really simple and tasty - i actually made it twice in one night due to the fact everyone loved it so much. I served it with really thick bread for dipping in the soup. I also added WAY more garlic.

I was underwhelmed by this dish's flavor. I tasted it and added a Chinese Five Spice blend to perk it up...but still didn't care for it. I actually discarded most of the soup I made, so unimpressed was I with its taste.

There are three changes I have to make this recipe my own: 1) 1/2 large mashed (puréed) sweet potato/yam 2) 1/2 cup minced and sautéed mushrooms 3) less peanut butter. I use 1/3 c of chunky.

It was a good recipie--very easy to make. I added some carrots, yams and pumpkin to make it heartier and more stew-like.

This soup has a good flavor, although I agree with other cooks that it could use a little more garlic and maybe some ginger. I used crunchy natural peanut butter for texture. Still, I think it needed something else- veggies or rice or maybe even potatoes? I don't eat meat, but I think chicken probably would be pretty good in this. It is really good with ciabatta bread too!

In the version I used to make, with great success, the peanut butter was sauteed until dark, and chicken and sweet and hot spices were added. I find that browning the peanut butter improves the flavor greatly.

An easy winter favorite - we add sauteed chopped chicken, and serve over rice with a squeeze of fresh lime. Delicious, fast, and great for leftovers.

Use this thick stew over rice and add chicken that was boiled in the broth!!! Yummy!!! Who knew peanut butter would go with Tomatoes and garlic!!! P.S if someone know a recipe from West Africa country of the shrimp Cameron, called "Bitter Leaves"well it is made with bitter leaves and ground peanuts with smoked fish.

For those who have tried this recipe and need to add more...By the way, what we call soup is stew for Americans. Try adding stewing beef and serve with fried plantain... delicious!!

There is soup, then there is stew--this is most definitely a stew. The use of oil in the beginning to make some fashion of roux is the clue. This recipe was improved by adding some more garlic, fennel seed and fresh ginger root. I served it atop rice, rather than trying to eat as a soup. In West Africa, the recipe's origin, a soup would never be made with oil. It would start with a broth (chicken or vegie infused with ginger, garlic, etc). A stwe would be made with oil, or drippings from browned meat.

As a soup, this was disgusting - I couldn't choke down more than a half cup of it. But it makes a great sauce over couscous, and I'd definitely make it again to eat it that way!

This was a great starting point with lots of flavor, but I really wanted a more substantial main dish, so I added cauliflower florets, chopped turnips, carrots and okra, and garnished each bowl with fresh cilantro and red pepper flakes. Obviously a departure from the original recipe, but I found it interesting and satisfying.

I've never made this particular dish personally, but it sounds a lot like a recipe I found in an old fusion vegitarian cookbook that had all these mixed-ethnicity recipes (and some authentic ones, too). "African Tomato-Peanut Soup" Excellent recipe, only it was a little different than this. Instead of tomato paste, it called for roasted then pureed Roma tomatoes. Then peanut butter (I used 'chunky' for texture). Still used cayenne, but also called for a little turmeric which set it off. Authentically, it called for a raw egg to be boiled into the broth for thickness-- but for purely vegan variations, I used some hearty, cooked brown rice. Eaten with a crusty loaf, it was amazing! It didn't make enough, though. I'd double the recipe next time I made it.

I tried this soup while in Africa with some very friendly locals. I agree with other reviews in so much as this recipe is missing something. It is. Fish is the answer try Tuna or Mackerel. It Beautiful! Usually served over a raw dough mixture or dumplings.

I added chicken, rice and onions too. I didn't have cayenne, so I used a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It was spicy, but not overwhelming. At the end, I scattered chopped scallions on top for a nice, fresh crunch. It made the dish!

Wonderful dish! I took the extra step of turning it into more of a stew then a soup, adding potatoes, chicken, and serving it over rice. This was definately a winner!

I also tried another reviewer's adaptation by adding cut up chicken and serving it over rice--it was marvelous!! I plan on serving it with a salad and rolls at a luncheon I am hosting for a few friends. Just be sure no one is allergic to peanuts when serving.

Wonderful flavor to this soup. With a few additions, this made a wonderful dinner for a fall night. I did add a bit more cayenne, and for more substance I added some cooked, diced chicken. I served it over rice and topped it with some fresh cilantro. Rave reviews from my fiance.
