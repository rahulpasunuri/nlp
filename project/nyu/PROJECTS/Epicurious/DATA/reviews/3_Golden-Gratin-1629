This is a favorite. I follow the recipe as is and it's great. It can be made a day in advance and reheated before serving

I have made this for Passover the last 2 years and it's everyone's favorite. I now have to make extra for "doggie bags".

I didn't have apricot nectar so I used apple juice. But since we like apricots I used at least a cup of them. And I couldn't bother with boiling, then baking, so I melted the margarine (only 1/2 stick) and poured it on top with the other ingredients, then covered the dish and baked it with everything else. Easy and delicious!

In opposition to the cook above, we loved this dish! I made it for Passover, and it was great with fresh turkey breast. One correction - TOTAL cooking time is 55 min, not 30 plus another 55. Also, I added a bit more liquid and dotted it with margarine before serving, as it dried out a bit.
