I'm not going to give this any stars, because I made a major-ish substitution. I used thick, Greek yogurt + splash of heavy cream in place of sour cream, because that's what I had. Normally, this works fine, and it worked this time (meaning, I tempered it, so it didn't curdle, etc.) The sauce was smooth and unbroken. But this was a huge pile of YUCK. Seriously, I can't remember the last time I made such a flop of a meal. I'm a pretty experienced cook, and I can normally fix a recipe that goes off the rails, but this was a major exception. It looked terrible, and tasted nearly as bad. In the end, we resorted to Tabasco and red wine vinegar in an attempt to salvage it ... ugh. The problem could be my paprika, which was an unopened, BRAND NEW tin of Szegd (sp?) sweet Hungarian. The expiration date is Dec. 2010, but I think it went stale anyway (there goes $10). It's the only thing that explains why this recipe looked and tasted like ground cardboard. Moral of the story? Test your paprika flavor first... it could save your dinner.

As many others have said, this recipe has been a much loved regular for me since it was first published. It doubles easily. Just make sure you use high quality paprika- I use more than called for, with about 3/4 sweet and 1/4 hot for a little spice. If your paprika isn't fresh, or real Hungarian, don't even bother. And thanks to Sarasota- after all these years, I never thought to try canned diced tomatos until I saw your comment. Works great, and is one less thing to clean and chop!

I love this recipe! I usually make it with 1 can of petite diced tomato's instead of the fresh tomato.. don't skimp on the paprika (get hungarian sweet for sure!) also I sometimes add garlic and extra sour cream. Definitely try it, you'll be happy you did!

The taste was great - for a weeknight meal it's perfect, since you basically use one pan for everything and it's pretty quick. However, the main thing lacking on this dish is presentation. It looks like chicken with a sauce slapped on. So - ok for weeknight, but not something you want to make to boost your hostess points. Spanish paprika (pimenton) works great.

This has been one of my standby weeknight dishes since it first came out (uh-oh, does that make me old???) and I've been known to substitute all sorts of stuff for the chicken broth, including wine or beer, and it still results in a delicious dish. It is also oh-so-delicious over mashed potatoes...

I've made this for years, and always loved the recipe. For those that state that the flavor is "ho-hum" let me give you a hint. The kind of paprika can make a huge difference. Make sure you buy Hungarian sweet paprika, or another high-end sweet paprika. If the paprika's not sweet, or is old and has hung around the pantry too long, the dish suffers.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this dish. Forgot to add chicken broth and the sauce was rich and creamy.

I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and lots of onion. No butter, so we used olive oil and fried the onions very slowly til golden and gooey. I found the dish delicious and very flavorful. The chicken stayed tender and the sour cream added smoothness. Served over brown rice. Nice.

Tasted just OK. Not exciting, but not terrible, either. Guess you really have to love paprika to love this one, otherwise it's pretty ho-hum.

I thought this was very yummy, and so did my husband. I thought I'd made enough for 3 servings (so I could take some for lunch), but hubby ate all the leftovers too! It's creamy and a little sweet.

I'm new to the kitchen, so I love easy recipes and this was definitely an easy one. Didn't have fancy Hungarian paprika, but the average dried one worked wonderfully. I used low-fat sour cream and didn't miss any richness or taste. Absolutely loved it, but the other reviewers are right - it's not a fancy dish for guests.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe tonight, pretty much as directed, except that I had no onions in the house, so I substituted onion powder. I also added diced red bell pepper and more tomatoes. I thought it turned out delicious. I served it with brown rice and some crusty brown bread. My husband and our impromptu dinner guest both agreed that it was very tasty.

Tried this dish last night, thought it was great for a weekday dish. It's easy to make, simple ingredients and the kids loved it. I didn't give it four forks simply because I probably wouldn't consider it a dish I would serve guests or put on a restaurant menu list, just not fancy(?) enough. Oh and although I know people hate it when you add and substitute ingredients, but I did use chicken thigh pieces instead, as well as add cayenne pepper for a little kick!:)

YUMMY! I used the recommendations from "Gail" submitted in November 2000. This was a really wonderful dish and worthy of the best paprika you can find. We were lucky enough to use some Spanish paprika! We enjoyed every bite and we will definitely make it again! (Why not 4 forks? I guess I am just picky about giving out 4-fork ratings.)

This was an easy recipe to make, with easy ingredients and so delicious! My boyfriend really liked it, too. I added some crushed garlic as well as onions. I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt instead of plain salt and simmered the chicken ( I used dark meat instead of breast) for 30 minutes, covered. I stirred the sour cream in, a couple of minutes prior to serving.

I loved this dish! I added sauteed mushrooms and found that they were a nice addition to the recipe. Instead of serving this dish with rice or noodles, I served it with Potato Gnocchi. Definitely a hit!

The original chicken paprikas is made from thighs and drumsticks, They give a lot better flavour. Oil should be used instead of butter. And there is absolutely no need for chicken broth.

This is a great weeknight dish. It's a go-to winter supper at our house. Very easy and delicious over noodles. I've used canned and fresh tomatoes, both work. If you bulk up on the sour cream a little and cut back on the broth, the sauce is thicker and tastier.

This dish is a regular at our table; my husband LOVES it. It's quick and easy to make, and tasty, too. In a pinch I've used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and low-fat or fat-free sour cream and it works just fine. I like to serve this over rice, so it can suck up all the sauce.

I was very excited while cooking this dish and less excited while eating this dish. I doubled the recipe and should not have doubled the broth. Next time, less broth...maybe some flour and perhaps I will try the spicy paprika as suggested by others. It is worth a second try. Serve with egg noodles...that part works.

this is definately a quick and easy recipe. i combined both hot and sweet paprika which added a little kick. serve over egg noodles for dinner one day and lunch the next!

Very quick and easy. But the dish turns out rather bland. I added extra salt, pepper, 1/4 c. mushrooms and a little chili sauce which perked up the dish a little. But it definitely needed the spicy paprika. I'd make it again, but only because it was quick and filling.

Was fairly disappointed with this recipe. It wasn't horrid, just bland. There are way too many other recipes to try than to waste time making this one again (even with better paprika).

This is the first dish I have made from this site and I was really looking forward to trying this dish - but very disappointed in results! I used leeks instead of shallot and added a clove of garlic, minced. Still it had no distinguishing flavor. I hope this isn't indicative of other highly rated recipes from this site!!

Actually, I'm rating Gail's recipe. I did not like it -- way too much sour cream. Made the dish overly rich and somewhat bland, even with all that paprika. I would prefer something more complex and less creamy.

I have made this dish several times with a couple of additional ingredients. I have added in a chopped yellow pepper with the tomato and also have thrown in about a 1/4 teaspoon of hot paprika this gives it some added flavor. Excellent over hot noodles!

What Gail from Austin said! I doubled this recipie following her instructions and the result was delicious! One for the repeat file.

I have a fabulous chicken paprikas recipie that puts this to shame follow the same directions until you add the onions. First of all use 2 cups thinly sliced onion and saute until very soft. Then add 2T Hungarian paprika and 2T flour. Cook for 1 min. Add 1 1/2-2C chicken broth. Add chicken back in and cook until done. Remove chicken and cook the sauce down until almost pasty (this is the secret). It takes about an hour at a high simmer. Then add the sour cream 1-1 1/2 cups. It is the best thing you ever tasted.

Tasty and easy. I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breast (and added some braising time before mixing in the sour cream) and liked the result. Quick and easy weeknight dish.

Rating: 2
I was concerned about the sauce being too thin, so I let it boil longer after I added the broth. I ended up with very little sauce, but it was thick. Next time, I won't overdo the boiling time and try adding a little flour. It would also be good with a little punch. I'll try Hungarian hot paprika and some minced jalapeno pepper.

This was very good. Buy the sweet hungarian paprika - well worth the cost. I doubled the sauce, and I should have reduced the broth; a bit thin, but delicious. Served over noodles, and my husband used italian bread to mop up every bit of sauce. A definite keeper.

This turned out great! We used 2 smallish regular tomatoes and beef broth (didn't have chicken broth) and it tasted wonderful, very rich. There was really enough sauce for 4 chicken breasts, and was great over rice.

Made this for my family tonight. My 3 year-old and my 1 year old LOVED it. Very good for kids! (Although I did have to tell my older one that it was chicken in tomato sauce for her to even try it!) I doubled the entire recipe, but added only 1 and a quarter cups broth. Turned out fine. It is a nice tasting dish. I served it over egg noodles and just had a green salad with it.

This dish was VERY good. I love sauce so I doubled it but unfortunately added too much broth due to doubling. It took about 45 min. to complete and the sauce was still too thin. Next time I'll cut back. There were no plum tomatoes so I used one regular tomato. I served this over penne pasta. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great dish. I added lots of onions and extra tomato. The only thing about it was that if you double, don't use quite as much chicken broth. I served it over plaim long grain rice that I cooked in chicken broth and it was fabulous. I can't wait to make it again!

I disagree with "Chef Robby"'s comments. This is not a peasant's dish as he so called it. I'm a mother of two boys and also of a hungarian background, if I can make a dish this quick and easy and delicious and it tastes like my Grandma Toth used to make, it is definitely this dish!

I sincerely hope this isn't what you're passing off as a traditional recipe! My grandmother came from over there in 1929, and I have NEVER seen tomatoes in Paprikas!!! I also have never seen so many unneccessary steps added to such a simple recipe. This was a peasant's dish, it wasn't meant to be gourmet cuisine... Also, where's the Cayenne pepper? That's a traditional ingredient, found in 99% of all Paprikas recipes! Just to let you know, Chef Robby

This is an excellent recipe and very similar to Hungarian Chicken which we borrowed from another recipe provider on the net. This is an excellent "change of pace" dinner. I have not had anyone dislike it yet. (by the way, the Hungarian Chicken Recipe aforementioned sauted green pepper pieces with the onions...it helps this dish alot). Just goes to prove....there are many excellent ways to prepare chicken.
