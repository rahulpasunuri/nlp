Very subtle, delicious flavors. The mushrooms have a natural earthiness, and, to me, the onions and garlic were a nice complement that didn't overpower the mushrooms. We had this dish as a starter, but it could easily be a good side dish to a fish, pork, or chicken main. We used a mix of mushrooms, including chanterelles, button mushrooms, and shiitake. Instead of peanut oil we used canola, and the result was still good.

Wonderful! Made this just as a sample dish for a buffet type meal. Will make it again to accompany more traditional asian food (rice for starters...) Great!
