Simple but fabulous--really lets the flavor of the crab shine through. A recommendation--mix the crab + ingredients together at the last minute for the most vivacity of flavors. I put it together about half an hour in advance, thinking the flavors would "meld," but it tasted better when first mixed.

I haven't made this recipe, but I'd like to comment on the review thread. Can't we all just be civil? I love cooking, and have enjoyed using this site. I look at the reviews for both ratings and ideas about where things might go wrong or be improved, and it makes me really sad to have this mean-spirited commentary going on.

I made this with some slight variation last night, and it was perfect after a sweltering 90 degree summer day. I wanted something without all the mayo typically found, and the simplicity of these ingredients inspired me. As this was our main entree, I jazzed it up & added 5-6 shakes of Old Bay and some dill weed along with the tops of 3 green onions. I also mixed the greens with EVO, the juice of 1/2 lemon & about 2 tsp of Splenda with salt & course black pepper. It was DELISH!

While the recipe may be simplistic, it requires that each ingredient be as perfect and fresh as possible. There is no "hiding" behind a sauce or a load of garnishes. Take time to find the best ingredients and then enjoy the basic flavors of each and the way they play off each other. Not every recipe needs to have a long ingredient list and be complicated.

Nice simple salad.

Yeah, I'm only sixteen and I understand the simplicity of this recipe. I don't know if all of you 'snobs' find delicacy in a piece of toast, but maybe you should do your research some more when it comes to cooking. Simplicity is the best form of elegance, and I thought the flavors were amazing. Sorry to hear some of you have no palette. :)

It's Dungeness crab season on the Pacific Coast & this is just the thing for a light first course that will showcase the delicate succulence of the crab meat. Those who complain about this recipe's simplicity miss the point entirely. A good cook cruises for ideas, not just instructions. I'll add avocado, but plan to serve this as a first course, followed by brined roast rack of pork with apple chutney & bourbon sauce. Let the crab shine through!

We read the reviews and made this the first time exactly as is, with exceptional olive oil, fresh lemon juice, sea salt, picked over crab claw meat that we get in vaccuum pack bags at our grocery store and mixed herb salad. It was great! And the leftovers held up chilled overnight so I added them to some spaghetti for lunch the next day--also great! But we decided that next time, we'll add some combo of capers, shallots (or red onions), maybe some minced jalepeno, just for an extra punch.

I just had to comment on the startling array of 'crab snobs' I have encountered just in looking for a crab salad recipe on this site. Who can afford to use fresh crab *everytime*? Glad some of us have it like that. The lack of insight displayed by some posters on this site regarding the fact that many may not have the funding to buy fresh crab-or even REAL crab for that matter- indicates, at least to me, that you may want to see a surgeon for the purpose of removing your cranium from your anal cavity. Snobby is as snobby does, folks.

Superb and refreshing. Very light and easy to adapt with other ingredients. We like to add slices of avocado and hard-boiled egg.

Based on other reviews I tried to pep this up by adding a little minced shallot and some capers - It seemed bland in the recipe. It's still bland. Okay at best. Don't bother with it; there have got to be better crab salad recipes that are not swimming in mayo.

This was so much better than my recipe: Crabby Lemon salad with Green Babies!

With a rather mundane/pedestrian ingredient list such as this, it is imperative that only the freshest and highest quality foods are used to obtain maximum flavour and showcase each individual ingredient. Just because it is simple does not mean it is ho-hum, unworthy or a non-recipe. I enjoyed this salad as a very pleasant, light and non-competitive starter for a much more hearty/robust main course. The bright/clean lemon tang and peppery taste of the greens mix I used really complemented the crab and allowed its delicate flavour to shine through. Sometimes, simple is best, especially when freshness and quality are the key ingredients. Think just-picked, sun-warmed tomatoes from your garden drizzled with the very best olive oil and sprinkled with the freshest basil, sea salt and cracked pepper. You now have the basic premise of this salad. Canned or frozen crab, bagged lettuce and bottled lemon juice just ain't gonna make it!

So what if it is simple. It's still good. And to all you negative people who write in and have nothing substantive to say, why don't you use your excess energy in a positive way?

A great recipe, however easy. Would certainly make it again.

Easy or not, not everybody has the time to be creative and some people prefer to have the recipe handy with the correct amounts. I think it's an excellent recipe, and I also think that negative remarks are absolutely unnecessary and most unkind.

You call this a recipe?? It amounts to nothing more than tossing some crabmeat on your salad. Here, I've got one for ya'= Toast 1 slice of bread, spread with butter. Serve. Yummy!

ANY cook can tell, at a glance, that this recipe is NO SHOW STOPPER! It amounts to nothing more than tossing some crabmeat onto your salad. Here, I've got one for ya': toast 1 piece of bread, spread with butter. Serve!

OK, this is SOOO simple that it doesn't really need instructions - but some people would ask for them and it would be a shame if they did not try this recipe because they didn't have details.

Where's the garlic?

The previous review is rather unfair. Some of the best recipes in the world are the simplist. Take roasted potatoes with olive oil and rosemary. It's all about technique, though there isn't much with this one, but proportions are important. A simple recipe like this will get people to try and inevitably they will enhance it.
