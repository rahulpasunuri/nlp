As per previous suggestions, I used caramelized shallots and added a little salt. I also sprinkled on a handful of pine nuts and skipped the olive oil since I'd used plenty with the shallots. With the additions, I'd give this recipe four forks!

This was tasty and easy. I used naan and did it under the broiler, so prep and cooking was done in a flash. Per other reviewers, I sauteed some shallot and added that, which I think was a great addition. I also tried some balsamic on a few bites but I didn't think it added anything. This isn't my favorite goat cheese pizza, but it's an interesting combo to keep in the mix and I'll definitely make it again.

Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this pizza was missing something. I drizzled balsamic vinegar on the leftovers the next day, and that did the trick. Without it, the goat cheese was just too mellow and dry. Balsamic made this a 4-fork recipe.

This is a great and easy grilled pizza recipe.

I love this! Carmelized onions is essential. Fresh rosemary is a must! Everybody I have introduced this to loves this!

I thought this sounded interesting - I like all of the ingredients and the combination looked yummy. It just seemed like something was missing - maybe some acid to balance out the sweetness of the grapes? Not sure. I liked the rosemary with the goat cheese. The grapes were too overwhelming and sweet. I think I would use raisins or a dried fruit like figs, soaked in balsamic vinegar with some arugula and a squirt of lemon - but that completely changes the recipe. I had to add a lot of salt to make this palatable. As is, I would not make it again and I'm not sure it's worth the effort to try to use the grapes in this at all.

My husband and I loved this recipe. On the advice of other reviewers, I added caramelized shallots as a first layer then put to goat cheese and grapes on top. I also used trader joe's whole wheat pizza dough.

I also added caramelized shallots to the pizza and added rosemary and pepper to the pizza dough. My boyfriend raved that this was the best pizza he'd had.

On the positive side, this is super quick and easy to make. The sweetness of the grapes is an interesting contrast with the goat cheese. But it's s little weird and you don't want to eat much of it.

I added fresh basil at the end. And also started with a base layer of sauteed shallots in olive oil with fresh rosemary. The flavor combination's are amazing. My husband could not stop eating this pizza.

Made this as an appetizer for dinner tonight. Used puff pastry instead of pizza dough and it was divine. It's a keeper and will be made at future dinner parties again.

Very good pizza, although it was very rich. I suggest adding carmelized onions, basil, and oregano.

Fantastic and so easy to make! I used a Boboli precooked pizza shell and added some pepper to the grape mix. This will be joining the dinner rotation in my household.

This is a great starting point. I liked it better with cubed, browned & seasoned chicken breast on garlic nan. Instead of broiling I baked it on a rack for 20min at 400º. So good!

WOW really good. I used a whole wheat thin crust premade pizza shell and it was fast and amazing. I added some grilled chicken cubes for more substance.

I also made this with Trader Joe's w/w pizza dough and loved it! I'd make it again, but just as a pizza, without all the flipping of the dough. The rosemary was excellent, yet I'd also experiment with some of the other herbs in my garden.

Made with Trader Joe's pizza dough, added some carmelized onions (highly recommended addition) and used champagne grapes. Used only about 4oz goat cheese and that was plenty. Super easy and delicious!

I made this on whole wheat naan, used fresh basil instead of rosemary, also added olives and topped with very thin slices of tomato. I browned it under the broiler in the toaster oven and it worked great. The red grapes are delicious with the goat cheese.

Not a bad start - although black pepper, oregano, green/kalamata olives, and (more specific) myzithra cheese - for its browning ability under heat- would make this a lot better. The aforementioned additions made this pizza a definite hit w/ my friends. A keeper overall!
