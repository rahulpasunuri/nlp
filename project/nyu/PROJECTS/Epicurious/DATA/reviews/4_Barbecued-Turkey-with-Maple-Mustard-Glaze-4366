I'd like to make this for thanksgiving but I've heard brines should be rinsed off of the turkey and this recipe does not specify that. Please let me know if you've made this before and believe you must rinse the turkey before grilling. THANKS!!

This is the best! I was having some trouble in the first hour with the wood chips smoking and turned the outer burners up to med high to high. No problem after that. I will be making this more often than just for Thanksgiving.

Tastiest, juiciest turkey ever. As it was kosher and already soaked/salted, I used only 3 tbsp of salt in the brine. Looked like glaze didn't play well with the oil bird was coated with, possibly because I coated it with more oil midway through bbq'ing. Served with Winter Fruit Chutney and string beans with whole grain mustard.

I made this turkey for the first time this year. I'm not a huge turkey person but everyone at the table loved it, and some said it was the best they've ever had. It had brown, crispy skin and was ridiculously juicy. The added bonus of keeping the oven free for other T-day dishes makes this a keeper.

Love this recipe! I have used this twice now, and the second time was even better than the first. Brine it for at least 10 hours. The glaze is phenomenal! The turkey turns out juicy, and the skin brown and crispy, with this extra little punch from the glaze. Both times, there were NO leftovers. :)

Fantastic! I made this turkey for Thanksgiving dinner this year and my family devoured it and we really aren't a turkey-loving family. My changes: I roasted the turkey uncovered over a bed of carrots, celery, onions, thyme, rosemary and sage in the oven at 500 degrees for 40 minutes, which really crisped the skin. I used the pan drippings for gravy. Then I placed it on the gas grill for 4 hours over indirect heat, at 350 degrees, basting every hour. I tented it with foil for the last hour. It was so tender and moist that the bones could be pulled out. It was a 17 pound bird. Next time I think I will grill it only for three hours.

This is our 10th year using this recipe and it is awesome! It is juicy and has a fine mahogany color when done. Here's my husband's blog post about this year's results: http://www.weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2008/11/every_years_tur.html Instead of a pot for brining, I use a large enough plastic bag to hold turkey and all of the brine and squeeze out all of the air before sealing. I like the new 3 gallon zip-closed big bags... I double bagged the brine/turkey, sat it upright in an ice chest, got all the air out, packed it in ice with a little ice water added and left it for about 24 hours. If using smoker with water bowl like our effective cheapo (Char-Broil brand Charcoal Water Smoker), consider putting heated [boiling] water into water bowl so it doesn't unnecessarily pull heat from the coals. Do yourself a huge favor and skip lighter fluid or instant light briquettes and get a chimney charcoal starter (like the Weber brand Rapidfire Chimney Starter)... and use a probe thermometer with a temperature alarm (like the ThermoWorks brand The Original Cooking Thermometer/Timer) that way you can watch the temp while keeping the lid on, not losing any heat... we're loving it so much that we're now looking at a smoker upgrade (perhaps the Weber brand Smokey Mountain Cooker 18-1/2-Inch Smoker).

I've been making this recipe on our Big Green Egg for 3 years. It's outstanding! Smoky and delicious. Last year I BBQd a 21 pound bird at 225 for about 4 hours and at 300 for the last 45 min (total 5 hours). This year I BBQd an 18 pound bird for about 6 hours at 225 - 250. The dark meat is out of this world and the glaze is perfect. Next year I am going to make the brine 2 days ahead to give the brine plenty of time to cool before adding the turkey. I wouldn't change anything.

A new favorite, better than smoked. Brine was just right, not too salty. Wouldn't change a thing.

Use a foil pouch with holes in it, they should go directly over the burners (do a search - other wise they will not smoke) Make 3 of them and adding a new one every hour and half or so. For more info you might check food network - I think Alton Brown demo'd bbqing a bird on a gas grill.

Hi everyone. I'm planning on making this for Thanksgiving. However, I have one question about using a fairly regular 3 burner gas grill: Do I place the aluminum trays with the hickory chips on the grill, on either side of the turkey and an empty aluminum tray below the grill on top of the burner that is turned off? Or do all of the trays go beneath the grill on top of the burners? This doesn't make a lot of sense to me since I would imagine the aluminum trays full of hickory chips would be generally unhappy directly on top of the lit burners... Any help is greatly appreciated. I wish there was a place to post questions rather than in the review section. I promise to return and review the recipe next week! Thanks.

I have been making this recipe for about 5 years and it is the best turkey we have ever had. I never have used the star anise, but normally substitute some anise seed, which is readily available. On one occasion, we discovered that we forgot to buy the oranges and substituted grapefruit instead. It gave it a different taste and was also very good. Not sure which one we like best. I normally use a vertical wet smoker and have done it on an electric, charcoal and now a propane one - all with great results, but the propane is most convenient and easiest to control temperature. I find that heavy smoke in the beginning gives it the best flavor. If I cook it at about 300F, a 15-18 lb turkey gets done in about 6 hours and is very juicy.

Our family has enjoyed this turkey recipe for the past five years on Thanksgiving. The turkey is moist and full of mild flavor that combines very well with all the traditional side dishes An added bonus is that my husband enjoys cooking the bird outside on the BBQ leaving me and my ovens free to take care off all the side dishes.

This is the best turkey you will ever have. I've used this recipe for my extended family Thanksgivings for 8 years -- by request. I even was asked to bring it 50 miles to another cousin's house one year. I even brought the recipe to another state to make it one year. LOVE THIS RECIPE. One modification: I can never find whole star anise. I use whole fennel bulbs and parts of the stem, cut in quarters. Don't know how that changes the taste from the recipe, but it works for my family! DELICIOUS!!

I used a half bone in turkey breast and one third of the brine recipe. I soaked it for about 6 hours. The turkey was moist and delicious and enough for four adults with a little left over. Next time, I'll try a boneless breast.

Words cannot describe how marvelous this turkey was. Our oven is broken and grilled our Thanksgiving turkey using this recipe and our guests could not stop raving about it-some even dreamed about having leftovers. It was juicy, flavorful, smokey, beautiful! Wouldn't change one thing on the recipe.

The best turkey recipe ever (only problem is there are hardly any leftovers). I use lower heat and let it cook for about two hours longer, and use pecan chips instead of hickory. I had a hard time finding whole star anise but finally found it at a health food store, and also at an ethnic food market.

I've tried a dozen turkey recipes, (butterflied, brined, injected, stuffed, rubbed, you name it.) This is hands down the best I've tried. This brine adds wonderful flavor to the meat, and the hickory flavor from the grill is just subtle enough. My grill cooked it slower (by about an hour) than the recipe's guidline, but that may be part of why it worked so well. Even so, I may try slightly higher heat next time. I was a bit underwhelmed by the glaze, and I would've been just as happy without it. Juicy, succulent, fall-off-the-bone yumminess.

Shredded turkey sandwiches for our annual 4th of July Party! - Yum! - Each year I look for a new barbecue recipe.(It has to be something that is ready in advance and warmed up prior to serving.) This year I wanted to serve turkey and decided to use this recipe. but I shredded it for sandwiches. I made double the glaze and poured it over the meat befor re-heating. I also skipped the Star Anise because I didn't have it or any of the 5 spice powder. It still received high praise. I will try the winter chutney another time.

This is probably the best turkey I have ever had. I made this for Easter Dinner and had nothing but a pile of bones left to show for it. Due to time constraints I didn't follow the recipe exactly(no star anise) and kinda cooked it some in the oven and smoked it toward the end. The result was a tender and completely juicy and flavorful bird. I was swatting hands as I tried to carve! Rave reviews from all 15 guests! Of course, I had to give some of credit to Epicurious who has yet to let me down!

I have made this 5 times... and it's the best bird I've eaten. I have only made the glaze one time, I think the turkey speaks for itself without. It's a fun way to make a turkey, your guests will be super impressed when they see the birds cooking away on the grill (the last couple years it has been two birds for the thirty plus people each time)..

This was much easier than expected and was delicious. I will definetely do this again. Even though I am an experienced cook, I was a bit intimidated by the process but it turned out beautifully. I used a kosher bird which I have not done before. There is a bit of extra work in the cleaning but you don't have to brine. I have a gas grill with only 2 burners so I did it on low over a drip pan. The chutney is a must. The leftovers were used w/cheese and apples and crackers.

The turkey was moist and very good. It took a lot less time for my turkey to cook, but that can only be more convienent.

This turkey is the best. The brining really tightens the skin for grilling, an absolute necessity. We have had guests picking at the roasted skin. We served with the Winter Fruit Chutney and Potato Salad. It does not need gravy. A hit every time we make it.

If I've cooked one turkey over the last 20 years I've cooked 100. I've also tried at least 20 recipes and never gotten things the way I wanted until now. I'll still make the traditional stuffed bird when I have to but this is far and away my first choice. This recipe is so good I actually went out in my backyard during this year's President's Day blizzard (24 inches of snow and 30 to 40 mph winds) to make it for the friends and neighbors we had over. It was well worth the risk of frost bite. Have made it 4 times now. I find it gets a smokier taste over charcoal but over gas the more subtle smoke flavor blends nicely with the maple-mustard glaze. Some friends brought over a not so sweet riesling which was a nice pairing. One comment re: The chef who questioned whether to use the glaze. True, it's a little runny, and not everyone is looking for the extra litle touch it adds to the flavor (we sure like it especially when cooking over charcoal). But: if nothing else it adds a beautiful shine to the turkey and there's something to be said for food that looks good too. Since you need to rest the bird before carving I put it out for all to see. As it lies there with the shiney crisp looking skin and the hickory smoke aroma filling the house you can just see the excitement of everyone waiting to get a taste of it all. Everyone in the house asked me how much longer till we carved; some people twice. It's a bit of a tease but in the end it's for a good cause. *grin*

Rating: 4
This was the best! I normally do not care for turkey; I always thought it smelled like wet feathers when it was cooking! The brining and the preparation of this turkey resulted in beautiful, mahogany color skin and a fresh, clean flavor. I later read that brining actually draws out the blood. I also started with the breast down for the first hour or so. I used my V-rack that I had coated with oil inside my roasting pan on the grill. What type of gravy did people make--that was my only disappointment with this recipe.

Rating: 4
This was a fabulous turkey recipe - moist, flavorful, and absolutely beautiful to behold - a gorgeous golden-brown color. The first time I made it, though, the maple-mustard glaze ran right off the turkey into the pans underneath, and it didn't really seem to add too much to the turkey - it was already flavorful from the smoking and the brining. So the next time I saved some time (and money) and did not make the glaze, and it turned out wonderfully. I also don't believe that a turkey needs to be cooked to 180 degrees in the thigh any more. I pulled it off the grill at 174, let it sit for a few minutes, and then carved it and it was perfectly done. The first time I made this turkey was for Thanksgiving, and I didn't have any leftovers! I was sad that I couldn't enjoy the leftovers, so I went out and bought a second turkey, and made it a week later! I love this recipe.

I thought the turkey was good, but not necessarily better than in the oven. I'm not sure if the soaking produced any better result than without doing that process. There were no drippings to make a gravy, but we improvised and got a fairly decent one.The one advantage was the cleanup. It seemed much easier without the mess of the roasting pan.

I agree with the other MANY reviews that this was the best turkey I have ever made. I used five spice powder since I didn't have the star anise. Also, I started the bird breast side down and then turned it halfway so it was brown and beautiful on all sides. Just made some turkey veg soup with the bones and the taste of ginger and smoke makes for an interesting and delicious stock that didn't even need extra salt or pepper!

We have made this recipe every year since it was published, we will never go back to putting the bird in the oven!! Always moist and flavorful,opens up the oven for other food at thanksgiving.

This is our favorite turkey recipe! We've made it several times using small (12 lb) or large (27 lb) turkeys, and the final result is always delicious and succulent!

We serve it with "Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes with Goat Cheese (or feta) and Basil", pre-made stuffing balls and gravy. Fabulous!

This brine is really quite good! I did the turkey on a charcoal spit and I don't think I would try it any other way...so moist, you wouldn't believe it! I would suggest NOT using the seseame oil, but a peanut or light olive oil instead. The glaze is an added bonus. Sweet and light!

My husband and I made this using just a turkey breast for a quiet Thanksgiving celebration for two at home this last year. It was fabulous even without the winter fruit chutney. We're making it again for dinner with friends. The turkey comes out so moist and delicious and the glaze is to die for! Definitely a great twist on the "same ol'" bird.

I used a brinkman as well, with combo of alder, apple & hickory. For 14.5 lb bird, cooked in the brinkman for 5 hours (it was cold outside!), then finished to thigh temp (about 1 hr in a 350 degree oven with loose foil tent). Turned out beautifully...moist and lovely color.

The turkey was very moist which is always the way we want it. However, the sesame oil WAY overpowered the turkey and the gravy and any taste of what was in the brine. I will make this again but NOT with the sesame oil. The winter fruit chutney was perfect for a change from the usual cranberry sause.

We made this recipe two years ago on a weber. We are repeating this recipe by popular demand. Weather makes a huge difference in cooking time.

WOW! This was excellent and won rave reviews at a dinner party. I made the following modifications (because we don't own a smoker): I used a Cameron Stovetop Smoker with hickory wood chips, tented aluminum foil over the turkey and cooked it on a gas grill. Maintaining the grill temp at about 400, the 12 lb. turkey cooked in 2.5 hours. I can't recommend this highly enough!

Absolutely excellent! The brine does the trick, keeping the turkey meat moist and succulent. Since my Webber BBQ doesn't allow me to place the turkey 6" above the flames, I decided to use our Jet-Stream Oven (high-speed convection)...done in about 1-1/2 hours (12 lb. Turkey). Based on the popularity, will make a larger bird next time!

I did this with a turkey breast in a clay cooker. Followed the same instructions but injected some of the glaze into the turkey breast. Soaked the clay cooker for 15 minutes, brushed the turkey with the olive oil/sesame seed oil and finished it with the maple glaze for the last hour. All in an easy to clean clay cooker and convection oven.Fabulous!

This was very good, I'm sure it would have been better if I didn't have to swap to dried ground ginger & anise seed (limited resources available on short notice). I soaked the bird overnight in a doubled plastic garbage bag which worked well. However, the best part turned out to be the gravy made from the drippings with the maple syrup. My guests where scrapping the bottom of the bowl & looking for more!

I'll never put a turkey in the oven again! This is without question the most flavorful and moist turkey I have tasted. It was also fun to prepare; I used a Weber kettle, and kept expecting the fire department to appear as smoke billowed through the neighborhood each time I added wood chips, and neighbors to show up at the door hoping for an invitation after inhaling the aroma wafting down the street. It didn't bother me that my brother and I both smelled like bacon after tending the grill. A note about selecting a turkey: be sure it is not pre-basted or salted. I had to read many labels before finding a "fresh" turkey with no additives.

This was our first Thankgiving dinner at our new home as newlyweds :-) and I wanted it to be special, and I looked everywhere for recipes (magazines, other web sites, but at the end, I picked all of my recipes from epicurious, I should have known... I love this site). This turkey, was the center of attention at our home too, since no one had actually done a turkey on the grill before. My husband had never done a turkey before, and it was awesome to see him get so involved in the dinner preparation! We brined for about 20 hours, used soaked mesquite wood chips. The sweet glaze at the end was delicious. We will definately be making this again... but I don't know if I can wait until next Thanksgiving dinner for it!!

Thanksgiving was approaching and I wanted something speciala. After perusing the Epicurious recipes and especially their reviews, I decided to try this barbecued turkey. A great decision! The bird was fun to prepare, the center of attention from family and guests, and spawned many compliments. Make it again? You bet...with confidence. Any future cooks may want to note the following preparation notes. I 'brined' the turkey (12#) for 24h and rinsed it thoroughly. Got up on Thanksgiving day to start the charcoal in a small 'waterbath' smoker (Brinkman)at 6am, bird into smoker at 7am, out of smoker at 3pm and served at 3:30pm. We used soaked hickory chips for smoke (added about every hour) and kept the bird in a disposable aluminum cook tray while on the grill. This saved the juices which helped the gravy later in the day. The glaze was great in final browning of the bird (probably the most beautiful colored bird I've ever prepared...25 years of doing this) and added a sweet accent to the smoked turkey. Thanks to all the previous reviewers of this recipe... you were right!

For years I have made smoked turkey for Thanksgiving dinner. Last year I made this turkey for my gathering of 40 family members. Several of the ladies asked for the recipe. Most told me that there was a lot of work envolved, but we all agreed that it was well worth it. I am making this turkey again for the family to enjoy.

We served this for a buffet birthday dinner. It was a big hit! The winter chutney was a very nice accompaniment. I also put out some Honey Mustard sauce that some people preferred. We prepared the turkey on a gas Weber grill and used the spit -- a 19 lb. turkey just fit! It came out tender, moist and flavorful with a nice smoky undertone. Would definitely do this again!

A wonderful recipe for a juicy and most flavorful BBQ'd turkey. The marinade, and the 24 hours duration, is a critical success factor. We used a Jennie O breast of turkey, and baked it for an hour before putting on the BBQ. We did not enjoy the taste of the oranges, or the maple in the resulting gravy. (So, next time, we'll just use the Jennie O package independent of the drippings) And although the glaze was interesting with the maple, we will not try that again. Because the 24 hour brine marinade results in such a juicy turkey, we will continue to use our favorite and simple poultry marinades, like lemon juice and a bit of olive oil.

We made this turkey for Thanksgiving this year, and it was such a hit that we were requested to make it again for Christmas.

I prepared this turkey using a roasting rack on a full sized weber kettle bbq. I used a 20.lbs bird. Between the roasting rack and the pan..the turkey was a close fit...(1/2 inch to big) so the very top part of the breast did not brown....but it was still incrediable..I would recommend about 18.5 lbs bird if you use a rack and the weber kettle. But the Turkey was incrediable...everyone said it was the best they'd ever had....and who am I to dis-agree..will do it again in a heart beat.

The best turkey I have ever made. I hickory smoked the turkey(23 lbs) at 200 degrees F for almost 20 hours in a convection smoker and the bird lost only about one half a cup of juice during the whole process. My mother took some home and the next day, I got a call from someone who had tried it and asked if I would smoke them one next year. Thanks.

This is absolutely the best! We used Jack Daniels mustard. We normally do two turkeys--one to eat and one for leftovers. Leftovers are just as moist the next day. In a rush, we have used Hi Mountain Game Bird or Poultry Brine Mix with pure maple sugar. It is fabulous! We have done our turkeys like this since the recipe first came out, and we do not just limit it to Thanksgiving or Christmas. We've done this for a friend's open house party and for Easter.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to slow-smoke it over a grill, so I just added to the brine a little bit of "liquid smoke" from a gourmet shop to get the "smokiness". Then I just let the turkey marinate for a complete 24 hrs. I think you'd shortchange the burst of wonderful flavors and the juiciness if you let it marinate for any less time because there's so much meat to marinate. I also took a small kitchen trash bag and doubled it, poured in the brine and let the turkey marinate in that. Putting it in a garbage bag made it much easier to store it my refrig also because I was able to stand it upright in the back of the refrig. This turkey is definitely well worth the time, and I'll be making it every year from now on as a special part of our meal. If you don't feel like grilling - just bake it instead. Whatever you choose, don't miss this wonderful, juicy, most flavorful turkey! Friends are still raving and asking if I'm making it this year. :)

Succulent and got raves at a big gathering. After reading some of the reviews of the recipe here I opted to use only 3/4 cup of coarse salt in the brine vs the 1 cup. I didn't have a container large enough to hold my 22 lb. turkey in the brine so I got creative and put it in a large plastic garbage bag and doubled bagged it so it wouldn't leak, put the turkey in the bag, poured the brine in the bag, and put a large twist-on-tie around the bag down close to the turkey. I only soaked the bird in the brine about 4 hours and it seemed to be enough for a moist tender bird, though longer might impart more of the brine flavors. It really was a delicious turkey!! Can't wait to make it again.

We tried this for our family Thanksgiving 11/98 ... it was fabulous! Everyone loved it and commented on the moistness of the turkey. This is a "make again" for next year.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Loved the brine soak, made the meat juicy & tender. The glaze was excellent - although the ginger wasn't strong enough. I used mesquite, would use something different next time.

Overall excellent. Recommend making a sauce with the maple-mustard. The soaking made the turkey meat a little salty(especially for someone who uses little salt). The ginger/star anise taste did not come thru in the meat. Don't know if this part was worth it. The glaze is fantastic.

This was done in a Webbers 21" kettle. It was very good however I will next try it in a New Brunsfels Smoker and slooooly smoke the turkey. The key is to dry out well and use a lighter wood such as apple or even Pecan to smoke. not too much however. Slooow smoking is key!
