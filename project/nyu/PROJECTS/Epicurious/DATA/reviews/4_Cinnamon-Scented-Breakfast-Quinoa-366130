I didn't taste much of the cinnamon when I made it, despite placing 2 fresh sticks in. Regardless, it was yummy with 1 tsp honey and half a cup of blueberries. I think next time I'll add nuts for a little extra crunch. Very filling and a great way to start the day!

I made it with all white quinoa and it still excellent!

A great hot breakfast cereal alternative. I added 4 cardamom pods ... chai quinoa!

I mix my quinoa with cinnamon, raspberries, walnuts, and agave nectar to sweeten it. I'd be lying if I said it tasted great, but if you want to start out the day with something healthy this is the perfect meal for you.

Great breakfast. I cooked this like I do steel cut oats: night before, boiled the water and added quinoa, covered and set aside. This morning just heated through and it was lovely. Next I'm going to try using almond milk in place of the water. Children devoured with peaches and cream!

I LOVE quinoa! And was so excited to find a recipe that used it for a sweeter dish. Added a touch of milk, walnuts, raspberries, blackberries, pancake syrup. When I make this again, I will probably crumble the walnuts, dice up the raspberries and blackberries - mainly so that they go further in the meal. Smells delicious. I think the kind of cinnamon sticks you use may have an effect on the strength of smell. Mine were off brand ($7 still!) but I bet a stronger (and more expensive stick) would make the scent stronger - which would have been nice.

I love this sweeter preparation of quinoa. Most recipes are pilaf-like concoctions. I also made it savory with butter-fried, thinly sliced onions and whole raisins, which was very tasty.

This was ridiculously easy (easier than oatmeal, which is also easy!) and very yummy! I have to admit I was rather skeptical - I love quinoa but usually eat it with a stir-fry or stew. This did the trick! The nutty flavor really works for breakfast. I used almonds and cranberries and topped with maple syrup and some almond milk. Deelicious - will be having it again tomorrow.

This was the perfect autumn weekend breakfast. I added golden raisins, ground cinnamon, a little half and half and brown sugar at the end. Very good!

I don't like the taste of Quinoa on it's own but I love the texture so I have tried many different preparations in my quest to fall in love with the grain. This recipe is fantastic. I skipped the 1/4 teaspoon of salt in preparing the quinoa, sprinkling a little bit of regular sea salt over the end result. I also substituted sliced almonds in place of walnuts. Very yummy. This may be my new breakfast staple.

Not bad for a healthy breakfast. I tossed in golden raisins then topped with milk, honey and sea salt. My husband is the big quinoa fan, while I on the other hand struggle a bit with the texture. This I will eat though! Yummy!
