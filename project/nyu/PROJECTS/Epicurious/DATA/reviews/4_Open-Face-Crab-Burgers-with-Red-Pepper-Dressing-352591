So good. Loved the roasted red peppers. I made bigger burgers and served them on kaiser rolls with lettuce and tomato.

These are so delicious! I've made them a couple of times, but this last time I didn't realize I was almost out of Panko...I ended up substituting half regular bread crumbs and it came out fine. I also nixed the bread...trying to eat a bit healthier...served them on a bed of arugula instead and they were fantastic. My husband raves everytime!

This is a killer recipe. Most crab cakes are a turn-off because they are leaden and greasy. These are not. No matter what bread you use (I used soft onion rolls), they still seem delicate. Some people say that the will not come up to my house unless I make these. I love them as well. The sauce is what makes these so good and a friend always asks that I make extra for her. You can use it on fish as well.

I was not very impressed with this recipe. I felt like it was missing something and that the sauce took away from the burger. Very edible but not something to talk about.

I have made this recipe twice this week we liked it so much. It's absolutely delicious and the sauce is a perfect compliment.

Excellent! Used 1/2 of the amt of sriracha since my husband is sensitive to spicy hot foods, and it was still very tasty! Yummy!

I made 4 using cupful amounts of the crab, and it was very good. Instead of putting the bread in the broiler, I buttered it, and put it in a hot frying pan to brown it....much easier.

This is an incredible recipe, and I will be adding it to my list of regulars. I made four crab cakes instead of twelve, and served it as a dinner portion sans ciabatta.

this was excellent. The presentation was really nice, flavors melded wonderfully. Crab flavor was very evident even with all the other ingredients. Very easy to make. I don't really think the bread is necessary but it made for a nice look. I'll make it again.

This is great I made the crab cakes larger and served it without the bun as entree for a dinner party. My guests raved about the cakes and I was told the dressing was to die for.

Delicious crab cakes/burgers and sauce. Made as written except I used fresh red bell pepper instead of roasted. Excellent.

I've made this three times. It makes a really moist, delicious crab cake. The sause is excellent, but I would make more than the amount suggested. I buy lump crab at Costco for $13 per pound. Yum!

Oops - I meant "wincing", not "winching". I'll edit better next time...

Hey, for those of you winching at the price of crab (and who isn't?), use the imitation krabmeat. It tastes good and doesn't bankrupt you. I've used it in various crab recipes before, and it's okay. Not absolutely wonderfully great, but good.

Ofcourse this recipe is singing my song because I love and live for seafood. I have a few crab patty recipes of my own and I always prefer "Jumbo Lump Crab Meat" for that rustic texture and great flavor. I'll make this again but I might alter with one of my recipes for crab cakes.
