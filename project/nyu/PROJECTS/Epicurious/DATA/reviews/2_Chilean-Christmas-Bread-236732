In Chile, the term Pascua refers to Christmas as well as Easter. To distinguish between the two, Easter is often referred to as "Pascua de la Resurrección".

Panettone tastes so much better and fluffier!! This was a real waste of time making Pan de Pascua when you're better off buying Panettone. It's way too dry! Shouldn't it be named Pan de Navidad? Pascua is Easter!

This recipe seems more like Panettone than Pan de Pascua. The Pan de Pascua has a darker dough and has nuts, for instance.

Can you please explain why something eaten on "Navidad" Christmas should be called Pascua or Easter (or Passover)?

This one may be a bit tough if you are a new bread maker. Well worth the effort and if it doesnt work as well as you expected it makes a great start for a delicious bread pudding.
