I forgot to add--I have to agree with mbuckl2 about the peanut sauce. Next time I'll reduce the peanut butter by half. There were so many other great flavors that didn't shine through enough because of overwhelming peanut flavor.

Quite good. I didn't have annatto oil so I crumbled some saffron into olive oil for the color. I did feel like the peanut sauce was a little oily. Next time I would cut the oil to 1 tbsp. I didn't have any trouble keeping the potato cakes together, but that probably had something to do with my method...I made the potatoes the day beforehand and stuck them in the 'fridge overnight. For my first batch they did fall apart. I figured that if the cheese were slightly melted it would help the cakes to stay together, so I microwaved the potato mixture for two 30 second increments. I then used a large serving spoon and a rounded silicone spatula to shape the cakes into patties. They were still a bit delicate, but I found that if I used both utensils to turn them when needed, they stayed together just fine. And after that first batch (I made smaller cakes--cocktail size--so there were several batches) I didn't add any oil. The dry heat also helped them stay together, I think. They were something different that I enjoyed and I plan to make them again when I'm craving filling, hearty food.

These were pretty good. Nothing superb. They will turn to piles of mush if you use too much oil; found that out with the first batch. Keep it to little or no oil for a crispy, golden exterior. The peanut sauce was good, but the peanut butter flavor definitely overwhelmed it. This isn't an amazing recipe.

So yummy!...but I used Monteray Jack because I couldn't find munster. With all the cheese, it isn't really necessary to use oil for frying..maybe just a little not stick spray. Peanut sauce was excellent too! Will use it with Chicken Satay!

Llapingachos are wonderful! But I'm surprised to see Munster cheese used in them. Here in Ecuador we use a fresh, white cheese.

These are excellent. I've eaten these in Quito where they are extremely popular, and this recipe comes very close. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about regarding nonstick pans. They're pretty much everywhere and I don't know anyone that doesn't have one. But if you don't, a good cast iron skillet works well too. Enjoy!

nice flavors but pancakes they were not. basically a pile of mush. who has nonstick pans, didn't teflon go out in the early 70's. hard to believe they are still using them in ecuador.
