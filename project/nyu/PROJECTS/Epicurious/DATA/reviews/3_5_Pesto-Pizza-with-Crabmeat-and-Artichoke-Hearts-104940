Do yourself a favor--go the extra mile and make your own crust! This pizza is FANTASTIC on homemade crust; my family and guests couldn't get enough! And...it's so easy if you use the "dough cycle" on your bread machine. Ingredients for the dough (will be nice and thick): 4 cups flour; 1 tsp. salt; 1 Tbsp. active dry yeast; 1 Tbsp. olive oil; 1 1/2 cups water. When dough is ready, pat out on pizza pan that has been dusted with corn meal. Then follow directions for topping pizza.

Really good, especially with Trader Joe's herb pizza dough. I would use only 1 c of mozzarella though, it was too much for the crust and buried the taste of the crab, etc. I would also add more pepper. Definitely will make again!

I liked this favor combination a lot and was pleased by how easy it was make. However, the toppings were too much for one pizza--I ended up using two crusts. That's not really a complaint, but it would have been good to know.

I used pizza dough from a local bakery, and leftover pistachio pesto from the chicken breasts stuffed with pesto recipe also on this site. I added red bell pepper, and cut the crab meat and artichoke by about half. It was a huge success. Fiance loved it, and I will definitely make this again and again.

The pesto was too strong and I just don't like bottled artichoke hearts. A waste of perfectly good crab. I do like pizza and have had some really good ones from epicurious, but this isn't one of them.

Made it for a crowd at an annual Pizza/Wine tasting. They loved it! Make it again next year! Crab offsets the salty olive/artichoke heart perfectly. Great flavor combo.

This was great. I followed the recipe exactly, using homemade pesto and a Boboli crust. Very rich, tasty, and satisfying. Next time I will use shrimp as suggested by another reviewer. I made this pizza and another from this site--the roasted garlic & sun-dried tomato one. Although both were great, I won't serve them together again. Much too rich!

I try many different pizza recipes and this one sounded so good but the entire family thought it was only so-so. Was a waste of the crabmeat..should of made crabcakes with it instead!

Excellent recipe. The pesto is a nice change from tomato sauce-based pizzas. The recipe would be equally as good even without the crabmeat, or you could substitute grilled or blackened shrimp.

Yum! Made it twice already! Used green olives stuffed with garlic for some kick and it was loved by all. Made it with the Texas Caesar recipe, which was yum, too.

I made this dish without the black olives and substituted the mozzarella with smoked gouda and the results were great.

The pesto, marinated artichokes and crab made it a bit salty. It was very good and because it was heavy, one pizza goes a long way! I think it would be an excellent summertime supper item or a party item. I'm making it next time with pizza sauce instead of pesto. It really was quick and easy to make.
