So good! First time braising beef and it was super easy. It was fork tender after 3 hours but I wanted it even more tender so I turned it down to 250 and cooked it for another 4 hours. Definitely wait 2-3 days after you make it. Totally worth it! Made sandwiches and empanadas with leftovers and I can't wait to make this again!

The key to this entire recipe lies in the cooks note at the end, made this dish 3 days ago and was very underwhelmed, reheated it last night and it was fantastic! Make ahead and you won't be disappointed!

Excellent. I used a pressure cooker (one hour total time), had no celery, and used bacon instead of pancetta. It was meltingly tender, and the flavor was superb. (Grass fed organic beef to thank for the richness of the roast.) Highly recommend. It's fool proof.

Great recipe--the meat absolutely falls apart. Great recommendation on serving it with creamy polenta as well. I did make it with a slow cooker instead (took longer) and used a cheap Shiraz isntead of a Barolo. We were truly blown away by how good this entire dish is. (Highly recommend letting it sit 2 days.)

I browned the chuck roast (grass fed, organic--worth springing for, much more so than for the wine) and then cooked for just an hour in a pressure cooker. Saves time and energy, and flavors and texture are just as meltingly delicious as braising forever. Easy recipe.

Made this for a party last night and everyone loved it. I used a nice Zinfandel because that's what I had and cooked it longer than the recipe calls for. Once cooked, I removed the beef and strained the liquid, then returned liquid and beef to the pot and refrigerated it for a couple days. Yesterday I skimmed the fat off and warmed it for quite a while in a 275 degree oven. We had so much food I didn't make polenta, but that would have been a good choice to soak up the juice.

Rating: 2
For the amount of work involved in this, I expected a much better flavor. I made a few modifications - used broth instead of water, bacon instead of pancetta, and two-buck-chuck cab from Trader Joe's instead of Barolo. Perhaps it was the cheap wine, but something just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, and it's unique, but I was expecting AMAZING per the other reviews. Just wasn't there. I served it with Trader Joe's pesto tortelini, which was exceptional.

This is one of the best recipes I have made. On its own it is delicious, but with polenta it is to die for. The combination of flavors really adds.

This was delicious! I didn't have the fresh herbs, so I used dried and accidently grabbed the sage instead of the thyme....was still very tasty! I wish I had read the reviews and I would have used beef broth istead of the water. Oh well---next time! Served it with polenta and beets on the side; a perfect winter meal here in the mountains. A great take on the normal roast!

I love this recipe, and so does everyone who is a recipient. Please plan ahead so the flavors have time to meld. Use fresh ingredients and don't sweat over the wine. I usually purchase a bottle of Ravenswood Zinfandel. Sometimes I use a Malbec. I never spend more than $10 for a bottle. I serve it with Roasted garlic mashed potatoes, fresh steamed green beans and a wonderful sourdough bread to soak up the juices. This is my "go to" roast recipe.

Rating: 3
Since I don't get much practice cooking meat, I followed this recipe pretty exactly. I used a good Valpolicella because it was $10 less than the Barolo (although still not cheap). The one part of the recipe that was not clear to me: Are you supposed to cook the sauce down before you put it in the frig or afterwards? I chose to do the latter and kept it in the frig for 2 days -- turning it 4 - 5 times because I was afraid the top would dry out. Pot roast was far superior to the bland pot roasts I grew up eating but I don't know if was so extraordinary as other reviewers make it out to be.

This really is a very yummy meal. Very glad I read the reviews; I used an Argentinian Cab. Sauv. ($13) and it worked great, used bacon instead of pancetta, did the 1 lb. bag of baby carrots instead of just one, left out the celery (don't like), and used beef broth in place of water. I was only able to find small roasts around 2lbs each, so I bought two, and turned them every half hour--took 3 hours total and the meat was beginning to fall apart. I opted to make ahead and wait 3 days; I left the roast in with the sauce to soak up the flavors. Note: it will not look very juicy when you get it back out, especially after peeling off the orange grease (a little harder probably with the carrots sticking through it, but not bad). I added a little water before reheating in the oven--and it took longer than 30 minutes to reheat. We waited 45, and though it was hot enough, we still had to microwave for a minute to get a good serving temp. Did not need to reduce sauce. Served it with egg noodles, which we really liked. I will make this again and again--yum!

The layers of flavor that came out of this recipe were fabulous! I served on a bed of creamy polenta with the braised beef in the middle of the polenta and roasted asparagas tucked in around the sides. Generously spooned the rich sauce over all. It was as delicious a dish as we have experienced at our favorite tapas restaurant, Toro Bravo, in Portland, OR. I used a nice, inexpensive, Merlot and tri tip roast. I pressed as much broth/sauce through a collander as possible with the bowl of a ladel to capture all the rich goodness of the ingedients. What's left in the collander should be used as a condiment to compliment the polenta. Wonderful.

Rating: 4
Instead of the chopped carrot, I dumped a 1 lb. bag of baby carrots into the mix and they were quite possibly the best carrots ever. Plus, I didn't have to make a separate veggie. The chef's note is right: left-overs are to die for (if there are any, that is).

Rating: 4
Seems like a no-fail recipe. I used Two-Buck Chuck Cabernet (Charles Shaw from Trader Joe's) with great results. It was comfort food of the Gods. Accompanied at my table by creamy corn grits with romano cheese. It was so good that no one said a word for five minutes after the food hit the table.

Excellent. The first time was already a hit even I just used water in instead of beef broth. I will try with beef broth next time.

This was insanely good. Not a speck left over after a dinner party last week. I took the exellent suggestions of the other reviewers and use low sodium beef broth instead of water and I turned it twice during the cooking. I made a slightly larger roast, 4.5 pound chuck and after 2 1/2 hours there was no need to slice it, it fell into beautiful, juicy chuncks. Used an $8 bottle of malbec to boot. I'm making this agin this weekend. AWESOME

I just made this tonight and after braising for two and a half hours I found the meat wasn't as tender as I would have expected. I should have followed another reviewer's recommendation to turn the roast every 1/2 hour. The sauce was delicious despite having used a considerably cheaper red wine (Spanish granacha) and bacon. I'll make this again but won't forget to rotate the roast.

According to Bill Buford in his book "Heat", even Mario Batali didn't use Barolo in his restaurant's Brasato al Barolo (even though the menu named the dish as such). Instead they used an inexpensive Merlot. Most people wouldn't know the difference. Just don't use something you wouldn't drink straight.

I don't give 4 fork lightly, so when I say that this is good, I mean it. I certainly did not use Barolo for the braising liquid, because I would be ecstatic to DRINK Barolo, much less cook with it. The Zinfandel that I used worked just fine. I used beef broth instead of water, which I think was a good idea. I'll use it again next time, but I'll probably use low-sodium broth. Another reviewer suggested tying up the rosemary in a cheese cloth, and I think that I'll do that next time. I don't want to strain the braising liquid because I like the chunks of veggies, but the presence of the rosemary leaves is indeed a little less that perfect. I might also try a less fatty cut of meat just for health reasons. I think that it might also make for a better presentation, which might make this a company-worthy dish. I will probably make this again on another long, cold winter afternoon.

this is the best roast ever! I used diced peppered bacon instead of pancetta. used a great local $9 bottle of wine. used beef demi glace, beef broth and water for the liquid. definately make 2-3 days ahead and only use fresh herbs. added mushrooms. it was a huge hit and I will make it forever. served over mashed potatoes with cream cheese, sour cream, and butter.

I made this for company last week and got rave reviews. I served it with roasted carrots, truffled mashed potatoes and salad. I used a bottom round roast and substituted Barolo for a $17 bottle of wine recommended by the wine store (he laughed when I told him I was looking for Barolo to cook with). I omitted the pancetta. I added sauteed mushrooms to the gravy, which I cooked down and strained a little.

This is incredible. I will make the day before from now on as the leftovers were awesome, and it'd be nice to weed out more of the fat.

This is a wonderful recipe. I make it often. You can actually use any kind of roast, my favorite is the tri-tip roast. When simmering in the oven, I remove the roast at 90 minutes and slice it into 3/4 inch slices. I then return the meat to the oven for the remaining 90 minutes. Served with risotto, this dish is heavenly! It is hard to wait the two or three days in the refridgerator. It usually doesn't last that long!

Over a year ago a friend of mine sent me the link for this recipe and said, "Make this." Next time, I won't wait so long. This was delicious! It makes this cheap cut of meat taste like a prize. For wine, I used a Yellow Tail shiraz from Bevmo. It too is good quality considering the cheap price-- fruity with nice tannins. My polenta came out more like grits, but oh well. Next time I'll whip up garlic mashed potatoes. Note to A Cook from global: Merriam Webster defines unctuous: 1 a: fatty, oily b: smooth and greasy in texture or appearance. Chuck roast is a fatty cut. This dish is indeed unctuous and I love it for that. I also love duck and goose and greens cooked in bacon grease. If you can't take the meat, stay outta the bitchin'.

I first tried this recipe when it appeared in Gourmet. I love it, and I would not vary the ingredients much. My only tip is to turn the roast every half hour, so that it comes out juicy.

This is a pretty basic recipe but it was a great jumping off point. Of necessity I changed it by adding 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and used a port instead of a full-bodied red, I also finely chopped mushrooms into the sauce. I was forced to use garlic powder and dried crushed rosemary also. With the addition of carrots, mushrooms and potatoes to the mix and cooking it on the stove top... I think it came out great. Tasted phenomenal.

Yum! Didn't use Barolo, but used another flavorful red wine and dish was excellent. I wanted more vegetables, so I did everything according to recipe, but an hour and a half before it was done I threw in large chunks of celery, carrots, onions, and parsnips. I used a turkey roasting pot since I knew I would need space for the veggies. This caused an easily fixable problem: there was not enough liquid. So I added more wine and some beef broth and problem solved. I also found it was very important to have a tight fitting lid so the liquid didn't evaporate too quickly. My lid wasn't tight, so I used aluminum foil to seal. I did not find it necessary to reduce the sauce at the end, just spooned it over the plates to serve. Everyone loved this and the leftovers are fantastic.

I tried this recipe last evening for guests, along with the Creamy Polenta, which had firmed up by the time it was served, and was pleased with the result, although I think the vegetable additions were too finely chopped (easily changed next time) and I have some left over for my supper tonight so will enjoy the enriched flavor of the beef. The polenta would do well with a little richer flavor - will use chicken stock next time.

I had to check to make sure that "unctuous" didn't have some meaning I was unaware of when that is the world used to describe the dish this recipe is supposed to produce. I've cooked hundreds of recipes from this site and have had some true culinary pleasures, but I'll steer clear from anything meant to produce something that is: 1. characterized by excessive piousness or moralistic fervor, esp. in an affected manner; excessively smooth, suave, or smug. 2. of the nature of or characteristic of an unguent or ointment; oily; greasy. 3. having an oily or soapy feel, as certain minerals.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed. My main problem is that there was very little liquid (other than fat) left over at the end - I had to add a considerable amount of water back in order to make anything close to a sauce rather than a veggie paste. Even after removing the fat from the top after taking it out of the fridge the next day it was really very oily. If I were to try this again I would probably try a different cut and lower the temp of the oven a bit.

I don't agree that this is an average pot roast recipe. I did doctor it somewhat by increasing the amount of the fresh spices, adding more tomato paste, using beef broth vs water, increasing the amount of vegetables, ok I doctored it alot! The basic elements are good they just need more intensity. Boiling down at the end and then adding over the polenta really is the key to making it especially scrumptous!

I made this wonderful roast last weekend for a dinner for 10 people. I cooked three Angus roasts, which were not excessively fat, and what fat there was was easily removed after refrigerating. The gravy was delicious on roasted garlic mashed potatoes. I froze the leftover meat and sauce separately. I just hope that when I reheat it the results will be half as good as it was straight from the oven!

Really tasty recipe, but I just can't get over how fatty the meat is. Any suggestions for a leaner cut that might also work? Also, couldn't get fresh herbs, so used 1 tsp thyme & 1 Tbsp rosemary instead. If my kitchen could always smell this great...

This roast is DROP DEAD DELISH!. I think you should add at least one or two more forks. I would give this 5 forks if possible. I followed the advice of cook from Santa Barbara and kept it in the oven for 5 hours at the lower temp. I have been making pot roast since high button shoes, and this is the best I have ever made. I didn't cook down the gravy or strain it (we like gravy with everything in it) except for the sticks from the rosemary. I usually put bay leaf in my roasts, but I like it better without it. The only bad thing is I had no leftovers so I'll have to do it again very soon.

after reading this recipe, I couldn't wait to try it! I loved the smell of everything while cooking it, but was disappointed that it didn't taste as good as it smelled.

The only mistake I made was in not making either mashed potatoes or polenta to serve alongside. I made the beef on Sunday, and served it Wednesday, but with egg noodles.

I made this three days in advance as suggested with a good bottle of Valpolicella. We really enjoyed this served over mashed potatoes and the sauce was delicious. I am not accustomed to making such fatty cuts of meat and I felt my presentation suffered after I tried to cut some of it out before re-adding to the sauce. But I was able to skim off the fat before rewarming in the oven and I am so glad I did. I am sure I will make this again in the future.

This was fabulous! It was even better the next day and 2 days later. I used beef broth instead of water and Charles Shaw Shiraz instead of the Barolo. I used the 'prefab' tube polenta and that was excellent.

One word "amazing." I used a cotes du rhone to make the beef and we drank a barolo. I used Minor's beef base instead of water, but used a little less base than usual to avoid over salting. I didn't need to skim the fat. I believe because I used an Angus beef chuck that seemed a little leaner than the other choices in my store. I served it over a creamy polenta laced with boursin cheese. I sliced the meat, which could have been done without a knife it was so tender, placed it over the polenta and drizzled the beautiful rich sauce and vegetables over the top. Served a little side of rabe sauteed in garlic, oil and hot pepper flakes. These items together with a sip of wine between each bite was a match made in heaven. It makes more than 4 servings (more like 6 to 8) and my husband couldn't wait for the leftovers for lunch and dinner for a few days (I never allow leftovers to hang out that long but he oohed and ahhhed every time.

We loved this recipe! It was perfect on a freezing cold Sat. night in Boston for dinner with special friends. I only wish that I had read all the reviews before making the recipe. I cooked the beef in the morning, put the pot in the fridge to "meld" for the afternoon, and then warmed up the beef in the pot as directed. I should have spooned off the fat before rewarming. Oh well, what's a little cholesterol? I can't wait til tonight -- leftovers. And we served the beef with risotto. A perfect accompaniement.

I have made this dish several times, with and without Barolo, and I must admit that the Barolo makes it much more special, but expensive. I doubled the onion and carrot, skipped the water and added a can of drained tomatoes (used only 1 T. paste, 1 T. flour) and some parsley. I usually strain the sauce after allowing it to thicken for 15 to 20 minutes. It is absolutely wonderful a day or two later, if you can wait ...

I hate negative reviews by people who make substitutions. My substitutions did no harm to the recipe and maybe benefited it. I cooked the roast at 250-275 for 5 hours. At the recommended temp, the liquid was boiling, not simmering. I also added an extra cup of wine, and substituted beef stock for the water. It was a little salty, but not overly. The meat MELTED in my mouth and guests were licking their plates. When I make this again, I will not substitute beef broth, or I'd use homemade no salt broth. I would cook longer at a lower temp. It guarantees a tender meat. Lastly, I cooked the meat the day before, sliced it and let it sit in the liquid. I simmered it for 1 hour to reheat. The meat was infused with flavor from the herbs in the liquid.

Made this last night with the creamy polenta and it was a huge hit. Wish I had done it a few days in advance but we ate it right after preparation and it was still excellent. We have leftovers so I am looking forward to seeing if it really is that much better after a few days. Also, I had a bottle of Barolo at home but couldn't see using it in the recipe given the cost so I used a cabernet and drank the Barolo with dinner. I thought it turned out just perfect even with the Cab.

This is a beautiful dish. Served with the creamy polenta, to which I added about 1/2 cup of grated parmesan when stirring in the butter. I scraped the fat off the top of the beef dish after chilling overnight. It smelled so good in the oven, we couldn't wait a whole 3 days for the flavors to meld, but 24 hrs was fine! This is a good way to make a very cheap cut of beef taste exquisite. Not fancy exquisite, but homey, rustic exquisite. I also threw about 6 whole garlic cloves in the sauce when I put it in the oven. My husband thought those were the best part - spread them on bread!

It was a coincidence that I had one of the recommended wines on hand, so I tried this dish. I really liked it (so far) except I thought the pancetta was odd... I understand why it's in the recipe but with the wine addition it took on a weird color. It smelled so good last night that my husband had a small portion and he can't wait to have it tonight for a full dinner now that the flavors have had time to settle. Easy, quick, and super hearty.

We loved it, including our two children and our company. The flavors were great, and I did follow the suggestion of preparing it 3 days ahead and letting the flavors intensify. The only thing I did differently was to keep the meat and sauce seperate in the fridge for a couple of hours in order to let the fat solidify on top of the sauce. It was fairly easy to remove once it was solid, and then I combined the sauce and meat for the rest of the stay in the fridge.This is not your average "roast"!

Wow, what a wonderful dish! Read other reviews and decided to eliminate the polenta and served the beef with par boiled mini red potatoes brushed with olive oil and sprinkeled with finely chopped rosemary and powdered garlic then broiled until golden brown. Superb!

Absolutely loved it. I used a Valpolicella (sp?) and beef broth. Snipped the rosemary superfine with little herb shears, could taste the rosemary but it wasn't bitter. It really did get better over time. I ate it three nights in a row. I have heard unctious used to describe wine before...this recipe is thick, rich and yes "oily" but in a most fantastic way.

yes, the flavor did improve with age!! We enjoy it enough to serve it (aged) when we have "the boss" over for dinner

This was so incredible. We look for Sunday Football recipes and this one was awesome, lasted through three dinners actually, we had it southern style over homemade french fries last night. A definite do over, as is. No doubt.

I added a couple tablespoons of honey and one tablespoon of Worchester sauce. I think this added more depth and balance.

It was a huge hit at our yearly Homeowners Assn. pot luck, the plate was licked clean. I made a double reciepe and froze the 2nd for later enjoyment. Thanks for a great keeper

I made the recipe exactly as written the first time and would give it 3 1/2 forks as is. Next time I will substitute some beef broth for some of the water and I will strain the solids from the sauce. I didn't care for the rosemary leaves in the sauce. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. It is yummy recipe.

Excellent! Perfect for a very cold winter dinner. Even my daughter's picky friend liked it. I served it over polenta and had a tossed green salad.

A stunning dish and well worth the extensive prep time. I wonder what nuclear powered stove is being used to reduce the mixtures in five minutes!?

Amazing dish that is going into my recipe Hall of Fame. So excited for the leftovers as I doubled the recipe. The roasts really do shrink to about a little lees than half their original size. Made it two days ahead of time - tasted MUCH better this way because I also tried it when it was finished to see what it tasted like. I used a $10 bottle of Bolla Valpolicella. I finely chopped the vegetables up in a food processor before cooking them - made the braising liquid ready to serve at the end. Substituted low salt beef broth for the water. Reducing the braising liquid takes 20 minutes, not 5 minutes. I also cut up the roasts into chunks and made sure it was all submerged in the braising liquid while it was in the fridge for 2 days. The orange colored oil peeled off the top of it very nicely when cooled.

This dish is fabulous! Not hard to prepare, and it makes a great presentation. I also used 1 cup beef stock and 1 cup water. For the wine I used the Valpolicella. I didn't ask the salesperson in the wine shop how much the Barolo was - he blanched when I said I was going to be cooking with it, and steered me to the Valpolicella! You should plan to prepare this dish at least one day in advance, it really needs overnight for the flavors to marry, and for the fat to rise and solidify on the surface. It was a breeze to just lift it off. Then I cut the meat when it was cold, much easier to do. I removed the thyme sprigs at this time. Don't be concerned about the rosemary, it either disintegrates or you can eat it. And then I cooked it again for another 1.5hrs @ 325, and then lowered the oven to 250 for an hr. The meat just melted in our mouths! I also found no need to cook down the sauce, it was plenty thick, and there wouldn't have been enough if I had cooked it down. To the person who thinks there is too much meat per person with a 3lb roast, the meat undergoes considerable shrinkage during the cooking process. I fed 4 adults with enough leftover to feed another. The only recipe I have in my repetoire that I like better than this is a beef daube made with short ribs.

Delicious, we loved it. Used parsnips instead of celery root. The vegetables were great glazed in the braising liquid.

Absolutely delicious! I had this at a relative's house the week before, and it was so good I was craving it again the next week. Made this last night and it was just as good. Used a dry Tuscan wine and served with mashed potatoes and a salad. My only suggestion is to put the herbs in a cheesecloth: one of the rosemary stems disintegrated and I had to spend 5 minutes fishing out stray rosemary leaves. Also, it took more than 5 minutes for the sauce to reduce. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. A perfect hearty dish for cold winter nights; also a great dish for company since it needs minimal prep and very little attention once in the oven, but makes the whole house smell wonderful.

I knew the second I saw the photo that I would be making this, and soon! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Yellowtail merlot. It was incredibly delicious! I too, was worried about all the rosemary leaves floating around even after plucking out the stems, but I never even noticed them while eating. They had softened up completely. I served it with the polenta (another fab recipe, which I added some parm to), and garlic green beans. The 2nd night we had leftovers and I served them with sauteed spinach. Delish! This dish is so savory and intensely flavorful. I will definitely be making it again.

I haven't tried this yet, but it is on my list based on the reviews. Wouldn't others really appreciate having nutritional info for the recipes as shown? I am a Weight Watcher and try to keep track of my calories, fats and fibers. I would love to see every recipe show me what I am really choosing to eat.

I make a simplified version of this recipe, using dried herbs and lots of fresh onions and garlic. It's great! It's especially good for tough cuts of meat. Toward the middle of cooking, I add diced sweet and white potatoes, and carrots- then you have a whole meal ready to serve your guests. Good stuff.

I greatly enjoyed those comments relating to the recipe writer's use of the word "unctuous". Everyone assumed the writer had commited a malapropism. Perhaps the writer is a vegetarian?

This recipe is amazing! I made it with what I had in the house, substituted reg bacon for pancetta and left out the herbs, still the best dish I ever made!!!!! Cooked the roast for 3 hours and it fell apart. Added more carrots and cut them into tiny circles so that there was somewhat of a veggie in the dish.

So, so, so delicious! I made 1 1/2 times the recipe -- served it with garlic mashed potatoes the first night and then had it on pasta as leftovers. A new family favorite that we'll make over and over again!

This was really good. I made it with a piece of chuck and the meat was just fall-apart delicious after about 2 hours. I subbed low-salt beef stock for all of the water and I used whatever merlot was in the fridge. I used my immersion blender to puree the sauce and give it more thickness. My only complaint was that the rosemary leaves (is that the right word?) were everywhere. I picked a bunch of them out but I couldn't get them all and they're not so good to eat. Pancetta is, I think, key to the rich flavor.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but the description is hilarious. Unctuous usually means oily and unappealing when pertaining to food. Somebody needs to consult their dictionary before trying out new words.

I made this the night before, and it was amazing! My guests loved it. I added a little butter to my sauce to thicken it up, otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.

Great recipe, but even allowing for shrinkage, in what nutritional guidelines would one EVER find that 3-3.5 lbs of meat serves 4? My cardiologist would faint!

I added half the water and added the rest in beef stock..a rich and tasty sauce!!Delicious recipe

Sooooo good. Made it Saturday and had it today. Very tender. No pancetta nor Barolo in my neighbourhood so I used bacon...and a cheaper wine. A definite keeper.

I made this basically to the recipe- it was New Years' day(....), and I had a limited supplies on hand: fresh oregano in lieu of fresh rosemary; apple wood smoked bacon and left over salumi/prosciutto cold cuts for the pancetta; and beer plus red wine in favor of the water(!). My husband and Father-in-Law ADORED this meat dish! The pot has absolutley NO remains of left overs. This is in my reportoire for ever now. I served with yogurt and roasted garlic smashed potatoes. Huge Hit!!!

This dish was delicous, the itailian version of Beef Burgundy. The recipe says serves four but it would easily have served 6-7. Next time I will strain the solids from the sauce. The polenta was the perfect pairing. I liked how the mush firmed up under the meat and sauce. Yumm.

I made the standing rib roast in the December issue for 14 people on Christmas and spent over $300 for the meat. I made this on New Year's for the same crowd and spent $12 on the meat. I enjoyed this recipe a whole lot more! Great winter comfort food.

This was excellent. We ate it the same day it was made and used cheap Farnese wine and it was still very good. Didn't change anything otherwise.

This is a GREAT recipe, a new favorite. I followed the recipe exactly and loved the results. However, the next time I make it I will reduce the sauce a little more. There was plenty of sauce and even if I reduce it more, there will still be more than enough.

This was fantastic. A HUGE hit with my family. I took the recipe's advice and made it 2 days in advance. It was delicious--an easy way to impress guests!

Fantastic. I substitued one of the varietals recommended and made it 2 days ahead. Absolutely fabulous. My only issue is that there was less sauce than expected so no need to reduce after removing the meat to cut. One of the best tasting dishes I've ever made.
