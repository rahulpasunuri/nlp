I first made this for an Easter Brunch and have since made it every Easter. Once I had to take ingredients to a yurt on skis and I substituted Pepperidge Farm Puff Pasty, which I now use instead of messing with the phyllo. I have used this as an appetizer, on a buffet, and as a main. I am generous with the dill.

Made this for a brunch for twelve, and it was wonderful. I used more than 5 phyllo sheets (about 8?), and used them to line an 8 x 11 Pyrex dish. I prepared the crust the night before, and the filling, and chilled them overnight, separate. Then in the a.m., while doing prep of other brunch dishes it was so easy to pour in the filling and bake. The phyllo came up too high on the sides of the dish, so I crimped it down, and brushed liberally with melted butter. It was delicious, and the rectangular shape worked well for a crowd, cutting easily into twelve bar-shaped portions.

The recipe was good, but not outstanding. The crust was interesting, but messy as it crumbled all over the kitchen without adding a lot to the taste.

This was delicious. I received many complements on it at our Easter Brunch. It is great for a buffet since you can make it ahead and serve it room temp or slightly warmed. It goes together quickly too. I'd definitely make it again when I'm entertaining.

I served this dish as part of Mother's Day brunch. I substituted 4 beaten egg whites and 1 whole egg for the 3 large eggs. The tart was light, creamy and absolutely delicious. The mom's loved it (and so did I!)

I suggest replacing the cup of whipped cream with a cup of light ricotta cheese. The phylo preparation was long, but worth it. Served this for Brunch - everyone liked it!

Epicurious, please tell me how this qualifies as a "meatless" dish for Easter?

Very easy to make and yes, very creamy! Love the phyllo dough and I'll try adding some Havarti next time as mentioned in previous review. I also sprinkled with a little Lemon-Pepper seasoning before serving.... Delicious! KIMBER

Substituted evaporated skim milk for both creams, and it turned out great. Also added a little grated Havarti (1/3 c) since it goes so well with salmon and dill.

Made this last minute for a party, substituted canned salmon and added some smoke flavor which may have reduced the salmon taste somewhat (I thought). The texture was very creamy and my friends devoured it to rave reviews. I'd personally give it a 2-fork rating but my friends would protest, so 3-forks it is.

I substituted a grainy mustard and red onion with very good results.
