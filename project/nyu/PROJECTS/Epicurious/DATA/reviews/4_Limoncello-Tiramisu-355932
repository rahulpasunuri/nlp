I just made this desert. I'm confused on the directions; seems that that the syrup you make in the sauce pan was only use to dip the lady fingers? Right? It seemed that there was no other use for it? Please help! The rest of the receipt seem to work very well! Can't wait to eat it ,as we're taking to a friend's for dinner for a Italian food. She doesn't like coffee so I thought she'd love this, can't wait!,

I've made this dessert many times, and it is always a hit, not to mention a great alternative to classic tiramisu for non-coffee lovers. Allow some time to make it, though, and it's really best when it has a lot of time to set (ideally overnight).

Very, very light and flavorful. Be sure to use the drier ladyfingers as stated. Worth the extra work!

This was wonderful. I added a layer of crushed raspberries in the middle. It cut perfectly and looked great on a plate drizzled with seedless raspberry sauce. Because it can be made two days ahead, I will make this again for Easter. It looks like Spring. Can a dessert be light AND rich? This one is that and more.

I'm making it for the second time today. It is delicious, presents well, and a sure crowd pleaser. I followed the recipe as written.

I am interested in making this for a board meeting. Anyone know about how many individual servings this will make? I love Lidia and love lemon, sounds awesome!

I am a beginner, and served Limoncello Tiramisu, for my nieces birthday party and it was fabulous! Everyone loved it! Will definitely do this again! I was scared because of all of the steps and did make some mistakes, but no one could tell. Thanks!!!!!

I have made this several times as it appeared on this site some time ago and it is always fantastic. I often put it together in individual goblets, looks great and can be done in advance.
