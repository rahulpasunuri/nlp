This chutney seemed a good base, but I felt it needed the addition of chili, ginger, sundried tomatoes,and a little mustard seed. Nice to try something different, especially where there is a glut of bell peppers around in the summer months.

I make this chutney every Thankgiving and it always receives rave reviews. Someone always asks me for the recipe. It's great with turkey and chicken, but would also be delicious with pork. Yum!

I love chutneys, but this one doesn't really work. The apricots are the predominant ingredient, and the chutney simply tastes like dried fruit saturated in vinegar. There are better chutneys out there.
