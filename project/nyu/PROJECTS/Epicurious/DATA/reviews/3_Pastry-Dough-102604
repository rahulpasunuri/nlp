It was a hassle to make, it was really dry but really sticky and it crumbled everywhere when it was done baking. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, it tasted fine but I have a much better (stress-free) recipe at home.

The edges fell off and the shell shrank. When presentation is important, Why bother?

This is an exceptional, shortbread like, pastry crust. I will use it for all tarts in the future.

I usually have trouble with collapsing edges on butter pastries. Does anyone have a solution? Thank you.

Very good. Added 1TBL sugar to it. Made day ahead. Only problem, when I pre-baked it, my decorative edges collapsed. Used w/pumpkin pie
