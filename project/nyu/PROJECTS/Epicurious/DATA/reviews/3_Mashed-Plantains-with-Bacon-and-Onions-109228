These were okay - they need more flavor. I added roasted green chili and it helped but still needed something more.

A well made Mangu is a wonderful dish. I think this recipe would be much better if you add some garlic. Also, the main difference between Mofongo and Mangu is that Mofongo is made from mashed FRIED plaintains whereas Mangu uses boiled plaintains. Whatever you add to it is a matter of personal taste. I personally prefer the taste and texture of Mofongo.

I made these after we returned from a trip to Vieques, P.R., where we enjoyed mofongo, which uses pork cracklings instead of bacon. We very much enjoyed this recipe. I did not use as much milk -- just a cup instead of 1.5 cups, which seemed like too much. We'll definitely have it again.Thank you to A Cook from Geneva for the other suggestions. They sound great.

I haven't made this recipe, but I'm Dominican and make mangu all the time, for Sunday breakfast or weekday dinner. I don't put bacon in, I just mash the plantains with their own water, salt, and a little butter until soft. They are delicious with fried eggs sunny-side up, topped with sauteed onions with a dash of vinegar (for a tart kick). Many dominicans also love it with fried sausage (salchichon) and white cheese. Not for someone on a diet, but will make any hangover go away. To the previous reviewer, yes, you can also make sweet mangu with ripe (but not too ripe)plantains, which works with salty white cheese or sausage stew (with a LOT of tomato sauce... mmm). My parents love mangu with a stew of salted, smoked herring (arenque guisado).

definitely a tasty, fun side dish to add to any mexican/latino based meal, but i didnt go crazy over it. everyone enjoyed it for sure, but i think i prefer plantains when they are riper and thus sweeter.
