I used this recipe as a topping for chicken pot pie and as a base for an onion-leek quiche. It worked fabulously on both occasions.

I made the Pecan Cranberry Tart using this tart shell recipe. I did not knead the dough as suggested. The dough rolls out thin so it was a little difficult to get it into the tart pan. I patched it as necessary and it worked out just fine and tasted light and was a little flakey - not crumbley.
