quick and easy dinner. A toasted whole wheat pita makes a nice bread base for this dish. Also, my egg yolks were nowhere near being done at 8 minutes of boiling. I recommend cooking them for at least twice as long.

the sun-dried tomatoes do indeed make it interesting. i felt this needed something more, though. i ended up adding capers, which helped by adding a nice tart green flavor to contrast with the buttery- olive and the sweet-tomato flavors. i think fresh chopped parsley would be a good addition too, in that vein - hopefully i'll have some next time.
