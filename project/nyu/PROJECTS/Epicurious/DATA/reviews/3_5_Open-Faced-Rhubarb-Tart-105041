Love this!!(with some minor modifications). Making this as a rustic crust has not - in 3 tries - worked for me; the rhubarb keeps seeping through the crust. This time I simply put the dough into a tart pan, and it was pefect - and looked beautiful too. I've made it with & without the glaze. Both are good, but I like the glaze. Tonight the only jam was chokecherry (it's a New Mexico thing), so used that & added a little orange liqueur. Also used a cup of raspberries because I had them (very nice, but not necessary). The blanched almonds add another flavor dimension to it. Very subtle, very sohisticated. The crowd raved.

This recipe is one of my favorites for using the first vegetable of spring: rhubarb. It's utterly beautiful and there is never a piece leftover. People LOVE IT.

The crust is fine and tasty, good shortbread. I did chill 2 hours in plastic wrap (recipe says 1 hour minimum), and about half an hour once the rhubarb was on top (recipe says 15 minutes), but I doubt the few degrees cooler made any difference once it was in the hot oven. Topping is also tasty, though the brown sugar I used was rather ugly once it was out of the oven...it tasted better than white sugar would have, though :-) Did not use the apricot jam; try a drizzle of chocolate instead, or enjoy as-is.

Sorry, but 1 cup of flour blended with 3/4 cup of butter just doesn't work. This tart melted away to nothing in the oven.

Love this recipe, and glad the rhubarb season lasts through the summer! Wonderful! Have made it many times and each time every last crumb is gone! The visual artistic element of laying out the rhubarb pieces like a big open rose adds a nice touch.

this recipe is one that my children ask for when rhubarb is in season. It looks as good as it looks. It is a great desert for company or any time

Really Delicious! Just wanted to let everyone know that some very finnicky younger eaters actually licked the pie plate clean and begged for more!! I guess I know what I am doing today! The crust is like a shortbread (YUM) and FYI I didn't have almonds so I tossed quick oats in with the rhubarb - and it worked perfectly - I will try this crust with many other fruits.

Not that exciting. For a truly wonderful rhubarb dessert, try the Rhubarb Raspberry Pie from Gourmet--though it is a bit more involved to make. I'll keep looking for the perfect quick rhubarb tart.

Delicious, not too sweet. Crust is great, not at all greasy as another reviewer (who did not actually try it) posited. Picture perfect too. You may not need quite as much rhubarb as indicated. I had 4 oz. that I couldn't squeeze on the tart.

This was excellent - wonderful flavor and it has a gorgeous presentation. I got raves from all my guests, even those who aren't normally rhubarb fans.

We have tried this with great success. It's a good introduction for people who have never tried rhubarb. Thanks.

I have not made this tart nor would I. The pastry sounds very scary. l cup flour to 3/4 cup butter? I like rich pastry, but I know that this is way to much butter. 1 cup flour to 1/2 cup butter makes a perfect, buttery pastry. Any one dare .... make sure to line your oven with tin foil.
