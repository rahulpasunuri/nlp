Followed previous suggestion of eliminating the half and half and use 2 Tbl of greek yogurt and 1/4C of milk. Super easy and tasty. Used immersion blender for easy clean up. Kids requested I make again.

Reading other reviews first helped, so knew to cook peas longer and use plenty of mint. I did not have 1/2 & 1/2, so used 2 Tablespoons sour cream and 2 Tablespoons milk. Put immersion blender in pan to mix instead of using food processor. (makes for such easy cleanup) Turned out wonderfully.

Everyone loved this, including a 1 1/2 year old, who ended up licking the left over container clean. Will make again and share the recipe. So easy!

I have discovered that I seem to have an aversion to pureed vegetables, other than squash, potatoes and cauliflower. I thought this would be a fun green side dish for St. Patrick's Day, but it looked fairly disgusting and tasted . . . just odd. It was not eaten.

This was really good! Next time though, I will boil the peas a little more because they were still hard after 4 min... and I will add more mint.... but it was great... I served it as a side with steak. My husband love it!

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe as it was, but managed to salvage it by turning it into ravioli stuffing. I added some sauteed shallots, lemon zest, ricotta, parmesan cheese, and some nutmeg, stuffed the new mixture into wonton wrappers and served it with gorgonzola cream sauce. It was spectacular!

I wish I could have taken a picture when I presented this dish at our Christmas table. The bright green got everyone's attention! Despite the incredibly bright colour it's very delish...

I served this at Easter and it was a big hit. Everyone asked for the recipe. And it is so easy to make!

This recipe is very easy to make and is a dynamite companion to grilled lamb. The flavors are very fresh and spring-like.

We've made this many times now. It's very beautiful -- the peas are a lovely green -- and the mint seems to disappear while adding something special. No one will be able to identify the hidden ingredient. We make it often for holidays.

My husband and I love this recipe. We make it every Christmas with roast beef and yorkshire pudding.
