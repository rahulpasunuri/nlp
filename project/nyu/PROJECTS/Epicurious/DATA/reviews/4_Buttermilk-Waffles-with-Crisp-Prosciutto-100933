This has been our little family's standard waffle recipe (minus prosciutto) for our seven years of marriage and is much loved. We have reduced the butter over the years, we make a quadruple recipe and put in 2 sticks of butter, so we reduce the butter to 4T per recipe. We make it in a standard four square waffle iron, about 1/4 cup of batter per square. Delicious fresh, and the extras go into the freezer and are rewarmed in the toaster oven at 350 for 6-8 minutes.

We love this simpler recipe!! I add some orange zest to the batter sometimes for a little added flavor. Simple and wonderful!!!

Excellent. Perfect taste and texture for a belgian waffle. Tried using smart balance so I wouldn't feel so bad about eating all that butter and it still turns out great.

I really messed with this (not all on purpose) and they came out CRISPY! I doubled the recipe but forgot to add the butter! Added only 5 tbs total(with a dash of vanilla) at the end and they still came out great. To give them a bit of a nutritional boost I threw in a heaping 1/4 cup of wheat germ and a dash of milk to make up for the additional dry ingredient. Didn't serve Prosciutto. Yes, Bisquick might be easier but it has ingredients that are not so great...I am going to add a bit of Oat Bran to the next batch for some fiber!

EXCELLENT. used a standard 4-waffle iron and skipped the meat, as was making for kids. had to guess a little at how much batter for my waffle iron  for those of you with the standard 4-waffle kind, a double recipe of this makes 3 irons full (or 12 individual waffles), so a single would make 1.5 irons/ 6 waffles.

This is a good (but not great) basic waffle recipe. The waffles are light, not dense. I reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons with no issue and put crumbled cooked bacon into the batter rather than prosciutto on the side. It was well-received by my family, but is nothing outstanding.

I made this sans prosciutto and thought the batter was very good.

We made this recipe (minus the prosciutto) for our kid's Mickey Mouse waffle maker. The batter made about 3-4 waffles. Considering the amount of butter we cut back to 3T - and it still makes for more than 15g of fat per waffle. While delicious, they are not everyday waffles!

We used this recipe (minus the proscuitto) for the kids' Mickey Mouse waffle maker. It made about 3-4 waffles this way, and with 5T of butter... well that's a lot of fat per waffle! We cut the butter back to 3T and still it is 15 grams of fat per waffle. While delicious, it's not an everyday recipe!

Is the prosciutto non-essential or did people a. Did not want to spent the 16 bucks a pound or b. Did not get any and just said the hell with it.. hmmm. Great basic waffle recipe, prosciutto adds a smokiness and an elegance that could warrant a sunday brunch and some mimosas. If you want a pronounced buttermilk flavor then add artificial buttermilk flavoring like Mcdonald's does.

I have been trying to come up with a waffle recipe that will please everyone in my family (2 boys and husband). I think this one is it. My kids loved them, and my husband said several times that they were "awesome." I added 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Did not serve with the prosciutto. The boys poured Mrs. Butterworth on them. They were big, fat, sweet waffles.

My family loves these waffles! To get them even crispier, my husband likes to put them in the toaster for a minute or two. Don't bother with the prosciutto.

This was a good recipe. At first, I didn't think it would taste very good, but it turned out quite delicious. I added vanilla to the batter to give it more of a punch and the addition worked out well.

My husband and son are waffle hounds, so I have tried many recipes, but this is the best. The texture is light and not at all rubbery, unlike some other recipes. Also, there is no taste of leavening agents. The recipe works well in my ski house, where the altitude (4,000 feet) often causes batters to rise too far, too fast. It doubles easily, which is important in my house, especially since the recipe makes a scant two servings, with no spare batter to use if I burn a waffle or miscalculate the amount of batter needed and have to throw one out. The prosciutto is not at all important.

Not much different than bisquick? The waffles came out good and were enjoyed by all who tried them. There wasn't much of a buttermilk flavor though and for the amount of work there wasn't any noticeable differnce between this scratch version and Bisquick waffles. Prosciutto was nice but not really worth getting another pan dirty.

Wonderful! The recipe is perfect to serve two. We both liked the slight outside crispness, leading to a nice inside texture. The batter looks like tapioca pudding, but is a great consistency for the waffle iron. I am looking for excuses to make these again - despite the calories found in waffles.

The Best! I made these for friends on a ski trip and had to make 4 batches. I've already been asked to make them next year.

These were excellent. I doubled the recipe and it made only 4 waffles using a 6" round Belgian waffle iron (the batter is so thick, I don't think triplicating the recipe would work). The prosciutto is a nice addition but not essential.

The waffles were absolutely delicious. I would definitely make them a part of a brunch. Guy Comment: For best results, dump a bunch of blueberries on top, cover with syrup, and top it all off with freshly whipped cream. 3 thumbs up.

I made these waffles for the Tuesday Breakfast Club, and the ladies all loved them. They are light, crispy and very tasty - especially with real Vermont maple syrup! Great recipe!

Great crispy waffles. This has become my new favorite waffle recipe.
