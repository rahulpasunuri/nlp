Sensational! I fry sage leaves in very little coconut oil for a very shot time and they are perfect. Oh, so delicious.

Really really good, but it was very sweet for a first course. Maybe it would be better with apples? Or as dessert? Also I didn't deep fry the sage leaves, just sauteed them with some olive oil. It was pretty easy and very elegant.

Loved it! Made it with D'anjou pears and lime juice and it was wonderful! A Valentine's Day treat!

You can't get food this good in four star restraunts! But... the correct pears are essential. Other pears are too watery.

This was extraordinary! It is extremely quick and simple to prepare, and makes a very impressive and delicious first course. My only suggestion is that the pears cool down quite quickly so if you plan to serve many pear slices, it's best to have a number of large pans going so that they can all sauté at once.

I love pears but I had never had them cooked. I was skeptical at first but I was hooked after the first tender bite. They were so deliciuos that i had them two more times that week as a side dish. The flavors of all the ingredients come together incredibly well. I recommend crumbling the fried sage over the pears before serving.

excellent recipe. i chose pears that were ripe but still firm and used a mixture of bosc and d'anjou. sauteing the pears concentrated the pears' natural flavor and sweetness. used chevre in place of the bleu cheese and threw on some cherry tomato halves for color. will definitely make it again.

A simple and elegant dish to serve to company. Very tasty.

Very tasty. Pears may have been too ripe so they broke during cooking and were difficult to spear but still very good. Sage leaves were good but tricky - two seconds is very fast, so use larger leaves for easier retrieval from hot oil. I charred quite a few.

I've made this several times, makes an easy and impressive first course and uses up my giant sage plant. A perfect fall first course.

This is really easy to make & everyone LOVED it. The sage leaves take a bit of time to deal with, but they turned out better than the ones i've had at a restaurant. Well worth the effort.
