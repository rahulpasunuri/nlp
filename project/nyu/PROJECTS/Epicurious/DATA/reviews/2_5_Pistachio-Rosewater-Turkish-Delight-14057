This IS a wonderful recipe!!! Just make sure that you change the 1/8 cup of water to 3/4 cup. If you do the math, when it says 'add the remaining water' you will see that 1/8 cup doesn't add up. So change that to 3/4 cup. Also, at the end, it says to cut them into 1/8 inch pieces. This obviously was a missprint. Those you have tried and failed, try my changes. You won't be sorry. It is scrumptious!!!

I wish I had read some of these other reviews before spending all the time, trouble and money on this recipe. I'm kind of upset so I'm not going to go through all the things wrong with it but just as a for instance. Try to mix 1/8 cup water with 1 cup of cornstarch. Just try. My advice? Find another recipe.

While this recipe is a fast and easy one, please remember in Canada (Ontario at least) unless otherwise specified, gelatin is porcine (pig) based. To some this may not make a difference, but if making this sweetmeat, especially during Ramadan you might want to consider carageenan, pectic, agar agar.

Store bought Turkish Delight is my favorite candy, but this recipe is really disappointing. The taste is just plain nasty..

Bleck! Part of this is my fault for attempting to improvise. I used clear apple cider instead of rosewater. It's true - you cannot dissolve that much cornstarch in so little water, and the liquid in the recipe doesn't jive. I added orange extract, but it is still blah, and without the food coloring it looks like grayish dishwater. Doesn't taste too much better either.

It's great, but for more taste, i added the juice of half a lemon and half an orange, with one teaspoon of the zest of each of those fruits. and yes i agree, for the cornstartch, you need about 3/4 cup water not 1/8. try adding 5 or 6 drops of the red coloring, it will give you a very nice color.

Didn't make it -- it's not an authentic lokum recipe. Real lokum has (needs) no gelatine; this is a "trick" to try to get around what really makes lokum the great candy it is: a long long cooking time, as in about an hour and a half, during which it needs to be stirred/scraped constantly. Easier to bite the bullet and buy it. :)

Everyone in my family liked it, but this recipe makes a *lot*! However, This recipe is time consuming and detailed. To be made once a year, maybe.

The only fault I find with this recipe it that it has and error in it. Where it says stir together 1/8 cup cold water & cornstarch use 3/4 Cup water. Also, cutting them into 1/8" Cubes is too small, that should be 3/4" cubes.

It was okay, couldn't get the powdered sugar to stick and it didn't have enough taste. I think it would've been better with more sugar.

Beware the mistakes in this recipe. The amount of water doesn't match between the instructions (wrong) and the ingredient list (right). You can't mix that much cornstarch with that little water!

Mmmm. I used almonds in place of pistachios and colored this with a few drops of beet juice for a very natural version. Great with tea or after a meal ... and very low fat.
