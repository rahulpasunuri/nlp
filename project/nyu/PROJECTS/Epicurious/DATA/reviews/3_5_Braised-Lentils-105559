I used vegetable broth in this recipe instead of the chicken broth. The lentils were fantastic. I used the le puy variety. The aroma while cooking this dish is mouthwatering!

Not bad, but these beans need salt. Waiting until the end is too late but at the beginning makes the beans too firm. I cooked them until they were about half-way done (25 min) then added 1/2 tsp salt. If the beans finish before the water is all absorbed, remove the lid and let the excess evaporate. I also added a pad of butter to the finished dish to give it a more luxurious mouth feel. Yum

This is lentil perfection. Used lentils de puy and served this with rack of lamb. Great combo.

I turn this dish into a main course by browning 4 chicken thighs in olive oil, then cooking them in the stock with some rosemary and thyme sprigs. I then stain the stock to be added back in later, and when the chicken has cooled, remove the meat and discard the skin and bones. During the last 15 minutes of cooking time which, I think is better at 45 minutes, I add the chicken meat. Delicious one pot meal. A sqeeze of lemon to serve really livens it up.

love this recipe... i agree with the previous reviewers - 1,500 mL is more than enough liquid. I added 4 diced cloves fresh garlic as well as some indian spice (roughly 1 tsp each of ground cumin, tumeric and a home made masala mix and a about 1/3 tsp cayenne pepper) in the first stage... and mixed in handfuls of roughly chopped fresh parsley and arugula just prior to serving and while the lentils were warm enough to get the greens to wilt. i crumbled some good goat's milk feta overtop and with toasted pita... and found we had a complete, light meal and super delicious meal.

I have made this recipe several times, adjusting the amount of liquid, and settling on 2 cups as my preferred amount. An easy, tasty way to prepare lentils.

As another reviewer said, a very good base. This is a good, healthy, adaptable recipe that could be modified dozens of ways as a side dish or a main. Try it, enjoy, and repeat.

Yummy, simple recipe that will be added to our regular routine. We added garlic, as suggested, as well as fresh parsley and sage at the end. I followed the suggestion of reducing liquid to two cups, and found the lentils a bit too firm this way for my liking. Will up it to three cups next time, and cook a bit longer than 30 min.

This is an excellent recipe and one I will use often! Made it as a main course and added spicy chicken sausage. Quick, easy, delicious- perfect!

These lentils were very tasty. Based on previous review, I reduced the amount of stock in half. They were perfect this way. You either need to reduce the liquid or double the cooking time.

This is my favorite recipe for lentils made even better when I used duck stock. Wow it blew our socks off! I just switch up the stock now and then depending on what we are serving with. I will have to try it with lamb stock I also have some in the freezer.

I took this recipe with me to Hawaii when we were staying in a condo. Fasy and easy, with lot of flavour. This has become one of my staple dishes

I added some chicken and apple sausage to make this a main dish. It tasted good, but there was way too much liquid--it was basically a soup. Next time I'll reduce the liquid to about 2 or 2.5 cups.

this is just such a great side dish, a great blank slate that you can add things like bacon, goat cheese, ect. I think there is about 1 c. too much stock however and next time will cut it down to 3 c.

I am trying to get more grains into our diet, so this recipe fit the bill. I forgot to add the garlic, like other reviewers, so I plan to do that next time. We are going to be travelling and staying in a condo. This is the perfect dish to prepare with very little ingredients

This dish definitely cries out for garlic, which I added with the veges at the start. I too added extra fresh herbs (parsley and sage) at the end. We served the lentils with grilled chicken sausages on top which was a perfect complement. Leftovers the next day had crumbed feta added which also was great. Overall, an excellent and versatile recipe that I most certainly would make again.

This was wonderful, and a nice change of pace from normal side dishes. I added garlic, as other reviewers had mentioned, and salt to taste.

This was a great lentil receipe - I followed the advice of others and added some garlic and fresh sage near the end - it was really good. Also I soaked the lentils for 24 hrs. before making them

I loved this rustic side dish as an accompaniment to simple roasted chicken on a cold winter night. I did add two cloves of garlic, and would probably add a couple more than that next time. I agree with the reviewer who said that some fresh herbs stirred in at the end would be great too--mint or parsley, or perhaps a bit of both.

I also added 2 cloves of garlic and used vegetarian broth-excellent, loved it, and easy.

My 12 year old son made this, as it was so easy. He substituted vegetable broth and added a clove of garlic. Delicious lenten or vegan dish.

This dish was very good, and even tastier the next day. In addition to the onion etc., I also added a clove of garlic, diced red pepper, sun dried tomatoes, and mushrooms when sauteeing the vegetables.

Oh My--Oh My this is unbelievable....thanks to the cook from western new york for the suggestion of lamb stock. I JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE SOME STOCK LEFTOVER FROM LAMB SHANKS IN THE FREEZER . I added only a few teaspoons perservings and it was even more--Oh MY-Oh My

This is the best lentil recipe that I've made. Added 2 cloves of garlic. Next time I might try it with lamb stock in place of chicken. This receipe is a keeper!

Loved this recipe. I had to use yellow onion and substitute 1 cup of water for 1 of the cups of chicken broth. Lentils are so tasty, though, it didn't matter. Served it with Chicken Vesuvio (the 1999 Bon Apetit recipe) -- talk about comfort food! Yum.

This was very good. I was looking for a different recipe for lentils, since we make lentil soup a lot. (My husband is allergic to sulfur and lentils help your body to get rid of sulphur--just in case anyone else could use this information! (: It really helps clear his allergies up.) This dish had a nice subtle flavor and was very easy to make.

This recipe is surprisingly yummy. very simple to make. I browned some chicken spciy andouille sausages in the pot before sauteeing the veggies and let them simmer with the the lentils. the spiciness added depth of flavor and made it more of a complete meal.

These lentils were delicious. A terrific accompaniment to a roast or pork chops. We had leftovers and reheated them the next day as a small dinner and loved them as a light main dish also. I'm going to try a little chopped pancetta in them next time. Perhaps a dash of sage would be nice for the fall also?

I also added garlic (2 cloves). Simple to make, good and healthy recipe, and the lentil dish was a delicious addition to our meal.

This dish was so easy to prepare and so good. I didn't have celery on hand, so I doubled the carrot and added about 1 tbs of diced garlic and it was just great. Everyone loved it, even though there were several people who didn' know what lentils were. Definitely will make again!

Easy, very good - even better with 4 or 5 sliced garlic clove and a handful of chopped parsley and a little chopped fresh mint stirred in at the end. Added the leftovers to beef broth, for a delicious, filling soup.

Made this as a side dish, mixed with wild rice and served with roast beef and fresh asparagus. Easy and delicious. My husband's family loved it too - they've never had lentils before - great way to introduce them!

Simple and delicious. This humble dish raised lentils to a new level. We had a dinner party of four with ecclectic tastes. I gave away my copy of the recipe. My partner single handedly prepared this dish. Like I said, simple. Goes beautifully with any lamb - a classic combination. Or dip into it with a flavoured bread like focaccia. That's what we had the leftovers with. Yum!
