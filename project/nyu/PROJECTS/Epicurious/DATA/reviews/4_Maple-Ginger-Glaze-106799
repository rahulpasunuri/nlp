This glaze is amazing! In addition to using it on turkey, I've used it on BBQ'd chicken and on oven baked pork chops. It gives meat a wonderful taste and look. Highly recomment it!

I was looking for something different for our Thanksgiving Turkey and what a hit...The entire family loved the taste. I was concerned about the little guys but they enjoyed Maple Ginger Glaze as well. This would go well with many meat dishes...I am thinking over a thick cut Pork Chop for my next dish.

I used the glaze for an old-fashioned ham. It was really delicious and pretty - we were all cheating and picking at all the glazed pieces! This is a very orangey glaze which worked well for the ham (didn't taste like maple to me at all) and so I will cut the orange somewhat (maybe use apple juice or cider) and up the maple syrup for a roasted chicken sometime. Great starter recipe for lots of variation.

I have made this twice now. Each time I've been out of one or two things, but followed the basic recipe, and used it at the end of roasting a turkey. The drippings made the most delicious gravy I've ever had. If you like a light colored gravy, this isn't it - even with adding some milk. Excellent flavor.

Incredibly yummy. I'll definitely make this glaze again; I think it would hold up well to wild duck, which we have a lot of around here these days.

A perfect component of the Maple Ginger turkey recipe it is part of, and would do well as a brushing sauce on its own for porkchops or grilled chicken.
