I also added butterscotch chips and let set in freezer before cutting. I baked them a little longer to make cookie a little firmer and they held together. I'm surprised more people haven't made them. I thought they were yummy and great with vanilla ice cream.I am freezing them and serving at my holiday party.The marshmellows and butterscotch add nice color too!

My chocoholic boyfriend loved this! However, I would suggest a few modifications. The 8" cookie didn't bake evenly and the batter spread so the cookies merged on the baking sheet. I'd suggest making smaller, more manageable rounds. I used walnuts and pecans and sprinkled butterscotch chips on top (in addition to the semi-sweet). Allow to cool more than 5 mins and use a pizza cutter to cut (if you make larger rounds). I hope this helps someone.
