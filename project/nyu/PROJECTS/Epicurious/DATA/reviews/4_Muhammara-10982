I brought this to a Christmas Day open house and used freshly made bread crumbs from two frozen gluten-free dinner rolls to accommodate my friends' dietary needs. They worked beautifully. I also used Aleppo pepper (1/2 tsp), and after researching a number of other recipes for this dish, I decided to add 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp of paprika. Everyone wants the recipe!

to A Cook From Australia - replace the bread crumbs with crumbled rice crackers for a gluten free version. May be even better than original

Help! I need to make this recipe gluten free. What can I replace the bread crumbs with?

Great recipe ! A little spicy, a little sweet and the bread crumbs give it the body it needs. I roasted the peppers in the oven for 35 minutes and added a little more of the spices

This dip is amazing. I used a can of whole Spanish pimientos. Two cloves of garlic was just right. I used Aleppo pepper since I had some. It's not as spicy so I probably used 2 to 3 times as much. The dip was a little runny so I added a bit more bread crumbs. I had some pomegranate molasses on hand but you can get it from a Middle Eastern grocery store. Or substitute some boiled down pomegranate juice or extra lemon juice. I served it with fresh pita triangles. It also was delicious with cubes of grilled pork.

I stole this recipe for my restaurant because it's ridiculously good. The garlic can be adjusted up or down to taste without sacrificing texture. For geographical authenticity and a kick of citrus along with heat, use Aleppo pepper flakes (which you can pick up at the Middle Eastern market with the molasses). ;)

This was very good! I give it only 3 forks because it didn't quite live up to my expectations (I made it my mission to learn how to make muhammara after having an absolutely divine version at a Lebanese place in London). I too made my own pomegranate molasses by reducing pomegranate juice. A note - I used 2 cloves of garlic and found it to be plenty (I can't imagine how strong it would have been had I used 4!)

i'm so stoked about this recipe, having made so many other versions. i'm especally thankful for the tip on concocting your own pomegranate molasses, and also the rice cake or oatmeal substition for the bread crumbs. i picked up on putting oatmeal through the processor for making meatballs in another recipe, and it's terrific. thanks everyone.

This has become a tradition for our family to serve on holidays. Less oil is good. Also you can make a serviceable pomegranate molasses by reducing pomegranate juice. I've also used a little agave syrup. We LOVE this stuff! Everyone who tries it has liked it and was quite surprised to find out what it was made of.

Wow. This is what I've craved every time I leave Rezza's in Asheville NC. I roasted the red peppers on the Big Green Egg (add about 30 minutes prep time) and followed the suggestions of fellow foodies and cut the olive oil. Great tip. I added an extra two teaspoons of pomegranate molasses to burst the flavors. I will make this again...and again...well you get it!

I roasted my own red peppers (used 3), decreased the oil to 2 tbsp, and sprinkled with a bit of sumac. I thought it was great! Super complex flavours that had everyone guessing. Delicious!

Rating: 3
This is an OK recipe, but not quite authentic enough to compare with what I have had in the Middle East. Use fresh roasted peppers, and the addition of a very small onion, a good bit more pomegranate molasses, and a teaspoon of sumac. The bread (any type- pita is good) should be added at the end, enough to thicken the dish to one's taste. A big hit with company and a very healthy appetizer or mezze!

I have been searching for a good Muhammara recipe forever and made this one when it first appeared in Gourmet but now that I followed the reviewers recommendations and reduced the oil (to 2 Tbsp) and used 3 freshly roasted peppers too - WOW. I went so crazy I made it twice in one week. The second time I used a jar of red pepper pesto from a gift basket and upped the lemon juice to cover the bottled taste. When I had just a touch left and didn't want to waste this yummy Muhammara I pureed it with some extra grilled eggplant and that was incredible too! Can you tell I love this recipe. I'm salivating as I type. Thank you to everyone for their recommendations will be making this one as long as I can still cook!!!

I doubled the recipe. I mixed in another type of sweet red pepper as well. Added herbed green olives and a little extra walnuts. I didn't have bread crumbs, but I realized they are necessary so I substituted it with quick oats. I'm no expert at Muhammara but it tastes superb!!

I crave this recipe. A great variety of flavor that leaves a good impression. Lots of room for interpretatio. I like extra oil and lemon. Sprinkle with dried sumac if you can find it.

Made this for a dinner party and LOVED it. Very easy to make. I roasted my own bell peppers by putting them in the over on broil at about 220 C on the wire rack (make sure there is a tray under!) and rotate them often until black on the outside. then when they are cool peel off the skin and take out the seeds. I also didn't have pomegranate molasses but you can make your own substitute by cooking pomegranate juice, sugar, and lemon juice.

Rating: 4
So good!!! Tastes just like my favorite Mediterranean restaurants with the garlic kicked up. I agree with other reviewers that the oil in the recipe is excessive. Just add oil till a desired consistency is reached. Also, I highly recommend looking for the pomegranate molasses at a Middle Eastern market because it's very affordable. FYI, it's also called pomegranate paste.

Rating: 1
I really wanted to love this. But didn't, at least strictly by the recipe. I agree with a previous review that jarred peppers have a very specific acidic taste. Next time I will roast my own. Also, I will try using smoked paprika instead of cumin. I agree about the amount of oil, it can be cut back on.

I just made a double batch of this for my husband to take to "dude's night"...and am now licking off the food processor. I used 1/4 cup of oil to placate my husband since he saw the recipe, but I agree with another reviewer that 2 tbsp for a double batch is plenty. Will have to make some more tomorrow night!

Fabulous! Thanks to the cook from Hanover, MA - the Pomegranate Molasses recipe worked beautifully. I was rushing around making this and misread the ingredient list, accidentally subbing Tablespoons for teaspoons when measuring the PM (d'oh!). To my surprise and relief, it didn't seem to hurt the recipe any. Some of those being served the dip did not enjoy hot food, so I had to turn the heat way down - just used a pinch of red pepper flakes. We will be taking this to another pot luck tomorrow, and I will be sure to use the correct amount of PM and turn up the heat a tad. I sauteed half of the garlic in some of the olive oil (adding it with the peppers, etc.), and it came out fine - not at all too garlicky. I also cut way back on the olive oil. Served with toasted pita chips (spray both sides w/olive oil, sprinkle w/s&p, cut into wedges and toast in 400F oven approx 7 minutes). This dip is as pretty as it is delicious!

For those of you who don't like cumin (like me), I put in some smokey paprika (pimenton de la vera), maybe a teaspoon or so, instead. Gave it a wonderful flavor. Also, if you have any gluten-free needs, I pulverized some rice cakes in place of the bread crumbs to serve this for a friend.

I've been making this recipe frequently -- ever since I had the good fortune of discovering it a few years ago. Lately I've been substituting almonds for walnuts with equally delicious results. I've roasted fresh peppers and also used jarred; I never noticed much of a difference so I use the jarred to cut down on prep time. I've only had one "gummy" batch (see previous review), and I think it had something to do with the bread I used (too chewy rather than crisp) and that I over- processed/mixed everything.

I just made this recipe to take to a New Year's Eve party. Made it exactly as the recipe dictated except I used plain bread crumbs. It tastes terrible. The consistency is gluey. I started with the scant 1/2 cup of oil and then tried a bit more. No help. Also, way too garlicky with just two cloves garlic

Rating: 2
The oil, as another reviewer has mentioned, is a bit much. With half the oil you still get a rich dip but with half the calories. However, the worst part of this recipe is the suggestion of using jared peppers. These add a more acidic taste than home roasted peppers. Yes it is more work, but the reward is a sweet, smoky rich dip that far surpases anything from a jar.

Rating: 4
So delicious! My party guests demolished it this weekend. Here's the thing about the olive oil: if you are making it in a food processor, and adding the olive oil very slowly, this is exactly the right amount to use. The slower you add it, the easier it is to make the oil emulsify, which gives the muhammara a silky texture, not too oily at all.

Rating: 2
Way too much oil in this recipe... it needs less than half a cup. Also needs a pinch more hot pepper (I used harissa instead of red pepper flakes) and WAY more bread crumbs and/or walnuts than called for. Too runny otherwise.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. Very very tasty. I did not want to use the bread crumbs so I increased the amount of walnuts, which I added at the end so I could keep a coarser texture. I agree with the other reviewers the oil can be cut down A LOT!

I invited my Italian neighbors over to experiment together on appetizers - this is a great one. I made the recipe exactly, taking the tip for less olive oil and served with light rice crackers. Then, we experimented with a cream cheese curry as a layer on the cracker - very good. And with a glass of red vino - wonderful!

I invited my neighbors Mike and Sandi over as guinea pigs to try out this recipe. I made it exactly as written with less oil, and light rice crackers instead of pitas. We all loved it, and even experimented with a cream cheese curry dip as a layer on the cracker. With some red vino, it all tastes wonderful!

I made this recipe for the first time about a month ago for my family and I've made about five more batches since then. It has made us forget all other condiments even when we cut back the oil by more than half. I gave a jar of pomegranate syrup and the recipe to a neighbor and she just called screaming in gastronomic ecstasy, too. Awesome. Just awesome.

Yum - I doubled the walnuts and omitted the breadcrumbs to make this a wheat free recipe. It was delicious. Thinned it with some juice from the red peppers jar. Lasted several days in the fridge, but eats best at room temp. I also decreased the olive oil to less than 1/2 cup thanks to other reviews.

This was delicious!!! I agree with everyone, you don't need that much oil. Just put as much in as you like. I went to an Iranian supermarket for some of the harder to find ingredients(pomegranate molasses). This dip is also nice if you are making a mediterrean meal. We had lamb burgers and spread it on top on the patty. YUMMY!!

Really, really good. And simple. Thanks to those who recommended using less olive oil than called for in the recipe - I used a scant 1/2 cup, and it was perfect. Spend an extra 30 seconds to make your own breadcrumbs using the food processor, which you'll be using to make the muhammara anyway. Don't buy ancient supermarket breadcrumbs that taste like sawdust.

Love this recipe because it's so easy and still tastes so great. MOst other muhammara recipes suggest you roast your own peppers. I didn't have time to find the molasses and actually used wild plum maple syrup which worked great. Will definitely make this again; even just as a snack to watch TV.

Sorry to be a dissenting voice, but we found this way too garlicky for our tastes (we used 3 cloves), and we love garlic. That said, we could envision this as spread for sandwiches, and that is the likely fate of our leftover muhammara. Interestingly, other published recipes for muhammara use no garlic at all, and we will likely give one of those a whirl.

Absolutely delicious, although I do make it 4-5 days in advance and it just tastes better. Do diminish the olive oil. This recipe makes too little for a crowd of 6 or more, so I always double the ingredients and use only 1/4 cup olive oil in all. I use the KitchenAid blender and it works fine.

This is great. I followed other reviewers and only used 1/3rd of the olive oil. I usually make hummus because it is probably a bit healthier and higher in fiber. But, I will add pomegrate molasses to my next batch of red pepper humus and will also make this again.

Tonight I served Muhammara for a Middle East dinner party. Everyone enthusiastically agreed it's a "10+!" I also cut the oil in half and made my own pomegranate molasses as suggested by the cook from Hanover, MA. A definite hit!

Having made a batch of pomegranate molasses last weekend, I went searching for uses. (Making your own - bring to boil 1 quart Trader Joe's Pomegranate Juice, 2/3 cup sugar, 2/3 cup lemon juice; simmer on low until reduced to 1-1/3 cups). Used TJ's roasted red & yellow peppers, and the lesser amount of EVOO as recommended by others. It's wonderful, and will become a staple. Not only as a dip or spread on pita, but can't wait to try this as condiment on a sandwich. Color is lovely, too.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight, and I'm already hooked. I always loved hummus and baba ghanouj, but neither compare to muhammara. The pomegranate syrup is a must, and if you live in the Minneapolis area, it can be found at some Cubs. Definitely cut the oil in half. I needed more than 1 tbsp to create a consistency that my blender could work with, but the full amount would have been way too much. Can hardly wait to have more of this stuff!

If you just cannot find Pomegranate Molasses, make your own. Simmer 4 cups Pomegranate juice (fresh squeezed or bottled from market) over medium heat 45-50 minutes. Syrup should coat the back of a spoon, but reducing to much will result in dark, sticky product. Store in sealed jar in refrigerator for up to 3 months. Another recipe and use for pomegranate syrup http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/rfcj/SPICESandCONDIMENTS/Pomegranate_Sauce_and_Molasses_-_pareve.html

This was really good. Like other reviewers, I cut the oil back by half. Next time I try it, I'll add a tablespoon or so of tahini.

There's probably nothing wrong with the quantity of the olive oil. What the recipe doesn't say is, you have to let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours so that the breadcrumbs soak up the liquids and you then get the dip consistency. I've been making muhammara for every party for the past five years and it's always the only thing people remember (except the name!).

I made this dip for my Culinary Arts class for a project I did on Middle Eastern food. It was suprisingly good! I never tasted anything like it before, but I am impressed. My whole class liked it. I made it word for word, except I substituted grenadine for the pomegranate molasses (I read on a Middle Eastern website that that is legal to do). And, like everyone else, I would also cut down on the oil next time, but just because it seemed too runny with all of it in.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. I highly, highly recommend toasting the pita bread with butter and cracked pepper (such a recipe is listed on epicurious--these even beat out the dip). I have to say I've been searching for pomegranite molasses for awhile now with no success, but I'm still on the look out. It was great without it so I can only imagine it with the pomegranite addition.

Easy, easy, easy--and so good people are asking about it a YEAR after I first made it! Authentic, too. Pomegranate molasses/syrup is key. Seek it out, and you'll see there's just no substitute. (Once you have it in the house, you'll find all kinds of other yummy uses for it.)

A great version of Muhammara, fully the equal of what I've had in Middle Eastern restaurants, and fantastic with roti or other flat breads. I first made it as written, but with one tablespoon of oil, and it's definitely much healthier and fresher tasting. I've also experiemented with substitutions for the red pepper flakes, and found a combination of Spanish pimenton, chipotle and harissa to be a real winner. And roast your own peppers for the best taste.

This is a delicious dip for just about anything. Roasting your own peppers and reducing the olive oil is the key.

I made this recipe for a potluck. Everyone raved about it and I personally could not get enough of it. Since I brought it to share with everyone else, I needed to refrain from eating the whole thing, which probably saved me from gaining a couple of pounds. I would monitor the amount oil used. Just use enough to get your desired consistency and I would probably cut back on the pepper flakes. It was a touch too hot. Otherwise, it was absolutely incredible.

We roasted peppers we grew ourselves and followed others advise by cutting the oil back to 1/2 cup. We used a greek extra-virgin olive oil here as I feel the flavor is more authentic. The acid test was to make this recipe for my Iranian neighbors. They loved it and asked for the recipe!

Wow! This is a terrifically flavourful dip. We were tempted to use regular molasses, but pomegranate molasses are very different - they are a key ingredient, and were surprisingly easy to find. The 7 oz jar of peppers works out to about 2 whole roasted peppers. I also used only about 1/4 c oil and thinned the dip slightly with 2 Tbsp additional water. A real keeper!

I've made this a few times now for parties and it is always a big hit! I too cut way down on the oil - 2-3 tablespoons at most. I wonder if there's an error in the recipe. I can't imagine it with 3/4 cup! You wouldn't taste anything else!

I just returned from a trip to the Middle East and this recipe makes a spread as good as any I had there. I made it for a party and it was the favorite of nearly everyone there. Make sure you keep the charred skin of the peppers.. it adds the right smokiness.
