Followed to the letter and was very pleased with the result. Looked as good as it tasted too. I will definitely make this again!

4 Forks ! My Husband & I both liked these very much, I do agree with the other reviewers that say more garlic is needed! I know it sounds strange that one whole head isn't enough but roasting the garlic really mellows it and it's not overpowering in the least. Next time I would use two whole heads of roasted garlic. Make sure you use enough salt & pepper. My only complaint is that the cheese 'on top' melted all down the sides and on to the cookie sheet. The cheese on the cookie sheet crisped up nicely though & tasted great. I put chili pepper flakes on mine for some added heat. Hubby at his 'as is'. Nice that this can be made ahead of time. This is a keeper.

This is a good recipe which allows for a lot of experimentation. My 13 yr. old daughter had two friends stay for dinner at the last minute; I made these and added chopped sauteed mushrooms and onions, put in some tarragon, and used Monterey Jack that I had on hand. They all loved them. If I was not the only carnivore in my family, I'd definitely be adding some crumbled bacon!

THE POTatOES WERE SO HaRD TO COME OFF FROM THE PEEL. I ENDED UP CHOPPING THEM AND MIXING THEM aLLTOGETHER TO GET BaKED. YOU NEED MUCH MORE TIME THAN REQUIRED ON THE RECIPE

Made these the other night.... WOW! My suggestion though is to put all of the ingredients into a mixer. Let the cheese, garlic, potatoes, and sour cream really combine together to make like a paste of sorts... Unbelievable taste... Roasting the garlic is the key here... Enjoy!

Very good and very easy. Great to make ahead of time for a dinner party. Added a couple dashes of hot sauce to the mix to add some heat and it turned out fine.

Yum. I only rated this 3 forks because I really didn't follow the recipie exactly. I roasted baby red potatoes, cut them in 1/2 and then made the filling with Danish bleu cheese. I put the filling through a food ricer so the middle was an elegant, soft and smooth burst of creamy bleu cheese and potatoe. I didn't have one piece left over with rave reviews from my guests. Soo good and elegant. My family would love the recipie as written too.

These were perhaps the very best stuffed spuds ever. I served a crowd of 12 and not a skin was left! I prepared them the night before and then let them sit out for about an hour before cooking for about 20 min. before serving. Absolutely fantastic!

Delicioso! I had three medium russet potatoes on hand and so added slightly less of all ingredients except the garlic. I still used one clove although I think 1 1/2 to 2 cloves would have been even better. Used Tillamook Sharp Cheddar and the results were great. It went beyond comfort food - the roasted garlic lifts the spirits and sharpens the senses! We had these with rotisserie chicken and broccoli. Will make again and again!

Yummy recipe. I thought a large potato would be too much for one person, but everyone ate their entire serving! I made these earlier in the day, refrigerated them and reheated them as the roast was resting. Do use all the garlic. This recipe is a keeper.

I LOVE these potatoes. I used a Tillamook vintage white medium chedder and it was fantastic. I made five potatoes and my husband was begging for more.

Great recipe. The roasted garlic is key. I've made these several times and each time my teenage sons ask me to please "make more next time"!

We have NEVER tasted such great potatoes! We served these for Easter Dinner and they were a big hit. I misread the recipe and whipped them in the food processor and they were great, but some of them did not hold their shape when being baked, so next time I will try them just mashed a bit. But I also think my boo-boo has inspired me to make what will be, without a doubt, the best mashed potatoes I will ever have... the world of roasted garlic has been opened. We made a few extra potatoes and instead of baking them all for the second time (to eat right away), we froze a few that were at the "halfway point" and had them later in the week... and they were still great. I think I will have to make a big batch and freeze them individually so that we can have them whenever we want... they were sooooo good!

I added chives and crumbled bacon and got rave reviews. I agree with those who said it could have used more garlic. I wonder if the mixed reviews depend on the size of the potatoes being used. I would think the potatoes would have to be pretty small for the amount of cheese called for to be too cheesy.

I made this recipe for 30 at a gourmet potluck and got rave reviews. I added about 50% more garlic, some cooked/crumbled bacon, and finely chopped green onions. Also used some white cheddar with the yellow. Previous trials on this included chopped roemary (not good!) and fresh horseradish (not as good as you'd think!)

The start of this dish was good, but I could do without so much Cheddar cheese!! Next time I will lessen the amount to cheese.

Really Really Good! Rave reviews from all of my friends!

Very nice, very simple dish. Does need more garlic and maybe some different cheeses next time.

These were delicious! The only change I made was to use baby red potatoes and bake them as per the recipe for mini stuffed potatoes (on this site). The smaller potatoes only take 25 minutes to bake. We had them as a side dish, but they would also be a great appetizer. We almost had to flip a coin over the last one!

What a great comfort meal! Smooth creamy and carby - yum!

Very easy, very tasty comfort food. Easy to lighten up if desired. Serve with soup or salad for a light meal or with Giant Slab of Red Meat for an American midwestern classic.

I made this for my 2 1/2 yr nephew and he absolutely loved it and asked for more. It was also a hit with the adults at the table too. I will absolutely making it again.

Outstanding! I followed the advice of the other cooks and put in more roasted garlic and it was "to die for"! My husband loved it, too!

Easy, delicious and rich. Love the garlic. I also used light sour cream. Incidently, for a really good baked potato, try roasting at 475 degrees. Crusty outside and creamy inside, I think it makes a real difference.

Yummy yummy in my tummy. This is what its all about people. LOTS of garlic and potatoes. I love both and the combination really worked well this time. Not at all elaborate to prepare, which is a relief.

Although I adore garlic, it seemed too much in this recipe. I could have done without it completely. Other than this, the potatoes were very good.

I liked this recipe because it had great flavor, it was easy, and it is prep ahead - bake later. A good twice baked potato.

Made these as part of an indulgent birthday dinner (although did use light sour cream) and they were wonderful. Very easy.
