Great flavor. I have made these twice now, once with a flat waffle maker and the most recently with a belgian waffle maker. Much better and crispier as a belgian waffle.

waffles wee delish!! can't wait to try the caramel coulis....

the caramel coulis takes longer than 10 minutes. give it 15 or so and watch it carefully towards the end. the smell is absolutely wonderful. it has become my default recipe for anything that might possibly taste better with a little caramel.

Great waffles, very rich and buttery, very crispy but eat them quickly as they become mushy after a while. I haven't tried the caramel coulis but plan to in the future for a dessert course. This recipe would be great too with sub coconut oil for butter...yum-a-roonie! try it, you won't be disappointed.

I have only made the waffles (can't wait to make the caramel coulis!) and they are great. I have 3 children who love waffles, and I had made quite a few recipes with dissapointing results. I have now made this recipe 3 times - the search is over! I add a splash of vanilla.

Did not make the coulis, but the waffles were delicious! This is one of the best waffle recipes I have come across.

This was excellent (though basically a really good butterscotch recipe)! I brought it to a friendly waffle-topping competition, and it got excellent reviews, though got beat out by a savory (kimchee!) recipe. The waffle topping also included whipped cream, a drizzle of cognac and some bananas. Very easy, and fun to make. Cool to make with kids around, who can do some of the stirring, and the transformation when you add milk is pretty exciting. I'm freezing the leftovers (made a double batch) in an ice cube tray.

I love this recipe! The waffles are crispy and delicious. This caramel sauce is legendary around here. I make this regularly using whole wheat flour and with the addition of flax seeds for extra nutrition. Today I replaced 1/4 cup of milk with frozen blueberries and it was great.

I only made the sauce. Fabulous! Served warm over Butterfingers Ice Cream.

I made these as a breakfast waffle and they are great! Nice and fluffy light. I did not make the caramel sauce since it was breakfast, I used maple syrup, but they are great no matter what you put on them. I will make again.

Crispy & flavorful. My new base waffle recipe. I added a little vanilla & sprinkled with chopped pecans before baking.

I just used this recipe to make the waffles. They were great!

Yum yum. I substituted soy milk for the whole milk in the waffles and it was delicious. This was the first time I made caramel from scratch and it was surprisingly easy. So if you love caramel and waffles, this recipe will put a smile on your face. Enjoy!

Was looking for a alternative recipe for Belgium waffle without the wait to let it rise. So I tried this one. It was very quick and easy (and certainly not very healthy with all that butter....moderation, moderation, moderation)and was a great result.

This was very good and an unusual dessert. I thought once you added butter, caramel became butterscotch, but perhaps butterscotch is a variety of caramel? No matter, this was really good. I skipped the whipped cream though and wish I hadn't.

Incredibly yummy. A drop of vanilla in the batter, maybe even a few chopped pecans, and some sliced strawberries makes it heaven.

Amazing. Super tasty. The caramel came out creamy and perfect. An excellent and different dessert. Will make again for a dinner party.

All I heard was the click click of the fork hitting the plate. A must to have the dollop of whipping cream. Great bistro dessert.

Very nice, indeed. Never fully appreciated how bad caramel is for you (sugar, fat, salt)...would definitely make this again!
