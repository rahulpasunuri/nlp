Very time consuming, and I'm not sure it was worth all the work. The parmesan broth was delicious - the leek flavor came through more than I expected - and the risotto was nice. Granted, I didn't use the truffle since I (gasp) don't like truffle, but overall I think I was expecting something out of this world based on other reviews and it was just good risotto.

Absolutely amazing. I dream about this dish and must make it again very soon.

this is incredible. not difficult, but bit time consuming. The results did not disappoint. even hubby, who's a risotto hater, liked this one.the only changes: I double the garlic, and used tempranillo for wine. I used red wine vinegar at the end, and it was perfect.

I was concerned that this would come out too rich/excessively complicated, so I did it a little differently. I made up the Parmesan broth but didn't reduce it as much, and then I cooked the risotto in it. Came out great.

This recipe may look like it takes some work. And it does a bit. But absolutely one of the best things I've ever eaten and I eat well. I made a compound butter with white truffle oil and it worked fine. I think when you get to heaven the first thing you're offered to drink is a warm mug of that parmesan broth.

I really wanted to give this 4 forks, but it was just too overpowering in flavor. I followed the recipe only making two substitutions as other reviewers have done (5 oz regular butter and 1 oz truffle oil for the truffle butter, and balsamic vinegar for the verjus). The parmesan broth made the entire house smell like an italian restaurant, but I will be finding another use for it in the future. I tasted the risotto with and without the parmesan broth, and while the broth is divine, combined with the risotto I think it overpowers the other flavors. I would make this again, but leave out either the balsamic, truffle oil, or parm broth. Maybe it is more subtle with the verjus. I would also suggest cutting back on the amount of butter added at the end, half as much would do just fine. That said, the texture of the risotto was creamy and perfect, the red wine gave a beautiful color, and it smells heavenly. Just a little over-the-top for my palate!

Oh my heavens...this is by far the most sumptuous risotto I have ever made! I thought my guests were going to faint. Served eight perfectly for a first course, although everyone was begging for more. DO NOT skip the parmesan broth. It is time consuming, expensive, and a bit of a pain, but your house will smell wonderful and your risotto won't be the same without it. I have made many risotto recipes and had never served an accompanying broth. I was also surprised that the recipe didn't call for cheese. Don't add it, the recipe simply doesn't need it. I could not find truffle butter so I bought truffle oil and added 1 ounce of truffle oil to 5 ounces of butter and stirred in at the end. I will make this dish over and over again. FANTASTIC!!!

This recipe was fantastic. I made it last night for our "Dinner Club" to rave reviews. I followed the recipe closely (using the butter/truffle oil suggestion) and red verjus. I would make it again if I found an easy place to get parmesan cheese rinds(A friend saved hers in the freezer for me throughout the year). This broth is so good and should not be skipped. I made the broth the night before and did the prep works in stages. It was pretty easy at the end to put it all together. Well worth the effort and expense!

What to say...This was so expensive ($10 for cheese rinds, $12 for truffle butter, the wine)and was simply not that good in the end. It was ok, not spectacular. For the effort and cost, I would not choose this recipe again.

This was exquisite! I made the parmesan broth a couple of days in advance, and did not find the remaining preparation particularly time- consuming or difficult. I used carnaroli rice; I omitted the tomato paste; I could not find verjus, so substituted Balsamic vingar; I used an Oregion pinot noir (a rather pricey ingredient!); I balked at buying a pound of truffle butter for $20, but my wonderful cheese lady, who provided me with parmesan rinds, sold me a small soft gourmet cheese packaged with a chunk of truffle - I minced the truffle and mixed it with softened unsalted butter. To accompnay the risotto I made meatballs from ground elk (my son is a hunter) with fresh sage, cream and bourbon.The dish was fabulous! Next time I will try a less expensive wine, perhaps a Vacqueyras or Gigondas, or even a Spanish Grenache I am fond of. This is way too good to make just once!

impress your friends & family with this one! I rarely (never) write reviews, but this is a show stopper and great for Vegeterians. Made for Christmas Eve with veggie broth and the truffle oil/butter combo discussed by others (no truffle butter in sight). The broth is awesome and definitely worth the effort. I have leftovers that I will definitely be using up. I topped the dish with perfectly fresh (flown in from local market) and crispy sea bass to rave reviews. It is very rich, so not much else is needed for the meal.

Absolutely outstanding! The parmesan broth is not all that time consuming, and is very forgiving to substitution and error. A previous reviewer's idea of putting a pan-seared scallop on top made the recipe into an entree, but it's perfect even without!

This is an amazing recipe. I have several risottos in my repertoire, but I have always wanted to try this variation. It makes for a nice rustic, but elegant side dish. I am so glad that this was my first recipe (and now my last). Although the parmesan broth is time consuming it is still very easy to make and worth it - DO NOT leave it out - just plan ahead (it can be made up to 2 days earlier). Although I just made this for me and my husband, I highly recommend making this for company - you will look like a gourmet. Like most people I made the truffle oil and red wine vinegar vaation and I would do it next time as well. Because I did not have beef broth in house, I actually used all chicken broth this time and it was still fantastic. I sereved it with a grilled veal chop and it made quite the impressive meal.

Had this at Cyrus a few weeks ago and can't believe I found it here. A dish to remember! The recipe is not clear about when to remove the packet of herbs so I improvised by simmering the aromatics, peppercorns, bay leaf in the combo chicken/beef broth then strained before reheating. This released the flavors which is what the whole point was in the first place. Subbed the truffle butter with regular unsalted and a good drizzle of truffle oil. Cyrus' parmesan broth did not have any red color or tomato taste so I will leave out the paste next time. The broth is excellent but time consuming. I would make it for a special dinner but just use fresh grated cheese for everyday since the risotto is a snap. The risotto is silky, rich and earthy. Excellent with a full-bodied Barolo.

Holy Smackers!! I absolutely agree with Sarasota and Texas--unbelievable dish! I made this for Valentine's as well (the risotto is appropriately colored too!!) I cut way back on the butter (the sheer volume requested was giving me anxiety attacks)and it was still amazing. Had trouble finding cheese "rinds" so had to cut back on that too. But, am happy to say,--no longer viewed as kitchen buffoon...

I made this for my husband on Valentines Day and it was beyond fabulous. The house smelled like a restaurant in Napa Valley. The parmesan broth was superb, I used a little less parmesan (about half) and it was still very flavorful. I used truffle oil with butter and the risotto was silky and had a great earthy flavor. I think my husband fell in love with me again after this meal.

I made this for Valentine's Dinner with the Sauteed Veal with Shrimp, Mushroom, and Brandy Cream Sauce. I will definitely make it again. Couldn't find truffle butter, so I used some truffle oil and learned that a little goes a long way. I used close to 2 T. and it was almost too much. As a result, the Parmesan Broth seemed to get lost and didn't seem worth the effort. I will try again with less oil because the broth smelled amazing by itself. This has been deemed a "guest worthy" recipe in my house!

This recipe was a complete failure for me! A gloppy, greasy, icky, foul-tasting mess. I will admit I'm not an experienced risotto maker, but I still can't imagine these ingredients ever coming together in a good way, after having tried. I am baffled by the others' reviews. I and my cooking partner reread the recipe several times in the aftermath, convinced we had grossly misinterpreted something. Soooo much butter at the end - how could it ever incorporate into the risotto? For me, it gathered in vast, expensive truffle-scented puddles in the pan. The best part of this dish was the closure I got after dumping it all in the trash and washing the dishes. Anyone got any advice for me? Truly, I'm baffled. I really wanted it to work out. Sounded so good. Sigh.

I can't say enough about this wonderful dish. I made this for a dinner with my husband's business partners and I don't think I've ever received more praise for a meal. I served this with a giant pan-seared scallop on top of the risotto. This is one to impress. YUMMMM!!!

This dish is absolutely AMAZING. the broth is key, as it has a wonderful, complex flavor (it takes a lot more time to concentrate down than recipe suggests, but the concentration is necessary for the flavor). I recommend making more than recipe calls for as your guests will ask for more. I used butter mixed with truffle oil which works fine.

I had the pleasure of having this dish at Cyrus while on a trip to Wine country in September. If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be this dish!!! I made it at home 2 nights ago and it was almost as good as what I remember from that wonderful night. It looks intimidating, but it is so worth it.
