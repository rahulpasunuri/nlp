I made this for Valentine's Day...while it was good, it wasn't great. The meringue actually took about a half hour longer to bake than the recipe said. The fudge sauce really didn't turn out to be anything special, and "making" your own mint ice cream isn't worth the effort. If I were to do it again, I'd make the meringue again, I'd use store-bought ice cream, and I'd skip the fudge sauce.

This has been my daughter's birthday "cake" every year since this recipe first came out. I try to make the meringue hearts fairly thin so they'll be easier to eat.

My family loved this dessert! It isn't nearly as hard as it looks. Great way to use left over egg whites. I would like to try different ice cream/sauce combinations. Peach and raspberry sounds good!
