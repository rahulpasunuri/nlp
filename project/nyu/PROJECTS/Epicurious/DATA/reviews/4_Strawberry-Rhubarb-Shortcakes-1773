This was good - just not great. Easy to make and most can be done ahead of time - which is nice when you're entertaining. I don't think I would make it again - too many other rhubarb recipes to try!

Amazing! Very easy and seasonal. I reduced the sugar by 2/3 and used white whole wheat flour for the biscuits. I've made this twice and everyone just loves it.

Phenomenal! Baked in less time though, mine only took about 15 minutes. The biscuit recipe was super easy to do in a food processor and they are so tender and flavorful. The orange zest is a must.

Ahhhhh... Heaven! I used frozen rhubarb and strawberries and it was still marvelous. Also did not have any orange peel around so just ignored that. Absolutely wonderful and the biscuits are really easy to make in a food processor.

This was my first shortcake ever, with grand results. Easy and very kid friendly.

This was amazing! Very simple and a really nice, unexpected twist for shortcake. The orange peel added just the right brightness to the compote--can't wait for more rhubarb to grow in so I can make it again.

where did the cook from Germantown find cardamom in this recipe? I think she's looking at the other recipe out of Gourmet. I would try the Gourmet recipe for the biscuits next time - mine spread, instead of rising, though they certainly tasted delicious.

The cardamom makes this a unique dessert. With rhubard out of season I served it with sliced strawberries and blueberries that had "marinated" in a few tablespoons of sugar and a pinch or two of orange rind - very good!

Spectacular dessert. Used one tablespoon orange rind as the other reviewer said that she would use more. That amount was perfect. Cut the shortcakes in half and put cream and strawberry-rhurbarb in bottom half, then the top half with more filling and then the cream. For sure I'll make it again.

Fabulous desert! I added a slurry of cornstarch and lemon juice to thicken the compote a bit. The biscuits are delicious - very buttery and flaky. However, I'd add a bit more orange rind next time. I served the shortcakes with ice cream and the sweetened whipped cream --- truly to die for!
