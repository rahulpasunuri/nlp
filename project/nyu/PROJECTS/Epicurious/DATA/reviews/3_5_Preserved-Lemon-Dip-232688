We really loved this. I made it as part of a vegan meal for the day after Thanksgiving (a concession to my son) and everyone thought it was great. My husband really liked it with hummus.

This was quite yummy, but didn't look like the picture, I used a whisk to combine the oils into the herb & lemon mixture and I ended up with a much creamier dip. Still good.
