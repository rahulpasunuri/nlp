First time I have reviewed before actually trying the dish but good grief. It is way too complicated for what it is, and by just reading it, I can tell that the other reviewers are correct. Too complicated for a dish that could be made much simpler and with far better results. I would never even think of trying to prepare this dish. Get some fresh porcinis and saute them with the chicken, put it all in a paella pan and bake. Much easier - much better.

TWO ounces of dried porcini? Are you kidding?

Made this dish as written, except for the dill, which did not appeal to me. The dish is ok, but somewhat labor intensive as it uses a lot of pots/bowls i.e. 2 per component x 3 components, so I won't be making again

This requires a lot of coordination for a so-so dish. I did like the grains better than the chicken, but I think the whole dish is blah. It needs more intense flavors (the dill doesn't cut it). The grains would be a good vegetarian entree, but I know I won't make the porcini chicken again.

The chicken was so, so. The porcini 'crust" was not enhancing and was costly. The wheat berry and wild rice combo was a great accompaniment. Keep the grains and use with another chicken dish.
