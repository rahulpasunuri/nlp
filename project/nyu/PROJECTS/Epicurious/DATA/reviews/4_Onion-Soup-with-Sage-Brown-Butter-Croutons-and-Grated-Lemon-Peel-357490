I agree that the lemon peel is completely unnecessary. It just doesn't give enough flavor to be worth adding. I also substituted veg. broth for chicken, and served the soup in bread bowls. I passed on the croutons, and instead used the leftover sage butter for dipping the top of the bread bowls into! you'll probably end up sautéing for closer to an hour. Also.. I didn't purée all of the soup because I like the oniony texture. this is actually a pretty basic recipe for onion soup, but the sage/butter really adds a lot!

Wow, this recipe is 10 forks. I made this recipe due to the wonderful reviews and it did not disappoint! I pretty much made this as specified. I had fresh red onions so my soup was made out of red onions. Also I wasn't sure what crustless country style bread was--I ended up using a French baguette with crusts and the crusts actually gave a good crunch. My only mistake was that I halved the recipe. It was so good that I wished I'd made the complete quantity. Enjoy a great dish!

This soup is amazing! The onions took longer to cook than the recipe specified, but the wait was well worth it. The unique blend of flavors from the various topings makes this a unique and delicious onion soup.

WOW indeed. I created an account just so I could praise this incredible recipe. The end result is absolutely outstanding, one of the best I have tried on this site. It's a bit more work than I had anticipated but worth it. Each of the accessories adds to the exquisite yet subtle combination of flavors. I'll be fixing this for company. Bravo!!

Wow. This recipe is harder to make than it looks, but the results are well worth it. There's a lot of careful stirring, and a lot of waiting. They don't specify what kinds of onions to use; I used half yellow onions, and half shallots. Instead of chicken broth, I substituted vegetable stock that I made from scratch, with a really earthy, deep flavor. The fried sage leaves on top are a nice touch and provide textural contrast. The grated lemon peel is really an afterthought; you don't need it. The sherry vinegar provides acidity, and a nice complexity.

A good recipe. Only minus is when frying the sage, the sage has lots of moisture. butter tends to splatter.

The only minus to this recipe is that it sage is full of moisture and it tends to splatter the oil when cooking.
