There is no way that six chicken breast halves are 1.5 pounds. Six chicken breast halves are closer to three pounds.

This was very good served with a dipping sauce with soy sauce, white vinegar, brown sugar, hot pepper flakes, minced ginger and garlic, and a dash of Texas Pete!

I was impressed by how well the sesame crust held together, but by itself this chicken is bland. I made a dipping sauce of soy sauce, sake, ginger and garlic which went perfectly with it.

It was okay but nothing special really. I expected more from this recipe.

As another reviewer has said, this dish goes from okay to yummy with the addition of some flavorful sauces on the side. My husband made a honey-hot mustard sauce to go with it and that made the dish more special. Paired it with the sesame cold noodles which were defiitely the star of the show!

Loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and even included the suggested side of cold sesame noodles. The whole family loved it; will definitely make again.

I had this at a chinese restaurant in Chinatown and LOVED it. I was looking for a recipie for it but just kept getting the chinese-american sesame chicken recipie which is drowned in all that sauce and oil-YUCK! The sesame seeds don't retain as much oil as a flour or other breading-type coating and since the sesame gives the chicken a neutral flavor the chicken lends itself to many different dishes.

I made this dish for the first time tonight. I would not call the dish bland, but rather light and slightly neutral. I saw that as an oppurtunity for a variety of sauce options. Tonight I made a raspberry, ginger and fig sauce that was simply the perfect flavor to balance and compliment the sesame. It was not complex by any means. About 3 tbsp. of both raspberrry and fig jam, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, dash of chili oil and lemon juice reduced until starting to thicken. I served the chicken atop the sauce and very finely sliced nori. Yum!

I agree with the previous reviews re blandness, so I added Japanese Furikake seasoning to the sesame seeds as well as sea salt, a touch of powdered ginger and freshly ground pepper. I also used a drop of sesame oil in the pan. I added the leftovers to a salad the next day for lunch--which I thought was even better than the original. My kids loved it and it was a nice variation on chicken fingers for them.

thanks to previous reviewers, i was on blandness alert, and therefor marinated the chicken breasts for 5 hours prior to adding sesame crust. this step adds tons of flavor, and you do not need egg whites, the marinade helps the sesame to stay put. my marinade: 2tbsp light miso paste, 1- 2 garlic cloves finely grated, i tsp-tbsp fresh ginger finely grated, 2tbsp lime juice, 1 tsp honey and 2tbsp toasted sesame oil. i also mixed black sesame seeds with regular ones. i personally broil the chicken breasts until crust is browning(both sides), then reduce oven temp to 300F and let them finish cooking at low temp.

This recipe is especially awesome with black sesame seeds.

Here's a good dipping sauce (proportions of ingredients I will leave to your discretion): sriracha or some sort of asian hot pepper and garlic sauce; lime juice; fish sauce (easy on this); toasted sesame oil; sugar (a pinch).

This is so easy, and looks very "chef-like". Works great on an asian salad in the summer!

This chicken is kinda bland. I agree with the other cooks that there must be a dipping sauce of some kind. I served this with some stirfried veggies. Would probably make this again for a mid-week dinner.

A little bland, but could be delicious if spiced up a bit.

I mixed black sesame seeds with the white and it turned out just beautiful! You definetely will need some kind of dipping sauce to accompany this dish but overall wonderful recipe

Wow - I was surprised at the negative response to this recipe. This is a favorite at our house. The sesame seeds have such a lovely, delicate flavor and the crunch is out of this world. It's a regular treat at our house where where my pre-schooler loves anything Asian-inspired. I've even made it for munchies when we have company - slicing the chicken into thin strips and frying them individually, and serving it with dipping sauces. No, the flavor isn't overwhelming, but some people like sesame while others do not. We particularly like it here. Serve it with broccoli sauteed with some soy sauce and garlic (or snow peas, scallions, grape tomatoes, and soy sauce... YUM) and mixed brown rice or lo-mein noodles and you're good to go! I'm off to make this for dinner right now! Enjoy.

I made the recipe using a mixture of sesame and olive oil. I dredged some small pieces of chicken in Furikake which is a mixture of black and white sesame seeds and bits of nori (seaweed). Those pieces were more flavorful and interesting to us than the chicken dipped only in sesame seeds. Also, I found I needed to dip the chicken into some soy sauce for a little extra flavor - though I didn't follow the directions perfectly regarding salt. The chicken turns out nice and juicy as long as you pound the chicken to a even thickness and watch it to make sure to not overcook. Also - beware of spattering. All in all, a tasty and very quick meal.

Awful! Dry + tasteless. The clean up is no fun either.

This wasn't a horrible dish, would have liked more sesame flavor, so I think I'll use some toasted sesame oil next time. I paired it with brown rice and a wakame salad, which added some nice flavor. Also, made a shoyu ponzu sauce to go with it

Sesame crusted chicken is an excellent platform for using a sweet and spicy asian style sauce, and asian chicken salad or even a new twist on teriyaki!. I altered the recipe to include japaneese bread crumbs. I feel it is imperative to pound and season the chicken. I Sliced it thin and fanned it over a bed of greens with a dressing or over rice with bok choy or another stirfried veggie with the aforementioned sauce. Woooohoooo! I couldnt stand seeing this recipe getting such bad press. Cooking is freedom have fun!

I actually like this dish-it is plain and simple, but if you like sesame, it's great. Try it with some Ponzu sauce as a dip. Yum.

I absolutely hated this dish - inedible! However, my two children actually liked it. They're not that young but evidently are still attracted to "cute-looking" food. I'm sure this dish can be saved somewhat by seasoning/marinating the chicken but still......DO NOT serve to adult friends.

Dry and tasteless as is. I cooked the first 3 breast halves and the kids didn't like them. For the 2nd 3 breast halves I cooked them in sesame oil with garlic and the juice of one lemon. A little better, but nothing I would bother with again.

I would have given this 2.5 forks if I could. I liked it, and it made a good weekday meal. I cooked it in olive oil, which gave it a little more flavor. I served it with the coriander noodles with zucchini and carrots, and it made a nice meal.

A couple teaspoons of lime juice, a bit of freshly grated ginger root, and a teaspoon of minced garlic, and this was a wonderful dish!

I added Italian breadcrumbs to the sesame seeds. Just enough to add flavor. The kids loved it!

Think I will try substituting sesame oil for part of the oil. Linda

Other than being easy and quick to prepare, this was a flavourless recipe. That said, I didn't have the full amount of sesame required.
