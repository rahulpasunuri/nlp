Wonderful full-flavored soup and certainly worth the calories of the heavy cream. Yes, the recipe calls for 8 cups of cream for an 8 person serving. I halved it for a smaller crowd. The smoked fish (I used a whitefish fillet found at Whole Foods Market) gave it a wonderful salty, meaty flavor. Would definitely make again.

We made this recipe for my cooking club. We had to use smoked mackeral because we couldn't find smoked haddock. The general consensus was that is was a little too fishy. And, it certainly wasn't worth the calories that the heavy cream gave it!

I use a double boiler to heat milk product long enough to absorb the bouquet garni called for (i.e., herbs wrapped in cheesecloth) to avoid curdling/burning. Have not tried evaporated milk but do regularly use a combination of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and regular 1/2 and 1/2 (50% each). I think I'm also going to add toasted herbed croutons on top and drizzle with a touch of white truffle oil.

Well, first off, my measuring cup says a pint is 2 cups, so I'm thinking the recipe is calling for 4 cups of cream. But my mother in law has always used evaporated milk,and I would probably use 2 cans of that. But for me, it would be the last thing I put in, and leave the heat on long enough to heat the milk through. I've followed directions similar to this before, and the milk has curdled, ruining the meal. Just a though.

I could not find a place to comment, so I used the review system: As I understand it, 2 quarts = 8 cups, that seems like a lot of cream. Any suggestions on how to replace it by something more healthy?
