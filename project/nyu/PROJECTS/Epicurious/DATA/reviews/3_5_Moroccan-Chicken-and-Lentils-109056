This is a delicious recipe. I have made it a couple of times in the past, this time I modified it just a bit: 1. Cooked onions, removed from pan. 2. Cooked chicken in batches - chicken tenders worked very well, set aside. 3. Mixed onions with spices in the pan, cooked about 30 seconds, added a splash of white wine and chicken broth, then put the chicken back in, cooked until done (a few minutes) 4. Used 1/4 c vinegar, 1/2 cup oil for the sauce, and it was plenty (used full amounts of spices). Mixed about 2/3 of the sauce with the lentils, poured the rest over the cooked chicken on top of the lentils. Did not bother with the parsley. Delicious. Everyone loved it, even teenager who is generally hard to please.

Great - fast - weeknight dinner. I do half a recipe for 3 of us to make a one-dish meal. I also reserve at least a third of the vinaigrette and dress 12-16 oz of mixed salad greens with it. Then to serve, layer a large platter with greens, then lentils, then chicken (with just a touch of vinaigrette drizzled over), then parsley.

Loved the flavors in this recipe but agreed that the dressing was way too heavy. I used only a quarter of it with the lentils and sautéed mushrooms and asparagus instead of chicken for a vegetarian option. A very versatile dish that I will certainly make again.

Really easy. This made a huge quantity of dressing, however...we only used half of it and felt that the 500g of lentils we cooked (over a pound) had plenty of dressing. I've got the rest of it in a jar in the fridge and am pondering what it might be good for...roasted sweet potatoes perhaps...

TWO thumbs down from a returned Peace Corps Volunteer to Morocco (four years). Moroccan cuisine is tasty; this dish was actually disgusting. I made it because I love lentils and was intrigued by the adjective Moroccan. I knew while I was preparing the chicken I had made a mistake. Shame on me!

Delicious combination of flavors and textures. As advised by others, I reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup, used about 2/3 cup olive oil. Kept the lentils warm, mixed with 3/4 of the dressing, and then finished cooking the chicken with the rest of the dressing. I added 1 tsp of ground cardoman to the chicken seasonings, as suggested by another cook here. Cooking onions on high temp creates the most delicious aromas! The chicken was well-seasoned and tender; the lentils were delicious. Wonderful meal, fairly simple to put together. I will definitely make again.

I made it exactly as the recipe specified, but, it didn't really taste very good.

1/2 C. oil is more than enough. Used 1/4 C. vinegar and kept remaining ingredients the same for the dressing. I soaked the lentils for 20 min or so (promotes more even cooking, less mushiness) before cooking them, tossed a few bay leaves into the water to cook with them then added about a 1/4 C. of golden raisins when I tossed the warm lentils w/ the dressing. I wanted to grill the chicken instead so I rubbed the spices on it (using 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a pinch of allspice) and let it sit for a bit before grilling then cut the cooked chicken into pretty slices. I skipped the parsley but topped lentils with crumbled feta and some toasted walnuts for additional crunch. My family loved it (I'm always happy to get them to eat lentils!), it was easy and it was relatively healthful; I'll definitely make this again and again.

Weeknight favorite at our house. We round up on the spices, and mix the parsley in with the lentils (to make a sort of salad). I only use 1/2 c olive oil IF that.

I have made this several times, all to acclaim! It is easy, nutritious and delicious. Our African friends say this recipe reminds them of home.

This was FANTASTIC. Only change I made was that I added some ground coriander to the chicken, added a bit of wine to the pan, and a little bit of sri racha for garlicky bite. MAN was this good. Hubby couldn't stop raving about it. Served it with a saffron couscous. Even my 15 month old couldn't stop eating it. YUM!

I also agree this was a bit too much vinegar. I will just you less next time, but overall this was a fantastic recipe that I will use again and again. I topped it with crumbled Feta cheese and it was delicious.

I simplified this recipe a bit... used a Moroccan spice blend rather than the suggested combination. Also, I grilled the chicken separately, as I was making several recipes at once. Mixed lentils, dressing, cooked onions, and grilled chicken together as final step and it was wonderful. The lentils really shine, and the spice blend was just perfect. It was a bit heavy on the vinegar side, but admittedly I didn't measure carefully. Highly recommend, and will make again!

This dish is fabulous we could stop eating it. Even the leftovers when before anything else

Love this stuff. I reduce the amount of dressing (3/4 cup oil, 1/3 cup vinegar), and reserve a tablespoon or so to add to the chicken and onions as they cook. For a bit of kick, I usually add a bit of cayenne. Next time will replace some of the chili powder with chipotle chili powder.

I was disappointed with the chicken. I followed the recipe but something was just off.

Great recipe. Be careful if you are using any chicken that's bone-in and adjust cooking time acordingly. I also added a some of the dried onions and little garlic to the lentils (which I served hot) and some cardamom too. I skipped the parsley as it looked to be more for show than flavor. Overall easy and smells great when you're cooking it.

I've had this recipe in my file for quite a while but only made it last night for the first time. Delish. I followed suggestions and cut the dressing in half. I also did not make all the lentils since we are only two. As it was, we still have a lot of leftovers. I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I did half-and-half white vinegar and balsamic. Hubby loved it.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe, even though it uses so many of my favorite ingredients. Too much vinegar made it taste a bit sour. Would not make again.

This is a wonderful summer dish when you don't want to heat up your house with the oven! I enjoy eating it warm the first day and then cold out of the fridge for leftovers! It's even yummy over lettuce for a quick, healthy salad! I cook the lentils in chicken stock and, like a previous reviewer, saute a purple onion and two shaved carrots and add them to the bowl of cooked lentils. Also, I only make half the amount of dressing and then only pour enough to wet the lentils (about half) and chicken. I save the leftover dressing in case someone from my family wants more.

Very tasty. My husband loved it. I halved the lentils so it wouldn't be so much. used chick thighs and drumsticks since that's what I had on hand. Ran out of lentils the second night because my husband had been snacking on them so I dumped in a can of chickpeas and tossed together before reheatng. Made an alright substitution.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. As others have suggested, I only used half the ingredients for the dressing and that was more than enough. I prepared this for my boyfriend and he thought it was good and hearty. I would definitely make this again.

very good, very easy, but is anyone else worried about "leave at room temperature for 2 hours?" I'm sure that goes against food safety guidelines... In any case, the dish is excellent - I added spinach as another reviewer suggested (be sure to squeeze out all the liquid!) and halved the dressing. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Like most of the other reviewers, I halved the oil and vinegar in the dressing for the lentils and it came out perfectly. By the way, this made more lentils than we could possibly have hoped to eat with the chicken. Luckily, they'll be good as a leftovers. I also took the suggestion of adding a handful of dried apricots with the chicken and I thought it was great! I'd definitely make this again..great flavors and very satisfying.

Rating: 3
This is a great weeknight meal. I followed reviewer suggestions and only used half the dressing, which worked well. I also deglazed the pan with broth to get those good flavors. I served it warm as an entree with rice. Next time I will add either apricots (as suggested by reviewers) or golden raisins--I think the sweetness would be perfect in this.

Delicious! I actually ran out of olive oil, so only used 1/2 cup for the dressing and 1/3 cup of vinegar and it was fine.

Anything that makes my husband and best friend rave the way this dish did is a keeper! I slightly modified the recipe by deglazing the meat with some chicken broth and plating with a handful of coursely chopped kalamata olives on top. For the lentils, I braised them in chicken broth with sauteed onion, red pepper, and shaved carrot. I did use the dressing after straining off the liquid. Delish!

I used Du Puy lentils, because I had them on hand, and they were delish! I used one cup lentils and followed the cooking directions on the lentil package. I cut the the dressing in half and it was just the right amount for one cup of the small, army green Du Puy lentils (which I purchased at Whole Foods). It was bursting with flavor and super quick and easy. My husband, who is not a fan of lentils, or any other dried legumes, commented that the dish was excellent.

Tasty and easy, this will become a quick week night staple. I cut way back on the chili powder to be sure my young son could eat this and he loved it. My spouse and I just used a bit of liquid hot sauce to spice it back up. I did NOT find the recipe to oily as a few have mentioned, but I would note that when you mix oil and vinegar you need to whisk and whisk and whisk to be sure the ingredients aren't merely mixed but emulsified. You'll know you whisked enough if the sauce thickens and doesn't separate again after sitting.

Rating: 3
This is a very simple and delicious recipe. The lentils took 40 minutes to cook instead of 20, and I think the recipe could use a bit more bite. Maybe some hot pepper? Also, I think that all the dressing is needed for the amount of lentils in the recipe. I'll definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
My husband and I loved this for a quick weeknight dish. Bright and full flavored. (I didn't even realize it was supposed to be a "salad.") Definitely scale back the vinaigrette, though. I also threw some greens into the chicken. Actually I think it might be better to grill the chicken next time or use a ridged grill pan -- better texture perhaps. Leftovers will be great in pita sandwiches.

Rating: 3
I loved this! I used less oil and less dressing as other reviews suggested, and ate it warm rather than cold. Some reviewers seemed to think this is not a complete main dish by itself, but I think it is. I was actually glad to find a main dish that doesn't require rice or pasta. I'll definitely make this again.

Really like this dish. To make it into a meal, I use about 2 lbs chicken breasts and a jumbo onion, and serve (Basmati) rice on the side. I also just lightly dress the lentils, then serve the rest of the dressing on the side to accommodate different tastes. Serves about 6 this way, very good with roasted tomatoes as the vegetable (or stuffed zucchini, but tomatoes are easier!).

To my taste, this could use more chicken and a little less dressing. But I did like it.

I found this dish to be excellent. Believe it or not I could not find lentils at the store so I served it over a bed of couscous with sauteed spinach. Even the kids loved it. Next time I might add just a little more cinnamon. Super easy and a great change.

Amazing, simply amazing hearty salad. Hits the spot. Satisfying but not overbearing. So flavorful and healthy, especially after I read the reviews that told me to reduce the oil. I am not one for sacrificing fat for flavor but since one cup did seem a bit much I tried half and it far from compromised the flavor. I did omit the cinnamon and it stayed true to a more Mexican flair. I loved it cold, loaded with parsley. I am going to make this all summer!

My husband LOVED this dish - a rarity. I liked it the first time and liked it more the next time. The flavors are unique and some people need time to get used to the unusual fragarance of the spices. A definte to do again and again.

We thought this was delicious--even my children. I followed the suggestions of others-1/2 the oil and 1/2 the vinegar but the same amount of spices. For the chicken, I added a clove a garlic and dried apricots (didn't think they added much). Didn't feed 12 at all; maybe 6 if it is the main course.

Rating: 3
I think the lentil/chicken dish is very rich, which is why it's supposed to serve 12. I served it at room temperature and spooned a conservative amount over hot brown rice. We loved it that way and I will definitely make it again, cooking the lentils with dried apricots as others have suggested, and having some plain yogurt on the side.

Easy and excellent. My partner and I are on the South Beach diet. This is a great Phase 2 Dish. As other before have written, cut the dressing in half. The lentils end up very "wet" otherwise, and who needs all that oil anyway?

This dish met with rave reviews from guests at two separate dinner parties. Definately cut the oil and vinegar in half (keep the proportions). I added more cinnamon, but kept the other spices the same. Prior to cooking the chicken, I added a little garlic. Serving the lentils warm was better than room temperature. These were the best lentils I've ever had in my life.

I followed the recommendations of many reviewers - less oil in the dressing, twice as much cumin and chili powder, i kept the 1/2 cup vinegar and added a 1/2 cup red wine, added 1/3 cup of chopped dried apricots when sauting the chicken, and doubled the amount of cinnamon. Lentils were served at room temp with the freshly sauted chicken on top. I thought it was DELICIOUS. I've never had such savory lentils!

This was easy, delicious and pretty. Quite a winning combination. My children liked it and my husband and I loved it. This will be a busy weeknight regular for us. I used some of the extra vinagrette on a side salad of bib lettuce.

This dish was very tasty. I especially liked the bed of lentils. As others have recommended, I halved the amount of olive oil for better results. I also added a good handful of finely chopped apricots to the lentils as they were cooking. I liked the addition of a little sweetness with the vinegar and spices - I would recommend this addition. I think that grilled salmon would be a nice substitute for the chicken. We will be making this dish again.

This was very good! I rarely cook lentils but they were fine with this (and healthy! and different!) The spices were just right, tho' I added more garlic because I always do. YES, CUT THE OIL IN HALF FOR THE DRESSING but I didn't change the other amts (of vinegar, etc.)It's also great that you can serve it at room temp instead of trying to get everything hot at the same moment. I can see this as a great summer meal too. It's less than 12 for sure but I just put a nice amount on a platter for two and sprinkled w/parsley--it was pretty and delicious with a Viognier. (I am convinced that good spices, from Penzey's really makes a difference in food--their cumin is the best, as is the cinnamon.)

I'll echo the comments from others that this recipe needs only about half the oil. While my family really liked the dish, the pool of excess liquid in the bottom of the platter told me I could cut that back.

I really didn't like the the lentils being served cold and ended up having to heat them up. I also agreed that the oil was over the top.

I think I'll just stick with cooking lentils in a soup. They didn't do it for me here.

"Morrocan" it is not; "dash" even less. Has possibilities if you add less vinegar, twice the chilli powder, more garlic, cilantro and a little mint instead of parsley. Definitely "kick it up a notch."

A recipe that doesn't take a lot of time but has a lot of flavor! Delicious. Made it twice! Used other reviewers' advice and made dressing with less oil, but still saute'd chicken in olive oil.

This was delicious. The lentils were great just by themselves, but the chicken added a nice touch. I'd run out of chili powder so I used a chili/garlic paste I had on hand. Ditto substituting fresh coriander for parseley. I'm going to send it to a bunch of friends.

As per reviews we cut the oil in half--good idea and thanks to all. The lentils were tasty--as lentils go, that is. I'm thinking the chicken should be rubbed with the final spice mixture--so, maybe it's less authentic this way--then sautéed, in a generously oiled pan. And did anyone get twelve servings from this?! Not even close. The dish is nicely aromatic and appears exotic on the plate; however, it's a disappointment for the palate.

Great recipe! Very nicely balanced spices, we enjoyed it tremendously... But we made it with only half a cup of olive oil in the dressing, though, and it still seemed overly oily for our taste...Would use even less next time..
