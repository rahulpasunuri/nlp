Like many cooks, I changed the ingredients up a little...Used White Onion, All Heavy Cream, 6 oz Gruyere Cheese, Used Rosemary for Spice--Amazing. Can't say I liked this recipe but can say I liked the basic ingredients that I built off of.....

What a waste of cream and goat cheese! For all the delicious sin I watched go into this recipe, it came out flat and boring, nothing like a nice cheesy, sinful scalloped potatoes should be. There is no reason to make this recipe. Ever.

Fun recipe! I made lots of changes though. My goal was to use the last of my storage crop potatoes (they were red with white center that may have been new potatoes?). I didn't have any milk or cream or shallots, but never fear! I used garlic for shallots, and I used 1 cup of almond milk and 1 cup of local goat yogurt. I used just 6oz of lcoal goat chevre, and mixed everything as directed. I used very old potatoes and this is a good way to cook old potatoes. It really turned out well considering the experiment it was. I don't think anyone would have been able to tell I used alternative ingredients.

More like 3.5 forks. I have made this several times, following the recipe for the most part, and I always get rave reviews. Like some have said, it makes wonderful leftovers. My oven may cook a little on the hot side, but the recommended cooking time works fine for me.

I made this for Easter, halving the recipe as there weren't that many of us. It was really good, but I think next time I woud use even less potatos and the same amount of the cream and cheese mixture. I thought a little extra goat cheese would have helped also. I'll make it again, but it wasn't quite as good as I'd expected.

I just brought this for Easter Brunch, and apologized for it the rest of the day. The flavor was nice, but the potatoes were just swimming in the dish. Could I have sliced my potatoes too thin?

I took this to my in-laws' Easter dinner, and it went over very well with the Easter ham. I thought the goat cheese got a little lost, although my stepson liked the tanginess. (Trader Joe's sells an 8-oz. log for $3.49 -- best price around!) To eliminate steps from the preparation, I sauteed the shallots in a 3-qt Le Creuset casserole, then added the milk, cream and cheese to melt, then added the potatoes. No need to puree sauce separately. Also no need for fancy layering throughout, except for the top layer. I would have taken another reviewer's suggestion and added more chives (as well as S & P) in with the potatoes, rather than just on top, for color and flavor. The dish reheated very well the next day, and the sauce was not thin.

Outstanding dish- easily three forks, tempted to give it four. As another reviewer commented (citing it as their reason for not liking the recipe), the sauce is quite thin after baking, making the dish rather unappealing when it first comes out of the oven. However, it simply needs to rest a while before serving in order to re-absorb some of that liquid and become a bit more solidified (much like a lasagna or even a roasted bird) - 20 to 30 minutes later, it was infinitely better. Morever, the leftovers were as good or better than the initial serving, so next time, I wouldn't hesitate to bake this ahead of time and just rewarm before serving. Will definitely make again.

Handy to be able to make it ahead (I try to do most of Easter dinner the day before, as it's a big sit-down affair). This went together simply, and baked up nicely -- I left it in longer, re-covering it, to accommodate late guests, and it was fine. Made a recipe and a half for 10 people and had only a few leftovers -- which were yummy reheated.

This was just so, so. I used the food processor to slice the potatoes. Very quick and good results.

This was a wonderful deviation from the standard scalloped potatoes on Easter Sunday. Don't skip the fresh chives, it completes the flavor. I left in the oven without the cover alot longer and it made a nice golden crust.

I was pretty disappointed by this recipe. With all the goodies inside, as well as the reviews, I had expected great things. Instead, the sauce was thin and the flavor was just OK. I considered leaving it in the oven longer, but the top was nicely browned and the potatoes were fully cooked, so I figured it was done. I won't try it again.

Fantastic. The long, slow cooking & the tanginess of the goat cheese really add a lot. A new favorite!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and the results were outstanding. My whole family loved it.

Rating: 4
These were wonderful and I agree with the other reviewers that 55 minutes covered and 50 to 55 minutes uncovered created the best results.I also made this dish the day before (uncooked) and kept covered in the fridge and were perfectly fine and not at all discolored before baking. The potatoes were not the least bit runny/soupy and had great flavor and texture to them. I also added a bit more goat cheese and snipped chives on top before serving. The remainder (which wasn't much) was even better the following day. Everyone loved this dish and it is a definate keeper.

Did everything almost exactly -- halved the goat cheese and replaced with cheddar to make everyone in the house happy & had chives, not blossoms. Will most definitely make again.

This was a great dish although I did make numerous changes and additions. First off, I did not have shallots so I sauteed leeks in half the butter called for plus added garlic. It was so good that I did not blend it along with the other ingredients but added it directly on top of one of the potato layers. I also added some sauteed oyster mushrooms and chopped up roasted red peppers that I had in the fridge. On the other layer I added some roasted garlic. I substituted the whole milk with skim and the heavy cream with light cream (5%). I used half goat cheese and half light cream cheese (ran out of goat cheese). The dish turned out delicious. Oh by the way, 4 of us easily polished this off! My guests raved about it. I also didn't bother with the chives with all of the other good stuff I had in there. Enjoy!

Absoutely great! I made this for Easter and served it with a leg of lamb (hibiscus flower recipe that is also on this site)It was so tasty, but a little runny. I would cook it a little longer than it says.

I don't have success making this ahead of time. The potatoes turn dark. It's hard to completely cover all of them. My sauce is quite thick. Any suggestions? They are good though. I have cooked them early in the day and then finish them before serving. That works ok, I sometimes find them to be too soft and mushy

My family requests that I bring this dish for every holiday meal. Even people who say (think!) they don't like goat cheese love it. I sprinkle additional chopped chives on each layer - the more the better!

I made this for the first time on Easter Sunday. It was easy to prep and I have to say...it was a huge hit with my guests. The flavor is terrific ( I might add the roasted garlic suggested by a few others next time). I intend to make this an Easter tradition. It goes well with the traditional ham dinner.

Rating: 4
First, skip the chive blossoms. Second, I found that not even 55 minutes covered, 55 minutes uncovered fully cooked the dish (could just be my oven). Day over leftovers tasted even better! I'd really recommend making this a day ahead to give the potatoes a chance to soften a little and the flavors to meld. It tastes amazing, though.

Very good, the goat cheese adds a nice subtle flavour. I definitely agree with the longer cooking time. A real crowd pleaser.

These potatoes were DELICIOUS! I took another chef's advice and cooked them for 50 minutes instead of 40 so it was less soupy. Great the next day too!!

This dish was VERY GOOD. Different and Tasty! I added a garlic with the shallots and also reduced the potatoes to 2.5 lbs. I also didn't completely skin the potatoes, leaving part of the skin on. I cooked it 50 minutes covered and 50 minutes uncovered, came out nice and brown. I also added a little more goat cheese than the recipe called for. It was a very tasty and somewhat elegant dish. Easy and a keeper.

Wonderful recipe, easy to make and DELICIOUS! I made a couple of hours early and the dish dried a bit. Next time I will serve more quickly. This will be used time and time again!

Rating: 3
Excellent! The only thing that I would change is use only about 2.5 lbs. of potatoes and cook the dish for 55 minutes with foil and then 55 minutes without foil -- the liquid it better absorbed. Also, cooking it the day before ensures that the flavors have melded -- even better!!

I added an extra shallot and some fresh garlic--this is a must. Overall a nice variation from the usual scalloped potato. My boyfriend, a HUGE goat cheese fan LOVED this recipe.

Thanks, blah-blah-blah personal chef. Your review was utterly useless and so is your grammar. If you are the hot-shot chef that you proclaim to be, why wouldn't you state reasons for the poor review? Insulting other reviewers is not the way to persuade people to take stock in your opinion. Please refrain from posting on epicurious. As for the recipe, it is great and easy. It's been a hit with all of my diners and many took the recipe home. It's a good dish in a home-cooked yummy kind of way.

You have GOT to be kidding! I am a personal chef & after reading this recipe it sounded really good! NOT!!!!!!!!! I know how to cook really well, otherwise I would not be a personal chef. Either the people who rated this recipe who gave it 4 forks doesn't know any better, or does not know how to cook, but to be totally honest, I've had better in a box, & that is pathetic. If I could give this a minus 10 I would. Verrry disappointing!

This is wonderful. I didn't have chive blossoms so added Herbs de Provence. I made this for a pot luck buffet and it was a big hit. It's easy to put together and tastes just great.

Very yummy! I didn't have chive blossoms, so I sprinkled chopped, plain chive greens on top of the potatoes after baking, though I think they went unnoticed.

Just a note to A Cook in SFO - I haven't made this recipe, but from my cooking experience, I wouldn't hesitate to prepare this in advance - just be sure that the potatoes are well-covered with sauce, and they'll be fine. They would also stay fine if just sliced ahead of time and kept covered with water.

If you like goat cheese, this dish will be a hit. I left out the chive blossoms and added one tablespoon of herbes de provence and it was awesome!

This is a great recipe and great leftover. Real change of pace for a potato dish. A note to Kathy from Studio City - chives are easy to grow in a pot on your porch. Cut them back to soil level from time to time and give them the ocassional feeding of ORGANIC fertilizer - after all you are going to eat them! They will bloom and are a real nice trouble free herb. Even if they appear to die back in the winter, (do you have winter in Studio City?) they will emerge in spring!

Shallots, butter, cream, goat cheese....what's not to like! I added a bit more shallots, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was perfect with a Rack of Lamb, and the leftovers were delicious the next day. Other reviewers hit the nail on the head....great, luscious flavor without overpowering a classy meat course. This is a keeper!

Great potato recipe if you need something solid yet understated...this will please the "plain potato" lovers as well as the foodies who find potatoes hopelessly boring (me!), and it won't overpower the main dish. Looks impressive even without the chive blossoms. (Can anyone actually find those?)

This was a great side dish to a simple steak filet and a salad. I did add a garlic glove in with the shallots, as we love garlic so much. Very rich, deep flavor. Don't let the 3 rating fool you - I've never given a 4.

At first, I was drawn to this because I love goat cheese and I love dishes that can be assembled ahead of time. But then I made it and became enchanted w/this great potato dish because of its deep, rich flavor. I use a mandolin to slice the potatoes, and I wonder if the thin slices contribute to the airy, dreamy quality of the dish.

I made this recipe, but since I didn't have chives I used an extra shallot and some herbes de provence. It came out fantastic (though next time I'll add a little roasted garlic too). It's very easy to make and if you have a mandolin or similar slicer you can just slice the potatoes after the cheese mixture is processed - it only takes a minute. This recipe is much lighter than many for scalloped potatoes, and the goat cheese gives it a more sophisticated taste.
