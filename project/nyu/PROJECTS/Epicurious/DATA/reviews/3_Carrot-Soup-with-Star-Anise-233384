Really did not care for this recipe. Very blah, but an overpowering anise taste.

Tasty and easy. Added some ginger for complexity.

Very nice. The anise flavor was so pronounced that I decided not to sprinkle ground anise on top. Added a dash of cayenne to spice the soup up. Company loved it and asked for seconds.

The soup is amazing. I did not find it bland and the anise is delightfully present without being over powering. The secret to making non-bland soups is using the best boullion/stock (which is not Swanson as the commercials would like you to believe). I HIGHLY recommend "Better Than Boullion".

I love star anise--had plenty at home--and love carrot soup, but this was a one-dimensional soup. Not bad, but there's nothing more to it other than "oh, carrots; oh, anise." I'm glad I did a test run, since I was going to make it for company, but now I'll look for something else. Not bad, just not special.

I found this to be bland and just not impressive. Although very easy to make, just not worth the effort. No matter how I tried to spice it up, just didn't work.

This was okay, but didn't bowl me over. I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. I added some water at the end to thin it a bit, as well as seasoning with salt and pepper.

I love this recipe! Although quite good, the basic recipe is a little bland. I add a couple of the star anise pulled from the soup and blend it finely into the soup with fresh cracked pepper. It gives it a great extra kick without losing the flavor combo.

A delicious soup.

Very easy and ok flavor and the presentation with the star anise is beautiful. The flavors however weren't bold enough and more anise I believe would be overpowering (not a favorite flavor in our house anyway)- I did end up adding the leftover sauce from the Mussels with Cream,Fennel and White Wine from this site which gave it a bit more punch and complexity. Next time I will stick to the Carrot&Coriander that I created from another Carrot Soup recipe on this site (original uses clove)and use the Star Anise garnish. In travels to the UK Carrot&Coriander this seems to be a very popular soup, even sold chilled in grocery stores but no recipes to be found on Epicurious??

The peeled carrots are convenient but offer FAR less flavor than carrots you peel yourself - it takes 2-3 minutes for a pound, no big time requirement.

Very easy and enjoyable.

A great weeknight meal, especially for a starving student like myself. Couldn't find star anise so I supplemented anise extract, which still gave it a nice flavor. Though next time I may add some potatoes to make it more like the soup my spanish host mother used to make!

Very good and quite easy. Used 2 pounds of peeled, coarsely chopped regular-size carrots. Used dried thyme and regular anise seed, about a tablespoon of each. That made for a lightly flavoured, delicious, carroty (pardon the adjective) soup. Everyone liked it. Cheap enough, too, once you have the anise jar in the cupboard!

Easy soup with a very unusual flavor combination. My family loved it and want me to make it again soon.

I love carrot soup and the star anise gave this a lovely flavour. I'm vegetarian so used veggie stock. My 2 year old loved it!
