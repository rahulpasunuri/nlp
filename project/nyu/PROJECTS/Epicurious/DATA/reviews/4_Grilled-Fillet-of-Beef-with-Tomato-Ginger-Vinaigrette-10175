This is my favorite marinade. I made it before a camping trip and marinaded two ribeye steaks for two days. The meat fell apart when taking it off the grill, so be careful. The flavor is absolutely my favorite.

This is a Valentine's day staple for us - have been making this for years! I buy 2 individual steaks (not a whole filet) and marinate. The leftover vinaigrette goes on chicken, fish, salad, you name it. Yum!

I have made this a number of times and it is always a hit! i usually serve it with the corn and black bean tortilla cakes, and the vinaigrette goes great on those as well. I usually don't add as much olive oil as the recipe calls for and it still comes out great.

This recipe is easy to follow with fabulous results. I asked the butcher for the center- cut tenderloin and served this dish with the easy-to-make tomato vinaigrette. The meal was accompanied with the following recipes, and everything was served icebox cold for a hot August night extravaganza. My carnivore-eating friends were thoroughly impressed. Side dishes included other Epicurious recipes of Quinoa with corn, scallions and mint; along with the Eggplant, zucchini, red pepper, and parmesan torte. Epicurious, you always make me look like a hero in the kitchen. Thanks!

The tomato ginger vinaigrette keeps well and improves with age. I used it as a dressing on steak sandwiches with basil. So yummy! The filet and dressing don't excite me. I'd prefer serving the steak another way.

Spectacularly delicious. The marinade/sauce is just exquisite. I roasted this in the oven (city girl: no grill!) and it was just FINE, thank you very much. Don't change a thing!

The vinaigrette is VERY good for pasta salad too.

This is one of the best beef marinades I have used. No need for the vinagarette! Enjoy

unlike the other reviewers, I didn't marinade the beef, but only used the vinaigrette. It's fresh and delicious, with just a little kick -- just perfect for the simple roasted beef. Next time, I'll use less oil.

Very tasty!! I used ribeye steaks and marinated for 6 hours. Great flavor. I didn't make the ginger marinade and it still tasted great.

I loved this recipe and used it with chicken instead of beef and it turned out excellent! It was also very easy to make and would be great meal for having others over for dinner.

I don't have a grill, so I just roast the fillet in the oven. I've made this twice, and both times to raves. People practically have to be restrained from licking the vinaigrette off their plates! It's a perfect dish for the Dog Days of August, especially if you have no air conditioning, because you can roast the beef the day before and then serve it cold to guests, who'll never know your apartment was 200 degrees 24 hours earlier!

Very good. Would make this for company. Would only make half recipe of vinaigrette next time, used sparingly. A nice change from regular fillets.

i used a new york steak and grilled it on the bbq. everyone loved it. i didn't get a chance to use the vinaigrette that accompanied it. i will next time!

I have made this five times. It is always a hit and everyone wants to know how I make the beef so delicious. This dish is so easy. Serve it with the corn and black bean quesadillas. Everything can be prepared way ahead and it makes everyone think you're a marvelous cook.

I did this with 3/4" thick boneless pork chops and it was great. I recommend it over the steak. And silly person from NYC, you have to click on the recipe for the vinaigrette to see the ingredients for it (including the tomatoes) -that's why its underlined.

Being in the throes of a classic, chilly New England autumn, I chose to roast the fillets in my oven rather than grill them. A nice alternative, but I can easily imagine how much more the dish would benefit from grilling. Next time. A surprising combination of flavors and elements, I wasn't sure if it would make the cut- but it did.

This was a good dish and I served the Tomato Vinegarette with it. Most of my guests said it was good, but I had done better things with steak in the past. It was nice and light and still beat the A1 crowd. Most people still finshed it, but nobody went for seconds and the leftovers never made it out of my fridge.

Just one question - where is the tomato in this "tomato-ginger marinade"?

i have made this dish 5-6 times. never grilled a whole fillet before this recipe but it is easy and tastee. great for large crowds. i also use the tomato/ginger on grilled fish. excellent summer dish.
