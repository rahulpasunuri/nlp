made this as directed with the exception of using yoghurt in the dressing and arugula for the greens, as that is what I had on hand. used some winter squash pumpkin shaped thing from the CSA. the dressing is easy and amazing. had not tried toasting cumin seed in the past and was pleased with the result. served it over the quinoa from the Moroccan winter squash stew for some protein and I think helped balance the sweetness. Based on that recipe, i added some mint to the pumpkin prior to serving. leftovers were ok
