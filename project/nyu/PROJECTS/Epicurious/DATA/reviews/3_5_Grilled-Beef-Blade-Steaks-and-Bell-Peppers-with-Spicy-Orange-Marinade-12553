This was a fantastic marinade for boneless chicken breasts too! I added a heaping tsp of minced ginger. The chicken breasts were so juicy, tender, and flavorful. Do not be afraid of the red pepper flake, it didn't make it very hot at all.

Loved this marinade and also boiled the remainder to serve with the steak. The changes I made were Asian inspired as I felt the marinade leaned heavily that way already so I used 2 T. of seasoned rice wine vinegar and replaced the soy with Katsup Manis (sweet soy syrup) and added 1 T. grated fresh ginger. The dish got rave reviews from my guests. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/no tes/Grilled-Beef-Blade-Steaks-and-Bell- Peppers-with-Spicy-Orange-Marinade- 12553#ixzz1J7rJGcN3

Skipped the bell peppers, but the steaks were delicious.

Sorry, folks, didn't make the recipe, but one reviewer used green instead of red peppers cuz they're cheaper - well, the taste is cheaper too! Red (and yellow and orange) may be more expensive, but flavorwise, you get what you pay for.

Contrary to the other raved reviews, I thought this marinade was just horrible. I use Epicurious recipes all the time and this is my first disappointment. I knew I was in trouble when I smelled the marinade after I blended it in the blender... not pleasant. But I marinaded the steaks (sirloin) for 6 hours and grilled them to medium-rare doneness and the flavor was garlic-orange and just did not marry well. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained!

The marinade was fantastic but not spicy enough for me....I would double the red pepper. I also marinated vidalia onion slices and grilled them...wonderful.

Great marinade, which gives really tasty results. Following a previous reviewer's suggestion, I turned them into kebabs as well. I used bottom round, green bell peppers (much cheaper) instead of red, and Vietnamese chilli sauce instead of dried pepper flakes. Because my husband is a freak for sauces, I strained the marinade, skimmed off the oil, and boiled it. When it was somewhat reduced, I added a little cream, a little salt, and a little sugar, and turned it into a nice sauce to dribble over the kebabs. The kebabs go well when served over Quick Mexican Corn Risotto. A tasty marinade, a super meal.

Surprisingly good. Since I was marinating the beef for several days, I followed a previous reviewers suggestion, and added an extra T of vinegar. One note of caution -- if you marinate the bell peppers as long as the steaks (I mean, like for days, like I did), the peppers will be REALLY spicy!!! The meat, however, had a little kick, but was not really spicy. I actually did this recipe as kebabs, skewering the meat and bell peppers over the BBQ. That worked really well.

I had know idea that a blade steak could be so good. It is a cheep cut of meat but the maranade was wonderful. I only wish there were more recipes to choose from

This dish was delicious,the meat came out really tender.I do admit that I wasn't sure it would come out well,but the whole family loved it and the kids too. I marinated it for 2 days instead of overnight and on the second night I added more vinegar. I baked it in the oven. It was very tasty and I really recommend it. Congratulations!!!
