I was worried about making these, due to the mixed reviews, but I found them to be a refreshing diversion from the usual deviled egg. The lemon really brightened them up, and it was perfect for Spring and for our Easter party. I went with the parsley for my herb.

If you are looking for that Lawry's flavor, don't mess with success! If you like sour (à la cream or citrus), give these a go. I like it so much more than the mayo flavor that I want to try bumping up the 50:50 ratio next time. Without fresh herbs on hand, we grated a bit of zest over and sprinkled cayenne.

I don't think I'd make this particular recipe again, I've had other deviled eggs I liked more and my husband really wasn't a fan. But if you like the mixture of herbs and sour cream then this would be a good idea.

These were just deviled eggs, rather bland. The lemon didn't stand out, even after I added some extra zest and juice to the mix. Bummer too, they sounded good.

Absolutely outstanding! Can't stop thinking about these. Currently my favorite deviled egg recipe.

I make deviled eggs every week to always have on hand and so I am always on the lookout for variations. This was okay, but I tossed the recipe after a day as they don't have tons of flavor and truthfully they smell so bad in the fridge. I had to put them in tupperware where normally I cover with saran wrap. I did not find the flavor others did in these, nor did my husband who is not very critical of much food.

This is a recipe for the type of pleasant, well-behaved food that won't shock or offend anyone, but isn't unforgettable, either. Made these for a Mother's Day gathering, and everyone liked them; even the citrus haters liked the little kick of lemon. Didn't have sour cream on hand, so substituted non-fat plain yogurt, which worked fine; however, because it wasn't as think as sour cream would have been, when I doubled the recipe, still only needed 3 tb. of the yogurt.

I love anything with lemon. These were very good but not outstanding. I like other recipes better. I'm glad I tried it though, and they are perfect for Springtime.

I made this recipe last night for our Farmer's Market Picnic that is every Tuesday Night and these were by far the best Deviled eggs I've ever made. It's the lemon rind that makes them taste so fresh and spring like.

Really nice. I also use medium eggs when i devil. I like the bigger yolk to white ratio. To that end, I always make two or three extra eggs and use just the yolks to bulk up the filling mix. I like a well filled egg ; )

These remind me of the eggs I had as a kid only a bit more grown up. I used medium eggs because I think they are prettier deviled then I used meyer lemon and fresh dill for the herb on top. They were so beautiful elegant and delicious. All were devoured before dinner.
