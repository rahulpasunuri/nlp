Great hot or cold. Very easy and interesting. Good recipe if you've never made polenta before.

This is DELICIOUS-- too delicious. I felt like I was eating a cheese dessert. I'll make a version with half the cheese next time, or try out the sour cream substitute. Like some other reviewers, I had to bake it for more like 40 min before it achieved the right consistency.

I'm making this an the black bean chili ahead for a party--any make-ahead-and-transport tips?

This is fabulous! I enjoyed just eating the batter before baking. It set up fine for me, too, though I did have to bake it longer than suggested. I also agree that the chili it accompanies overwhelms the polenta, but I also enjoyed it just plain.

i just made this after oogling the recipe for a year now. i was unsure of whether or not it would be worth making because of all the negative press, but it was delicious!! i cut the recipe in half and used white cornmeal as the original recipe recommends. i also used low fat sour cream which did not seem to make a difference in richness (although i have not tried it with mascarpone yet) and used cheddar and jack in equal parts. it made an excellent companion to the black bean espresso chili... i can't wait to eat the leftovers!! for those that thought it was too goopey, try letting it cool down a little bit before serving and pair it with something piping hot...

I had the problems the other posters did too- after 25 minutes I had a cheese wafer on top and a watery mess on the bottom. I put back on the stove to cook 10 mins. more, then put BACK in the oven. Even so, still didn't firm up to expectations after cooling. So, end result: I spent over an hour cooking cheese grits, basically. What a waste.

A fabulous dish that we made along with the Black Bean and Espresso Chile and the Shrimp Veracruz (all in same issue of Bon Appetit)for a SuperBowl party. The entire feast was a huge hit with our company! An absolutely marvelous feast!

A coworker prepared this dish for us at a party. I almost dived in face first! It was wonderful! However, I think the black bean chili killed the taste. I would eat it just the way it is, without toppinbs, the whole pan, by myself! I plan to try this one at home.

I loved this recipe, even though I had to modify ingredients and proportions. Cut the recipe in half, used yellow cornmeal and a some grits since I ran out of yella.... Used jack cheese and Dubliner Irish cheese since that's what I had in the fridge. Otherwise, followed the recipe EXACTLY. ha ha! The polenta was fluffy, rich and addicting...I'm craving more right now.

I think that this recipe has been unfairly maligned! Other than using yellow corn meal and substituting sour cream for the mascarpone, I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy, different and delicious. Here's the facts: (1) it's easy to make; (2) it uses ingredients you probably have in the house anyway; (3)it's delicious in either of its two possible forms. OK, so it does have a bit of a split personality - creamy while warm and bread-pudding like after being refridgerated overnight. Both ways are delicious and present nicely wiht the chili. I'm a fan and will definitely make it again.

I agree with most of the criticism of this dish. Plain old polenta/corn meal will probably suffice. When this dish is covered with black bean espresso chili, you simply can't taste the two cheeses.

The complaints are silly. This is just a grits souffle without the grits and EGG WHITES, which you can add to lighten it up. Is very rich, but an easy make-ahead dish for 8 with yummy cold leftovers.

I would make this again, but not with cheddar. I might try gorgonzola or parmesan. The texture turned out fine and it was a nice soothing complement for the delicious, but zesty, Osso Bucco with olives.

Delicious. Very rich - not for the faint of heart. I'm surprised the other cooks had problems with the dish. I did not find it watery in the slightest. In fact I had to add a bit of water to keep it from getting burnt and over-dry.

I would never make this recipe again. It did not set-up as it should and was a watery mess. Don't waste your time or money for the expensive cheeses.

One of the worst recipes I've ever tried. Polenta did not "bake". It remained mushy with a crunchy cheese top. I don't know what I could have done wrong as I followed the recipe exactly. It is also not a serving for 8...more like a serving for 80!

Perfect winter comfort food. I used part Jack cheese and part Cheddar. Next time I'll use Gorgonzola.
