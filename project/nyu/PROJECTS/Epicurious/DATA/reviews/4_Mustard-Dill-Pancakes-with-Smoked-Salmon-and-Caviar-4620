Has anyone made the pancakes ahead and frozen them? Did they reheat well? How did you reheat them?

Serve with good Champagne for a festive occasion.

A staple on Thanksgiving with top quality smoked salmon and caviar. Everything goes in the food processor except the mustard seeds (for a bit of crunch)

Made these today for Easter and they were TO DIE FOR. I knew I'd held onto this recipe for a reason! Sorry I waited so long. Just a few thing: 1) Let these cool on a cookie rack so they don't get heavy and doughy. 2)I did make them silver-dollar sized so people could pick them up if they desired. 3) They were OK room temp., but much better heated. 10 min. of nuking did the trick. 4) I didn't think I would like the mustard seed, but it was brilliant. 5) I added another t of Dijon to the batter for taste and it was just right. Can wait to make these again using parsley & prociutto, smoked turkey & chives, etc. This is a real keeper!

I made this as a first course for Christmas dinner. There were only 4 of us, so we had the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Either way, it was delicious and easy.

I made these for New Years and they were a raving success. Because I was taking them to a friend's house, I didn't worry about keeping them warm, and just served at room temp. I also added a sprig of dill on top for a festive touch. Definately a keeper.

Really really good and visually very nice. The mustard seeds (whole) add a nice crunch for texture. I used homemade creme fraiche instead of sour cream. The next time I think that I will add a bit more mustard to the pancakes for more of a kick. (Maybe I'll try horseradish mustard!)

Very tasty and good. Use top quality smoked salmon for best results.Try scant tablespoon for batter. I also added chopped red onion and fresh dill to sour cream.

I made this as a first-course for an elegant brunch when it first appeared in the magazine. It is absolutely, totally sublime! My guests didn't want to eat anything else and kept asking for more of this. Naturally, you just want to use a tiny, tiny dollop of caviar on each.

It is probably the most delicious pancake one can make. Unfortunately, I cannot make it too often for it is very very rich, and high on fat. Don't forget Champaign!

I have used this recipe several times and it never fails to impress! It looks fantastic and tastes event better! Be sure to use smoked sockeye salmon (if available) for maximum enjoyment!
