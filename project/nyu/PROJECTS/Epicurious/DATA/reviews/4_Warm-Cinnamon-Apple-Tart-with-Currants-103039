This tart is beautiful, easy and delicious. It earned raves at a holiday dinner party. Did add a dash of rum and the currants to the sauce and reduced cook time to 20-25 min as suggested by others. Also used reduced sugar preserves to no ill effect. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This is a fabulous recipe for your reptiore. It's extremely easy, comes together in a snap and it tastes much more complicated than it actually is. I was out of apricot preserves, so I used some champagne jelly I had on hand. I simply heated the sauce ingredients in the microwave. That worked perfectly. As a another reviewer noted, it does look like there is a lot of cinammon sugar mixture, but it works perfectly with the tart as a whole. Go make this!

Made this several times. Last time, b/c I was too lazy to wash another pot, I microwaved the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl. Came out just fine! (Peaches do not work too well for this recipe, too much liquid)

I made this dessert last night for friends, and it was so delicious and so easy to prepare that I just had to chime in and encourage everyone to try it. Like many of the previous reviewers, I found this recipe to be very easy to prepare. I did shorten the baking time to about 20 minutes, which made my guests happy because they could hardly stand waiting for this lovely, aromatic tart to come out of the oven. Enjoy!

This has got to be one of the best tarts I have ever made. It is unbelievably simple to make, the presentation is outstanding and the taste is superb. The magazine worded this recipe perfect "Sophistication in a snap!" The bake time is more accurate at 20-25 minutes and do add a dash of dark rum to the sauce. You simply cannot go wrong with this recipe. A must!

Ohhh, excellent! The only thing I would modify is the apricot sauce, which was extremely sweet. There also was way too much of it. The suggestion to add rum does seem tempting :) There also seemed to be a lot of cinnamon-sugar topping, but it ended up tasting just fine. Aside from that, this dessert was wonderful for both the eyes and the tongue. The currants are important for the visual color contrast (can barely taste them); the ice cream is absolutely required to balance the taste.

This was a very simple, pretty and delicious dessert. I wasn't able to find currants, so substituted dried cranberries instead. It tasted wonderful and got rave reviews from friends when I served it.

Delicious and easy!! A light, fresh, crisp alternative to pie. I left out the currants upon guest's request -wasn't missing them either. Vanilla bean ice cream is always a nice complement to a dish like this.

Very good. But the best part is that it's SO EASY! I think next time I will use Brandy soaked apples and brush the tart w/ melted perserves and a Brandy mix. See the French Apple-Almond tart on Epicurious for details. Yum. Yum.

What a great, easy dessert! My in-laws loved it and so did I. There seemed to be a lot of cinnamon-sugar topping--I will probably use only 1 T. sugar + 1/4t. cinnamon. The apricot preserves also add sweetness. Didn't have any currants on hand, so left them off. Didn't seem like they were missing, but would be visually appealing. I only had to bake it 20 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. I will definitely add this to my file.

Reviewed this before and tried it again yesterday. Consistently great- made two of these as part of a buffet and all but one piece disappeared. Got comments on how pretty it looked even though it is so simple to make.

Lovely, fresh, updated (hopefully fewer calories) version of that comforting, satisfying favorite, APPLE PIE. At least this one has only one crust. Easy, less mess than pie. SUGGESTION: add currants or white raisins to apricot sauce while heating. It plumps them up before serving, giving them a better texture. How about a dash of RUM to the sauce while heating?

VeryVery good and SO simple. I tried a variation, using peach preserves instead, coupled with vanilla bean ice cream. Absolutely excellent. One houseguest who professed to not like pastries was very pleasantly surprised!

The easiest apple tart recipe I've ever made, and the result is excellent. Definitely needs the ice cream, however. You absolutely have to try it.

This dessert was so simple to make - it took no time at all - but my dinner guests thought I'd really gone all out. I'll definately be making it again, because I just loved it - and the compliments!

i am a total chocoholic and a compulsive baker. I thought that this was a great dessert. It tastes great and does not appear to be simple. I have served it twie and both times it got rave reviews. THis is a great dessert in a pinch. Buy the pastry ahead of time and leave it in the freezer.

Easy to make and delicious. Can be made early in the day and reheated or served at room temperature. Looks beautiful!
