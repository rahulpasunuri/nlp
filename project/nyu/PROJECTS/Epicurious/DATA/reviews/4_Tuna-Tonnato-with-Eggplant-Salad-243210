The point of the jar is to make the salad portable - took ours to the beach and it was fantastic! Made it exactly as written (OK - no anchovy). Found jarred grilled eggplant and the best roasted peppers at Harris Teeter (their brand). Used grape tomatoes - even better the next day

I altered this recipe for various reasons and it still worked out delicious. First I omitted the anchovy and added some ground black pepper to the tuna. I grilled my own eggplant (with olive oil, salt & pepper) but followed the rest of the recipe. I did not put it in the jar (actually I didn't really get the purpose of this) but rather served the 3 parts on a plate with some rucola, grilled red peppers and bread. It was easy and had excellent flavour...could be a nice antipasti or part of a Mediterranean meze if you add hummus and some other nice dishes.

In the UK, the grilled eggplant (aubergine) in oil is available in all grocery stores in the deli/prepared foods area. This is a great lunch recipe, the flavors are powerful and I found that less olive oil in the tonnato prevents the dish from being too wet. Mint and tomatoes packed with flavor are critical for cutting through the strong tuna combination.

canned italian tuna is pretty common in most grocery stores. Eggplant not so much - try whole foods, trader joes or cost plus world market. I've had luck in all three. Haven't tried the recipe yet but will very soon and report back.

Good luck finding jarred eggplant and tuna in Italian olive oil. Four stores later, I'm not sure I even want to make it anymore!!
