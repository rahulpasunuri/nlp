This was delicious on top of vanilla ice cream for a dinner party. Next time I would cut down on the sugar. It's a keeper.

My three children, aged 8 and under, request their strawberries with "the sauce" instead of just plain. This is spectacular, everyone raves, and it's foolproof!

I and my guests thought these were lovely. I served them alongside the Three Cities of Spain Cheesecake. The vinegar doesn't overwhelm the strawberries--it just adds another dimension to them. They were kid-approved by a 12 year old as well!

Very simple and very tasty. A great simple dessert. I just served it over ice cream and it worked great and everyone was quiet while eating!

Super Simple! Super Easy! Super Good! I actually let it sit for a couple days and the vinegar flavor was not pronounced even though it was a supermarket brand. Served with ice cream and cake, excellent!

SO simple to make, and it will sweeten up any unripe strawberries you may have, too. I tend to use more balsamic vinegar since I want a lot more "sauce."

I was a little skeptical about adding balsamic, but it turned out sooo awesome! I will definitely make this again.

Delicious. Garnished with some finely chopped mint to serve.

I was quite apprehensive but the strawberries were delicious.

Used local quebec berries in season with an 8 year old balsamic, a bit less sugar and added some freshly cracked pepper - excellent - friends enjoy it each any time i serve it.

these berries go great on french toast for an extra special breakfast on a sunday morning.

Used with imported strawberries so my expectations were low. WOW. The vinegar intensifies the berry flavour; I was just expecting them to taste sweet. I used to avoid berries outside the local season but now I can use this recipe if I am desperate for a strawberry and can't wait. My friends were also quite impressed.

Not much to add. Fixed half the recipe for the two of us and served with good vanilla ice cream. Will do that again.

Spectacular flavor for almost no work - it doesn't get much better than that!

You can't beat the ease of preparation with this one. I added a dozen mint leaves which I sliced into ribbons. Simply divine.

I made it to accompany an angel food cake... we drained nearly all the sauce, so it didn't soak into the cake. Fabulous low-fat, low-calorie dessert!

This was a great recipe. I think next time I'll let it marinate for longer (I gave in after about 45 minutes and couldn't wait any longer)! I also served too much of the sauce/juice with the berries, and I found it to be a bit too strong. Next time I'll just serve a bit of the juice.

I hardly ever give four forks. I mean really, how can anything really be "a dish beyond compare." But anything that is this easy that tastes this good gets four forks. I even made it with splenda rather than sugar and it still was fabulous.

fantastic! this is going to be my new secret weapon. i hate to admit that i used frozen strawberries (fresh were far too expensive), and it still tasted scrumptious.

This simple recipe delights guests time and time again. If you use a 12 year old balsamic, then no sugar is needed at all. Add some fresh blackberries for even more taste and some color variation.

Have been making this for years, but with one IMPORTANT addition...fresh ground black pepper over each individual servings...no one knows what it is and everyone wants more. Try it, you won't regret it

Combined this recipe with the Coach Farm Creme Fraiche with fruit recipe from Epicurious with great results. For a bit of decadence, put the whole thing over a sweet desert bread. I used banana-blueberry bread, and it was great!

One word of advice--use decent vinegar. I tried it the first time with generic balsamic and it was terrible. I knew from the reviews that I had to be doing something wrong, so I got different balsamic vinegar, and that made all the difference in the world. So taste your vinegar before you put it on the strawberries--if it has a really harsh vinegar-y finish, it's not going to go well on fruit.

I love vinegar, but I was a bit apprehensive about combining vinegar and strawberries, but after reading the other reviews, I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. EXCELLENT!

Rating: 3
This recipe seemed to odd to pass up, and I'm glad I didn't! The combination of sugar+vinegar created an attractive "glaze" texture, and the overall flavor was sweet, not sour or overly vinegary. I served it over vanilla frozen yogurt and would definitely make this again.

Absolutely marvelous! Simple, scrumptious, and awesome on vanilla ice cream!!!!!

Never tried this before--delicious!! Another favorite of mine that I learned in a canadian restaurant--sprinkle black pepper over strawberries--really brings out their sweetness.

Wow. Somehow balsamic makes strawberries taste more like strawberries. I had to try this, because it seemed just too weird. I made this yesterday, intending to have it after letting it marinate an hour, but I ended up having it today (refridgerated overnight). It was basically 3/4 liquid, 1/4 strawberries today, not as good as yesterday, but still so good. So sweet. I am willing to bet, though, that a good quality balsamic is essential. I spooned it over fresh ice milk that I just made. Added the leftover liquid to the remaining ice milk -- fantastic and very pretty. Next time I have substandard, anemic strawberries, I will try this to liven them up. If you love strawberries, you owe it to yourself to try this.

It doesn't get any easier or more delicious! The flavor of the strawberries (even those in the middle of January) burst through with just the addition of balsamic vinegar and sugar! It is wonderful paired with the tartness of the Lemon-Almond Buttermilk loaf. Don't miss this one!

My guests could not believe that I simply added balsamic vinegar to the strawberries. They thought that I somehow had come across the sweetest strawberries in all of Southern California.

Delicious! I also used brown sugar instead of regular and everyone raved! I served it as a side to poundcake and it will now be a staple!

Wonderful! They're an easy but special addition to the poundcake. I loved them, my boyfriend thought they were "ok"..nothing special.

I loved it, my husband just liked it. We both agreed that, if eaten just on their own, we prefer sliced strawberries simply with sugar and lemon juice. However, as a topping for ice cream, this was a nice change.

The balsamic vinegar brings out a wonderful flavor in the strawberries.

I have made these many times now.Everyone I have served them to just fell in love with them but can not believe that they have basalmic vinegar. I think they are even better when made with brown sugar and for a change add a dash of fresh ground black pepper. I always use the pepper when serving with lemon yogurt, ice cream, or sour cream.

I agree with my fellow North Bay-ite! I add fresh mint and serve it with low fat/no fat lemon yogurt. Delicious!

You haven't eaten strawberries until you've tried them with balsamic vinegar!
