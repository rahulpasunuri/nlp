The basil-lemon mayonnaise is delicious with the chilled artichoke. I added dried onion, oregano, salt and pepper to the water while boiling. A nice alternative to a dinner salad.

My husband and I LOVED the dip. Artichokes are such a pain to eat ... a lot of work for very little "meat".

This was a hit. I added a dash of paprika for a little spice and it was really good.

Delicious. I agree with another reviewer: 45 minutes was too long to boil the artichokes (they fell apart). I used home-made mayonnaise instead of Hellmans--yum! Also would recommend only lightly salting the water--the artichokes absorb more salt when boiling than say, pasta.

The amount of boiling time the recipe states made the artichokes a bit too mushy for my taste, but my partner loved them; so next time I'll shorten the cook time to 30 min and see how we fare.

Tasty and quick. Good for groups, yes. I steamed the artichokes & added more garlic. Only had dried basil and it worked fine as a sub- fresh would be much better though.

This was an easy dip to make from ingredients I already had on hand. I changed it just a little, substituting 1 cup of mayo for 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of Marie's Chunky blue cheese dressing. Very tasty!!

I have made this dip exactly as written. It's a great do-ahead dish for any kind of gathering, from Super Bowl parties to summer pool parties. It never fails to impress, and I've never had any leftovers. I steam the artichokes ahead of time, let them cool, cut them in half, remove the choke, and arrange them overlapped (cut side down) on a platter with the dip in a red bell pepper or a small bowl. It's a standout amidst 7-layer dips (ugh!)or anything else on the table. Also,,no need to worry that your dish will be duplicated by anyone else at the party!

Made this for a dinner party and it was a great hit! All the ladies wanted the recipe! Would definitely make it again.

I didn't actually use this recipe, but was inspired by it to just mix equal parts of fat-free mayo and store-bought pesto, which made a fabulous, super-easy dip for artichoke leaves.

I am, by no means, an artichoke connoisseur. However, I found this dip to be rather one-dimensional. Next time I'll look for a different dip.

The mayo dip is rich but worth it. I steamed the artichokes instead of covering them with water and they turned out fine. Simple but elegant. I'll go them for company now.
