Amazing preparation of mackerel, absolutely loved it. Be careful not to let the glaze sit too long it becomes hard to work with. Instead of the avocado I made coconut saffron rice (http://thaifood.about.com/od/thaisnacks/r/coconutsaffronrice.htm) and green beans and it was amazing.

Thanks to the suggestions I made only half recipe of glaze which was enough. To make the glaze thick, remove from heat after cooked down and it will thicken in several minutes or so. I did not have to reheat it. The cooking time was perfect. My family and I are not sure that avacado makes a good side.

Easy and quite tasty. Skip the salt, the dish is quite salty as it is. Also, there is not need for so much glaze, I had a lot left over. I skipped the avocado salad and rice and served the mackerel over soba noodles, along with sesame spinach and fresh cucumber relish. Oh, and sprinkling some sesame seeds on the fish right before serving makes for a lovely presentation.

I have never seen my wife finish a fish dish before. This is delicious; and definitely should be tampered with.

This is a variation on a standard fish marinade that includes a sweet, a salt and a sour (or pungeant.) I regularly make a similar one for salmon that is served at LongHorn Steakhouse: brown sugar (sweet), soy (salt), bourbon (pungeant), plus garlic powder and onion powder. You can also add dry mustard. So, experiments/substitutions in the "formula" (like red wine or brandy) are great. You may want to try it once as written and then vary it one ingredient at a time after that. Or not!

I used this recipe for blue fish since I couldn't find one for blue fish. I had to bake for an additional 10 minutes at 400 since it was not done sufficiently after the 5 minutes of broiling. It was delicious.

I was out of Sherry, so made this with cooking Marsala. It was good, but a little too salty. I did use low sodium soy sauce, but it still came out salty.

To the Cook from Berlin: Relax! Cooking is about experimentation! If you want rules, stick to baking. I liked it as is but next time, I am going to try it with Apricot Brandy!

Absolutely delicious - this recipe quickly became a regular in our house. It's elegant enough for guests, but also easy enough for a weeknight. I have occasionally substituted bluefish for mackerel, and it is just as delicious.

TO maraflux: It's not how long you heat it, it's whether or not you boil enough of it away, i.e., to 1/3c. Somerville - how do you know, you didn't make the recipe. Apricot brandy?? About the saltiness - it might be the brand of soy sauce you're using. Should be good quality light soy. Plain rice seemed a little, well, plain so I added some Schwarzkümmel (sorry, I'm not sure what it is or what it's called in English but it adds an earthy, roasted, slightly oniony taste). I'm sure the dish would be great with any strong tasting somewhat oily fish, I certainly liked it with mackerel, a fish to which I'm not actually partial.

Tasted great but the sauce never became a "glaze" and I heated it for about 35 minutes. It was tasty but quite thin.

Delicious! I used red wine vinegar instead of rice, and apricot brandy instead of sherry, and it still turned out great. I also used catfish, as I prefer it. My husband and I loved it and would use with other fish. I recommend with rice.

This was amazing. I had to use tilapia, and I ended up baking for 10 minutes after trying to broil for 4 minutes, but the glaze was excellent. It went very well with the lemony avocado. Not at all too salty - I don't understand that review.

Incredibly salty. Must be something wrong with the recipe.
