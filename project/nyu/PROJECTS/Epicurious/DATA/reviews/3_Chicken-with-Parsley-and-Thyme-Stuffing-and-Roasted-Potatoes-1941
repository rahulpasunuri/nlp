Great recipe! Warning though, the recipe calls for "bread crumbs", this actually means shredded fresh bread. NOT the bread crumbs you buy in the store. I found out the hard way... and I do mean HARD! I'll be making this often!

Great cold wet Sunday afternoon dinner. I've added other veggies in with the potatoes with good results.

By adding the bacon/sausage to the chicken it made it very heavy in taste. I revised the recipe a second time and didn't add it and the bird was much better

Tasty dish, but not for the calorie conscious. Great for company. I tried it using two chickens, and added carrots and onions for the last hour.

The bird was great. The stuffing bombed. Six cups of breadcrumbs turned the stuffing into a sandbox.
