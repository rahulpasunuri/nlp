A great soup for a day when you don't want to turn on the stove, and one that my guests have repeatedly raved about. It's better the next day, after the flavors have had time to meld.

This is a yummy little cold soup - you wouldn't make it every day...but with the right menu - it's delicious. We omitted the juice and I pureed half of the soup and left the other half chunky. We also added salt and a few Tbl. of Champagne vinegar along with some hotter peppers.

This is a wonderful summer soup - and a terrific alternative to traditional gazpacho. Even my husband loved it!
