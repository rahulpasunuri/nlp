Great combination of flavors! A taste sensation. We sometimes make it a main dish by adding sliced cold tenderloin or cold shrimp. I would not make any changes whatsoever.

Yum! A refreshing, well-coordinated combination of flavors, textures and colors.

Yuck. These flavors do not combine well together and I discourage anyone from trying this. However, if you must, consider these changes: halve the amount of onion, or omit it all together--this flavor is particalurly sharp and really drowns out the flavor of everything else. Also make sure to slice both the onion and the fennel paper thin, otherwise the consistency is all wrong. Also, I would consider omitting either the orange rind or the pepper. Again, these flavors do not combine particularly well on this salad and the orange could quite easily go. 
