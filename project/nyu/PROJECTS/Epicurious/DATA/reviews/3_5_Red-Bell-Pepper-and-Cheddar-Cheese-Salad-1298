Pretty good. I have the March 1993 issue and this is called 'Red Bell Pepper and Cheddar Cheese Spread'. I think the word 'Salad' was a typo on the website. But I think next time I will try it as a salad per the previous reviewer's suggestion. Sounds tasty!

READ WITH CAUTION This recipe is amazing as a REAL SALAD. I roasted 6 huge garlic cloves and 2 small shallots. And then I mashed them to a paste with a fork and some red hawaiian salt (I'm guessing kosher salt will do the trick too). I added cayenne and good quality olive oil and red wine vinegar. Then I SLICED the red peppers that I roasted into ribbons and put them into the dressing and refrigerated for about an hour. I used bagged washed romaine salad (p.s. I'm lazy) and the small size brick of extra sharp white cheddar (the one I used was washed in port but whatever...) I shaved about a 1/4 inch off the top with a cheese plane and crumbled the pieces. Toss all together and serve. It's SO much better than the "dip" that they decribe in this recipe.

I used a really good sharp cheddar, but I didn't let it refridgerate 2 hours (maybe 30 minutes). It was OK, but the goodness of the cheddar was diluted by the peppers rather than being enhanced.
