Used flank steak, marinated four hours. I thought this tasted great, even though I could not taste the cilantro after it was cooked. My balsamic was a maple fig, so that might have added another dimension.

A easy, savory marinade that makes grilling skirt steak--with its uneven dimension and tendancy toward toughness- -a breeze. The worcestshire gives it a steakhouse aroma that is appealing.

In full disclosure, I was afraid an entire tablespoon of cayenne would be way too much for my kiddos so I substituted an equal amount of Montreal Steak Seasoning (because they love it). That was a great sub - we were licking our plates clean. I served strips of skirt steak on whole wheat tortillas topped with smoky Mexican cheese, cilantro, and sauteed onions and peppers. I'll be making my modified version of this recipe again and again.

This has become my go to recipe for skirt steak. The balsamic vinegar and kosher salt combine to produce an exceptionally tender steak. The cayenne gives just the right amount of kick. We know steak here in the Windy City and I have been preparing this skirt steak to rave reviews for years.

this has become one of our staple meals. my 9 year old can't get enough of it. prefers it to NY strip and better cuts of meat. add Lime to give it a little extra zing.

By the way.. anyone else fed up with the positioning of "rollover" ads on Epicurious? Not exactly easy to use the toggle bar on the right side of a recipe and not inadvertently activate the expanded Westin ads. Ugh

Guess I'll go down as an a$$hole in part because I'm in a small minority of underwhelmed reviewers of this recipoe and in part because of what I'm about to say. This was an utterly unremarkable marinade. It was far too trite to go through the trouble of blending ingredients. In fact this probably would have worked better with less Worcestershire, less balsamic. Maybe citrus instead of all that vinegar. Maybe more aromatic vegetables. Perhaps fennel. As written it's got "Susie Homemaker's dinners prepared between soaps and Oprah" cookbook. PASS.

Gave it 4 Forks because hubby and kids loved it. The skirt steak was tender and flavorful. Easy recipe to follow. Grilled some red peppers on the side and served the steak with rice. Will definitely make it again!

Excellent marinade. I made it exactly as stated. I LOVED this, and will make it again and again. I'm just sorry I discovered it so late in the grilling season! Will have to try it under the broiler.

i was worried because the balsamic I had was not very tasty and I only had dry cilantro but WOW! I also reduced the used marinade down for a dipping sauce and that was incredible as well. this is going on the list of favorite marinades.

I was rather disappointed with this recipe given the rave reviews. it was OK, but not great. I thought it was too vinegary and not very interesting.

Truly exceptional, and I don't say that often. I made this exactly to specifications, other than I halved the meat knowing 2 lbs. was enough for three of us (kept the same quantity of marinade, will re-use), and used some green onions in place of the shallots. (I also did use the Alton Brown trick of pulling the meat off the grill early and sealing in aluminum foil to rest for 10-15 minutes while I finished everything else. Great results.) My sides were grilled red and green bell peppers and onions drizzled with olive oil and balsamic, and garlic toast with mozzarella and parmesan. I'm telling you, this was as good a meal as I've eaten in a couple years. The only reason I stopped eating all of it was to save some for later. Incidentally, the skirt steak I used was from a larger batch that I bought and had made a couple earlier recipes from. This recipe, by far, turned out the most tender and flavorful steak of all.

This is the best beef marinade recipe I've found. I used flap steak instead of skirt steak because it's more readily available at my supermarket. I used less than half of the suggested cayenne. I made the whole recipe for the marinade, but used only two pounds of meat. I also marinated the meat overnight in the refrigerator in a ziploc, even though the recipe says not to do that. I cooked the meat in a grill pan on the stove--was careful not to overcook. I then cut the meat into very thin strips to serve as skirt steak tacos. This meal is a favorite of our teenage boys--and about two pounds of meat can feed a family of five as tacos.

This is good. Scaled down well for a smaller steak. Gave three over four as I am not convinced this is THE skirt steak marinade. I liked the spice of the cayenne (the portion here was not spicy, so don't fear it) - felt it needed a touch of sweetness.

YUMMM!!! Make this.. I usually don't like to marinate meat but this brought such flavor... didn't take anything away from the meat just enhanced it!

Truly amazing dish that's been a crowd pleaser for me multiple times now. The richness of the marinade brings not only bursting flavors but keeps the meat even more tender. I'll make this one again, and again, and again!

I've lost count how many times I've made this dish - friends askfor it repeatedly! I emulsify all ingredients before putting the steak in a ziploc to marinate for no more than 3 hours. Be sure to scrape off excess as not to char. It's pretty good on Boneless Rib Eyes as well!

The marinade is excellent, but I would suggest going easy on the cayenne. The full T makes it really hot! It didn't tenderize our really tough cut of skirt steak, but it was delicious none-the-less

didn't bother with the shallots OR the blender. took about two minutes to whip up the marinade, and i let it soak for about seven hours in pyrex, turning once. it was mouth-watering. incredible. and so so easy. my husband thinks i'm a culinary master. i will make this all summer.

I go to this recipe over and over. I have adjusted it a little bit since I don't like cilantro so I have substitued a little of Penzey's Mural of Flavor dried herbs and I use a balsamic glaze that I find adheres to the meat a little better and is less expensive than the balsamic vinegar we keep in the house.

Great marinate, I cut up a cored apple into slices and place it in the marinate to absorb the acidity, works very well!

Hooche-Mama! Try this on two-inch thick Fresh Tuna steaks! I marinated them for three hours and seared them on a hot grill for 5 minutes per side. The result -- RAVES!!!

I use this marinade all summer long with steak on the grill -- never fails to disappoint. love how easy it is to just whip up in a blender; then you forget about it till it's literally time to throw it on the grill.

Amazing! Best with grilled red peppers/onions from another skirt steak recipe from this site. Love the balsamic flavors.

I love this recipe. It is my favorite beef marinade. I don't change a thing except deleting Cilantro which I hate and marinating at least 6-8 hours. I've used it for flank and skirt steaks but also tougher roasts from wild game such as venison and bear.

I used this marinade on a flap steak (similar to the skirt but bigger and thicker..not longer). I didn't have the cilantro so I used coriander powder (I figured it comes from the same plant), onions instead of shallots and about 1/3 of the cayenne..I was very afraid to use so much cayenne and even thought that the amount I used seemed like we would be breathing fire. Next time I will use at least half of the cayenne because although the cayenne definitely warmed it up it wasn't the heat that was noticeable but the flavor of the cayenne. I was also making this for kids and thought the amount of cayenne might be too much. My 9 and 7 yr olds kept asking for more. So did my husband. I'll try this one again using more of the cayenne. I'm going to keep ramping it up and see what happens.

My guests devoured the steak..carnivores:) The meat was tender, moist, delicious, chock full of flavor and along with the tabbouleh salad which kept the palate fresh for more! I am making it again this week for my other guest...definitely a keeper for me!!!

This is a delicious marinade. The steak was so tender and flavorful. It's great cold over a simple salad. Reminds me a bit of Korean bbq.

This is an excellent recipe, and very versatile. Other cuts of meat (e.g. flank steak) work fine. Also, you can cut meat into strips before marinating. Works great on the grill.

It is also known as coarse salt.

Kosher salt is larger flakes than regular salt, it is technically Jewish (thus Kosher) but in the States you can find it in most grocery stores. A sea salt would do the same in this recipe.

What is kosher salt? Is it Salt? Sorry, but I can't find it here & noboby has heard of it. Is it a brand name in America?
