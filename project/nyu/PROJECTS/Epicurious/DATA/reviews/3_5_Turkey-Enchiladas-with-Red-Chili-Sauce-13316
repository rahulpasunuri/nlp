This was a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I prefer a thinner enchilada sauce so I simmered down the chilis cooking broth to 1 3/4 cup and added that to sauce along with 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp ground oregano, and 2 tbs veg oil (spices from an older traditional enchilada sauce recipe I've had for years).

We made this recipe using leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Turkey is not the best choice for enchiladas and I don't hold that against this recipe. However, the 'red chili sauce' was quite bland. The enchiladas made with it had very little flavor; those we made using generic canned enchilada sauce tasted better (though still not all that great.) I make enchiladas from Diana Kennedy's Essential Cuisines of Mexico on a regular basis, and those are much better -- this recipe wasn't good enough to make it into our rotation.

For those in the US who are not aware, when it calls for fresh chopped Coriander and Coriander garnish, it means Cilantro. Coriander, as we call it in the US, is the fruit from the herb (though it is commonly referred to as the seed, which is actually different). But as sprigs of fresh coriander fruit are ridiculously hard to find (unless you grow your own), one can safely assume they mean Cilantro, which is a very common ingredient in Enchiladas.

Was looking for a chipotle red enchilada sauce and used this as a base. Added a couple of the chilis from a can of chipotles in adobo to the NM chilis while cooking. Then added the rest of the chipotles and adobo to the blender. Followed "A Cook from Santa Fe"'s suggestion to add cumin (didn't have any ground coriander) and simmer. Pretty good for a first attempt. Got to get some coriander next time. Also like to try making a big batch and freezing some.

This is a great way to use left over Turkey but also a good use of left over chicken, pork or beef. When I am in a hurry I use canned "chili colorado" or red enchilada sauce. Also - I wrap 6 or 8 corn tortillas in a damp kitchen towel and microwave them for about 90 seconds to soften instead of using the oil - this brings the fat content down a little without hurting the flavor.

Yummy, though the only change that I did make was that I put the tortillas in the oven to heat up as opposed to cooking in oil. We make this at least twice a month

Not a bad way to use leftover holiday turkey, but I wouldn't make it otherwise.

I am reviewing the sauce. The sauce was wonderful. Made the following changes added 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes, salt, and fresh lime juice. My family loved it. A vast improvement from the canned variety.

Use The Santa Fe chefs way to make the sauce. We do it that way in El Paso too. If I have to use canned chile rojo I use Hatch or Las Palmas. I also will skip the poultry and just fill with asedero cheese or a nice jack. My husband likes them stacked and topped with a fried egg on top. Same prep as rolled, just sandwich filling and sauce between 3 tortillas. easier to make too.

This was a great after thanksgiving dish. I used some chilis I had purchased in Hatch, NM and had been meaning to use. They were the Hot variety so I ended up using a lot less than the recipe called for and adding a few spoonfulls of crushed tomatoes. I also used extra garlic and extra cheese. I served it with the spanish style rice with zucchini (also this site) some refried beans, sour cream, diced tomato, olives, the avocado, and margaritas. It was a hit.

This is an all-time favourite in our family! I use leftover chicken or turkey and Victoria brand enchilada sauce and the results are always magnificent. My kids ask for it all the time. A great recipe.

This is how we make red chili sauce in New Mexico. Remove seeds and stems from dry red chilis. Cover chili pods with water and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, dry roast chili seeds and whole garlic cloves until fragrant (careful of the fumes). Place cooked chili pods in blender with some of the cooking water (or chicken stock); add the roasted seeds and garlic. Carefully puree (watch that it doesn't come spurting out of the lid) until smooth. Strain pureed mixture, pushing against solids until pretty dry (that's where all the flavor is). Transfer to saucepan; add ground cumin, ground coriander and salt. SIMMER (don't boil)for 30 minutes. Use in enchilada recipe or others. Freezes well.

We've made this recipe in our family many times. Usually we use cooked leftover chicken and canned enchilada sauce and it is still extremely delicious and very quick. Even better the next day!

I guess I got hold of some chilis that were past their punch or something, because this sauce was bland enough that we were compelled to doctor it with one of the many bottled hot sauces in our collection. Beyond that, the rest of the dish was just plain boring.

We really liked this recipe. The sauce is fairly spicy (I'd say 4 stars on a scale of five!) and VERY delicious....We added black olives to the enchiladas and used pepper-jack cheese. Definately a keeper....

YUMMY!! If you make your own red chili sauce as I did, it does need alot of salt. It's even better the second day (I just ate my leftovers for lunch!)

Great but needed just a few more cloves of garlic To reduce the fat try dry frying the tortillas in a non stick pan. works just as good!
