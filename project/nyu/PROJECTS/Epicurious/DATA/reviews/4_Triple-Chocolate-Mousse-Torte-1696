I've made this recipe many times over that past few years, and always to rave reviews. I make as written, but I usually do add a base. A couple of times I made a thin genoise with a little frambois to moisten. Other times I have made a simple chocolate graham cracker crust. Both are good, but the mousse definitely can stand on its own.

I made this for a friends 50th B-day party. Everyone loved it. I did add a graham cracker crust with 1/2 cup of corsely chopped pecans added to crust mixture. I also served with a raspberry sauce and fresh whipped cream. To be able to add 1 1/3 cup whipped cream to each bowl of chocolate, I had to whip a little more. I would suggest 2 1/4 cups instead of the 1 3/4 the recipe calls for. Recipe was not complicated and very good!

I made this for a dinner party on New Years and had many nice compliments on it. I used Lindt white coconut chocolate for the top layer and it was excellent! It gave it a bit of a tropical flavor. Next time I might try making it in an 8in springform pan, as the individual chocolate layers were not very high. I will definitely be making this again. YUMMY!

I used this recipe in combination with several other recipe components to create a high layered torte. I used a crispy bottom crunch made from cocoa crispy cereal, finely chopped peanuts and melted semi- sweet chocolate. Then I made a 2 layer dark chocolate cake in 9 inch pans and prepared the mousses as indicated in the recipe. I layered the mousses and cake layers on top of the crunch in a ring mold lined with acetate (you could use a 9 inch springform pan and a parchment paper collar also). I started and ended with mousse, topped it with more crunch and drizzled homemade salted caramel sauce on it. It was awesome!! This mousse recipe is wonderful by itself as the flavors and texture are perfect, not too sweet and not too dense or rich. I do like contrasting textures in a mousse desert though. I recommend this recipe and a little crunch to go with it!

Made this for my hubby for Valentine's Day. It was very good, I agree there's a LOT of dishes used but all in all pretty easy. I didn't change much but DID end up using more whipping cream, the 1/3 that I folded into the dark chocolate layer seemed a little too dense/thin, so I added a bit more to that and used the other half for the milk layer. Then whipped up a bit more cream for the white layer. The other thing is that I found it took a long time for the chocolate to melt smoothly after the custard was poured over it. Unlike a ganache where the cream is boiling, this wasn't all that hot somehow and I ended up leaving the chocolate mixtures over simmery water for quite some time.

Got great results and compliments. Had 15 for dinner, so used 10"springform and 1 1/2 recipe amt. Is so rich, though, that almost 1/4 was left. Took advice of prev. reviewers. Used Grand Marnier for dark layer, Kahlua for milk layer, and Chambord for white layer, also used raspberry coulis and dark choc.sauce to dribble on plates, along with raspberries. Had a vegetarian in group, so looked for gelatin substitute, with difficulty. Finally used kosher clear jello, which contains sugar, so decreased amt. of sugar in recipe, but guessed about how much to use, so not sure of amt. of gelling substance. Did set, though. Also used oreo crust recipe. Might try nut crust next time. Lots of dirty dishes, and steps, but easy to make. Need to make a day or two ahead. Tried freezing leftover to see if can make ahead & freeze: white layer was mousse-like, other 2 not, but taste good. A real keeper, but for special occasions.

I have now made this Torte 5 times and it is exceptional. I use a Graham Wafer, Chocolate Wafer Crust and drizzle chocolate over the finished product. I am making this for Christmas Eve dinner and know my husband's family will love it!

Wanted a chocolate crust so I prepared a box brownie mix and used 1/2 the oil needed. Then I spread on cookie sheet baked about 18 minutes and let cool. Will harden somewhat. When cool break up with rolling pin and stick in food processor to crumb. Add 3/4 stick melted butter and press into springform pan. Freeze 30 minutes then make mousse. P.S. Also increased whipped cream added to chocolate. Served on plate decorated with chocolate syrup, sprinkled cocoa powder, set chocolate curls on top of mousse slice and put 2 raspberries on side. Awesome and well worth the trouble and dirty dishes.

I have made this many times and I agree about the cookie crust. My family likes the wafer crust better than the oreo crust. I have a question - has anyone tried to make this in advance and leave it in the freezer for a few days? I am having a party and I am too busy the 2 days before so I wanted to make it in advance. What do you think?

Wow, this torte is to die for! I made it for a birthday party, and everyone raved about it! People were fighting over the last pieces! Like other reviewers, I made a chocolate crust at the bottom of this (it's definitely needed) by combining 1 cup chocolate cookie crumbs, 1/4 cup melted butter, and 1 Tbsp sugar, pressing it onto the bottom, and baking for 15 minutes at 375 degrees. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except in the bittersweet chocolate layer I added some Grand Marnier and in the milk chocolate layer I added some Kahlua. This recipe is delicious and so rich, so you only need a small slice! It is very impressive looking, and I drizzled chocolate sauce on top for a little extra design! A definite keeper! I have people asking me to make it all the time.

This torte was really quite good....like many others, I added a chocolate crust. I also drizzled dark, milk and white chocolate over the top. The only problem I had was that it was too sweet. I would actually omit the extra sugar next time - I think the chocolate on its own has enough sweetness. This is REALLY rich, but makes for lovely presentation.

This was a wonderful dessert and I got rave reviews from my company as well as my hubby! I used good quality chocolate, which makes a huge difference! Many recommended making a crust for the bottom, but I didn't. It was incredible without it and I would not change a thing! The great thing, is that it is not too sweet. Sometimes desserts with chocolate are much too sweet and heavy. This is perfect! I did drizzle milk chocolate (melted in whipping cream) over the top and added fresh berries. Fabulous! I will definitely make it again.

This was quite good, but in the end it was just a three chocolate mousse. As we know, these are sold everywhere! However, this was a nice version and relatively easy to make although it used a lot of dishes. To make it slightly more interesting, I added some Grand Marnier to the bittersweet, dark rum to the milk chocolate, and Framboise to the white chocolate. That provided some uniqueness. As for the bottom, I tried a very bad genoise; perhaps cookie crumbs would be a good move.

Yum! Quick note-- once you add the gelatin to the mixture, it sets quickly! I turned my back to the bowls to prep another dish, and came back to a bit of glutenous blob that I had to WHIP again to save. Still came out great, but I was in a panic for a short time. Make sure to stay "on it" and it should be easier!

Absolutely divine. Intensely delicious! I have made this several times and won't stop there. Definately add a crust of some sort to the bottom. 1/3 of a boxed chocolate cake mix is the easiest and does not take away from the elegance of this beautiful dessert. YUM!

This cake is very tasty, very pretty when decorated and my family was very impressed. Overall, it's a great cake for impressing your family, kids, etc. but as it's basically just an ordinary chocolate mousse torte, it's not the best choice for serving at an occasion where something more original or creative is desired (for example a dinner party with a bunch of NorCal foodies!) I added crust as the other reviewers suggested,used chocolate graham crackers and melted butter as I saw in another recipe. Not the best choice though as the crust was impossible to get off the bottom of the springform pan. Next time I will find a different crust. It was very pretty with the 3 layers of chocolate even though I forgot to freeze them all individually and it was a bit 'wavy'. I added raspberries and bittersweet and white chocolate curls (well, they were more like flakes) which made it look very impressive and the rasberry flavor was nice with the chocolate and made it bit less ordinary. Everyone has been asking me to make it again but I might try to find a cake that would be slightly more interesting in flavor (and perhaps a bit less work!)

I made it for Thanksgiving dessert, it was very rich. My mother couldn't believe that I made it and said I couldn't have a bought a better dessert. I made a chocolate wafer crust which was a very good idea but it needs a raspberry coulis or something to finish it off properly.

This dessert, which is quite labor intensive and uses a pile of dishes, makes a lovely presentation, but lacks flavor. Even using the Oreo crust variation, I found it quite bland, as if by the time the various chocolates were mixed with all the custard and whipped cream, the flavor was just too diluted. I also realized that the use of gelatin adds a vaguely artificial texture to the mousse. I guess it needs the gelatin to be firm enough to stand up in torte form, but it's not a pleasant result.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a hit every time I've made it. It it easy, presents beautifully, goes with everything, and tastes fantastic. I bring this dessert often when I am invited to dinner. I've made it with chocolate chips in a pinch and it did turn out. It was not as wonderful as usual but it was still very good. If you make it with chips add more gelatin to firm it up. If you have not made this dessert, you really should. It takes a little while since you have to wait for the layers to chill but it is very worth the effort.

This cake/torte is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I have never tried a dessert more delicious before in my life. I made it for my boyfriend and he told me it is his favorite dessert ever..he likes it far better than anything from The Cheescake Factory! It's a little time-consuming to prepare, but well-worth it.

This is a great one to impress company! I took it a few steps beyond with the following adjustments: I combined this recipe with the Double Chocolate Torte on this website. Used a 10" springform. Made the cake base using bittersweet chocolate, followed by a layer of semi-sweet mousse (both from above recipe), then a layer each of milk and white chocolate from this recipe. Just dividing in two made the layers a little bigger. Finally, I covered the whole thing in a shiny bittersweet chocolate ganache glaze. I called it the Quadruple Chocolate Mousse Cake, and it was a huge hit at my friend's birthday party! Very rich-only small slices needed. Also, make sure to use a hot knife to do the slicing, or the pieces won't come out as pretty. Yum!

This was excellent. I took it to my mother-in-law's Thanksgiving dinner. Everybody was raving about it. I skipped the bittersweet chocolate layer, instead made a vanilla wafer crust and topped it with the semi-sweet and white chocolate layer, both from Baker's. Will definitely make this again. Next time, I will try the oreo crust as a reviewer suggested and include all three layers of chocolate.

i've made this many times. it was the only dessert on a huge dessert table to be completely gone. looks impressive and tastes good. i've tried graham & choc wafer crusts and prefered the wafer. didn't care for the raspberry version--tastes of fake berry. used espresso granules w/ average-quality choc trying to enhance flavor & color difference between the 2 brown chocolate layers---it can be too subtle to notice. i've also added more custard to the middle choc layer to help w/ color, too. next time, i will try a dense cake-type crust w/ walnuts and since the white choc is too sweet for me, substitute w/ a layer of light vanilla custard, dust w/ cinnamon & cocoa.... so many options on this recipe

This dessert was excellent. I made it for a New Year's Eve dinner party and it was exquisite. I made it in a loaf pan so that the layers really showed off when sliced. I didn't make a crust but served it atop a raspberry coulis with a small garnish of whipped cream and 3 fresh raspberries. I will definitely make it again!

Delicious Almost Disaster! Like the cook from Quebec, I put the mousse between a a split layer of chocolate cake (the cake doctors "Perfect Chocolate Cake" made with coffee instead of water). When I added the hot cream to the eggs, I left the mixer on and turned around to do something else. When I came back it had foamed up so when I put it on the stove I couldn't see what was happening and while I was stirring I suddenly noticed the eggs were scrambling. Salvaged with strainer. Watch those eggs! Added Julia Child's chocolate Glaze to the top cake layer. It was beautiful and both husband and daughter said it was their new favorite "cake". Well worth effort for a really luscious dessert. Used 8" spingform pan. Outstanding.

Great recipe. Here are my suggestions: 1) Definitely make a crust. Any standard chocolate crust from any of the other numerous recipes on epicurious should be fine. I used oreo cookies and butter, bake 10 minutes. You can either make the crust bottom-only or have it come up the sides. I recommend bottom-only. 2) The torte was fairly thin, I echo the other suggestions to use a 8' springform. Or just increase the proportions. I would recommend using 2 cups of whipping cream because the mousse is also fairly heavy as is. 3) Be very careful not to boil the custard or the eggs will solidify; you'd have to start all over or have a lumpy mousse.

I've made this torte several times for several holidays and always get rave reviews. I've also added a thin flourless chocolate cake as a crust and garnished the torte with semisweet, milk and white chocolate curls. It looks so pretty that during the holidays co-workers offer to buy the finished product!

OK, for anyone who has been to LATIF'S Bakery and Cafe in Myrtle Beach, SC, (it is now closed) and has wanted the recipe for Latif's amazing Triple Mocha Mousse Torte, this one comes very, very close. I used an 8 inch springform pan--a must, or else the layers are too thin. I added a walnut crust (3 cups crushed walnuts, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp. salt and 1 cup corn syrup, mixed and spread in springform pan--bake at 375 for 15 minutes and chill for 1 hour before adding the mousse layers). I also added 1/2 cup of freshly brewed espresso to the bittersweet chocolate before I added the custard mixture. There are no words to describe the wonderful taste of this recipe. It is orgasmic! If anyone has the original Latif's recipe, please e-mail it to me. Thanks and enjoy!

I have made this recipe several times. It is light and delicious and loved by all those that ate it. However, the only change I would make is using an 8 inch pan instead of the 9 inch springform pan. I thought the layers were to thin and would prefer a thicker torte.

Rich, fun and easy. Remember not to fold in the cream in too early, wait until the chocolate has cooled sufficiently, otherwise, thicken the mixture with more whip cream. Used the raspberry jello (tiny bit with gelatin) did not overpower the chocolate at all. CRUST IS A MUST. Ground up chocolate oreos with butter to make a nice crust.

I have made this 4x in the last few months and people keep asking me for recipe and can't believe it was homemade! I add a layer of chocolate cake on the bottom and it compliments the mousse amazingly. I used to make the cake from scratch, but find that 1/2 box of Duncan Hines, Devil's Food Chocolate Cake does the trick....saves time and tastes great. I use the other half of the box to make cupcakes for the kids. Let the cake cool completely, before adding the mousse layers. My 'Triple Chocolate Mousse Chocolate Cake', is very similar to the 'Soo Good' Cake from Just Desserts in Canada.

Absolutely love this recipe! I've made it twice and have gotten many compliments both times. My husband actually had me double the recipe the last time to make an extra one just for him....though I saved him the 1000s of calories by also sharing with my family and neighbors. Thanks to those that recommended the cookie crust. I used a simple mixture of chocolate graham crackers and butter and baked at a low temp for several minutes. This will become a family staple as I've already had several requests to make this for our Christmas party.

Very rich dessert. Needs something else like a crust or sauce with it for presentation. I made a dark chocolate sauce. I spooned some of that on the plate and set a slice of the torte on top of it. Also, using bittersweet chocolate is a good idea for as much differentiation between the layers as possible.
