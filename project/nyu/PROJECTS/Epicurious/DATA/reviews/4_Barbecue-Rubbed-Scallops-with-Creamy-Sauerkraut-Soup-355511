Wow wow wow. First off, this recipe is definitely worth the time!(35ish minutes) and the recipe's flow is easy. I eat scallops almost monthly at posh Las Vegas restaurants. I subbed lemon pepper for the sumac and rinsed the sauerkraut, but I otherwise cooked it as written. I even forgot to salt the soup... Bc I was so ecstatic over its awesomeness! Next time, I'll use sumac as instructed and tons of baby arugula (more than I used today).

I love this soup! the only change was to add some garlic. I rinsed the sauerkraut per reviews. The only observation is abou the scallop. Although it was delicious, it was not necessary. I will omit scallops next time.

Delicious dish and doesn't take too long. The 2nd time I made it, I switched the bacon for turkey bacon and reduced to 1 Tbsp butter for a slightly healthier version, it was just as good. The color wasn't as creamy white since we had more meat than fat, but it didn't bother me.

I am dumbfounded by how good this proved to be. Prepared as the second course of a lavish multi-course meal simply because it sounded so unusual. It was the winner of he night. I rinsed the sauerkraut as recommended by others. The biggest issue you'll have is the marketing of "sauerkraut soup"...don't be turned off!

Excellent, even for those who say they do not like sauerkraut. For lactose intolerant, can substitute soy milk for cream (use 1/2 cup) and unflavored soy yoghurt for the sour cream. MArgarine works ok in replacing butter. I also used 2 strips of lean bacon instead of one piece.

Made twice. Loved it both times. 2nd time the scallops were improved by using a smaller amount of rub, helping it stick to the scallop, virtually 100%. I was surprised the medium-low heat actually worked well - usuallly cook scallops at a very high heat. Thank you to everyone who recommended rinsing the sauerkraut. I rinsed it very thoroughly and the sauerkraut flavor, which I like, was subdued and in the background, a well balanced effect. We found this delicious because it is so different and the contrast between the soup and scallops is pleasing. Served this with a Paso Robles Viognier- Roussanne blend (Curtis Heritage Blanc, great value wine) -- excellent pairing. Final comment: definitely use the bacon slice with the onions - it adds a nice savory-deep flavor as a base for the soup.

I've made this recipe twice, and both times it was WAY too salty. I thought it still tasted somewhat good as a dip for the scallops but my husband didn't even agree with me there. I might try it again with the instructions suggested by FernBar, but I doubt it.

The first time I made this, the soup was *way* too salty. I made it again following the directions in _Mastering the Art of French Cooking_ for rinsing sauerkraut: Put the sauerkraut in a deep bowl and cover with cold water. Change the water three times---every five minutes. Drain the sauerkraut when it tastes as salty as you want it. This is a tasty and unusual soup. I think it might be a good starter for Thanksgiving because sauerkraut is delicious with turkey.

This was so amazing and easy to make. Didn't taste like sauerkraut but a wonderful soup and the scallops were the perfect accompaniment. I am keeping this for future dinners. I didn't use the arugula but did drizzle the oil.

This was really delicious, and different. If you are looking for a different way to prepare scallops and you like saurkraut (a must) then try this recipe. I did not have Sumac, but substituted lemon grass and it was great. Also, the temperature was too low for the scallops, so I turned the heat up to medium. I left out the arugula, but the dish didn't seem to need it. I will definately make this again, although I might make less soup, as you could use it more as a "pool" of soup surrounding the scallops. I would also make this soup again but add grilled keilbasa instead of scallops in the winter.
