Nothing special... Would possibly make it again but with a different blend of spices.

I got rave reviews with this one.

This is so good two people asked for the recipe the first time I served it and one is a non-cook. It does not have to sit as long as the recipe clls for - a day was fine.

I made this on 20 March and served it yesterday (just short of 3 weeks later). While the flavor was delicious, the goat cheese did not maintain it's shape and was not necessarily the best looking appetizer.... My friends enjoyed it though, so I will probably make it again and not wait quite so long to serve it! Served with crostini I brushed with garlic infused oil and toasted in the oven. KIMBER

This is one of my "keeper" recipes from Gourmet. I have made it innumerable times and get raves about it each time.
