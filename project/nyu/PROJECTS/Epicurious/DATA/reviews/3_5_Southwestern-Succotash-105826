I have been making a variation of this for years so was good to see this here. I use just the water or broth used to par boil the lima beans, then add froz or fresh sweet corn kernels, then add fresh roasated or canned chiles (whatever variety you like or have on hand), minced garlic, green onions, a little cumin if you like that flavor, S&P, cilantro and grated cheese (again...crumbled queso mexican, cheddar,whatever you have) and pop in the oven to bring it all together and warm through while the rest of the meal is being prepared. Can skip the cream or add a few TBS for creamy consistency but the cheese will do it too. Yummmmm

I only tried this because I had an antique bag of edamame that I found in the freezer & a big group of family to feed unexpectedly & I had all the other ingredients so it seemed perfect! WOW I'm so glad I made this, it's delicious. I've made it over and over. I like it with the lima beans for a creamier result but still use the edamame when I can't get limas. It's perfect in the summer with fresh corn too. People go crazy over it! It is great as a base for grilled fish for a dinner and works as well for 4th of July & other casual entertaining.

interesting flavors, however, as many have said: way too much liquid. It surprises me that Bon Appetit printed a recipe with such a flaw, as they're usually so good.

First made this dish for a succotash lover in 2001, and have made it every year since. It's become a new tradition for me and people ask and remember it now. Just don't use and much broth (mayber 1/2 a can), and skip the cream altogether--you don't need it and it only makes the finished dish look muddy.

This recipe is fabulous. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the broth and cream. I halved this recipe for two of us and actually used one cup of water, two bouillon cubes, and a third cup if fat free half and half. We had this with the Enchilda Casserole recipe from allrecipes.com and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Only problem was the liquid -- too much. But this was fantastic! And I made it a day and a half in advance before serving for Thanksgiving. My husband loved it and that's saying a lot. I put in less cream than called for, next time I'll put in less broth as well.

I made this for a Southwestern theme dinner. I followed the suggestions of others to cut the amount of liquid - I used 1/2 cup cream and 8 ounces water, skipping the chicken broth because I wanted to make a dish that would serve as a main dish for vegetarians and a side dish for meat-eaters.

This is an excellent vegetable dish. Even people who don't ordinarily eat lima beans raved about it.

This recipe had far too much liquid. We would have liked it better if I had cut down on the liquid and served it immediately. However, I made it the day before and reheated (as suggested in the magazine version of the recipe), which made the vegetables much less colorful and flavorful. This was so-so at best--would not repeat.

When my friend started to prepare this dish, I thought YUK! Well, it turned out to be just great and contributed to one of the best Thanksgiving dinners I have ever had! Bon Appetit had some wonderful recipes! Thanks

We served this dish at Thanksgiving dinner (along with several others from the November issue), and found it excellent. It is beautiful, easy, and very tasty! For those who hold back from chilis, I suggest splitting the recipe to provide one dish without the peppers for the less adventurous and another of the real thing!

This dish was absolutely delicious. Even those who said that they detested lima beans, loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Had no problem with it being mushy or spicy. I used pasillas for the chilies. My only change would be to reduce the amount of liquid by a third. I may add a hotter pepper depending on the guests.

I refused to eat this because I detest bell peppers, but my husband and his family loved it.

I agree that you should cut the liquid by at least one-half. I also used fewer of the lima beans. I also used three chiles, instead of two. I also used some green onions for garnish, in addition to the fresh cilantro.

A nicely spicy twist on an old favorite. I do not agree with one of the last steps, though. The recipe calls for a whole can of chicken broth near the end. My succotash quickly became soup when I added the broth and cream. I had to drain most of it off. Maybe add less broth and/or cream.
