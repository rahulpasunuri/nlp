I have made this several times - love the flavours. Only problem I have had is the plain batter too thick to drizzle nicely, so I just keep a small amount of the plain batter for the final layer and thin it a bit with milk if necessary. It looks beautiful too! I have also made this substituting coconut for the pecans, which is also good. I suspect the matter of the overbaked crust would depend on the type of gingersnaps you use. I use 12 PC Stem Ginger Cookies which have wonderful ginger flavour.

in 2005, I searched Epicurious for a sweet potato dish that was unique. Search terms where "Thanksgiving,"sides,"vegetables," and the key word was "sweet potato." I made it as a side! My family now requests this every year! So our family tradition is to sneak a little dessert in early. Happy Holidays!

Although the flavors in the cheesecake were excellent, definitely agree that pre-baking the crust makes it nearly burnt. The cheesecake is also a little dense for me.

I made this dish for the first time last Thanksgiving and it was a complete success. I also had planned on using a graham cracker crust, but then discovered that one my guests had recently been diagnosed with a wheat allergy, so I had to improvise. I ended up using chopped pecans, brown sugar, a touch of cinnamon and butter and baked it until carmelized. It really complimented the flavors well and I will continue to make it this way even though that guest will not be returning.

This is a well like recipe among the family. I made this for the first time Thanksgiving '02 and the family is asking for it T'03. I did not use the gingersnap crust because I do not like gingersnap overwhelming flavor. I used graham cracker crust instead. I squeezed orange juice in the filling for added flavor. This dessert is not too thick like most cheese cakes, it is very light. I will be making extras to give away and freeze for a later day.

I served this with a cinnamon cream anglaise sauce and followed the recipe exactly. Being a chocolate dessert person, I couldn't believe how perfect it was! Delicious! Would make again for a fall dinner party.

I took this recipe and altered the crust I use Grahm Crackers crushed up with some brown sugar mixed in. I didn't measure it.. just kind of did it by sight and increased the melted butter. The crust was out of this world good.. Who ever heard of gingersnap cook crust yuk! And I didn't try to marbleb it just mixed it all toghther and it was awesome good..with some whipped cream srapyed on top.. My co-workers loved it and ask for it again.. Lot of work but well worth it. P.S. I also used real sweet potatoes and boiled them till soft. Try it.. i'l telling you it's scrumpious!!

This is definitely a cheesecake for those who don't like a thick, heavy cheesecake. I love the flavors - very subtle but rich. I agree with the chef that the crust does tend to get overdone if you pre-bake it. Also found that the cheesecake generally cooked in about 35-38 minutes, vs. the 45 minutes in the recipe.

I was dissappointed with this recipe. I felt the flavor of the sweet potatoes was overpowered by the gingersnap crust. I also felt the light cream cheese and no sour cream gave this cheesecake a bland flavor. I like thick, heavier cheesecakes and this recipe certainly did not provide that.

I have been making this cheesecake for a year and have NEVER come across ONE person who didn't like it. I find that baking the crust by itself for 8 minutes causes it to be a little too well done for my taste, so I skip this step.

Love this cheesecake, every thanksgiving I make this cake, no one eats the pumpkin pie. I lost the recipe and I'm so happy I can get the recipe online.

Very creamy and light! I liked that it used only a couple packs of cream cheese, rather than 4 so it was not as heavy as others. I'd absolutely make it again. Many have asked for the recipie since I made it. I used a classic graham cracker butter crust tho. I like that best usually!

i made this as a birthday cake for a friend with a sweet tooth -who also likes to eat low fat- so - this was a real success. the flavors were so rich and yet subtle. best eaten at room temp - cold is not as good. not hard to make either.
