This frosting is fantastic! It's very dense and delicious, and not as tangy as I thought it'd be. I used a full 12 ounce bag of semisweet chips and I did have to add about 1/4 cup of milk at the end to smooth it out. It was perfect. Yum!!

Additionally, I did not have a problem with consistency/graininess but all my ingredients were at room temperature and I believe that makes a difference.

I made this recipe as listed but added another 1/4 cup of powdered sugar. Reviews were rave and I was told several times that this recipe was a keeper. It is a little too rich for my personal taste but still really good and flavorful.

Love this recipe. It is firm enough to use in the summer. To remedy grainy appearance, I beat in a little of the hot water I used to melt chocalate right at the end.

I added an extra 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and it was perfect..without it the frosting was still good but had more of the cream cheese flavor to it. I prefer it a bit sweeter.

I'm a frosting fanatic and thought this one was amazing. Very easy to make and absolutely delicious! I baked Magnolia Bakery vanilla cupcakes and frosted them with this frosting. Amazing!

Very goo, and creamy. I used good quality milk chocolate instead of the semi-sweet, then only added 1 and 1/2 cup's sugar. This is my families new chocolate frosting recipe.

I used 70% cocoa dark chocolate and only 1/4 c of cream cheese and thinned with just a tablespoon or two of non-fat milk. This is what I will use on all of my cupcakes from now on! Yum!

After reading the reviews, I was concerned about too sour a taste so I made the following modifications. Increased the chocolate and butter by 50%, doubled the vanilla, added 1/4 cup sugar (sifted), added 2 tablespoons cream. The result was rich-tasting and not overly sweet. Very easy to make.

I did not like the flavor of this frosting and I ended up having to add about 2-3 tablespoons of skim milk. Once I did the texture was perfect but the cream cheese made the frosting too sour tasting. Not for me.

I have never had an icing turn out as well as this one. The secret is keeping everything at room temperature. Thanks to everyone else's reviews. Highly recommend! Cream cheese flavour was subtle and enjoyable.

Although easy to make (I used the microwave to melt the chocolate and butter), the end result was smooth but off-tasting. I can't explain it, but this frosting tastes like there is an ingredient missing, even though I included everything in the recipe - almost a hollow flavor. The cream cheese and chocolate, although usually great in a chocolate cheesecake, is strangely tangy and rather off-putting here. Perhaps sour cream would have been better, and would have had a better flavor. It didn't ruin the cake, the texture is divine (not grainy due to sifting the powdered sugar)but I will look for another recipe next time.

I found that actually mixing this recipe by hand gives it the olde home essence that is lacking in the electric mixer methods. This frosting is fabulous in every aspect!

I just wanted to add that I used all organic ingredients (I have found that to add a much cleaner flavor to all my cooking/baking). Also, I used a hand-held mixer and the frosting was not grainy - it was as smooth as could be. Piping the frosting onto cupcakes worked wonderfully. One more thing - the cream cheese is quite evident, but perfectly so, to my taste.

This recipe is fabulous. Just make sure to sift the powdered sugar. If executed well, the texture and taste are exceptional.

This frosting tasted ok, but looked unappealing (it looked grainy even though it had a smooth texture). I also didn't like the way it handled while spreading it onto cupcakes. There are much better frostings-- don't waste your time on this one.

Did a little embellishment, added 1 stick of butter, and added powdered sugar to achieve a good consistency. "Fluffed" the frosting by making it with the wisk attachment on my electric mixer

This recipe was exceptional. The consistency of the frosting was fabulous and everyone we served this to could not get enough! We will definitely make this again!

I made this for a church function and iced cakes that fed over 100 people. They all raved about the frosting. Some saying it was the best they had eaten. I will make this again for sure.

I thought this icing was okay. I agree, the cream cheese flavor would be masked by a little more sugar and/or more chocolate. Not bad, but not the best...

A good icing if you like the thought of 'chocolate cream cheese'! Very creamy and not too sweet, but not to my liking at all. I found that the cream cheese and chocolate flavours did not mix well (for me anyway--my husband thought it was fine) I will not make it again. Guess I'm just a buttercream kinda girl!

This was such a nice creamy frosting! It could even make a bad cake good! Excellent as is.

Rating: 4
Using the other reivews as a benchmark, I added 3 oz. more semi-sweet chocolate and 1/8 cup more sugar to lose the cream cheese flavor. It was not strong enough with the recipe as written but this makes a perfect match to any non-chocolate cake recipe and an equal compliment to any number of the Bon Appetit chocolate cake recipes. Highly recommend this recipe!!!

best chocolate frosting by far - excellent!

I used a Betty Crocker Devil's Food cake mix, put seedless black raspberry preserves between the layers, and used this frosting. It wasn't quite as pretty as I had hoped, but two people said it was the best cake they ever ate. As far as I'm concerned, that's what counts.

I thought this frosting was excellent. It was sweet without being too sweet (the cream cheese helps with this). I also thought that the frosting was grainy when I first made it, but if you continue to mixed it, it becomes smoother. Either way, this is a very creamy, delicious frosting and a great topping to a moist chocolate cake.

Actually, I didn't dislike this frosting, but the taste of cream cheese was way too prominent, I thought. I might make it again, but it certainly won't be replacing my regular chocolate buttercream recipe. And I agree with what other reviewers have said about the appearance of the frosting seeming to be quite grainy, but then upon tasting, the texture was very smooth and creamy.

Whoah, this was excellent! Exceptionally creamy, almost like a buttercream! It looked a little grainy, but after tasting it was so creamy, I couldn't believe it, and delish too. I halved it, because I realized I hardly had any chocolate, so I was kind of flying by the seat of my pants. I added a little milk at the end to make it more spreadable. Thrilled with results for son's cupcakes, this will be my standard chocolate frosting from now on.

Very good frosting. Creamy and chocolatey without being too sweet. And very easy to make, too! I'd definitely make this again.

My son wanted cupcakes and I didn't have any frosting on hand. This recipe was exceptionally easy. I didn't have cream cheese so after mixing the chocolate with the powder sugar, I slowly added milk, till I reached a creamy consistency. It turned out perfect. The frosting stayed shiny even after is dried.

Foolproof easy - I added another 2 oz. of cream cheese and found the sweetness perfect. Wouldn't change another thing!

Easy to make but a little too sweet.
