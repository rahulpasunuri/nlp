I made this recipe but for some reason when I went shopping I bought canned beans. I used them anyway and did not salt anything. This made the recipe easier. I too probably would add a few spices to the sauce or the cakes. My husband does not like sour cream but liked the sauce with the jalapeno. Thought it was intresting and would be great with any Mexican/Spanish type dish. I would be willing to make this again

This dish was delicious, and pretty simple! First, I should admit that I followed the ingredient list, but not the amounts. And, I didn't puree the peas but just pulsed them in the food processor so they kept some texture (same with the onion). I decreased the amount of flour, upped the amount of onion and lime juice, and added some ancho chile powder for depth and heat. I think hand-mixing the ingredients made a big difference- kept the mixture from becoming pasty. I used ancho chile powder in the sour cream too, instead of jalapenos. I served the cakes for a light summer dinner with a spinach salad on the side, and got rave reviews. Would probably work well with canned garbanzos or other similar peas or beans, for a faster version.

Took way too much effort for not that great of a dish. I wouldn't suggest it unless you just have to have a recipe using black-eyed peas. If you do make it, follow the suggestions of the other review that suggest adding more salt, peppers/hot sauce, and lime to add some flavor.

This recipie was too detailed and the results were not what we had expected. The cakes were too bland(even after we added more salt to the batter). We added more jalapeno to the sour cream than the recipe called for and a sqeeze or two of lime might have given it a zestier flavor.

Every New Year's Day I try and serve family, friends and houseguests a different Black-Eyed Pea recipe, but I think my search is over. This one is easy, tastes wonderful, and got rave reviews. The folks who were here this year have been put on notice: they'll get it again on January 1, 2001. Meanwhile, I'll plan on at least a couple of Black-Eyed Pea Cake breakfasts between now and then.
