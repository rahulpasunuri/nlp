Caught our first halibut of the season - 34 inches. Added lemon juice and skipped the frying step. Served with succotash salad and rice - very nice!

This dish did not sound appetizing, but I had left over cabbage in my fridge, and I also happened to have halibut. Tried it, and it is very flavorful and I am definately making it again. The cabbage was moist, and the fish, with the capers was well seasoned. I followed what another reviewer said, which was to make sure the butter/caper spread was on top when cooking.

An interesting way to serve either cod or halibut. I julienned carrots, peppers and zucchini which I put on top of the fish along with the caper butter. Lovely and simple.

Fantastic, easy dinner. We used cod fillets with great success. I would back off on the salt a teeny bit next time, but overall, this was wonderful. A keeper.

Easy and delicious recipe ! I used salmon instead and put about 2 teaspoons of caper butter per packet. Sauteed in the pan with a small amount of butter and olive oil after reading the other reviews.This would be a great party or "company" dish since it has such an elegant presentation.

This was very good but I would try and do the sauce at the end in the skillet I browned the fish in instead of the baking pan

I thought this was great; the cabbage really added something to the otherwise bland fish, and the combination of flavors was wonderful. My husband, on the other hand, found the capers overwhelming, and if we make it again, we'll probably cut down on those. One confusing thing is how you're supposed to serve the fish--is it in the packets, or out? We compromised by opening the packets slightly to drizzle the sauce on, but discovered that the cooked cabbage adds so much to the flavor that you can probably just drizzle the sauce over the closed packets and have a prettier presentation.

Sorry. . . . . should read I substituted olive oil for butter.

We too enjoyed this dish very much. I also needed to keep this dairy free so I substituted butter for olive oil. The fish was moist and full of flavor. I will definitely be making this recipe in the future.

Wonderful recipe! I used green cabbage instead of savoy cabbage and it was still great. In fact, the bite of the green cabbage (as opposed to how I imagine the more refined savoy variety would taste) was a nice contrast to the brown butter. Don't worry if your cabbage wraps have small tears in them; the fish cooks perfectly whether the wraps are sealed or not. I will definitely make this one again.

I wanted this dish to be dairy-free, but I wanted to keep the creaminess of the butter, so I used coconut cream instead -- delicious! The consistency was perfect, almost mayonaise-y, and I added mint as well to match the mild tropical coconut flavor. Also, I used red snapper instead and just baked the cabbage rolls to save myself the extra step.

I made this with haddock instead of halibut, and it was fantastic.

This was so yummy. And fortunately it did NOT need an entire stick of butter. I cooked the cabbage packets on the stove as instructed (using a butter/olive oil mix so that the butter wouldn't burn). After the cabbage was browned on both sides, I put the entire pan into the oven. Once the fish was done, I plated it and poured the pan drippings over some orzo I had cooked. I could have made the sauce to pour over the fish, but the fish didn't need any more butter. Served with broccoli that I had roasting in the oven with the fish (on the rack below...not mixed).
