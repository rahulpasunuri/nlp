Actually, I hate to give this one fork since it deserves none...when I saw the frozen potatoes, that should've been the giveaway to not make it. Tasted very artificial. I thought this would be an easy alternative to "real" corn chowder, but it wasn't. Make the real thing with real (not canned) corn and potatoes (not frozen hash browns). Yucky, yucky, yucky...and not healthy.

Won't even give this one fork...not okay. Too much processed food with the canned corn and the frozen hash browns...I'll make corn chowder from scratch the next time.

Okay, so I'm doing the thing where the reviewer completely changes the recipe, and then comments on their brilliance. Here goes: I sauteed bacon, diced sweet onion, thyme, a bit of crushed red pepper until onion was translucent. Added in some diced red bell pepper and sauteed a little longer. Then deglazed the pan with the creamed corn, added 1 cup chicken stock, some crushed dried rosemary. Finally, to thicken I used some garlic mashed potato instant potatoes I had laying around, probably no more than 1/4 cup in total, until it was a nice, chowdery consistency. This has very very little to do with the original recipe, but I was inspired by the creamed corn idea, and it turned out just as delicious as I had hoped! I gave it 3 forks, because I anticipate the recipe as printed would have been a little bland.

Not something I would make again - even canned soups taste better. I'll stick to corn chowder from scratch from now on.

This was a nice, hearty and easy dinner to make. I did make a few changes. I first fried the bacon until crisp, I removed and crumbled it and placed it to the side. I drained the pot of the drippings. I then added 1 tbsp of butter and sauteed one onion chopped until tender. Then I followed it the remaining part of the recipe. I also added some thyme and pepper. It was a nice quick soup that pleased.

As I wrote earlier, I've now made this recipe again and again. My husband and I never tire of it. I wanted to let everyone know that although the recipe specifically says not to use lowfat or skim milk, I've made it with both and it comes out perfectly fine. Am still making it with smoked turkey too. Yum!

This soup was not only EZ but delicious as well! I too made a few changes, but for the better. I rendered 6 slices of bacon, sauteed the onions in the bacon fat then added 2 cans of corn, 2 c. milk, 1 c. Heavy Cream. garnished with red pepper, g. onion, crumbled bacon and crab fritters! This was so tasty, My only wish was that I didnt make MORE! I will definitly revert back to this recipe over and over again!

This recipe is so good and so fast! I added an additional 11 oz can of whole kernel corn, only 1 1/2 C milk, and 4 oz of sharp cheddar. We LOVED it!!

This is a great basic recipe for corn chowder. What I did differently: sauteed the bacon and then sweated out the onions in 2 tbsps of the bacon fat for an extra layer of flavour. Definitely needed more milk for this..at least 1/3 more and used lots more potatoes - almost double. Also, instead of the canned niblets suggested I bought peaches and cream corn on the cob instead..

My husband and I loved this. I added an extra can of niblets, and several more potatoes, and one more stalk of green onion. I also added a whole package of precooked bacon chopped , since my husband loves bacon. We also topped it of with crushed mixed peppercorn, which was very tasty!

Yum, what a delicious, simple, easy recipe! I followed it exactly except I used smoked turkey instead of bacon cuz my hubbie doesn't eat red meat. He loved it. It was even better the 2nd day. I will definitely make this again and again.

Yum. This recipe is a good base to work from, you can add and subsititute a lot without too much trouble.I doubled the amount of cream corn suggested and added 2 soup cans of 2 per cent milk. Also added a full can of niblets. Used a yellow onion instead of green onion, substituted ham instead of bacon. Don't forget to add a tablespoon or dried thyme. Threw in some potato cubes and simmered for about an hour. Came out super chunky and delicious!

This is a good, basic recipe but it is enhanced by the following- Add: 1 - 12/14 oz. can corn niblets Substitute 1 can evaporated milk for regular milk 4/5 strips of red pepper , then sautee in veg oil with onions This is very thick, so 1 cup of water is needed, then simmer.

This is a delicious, easy recipe. I doubled the recipe, and I did add extra cream style corn and more bacon. Everyone raved. They couldn't believe how simple the recipe is. Serve with hot corn bread!

A good easy and quick recipe. I modified it to use up leftover spagetti squash instead of putting in the hash browns. I see infinite variations. A great basic recipe.
