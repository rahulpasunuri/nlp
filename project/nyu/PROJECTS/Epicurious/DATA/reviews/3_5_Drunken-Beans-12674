Borracho beans are a family favorite. I add cumino during the cooking - about a tablespoon - I also drain off most of the bacon drippings. A real must - add chopped cilantro just before serving.

Thank goodness for this website's archive of recipes. This was a favorite of mine from many years ago. My splattered copy from the magazine disappeared but here it is for my enjoyment! Thanks Gormet!

I used black beans instead of pinto beans since I like them better. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. They are delicous. They have a wonderful well rounded flavor.

This is very similar recipe to a friends mom of mine. It is close to authentic the difference is they do not always use beer and no jalapenos or oregano. instead they cook the bacon,some diced tomatoes,cilantro,di ced green onions,and garlic together. They add it in after the beans have already began to soften. They add plenty of salt to the beans as well. They are to die for. Don't forget to use regular pepper as well.

I seriously cheated and used canned pintos, country ham pieces, and Michelob Porter, because this is what I had on hand. I simmered on the stove top for a couple of hours. They were still great, I cant wait to try this recipe as written. I made these beans to go with leftover Short Ribs Braised in Coffee Ancho Chili Sauce (a recipe from this site) that I made into carnitas, It was a great meal that did not have the leftover or canned vibe.

I couldn't bring myself to leave all that bacon grease in, so I drained it off. Otherwise I followed the recipe, which I found quite ordinary and bland.

I must preface this with I don't like beans. However, this dish is amazing. Served as part of an experimental dinner, and all the guests loved it. Modified it by adding only a quart of water (even then I had to reduce on the stove). Also ended up putting in more jalapenos. Quite zippy, lot of kick on the back end. Just wonderful.

I have a similar recipe pased down from my parents. and its just as good. I have made this with a meatier bacon. and also with cut up hot dogs. The idea behind this dish is to be served after a night of partying and celebration, so any kind of meat would do the trick so use your imagination.

DO NOT USE 1 and 1/2 QUARTS WATER. You will only make a mess. This is a typical "restaurant" recipe; they are not very exact with measurements. I used 2 cups of water. Made it in my bean pot, which is the best for deciding if more water is needed. Defintely more garlic. I used ham hocks as I know that our bacon is nothing you would ever find in Mexico. If you can tell the difference between regular oregano and Mexican oregano in this, you're a lot more exacting than I am.

I usually add chipotle peppers to my beans, but even in Austin, Texas, I couldn't find any at a local market. So I bought a tiny can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I added two spanish chorizo sausages, and a little cumin. We'll see how it turns out. TWO WEEKS LATER: It was great. 4 serrano peppers plus the small can of smoked chipotles was plenty hot (surprisingly) and plenty tasty. Place this on your 'heavy rotation' list.

These beans were great and will become a family staple. I did not have an ovenproof kettle so simmered them on the stove for many hours. I think next time I will use hamhocks or meatier bacon, and substitute the pickled/jarred jalepenos for the canned ones and use some of the juice as a previous reviewer suggested. I didn't take the time to get the mexican oregano so just used regular, and it seemed to work out ok. This complemented a delicious meal of the Mexican Poblano Lasagne also found on epicurious.com, and enchiladas. Great mexican meal!

I've made this recipe twice. I had such a craving for beans that although I didn't find this particular recipe very appealing and I have absolutely no access to Mexican dark beer or Mexican oregano I still couldn't resist giving it a try. So...I substituted Dutch dark beer for Mexican and regular oregano for Mexican. I soaked the beans overnight, followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. I tasted the broth about 1 1/2 hrs. later and almost threw it out on the spot but my stubborness prevailed and I finished the cooking time and then some, and then some and then some more because the beans were still hard. Evidently I had gotten ahold of some really old beans or a bad brand that refused to soften properly but the flavor was terrific. Second try was done with the same substitutions and the results were really delicious. I read the other reviews and now I wonder if cilantro is a closer substitution for Mexican oregano than regular oregano? Will give it a try. But we really loved these beans and I'll definitely make them again. We like lots of liquid with beans so this was perfect.

Not bad beans at all, but it did have its challenges. Having said that they were devoured by the group of twelve for whom I made it. Again, I had probems with the liquid. I solved that by beginning the beans the night before in a 350 degree oven for a couple/few hours. Refrigerated them overnight, then put them back in a "slow" oven (275-300 or so) for the entire afternoon. Watch out for the chicken broth suggestion. I'd be sure to use low sodium or cut the broth with water. Otherwise, the beans get really salty. (Which is what happened to mine. Lack of thinking on my part.) To offset the salt, I added Montery Jack cheese. Also thought it would appeal to the crowd to whom I was serving the dish. (Did a fantastic Mexican grill with mesquite grilled chuck steak, pico, roasted chile/roasted tomato salsa from Fine Cooking 09/01 and received complaints about lack of sour cream. Pearls before swine.....)

I've made this many times - I make it without bacon and just put all the ingredients in a slowcooker. I always add juice from the jalapeno peppers and some extra garlic. These make excellent bean burritos.

After reading many good reviews I couldn't wait to make these beans. I was very disappointed! The beans were bland, not much taste at all. This reciped is definitely not a keeper.

I made this for a mexican dinner party and people kept asking who made the beans. I added the juice from the jalapeno's and some mexican seasoning in addition to the mexican basil to spice it up a bit. I will definately make this again. It was a good crowd pleaser.

I made this for our annual 4th of July party now celebrated across the pond in England. My husband's family does not like spicey foods, so I had to change it a bit, but, it was a huge success and I still liked it. I added two cans of chopped tomatoes and a half a pound of browned ground beef, less water and lots of cilantro. They've asked me to bring it to the next BBQ!

This was a great recipe. I used 1 1/2 beers as suggested and added juice from the can of pickled jalepenos for a little extra kick. I soaked the beans over night and cooked them for 2 1/2 hours. I agree that the amount of water was off and will start out with about half as much water next time and slowly add more as needed. Although these beans are very tasty, they may not look too pretty when done. I topped with jack cheese and sour cream for presentation.

I made this for the first time last night for a dinner party and it was a hit. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used chicken broth rather than water (slightly less than the receipe called for), increased the beer to 1-1/2, and substituted cilantro for the mexican oregano. To lessen the liquid on the plate I served it with a slotted spoon, but next time I will serve it over rice and use the liquid.

I didn't find the beans to have much flavor, though I did use them the next day in burritos and they were better. I was hoping for more flavor.

This was excellent. We used cilantro instead of 'Mexican Oregano'. Cooked them in the crockpot all day and they came out perfect. We served them with Cheese melted in Tortillas and it makes a meal.

Ole! Don't change a thing and you will enjoy these beans! They will go nicely with any dry "rubbed" brisket, chicken or pork that can accomodate this soupy bean dish. It's nice to have something different than the run-of-the-mill accompaniments... Just loved it and will make it again! KIMBER

Great dish. I cut down on the water, used fresh peppers (seeded) & baked for 3 hours. Great left over.

These were just the beans I was looking for to serve with my Texas brisket. Although no expert, they looked and tasted very "authentic," and not at all like baked beans. I believe the water amount is wrong. I soaked my beans overnight, probably added 1.5 beers, and maybe a cup or two of water, and still had way too much liquid. The pickled jalapenos are required! Next time will serve with a little grated white mexican cheese (cojita?) on top.

This is a delicious side dish for a Mexican feast. With the leftovers, I've been adding the pico de gallo from the swordfish taco recipe and the grated feta from the corn on the cob with cheese & lime recipe and it's terrific!

I have made these beans about 10 times now, and keep playing with the recipe and it's just as good written. It is NOT good with Black Beans. I serve it over a lime rice, with cilatro and it really is to die for. It made a great cooking class at the Garlic Press in Normal, IL! It has become a good addition to many great southwestern dishes from Reed Hearon.

add extra salt (1-2 tsp) and they're awesome! maybe next time i'll vary by adding a ham hock or more spices. the broth was great and the perfect consistency.

this recipe has a great flavor. it was a little bland so i used some salt at the end. the jalapenos made a great spice to the beans. some of my family who don't like spicy food said it a little hot for them, so you may want to add the peppers a little at a time.

This is the first recipe from EP.com that I would not make again. I will use the same ingredients next time but maybe add chicken stock instead of water for more flavor. These beans were watery and lacking pazazz.
