I made two single batches of this - one with the extra egg, one without. I also lowered the temperature in the first, and raised it in the second. My results? Adding another egg white makes the cookie "spread" more. If you want the most bang for your coconut - stick with the original egg whites. Also, 350 degrees does not burn the coconut...I found 325 was too low and didn't brown them quick enough - The only thing I changed was substituting the vanilla flavoring for half 'n half vanilla and almond extract because I like it. Cook til not only the tips of the coconut are browned, but the whole surface is a golden color.

This is a great dessert for Passover and/or for coconut lovers. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used the entire can of sweetened condensed milk as well as one more egg white. I also added 1/4 c of ground flax seed. I did not grease the parchment paper and all was fine. Instead of melting the chocolate, I folded about 4 oz. of semi-sweet chips into the coconut mixture. The macaroons were a big hit and everyone is asking for the recipe.

My husband says its the best cookie ever! I will agree. I used almonds instead of mac-nuts because I had them. I skipped melting the chocolate and added chocolate chips after the cookies came out of the oven. thanks!

You clearly need to love coconut:) A good basic recipe. I am a very elementry baker and they turned out very good. Only hiccup I had was melting chocolate but I figured it out and dipped the bottoms rather than the drizzle some suggested. I think either way would be fine. Good recipe for coconut and macadamia lovers.

Must have done something wrong as these were awful-and I bake a lot-double the egg whites and still think it wasn't enough-ingredients were good just didn't work for me

These cookies are truly amazing. I had no idea they would be so easy and smell so delish coming out of the oven. I did bake them for only 10 min but they were perfectly browned. These are the best new cookie recipe I've tried in a long time!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! People cannot stop raving about these macaroons- even quite a few people who said they have never liked macaroons. I have had special requests to make these again. They are a very big hit!

I also add a couple of extra egg whites and just drizzle the chocolate over the top. It's like a "Macadamia Joy" candy bar.

Have made this many, many times but have scaled the recipe up to use a full can of condensed milk, use a scoop to get nicely rounded cookies but prefer salted macadamias for a more complex flavor.

These are great! I have made them many times and people can't get enough of them... so I always make it as a double recipe (which then uses the whole can of sweetened condensed milk instead of wasting any!). I do find it works better with extra whites (6 for a double recipe). I also add a small amount of chocolate chips. They freeze well... but are always disappearing from my freezer!

I agree with the reviewer who compared the cookies to a Mounds candy bar. Delicious and chewy but very rich cookies. Next time I will not dip the cookies in chocolate (used Ghiradelli bittersweet), instead I will drizzle chocolate over tops of cookies. I also used salted macadamia nuts as I could not find unsalted--did not appear to affect the cookie.

fail safe recipe.. friends actually request them now! i generally double the recipe and when doing so slightly more than double the egg whites. also once you make and put the macaroons in the fridge (on wax paper) at least 2 hours, remove and dip the bottoms in bittersweet chocolate using the melting technique for island macaroons on this site. also have made w/o nuts (and sometimes subing in almonds). works just fine w/ coconut and chocolate.

Thanks the the reviewer who suggested a greased ice cream scoop to form the cookies: that was just the ticket. I omitted the nuts and used 3 c coconut "chips" (fingernail size chips) and 1 c "shredded" coconut (=very finely grated). These are...well...like lumps of sweet chewy coconut!

I was really expecting some great cookies, but they turned out ok. It could be the macademia nuts I was using (a mix of salted and unsalted) or something else, but I wasn't obsessed. Not sure I'd make them again. Got a similar response when I brought them to the office.

Where I am, there is only dry, unsweetened coconut. I've been away from the US so long I don't remember what the difference is between 'shredded' and 'flaked,' etc. I've got only dry, grated, unsweetened coconut. Using that, the 'batter' or 'dough' (as some reviewers are calling it) is dry and crumbly before adding the egg white. I had to use three whites to make it 'sticky' (by no means a 'dough' and certainly not a pourable 'batter'!). I've never made macaroons before, so I guess it's all right. Don't know why it says they are like a candy bar, unless the sweetened coconut makes them that way. These are just lightly sweet. I'll see how they come out when I put chocolate on them. I don't like sickly sweet anyway. Worried about the dryness - how do you 'fold' beaten egg whites into a dry, crumbly mixture? Why does one reviewer say to beat the whites well to get height, when after you put the whites in you just get sticky stuff, not anything fluffy? Puzzling. Guess I need to take a class in Macaroons 101.

I absolutely adore macaroons and these were a real treat! I made them for a cookie exchange and they were a big hit! I might have toasted the coconut a BIT too long but it didn't seem to matter too much.

I did everything wrong and this is still a fabulous recipe. If you're looking for a superb macaroon, this is it.

These are great. Like a Mounds bar but much better. I used Dove dark chocolate. I think it has the smoothest texture of any dark chocolate I've tried. Who sells unsalted macadamia nuts? I put salted nuts in a strainer and shook them around for a while.

absolutely fabulous! everyone raved about them, and they're still talking about them two weeks later. i'll be making these for a party of 45 later this month.

Mmmm... outrageously yummy! Will definitely make for passover and any other time. I used blanched whole almonds instead - worked out great.

These are fantastic! Only 2 changes... used 3 egg whites and then made half of the batter just as the recipe called for and the other half with chocolate chips. Then I dipped both kinds in the bittersweet chocolate. Both were great. They will make a great addition to our Passover dessert tray.

if you follow the directions and cook the coconut for 15 minutes at 350, you will have burned coconut. Either reduce temperature, or bake about 8 minutes. Cookies were good, but I would prefer baking them at a lower temp.

These macaroons were absolutly fantastic! I've had rave reviews from my co-workers and demands for a second batch. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and added and extra egg and instead of dipping them into chocolate, I drizzled it over the top so they wouldn't be too sweet and for appearance. This recipe is a keeper.

I just looked up the recipe again to make it for an elegant thank-you gift. They are beautiful. I used a small cookie scoop, and the were just perfect. They look much more difficult to make than they really are. Everyone was impressed.

Monster hit. Used silicone mats instead of parchment paper for baking and in place of wax paper to set after dipping. Cooked slightly longer to get browing on top. Took them to a party 10 people asked for the recipe.

These were delicious and so easy. I used almonds instead of macadamias and three egg whites because I wanted more of a meringue texture. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again

Delicious! Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the macadamia nuts are a delicious addition! Better with the bittersweet chocolate dip, but also quite good without it. And deceptively easy, too.

This is my favorite macaroon recipe! It gets rave reviews whenever I take it anywhere! It's definitely worth making anytime of year.

The nuts MAKE this recipe! We couldn't find unsalted macademias, but the wee bit of salt mixed with the sweet coconut and bitter chocolate made an excellent combination! Tip: Be sure to fully beat egg whites to maximize macaroon height, and when spooning onto parchment, keep portions small, round and as high as possible. a greased ice cream scoop is ideal for the perfect shape!

These are the best coconut macaroons ever! They're easy to make and not too sweet. I drizzle extra chocolate over the top to make them look even fancier.

These cookies were excellent! A total hit at out passover seder. The bittersweet chocolate added a lot to the macaroons, but I also added chocolate chips to the dough which worked well. Recommended for Passover or any time of year!
