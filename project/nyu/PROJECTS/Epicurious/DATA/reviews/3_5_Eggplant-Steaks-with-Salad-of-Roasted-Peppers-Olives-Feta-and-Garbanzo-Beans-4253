I cooked dried garbanzo beans instead of using canned ones. Other than that I followed the recipe and my husband and I loved it. It is extrenely light with just a salad though. I'll definitely make this again.

I cubed the eggplant and tossed together with mixture. Good over mixed green salad or as dinner side dish.

absolutely amazing! i made this recipe for vegetarian and non-vegetarian guests and received the same positive feedback from both. we added garlic tofu steaks to the meal as well for a solid source of protein.

Very good. Made the vegetables on the grill. Did not use all the dressing - just a drizzle was enough. A nice side dish.

Yum, yum! We had this for dinner tonight and both thought it was wonderful. I made the salad and let it sit for about an hour so it could come together, and salted the eggplant slices. I was able to do other things around the house during this time. We threw the eggplant slices on the grill, and I really liked the way it turned out. The only change I would make would be to use slightly less oil. Other than that, what a great vegetarian meal on a summer night!

The reviews didn't lie! Excellent and easy to prepare. The fresh oregano brings out a sparkle to the dish, don't substitute that one. I didn't have the peppers so i let the eggplant cool a bit and used cucumbers instead and served on bed of lettuce with a side of roasted new potatoes. Yum.

It was fast and easy. Very good.The eggplant had almost a meaty texture about it. I was worried that the eggplant would be bitter because it was not salted down, but this did not prove to be a problem. I used white cannelli beans instead due to the fact that the garbanzos on hand were of the dried variety. This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious. Instead of soy in the dressing, I shot a little Lite Asian salad dressing in it, and it cut the acidity of the balsamic and gave it a little sweetness. VERY tasty. I grilled the eggplant in a stove-top grill pan, and added a portabella mushroom -- also girlled -- to the stack, to make it a "meal". Served on a bed of spinach.

I have been referring to Epicurious for 5 years now and this is the first review I've been impelled to make. This is the best eggplant recipe, hands down! We love it (and I don't love eggplant...I made it because my hubby does!)

made the dish in 30 minutes. used jarred red peppers. also skipped the soy sauce as it didn't seem to go with mediterranean flavors. used basil, red onion, and full can of chickpeas for protein. great vegetarian recipe and good for busy weekenights

UPDATE: Made again tonight with the soy sauce & dried oregano instead of fresh. Do not like what the soy does to the dressing and will no longer add it to the recipe. Added sundried tomatoes, red onion & arugula to make it more of a meal. Yum.

I made this for my husband because he really likes eggplant although I'm not a big fan. Before he could say anything, I professed I was totally making this again. I did make a few changes: omitted the soy sauce (ran out), used belgian feta (fantastic!), added parsley to the dressing, and added red onion and baby arugula to the salad. Did broil the eggplant, but I think I might try grilling them and chopping the olives next time. I use dried herbs on a regular basis (cheap and easy) for everything, but decided to go for the fresh oregano this time; boy does that make a difference! This dish is a keeper.

Loved it! Marinated the eggplant first in the dressing and then grilled the eggplant. Started with baby greens, then eggplant, then topped with jarred roasted red peppers, chopped kalamata olives, dried oregano, and diced red onion. Topped the salad with the dressing. Didn't need the feta. Will make again and again.

I used bottled red peppers & basil because that is what i had on hand. Next time i will try it with goat cheese & fresh oregano. The eggplant "steaks" would be good by themselves with just the oil/vin/soy mixture brushed on them.

Have made this twice in a week and gotten raves! This is WONDERFUL! Ran out of Balsamic Vinegar so used Red Wine Vinegar. This one doesnt get any better!!!

Like other reviewers, I used bottled roasted peppers. Also omitted the feta cheese since we're vegan. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and was very happy with the results. I'm curious -- how many "steaks" did a pound and a half of eggplant yield for other reviewers? I used a one-pound eggplant and got six steaks, which was plenty for dinner for two and a light lunch the next day.

Followed a few suggestions from other reviews and made with bottled roasted red peppers, fresh basil and a chopped roma tomato. DELICIOUS! Next time I make it, I plan to halve the dressing, or at least the amount of olive oil, as it seemed a tad too much for my taste/diet. Overall, this is a great summertime meal!

I loved this! I made it for myself as a vegetarian entree and couldn't have been happier. It was quick and easy - I used bottled roasted peppers and fresh basil instead of oregano. YUMMY!!

Yum! Used pre-roasted red pepper strips, but otherwise followed recipe to the letter. Can't wait for warm weather to grill the eggplant outdoors and enjoy this entree again! A keeper!

Tasty. For the salad, I used pinto beans instead of garbanzo and basil instead of oregano. I added a tomato too which was good.

Eggplant is my favorite veg. I've collected over 600 recipes starring eggplant. So far, I have tried only 357 of them because some I just love and repeat over and over. When I came across this recipe I had all the ingred. on hand so I jumped right up and made it. So easy! 35min. later I was woofing it down. I peeled the eggplant and coated one side with Gomashio (toasted sesame salt) and lemon pepper. I marinated the eggplant for 10 min. in dressing. Poured off dressing to use remainder for salad and added juice of half a lemon. It took my eggplant about 8 min. per side to become golden. The beans added not only flavor but also nice contrast in texture. I fixed this just for myself so I have plenty left over. I chopped up the eggplant and added it to the salad and today I'm eating it stuffed in pita with lettuce and tomato. Flavors are even better today. This will go with so many M.E. dishes, esp. lamb or chicken. I will be serving and sharing this recipes with friends. What more can you ask for from a recipe than ease of preparation, great meld of flavors, good blend of textures, pretty presentation (I added some halved cherry tomatoes, because I had them), and it's healthy. The only thing that doesn't make this recipe perfect is that it doesn't have a strong aroma. Thanks Nora for posting this KEEPER.

This is a really tasty and different salad which I will serve as a first course again. Delish!

My son came home from overseas a vegan. I have spent the summer searching for recipes that serve multiple purposes to please him and the rest of my carnivore family. This one is great because it is very flexible. Leave out the feta for the vegan; use black beans instead of garbanzo; eat it as a side dish or a main dish. We all love this recipe!

Wonderful. I used 1/2 the amount of feta and it was perfect. I also brushed both sides of the eggplant, waited 10 minutes, then brushed both sides again before broiling. It wasn't at all bland. This made enough at our house for an entree for 4 people.

I served this for a ladies luncheon along with grilled lamb chops and a lemon mousse for dessert. This salad was a hit. Not a single morsel of it was left and everyone asked for the recipe. Quick, easy to plate, attractive, delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious and really easy. My whole family loved it. Not quite enough to for a stand alone meal. I will definitely make this again, though.

This was a wonderful recipe! I triplked the garlic and used basil instead of oregano since my store didn't have it fresh. Everyone had seconds!

This is a great recipe. I'm not a feta fan, so I used mozzarella cheese instead, and it was delicious. It's also really good the next day for lunch!

I made this for a dinner party I had as an appetizer, delicious!!! Everyone was going crazy over it! Next time I'll make double the recipe.

This is a wonderful summer dish! My husband doesn't like olives so they were omitted, and we used the entire (16 oz) can of chick peas at my 5-year-old's insistence. I served it with a brown rice pilaf and salad, and it was just the right amount for 4 adults and 2 children (who kept asking for more chick peas, so it's a good thing they all went in).

I was not impressed with this dish. I thought that the eggplant was bland and tasteless and the dressing was a bit overpowering with the vinegar. However, I think the salad and a bit of dressing would be good over pasta.

My boyfriend and I picked this out, he cooked and we both thought it was great! I plan on making it as an appetizer dish for Thanksgiving by cutting the eggplant in 1/4's. It's a wild dish!!

I thought the vinegar was a bit overpowering - especially as feta is quite sharp,too. Plus, there's no way it would serve six (except maybe as a starter). I made it as the recipe stands for four people and was worried about it not being enough food so I added in the cheese and garbanzo beans I had left over.

Broiled eggplant steaks have become a staple for us. Delicious and easy. I broil the red peppers at the same time. The garbanzos are complimented by the brisk vinegraitte. A cook in Aberdeen, WA.

This vegetarian recipe was really delicious--i served it to my husband and two of his carnivorous friends and they were begging for more. I made extra dressing, and instead of brushing it on the steaks, I drizzled it on both sides. Since I had extra red pepper sald left, I tossed it with more dressing and pasta shells. It was also a great success! Thanks Nora!
