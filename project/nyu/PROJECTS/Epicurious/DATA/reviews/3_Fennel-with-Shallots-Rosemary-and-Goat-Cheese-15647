excellent, added a sliced apple, and used feta instead of chevre, reduced butter. My husband raved! He loves new flavor combinations.

This dish made rave reviews from my dinner guests. The fennel abosrbed the wine flavors spectacularly so make sure you use a good wine that will complement the rest of the meal. Will definitely make again -- one guest had never had fennel before and ended up being totally addicted to thisdish.

I made this for a surprise birthday dinner in 1998 for 12, served it with poached salmon & dill. It was superb, & everyone raved.

Only one out of my 26 guests liked this recipe. Something in the recipe was too overpowering - perhaps the wine or just the combination. I wouldn't make it again.

A note to previous reviwer. You don't know till you try it. I have made this for the past two years at thanksgiving and people who claim not to like either fennel OR goat cheese love it! I bit time consuming but well worth the effort.

I made this for a dinner party and it was delicious! I'm making it again to take to Thanksgiving dinner at a friends house.
