Wonderful and very simple to make. I will probably up the leeks next time and maybe do a little mashing before the meat is added. The only changes I made were to triple the recipe (as is it's really only enough for 2 appetizers), I used tasso ham because that's what I had, and I used more spinach than called for. Oh yeah, and half and half instead of cream. I don't know what the reviewers who hated this did wrong, but this was "restaurant quality" according to the bf.

With minor tweeking this is a winner. First, you can use a lower fat sausage I like smoked turkey. Yes! toasting the seeds is crucial. Then don't crowd the pot while browning the sausages! Brown in batches then add the leek plus throw in some onion as well. Then when you are ready to toss in the spinach (of kale) I add a little white Vermont cheddar (if you like)as well and a splash of white wine. The cheese isn't necessary but it is filling on a cold winter day. I bake a multi-grain baguette and serve with soft butter. Give that a try for a more blended and harmonious taste that keeps everyone happy and raving.

This is one of my favorite fall soups. I usually double or triple the recipe. It is quick and delicious. Toasting the whole spices is key. I also saute the sausage first and use milk instead of cream and usually omit the spinach. Highly recommended

This soup is great I made it the first time in 93' and make it about three times a year since.

This is probably my favorite soup to make as well as to serve. It is quick, easy and the taste is supberb! The one thing I do that isn't mentioned in the recipie is to cook the kielbasa in a seperate pan before putting it in the soup. Otherwise, I feel it doesn't cook through enough. It is a perfect soup for a cold, wintery day!

This is a reliable recipe and easy to make. Just leave out the cuminseed if that flavor bothers you. I have used low fat and turkey bielbasa successfuly

This was pretty awful! A waste of my homegrown ingredients.

I used this recipe as a reference when making "Sausage and Leek Soup," also from this site. Previous reviewers' dislike of the spices dissuaded me. I was glad, however, to find that this list of ingredients used far less butter that the aforementioned recipe, and I modified accordingly.

Great weekday soup. I prefer more potato and more fennel seed than cumin.

I really liked it. I used hot italian sausage (use low-fat otherwise it is too greasy) instead of kielbasa and cumin powder instead of the cumin and caraway seeds. I also put in about 50% more potato than the recipe called for.

Wow. Yuck. This is the first well-rated recipe on Epicurious I've been disappointed by. Leek & potato soup is one of my very favorites, and I love experimenting with other things to include in it, but caraway, cumin and keilbasa didn't work for me at all! Now, granted, I didn't include the spinach because I don't like it. But I'd be very surprised if that was the key ingredient to this soup's success. Having said that, though, I didn't give this recipe a rating because my opinion isn't fully informed.

This soup is great, both on the day made and as leftovers. Doubling it makes sense because it's not that much more work and you have more meals covered. I make it as written, including the kielbasa, and don't find I need to change a thing.

Have made this one many, many times. Try grilling the sausage a bit first for a little extra flavor. Using low fat sausage works great as reported by others. Also can use a chicken-based sausage, although you do give up a bit of flavor. Finally, mashing up some of the potatoes adds some thickening effect to cream it up a bit. Can be easily doubled, tripled or quadrupled. A terrific recipe!!

This can easily be made vegetarian with Boca Smoked Sausage --- really good and hearty soup. So flavorful and creamy. It is a staple now in our home. The toasted seeds add such a tasty flavor to the whole ensemble. I made no other modifications and don't find any necessary.

salty and disgusting. i ended up throwing it away.

This is a fabulous recipe! The whole family loved it! I used kielbasa, which isn't strong flavored at all. If you've never had it, it tastes like a mild salami. I left out the cuminseed, but definitely use the caraway, it compliments the whole dish well. Oh,and I also tripled the recipe. I can't say enough about this!

I didn't use the cuminseed or caraway, doubled the recipe and added an extra potato. Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and "fake butter". Delicious!

I made this recipe with a low fat smoked sausage. It was very good. Even my 11 year old son liked it. I will definately make this again -- particularly on a cold day.

I made a slight modification to this soup. I tripled it: added an extra cup of water, pureed the potato leek portion, returned to pot and then added panfried italian sausage, 2 Tbps low sodium onion soup mix, and spinach at the end. Next time I'm going to roll up my sausage into balls like the previous reviewer did. I think it's going to look even nicer. This recipe was fantastic!

Super flavor for an extremely fast recipe. Great with Italian sausage rolled into tiny, tiny balls.

This soup was very hearty and pretty good, but the sausage totally overpowered the leek. I used linquisa sausage, but I'm sure the kielbasa would have been overpowering as well.

A great soup. Full tasting yet light. Perfect for a lazy afternoon.

Very good soup. Nothing too fancy here, just tasty ingredients and simple instructions. I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used sour cream and it worked just fine.

We give this 3 1/2 forks. Delicious, satisfying and hearty without being heavy. Will do again many times.

With all the potatos from my garden I had to use some up. This was the perfect way, and I made lots of extras to freeze. I used spicy sausage and it was great, also a pressure cooker was a quick way to get it made and into my stomach. Really yummy.

This soup was delicious and easy. I used the whites and greens of wild leeks, and Swiss Chard instead of spinach. It was great and would definitely make it again.

I really liked the cumin and caraway seeds. They added an unexpected twist. However, I prefer a heartier green like kale or chard to keep up with the meaty flavor of the sausage. I added garlic and used quite a bit more spinach to make it a "greenier" soup. Very good and quick. A little crushed red pepper in the saute would be good, too.

Hearty and filling. Easy directions. Husband loved it. Would definetely make it again. I doubled amounts and made extra for the next day's lunch. Also, used canned spinach, and was just as good.

This soup was fabulous! Although, I would cut potatoes a little larger, omit the cumin & caraway seeds, and add more spinach. Very easy to make. Quick, too! It doesn't make a lot so, I doubled it.

This one tastes better than it sounds. Great for on those cold winter days.

A reliable favorite that's a snap to make up in short order. Great for those times when you just need something warm and hearty to soothe the inner being. Easily doubled.

I have made this soup for several years now and it is one of our family's favorite. Even my in-laws now make their own version of it (they use onion instead of leeks and add LOTS of garlic). I have tried it with sour cream or even milk when we are out of cream, and it works just as well. If you like kielbasa, you will love this soup.

I have made this soup many, many times over the years. It is simple to make and unlike many soups, can be done last minute. You have to like cumin in order to appreciate this soup. Definately use fresh kielbasa because the smoked ones in the grocery store are too salty. The spinach at the end is a must; it gives the soup the color it needs. Many people have requested this recipe from me. It is delicious on a cold winter day with homemade crusty bread and a nice glass of wine. Even my 2 year old son loves this recipe!

Was not particularly pleased. That is pretty much all I have to say about that.

I've made this one several times - it's become one of my husbands favorites and he usually doesn't like soup. I usually leave out the cumin and caraway seed - it's best with the spinach but parsley is an acceptable substitute.
