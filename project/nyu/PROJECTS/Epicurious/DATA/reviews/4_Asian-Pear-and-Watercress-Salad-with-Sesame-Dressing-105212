This dressing definitely has some kick to it! A simple salad with complex flavors. Love the combination of spicy-peppery-sweetness. Always a winner with guests!

very good! for the dressing i substituted Splenda for the sugar and it was fine! also i used chili garlic sauce for the chili paste with garlic. it may be the same thing and that was what i had. some complained that the dressing was thick but i just thinned it with a few more tablespoons of water. could not find asian pears so i used a ripe bartlett pear which was fine. i also used Smuckers natural peanut butter (no sugar).

41 reviews and I have to search for somebody who actually FOLLOWED the recipe. So, is it good or not? I really can't tell with your "I used spinach/romaine/field greens no carrot, peanut butter instead of tahini, apples instead of pears, added a little turkey" substitutions.

since the dressing is of a thicker consistency, it does seem like it would be too heavy for a salad of thin leaves. instead, my sister and i used the dressing to make a thai peanut slaw--thinly sliced cabbage, shredded carrots, roasted sesame seeds, raisins, and crushed peanuts, all tossed with the dressing. deliciooooous!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Rave reviews from dinner party. I used strawberries instead of pears, added some romaine and argula and topped with browned chopped Marconi almonds and sesame seeds. Served the dressing on the side, since it is not too beautiful mixed in.

Made this last night for visiting family and it was delicious. I didn't use watercress since it didn't look too good, wanted to use arugula and baby spinach but there wasn't any so I ended with a Mixed Greens which was okay. Arugula would have been better I think. I made it almost exactly as written except I added chopped avocade as well. I think next time I'll roast crumbled peanuts and sprinkle them over the top for crunchiness. I also added about a teaspoon or so of Sweet Chili Sauce for kick. I'll make this again.

Excellent salad! I will certainly make again, probably for company. The watercress and abundance of items in the dressing made it a little more time-consuming than my usual salads but it is worth it.

This is fantastic! I love Asian pear but it is good with apples to. I also used Romaine, b/c that's what I had, but i believe watercress with it's peppery taste would be better, although I have no complaints. The dressing is rich, and next time I might halve the peanut butter or add twice the vinegar and a TSP of sugar (or splenda). My husband and I really enjoyed this!

Great dressing. Can also be used as a sauce for mild fish or chicken. I follow the recipe exactly, but substitute splenda for the sugar.

This was quite good- I altered it significantly, using more commonly available ingredients. Peanut butter was used instead of tahini, 1 dried chile pepper instead of the chile paste, mesculun salad greens instead of watercress. Despite all the changes, the salad was really nice and simple. Definitely a crowd pleaser and very easy to make.

Great tatse! Followed the recipe exactly and it was not too thick as some have experienced. I used half sesame tahini paste and half peanut butter. Served with baby spinach and added some sliced avocado. Plated the salad and drizzled dressing on top. Everyone loved it!

I was really disapointed in this salad after reading the reviews. I made it to go with a Thai menu for our dinner club and we found that the dressing was too heavy for the salad. It tasted fine, but just too much. The dressing would be nice as a dip for shrimp or chicken but even then I think that there are better ones. I will not make this again.

Definitely a three plus. I used peanutbutter, sweet chili sauce (couldn't find chili paste with garlic), half as much watercress, and forgot the carrots. The dressing is fabulous with the asian pears or by the spoonful! So glad I found this recipe and so glad we planted two asian pear trees a few years ago!

I found this recipe while looking for a use for the fresh watercress that I bought today & WOW! What a FAH-bulous dressing! Didn't have the pear on hand, but I'm sure it would be a magnificent addition to an already killer salad. Maybe I'll make more tomorrow! Served this as an accompaniment to salmon, marinated in sake & soy with ginger - a terrific pairing, if I do say so myself ;-)

Okay California....with your ridiculous boiled potato, cottage cheese addition to this recipe, you managed to make me sick!

This was so easy to make and really delicious. It is light and refeshing and perfect accompaniment to asian food. I served is as an appetizer before green thai chicken curry. Guests were super impressed.

Have made this many times now. Substituted spinach for watercress and have even made with romaine. Very nice summer salad

Rating: 3
Like others, I added soy sauce, a little more vinegar for consistency sake and less sugar. For a healthy and quick meal, I toss spinach with this dressing. Then I put hot, chopped boiled red potatoes on top with a helping of cottage cheese. I know it sounds like an odd combination, but it does the trick!

My husband and I both enjoyed this salad with shrimp cocktail. Used bosc pear instead of the Asian (unavailbable today at the store). Wonderful summer meal. My husband suggested brushing chicken wings with the dressing and putting on the BBQ. We'll try that this weekend.

This salad has become a favorite side dish with Asian fare at my place. I also garnish with a bit of cilantro.

Delicious! Everyone loved it. As with other reviewers, I didn't use a blender for the dressing - just grated the ginger. If you have a lot of dressing left overm it is great tossed it with cooked soba noodles, chopped cucumber and shredded chicken. sprinkle with chopped peanuts.

Yummy! Made this per recipe and thought it was fabulous. I will be making this for my next dinner party.

I made just the dressing for a salad made with thawed out turkey leftovers, romaine, green bell pepper, water chesnuts, and mandarin sections. I turned out so well I may have to roast another turkey just to make the salad again! The dressing is absolutely delicious and I can't wait to try the whole recipe.

very delicious and refreshing!!!

Excellent dressing......we followed the other suggestions and used baby spinach one night and assorted greens the next, both were just fine. Our pear was rather "flat" but tasty just the same.......we may try this again with tart apple or even halved grapes.

This dressing has a lot of kick - I copied another reviewer and simply dotted the dressing around the salad. This was enough for most of my dinner guests, and I had the extra dressing ready for those who wanted more of the taste on the salad. My husband specifically put more dressing on to "kill" the taste of the watercress. I would definitely not use the watercress again but substitute spinach and other mixed greens. The dressing was easy to make ahead in the blender.

I was only looking for a salad dressing to go on my salad I was preparing, to go with the "Thai Shrimp Soup with Lemon and Jalapenos" recipe found on this site, (which, by the way, is absolutely delicious). I was just using the romaine and bell peppers I already had on hand, but decided to get some Asian pears while I was at the store and add those too. The salad was a huge hit. My Dad actually said that he would drink the rest of the dressing if I wanted him to, (I didn't, but I at least let him go back for thirds). I changed it a tad: I used peanut butter, and thought that the taste was a little overwhelming. I added a little extra rice vinegar, garlic chili sauce instead of paste, a little soy sauce, and about a tbsp. of brown sugar (I love that flavor with soy). I can't say enough how perfect the taste and texture of the pear was with the dressing. YUMMY! Will definitely make again...and maybe even try the original recipe :).

I made the dressing (but shook it in a jar instead of blending) and used it on the Asian Chicken Salad with Roasted Peanuts (also from Epicurious). It was a easy and so delicious!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I didn't bother with the carrots. Next time I would not "blenderize" the dressing, comes out way too thick. I'll shake it in a jar. I'm also going to try toasted pine nuts with a little chili powder for spice. They would add a nice foil to the sweet/spicy dress

used baby spinach instead of watercress. dressing was a little thick but easy to fix. great dish

I made this with a few changes for the salad course of a dinner party and it was a big hit. I used field greens and spinach instead of watercress; red pears instead of asian pears; and peanut butter instead of sesame paste. I also added a few halved cherry tomatoes for color and toasted pine-nuts (just because they always taste so good). I tossed the salad and mounded it on the plates, added the tomatoes and pine nuts then using a squeeze bottle (indispensable of course) I put "dots" of dressing around the salad. Lots of oohs and aahs for the presentation, and more for the taste (restaurant quality). Big hit - not much work.

I liked this as a salad to accompany the Teriyaki Portobella Burgers on this site. I used apples instead of pears, and added some sliced avocado on top. Very tasty - this is a recipe I foresee making frequently.

Excellent salad for company using baby spinach and peanut butter. Pretty and flavourful (good bite from chili paste).

I made this exactly as described the first time. Enjoyed it as written, but decided to substitute baby spinach leaves the next time. My wife and I both preferred the spinach to the watercress. We also added some cashew pieces.

Our company enjoyed this salad very much. The dressing has a little bite to it, but it was an interesting blend that worked well with the rest of the meal. I'll be making this one again.

Because I couldnt find asian sesame paste and the sesame oil I made a little variation. I blended roasted peanuts to get the peanut butter, and I used peanut oil. This way I got a dressing with a fabulous texture. My family loved it.

This salad is wonderful. I am not a huge watercress or peanut butter fan. However, I could eat this once or twice a week. I couldn't find Asian chile paste w/ garlic so I bought Asian garlic paste and added chile powder. No problem. Great recipe.

This was refreshing and delicious and not time-consuming as some Asian recipes are. I added some crumbled goat cheese and it put it over the top. :)

This was a terrific combo of texture and flavor. I will probably try it with mesclun greens instead of just watercress next time. We added to it some seared chunks of tuna that had been marinated in soy sauce and minced ginger.

Excellent dressing! Certainly can be used in a varity of applications. I stir fried some chicken, then added dressing just to warm it up a bit and tossed it with some mixed greens. Awesome!

I used the dressing for a salad of spinach, radishes and shredded chicken breasts. It was terrific! I also used tahini. I omitted the salt because the chili paste with garlic is salty enough for me. I also reduced the sugar.

Rating: 4
I made this salad for a dinner party, but was a bit hesitant as there were no reviews. Well, it was worth the gamble! Totally amazing! I used 1/2 tahini (sesame butter) & 1/2 peanut butter, & I did cut down the sugar to 1/2. I also substituted soy sauce for most of the salt. This not only tantalizes the tast buds, it also has a beautiful presentation. Served with Red Chili Chicken (Epicurious) and home made yellow rice.

I wanted to read the ratings on this salad dressing before I tried it. Were their any comments?
