Made while half asleep, so will give recipe benefit of doubt, for any doubts of mine. Made mine raisin-anise-fennel, yumyum, and decided to leave cranberry-raisin blend for another day (yes, I will be making these again). Caveat for moisture; if using small eggs, use them whole or the batter will be too dry. Plumped raisins, if you are using them, will probably help with the overall moisture, and be less likely to burn. Do cut into half-inch slices as advised, because chunky inclusions weaken the structure. As someone else has noted, score the top of the loaf, the gently rock and press down with a utility knife to cut into individual pieces.

Not great. Too much going on with the anise, the cranberries and the pistachios. I say leave out the anise and I love anise. It just doesn't go well with cranberry and pistachio. Also, they were impossible to slice 1/4 inch thick. The best I could do was 1/2 inch slices, which resulted in a gummy texture even when I baked them longer the second time.

Wonderful! When I made them, I added about 1-2 T. melted butter to hold them together better. Everyone loved them. I left out the pitch. nuts but add a little more admonds. By Donna Hoiland MN

Easy and delicious. Anise seeds are a must. I didn't know what "light butter" meant, so I just used regular unsalted butter. I used all almonds instead of a mix of almonds and pistachios, which worked fine. Highly recommend!

it is so good!

Very good, although dry in the middle and crispy. I toasted the almonds first and am glad I sprung for the pistachios. Together they are really good. I don't like anise, so I left out the seeds; fresh lemon zest a must.

I just made these and they are wonderful! Was worried about cutting them based on the other reviews but I just used a very sharp chopping knife and took my time. No crumbling. Drizzled chocolate glaze (used the new Duncan Hines Amazing Glazes"..perfect recipe!

This was very good. I have made it a couple of times. Most recently, I baked for 22 minutes before slicing. I slice a little thicker than the recipe suggests - about 1/2" or less. Everyone enjoys these.

Great recipe. The only difficult part was cutting the biscotti because of the pistachios and cranberries but overall easy and delicious.

These tasted great, but couldn't get them cut with out crumbling. So made thicker slices, but then the cooking time was off. As they were meant for a gift, presentation was important. I think I might try a different recipe next time.

This is the third year I have made these for gifts and they are always great tasting. The anise is what gives it a kick and I think it would be somewhat bland without it. To prevent breakage, I used a chopping knife and sawed the top slightly then used a rocking motion to make a clean cut which worked better than a serrated knife. The white chocolate should be the best quality you can find and definitely makes it more festive. Rave reviews form everyone that I gave them to!

These are delicious and quite festive. I spread the melted white chocolate over the bottom of each rather than just dipping the ends.

Loved this recipe but, unlike, previous reviewer, I thought the anise was totally necessary. A standout flavor!

Having made both recipes, I think the "other" recipe for Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti is the better of the 2 on this site. In both cases, one secret is to let the log cool completely after the first bake, before making any cuts. Even so, the dough in this recipe is more dry - don't know why.

Very good flavor but crumbled into a terrible mess even with a serrated knife and were not usuable. Followed directions to a "T". Will not make again.

I am not sure what I did wrong, so any suggestions would be appreciated. The biscotti tastes great--I also used nutmeg instead of anise and found it to add a wonderful flavor. However, the "dough" was more of a powder and I had to add a little oil just to get it to stick together. When it came time to cut the dough after the first bake, it crumbled, even with using a serrated knife. I was able to salvage some decent-sized pieces but even those crumbled quite easily after the second bake. I'd love to try this again since even my kids loved this, but I would like to have a little more success with the texture.

This was a crowd-pleaser. Didn't have anise, but as another reviewer suggested added some nutmeg, and it worked out fine. I especially loved the texture of the two types of nuts and cranberries!

I and everyone else loved these cookies. I followed the recipe except used real butter and they turned out great. Did not need to oil my hands.

Made this recipe for a cookie exchange at work. Everyone loved it. Make sure you use large eggs otherwise dough will be very crumbly and won't hold it's shape.

This was easy and delicious. I added 1/4c more pistacios and a few grinds of nutmeg instead of the anise (husband hates that taste). These have so much texture and chew...much better than the dried bricks we buy. Great dipped in a latte for breakfast. Great gift item...Happy Holidays

Biscotti is my new favorite thing to make...SO easy! But, with this recipe, I would reduce the amount of Anise Seed by half. Although it has great flavor, it overpowered the delicate cranberries and nuts. To cut easily, try a serrated bread knife, it works beautifully!

These biscotti are simple to make and truly delicious! The batter is extremely dry, however, and I did have a bit of difficulty slicing the biscotti. Otherwise, they were fabulous, and the red of the cranberries and green of the pistachios also make them very festive.
