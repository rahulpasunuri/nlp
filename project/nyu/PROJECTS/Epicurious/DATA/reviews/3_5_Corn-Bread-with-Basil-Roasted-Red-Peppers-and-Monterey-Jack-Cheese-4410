Absolutely love this cornbread! I am not normally a cornbread fan but it is wonderful! It's become a requirement at Thanksgiving and Christmas each year.

Used less cornmeal and more flour (our meal is quite "gritty"), red onion sauteed with bacon (used the meat as a side), and homemade roasted peppers. The kids would eat it again but prefer no roasted pepper.

This bread is dense and delicious. I cut it into 16 pieces and the servings were plenty.

basil, red peppers, and corn is a weird combo. basil + any of the other ingredients is a weird combo. i love cornbread, but this tasted off.

Based on everyone's response I made this and found it to be pretty bland and a lot of work

I didn't have corn, basil, so substituted frozen green beans (chopped) and cilantro. It was fantastic.

My family loved this recipe!! It was very flavorful and the additions helped to make it a very pretty dish as well. I would definitely serve this for guests.

A little more chopping and prep work than my standard corn bread recipe, but well worth it. I used about half of the basil because that's all I had, but otherwise followed the recipe. Very moist, and I thought the perfect balance between sweet and savory. A new favorite recipe.

An outstanding, savory cornbread. Even though I am a Yankee, this recipe impressed an entire dinner party of southerners. Moist, flavorful, and delicious.

In 1997 I won the grand champion at the Alaska State Fair with this recipe. The person who said it was not sweet enough is obviously not from the South as I am origionally. People who want sweet cornbread don't want real corn bread they want corn cake! It is plenty sweet enough and great with chili.

Didn't care for these at all. Only put half the basil after reading the reviews. It was still too much and I am usually a big fan of basil. I prefer a sweeter cornbread I think.

Yup - this is one of those WOW recipes! Very impressive, for a potluck or something.

Wonderful cornbread. I omitted the sugar because I used super sweet white corn, and, as others did, added more salt and red pepper flakes.

This was great with BBQ ribs! I used all 8 T. butter in the batter, and about 1/3 c. basil. It had great flavor and moisture. After three days in the 'fridge wrapped in foil, I threw it on the grill to reheat, and it was still moist and terrific.

I didn't have basil at home and it was still quite delicious without it. Best cornbread ever.

This is a lovely recipe. I followed the suggestions of other raters and cut the basil in half and doubled the salt. It was delicious and all my guests raved about the "bite."

Was time consuming doing the prep but was definitely worth it. Made them into muffins to take to a chili party and baked them about 18 minutes. Also made 'regular' corn bread and this was a bigger hit. I normally love basil but think it was a bit overwhelming in this recipe, will try a lesser amount next time.

i made this cornbread to go along with chili. great combo! i followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great but a bit crumbly. wasn't crazy about the basil..next time i'll leave it out.

This recipe is scrumptious! But it did need more salt, next time 2 1/2 teaspoons. Don't fret, you are only eating a small amount of it! It intensifies the flavor.

This is an absolutely delicious corn bread! It is moist, flavorful and an interesting way to liven up a simple soup or salad dinner. I made it exactly as written in the recipe and was very pleased with the results. Its definitely a keeper.

This is hands down the best corn bread I have ever made. I substituted creamed corn for the kernels that added additional moistness. Yummy!!!

I have been making this for years and really like it. I was surprised I wasn't in the review list, but I started making it before there were reviews on the site.

I made this years ago and loved it and am so glad I thought to look it up here again - yummy! Made it with Vegetable and Bean Chili (from this site) and it was perfect cool Fall Sunday football fare!

I loved all the ingredients in this receipe but I just wasn't thrilled with it. Maybe I was expecting something sweeter????

This was the best cornbread I have ever made! I made a few changes-polenta in place of the usual cornmeal,which gave it a little delicious crunch,fresh corn and cooked the onions in bacon grease(bacon was for the corn chowder). Very moist and great flavor!

Let me start by saying that I am NOT a big cornbread fan...but this was incredible!! It's a bit time consuming (grating the cheese, chopping the veggies) but completely worth it for this exquisite dish. I would definitely make this for company.

I almost called my husband when I was making this to tell him how great it was going to be. I love all of the ingredients in it. Sorry to be the only one to say that neither one of us liked it at all. Maybe it is because I am not sophisticated about true corn bread because I never had it home made.

Great corn bread recipe. A little more exiting than most recipes. Goes great with a Mexican fiesta menu.

Great texture, moist and tasty. I used fresh sweet organic corn from Thailand and added some Thai chillies for a little more heat !

Excellent! Our favorite by far! The dish ended up being a bit crumbly, but who cares when it tastes this good?

I shall never make corn bread any other way again! Superb and easy!

This was a welcome alternative to corn bread at my family's Thanksgiving! Everyone loved it. Be sure to refrigerate the leftovers -- I left them sitting on the counter and the next day the bread smelled really sour -- most likely due to so much cheese in the recipe.

Very yummy and satisfying. It is somewhat time-consuming to make what with the chopping of the basil, roasting of the peppers, shredding of the cheese etc. but quite worth it. Serve it to your vegetarian friends with a bowl of soup or a salad. They'll love you for it!

I made this for a party and it was a hit. The little that was leftover was taken home with one of the guests. I like the idea of adding a jalpeno pepper.

Cornbread never had so much flare! Make it when there are a lot of people over because 1 piece is more than enough, even for the most indulgent eaters.Try adding a jalapeno pepper.

This is scrumptious! Sure, it is over-the-top indulgent, especially for corn bread, but that is what makes it oh so satisfying. As far as I'm concerned, add a soup or salad and this could be dinner.
