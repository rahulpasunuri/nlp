Very disappointing - I had to add a lot of different things to spruce it up and even then it wasn't worth the effort in my opinion.

The dressing is very easy to make. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, added a little white wine in place of water, used 1/4 of a cup less olive oil...tad more mustard and to make it a bit more sweet and spicy I added a squeeze of a agave and a splash of tabasco. My hubby even liked it and he usually only likes standard oil and vinegar. I might make it again. I do have an entire bottle in the fridge now which should keep for sometime. I poured the dressing over a kale and romaine bed with grilled chicken, tomato, red bell pepper, mushroom salad topped with fresh parm. Not a bad lunch.

I made a healthier version. I used basil pesto and reduced olive oil. I replaceed cream with nonfat yoghurt. This was good!

This is the perfect, perfect, perfect mustard potato salad. Yummy! I roast the potatoes in a hot oven to give it a little more oomph. I also double the herbs and throw in a good bunch of clipped chives. I am not sure what the others had done wrong because this is far from oily. If you emulsify the dressing properly it is the consistency of mayonnaise and coats the potatoes beautifully. Use really good fruity olive oil otherwise you are going to miss the mark. I prefer this to be served at room temp tossed with capers. Perfect for those hot summer BBQ's. Enjoy!

Was looking for something to go with salmon croquettes, this seemed like a good mix of starch and salad. Like the previous reviewers, I used just a fraction of the oil (1/4 to 1/3 cup--it emulsified more than enough as it was!). It still tasted a bit too oil-heavy, so I added a little horseradish and a tiny bit of honey, which evened it out nicely. Tossed in one sweet potato with the others, all in all a nice blend-- a good complement to the savory fish croquettes.

My family, guests, and I liked this recipe a lot more than the other reviewers -- delicious, and a nice, contemporary gloss on potato salad. I balked at so much olive oil, and used only about a half cup. I suspect that the dressing might have emulsified thicker if I'd used more oil, although I think you'd need an egg yolk to get it really mayonnaise-y. In any event, it came out fine with the lesser amount of oil. I definitely liked, and would recommend, the romaine with it; this made a good, fresh offset to the heavier potatoes, and looked appetizing as well. The potatoes were room temperature, a good move.

I'm enjoying the leftovers right now! Yum. I thought this was a great and different potato salad. I made the following changes to the recipe: I decreased the oil in the potato dressing and used only a 1/4 cup and doubled the mustard and cream. I also used almost an entire bottle of capers. I did make the romaine lettuce salad, but when I make this the next time, I will omit that part of it. It did not add anything to the overall dish. I served this potato salad with grilled steak and ranch beans. It would go well with grilled chicken, too.

This recipe was a disappointment. You can do a lot more things with red skin potatoes. It was dry and bland. Don't waste your time preparing this one.

OK, but very very rich dressing - there are several commercial potato salad dressings that are better. Dousing the warm potatoes liberally with vinegar and increasing the amount of capers goes part of the way towards balancing up the heaviness of olive oil and cream. The recipe for the dressing makes about 3 times the amount required for this quantity of potatoes.
