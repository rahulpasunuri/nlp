I did not follow the recipe exactly. I browned the meatballs and then baked them at 350. I then de-glazed the pan with some sherry and spaghetti water (the water from the boiled spaghetti). When I plated, I garnished with some chopped fresh basil and oregano and extra virgin olive oil. The sauce needed more oil because I did not cook the meatballs in it.

We used ground turkey and turkey sausage instead of the other proteins mentioned, but other than that, we followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. Would definitely make this again, but I may add tomato paste to thicken it more next time around. Survey said - ages 3 to 63 - PERFECTO!

Excellent meatball recipe - loved the brightness the lemon zest adds! I eliminated the ground veal (don't agree in supporting veal production in this country) and went with 2 pds each of pork and beef. I used my own tomato sauce recipe which is more herb-rich and includes tomatoes, and added some fresh basil to the meatballs and it was simply delicious! I also used prepared bread crumbs rather than the bread/milk combo in the recipe and that worked fine as well. Fresh oregano is definitely worth it. YUM!! This is my new go-to meatball recipe!

This meatball recipe is a real gift for our working family. When I can carve out a few hours on a Sunday I make them and freeze enough for many emergency weeknight dinners. My toddlers devour them, a rare event indeed. I've made them with ground pork and subbed with sausage once - the ground pork ones are better (much more tender). Otherwise, I'm pretty faithful - except that I always bake them at about 360 for 30 minutes, turning once. Makes about 7 dozen 2" meatballs. So, so good!

Yes the former reviewer is correct. Unfortunately the recipe leaves out salt and pepper--it's only in the body of the recipe--so the cook really needs to have his/her thinking cap on. That aside, the recipe is excellent/delicious. Today I am making the meatballs out of ground dark turkey meat, not for spaghetti, but for turkey soup! Yes this is a very versatile recipe indeed. Just don't forget the salt and pepper!

I love this recipe, but the salt and pepper additions are in the body of the recipe, not in the ingredients list. Tonight I accidentally left the salt and pepper out of the meatballs, sadly.

I halved the recipe and my meatballs came out tasting great but my one complaint is they didn't hold their shape. Generally, I only strongly agree with the statement 'You eat with your eyes.' right after I've made something really pretty but I made this for my blog, Spoons to Sporks, and disc-like meatballs wasn't what I had in mind.

BY FAR THE BEST MEATBALLS....EVER! I consider myself a MB connoisseur. They were extremely tender and super flavorful! I reduced recipe to 1/3 and could have fed 4-5 people. Didn't make sauce, used Prego. Don't hate me, Prego is delicious! I was just going to use store bought bread crumbs but everyone raved on their reviews so I thought I should give it a go. I'm so glad I did. My bread was fresh so I let it sit out to dry out a bit, but the crust parts were a bit chewy in the MB, but hardly noticeable. Don't change the recipe, do it like it says.

Excellent recipe! Reduced all ingredients by a third for three adults, three children and leftovers. For the meat proportion, we used 1# 80/20 ground beef and 1/2# ground pork. For the bread/milk mixture, finely chopped about 1.c nice artisan white bread and added 2-3 Tbsp of half-and- half. Mashed it up well to get it good and soaked, and added that mixture to the meat w/o draining. Easy! Formed meatballs about 2 Tbsp in size (yield ~45 meatballs), placed on parchment on 1/2 sheet, and pan browned meatballs on stove with ~2 Tbsp olive oil. Used same pan until all batches were cooked/browned. Set meatballs on a dbl-thickness paper towel lined sheet pan, covered all with heavy tin foil, and placed in oven at 150F until ready to serve. The cheese contains salt, and it may affect how much salt you wish to add to the mix at the end. I'll lighten the overall salt next time. Everyone was absolutely thrilled with the recipe, with seconds and thirds for all at our dinner table. Definitely try this recipe!

A quarter of the recipe will make enough food for 6 people. Excellent meatball recipe, I've done it a few times already. I made the meatballs bigger than a golf ball, about 1 1/2" across and baked for about 20 minutes at 350F, turning once on the 10 minute mark. They came out juicy and nicely browned.

I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes and added fresh oregano into the sauce. I used 2lbs ground veal and 1 1/4 lbs ground pork and beef. The rest of the recipes, I followed to the T.

I love is simple sauce recipe, and when I have time e meatballs are phenomenal. The sauce consistently gets compliments from guests and family members alike, and the meatballs freeze great. I like to add a little extra lemon zest to brighten up the meatballs a bit, but that's just my preference! Both Freeze great, we make a double batch of meatballs and pop them in the vacuum packer, stack em in the freezer and they just need to be tawed in the sauce for the next spaghetti night. Yum Yum Yum!!!

What a fantastic base recipe! The panade really helps to keep the meat moist as well as ensure the seasonings are distributed throughout. I made half my first batch following the recipe's seasoning to a "T"(very unusual for me,LOL); 2nd half had additional seasonings in the form of red pepper flakes, pine nuts and golden raisins. Just lovely and a quick heads up: this recipe freezes well. I plan to serve the frozen batch when I go camping and forego Dinty Moore stew ;).

I've tried lots of Italian pasta recipes and even experimented with a few of my own creating, but this is by far the best meatball recipe I've ever tried. I make a couple of substitutions (I opt for all beef with no pork, and add some basil to the recipe, baking instead of frying), but without any major tweaking it's been my go-to recipe for the last year. The soaked bread adds an exquisite moisture to these meatballs that makes them substantial, but also beautifully light. This recipe satisfies even the heartiest appetites around my house, and a range of taste preferences. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe!

We really enjoyed this spaghetti recipe but we made some deviations. First, I prepare a larger portion since my family has an extreme appetite. Second, I added mozzarella partially and the rest is cheddar. My three-year old son enjoyed putting some cheeze in. We will surely cook this again coupled with delightful dessert which you can find at http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/tiramisu. Really an enjoying meal!

After DYING to find THE BEST meatball recipe ever, I tried this after reading all of the great reviews. WOW... I made it (halved) THREE TIMES in one week over the Christmas holiday! Here are the "tweaks" I made: absolutely added fresh basil to both the sauce and the meatballs. After learning an Italian restaurant owners "top meatball secret," I too added raisins (golden) to my meatballs. Sounds crazy, but I soaked about 10 oz of goldens, popped them in the micro for about 30 seconds to fatten them up, and added them to the meatball mixture. Even people who claim to hate raisins raved over the subtle sweetness. Instead of using whole milk to soak my bread, I used buttermilk at another reviewer's suggestion. The last time I made these meatballs, I replaced the group pork with mild ground sausage, then OOPS! Forgot the eggs all together! Ultimately, they were the best meatballs I've made so far. Also, like many other reviewers, I found that frying them was not the way to go. Either stuck to the pan like h*ll or were WAAAAY too greasy. Baked 1.5 to 2 inch meatballs at 375 for about 30 minutes total. I turned them for even cooking in 10 minute intervals. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this receipe!

Very very very good recipe!!! That being said, there a few things that I thought needed to be modified. First of all oh my goodness halve the salt in the sauce!!! You will ruin your sauce if you use the full amount. Second of all, use a much smaller amount of milk to moisten the bread, otherwise the mixture is way too wet, even with squeezing it out and all. Also, having both fried and baked the meatballs, I find baking them was much better due to the fact that the meatballs have so much cheese in them that they stuck like crazy to the pan when frying despite using lots of oil to fry them up. Also, don't skimp on buying the fresh flat leaf parsley....I made the meatballs once with and once without the parsley and believe me, the batch WITH parsley was so much better!! And....don't be fooled by the deceptively simple sauce-at first I thought "Ugh it's too plain" but you know what? It's the simplicity of the sauce that works so well with the delicious meatballs.....keep your doctored up sauce recipe and make it sometimes, and then for something different, make this uncomplicated sauce and killer meatballs....they are SO GOOD.

This is the best recipe for meatballs I have ever used. They come out perfectly each time, particularly if you use the "claw" method described in his article (position your fingers like a claw to combine ingredients, and only combine as minimally necessary). I prefer using linguine over spaghetti and the recipe for sauce/meatballs freezes easily. Highly recommend!

Excellent recipe as written, especially the meatballs. I have made this many times and to put it completely over the top, substitute panko (not very italian I realize) for bread crumbs and soak in buttermilk or heavy cream (about two thirds of the stated amount of milk). You'll never make a meatball any other way.

Sauce was extremely salty, even though I cut the salt in half. Would recommend doing 1/3 the salt listed and then adjusting to your preference. Meatballs had a great texture.

I am NOT a fan of meatballs. But reading this over, I had to try it. Made only 2/3 of recipe and still got 75. Added a bit of Italian seasoning, but otherwise stuck to it as written (oh yes, used a mild pork breakfast sausage instead of the ground pork.) Well, now I am a fan of meatballs, these. Oh yes, if you want to have them taste well over the top, have a lovely Italian Opera on when cooking - it makes ALL the difference. Foodies, delight - this is a keeper.

As other reviewers have said this is a great recipe, but takes a fair bit of time. But since I made the recipe as stated, I was able to freeze many a meat ball & containers of sauce for future meals. I followed the recipe as is with a couple of minor changes. Sauce: the key to getting a rich, flavoural sauce is to simmer way longer than they suggest. I made mine in the early afternoon and let is simmer for 5 hours. The sauce will turn a much deeper red and the water will slowly evaporate. I did almost double the garlic. If I had had any red wine I would have added that as well. Meatballs: used less salt (4 rather than 5 1/2 tsp). Next time I will decrease it even further. I will also next time use less milk. As long as there is enough to coat the bread that is enough (since it is thrown out anyway). It took me a bit of time to get the hang of frying them. I think the key is to create a very tight ball prior to frying and follow the instruction to not overload the pan. I did feel they were a bit greasier than I would have liked, so I may try baking them next time instead. Also sounds easier, as from my perspective the work really was in frying them.

Excellent! I'm not a lover of Italian food but decided to give this a try anyway. I deviated from the recipe here and there (a little less meat, a little more Parmesan, bigger meatballs...). WOW! I've never been impressed by pasta and red sauce but this was so delicious! The meatballs were so juicy and tender...WOW again! I was worried there would be little flavor because the sauce is so simple but I was wrong. I did used fire roasted tomatoes and added a bit more pepper, a pinch of chili powder, and some extra sea salt for good measure. Sure to delight the tastebuds! I reserved the extra sauce and meatballs for sandwiches the next day. A real hit with the family and sure to make for some jealous co-workers.

Sauce - I included garlic and red wine before adding the tomatoes. I also added a small can of tomato paste. Can't imagine sauce w/o mushrooms . . . Used fire roasted crushed canned tomatoes with basil. Meatballs - I followed reviewer's advice and used sweet italian sausage - good advice. I only made a 1/3 of the recipe. I had fresh oregano and sage on hand so I added this to the sauce and meatballs. Not as much sage as oregano though. Also used bread crumbs. My meatballs turned out a bit moist but they were still yummy. I could see ultimately searing the meatballs and then putting in the oven to bake - as you like; they're still good just baking! Very very yummy - in my opinion the red vino is a must!

I unhesitatingly say that these are some of the b e s t meatballs I've ever, ever made, and now that I have this recipe, will continue to make time and again. Meatballs are kind of like the little black dress of comfort food -- done right, they can make an entire meal perfect. And that is just what these meatballs did for an array of otherwise almost forgettable dishes. I skipped the pasta (why bother?), and just served these straight from the pot with their sauce and a side of some crusty bread. If there had been any left over after a party of eight or so people (I halved the recipe), I can see how these would be awesome in a sandwich or stromboli. I made these the night before a party; the day they had to sit, hang out, and develop richer flavor probably made them even better.

These meatballs were great! I fried some, and baked some. My husband actually prefered the baked meatballs so that is what I am going to do in the future. I used all beef.

San Marzano tomatoes are packed in puree so they can foil a tariff imposed in 1989. Thus, they are imported as a sauce and taste "cooked" not fresh. Best I've had is Muir Glen organic.

Made the same recipe twice, each time varying the ingredients. First time, just as written. Good, but on the second round, I used half the cheese, added a bunch of basil, more fresh oregano, and about 1/4 cup of Spaghetti sauce. The second batch was much more flavorful and the family agreed to keep the second recipe for the future. We made about 50-55 meatballs per batch. (Freeze for meatball subs the next day) Maybe mine were a little larger than the recipe's? Anyway, this is a good recipe to start out with and to experiment with. Try it, you'll like it.

I made the meatballs only. They are delicious and freeze very well. The lemon zest adds a night, bright flavor (but not too much for my lemon zest-averse husband). I considered baking instead of frying, but frying gave them a nice, browned, slightly crisp crust. This is added to our rotation.

I made the meatballs only. After having tried some veal & pork meatballs at a local restaurant that were terrific - I decided to do the same with this recipe. I used the same total amount of meat, but split it evenly between pork and veal. It came out awesome and is certainly an option if you're trying to cut back on red meat consumption. That's not the case for me, I just felt the veal/pork meatballs were even more flavorful than with the red meat. If you really like the red meat, you might try serving these with a bolognese sauce. I also doubled the size of the meatballs. As a result the correct cooking time in the sauce is about 45-50 minutes.

I haven't made the sauce yet and have never made good meatballs - until now. To all the reviewers who don't find the seasoning to their taste,fry a spoonful of the mixture, taste and correct before making upbthe balls eg try w less salt/lemon and add more or paprika fennel chilli whatever your taste buds say. I used what I had a little less beef and pork and one cup of parmessan

The meatballs came out tender and juicy...mouthwatering aromas and very nice texture. I used an ice cream scoop to get even amounts, rolled them about with wet hands to shape them, then set them on wax-paper lined baking sheets and put them in the fridge to set for about 20-30 minutes. I increased the amount of chopped parsley and omitted the grated lemon zest. Still very flavorful without the lemon zest, but will try this recipe again with the zest. Used panko bread crumbs and it helped make the meatballs lighter and more delicate in texture. I just used my own homemade marinara sauce which elevated the meal to an ethereal experience.

This recipe, despite all of the rave reviews was just ok. I made it exactly as written. The meatballs were ok. I liked the lemon zest. The texture was nice as well. The seasoning was mild and interesting but not amazing. The sauce was very average, but improved with cooking with the meatballs in it. The sauce looked very nice and authentic but again, was fairly bland. No one in my family was very impressed. We like robust flavorings, especially in Italian or ethnic food and this just wasn't what we wanted. If you like your food less intense this would be ideal.

I also only made the meatballs (1/2 the recipe). I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes as the other reviewers suggested - much easier. I think I will omit the lemon zest next time - it was too noticeable. Even cutting the recipe in half, I ended up with about 54 meatballs.

I thought the amount of salt in this recipe was nuts. That being said, I loved the recipe, once I cut the salt down! I used only lean ground turkey, soaked twiggy whole grain bread in low-fat buttermilk. WOW,I was pleasantly surprised to find how delicious the meatballs still were. I took it to some friends' and they loved it too. This sauce is a take on Marcella Hazan's simple tomato sauce, so I just used that one and added some fresh garlic. Really delicate and bursting with that summery tomato taste. Our friends had some Barilla Whole Grain pasta and it was good, not gummy like a lot of the healthy pastas.

I halved the recipe. I used fresh bread crumbs so didn't soak the bread with milk; instead, I added 1/2 cup of milk directly to the meatball mixture. Saved time, not as messy. Used a microplane for the lemon zest, so had a very fine zest - I thought the amount of zest was perfect. I made my meatballs a bit larger than prescribed, and had no problems with them falling apart. Great flavor - best recipe I've found for meatballs. I thought the sauce was a bit watery, even after simering far longer than the recipe required. I might use a different sauce next time, or perhaps just not add back all of the juice from the drained tomatoes. All in all, very tasty!

I used 5 cans of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of diced (my son doesn't like it too chunky) and also added dried oregano, basil and two bay leaves.

I halved this recipe, using 1 1/2 lbs. ground round and 3/4 lb. ground turkey. I forgot to add the parmesan-reggiano, but the meatballs were still delicious and held together just fine. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to brown the meatballs in a 400 degree oven for 15+ mins, and it was less of a mess and worked beautifully. The meatballs are definitely the best part of this recipe. I found the sauce benefitted from about 1/4 tsp. Yeni Raki (Turkish version of Ouzo). I will probably make just the meatballs again in the future -- remembering the parmesan next time. :)

Awesomely good. It is just my husband and I so I made the entire batch of meatballs but upped the size of the meatballs to approx. 2 1/2 in. rounds. Because of this I cooked the meatballs slightly longer in the oven and on the stove. Once I made all the meatballs and the sauce I put 2 person portions in food saver bags and froze the majority of the meatballs in sauce. The ones we ate that night were melt in your mouth delicious. On nights when I am rushed I now pull out one of the meatball bags and throw it in a pot of boiling water with the noodles in the same pot...when the noodles are done the meatballs are thawed and heated through. quick 10 min. gourmet meals all because I took an extra hour the day I made the dish to freeze most of it. (This dish made approx. 20 meals for my husband and I)

My favorite meatball recipe. I prefer crushed tomatoes and agree with other reviewers that the sauce starts out thin but thickens up nicely with the addition of the meatballs and increased simmering time. I've made it multiple times with different meat combinations (turkey, meatloaf mix, all beef, etc.) and have loved it each time. Also agreed that it's the lemon zest that dials these meatballs up to eleven. It's a time commitment, this recipe, but it's worth it a few times a year, especially if you have lots of Tupperware on hand for freezing leftovers. Meatball subs on day 2 is a must. Enjoy!

I thought these meatballs were delicious, however I did make some changes. I used gluten free bread crumbs and swapped the lemon zest for nutmeg (i got the idea for nutmeg from another recipe for meatballs years ago and i love what it adds). I also baked the meatballs for a few minutes on each side in the oven, then slow cooked them in the sauce for several hours in a cast iron pot. For the sauce I added chopped italian parsley and some red wine. I also froze almost 4 small bags of meatballs, uncooked, to use for future use.

Even better than the first time we made it. We discovered that buying the expensive tomatoes in juice yielded a thicker sauce (first time around we used store brand). It was still a little thin for our American tastebuds so we used a few pulses of the immersion blender to thicken it up. Worked perfectly. We also don't eat veal (out of protest) and can't buy ground pork without the veal so just had all-beef meatballs. Guests couldn't stop raving. I've no doubt it would be even better with the pork and veal. This is a fun family recipe that everyone can be involved in.

This is a delicious recipe. Everyone simply loved the meatballs. There were only 4 of us and we went through 2lbs of spaghetti. What I also loved about this recipe was using my hands. It's very tactile and fun to crush the tomatoes by hand and then mix the meat and form the meatballs by hand. This is comfort food at its best.

This is definitely the BEST spaghetti sauce I've ever had! I also couldn't find ground veal so I used half ground beef and half ground pork. Someone said their sauce was too watery ... I thought that too until after I added the meatballs and cooked for about 30 minutes more. That really thickened up the sauce. Also make sure you don't have it down too low when you're simmering. You want to see steady small bubbles. This sauce is even better the next day!

This is THE best spaghetti and meatballs recipe I have ever made. I used ground turkey instead of the veal and the meatballs were excellent.

Parm/Reggiono cheese is a must. This makes a huge amount of meatballs and they freeze very well.

Excellent and will definitely make again. Followed the recipe exactly except could not get ground veal. Also halved it because I was worried my pot would not be big enough which I think lead to shorter cooking time because it only took me about 2-2.5 hours.

Made these last night to use with tomato sauce I made and froze last summer. They were great! I cut the recipe by thirds, roughly, as there was no crowd. Rave reviews here; meatballs were light and tasty.

This is the third time I've written to praise this recipe--the first time I made it, for a New Year's supper, it was an enormous hit. There was so much sauce and meatballs, tho, that I served 12, and froze enough sauce and balls for 3 more meals! Tonight I am using the last of the meatball mixture for the Gourmet Unstuffed Sweet & Sour Cabbage! The parmesan in the meat might be a little strange, but the sauce seems just wonderful. I used white raisins instead of cranberries and cider vinegar instead of red wine, because that's what I have on hand...but it seems to be OK. I 'm serving it with mashed potatoes and homemade applesauce. Should keep us toasty tonight!

We followed the recipe exactly and it is what it says it is: a classic comfort meal. The flavors mature and meld deliciously the second day, so if time allows, make this a day in advance.

I made this for our family, the meatballs were excellent. The sauce was too watery. I would make this again, but would not use tomatoes in juice. I would use puree or add some tomatoe paste to thickent the sauce. I also cooked it looker than suggested, to try to thicken, but it did not work.

I've made spaghetti and meatballs plenty of times without following a recipe so I wanted to see if these would turn out any better. My husband raved about it! I used my immersion blender to puree the sauce (we don't like big pieces of onion in our tomato sauce). I was also skeptical about the meat blend, as I usually just use ground beef.Turned out just fine...Next time I'll chop the onions a little finer for the meatballs.

Great meatballs! I cut down on the fat by omitting the pork and using all lean ground beef. I did not "deep fry" the meatballs, I simply fried them in the own juices. Were excellent with tons of flavour. The lemon zest is lovely.

No complaints here. the whole recipe turned out perfectly. we cut it into thirds and still had enough pasta and meatballs to feed an army. we did take the advice of one cook and baked the meatballs in the oven for 15+ minutes at 400. we turned them once to make sure they browned all over. we did not have any problems with them falling apart.

Rating: 3
Good but not great. The meatballs had good flavor, but tended to fall apart in the sauce--maybe I should have browned them longer than the recommended 5 minutes. The sauce was very salty, and also quite thin, even though I simmered it quite a bit longer than directed. I may make the meatballs again, but use my own sauce recipe next time.

VERY good meatballs. A few reviewers said it already, and I agree, that the recipes for both meatballs and sauce call for too much salt. Since I made the sauce first, I wised up and added less salt (perhaps 1/2 of what was called for) for the meatballs and they turned out wonderfully.

the meatballs are delicious!! Rave reviews from my company!

Totally too salty in both the sauce and the meatballs. Cut salt in half.

Was well worth the effort! I made the full batch and served them as dinner for 4, then dinner for 8 the next night, then dinner for 2 of us the night after, then a couple meatball subs... and still had plenty left to freeze! We're huge garlic fans, and these meatballs satisfied our cravings! They did not last long in the freezer... we ate them all within the month! I will definitely be making these again soon!

Was very good. Forgot to put in my zest but it was great without. The sauce was a tad waery but not bad. Used the San Marzano which are superior to regular stewed tomatoes. Found with using sea salt that the sauce was a tad salty for my family's taste but we are not big salt users. Will make again. My picky mother came to dinner and raved about it, not something she does often. The meatballs are the star as mentioned in other posts.

Excellent! The meat balls are tender, juicy and the lemon zest adds an unexpected citrusy note! I used whole tomatoes which I blanch and freeze in 1lb batches. This probably made my sauce much thicker than most, and with the recipe making SO MUCH, I had to keep adding ck stock to the sauce everytime I had leftovers! Added to my permanent recipe box!

This recipe is a classic and one I will make over and over again. I only made half and it is still a ton of food! The lemon zest adds such nice freshness to the meatballs. I added some chopped parsley to garnish.

I served this for Sunday night dinner and it was a HUGE hit with everyone, even my carb-phobic friend couldn't resist. I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 veal, as well I followed a previous reviewers suggestion to bake them instead of frying to save time. Deliscious!

If your sauce is too thin, try adding tomato paste 1 TBS at a time. It won't take away from the flavors and it will thicken it right up.

Rating: 4
I made this to serve to my family as they are meatball lovers. I halved the meatballs and followed the recipe. To save time, I cooked half as directed in the frying pan and the other half, I baked at 400 for @ 15 minutes and both were good. I plan to freeze the half that I baked. I made my own sauce which was not that different than the recipe but added garlic, parsley, a few chili flakes, mushrooms and a handful of fresh basil at the end. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds so will make it again.

Just finished eating these meatballs and I must say this is the best recipe I have ever used. They were lite in texture and not at all greasy with a wonderful lemon-and- herb zingey flavor. I followed the recipe as indicated, however I used a bit less meat overall (I ran out). I also used my local farmstand's torn rustic style bead crumbs rather than day-old italian. I baked them on parchment-covered trays in a 350 convection oven for 22 minutes instead of sauteing them in hopes of shaving some prep time off and I ended up only spending an hour or so from start to when I put the second batch in the oven. I didn't even bother to cook the spaghetti I had purchased, my husband and I feasted on meatballs and sauce with some bread. The lemon zest really made them sing, if I had used more meat, I bet the flavor would have been a bit less pronouced and more even. I also sauteed all the onions and garlic for both sauce and meatballs and then just set aside 1/2 for the meatballs to save time. I used the San Marzano crushed tomatoes (rather than whole) and the sauce had a beautiful even consistancy and was not watery. I suspect others may have different results with other brands. I eneded up with 78 meatballs and probably a gallon of sauce!

Regarding comments about the sauce being watery: I have made this twice now. The first time I used a store brand of canned plum tomatoes labeled "in the style of San Marzano." The juice the tomatoes were packed in was fairly watery and even after over 2 hours of simmering the sauce was still a bit watery. The second time I made it I spent a little more and bought Cento brand San Marzano tomatoes (the can is 35 oz however, so you can get away with one less). This made all of the difference in the world. The juice was very thick and the sauce simmered to a delicious and thick consistency in under one hour. So yummy and easy--although it is a lot of garlic to dice! I can't say these are the BEST meatballs I've ever had but they are light and moist and I will make them again. The other comments regarding the time required to make this are right on--it turned into a bigger project than I had anticipated.

This was so perfectly delicious! There was nothing but yummy noises at the table... and then midnight footsteps to the refrigerator...followed by meatball sandwiches with mozarella,grilled...perfection

Really delicious! I wasn't sure that I'd make it again because it certainly takes a while to make (about 2 1/2 hours active time), but once we tried it I knew that I'd definitely make it again! Used 4 cans crushed tomatoes and 2 cans diced (next time will do 3 of each) a little extra garlic and some dried basil in the sauce. It was thick and yummy! As we don't eat veal, I used 3 lbs. of ground beef and 2 lbs. of pork and omitted the veal. The meatballs were great - I love the zing that the lemon zest gave them! (Who would have thought!) Overall a great spaghetti and meatball recipe!

Best meatballs I've ever made. If your sauce is thin, just simmer it awhile longer. Duh.

I followed the recipe as written. The sauce was way too watery, and both the sauce and the meatballs were WAY too salty. The recipe also makes enough for closer to 20 people. This was also a labor-intensive pasta dish. Will not make again--do not recommend at all.

This is a FABULOUS recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the pork with no detriment whatsoever. Meatballs are light, tender -- just wonderful. MAYBE reduce the garlic by 20% or use smaller cloves than I did. This is SPICY. All that said, I don't know how Gourmet times its recipes. The two hours is way short of actual time to get it to the stove, even with all the veggies prepped. Fair warning!

Great recipe. I cut the recipe in half, and still had tons of leftovers. I felt it got better the following day, after sitting in the pot overnight. My sauce was quite thick. I used some reserved pasta water to thin it. Great recipe! Time consuming, I would make it the day before for a dinner party.

Sauce is very thin. Anyone have any suggestions for making the sauce a bit thicker? We pureed the tomatoes but it's still a bit thin for our taste.

Don't ever tell my boyfriend's Sicilian mother but I swear this is the best spaghetti and meatball recipe EVER. I made it with the minestrone soup from the same issue of Gourmet and it was the best Italian meal I've had in a while. Lots of left over meatballs made fantastic sandwiches the next day. It's worth the time. You won't be disappointed.

Excellent sauce! and so easy. Must use San Marzano if you can find them--don't be afraid to pay more it is worth the extra dollar. Meatballs were very good- next time I'll add more lemon zest. I used fresh herbs from my garden and the best Parmigiano I could find. This does yield a lot of meatballs but I love having extra.

Used by own sauce but the meatball recipe is fantastic. Moist, tender and just the ticket on a cold Montreal Saturday. Everyone at dinner raved.

I am the person who wrote in after I made this but before I served it. I did that last night, to a dozen people, and I have to say it was an outstanding success! The sauce is uncomplicated and simply delicious, and the meatballs are luscious. Two people told me that it was the best spaghetti and meatballs they ever had, and, when everyone was finished, there was actually a call for me to cook more pasta!! Like I said, the recipe makes an enormous amount of sauce and meatballs--I froze 3 baggies of it, and have an entire tupperware container of meatball meat I'll either freeze or make into a meatloaf tomorrow. Great way to start the culinary new year!

I just finished making this recipe for a new year's party tomorrow--so I haven't actually EATEN it yet-- but, although it's a bit of a mess, I think it going to be delicious. The meatballs are going to be very succulent, and the sauce tastes great--with such simple ingredients. The only kind of San Marzano tomtoes I could find were in tomato puree, not juice--but I don't think it's going to make a difference. I did want to say that the meatball recipe makes waaaaay more than you need for the sauce. I put almost half of it away for a meatloaf over the weekend. Happy New Year!

The best spaghetti and meatballs I have had. The sauce was terrific and the meatballs were fabulous. Put half in the freezer and the other half served six with leftovers. Absolutely worth the time in the kitchen.

This recipe was just ok. The sauce was not very thick and was just good for coating the noodles. I ended up making more sauce using a different recipe to spoon over the individual servings. I also prefer when the meatballs are cooked in the sauce rather than fried in oil. I wouldn't say it's a bad recipe but I won't be trying it again.

This is the perfect Spaghetti and meatballs! I have tried many different recipes and this is by far the best. It makes an absolute TON of food so it is great for a party, but even if you make it for your family you can make several dinners out of it. I made it for 8 people, 5 adults and 3 kids, and i think that I have about 3 dinners left out of it.
