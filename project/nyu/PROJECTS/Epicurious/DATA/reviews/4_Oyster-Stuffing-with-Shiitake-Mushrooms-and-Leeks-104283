Was delicious and very easy! We got to the store late around Thanksgiving, and everywhere had completely run out of everything but white button mushrooms, so I had to make due. Still turned out great, but I can't wait to try with shiitake.

Have made for years. The shiitake mushrooms with the oysters gives such a unique earthy flavor. Don't be afraid to try. You won't be disappointed.

absolutely the best oyster stuffing recipe I've ever made. The shiitake mushrooms and leeks really make this dish unique. I leave the oysters whole, as I like to taste their flavor. My guests never fail to ask for seconds.

i did this at christmas instead of traditional dressing. I did add some cornbread dried pieces as well. And used fresh oysters ($$$$). I thaught it was unbelievable, but if yur serving it for more 'pedestrian' peeps, i'd suggest boxed stuffing. As this does have a flavour that is appeasing to a gourmand and not a gastronomic laymen.

We had a stuffing contest at my Thanksgiving party. This won.

Excellent! A huge hit at dinner. I doubled the amount of oysters and only cut them in half rather than in smaller bits. I loved the earthiness of the mushrooms.

We had this with Christmas dinner and many thought it was the best part of the meal.

Fantastic recipe. I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it (especially my husband). He asked me to make more tonight! Only two things I'd suggest to make this recipe better: 1. Use 3 cans of oysters if you like seafood-- we do and I still couldn't differentiate when I bit into an oyster even though I used 24 oz. 2. Use less liquid. I would have only used 1/2 or 3/4 cup of stock if I would have known how soggy this was going to turn out. I solved the issue by baking it uncovered for about 10 minutes after the initial 45 minutes. Excellent recipe.

I added a couple diced granny smith apples as one reviewer suggested, and it was a great touch. I also prefer smaller bread cubes. With fresh herbs it would be really fabulous, but we only had dried on hand.

I make this every year in addition to a tradition dressing and everyone finished this oyster dish first. It is a Thanksgiving tradition and I make it according to the recipe. Excellent.

Very good. Had requests from guests for "take-home" containers. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was divine. I will definitely not wait a year to make this again!

I made this one year for friends and family members who don't like oysters and they were skeptical. They loved it and now request it and I've now been making this for about five years to rave reviews.

This has become our traditional Thanksgiving stuffing from the first time we made it!

I won't cut the oysters up next time. Instead, I will just put the oysters in whole. I really like biting into an oyster and recognizing its texture and taste. Other than that, this was excellent. I wanted to do 3.5 forks.

I make this every year, and this year nobody even touched the "regular" stuffing--they've all been converted to this dish. I usually add more reserved oyster liquid than it calls for, but it's four forks exactly as written, too.

I made this for a large Thanksgiving gathering. It was a hit. I can't personally attest to what it tastes like because I am allergic to oysters. So, I'll skip the fork rating. But, everyone that had it, had seconds. And, it smelled divine.

I've made this dish the last 4 Thanksgivings and have always received rave reviews. Even my dad, who hates oysters and seafood of any kind, asked for seconds and thirds. The only change I made was to bake all of the stuffing in a pan-- I don't like actually stuffing the bird.

I added diced granny smith apples to this (cooked them along with the celery and onion) and was very pleased! The apples added a tartness that cut the fishy taste, and really balanced it out. My guests were skeptical and then very surprised at how much they enjoyed it.

I made this the last 2 years for Thanksgiving, this will be the third.Even those who don't like oyster loved it.The flavor and texture are a wonderful change from grandma's oyster stuffing.

I'd rate it lower than 1 if that was a choice. Made this for Christmas dinner. Very fishy tasting and smelly. Based on another reviewer who said their Asian relatives liked it, I chose this stuffing. Well, my Asian relatives hated it and the only 2 people who liked it were Caucasians--and they were probably being polite.

After reading the great reviews I decided on this for Thanksgiving. Great decision. Even people who think they don't like oysters liked this stuffing. It was great on day after turkey sandwiches too.

I made this stuffing instead of my mother's oyster stuffing and it was much better (sorry mom!). I stuffed the bird with the stuffing and smoked it for 12 hours- it was incredible and will become a standard on my Thanksgiving menu.

This is a great recipe! This is the third year we will be serving it. Family members are now requesting the dish so it has quickly become a tradition!

I made this for my Chinese parents and grandma and they really liked it. The shitake mushrooms and oysters give it a wonderfully Asian taste to appease their Chinese palettes. Two weeks after I made it for them, they requested it again for another family party. Fresh oysters are definitely key. I used plain white sandwich bread the first time but I found sourdough bread was better the second time.

Found recipe a bit wet. Would place all of the stuffing in casserole dish so that it dries out a bit. The stuffing in the bird was much wetter than the other. Everyone loved it and were surprised by how much flavour there was.

This is the absolut best stuffing. I first cooked it last Christmas. I has become a must have on my menu.

This is a *MUST HAVE* for your Thanksgiving table. I used this recipe last year and my husband was willing to admit it was a contender against his mother's family stuffing recipe. Subtle, rich flavors, not complicated to make on a busy Thanksgiving day menu. Creates a wonderful savory aroma throughout the house as it cooks in the turkey.

This recipe is perfect if you want to try something new, yet don't want to get too far away from a traditional stuffing. It's also good with Portabellos instead of Shiitakes and I usually add the giblets and heart also.

This was a big hit at our Christmas dinner. The shitake mushrooms gave it a great flavor.
