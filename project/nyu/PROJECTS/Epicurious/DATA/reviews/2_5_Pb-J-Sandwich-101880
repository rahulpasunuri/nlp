I haven't made this recipe and i'm not going to, so I can't give it a fork rating. Just thought I'd post to question to wisdom of anyone eating something this sugary, fatty, and calorific. Sure, adding a little bit of fat and sugar can make an ordinary dish delicious, but I just can't conceive of a palate that'd find that much gunk in one dish appealing. Guess that's just me though....

This was very good. Why does one (or 2?) person (people) have to ruin it for everyone by posting the same comment 10 times? Please respect the nature of the ratingsreviews and give your opinion only once. Did you even actually make the recipe, Detroit, or did you just read the ingredients and decide it was "gross"?

Very good recipe. A little high on the cholesterol but well worth it, I make this for my son and daughter (6 and 8 years of age) every Monday to take to school, to provide some relief from the regular tedium. I find that you do not need this many eggs - there was a great deal left over and I think that 4 eggs and 1 cup heavy cream (or half-and-half) would suffice. Don't skimp on the maple syrup though. The first time I made this recipe I did not use strawberries as they weren't in season, but some advice to everyone out there, DON'T leave them out! This is WAY better with them in there. I will never leave them out again! Lastly - brioche is good for this, but I prefer focaccia, or sometimes a flour tortilla.

Don't let the long list of ingredients fool you. This was very easy to make and everyone raved. What a delightful way to breath new life into an old favorite! Couldn't find banana ice cream so I used cinnamon- fabulous!! Will make again and again and again.......
