Tasted good, but they were a gooey mess after over 2 hrs. in refrigerator; will not make them again. Guess I prefer more cakey-brownies to the fudgy ones.

As Emeril would say, I kicked them up a notch by using Scharfenberger 62% chocolate instead of the chips. Also, in the genache used 5 oz of the Scharfenberger. Chopped up Heath bars and Trader joe's toasted slivered almonds kicked it up another notch.Done perfectly in 45 minutes. Rich, decadent...a cross between brownies and fudge. How good is that as Ina would say. Going into my brownie collection.

Excellent! Really fudgy and not too sweet. Think I might try a 9x13" pan next time to make them a little thinner.

Very, very fudgy brownies. Almost like candy. Rich, delicious flavor although not too sweet. I couldn't really taste the toffee bits in the brownies but the topping looked wonderful. Be sure to cut these small!

A chocolate lover's dream! I made this recipe for a Christmas party & everyone loved them. The store was sold out of toffee bits so I bought a bag of "Heath Bar" miniatures. Using a heavy kitchen carving fork, I broke them into little chunks a tad larger than pea- sized & used the same amount called for. You could definitely taste the toffee in the finished product - the flavor really brings it to the next level. I agree with underbaking & cutting them small. I ended up with about 32 bite sized pieces. They pack a rich, flavor punch! We enjoyed the brownies without the cream & almonds. Would go perfectly with vanilla ice cream. This is now a family favorite. Try these and enjoy!!!!

This recipe has become one of my most requested. Some reviewers suggested omitting the toffee bits, I tried that and was very disappointed with the results.....keep the toffee!

These were so rich and sweet I couldn't finish a whole one, but serious chocoholics will polish them off. Extremely dense, chewy, and intensely flavored. I agree with previous comments about underbaking them slightly and cutting them into 32 pieces rather than 16. They are a little hard to slice straight from the fridge - I ended up more or less scoring them deeply and breaking them apart with my hands.

I have made this recipie several times, It is requested regularly for both events that I attend and events that I host. Extremely decadent and all about chocolate. I am once again serving it as the chocolate dessert for my Easter with friends. There will be no left overs.

I agree with a lot of other reviewers (you can't discern the toffee flavor, very rich and fudgey)...what I'll add, is that as long as your oven is reliable for most recipes you need to pull it out at 45 mins and ignore the "moist crumbs" thing. This recipe is meant to be underbaked - that's why it is fudgey and rich. I was doing 2 batches for a party - the first batch I kept cooking until moist crumbs pulled out vs. raw batter - they turned out cakey and a bit dry, and while good, certainly nothing special or impressive. The 2nd batch I pulled out at 45 mins and paniced when I cut into them and they seemed raw - however the flavor was a world away from batch 1 - very rich and fudgey. Also, you can get away with 1/2 of the topping if you don't have the full ingredients - it makes a lot. So, that's my experience.

Definitly for those who like fudgy brownies as opposed to cake. I did not taste the toffee in the brownie at all and will consider leaving it out next time - however, these were by far probably my favorite brownies so maybe I won't mess with a good thing!

These brownies were a big hit at our friends' New Year's Eve party! They're incredibly decadent, but they have a big "wow" effect, which is why they're great for a party. I couldn't find the English toffee bits, so I just crushed up a Heath bar and used that instead. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I had no problem with the brownies sticking to the bottom of the pan. But like everyone else has said, I would definitely bake these for an hour and cut them small because they pack a punch!

This is the first brownie recipe from this site that I thought was a flop. Maybe I used the wrong kind of toffee bits, but I found that they stuck to the bottom, making the brownies hard to slice. The edges were hard and the center was uncooked after an hour of baking. The recipe would probably be fine if you leave the toffee bits out of the batter and sprinkle them on top only.

The previous reviews are right on. These are RICH and FUDGY. Cut the 16 squares into triangles for an attractive presentation. If you like cake-like brownies, look elsewhere. Loved the almonds on top.

It was just ok for me, But my family loved them. Took them to a BBQ and they were gone in no time. Everyone asked for the recipe.

I have made this recipe numerous times now & serve to large crowds. I agree they should be cut smaller. I also make them without the topping, and sometimes even without the toffee bits...they are always a hit!

These are really good - but definately not a brownie recipe I would make every time. They are incredibly rich and fudgy - have to be in the right mood. They are truly sinful!

A great brownie. So easy and fast to bake. Very fudgy, very chewy, very delicious! Was done in 41 minutes. Will bake often!

Fabulous brownies and I agree with what everyone else said, but just want to add that these are bittersweet brownies, similar to eating a chocolate truffle. I don't think young children would enjoy them. Because they are so rich, I would cut them into 24 pieces rather than 16.

I don't usually give four forks, but these brownies are AMAZING. I got several "These are the best brownies I've ever had" comments when I gave them out last night. They are aptly named "Fudgy" brownies and they are incredibly rich, but incredibly good. I highly recommend these if you're trying to impress or just if you want some goooooood fudge brownies. I made the recipe exactly as is. My only complaint is that it took an hour and a half for me to bake, but I'm not sure if that was due to the recipe or to my dorm-room oven.

Wow. These are great and my family now requests this brownie as "the hunk of fudge brownie". It is really rich and super. It does harden up after chilling, so be sure to take it out a bit before you plan to serve....so it will soften back up. Definately not for the faint hearted! A drizzle of caramel and some whipped cream would be nice. Otherwise, follow as is and enjoy.

Got the munchies during SuperBowl, and WOW! These are NOT for the faint of heart. Very rich, chewy, candylike. Not cakey, and that is just fine by me!! I used more toffee than called for, and used chopped walnuts instead of almonds. I have been known to eat a full pan of brownies, and i couldn't even get through 2 of these,cut small! They were a huge hit, but at the end of the night I through out the leftovers, such a sin, but I'm a personal trainer, and with these around , there is no eating healthy, I would have had them for breakfast.

I baked these brownies for almost an hour, as some of the earlier reviews suggested. The inside was done about right, but the bottom and sides got a bit crispy. I just cut that off, though, and served them. The verdict was that they were rich and delicious. The almonds on top were a great touch, don't skip that step!

I made a batch of these for my husband's co-workers, so I'm basing this review on their reaction. Many people asked for the recipe, everyone now thinks I'm the US version of the domestic goddess! Personally, I thought they were OK but a little too rich. I guess I prefer my brownies without a glaze or frosting. I found the cooking time to be exactly right - to the minute. Unlike a lot of brownies, these sliced very easily and cleanly. I made 24 pieces and they looked amazingly neat and professional. Almost like petit fours. Make these if you want to bask in a lot of compliments!

Rating: 3
This was good, but very. very sweet. 32 pieces would actually be a better bet. Takes way longer than 45 minutes to cook, my rec. would be 1 hour at 325.

I very rarely give a recipe four forks but this one was a chocoholic's dream. They are the fudgiest brownies I have ever made -- not at all cake-like. Anyone who ate them fell in love with them and wanted to take the rest home! An excellent recipe that I will make again and again.

I made these for a potluck dinner and they were a smashing hit! definately cut them in small peices, as they are very rich. I also skipped the heavy cream and just sprinkled walnuts, extra chocolate chips and toffee peices (Skor bar) on top and they were just fine. They're not much more work than making brownies from a box and definately worth the extra effort. Make these and be the hit of the party!

Somewhere, between the land of fudge and cake, lies - the brownie. The age-old brownie question is: Do you prefer cake-like, or chewy? Philosophically, where do YOU stand? To all those CHEWY brownie fans out there - the search is over. These brownies were created for us! The toffee is what makes these the ultimate chewy brownie. They don't even need the frosting - we had ours warm with ice cream. Be prepared. These brownies ROCK!

These brownies looked like they would be really tasty, but instead I found them really, really rich! Not sure of the purpose for the toffee bits. They kind of get lost inside the brownies and on top they don't seem to add much except for more sweetness! Almost too sweet to eat and I love sweets!!

I did not wait until these were cold. We ate them as soon as they set barely enough to be cut. They were unbelievable -- probably the best brownie I've ever made and maybe the best brownie I've ever had!

It took me 1 hour 30 min to bake the brownies, not the 45 minutes it says in the recipe. I had a hard time finding the right kind of toffee at the store, so look well in advance to make sure you can find it. I ended up buying little toffie candies and had to cut them up which was a real pain and they didn't taste as good as the right kind of toffee would have.

very rich- a fudge like consistency rather than cake like. If that's how you like your brownies, you'll like these. My cooking time was a bit longer than stated.
