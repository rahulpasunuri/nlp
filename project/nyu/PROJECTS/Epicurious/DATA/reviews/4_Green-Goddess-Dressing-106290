Made with my son to serve with celery sticks at his school St. Patrick's Day party. Ridiculously good and easy.

Excellent. Added a bit of garlic.

Fabulous: clearly one of the original recipes. I did find it a tiny bit bland so doubled the herbs and then it was perfect...I don't know why this ever fell out of favor with the masses.

A nice base recipe. Because of a vinegar allergy of one of my dinner guests, I made a few changes that worked well, and reduced calories by a ton. I used non-fat greek yogurt in place of the mayo (prepared mayo has vinegar in it), and added a few tbsp of olive oil to make up for the mouth-feel. The yogurt needs more seasoning that mayo does, so I generally upped the ratios of all the other ingredients. I used lemon juice instead of the tarragon vinegar, and added a bit extra fresh tarragon to make up for the flavor loss. I also added a bit of dill because I love green goddess with a dill backnote. It turned out great.

Fan-flippin-tastic. Really good. I made this exactly to recipe and wouldn't change a thing. It is perfect as is. This turns a basic salad into something special. It would also be great as a crudite dip. When I finished the dressing I sampled it and loved it. Then I realized I had forgotten the anchovies (I use the paste) and added some. Yum! Don't be tempted to skip them, they add a little extra something. This would be great on a salad with shrimp. Give it a try.

This was great with homemade mayo. I used 2/3 mayo 1/3 creme fraiche and it was a good texture for dipping vegetables. Be careful if you go heavy on the anchovies, we love them so i added a few more and it was a bit too salty

wonderful, great for the spring and summer. To the reviewer who didn't make the recipe and gave it low rating, if you read the beginning note you will see this IS one of the original recipes.

Liked this dressing. I would have doubled the recipe. I think it would be better if it sat overnight. Great for dipping vegies!!!

A classic salad dressing. Mild, creamy, and herbal in taste with a tiny bit of briney taste from the anchovies. It fell out of fashion a few decades ago, probably because of all the mayo. I'm sure variations using yogurt are attempts to keep the flavor and texture but lose some of the fat. I'll bet it would be tasty -- I may try that.

Great and easy. To the comment below, I am assuming by the tone of your "review" , you didn't make this dressing. You should try it, one of the best.

Absolutely the perfect classic. There are a lot of wierd variations of green goddess, but this is the one.

How much anchovy paste do you use per anchovy to substitute? I agree that most dressing recipes work out better with paste than anchovies, but sometimes ill throw in just a little chopped anchovy for texture.

I love Green Goddess dressing and have made variations on this theme--this is a good recipe, great for crudites or any lettuce salad. I've used anchovy paste instead of anchovies and also used some sour cream in place of some of the mayo.
