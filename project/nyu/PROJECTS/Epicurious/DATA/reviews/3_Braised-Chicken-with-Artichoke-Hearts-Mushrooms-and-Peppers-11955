Based on other reviews, I used four boneless breasts so we would have enough for another meal. I used TJ's frozen artichoke hearts, which are much better than canned. Also, I was generous with the peperoncini and the garlic. I didn't have a red pepper and substituted TJ's roasted red peppers than come in a jar. I hate when reviewers start messing around with the ingredients, but I used what I had in the larder.

i've never reviewed a recipe on here before, but this one was so good, i just had to! i skipped the peperoncini and wine and doubled the chicken broth (to make up for not using wine), and it was amazing! Like others have said, there is plenty of sauce, which is why i served over rice, and it went wonderfully. My husband and i love that we can combine our favorite things (artichoke hearts, mushrooms and peppers) in one recipe that turns out so well. I've made this recipe 4-5 times already and can't wait for the next!

This is perfect if you like artichoke hearts (I love them). I left the red pepper out of the chicken and used it in the salad instead. I also didn't use the beurre manie, and it was fine. Extra garlic is good, as ar boneless chicken breasts. You can make the dish ahead and reheat it, which helps make the chicken more tender.

We enjoyed this recipe as is without changes. Of necessity I increased the recipe to include 4 chicken breast halves, and there was PLENTY of sauce for all 4 without skimping. Served with mashed potatoes and a green salad, and it was a nice meal.

Excellent . However, I did modify it ,because I like things with a kick. I used chicken thighs, red onions, 2T minced garlic, 3T peperoncini and finally bottled grilled artichoke hearts. It turned out very zippy and everybody loved it! It has been requested for repeats.

I made this without adding the beurre manie and it was still delicious. I served it over Jasmine rice for a quick, colorful and healthy meal.

This recipe is really delicious and quite easy once you assemble the ingredients. I made the recipe exactly as written, but used canned mushrooms instead of fresh ( I know, I know, but I happen to like them!) This recipe is not bland at all, as many people have noted. I would like to offer a theory: I love fresh artichokes that are steamed. I find that they stimulate my tastebuds....even make them "tingle". My husband, on the other hand, finds artichokes completely tasteless and bland. My theory is that there is a genetic predisposition to liking artichokes. You either love them or hate them. So if you like/love artichokes, you'll like/love this recipe! And don't forget the salt and pepper, which is not on the ingredient list, but in the body of the recipe. As an additional element, there indeed is, as another reviewer shared, a great deal of sauce. You can cut it in half easily, and still have plenty. Or, you can not the reduce amount of sauce, eliminate the chicken altogether, and have a wonderful vegetarian dish!

I really liked this dish. Its quick to make and perfect for summer. I used a good quality pino wine to cook the chicken with. It was great.

This dish was okay. Looked good, but was a little low on taste. Didn't take very long to make, and the family liked it, but didn't rave.

I increased the garlic and peperoncini per others' suggestions. I think that helped, but I substituted a green pepper for the red, and that substitution did not work. The color was way too....green, and I'm sure the flavor was compromised as well. Also, know that the sauce is more like a fricassee.

I made this last night and my family loved it (even my 3 year old). I modified a bit as I did not have all the ingredients. I used 1 cup of vegetable stock as I had no chicken stock or white wine. It was delicious. The chicken was very tender and flavourful. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today! I will definitely make again.

This recipe was great! I had to improvise because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I doubled the recipe, put in a can of tomatoes instead of the bell pepper, omitted the other peppers, and used red wine instead of white. My whole family loved it, including my 3 year old who told me it was the best chicken he had ever had!

I thought this was a great recipe! I had to make a few substitutions with what was on hand. (For example dry vermouth for white wine and plum tomatoes for the red pepper.) Can't wait to try the recipe as it was meant to be!

Well, I just can't seem to agree with the other cooks here. I found this a very bland dish - even after adding additional 'pep' to it. Tried the marinated hearts as well. Just so-so.

Rating: 3
This is my husband's favorite dish; however, I had to make a few changes. To achieve the "zing", I use about 10 peperoncinis, 1 tsp of paprika, and marinated artichokes. In addition, I simmer it for a lot longer using a whole 16 oz. can of chicken broth and 1 cup of white wine. After simmering for 30 minutes, I then add the mushrooms and the marinated artichoke hearts and then simmer for another 20-30 minutes. In this way, all the spices and flavors are blended well and the chicken is very tender. I omit the beurre manie as I have reduced the liquids to only about 1/2 cup to 2/3 C or so. Serve with white rice.

This dish tasted great, was easy to prepare and healthy to boot! I added an extra clove of garlic, extra TBS of peppers and a 1 cup of both the wine and broth. (Nice to have a little extra sauce). Went wonderful w/ roasted yellow potatoes too.

I made this dish exactly according to the recipe not because I'm an unimaginative cook but because it's really a good place to start - particularly when the recipe comes from Gourmet or Bon A. We thought it's a delicious dish, sophisticated and not too time-consuming. Living in Aruba there are enough limitations regarding available produce, fish, etc. and this recipe needed absolutely no subs or additions to be perfect as is.

After reading the reviews, I was a little leary but it turned out great. I used a combination of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs. I increased the garlic to four cloves, used marinated artichokes and double the peperoncini. It was very flavorful and went great with spinach.

Yummy. I didn't find it bland at all. Didn't rinse the canned artichoke hearts because people were recommending using marinated ones for more flavor, but next time I will -- unrinsed seemed too strong. Ran out of burner room, so covered the dish with foil and baked it in the oven instead. Very nice! Served with rice and spinach.

We really enjoyed this. Pretty easy & good for company. Did not rinse the artichokes. Pretty much have everything on hand, so it's good for last minute entertaining.

Terrific and tasty! I also used marinated artichokes for extra flavor and think it is a nice addition. Next time I think I will make it without the beurre manie, or at least cut it in half. Also, my sauce was enough for 3-4 chicken breast halves. Enjoy! KIMBER

This was delicious. I did however make the following substitutions - I used a whole chicken cut-up, roasted red peppers instead of fresh, no mushrooms (I'm allergic) and did not thicken the sauce as I didn't think it needed it. I also added black and green olives. The whole family loved it. Served it over a bed of steamed spinach - yum!

I didn't find this bland, but I didn't love the combination of flavors either. Has a bit of a different flair than your ordinary chicken recipe, perhaps good for a weeknight meal but not likely to become a favorite in my house. I used plain artichoke hearts, but I think the marinated kind would have been better.

Oh my, oh my this was delicious! How could anyone call this bland, unless they left out the peppers? They have a wonderful bite. Will definitely make this again and again.

I have to laugh at both the San Diego chef and the Bellvieu Washington chef. The San Diego one was being sarcastic. He/She is describing making hamburgers. Washington chef is correct however, before changing or playing around with a recipe, you need to know its original version. Delicious Dinner!

This was easy and very tasty. I omitted the red pepper as I didn't have one on hand, and it was still good. The pepperoncini makes this dish ... don't omit. It's the whole flavor base of the sauce. The heat mixed with the wine really makes a tasty sauce. I'll definetly make this dish again. BTW... Bellvue, I think San Diego was being sarcastic. San Diego really needs to brush up on his stand up...(yawn...)

I had to laugh at the San Diego cook who wondered what happened! Well, since she changed almost everything in the recipe, it's a no brainer! Before you alter a recipe, cook it as it's written, test-tasting as you go along and adjusting ingredients. Then get "creative", or destructive, as was the case. This is a very good dish and easy to boot!

I don't know what happened, but this was very ordinary. First, instead of chicken I used ground beef which I formed into mini-loafs and sauteed with the onions (no garlic! I can't stand it!). Then I omitted the peppers because my husband doesn't like them. And since I didn't have any wine, I drank a beer instead. Then I topped the mini-loafs with cheese because my family just loves cheese on everything. Finally, I served the loafs on buns, and since artichokes are so expensive, for a little zing added ketchup and mayonaize. The recipe says it's braised chicken, but we all thought it tasted alot like hamburgers. I won't make this again.

Very tasty. My husband loved it, I will make this recipe again soon.

I found this a good mix of vegetables and chicken with a pleasant flavor. Don't be intimidated by the beurre manié sauce: you can just melt butter and mixing in flour, and it works the same. I used extra because I like a thicker sauce.

I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I added a bit of Cayenne Pepper for heat.

I skipped both peppers and used red wine instead of white and it was pretty good--again, not great, but okay. I served it with saffron rice and spicy spinach--I think the red wine really added to the flavor.

I would give this 2.5 forks if that was an option. It was good, and very filling but it wasn't great. I don't know if I would do it again.

This is an excellent chicken recipe--not too difficult preparation. The peperoncini add an unusual touch.
