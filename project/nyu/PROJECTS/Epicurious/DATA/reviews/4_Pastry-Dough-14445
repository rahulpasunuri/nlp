just respect exactly the proportions. for me proably tiny more ice water and tiny more butter. minimal quantities make huge differences, so be careful ...

This is a good crust recipe. I plan to use this as my new master pie-crust recipe. I used the crust with the upside down, caramelized pear tart from the November 1997 issue of Gourmet this time. That is another good recipe.

Excellent pastry dough for any kind of pie. The mixture of shortening and butter makes a perfect blend. I also used it for chicken and for onion pie, as well as for sweet pies.

Finally, I can make a pie crust like my mother-in-law. It was so good everyone wants me to make it again.
