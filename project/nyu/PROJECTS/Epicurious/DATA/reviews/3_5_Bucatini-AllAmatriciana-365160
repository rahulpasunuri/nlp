Agree with jimbill that the sauce is very tomato-ey, especially compared to versions of this dish I've had in restaurants. I came a cross a few other recipes, as well, in my search, and will try a different one the next time I want to make this dish.

Very tomatoey. Couldn't taste the pancetta. Added a little red wine and basil. Still not impressed. It was easy to make.

Used pancetta cut sort of thick - about 1 mm. Absolutely fantastic

I havent had an Amatriciana before, so I can't comment on the tomatoey-ness of this, but it was delicious! Made a half-recipe with pancetta, and half a can of tomatoes (which was actually mostly juice and only 3 tomatoes), and it turned out great.

This is quite good and easy enough for a weeknight. Great flavor from the guanciale, and I added a little wine and then garnished with fresh basil. Next time I might use less tomatoes-- there was too much sauce for a pound of pasta, and I liked it better a little "dry" after the pasta had absorbed the sauce. Will make again.

Loved this. I also used prosciutto -- all my grocery store had -- but next time I think I'll do it without, or do tofu for my vegetarian friends. (The ham didn't seem to add much flavor.) I also used a shallot instead of an onion and added diced zucchini at the same time. I made a balsamic vinegar glaze and drizzled just a little on top. It didn't take long and didn't make too much of a mess in the kitchen. I'll be making this again.

This is a great version of Amatriciana and more tomato-y than any I've had before. You cannot go wrong with this as a quick and delicious weeknight meal made -- mostly -- with things you probably always have on hand. Full review on my blog KateCookstheBooks.com.

Not only was this good for dinner the night we made it, but it reheated really well for lunch leftovers two days later. It was fast and easy to prepare, but it tasted like a more complex dish. (My husband was able to toss it together with very little help.) We used prosciutto since I had some that needed to be used, but I'm sure any of the meats suggested would be great as well.

Good recipe. I also added celery with the onion and garlic.
