Easy to make, easy to work with. Based on other reviews I made a 1/2 batch and it was just the right amount for a bundt cake.

So simple and quick, with a decent flavor and consistency--fine for family cake in a hurry, but wouldn't obviously couldn't be passed off as anything special. Substitute orange-flavored liqueur for about half of the water to add interest. Does make alot, but I like having extra. Yummy!

This was a fine glaze. Simple, but much too sweet! I also agree that it makes way too much for a bundt pan.

I made this using white chocolate (chips), white port (dry) instead of water, to glaze a white chocolate bundt cake. Perfect consistency. Will make again I'm sure in various flavors!

A simple, tasty glaze for a cake, but half the recipe. It makes too much for a bundt or tube cake.
