I will definitely make this again. A unique appetizer or, as I ate it, a flavorful light dinner with a good glass of wine. I completely agree with previous reviewers. The pancetta is salty enough--no additional salt needed. And the fava beans are hard to mash and dry. Next time I may stick them in the food processor for 3 seconds with some olive oil.

Didn't have any pancetta (or even any bacon) so I did without, and this was still wonderful. Without the pancetta it does need the salt.

I made the recipe as written with the pancetta, and it was a little bit salty. Otherwise it was excellent. Boiling the fava beans for a few minutes before peeling makes the job MUCH easier.

This was a tasty appetizer, but be careful with the pancetta as it makes the dish rather salty so don't add any salt! Also the beans can be somewhat hard to mash and dry so I added more olive oil. I served it with the crostini, parmesan and cucumbers, everyone liked it.
