I agree with the previous comment: dill in pastitsio is highly unusual and certainly not traditional (unless it's a regional variation that I'm unfamiliar with). (I love dill and use it in some Greek dishes, but not this one.) The meat is usually braised in chopped onion and some tomato paste, along with cinnamon (and even nutmeg if you wish). An alternate to using all lamb is half-and-half mixture of lean ground beef and ground lamb.

DILL??!? In pastitsio??? Are they KIDDING?? Ok - I'm not Greek, I'm lebanese, but I've NEVER heard of dill in pastitsio. I also know that the lamb portion of this recipe is authentic, but probably too overdone for the average cook. This is not the best recipe I've seen - but it's ok. there should be a smattering of cinnamon somewhere.....

I love Epicurious, and I love pastitsio, but they totally missed the mark here. No one should be turned off to pastitsio because of this recipe, so at the risk of being a turncoat, check out the Pastitsio recipe at cooking.com. Much better. Much. (I use beef)

just ok. The top of dish does get crispy and hard. Maybe adding an additonal cheese to top might help. Flavor was somewhat bland.

Mine came out too pasta heavy- and the bechamel wasn't as tasty as it should. It was sort of bland and needed a lot of salt and pepper at the table to make it better.

This recipe is not bad. In fact close. I too would not use the dill. Pastitsio is always made with two white sauces. The first one #1 white sauce which when added filters down through all the pasta. The #2 sauce is then added slowly two the top and that creates another layer cheese like in quality. This is a worthwhile recipe that only needs tuning.

The finished dish tasted fine but I would make changes to the recipe to make it better. I would have liked a thicker bechamel sauce and omit the dill. Because the sauce was so thin it didn't coat the top layer of pasta therefore it developed a hard, crunchy inedible top crust. I used ground pork that was sauteed with onions, garlic, 1/2t. cinnamon, 1/4t. nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Then I added 1/4c. of tomato sauce and let it cook through for 15 mins. until au sec. Tossed the cooked pasta with 1/4c. of butter, and 1/4c. of parmesan. Layered as usual and baked. Not like the pastitsio I had last week at our local Greek Festival where the bechamel created a top layer in it's self.

I made this recipe like I've had it in Cyprus: using mint in the meat, and using Haloumi cheese instead of kefalotiry. The mint made this very nice, and the cheese a slightly different flavour.

Instead of using the lamb shank, I sauteed ground beef with onions, garlic, and pine nuts. It was a fantastic dish, nice to get away from a tomato sauce-based pasta-and-meat recipe. I plan to add this to my permanent file.

I enjoyed this meal very much. I, too, used left over leg of lamb. I didn't have dill around, so I substituted some fennel seeds. A very different taste than dill, but wonderful. Since I can no longer tolerate milk, I made the bechamel sauce with soy milk and for those of you who need this substition, its was delicious. Next time, I will probably put a light layer of cheese on the lamb before the second layer of pasta. What a GREAT leftover dish.

Being Italian I added the dreaded tomato sauce to the meat mixture (which was half hamburg, half sausage). It was a nice change from the usual ricotta type pasta casserole.

Coming from a Cretan family, I have had Greek food my entire life. This recipe is quite a nice change from myfamily's normal tomatopased meat sauce. I will definately make it again..
