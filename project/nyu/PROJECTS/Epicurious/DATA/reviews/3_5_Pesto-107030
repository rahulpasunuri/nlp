I made this recipe with the following modifications: 2 cloves garlic/dropped in boiling water for 1 minute, 1/2 the recommended salt - used Kosher salt, pine nuts/toasted, about 1/2 or a bit more oil, juice of 1/2 lemon. Definitely would make again

Totally yummy. I used toasted walnuts to sub for the pine nuts, and mixed the pesto w/pasta with sauteed zucchini, fresh mozzarella and fresh tomatoes.

Delicious. I thought it came out a quite salty though, so I'd cut the salt by half and gradually add more if needed. I also added a few squeezes of lime juice (I didn't have lemon) and I felt that balanced out the oil and added a little brightness to the pesto.

Easy and delicious. I love garlic but this was a little too strong for me. "3 large garlic cloves" is subjective and depends on the garlic (I used farmer's market). Next time will try just 2 cloves.

This is my go to pesto recipe. Good with pine nuts or walnuts, though I find the pine nut version to be richer and creamier. Sometimes I spike mine with a little crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up. As others have suggested I added a bit of lemon juice, and cut back slightly on the salt and oil.

I just have to add another review to this one. I have made this many times and this is what I have found: I add each ingredient individually to the processor. It gives a slower buildup and the ingredients blend better. I also use 1 tsp. of large crystal sea salt. This is probably less than 1 tsp. of table salt. Table salt should not be used in this recipe. It will ruin the flavor. Lastly, I drizzle in the oil until it reaches my desired consistency. I Hope this helps. Serve with fresh chopped tomatoes from the garden and some grilled chicken over angel hair. Enjoy!

I think this is way too garlicky and I always hand cut basil, pinenuts and garlic...add a touch of lemon, too. Hand cutting leaves lots of wonderful strands of basil and lovely toasted nibbles of pinenuts...the food processor just makes mash

After reading all the reviews, I really can't figure out what I did wrong. I followed this recipe exactly, and the results were inedible. The pesto was so salty/garlicky I could barely swallow the first bite. I tried adding sugar, and that really ruined things! I'm going to try adding more basil and pine nuts to see if I can stifle the salt.

This was surprisingly quick and easy to make - easy enough to whip up on a weeknight for a casual dinner. I made it as a way to use up a bunch of organic basil and I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh taste of this recipe, compared to supermarket pestos that I have eaten before. For my taste, 3 cloves of garlic was just right and I substituted Romano for Parmesan. Just really, really good pesto.

Rating: 4
This is a snap to make with delightful results. Took other reviewers' advice and cut the garlic to two large cloves and also reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. Do roast the pinenuts before putting into the food processor; it adds such a nice nuttiness to the pesto.

Love it. I also cut back on the garlic and added some sundried tomatoes. Adds a little bite.

I made a couple changes... I didn't have any pine nuts, but instead used raw almonds that I chopped up a bit and toasted in a pan. I only had a little parmesan left (probably only a teaspoon). I didn't measure the pepper, but used fresh ground (about 100 grinds). Anyways, it came out fantastic! I have no idea why everyone's cutting back on the oil.. I found the amount to be perfect, at least for pasta. It's possible if I used the correct amount of cheese it might have been too salty, but as it was it was delicious! It made the perfect amount of sauce for one box of penne pasta.

I made this using advice from the other reviewers. they were right. If I used 3 cloves of garlic it would have been overpowering. I used a half clove. instead of salt I added 1/3 cup of klamata olives. It added a great flavor. Finally. reduce the olive oil by half if you want a perfect spread for crackers.

Made this last night w/ one exception: couldn't find the pine nuts I thought I had so used slivered almonds. Took advice of a couple reviewers and tried blanching some of my basil with disastrous results -- they turned black and had to toss them. Froze 2/3 of the batch and stirred remaining into my angel hair pasta w/ some cooked chicken. Loved it. Will keep this one handy!

Excellent. Based on some of the reviews, I only used two large garlic cloves and that was plenty. I used it for the pesto and cheese pastries on this site and it was fantastic. Definitely a keeper and a great way to use all the basil in my garden

I drop the garlic cloves in boiling water for a minute, let them cool and process. Gives it a more mellow garlic flavor than the raw taste.

I thought this was a great starting point for pesto, not too garlicky at all. To the cook from Brooklyn--sometimes doubling a recipe doesn't translate mathematically or logically, you can't always double the ingredients and expect an ok result. That goes for any recipe, not just this one and it usually takes a couple tries. I'd give it another try if I were you, with less garlic, obvi...

i had to add my 2 cents because i love pesto and feel this recipe does it no justice. i had a ton of basil in my garden and decided to use a recipe for once to make pesto (instead of winging it like usual). however, i planned to double the recipe, so used a bit less than 6 cloves of garlic and doubled the rest of the ingredients. it was SOOOO garlicy i couldn't taste anything else. so i added at least another 5-7 cups of basil and it still mostly tastes like garlic. ug! i can't believe all the delicious fresh basil that has been wasted. if you LOVE garlic, this is the recipe for you. if you LOVE basil, go really easy and take it one clove at a time.

The best way we found to prepare pesto at home to allow the full realease of aroma from the leaves of basil was with the mortar and wood pestel. The result should be a thick creamy pesto. The addition of ingredients of walnuts, hazel-nuts and cashew nuts tends to cause deterioration of pesto with time so it's best to plan for smaller amounts of this dressing to be savored immediately.

I just tried this recipe out, substituting the basil for rocket (rucola) and the pine nuts for cashew nuts  simply because that's all I had in the kitchen  and it turned out great! 1 tsp of salt is a little too much for my taste, but this recipe is certainly worth the five minutes it took to make.

This is a great basic pesto recipe with which you can improvise and be creative. Feel free to cut back on the oil; I don't think you need that much. Also, brown the pignolis in a saute pan, being careful not to burn them or they'll be bitter, and experiment with a pignoli-walnut blend. I can't get enough of this in the summer, and I free extra in ice-cube trays for winter.

Beats anything out of the jar! It has been raining here a lot and I needed a way to use the abuncance of basil in my garden. I used coarse salt and doubled the garlic. Also after reading the other reviews this is what I did about the oil: After blending all the ingredietns together, I started adding oil slowly until the pesto reached my desired consistancy. I think the oil debate is just a matter of preferance. There was plenty of pesto to freeze for later.

I used 1 clove of elephant garlic. I doubled everything in the recipe b/c I had so much basil. My pine nuts had been frozen so I toasted them. Next time I make it I might stir the parm cheese in at the end. The pesto had a strange texture. Maybe due to the heat of the food processor. I love pesto so I will make again and again. I do freeze it in ice cube trays so I have it all winter.

I grow my own herbs. Basil is my most loved! Pesto is a staple at my house and this recipe is great.

I listened to the reader reviews the first time I made this, much to my chagrin. Making this pesto with 1/2 the oil makes it too thick to be stirred appropriately into pasta dishes - it was clumpy - terrible! I ended up having to stick it back in the food processor and add more oil (up to the 2/3 cup in the recipe). Maybe you should halve the oil if you're using this as a spread, but otherwise, I recommend using all the oil. This is a good basic recipe, very tasty, just like my gramma used to make. And speaking of my gramma, she'd want me to add: don't cut down on the garlic unless you're using elephant garlic (I use regular-size cloves, so I actually doubled the garlic and it was just right!)

Rating: 1
For a much better recipe, search under CLASSIC PESTO. I agree with Maisy that once tweaked, the pesto would be reasonably good. As is, it calls for an unwarranted quantity of olive oil. Further, 1 tsp salt might be approriate for coarse sea salt, but not table salt. The garlic will depend on user preference, I didn't mind three cloves.

Rating: 4
i agree that this recipe needs a little tweaking...but is amazing when adjusted in just the smallest way. i only use 1/2 the oil, none of the salt, and stir the cheese in as the last step. use the freshest basil you can get your hands on and you you'll be in heaven. less oil is key though...even if it seems a bit dry when you make it don't worry....i use this recipe for pizza and pasta all the time and it releases a bunch of it's oil when heated. mmmmmmmmm.....soooooo good. this is the only pesto recipe you'll ever need! my boyfriend won't eat pesto in a restaurant cause he swears it can't beat this! i like using padano parmesan...it's so tasty and strong...gives it a nice kick. happy summer cooking!

way too oily, way too garlicky. sure, the chopped pine nuts, basil, garlic and spices need a vehicle to coat the pasta (and whatever else) with, but this is ridiculous. I made the recipe exactly as directed and was shocked, even when i was pouring the oil in the food processor. does it need that much? i thought... then sure enough - wow - 3 cups of basil basically wasted, b/c this pesto "sauce" is just an oil spill. you need maybe 1/3 the oil called for in this recipe, and it's awesome as it is. don't drown your food, folks...

amazing. I didn't have any prepared pesto (and my basil plant just died a tragic death...) I used dried basil, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper and ground it down as a 'fake' pesto. Even though it wasn't fresh, when I added the mayo and it was perfect. Followed the rest of the recipe and the sandwich was fantastic! What a great quickie.

I sort of combined this recipe with Marcella Hazan's pesto, and it was great. I toasted the pine nuts first, and also sauteed the garlic in a little oil as well (I don't like raw garlic). No extra salt and I used a mix of mostly parm and a little romano. Don't process the cheeses, just stir them in. I added a little butter when tossing with the pasta and it was wonderful. I added some cut up pieces of fresh mozzarella and steamed broccoli for a great meal.

Delicious pesto ... but a couple of things I would change. I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and added only half the salt, but wish I would not have added any!

I agree this is a great pesto receipe. The salt becomes an issue if you put the pesto on pasta and you have salted the pasta (which I did). I put 3/4 tsp of salt in the pesto and it was perfect. I also used a little less oil ... approx. 1/3 cup. I don't like pesto that is too oily.

This recipe is perfect - don't change a thing. Even my 4-year-old liked it w/ 3 cloves of garlic. I halved the salt, & ended up adding it back in at the table (which is not the worst thing in the world, if you're sensitive to salt).

Toast your pine nuts beforehand. Be careful -- they scorch easily. But if you can get them only a little bit browned and smelling lovely, you're in business. Come to think of it, pan-frying the nuts in a little olive oil might work even better.

Very delicious IF you reduce salt to ~ 1/4 tsp. and garlic to two large cloves. I found it was much easier to process in a blender by initially omitting the Parmigiano-Reggiano and then stirring it in by hand afterwards. I think next time I'll try walnuts instead of pine nuts. The latter are more expensive and don't have a pronounced flavor.

Good Recipe! My comments are needs MORE garlic - I used twice as much. And make sure you use fresh nuts (a good grocer will keep bulk nut bins in the refridgerator as oil in nuts will go rancid).

You can't go wrong with this pesto! A few things: 1) blanch the basil ever so briefly - the green color is gorgeous - then make sure to stop the cooking immediately with ice water, 2) stir in the parm by hand at the end, 3) the bright green color will remain for a week if you put saran wrap directly on top of the pesto (in addition to putting inside of a covered bowl or tupperware) - the idea is to have no air in contact with the pesto while it sits in the fridge. We keep this on hand as a pizza sauce, a dip for crackers and veggies, a sauce for chicken and, of course, pasta! Enjoy.

This is a great basic pesto recipe. I skipped the Pepper, upped the pine nuts to 2/3 C and added lemon juice to preserve the color. I had a HUGE Basil plant that I wanted to use before the first frost and I made a triple batch, froze in ice cube trays and popped out with a knife and wrapped each cube in saran wrap. Keep them in the freezer for a quick and easy meal. A nice curved or ridged pasta works well to hold the pesto. The pevious reviewer is right. Add parm. cheese at the last minute. I think the lemon juice is easier than blanching and I did not find that it affected the flavor.

As a general rule when making pesto, it's not a good idea to process the cheese with the other ingredients. The heat of the food processor blade can cause the oils in the cheese to separate and produce an unpleasant texture in the finished recipe. Rather, stir in finely grated cheese last, after all the other ingredients have been incorporated. Also, to ensure bright green pesto: blanch the basil leaves for 10 seconds in boiling water, follow with an ice bath, and drain well, squeezing out excess water. The pesto will remain green even after several days in the refrigerator.
