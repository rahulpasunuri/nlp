Absolutely wonderful! Even my picky teenage daughter liked it. A great chicken salad for food lovers!

This had great flavor, and a lot of possibilities to explore in the future. Eventhough I marianated a 4lb. bird for only 30 min. results were still yummy. (I'll try salad next time.) Switched around a little due to ingredients on hand- added 1TB+ honey, and lime juice, omitted the sage, used dried thyme and fewer cloves. Worth for sure checking out- I plan on making it a staple!

Super yummi! I was having a dinner party for 14, so I sub'd chicken thighs for the whole chicken and used horseradish-dijon. I served it on top of cracked pepper linguine with green beans... It was delicious and all the guest raved about the flavor!

I tried this recipe with bone-in chicken breasts. It sounded like a great make-ahead recipe. I wasn't sure what the recipe meant by "crushed" garlic, so I just smashed it. It smelled divine while it was cooking, but it was not an attractive dish. The herbs were all brown and looked totally unappetizing. I'm surprised no one else mentioned it. I'll try the recipe one more time (hubby suggests I put all the herbs on the underside of the chicken while baking...) but I don't think I'd consider it "company worthy".

Love this recipe. Simple and flavorful. I love the Frisee and Fingerling salad as well.

I made this in 2006 when the recipe first came out. It was fantastic--the best chicken recipe I have ever made. I used cut up whole bone-in chicken, but would love to make it with a whole chicken for presentation purposes. Anyway, I did not save the recipe and just spent two days searching through the archives to find it again--that's how much I liked it. I thought the frisee salad was wonderful also!

My husband took one bite of this and said, let's make this again! I thought it was very good, though perhaps not the be all and end all of chicken dishes. Definitely will do it again, though.

This dish was excellent. My boyfriend is extremely difficult to cook for and he loved it! I used bone in chicken breasts, and I also added honey and soy.

i made it with bone-in-skin on breasts, marinated over night in zip lock bags and cooked on a slow grill. turned out nice and moist, great flavor and virtually no clean up. like others i added some honey and soy sauce. i also just added the rosemary and sage to the marinade. this is so flexible that i'll definitely make it again.

My family and I loved this recipe. I cooked one 8 pound chicken instead of two 4 pound chickens. I used a bouquet of poultry herbs. I minced herbs and garlic with my food processor and added to the mustard marinade. The flavor was wonderful. However, next time I plan on doubling the Dijon mustard and maybe adding a bit of honey. I will definitely be making this dish again. DELICIOUS!!!!!

Excellent recipe that is simple to prepare yet delicious enough for company. Per other recommendations, I added a bit of honey, used chicken breasts and grilled on the BBQ. I served with mashed sweet potatoes seasoned with butter & fresh thyme. Delicious!!!

This recipe was fantastic. I used skinless chicken thighs, and cut down significantly on the olive oil, in both the marinade and the salad ingredients. This was different and company worthy.

Easy recipe that tastes more complicated than it is. I used boneless chicken breasts and grilled on the BBQ and got raves from guests.

This is oh my god good....I made this with boneless chicken breasts and baked them.....I skipped the frisse salad and put it on a caesar salad base - I loved it and now I'm going to do it all over again LOL!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, marinated over night, sauteed in a pan instead of roast & WOW! the flavor was incredible.

I put about 1/4 cup honey in the mustard mixture. Used a cut up whole chicken and cooked it on the barbecue. Excellent!!!

I loved this and our guests loved it too--so moist. Although I replaced the whole chicken with cut up chicken breasts because that's what I had in the freezer, I can't wait to do it with a whole chicken. Hardly any work at all for great results!

Quite a lot of work for baked chicken. Flavor was good but not outstanding. I would make the salad again; it would pair well with a number of main dishes.

We halved the recipe to make for a family of 4 (though we made the entire recipe for the mustard marinade - and it was great! very garlicky). It was very good, and we'll make it again. It was priceless to see the look on the kids' faces when we told them the dark leafy greens they thought were spinich were dandelions!

Everybody loved this recipe. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. I had to use different lettuce but the salad was a huge hit. Using fresh herbs really makes a difference. Next time I am going boneless.

The flavors were wonderful, and the chicken juicy and moist. I've already shared this recipe with several friends.

This was FANTASTIC! I have a hard time getting my fiance' to eat a salad and he loved this. This was a "restaurant-quality" meal with terrific taste and wonderful presentation. I highly recommend.

The chicken was moist and fragant. My kitchen smelled divine. Fresh herbs are the best. I made gravy from the drippings, excellent, no need to add salt or pepper to it.

This was delicious. All of the flavors really work together. A big hit with our guests!

Actually, I myself haven't made this dish. My cousin gave me the recipe after she made it. It is fabulous. The chicken was moist and crispy and very tasty. She couldn't find frisee for the salad, so used some arugula and romaine. Worked out very nicely but I want to try it with the bitterer greens.
