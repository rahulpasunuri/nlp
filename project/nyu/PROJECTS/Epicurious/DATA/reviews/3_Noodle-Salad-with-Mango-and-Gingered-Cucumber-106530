After reading some reviews, I added a drop of orange juice, a little bit of honey, and about 1/4 cup of soy sauce to the dressing. I did not double it and thought it was perfect with this minor change. I also used angel hair pasta instead of the other noodles. To make things easy, I used shredded carrots. My 13 year old daughter and I loved it and had it for dinner tonight. I would definitely make it again and serve for company.

yum! great summer recipe. i added a little agave and extra garlic and ginger because i love that combo. i also substituted siracha sauce for the jalepeno. i bet this would also be good with seasame oil instead of sweetner and oil.

Instead of bean thread noodles, I used quinoa noodles and cooked them al dente. They even held up as left-overs the next day. For the vinaigrette, I took reviewers suggestions and added a bit of citrus (I used orange juice), soy and some honey.

To cut down on time and make up for lack of unavailability, I used frozen mango for the salad. I also use angel hair pasta. My family loves this salad!

I didnt have any cellophane noodles-only some Chinese vermicelli, which actually held up under the dressing and the cukes/mangoes better. This was so danged tasty-light, refreshing, slightly sweet from the rice vinegar, and good with the Asian chicken patties. I did add a bit of soy sauce but for the most part, left recipe as is. I can see this with other fruits as well. Hubby loved this. Will keep in the recipe box for sure.

After reading other reviews, we were prepared to make this noodle salad work. We wanted to serve it with the Asian Chicken and Waterchestnut patties (yum). So, as others recmnded, we doubled dressing recipe, especially the ginger & garlic (a 2:1 ratio is perfect for those two). I used sesame oil instead of vege oil. We added 1/2 cup of soy sauce (what the...there is no salt in this recipe!) and our secret ingredient (2 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter). I ended up with too much dressing, but it is good on green salads/dipping too. We used regular angel hair pasta and eliminated the cilantro as there was none in our cupboard. Other than ALL these changes, we stuck to the recipe. It was really, really good and we will make it again and again. My guest who ate with us is stealing the recipe to serve for dinner club at her house...typical.

This has the makings of a good salad, it's just not quite there. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. The carrot did not seem to blend well with the flavors, so I will leave it out next time. The dressing was a bit too weak, so I will try doubling it, and adding more ginger, garlic and oil. The vinegar vs. oil ratio is a bit off.

Very light (too) flavor which would require a lot of doctoring. Try some of the other Asian Noodle salads on this site.

Fabulous!!!!!!

I was very disappointed by the flavour and consistancy of this salad. First of all, it should not be made hours in advanced for a party.(my fault), Otherwise the noodles became mushy and one big slimy mess. Second, the vinaigrette was too sour. I had to add more oil, a bit of honey and a few other spices to perk it up. A traditional Thai glass noodle salad would have been better.

Yummm...loads of flavor. Makes for a great light lunch. We julienned the veggies and used the thin beanthread noodles and it turned out perfect!

I've made this recipe twice I liked it so much. Adding a squeeze of fresh lime juice enhances the flavors. It does not store well(specifically the noodles) and is best eaten the day it is prepared.

I made this with rice stick noodles because I couldn't find bean thread. Although I doubled the dressing recipe I found this dish quite bland. I wouldn't make this again but for others I wouldn't recommend the rice stick noodles. They really lacked in taste.

Hate to go against the grain, but my husband and I hated this dish. Maybe I did something wrong? It had decent flavor, but we just didn't like the texture.

This was very tasty, it has a mild but satisfying flavor that goes well with the asian chicken patties. I did blanch the carrots a bit to make them easier to eat, other than that, delish.

My husband and I loved this salad. We had it with the Asian Chicken Patties (same issue). After reading the reviews I made a full amount of vinigrette and because the noodle package came in 6 oz vs 8oz, I made the full recipe of the noodle ingredients (with less noodles). It was wonderful!! I did add a full jalapeno otherwise followed the recipe.

Am I the only person who mangled the mango? I had no idea what the 'pit' looked like so I did not know how to slice it. To add to the problem, I had already peeled it and it was very slippery. Also, I defy anyone to 'dry the bean noodles on paper towels'. They stick like glue!! Other than that, it was very good.

Beautiful to look at and delicious. I seeded regular cucumbers instead of the English. I took this to a barbeque and assembled it about 2 hours before serving - it lost a lot of its heat in the process, so if you make it ahead, add more jalepeno, or add jalapeno later.

Quick, easy and delicious. I didn't use the chiles and still found it very flavorful. I also subsituted sno peas for the cucumber and cooked both the peas and carrots for one minute before adding them to the mix. Definitely let it set for at for an hour or so to let the flavors meld. Very good paired with the Asian Chicken and Water Chestnut Patties.

To Serena. This dish has so much flavor I would skip the cilantro for your dad and serve some chopped on the side for others. To Las Vegas. Thanks for the help, I made with the rice noodles and really enjoyed the dish served with the patties. So to you a big THANK YOU!

My dad doesn't like cilantro. Could I get away with omitting it?

To Beth: I used the rice noodles and the results are the same. Bean thread noodles are made from mung beans; they are usually available in a thin, vermicelli size. The rice noodles are readily available in 1/4" width. Make sure you make the Asian Chicken and Water Chestnut Patties to go with this salad.

This was nice and light on a warm night. I served it with grilled, thai style chicken. I used rice stick noodles since I couldn't find cellophane noodles. Doubling the dressing is a must. I also added some toasted cashews which added a nice crunch.

We liked this light refreshing dish that is great to make ahead, clean up and serve when it time to eat. I used sesame oil instead of the vege oil, bumped up the ginger to 2T instead of 1.5T, used pickled jalapenos(less hot)instead of fresh, and added a 1/2-1 T of soy sauce. For the noodles I used buckwheat soba noodles but either would have been fine. Also, to save time I used pre-grated carrots. I used exactly 8 oz of pasta and did not seem to run out of juice, I don't think its suppose to be soupy, just coated (I used my hands to mix it really well).

I also doubled the dressing as per everyone's comments. Like most cooks, at the last minute I was out of carrots and I used papaya instead of mango because I hate to peel the buggers. It was fab!

It's nice and light- Next time i will skip the mangoes as it takes the ginger flavor out of the dish

It's fresh, light and excellent. I cooked the carrots 2 min with the noodles, it was a great idea. Vinaigrette is fantastic but I would also double the portions in order to have enough for 6 people.

What a let-down. A lot of work chopping and slicing and the result was BORING. No zip, no flavor to speak of. With ginger in the title, I would have assumed there would some hint of it in the final product(and I increased the quanity from 1-1/2 tsp to almost 3!). I loved the chicken patties that went with this, but would rather have had a great salad and french bread instead.

Nice and light. Next time I would double the vinagrette.

I liked this recipe but I think it needed more salt. Everyone in my family liked it too. I would definitely make this again. I think I would put less cucumber, more mango and more of the vinagrette.

I skipped the mangoes because I couldn't find any good ones, and I substituted Thai noodes (the ones you use for Pad Thai). The vinaigrette is very subtle and goes great with the Asian chicken and water chestnut patties. Word of caution -- don't use more garlic than it calls for (I love garlic, but it was too much).

We found the vinaigrette underwhelming. We will make it again, but will try fish sauce.

PS... I added the carrots to the water while the noodles cooked for the last 2 minutes just so soften then up a bit and they are one vegetable that is better for you when cooked.
