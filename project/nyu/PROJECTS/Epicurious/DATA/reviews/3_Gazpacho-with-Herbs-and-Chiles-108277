I have a similar recipe that also calls for tarragon, dill and a little honey. I think the herbs are a fantastic addition. It all boils down to personal taste. That is what is so wonderful about cooking and a versatile recipe like this one.

I just had to jump in here since this was such a lively collection of passionate reviews. This recipe is very similar to mine. I do not use a recipe or measure, but I , too like to set aside some diced veggies and then puree the rest. I use light and tangy or spicy V-8 depending on the audience(yes, V-8,the horror)fresh basil, cilantro and parsley and cayenne or a bit of jalepenos depending on my mood. I use white wine and/or a splash of balsamic, lemon and lime juice. I have had traditional Gazpacho and that made me a fan, but I have since left out the bread b/c it keeps longer. I must say that food is all about creativity and while tradition(!) is great, I receive requests every summer from many to make this!!! And it gets better each time. So, like the guy on schoolhouse rock said: "Don't knock it till you try it!"

Very good gazpacho. Quite crunchy. There are better recipes for gazpacho out there, though.

I agree that the cook from Germany shouldn't have rated a recipe he or she hadn't made. What is the point of that? As for what constitutes 'real' gazpacho, there are tons of different varieties in Spain, so I don't know why folks are getting hung up on that. This recipe is not a 'traditional' smooth gazpacho, but it's a very nice chunky style gazpacho. (If it makes you feel better call it chilled vegetable soup!!!) I used organic vegetable juice instead of tomato, and I added plenty of garlic (instead of jalapeno) and green olives (a twist I stole from David Berkeley, in Sacramento,CA). It would have been fine without the herbs, but I had them so I added them and it didn't take away from it.

Hi Ashley, thanks for the generalization of us Germans :-((( I even think that the gazpacho-recipe my fellow-countryman/woman suggested sounds very good, but I don't agree to the opinion, that you must not mix two or more herbs and that these gazpacho recipe here must be awful. I think it sounds also good and I hardly agree to the cook from Santa Cruz, you can write comments and opinions, but do not judge and rate a recipe unless you have tasted it! To the lots of herbs-thing: I already made the moroccan-spiced cold tomato soup (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=108156) and there is also cilantro AND parsley in it and it is really yummy. And even famous British chef Jamie Oliver often takes more than one herb. Yes, it is just a thing of taste, but of your personally taste, not of which country you are from ;-)

I feel compelled to give this recipe a particularly high rating to off-set the German review below -- which is truly unfair and clearly untested. I served this to three people who all gave it rave reviews. The only criticism I heard was from a person with a real aversion to spice -- because those peppers really do have a kick. (My hands felt sunburned the next day where they had been exposed to the pepper's juices!) But otherwise, this dish was a wonderful antidote to the hot days we had this July!

Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. I am not much of a gazpacho fan; I often feel like I am eating salsa with a spoon. BUT, I really loved this dish. A bit of prep work, but it was so scrumpy! Shame on the Germans!

Germany - how can you give this one fork when you have not tried it? Don't rate it unless you have tasted it! It messes up the "true" overall rating. Your comments and suggestions are nice but save the forks for the people who have TASTED it....please.

The all time best gazpacho is on this site as "Mom's Gazpacho". Try it. You'll like it. It's a good one!

I didn't change a thing, except I served with a dollup of sour cream.

Gazpacho with tomato juice? I don't think so. Plus the combination of basil, cilantro AND parsley must be awful. Each herb is supposed to be enjoyed on it's own but together I would think they just cancel each other out. I didn't and will not make this recipe. To the earlier reviewer, the best gazhacho recipe I know is when you soak several pieces of day-old baguette in a 3:1 mixture of olive & sherry vinegar with some cut-up garlic. Then puree the bread mixture with lots of tomatoes, 1 peeled cucumber and a red pepper. You may add more oil but tomatoes usually release enough fluid. Season with salt, chill well. Garnish with croutons and/or basil (OR cilantro OR parsley) and cubed pieces of bell peppers and cucumbers. Enjoy!

Not wowed. Didn't finish eating it. There's got to be better gazpacho recipes out there. Agree that it is more like salsa.

The recipe is not bad, but why call it gazpacho? A real gazpacho gets its heat from garlic, not jalapeños or other chilies, and dried bread (crumbled) is essential for most of them. This is just Salsa Soup, which is unfortunately what you are likely to get on menus of almost any restaurant outside Spain. Once you have tasted the real thing in Sevilla (or really anywhere in the South of Spain), you can't really stand these sort of things. If you want salsa, eat it with tortilla chips. I don't really mind variations on classics, but it's nice to know what the classic is first. I think jalapeños are too bright a taste to mix into gazpacho (and are the main reason these things taste like Old El Paso salsa to me). The Santa Fé gazpacho used chipotles, at least there's some imagination in flavor combos there. For real gazpacho, try "Classic Andalusian Gazpacho" or "Fresh Tomato Gazpacho," and for the regional variations, "White Gazpacho," "Malaga Almond Gazpacho," "Cordoban Gazpacho," "Lima Bean Gazpacho" or the Portuguese "Gazpacho with Croutons & Sausage."

Very good and very close to my own gazpacho , with the exception that I use vegetable juice in place of tomato juice and about a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice.

I was never a big fan of gazpacho, but this recipe changed my mind. This is a delicious summer soup. Substituted half the tomatoe juice for clamato juice (resulted in a thinner consistency).

Awesome recipe......shows you what the cooks in NJ know!!

I didn't care for this recipe, I wasn't crazy about the overt parsley and cilantro taste in it. Plus, it was too spicy for most of my guests. Next time I'll try a different gazpacho recipe, my husband called it a disaster! Enough said whether I'll make it again or not.

This is a wonderful recipe. I chopped the vegetables a bit finer than the recipe indicates and used a food processor but still left the soup a bit chunky. It takes a long time to prepare because of the peeling and chopping but it is well worth the effort. Top with a dollop of sour cream.
