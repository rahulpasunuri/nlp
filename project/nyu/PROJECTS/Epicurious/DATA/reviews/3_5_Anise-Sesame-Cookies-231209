Forgot to mention that I ground the anise seeds and then soaked them in the boiling water. I too find whole anise seeds not that pleasant to bite into.

Anise is a grown-up taste preference I find. Kids didn't go for these even though the anise flavor was very mild. I used spelt flour which worked fine. Also rolled dough into a log then chilled and just sliced the log into cookies, quick and easy.

These are very good - the texture is excellent. However, I didn't think the sesame seeds added much, and I didn't care for having the whole anise seeds in the cookies. Next time I make these, I will ground the anise seeds so they mix throughout the batter. I also thought they could be sweeter and saltier. I baked two sheets as directed, and for the rest, instead of topping with seeds, I sprinkled with coarse sugar and salt. I liked those much better, and they were just as pretty with sparkling sugar crystals on top. Also, to save time, instead of patting dough into a round and rolling and cutting, I rolled it into a log before chilling, and simply sliced crosswise into thin cookies. Much easier!

These are great, simple cookies not without sophistication. The recipe is easy. I wonder how they'd do with a little anisette....but I didn't have any so...problem solved. Great big meal end-er with some team or fruit.

This cookie is amazing!! I actually added some of the toasted sesame seeds to the cookie dough for added flavor and it made the cookies "sing"! Perfect with a hot cup of tea!

These cookies were great! I would highly recommend making them one day and then rolling out the next. They do get soft rather quickly so the less you put the dough in your hands and roll it around the better. Also, after pouring the boiling water over the anise seeds and letting them set for 15min, I also stuck them in the microwave for 30 sec after the water got cold. To add a Christmas look, skip dying the seeds and sprinkle with red or green sugar.

I'm a big fan of anise and was delighted at the flavor of these. A nice alternative to overloading on holiday sweetness. Served with coffee or tea, a simple dessert which pleased all. Only tip- Keep dough cold and work fast, I only got one or two rolls before sticking back in the fridge. Also, overbaking causes dryness, I recommend max of 10 minutes.

I usually love anything anise but was disappointed with these, both in texture and flavour.

Sorry to be the wet blanket. This is one homely cookie...and with the flavor to match. OK, the flavor was all right, but they were very dry--and I did *not* over roll. In case anyone is inclined to try to spruce them up, I experimented with dyeing the sesame seeds to add some Christmas color, and you can forget it.

Delightful. Made the dough on Friday night and baked the cookies on Saturday. Very simple, nice and light. Excellent with tea.

Oh man, these cookies are awesome! I love anise so that is what caught my eye when searching recipes. The flavor of the anise, with the toasted sesame seeds, it is a combo out of this world! I will definately make these again. They were very easy to make, and infact making the dough one day and baking the next was perfect!

I made these cookies for my co-workers just before Christmas and everyone absolutely adored them, old and young. A quarter of a cup of sesame seeds is a little too much for the amount of cookies you'll end up making.

Question: how would one substitute anise extract in this recipe? It's all I have at home. I think a tablespoon would be much too much. Any suggestions welcome!

These are fabulous, adult cookies. I sent them to 5 people and they all loved them. They ship very well,stay fresh and did not break. I chilled the dough overnight and they were very easy to roll out between sheets of wax paper. The wax paper worked better than parchment.

You can freeze cookies. We always freeze our cookies at Christmas and they stay great for weeks. I'm unsure about freezing dough.

This is a fabulous cookie. Not too sweet, with wonderful, subtle flavors. I used an oak leaf shaped cookie cutter; beautiful with the earthy sesame seeds on top.

I found these cookies delicious and not overly complicated to make. Will definitely make them again and again. To the Cook from Hartford...the recipe didn't seem to take any longer than any other cookies I've made (not counting the store-bought dough) - to save time maybe you could try chilling the dough overnight, thereby breaking the work up over 2 days - the cookie is definitely worth the effort.

Thank you for sharing your receipe. My sister-in-law just emailed me this receipe and I can't wait to try them, as I have been growing a beautiful and fragrant bronze anise herb (shrub/tree) about five years now - actually it re-grows itself and this year is over 6-feet tall and so sweetly delicious. P.S. Can the cookies (or cookie dough itself) be frozen?

Where can we buy the anise sesame cookies; I wouldn't even attempt this recipe - who has all day?! They look great but I'm busy...
