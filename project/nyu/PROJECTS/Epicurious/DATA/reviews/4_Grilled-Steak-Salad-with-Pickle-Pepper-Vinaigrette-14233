The vinaigrette is delicious. Dill pickle is an unusual addition but adds a nice element to it. Used a mix of arugula and spinach, with grilled zucchini & summer squash on the side. My husband wants it again tomorrow.

i love all the ingredients in this receipe so i knew it would be good. i checked other reviewers to see if anyone commented about putting the sauce on the bottom as it seemred strange to me. made it as written except used arugula. next time will decrease the vinegar, mustard and oil by 1 tbs each as i'd like it less saucy and more crunchy and spoon the sauce directly on the steak so you don't need to dig for it. really great flavors and i'll definitely make it again!

I would have given this 31/2 forks if I could. Simple and delicious. Used arugula instead of watercress. Served with butternut squash and bleu cheese cheesecake. Yum!

I just made this for dinner and everyone loved it. We were all going back for more steak to have with our vinaigrette. I only had a poblano pepper and bread and butter pickles on hand so I used those instead, but I believe the overall effect was the same. My mother commented that the vinaigrette really complemented the steak. Agreed. Yummy!

This was delicious and easy - and the flavors reminded me of the fabulous 1984 Gourmet recipe Roast Fillet of Beef with Cornichon Tarragon Sauce which we love for special occasions. This recipe is great as-is, but would also be good with tarragon added.

Oh my god. The combination of slightly bitter watercress with the pungent and tangy vinaigrette went so well together with the steak. Following this recipe to a T made this one of the most perfect dishes I've ever used off of this site. I will make this again, and again, and again.

Used romaine lettuce and grilled a skirt steak to medium rare. Perfect! I also added a little bit of the dill pickle juice. I used 2 tbsp of dijon mustard, and also 1 tbsp of a tangy honey mustard. We had the steak warm (right off the grill), but it would also taste good cold.

This is a terrific buffet party dish. I used a bag of spring mix lettuces. Delicious!

Used a pre-packaged salad mix, didn't have any capers, and used homemade spicy pickles... Very good & very easy. Will definitely make this again.

I made this a few years ago and still remember it as the best steak salad. Interesting flavor combinations and an attractive presentation. Superb.

We made this recipe on a moderately hot summer evening, and found it contained the essence of summer! The smell of cucumbers in the vinegarette, the charcoal flavor of the steak were superb! We served it with homemade bread and a good bordeaux.
