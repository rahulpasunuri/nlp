Don't know what went wrong, but my sabayon was nothing but boozy foam. It was inedible.

Excellent! Served on one scoop of ginger gelato, topped with lots of peaches and a smaller amount of sabayon. Surprise discovery: using limoncello instead of brandy (unexpectedly missing from cabinet) looked like genius -- the light lemon flavor really works. Dinner guest said I should make this and charge $15/serving!

I made this last night for 5 people and it was plenty. Used a Moscato for the sabayon because I didnt have brandy, and a chocolate balsamic vinegar with the peaches and the results were great, everyone raved about it. Will make variations of this again many times, perfect for lactose intolerent and healthy eaters!

Very dependent on having excellent peaches, unlike some other recipes, this will not save mediocre or under-ripe fruit.

The sabayon itself was delicious - we were eating the extra with our spoons (I didn't have the brandy and used extra wine as the recipe suggested). However, I didn't love how the peaches came out. Next time I would slice them thinner and allow the vinegar to penetrate them more, perhaps even cook them a bit.

This sabayon was easy to prepare and the instructions were so clear and made the "mastering" of this special dish uncomplicated and fun to make. It's a great recipe for serving to guests for that special occasion (they'll think you studied in France to learn to make this dish), or serve to your friends or family on a warm summer's day for a very refreshing treat. Use white peaches or nectarines for a little bit of a change from regular yellow ones. I highly recommend this wonderful recipe.

Delicious and easy. The only change I would make is to slice the 6 wedges into thin slices as the large wedge is to hard to eat
