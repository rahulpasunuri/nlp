This was a remarkable idea to smoke scallops. One of the best dishes I have made. The nice thing was that the scallops remained tender thru- out. I am not sure what the marinating contributed for taste and may try it next time without it. I used a reduction of balsamic vinegar and honey to toss diced jerusalem artichokes and it was a great addition to the dish.

Yes, I would make this again but not as written. I too felt that the salt was overpowering. I will make this again, but leave out the salt and sugar, and just sprinkle the scallops with the spice mixture and smoke and cook them as per the recipe. I would sprinkle the fresh cilantro on the scallops after they are cooked. We really enjoyed the spinach dish but a 10 ounce bag would have been plenty. A pound for two prople is too much.

We really liked this recipe, and it was fun to use a new process. I'd never cured any fish before, so it was nice to do it with the scallops. The whole process went well, and we followed it directly as written. The balsamic glaze was a great complement to the sweetness in the scallops. And the spinach w/pancetta complemented the smokiness of the scallops. None of us thought the scallops were salty. So, anyone trying this should be sure to use kosher salt and rinse the scallops before smoking them.

I made this recipe with apprehension after reading the reviews but tried it anyway. It was wonderful! I followed the recipe as written, using Morton coarse kosher salt. We think most restaurant food is too salty, but the recipe turned out great. The only change I made was to saute the scallops for two minutes rather than 4 as they seemed in danger of over cooking. I used a stovetop smoker with hickory "flickers". I would make this again and not change a thing.

Gosh, I have to agree that the salt in this recipe makes what would otherwise be a great dish inedible. What IS the point of the salt?? I will try this again without the salt and see what happens....

Awful. Marinating the scallops for thirty minutes in the salt mixture is a disaster, resulting in inedible scallops that taste as though they were caught in the dead sea. A tremendous waste of good sea scallops. I would love to know how others got better results?

My family was very impressed with this recipe! My husband is a chef, and stated they were better than the scallops he makes. I don't understand why the other critics felt it was too salty unless they substituted regular table salt for the kosher salt. I even forgot to rinse mine before smoking and they still were not that salty. I got rave reviews from the kids also.

This was aweful. I followed instructions to a "t" and the scallops were so salty we couldn't eat them. I can't even give them 1 fork.

TRY THIS! I served this at a dinner party and received rave reviews...instead of using a smoker, I purchased "smoker bags" on cooking.com (use "medium" smoke bags)...this made the process incredibly easy-no cleanup! I bought baby spinach at the local farmers market, and barely sauteed them so they were VERY slightly wilted (the warm balsamic glaze will further the "wilt" on the spinach)

I used a regular charcoal grille with a canister of pecan chips from "Charbroil" catalogue. Any mild wood will do and there's a number of ways to do it. I piled the gray charcoals to the opposite side of the scallops, set down the chips, closed the lid with a slight opening at the vents and turned once for 15 minutes. Fabulous result and the SMELL!

This is a delicious recipe. The only mistake I made was putting too much balsamic on each plate. A little goes a long way. Very impressive and I'll definitely make it again.
