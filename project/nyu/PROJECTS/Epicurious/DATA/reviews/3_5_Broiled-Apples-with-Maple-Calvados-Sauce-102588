I have made this a few time and it is always a hit. Modifications I make: I use dark Bacardi rum instead of the Calvados. I serve the apples over a good vanilla ice cream and top with freshly whipped heavy cream (with a touch of sugar and cinnamon). ENJOY!

It is a good recipee, but if I do it again, I will use less lemon juice and instead of Calvados I would use Brandy instead.

Yum! I can't believe how easy and quick this was. I added some nutmeg and cinnamon, and served with pumpkin ice cream. This recipe is also very easy to divide - as any single gal with a sweet tooth should appreciate!

If I made this again(which I probably won't), I'd add some cinnamon, or nutmeg, or something to give it a bit more flavor. If you like warm apples, this recipe is ok.

Delicious! I'd have to say almost better than a crisp, but you can put your favorite crisp topping on the apples in the last 1-2 minutes of broiling if you'd like. And to the cook from Raleigh, NC- it does have fat, although only a tiny two tablespoons of butter. If you leave them out you'll be sorry.

This is an easy and tasty mid-week dessert. I served with whipped cream--yum.

This recipe is pure goodness, and is all the more elegant for being so simple. It has a great flavor and takes (5 minutes?) to prepare. Also - it's fat-free! Next time, rather than broil the sugared apples for an additional 1-2 minutes at the end, we will use the creme brulee torch to finish them off. Yum! (PS - I have made this both as a dessert and as an accompaniment to ham. Ether way, it's great!)

This is a great dessert! I made it the lazy way - I tossed all the ingredients together in a pan and broiled, stirring it occasionally to make the apples very soft and evenly cooked. The juice, Calvados and syrup mingle to make a delicious sauce. It's excellent with vanilla ice cream. I will be making this every fall, much better than the standard apple pie.

The only difficult part of the melt-in-your mouth recipe is peeling the apples. I took the recipe up to the point of putting the apple slices and butter in the baking dish, then stored it in the refrigerator until after my meal. It was so easy just to pop it into the broiler. Also replaced Calvados with bourbon and it still tasted great.
