Loved this recipe - especially for a weeknighht as it was quick, easy and delicious. I used red pepper because I could not find the cubanelle pepper and substituded canola oil for the olive oil. JMHO: what makes this recipe sensational is using the hummus (I used a spicy one).

Found this recipe when I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for chicken thighs. I didn't even have a red pepper but it was still exceptionally good! Followed other reviews and cut down on oil, used 2 - 3 tablespoons and it was plenty. Used fresh thyme instead of dried oregano. SO tasty! My husband asked me to make again - this is a keeper.

Easy, flavorful workday meal. I've made this many times and everyone likes it. I like that my picky 12 year old can just pick out some of the chicken while the rest of the family gets to add the hummus making a yummy meal. We like the spicy hummus to give it a bit more kick.

Quick, easy and delicious...what's not to like? Like several reviewers, I couldn't find Cubanelle peppers, so I subbed a yellow bell pepper. I also reduced the amount of oil from 1/3 cup to 2 tablespoons, which worked just fine.

A great, quick weeknight meal. I added chopped eggplant to the mixture, a good addition!

Love this! So easy to put together, and comes together in no time. I like to marinate the chicken and the veg for a couple hours before I stick it in the broiler, but it tastes great as written. My local grocery rarely has cubanelle peppers, so I generally sub with a plain ol' green pepper. Super tasty!

This recipe is incredible. I used homemade hummus instead of the pre-packaged stuff. This is defintiely a keeper.

This was so easy and delicious. Because I was cooking for two, I halved the recipe so only used one pepper (the red bell). I used hummus from Trader Joe's and the recipe was so quick it was almost faster than stopping for fast food. This will be a regular at our house.

Who would have thought that chicken and hummus would taste so elegant together? This is so easy to make, and can be served as a special meal for company or as a quick dish when you're tired and don't feel like cooking much. I make a large batch of hummus with cumin using this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Hummus-237832 and freeze some of it so I can put this together quickly at any time.

This is a wonderful recipe we make regularly now. It is so quick and easy for a weeknight meal! I am gluten-free, so I enjoy this dish with blue corn tortilla chips instead of pita bread.Love it!

Fast, easy, healthy, and my son loves it. I add a few whole peeled garlic cloves.

I thought this recipe was great. So very easy. I could not find Italian frying or Cubanella. I substituted Anaheim and yellow banana along with the red. My husband requested next time make more peppers. Also used a spicy hummus from Whole Foods. Will make this again and again.

This was really simple and very tasty. I only had 1 lb chicken breast and substituted 1 head of broccoli (florets only) for the peppers and onions. I had to take the broccoli out after 8 min to prevent too much charring and left the chicken in for another few minutes. I have a bottom drawer broiler so can't adjust the dish position relative to the heat. Served it with "Hummus with Yogurt and Lemon" recipe from this site. Great combo - would definitely serve again.

This recipe is incredibly easy! I doubled the spices and added 2 or 3 cloves of garlic. I had time so I marinated the chicken for a few hours. Had an Anaheim and jalepeno pepper, so I used those. Wow! My broiler was 6 in. from the pan....the only thing I will do differently next time is to put the pan higher for a few minutes to get a better char. Try this one!!

Needed something easy, yet flavorful and a bit unique, for guests and this filled the need. The preparation was all done before guests arrived and the cooking takes place without you and is quick, so it's good for entertaining, as you have time with guests.---- Variations: Marinated the chicken in the spiced oil a few hours (with a little extra spice and garlic); added artichoke hearts and just used the red onion, with plain green, yellow, and red peppers. Served with bowls of feta cheese, Kalamata olives, and toasted pine nuts to put on at their discretion. VERY tasty!

I love this dish. This is now one of my comfort food recipes. The only thing I do is reduce the amount of oil because it turns out too oily. Otherwise, it's great, and the Cubanelle peppers are awesome.

Rating: 3
Very tasty - I added a little olive tapenade that I happen to have in the fridge. Only mistake I made is that I put too much hummus down / per topping - you really only need a few dollups per serving. would be a fun and impressive thing to make for company - and very easy.

Rating: 3
This was really good! Even my picky 14-year-old who thinks I make chicken too often said it was great. I added kalamata olives and garlic per other reviewers' suggestions. I didn't use onion or the frying pepper because I didn't have any. The red pepper was great. I also served it with the large "Israeli" couscous that I have recently become obssessed with.

Delicious and quick dish. I found the chicken to be a little bland. I will probably use more spices next time. I also prepared the chickpea puree from this site. Yummy!

We did this on the barbecue and it turned out great. I tripled the recipe for a crowd of 12 and served it on a couple of platters. Everyone loved it. And it's wonderfully healthy.

To Toronto: Roasted red peppers in a can are usually watery and blah. Try it again with raw peppers.

Blah. Nothing special. I used canned roasted red pepper and it didn't make it more flavourful - just more watery.

This has become my staple dish for last-minute get togethers with friends. It is extremely easy to make and remember (the recipe is now engrained in my memory). The combination of colors and flavors is perfect for any time of year. I add quite a bit more of each spice than is called for in the recipe and I have also added green and yellow peppers to throw in more color and bulk up the recipe.

I've made this dish several times. It's tasty and it's quick. Tonight I had it done and on the table in 24 minutes, and that included prep (which included butchering split breasts). I like some of the other reviewers' ideas about adding feta and/or olives.

I was doubtful I admit but this recipe was both delicious and easy. I marinated the chicken in cumin etc. for a couple of hours. I also added artichoke hearts. Instead of the hummus I made the chick pea puree from this website.

So delicious! I have never wanted to burn something in my oven so badly before =P In fact, this was my first time broiling anything and it was a great recipe to start with. As others have said; it's very easy to put together, I even halved the recipe as I'm a bachelor and don't have 4 mouths to feed (although that's questionable hehe). Someone else suggested adding roasted pine nuts and feta cheese, which sounded really nice, so I followed along with that idea and was not disappointed. An absolutely great and easy dish! Will definitely be making it again.

This is awesome. I made it 5 times already and everyone loved it. I used red bell peppers so far and it was really good. I also put less oil.

This was one of the best and easiest meals I have prepared in a long time. I did add the kalamata olives. Used the hummus recipe with the wrap sandwich on this site. Add lots more garlic and lemon and cilantro. Also a repeat.

I used an Anaheim chili instead of a Cubanelle. Next time I will add extra peppers and onions.

You wont find a better dish than this in the finest restaurants. Even my 10-year-old son likes it. I add about a cup of halved, pitted kalamata olives to the dish, and then top it with feta cheese, roasted pine nuts (just browned in a pan on the burner), and chopped cilantro. The flavors, especially with the olives, are delightful.

I can't even begin to tell you how good this is. My husband went back for thirds (and he usually doesn't like my healthy dishes!) I'll be making it at least once a week. Quick, easy, and pretty!

This is the easiest recipe short of a bowl of cereal!! And tasty and healthy. I add some feta on the top...some fresh oregano leaves if my herb plants haven't died on me. Its the best recipe going if you are lazy, like to eat good food and don't have anyone else around who will cook it for you!

Delicious and easy weeknight recipe. I've made it twice -- the second time I added whole garlic cloves, which I definitely recommend. Sabra's olive hummus is the way to go.

3 1/2 forks! Quick, easy, yummy...i made w/ greek country salad, and figs w/ black pepper honey and goat cheese...(from epicurious) i added eggplant chunks, took away the red onion and next time will use less olive oil....

This chicken dish is really good. The only change I made is that I added more veggies. I cubed eggplant and chunks of cabbage (family loves roasted cabbage) and asparagus (the tips get very crunchy). I also increased the amounts and froze it in dinner-sized portions so that I can have it again without any effort. As a rule, my husband hates hummus and was very pleasantly surprised when he found out that hummus was the "sauce" that he loved. It is a great combination.

Wow! What a yummy recipe! It was real easy to make. I'm planning to add it to our regular eating menu.

My family loved this. BUT I made homemade hummus, which made a big difference. It is really easy to make and I used a recipe that had lots of tahini and lemon juice. Aside from that, the chicken was moist, tender and flavorful and went well with the hummus. I made the hummus a bit on the thin side to be more like a sauce and less bulkly like a starch.

Already made this three times! Tasty, healthy, and SO simple. Used tortilla bread instead...not as dry as pita. Also good with crumbled Feta when serving. 8 minutes total was NOT enough time to broil. Somewhere between 12 and 15 did the trick.

Good simple recipe- I made exactly as directed, & next time I'll just add a clove or two of minced garlic & a better hummus (Trader Joe's probably), but otherwise very delicious. I had preheated the broiler, & I cooked it for just a minute longer than directed & the chicken was perfect. Also, I used tenderloins cut into quarters which made it even quicker. BF loved it!

This recipe was easy and very tasty. We cooked for quite a bit longer than directed, as we wanted to ensure the chicken was cooked. This was fine to do, because the ingredients made the chicken moist and everything combined really well. Would make again when in a rush especially.

Definitely not complicated by any means, but delicious for the minimal amount of effort required. The simple combination of spices perfectly complemented the chicken and peppers/onions...a keeper that I will make again!

This was a GREAT meal. It was really flavorful. Not sure if my broiler has a weak flame, but it took about 15+ minutes to cook. We took it out when the peppers looked really charred around the edges, and at that point, the chicken was on the moist side of done. Good olive oil probably helped, and I think the recommended peppers are the best way to go since they produced an impressive flavor combination with the spices and 'classic' hummus. I cut the oil a little bit, and it was still plentiful.

I actually really liked this dish. Granted, you don't have to be a culinary genius to prepare it, but it was a nice, easy alternative to (boring) weeknight chicken. Also, the chicken stayed very moist. Next time, I might also add eggplant and some other veggies.

Eh. OK for a weekday meal if you're really pressed for time. Not a great sign when the hot pita you serve alongside is the highlight of the dish.
