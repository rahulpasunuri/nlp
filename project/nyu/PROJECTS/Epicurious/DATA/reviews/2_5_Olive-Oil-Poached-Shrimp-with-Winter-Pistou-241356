The pistou recipe, as written, is subtle, and I agree it is improved with the addition of a couple of cloves of garlic. The olive-oil POACHED shrimp were sublime -- not fried, but poached! Excellent!

Bland. Very disappointing.

very bland. perhaps with lots more garlic this might have some flavor. maybe some carmelized onions would help. i also did not deep fry shrimp, but just sauteed them.

This was a great recipe. Very fresh. I doubled the garlic, however. It was great served with french bread to dip in the sauce. I also didn't fry the shrimp, I just sauteed them in olive oil to make it even healthier. Very good for a summerr evening on the porch.
