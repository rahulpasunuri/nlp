Love the combo of butter, black pepper, mint and peas. I have lots of mint growing in the backyard and always trying to find ways to use it. Other than in alcoholic drinks that is lol. This is perfect as my husband and I love mint. Not sure why people would want to omit the mint! I added more! Anyways I omitted the sugar from the recipe and it was still very good.

This a great recipe- easy, fast,good presentation and really delicious every time. It's always a surprise hit. I use Splenda, by the way, and it still tastes great!

Simple and Delicious. I often make this recipe except I usually add all ingredient-not including the mint or sugar-in the pot without draining off the water. I followed this recipe without the mint. I now prefer this method over my old method. Will definitely make again.

This is nice with anything remotely Mediterranean in flavor. I didn't have the full amount of mint but it was still good.

This is a delicious spring dish. It's nice to add some shallots sautéed in butter. You can also reduce the mint a little if you're not a mint fanatic.

This is a great vegetable side dish for family or company. Fast, showy, tasty and with peas, it really is fine to use frozen.
