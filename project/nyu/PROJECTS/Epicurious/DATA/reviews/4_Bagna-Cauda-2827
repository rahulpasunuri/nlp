Made for new years eve 'make your own' ravioli dinner party. served with crudite while we were rolling out pasta, the remainder was pressed into service as a ravioli sauce. a BIG hit both ways. A DEFINITE keeper, and I do not even like anchovies!

Including cream or mayo is NOT the traditional Italian way - and is an abomination of a great recipe. Do it the right way, no processor and no cream or mayo if you want your meal to be authentic. This has been a tradition in my family for decades, and we introduce it to all of our neighbors and friends, who beg for more.

OMG--how wonderful; my first experience with this sauce of nirvana. So easy, so wonderful. Made exactly as directed. Thank you! Sandra McNally

I have been making this recipe for years and never put the ingredients in a processor. I just put everything in the pot, brown the garlic a little bit first and then let the heat disolve the anchovies and melt the butter and simmer, then you get nice pieces of garlic and anchovie mash with your veg. Fantastic. I will have to try it this way once.

Many different sites had many different ways of cooking this dip--this was the easiest (none were that hard) and it was delicious. Anchovy-dislikers didn't taste anchovies, just a good, garlicky, olive oil dip.

This is an excellent New Year's Eve, or any other party favorite. This recipe is the original - and is the best.

This is standard New Years Eve fare in our family. We cut up pieces of beef, cauliflower, zucchini, mushrooms, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and eggplant on platters. Using a large electric pan works best for parties.Everyone puts in what they want, let it simmer before pulling out with a fondue fork onto slices of sourdough bread. Whatever you take out, you replace from the platters. Never heard of putting cream or mayo in, and I won't try it, either. Haven't found anyone who doesn't LOVE this.

This is good, but I'll rather make my northen italian grandmother's recipe next time... With cream.

Made it for an Italian themed party and it was a major hit. Couldn't be easier to make and is a real crowd pleaser. Made it exactly as is.

I love Bagna Cauda and this recipe is the easiest. As others have stated...don't mess with it, especially with cream or MAYO...then it's not Bagna Cauda at all. For a special occassion, try serving large to jumbo poached shrimp as dippers (leaving the tail intact)and of course include the bread in place of a napkin. Big hit.

I brought this to a coctail party on a boat in the Bahammas . I served it with artichock and added two tablespoons of Mayonaise to thiken it a bit. It was a hit. I beleive I got it from the Bon Appetit magizine in the 60's

OH MY! This was sublime. I found the richness was a bit lost on the beautiful veggies, so I just used bread! Mmmmmm......

FABULOUS!!!!! Made this Christmas Eve and my family/friends LOVED and devoured every last bit of it. Followed the recipe exactly...will definately double it next Christmas.

I used a whole stick of butter and whisked in about 6 tablespoons of cream and let it simmer a bit to thicken. The creamy version of the sauce adheres to the vegetables much better than the oily version (and I think it tastes smoother). If it starts to seperate, just whisk it up again. I also add to mine: 1-2 tablespoons finely chopped italian parsley, a pinch of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon or so of white truffle oil. It may not be authentic, but it's good! Endive is great for dipping because it works sort of like a little spoon... also good are celery, fennel, sweet peppers, artichoke hearts... and of course, cardoni if you can find them.

This is great stuff. I added a splash of brandy and substituted butter for part of the olive oil. We love it with steamed artichokes. But, dribbling a little over your steak sure doesn't hurt anything either! You gotta try it.

This recipe is a holiday season favorite in my family. We put cream in ours too. We cook the ingredients in an electric frying pan right in the center of the table. Everyone stands around the table and dips the vegetables. Favorites in my family are cabbage, lettuce, mushrooms and celery. We don't cut the vegetables into bite-size pieces. We tear the lettuce & cabbage so that we can dip pieces of it directly into the sauce without using forks. Sometimes the lettuce doesn't hold up too well. The mushrooms are left in the pan for a while to cook.

a variation for taste would be one inch plus cubes of your favorite beef, lamb, or pork and eaten with your dipping sauces.

This is also made substituting heavy cream for most of the olive oil. Cook over med heat until mixture thickens. Chinese celery is especially good for dipping. Eat a coffee bean afterward to get rid of some of the garlic aroma, the anchovies are on their own.
