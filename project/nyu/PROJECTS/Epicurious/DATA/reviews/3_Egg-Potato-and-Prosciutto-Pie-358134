Altered recipe for 2 people: I split ingredients in half, and baked it in a 9 x 3 in bread loaf pan instead. Perfect amount for brunch for two! I also used pancetta and baby red potatoes instead of the original ingredients. I added some oregano just under the top pastry crust, but i feel it could have had even more flavor and might even benefit from some cheddar cheese as the final layer before the crust.

I don't understand the purpose of preheating a baking sheet. Is it to help the bottom crust bake?

Because some are fussy about the 'doneness' of eggs, try beating them and pour over the potato layer. This method might not make for a flakey bottom crust.

I made this for our weekly work meeting. While this was good, it didn't blow everyone out of the water. Prepare yourself to be patient for the frozen pastry, let it thaw, and fix it if it breaks--no biggie. It is a simple dish, very European. Decadence would be adding cheese, which this does not. Soup it up with some real Italian prosciutto and not domestic. It's actually quite fun to make, cracking the eggs and making them behave themselves. Be wary of those that are picky about their eggs. The community pan always seems to make some uncomfortable even if the eggs aren't runny--who knew?
