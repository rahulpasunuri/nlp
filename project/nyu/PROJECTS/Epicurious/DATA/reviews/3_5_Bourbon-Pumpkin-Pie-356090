pie crust is wrong. No flour, or crumb or other dough component.

This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever made or tasted--and I try a new pumpkin pie recipe every year! I think I'll stick with this one from now on--the bourbon was perfect (the full amount), and it was worth the trouble of roasting a garden pumpkin and pureeing the flesh. The texture of this pie is spot on.

this has become one of our holiday standards and I'm looking forward to making it again soon. simply a wonderful combination of flavors.

Absolutely Great Pie. I used a ready made pie crust and this has been a standard at Thanksgiving & Christmas since '09. I also subsituted sweet potatoes for the pumpkin for a picnic lunch dessert last spring & it was still great.

This recipe is perfect and a big hit with my family! Used gingersnaps as recommended by another reviewer. This recipe is easy and highly recommended.

I suppose that in using fresh roasted squash I should have pureed & strained it REALLY GOOD before adding it to the cream cheese mixture. I did not, and as a result - the cheesecake portion had a bit of stringy-ness and too much pumpkin clumped up in spots. However, I don't really care for the flavored pumpkin cheesecake filling anyway, I would, in the future, follow the bourbon sour cream recipe and add that to a simple cheesecake filling. I'm pretty basic when it comes to cheesecakes, and I should probably remember this the next time I make one.

An update to my original review: I made this myself this year, following the recipe exactly except that I used 2.5T spiced rum and 1T maple syrup instead of the bourbon (it was what I had on hand). Husband liked it better than the original, and declared it the best pumpkin pie ever. I dislike pumpkin pie but I tasted this and thought it was pretty good - I liked the spicing (no clove, which is a good thing) and I think the spiced rum highlighted the other flavors nicely. There is too much filling for one regular sized pie, however - I made two smaller pies and reduced the cooking time, but next time I may use a deep dish pie plate as suggested.

I've been baking pies for 45 years and this is absolutely the best pumpkin pie i ever made or tasted. While some pumpkin pies are over spiced, the flavors in this recipe were beautifully balanced. I made this pie twice (once for thanksgiving, once for Christmas) and both times were a success. Even people who are not pumpkin pie lovers couldn't resist. I used my own crust, but the filling easily gets 4 stars.

If you like this, try Shartlesville Pumpkin Pie. It was in the Encyclopedia Cookbook (originally published 1948 - ours was the 1960s edition) but someone has posted the recipe on the internet at http://janetelainesmith.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_archive.html. The differences are mainly two: first, the ECB recipe separates the egg whites - this makes all the difference to the texture of the pie, and you must try it if you adopt no other aspect of the pie. Secondly, they have just 1/3 cup cream and 1 cup (not a misprint) of whiskey. We found the alcohol too strong and reversed these to 1/3 cup whiskey and 1 cup cream - this made an acceptable family pie (i.e. okay for us to eat as kids) with tremendous flavour - the alcohol brings out the other flavours and makes the whole pie much more aromatic. I would strongly recommend you try this if you like pumpkin pie and are not teetotal.

A friend made this recipe at my suggestion for our Thanksgiving and although I am not a fan of pumpkin pie in general, I found this one to be quite good. She mentioned that she didn't have quite as much bourbon as called for and that she added a spoonful of maple syrup to make up for it but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. She found that she had more filling than she needed to fill a 9" pie crust (although her crust shrank quite a bit with blind baking). The pie was quite creamy and flavorful with none of the weird grainy/eggy texture I normally associate with pumpkin pie. This will be my standard from now on!

fantastic. even my very particular husband said it was the best ever. didn't find it wet at all, just smooth and creamy. like grandma's, but with a naughty side.

Too wet, not pumpkiny enough, and a kind of off color. Not a success, but not vile. I fed the leftovers to the chickens, who gave it 2 forks.

I didn`t think this was as tasty as the old standard on the pumpkin can.

This pie was only so-so. The bourbon flavor wasn't especially distinctive and none of the other ingredients came through enough to save the dish. It wasn't especially pumpkin-y tasting, and was a bit too sweet (I think due to the bourbon). Either add more bourbon or go for a different recipe.

I've been making pumpkin pies for decades (not continuously) and this is the best. Four tablespoons of Russell's Reserve was just right.

great recipe, made 2 pies, added one extra egg to firm up the filling on the last pie and it turned out even better

I just made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was truly the best pumpkin pie I have ever made. It got stellar reviews at the table, even from picky children. While this is certainly NOT a low-cal dessert, the cup of heavy cream and the 1/3 cup sour cream make for an incredibly smooth, silky texture. One note: I cut the bourbon down to 2 TBSP because I didn't want it to overwhelm the essential pumpkin flavor, and it was just right: a touch, but not too much. I loved it so much I'm making it again today!

Very OK. Flavor was quite average, texture very moist (wet, even, to me). I cooked it in a convection oven and it still took almost 1 1/2 times the baking time to set up. I wouldn't make it again.

Wonderful recipe! Love the creamy consistency of the pie. I used Maker's Mark, and it turned out delicious!

This is a great pumpkin pie! I had some Jack Daniel's so thats what I used. It gave a nice sutle flavor. I'm going to make this again for thanksgiving (I also might make another w/ a little more Jack)
