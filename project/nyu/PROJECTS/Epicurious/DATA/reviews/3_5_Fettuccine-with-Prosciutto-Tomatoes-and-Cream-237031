I really only used this recipe for the sauce because I sauteed a sliced Polish kielbasa and red pepper in olive oil instead of Prosciutto (although I would try that, too). I agree with another poster that there is no need to drain the tomatoes. I also tossed in a handful of halved grape tomatoes, fresh basil with the parsley and some red pepper flakes for some zing. This tastes amazing the next day!

This was simple, delicious, and deceptively filling. I upped the garlic (6 or 7 cloves!) and used fresh tomatoes from the garden, which required a little more time cooking down. The sauce tasted better the next morning and was great spread on homemade bread.

This was just OK. The ingredients are all good, and it's easy, but somehow - it just lacked something. I also found it to be a little dry. Luckily, I had the liquid from the tomatoes and could add a couple of tablespoons of that to the sauce so it would coat the fettuccine. There are much better pasta recipes out there.

This was very, very good. I added extra garlic and about 2 teaspoons dried sage. I also used penne. As I had the time, I also cooked down the tomatoes in a cup of red wine. This took longer but my family doesnt always like uncooked tomatoes. The crispy prosciutto was delightful! I agree do not add salt.

I used 2 cans of tomatoes, a little less pasta and added about a pound of shrimp. Wonderful!

I've made this twice for company. I used penne but I think any pasta would be good. I would not add the salt at the end; the prosciutto has plenty. I used 6 oz of prosciutto but it could be made with less.

Quick, easy and tasty. I made as written (maybe a little extra garlic and cheese) and thought it was a good, simple meal. I wouldn't add any salt to the sauce, wait until after you've topped with prosciutto to see if you want more salt. Next time I may use orecchiette and add some grilled shrimp or salmon...yummy!

Yum. A nice, light dish. Three of us split this recipe using it as our main dish. With a side or two it could make a full meal. I was speculative of needing to use so many tomatoes and having only two cans in stock, I was sure it would be find, but I would really recommend the full three cans. Then the pasta would have more to it.

I loved this. I didn't have all the ingredients and susbstituted for some, but it was still great. I cooked this with butter/garlic shrimp. And I added crumbled feta. Delish!

Delicious fettucine. The taste is not too overpowering, but just right. It can be used as a side or a main dish, good for adults and kids alike.

This is a great recipe for everyone, even the kids. The second time I made it I added chunks of fresh mozzerella and used cooked pancetta instead of proscuitto.

Great, quick pasta dish. Much more flavor than I expected. I did use more tomatos than called for, and a bit more cream. Mixing the pasta and sauce together is a must!

Nothing can beat a good ten minute pasta dish! I cut the recipe in half for my husband and I. I added a little sugar and some fresh basil to the sauce for a little extra flavor. Also, I placed the drained Fettuccine in the sauce to heat through rather than putting the pasta on the plate and putting the sauce on top. My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much. The next time I am going to serve it with a nice grilled chicken breast and green salad. This one is a keeper!

I made this per directions and liked it, but next time, I'll make several changes. 1. Use #9 spaghetti. 2. Use thick-sliced prosciutto. 3. Use 2 large cans crushed tomatoes. 4. Use combination of cheeses. 5. As suggested, add shrimp. Also, I followed Lydia Bastianich's instructions for using pasta with sauce. Instead of putting pasta in a bowl, I returned it to pan with sauce and let it absorb sauce until al dente.

I've made this dish for years and it is always enjoyed. If you want to do a meatless version, saute some shrimp instead of the prosciutto and substitue a chiffonade of fresh basil for the parsley. It also works well.

This dinner was easy and delicious. It seemed very gourmet but didn't take much to prepare. We made this for our family and served it with a salad. Excellent!

I loved this recipe, and it was so quick. I was able to get it on the table, after running late from work, as if I was there all day. The flavors really come at you.

I thought this dish was terrific! It was quick and easy to prepare. Not only was it delicious, but it looked like a million bucks on the plate, too. The only thing I would do differently next time, is to cut down on the amount of tomatoes. I believe two cans would be plenty. Definitely a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe for pasta. I tried it with thin spaghetti, and liked it much better than the fettuccine. I also used only 2 cans of tomatoes. Enjoy!
