Had no yogurt so used reduced fat sour cream instead. Made a very good dressing with little effort.

I think this is quite possibly the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had. Then again, my husband thought it was bizarre. (He likes the stuff you get from a 60 gallon drum at the salad bar.) Anyway, I thought it was awesome and very, very tasty.
