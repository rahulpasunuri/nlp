This is killer! Have made it several times. Did not have any walnuts on hand, so just used almonds and pecans. For reason my pantry was missing sesame seeds, but I did have black sesame seeds and they worked wonderfully. Was great with my homemade jalapeno jelly. Right after I made it the first time, I had it at one her restaurants, the recipe is just like what they serve.

First I read other reviews...and I have to laugh about the "very caloric"...really!... it's fried CHEESE! I found this rrcipe about 12 years ago when I discovered this most excellent web site...I've made it many many times and always get rave reviews. I slice granny smith apples and roast walnuts to serve...fabulous!

KemoSabe, along with Island Prime are two locations from where you can sample this wonderful treat. Rather than buy the jelly consider making it yourself. Ms. Scott sent me the receipe for the bree and jelly years ago after she first appeared in Bon Appetit! Enjoy

I had this dish at the restaurant very long time ago, and I always wished I had the recipe. Now that I know how to make this, I serve it every time when I want to impress my guests. Never failed. Since I dont always have jalapeno jelly, I often make my own chutney with any fruits I have. They go very well with the cheese, and they can be seasonal for the occasion.

Huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly, except the wedges I found were 1 oz, instead of 2 (and frankly, that was just the right size. 2 oz would have been too big for an hors d'oeuvres). Served with jalapeno jelly and on a baguette slice (couldn't find squaw bread). Extremely popular - everyone was raving. Really very simple to make, if a little messy during the frying stage. Will definitely make these again!

Loved this appetizer and it will be a keeper. A really new way to serve brie that has impressed all my guests. I substituted a little bit of breadcrumbs for some of the nuts because the nuts can overpower the subtle flavor of the brie.

This was an excellent appetizer, my guests absolutely devoured it. Be careful though, it gets brown very quickly. You don't need more than 3 minutes. I served it with grilled tortillas sprinkled with cumin and both red & green jalepeno jelly, so it was very colorful. The roasted garlic is a must. In fact, you really need 2 heads of garlic.

Mine was a disaster. I think the brie wound up melting into the peanut oil because all I was able to fish out was a fried cheese rind... Either this is a tricky recipe or I missed something very basic... Anyone else with a similar experience?

I'm soooo excited to have this recipe! It's my absolute favorite dish at Kemo Sabe and I tell everyone how wonderful it is. However, an important component of the recipe is left out: honey-roasted garlic. Cut the top off of a garlic, drizzle it with honey (possibly olive oil?) and roast it 'til it's nice and soft. At Kemo Sabe the cheese is served with jalapeno jelly, honey-roasted garlic and fresh baked squaw bread. Nothing I have ever eaten compares to this dish. And if you're ever in San Diego, be sure to stop in as the entire menu is divine!

My mother makes this recipe at Christmastime and it is fantastic. The gooey, warm brie contrasts so well with the crunchy outer coating and I definitely recommend the jalapeno jelly. One difference, though: mom makes them with Japanese panko and nuts (usually almonds) in the crust. The panko has a truly unique texture and a great crunch.

I actually served this with mixed greens with a balsamic vinegrette and some garlic. It was yummy!!

This is a great recipe!! My girls request it for our annual boating vacation.

A keeper. This recipe is different, looks good and is yummy. Even my husband who dislikes nuts liked this. The jalepeno jelly gives this a much more distinctive taste.

I actually have not yet tested the recipe, but I did have it at Deborah Scott's other restaurant in San Diego, The Indigo Grill. It was awesome. It was the best thing I had there--and my guests and I (a group of personal chefs) tried quite a few things off the menu. I highly recommend it.

delicious, but i dislike party food than cannot be prepared ahead of time. (don't like the mess from frying.) Who asked the question about the rind? If you are a Brie fan, you would not be asking that question.

My family loved it.

I have heard that the rind contains antibiotic elements. So, if you are feeling under the weather, eat more brie? ;)

Who took the rind off the brie !!!!! Its a travesty to steal the rind from the brie. Never separate the rind from the gooey part. AND NEVER cut off the nose!

I have the same question as the person below - do you include the rind when you fry the wedges? Can someone please help? Many thanks...

We loved this recipe using Camembert. One word of advice would be to make certain that the oil is rather hot.

Do you cut if the rind to make this dish?

This is absolutely incredible when served at Kemo Sabe. You *must* try it with the Jalapeno Jelly, as it gives it a sweet/hot taste that goes so well with the roasted garlic, and brie. I haven't tried it at home yet, but will!

I followed recipe exactly--and I think this is a good thing to do with leftover brie, e.g., a wheel you've already cut into and can't serve to guests as is. On the other hand, I don't think I'd go buy one to do this. Very caloric! I will admit that our guests were enthusiastic...served it with thin sliced pear and stone ground wheat crackers.

I don't know if this is "cheating" but I didn't make this recipe....but I *did* have a chance to sample it at the restaurant. All I can say is WOW!

I loved the combination of flavors, and my guests raved. I found the nuts coated very thickly on the cheese if I wasn't careful, and the flavor of the cheese was completely overpowered by the nuts. I will be more careful next time.

This is easy and a wonderfully yummy addition to my appetizer recipes. I didn't see the need for the jalapeno jelly either. I toasted the baguette slices slightly, added thinly sliced apples to the plate, and it was awesome!

This is a great appetizer! It's not exactly healthful but it tastes delicious! I don't think it is enough for 8 servings unless you have another appetizer.

Since I do not appreciate Jalapeno Jelly, and had ripe pears on hand, I enjoyed this Fried Brie with fresh pear slices--and did not need the baguette slices either. The Brie's nutty crust, combined with the juices of perfectly ripened pear slices, was just right
