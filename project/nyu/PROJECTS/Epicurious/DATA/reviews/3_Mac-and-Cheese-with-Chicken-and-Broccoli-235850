Had a taste for mac and cheese; had L/O baked pork roast and fresh asparagus tips on hand, and went mucking around for a recipe. Decide to try this one, and am SO GLAD I did. Granted, I modified the original recipe a lot, but isn't that what it is all about??? WHO ever makes a recipe verbatim?? Used a combo of 1/2 shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese, and also 1/2 shredded mild Cheddar cheese. These cheeses combined wonderfully with the asparagus and pork. I also popped the asparagus into the pasta water at about 2 minutes before the pasta was done. And, NEVER use ALL that heavy cream!!! Two percent milk left the sauce creamy and cheesy, and NOT super rich and filling. Even I, who is intimidated by a salt shaker, added some salt and a lot of pepper to this. IT WAS EXTREMELY GOOD AND LIGHT...BE CREATIVE!!!

This recipe turned our wonderfully! Be sure to add the cheese in parts, not all at once.

I executed as stated but the sauce was a big lump of cheese. I poured in about half a glass of milk and stirred to thin it out. Other than that, it tasted great and was relatively easy to put together.

Totally decadent and absolutely delicious, in my opinion. I added some black forest ham. Had no fontina, so subbed some pepper jack (added a wonderful kick) and some parmesan. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I halved the recipe and had more than enough for four people. Everyone loved it.

I made some alterations to this recipe based on dietary restrictions and what I had on hand, but perhaps my changes will be useful for someone else. I'm somewhat lactose intolerant, so I made the roux with soy milk. I used the same quantity required in the recipe, but just added a bit more flour to help thicken it. For the cheese, I used a semi-aged goat cheese (more easily tolerated for some with lactose intolerance). Finally, I added a bit of cayenne to give it a kick. Good, quick, and easy!

After adding 1/2 cup grated parm and some bacon and thickening up the sauce a bit, it was great. I also added Chachere's to the chicken for a distinct kick. I was able to get 6 healthy portions out of it.

I was not thrilled with this one....not cheesy enough. I will try it again though and add a few things...I did find that adding chicken and broccoli really helped make it a well rounded meal.

I made this making some changes and my husband, who is not a mac and cheese fan, finished his plate. I used a rotisserie chicken, I also added Parm Reg along with the other two cheeses, and seasoned with plenty of salt and pepper. I was going to add the bacon, but did not think that it really needed it. I also used two cups of heavy cream and two cups of whole milk. When it was all done, I added some bread crumbs to the top, drizzled a touch of olive oil, and broiled for a crunchy crust.

I would recommend this recipe for anyone who has children 2 years and up. This is the only way I can get my son to eat meat, by "disguising" it in a dish. I used stir fry chicken strips which I marinating for 30 minutes in SoyVay Veri Veri Teriyaki Marinade, then once cooked I set aside and cut into smaller pieces. And I steamed my broccoli in a steam bag - very easy and quick. Made the sauce according to recipe, but I sauted garlic in the butter (used butter with salt as that is all I had on hand) before going onto the next step. I only had Emmentaler and Cheddar on hand. And I used mini penne pasta (for the child). It was great and both my husband and son liked it!

Thought it was good but could have used some nutmeg to add a little something to the sauce.

this was ok...the pancetta or bacon would have given it more flavor. I used half and half and less of it to make it have more flavor. I grilled the chicken with cajun spices but i don't think I had enough chicken. Nice ideas that I may expand on.

this was a great recipe. i substituted smoked turkey sausage for the chicken, and simply pan fried it. also added peas and used penne pasta. i did cut down slightly on the whipping cream (only 2 cups) with about 1.5 cups of skim milk to try and make it slightly more healthy. also used gruyere cheese, because the grocery did not have fontina. it still all worked real well.

I really enjoyed this dish and it was pretty simple. Next time, I would recommend cutting down on the cream and bumping up the cheese. I'll definitely make this again, following the suggestions for other reviews of ways to spice it up. Very versatile.

This has become a regular in the line-up. It's so easy using a grocery store roasted chicken as a short cut. I also spice it up a bit my way. All-in-all, a bit rich, but delicious.

Made this last night. I used half & half instead of cream, added cayenne peppper and bacon. Also, I used smoked cheddar as that is what I had on hand. My family really enjoyed it but it made a lot of pasta and there's a lot left over and I'm not sure it's going to reheat too well. Next time, might cut the amount in half.

Excellent - my husband requests it all the time. I find lots of black pepper help boost the flavor. Tip - use chicken tenders instead of breasts, quicker to cook and faster to cut.

I hate Mac & Cheese, but I loved this dish. Went a little heavier on the cheeses and also added some sliced mushrooms.

I used fontina and a black diamond wisconsin cheddar and it was really good. Definitely can't reheat very well, and honestly, I don't really think it needs the chicken. But the cheese combo was really good!

agree with cook from NYC--not a whole lot of flavor to speak of. i added lots more cheese than the recipe called for, but without MAJOR extra seasoning this is a big ol' disappointment. made it for a week of dinners for myself, and now i'm stuck with it. oy.

Disappointed - no real flavor, but still somehow rich - too rich to eat very much

I adored this recipe. The fontina and cheddar are wonderul together, I opted toward a more subtle flavor by getting smoked cheddar, it wasn't quite as sharp and it added a great flavor. Be careful that the sauce does not come out too runny (follow directions well). Other than that, i loved it and some macaroni-and-cheese-haters became converts!

This was a fantastic recipe. After making it once or twice according to the recipe, this last time we twisted things a bit, blending the chives in the blender with some olive oil to make them more fine and bring out the flavor. I also added some crumbled bacon that we'd saved from breakfast the same morning; it added a great texture to the dish, and the flavor of the bacon really accentuated the greatness of the dish. A fantastic recipe, which we'll definitely mak again. For those vegetarians out there, we made a separate veggie batch with sauteed tofu and it was fantastic as well!

ok, so i read the reviews of this dish and tried the recipe for myself, and i loved it! all those people that can't handle the fat in the recipe...DON'T make this dish! i mean honestly, don't write about how much fat is in a recipe, we can all read and see. we're chefs not your doctor!! if you follow the recipe and have some culinary common sense (like seasoning with salt and pepper) this recipe is one of the best out there.

I admit that I tried to make this recipe more healthy by substituting whole milk for four cups (!) of whipping cream (!!), but the result was gross--the cream sauce watery and grainy. I think that the proportions of roux (butter and flour combo) to milk/cream are off. I would try it again (with milk), doubling the butter and flour. Then again, you can probably take any decent mac and cheese recipe and throw in some cooked chicken and broccoli, and you would have a good version of this recipe.

This is a simple to make dish, and the best part is that all ingredients are readily available in the refrigerator. Kids love macroni and cheese and with this recipe they will also get some veggies and protien, making it a healthier dinner time option.

This is a great recipe. Makes a lot of food so i often put half in a zip top bag and freeze for the next week. Also results are just as good (maybe not quite as rich) when i use milk as opposed to the heavy cream. Easy quick dinner!

Just made this for dinner and enjoyed it very much! I think this is a great comfort dish and can be made fairly healthily. I added bacon and onion to butter, used half and half instead of cream. My local market had some very nice Italian Fontina so I used that along with 28-32 month aged Parmegiano Reggiano. I also used imported Italian whole wheat pasta (chiociolla-it was organic even). The only problem is that we have so much leftover, we'll be enjoying this for a while.

After reading the other reviews, I played with this recipe to spice it up a bit. I did add the smoked, crumbled bacon as suggested. Rather than grill the chicken, I coated it with a Chinese Five Spice rub and sauteed it in sesame oil saving the pan for the cheese sauce. I also steamed the brocolli to hold in a bit more of the flavor. To the Fontina and Cheddar cheeses, I added in a 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Finally, I made the cheese sauce by first deglazing the pan used for the chicken. This really added a nice zing to the sauce.

I used a few tips from the reviews and thought this dish turned out to be quite tasty. I used 2 cups fat-free 1/2 and 1/2, 1 cup fat-free evaporated milk and 1 cup cream. I sauteed 1 cup chopped onion in the butter then stirred in the flour. I substituted a rotisserie chicken for the grilled breasts. I used smoked fontina and cheddar (more cheddar than fontina). For seasoning I used garlic salt and pepper. And finally, I added an egg and baked the whole thing for about 30 minutes. My family enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again!

This was great, easy comfort food, but was a bit bland. It definitely needs the bacon and the chives and could probably use some cayenne, white wine, and/or Worchestershire in the sauce.

Rating: 3
This was a hit for a group of moms (and their 10 month olds too). I used a rotisserie chicken instead of grilling the boneless breasts to save time and only used 2 cups of whipping cream and 2 cups of 2% -- increasing the flour to about 3-4 tbsp. to make it thick. I also had some fresh thyme so I chopped a bit of that (maybe a tbsp). Easy to make the night before and reheat in the oven - but most of all, easy to eat!

Wish there was a "maybe" response to "Would you make this dish again," because I would probably only make it again if I had the right confluence of ingredients and I have no idea what those are. We did have all the basics on hand and tried everything we could to kick this up a notch; sauteed onions & garlic, added bacon, used a cheese combination of brie exlorateur, aged gruyere and parmesan. Seemed like it had all the makings of greatness and yet something was missing. We didn't know what else to do except douse it with a shower of crushed red pepper, which seemed a shame considering all the fine cheeses we used. Maybe there's a more piquant combo of ingredients/spices out there, but unfortunately I'm not creative or determined enough to find them.

This looked so good in the magazine that I had to try it. I found it to be very good indeed just as printed. I'm not one to change ingrediants the first time around. For people who have a problem with counting calories, we don't eat like this every night of the week and do everything in moderation.

I agree with the cook from Boston. If your not going to make this recipe, don't write an opinion. I loved this recipe. I used 2 cups of cream and 2 cups of half and half. I also used provolone cheese instead of chedder along with some pasta water to thin. I agree with another cook who sauteed garlic in the butter before adding the cream. Totally great comfort food!

People, if you haven't even made the recipe, what makes you think we care that you won't ever be in the future? OK, its too fattening for you, great. No one cares that you think so. Its not for others. If you can't contribute constructively, do the rest of us a favor and keep it to yourself. You sound like people that would look at someone else's plate and ask "Do you know how much fat is in that?" I happen to think it sounds like a great movie night "dinner with the girls" when the diets go out the window for the night. Can't wait to try it.

This was great. I loved it my 2 1/2 year old loved it and my husband and father-in-law loved it. The mixed reviews worried me a bit but I could see that 4 cups of heavy cream would be too much for our taste so I subbed 2 cups whole milk and added a good hand full of fresh grated parmesan. Oh and I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder and dried parsley in addition to salt and pepper and grilled them in the foreman grill for 4 minutes (so easy). This was great and I wouldn't serve it for a fancy dinner party but with a 2 1/2 year old in the house we don't have many of those.

I thought this recipe was ok. I used a combo of 2%, whole, and cream because I happened to have a little of each on hand. It seemed fine without all that cream! I threw my broccoli in with the pasta during the last 3 minutes of cooking to make it faster. I will make it again but try adding something for a little more zip.

I made this recipe this morning. Like the other reviewer I had an issue with all the cream so I made it with 2 cups cream and 2 cups of fat free half and half. It was delicious, I grilled the chicken as directed it was delicious on its own. I had a hard time getting the roux to thicken with 2 Tablespoons butter and 2 Tablespoons flour, so when it didn't thicken like I thought it should, I sprinkled in some dried breadcrumbs. Then when it thickened I added the cheeses. The fontina was delicious in this making it smooth and creamy and the cheddar didn't discolor it. So good, will make it again

I notice most reviews say this dish is bland and would use different cheeses if/when next time. I wonder if Italian Fontina were used? It is ten times more flavorful than the plastic imitation that most stores in the US sell. I edit cook books for an avocation. The ONLY suggestion I would have is maybe add a touch of garlic.

Rating: 0
Haven't and won't be making this one. The description sounded pretty good/straightforward, but then 4 cups of whipping cream? For 6 people? that's just ridiculous. This would be something I would throw together in about 3 minutes, san, recipe, sans cream. I know this is not Cooking Light, but give me a break, who really eats that much cream?

actually, Rachel Ray did a recipe like this on 30 minute meals over a year ago...she sauteed chicken breast strips in EVOO, seasoned them with grill seasoning, made a roux, added 1% milk and shredded swiss and cheddar, cooked the broccoli florets with the pasta, and them mixed the whole thing together. I liked hers better.

I have to be honest, I haven't made this recipe, nor will I. Please everyone, take a look at those ingredients, and if you need to go further than that, tally up how much fat you will be consuming in one serving of this artery-clogger. My guess is, especially based on other reviews, that the finished product won't be worth it. Take a look at EatingWell.com, and type in "No-bake Mac-n-Cheese" into the search bar. Add a little more salt than they call for, definitely use an extra-sharp cheddar, and you will have a well-tested, tasty meal. Happy and healthy eating to all!

It was good, but I agree with some of the other cooks, would have been better had I added some bacon. I might also experiment next time with the cheeses called for as well.

Duh, OF COURSE you've got to add salt and pepper and season to taste!! I can't even imagine any sensible cook stating a recipe is "too bland" and not having the common sense to add salt and pepper. A recipe does not have to tell you to do this; it's common sense to season to liking!

Took the advice of prior reviews.... Cooked 1 lb. of bacon, drained fat and used that pan for the sauce mixture. Used half heavy cream and half 1% milk. Grated some parmagine reganio (sp?) cheese into the mix as well. Was liberal with the cracked pepper corns. It turned out awesome and the kids liked it as well!! A lot of different things going on in the kitchen at the same time. Definetly need to take care of some things ahead.

Rating: 2
I think the blandness can be overcome with some substitutions. Salted butter and less heavy cream (use some milk) will reduce the sweetness. The cheeses are fine but I agree that additional salt and pepper is a must. To avoid overcooking the brocolli, I added it to the pasta just about 30 seconds before I drained it.

Without having prepared this recipe I can tell you why it is so bland - the recipe does not call for salt & pepper. Mac & cheese must be heavily salted and peppered!

I made this for my family and we all agreed that it was fine but lacking that great "cheesy" flavor you expect from a mac 'n cheese dish. The chicken and the broccoli were great, but I think the next time I make it I'll substitute a mixture of parmesan and emmmenthal instead of the fontina.
