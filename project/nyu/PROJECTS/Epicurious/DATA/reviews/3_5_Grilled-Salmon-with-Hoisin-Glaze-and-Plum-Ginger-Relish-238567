You MUST make the relish at least 8 hours in advance to let the ginger and plum flavors to marry. Otherwise the ginger comes off as hot/spicy and overpowers the flavor of the plum. The hoisin needs to be warmed to soften it. I found it difficult to "brush" over the fish - I dolloped.

The relish really makes it. However, the relish needs time to meld; I'd suggest making it the day before. I made it an hour before the salmon was ready & it sort of missed. The next day it was fantastic with the leftover salmon. Sweet & spicy. You could use the relish on other grilled items like porkchops. I could not find Hoisin sauce at my local grocers so used a teriyaki type glaze instead. Worked fine with the relish.
