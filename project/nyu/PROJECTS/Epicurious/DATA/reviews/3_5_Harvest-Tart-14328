The instruction to discard the water after simmering the dried and fresh fruit should be disregarded. The liquid is a delicious drink! Particularly when it is still warm, with a splash of the liquor you are using in the next step of the recipe.

Great dessert, definitely for those who enjoy & appreciate the more complex dishes. I as well added 1/2 cup dried figs. I warmed the tart slightly when served, and preferred the whip cream as the ice cream is too heavy.

This is a tart for sophisticated palates. I served it to friends from Eastern Europe and they loved it. My husband thought it was too rich and intense. I think this is one of those recipes that is a matter of taste.

This is a family favorite for those winer months when fruit is limited to appples, oranges and bananas. Wonderful!

This is a superb, sophisticated dessert that will leave your guests wondering 'what is in this?' The filling reminds me of the strudels my grandmother used to make. I add about 1/2 cup chopped figs to add even more interest. Definitely a favorite for Thanksgiving or other winter dinner parties.

This was a beautiful tart and really delicious. Easy to make -- I cheated and used prepared crusts because I ran out of time, but it didn't matter -- my guest's were impressed as heck. Very tasty. Needs the fresh whipped cream.

This is a great tart for the fall if you like dried fruit and desserts that are not overly sweet. It was really flavorful and everyone enjoyed it.
