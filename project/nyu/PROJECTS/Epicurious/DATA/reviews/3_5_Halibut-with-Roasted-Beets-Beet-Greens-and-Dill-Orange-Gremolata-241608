I thought it could use more flavor. I ended up serving with orange wedges to squeeze over the top. The greens also didn't seem cooked by the time the fish was. If I made it again I'd saute the greens some in advance.

Just for beets: combined orange zest, juice of 1/2 orange, 1 shallot, dill, garlic, S&P and olive oil. layered almost done (steamed) golden beets in single layer on oiled baking sheet and topped with gremolata. roasted at 425 for approx 15 minutes. Beautiful and delicious! Will try red beets next time.

Very good dish. The wife loved it. A few small points: I squeezed some orange juice on the fish before cooking as per suggestions and it seemed to be a nice touch. Also, be careful cooking beets in the microwave. If you seal the plastic wrap over the bowl it explodes and sprays beet juice everywhere! Also, doing the math on the gremolata, if you use the measures in the recipe, you will have exactly 3 tbs. It seems to suggest you will have some extra for the finish, but you will not unless you make a point to save some.

I was in India last winter & when I saw the gigantic beets with greens still attached at the vegetable market, I remembered how much I loved this dish. I had to use a different fish, cilantro instead of dill, a different type orange that is native to Punjab, and sprinkled a little ground cumin to bump up the flavor a bit for my audience. Even when I mixed it up, this dish delivered! It is a refined & simple dish that is incredibly easy to make. And healthy, to boot!!!

I got my husband to eat beets!!! It was a very tasty dish, and I loved that there was no "trash" (beet greens). Everything was utilized and tasted great!

The greens turned out well, but the beets tasted more boiled than roasted. Perhaps the beets and the fish would have done better under the broiler. This was such a disappointment, however, that I won't try it again. Really did want to like it.

I have made this recipes numerous times and it is great. My husband does not like red beets so I buy the golden, candy or other colour and he loves it. What I did the last few times is add orange pieces with the beets just to use them up and it is great addition. Hanna

I used mahi-mahi as I had just bought some for the first time. We followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Simple, delicious and colourful. Our local health food store sells beets and beet greens separately so I doubled the greens. This will become a regular dish at our house.

Fantastic! I used golden beets which are more delicate in flavor. This recipe is so simple and yet the presentation is exceptional. I double the beets because the ones from my market are rather small, but also everyone loved the beets so much and the beet greens are really the standout. I wish I could triple the greens! The flavors in this dish come together perfectly! Make it, you will not be disappointed!

Dry, tasteless and disappointing

i used dried dill and wild steelhead instead, and the beets and beet greens were delicious. the fish was so-so. i squeezed some juice from the grated orange midway through the cooking (i read the reviews after i started) and i think it made a difference. but the fish needs garlic and salt. i'll make again but definitely need to punch up the fish. it also took 12 minutes to cook through, and the beets took 16 minutes in the microwave.

I had to use dry dill instead of fresh but otherwise followed the recipe as is, and OMG, it rocked. Not only is it elegant and tasty, it's healthful. Will definitely make this again.

This is such a fabulous dish, it way exceded my expectations. Per other reviewers, I squeezed fresh orange juice before baking and it was delish.

This recipe is so delicious. I decided to roast the beets in the oven [wrapped in foil]. Worked out great. Enjoyed the greens too. This is a definite keeper. Making it again tonight.

This was a great use of wonderful beets and fresh greens from the garden. I did add fresh OJ before baking. Baking time is longer but worth the wait.

I really thought this was delicious, and am grateful to previous reviewers. I added the garlic and squeezed half an orange over everything before I popped it in the oven. My dill had gone off so I used parsley instead and thought it tasted nice and fresh. My halibut was thicker, and the extra cooking time gave a nice delicate crunch to the greens.

I thought this was very good, but required the addition of orange juice (used bottled) to sweeten the dish appropriately. Without the OJ, the dish was too bitter and did not have a good balance of sweet/bitter/salty. After the OJ, the dish went to 4 stars. Nice to use the beet greens!

I followed this recipie exactly. My wife and I find that everything is too salty and the fish was too bland. It was also too bitter all around.

Wonderful recipe. Fish needs more time than shown. Also, should use about twice the number of beets and beet greens as in recipe. Finally, I used golden beets -- yummy.

This was a REALLY good dish. My husband was surprised that we used the beet green and he loved them. We'll definately make this again, and again and...

I really liked this dish a lot. Halibut doesn't seem to have a lot of flavor, so I liked having lots of sweet beets and the bitter greens. I found beautiful beets at the farmers market (they come in green, yellow, orange, red, purple) and that added some visual interest to the plate, but the red ones were just as good. The leftovers reheated well.

Really good. I made exactly as directed except boiled the beets instead of cooking them in the microwave. Overall delicious and a well balanced meal.

Delicious. I really enjoyed the idea of making a gremolata with orange peel and dill. I added an 1/8 of teaspoon of salt to give it a little extra omph.

I followed the recipe to the letter and, while I enjoyed the end result, I did feel a bit let down. I expected the tastes to pop better; it was a tad bland. I definitely will make it again and screw around with adding garlic, etc. Also, I kinda felt like there weren't enough beet greens. So next time, I'll buy twice the beets, use all the greens in this dish and save the other beets for something else.

This needs garlic! Suggest baking some lightly oiled garlic with the beets...250F until beets are poked easily. Add the finished garlic to the greens being pan cooked in olive oil.

A tasty healthy dish. The colors on the plate were beautiful. The contrast of the citrus on the halibut and the sweet of the beets with the slight bitter crunch of the greens was great. It was very easy to prepare and I found the recommended cooking time to be perfect. The only change I made is I roasted the beets in the oven in foil first rather than par-boiling them in the microwave. A delicious, nutrient rich meal that I will make again.

Yes, I will make again. I also roasted the beets in the oven, poured a small amount of orange jucie over the halibut. I would probably add a little extra flavor to the halibut--maybe just increase the orange peal. Anything else might take away from the Dill!?

I followed this recipe exactly, and while I loved the beets, and the entirety of the dish had a nice, wholesome flavor to it, I honestly found it to be a bit bland for my taste. Next time I would try the gremolata with garlic, as another chef suggested. Also, the fish took almost twice as long to cook as the recipe stated, so my greens were overdone. My oven works well, so I'm not sure what's going on there, but next time I'd go with even more thinly- sliced fish than the recipe recommends. I should note that my girlfriend had none of these complaints and loved the whole dish, slightly toasty greens and all, so go figure!

This recipe was lovely and light. We're not big fans of dill so we substituted fresh thyme and also added a clove of chopped garlic to the gremolata. We roasted the beets in the oven rather than parboiling them. The plate looked fabulous - lots of great color.

I made this recipe and everyone loved it, I substituted the beet greens (my beet greens were too wilted) with red swiss chard and it turned out beautiful. The gremolata made this an exceptional dish full of unexpected flavors.

Much better than I expected! I subbed Mahi Mahi (more sustainable and lower Mercury)
