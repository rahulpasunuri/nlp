This was basically disgusting. Even my dad didn't like it, and he eats everything... and I don't think I messed up the recipe, either. It was just weird, kind of like a sandwich covered in chocolate.

Very good. Don't let the ganache thicken too much. Place the assembled cake on a rack set over a cookie sheet and then pour the ganache over the cake, coating the top and sides. Let it set in the refrigerator for 15 minutes and then transfer to platter. VERY GOOD.

I would like to know the measurement amount of the bread crumbs. I had to make the batter twice. The firsttime I used small slices and tried to increase the amount. The batter fell. The second time was terrific. The guests loved it. I guarnised it with fresh raspberries.

Delicious and a little different. The "bread cake" provides both interesting taste and texture in contrast to the jam (not too sweet and a little crunchy). The whipped cream and fresh raspberries are necessary, not just a frill. Without them the ganache (although wonderfully chocolaty) overpowers the torte. I piped sweetened whipped cream over the whole top and made rows of raspberries (one for each of the 10 servings). Delightful presentation and taste.

This turned out wonderful, even though I was a little short on cream for the Ganache.

I tried using commercial raspberry pie filling to reduce the sweetness, and liked the recipe better. My local market sells bulk pie fillings. Suggestion for those who have never made ganache, "chop the chocolate into small pieces and add to warmed cream" might be better advice.
