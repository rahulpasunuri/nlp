I was concerned that this pie would be just a little too tart so I added an extra half tin of Eagle Brand and a fifth egg yolk. I also upped the sugar slightly in the crust. I served it tonight to friends, topped with extra sweet whipped cream and garnished with a few raspberries. While everyone thought it was delicious, the consensus was that it was still on the tart side. I realize that key limes are more tart than Persian limes but that distinction was lost on my guests. However the filling was creamy and had just the right texture. I used a microplane to remove the zest from two of the limes and am pretty sure I didn't add any bitter pith, still I think next time I make this I'll omit the zest, and possibly add a little bit of sugar to the filling.

Excellent! I will definitely make this again- my go to staple key lime pie.

Doubled the filling and it was just right for a deep dish pie plate. Nice and tart and the filling is just right for tartness. Love making it, but it is time comsuming! worth it for sure!

Used almond meal instead of almonds (what I had on hand) and loved the crust. Left out the zest of lime due to the fact that i didn't have any limes to zest and thought the filling was very good as well. Very easy and quick to make (not counting the setting up stage in the fridge) overall great dessert.

This recipe is excellent--really easy and a great combination of surprising and delicious! I substituted 1 tsp. almond extract for the almonds in the recipe, and it worked great. No need to add additional graham crackers, although I imagine an extra one or two wouldn't be a bad idea. :)

Made it as my husband's birthday pie. It was very good, and well received by all of our guests.

Excellent, but even better with crushed,toasted pecans instead of almonds

easy and fabulously tangy. I even added some extra zest to dial up the flavor. Will definitely make again!

This simple recipe wowed my foodie friends, who declared it the best key lime pie they've ever had...even more surprising given that my market was sold out of key limes, so I substituted 3 parts Persian lime juice + 1 part lemon juice. The almonds really make the graham cracker crust. Since other reviewers mentioned it messes with the filling's texture, I omitted the lime zest.

Very easy to make. Very quick! I'm not a fan of Graham cracker crust so I used chocolate wafer cookies. Perfect with summer food! The lime zest makes the pie look strange. I might omit the zest or put it in the food processor to make it smaller.

disclaimor: I made this pie as a tart with a pate sucree crust (not the almond graham cracker crust). And it was DElicious! I made a full recipe accidentally even though I was only using the filling to make a 10in tart. And I'm glad I did. I don't know if this makes a thin pie, but the filling was the perfect amount for a tart crust.

my sweetheart made this for me for my birthday and it was unbelieeeeevably delicious.

This really is the best key lime pie recipe. The double volume filling and almond spiked crust make it outstanding. The texture is by far better when using egg YOLKS, very creamy. I've made it twice (since my earlier mistake with whole eggs) and got rave reviews I used 3/4 graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 cup ground almonds for the crust. Worked perfectly. The pie was set after baking 15 minutes.

This was absolutely delicious - we've made it twice now and gotten raves both times. Very tasty; the crust really adds depth of flavor and a nice contrast to the sweet/tart filling.

I've seldom made a mistake with an ingredient - but I did this time. After carefully hand squeezing key limes for the perfect pie, I accidently used 4 whole eggs instead of just the yolks. I'm here to tell you that this pie was delicious despite my error. The texture of the filling was probably more firm than it would have been - but everyone loved it. I will try this recipe again soon - using egg YOLKS - to make the proper comparison.

Although I'm a lover of all things sour, this Key Lime Pie recipe put a pucker on my face. It wasn't so much the sourness of the filling as it was the unusual aftertaste that accompanied it. I followed the recipe to a T, so unless this is actually a recipe for Key Lime dishwashing liquid, I'm going to go ahead and give this a poor review. Fail.

The most perfect key lime pie...relatively quick and easy, a definite crowd pleaser!

I just made this pie, and everyone loved it. The almonds in the crust are great. They add great texture and flavor, and are definitely not too overwhelming. This recipe calls for a double-dose of filling. I used it all in the first pie I made. It seemed like too much filling...it almost spilled over the crust. I didn't use it all for the second pie, and I thought the second pie looked and tasted a little better. I will definitely use this recipe again, probably with a 10-in. crust instead of a 9-in. crust.

I made this for a party and it was a huge success. Disagree with eversince- the almonds in the crust are a must. The filling was great. I would make it again.

Why mess with perfection? Have made and loved, over and over, another key lime pie recipe on this site (the one from Gourmet, 2003), yet couldn't resist the urge to try out these changes. Doubling the filling is a great idea. Would do that part again. However, the zest adds a bitterness, even when the limes have been zested carefully with a microplane rasp. Also, the almonds added a weird, stale taste to the crust. Guest still seemed to like it, but I thought, "yuk - this is not the sweet, crispy graham cracker crust it's supposed to be!" In short, keep the doubled filling, lose the zest, and use the crust recipe from the Gourmet 2003 key lime.

This is the best recipe I've tried for keylime pie. Agree with jonnidee that the almonds in the crust are a must- the nutty flavor goes so well with the sweet and tart, and really balances it out nicely. This is a keeper.

This was SO easy to make, and very quick. I will definitely make it again soon. The almonds in the crust are a must. I was suprised at the difference in made in flavor. I served with lightly sweetend cream, as the sweet-tart pie doesn't need more sweet. The cream foils the tartness perfectly. I have a key lime tree, and have no trouble juicing the limes with an electric juicer. The trick is to make sure the limes are yellow. They are ripe and juicy!

can use store bought crust and key lime juisr. Reason this0 is successful is large amount of filling relative to crust.

I made this for a dinner party on Saturday and got rave reviews! My husband even liked it, and he doesn't normally like key lime pie. It was incredibly easy to make (I used store-bought key lime juice), and the almonds in the crust are delicious. I highly recommend you try it!

I made this pie for a dinner party tonight and it got rave reviews, including two guests telling me it was by far the best key lime pie they've ever had. Another said it was one of the best pie he's ever had, period. It was easy to put together, and I made it the night before. Definitely worth a try if you're a key lime pie fan.
