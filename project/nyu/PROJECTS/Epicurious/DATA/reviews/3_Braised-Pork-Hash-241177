So easy and delicious. I used a cheap bottle of white (whole thing) and a can of chicken broth. I bought the massive 7 lb boneless pork tenderloin from costco,and it made the recipe so much easier because there was no fat. Served the pork with egg and cheese strata, salsa, and asparagus. Leftovers lasted all week and make burritos and sandwiches with it. Will definitely make again!!!

This was so easy and so flavorful. I wound up adding chicken stock to make enough sauce. Used boneless pork because that was all I could find, and it worked out well as there was absolutely no fat on it.

Easy, make ahead recipe. Needed to add more liquid. Reheated well and the aroma was heavenly.

This dish was really quite delicious. I added several sprigs of fresh thyme to the pork in the braising step, and used an inexpensive bottle of white wine. I more-or-less shredded the pork with my fingers while it was still warm, removing the fat, and had great success.

suggest checking meat at 2.5, 3, and 3.5 hrs in the braising step, and adding water or broth as needed to prevent burning. i used a full bottle of wine but it all evaporated causing the onions to burn. pork is delicious, making the hash tonight.
