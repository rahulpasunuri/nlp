Made this as a "palate cleanser" for dessert tonight for company... lime (my favourite flavour!)... and got rave reviews... easy to make... served the ices in wine glasses... with sprigs of mint... and lime ribbons... perfect end to a multi-course dinner! This is a definite keeper!

I work for a small craft distillery and can't help thinking that these ices are the perfect medium for combining seasonal, local fruits and herbs with infused spirits or liqueurs...lovely and refreshing flavors and stunning presentation....I can't wait to create!
