This is a great dressing - just make sure to get unsweetened miso. White miso can often have sugar already added. If so, reduce the amount of honey to taste. If using regular miso without sugar, the honey balances the saltiness.

The dressing is way too sweet. I was aware that with a sweet golden miso the amount of honey was extreme and cut down on this alreday. The balance is off - needs less sweetness, more saltyness and acidity... the recipe really doesn't work. The vegetable mix is quite colorful and nice to look at, but the dressing needs to much fiddling to make it palatable.

This salad dressing was just ghastly. It was so sweet it made my teeth hurt. I will definitely not make this again.

Excellent! Used peanut oil for vegetable oil. Served it with shredded cabbage, carrots, red bell peppers and green onions. Everyone raved about it.

The dressing was waaay too sweet for my taste. When I read it I thought a 1/4 cup of honey seemed like a lot (but I didn't trust my instincts). I had to add more lemon juice, some mirin and chili garlic paste to remove the cloying sweetness.

Excellent! I used a little less honey and used peanut oil. Very yummy on a salad of shredded cabbage, shredded carrots, red bell peppers, and green onions.

01/18/07 A Cook from avid cook Too many complaints to make this again. It is very labor intensive and the jicama and cucumbers release too much water and make the salad soggy. I found the dressing too sweet and too bland." Geez.

great dressing to go with salmon or and other Asian style food. I was in a hurry so I served the dressing on a a salad of field greens with strips of red pepper and carrots. I also added the cilantro. Will definately make it again and will pass the recipe on.

i don't bother to make the salad -- too much precise cutting! but the dressing is totally worth making, very simple, and a HUGE crowd pleaser. works really well on salmon or artic char on a bed of mesclun.

I didn't have golden miso so used red miso. The flavor was mello. You had to "listen" for the flavor. Did not "WOW" my friends or myself. Probably will not make it again. It needs a little pep.

A great dressing. You could virtually use any vegetable in season. It helps to have a mandoline. Watch those fingers!

Unique and delicious! I added res bell peppers for color. The sauce is delicious and puts a fresh spin on coleslaw. You will not be disappointed!

Superb dressing would be great on really any combination of seasonal, raw vegetables. I added summer squash this time, next time I will add red cabbage for color and texture. As other reviewers said, it is really a versatile sauce and would be particularly good as a dipping/marinade for baked tofu.

I make this dressing and serve it with green leaf lettuce, tofu, and assorted bell peppers. Friends have told me to bottle and sell this dressing -- it is hands down a great dressing and can even be used as a marinade for fish, steak, or chicken.

Really good! The dressing is thick and creamy and has a wonderful flavour. I found there was a lot of extra dressing left over but can be easy used on more chopped vegetables. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe several times with some changes because it's too sweet as is. I only use 2 T honey and I add one more tablespoon of lemon juice. It has a great flavour and goes well with spinach salad.

Except for cutting up the vegies, a simple and tasty slaw recipe that complimented the Grilled Salmon with Ponzu Sauce perfectly. I served the slaw along side the salmon rather than on top.

To make cutting easier, my husband used the mandoline for the red bell pepper and a salad shooter for the carrots and jicama. He cut up the cucumber by hand. The dressing was simple in the blender and very much to our tastes. It's much better than the bottled miso dressings we've tried. This was excellent on the salmon and will be great on its own, too.

The dressing is spectacular. Okay, I didn't make the whole recipe. I made the dressing and put it on mildly bitter greens. The taste is unusual, surprising, and very good with escarole.

My knife skills are probably what made this less than 3 forks in my mind. I'm not great at making those little matchstick-size strips with veggies. The dressing was tasty, tho. I couldn't find golden miso, so I substituted a miso dressing that I found at Trader Joes. I thought it had great flavor. I think, tho, I would probably make less dressing next time since the veggies seemed to be swimming in it. But as I said, my knife skills likely contributed to that, too. I served this along with Roasted Chicken Legs with Plum Salsa.
