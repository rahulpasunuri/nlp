Great recipe, thank you. But I added a small amont of green chiles and ground cumin to give some heat.

Very tasty, but not as interesting as I would have hoped, and a bit too sweet for my tastes (I would halve the sugar). However, a nice accompaniment to sharp cheese or meat.

100% perfect chutney. Super easy to make. Followed the recipe and made it the night before to serve with cheese and crackers at a dinner party. Everyone loved it.

This was excellent and was completely devoured by our guests this Christmas. At first I thought the recipe was too simple but made it as is (except added half a chopped jalapeno - no seeds) and it was stunning.

Easy, simple, and delicious!!! I added a diced, fresh jalapeno (no seeds) for a little kick while it was cooling...nice color contrast and the tangy chutney with the jalapeno flavor was a huge hit with my guests.

This chutney has become a staple at our Thanksgiving table. My family loves it!

Generally followed the directions (only out of cider so used red wine vinegar) and it was excellent. When I make it again will cut the sugar down a tad as would like it a bit less sweet. Especially nice was that could make it a few days in advance to save the last minute rush and let the flavors ripen before serving. Went great with ham, as well as turkey, and got rave reviews from friends.

Fantastic! Great with turkey. I ended up simmering much longer than 10-12 minutes, more like ~ 30 min. until all the cranberries popped and were cooked. Made for 2007-8 NYE party dinner. It was a hit. Several people asked for the recipe.

amazing--next time I'm throwing in some chilis to give it some heat, though it was incredible on its own

Yum, Yum, Yum! A tangy, delicious creation. I threw in 2 peeled, chopped pears for added texture and interest. A definite keeper and permanent addition to my holiday menus!

Since I excpect chutney to be as much savory as sweet I wasn't disappointed. I used brown sugar, and added a 1" stick of cinnamon and a few whole cloves while simmering. I liked it, but someone expecting a typical cranberry sauce might not. I think it would be good with poultry, ham, pork or even sharp cheddar! Even with a curry?

I have only ever made sweet cranberry sauces for the holidays, but this preparation is absolutely delicious. A definite keeper!

Forgot to mention this in my last review below. I thought 5 large shallots seemed excessive, so I used 4 medium. Perfect balance of sweet and savory.

I needed a thick, spreadable chutney for a turkey and brie sandwich. Unfortunately, it's hard to find fresh (or even frozen) cranberries in my area during the summertime, so I had to make a few substitutions to this otherwise fantastic recipe. I used 10 oz. of dried cranberries instead of fresh/frozen. I also cut the sugar down to a 1/2 cup (since my dried cranberries already had some sugar in them), and added 1/4 cup of water to simmer in the pan along with the rest of the ingredients. Because the cranberries were dried and didn't release any juices, I had to put everything (after cooking) into my food processor. The result - slightly chunky, but nicely blended tart/sweet cranberry chutney with a perfect (mayo-like) texture for spreading on sandwiches.

I love the sweet, tart and savory combination of flavors. Really wakes up a boring leftover turkey sandwich. Beats canned cranberry sauce hands down.

This was the worst thing I have ever made. Unless I did something dreadfully wrong, this was horrible. The taste of the vinegar and the shallots were entirely overwhelming. We ended up tossing the whole thing and making the Candied Orange and Cranberry Chutney instead which was a hit.

I'm disappointed. When I think of cranberry dishes I think sweet and tart. Maybe that's my problem because I thought the shallot and garlic flavors stood out WAY too much. I would make it again (and I salvaged it this time) by adding 1/2 cup orange juice and more sugar to it. But next time i think I'll cut out half the onion and half the garlic. As is it is just too strange.

So easy, delicious and good looking. I will never EVER buy cranberry sauce again.

Encouraged by rave reviews, I tried this. And you guys are absolutely right! This stuff is fabulous. But watch it closely as I have had problems with scorching. Also cans very well for Holiday gift giving or sales. Try it with turkey and brie on a croissant. Wow.

Glory be, I have been looking for this recipe for two years! It is absolutely the best cranberry sauce I've had in my life - and after making it twice, I lost the recipe. Just in time for thanksgiving.

Brought this to a friend's house for Thanksgiving, and EVERYONE loved it.

The original recipe is fine, but I made a few adjustments that made it truly spectacular -- I added roasted walnuts, used sherry vinegar instead of cider and increased the amount of sugar. Heavenly on Carr's cracked pepper crackers. My whole office is munching right now!

Very good, and keeps for a while. I found the flavors blend together the longer it keeps -- definitely something to make a couple of days in advance. I cooked it a little longer than the recipe says so more of the cranberries popped for a smoother texture. Yum!

This chutney is fabulous! The slightly sweet/savory combo is much better than the usual cranberry sauce. Turns a boring turkey sandwich into a culinary delight. Also wonderful with brie en croute.

made this chutney for two thanksgivings in a row. Would suggest cutting back on the vinegar to allow the cranberry flavor to predominate. for any cooks of pakistani/indina food: this goes GREAT with many curry-type foods, specially daal (lentil soup).

This is a superb use of cranberries. And I thank the Cook from Toronto (12/19/01) for the suggestions which I incorporated, plus a pinch of cloves. I substituted a fresh hot red pepper for the dried pepper flakes. I'll make this again any time I have cranberries.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I found it a bit too tart, so added sugar to taste just until the bitter tint was gone. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL on turkey sandwiches!

Rating: 0
my cranberry chutney recipe includes cumin, coriander, ginger & garlic (like 4-6 cloves!), as well as 2-3 apples, a red pepper and a red onion (easy to remember as all these are red ingredients). I lost the original recipe years ago but have never gone wrong blending all the above with a bag of cranberries, orange juice instead of water, and sugar. It all goes in the microwave until the berries pop. delish. i'm sure only those who would appreciate the flavours will try it!

Fantastic! I made this along with the Triple Cranberry Sauce(Delicious Flavor!)for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit! I have never thought i would enjoy the taste of sweet and savory together! The combo of shallots,ginger,garlic,and the tartness of the cranberries was unbeleievable! Awesome on a turkey sandwhich the next day! Two thumbs up!

This was OK if you are going for the "hey it's thanksgiving so I need to have cranberries on the table" effect. However, there are much better chutneys out there with much more complex flavors. (THIS ONE JUST SCREAMED TART) I would recommend the peach chutney also found on this site.

This Cranberry Chutney was a big hit last Thanksgiving. However, this year I will use less fresh ginger.

Rating: 3
This chutney is good, though it had just a tad more vinegar than we like. I'll decrease it by just a tablespoon, and I'll increase the ginger the next time I make it. I'm going to try the Cranberry-Ginger Chutney next to compare.

The best! I always add about 1 1/2 cups of diced mixed dried fruit and 1 cup water. In a pinch you can make this with whole berry cranberry sauce, but eliminate the sugar.

This was so much nicer than the "ever so sweet" cranberry sauce. Wonderful next day with hot turkey sandwiches and French loaf. This could be served as an appitizer of brie cheese and baguette with the cranberry chutney over on top. Yum!!

I can't believe how easy it was to make this and it was so delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it -- great on turkey and even on just French bread. It sure beats that solid jelly cranberry you get out of the can.

Great! Not too sweet, has a nice tang to it. Will be on the Thanksgiving table again next year - if not sooner.

I loved the cranberry chutney. It was not as sweet as traditional cranberry sauce, and had a lovely complex flavor. It was a real hit with my guests. This will definitely replace my standard cranberry recipe.
