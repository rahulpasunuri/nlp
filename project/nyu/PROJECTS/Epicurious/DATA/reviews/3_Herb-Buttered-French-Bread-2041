second time making this french bread, both times missed the part to broil the bread first THEN butter the bread!!! Still very very good though, will make it the third time the right way to see if it makes a difference or not. PS I also added no salt either times.

I used unsalted butter and did not add any salt. The capers and basil suffice for salty flavor. My guests loved this on ciabatta dipped into a nice autumn minestrone soup.

Tasty and easy, but much too salty. I used salted butter. If I make again, I'll leave out the extra salt.
