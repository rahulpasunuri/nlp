LOVE these pizzas. We make them fairly often. Simple, clean flavors. My only advice, if using fresh mozzarella, is to dice it, sprinkle with salt, and drain in a sieve to release some of the moisture lest the pizzas become watery as the cheese melts.

Loved this recipe. Made it for Sunday dinner with salad and basic vinagrette for my husband and myself. Will make again and again.
