AMAZING! I added some shrimp and lemon spice seasoning to the seafood....it melted in our mouths! I will make this over and over!

Bland and the texture of the squid was something that I hope I soon forget.

The dressing in this salad was as dull as I feared it would be and rendered this dish boring. The other flavors were interesting, but were overwhelmed by the spinach and dressing. My husband thought the whole thing tasted like a plate of salted spinach.

I lost count of the number of times my husband said this was one of the best meals he'd had in a long time. The combination of flavours was outstanding. I cooked the peppers and the squid on the bar-b-q, would definitely make this again.

This was simply first rate. Easy to prepare. Really tasty. not too heavy. I found some fresh squid at my fishmongers' Just be sure to score the squid like it says or it will shrivel up.

this was perfect (although I cut out vital parts such as squid and spinach) and accompanied a thai red shrimp curry - really a great combo!

This was terrific! Not heavy or rich, yet very satisfying as a main course. I used 1 lb. of shrimp and 1 lb. of squid, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. I found the spices to compliment the dish very well and not at all overpowering. Perhaps the extra shrimp and squid "spread" the spices out a little more. This is perfect for a summer supper on the patio...just add crusty french bread and wine...

The strength of the spices (chili and cumin) totally overpowered the delicate flavours of the squid and mango. Next time I will make it with no spices, or a very light sprinkling.

I don't like bell peppers so I swapped them out for pablano peppers. They also have a little heat to them and this worked well with the recipe. I also added about a quarter of a cup of pomegranate seeeds to the final mixing of the salad. One last item that I changed was the doubling of the cayenne pepper. This was a salad that we will enjoy again and again. Highly recommend with the squid.

Used yellow pepper instead of red that I grilled on grill also until just tender. Found it easier to cut tube of squid open and grill it laying flat; after it was cooked, I sliced it up and added to salad; nice and healthy !

I made this dish for a church supper last night using shrimp. Since I didn't have cumin I used curry powder. It recieded rave reviews.

Very simple to make. I made it with shrimp instead of squid and loved it. It can easily serve as a main course or a light salad. Definitely a summer receipe with the mangos. Highly recommended.
