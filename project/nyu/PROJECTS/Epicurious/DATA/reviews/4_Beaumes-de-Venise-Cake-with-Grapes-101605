best.cake.ever. I have been making it since it first appeared in Bon Appetit years ago. My middle son who is turns 8 in January requests it for his birthday cake EVERY year. He DEVOURS it! I repeat: best.cake.ever.

I made this a few weeks ago and one is in the oven as I write this. I served it to a group not particularly dessert people--it was a hit. Lighter than you might think, wonderful texture and taste. This is a keeper. I served it with whipped cream. Would be a good addition to a brunch menu as well.

I made this for a dinner party of eight. It was wonderful--light and moist--a rare combination. I did use a Riesling and used two cups of grapes. My spring-form pan was only nine inches and worked beautifully. This is a very easy cake to put together and the results are excellent. I served it with whipped cream.

This is a wondeful recipe! It's the perfect ending to a meal on those occasions when you want something delicious but not overly sweet.

Did not like the flavor or texture, unfortunately.

Super delicious and easy to make, as comments below. Next time, I will use smaller grapes, as I felt mine were too large. Also agree to add half the grapes after 15-17 minutes, as the top of the cake is quite set at 20 minutes. My guests and I agreed that the grapes at the bottom were much more "boozy" than the late addition grapes. We also drank the rest of the muscat with the cake - yum!

Very easy and quick to prepare, this cake is both rustic and sophisticated. I made it for an engagement party, and many thought it was unusual and delicious.

I made this cake for a Provencal dinner party (preceded by the fish soup with bread and rouille from this site, which was also amazing). I followed the recipe exactly except that I only had an 8 1/2" springform pan and not a 10" one, as suggested. As a result, the cake was taller than I expected. The cooking time was the same (using convection). This cake was absolutely delicious, moist, flavourful and moreish. We all had two pieces and one guest had three pieces. Highly, highly recommended. We finished up the bottle of Muscat Beaumes de Venise (chilled) with the cake. A perfect combination.

Sophisticated, sumptious...who could ask for anything more. Even more wonderful with a glass of Beaumes De Venise. Everyone wanted the recipe. Have made several times, each time with a different amount of "grape holes." Think it is more interesting looking with more grape holes. You can use a muscat succesfully, but not a muscato. Muscato is Italian and sparkling vs Muscat which is French and not sparkling.

This is a very different, unusual, and delicious cake. Unfortunately, the edges, though still soft, were burned. Does anyone know why that happened? The rest of the cake was moist, flavorful, and beautiful. I used Muscato wine, which was perfect. Next time I'll be adding more grapes. They soak up some of the wine and are delicious. As for adding 1/2 c grapes after 20 minutes: the cake was a little too set at that point. I would try 15 minutes next time.

This is an amazing, easy to make cake. I am not a baker but had no problem with this recipe. Beaumes- de-Venise has a wonderful flavor and smells divine but is $$$. I made it to celebrate an engagement and it was worth the splurge.

as an epicurious newbie i was scared to try my first 'sophisticated' cake but it was so simple and sooooo good! i also used riesling and took the advice of the cook from gainesville and placed some of the grapes on the cake at the 20 minute mark. will DEF make this again!!!

The flavor of this cake is really good. I did use the Beaumes-De-Venise and I love how it smelled while the cake was baking. My one problem was that the cake came out no more than an inch high. I think my oven was running a little hot. Next time I think I will cook it at a lower temp.

I made this cake with a nice mid-harvest Riesling. I'm slightly embarrassed to say it, but three friends and I devoured it in one sitting. This was a fantastic and easy dessert - even for a cook who spends most of his time over the grill or the saute pan. Nutrition Facts: Based on 10 servings.

Everone whose grapes are sinking: I made this cake with a revised recipe that says to reserve 1/2 cup of the grapes and add them at the 20-minute mark. It worked like a charm, so try that. This cake is fabulous with the called-for beaumes de venise; I make it for people who are special enough to shell out the extra cash for.

Make it every year for our Beaujolais party. No leftovers.

For those having problems with the grapes sinking you can try tossing them in flour prior to mixing them in. Sometimes that helps.

I make this cake whenever I get an excuse! I last made it for a tea party I hosted for the gals in my family. Everyone LOVED it. I used white grape juice instead of wine and it was still very good. I tried sprinkling on a few more grapes and some coarse sugar about 15 minutes before it was done, it helped make a prettier presentation.

I made this for a huge holiday dinner, and everyone loved it. I thought it was a teensy bit rich, maybe a little too much wine (I did use Beaumes de Venise wine). But it looked gorgeous and everyone was very impressed with taste and presentation; I had to convince them that I'd made it myself!

Very nice, very french. I'm making it again tomorrow using champagne grapes. Yummy!!

I, too, jumped on the riesling train, and have no regrets. I also used only 6 tblsp of butter instead of 8, by mistake (I was making two things at once, and looked at the wrong printout), with no apparent damage. My grapes sank also, though. But it's all good--this was delicious! Devoured by guests. The batter (and the finished cake) has a lovely wine-y fermented aroma to it. Highly recommended.

I made this for a southern-themed spring dinner and figured, why use expensive beaumes de venise or even reisling when muscadine is so readily available? I bought a cheap-o, cloyingly sweet, undrinkable (in my opinion) bottle of local Scuppernong. It was perfect for the cake! I 1.5ed the recipe because I have a larger springform pan, and it worked just fine. The result was a dense, super moist, perfectly sweetened cake. The only problem was that my grapes sank...I'll probably try it in the future with cherries or blueberries.

This really was a wonderful coffeecake-style cake. I went with the "poor college" suggestion of using reisling instead of a dessert wine. It turned out lovely and was quite the hit.

This is a great cake, easy to make and has very rich taste. I have made it several times, however it has always "fallen". If not for the picture, I would think it should be flat! Anybody has a suggestion, why my cake isn't as high as it should be?

this was so so light, and so moist. because i'm a poor college student, i substituted 1 cup reisling and used a 9 inch springform instead. it was still absolutely delicious. i will no doubt make this again.

I've made this twice and it is wonderful. Will definitely be adding to my permanent repertoire. Could not find Beaumes de Venise, but used Essencia. Also used an orange-infused olive oil, which together with the Essencia, gave it a really wonderful orange essence. Very simple to make, elegant, and delicious.

Yummy! I made this as the end to a dinner party that included lavender-thyme poissoins (from this site and also good). Those French know their food!

My grapes were completely consumed by the batter so i added extra sugar for decoration. My biggest problem was using the olive oil as grease on the pan and parchment paper - it burned the edges on bottom of cake while I was watching it through the oven window - in seconds!

This cake has such a unique flavor. I have made it twice, and the second time, I had to use a California Muscat Canelli, which did not have the same flavor or intensity as the Beaumes-de-Venise or even Essencia. But, I had no choice, so I took the entire bottle, reduced it down to 1 cup, and it turned out to be so good that I might use this method again, and it makes the cake a little less expensive to make.

This is an awesome cake. Word for the wise, (and the non-drinkers like me) Muscatel *d'Asti* is a sparkling wine! Still, the cake was luscious, and though the big, plump grapes I used did taste a little funny, I'd just use tiny grapes next time--'cause I'm defintitely making this one again!

Delicious and very easy!

Loved it for its texture, flavour, and ease of preperation. Didn't even need to break out a handmixer for this recipe; balloon-whisk sufficed. Took the advice of an earlier reviewing to increase the grapes; used 2 cups. Will definitely make again.

We really enjoyed this cake.I will make it again, next time for company. I served it warm with whipped cream and some roasted almonds. Fit for a Queen. Thanks .

A superb, unusual dessert for those willing to try something new. Used Beaumes-de-Venise the first time, and an Italian moscato the second, with no noticeable difference in the result. An especially good way to use grapes that aren't sweet enough to eat plain. Everyone wanted the recipe.

Rating: 3
It is great to be able to bring a special dessert to a party knowing before you've tasted it that it will be lovely--thanks to all the reviewers on this one who have helped inspire confidence in a novice cook! I would suggest gently running a knife around the cake before releasing the pan sides.

This cakes rates a #3 on my overall best cake list, after Tiramisu and German Chocolate Cake. The grapes may seem weird, but they are an interesting, unusual addition. The liqueur renders this cake moist and sweet, though not cloyingly so. You must use Beaumes-de-Venise!

Rating: 4
To Frisco: Grapes don't dry into raisins that quickly. They stay juicy and grape-like in this cake. Still, I think you could use this basic cake recipe and add any fruit/wine combination you like. (Apples/hard cider? currents/cassis?)But then again, why mess with success? It is really good as is!

This cake is amazing, what little I tasted of it. Normally genteel folk SCARFED it down as if there were no tomorrow. I have to make it again just to get a real taste of it. Everyone raved about it. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

This recipe was fabulous. I made many of them as holiday gift for friends last year and everyone loved it. It was universally like both those who said they love sweets and those that ordinarily don't like overly sweet desserts. It works well as both an after-dinner dessert or as a sweet accompaniment to brunch or a cup of tea. Easy to make with any muscat wine and type of sweet grape.

A really great way to impress without a lot of work. If you can find small grapes use them.

Great recipe! I made this with the wine, but agree that it could be made with another muscat. Very tasty cake, will definitely make again.

A memorable, unusual and truly festive cake. I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out beautifully. Don't be skeptical about the olive oil--it confers a wonderful velvety texture. Try to serve the cake soon after baking as possible. Though still delicious a couple of hours later, the trial slice I had fresh from the cooling rack was definitely the best.

I LOVE this cake. It has a very sophisticated flavor. I'm always looking for a dessert that doesn't hit you over the head with chocolate, so this recipe caught my eye immediately. Don't bother looking for Beaumes-De-Venise--it's too fine a wine to use in a cake. Any decent Muscat will do. I'll be making this one often!

I have twice prepared this cake, with great success! Many people have asked me for the recipe. It makes for a nice presentation. I served it with home made vanilla ice cream. It has the characteristics of "comfort food".

This cake was surprisingly easy to make, and absolutely delicious. I decided to try it because of all the wonderful reviews, in spite of the fact that I wasn't sure what to think about grapes and wine in a cake. Not only is it simple, beautiful to serve, and impressive, it is also a lovely compliment to any meal, especially heavier ones. A small slice of this light-tasting cake and a cup of coffee are great together. My fiancee, who is not a cake fan (and when he does eat it, it had better be chocolate) raved and made me promise to make this more often!!!

It's excellent. I've tried it with both white and red grapes. They're right , red is better, but both are fine. It really adds to it to serve it very fresh with vanilla whipped cream.

I agree with the cook from Santa Fe! This will become my favorite "plain" cake. Instead of the Beaumes-de-Venise wine I used a less expensive muscat--Muscat de Beaulieu Ca dessert wine and it was still delightful. I also followed the suggestion to increase the grapes but it seemed too moist on the bottom, as if the cake wasn't done. Perhaps my grapes were not dry enough. I'm making it again tomorrow and I think I'll use about 2 cups of grapes this time.

This will become a favorite in my recipe box. This wonderfully moist cake can be made days ahead if you keep it tightly sealed and cool. The flavor is delicate and multilayered. I doubled the grapes the second time I made it. Served with a chilled glass of Beaumes-de-Venise wine and a few red grapes on the side, it is unforgettable. One of the best things about this cake is being able to make a day or two ahead. I froze the 2 leftover pieces and they were just fine for my husband and I a couple of weeks later.
