This was great and so easy to make! Really tasty. I used store-bought Savoiardi (crispy ladyfingers) for the cookie, and used a shallow glass pie pan because I don't have a tart pan. The crust stayed together nicely and came right out of the pan. Will definitely make again.

The only good thing I can say about this recipe is that it is simple and was not time consuming. So, as I scraped the entire thing into the garbage I was not terribly annoyed. I am a personal chef and quickly had to make another lemon dessert for a client. Even my husband, who insists I am too critical of my own cooking made a horrible face when he tasted this. The crust was mushy and the overly tart filling left a bad aftertaste. I should have known when I read the ingredients, you can't always tell from reading the comments I guess.

I made this for Mother's Day and was disappointed that there were no leftovers for me! The vanilla wafers provided just enough sweetness to balance the tartness of lemons. The cookie crumbs were a nice departure from a standard graham crust. I would like to try individual mini tarts next time.

Easy, do-ahead and yummy! What more can you ask of a dessert? I served it with sliced strawberries. Next time I am going to try it with the marbled raspberry cream from this web-site.

This is the recipe that I have always used to make key lime pie and lemon pie. Didn't think it was anything special, but just always teeth-achingly wonderful. I use graham crackers for crust and add meringue. Isn't that key lime pie?

This was delicious--creamy and pleasantly tart. It was also easy as pie to make. (ha ha) To address the problem Irene Sax noted in getting the crust to disengage from the bottom of the pan, I sprayed just the pan bottom with a very little bit of PAM, and that worked out fine. I did not use a rotary beater--I had no trouble whisking the egg/condensed milk mixture.
