Hands down the best french toast EVER! I made this for my hubby and we both loved it. I used cinnamon bread and added some nutmeg. I also put cinnamon and nutmeg in the the egg/cream mixture. I served it with sausege and milk. Thanks for posting, I love it!

I love cinnamon, so this was a hit with me. I liked that there wasn't really any added sugar to the mix (not that maple syrup is healthy, of course). I wanted crunchy french toast so I also coated my french toast with crushed Honey Bunches of Oats before putting in the pan. I found that the cereal tended to burn a bit, so I transferred them to the oven to finish.

This is a terrfic recipe. Used about half skim and half cream, but probably can go with an even higher skim ratio. Used whole wheat sourdough and added fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries to the syrup and it was incredible. Not just my opinion, but my wife who normally doesn't go for fruit mixed with anything sweet couldn't stop talking about it. My son gave it the "best french toast ever" title :)This will be repeated often.

Tried this recipe on a whim for Sunday morning breakfast and the entire family sat up straight. Now we make it whenever we have out of town guests. It fascinates me that our Chic, DINK Manhattan friends love this as much as our Southern Suburbs With Brood friends. Even the Crunchy Granola So. Cal. friends rave (so long as we use free range eggs, lol) as well as everyone in between. My significant other likes the syrup so much he typically makes a double batch so there's always some in the fridge.

While I really liked this recipe after the first time I made it I stumbled across something that I thought made it better. I had leftovers from the batch I made so I froze them. The next time I wanted french toast I put the slices on a baking sheet and put them in the over at 350 for about 15 minutes. It was fabulous. The french toast got all puffed up but stayed just a bit crunchy on the outside. So that is the way I make it now. I soak the bread, grill the slices and then bake them. It's putzy but is easy for a do ahead dish.

Delicious! Easy! My 12-year old daughter just made it.

Very disappointed in this recipe. The french toast itself is fine - though nothing to write home about. But the sauce is horrid - it is just sticky goo that gets locked in your teeth. I won't bother wasting time making this again...

Whoever invented this recipe should be honored! This was the best French toast I ever had. The taste was incredible, and I will make it for all special breakfasts. The only recommendation I would make would be to cook the bread on each side for 5 minutes, as the slices were too soggy after 3 minutes.

This recipe was really good. I changed a couple of things to make it a bit more healthy. First of all I only used 1 Tbsp of butter and fat free half & half. I used whole wheat bread and honey instead of maple syrup (not a big maple fan). I cut the honey and half & half to 1/2 cup and only used 1 tbsp of the cooked mixture in the egg mixture. I also used only two eggs since the size of my bread was smaller. And...since I used my George Forman Grill, I didn't have to cook it in butter. It was delicious!! My 3 year old ate two slices without hestiation!!

This was a great french toast recipe. I substituted skim milk for cream and it turned out well. I would recommend letting the bread soak in the cinnamon and milk mixture to make it more flavorful.

We had left over challah & I was looking for a new French Toast recipe. This is it! Just as easy as the traditional recipe, but soooo much better. I microwaved syrup, but I'd boil next time to get a thicker consistency. No issue using 2% milk instead of cream. The bread will soak up all the egg mixture, so make sure you get all servings in the pan at once. Cook on lower heat for 4-5 mintues to get crunchier results. BTW - my boys refused to eat so we imposed the "one bite rule". After that, they ate extra servings.

I thought this was great. However, I had to lower the heat to medium as the first piece was burnt after 3 minutes on medium high. Loved the syrup. Used 5 pieces of bread (good thing since I burnt the first one). :-) And oh yea, they are pretty filling. Boyfriend could only eat one and a half.

Better than most french toast recipes... but I'd like to find something better. Overall, a good recipe!

This is the perfect breakfast dish for kids. I made a fancy fathers day breakfast, but I also wanted to make something my little brothers would enjoy. They loved it!!! Note: you NEED the real maple syrup. The syrup completed the toast and earned the recipe four forks. Definately will make this again.

Used Semifreddi's Cinnamon Twist Bread (available in SF Bay Area). Made 6 slices and had enough egg mixture for 8. Way too much syrup for the 6slices, had almost 3/4 C leftover, so would half syrup amounts next time. Used regular syrup since I had no maple. And microwaved, which worked just fine. Also substituted whole milk for cream. This is definitely a keeper.

Best french toast I've made! Used wheat frech bread, substituted milk and vanilla (we didn't have cream) and turned out really yummy. There were just 2 of us and we didn't want too much syrup, so instead of boiling it, I microwaved some in a small bowl with the butter and cinamon. Turned out really well. I'd make this for guests.

This recipe is awsome. I used fat free milk and vanilla Coffee Mate (ran out of both whole milk and cream) and it stilled turned out great. My kids said is was better than daddy's (big).

Maybe my being pregnant has an influence, but this was awesome! I was craving breakfast for dinner and this hit the spot. I used homemade cinnamon raisin bread (another craving) and cut it 1" thick. Be sure to keep your syrup warm and don't boil too long or it will end up crunchy. I also cooked the slices a little longer over medium heat, as I like my french toast cooked all the way through. Will make again!

The french toast is amazing, but the syrup is out of this world. I make the syrup any time I'm making breakfast, whether it's this french toast recipe, pancakes, or waffles, and everyone always raves.

Absolutely delightful!! My guests loved it. A definite hit with the children as well. I will be making it again, no question. Ran out of egg bread and used whole wheat, was better with the egg bread. Fabulous!

I have always been able to stretch six out of this recipe and I think it works well with Texas Toast or French Vanilla Bread. I also add some of the Williams Sonoma French Vanilla Cinammon Sugar, which really helps to enhance almost any cinammon sugar recipe (like oatmeal cookies). Great for Sunday Morning Brunch.

I used regular slices of honey wheat bread and made 1/3 of the maple syrup and 2/3 of the egg mix. Boiling the maple syrup was an excellent idea, but the first time around I forgot to copensate for the reduced amount in the cooking time and ended up throwing it out and starting over (it caramelized). Maybe it's just because of the bread I used, but I had to change the cooking temperature. French toast cooks like pancakes, thus at medium-high, they're left completely mushy in the middle while brown on the outside. I found the results were more palatable with a med-low heat setting. The recipe tastes great. Adding the maple syrup mix to the eggs was an excellent and scrumptious idea.

used challah bread and added banana to the last minute of syrup . AWESOME! I will definately make again.

Husband made this for me this am. Used milk instead og half and half and used half of the syrup called for cos there are only 2 of us. The best part of his adaptations was that after he cooked the syrup, he put slices of banana in it so they got hot and a bit cooked and then topped the franch toast with that...amazing!!!!!!! Try it!!!!!!!

This is an excellent tasting recipe for french toast. I made this for brunch and everyone loved them. The syrup, however, was quiet disgusting because after boiling it took on the consistency of the contents of a spitoon-yuk! It was tasty, but the look of it was enough to send us running from the table. I will definitely use this recipe again without boiling the syrup.

Very easy quick meal. I recently made this for a party of 6 people. I probably did not add enough syrup to the batter, but on the whole, everyone liked the french toast. It only took about 30 minutes to make. I used ciabatta instead of egg bread, but it tasted very good.

delicious and simple. Very filling. One piece and my husband could not take another bite. It tastes like a fresh cinnamon roll with gooey carmel glazing. EXCELLENT.

Finally a winning recipe from epicurious (I was on a losing streak)!! Do NOT skip the syrup. I almost opted to just use my real maple syrup as is thinking adding cinnamon would "cheapen" the good stuff. It was awesome! It crystalizes a little after boiling. I ate the leftover syrup with a spoon savoring every drop. I used French bread and the only change I would make is cooking at least 4 minutes on each side. It was a little soggy in the middle. Also, I halved both the syrup and the batter and still got enough for 6 slices of bread which served 2.

I tried this recipe using a loaf of "country white" bread, slicing it into one-inch slices. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out to be SOOOOO delicious. The syrup was especially good - it was like something I'd expect at a bed and breakfast. Very easy to make, and delicious -I will definitely be making this recipe again!!
