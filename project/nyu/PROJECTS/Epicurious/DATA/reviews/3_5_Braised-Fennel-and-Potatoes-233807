I made this with a lot of modifications - used chicken broth instead of water, added some white wine and lemon juice, and added some chopped-up chicken breast to make it a one-dish meal. It came out flavorful and tasted good. But my potatoes were very mushy, which really hurt the dish. It might have been better if the dish were roasted in the oven so that it had some texture. Not sure if I'll make it again.

Cooked as specified, the dish was too sweet. I'm a big fan of fennel and was looking forward too this, but the onions overwhelmed the fennel taste, and by the time the potatoes were cooked, the fennel and onion had turned mushy. If I reduced the cooking time for the fennel and onion, then the result might have been better, but still not a great display of the fennel bulb.

I needed the stove top space, so after braising the fennel and onion I finished the remainder of the cooking (with the potatoes) in a 425 degree oven for ~ 25 minutes with extra liquid (vegetable broth), and to prevent the potatoes from drying out, I stirred them a couple of times as well. This was wonderful with beef tenderloin.

This is so simple, and I usually reserve my 4-star ratings for more impressive dishes, but this was so wonderful. I made it for a dinner party and my guests were highly impressed with it. It was embarassingly easy, but the flavors were perfect.

I really liked this, especially since there's no dairy and I don't do well with dairy. I cooked the onions and fennel longer than it said, until they started to carmelize, but not all the way. I also julienned the red potatoes. And because I had more than a pound (just over), I added 2/3 cup water instead of 1/2. By cooking the onions and fennel longer, they just sort of melted away, making a really lovely sauce! My husband thought there was cream in the recipe, but there wasn't even butter. And I added some fennel seed and celery salt too, just for extra spice.

We were not impressed with this. It was pretty bland and the flavors didn't meld. It just tasted like steamed potatoes and sauteed fennel. It needs something more- one other reviewer mentioned using chicken broth instead of water, that might do it. But I am not inspired to try again.

This is really great and a nice change from sauteed potatoes. I made this as a side to the Veal Chops with Mustard Sage dressing (on this site) and as I was pushed for time, cooked the recipe up to adding the potatoes, earlier. I added the potatoes and continued as per the recipe as my chops were cooking and the timing was perfect. I did need to add a little more water. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful. It takes potatoes to a whole new level. They come out silky and creamy and delicious. Was great with fennel, but it would be a great way to cook potatoes even without the fennel.

I love this dish but made a few changes. I substituted the 1/2 cup of water with 3/4 cup of chicken broth. This dish also works well with any kind of potato (you'll need to vary the cooking time).

I made this as a side dish for a standing rib roast. Even though there's a lot to do at the last minute, it could be done easily while the roast rested. Next time I probably will saute the onions and fennel ahead and then add the potatoes at serving time. This is a very flavorful dish and went well with the beef. (It would serve 4, but not 6.)

Easy and filling! Since it was the first time I made this recipe, I didn't make any changes and it was great! The potatoes got a bit mushy, but I didn't mind.

This makes a delicious side dish for fish, chicken or just about anything. I added a little fennel seed to boost the flavor of the anise, but also some pitted kalamata olives, which really added to the color and flavor.
