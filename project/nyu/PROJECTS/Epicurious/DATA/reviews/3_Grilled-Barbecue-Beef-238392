Upon revisiting this recipe for a party, I used brewed coffee in the mix to the pot while cooking. I have made this before according to the recipe and I think its easy and tasty, either way.

Great recipe. I used flank steak because I couldn't find flatiron.

This is a fantastic recipe! Didn't change a thing and used the flatiron steaks on the grill. This is definitely a keeper.

We thought this was very good! I made no changes to recipe, other doubling the entire recipe.
