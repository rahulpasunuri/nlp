Pretty good stuffing - the fennel is MUCH better than celery. I used much less butter and tried chorizo instead of Italian sausage. Had it just a bit mixed in and realized it wouldn't work w the fennel, so used the Italian instead. All the guests remarked they really liked it.

Very, very, very good. I made this for Thanksgiving and was really pleased with the result. Instead of the buttermilk cornbread, I used three different types of bread including a pumpernickel and thought that added a nice compliment to the fennel and sausage.

Tried this as directed in 2008 and wasn't too impressed. This year, I doubled the sausage to 2 lbs., used 2 tsp sage instead of thyme (was unexpectedly out),used Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing instead of corn bread, and added 1/2 cup milk to moisten in addition to the broth. It was the very best, all of our guests raved about the dressing. Baked as directed, perfect! B.J. Harrick

This recipe was nice but not by itself. I combined this with the Roast Turkey with Prosciutto-Hazelnut recipe that epicurious has. I added one can of chopped black olives too (not on either recipe). By combining the prosciutto, adding the chopped hazelnuts and the spices not mentioned on this recipe, plus the chopped black olives, the combination of both recipes made quite a delightful and tasty experience.

A great recipe. The fennel taste with the sausage is fantastic. I made it exactly as instructed and it was great.

This is our family's "official" stuffing. We had to adjust the amount of chicken broth so it didn't dry out. The fennel and onion flavors meld with the sausage for a house warming aroma that makes no mistake it's the holidays.

We made this for Thanksgiving, and would definitely make it again! However, we'd make more of the buttermilk and sage cornbread, as we found the sausage-to-cornbread ratio to be needing more of the latter. We did add an extra 1 tbsp of sugar to the cornbread recipe, as was suggested. we LOVE fennel and used the indicated amount of chopped bulb (maybe even a little more!), but cut back a little on the ground fennel seed (it seemed too much). We served 2 stuffing choices with the dinner, the other being a super-simple white bread, meatless stuffing (but made with schmaltz in place of other fats). It was really fun and satisfying having 2 different kinds of stuffing, as it allows you to be more adventurous with one of them. We'll definitely be doing it again next year!

Another great way for me to enjoy my favorite Al Fresco Chicken Sausage!
