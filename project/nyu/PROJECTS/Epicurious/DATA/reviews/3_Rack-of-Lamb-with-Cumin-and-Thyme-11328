I used a little more garlic because we like it, but did not cut down on the cumin as another person suggested. Other than that, we cooked the lamb for 5 minutes beyond the suggested time and then checked it. We found it still needed another 5 minutes for a total of 25 minutes and came out med rare. I suggest checking on it before chancing overcooking it as many ovens cook differently. We have made it again and love the simplicity as well as quick way to deliver a gourmet tasting meal.

Cooking time was off. I cooked it for 20 minutes and it was too raw for my liking. I cooked it for another 5 minutes and that was good for me. This had a strong cumin taste. Next time, I'll add more garlic and salt, and less cumin.

In 1992 made the entire Valentine's Day dinner from that years Gourmet gourmet magazine. I have been searching for the recipes ever since. It was so fabulous that even my gourmet chef French hubby was completely impressed (not easy to do!!) i am delighted to be able to recreate that dinner 10 years later! One word of caution, being a rather novice cook in the way of "fancy" food, i did not check my lamb rack prior to cooking. When I went to serve it I discovered that the riblets had never been cut. No amount of sawing with a knife would get them apart. I ended up putting it on a serving platter and we had to tear the meat off the bones. A little messy...but a fond memory of a long ago Valentine dinner. And it smelled heavenly!!

I have been making this for several years, but make some adjustments. I bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes and let it stand for 5 minutes. I use an extra tablespoon of oil and very finely ground breadcrumbs. Still, the herb and spice mixture is excellent on the lamb, which is why I come back to the recipe.

Easy and d-lish! prepared as directed - plus - I made slits in the meat and added more garlic -generous salt and pepper let the crust sit on the meat for an hour or so to marinate together. I used rosemary and put sprigs of rosemary under the meat while baking-this was worth it - baked for 20 minuted and let stand for 10 minutes. My husband said it's a winner please make it again!

I have to defend this recipe. I made it a while ago and just came back to search for it because I'm having company in a few weeks and wanted to make it again. I don't remember if the cooking timr was right or not, but I check everything with an instant-read thermometer anyway. Also, if there's too much crust then just don't use the extra. This was DELICIOUS and my company loved it the last time I made it as I'm sure my friends will in a few weeks. Don't be shy about trying this because the flavors are great!

The cooking time is definitely way off. I gave it an extra three minutes, but that still wasn't enough. Unfortunately, everything else was ready for the table, so I "nuked" it (sacrilege) for 2 minutes and ended up with a perfect medium-rare cut. I made the bread crumb mixture and let it stand for a couple of hours to let the tastes come together. Rosemary makes a nice substitute for the thyme.

I was disappointed with the crust. It was too flaky even though I used three times the amount of oil! It also did not enhance the flavour. Cooking times at 475'F were longer, but I should have allowed only 5 mins, rather than the 10 mins. that I continued cooking. Not really worth the effort.

I didn't care for this recipe. I think that there was too much bread crumb mixture for the amount of meat. The cooking time was not even close. We cooked it twice as long as suggested in the recipe to reach 130-135 degrees on the meat thermometer.
