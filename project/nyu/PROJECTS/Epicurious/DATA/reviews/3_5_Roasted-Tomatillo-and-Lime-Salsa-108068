This is a winner. The recipe needs to be doubled for sure. You can use it on anything:chips,tacos, beef,chicken. fish. And, it is so easy for such a delightful complex taste.

Loved it. Not spicy, not too much garlic, just right. Huge recipe though. I would make half recipe next time.

This was a hit, the only problem is that the recipe makes such a small amount. I would at least double so your have enough for all. Also, it's quite spicy, so cut down on the jalapeno if you don't like it hot.

The mint adds a very good twist on roasted tomatillo salsa. It very flavorful but don't forget to de-seed the jalepeno!!

I made these for our gourmet club and they were totally overshadowed my the roasted aparagus quesadillas that I had also made. Tough competition. While the salsa was wonderful and I would make that again (although it didn't make even near 1 cup), the cakes were good, but not worth the effort to do again. If you do make them, make sure the dough is very moist (my pancakes broke as I folded them). And, being from the land of Swedes, if you don't have a tortilla press, a krumkaka iron worked great to flatten the masa balls!! The instructions in the magazine, with the pictures was a great help.
