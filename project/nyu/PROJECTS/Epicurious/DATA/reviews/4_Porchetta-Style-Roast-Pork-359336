Made for Easter dinner using a 3.5lb pork shoulder. Delicious. Crispy crust, juicy meat. Did 20 mins at 450, about 1.5 at 300. I didn't have a salt problem with either the meat or the jus. I made the full portion of crust and patted it all over top and sides. Would def make again.

Made this recipe with a side of roasted cauliflower with onions, fennel & apples and poured the sauce over the whole thing. The pork was crispy on the outside and tender-juicy on the inside. I didn't cook it nearly as long as the recipe called for, and used home-made chicken stock & red wine for the sauce (didn't have any white) and it was still delicious!

Made this using a 3.5 lb boneless pork shoulder and halved the other ingredients. I baked the pork in an oven proof skillet; didn't have any pan juices after baking so just added wine and broth and reduced sauce to our liking. The flavoring of the seasoning crust on the port is delicious and the sauce helps make this dish. Unfortunately i over cooked my pork, but the flavor still could be tasted. Will definitely make again.

I just have to say I don"t usually rate anything, however, This recipe is absolutely amazing. I made it for a party and everyone went crazy for it. So thank you Epicurious and Bon Appetit!!!

More suggestions for sides than "Roasted green beans with garlic and pan-fried smashed baby potatoes with Parmesan"? I do roasted green beans so often my fam is going to boo me if I do it again :)

I boned this myself and stared a quick stock with the bone and veggies,which came in handy as the roast rested. Used a Cab for the basting along w,the stock. The red pepper and fennel are key.The jus is quite flavorful and somewhat salty,so stock with just enough cornstarch slurry to coat a spoon well worked out well.

agree with many others that salt was an issue, even though i cut it in half and used low sodium broth. also from the smell coming from the kitchen( loved the fennel) it seemed as if the bottem of the pan was going to burn in the first half hour. added a splash of broth and reduced heat after only 20 minutes or i'm sure my drippings would have been useless. that said will definately make again. meat was moist and juicy and sauce was good if a bit saltier than i wished.

I made this with 7# of meat for 8 people, increasing the rub proportions accordingly. The meat was very tender and the "gravy" was delicious (I cut down the salt). Yes, it was fatty but you don't have to eat the fat of course! We definitely needed more sauce even though I increased the wine and chicken broth more than the recipe stated. Everyone raved about it. It was very easy and the only part that was kind of a pain was grinding the spices. I used my salt grinder (I suppose I could have used my pepper grinder) and I ended up breaking it! I guess it was worth it though :)

I really wanted to make this same-day, so I didn't even have close to overnight to let the pork sit in the garlic and spice rub. More like a couple of hours. It was incredibly flavorful. The pork had this amazing crust on it, and was so moist and tender inside. A 4-forker, no question. I made the potato and celery root mash with mascarpone to go with this, and it was a fantastic (but rich) pairing. Will make again, next time with the patience to let the rub sit overnight. Can't wait!

Was a hit. I scored the skin before putting on the garlic and the rub. I only had time to let the rub stand on the pork for about 4 hours and it was still delicious. I think 190 degrees is a bit high, though. I thought it could have been a tad moister.

"Thinly slice" No way, slabs! slabs! delicious and the house smells amazing! Roasted green beans with garlic and pan-fried smashed baby potatoes with Parmesan. Outstanding!

Amazingly good, nice flavorful crust on the outside and juicy moistness on the inside. The sauce was good also, though the meat was excellent alone. I'd make this for company!

Made this for our annual Christmas party of 20 plus guests and it was a huge success! So easy to do. Just remember to put the rub on the night before. I doubled the recipe and had plenty! Love it!

Have made this twice now and really enjoyed it both times. The first time we cooked exactly as directed and it turned out fabulous. The second time I cooked it using my BBQ rotisserie over indirect heat. Basted using juices, white wine, chicken stock and garlic from the drip pan. Whipped up the jus while the roast was resting it was even better than the first time. Spice rub forms a fabulous, crispy crust. Yum!

I've only made pork shoulder / Boston butt as pulled pork, so I was eager to try this recipe. I was timid about the fennel and only used 1 Tbsp. and only toasted 2 minutes because it looked like it was about to burn. Based on the reviews, I cut the salt to 2 tsp. It smelled absolutely divine while roasting. I roasted it to 180 (not 190) degrees, and it was fine. For the sauce, I poured the wine and broth into the baking sheet and deglazed put then poured it into a skillet to reduce. I reduced far more than they said -- to about 2 Tbsp (not 3/4 c.). And then I reduced the drippings too. The pork itself was not salty, but the sauce was (but not overly so). This was tasty, but fatty. I want to make it again, but maybe with a pork loin roast (not a tenderloin - but a loin roast) so it won't be so fatty.

Very tasty. We have made this for dinner and also as a snack for a group of folks...serving with thick cut toasted French bread. Works well either way. We double up the garlic to the marinade and also add more chicken stock to the gravy as it is quite strong...even in small doses. The meal is memorable.

This was delicious. A tiny bit salty but very good. We did have trouble with the gravy - I think all the spices made the drippings very strong. We had to dilute with quite a bit more chicken stock, then thickened with a bit of corn starch. Overall a definite winner

Just to clarify... I made the rub with with 12 cloves garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, ground red pepper, kosher salt and fresh pepper. It made a lovely crust. Just delicious!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge crowd pleaser... Practically nothing left over. Even the kids (ages 3-5) enthusiastically gobbled it up. Plus the house still smells fantastic the next day! Definitely will make this again.

I made this recipe to the "T" except I only had time to marinate the roast for about 4 hours before cooking. The flavors were generally good, but I found the fennel quite overpowering and it was far too salty. I would cut the kosher salt at least in half, and I am someone who loves salt and always adds extra! It's a good base recipe, but needs some work.

This was soooo delicious and easy! Made gravy from drippings and served with roasted new potatoes, spinach salad and leftover cranberry relish from Thanaksgiving.

Great recipe: inexpensive, easy, and so good. I made it exactly according to the recipe & served it with home-made apple sauce. It's a great foil for fall vegetables.

Very interesting and tasty rub! The meat was flavorful and juicy. The added bonus: pork shoulder is an inexpensive piece of meat.

For whatever reason, I really struggle with pork but this recipe was fantastic. The only change I made was to add a bit of flour to the pan drippings before adding the wine and broth so we would have a thicker gravy. Also, pulled the roast out of the oven at 175 and tented with foil until it reached 190. Very juicy, easy and the house smells amazing.

Fantastic receipe. Followed the directions exactly. Perfect flavors Not much cooking juices left, but did not matter. Bought the boneless pork shoulder at Costco. (12.5 pounds in package, but it is actually 2 roasts so it was perfect.

Great recipe. We used a bigger piece meat (nearly nine lb.) and did one and a half recipes of the dry rub and one and a cup and half of wine for the sauce. The rub was delicious and the flavor permeated the meat more than most marinades or rubs. It had a great crispy thin crust and was good and moist inside.

Pork shoulder is one of those chefs secret cuts of meat that is inexpensive and tastes delicious. Even when its not on sale, its only about $2.00/pound at my grocery store. With little effort the roast pork came out of the oven looking beautiful, and it worked well as both a main dish and for pulled pork sandwiches. I made it a second time with a bone-in roast in a roasting pan and that worked great too. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/porchetta-style-roast-pork/

my family loved this and I am making it again this week. Leftover meat is great in quesadillas or salads.

I found this to be a very flavorful and delicious recipe. It was very easy to fix, and the wine sauce was a great accompaniment. I look forward to fixing it again. I plan to make pork tacos with the leftovers.

Excellent flavor.Instead of the 300@ I put the roast in the crock pot. Very tender. This would be excellent as sliders for a party. Just add a little coleslaw/ or not on top of the meat and you have a hit.

Excellent! The fennel/pepper/garlic coating is superb. What a moist and inexpensive cut of pork. Had butcher cut to exact specs with thin coating of fat. Served several times during the week and last small portion, cut very thin with leftover pan gravy and homemade horseradish sauce! Will do again and again.

I used the rub on pork loin chops and grilled them. Great peppery flavor!

Wow! If I could give this more than 4 forks I would. I cooked as recipe stated and it was fantastic!! The smell while cooking was intoxicating. The pork was tender and moist and the flavor was incredible. The spices mixed nicely and the fennel seed added a nice undertone without being overly strong. This was also so easy. I would defintely make againa and even serve for a dinner party

I've made this twice in a week - it's SO good! I'm going to use it 3 ways: as is with the pan juice gravy, pulled with BBQ sauce for pulled pork sandwiches and lastly, we're going to have carnitas tacos with the shredded remainders! So very versatile. I used bone-in, very thick cut pork shoulder steaks tied together with butcher twine the first time (that's all the butcher had left of shoulder) and a large shoulder cut portion from Costco today. It was twice the size that the recipe called for, but I left the seasonings the same as called for in the recipe because the first time it seemed like the fennel and garlic were a little overpowering. I'd go easier on the salt next time - the pan juices were very salty so I diluted with more chicken stock. I've never made a pork roast so this was an incredible introduction!

I made this for company and it was fabulous! Great flavor, did'nt change a thing. However, the recipe says to cook to 190 degrees I spoke to the buther and cooked it until 160 with meat thermometer. It's a keeper!!

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and I had people asking if it was ok to take some leftovers home. Instead of a boneless pork shoulder I bought a bone in one. I used more garlic than the recipe called for and no one complained that the garlic was over powering. Like the previous reviewer, I did it on the grill as well. It was well worth the 4 hr+ wait time. The meat was juicy and tender. This is definitely a keeper.

Usually not a fennel fan, but this had a great taste once it was ground and combined w/the rest of the ingredients. I did it on the grill; indirect medium until it reached 185 degrees, it took about 4 hours. I used a foil pan thinking I would use the pan juice to complete the recipe but never got around to making the sauce...would probably skip the pan next time. Served it in chunks with coleslaw.
