I've been making this for years (7+) in the slow cooker (12 hours on low is best) and it is FABULOUS. Obviously it would be phenomenal in a smoker. Every time I make it there are no leftovers and praise for my cooking skills comes rolling in. My personal taste with regards to coleslaw is to not sweeten AT ALL and the more black pepper the better (thus I LOVE this recipe), but if you disagree you can of course modify to your preferences. If you are not a vinegar fan this recipe won't float your boat. If you cook in the slow cooker your house might smell like an old shoe but it will be worth it.

Rub was fantastic on the pork, best I've made yet. Added lots of onions, some beef stock and cumin. Cooked in a slow cooker for about 7 hrs. Fabulous. Definitely will make this again.

Excellent flavors!! I've made it just as noted on recipe over four times. Never disappointed. Guests LOVE it! Distinct flavors. Fire up the water smoker or indirect side of a grill with a water pan really adds alot. Don't forget the wood chips/chunks.

As a child I refused to eat pork so it wasn't until I was an adult that I really started eating it. I made this recipe the other day and it was so delicious. I cant believe I used to never eat it. Pork Roast Recipes like this are great because you can prepare them and have enough that you can get a couple of meals out of it. I work with Better Recipes so I am always reviewing recipes and I really like that this one suggests a dry rub. It gives it so much flavor.

Per comments below, I also smoke at about 190 - 195 (3 to 4 hours), then wrap tightly in foil and continue braising in the oven with plenty of vinegar mop at 225 for another 2 to 4 hours. Falls off the bone and the fat and connective tissue melts away. Don't skip the tangy coleslaw or Carolina red vinegar BBQ sauce!

I've made this recipe for our July 4th celebration every year since the recipe first appeared (in 1999). As a Southern expatriate living North of the Mason Dixon Line for the past 23 years, this is the best, most authentic "Southern" BBQ recipe I've found! I've made converts of many of my friends and neighbors who had only previously had sticky (Kansas City-style) BBQ.

This recipe is delicious, also the coleslaw is a hit. I find myself making the coleslaw for every BBQ i host or attend,if I'm making pork or not. Also we did A full pig roast back in may and I used the dry rub and mop. made for some delicious pork. one word this is a very peppery rub. I like that but some may not.

This recipe is amazing. I slow cook it so double or triple the mop to have enough liquid. We love it.

Rating: 3
Oh, almost forgot...as others have noted, good target temperature is 190-195 in order to allow for the meat to really fall apart and make pulling virtually efortless. I usually pull my shoulder off the smoker at around 180, wrap in foil for 30 minutes or so while the pork continues to cook and come to that magic temperature.

Rating: 3
Overall very good; pulled pork is one of my all time favorites and I do it at pretty much every BBQ I hold. The only reason this is not a four fork is that IMO, the mop is unnecessary. Of course, to mop or not to mop BBQ has been a long and ongoing debate amongst BBQ afficionados so take it for what it's worth. I've done many a BBQ and this was the first time I used a mop....Just remember, if you're lookin' you're not cookin'. I prefer a good rub put on about 24 hours prior and simple smoke from a combination of Hickory and Apple woods. While you can make this in a slow cooker or oven, it is just not the same as on the smoker. Remember that true BBQ is smoked, slow and low.

I made this recipe for the concession stand at a 5K fund raising - where we were feeding about 500 people. The first year we sold out by the end of the day. Second year we sold out in two hours. Third year people were lined up as we were setting up the stand at 9.00 am! Key is as other reviewers have said - slow cooking (smoking on a grill, please), mopping frequently and being patient until meat reaches internal temperature of 190° or above. Pork will then easily 'pull'. As for the sauce which many complained about - half the fun of Epicurious recipes is to tweak to your own personal taste. I add a bit more sugar and ketchup and reduce the vinegar and don't forget the red pepper flakes. I love to make this for summer barbecue parties - as hosts we provide the meat and coleslaw and ask the guests to bring everything else. But, they have to come prepared to 'pull' before they can eat!

Perfection in a slow cooker and easy. I let it sit a few hours in the fridge with the rub, then doubled the mop and cooked in the slow cooker for 12 hours on low. It was so good, better than the BBQ we can get up North by a long shot.

Just an extra note to my other review... I forgot to mention the vinegar in the coleslaw. Of course.

I gave this recipe 4 forks but I did also make a lot of modifications as I went along... First, I did not think there was enough rub so I actually kept adding to it, mostly more sugar, but also added chili powder, a little bit of cumin, and some adobo criollo. When I was done, the rub was basically like a thick coating around the entire pork shoulder and I let it sit in plastic wrap overnight. I cooked it in the oven using some liquid smoke in the mop. It cooked for about 11 hours in a 250 degree oven and when I pulled it it fell apart in my fingers! YUM. I started making the BBQ sauce but thought it was too vinegary and not sweet enough so once again, got heavy handed with sugar, more ketchup, and I added some honey (would have added molasses but didn't have any). My BBQ sauce was very different, much sweeter than the recipe. And finally, I did not like the idea of the tangy coleslaw so I made up my own, it was delicious. Red and green cabbage, mayo, some sour cream, lots of sugar, mustard seeds, mustard powder, salt, pepper.

It was my first time making pulled pork of any kind. Thanks to the other reviews and suggestions I tried making it in a slow cooker. Seared the meat in a pan then put it in the pot in the morning with half of the mop, 9 hours later they were done. I did 9 pounds worth of meat and I had to flip them half ways so it would cook on the other side. I didn't cut the pieces small enough so mine took longer to cook. My husband and family raved...we weren't too big on the vinegar sauce, but good thing we had the store bought ones available. Recommend you try this recipe, I would definitely make this again!

I use a slow cooker to prepare the pork and it is delicious. I marinade the pork with the dry rub overnight. I changed the mop mixtur by adding 2 teaspoons liquid smoke and eliminated the salt and oil. The mop mixture is poured over the pork after putting in the slow cooker. I cook on slow for 6 to 8 hours. A great weekend meal.

Like the other reviewers say, cook the meat to 190 for it to be pullable. (it worth it just to read the other reviews for entertainment value). I marinated overnight. Pretty good for the first try. I think with practice I can get this to the taste of 4 forks.

This recipe is a hit whenever I make it. I've taken it to the office for a party and made it for a football Sunday. People rave. I do spend time picking out the fat from the meat as it falls apart. But it is really tender and tasty even prepared in a crock pot which I use. I leave it cooking all night, then cool it and pick it apart.

Dave in Phoenix you are the reason I read other people's reviews! Thank you for taking the time to figure out when the fat breaks down and for sharing this piece of advice. I've made pulled pork before using a Bobby Flay recipe that failed to mention this tidbit. Pulling the pork was a huge pain. Tried it your way and it fell apart. XOXO.

This is great in the slow cooker. While I admit that I am from New England, my parents retired in North Carolina and I spend a fair amount of time there. I have been to some of the top rated BBQ spots in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area--from Allen & Sons to the places with local fame. I think this recipe is a fairly close replica. It is by far the best recipe I have encountered (adapted) for the slow cooker thus far. I followed the reviews and used smoked paprika, marinated the meat overnight and grilled the pork prior to putting it in the slow cooker with the mop. I was also worried about the amount of pepper, so I cut it back just a hair--I probably only used about 2 1/2 tablespoons. The Carolina Red BBQ Sauce is a must! Can't wait to try it on my father this summer!

This is spectacular. I've made it stove top or in the oven, and it's much more tender (with liquid smoke) but I prefer it in our smoker. I'm going to try it for longer and on a lower heat, aiming for the tenderness I got in the oven. restlesschef.blogspot.com

This is very tangy barbecue, not at all sweet. I cooked it for 8 hours in the slow cooker, using smoked paprika in the rub to give it a deeper flavor. I liked the combination of tangy meat and creamy coleslaw, and I'd probably make it again.

Rating: 3
I have been using this recipe since 1999 and have found if you use some liquid smoke (Wright's for example) it addes the smoky flavor without the need to actually smoke the meat. I cook it in the oven. A little liquid smoke goes a long way, so careful not to overdue it.

Have made this twice for football crowds. It went over great both times. Left the meat with the rub in the refrigerator overnight, then cooked 12 hours in crock pot, then let cool and shredded the meat which falls apart easily. I pick out fat at the same time. It takes a couple of days advance planning time, but it is easy. I added a little BBQ sauce to the pot along with the degreased juices to keep it from drying out while people serve themselves from the crockpot.

Read the 2nd review, posted by by ksmahler from Richmond, Va. Gospel, each and every word. I kept getting impatient between 160-175 degrees. This is the time the connective tissue that prevents you from pulling is changing into moisture. Let 'er ride. I finally waited 15 1/2 hours for 195, and the reward was worth it. Buy a good smoker, tend the fire (unless you can afford the ceramic cookers! Light and wait!) and eat real BBQ. Dave in Phoenix

One Saturday I was browsing epicurious and came across this one. I had to make it. After a trip to the store I was rubbing down my Boston Butt and cooking it on my high end gas grill that was able to hold 250. I loved it. However, there is more. After spending a lot more time learning about true BBQing and cooking many more Boston Butts and ribs I have discovered this recipe is a bit flawed. First, cooking a Boston Butt to 160 degrees will give you a fantastic chopped port sandwich. It will NOT pull. To cook pork for pulling you must cook it to 190 degrees and for somewhere around 12 - 14 hours at a cooking temp of 225 - 250. While I did my first cook on my grill and have read of many making this in the oven or crock pot I can only say, you are missing the great taste of a smoker. Since making this the first time, I have purchased two smokers. I feel that the difference between oven/crockpot/grill cooked pulled pork and smoker cooked is night and day. If you like pulled pork, I suggest you try this with a few modifications on a smoker. Also, visit some of the great BBQ forums on the internet. I have learned so much in a short time. Enjoy the pulled pork and if you are so inclined try my Carolina BBQ Sauce No. 1. It's really a treat.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the past week and it is amazing. I do not have a smoker, so I started it on the grill (about 20 mins.) and then put in a crock pot with the mop for 8+ hours. Delicious. It is much better started on the grill, and letting the dry rub sit for several hours is a must. (I tried shortcutting and just putting it straight into the crockpot once and it was not nearly as good.) One tip for less greasy meat is to make sure you cook the meat fat side UP in the crock. Skip the NC style barbecue 'sauce' and use your own. I like the Party Barbecue Sauce from this site, adjusted to the way we like it.

I'm also a cook from the South, and want to tell all y'all yankees that it's absolutely FINE to cook it in the crockpot or in your oven! This recipe is super, and since I've been cooking it this way for years, want to point a couple things out. Do make sure you cook this fat side on top, and if you let it cook to about 195 degrees, you won't have to do any pulling at all, it'll fall right apart in your hands. I recently served this to a bunch of my friends from up North, and talked them into adding sweet cole slaw to the top of the meat on the bun, and they all loved it! Real quick: 1 head of cabbage, 1/4 C vinegar, 1/3 C sugar, 1 C mayo. That's it, and YUMMMMM!!!!

Despite my Boston zip code and need to pull out the crock pot, this was a big hit. Disclaimer: I did finish these in the crockpot (although I braved the Boston winter to start them on the grill), and while I don't usually review if I haven't followed a recipe at least once to the letter, the departure has been covered in such detail I feel OK adding my two cents. I followed the rub/mop instructions to the letter -- let the ribs sit overnight with the spices and then started them on the grill the next day. The grill gave it a nice smokey taste that the slowcooker couldn't. Took the ribs off the grill, layered them with onions, poured water over the top, cooked on low for eight hours, cooled, then pulled the meat. Put that all back in the slow cooker with the BBQ sauce I made (close to the Carolina sauce outlined here, but with our own twist), simmered another two hours, and had a big hit on our hands. Over the summer we'll try the full-grill treatment, but I've made it three times since Christmas due to popular demand, and haven't heard any complaints yet!

wowza!!! Loved, loved this recipe!!! I made it in a crock pot (sorry) but I slow cooked overnight and let the meat sit with the rub all day. I was worried that it would be too peppery and too much vineger, but not the case. I made a TON for an Indy 500 party and none was left. Don't change anything ( and I imagine smoking it would even be better) but this was da bomb!!! So good, so easy...awesome!

Since I last reviewed this recipe in March 2007, I have cooked it a number of times. My husband loves it and guests do too. I still don't have an outdoor slow cooker and haul out the crock pot. I'm a New England Yankee (and always root for the Red Sox and Patriots.) Apologies to you Southerners, but we cook this meat mid-winter when its too cold to bbq outdoors! Definitely follow directions on cut of meat. Definitely add vinegar-- (it does help to break down the meat for easy pullin') and close the kitchen door so your whole house doesn't smell like yummy bbq. Cook in crock pot, on low if you have 8-10 hours, or on high if you only have 4-6 hours. Prior to cooking when you don't have time to dry rub 2hrs+, toss rub ingredients in crock and rub into all sides except fatty side, then remove meat, add 1/2 of mop, minus the oil and cut way back on the salt. (If you don't have paprika, wisk 1-2 tlbsp of tomato paste.) Put meat back into crock pot, being careful not to wash off rub from sides. I like to serve with PLENTY of small egg knot rolls, lightly toasted in oven (as this sandwich in bigger rolls is messy-hard-to- handle). Small sandwiches makes it more appetizer- informal-friendly and encourages guests to return for more when they are grabbing a beer from the 'fridge. When I set out the spread for our Super Bowl party (New England Patriots vs NY Giants '08), I made sure to encourage guests to spoon mop on to the roll and top coleslaw on to pulled pork. Big hit (and a repeat of AFL Championship party menu for same guests two weeks prior...they begged for a replay!) Too bad the Pats lost, thank goodness my spread was a comfort food hit!

This is for the cook from the South. As a Southern girl transplanted in North Dakota, I can understand your devotion to the traditional cooking method, but bless your heart, you did not realize that it is not unusual to have negative sixty degrees suring the winter here, and that in the middle of winter the crock pot is the best option. I don't think your green egg would be able to melt a ice cube in that temperature.

Yall Yankees are a hoot. I can't believe that almost all of you use a crock pot (or my heavens, an oven???) for this. Yall need ta git you a Big Green Egg (www.biggreenegg.com ) which is basically a kiln that you can maintain at very low temperatures (200-250 degrees) for a very long time (like, 20 hours) using lump charcoal without ever lifting the lid. Works fine when it's freezing outside. You folks from Boston: you are hereby prohibited from ever trying to cook barbeque again! Stick to your peetzer and beeah. One more thing, the guy who says to finish by wrapping it in foil and bringing it up to 190 degrees is spot on. Won't "fork", otherwise.

awesome recipe -- all aspects. i used the crock method with some liquid smoke -- stellar.

I love this recipe. I too used the crock pot as it's winter. Put the rub on overnigh. Put the pork and only 1/2 the mop in for 11 hours. Family loves it. A bit too vinegary for me so I used only 1 cup of vinegar for the bbq sauce.

This is an incredible recipe. We use it all the time and it most definitely gives us the taste of eastern NC barbecue. My wife has learned that placing everything in the crock pot in the morning creates a great barbecue in time for dinner. Enjoy this with some slaw and hush puppies, especially if you cannot make it to NC for the real thing!

I bought a huge pork shoulder from Costco, just under 14 pounds. Turned out it was 2 shoulders in the same package, but i decided to make all of it. I cut way back on the brown sugar b/c of another reviewer's experience and the fact that I had planned to cook it overnight. I cooked the meat for 1 hour at 350 degrees, then I turned the oven down and to 250 degrees and cooked it for another 12 hours. I just finished pulling the pork after chilling it for 5 hours and it was a lot fo work. The meat is perfectly tender and has a good flavor. I have no idea what I am going to do with all the left-overs, though. It seemed like such a good idea at the time.

I made this last weekend to rave reviews! No smoker so I "browned" the meat, searing the outside nicely on the grill then put the meat with the mop ingreadients + extra water into the crock pot with about 1tbs of liquid smoke. It was delicious! Also made the accompanying BBQ sauce and slaw. Note that I used probably 3x the brown sugar for the BBQ sauce as the recipe called for to cut the bite of the vinegar. I can't wait to make this again! You can't get Carolina BBQ in Colorado... now I can make it and it's SUPER easy.

This is a hit with my family. I don't have a smoker so I used a slow cooker--8 hours on low. It was delicious and easy. And the Tangy Coleslaw was great and the BBQ sauce is so easy and great with the pork. I served this with a Pinot Noir and a Sauvignon Blanc--and both wines worked in their own way.

Properly cooked pulled pork requires the internal temp. of the meat to reach at least 190 degrees so the fat in the center of the meat renders and the collagen breaks down. Cooking a butt to 165 will ensure you don't get sick but the meat will not be nearly as tender or juicy as it would be if cooked to 190.

Really good though just a little dry. We did at 225 in the oven for about 4hrs. Should have covered with tin foil throughout. Basted every 30 min with mop. Very good though.

Try the old fashioned potato salad recipe on this site. Outstanding.

I made this with the crock pot method, and used a turkey breast, instead of pork. It was excellent. I slow cooked in the mop for 8 hours on low, shredded the meat and added back to the pot with the bbq sauce, strained the mop and put it on the side as a condiment. The cole slaw adds just the right balance. A 6 pound bone-in breast fed 6 adults and 3 kids with seconds and leftovers. We served it with home made sweet potato chips. Excellent

I lost 12 lbs of meat with this recipe. I believe the brown sugar in the rub lead to the initial over browning of the meat, and cooking it for even hours hours at 225-250 gave me jerky.

This is the best Carolina style rub and mop recipe I've ever tried. The sauce mentioned in the recipe is a must. Note to those not familiar with eastern Carolina style - it is vinegary.

My family enjoy this recipe on a regular basis. Because of the weather here in ND I usually cook the pork in my crockpot, as do many other reviewers. It doesn't give you the same flavor as when you smoke it, but it is still great! To avoid the extreem salty flavor use corse salt, not table salt. There is a big difference in size and they are not interchangable. Overall this is a great recipe for basic pulled pork. I use my favorite BBQ suace on the side after it is cooked. Both my husband and I have different opinions on how much BBQ suace is needed for a sandwich. Don't forget to make your favorite slaw:) You can not eat pulled ork, or any BBQ for that mater, without slaw!

The best pulled pork I have ever had. I have made this many times and have rave reviews from many southerners. I have adapted the recipe to my tastes over the years and now use less salt, 1 tablespoon back pepper and chipotle peppers to add a smoky heat I make the sauce a little sweeter (personal preference) with a little more brown sugar and a little thicker with some tomato paste. I smoke it with hickory and apple for 4 hours than wrap it tight in foil and finish in a 250F oven for 2 - 3 hours. I find the meat is a little more moist and it cooks a little faster this way. Definitely serve with the sauce and coleslaw on the cheapest hamburger buns you can find, the fancier the bun the more it takes away from the wonderful flavour.

Fabulous recipe!!! Loved reading the reviews. (Especially the woman who chastised the guy for not following the directions AND having the nerve to write a bad review. Ha!) Must confess, I modify it a bit; using crock pot, chiplotle chili pepper, and not adding salt or oil when cooking. A couple of times I didn't have a chance to put the dry rub on the night before but still turned out yummy. Definitely use the vinegar, coleslaw and by all means, get nice small soft hamburger buns for a melt in your mouth delight.

I used the pork shoulder from Costco. Made the rub and let it sit overnight. I used my own BBQ sauce recipe for the mop and cooked it in a Dutch oven at 250 degrees for about 6 hrs. Let it cool and skimmed off the fat. Served with coleslaw; hubby, teenager and 10 yr old loved it. Looking forward to trying it on the smoker in warmer weather!

Based on the rave reviews, I prepared this recipe with great anticipation. What a letdown. Aside from not having a smoker, I followed the directions exactly. What a dud. The pork, as many said, was 'way too salty (but one can get beyond that with corrections next time-- but it isn't worth a next time). The BBQ sauce was mediocre (I even like tart, tangy tastes), and the slaw was also mediocre. What is everyone raving about? I may have to recalibrate-- usually reviews are fairly accurate! Lots of work and very little bang for my buck. What a disappointment.

This is the best pulled pork that I've ever made. I cooked the pork in the mop in my oven at 250 degrees for 6 hours then brought it up to 275 degrees for the last 2 hours. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and left the oil out of the mop. I also left out the pepper as there was quite a bit in the dry rub. It had great flavor without the additional pepper in the mop. I served it with a vinegary sauce and a creamy coleslaw. It was top notch. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is so similar to the one that comes in the little booklet with your crockpot, and is delish. I've made it several times to RAVES. My husband is a pulled pork sandwich enthusiast, and loves it. My "meat and taters" father loves it. But please make it the easy way.... dry rub the roast, plop it in the slow cooker with half of the vinegar sauce for 10-12 hours on low, and let 'er rip. Serve it with coleslaw and the rest of the sauce. Yes, you have to like vinegar.

I've never had this happen to me before with such a highly rated recipe on Epicurious. This pulled pork was absolutely awful. I followed every direction to a T except that I slow cooked the pork in the mop (like many reviewers recommended). While the pork cooked nicely and had a good consistency, the problem was everything else. The rub was extremely unappetizing - too much pepper, too much paprika - it tasted like I was aiming for pastrami, not pulled pork. The sauce included with this recipe is VILE. It said "thin, vinegary sauce" - they should have said vinegar with a negligible dollop of ketchup in it. I've never been so disappointed with anything that sounded like such a home run.

Great results for our Super Bowl party. I followed the crock-pot recipe...not able to bring myself to smoke out in 10 degree weather!! I followed the less salt, pepper advice and as for the previous note regarding the smell of a wet mop, I thought the smell reminded me of a summer bbq!

Like so many of you, I have been making this sandwich since the recipe was printed. This recipe taught me a lot about barbecue. One of the recent reviewers said that they would change the cut of meat to something less fatty. Please know that this recipe wouldn't be the same if you used a better cut of pork roast. The inclusion of vinegar in the mop will help break down the fats in the meat to make the sandwich moist. I do make a different barbecue sauce that the one that is published. My family prefers a spicy rootbeer barbecue sauce! Over the years I have shared this recipe with many, many people. In the winter, I have made pulled pork in the crock pot and in an oven roaster. I add a few drops of liquid smoke to the roast to add the smoke flavor that electric roasting misses. Grilling the pork is the way to go when the weather cooperates -- Robin Fort.

I grill/smoke ribs and shoulders frequently, I thought this was just OK. Nothing really special. I'll make it agian with a few additions. It really needs a kick in the pants flavor wise. The sauce is good if you like Carolina style BBQ sauce, which I do. I'd give the sauce 3 forks. The slaw was also quite good. I'd give it 2.5 forks but would add a bit more mayo and chop the cabbage next time.

I roasted the meat in my oven on a low temp. The flavor was great, but I would definitely use a less fatty cut of meat next time.

My son, who loves pulled pork, gave this a huge thumbs up. He said it was much better than a well-known Memphis eatery that I will not name. We used an electric smoker with the hickory chips. A great recipe for a crowd.

I made this recipe for a casual holiday dinner for 15, it was HUGE hit! I made 9 pounds of pork, used the crock pot with the mop as the cooking liquid (sans the sugar as suggested in another review). It was done in 6 hours on High, next time I will cook it longer on Medium/Low.

I tried this recipe after reading the reviews. It is a great recipe. I used a combination of the recipe and the suggestions listed by some of those who tried and loved the recipe. I purchased a 3# pork shoulder with the bone. Before seasoning, I made a slit to cut some of the meat away from the bone. After seasoning the meat with the dry rub as per the directions, I let it marinate over night in a ziplock bag. The next morning, I placed it in slow cooker with a modified version of the mop liquid. I used a sprinkle of salt, left out the oil and added 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke. It cooked for 4 hrs on high. The tender delicious meat fell away from the bone. I was able to make 5 hearty sandwiches. This is a great Saturday evening meal.

I could only find a Boston butt (6+ pounds)that was not boneless, but prepared with the rub and cooked whole in the mop in a crock pot for 12 hours. My family loved the sandwiches and had second servings. It was a nice change from turkey a couple of days after our Thanksgiving dinner!

Loved this. Also cooked it in the crock pot. Made sandwiches, Hawaiian rice bowls and tacos with the pork. All delicious!

I've made this dish many times and have developed some shortcuts to make the recipe even easier. I use the crockpot. 1. Mix rub ingredients, rub on meat and refrigerate over night. I do it right in my cropckpot dish or you can use a ziplock. 2. The next morning, add mop ingredients (without oil) to crockpot, 3. Cook meat all day or until shreds easily with fork. 4. Break into large pieces and skim some of the oil and remove fat chunks. 5. Shred, put on hamburg rolls, add your favorite sauce and enjoy! I don't add the extra salt into the mop, but that is personal preference. Definitely don't use the oil in the mop because Boston butt is very fatty. It's a very forgiving piece of meat and doesn't mind hanging around in the crockpot on low even when it is all cooked. We have great homegrown bottled sauces in South Carolina so I don't spend the extra time making the sauce.

this was amazing. I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 50 minutes using the mop as the liquid. The cole slaw on the sandwich was also so good. Will definately be making this again.

I have made this recipe twice for large groups of people. Huge hit. Easy to put in smoker. Must have the coleslaw and sauce. Even froze it for two weeks and was still delicious. Once I turned the smoker up to reach 190 and another time finished in the oven. Don't even eat until it has reached 190.

Delicious. We made it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. I would definitely omit the 1TB salt in the mop as another reviewer did. Recommend for 2nd day -Remove juices after cooking and cool in fridge or freezer in a separate dish until fat has hardened. Take fat off. Pour juices back over meat.

LOVED this recipe! We tried pulled pork for the first time while travelling in the U-S and wanted to make it at home. We don't have a smoker so cooked it overnight (8hrs) in a crockpot. We then removed the fat and bones (yes, we left the bones in), and let the meat cool. Then in the evening,we reheated it in the crockpot for 2 hrs. It was so rich and delicious! We felt the pepper called for in the recipe was just right - wouldn't change anything. Also, you must have the coleslaw with it!

Great recipe!!! And to the guy that gave it 3 forks, you shouldn't have even rated this recipe. You are one of the group I hate who doesn't follow the recipe and doesn't even have a BBQ and then has the audacity to rate the recipe according to your own interventions and then lowers the percentage for what I concider a great recipe. Please stop rating recipes in the future if you can't follow the recipe.

I made this in the slow cooker (wish I had a smoker, but alas..) the day before a small paty. I put an 8+ lb bone-in shouder roast (with the rub) and about 3/4 of the mop in the cooker for 8.5 hours on low. When the pork was done, I just shredded it up, skimmed off some of the fat that was with the liquid and put it all back in the cooker. I reheated it the next day on low for about 2 hours. Btw, I didn't use the salt called for in the mop because there was aleady two tablespoons in the rub. I thought any more would be too salty. I did, however, add just a dash of liquid smoke. The end result was perfectly seasoned and tender. And although the vinegar based bbq sauce is not for everyone, I couldn't get enough of it. Some of my other guests opted for regular old bottled bbq sauce. This easily fed 12 people.

My husband is a BBQ conoisseur (especially Carolina BBQ) and so the first time I made this I was nervous that he would like it. Let me tell you, he was impressed. He even said the Carolina Red BBQ Sauce was the best he'd ever had. The pork was so tender and it created a wonderful bark. I did the rub and wrapped in plastic wrap and left it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day I soaked apple, cherry and hickory chunks in water and then built my smoker. I have a Weber kettle barbecue and I piled charcoal on either side leaving an empty strip down the middle. Put on the wood, put the meat on, closed the air holes until they were almost closed and let 'er smoke. I truly believe if you're going to have authentic po' boys, you need to smoke this in a kettle with charcoal. Anyway, we made dirty rice, cornbread and fried green tomatoes and it was an absolute hit . . . even with my kids (ages 5 & 3). I highly recommend this recipe. It also works on all kinds of cuts, not just for pork sandwiches. We've used it on brisket, chicken, ribs, etc.

First of all...I made it in the oven instead of grilling it...Anyway...The recipe was a big hit. I made it for about 20 people on a Sunday night football party. The BEST Sandwiches of all time. The meat was tender as soft butter the aroma of the dry rub and the pork shoulder was smelling sooo good. I left it in the oven for about 8 hours at 230°F.

This recipe calls for cutting the butt/shoulder in half before cooking. This will cut down on the cooking time, but, when you cut the cooking time you are also reducing the smoking time. Slow, low-heat smoking is what makes the pork tender and delicious. I would suggest leaving the butt whole and smoking 12-14 hours at 225-250. Do not pull the pork out of the smoker until the internal temp reaches at least 190. 165 is ok for sliced pork, but 190 is the minimum for pulled pork. If you are going to use a rub, do not turn the meat until half way through cooking time (6 hours). This gives the rub a chance to set and form a bark. During the last 6 hours, mop or spray with the mop sauce every 30 minutes, turning the butt once an hour. I would use chunks of wood instead of chips, and throw on a couple of chunks of apple wood with the hickory. Only use smoke for the first 4 hours to prevent over smoking. Let the meat stand for 30 minutes before pulling off of the bone. Google "Paul Kirk" to find expert advice on all things BBQ.

Did a dry run before serving at a party that will include a chef - no pressure ;-) Anyhow it was delicious, the sauce was a bit too tart for this Yankee, but more brown sugar fixed it. I used my crock pot and added liquid smoke - cooked all day. I know this is silly, but next time I will set up the crockpot outside or in the garage, because it filled my house with a "wet dog" smell.

This is fabulous!! I'm making it for my annual July 4th party and had a trial run last weekend. Exactly as written, it is so delicious. I made it on my smoker and can't imagine making it any other way. Only problem is that it took about 12 hours to cook. I started it at 9 a.m. and 7, my husband was ready to kill me - he couldn't wait any longer. I two-forked it around the edges and popped the rest of it in the oven for about an hour more. One of the best recipes I have ever made!!!

My husband and I make this every year for our friends and family. It is always a hit and in fact, one of our girlfriends has asked that we make it for her wedding reception. I lived in North Carolina for 5 years and was really craving it. Couldn't have found a better recipe to replicate it. ALWAYS make it with the sauce and coleslaw. That's the way we eat it in the South. I also use apple chips from our tree to give it a better smokey flavor and always use a charcoal smoker/grill.

All of the "crock pot method" reviews were right on - it's really, really wonderful - spicy and vinegar-y. I put the mop sauce in the pot with the raw meat, cooked for 7 hours on low, then discarded the mop, pulled the meat and put it back in the crock pot with the sauce until dinner. I'm sure it's even a thousand times better when smoked -I might have to get a smoker just to try this recipe again!

This was outstanding & so easy. My kids LOVED it, too. Prepared in crock pot since I don't have a smoker. Also reduced pepper to 1 tbsp. Put mop sauce in crock pot then meat on top. Cooked on low for 8 hrs, removed mop sauce, shredded meat & added BBQ sauce. Wished I would have saved some of the mop sauce to add with the BBQ sauce for additional flavor. Pork butt is easy to work with -- just trim as much fat before putting on rub & once it's cooked, very easy to remove additional fat. Pork butt also very inexpensive (my 5 lb roast cost $6!) You won't be disappointed! Great BBQ recipe for cold months.

Wow! We loved all three recipes. Highly recommended. We cooked fresh hams (butcher had already trimmed all Boston Butts) and it made no difference to the end product. I cooked 9.5 pounds in my slow cooker for 12 hours on low, added the mop as another cook suggested but did not add liquid smoke. Next time I will try in my electric smoker when I have more time. The barbecue sauce and Coleslaw recipes were just as good. If these recipes look interesting to you go ahead and make them. You'll be very pleased.

Every time there is a big eating event or cookout, my friends ask me to make this. I love it just as it is. I apply the dry rub and let it sit for 24 hours. Then, I cook it in my slow cooker on low with the mop for 8 hours. I added 3 tsp. of liquid smoke to give it that hickory smoked flavor. I just shredded it this morning and it is perfect. Now it's sitting in the BBQ sauce and should be nice and flavourful for tonight.

If you want to learn how to make some good Carolina-style barbecue, then this is a great recipe to start with. Whatever you do with it, make sure you reduce the amount of black pepper in the rub to *1* Tablespoon. If you do that, then the results should be wonderful... provided you do not mind the vinegar-based sauces that characterize Carolina Barbecue. I have also used this rub and mop on chicken that I barbecued on the grill and served with the tangy barbecue sauce. Let me tell you, that was a tremendous success that I plan to repeat again.

In a word: unimpressive. The meat was very tender and the rub was tasty - but both the mop and bbq sauce were a major buzzkill. There are much better pulled pork recipes out ther.

There should be, in my opinion, a "whoa" in this recipe. Admitedly, the peppercorns I used were brand new, and therefore possibly stronger--BUT for us the pepper needs to be cut by at least half next time.

I realize there are alot of opinions here on this one recipe: Here's mine: I did not use a bbq, smoker, or slow cooker as suggested but put a 3 pound boneless roast (less fat) in the oven with a cooking bag with the rub along with the mop, in a slow oven (225) for 4 1/2 hours. I turned off the oven and let it sit there to cool. As suggested, I used less pepper but still found it to be way to peppery, though it was perhaps due to using whole pepper and then crushing at the time of making the rub. I think for the next time, I will make the effort to stick to the rules and use a smoker. This recipe, pepared this way, was good, but I can definitely see why I should stick to rules. My mouth is watering with anticipation. Which ever method one chooses to use, this is a great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I let it sit overnight with the spices and herbs (covered in fridge) and let it cook for 8 hours in slow cooker with just water. Then I added my own bbq sauce and cut up some potatoes and cooked for another 2 hours. Served up with coleslaw. Delicious!

Made this several times, in a homemade smoker (modified weber). Amazing. Have to smoke it for at least 10 hours, but this has never failed to get unanimous praise from guests. Now and then we throw a whole chicken in for the last few hours, and it's amazing too. We stick to the recipe pretty exactly, by the way.

I used to live in Salem, NC and this recipe is legit! If you'd rather have Texas or K.C. BBQ, make ribs or brisket instead and use a sauce from the grocery store. The sauce is indeed thin and vinigary, but with the slaw and pork it's perfect. I made this for the first time 2 weeks ago and have already made up an occasion to make it again. The best thing is that the leftovers are even better the next day.

I read the reviews, many thanks to all who supplied advice, and this was a big hit. I made it in the crockpot for 10 hours with most of the mop and took it to the UofM tailgate the next day.

I'm not sure i like my new nickname of the pork lady, but i have no doubt i'll be invited back!

INCREDIBLE recipe!! I was weary because most pulled-pork recipes I've made in the past had a tomato-based mop and slow cooked with onions and garlic. This recipe seemed so basic but it worked! I made it in the oven in a cast iron dutch oven, started it at 400 degrees for 30 mins. then reduced to 250 for the next 6 hours. I followed the reviewers info. that said the internal temp. had to reach 185 in order for the pork to 'pull' apart...they were right. BEST pulled pork I've ever had. OH, we used a more traditional BBQ sauce on the sandwiches, the Carolina Red Sauce was good mixed in with the pork, but just a little too vinegary to use too much of it.

This recipe is incredible! It may seem like a lot of time invested but is well worth it. I will make this a staple in my tailgating this fall. I cooked the pork in a slow cooker all day, about 6-8 hours. Just fell apart as I removed it from the cooker. You must give this a try!

I made this July 4th for a small group and it was a big hit! The rub and the red sauce were fab.

This stuff is so good it could put a Souther Church BBQ fundraiser out of business any day! I used a gas grill and put a tin foil pouch full of the soaked hickory chips on the back part of the grill where I set the fire to medium-low heat. I left the front burners off and placed the pork on this section of the grill. This creates a smoker effect. Eight hours later I had the best BBQ!

classic Southern barbque! I don't find that you need the mop. Especially if you make the sauce right. This is the way many of us do it in North Carolina.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I avoided the mop and substituted commercial barbeque sauce. Considering the climate (January in New York), I chose to cook the pork in my oven (180 to 200 degrees, tightly sealed with foil, on a rack, for eight to ten hours). What a meal! Even children who swore they would not eat pork went back for seconds. Have made this since for many neighbors and friends and it has become a family favorite.

As a long time barbecuer, this is the real deal. Several reviewers made this in a slow cooker/crockpot. Sorry, that is not barbecue. You owe it to yourself to do it in a smoker! Use a Weber grill with the charcoal banked to one side if you don't have a smoker. You can also be creative with the mop, barbbecue sauce and the rub if you want. You will want to get the meat temp to 170 to 190 degrees. Enjoy.

This is Lexington NC Q at its finest. Works best with Boston Butt on a smoker, cooked at a very low temp for a very long time. Serve with sweet tea, coca-cola, or beer. We also use the red sauce on chicken and other things at the table. In Lex, they call this a 'finishing sauce' or a 'dip'. When I grill chicken or pork chops, we put the red sauce on the table as a 'dip'. Amazing stuff. I'm not even a vinegar fan, but I use this sauce regularly. I even keep some in the fridge at work!

We thought this was excellent. My brother has made it for years on a grill. We made it in a crockpot and it worked out great (although we would like to try it on a grill). We didn't particuarly like the vinegar based bbq sauce on the sammis - but it was excellent in the coleslaw. So we used the tried and true Fanny Farmer bbq sauce instead. We also used boneless pork spareribs b/c we couldn't find boston butt at Costco the day we went. but YUM!! YUM!! this will be a standard.

Well, I put the rub on yesterday. I think that was fine. It was the mop that killed it. I don't understand how everyone rated this so high. I felt like I was eating vinegar. Not to mention it made my house stink. I even lowered the amount of vinegar called for. If it wasn't for the vinegar this probably would have been a good sandwich. I too cooked it in a crock. The meat just fell apart. What a shame and waste of time.

This is a great recipe. If you can lower heat to 180-200 degrees try to do it. Use dry heat, avoid slow cookers, and cook 8-12 hours. Lump charcoal will burn too hot use briquettes. This is a great recipe for guys to sit around, cook and drink beer. Apple wood is better then hickory, avoid chips look for chunks or whole pieces. When finished pork should fall into shreds chop meat with a cleaver to finish. VERY IMPORTANT Try to find an untrimmed shoulder, if you can't tell your butcher you want what he/she gets from the packer and not to trim, the fat cooks off. Enjoy, this is the best picnic/BBQ recipe you can serve. A good IPA, Saranac or Seria Nevada, or spicy Red Zen is perfect.

Made this in my big crockpot, using a 9-pound bone-in picnic roast.

I made this in a slow cooker. I did the rub the night before per the instructions but just added the "mop" to the crock pot all at once. I cooked (3) 2-3 LB boneless pork roasts on low for about 12 to 13 hours. We did turn it to high for about an hour or so in the middle of the day. It turned out wonderfully! Extremely moist and just fell apart. It had nice kick to it. The accompanying sauce was great as well - thin and vinegary. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

OH MY GOD! I made this last night, in a slow cooker. Now, i realize that a smoker would be better but i don't have one. This recipe, however, is bound to change that. I have to get one. If this came out spectacular in a slow cooker, I can only imagine what it tastes like in a smoker. Like others, I would cut the salt and pepper if you are using a slow cooker since the flavors are bound to saturate more than if it's cooked in a smoker with only mopping. In any case, this is orgasmically delicious, you can't lose.

Run, do not walk to make this recipe!!!! But, allow time! ;-) I have to say that of all the complicated recipes I have ever attempted, this is one of the easiest, tastiest, and most impressive! I do not have a smoker, and thanks to other reviewers cooked my pork shoulder for 8 hours in the crock pot. Absolutly no problem in getting the meat to shred (I used two forks to pull the meat). Cannot wait to make it with a 5.5 pound butt, for my friends, anticipating all the praise. I did follow the recipe, adding some liquid smoke to get the smokey flavor. For my BBQ sauce, I used a family texas style BBQ sauce that is thin with lots of vinegar. I highly recommend letting the rub marinate the meat for 24 hours. has anybody tried this recipe with chicken or beef??? I am interested in trying it!

Just out of curiosity I looked over this recipe and wasn't surprised to to see the number of rave reviews. I fix lots of Q and this looks like a very good, basic recipe. However, what folks need to realize is that getting a pullable butt is not about a set time on the smoker (e.g. 6hrs); it's about reaching an internal temperature of the meat when the fat and connective tissue will liquify, making the meat "pullable." All butts different, so time is only part of the BBQ equation. This recipe calls for cooking to an internal temperature of 165, but that's too low. A butt generally takes about 70 minutes a pound at a consistent rack temp. of 230-235. The pork butt should come out of the pit when it is "fork tender." The following are approximate internal temps: Sliceable pork roast, take it out at 180F. Sliceable and pullable roast, take it out at 185F. Easily pullable roast, take it out at 190F. Smoking times will vary depending on how closely you maintain a good steady fire, how often you open your pit to take a peek, and the natural tenderness of the meat in the raw state. These times are approximate and will most likely vary every time you barbecue. If after 6 hours or so the internal temps on your butts do not read 185, you can take them off the pit, double-wrap in heavy foil and put on a gas grill or oven on low (250-300 deg.), insert a digital cooking thermometer, and wait for them to come up to the temperature you want. Let cool, then pull. You won't be disappointed.

As a displaced Southerner who now lives in the Northwest, I was searching to duplicate the NC barbecue I grew up with. This recipe comes pretty close, but I would cut back on the salt next time, use a little less ketchup in the sauce. Making this is a great excuse kick back and hang around the grill all day. Have fun!

Like another reviewer, the pork would not shred and I plan to put it in a food processor. I followed the rub recipe to the letter and let it rest overnight before my friend smoked the pork (8 hrs) to l65 internal degrees. I used two 6 lb boston butts. If there is a next time to make this recipe, I'll cook it in the oven and use Jack Daniels sauce.

This is absolutely fantastic bbq! I've probably smoked over a hundred pounds of pork since coming across this recipe a few years ago-it is that good. I use the rub and mop for ribs, too. It can be tedious to tend to the grill for 6 hours, but the end result is worth it. You sure can't beat an icy mint julep to enjoy while barbecuing!

I made this over the weekend after having made it once before 2 years ago. My husband simply loves this recipe - he calls it a "10 out of 10." I think it's very good, but I'm not as big of a "smoke flavor" fan as he is. Anyway, I made exactly as written, with the exception of converting my Weber kettle into a smoker (using a chimney) as directed in another recipe (pork sandwiches w/ coleslaw). Thank you to the person who reviewed this recipe and made mention of the instructions in the other recipe. My only problem was that the meat was not "tender" when I took off the grill after 6 hours. It did not "shred." Rather, I had to break it into small bite size pieces. Since it didn't look like pulled pork, I let it cool and ran it through my food processor and it turned out perfect (ie., like the picture). We ate some on Saturday night, but I decided to add some barbecue sauce to the leftover pulled pork and let sit overnight. On Sunday, we had seconds and it was so good. So much more moist than the first night, probably because of the barbecue sauce. Finally, we preferred the sauce a bit sweeter so I added more brown suger/ketchup to the barbecue sauce (sorry to you N.Carolinans!). The coleslaw is a must -- compliments the somewhat spicy pork perfectly. Overally, a fabulous recipe when you have the time. Heck, make the time...life is short! Bon Appetite from Alaska!

This is absolutely the best bar-b-que I have ever eaten. My husband DOES NOT eat left-overs but he ate this bar-b-que for several days and has been begging for it all winter. Now it is warm enough to smoke outdoors again so I am sure we will be having it alot.

This is the best pulled pork reciepe that I've ever made.I changed some of the ingredients (I use as little salt as possible)I cooked it in the oven in a clay pot for 6 hrs.I didn't have to pull it, it was so tender it fell apart.

My family love this one!!! I made it several times last summer and they are already asking when the next BBQ is? {it's only the middle of Febuary}I was very pleases with all of the barbecue recipes in that July 99' issue "AMERICAN BARBECUE". Thanks BON APPETIT.

We used the crock pot method someone suggested - it was wonderful! Next time we'll cut back on the ground pepper and maybe increase the sweetness a bit. The flavors blend so much in the crock pot that the pepper really comes through.

I used an old electric wok to smoke the pork. Tender beyond anything I have ever seen! Smoking is a MUST to get the authentic flavor. Wonderful smokey taste and you HAVE to make the carolina red bbq sauce to go with this. Fantastic recipe!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe, although we made it in a crock pot. We doctored up the mop sauce a little by adding dark brown sugar, to taste [we liked it a bit sweeter.], shot of prepared mustard [which gave it more tang]. Next time, we would decrease the salt a bit. We used a lean pork loin because we don't like a lot of fat and it still turned out delicious!!! The pork was so tender and very easy to shred. It practically shredded apart by itself as we lifted it out of the crock pot! This is a MUST TRY recipe!

Oh my, what flavor, excellent! Melted cheese on the bun, topped with little slaw (the chrunch is good in the sandwich) and served with homemade salsa and slaw. Too good!

I've prepared this dish twice now in one month for two parties. Unfortunately I've had to use my Weber gas grill rather than a smoker but the pork still does come out yummy. The dry rub and mop is an essential to make this work.

I made this back in June and my family is still talking about how good it was. I'd make it again soon, except for the time involved. I took Friday off from work, started the grill at 9:30am, and put the finished product in the fridge around 8pm. A lot of work but it was appreciated by everyone who ate it. It was great and easy the next day though!

Although its against that laws of BBQ, I made it in the crockpot, like suggested prior. Cooked with Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce. People were eating it as I was shredding it. Only had enough left overs for like three more sandwiches. Definate Keeper!

What a glorious way to celebrate the 4th of July! We used a six pound boneless Boston butt and followed the recipe to the letter. We rested the pork overnight with the rub and started bright and early the morning of the 4th. The mop was a very pleasant addition to the moisture and texture of the meat. I'd cook this one for the Pope if he'd drop by!!!

I've made this recipe twice now, the first time for Super bowl party and the second time for my father-in-laws birthday. Everyone loves this and there are never any leftovers. I used a Jack Daniels B-que sauce instead of theirs. I always do some with just the mop and some with B-que sauce.

We have made this several times and it just keeps getting better and better. My husband uses a thermometer inserted into the meat so we can monitor the temp, and have only cooked it in a smoker. Perfect every time.

AWESOME!! I made this with some variations and could not believe how delicious this turned out. First of all, I live in New York City and don't have a smoker, so, I used my crock pot. I made no changes to the rub, it's excellent. I used a pork shoulder (bone in) and let it sit with the rub in the frig for a couple of hours. Then made the mop, but added two tablespoons of liquid smoke. Added the pork into the crock pot and added 3/4 of mop and cooked for 8 hours on low. (add rest of mop if needed). Removed the meat and let cool for about 30 minutes. Then easily shredded w/ two forks. Pour about 1/2 to 1 cup of juices in crockpot over meat. For sauce, I used 3/4 apple cider vineager, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup good BBQ sauce, 1 splash of liquid smoke, and a couple of chopped chilpotle peppers (add more for more heat). I went ahead and heated the sauce and then poured over meat, and mix. Absolutely divine! My guests said it was the best BBQ they had ever had.

This recipe was originally in a Bon Appetit issue just before Super Bowl in 1993 or 94. We made it in the oven (the directions at the time) and had nothing but raves for it. I have searched high and low for it and am so please to have found it again. It is fantastic!!!!!

This recipe is so wonderful that I just added it to my on-line recipe box. The only draw back is that the neighbors want to know what you are smoking, and then you have to invite them to dinner. It is like giving a muffin to a moose.

I, a northerner, made this for a room full of southerners and they could't stop praising the pork. (That is when they didn't have food in their mouths...) A true keeper. Made one pork butt in the oven and one in the smoker and agree that there is a major difference between the two. If time allows, go with the smoker; however, the oven works quite well. Don't forget to make the coleslaw and bbq sauce to complete this southern gem. This is "good eats!"

I orginially found this recipe in Bon Apetit, made it according to the recipe. To echo another cooks description, was the best thing I have ever eaten. I've since made it several times with each time being incredible.

This was one of the best things I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly and it received rave reviews from everyone. For those of you (like myself) who don't know how to turn your Weber charcoal grill into a smoker, another recipe on this site -"Pork Barbecue Sandwiches with Coleslaw"- has clear, detailed instructions. I made a different coleslaw: cabbage, carrots, apples, a little onion, and for the sauce 1/2 mayo. 1/2 yogurt, a little Dijon mustard, and a little sugar. One more thing, I had a piece of pork that wouldn't fit on the grill so I baked it instead. There is no comparison between the tastes. The baked one was not nearly as scrumptious.

I have made this sandwich several times for family and friends along with the coleslaw that is recommended and they all rave about how great it is.I vary it by using my crockpot instead of the outside grill. It makes it easier and it still tastes great.

I've now made this three times. I tried it with a loin I bought at Costco. The meat is too lean, don't try it. Use the Butt with as much fat as possible, it will cook off. I have a $30.00 "H2O" smoker, nothing fancy, the slow cooking is important, use a smoker. Also, I use a combination of cheap beer and orange juice concentrate as the liquid in the smoker.

I did this in the oven as a Sunday ham. My guests and myself were blown away. I wish I had a smoker to do the recipe justice. 350 degrees for 4 hours, basting every 45 min to an hour made the ham deliciously tender and succulent.

This recipe is worth the work. I did about 9 shoulders so I started it in the oven and finished on the grill. It is the best with all the componets with it YUMMY.

This is the second time I made this particular recipe, the first time was in the oven. This last time, i tried it in the smoker. What a difference. If you loved this dish in the oven, do it in the smoker! You won't regret it! I took the leftovers into work and received raves from all of the southern natives who have relocated here. I was passing out the recipe as fast as I could print it! Thanks, epicurious!!

I was concerned about the amount of pepper in the rub, so I rubbed one piece of meat lightly and the other heavily. Go with the heavy rub... the more the better! In Steven Raichlen's Barbecue Bible he suggests cooking to an internal temperature of 195. Next time I'll try the higher temperature, as he says the meat will more readily fall apart.

This issue of Bon Appetit is what made us go out and buy a smoker. After a year I finally got to test it out at our Memorial Day BBQ. This recipe was an absolute hit!! I did go back to an older issue and used the BBQ sauce recipe from "Pork Barbeque Sandwiches with Coleslaw" (Bon Appetit July 1995). I am not always a fan of BBQ because it tends to be very vinegary. The July '95 recipe uses more brown sugar making it perfect! Make sure you make the coleslaw. I thought it would be overkill with the bbq sauce but once again...perfect. The coleslaw this way was even good enough on its own.

We made this recipe with our new smoker, and I can echo all the previous comments. This was an incredible dish. We didn't even make the coleslaw the first time, and people couldn't stop raving! The smell of smoke didn't leave our condo for a week, but we'll make this recipe again and again!

This was the best pulled pork I've had since I left the south. I cooked mine in the oven and it was so tender I didn't have to pull much. It fell apart. The barbecue sauce and cole slaw are absolutely musts with the meat. I made 2 recipes of the sauce and used some of it on the meat and then had some for individual use. I made everything the night before so the day of my party all I had to do was reheat the meat and sit back and gather the compliments! An absolute keeper. No questions asked.

I did the whole deal -- including the tangy coleslaw. I used savoy cabbage. It was super-delicious and worth all of the effort. I turned my Weber grill into a smoker with a pan of water under the meat and hickory chunks. I used the indirect heat method (two burners on low and the center burner off.) It took about 7-8 hours. My only complaint is we couldn't stop eating!!

I made this in the oven. I cooked it for about 10 hours at 350 and put the "mop" on about every 45 to 60 minutes. Everyone loved it! It is great to make a day ahead and simply reheat when guests arrive.

It was the centrepiece of a going-away party for a couple of gourmands. Big, big hit. The sauce is amazing. I followed the directions to convert my propane barbecue into a smoker and it all worked wonderfully. I can't wait to make it again, despite the time and effort. It's worth it.

I use a smoker and smoke the meat for about 12 hrs. Then I put it and the mop in cook-in bags in a 250 degree oven for 3 hrs. It comes out great and takes less fuss. I freeze it with a little mop. I have never used the BBQ sauce.

A friend served the sandwiches with the coleslaw and sauce for 4th of July and I have made the recipe twice since to rave reviews. However, instead of smoking the pork on the BBQ, I cook the meat in the oven at the same temp. for 6-8hrs until tender and shreds easily.

Have made this three times now for a summer bbq and it is a big hit. Pork can be made the day before, just be sure to "pull" (shred) it before placing in the refrigerator. Reheat next day in some of the bbq sauce and serve.

I received the July edition just in time because I received a smoker for my birthday and this recipe was all I needed to fire that baby up. Just the time basting and watching it cook to perfection was all I needed to entice my neighbors to come and take a glance at what I was doing to make the block smell sooo good. After pulling the pork, I mixed the barbecue sauce with it before serving (not to a soggy consistancy, but just where it soaks in) and served the rest on the side. Have yet to make the coleslaw. Very tasty!
