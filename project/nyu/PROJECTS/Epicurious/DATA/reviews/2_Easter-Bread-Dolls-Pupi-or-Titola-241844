I would love to try this with my daughters but I can't make much sense of the instructions. I'm going to Google it instead. Ditto the photo request, that would help a lot.

This recipe looks way too hard.. Easter dolls are tradition.. I use flour, eggs( save a couple of whites).. salt, baking pwdr, oil..If dough is too dry add some milk.. bake and use dyed eggs for the heads of each doll. you can make twists, rounds, weaths, or dolls. Bake..Mix pwdred sugar, vanilla, and egg whites for frosting. add sprinkles in Easter colors.. Non vi e!
