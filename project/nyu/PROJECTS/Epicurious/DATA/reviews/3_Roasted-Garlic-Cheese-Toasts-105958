This was wonderful. I don't get how you could give it a bad review. I do think using shredded versus grated cheese is important. This will become a regular for me.

I've made this recipe more than a few times and everyone loves it. Critics of this recipe must not like garlic, it's delicious

Where are these women's husbands?! Rosemary instead of thyme is key as has been stated before. It's glorified garlic bread and not that spectacular at that.

I substituted rosemary for the thyme and thought it tasted much better.

A very good recipe. I liked the spread uncooked as well as cooked. For those that didn't care for it I would ask them to give it another try. This is an easy standard for anyone recipe box. I didn't care for the combination of this dish and the fennel mussels in cream sauce that was recomened, but individually they were great.

I omitted the thyme and used rosemary instead. Tossed the leftover spread with shrimp and used it to stuff avocado halves, which was better than the original idea.

This was a waste of garlic- I agree with Sue, this had a strange and unpleasant taste to it. It was too crunchy and weird tasting.

I made this for a bridal shower I hosted - it was a great prepare-ahead thing and EVERYBODY raved and asked for the recipie. Very well received - in fact, I am making it for Christmas Eve also.

These toasts are excellent! I made them as a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone loved them. They are even good several days later.

This looked like a recipe I would love - a combination of all my favorite foods, but sorry, I did not care for this at all. I threw most of it out. For some reason the combination of the roasted garlic with the other ingredients gave this a strange unpleasant taste.
