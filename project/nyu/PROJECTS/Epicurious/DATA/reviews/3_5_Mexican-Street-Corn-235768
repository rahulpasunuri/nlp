Awesome...Three stars because I used parmesan...Also, serve this in tin foil so the person can open it, theres a huge difference.

Very easy tasty recipe. I use parmesan cheese instead of feta.

The flavor is fabulous! What I do is combine the Mayo with the lime juice and cayenne, spread it on the hot corm then roll in the cheese.

I don't know the authenticity of this item, but it was certainly delicious. We used Mexican crema and Cotija cheese. We actually sliced the grilled corn off of the cob (for the sake of the mess) and mixed it in with the crema and cheese. It was absolutely delicious! Regardless of how "authentic" it really is, it tastes wonderful!

I understand if you are a purist, yes, it is not authentic Mexican street corn. However, it is absolutely delicious and your guests will love it. We use mayo, finely grated fresh parmesan and cayenne and it is always a hit. Messy, but a hit!

Love it. I used Mayo to make the cheese adhere to the corn. To keep this from being too messy I cut the corn in half and used heavy wooden skewers. This also helps roll the corn in the cheese. I will make this again - Great change of pace from regular corn on the cob.

you can also use parmesan cheese, and chili powder instead. i first spread butter on the corn, then the mayo, followd by a sprinkling of parmesan cheese and finally the chili powder on top. it's very good! you can also first shave off the corn kernels and put them into a cup before you add all the ingredients, because it does get pretty messy to eat.

i gave it 1 fork because I couldn't give it less. Take it from a true mexican, this recipe has NOTHING to do with the real thing. First pf all, you have to use white corn, not the sweet kind, it's mayo, not cream, feta cheese??? NEVER!!!! and it's not cayenne pepper, it's chili powder.
