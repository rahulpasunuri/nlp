Couldn't find creamed pearl onion, so had to buy frozen pearl onions and make them from scratch. Quite a bit of work, but the end result was really tasty with the "no nightmare" Beef wellington

Had this recipe at a friend's house last night and it was a perfect accompaniement to your Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce. She added some extra chives.
