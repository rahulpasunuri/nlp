Great recipe! But I also halved the salt and found that to be plenty. What's more, had a bit of a fortuitous brain fart and sprinkled cumin seeds on top instead of sesame seeds. Delicious! So the second time I made it, I added a tablespoon of cumin to the dough, and it was suberb.

bread turned out very good.... I added 1 teaspoon of salt in lieu of the specified 2. This tasted brilliant... I think too much salt will spoil it...!! Two thirds the way through the baking process I sprinkled about 1/2 tspn of sesame on top of the loaf, tapped them down to stick... that gave a very nice look to the finished product....

I thought these were awesome! Very hearty tasting with the whole wheat flour, oats and sesame seeds; but not heavy. The sesame seeds gave the loaves a nice slightly crunchy texture. I've made them three times and will make them again and again. Good if you like that wholesome flavour.

This was not the best recipe that I have made. To salty for me.
