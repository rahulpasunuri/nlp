This is truly a simple and elegant risotto. Like other reviewers, I substituted additional broth for water. The onion and fennel mixture do make this dish so creamy and flavorful that you can easily ignore the desire to add grated cheese. In fact, I may try this as a vegan dish substituting vegetable for chicken broth and using oven roasted artichoke hearts instead of the shrimp.

Delicious and simple recipe. As there's no mention in the recipe, it's definitely worth considering that this a much healthier than usual risotto in that it doesn't utilise cream or cheese which are often required in cringe-worthy quantities for other risottos. Somehow, the absence of cheese or cream is hardly noticeable (is it the fennel fooling us?), this recipe tastes rich, creamy and hearty but without the guilt or heavy stomach many associate with risotto. Adjustments: *used around double white wine as I thought 1/4 cup was a bit light. *Of the 4 cups of liquid, we used 2 cups chicken stock, 0.75 cups vegetable stock and 1.25 cups water. The finished product was delicious and was not overly stock flavoured, I would recommend this stock ratio.

Delicious. Only had long grain rice, but still tasted great. I added some grated Asiago cheese at the end.

i loved this dish! risotto can be a bit bland if you don't load it up with cheese, but this was excellent. the fennel flavor was subtle but still there and the shrimp were a great texture highlight. i added lemon juice and parmesan.

Very nice! I took some of the suggestions and used half water, half chicken broth. I did mine in my pressure cooker - sauteed the onions & fennel, added the rice, added the wine and some lemon zest, then 1 c water & 1 c broth under one ring pressure for 7 minutes. At the end with the pot open I stirred in a 1/2 lb tiny Maine shrimp and a bit of cream. Very different and satisfying!

very good - will make again. I made a few minor changes... I added a touch of light cream at the end of the cooking. I also cooked the shrimp separately - I'm not a big fan of "fishy" leftovers so I placed the shrimp on top of the risotto on each plate along with some fresh grated parm cheese. Delicious.

This was amazingly delicious! Ok, I DID make a few changes (in spite of the fact that I ususally don't like people who do so then "review" the recipe here). I too thought water wouldn't be flavorful enough so I used half veg broth and half low-fat/low-sod chicken broth and it was great; would do again. I too wondered about how risotto could be without parmesan but in fact it didn't need it. The only thing I did really differently was to add a couple of star anise pods to the broth as it simmered to add an extra hint of anise flavor that I thought might complement the fennell (and I happen to looove star anise) and it was fantastic. Adds a really nice slightly unexpected yet subtle taste, and I would recommend this to those of you who thought this "lacked something".... you can get it easily at asian grocery stores.

The first time I made this I used all chicken broth as some reviewers suggested. Yuck. It tasted like chicken broth risotto (I did use Swanson's, which is strong). Second time around I made the recipe as is, and it was wonderful. A very mild flavor. I'll add more fennel next time.

This is a wondeful dish. I love the fennel and do not find it compliments the shrimp wonderfully. a great company dish or just plain comfor food.

WATER in risotto? Please! I used all homemade chicken broth..added the wine first and basically just used the recipe to make a different risotto than I normally make. Risotto with canned broth? Never.

Made this dish for dinner with friends and it was excellent!! Flavors are delicate but robust. I highly recommend this dish.

This is going to be my third time making this recipe - it's really easy and tastes delicious! The only modifications I'm making is to substitute seared sea scallops on top instead of the shrimp and to add in shaved pieces of parmesan when serving. Otherwise - this is great, easy, and delicious!

This had good flavor--I took the advice of earlier reviewers and used all broth for the liquid and added the juice of a lemon. Yum!

The second time I used this recipe I substituted low fat/low sodium chicken broth for the water and found this recipe had more flavor. Now I would give it three forks.

We thought this was very good, however, next time I will add something to give it more flavor, maybe lemon or even some red pepper flakes.

This was the first time I've had (and made) risotto with no Parmesan cheese. It was a tough switch, but in the end the combination of ingredients won me over. What a great month it was published in too--it was a nice combination of comfort and luxury food for that dreary time of year.

this sounded like a great recipe but when i made it strictly following instruction, i found it lacking somehow. next time i will add some lemon juice or pernod and see how that turns out.
