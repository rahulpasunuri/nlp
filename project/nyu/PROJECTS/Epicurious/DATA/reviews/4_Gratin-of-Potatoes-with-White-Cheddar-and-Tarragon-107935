Made a couple of changes. Used baking potatoes and added a few sauted mushrooms. Was great and looked good too.

Oh and with all gratins I make, I heat up the liquid and than pour over and bake. Makes baking time more reliable.

I have made this many times tweaking the amount of cheese and tarragon. Have determined that 11 to 14 oz. of cheese is great and 5 teaspoons of fresh tarragon was perfect!

Rating: 4
This is a PS to my earlier review.... I too lowered the temperature of the oven (to 350) so the cheese would not "seize". In addition, I prefer to use a russet type potato, as yukon gold potatoes are waxy and do not have enough starch to contribute to thickening the sauce. Yes, cream is a thickener, but on a 1:1 ratio with wine, it takes quite a while to cook down enough to thicken the sauce.

Using this recipe as inspiration for a side dish to Easter ham, I changed the recipe a bit and came up with an all time favorite potato casserole recipe. First I substituted thyme for the tarragon, which we prefer. I used orange cheddar, instead of white (which we had available and which turned the gratin a beautiful golden brown) and I added a scant layer of chopped green onions and crumbled bacon between the potatoes. (which gave the dish color and made it more interesting) The aroma while cooking was heavenly. I was amazed by how the wine perfumed the dish (and the apartment) and created a smooth and creamy white wine cheese sauce. (I admit, I was a bit skeptical about how wine might affect the taste of the potatoes.) For the last 4 years I keep getting requests to make "those potatoes", and have even heard them described as being "outrageous". Even though I did not make the dish with tarragon and added a few ingredients of my own, I am giving it 4 stars for the wonderful combination of cream, wine, and cheddar.

With the exception of using fresh tarragon I made the recipe exactly as directed and was underwhelmed. They were very watery with little gobs of cheese curds. I was hoping for something rich and creamy. They were barely touched at the table.

Loved! Used 3 teaspoons fresh tarragon. Increased the cheese to 11 oz. I also warmed the cream and wine with the cheese and tarragon and poured over potatoes. Easier than layering. Awesome recipe. Oh, started at 375 degrees and increased to finish. Baked an hour and 10 minute......

Forgot to say that I scrubbed the potatoes very well, but I didn't actually peel them. It was still a very pretty gratin... just a little more on the rustic side.

This is a delicious change from regular gratin potatoes. I did find that it took a little bit longer to cook than the recipe allowed--about 10 minutes longer--but then again, my new oven may be a little bit off. I was a little heavy-handed with the spices, especially the tarragon (I used fresh from the garden) and my guests were very disappointed when it was gone.

Fantastic. Very rich though, so will only make sparingly. Added shallots softened in a nonstick frying pan.

Drop whatever you're doing and make this recipe. I was looking for something to use up a bag of baby red potatoes that were about to go soft and sprout, and this is what I found. Something in the additions of wine and tarragon make this smell almost sweet while baking, and it tastes wonderful on a crisp fall day. I used fresh tarragon and a little less salt and added a half hour of baking time.

I think 400 degrees was too hot for the oven. The cream was really boiling in there -- which often leads to the cream breaking down -- so i reduced to 350 degrees and cooked 90 mins. Turned out lovely.

I first made this for my boyfriend's 27th birthday dinner. I, too, added shallots, and he loved it so much that he ate the leftovers for a meal by themselves... This dish is definitely one of our favorites, and incredibly simple to make. It also seems that if its allowed to get rather brown on top, its even better...

Made this for easter dinner and it was a hit. Used a nice sharp Irish cheddar and added a shallots. Will surely make again, the hardest part was not digging in before dinner.

As suggested by other reviewers, used fresh tarragon, cut back the salt and combined heavy cream and half&half. It needed longer cooking time but the end result was "worth the calories"!!

Rich and delicious. You can taste every drop of the cream. Worthy of a special occasion or company.

I've made this many times. I sometimes change around cheeses, such as making part cheddar, part gueyere. I also add thinly sliced yellow onion to the top layer for an almost crunchy top texture. I've also substituted herbs provecal for the tarragon, but still use the same portions. This is a nice change if you don't care for tarragon. Sprinkle with Locatelli at serving time.

Rating: 3
Tarragon added a nice, unique twist to an old standard. As suggested previously, I used 5 tsp of fresh tarragon and it seemed about right. I covered the dish for the first 1/2 hour of cooking. No additional thickening (flour) was needed with yukon gold potatoes. I'll use sharper cheese next time.

Rating: 4
Served this at a dinner party and earned rave reviews from all. The flavors were fantastic. Even those who don't care much for tarrgon thought this dish was wonderful. Will definitely make these again!

I used a good, dry white wine for this but disliked the flavor. I do like wine and use it often in dishes I thought it was distracting to this recipe. I sauted some leeks and shallots and added that to the layering process - will try again without the wine, with a sharper cheddar and with a mix of half and half, milk and Wondra flour. It looked absolutly beautiful but too much wine flavor for me.

Loved this and so did my guests. Simple to prepare, the top browns beautifully and the taste is better than any potato gratin I've made.

This is the best gratin recipe I have ever made, and ever tasted! On a table filled with filet mignon and asparagus vinaigrette, the gratin blew them away.

This is SO much better than the usual potatoes au gratin. I cut back on the tarragon because of what another reviewer mentioned. I also added a little grated asiago cheese. It was the talk of the table!

Frankly I just thought the tarragon overpowered everything else, especially the cheese. I even cut down on it. Not sure why everyone else seems to love this recipe so much. Maybe I just don't like tarragon as much as other people.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. I used Beechers (can buy it online if you don't live in Seattle) 2 year old Flagship cheese which made an excellent sauce. I followed the recipe except that I did not add any salt. Very rich so it will be only for special occasions.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving at my boyfriend's family! It was the only dish that was finished and the first to go. I did not add as much pepper or salt as the recipe asked for. Also, I only baked for 50 minutes. My house smelled wonderful like a previous review mentioned. Enjoy. Make sure the wine is very dry. I think that is key.

I followed this recipe exactly as presented with the exception of dried tarragon, I used fresh. This is a delectable potato dish...worth splurging on carbs. I loved the way my house smelled as this was baking! This recipe has a permanent place in my repertoire.

Made an extra big batch for a party expecting to have leftovers and people were scraping the empty dish for the last morsels. Very good, but I did use less salt as previous reviewers suggested. My husband asked me to make it again the next night. Worth the treadmill time the day after.

I used the basic principles of this recipe and it created a wonderful dish. First I substituted regular sharp cheddar for the white cheddar, and a little bit of thyme for the tarragon. Then, I layered the potatoes with chopped scallions, cooked bacon, a pinch of thyme, and the cheese. I used only a slight sprinkling of salt, as the cheese and bacon already has salt in it. I left the top layer of potatoes without cheese so that it would not get overly browned during the long cooking time, and then added the cheese on top during the last 15 mins of cooking. All together, it took an hour and a half to cook. The aroma of the dish was wonderful. I was surprised how tasty the cream, cheddar, and wine sauce tasted. Here are a couple of hints. Make sure you use a DRY wine, or it will be too sweet. Also, you need to add a heaping tablespoon of flour to the wine and cream mixture to help it thicken. Otherwise you will have a tasty, but very liquid, sauce. I covered my potatoes with foil for the first hour of baking so that the top layer does not dry out.

I loved it except for the salt. The flavor was overshadowing the tarragon and cheese. I will cut the salt in half for next time, I will definately make it again.

I've made this one twice, and gotten rave reviews both times. The second time, I used half & half instead of the cream, because I had it on hand - still turned out great!

Made it for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit! I found it to be a bit too salty, although my whole family said it was not. I am making this again for New Year's and I'll cut the salt by a third or so. I cooked it at 350 for about 75 min, then took it to a family member's house and cooked it at 400 for about 20 min to brown the top. To compensate for the extra cooking time, I used 1.5 cups each of the cream and wine. It worked out perfectly. Not dry, not too saucy and the potatoes were fully cooked through.

Rating: 4
very easy to make and great results - nice recipe to have on hand for a potato dish.

I used unpeeled Yukon Gold potatoes and the results were terrific. Very earthy, tangy, and with the use of tarragon, an unexpected combination of flavors that complements grilled steak quite well. I don't think I'd make au gratin out of a box again! The previous reviewer noted the chicken with mustard/tarragon sauce from the same issue. It is worth cooking!

Rating: 3
This is a very tasty dish and easy to make. I used white sharp and yellow cheddar cheese to spice up the flavor. It was very good! My only recommendation would be to par boil the potatoes before baking to make sure they are fully done when the cheese is browned in one hour.

I think I would cut back on the Tarragon and salt next time. It was still very good but will make those adjustments next time. This is quick and easy with gourmet results.

I made this for Easter and it was SO delicious! I used fresh tarragon but other than that followed the recipe. Very easy to make. I can't understand the reviewer who claimed it was bland and am really surprised at the reviewer from PA-who said it was sweet? it wasn't sweet at all, and although it did have a slight apple fragrance, (that was the tarragon) it was definetly an outstanding potato dish! I tried out four new recipes this Easter and this was the best!!

I liked this dish except it called for way too much salt. I should have listened to my instincts and not used two whole teaspoons, but I went ahead. I served it with ham for Easter - we were all dying of thirst the rest of the day! I would definitely make it again, however - it's very good and extremely easy.

I made this for dinner and it was wonderful! It smells so good baking in the oven. I could not find yukon gold potatoes or white cheddar here in Holland. I used regular baking potatoes and substituted yellow cheddar instead of white. My husband keeps requesting this dish. I have sent the recipe to family and friends in the States, all have commented what a hit with their family it was. This is a real keeper recipe!

I halved the recipe using an 8x8 glass dish and about 1/2 t of fresh tarragon. Also, since I had grated Mexican cheese on hand(mixture of 4 cheeses)I used that instead. My husband did ask if there were apples in it - I think the tarragon gives it that taste. He ate over half the dish of potatos, calling them awesome and "better than eating creme brulee". Now that's a rave review.

The wine sauce was too sweet, even though I used a dry white wine. One guest remarked it tasted like apples...not what I wanted to hear. I also found it very dry. This recipe went to the recycling bin! I tried this twice, thinking I did something wrong the first time compared with the other reviews and I still don't like it. Just too sweet tasting for me.

To the Cook from NYC: There is indeed a difference between heavy cream and whipping cream, namely the butterfat content. Whipping cream has a butterfat content of between 30 to 36 percent. Heavy cream has a butterfat content of between 36 to 40 percent. Both creams will whip just fine, however, heavy cream will whip more easily and taste richer too.

Scalloped potatoes, especially with cheese are a favorite of mine. I used dried tarragon and will have to cut it back a next time. But otherwise this was a very tasty recipe.

This dish was excellent! We try not to eat alot of carbs so when I do make potatoes it better be worth it. These were really good and crispy on the top and bottom . Easy to prepare. The only change I had to make was I used heavy cream instead of whipping cream. I would definitely make it again.

I am always inviting our friends to dinner to tryout new recipes. This potato gratin dish was beyond delicious! I could not find white cheddar anywhere so I did half yellow sharp cheddar and half swiss cheese and also 2-3 tablespoons fresh tarragon and 2-3 tablespoons sliced leeks. The swiss cheese really added another dimension!! For me, this dish was very addictive, I couldn't leave it alone until it was all gone!

Excellent! I found the cooking time to be closer to 2 hours, but the recipe otherwise perfect. Am trying now @ 450, which is going faster. You will need to cover it to prevent excess browning.

I love this recipe. It is simple and perfect. I used a New Zealand sauvignon blanc and a premium sharp English cheddar. The results were beautifully delicious! Tender potatoes, a rich flavorful sauce with subtle flavors from the wine highlighted by tarragon...absolutely to die for. I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious but liquidy. The wine and cream were not completely absorbed by the potatoes. Next time I'm going to reduce the wine/cream on the stove to thicken it up (and hopefully intensify the flavor) then pour it over.

Exceedingly simple and delicious!!! I put it together about an hour before baking so that the flavors could all blend...not a bit was left!! Also I halved the recipe because it was only a dinner party for four and it was great!
