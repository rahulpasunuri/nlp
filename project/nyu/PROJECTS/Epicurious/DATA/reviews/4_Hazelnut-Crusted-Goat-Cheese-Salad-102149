This was very good and so easy (you don't need to tell your guests this though)! I didn't have any frozen orange juice so I just used fresh orange juice. I would think that the frozen concentrate would be too sweet. I also used blood orange olive oil that I happened to have in my pantry. Yum. Next time (there will absolutely be a next time), I will add either a small amount of garlic or shallot, and more vinegar, since I like my dressings to be a little more complex.

Absolutely beautiful, restaurant quality first course  or entrée salad if you use 2 medallions each on 2 servings as I did this evening. Looks gorgeous plated, and the flavors are perfect together. Not a tough dish to put together, either. This recipe will definitely be used for company! I subbed panko for breadcrumbs and arugula for the greens, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I never make the salad as directed, but have made the goat cheese this way many times. Good with spinach, arugula, and oranges, among other things. Delicious!

I made a few additions to this salad. I added some craisins and also sprinkled the salad with some of the leftover hazelnuts. The result was a very nice Christmas Eve salad in terms of color and taste, with red, green, and white colors and the orange dressing. I think I messed up on the cheese, though. I had assumed I should slice off the edges, but then when I baked it, it ran all over the place. It was still good, but more of a cheese glob than a nice round.

Excellent! When made as part of a large menu, the goat cheese can be tricky to time just right ... definitely agree with previous review, don't do goat cheese ahead of time. Dressing is good by itself as part of a quick-yet-snappy dressing for simple greens if you're in a pinch.

This was a great salad. I made the goat cheese the day before and I would not do that again. It got too dry. The dressing was amazing! I also sprinkled the rest of the nuts over the salad. Delish!

Super easy to put together. Had a small problem with the beaten egg not sticking after I floured the cheese rounds. Tasty dressing

This was a very good and unusual salad. I made a few substitution: I used cornmeal instead of the flour; and mesclun instead of the other greens. Delicious!

This is without a doubt the BEST salad we've ever served, bar none! We made and served it twice this week alone. The only changes we made were that we substituted balsamic for the red wine vinegar and used organic spring mix instead of watercress and endive. Thanks!

The best! The dressing was perfect- very flavourful. The cheese was also perfect! I'll be making this many more times- especially the dressing! Enjoy!

This is a nice salad for a formal dinner. I recommend using a milder goat cheese with this and mixed arugula also worked fine. Very nice in terms of presentation...

Borrowed the cheese part of this recipe (substituting pistachios) and served over romaine lettuce and sliced pear tomatoes tossed with a dijon vinagrette: simply unbelievable! The guests all asked me to pass along my recipe. Tastes like it came straight out of the kitchen of a fancy restaurant. 5 stars in my book!

Excellent recipe although I did alter it quite a bit, the goat cheese was tasty. I served this with roasted pear slices, mixed greens and the wonderful port viniagrette that is on another recipe in here. It was a truly wonderful and memorable salad that is extrememly impressive without being tooo much work. One of the best things is that most of it can be made in advance! I'll be making this again!

This is a delicious salad. I used an assortment of fresh greens (not watercress and endive) and I substituted pistachio nuts for hazelnuts...fabulous results.

This recipe is absolutely stunning! We made it for some epicurian friends- they raved. A few modifications: we mixed some field greens with the watercress; we cut down on the amount of orange peel and increased the vinegar in the dressing. Will definitely make it again and again!

A perfect quick salad to make that impresses people all out of proportion to the effort required to make it. Very nicely balanced.

Great for a dinner party- this salad tastes rich and looks impressive but is really quite simple to make. It will definitely be a hit with your guests!
