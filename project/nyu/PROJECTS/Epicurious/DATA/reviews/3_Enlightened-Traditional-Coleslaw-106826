Very simple and good; I pretty much stuck to the recipe with few adjustments: used half low-fat yogurt and half light Miracle Whip (by accident--meant to use Mayo), used less carrot so I could add about 1/8 of a red bell pepper (chopped), and subbed cilantro for parsley. This was the healthy part of my "Spaghetti Pie" meal. (Sorry there is no written recipe for the pie--I just kind of make it). It REALLY was an EXCELLENT slaw!! Will definitely make it again--do try it!!

We liked this! I omitted the yogurt and replaced it with mayo, used fresh cilantro because we didn't have fresh parsley. Also used purple cabbage.

This slaw lacked some zing, I thought. Maybe I used too much cabbage, but there didn't seem to be enough dressing. I also found the dressing a bit bland so added ground celery seed and Dijon mustard. It was better. I'd make again but continue to tweak the dressing to my tastes.

I have to agree with the cook from Denver. The yogurt was overbearing. Not a good recipe. :(

This recipe was not good. The lemon was too strong and the yogurt aftertaste was overbearing. I would not recommend this recipe.

Gave this 2 forks- a good basic slaw recipe. I didn't add the lemon peel, just didn't appeal to me. Didn't seem like the taste suffered from the use of yogurt too much, though i did add a little extra mayo and some salt after tasting.

Great dinner when combined with the maryland crab cakes from cooking light site and oven baked fries. Only thing the dressing required was salt.

For a "skinny" coleslaw this is pretty good. To make 1/2 of this recipe for two people, I divided the whole recipe in half and used 1-1/2 Tbs. of no-fat sour cream and 1-1/2 Tbs. of low-fat mayonnaise (another reviewer suggested using half and half of each) It did turn out a bit lemony. Next time I will use less lemon juice or a wee bit of sugar. I have made better coleslaw recipes, but none this low in fat. A fairly low-fat recipe (if you use low-fat mayo) is "COLE SLAW" on Emeril Lagasse's web site--emerils.com. We liked this better.

This is a very nice, mild coleslaw. I served it at a party and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Sometimes lo-cal tastes pretty darn good!

This was a good, lower fat version of coleslaw. I followed some earlier suggestions and put in a bit more mayonnaise and less yogurt. Although this is not the most exotic and it does not resemble many store-bought varieties, I would definately make it again when I want a light coleslaw.

Great Dish, lets eat again.

A few slices of avacado on this coleslaw, does not take away from the taste at all.

This is very similiar to what I've used for a long time. I use about equal amounts of mayonnaise and yogurt, but with juice from 1/2 lemon - and the celery seed, and salt and pepper.

I made this dressing with no-fat sour cream instead of yokurt. I added the onion to the dressing and used it as a vegie dip. I loved it although my husband said it was a little strong of lemon. I will certainly use it again.

As the previous reviewer said, I would add sugar and skip the lemon juice. I have a recipe that's similar for potato salad and it's delicious. It also doesn't have the lemon juice.

I had great hope for this recipe because I love substituting yogurt for sour cream in recipes but I'd never thought to substitute it for mayonnaise. And I would never try it again. Ugh. I was afraid this wasn't even salvagable. I was able to save it by adding vinegar and sugar. The lemon juice-yogurt gave it an odd feeling on your teeth. The vinegar and sugar made it edible, but next time I'll just make the classic.
