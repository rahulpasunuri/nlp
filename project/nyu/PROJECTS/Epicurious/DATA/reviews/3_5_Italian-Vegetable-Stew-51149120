My husband found this recipe because we were looking for more ways to eat beans. We are both addicted to this soup!!! I cook 1 lb of spicy Italian sausage in the pan before cooking the leek mixture. Save the sausage on the side and throw it back in at the end. There is so much flavor, especially if you find a good heavy sourdough or french bread. We just tried it with rainbow chard and it was delicious!

An excellent soup, reminiscent of the vegetable soups we had in Tuscany. We removed the ribs of the greens and chopped them coarsely. We did not precook them. We added them with the broth. They were perfectly tender when the soup was cooked and we did not lose their flavor or nutritional value. Also, we added the beans at the end so they did not turn to mush! The sourdough bread was excellent in the soup!

This recipe is OK, but not worth the effort. Three cans of beans is far too many and it needs a lot of help in the taste department. I added fresh lemon juioe, cumin, sumac, and even garam masala for some kick.

Nice and very flavorful. Used a bit less broth due to size of my soup pot. Loved the bread in the stew. Very satisfying meal.

Very good... very easy.... (not sure why there was a need to cook the kale and collards first then cook it in the soup though.) Definitely drizzle a good EVOO per serving and a sprinkle of salt. It's a keeper! This soup is also known as Ribolita soup and I had it while visiting Italy several years ago. Yummmmmmmy and filling. Definitely would make it again and again and again !

A yummy soup. It captures the flavor of Tuscan soups to a tee. Simple to make but prep is a bit time consuming. We made it as published and didnt come up with any needed tweaks. We made the soup the first thing in the morning and let it meld in the fridge until supper time. A very hearty and delicious soup.

A tasty, healthy one-dish meal. Held up well in the refrigerator for several days. The collard greens and kale came out overcooked for our taste. Next time we'll try adding them and the beans 10 minutes before serving.
