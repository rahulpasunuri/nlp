It never dawned on me I was basically making a lamb meatloaf. I think eating it with the plain yogurt helped the dish out a little. Needless to say....I won't be making this again anytime in the next decade or so.

Heeding the reviews of others, I added cumin to the mix and brushed the top with melted butter before baking. I also made a mistake when I bought the lean ground lamb and only purchased 1 pound. I split it between the filling and the crust and the results were excellent! It recieved rave rewiews from everyone, even my most picky eater!

This recipe is very strong on the lamb and not so strong on other flavors. We love lamb, so that lamb- iness is not a problem, but it was kind of bland. I would double the spices and plan on a minty-garlicy yogurt sauce with it. I would probably not make it again because I have found more interesting things to do with ground lamb.

This is a pretty good recipe to follow. My only opinion would be to add a pinch of fresh basil into the ground beef when subbing for lean lamb. Running that through a food processor will yield a slight sweetness to the meat. It is also very important in my experience to fold the mixture by hand, soaking your hands in ice cold water every few kneads.

I made this as comfort food one afternoon when in need of a Middle Eastern "food fix." It came out extremely well. I did make some of the modifications suggested (clarified butter, cumin) and served it with a yogurt, cucumber, garlic, and mint sauce similar to what was served at a favorite university Middle Eastern restaurant. Just what the doctor ordered. I will definitely make this recipe again.

An alternative party or fancy version is to form a hollow ball and leave some pine nuts loose in the middle and deep fry. I just had my second cold kibbeh lunch this week. yummmm Our middle eastern store carries three bulguhr grinds as well as over ten different barrels of olives. You should definitely use fresh allspice and fresh cumin in this as per the Lebanese commenter.

My Syrian-American mother who doesn't cook requested kibbeh as a comfort food after a long stay in the hospital. I had my doubts, but it tasted great and I am about to make it for the second time.

This recipe was delicious. My husband keeps asking me when I'll be making it again!! I stuck with the directions but also used other readers' suggestions (I used melted butter on top before baking along with some olive oil). I used a box of Near East Tabouli (bulgur) which I soaked and rinsed twice--it worked fine. For an accompaniment I used the recipe from Gourmet April 2005 issue - Lebneh with Sesame and Herbs-- I added a few tablespoons fresh mint as a garnish on top of the lebneh--it was delicious!! I used a 9" All-Clad metal pie pan and it was large enough to hold this recipe!

I'll stick with the old family recipe. Most middle eastern stores sell kibbeh spice, and you can get most of the things you need for less.

My Lebanese relatives used to serve Kibbeh with Lebneh (like a plain yoghurt sauce)at family gatherings and it was wonderful. This is a very good recipe.

Fantastic... this is delicious and much like kibbeh I have tried in Lebanese restaurants as well as in the homes of Lebanese and Syrian friends.

It seems like a good baasic reciepe but you should also pulse the bulgur with the meat and a Big No no in Kibbeh making is u should always use lean meat (Lamb,or beef) with the bulgur mixture other wise it will fall apart u should also add some cumin and mint leaves to the mix(not a lot).as well as black pepper,all spice,nutmeg,and cinamon.that is ur basic Kibbeh mix then u can fill it with meat and bake ,or make into egg shapes filled with meat and fry.oh and a dash of sumac to the filling or pomegrante syrup makes it wonderful

I have found a box of something called "Bulgar Wheat" ...is that the same as fine bulgar?

I have Lebonese relatives and "Siti" would not make this. She used ground lamb or lean ground beef if lamb was unavailable. What I see that is really wrong with this recipe is there is no mint in it. She used onions, garlic, mint and diced jalapenos, in deference to her chili addicted Texan relatives. She soaked the bulgar to soften it, mixed all the ingredients together, made large 'meatballs' and pan fried them. She then served it with the flat bread called 'madroot', which she cooked on her wood burning stove, a big bowl of tabouli salad and yoghurt for dipping. She was a wonderful cook and a warm hearted grandmother to ALL the kids in our family.

My boyfriend and I adapted this recipe to smaller proportions, using one lb. of ground white turkey. I also added a mixture of chicken stock and fat from stock that I had just made to the bulghur and turkey mixture. We didn't adjust the seasoning, however, and added sumac to both the filling and the bulgur mixture. We used regular old bulghur and it worked fine. We were actually surprised that it worked so well--very light. Made a yogurt sauce to go with it-- I wouldn't skip on it.

It sounds incredibly tasty......I can't wait to actually try it!

All my Lebanese relatives do use clarified butter, but not all use lamb anymore - a very lean sirloin will work for filling and kibbeh.

Lots of Syrian and Lebanese might say this is not particularly authentic because they usually use very lean lamb and clarified butter instead of oil. But I made this and my family loved it even though it's different than both grandmothers' recipes (one Syrian and one Lebanese).

The Baked Kibbeh is fantastic. It doubles with no problem.
