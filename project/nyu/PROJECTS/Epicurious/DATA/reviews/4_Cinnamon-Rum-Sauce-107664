Simple, quick and tasty -- my three prerequisites for a top notch dish. I entertained my guests by lighting the rum and making the sauce a flambe'(this gets rid of the alcohol some reviewers complained about). I ladled the sauce over thick pound cake slices that had been quickly pan grilled in butter. Then topped each slice with a dollop of homemade whipped cream -- a slice of heaven! Pun intended.

Just made this sauce in advance to accompany the Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding, which I will make tomorrow. The sauce is good, however, I would cut the rum down by half next time. It was much too strong for my taste, so I boiled the sauce a bit after adding the rum to try to cook off some of the alcohol. It improved, but I still think I would half the rum on my next go. That said, it is pretty tasty.

SOOOOO GOOOOD!!!! Made this with the chocolate cip bread pudding and it was amazing!!! Would have thought we were at a 5 star restaurant! I followed the recipe to a tee - with the exception of cooking the rum and vanilla a bit to let the alcohol "bite" burn off. I also made this before company cam over and then heated it up just a few minutes before needed. Would be very yummy over vanilla ice cream too! Love it!

Absolutely delicious! I made this for a crowd and everyone, adults and kids, loved it. (Kids had vanilla ice cream instead of Rum Sauce). I am making it again for another crowd this weekend!

This is a lovely and simple recipe. It's nice with bourbon as well! I used Mexican Vanilla and doubled the amount written, and it was phenomenal. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this using banana rum and used it as a glaze for banana empanadas. It was fantastic!

I make this every year for the holidays and get rave reviews every time! Very easy to prepare and high in taste. Since we don't like a strong rum flavor, we use less alcohol and nobody knows the difference, it's fabulous! Leftover sauce would be great on ice cream but we never have any :)

I toyed with the measurements, changed some amounts to taste. But either way, this sauce got rave reviews. It was delicious.

Wow. I'm licking the spoon as I write! Very very delicious. It's great on vanilla ice cream. I did not have any unsalted butter, so I used regular and replaced half of it with cream as suggested by other reviewers. Again, wow!

Great sauce! Thanks to other reviewers I used only 1 stick of butter and added half cup of whipped cream and it was great! Also used Bacardi Spice rum and increased Cinnamon. Leftovers will be great on ice cream! This can be reheated well in microwave.

This was amazing! I made it to accompany a caramel pumpkin bread pudding for a party and the first person to try it was literally pushing the sauce the rest of the evening, flagging people down to make them try it. I made more sauce than pudding, and once the pudding was gone everyone started dumping it in their drinks. It can easily be made ahead of time, but does need to be reheated (even the microwave will work) because it solidifies when cold. It's also scrumptious over ice cream.

Cut butter in half, at least, and the same for rum, and the sauce is still awesome, a keeper.

After adding the rum and vanilla I also added 1/2 cup of half & half. Made the texture smoother.
