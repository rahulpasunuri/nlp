These are so simple and delicious. If you're on a budget the recipe works wonderfully with quartered chicken as well. I've served these to guests on a number of occasions, they're always a hit.

Lovely and simple. Followed the recipe exactly, used a gas grill (with one burner, just pushed the hens to the outer edges for the lower heat cooking).

Absolutely delicious beyond compare and we will eat this all summer long. We've got a gas grill but we're savvy enough to be able to adapt.

Since I didn't make this I won't assign a fork rating. But I'm very annoyed at the assumption that I have a charcoal grill. Gas grills are allowed, but use of charcoal is prohibited in our condo. It would have been nice to see instructions for both grill types.

I made this for a early fall dinner party and in the early spring... Great when guests can be outside and talk with you while it grills... I marinated for even longer than suggested and the lemon juice did not "cook" the meat.... great with wheat berry salad
