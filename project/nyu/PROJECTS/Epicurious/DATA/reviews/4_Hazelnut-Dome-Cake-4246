Much easier than it looks, imho. Just make sure you plan ahead. Also, I made my own variation of the inner-most filling, using a mixture of freshly whipped room-temperature mascarpone cheese with a bit of powdered sugar, mixed with freshly whipped cream, and upped the chocolate to 1 cup. Everyone absolutely loved it! Also just the right amount of sweet.

To all of you who cried about this recipe and that it was too rich or too heavy or too whatever, get over it, please. It was first published in Food and Wine magazine before Bon Appetit listed it in 1997. It looks stunning, tastes fantastic and well worth the effort. Making a round layer cake is farthest from what this Italian recipe intended. Toughen up and do as it says. You wont regret it. Yes, you will have extra chocolate but in realizing that the chocolate is supposed to set in the fridge before you add the whipped cream mixture, youll notice it isnt "soup". Im 100% in favor of the Frangelica if you dont have amaretto or just plain rum. Ive tried both and it tastes perfect regardless. Having made it for my family for Thanksgiving back in 1993, my partners birthday in 2000 and again finding the time this year.... it never fails. Dont change a thing, if you think its too rich, then go eat pie!

Wow, amazing! Really great flavors and interesting textures with the three components. I used Frangelico instead of Amaretto, and am glad I did.. it was perfect. To those who had problems with the GANACHE: it is supposed to have a high ratio of cream to chocolate so that you can slice through it easily once the cake is done. Use the called-for proportions, but if you're in a hurry, just chill the ganache in an ice bath rather than in the fridge. Mine was to the "spreadable" consistency in less than an hour this way.

I only made the hazelnut cream portion of this dessert && it came out wonderfully, so I cannot comment on the cake portion of this recipe. The hazelnut cream would be perfect topping on your own variation of plain cupcakes dusted with either confectionary sugar or cocoa powder stenciled in a heart for Valentine's Day. One other thing that I had added to the whipping cream is a stabilizer so that the whipped cream would stay in it's solid form & not decontruct in the 'frig. Very Good!! Will make again & again.

Nice flavor, and definitely impressive-looking, but hard to cut. I found it really tough to "spread" the ganache on the cake once it had been arranged in the bowl. Don't let the recipe scare you -- once you have the three components made, it's not that hard to put it together. I used a spray bottle for the liqueur rather than a brush -- much easier. Nevertheless, it was too much trouble for a result that I found too rich, and not tasty enough.

Wow! This cake is amazing! I made it for a colleague's birthday and the entire office raved about it. I adapted it (because I didn't have the right tools) and turned it into a layer cake: hazelnut-chocolate cream sandwiched between two nut cake layers, then coated with chocolate ganache. Highly recommend this recipe. Time-consuming, but well-worth it!

Use FRANGELICO instead of amaretto - otherwise perfect. Agree - bake in round layers, square layers, or dome - whichever style you prefer to serve.

I've made this several times, with raves greeting it! The first time I learned a lesson by not using the correct sized pan for the cake, and it spread too much and was hard. But all other times, it's been wonderful, and not at all difficult to put together. Plus it's transportable in the bowl, and thus less worrisome than other cakes. I highly recommend it!

This recipe has great potential but I feel it isn't executed properly. My method... I used 2 12'' pans to create the double layer effect as some previous reviewers had suggested. Be generous with the amaretto; it will give the cake layers moisture and a refined flavor. I then filled the center with the hazelnut cream. Rather than making the ganache (which I feel overtakes the dish and is far to heavy), I simply made a solid chocolate glaze over the top. Before the chocolate hardened, I scored it with a knife in the shape of the pieces I wanted to cut (otherwise, good luck cutting the hard chocolate). But otherwise, a great tasty recipe for all.

I regret following the advice of those who made the cake before me -- I made two 9 inch layers, sandwiched the hazelnut cream in the center and iced it with chocolate ganache. I used 1 1/4 cups of whipped cream for the ganache. The result was that the hazelnut cream was squashed under the weight of the heavy nut cake, and the ganache was thick and overpowering. Making the cake took a great deal of time and it wasn't worth the effort. If I was to make it again I think it could be improved by doing the following: Bake the cake in a jelly roll pan as directed. When cool, cut small cake rounds with a biscuit or round cookie cutter. Do not brush the cake with amaretto. Make the hazelnut cream, put it in a piping bag, and pipe the hazelnut cream over the top. Sprinkle additional chocolate shavings over this. Serve with hazelnut gelato. If you do this variation, this cake will take a lot less time, be less fatty and less intense and will be easier to prepare. You can make the cake the night before and make the hazelnut cream shortly before serving. The recipe can be halved, then, because it makes a TON of cake, cream and ganache. I threw quite a bit away. I do think you'd be much happier with this variation -- please post if you do!

As others have said -- this recipe is delicious. I didn't see the review to reduce the amount a whipping cream in time to modify the ganache recipe, so while a little soft, still worked fine. I made the cake using 2 9" pans as well, and it was a hit for Easter dinner! I will reduce the cream the next time.

YUM! I also made the cake in two 9" rounds and it came out perfectly. I filled the layers with half of the ganache and frosted the top with the other half. I frosted the sides with the hazelnut creme. The cake only improved with age. A hazelnut lovers dream!

This cake is stunning to look at with a rich and complex taste and texture. Throughout the whole cooking process, I was nervous it wouldn't work, but it's really quite a forgiving recipe. I baked the cake for 25 minutes and I think more would have burnt it. It seemed too firm to me even at 25, but once brushed with amaretto it was just right. The ganache had too much cream to have a good texture, I think 1 cup of cream is about right. The hazelnut cream is delicious. Overall, very impressive and yummy--it got many oohs and ahhs at Christmas dinner.

This cake is outstanding. Instead of putting the cake in the shape of a dome, I baked the cake in 2 9-inch cake pans for about 25 minutes. They were perfect. I placed the cream in between the two cake layers, and with what I had left over, I would dollop on the cake slices when served. I didn't have any problem with the ganache, but I did let it sit overnight and perhaps that is the key. My husband said it was the best cake I ever made.

no wonder people are complaining about the ganache. 1 1/4 cups of whipping cream to one POUND of chocolate, so for 2 cups of cream, you'll need 1 1/2 pounds of chocolate, a lot! I would instead cut the cream to 1 1/4 cups, it will still make a ton of ganache. Then you'll need to chill it for at least 4 hours. A good ganache should really be beaten, though. If you want it to thicken faster, beat it while still warm to the soft-peak stage with a mixer.

This is one of the best tasting recipes that I have ever tried. I love that the cake portion is mostly nuts, and not flour. I made this for a special family occasion, and it was the most talked-about item on the menu

This recipe was an outrageous success the first time and the many times I've baked it since! I found it very forgiving. For example, the cake came out flatter one time than other times, but it doesn't matter, because you still slice it and it still makes this great mould, which you then stuff and cover with cocoa, and it was still as delicious. The flavors of the toasted nutes, the Amaretto and the center whipped cream are amazing. It's also visually stunning!

I can't understand the low ratings this cake has gotten. I made this cake for my father's birthday party and they whole family couldn't stop raving about it! I reccomend this cake to any nut lover. Nice n' light!

The cake was good and easy to make. The portions in the ganache are not right. I had to freeze the ganache before I could spread it. The finished product looked great whole but once sliced it didn't stay together. If I make this again I will layer it so that the slices will look appealing.

I like to make lots of cakes, and after tasting this one, it's been added to my all time favorite cake list! The cake is tender and delicious. It is a wonderful comination when combined with the nut cream and chocolate granache. I will make this again soon!

I made this cake for my mother's 70th birthday party and it was quite a hit! It was not difficult to contstruct, but if I was to make it again, I would make the ganache first to give it plenty of time to set up and to be "spreadable." I used bittersweet chocolate for the ganache, so it was not overly sweet. Many complements from all of the guests at the party!

The cake part of this recipe was delicious - very hazelnutty. The hazelnut cream, however, and the way the cake was constructed, left you with a forkfull of cream in your mouth and little cake. I plan on re-working the recipe keeping the cake part but either making it in a springform pan or 2 cake pans and covering it all with chocolate ganache.

I tried this recipe for a best friend's surprise birthday party and had nothing but trouble. The first time I made the cake part, checking a full 10 minutes befor the suggested time, it turned out like a rock. The ganache was like soup. The second time I made the cake I think I only baked it 15-20 minutes which seemed fine, but I never got the ganache to set up, even overnight. I had to run around to bakeries at the last minute for a cake even though I had started a day ahead. Can somebody tell me what went wrong? I'd like to vindicate myself before our gourmet club!

I made this cake because I wanted to try something different. It was much easier then it looked, and turned out wonderful with great reviews from all. I used a basket of each, blackberries and rasberries for the garnish. The presentation was beautiful. A definate do again.
