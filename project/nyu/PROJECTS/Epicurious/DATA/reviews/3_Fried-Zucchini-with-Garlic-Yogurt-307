These came out perfectly and were delicious. You have to eat them while they are hot or else they get a little chewy so be sure to keep them on a warmed plate or keep them warm somehow.

I, too, substituted beer for the water. I also added cornmeal to the flour. Turned out great - will use this recipe as a garnish for many meals to come.

A quick tip to reduce the oily-ness of the recipe: Dip the slices in cornstarch instead of flour prior to the batter. Keeps them crispy and they don't soak up the oil.

I am going to try this recipe because I think it has potential - there's a restaurant near us which does a similar dish, but with gorgonzola cheese in the sauce - I might switch the yogurt for sour cream and the cheese and see how that turns out. Will let you know...

I selected this as part of an Indian themed a menu for our gourmet club - overall - this dish was good, but not spectacular.

This was tasty, but I kept thinking about all the oil used in its preparation.

Very good- but I used beer in place of the water! Just adds that certain something!

This was ok, but it was a little oily for my guest's tastes. Preparation for this dish was hard to manage timing in the course of service.

This was a major hit for a Greek-themed dinner I prepared. I thought there would be too much zuccini, but it all went. It's very easy to make, also, which is nice.

tried it with a few slices of fresh ginger and it rocked. Next time, I will thin the sauce dowm more so as to avoid the clumping experienced in this first go around.

Tasty. As a variation, try using seedless eggplants, sliced, salted, drained and then fried without the flour/batter. Zuchinni can be prepared this way as well.
