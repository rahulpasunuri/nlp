The family enjoyed this very much. My 5 year old raved about it! I made a few changes, I added some dried onion and steamed spinach into the turkey patties cooking, serving the patties with the mushroom gravy, Salisbury steak style. (I did not have fresh onion for the gravy, I used dried onion in that also.) Served with steamed green beans and potatoes on the side.

It was a bit bland as a main dish for a meal. Having more varieties of mushrooms could help the flavor. Might work better as smaller ground beef rounds with mushroom sauce to accompany another course to a meal

This was delish! Although, my gravy was very thick and I had to thin it with water, but it was very tasty. I'll definitely make this again!

This is a quick, easy, and tasty dish. It's ideal for a weekend meal. It's also a good compromise meal when you're trying to cook for people who don't like or can't eat heavily seasoned food as well as those who do like something interesting and beyond bland.

the sauce was great but what it needed was what I used...buffalo ground meat...not the prepared patties..and it was super

This recipe is fast and hearty. My husband and I loved it! I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used regular yellow mustard and it was fine. I also added a little more worchestershire sauce to the "gravy" to enhance the flavor...yum!

My family really loved this dish, but I thought it was just OK. The mushrooms I used were pre sliced, and I think too thick for this gravy. I'll try it again with mushrooms I slice (thinner) myself.

I'm always suspicious of myself when I like something so much that others don't care for, but I guess that's what makes for horseraces. I also see that no one has rated this recipe for years. Anyway, I liked it very much. I thought the sauce was exceptional and although I guess the burgers themselves could have been more flavorful, the sauce made up for that with me.

This was not impressive. I too found the burgers to be bland and the whole thing pretty much lacked in flavor. I did use ground turkey breast so maybe the lack of fat had something to do with it.

I thought this dish was pretty bland. It sounded wonderful but just didn't make the grade

What a great dish! It was simple with good flavor and healthy too. I served this to a skeptic and made him a believer out of him!

Yum! Yum! What a tasty treat - and healthy too! If I made this again I would begin making the gravy sooner so the burgers would not get cold! I did not have dijon mustard so I mixed some yellow mustard and horseradish and it turned out just as good, if not better! A+

Sage doesn't seem to work well with the turkey flavor from the drippings - I would omit the sage altogether. I would make it again, but with a more savory flavor, using about 1/4 cup of white wine (reduce chicken broth to 1/2 cup) and use tons of freshly ground pepper, and simmer longer.

I have made this recipe many times and it is wonderful. I use white wine worcestershire sauce and have tried all kinds of mushrooms.

I love this recipe for a great last minute meal, simple ingredients I usually have on hand. I serve it over noodles with the gravy and cranberry sauce.

Recipe sounded a little bland, so I added some garlic to the gravy and melted a little pepper jack cheese on the burger. I also used sourdough rolls instead of regular buns. Came out pretty good.
