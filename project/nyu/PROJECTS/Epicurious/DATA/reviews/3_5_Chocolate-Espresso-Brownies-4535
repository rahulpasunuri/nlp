These brownies are super delicious. I did cook them for only 20 minutes as well.

These were OK. I found them somewhere between cakey and gooey. I don't like my chocolate super-sweet, so I only used 3/4 c. sugar, which was just fine. However, I did use hazelnuts, and really, this ended up tasting like chocolate-hazelnut brownies - I didn't get any coffee flavour at all (I didn't powder with the espresso though). To my mind, there are better C-H recipes out there.

Based on the reviews, I deviated from the recipe by omitting the hazelnuts and reducing the baking time to 25 minutes. First, my brownies weren't cakey (as one reviewer said); they were actually very gooey and fudgy. They actually turned out too gooey. Second, they weren't that thin (as another reviewer said). This recipe just didn't do it for me. But I love the presentation -- with the cocoa/espresso and powdered sugar combo. Will definitely use the presentation idea again & again. I agree with the others that it was hard to cut into diamonds; I may stick with the good old square next time.

Excellent and elegant brownies, though the result is almost too thin to be a brownie - more like a chocolate wafer. I brought these to a large going-away party and three separate people - strangers - came up to tell me they were the best dessert at the party. That has never happened to me!

These brownies were a big disappointment. I didn't use hazelnuts and the texture was too cakey for a brownie, in my opinion, (I prefer fudgy). A major disappointment after reading the stellar reviews and using top-of-the-line chocolate for optimum flavor.

These brownies are wonderful. I followed the suggestions from others and used 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, ommitted the hazelnuts and baked for 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper.

I am getting ready to make my second batch of these brownies. I made my first batch a few weeks ago and put half of them in the freezer for an upcoming football game. Imagine my surprise when I looked in the freezer and found that my children had been eating them right out of the freezer! They think that this is best brownie recipe ever.

This was very intensely flavored. I do agree that 20 min baking time is just right.

These brownies are awesome! You have to try them. I made them for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. I cut down the cooking time to 20 minutes, they seemed a little dry cooking them for 30 minutes. I cut them into squares instead of diamonds, it makes it easier. I am now making my 6th batch and will make them forever!

I make these browies all the time, without the hazelnuts usually. Everyone in my office loves them and I make a batch for everyone at Christmas.

These were great. Although I had a tough time cutting them into nice-looking diamonds (maybe I am geometrically impaired). Next time I think I will save myself the trouble and just go with the old square standby.

I make these brownies all the time. I've made a few changes to the recipe: I don't use the hazelnuts and I add about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. I have made it with the hazelnuts, but I don't always have those on hand. I'm making them today for a party. Try these. I think you will enjoy them (with or without the hazelnuts).
