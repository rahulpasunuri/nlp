This was terrific! I made it for a family dinner party and everyone loved it. The balsamic vinegar was a real surprise, and a tasty addition. I used lite cream cheese because I could not find the mascarpone cheese. It turned out just fine. I will definitely make this again.

It is my first time use phyllo dough sheets. My recommendations are when you make phyllo dough, brush little thicker butter where you are going to cut and little less where you are not. I made more filling than a recipe. It is easier to handle if you put filling in the Ziplock bag and cut a little triangle the bottom corner of the bag. It is so delicious!

I can't say anything different from what already's been said. Light, delicious, beautiful presentation. A great recipe with hugh raves. I did add a teensy bit more butter and sugar in between layers - to me it was perfect.

My whole family LOVED this dessert. It was beautiful and tasted absolutely wonderful. Wish my son-in-law would learn to make it so he wouldn't have to keep asking me!!!!

Actually just used it as a base idea for a spin off dessert for a large party. Used the frozen phyllo cups (crisped them up a bit in the oven) and piped the chilled mascarpone cream in them and topped with fresh blueberries. So easy and so elegant. Didn't make the balsamic reduction for this finger food party, but will give it a try next time.

I made this dish for a patio party and received rave reviews for both presentation and taste. I followed the recipe except that I made the squares 2" x 2" so they were easy to pick up and eat. This recipe is a real keeper.

This was without question the most beautiful dessert I have every served and like the other cook my first time with phyllo pastry..easy. I found it odd that there was no sugar in the mascarpone mixture, nor the strawberries, so I lightly sweetened both, it was perfect. mmmm

Had SO much fun making this recipe! This was my first time using phyllo dough, but it was quite easy. My only complaint is that I could have easily doubled the cream recipe. But, it was very delicious and the combination of the strawberries and blueberries is very attractive. Definitely a recipe to try for a nice summery dessert.
