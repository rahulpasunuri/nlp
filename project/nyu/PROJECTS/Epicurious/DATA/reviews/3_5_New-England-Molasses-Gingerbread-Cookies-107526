This recipe is similar to other gingerbreads I've done before so I was expecting the result I got which wasn't too bad on a first try. Shortening isn't a word most are familiar with on my side of the pond so I used more butter instead. I added my dry ingredients together and slowly combined my flour to the mixture by sifting, and added more flour as needed to handle the dough. I'd also recommend refrigerating the dough before rolling into shapes. I agree with some of the other responses of needing more spices, however if you plan on icing these biscuits, I think they're fine as they are.

This was a disaster on all accounts. I threw out the dough in the end. What a waste of materials!

After one miserable, sticky failure when I tried to roll out the dough, I learned to use LOTS of flour in addition to the waxed paper when rolling the dough. I also used 10 Tbsp unsalted butter instead of the shortening, used 3/4 C light molasses and 1/4 full flavor (because I ran out) and upped the spices by 50%. The cookies probably could have done without the extra cloves as they are almost too spicy without some icing, but that's my fault. Other than that, I really liked them! I'm a fan of soft cookies and these were perfect right out of the oven. I think this recipe is a keeper.

The cookies are fine, not great. The texture is chewy, which is nice, but the flavor isn't as intense as other gingerbread cookies I've made....the search continues for the perfect recipe.

Bland. Tastes like cardboard and lemon in royal icing is a mistake.

What a complete disaster! I am a very experienced baker, having worked professionally as a pie baker for a while, and these cookies were such a waste of my time, money and ingredients. The dough was difficult to roll, like others have commented, and the taste was awful. I even doubled the spices. I will never make these again!

Not a shortening fan, I subbed 10 T of butter for the shortening, which turned out to be good because the only buttermilk avail was reduced fat, so I needed the additional fat in the butter.I did use dark molasses but did not up the spices because I was making for kids. I did not find the taste to be particularly mild. I could see upping cin and ginger by 1/4-1/2 but not clove if you're using dark molasses. Rolling between wax paper a good tip. I chilled the dough for 20 minutes which was enough. Definitely need a layer of flour and to dust cutters and metal spat with flour when working with dough. I made the dough with my 3 year old. Next time I will make it ahead because it was really hard for her to wait for it to chill, etc. Regarding icing; some complaints here about watery-ness of it led me to use water very sparingly. I also used one of those child medicine syringes to apply the icing which was the perfect tool. Mine were done in about 9 minutes and were cakey and made the house smell like magic. I don't understand why others did not get the cakey ness? Possibly either baking too long or over-working the dough after the egg has been added which lengthens gluten chains and produces crispier cookies?

I've been looking for a softer gingerbread. These are good as is, but need more spice to make it "wow"

I've made this recipe many times, with fabulous results. I use full-strength molasses for a richer flavor, and use 10 tbsp butter in place of the vegetable shortening. The result is a cookie that is amazingly rich, and not quite so cake-y as the original.

Rating: 4
Also, I pump up the spices, as well. I do that for a lot of cookie recipes as I like strong flavor and it definitely works for these. Makes at least 50 - depending upon the size cutter you use I often end up with 80 or so.

I have tried a number of gingerbread cookie recipes and this is my favorite - and very popular as a gift! I love the cakey texture. If you are looking for perfection in the decoration you might consider adding a bit of meringue powder to the frosting as the frosting is a bit runny / slow to set.

Both the cookie and glaze are hits. I will make these again!

I did a cookie party with my five nieces and nephew, and these worked perfectly. One batch was plenty for all of them, and the wax paper trick was very handy for keeping the kitchen clean. I found that they could cut out a few, I would pop those in the oven, and then re-roll the dough, cut it and freeze it for five minutes to get another tray out quickly...no frustrated kids required. Oh, and I did add 50% more spices than the recipe called for, and the flavor was great. The icing was a fun touch (definitely don't leave out the lemon juice), but I found that once the children's hot little hands warmed up the piping bags, it made the icing very runny. I did a second batch and just handed out spoons and toothpicks, which worked much better. Make sure you have an easy wipe or disposable table cloth...or maybe a tarp.

Fantastic. Best G Bread cookie recipe ever. I tweaked the spices for taste and left out the lemon peel (didn't have any) and they're prefect. I LOVE the rolling between wax technique. My kitchen's clean! (I'm 7 months pregnant so that matters.) Fabulous. Will make every year.

Finally, gingerbread men that don't break your teeth! -- I, too, increase the spices by about 50% (we like our gingerbread robust!); other than that, I follow the recipe as written and have had good results every Christmas time.

Great cookie! Soft-like a molasses cookie, not a gingersnap cookie. I just rolled the dough out btwn wax paper and slid that in freezer for about 5 min then used the cutters to cut the shapes. Easy to peel off the paper. Baked them for only about 5-7 min and let them rest on the trays for 5 min. I will be making these every Christmas!

I carefully made these with previous suggestions (doubled spices, reduced baking time, dark molasses, freezing the dough for a few minutes before rolling). While the flavor is amazing, you have to work VERY, VERY FAST if plan you make them with cookie cutters. Within just a couple of minutes out of the freezer, this dough starts to turn to butter. It becomes nearly impossible to peel off the cutters. If you are thinking of making these with cookie cutters with kids, one word of caution: DON'T. They will get very frustrated when they have to keep relinquishing the dough to the freezer just to get a batch ready for the oven. I strongly recommend you keep looking for a firmer dough.

I followed this recipe exactly....the cookies looked great but were not tender and cake like. For fear of overcooking, I was very aware of the baking times. Also didn't make 50 as the recipe states. The flavor is good, but the cookies were much harder than stated, so I'd try it again with any suggestions.

HUGE hit with the family. I used wheat flour instead of regular flour and regular molasses instead of light molasses... the entire tray was gone.

excellent cookies. Instead making gingerbread cut outs (ran out of time), I made round balls and press them down a little. Made great round cookies. Next time I'm going to add more ginger. This recipe will be added to the all time favorite list.

Love these cookies. Don't understand why people are having so much trouble making them. You do have to set aside a lot of time, but I found the dough very easy to work with. I did make some subs: I didn't have enough molasses, so subbed in some brown sugar to make up for it. Also, used all butter, no shortening, and I added more spices plus a few grinds of black pepper for an extra kick. You need to keep chilling the dough and important not to roll out too thin as other reviewers have mentioned. These disappeared almost as soon as I made them!

I found this makes the closest thing to pfeffernusse I've been able to make. I was tired of crunchy gingerbreads, and tried this; the second try I perfected them. I added 1.5 times the spices, and added some nutmeg and allspice (couldn't tell ya the exact amounts, just dashed it in). I didn't bother with the rolling and chilling; just make small balls, pop onto the cookie sheet and flatten slightly (should still be thick and round) and bake for about 15 minutes (I found it took longer simply because they were quite a bit thicker than if I'd rolled them). They are a little on the dry side, being cakey rather than chewy (as I'd at first expected) but I dipped them topside down in the icing and sprinkled with red and green sugar crystals; the result is very much like German pfeffer nusse you find in the stores. I'll be proud to serve these to my grandparents on Christmas Eve. Everybody at work gave them rave reviews, as well, and my room mate is giving me evil glares for leaving cooling racks of pure temptation in the kitchen.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 6th birthday party yesterday. I definitely benefited from the many other reviews that came before me and had outstanding results. Many previous bakers reported that the cookies were bland, so I doubled the spices (cinnamon, ginger, all spice). Others described the process as unbearable. I rolled the dough out to about 1/4" which is quite thick. I cut the cookie with the gingerbread man, and leaving the cookie cutter on the dough I turned the wax paper up and slightly over. When the cookie was clearly separated from the surrounding dough I took the cookie in the cutter straight to the baking sheet. It worked beautifully and my husband even remarked at how neat the whole process was. He remembers flour all over the kitchen when his mother made them growing up. There does come a point when the dough is a little too soft and sticky to do this easily, at which point I popped it in the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up. But the results were wonderful, the house smelled fantastick and the kids couldn't stop eating them. Highly recommended.

Two forks for production problems and waste. MOving the raw cookies arounc with a thin metal spatula is NOT an option if you roll them less than 1/4 inch thick. Nasty. Don't do it unless you enjoy cussing.

Screw these cookies. If you don't have experience making rolled cookies, DO NOT MAKE THESE!!!! This is the third or fourth christmas I've made them. I am always happy with the end-product, but the process is screwed. The dough, even after chilled 12 hours, is EXTREMELY soft and you should NOT use detailed cutters at all. The methods provided in the recipe set you up for disaster, falling apart cookies, and dough that needs to be re-chilled and re-rolled. Making them is always a comedy of errors and not in a good way. Once again, the end product is great, but you if you have limited experience cooking or making rolled cookies DO NOT MAKE THESE.

I made these and found them to be very easy the key I think is chilling the dough then freezing the cookies before you bake them to make them easy to tranfer to the baking tray. I had never before made gingerbread men and my husband said they were the best he had ever eaten. I put a little more spices than the recipe and used dark molasses though. Will definitely make these again.

I made this recipe last christmas. I plan on making these gingerbread cookies every Christmas. They were easy to make and tasted wonderful. My 4 and 5 year old niece and nephew helped me roll, cut out, and ice them. We had so much fun and they loved them. The cookies are moist with just the right amount of spice.

I cheated a bit...and dropped these by teaspoon and then flattened them into disks...baked then decorated them by drizzling the icing over the round cookies. Excellent flavor without the hassle of cutting. Maybe a holiday faux paux but sometimes you just want a good cookie!

I'm more of a chewy rather than crunchy cookie fan, so I was excited to try this recipe. My entire extended family, even those who claimed to not like gingerbread, loved this recipe. The transferring between cookie sheet and rolling board as described in the recipe is far too complicated. I rolled out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper, cut out the shapes, removed the excess between the cookies. and then just slid the bottom sheet right onto a baking sheet. The cookies don't spread as they bake, so you can fit them quite close together. I left the dough pretty thick and cooked them for 10 minutes - perfect!

I rolled out the dough on baking paper, removed the excess dough around the cookies, and transferred the whole thing ont a baking sheet. No trouble with broken cookies! The baking time in the recipe is way too long, though. The 7-8 minutes suggested by a previous reviewer were just right.

Rating: 4
Great flavor! (although I may have to give some credit to my 2 year old who liberally dumped in extra spices as my back was turned...). My two recommendations are 1) put the dough in the freezer instead of the refrigerator and 2) I only used about 5 3/4 c. of flour in the dough & used the rest to sprinkle on the waxed paper so I could lift the cookies off easily. That's how my Mom always did it & it was MUCH easier than when I tried without.

While these are really tasty, and nice and soft compared to many other gingerbread cookies (don't even think about cooking them for longer than 7-8 minutes!), they are a huge pain. The recipe at least makes enough to make the effort worthwhile, but just keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to make them.

Rating: 2
I actually posted a positive review of this recipe last year. Now that I'm in the middle of production on them this year, I have to agree with the previous poster. They are a pain in the ass. The dough practically melts at room temperature. However, if you roll the dough between sheets of waxed or saran, then just put them into the freezer, they are easy to get off the paper and onto the cookie sheet. Also, plan on rolling the dough fairly thick for easier handling. You'll have less cookies but you won't want to go postal.

Actually, I reviewed this recipe last year and gave it a thumbs up, but now that I'm in the middle of production on them again, I thought I'd add they really are a pain in the ass. The dough practically melts at room temperature. Plan on rolling out the dough thick and getting about half the cookies you planned on, otherwise you'll go postal.

This recipie is a PAIN IN THE ASS! Read it carefully -- you need all sorts of cookie sheets. I had a very hard time getting the raw cookies from the waxed paper to the baking sheets. The cookies are kind of dry and crumbly, not crunchy at all. I STRONGLY recommend the other gingerbread cookie recipie, which I made last week, which was much much easier.

Rating: 3
These were indeed very bread-like, but a little bit dry by the next day (so if you refrigerate the dough, make sure to keep it tightly covered). The dough is NOT sweet enough by itself, so the icing complements the cookies nicely. Maybe it was because I didn't add cloves, but the cookies don't have an immediate punch of flavor - however, they leave a good after taste.

Rating: 3
Pretty good, with a nice texture (if you don't roll too thin), but a little lacking in flavor, even though there are so many spices. Not very sweet, either, but that works out well with the icing. The icing was great, but BE SURE to sift the powdered sugar (I forgot and spent a lot of time forcing the icing through a sieve to try to remove the lumps!).

Rating: 3
These were very nice with a standard lemon glaze (powdered sugar and lemon). I thought the dougn was a little thin on the first ones when rolled to specification. I went with dough between 1/4 and 1/8 inch thick. These cookies soften up fast so if a bit thicker they're much easier to work with and still have their nice shortbread but firm texture. I didn't find them bland at all.

I use this site all the time for my recipes, but this is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe. This recipe was absolutely perfect. This is the first time I have ever made cookies from scratch and the recipe was really easy to follow. It took a little time, but it was definitely worth it. The first batch I rolled the dough out a little too thin and the cookies weren't chewy, but still good. I just made the dough thicker on the next batch. Since I am new at baking, I couldn't really look and see if the cookies were done, so I am glad the 12 minutes was the perfect timing for the cookies to bake.

This recipe seemed like a great deal of effort for the end result. Following the instruction to cool them on the tin for five minutes left them very brittle and hard to remove without breaking. I don't know, maybe I just shouldn't make gingerbread men. I get so depressed when their little arms and legs fall off.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe! I found that 9 minutes was a perfect cooking time for me - maybe because I was rolling the cookies thinner than the recipe stated? It is time consuming to make, however, so plan accordingly. Flavor was excellent - both of my children's class rooms raved about them - especially the teachers! I did not try the icing,though. Maybe the next batch....

I think these cookies have plenty of flavor, but they are not super sweet or buttery like other types of holiday cookies. I don't think it would hurt, though, to add a little more spice if you like a kick in your gingerbread. Great recipe, easy to make, easy to roll out, nice soft cookies. :)

Growing up, in the midst of cow fields and pumpkin patches, there was a farm stand one town over that we visited each week for one reason: the most amazing gingerbread cookies ever. Unfortunately, the farm stand has now been bought out, remodeled, and lost its charm. But, after making this recipe, I now know I can conjure up those sweet fall days in my own kitchen. In the words of one appreciative relative, "These are the most amazing gingerbread cookies ever." Sentimentality aside, they're also pretty easy to make.

I've made this recipe twice and love them. I don't usually like crispy cookies, so it's nice to find a chewy recipe. However, they weren't as chewy as I had hoped. My solution was to roll them thicker and bake them about 9 minutes rather than the recommended 12, the outcome being perfectly soft. And yes, they do seem to be even better the next day. They are hard to stop eating, even when they haven't been frosted!

These are just great cookies. Dough is soft...but still easy to work with as long as you use plastic wrap on top when you roll them out. I roll them on a silpat and cut them out...so I don't have to transfer the cookies...just pop them in the oven. My son couldn't stop eating them...and he's 25...enjoy...they are really good.

It's too bad the previous reviewer took out his/her frustration with the web site on this recipe. The recipe is really good. These cookies stay soft and chewy as advertised and they have a nice spiciness to them. They handle well and bake evenly. We had different sized men, women and children baking on the same sheet and there was no problem. Allow a lot of time, though. As my 9-year-old son said, "This recipe likes the refrigerator!"
