Normally I decide whether or not to try a new recipe based on the volume of positive reviews it receives. Despite the sparse & mixed reviews on this one, I couldn't help myself. I thought "How can you go wrong with bacon, cheese & garlic??" So my husband and I made this last night and LOVED it! We crushed the garlic cloves instead of halving them, which may have intensified the flavor of the confit. Also crisped up an extra slice of bacon and used about 1/2c more cheese than the recipe calls for. We tried half of the pizza with pizza sauce and half without & agreed that the sauce definitely added to the flavor. Finally, we shredded asiago on top of the finished pie and sprinkled with crushed red pepper flakes. We will be making this pizza again & again!

We used Turkey Bacon and added sliced Roma tomato (added during the last few minutes of cooking) instead of the red pepper. Very Good! I will add more garlic next time, that is the best part!

Considering the preparation time the pizza was good but not extraordinary. Not sure I would make it again.

Great recipe but, like most people here, I had to play with it a little to make it "mine." I used a mixture of fresh mozzarella and asiago cheeses, and added some fresh chopped rosemary to the cooking garlic. I then prepared this as a grilled pizza and it was amazing!

It was a hit. I used a Pillsbury pizza crust in a can (instead of a homemade crust), as I was short on time. I pre-baked it for 7 minutes and then added the toppings, including some crushed red pepper. I then baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.

I've made this several times, and it's always delicious. Baby portabellas are terrific on it. I like using both mozzarella and parmesan cheese as well.

Not sure what all the hype was about this pizza. We made our own crust (have done so before with excellent results), but the topping was kind of bland. We added our homemade tomato sauce for the second small pizza, and that helped a bit. We are normally big mushroom fans, but in this recipe, their flavor didn't really add anything.

MAade this for a party and it was a keeper!

I have made this pizza several times. I make my own thin-crust pizza crusts, and keep them in the freezer, and I prefer these to the store-bought variety. I used portabella and crimini mushrooms. Initially I was hesitant to use the bacon, but after I tried it, I wouldn't make it any other way. I disagree with the reviewer who didn't miss the red pepper, however. It adds a wonderful fresh flavor. I will continue to make this recipe often!

I used fresh morels - fantastic. I left out the red pepper, only because I did not have any, but it was not missed. Fast if you use prepared breads (which I did) and yummy! Great Saturday lunch when you want something fast and special.

This pizza is so wonderfully savory and it is pretty easy to make I sqeezed it in on a weekday with time to spare. The garlic is great and though I dont partake in bacon much it was a wonderful indulgence. I used fresh shitakes, portabella's and a few domestic. Delicious!
