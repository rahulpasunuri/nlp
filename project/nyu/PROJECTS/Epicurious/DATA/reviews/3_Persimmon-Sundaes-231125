This is very, very good - but I made a few modifications. I used unfiltered apple juice because that was what was available. Not bad, but the apple flavor threatened to overwhelm the persimmon. I will use pear or water next time. I also added about a 1/4 tsp salt, which rounded out the sauce. Maybe it was my cardamom pods, but I ground them fresh. They had a lovely smell, but did not add much flavor. I bumped it up with a cinnamon/nutmeg/orange peel spice blend I have on hand. It is delicious - my teenage daughters keep sneaking spoonfuls as it cools!
