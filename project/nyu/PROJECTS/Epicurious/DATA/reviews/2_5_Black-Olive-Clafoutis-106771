I made this as an appetizer/amuse in a mini muffin pan which worked out fine. The dish is very sweet which I wasn't expecting. I thought that the saltiness of the olives would balance the sweetness, but it didn't seem like there were enough olives to really do that. I doubt I'd try it again, but if I did, I might increase the amount of olives or skip the poaching and possibly just soak in water for a few hours. The batter was great and I would definitely use it for a traditional fruit clafoutis. The almonds gave it a nice texture.

I can't believe I'm the first to rate this - it was spectacular! Served pieces with - as suggested - mache and some simple cheeses. Like that could stand alone as an elegant supper (champagne?) Anyway do try it - although you need to plan ahead it is really quite simple to make - the results far exceed the investment of (passive) time. Bravo to the chef!
