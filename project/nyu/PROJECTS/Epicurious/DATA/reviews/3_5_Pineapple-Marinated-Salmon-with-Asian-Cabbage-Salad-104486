This was wonderful, and the Asian salad is a perfect match. I cooked it for a non-traditional Christmas eve dinner as I had minimal time but wanted a special meal, and this did not disappoint. Even my 6 and 4 year olds requested that I make it again! Big hit all around!

I found this recipe while looking for another salmon-pineapple recipe, and saved it for future reference. So, this evening I made it. I thought it needed a bit of additional flavor, and consulted a book I just received in the mail, The Flavor Bible, to find out what pairs well with pineapple. The additional flavor enhancements I choose were; rum, lime juice and rosemary. As I cooked only for my wife and myself these were the amounts I used. 10 oz pineapple chunks, 2 tbs tamari, 2 tbs dark rum, juice from 1/2 lime, 1/2 tsp whole pepper melange, 1/2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary, In a food processor process these ingredients until really smooth. 2 pieces salmon filet, abt 1" thick Marinate for at least 3 hours. Put the salmon on an oiled aluminum foil, and bake at 450 F in the oven for around 13-14 min. While the salmon bakes, heat the marinade in a sauce pan until boiling. When hot, pour trough a fine sieve, pressing to extract all juices. Discard solids. Reheat juices, and just before serving whip in 1 tbs cold butter. Dribble some of the sauce on the salmon and serve with boiled potatoes and steamed snow peas. Serve the rest of the sauce on the side. This came out really good!

The salmon was very tasty. Really loved it. Served it for New Year's Day brunch. Added some extras to the cabbage salad for color and flavor: crushed dry chillies, red bell pepper, and green onion.

Excellent! Be careful when cooking the sauce, it does bubble. The 4 minute cooking time is for the very thin slices. Thicker pieces will need more time.

This is one of the best salmon recipes I've tried, and incredibly low fat. I made it for a large crowd over the holidays, and many people asked for the recipe.

I have made this salad many times for buffet luncheons. It is outstanding and everyone asks for the recipe. It is a nice light salad - not heavy with meats and creamy sauces. For the reviewer who didn't make the cabbage, it is too bad. It makes the salad.

I hate to be the one dissenting voice, but I thought this dish lacked something. (I didn't make the cabbage salad, so maybe that would help it) The sauce needs garlic or ginger or wasabi, or maybe all three! Also, I like my salmon rare but after only 4 minutes in the oven it was still sushi!

I had high hopes for this recipe. I really loved the salmon with Thai curry sauce from epicurious, and the positive reviews for this one looked great. But, the sauce was bland, and I didn't like the rice vinegar on cabbage.

Followed recipe exact. Wouldn't change a thing. Huge hit for a simple Sunday family dinner party, accompanied with cold sesame noodles and bangkok salad.

A nice salmon dish if you're looking to impress but not spend much time. Highly recommend the black sesame seeds. I used pineapple/coconut juice in the sauce, which turned out great.

Couldn't believe that so few ingredients could make such a stellar entree. Though the cooking time was too short for my oven, and I substituted ground pepper and parsley for garnish as one of my nine guests cannot eat seeds. They all gave it rave reviews.

EASY!!!! This was simple to make and the presentation was great! I added crushed roasted peanuts to the Asian Cabbage for more flavor.

This dish was excellant! Marinated the fish for 3 hrs. & baked it. Reduced sauce& added 3T. flour + half cup milk &whisked together. We were drinking the sauce! Served w/ grated green cabbage, carrot & coconut w/ a pineapple juice & mayo dressing. Definately a keeper.

A friend made this for her New Year's Eve party. She also made everything else featured in the holiday buffet menu for Dec., 2000. The salmon was everyone's favorite. The black sesame seeds are beautiful on the salmon. White wouldn't look nearly as good, so I'd advise going to a little extra trouble to find black.
