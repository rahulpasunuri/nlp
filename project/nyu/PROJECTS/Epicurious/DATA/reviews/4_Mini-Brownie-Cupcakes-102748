Excellent recipe. Used 1/2 of the sugar amount and used bittersweet chocolate, was still outstanding. Used mini paper liners with cooking spray and it was so easy to remove. Made this for a wedding reception and it was a big hit.

I just used a good amount of baking cooking spray as I did not have liners. They popped out just fine. with 4 sticks of butter how could they not! I used all organic ingredients and did not need the full 30 minutes to bake... maybe 23 minutes or so... delish. Gooey middles, crunchy outside.

I only baked mine for 15 min and they came out well done. I also added a pinch of baking powder and they ended up with perfect domed tops, though I wonder if the baking powder was responsible for drying them up a bit or if it was just my oven. Does anyone understand why this recipe does not include a little baking powder? I'm just getting into baking and learning the chemistry...

this is my go-to recipe for parties. i also prefer them to regular frosted cupcakes as they are easy to transport. they always look pretty and elegant, especially with powdered sugar. i put the sugar on right before serving. i followed other folks' advice and only baked for 15 minutes. this ensures they'll be super moist. also, i used paper liners, which i sprayed very very lightly.

These have an intense chocolate flavor and nice crisp tops. Mine seem like they might not be super-moist by tomorrow, when I'm serving them. But I had absolutely no problem removing them from a sprayed non-stick pan or peeling off paper (non-waxed) wrappers.

Agree with Hungry_chef. I also found these to be very difficult to remove from a sprayed, non-stick pan. Used paper muffin liners for the second batch. The paper liners were difficult to remove without tearing.

I have made this recipe twice - because of the great reviews, I thought maybe I did something wrong the first time. But the second time they came out the same - there is nothing wrong with them, they are fine chocolate mini cupcakes. But I did not find anything special about them, nor did I find them very chocolatey or decadent. I would recommend trying another recipe.

Very easy to make and wonderfully rich! Upon reading others' reviews, I used one less egg for denser results and baked 15 minutes. Tried the espresso and toasted coconut versions and also did a walnut variety- all worked out great. With an entire pound of butter, don't know why anyone had sticking issues, but I sprayed my tins as a precaution and they popped right out after cooling a few minutes.

Wow, this is a great mini-cupcake recipe, which I made for my annual open house. I used a mini cupcake pan with paper lines, but I didn't get 72 cupcakes...more like 40. They really are delicious and moist and chewy and chocolatey and so easy to make. No frosting is needed...I powder-sugared mine and then used a small dab of chocolate frosting to glue a roasted almond on top of each one. I also made these two weeks ahead and froze them, defrosting them a day ahead, and they tasted just great.

No waxed liners available in my area so greased lightly my non-stick pan with Pam and then cut-out rounds of waxed paper to cover bottom of cups which I also lightly greased. No sticking problems and removed the waxed paper just after turning cupcakes on rack to cool. The size of my mini-muffin tin is 3/4" x 1 1/2" and I used a baking time of 25 min. Scrumptious!

These are good but I thought much too sweet. Next time I reduced the sugar and added coffee powder, then covered with bittersweet chocolate ganache.

These were fine--three forks fresh from the oven; two served room temp the next day. I followed reviewers recommendations and shortened the baking time. Honestly, I thought it cost me a lot of good ingredients and time for an OK product, despite a great reception at the party to which I brought them.

Is it possible that this recipe has made me a brownie snob? These brownies are amazing. They're moist and rich and when they're straight out of the oven after 15 mintues (not the 25 it calls for) you're treated to a mini lava experience. I followed the other reviewers advice and went a little further with my creativity. Once I had made the batter, I divided it among 3 large glass bowls. In one bowl I added 2 T of espresso powder (tried it with 2 t and no one could taste it). The next bowl got a handful of toasted coconut and some coconut extract. (I found this was helpful as the coconut makes the batter thicker so a T of coconut extract was perfect.) The third bowl got a handful of toasted almonds and a T of almond extract. I then followed the recipe as instructed. Everyone loved them. The extract wasn't too much...there's so much chocolate and sugar that it would be tought to overpower that. For fun, I put the brownies on 2 different plates. The espresso brownie plate was trimmed with chocolate covered espresso beans, the almonod brownie plate was trimmed with toasted almonds, same for the toasted coconut brownies. Went to a party on Saturday...25 people ate all 72 brownies...this when there were chocolate creme puffs, too! Will make this recipe again and again!!

I've made these several times and they are a always a hit. I use miniature silicone cups and they work great without having to spray them first.

Rating: 3
I used 6 large eggs because I prefer a denser brownie and added a tsp of instantespresso powder. Did not use muffin papers, just sprayed with Pam. Baked 15 minutes and removed from tins after 5 minutes of cooling; any longer and they stick. Delicious and an excellent dessert to pass at large gatherings.

great cupcakes, but like others say, bake 15 min. max! no cups necessary, but you do need to spray muffin tin or they will stick. fill cups all the way for muffin-like tops, 7/8 full for little round top bites.

This is a fabulous recipe...the cupcakes turned out so well, a little moist in the middle. Yum. I added some dessicated coconut and almond slices for a little crunch but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Now the cupcakes are going to get stuck to my hips!

This recipe was fantastic - the little brownie cupcakes were moist but slightly crunchy on the outside with a wonderful rich flavor, but even non-chocolate lovers will appreciate the recipe. I used a vanilla buttercream frosting that was wonderful. Made a LOT of cupcakes.

I cut the recipe down to a dozen, but it should be cooked for only about 15-20 minutes at that point.

These are great, and are now my standard recipe whenever I'm asked to bring something to a get- together. Everyone loves brownies, and no one can seem to resist trying one...or a few. I never use cupcake liners; I've found that more people eat them when they don't have to peel a wrapper, for some reason. I follow the recipe exactly, or use cocoa + oil if I don't have chocolate in the house. I always dust with powdered sugar (since without cupcake liners the tops are a little flat). Adults and kids love these. Fancy, but simple. If I'm asked to bring a dessert, I just bring some good vanilla or cinnamon ice cream with these (and some assorted toppings) for sundaes.

Ultimate, rich and decadent two bite or four bite cupcake recipe. Moist and chewy on the inside, great texture on the outside. Used non-stick mini cupcake pan without any liners or spray, no problem popping them out. Just make sure you wait about 10 minutes and they slide right out. Recipe made exactly 72 minis plus 12 regular size muffins. Dusted off with confectioners sugar on some and unsweetened cocoa on others for a truffled touch!

I didn't spray the liners and they came out fine. I also didn't let the batter sit in the liners too long before baking. Not sure if that made a difference. Filled them 3/4 the way & baked for approx. 15-17 minutes. Nice tops. Great taste & texture. I will put a little bit of chocolate frosting on the tops w/sprinkles & good to go for treats for kid's classrooms.

These are the best!! I made & brought them to a Christmas party. They stuck to the wrappers, but people loved them so much they dealt with it. One person ran to heat his up in the microwave, and his wrapper released easier. They taste so good, no one cared. ANd they were so pretty, guests thought they were bakery bought. I sent some to my b/f who lives in MA, and he LOVED them - said he'd wal 5 miles for one. Actually, I took the leftover batter and put it in some nonstick baby bundt pans. They slid right out.

These are a great, light brownie. I quartered the recipe and got 9 large cupcakes. I also used gluten-free rice flour and couldn't tell the difference. These are moist, airy and absolutely delicious. One of our new favorite brownie recipes!

I made these in regular-sized cupcake/muffin pans for a dinner party yesterday, because I was asked to make a dessert. I made them to the letter of the recipe, but took others' advice and did not spray the paper liners, because I didn't want flat tops (who wants a flat top?). I sprinkled them with some powdered sugar mixed with some cinnamon, using a strainer. They were so beautiful, everyone (11people) thought I had bought them from the bakery (gorgeous tops!!). And, they got raves for flavor from everyone. Some even had two, and ate the crumbs from others' plates. HOWEVER, the paper holders were a mess, they were so tough to get off. I was hoping the reviewer who said that if you let them cool before trying to remove them, it was easy. Not for me. One guest saw everyone struggling to rip theirs off, he quickly heated his in the microwave, and his came off in one piece. That said, people were eating the cupcake off the wrappers like they were artichokes, and making yummy sounds all the while, which absolutely amazed me. They had a rich, buttery/salty/chocolaty flavor, multi-dimensional, which was fabulous. I used Green & Black's Organic 72% Baking Chocolate, and course sea salt. It made 12 cupcakes and 5 mini bunt cakes, which I plan to send to friends. It took a lot longer than the 25 minutes, more like 45-50, and still the insides were just a teeny bit underdone, which actually added to the yumminess, but be careful, I think this could be disastrous if too underdone. Definitely sprinkle with powdered sugar with or without cinnamon, it's so pretty. Might be pretty to stencil it, too. I would make it again, but maybe use nonstick and no liners, the bunt cakes just fell out of the molds.

These two-bite brownie cupcakes are the best. I've even doubled the recipe at the holidays and every last one gets eaten - beware it makes 144 mini cupcakes if you 2x the recipe. I recommend getting a lot of the mini cupcake pans so you can do 4 doz at a time.

Very nice moist chocolately cupcakes, which taste just as good 5 days later (store in air-tight container). This is good as the recipe makes a very large number; I would consider halving the recipe next time. I used foil and paper liners for full- size muffins (got tired of making mini ones, and had so much mixture left) and paper liners for the mini ones. They rose nicely and all looked quite professional.

Rating: 4
Really delicious and very easy to make! I couldn't find waxed liners , just regular paper ones and used spray on some not on others. The unsprayed looked better with the domed tops mentioned. The batter needs something to hold onto in order to rise. I found that once cooled they really didn't stick at all.

We made these mini cupcakes for our daughter's third birthday. We also made wholegrain blueberry mini muffins, so guests had a choice between a decadent and semi-healthy treat. We shaped the cupcakes as a "3," put three candles in and dusted some powdered sugar over them. They were an amazingly huge hit, and we're still eating the leftovers. Thanks to other reviewers for the tip on the reduced baking time.

OK, the brownies themselves are very delicious! my only complaint is that the recipe says it makes about 72 mini cupcakes... i made this recipe last night and now i have 108 minis and 12 large ones (cause i got tired of messing with the small cups). over all it is a wonderful recipe and i will use it again only i will half it.

Made this twice (first time to test) for a neighborhood dessert buffet, and jazzed them up a bit by turning them into "black bottoms" w/ a cream cheese/choc chip center; as brownies they look too much like what you can buy at Costco/BJ's (but of course taste WAY better!). My changes: used Bakers unsweetened choc squares and then melted with butter in microwave (as I hate chopping chocolate!); halved the recipe w/ 3/4 C. + 2 Tbsp flour; used 8 oz. cream chs. creamed w/ 1/3 C. sugar + 1 egg + 1/2 C. mini choc. chips; added a bit of vanilla to both the chocolate & cream cheese batters. Used plastic bags to "pipe" the chocolate batter 2/3 full into the mini cups, followed by a little squirt of the cream cheese mixture. I experimented by using both paper liners and sprayed pans: the liners did not say "waxed" and they were fine - no more sticking than usual - and had nicely domed tops as promised. The ones w/o the wrappers came out of the sprayed pan easily, just slightly flatter on top. Cooked for 17 minutes. Turned out wonderfully; the chocolate is rich and texture is dark, dense and almost fudgy.

I couldn't find the waxed liners so I used paper and foil liners. My first batch, I baked for 17 minutes, but I forgot to spray the liners! BIG MISTAKE! They stuck to both the paper and foil (but what I could salvage tasted great!) On my next batch, I remembered to spray and I baked for 20 minutes. Perfect!! After devouring one, my husband cried, "4 FORKS!"

Delicious and fun to make and present for an event. The indicated bake time is too long, as other bakers mentioned. For 24 mini cupcakes, I baked for 17 mins. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

Don't put these in the fridge. They get really hard. The flavor is still good, but they become kind of glassy.

This recipe produced muffins which were moist, chocolately and completely off the hook!!! I put liners into standard sized muffin pans and got 24 with about four muffins' worth of batter left over. The tip about the ziploc bag was terrific since the batter is really viscious and otherwise tough to handle. The baking time listed was just fine for muffins of these size. Definitely a keeper.

I screwed up and for the first time ever didn't read the other user reviews, so mine were a bit overcooked. They are amazing and easy but reduce the cooking time. Also, must use liners.

The timing is off, or the temperature. I'm not sure. Good but a little crumbly on the outside. I think I will try 325 degrees next time. I checked at 15 mins and 22 mins and it went from wet to slightly crumbly in that time. I used a really good pan as well.

This dish is perfect for an office dessert or any other large gathering. I followed the recipe to the letter, except reduced cooking time to 15 minutes after the first batch started to overcook around 20 minutes. While it may seem like a short amount of time, the brownies are small and cook fast.

Hi. I tried the recipe tonite. But found it a bit dry. The top was too hard. The 2nd batch i made, i left it for 15 mins, and it came out better. The inside is nice, but on the outside it did not look appetising. Any idea how to improve on the look?

Delicious and elegant. Strongly recommend purchasing the very hard to find waxed muffin liners. As the cupcake dries over time the regular paper liners stick to the brownie and are impossible to completely remove. Be sure to keep in airtight container if making ahead so they do not dry out and become too hard.

These gems are super easy and quick to make. I quartered the recipe, used decorating gel to write alphabets on the cakes, then dip them into edible color beads...very very cute and yummy...it's not too sweet, very chocolatey, and really moist. i ate 4 right out of the oven...sinful but given the way it tastes, i don't mind the extra pound. =)

These cupcakes were easy to make, delicious warm or cold. Using a soup spoon I had no trouble filling the minicups. I had to adjust the baking time to my oven, around 20-22 min to have the cupcakes just the right concistency: not too hard on the outside and fully baked inside.Next I will try to reduce the butter in the recipe, so there is no extra grease in the cups.

Rating: 3
I would have to give the batter 4 forks, and I don't usually eat batter. I found myself wanting to make these into muffins, to add nuts, choc chips, etc. I didn't, but just couldn't get by without frosting. The consistancy was closer to cake than a brownie.

Rich, moist & yummy brownie cupcakes! I did them using muffin size moulds and they turned out just as good. :0)

I've used this recipe twice in two weeks to serve to guests and they loved them. If you can time it so that the cupcakes bake just before you serve them, they are extra good, with a slightly cruncy top and soft interior. You can fill the pans a little ahead and put them into the oven just before you sit down. This is a huge recipe, so I cut it in half. The small size allows people take just as many as they want, but they'll probably eat more than they intended.

These mini brownie cupcakes are the perfect size because they are excellent, but extremely rich. I've made these twice and have received rave reviews. They are qiuck and easy to make. The suggestion to use a zip lock bag was very helpful because it is hard to control the batter and makes cleanup easy. I did find that it is better to only fill the muffin liners 1/2 to 2/3 full to get the delicate cupcake look, otherwise the batter flows over and the centers fall. Definately dust with powdered sugar. Nice presentation.

Rating: 4
This was such a hit!!! You can get these mini cupcake liners at any party supply or bakers store. There not sold as cupcake liners but candy cups. Dusting it with powdered sugar gave it a professional look. I would definitely make this again. The batter is easy to make and I placed it in a large ziploc and snipped the edge. It is much easier to pipe it in instead of spooning the batter in the small cups. You can use a pastry bag but if you use a cheap ziploc you can just throw it away after...

I found spooning batter into mini cup difficult. My daughter suggested using a pastry bag. So, I did. It works great! Very easy to control. I shortened baking time as well.
