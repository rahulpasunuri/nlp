I like the combination of ingredients but added quinoa as a grain. The dressing needed something to punch it up and we added lemon juice and parsley. A bit of garlic would help too.

I can understand why some previous reviewers didn't like this recipe. I found the dressing with the yogurt-mayo-vinegar combo didn't work well with the fresh corn. It was just too yogurt-y for me. Instead I used for the dressing: 1/4 cup safflower mayo, juice of one lime, chopped cilantro, and a sprinkle of ground thyme. Mix and let chill for a couple of hours.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. A quick, easy, tasty summer sidedish. Used garbonzos in place of kidney beans and left out the tomato. The dressing is superb, but is the mixture of textures (particularly the crunchy corn) that *makes* this dish. Severs with Bobby Flay's grilled salmon and orzo, pine nut and feta salad (both at epicurious). Easy and delish.

This was very simple and quite tasty. I've made it for 2 pot lucks over the last week to great reviews and many requests for the recipe. I followed another reviewers suggestion of adding chick peas mainly because I like them alot and they add a nice additional color to the salad. I don't know how any of the previous reviewers could call this nasty or gross, especially someone that calls themselves an "accomplished cook". Perhaps some of the ingredients are just something they don't care for? As for the cook from Brooklyn, perhaps if you made the recipe using the ingredients as specified instead of just corn and peas stuffed into potatoes (no peas or potatoes called for in the recipe) it may have been more enjoyable.

My family loves this salad, and I love how easy it is. This is perfect when we have to eat early before my daughters' various sports. It doesn't overfill us, but gets us through without getting hungry, while tasting delicious. Then we come home and have some more after their games and it is not too heavy before bedtime either.

This is a big favorite. It's a cool, refreshing salad for a hot summer night. I use twice the limas (we love them; used the babies) and omitted the green beans. I serve it for company, and invariably there is NONE left. I've also made it with the addition of chickpeas, which is also yummy. We've had this with bread as our whole dinner when it's just too darn hot to cook.

This is nice, but it lacks something, and I couldn't discern how to change it. I did make it for a summer party - I wanted finger food, so I hollowed out boiled new potatoes and used corn and peas only. This turned out to be very tasty - the potatoes added a nice dimension - and people liked it, but no one loved it.

Very good - I added a tablespoon of sugar and substituted soy beans for the lima beans....Yummy!

Made tonight, used frozen corn. It tastes better after flavors meld for several hours in the refrig. Nice, light, fresh taste, colorful. Will use more basil next time. You can dance to it...I give it an 86!

Good any time of the year salad, can't resist adding some cooked (slightly) yellow/zuchinni squash to succotash recipes

A terrific summer dish. I can't imagine, nor can my guests, anyone describing it as "GROSS" or "NASTY."

A friend brought this salad to work this week. I thought it was so good that I made it for dinner the next day. Yes, I would make it again.

I thought this was a great salad. Served it with a green salad and a pasta w/veggies salad for a delicious vegetarian picnic dinner. And thawed frozen corn was substituted for fresh without a problem. Thanks again epicurious!

I went to a BBQ last weekend where this was served and I thought it was very good. It went perfect with the flank steak and warm summer afternoon.

I must also give this a one word review: NASTY

As an avid user of this site, and a pretty accomplished cook, I typically take this opportunity to comment on recipes quite seriously. In this case, however, I believe I ony need a single word to describe this dish "GROSS." My biggest regret is that I served it before scrapping it off everyone's plate and throwing out any that remained. P.S. Ciabatta is an airy, crusty bread.

Ciabatta is "Italian Slipper" bread. Very rustic & very chewy. There are 2 recipies for it on this site.

Anyone know what is ciabatta? It wasn't in the dictionary....

There are a lot of comments about this recipe but it doesn't sound like anyone actually tried it! I did, and really liked it. Good combination of colors, flavors, and textures. There is no need to cook the corn first and there is certainly no reason to cook canned kidney beans first!

When I make corn salads, I usually boil/steam the corn (on the ear) for 1 to 2 minutes. It depends on the corn. Some ears have such tiny and sweet kernals that cooking is not necessary. For a different taste, grill the ears to slightly brown the kernals. As for the canned beans, I would definitely cook them for a few minutes.

No, the answer from Ontario does not answer the question. Corn can be scraped off the cob raw or cooked--and usually, if raw, is cooked later, e.g. creamed corn. Since starches have less food value if eaten raw, (though not none) I too wonder. If raw, that should be specified since it is unusual.

In reply to the cook from the Chicago area: In the ingredients list, it says "X cups fresh corn (about two ears)". That answer your question? On a side note, thanks for the wonderful salad recipes. Often as not you don't want anything hot for dinner on a humid day, and at any rate left over side-salad from dinner will happily be consumed at lunch the next day (provided, of course, that it's of a type that lasts well).

Sounds very good, but I have a question...when they say 'fresh' corn, do they mean 'raw' corn off the cob? I didn't notice any instructions to cook the corn and am just wondering. Thanks
