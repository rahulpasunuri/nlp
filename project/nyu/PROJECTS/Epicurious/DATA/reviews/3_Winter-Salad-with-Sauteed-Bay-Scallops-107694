I made the dressing out of white wine vinegar and olive oil and used blood oranges for the salad. Delicious and very easy!

This recipe is a good jumping off point, but I also made some changes-I did not marinate the scallops, I don't like to cook scallops in liquid, I think it makes them rubbery. I just sprinkled them with cayenne pepper and salt, seared them until almost cooked, and then added the "marinade", reducing it to a glaze. I also added a touch of honey to the marinade, as well as sesame oil, honey and cayenne to the dressing. The dressing was very bland as written, but with the changes made we enjoyed this recipe a lot.

I made this as written except with sea scallops. The citrus flavors are wonderful with the scallops after they have been nicely browned on the outside. I loved this recipe.

Blah, blah, blah! It was so bland, I couldn't even finish it. Definitely not making this one again.

This was a very nice salad and so easy to make. I made it as a main course for just two of us. I couldn't find the small bay scallops, which would have been better for a salad but that is minor. I was out of sesame oil, but am looking forward to trying it that way in the future.

yum!! i took the advice of others-tho i made this recipe for just the two of us i made the full amount of dressing (with an added splash of sesame oil) sea scallops instead of bay. a very easy recipe. i served this with Pistachio-crusted pork with plum sauce (recipe on this site), so there was a bit of an asian feel to both.i will definately make this one again!!

I served this as an appetizer for dinner guests and everyone loved it. It is very light in flavor, but refreshing. The Pinot Grigio complimented it as well.

Total Blah! I tried all the suggestions and it was still a total bore. I would never bother making this again.

Yummy! I used sea scallops and the only thing I wished I had done differently was to marinate them longer.

Add more of the ingredients for the marinade than called for. Also marinade for a longer period of time -- I did it for an hour and made sure that I flipped the scallops at the half hour interval.

I made this as directed with the exception of using sea scallops. I did not care for this recipe - neither did my husband. As someone suggested, I added a bit of sesame oil to the dressing and was glad I did. It would have been even duller. I like all the ingredients, but just didn't care for the overall dish for some reason. I can think of so many ways I prefer scallops. Anyway, I'm pretty much in the minority on this one.

This is such a beautiful and delicious salad. I used a half pound of sea scallops instead of bay scallaps and cooked them until the mariade was gone. So yummy!

This recipe is wonderful. We made the full menu in the magazine and I would say this was the hit of the dinner. Wonderful flavor and so fresh. Yum!!

This is absolutely delicious. I made it with a half pound of sea scallops for 2 of us as a light dinner. The combination of flavors were wonderful: bitter greens, sweet scallops, and the lovely citrus. I seared the scallops separately from the marinade. We tried a number of wines with it. The suggested Pinot Grigio could not take the citrus and turned sharp and sour. An Arneis (Italian white from the Piedmont) worked a little better. But what complimented the dish perfectly was a dry (Kabinett) German Riesling. I definitely plan to serve this dish this summer, probably as a first course.

I thought the recipe was excellent, but I did make double the marinade & dressing. I also marinated the scallops for longer (about11/2 hours. All guests seemed happy!

Easy, refreshing. Features the scallops without masking them. We used sea scallops. It may be necessary to make additional vinaigrette.

I was disappointed in this recipe, especially since I adore scallops! There just wasn't anything special about it. Won't make it again.

It appears his rant is based on the 'unkosher' reference. Chill out, Washington.

Does anyone know who Washington D.C. is talking about? Who lied? Excellent recipe... Scallops are by far my fave.

I wish people would keep their RELGION to the themselves and OUT of the ratings. If you don't eat something that find with me. Just don't eat but don't lie about having tried it.

yes, well, bay scallops are unkosher, of course you'll get sick!

It was a very attractive salad, but overall, just okay. The scallops, with the addition of the suggested sesame oil for olive oil in the marinade were good. I might fix them again someday.

Kitty I'm with you! Sesame oil added the flavor needed for the scallops to compete with the citrus and greens. I saueed pignola nuts for an eye appealing presentation and also used mandarin orange segments. I doubled the dressing recipe as it just didn't look like enough. I'm glad I did. Great recipe when strapped for time! Will make it again!

Used this recipe with imitation crab for a budget gourmet meal. Used baby spinach leaves for the greens and threw in some toasted pine nuts for flavor. It was fantastic. Had to double the dressing recipe to have enough, but it was very pretty.

Rather than olive oil I used Sesame oil and skipped the lime. It gave the scallops some "presence" in the salad. Also, mandarins were much easier to use than pithing an orange. A sprinkling of black toasted sesame seeds made a fabulous presentation.

This is a tasty and impressive-looking salad. I used a mixed bag of greens with arugula and added belgian endive for bitterness. The finished product was outstanding, although the scallops didn't add as much flavor as I had hoped for the cost and effort. Also, I halved the dressing recipe as I was only making two servings, but it was not enough. Will double dressing next time.
