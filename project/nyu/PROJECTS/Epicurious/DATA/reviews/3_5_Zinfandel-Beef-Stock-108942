Excellent. Because of the wine additive, it makes a particularly good base for au jus.

This recipe does make a fabulous broth. I too used more wine, less water and simmered for considerably longer than the recommended time. However, it is a very expensive way too make 3 1/2 cups of broth. I figure I spent in excess of $16.00 for the ingredients. As to what to do with the meat from the bones, I used it to make a beef curry.

This is a wonderful base for any gravy.I had to simmer it for seven hours. To spice it up use a little more wine and less water. The beef from the broth is tender and falls off the bone and will use it for beef stew.

This is really fantastic beef stock. Plan to make it a day in advance. I had to let it simmer for about 7 hours.

This a very good stock, and an excellent gravy base, but four forks if it's done my way, only three forks as written. First it needs 1 1/2 cups wine. (Good Zin.) 2 1/2 cups water. It needs to simmer all day, perhaps 7-8 hours. With an hour left to go, I strained the veges and meat, and then I cheated, adding a large spoonful of Beef Demi-Glace. Let simmer one more hour. Wonderful! This will make a wonderful gravy!

This recipe is exceptional and worth the effort. We make this for Christmas every year and it really completes the meal

This was awful!! What a waste of time and effort.

I made this to go with the Rib Roast recipe and found it to be a waste of time and money (although the meat that came off the cross cut shank did make about 10 servings of vegetable beef soup!) I let it simmer an extra two hours and it still was not as reduced as the recipe indicated. The gravy made with this stock was nothing better than could have been achieved with the pan drippings alone.

Oh, baby! I'm not a gravy person, but this was fantastic!

Although I made this for sauce for the rib roast, we found it perfect on its own. That is, the left over sauce and the center cut beef shanks were like braised beef and could be a stand-alone dish. Our rib roast was disappointing - can't find tender beef anymore. However, this "braised beef" was excellent. What do they expect you to do with the meat anyway? Give it out to the dogs?

One fork but would make again? I must have made every mistake in the book. First, I probably used the wrong type of bones. I asked the butcher for soup bones; maybe they needed to be smaller and meatier. Then, I simmered with lid on; stock didn't come close to reducing to 3.5 cups and was watery. Third, when I put rimmed cookie sheet on 2 burners, it did indeed burn--to a blackened crisp! Had to start over in a saucepan. I need another try.

Take the extra time to reduce this into a glace. After original 10 hours simmering, strain out bones and veges, cool, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, defat the cold stock, and bring to the simmer, reduce it by half. Strain and cool again, refrigerate. The resulting product is an unbelieveably rich, concentrated meat glace(jelly). Freeze in small containers and add to soups, sauces, etc.

Worth the work! The flavor was great, though I froze some for future use and then felt the thawed stock had lost some flavor.

Excellent! Worth the time and effort, it really made the gravy "over the top". Next time I'll make a double batch and freeze some for future use.

This is an excellent, straight ahead beef broth. Like any good broth, it takes time. But the results are far better than most any commercial broths. Make sure you use a hearty, big red wine. I used an Australian shiraz.

While this does take some time to prepare, the flavor is worth it. Make a triple batch on a lazy Sunday afternoon so you can have it on hand at anytime without having to worry about spending all day making the dish. The red wine adds great depth to the stock.

I made the stock to use with the Standing Rib Roast receipe. I regret not having prepared the receipe in advance, but the end result was rewarding. It made a wonderful sauce for the rib roast and I had plenty left over. Froze the left overs with the meat cut from the bones (I'd used short ribs) and used later in a beef stew = excellent. I should have tripled the receipe so I'd still have some on hand.

Very good and worth keeping on hand for other beef recipes that require a good stock/gravy. It does take time so be sure you make it at least a day before. I plan on making it and freezing it in two batches.

The stock is actually worth the time. Resultant sauces are beyond belief; the XMas recipe for prime rib plus the sauce using this stock is amazing. Rich, not lumpy, and just bursting with flavor. Do it right, and its worth the effort!

I made this stock as a gravy-base to go with the HERB- AND SPICE-ROASTED BEEF TENDERLOIN instead of the shallot-red wine sauce that I usually make with it. What perfection! Canned/store broth can't come close to homemade stock and the wine added a delicate taste to the gravy that was out of this world. Worth the time to make this yourself and keep the stock on hand.

I am making this recipe as part of the "Standing Rib Roast with Rosemary Thyme Crust" recipe for Christmas dinner. Does anyone have any good suggestions for using the beef?

I made this recipe as a base for French Onion soup, as well as a gravy. I used an inexpensive Merlot instead of the Zinfandel. It was much more flavorful than using canned beef broth and worth the extra time! I added a touch more salt and pepper, and a few shakes of ground coriander. Oh yes, more wine too!
