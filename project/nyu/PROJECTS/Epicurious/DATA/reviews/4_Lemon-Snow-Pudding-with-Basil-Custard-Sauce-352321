Hard for me to make, and not really that good. Maybe if it had turned out like it was supposed to it would be good, so if you want to attempt it - then go for it. I certainly won't try to make this again.

I found this hard to make, strangely flavored, and completely unsatisfying as a dessert. I would much rather have lemon ice cream or lemon meringue pie. I would not make this again.

Honestly, I couldn't get the snow to firm up properly, but I wasn't able to spend time figuring it out -- I just served it a bit runny. It was amazing -- and I served it at a party and everyone was amazed. Very spectacular and original. Would definitely make it again.

I tried this because I was intrigued with the idea of the basil scented custard. Nothing seemed to go right. I was using a hand mixer, and after 20 minutes of beating, I still couldn't get the flat ribbon mentioned in the directions, so I just gave up and decided the texture would be what it would be. I ruined the first batch of custard sauce via wrong burner setting--ended up with scrambled eggs. The second batch was better, but still not perfect. Even with all these problems, the end result was incredible. My guests raved and asked for seconds. What a perfect light summer dessert, especially after a grilled steak dinner. The flavor of the basil custard was divine. Next time, I'll do the custard sauce over a double boiler pan. Not sure what to do to get to that flat ribbon point with the pudding--maybe I'll just get luckier.

I made this with 14g of Australian gelatin (wasn't sure if it set the same) and it turned out wonderfully. Really lovely light dessert - could be served without the custard (I used slices of fresh ginger to flavour mine vs basil). It could have served 8 or more people even with large servings. I had no issues with getting it to fluff up, made the 'snow' exactly as directed. Had some 'snow' leftovers with dulce de leche - wow! I might do another variation with vanilla vs lemon.

I think this is awesome- I love citrus desserts. My husband said it was "intense" but "good". If you have a stand mixer, definitely use it for the pudding, it takes a LONG time. I can't wait to make this for guests on a hot summer day.

Beginning it was a bit daunting but everything turned out beautifully. I made this to bring to a dinner party and it definitely impressed.

This is similar to the recipe I grew up with, oh, so many years ago. It has always been a favorite. Adding basil to the custard sauce was a new twist, and one that I'll continue to use during the summer months. I'm always looking for new ways to use my garden basil. I've made the recipe twice in the past month for two different parties, and it was an outstanding success.

Light and delicious, although a little time consuming to make. Perfect for a brunch or light dinner.

I took the advice from the reviews to use my big mixer for the egg white and gelatin mixing. It still took forever but it worked. I didn't understand that the custard sauce would not thicken to the consistency of a light pudding. I used low-fat milk so that may have influenced the texture or else it was just that...a sauce. (The flavor of the sauce is fabulous. I will make it again to use on pound cake.) I agree that it is not an easy or quick recipe. It has to be followed exactly to be successful and that takes time. It is worth the effort. After enjoying lamb chops and potatoes this was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. The recipe made plenty for 8 people.

I also doubled the recipe and found that it didn't whip to the described volume and consistancy. After some additional chilling it came out great. This is a really fun summer dessert.

Nice and light but it didn't whip up as described. I had to put it back in the frig to chill more after the whites and gelatin were blended. It just didn't thicken. Doubling the recipe probably didn't help...

Perfect dessert to follow bouillabaisse or other hot, garlicky entrees.

I served this for dessert on Easter, after a heavy meal. Everyone raved about it, even my teenaged nephews who generally don't like anything out of the ordinary. My husband and I had the leftovers the next evening. I enjoyed dipping cookies into the custard sauce with tea. Outstanding recipe. Will definitely make again. It is really quite an easy recipe.

This is a neat change of pace! I had the perfect storm of leftover ingredients in the fridge, and am glad I tried it. I only have a rotary mixer, and my wrist got tired so I only whipped the white mixture to double size - still delicious. It reminds me of getting a "foam" on things at fancy restaurants. Definitely do as another reader and add basil leaves for garnish (even strips look pretty) because otherwise it's too pale.

This did take a lot of time. I used a hand mixer and it took 15 minutes just to whip to the right volume. However, it was very good. Light and refreshing. I will make again and use the stand mixer next time.

My grandmother used to serve this at fancy ladies lunches (they dug anything made with gelatin). Steeping the cream with basil is a great update. This is a gorgeous and dreamy dessert. I served it as directed, although I sugared the basil leaves used for garnish (chose small leaves, dipped them in egg white, sprinkled them with sugar and let them dry overnight on a rack). This is a keeper.

I only made the lemon pudding, I did not make the sauce, but I loved it! It's so light, has a delicious fresh lemon flavor, and it's so low calorie (without the sauce of course.) I'll make this again during summer time for a nice cool, light dessert! I made it exactly as directed and it turned out perfect.

This was easy but I didn't think it was very quick. There are a lot of different steps and waiting in between. The result is very good though. The basil custard is different for a dessert, we loved it. Definitely a nice light dessert for spring.

What a riot to see this classic recipe back in the pages of Gourmet. When I was a little girl, we would get to visit my Great Aunt's country club buffet, and this would be the highlight of every trip! The snow is delicious, light and fluffy; the custard is the perfect complement. I made this for Easter a couple of years ago and it got pretty rave reviews. The basil is a new touch - sounds like a good way to update the recipe.
