Overall quite good, though I thought it all tasted better on leafy greens rather than endive. I cooked & julienned the beets 2 days ahead and pickled them the day of, which worked just fine. We found the pickling juice was way too salty and there was about 3/4 of the dressing left over. Would make again with a few modifications.

This is a delicious salad! If you toss the endive, pear and goat cheese with the beets, the salad will not look like the picture because the beets color the ingredients. I added the goat cheese last to keep it white.

Does anyone know how long the pickled beets last in the fridge? I would like to make them for a holiday gift and include the recipe for the salad.

It was good. In the future, I would sprinkle the goat cheese on top after tossing the salad because the cheese crumbles clumped and also made the appearance of the vinaigrette murky and unattractive. I would not slice the pear as thinly, or I would dice it, to keep the pieces from sticking to the endive after tossing. Also, easy on the vinegrette! In my opinion, this makes way to much for the volume of salad...unless you like it drenched.

Great salad very pretty presentation. The beets were spectacular. Even my husband who does not like anything but iceberg asked If I would make it again. It has made the family Christmas menu.

This dish requires time to cook the beets, but is otherwise very easy to make. The combination of tastes is superb. I like beets but was tired of the usual preparations; this is a sofisticated and innovative way of including them in a menu. No ingredient in this recipe is superfluous and nothing is lacking, although one can vary the proportions according to taste and availability.

I first made this salad three years ago for thanksgiving. My family just gobbled it up and they have been asking for it every family occasion. Takes a bit of work but it is well worth it.

A wonderful salad! I served it at a dinner party this past weekend. Everyone loved it. It was a conversation piece, even. When I roasted the walnuts in a small saute pan, I added a bit of sugar and caramelized 'em. It was a nice touch.

Excellent, with a few changes: I used a black peppercorn soft cheese,and left out the walnuts. The peppercorns added the crunch that was needed.

Fantastic blend of flavors! Served 1 inch high goat cheese disks encrusted with toasted pine nuts on mixed greens. Diced the beets to sprinkle over all . Also added 2T of leftover cranberry-orange relish to the dressing (thanks to previous reviewer), and put all vinaigrette ingredients into the blender. Pickling juice and beets were really worth the mess.

What a delightful medley of flavors. We served this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. The beets were superb. Will definitely make this salad again and again. I, too, used fresh grown arugula and nasturtium leaves and flowers and it was delicious. I also added a bit of triple cranberry sauce to the vinagrette.

Fabulous! The pear isn't necessary to make the salad complete. Or you could substitute it with apple, mandarin, raspberry or other "salady" fruit.

I can't give this dish all four forks because so far, i've only made the beets. The beets came out very nicely though. I made extra just to keep and snack on. The sweet and sour tastes of the pickling juice was a bit too strong and the spices weren't strong enough. Next time, I'd reduce the vinegar to 1/3 cup, the sugar to 1/4 cup, increase the water and double the spices.

Guilty, I have to make this recipe again as I could not obtain the Belgium Endive and had to make do with fresh grown arugula and nasturtium leaves and flowers. I also halved the recipe. Despite these two discrepancies, I know this recipe is a winner whether you choose to follow the recipe or my necessary version. Sooo goood!!!!

I made this dish for a thanksgiving side dish and everyone loved it. It is pretty and has so many wonderful flavors. Taking the suggestion of another reviewer, I treated the beets to salt, pepper and a slash of balsamic vinegar in their foil pouch before roasting. Also, all our stores were out of endive, so I added extra spinach and some sliced romaine. this recipe is a definite keeper!

I had something like this in a ritzy resturant and they used a orange/citrus dressing and that was WONDERFUL. I made something similar at home with a raspberry vinegrette, bitter, very flavorful greens and goat cheese. Good enough for company!! Yum!

the dressing was ok. The beets were outstanding. I used less endive (just one) and I used a red leaf lettuce. Combined all in salad bowl. Served beets on top

We served this for dinner with slices of Baked Ham and freshly baked rolls. It was great!
