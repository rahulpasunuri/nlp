Delicisous but I would be careful precooking the asparagus enough before putting it into the lasagna. I have made it twice and the asparagus got a bit woody in some places. I will look for the baby once next time or I will try broccoli.

An excellent dish, very versitile. I also went with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. But try this!: Skip the step about drizzling tomato sauce and prepare a tomato cream sauce with: 1Tbl Tomato Paste 2 Tbl Heavy Cream Fresh Basil lemon juice 1oz Vodka Heat it up to liberate some alcohol then chill for an hour. drizzle over lasagne when served. Gives great color and the sweet/sour taste is a good counterpoint to the richness of the dish.

Have made this recipe many times. Yes it is time consuming but worth it on a cold day. Have made with and without bacon, Just added more asparagus.

Thought this was a delicious and quick recipe. I used smoked mozzarella instead of swiss cheese, and homemade tomato sauce with lots of fresh basil added to it. Used 6 no-boil lasagne sheets, which really cut down the prep time, but had to leave the lasagna in the oven longer (about 40 mins.) Sauteed the asparagus (which I cut before cooking) with a little salt, pepper and olive oil, instead of steaming. Would definitely use the smoked cheese again.

Not the most exciting thing in the world, but satisfying. A little disappointing after all fo that stirring and grating and steaming and chopping. Needs herbs or something. The next time I make it, I'm going to add a layer of spinach ... maybe broccoli too.

I MADE THIS WHEN IT FIRST APPEARED IN BON APPETIT. I BELIEVE THE ORIGINAL CALLED FOR PROSCIUTTO INSTEAD OF CANADIAN BACON (OR I MAY HAVE SUBSTITUTED). IN ANY CASE IT WAS DELICIOUS!

I was surprised after reading the reviews that this was just an average recipe. We thought it was kind of bland and heavy and I didn't think the bacon was a good blend. I'm afraid it was a big dissapointment.

I would make this dish again and again, but would leave it in the Oven longer then 20 min.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but thought the smoky flavor of the Canadian bacon tended to overwhelm. Next time, I would use just half a cup.

This dish is wonderfully refreshing!! I gave some to a neighbor who gave a taste to another person and I'm now busy telling them to buy a computer and get on line to enjoy Epicurious! They loved the recipe and all wanted a copy.

Prepared this for Mother's Day famiily gathering. Everyone really liked it. It is easy to prepare but out-of-the-ordinary. Excellent.
