I wasn't sure what to expect with this, because the peanuts seemed like a weird addition to me. However, I am really glad that I tried it, because it was great.

Great for a simple and fast weeknight supper. This was quite different from our usual fare but made for a nice change. We usually lean toward italian or asian-style dishes so we might not make again real soon, but would not rule out. I was uncertain what to serve it with though (we did noodles and salad)-any suggestions??

This worked very well indeed. this recipe was very quick and easy to make. I put the cutlets in the oven while I cooked the salsa then put the salsa over the cutlets for about 10 minutes while I prepared the rest of the meal. VG

Overall good. I read the comments about doubling the salsa ingrediants and it was good advise. I didn't have peanuts so I chopped almonds and added peanut butter. I blended into the sauce and it gave a good flavor.

My husband rated this as a "definitely make again." I tripled the amount of the sauce ingredients. Took longer than I anticipated to reduce (I let it get very thick), but worth the wait. Delicious. The peanuts and cilantro really make it all come together.

Excellent recipe- the turkey cutlets were delicious, and I loved the pan salsa- we should have doubled that!

I thought this recipe sounded intriguing, but my husband and I did not care for it at all. To me the sauce tasted like tomatoes and vinegar. There was no complexity to the flavor. Perhaps I've become spoiled on salsa recipes from my collection of Rick Bayless cookbooks, but I was not at all pleased with this recipe.

I LOVED this recipe!! This is such a fresh tasting, wonderful dish!!!!!! I doubled the amount of meat to serve 4, but TRIPLED the amount of sauce because I had a feeling I would want more....Sure enough, it was the perfect amount once I cooked it down to thicken it. I questioned the vinegar and peanuts, but use them...use them!! I highly recommend this recipe....My husband and 12 year old daughter loved this also. So fresh tasting and easy, easy to make! Also, as a bonus, it's very colorful and visually appealing. I served it with whole wheat spiral noodles and a salad. Delicious!!

This recipe was easy to make and delicious, even with winter tomatoes. Can't wait to try it with fresh tomaotes from the garden.
