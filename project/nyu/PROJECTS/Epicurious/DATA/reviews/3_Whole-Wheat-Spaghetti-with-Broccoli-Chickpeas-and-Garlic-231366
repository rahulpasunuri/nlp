This was great with some tweeking. I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest and a couple tablespoons of lemon juice. I also added some white wine and I didn't drain the chickpeas, simmered until all was blended well. I served this with Trader Joes rosemary chicken legs and whole wheat capellini. Delish!

I really like this. I think that the key to this recipe is using fresh things. I don't know if using frozen broccoli would undermine the flavors. I used fresh broccoli, kale, and tomato. I upped the garlic as people suggested (about 3/4 head) and just cooked the broccoli and kale in salted water (I worked in batches doing broccoli then kale then the pasta and using the same water so I wouldn't use so many pans and could perfectly cook each). I cooked the veg until bright green but not mushy. I did add a little lemon and parm at the end but I think even without it the meal would be good (maybe just less cohesive).

I've made this one several times, as it's healthy and easy. I used minced garlic scape instead of garlic, because I had one in the fridge. It is essential to serve this one with lemon, otherwise it's just meh.

I wrote a review in 2005, but since then I've also made this with chopped kale, which I have a lot of in my garden. Equally delicious and still love this recipe. I'll have to try it with kale and cannellini beans next.

This is just OK but super quick to put together. I added some baby plum tomatoes quartered once the broccoli was off the heat. Served with fresh egg papardelle and grated cheddar. I wouldn't go out of my way making this.

A good way to liven up this recipe is to squeeze a lemon over it at the last minute and toss in some parmesan cheese. And make sure you use good olive oil for drizzling-something fresh and grassy-tasting.

Delicious, healthy, easy, and quick! I made half a batch and a few minor adjustments, such as using about 2/3 of the oil called for and not adding the salt. This meal was very satisfying and filling. I will definitely make this again.

As others have said, this is a good recipe - not the best meal I've ever had but enjoyable for what it is. I found it quite flavorful, though I may have oversalted the pasta water. What I like about it is that it's fairly healthy, it's a great pantry cleaner, and I think it will do well with substitutions and additions to shake things up. I used linguine because that's what I had; I added some cauliflower because I didn't have enough broccoli (although I wouldn't do this again if I didn't have to; it tasted fine, but the broccoli was much, much better). I can imagine adding in some cherry tomatoes, more red pepper flakes, olives or mushrooms - basically whatever's in the house that needs using up!

So, you're long-lost high school friend who is now vegan is coming over for dinner and you don't know what to make... fortunately, you stumble across this recipe, which saves the day and completely surprises you. The first time I made this, it was AWESOME. I used almost 2x the garlic, half fresh chopped and half minced from a jar. Also, I used Chili flakes instead of red pepper flakes. The second time, I used all minced garlic from a jar and the flavor just wasn't as good. Also, I forgot to throw in the 1/2 cup reserved boiling water until the last minute - so the pasta didn't get to simmer with the all of the flavors as thoroughly. It was still okay, but not great. *Making sure to follow all steps of the recipe, using lots 'o' fresh garlic, and substituting chili flakes for the red pepper flakes makes this recipe fantastic!*

Good basic recipe. Very easy to adjust the proportions to suit your taste. A last drizzle of olive oil, squeeze of lemon and dash of sea salt along with freshly grated parmesan is delicious. I used canned canelli beans and whole wheat ziti because that's what I had on hand, and added lemon zest while cooking the broccoli.

This was delicious...I fed it to a house full of meat eaters and there weren't even leftovers. I used a ton of Sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes, which gave it a nice kick (we likes it spicy in mah house). I also added some lemon pepper and a few pinches of allspice while I sauteed the broccoli (i used fresh, not frozen btw) and it ended up with a really good flavor.

What I did to counter act the lack of flavor was add 3/4 of a cup of cherry tomatoes cut in half into the pan with the broccoli, garlic and chickpeas. They added a perfect flavor, and it was wonderful. Also a side note, this meal tastes even better after it sits a while. I left mine in my fridge for 2 days and took it to work for lunch, and it tasted better than the day I made it!

Simple and nutritious. It's humble, but it's perfect for those nights when you have more important things to worry about than eating. It took me 10 minutes to make (and probably less time to eat) . . . Don't forget the cheese and lemon.

A wholesome recipe that everyone seems to like. I made this for a dinner where I had two pastas-a half vegetarian, half meat-loving crowd. Everyone wanted more of this one.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but noticed that someone asked for recommendation on whole wheat spaghetti brand. Whole Foods makes a good line of whole wheat pastas, that was actually taste-tested by the SF Chronicle (it won). The only other brand I've ever eaten before was Trader Joes and it was terrible

I love this dish! It's incredibly easy, quick, and healthy. A dash of EVOO, salt, and parmesan cheese at the end is a must-- enjoy!

Was it the most delicious thing I ever ate? No. Was it an excellent balance of a healthy (if not low calorie) meal that tasted pretty good? Yes. It was easy, took me maybe 20 minutes total. I added half a sweet onion which I think was an important addition to my point of view. I softened it in oil before putting in the garlic. The lemon and extra oil to finish are CRUCIAL. With them it's a plenty tasty dish worth repeating and so easy that I can recreate it without any recipe. KEY!

We enjoyed this recipe. It is bland, but makes a good last minute dinner or lunch. We use fresh broccoli and cauliflower and add extra lemon and cheese.

I was surprised to find the negative comments here. We all found this dish to be so tasty and unique. Used w.w. fettuccine instead. I think the spaghetti just wouldn't stand up. (Omitted red pepper flakes, too.) The benefit of using frozen broccoli is the obvious convenience--keeping the prep/cook time down and reducing the number of dishes to be cleaned! Since I use a cast iron skillet for this, breaking up the frozen broccoli in the pan isn't an issue.

I love each of the ingredients in this dish, but did not enjoy the dish at all. I did not use the lemon, but even with some great Parmesan cheese, this dish failed. It was bland and the flavors just didn't seem to come together.

Rating: 3
This is just fine - given the ingredients I didn't expect it to be overwhelming. However, I would substitute 1 bunch fresh broccoli chopped, 20 oz can chickpeas, 3/4 cup pasta water. This would permit me to use the whole 12 oz box of whole-wheat spaghetti.

Not a fan of this one. I was intrigued by the combination, but found the chickpeas just didn't do well in this recipe. I added some roasted red pepper to no avail -- the flavors just didn't seem to take with the pasta. It is much better with parmesan and squeezed lemon, but there are much better suggestions for whole wheat pasta out there.

Despite following other people's suggestions and adding several extras and lots of salt, I found this dish extremely bland. Thought I like the idea of whole wheat pasta, in practice it was dense and odd. Maybe it is an acquired taste.

Very easy. I snuck a taste towards the end and I was a little disappointed. When I served the pasta I added a pinch of salt, parmesan, and olive oil and it ended up tasting really good! I loved the chick peas too!

This is pretty good. A bit dry. I used fresh brocciflower which turned out delicious from the oil, garlic and pepper flakes. The chickpeas made it interesting. I was surprised how good the whole-wheat spaghetti tasted. I had my doubts, but once it was topped with some good olive oil, it blended nicely.

Would someone tell me what brand of whole wheat pasta DOESN'T taste "leaden" (as one reviewer commented)?

Made this earlier this week, and even my husband (not the biggest broccoli fan) loved it. It was a big success in our house. I probably added a little extra garlic and red pepper. I think that the parmesan and lemon really added something, but had the leftovers for lunch today without them and it was still yummy. This will be part of our regular rotation. So easy, too -- what's not to like?

Blah and boring. Maybe it would be better with the parmesan cheese at the end. I forgot to add the salt with the broccoli, but I added it at the end. Almost flavorless.

This is so easy and so wonderfully tasty for a weeknight dinner. And healthy too. We loved the whole wheat pasta here.

My fiancee and I have made this twice now as a weeknight dinner, and will continue to do so. We used whole wheat penne instead of spaghetti. Definitely use fresh broccoli... also, we doubled the recipe so we had lots of leftovers for lunch the next day. Not to mention to get rid of the 1 lb box of pasta, so as not to have a half-used open box sitting in the pantry. Great recipe.

Savory! A very comfortable & easy vegitarian meal. I used the shell suggestion, and yes, it held the garbanzos nicely - Garbanzos have never tasted so good to me as in this recipe! Very satisfying. I added some of the pasta water as suggested, but let it cook out and everything's wonderfully tender and ready for a splash of olive oil.

My husband thinks the recipe calls for too much chickpeas, but he eats around them. We don't like the leaden texture of whole wheat pasta, so use our regular favorite brand, but I've made this several time and will do so again tonight. A really simple, quick, satisfying & healthy dinner!

Divine simplicity! Absolutely the best way to eat broccoli. Peter Zambri of Zambri's restaurant here in Victoria makes a very similar dish, which I tried to recreate. I think I did well; sorry, Peter. I used a small shell-shaped pasta to capture the chickpeas and bits of broccoli - this is not a spaghetti recipe! I used fresh broccoli (peeled stems and florets) chopped about the size of the chickpeas, which a par-steamed before adding to the pan. I also added some finely chopped onion. Use a good olive oil and do not skimp on it or the salt. Topped with a squeeze of lemon and some freshly grated Asiago cheese. Sublime! A great recipe to serve your vegetarian friends as the pasta and chickpeas form a complete protien. I will make this regularly.

Yummy. I agree with the fresh broccoli remarks. The only benefit of frozen is that it makes this dish "from the pantry" and it's quicker. Everyone from age 2-32 liked this.

I agree with all the previous reviews. This recipe is easy (although I do not know why you would not use fresh broccoli), and rather bland. We used the cheese to add flavor, but will use more and different herbs and spices the next time.
