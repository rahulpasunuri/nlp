This has been our traditional turkey since the recipe came out. We serve withSouthwest Corn Bread Stuffing with Corn and Green Chilies and substiture James McNair's Mexican Cornbread. Always look forward to this recipe.

I cooked this recipe exactly and these were my results: A very moist turkey, a gravy that was not zippy but straight up spicy so I had to add a lot of chicken broth to cut the spice for the guests, and a lot of extra glaze that I'm not sure what to do with, but it's awesome. We saved the veges from the pan to do something else with later, because it was plentiful and tasty. I'd probably try another recipe next time.

This is the best, juciest and flavorful turkey ever. If you like spicy food you will love this recipe, is not hot spacy but just full of flavor.

I made this in 2001 when it came out in Bon Appetit. My son still talks about it and ask me to make it again this year. It was that good.

This is by far the BEST turkey I have ever had. I made it exactly as directed (except I put a cut up orange and some thyme into the cavity of the bird) and it came out with the most juicy, slightly citrus-y turkey ever. I didn't make the gravy because we ran out of time but I will try it next time. Fabulous!

Great recipe that the entire family enjoys. It has become our new Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner tradition.

I suddenly had to make a full Thanksgiving meal for 7. My first. My husband said it was the best turkey he ever had. Added just some of the naked oranges to the pan drippings while cooking, but otherwise was pretty close to the recipe (measuring by eye mostly). Was very yummy!!! Served with Sage & Goat Cheese mashed potatoes, roasted butternut squash risotto, and I don't remember what else I made, but it was all good! Naked Limes, are mojito material in my neighborhood!

Turkey came out good, but wasn't sure chipotle flavor complemented either the turkey or the other dishes in our meal. I put an extra t of chipotle in and maybe was too much because also incorporated leftovers from glazing (used glaze instead of basting liquid from roasting pan to baste) so there was a lot of glaze in gravy. Brined turkey so was moist, that was not a plus or minus as far as this recipe was concerned. Did not think citrus flavor was too pronounced, thought was good. All in all, was happy, but there's so many good recipes out there yet to try, and so few Thanksgivings!

This is a wonderful recipe! I have never liked turkey but now make this every year for Thanksgiving. Extremely moist and great flavor. For the over-70 family members I still make the traditional gravy. They love the turkey but don't care for the gravy.

Turkey was okay, though the taste of the glaze was not very pronounced. The gravy was not enjoyed by all- very distinctive citrus taste.

One of my guests called it the 'reference turkey'. Moist & flavorful, simply perfect.

I concur with the other viewers on this site! All I can say is WOW! This was the most moist turkey I have ever had and packed with so much flavor. What an amazing recipe!! Will definitely make this again. Only negative was that it did take the bird a little longer to reach 175 degrees than what the recipe suggested. I had a 20 pounder and I did not stuff it and still ended up cooking it for an extra 1/2 hour passed the time it had called for for the stuffed bird. But no worries, it was WELL worth the wait!

I made this turkey for the first time 2 years agoand it was a HUGE success. So much so that I've been asked to make the turkey every since. I recommend adding an extra teaspoon of chipolte and throwing tangerines into the mix for equal parts orange, lime and tangerine. The gravy is to die for.

I have made this turkey for a number of years now, and it is a hit everytime. Stuff it with the Poblano Chile and Pumpkin Seed Stuffing, also found on this site, and you will have an instant winner!

I always cook both turkey and ham because I don't like turkey. i tried this recipe and this is now our traditional holiday turkey. NO MORE HAM FOR ME! This is the best, everyone loves it at my house.

We have made this for the last two Thanksgivings. I'm tempted to do something new this year - but this is just so good. We serve with a jalepeno corn stuffing. Awesome.

Execellent change of pace for roast chicken

Although we love our traditional holiday turkey, we are looking forward to the next opportunity to make this again. The spicy glaze and gravy is awesome. We added the rest of the chipotles to the stuffing so there was lots of spice, but not too much. The naked limes helped to flavour our Ceasars.. probably wouldn't use them to garnish a guest's drink though!

I thought the butter, honey, thyme and especially the citrus flavors came through well. I was disappointed that the meat did not have more of that classic chipotle taste. I did not make the gravy.

To Stacie in West Chester, Ohio What to do with 13 limes? Might I suggest MARGARITAS!!!

The best Turkey and gravey I've tasted. Not too spicey, but it gave your mouth a nice buzz after eating. I also brinned the turkey for twelve hours with kosher salt to make it that much more tender and juicey.

Very good and very moist. Not as spicy as I thought it would be. The gravy was the spicest part, but also sweet. Very yummy. Since the glaze has sugar in it, it is very important to keep the turkey covered til the very end, as stated in the recipe. (Yes, I uncovered earlier thinking it would take longer to brown - forgot about the sugar - lucky I was checking frequently!)

I made this for thanksgiving. It was well received. I loved the flavor, but now I have 13 naked limes to find something to do with.

I made the glaze and gravy for a turkey breast as part of a Southwestern Thanksgiving menu and it was delicious! The sweet flavors dominate so next time I would increase the chipotles.
