Earth to Lucy_1 from TUlsa, Ok. Why don't you get off your computer high horse and help people when they have a question instead of treating them like idiots. Did you stop to think that Pat was a newbe and didn't realize that the highlighted tarter sauce text was the link to the recipe? Help people don't berate them with your sarcastic remarks. Did you know about the hightlighted text being a link when you first started on-line? I doubt it.

Tasty and easy to make. I made it with sweet-and-sour sauce and it was delicious -- I used the sauce found under 'Crispy Fish with Sweet-and-Sour Sauce'

I made this dish for some friends using my moms electric fryer and it turned out great. I even forgot to make the batter and let it sit first but it still tasted amazing. Going to try it again letting the batter rest. A must if you love shrimp.

Got rave reviews on this one especially the Tartar sauce. I was told it was the best they ever had. I also used this batter on vegetables. Much better than using bread crumbs.

Great recipe, but be sure to use a full flavored ale (I use Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or Anchor Steam beer), as it makes all the difference in the world. I used a light beer tonight and it was horrible!

Earth to Pat Parkes:If you pay attention to the recipe, you will see very clearly, a link to click on to the Tartar Sauce on another page. Simple!

Recipe looks great, but the method is lacking. You say the tartar sauce is the batter. There is no tartar sauce recipe. Confusing to say the least. Please reply. Thanks. By the way, thisis my firstvisit and am impressed!!! Pat Parkes Also is there a fat content figure? or do we just indulge!!
