This is a winner! I used all Savoy cabbage and subbed in Vegenaise for the mayo to make it vegan. I used 1/3 of the ingredients listed and it was perfect for four (although we all wished there was more). Will make all summer long!

I am almost always asked for this recipe when I take it anywhere -- one of my sisters told me about this salad! YUM. Does make quite a bit, but great for crowds!

what a yummy, easy, and different coleslaw recipe! I did halve it, and had way more than enough for 6 people, great combo of the cucumber, cabbage, other veggies and the hot sauce. Yum!

I liked this slaw. I thought it was very pretty with the different types of cabbage and tomatoes. Also, the dressing is slightly tinted from the tabasco. Very attractive. It was a bit sweet for my taste, and I squeezed lime juice onto my serving. Also, I would like it spicier. I think a chopped jalapeno or two would be just the kick it needs. It is a huge recipe - I made half, and am happy I did.

This is a huge recipe for slaw. It is a good one and deserves a place in the recipe box. Made it as written didnt change a thing and it got great comments from my friends. to other reviewers! Please dont review recipes and give them bad marks after you have changed half the ingredients with something else. You are no longer making or tasting the same recipe. Sure spice it up a bit more or salt and pepper to taste, but if it calls for sour cream dont use cottage cheese, or if it calls for bell pepper dont use jalepenos. Do the recipe taste the rescipe review the recipe.

This is a good slaw recipe. However, it makes a ton of slaw!!! I had to cut the recipe in half and it filled a huge rubbermaid container. Half the reciepe will easily serve 8! Slaw is a side, certainly not a main meal. With the serving numbers they are listing here you would have to have half your plate covered in slaw! 4lbs of cabbage is a lot.

Good but not spicy enough for me either. I added a cocktail of different hot sauces to give it some zing, and then it was quite nice. There was a bit too much dressing for my taste.

This was an easy recipe to make. My 10 year old son and I made together. We used preshredded cole slaw cabage blend for a little less mess. We also added a dash more Tabasco. We than chilled it overnight in the fridge.The results were great.

I have made this slaw for a few parties, and it is usually well received. It never tastes quite the same as the first time I made it...which was the best! I will try the apples and maybe a bit of red and yellow peppers.

This was good,not great, but good. Used light sour cream for 1/3 of the Mayo. Next time will make it more Southwestern by adding corn, cilantro, and jicama and substituting Salsa & Chipotle for the Tabasco.

This is an excellent staple slaw, particularly for gatherings. It's not too crazy. Simply an elegant presentation of a humble dish. Was a hit at our party. I added orange, yellow & red peppers for color. Next time will try granny smith apples as earlier suggested. A keeper!

Good recipe and easy to adjust for taste. After making it a couple of times, I have added apples, jicama, and fennel. All are good additions.

So delicious and so easy! Dressing was a little 'not spicy enough' for my taste, so I just added more Tobasco. Otherwise - perfect!

This makes a beautiful multi-colored salad. Be warned: it makes a huge amount. I didn't have a bowl big enough to toss the veggies so I mixed it up in my kitchen sink! The tomatoes seemed an odd ingredient for cole slaw, but I went ahead and put them in and was glad I did. The dressing is tasty, but not particularly spicy. If you really want spicy, up the amount of hot sauce.

I loved this recipe. I usually find that most coleslaw recipes are too bland. I used apple cider vinegar and grated a green apple into the coleslaw. Delicious.

Our entire office really enjoyed this. It is just a touch spicy and overall a very savory, easy dish to prepare for a crowd.
