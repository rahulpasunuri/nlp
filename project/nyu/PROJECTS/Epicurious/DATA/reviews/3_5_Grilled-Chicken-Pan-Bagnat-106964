Please, would you be kind enough not to call this sanwich pan bagnat?! It might be a good recipe, but this is certainly not pan bagnat. I am from the french riviera and ate pan bagnat my whole childhood, so did my husband, who is from Nice, capital of the pan bagnat. The recipe is very simple, does not contain tuna, nor chicken , nor capers... it only contains spring and summer vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucomber, radishes, hard boiled eggs, anchovies preserved in olive oil, fresh spring onions, fresh fava beans, green bell pepers and basil, no lemon juice, no vinegar. If you must have some acidity in it, prefer red wine vinegar, and that's it. The bread should be a simple roll, or a good baguette, if you cannot find a nice big roll, such as portugese roll maybe. I hope someone will try the traditional pan bagant and like it. In the meantime be careful with names! :-)

I made this to take on our maiden voyage in our new little Airstream. It was a perfectly delicious and easily packed lunch for the first day out! I used 8 oz. rounds of sourdough bread and pulled the soft bread from both the top and bottoms before assembling the sandwiches. This recipe is a wonderful do-ahead meal for hikers, campers, skiers, fishermen or for backyard pincic fare.

I made this sandwich for lunch with friends and everyone really enjoyed. The chicken has great flavor and the vinagerette keeps the sandwich moist. I made it the day before and it turned out perfect!

I made this 7 years ago when it first appeared in Bon Appetit. I lost the recipe and could never find it on Epicurious. I wasn't crazy about the sandwich but I LOVED the chicken preparation. I just made the sandwich again and this time it was GREAT. I cut the oil down to a few tablespoons and that really kicked the flavor up and I marinated the capers in the dressing which took away some of their bite. I used ciabattaa bread whick was a lot thinner and much better than the super bready sourdough round. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs so more flavor and no pounding. Seriously incredible mmmmm. Will be making this again and again.

This was excellent. Prefect for hot summer time meal. The chicken marinade is out of sight. Will be making this again, again and again!

Great! Will definitely make again. Good receipe for do ahead. Next time I may also discard soft interior of bottom halves of bread. I amy also try a flavored bread--olive. Did this on our sailboat so I just pressed down on the foiled wrapped sandwich a few times instead of putting a weight on it. All worked well.

I made this recipe for Mother's day. I don't know what I did wrong but it was horrible. I followed the instructions to the letter. All of my guests were equally unimpressed. I made this along with the Green bean and fingerling potato salad (equally umimpressive). Oh well.

I made this following the recipe exactly and ended up with an absolutely fabulous summer meal. I can't wait to try it again, using different breads, etc.,.

I leave out the anchovy paste, pan fry the chicken, and use French bread. Fabulous! Easy do ahead, and filling.

This is by far one of my favortie recipes. It is so verstile to take anywhere, great for a day on the boat and so filling and flavorful. You couldn't ask for a better sandwich!

Though this was really good, the lemon seemed a little strong. I would substitute white wine vinegar.

This is a lot of work for a supper for two. But great if cooking for a larger group. We like the sandwiches very much, but will cook the chicken on days when the grill is already fired up. Chicken keeps in fridge for several days so sandwiches can be made another day.

Hubby and I loved this recipe. I'm iffy on capers so I cut amount in half. My kids didn't want the sandwich so I just gave them the grilled chicken and they inhaled it! Will make again soon - great summer dinner.

I wanted to try this before making for a picnic/party. I couldnt find the 'special crock of herbs' in my grocery store so I sub'd for regular Italian seasoning and I couldnt find the right kind of bread so I chose a good Italian bread. It turned out great and I proudly took it to the family reunion this past summer. --my kids even liked it and that's saying a lot.

Instead of sourdough bread I used olive bread. I made it with calamati olives, sundried tomatoes and added goat cheese after weighing it down. It kind of represented a putanesca. I took it to the beach and my friends thought it was fantastic! The best sandwich I ever made!

This dish was fabulous. My family raved about it and will definitely request it over and over. I made rosemary focaccia to use as the bread and also served it with a white herb and sundried tomato cheese. I didn't have time to refrigerate...so just wrapped in film and pressed hard. Next time I would make twice as much marinade. Heavenly, heavenly. I would even make this for my chef instructor!

I made this for a 4th of July picnic and they were a huge hit. I used basil leaves instead of the lettuce, which added flavor.

I made these for a party (30 people) held outside. I used regular loaves of fresh French bread, then cut them into three inch sandwiches. They were a huge success.

A wonderful make-ahead picnic option! All my guests raved over these sandwiches. My 9 year old son said I had to make this again. He especially liked the chicken & wants me to prepare chicken breasts that way for other recipes. Choosing (or baking) really good bread is essential.

I stood out in the rain to grill the chicken! It was so worth it. I left out the capers (don't like them) and refrigerated the sandwiches for only one hour. Took them right from the fridge and ate them. They were absolutely delicious. You don't have to wait for sunshine or a picnic, just make them!!!

I love this. We used to toast the bread and take the whole garlic cloves to grate it on the portuguese white corn bread in our version.. The toasted bread would mince the garlic. when the olive oil would get drizzled in, it was magic... Otherwise, it is a lot like the pan bagnat we made with either tuna or chicken. This is summer to me.

Great sandwich, very easy to make, was just perfect for a picnic lunch! I used a rosemary garlic sourdough loaf which really complemented all the different layers of flavor in the sandwich. I substituted tapenade for the anchovy paste (didn't have any), and it turned out great. Also added some roasted peppers and cheese. Definitely a keeper!

We really enjoyed this sandwich. It's great to make ahead. I made it once with provolone cheese too but the next time I made it without and we didn't even miss the taste. Instead of sourdough bread, I use large, crusty rolls.

I made a reduction out of the marinade and combined that and the oil/garlic/anchovy paste and lemon with low fat mayo as a spread for the sandwich. That worked well. This was very easy and had great flavour.
