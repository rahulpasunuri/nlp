Simple, delicious & beautiful on the plate as well. Farm raised, fresh Nebraska lamb made this dish one of the best meals I've ever prepared. I made no adjustments to ingredients, sometimes the simple recipes are the best.

Quick and easy, delicious as written. Served with a blood orange salad and brussels sprouts. I am confused by the review of Ange1221 mentioning vinegar. There is no vinegar in this recipe.

Very good indeed. I used 2, 1/2 lb lamb chops, 4 minutes on each side medium-high (7 out of 10). Salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, rosemary and garlic-- all diced, mixed with olive oil, spread on with a spoon on each side, crushed into the meat. Unbelievably good with nice glass of Cabernet, and all (including wine) for around $20. Will definitely be adding this to my weekly menu. We both remarked how we could not even come close to a dish that good in a restaurant for under 70 a piece. My only addition would have been some nice sautéed mushrooms, and perhaps a tomato and feta salad on the side. Wonderful dish.

Excellent! We used fresh rosemary (which we adore) and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only difference was that I used a balsamic vinagrette to marinate instead of the vinegar. Quick and so so Yummy!

I usually grill my lamb chops on my outdoor grill, but since it's snowing again, I opted for this recipe. Taste is great! Since I had nice, 2" loin chops which usually have fat on edges, I removed all excess fat to avoid smelling up the house from indoor cooking. Reference comments by reviewers about using dried rosemary when fresh isn't available, my recommendation is to use high quality crushed rosemary and add a bit of olive oil for the rub. The crushed rosemary doesn't harden if mixed with the olive oil.

I'm a big fan of wet rubs versus dry rubs, so I added virgin olive oil to create a paste. Definitely use fresh rosemary...the dried stuff will be extra prickly and detracts from the texture. I would also add a little bit of sugar to bring out the flavour of the lamb chops, and a little bit of soy sauce that can soak into the meat. Marinate for 1 hr plus...30 min won't be enough. Fatty lamb chops will yield an extra tender chop. Goes great with Jasper White's cranberry relish, (also on this site), chianti, and mashed Japanese sweet potatoes (the ones with the purple skin. cook with ginger and rock sugar, then mash and add two tablespoons of butter and some honey to taste). It makes for a very flavorful and balanced meal.

Just made this for a very special person for his 50th birthday...he raved about them. I added a little soy sauce and olive oil to the garlic and rosemary mixture to make a paste to spread on both sides of the chops and let them sit for a couple of hours before cooking; served them with pan roasted red potatoes from BA 1/89 and green beans with hazelnuts. Fabulous.

I would suggest using fresh rosemary ONLY. The dried rosemary is not the type of herb you want to use when cooking something so quickly. It stays hard and burns too quickly. This dish was tasty but not amazing, especially for the cost of lamb. 2 1/2 forks. I used 1.25 inch thick loin chops and cooked them for 4 minutes on one side and then 3 minutes on the other. I finished them under the broiler for about a minute. I would suggest marinading for at least one hour or adding 1/3 cup of red wine to the marinade. The red pepper flakes make the dish interesting, but it lacks depth of flavor. This is a very simple and quick dish to make, which is great.

It was so simple and fast. Good for when your strapped for time. As the two forks state, liked it , didn't love it.

We are lamb-lovers and made this one yesterday. It was one of the best meals we had in a long time. And so easy!! We couldn't get rib chops so substitute loin chops. These worked perfectly, obviously the cooking time was a little longer.

This was a wonderful and easy way to prepare lamb. We served it with a rich cabernet sauce which really enhanced an already fabulous dish! This is definitely something to do for someone / something special!

This is the easiest and tastiest recipe I have ever used for lamb chops. It was tasty and your suggestion of Merlot was taken, except we served white Merlot instead of red. Went great with the lamb chops.

This dish is so easy to make, but is also delicious!! I can't believe a recipe this simple could also be company-worthy, but it definitely is. I loved it with mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies - yum!

What a wonderful recipe!! I had never before attempted to make lamb chops and was blown away by this delicious and easy (yes easy) recipe. I followed the suggestion of mashed potatoes and green beans along with a Pine Ridge Merlot. It was by far the best lamb dish I have ever had!! I have already shared the recipe with 3 friends. Thank you!!
