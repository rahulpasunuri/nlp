Excellent pico de gallo!! A couple of minor adjustments: (1) I purchase a can of chipotles in adobo sauce then whirl the whole thing up in the mini food processor. I store the puree in the fridge and use it whenever needed. In this case I use 1 tbs. (2) I used balsamic vinegar and appreciated the mellow flavor.

Very delicious - and simple. Used 1/2 serrano pepper instead of canned chipotle. Felt fresh was a better fit with Pico de Gallo.

This was really good - I will definitely make it again. I will probably double the recipe as we are tomato lovers. Went great with the baja fish tacos.

This was very good! I will make this from now on when we have any type of tacos. I doubled the recipe, but the chipotle peppers that I used made the pico de gallo super spicy, next time I will remove 1/2 of the seeds before mincing. Otherwise this is a great recipe.

Delicious and easy to make - nice flavors - not extra-ordinary, though. Served with Baja Fish Tacos, Pibil-Style Pork, and Grilled Chicken on Corn Tortillas with Mexican Crema and Chipotle Cream, and Spicy Black Beans with Chipotle. Yummy!
