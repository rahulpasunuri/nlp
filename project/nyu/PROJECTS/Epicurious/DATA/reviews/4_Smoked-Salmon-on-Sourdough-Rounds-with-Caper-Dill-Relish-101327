Everyone raved about this recipe and it disappeared in a flash. After reading the comments, I altered the recipe slightly. Caper-Dill Relish: 1/4-cup finely chopped white onion 1/4-cup finely chopped red onion 3-T capers chopped in food processor 3-1/2 teaspoons Dijon must Dill Cream Cheese Spread: 8-oz cream cheese 1-1/2 T Creme Fraiche 1-1/2 T sour cream 1-T chopped fresh dill salt and freshly ground pepper

A great recipe. This was very fast and easy to make and the flavour was wonderful. The only change I made was to put a little olive oil and a sprinkle of dill on the baguette slices and toasted them. A big hit!

I purchased smoked salmon from Costco, which was already cut into (approx.) 2" rounds. Easy, beautiful, delish.

Delicious and easy. A real winner!

This appetizer was actually quite good although I made some changes to it. I used slices of seedless cucumbers in lieu of the bread and also omited the cream cheese. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and I will probobly make it again.

This was nice. I used the mini bagels, which I might or might not do again. I added just enough fresh dill to the cream cheese to make it pretty. I did put the relish in the food processor to slightly process because I was afraid the capers would roll (and in a stand-up party, that's no good). Wouldn't do that again, because it wasn't pretty. Only 3 forks because it wasn't extraordinary.

I made this for a brunch for 40 people, and it was the first to go. I used mini bagels instead of the sliced baguette and they were fun and traditional. Also, I threw the relish into the food processor and pulsed until it was finely chopped and it was fantastic. I will definitely make this again and again.

Yay!! It was a huge success at a dinner party I threw last weekend. It was so good, that my husband and I had the leftovers for our brunch the next day! I did mix some dill into the cream cheese for color and interest, and served them on kettle potato chips, which added a fantastic crunch and was ridiculously easy!! I will make these anytime I want to impress guests with something easy.

This was a surprise hit at my dinner party - they present beautifully and are absolutely delicious, as well as easy to prepare. I used coktail pumpernickle instead of sourdough, and it turned out fine. This will be a new classic in my hors d'ouvres collection.

I used Carr's water biscuits instead of bread, and these were a big hit. Make sure not to use too much dijon mustard - it almost overpowered the salmon. Also, I drained the capers and onions well before I made the relish. I took these to a meeting and didn't want the relish to "weep" and make the crackers soggy. I also mixed some extra dill in with the cream cheese just to make it pretty. Garnish with a little piece of dill on top and wait for the raves!

So easy, so good. Good for both my food-conservative family and my food-adventurous friends. Will be making this again for sure.

Glorious! It's everything a canape should be, tasty, savory, a delight to look at and simple to make. I wooshed the cream cheese all together with the relish and served it not only with the salmon, but with about everything else I could find. I did use a purple onion which improved the color. It gets better as it sits...if you can resist.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this, exactly following the recipe, with tremendous success. I think the only thing that could screw it up would be a poor quality baguette.

As a personal chef, I am often asked to cater small dinner parties and such. I have used this recipe with great success many times (twice this month). There are two changes to the recipe I recommend. First, use red onion instead of white. The color and flavor of the dish are improved. Second, brush the bread slices, lightly, with melted butter and toast them under the broiler. Toasting the bread in this manner improves the texture (the bread will become soggy otherwise).

Elegant party fare. The relish is intensely flavored and could overpower the taste of the salmon. Be sure not to skimp on the salmon pieces. I subbed creme fraiche with a little cream cheese for the cream cheese. Made it even more decadent. Served amid very thin lemon slices and fresh cracked black peeper over all.

Made this at Thanksgiving and it was very good. Definitely easy to make with little prep.

Great receipe. Only addition I would make would be to add freh lemon when serving. Tried it that way the second time and found it really improved the favor.

Missing from the ingredient list is the salmon. From the August 1996 magazine the amount is 6 ounces thinly sliced smoked salmon, cut into 24 pieces.

This is a very easy and good recipe, although it has a strong onion flavor. I actually preferred the relish after it had been refrigerated overnight.

Ingredients are easy to find and these take no time to assemble. I have served them at atleast 4 parties and each time someone told me they usually hate any type of salmon but loved these canapes and wanted the recipe. I take the easy way out and for garnish just use a sprig of fresh dill. On a platter with some greenery and/or flowers these look great.

I have served these lovely little rounds many times and they are always a HUGE hit. Don't change a thing; they are simple beyond compare and every piece will be gone.
