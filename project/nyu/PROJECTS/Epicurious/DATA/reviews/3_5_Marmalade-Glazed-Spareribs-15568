Very good recipe and easy to make. We did the oven method because it was raining and I can't imagine doing these completely on the grill. There was so much fat!! Basting is a must.

I ended up marinating the ribs for two days; was planning on only one day but got unexpectedly invited out to dinner. The meat was tender, but I thought the soy sauce overpowered the other flavors a bit. I'd like to try some of the other rib recipes on this site, or make this one with a different jam or lighter soy sauce next time.

These were delicious ribs. The flavoring from the marinade was good. I made them for a bbq and people enjoyed them. I roasted the ribs in the oven but after 1 1/2 hrs. the oven was smoking. So I placed them on the grill for 15 min. or more to finish them off. I found these ribs to be a little chewy and I prefer when the meat falls off the bone. Only a couple of children liked the ribs, most did not even want to try them. They looked like the ribs from a Chinese restaurant. A friend of mine made the mango-chutney ribs from Bon Appetit (also on the web site)and I prefer that recipe.

These was just delicious ribs, even my kids loved them. The sauce is just wonderful and a nice change over normal barbeque sauce. One change I did make was using all-fruit apricot spread instead of the orange and they were fantastic!

This was a HIT at my last company bbq! We were pressed for time so the ribs only had 30-45 minutes to marinate but it was still succulent. I can't wait to make it again when I can marinate over night.

Was looking for a lamb rib marinade and gave this one a shot. Turned out FABULOUS and my twin six year olds gobbled every morsel, no left overs. This is a keeper.

These were just outrageous and soooo easy. I used apricot jam instead of the orange marmalade and it was a wonderful balance in the marinade. We ate every last rib, and can't wait to make them again.

First time making ribs. I made this for my husband (I am vegetarian). I would give it 3 forks but because of my little changes I won't rate it. Didn't have any marmalade so I used Honey. Also put in some lemon juice and finely chopped pineapple and onion. He said the sauce was delicious but the meat was a little dry. I'll buy some marmalade this week and try again.

Very simple to prepare and good results. I also went the grilled route and used country style ribs.

We tried this out for 4th of July and it turned out great. Instead of roasting, we BBQ'd the ribs and I would highly recommend that!

Sauce was good enough to forgive finger-licking.
