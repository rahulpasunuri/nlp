The sauce was quite good, but for some reason, didn't seem to stick very well to the chicken. If the sauce had caramelized better on the chicken, I think it would be at least three forks. Not sure if I did something wrong. The chicken was browned bordering on burning in some areas so I'm not sure what else I could have done. I probably won't make it again.

these turned out great- i added 2 cloves garlic to the marinade. then, i marinaded the wings in the apricot mixture and olive oil for a few hours, broiled then for 8 min, turned them over, broiled for another 8 min, then basted them with apricot sauce, broiled for 3 min, flipped them, basted again, and cooked for 2 min. they were perfect. time cooked probably depends on your oven. a big hit on superbowl sunday.

These were so good. I baked mine at 500 like other reviewers. I also used sugarfree apricot preserves. Much healthier than regular preserves. They were sweet and spicy and the glaze turned out wonderfully.

Chicken wings have to be really tasty for me to eat them, and these were tasty. Since I am the garlic queen I did add more garlic. Also the preserves were mostly fruit with less sugar so I actually added some brown sugar, otherwise it would have been more tart-spicy (from the lime juice) rather than sweet-spicy which is what I wanted. Ok, I confess. I didn't have apricot preserves so I used Peach-Mango-Orange preserves, but I really think the end result would be about the same. If I were to change anything I would only use that much lime juice if using high-sugar content preserves. I used the stated amount of cayenne; I didn't think it was too hot at all. I tasted and tasted the sauce and kept thinking something was missing, then I added about 1 T of soy sauce and it was perfect. The sauce does taste even better after it is charred onto the chicken. I was nervous too about broiling it for so long so I kept setting off the (too sensitive) smoke alarm checking it so often but it turned out perfect, browned on the outside, a little blackened on the tips and tender-juicy on the inside, with fabulous flavor.

I made this for a party and was worried that I was supposed to broil these wings for so long, but they came our perfectly. One comment at my party was, "I would eat these for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!" Everyone loved them.. they were SO good!

This recipe is great and a big hit with my family, even two young children. Because they are sensitive to spice, I reduce the cayenne to about 1/2 what the recipe calls for. The wings will get very charred under the broiler, but don't let the blackened appearance bother you. It's just all the sugar in the sauce and it gives a great flavor.

A big success. I used the preserves, lime juice, garlic, cumin, cayenne mixture to marinate chicken breasts. I boiled it as instructed and then divided the mix in to thirds. I used 1/3 to marinate the chicken, 1/3 to brush while barbecuing the chicken, and the last 1/3 I served with the cooked chicken. Very nice flavor...sweet with a kick.

My kids loved these, and have asked several times that I make them again. This comes after they admitted that they had never realy liked chicken wings, despite the many different ways I'd been preparing them for years!!

The recipe as given makes for a great "bat wing" recipe. I created this tasty treat for coworkers for our Halloween luncheon, and they were a hit. Some wanted more heat, but others were content as they were. Used organic chicken in my selection, and Smucker's Apricot jam...just delicious! Took me more than 45 minutes in the kitchen though!

This recipe has promise, but as written it's beyond hot. Next time I make it (and there will be a next time), I'll start with 1/4 the amount of cayenne and add it to taste. We like hot things, but that was ridiculous. I wound up using twice the amount of fruit (I had to add another flavor since I only had 1 jar of apricot) to tame the spice. To the people who complain that this is too sweet, that has nothing to do with the recipe and everything to do with the quality of the jam you use. If you start with a high quality jam that has no HFCS in it, you'll wind up with a better piece of chicken. That does require buying something other than store-brand jam, though. I used an all-fruit jam that has no sugar at all, and then added a Tbs of honey (so it would cling better), and it was lovely. I also did this on legs instead of wings, cooking them at 500 for about 45 minutes, then popping them under the broiler once they were glazed.

Pretty good....I found that I needed to add more garlic and cayenne pepper for more taste......

Too much lime juice! The lime juice totally overpowered the chicken. I will make it next time, but with several adjustments: substitute cayenne for 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, add more garlic, lessen lime juice to only 1/4 of a cup, add parsley, and add more apricot preserves.

The sauce in this recipe was too sweet. Will stick to my favorite combo of orange marmalade, garlic, pepper and soy sauce.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Made it this afternoon. Had some chicken wings in the freezer as well as the ingredients needed on hand and decided to make it. I did not use the broiler, instead, baked the chicken wings high heat (around 500 degrees) for about 20 minutes and then basted them with the sauce for a few minutes. The wings came out pretty good. Had a bit of a crust, tasted like fried wings and the sweet and spicy sauce gave it a nice flavor.

A nice change of pace for wings. I bet this sauce would be great on any barbecued chicken, either on the bone or boneless. I think it needs more garlic and more heat though...

Had these for dinner tonight....excellent! My husband gobbled them up. I purchased peach preserves instead because i figured there would be a better chance of us eating peach preserves on toast sometime than having apricot in the house,anyway it turned out fantastic. I would up the garlic a bit and add more hot spice. Served this with corn on the cob and a field green salad with garlic bread. Yummy!

I thought this was OK, but my husband really liked it. I made a lot of alterations, and I think the recipe is probably a whole lot better when made w/wings. I made w/chicken breasts--baked at 500 for 35 minutes. Then removed the skin, added the glaze and broiled. Needless to say, doing this removed a lot of the flavor. I made with the shiitake fried rice, which was a nice accompaniment.

Made these to munch on for a football Sunday. I'll make them again for Superbowl sunday. Really addictive as snack food; the spicy/sweet flavor was fantastic. I baked them instead of broiling, as another reviewer suggested, so I could keep a closer eye on them. I also used a really good chipotle chile powder instead of cayenne. That may be why mine were spicier than some other reviewers.

This is great! I use chicken tenders and cook it on the stovetop. I also serve it with the ginger fried rice w/shitakes (like in the picture) and french beans. I make it for birthdays, jam sessions with my dad's hippy friends and when I'm in the mood for something yummy. The hotter the better for this chicken.

I haven't made this dish yet, but I can give a little advice on the baking aspect of this recipe. If you are going to bake the chicken wings. I suggest that you coat them with oil and turn the oven up to 450 degrees. This will crisp the chicken up nicely and then you can apply the sauce. But be aware. You will have to watch them carefully and it does make quite a bit of smoke.

Rating: 3
Really good!!!!! Second the suggestion to increase the cumin and cayenne. I used no sugar added apricot preserves and would recommend that. I think it would be to sweet otherwise. I also have some suggestions along the lines of procedure rather than the recipe. Don't bother about tossing wings in a bowl. Just put some oil on the broiler pan (I actually used a cookie sheet) salt and pepper the chicken and broil. Also no reason to mix the preserves etc in a blender. Mince the garlic and put it all straight into the pan. When heated it blends fine. Lastly to coat the wings don't mess around with brushing them all a dozen times. Just put them in a large tupperware, pour in the sauce (make sure it's not too hot), put the lid on, shake a few times burping the lid after each shake. Coats the wings beautifully and takes tons less time.

I guess this doesn't work baked because mine turned out miserably! I am typically pleased with recipes from this site, but this one was definately NOT a keeper. Pretty bland and mine did not have the crispness due to baking.

This was a definite winner! Try it soon! Can't imagine this getting any review but a thumbs up. I used wings, thighs and drumsticks and increased the garlic, cayenne and cumin as recommended. Don't be afraid to increase the cayenne....it still wasn't much. The broiling added a nice crispness and sizzle to the chicken. Not sure whether baking would do the same. Any bakers out there care to comment?

Totally delicious!!! I made this with the fried rice in the same issue of Gourmet that month and it was an awesome combo. Everything about the recipe was just right and I wouldn't change a thing. The sweet, sticky, crispiness of the wings makes them hard to stop eating.

Outstanding! Flavorful, with just the right amount of sweetness and kick. I am certain this would also translate well to the grill, using it as a basting sauce for breasts or legs on the grill. A great party appetizer!

I tried this recipe to use up some wings/drummettes that had been in the freezer for awhile and was extremely pleased with the results. I will try these again using breasts and as other reviewers suggested, will double the spices (all, not just the cayenne).

Citing the reviewers who thought this wasn't spicy...Only half a teaspoon of Cayenne...that really isn't much at all...I diced two habeneros, instead, and that gave it just a little heat. Overall, very good!

This was nothing special. I used peach chutney instead of the preserves and grilled boneleess chicken breasts, marinating them first for about 30 minutes, then basting them on the grill. They weren't spicy at all. Perhaps I need some new cayenne.

This dish was much better than anything I was expecting from it. From such simple ingredients and easy instructions an outstanding weekday meal was produced. I had to make a few minor substitutions based on what I had in my kitchen. I did not have limes so I used lemon juice instead and no cumin so replaced the cumin and cayenne with a sambhar curry powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The wings turned out sweet with a nice tang and boost of curry flavor. Ate this with white rice and it was beyond compare. I cannot wait to make them again. Next time I will make them spicier, either adding additional cayenne or perhaps adding chopped thai chilies.

I made this recipe the minute I saw it, and it was terrific! I used breasts and followed the advise of the person who said to try using a 9x13 inch pan and bake in a 450 degree oven, basting occasionally. I also used just a bit more cumin and cayenne..it was delicious!!!!!!next time I'll make a double batch of the sauce....

This was easy to prepare and very tasty. You could bake larger pieces of chicken and then baste with the same sauce (make more sauce, of course) towards the end of cooking. Or, you could baste on the grill! My only caution to everyone is that my house reeked for a day afterwards, due to the burning of the sweet sauce in the oven. Cleanup is kind of a pain, too.

Made this with thighs, well trimmed of fat. Had homemade peach preserves, so used those. It was really great (of course it has to cook longer than wings and of course you do have to keep watch). My Penzeys cayenne is really aggressive and at first tasting thought I would cut back next time, but after a few samples decided it's just right as it is. Although I couldn't taste the cumin, one of my favorite spices. Anyway this is an excellent chicken treatment with glorious color. Will certainly do it again.

I have to confess that I have not made this recipe yet, so many of you out there will hate me. I feel that the basting solution sounds really good. However, I have a few suggestions: 1)use larger pieces of chicken (boneless, skinless chicken breasts, skinless thighs or drumsticks) 2)use a 13 X 9 inch metal baking pan, coated with non-stick spray 3)bake at 450 degrees until done (turning and brushing with the sauce as necessary). This will keep your oven cleaner. Also, I cannot understand using a blender or food processer to make the sauce. What ever happened to mixing stuff with a fork or spoon? Thank you

These were fantastic! We love chicken wings and this was a great way to serve them. Have to wonder about the cook who "wanted to puke" when she made them. Needs to develop a little class, and maybe needs to learn to cook while she's at it. I personally found nothing gross or messy about these wings.
