I love grilled zucchini. I sliced the zucchini lengthwise and added salt and pepper along with the olive oil and it is quit delicious. You can add anything to it really.

This recipe, as it stands, is quite bland. However, if you add some garlic powder and onion salt and a dash of cayenne pepper - you get a GREAT recipe!
