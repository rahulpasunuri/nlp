All you reviewers drew me in, but the flavor of this soup is at the tipping point: wonderful. I took one suggestion, adding lemon juice (probably as much as 1 Tablespoon or more; I just eyeballed the amount as I had made a ginormous vat of broth).Also seeded and added a tomato or two. Did not add turkey meat, but used spicy Italian sausage links sliced into 1/4-1/2 inch pieces. Amazing.

I started with a carcass and cooked that down with some stock, water, carrots, celery and onions (big chunks - not mirepoix). Removed bones and veges etc. Then I made the recipe exchanging thyme for basil. Used red bell, crookneck and zucchini for color. And, I used Trader Joe's dry mini ravioli that I cooked separately and threw in at the end. This is a wonderful, hearty soup that I will definitely recommend - and keep.

Yes, excellent. Homemade turkey stock and omitting the zucchini were my only changes.

This was scrumptious! My new favorite way to use turkey leftovers. Great flavor. I used my homemade turkey stock from the Christmas bird, and threw in a Parmesan rind. I kept all the suggested seasonings, but tweaked the veggies to add more nutrients: parsnips instead of carrots, red bell pepper instead of green for added color, yellow squash as well as zucchini, and shredded spinach stirred in at the end. I made a double batch, and 1 pkg. of cheese tortellini was just right. Would have been too much for just 4 servings.

Tasty. I made as printed except I used homemade turkey stock. Will certainly make again - a terrific alternative to other leftover turkey recipes. I'll find smaller sized ravioli next time.

I liked this recipe a lot... a good broth is very important. I made mine in a slow cooker with leftovers from thanksgiving. All the flavours went together well. I would add a squeeze of lemon next time, as mentioned by a previous reviewer.

This is a good base recipe for my budget-friendly version. In addition to the bell pepper, zucchini, and carrot I upped the veggies with the addition of celery and yellow crooked-neck squash. I also used 3 frozen turkey burger patties from my freezer that I cubed and browned first before the veggies. From my pantry I used 1/2 of a 1 lb. package of Trader Joe's dried tortellini with pesto filling. 3 other deviations that I did with wonderful results were to add a scant 1/4c. of ketchup for a "tomatoey" sweet note, the zest from 1 large lemon for acidity, and finish with 1/4c. chopped parsley for brightness.

I love Epicurious! The suggestions made by reviewers made this 4 forks. Added extra vegetables (celery, shredded cabbage, extra carrot; spinach at the very end). Cut down on zucchini (used one) and tortellini (1/2 package). Used extra chicken stock (made in slow cooker from a rotisserie chicken) and cooked chicken (from the same bird). Loved the fennel basil broth (did add a parmesan rind). Didn't find 1/2 tsp crushed peppers to be too much (barely noticed it). Served with grated Parmesan Reggiano.

Perfect as is, though I didn't skimp on the onion (small onion? what is that?) and to save time, just shredded the turkey instead of dicing. The red pepper is great added in later if you have sensitive guests. Throwing in some diced, cooked Italian or hot sausage is awesome too. Very, very pleased with this one.

Rating: 4
Excellent soup. Like others, I added more vegetables(shredded cabbage and baby spinach), less pepper flakes (probably delete altogether next time, slow mouth burn after taste)and a heel of Parm cheese. I did not even include the ravs. This soup stands alone without any pasta at all.

A tasty and filling soup. I made this with turkey stock instead of chicken, added an extra carrot, celery, and one parsnip for good measure. Also used rainbow cheese tortellini. Worked out fab.

Rating: 4
What an exceptionally good soup. I followed many suggestions--made with my own turkey stock, added 10 cups instead of 6, used more turkey, used only two shakes of red pepper flakes, used a fresh bottle of fennel seed. Instead of ravioli, I used whole wheat and spinach gnocchi. The flavors were exceptional--nicely strong fennel the first night, blended flavors the second. My husband raved about it. The best turkey soup I've ever made, and I've made many.

Rating: 4
This recipe got raves both times I made it. I use my own turkey stock, with leftover turkey. The first time, we served gnocchi instead of using ravioli. The second time, I added 10 oz. of frozen cheese tortellini, rather than ravioli (the size seems more appropriate with the diced vegetables). A winter-time winner!

Add the extra veggies & the worchestershire & fresh lemon juice. I left out the zucchini, fennel & pasta as it doesn't fit into our current eating style. I only had ground turkey, but it turned out great with it. We've made it twice this week. It gets better IF you can wait til the next day to eat it!

I liked this recipe but was surprised by how hot the peppers made it taste. I increased the volume of this soup considerably, as I added many additional ingredients per prior reviews (celery, spinach, one leek, peas, more carrots, can of tomatoes). Despite all the additions and extra broth, the 1/4 t. of hot peppers really came through--just a warning.

I made this yesterday during a snow day, making the stock from the remnants of the turkey I cooked on Saturday. I doubled the recipe to ensure we had leftovers, and cooked the ravioli separately, using dried Trader Joe's tortelini, and added some extra veggies (peas, green beans). We all agreed it was delicious, even without the zucchini. The fennel was a lovely touch.

MMMMMMMMMMMM Good!

I normally HATE leftover turkey soup, but this is not the normal turkey soup! This may be one of the best soups we've ever eaten. The changes I made were: simmered what was left of the carcass in water (no added veggies), bought a rotisserie chicken from Costco and shredded all of the meat except the breasts and carefully omitted all fat and skin. I also browned the veggies and fennel plus 1 tsp chipotle powder before adding them, which is my standard method for adding veggies and spices. I added probably 2 T of Worchestershite sauce (which I had thought was MY secret ingredient until I read the earlier reviews!). I used a 10-oz package of Trader Joe's small cheese tortellini rather than the ravioli. We didn't need any canned broth. About a Tablespoon of Kosher salt plus some freshly grated Parmesean cheese finished this up. To die for!

This soup gets 4 forks for ease of prep. It was delicious too, but so quick to use up those Thanksgiving leftovers. Doubled everything, added leeks, shallots, worcestershire, red & orange bell peps. Omitted raviloi and used tiny alphabet pasta. Yummy.

Made my own sausage for the very first time one morning, and decided I liked fennel. So I decided to try this soup. I loved it! I agree with some of the other reviewers; turkey soup is usually awful. But the fennel flavor, and fresh (mini) ravioli make this soup delicious. This is one recipe that I made exactly according to the directions, and I used chicken stock.

Although it froze well, I wasn't too crazy about this soup. The flavors just didn't gel for me somehow. The herbs were a little jarring and didn't blend with the rest of the flavors as much as I wanted them to.

I made this recipe (exactly as written) with left-over Christmas turkey and stock from the carcass. It was good and with the suggestions of some of the other reviewers it has the potential of being superb. Will definitely make again and experiment. Nevertheless, it's a great way to use up turkey left-overs.

Excellent soup! Reading the reviews, I got it into my head that the recipe called for tortellini and used that. I made turkey stock from turkey carcass as well. It's hard to go wrong with this soup. I didn't measure the amount of broth I had and just kept dumping ingredients in. Took the suggestion from another reviewer, and put the spices into a bit of cheesecloth to keep them out of the soup. I also added Swiss chard. Very flavourful. This will be the soup for whenever I roast a whole turkey again.

I am usually not a turkey soup fan, but it was delicious -- so easy to make, and more flavorful than boiling the heck out of a turkey carcass! Instead of the ravioli I used cheese tortellini.

This is the best Turkey soup recipe I have ever found. We love to make it and freeze part of it for another day. I added 3 fresh serrano peppers diced up and it added a nice zing to it. It gets better and better as it sits. Best part about cooking a turkey is the soup we make after.

Rating: 4
I DID add, the red bell pepper, 2 leeks, a dash of whochester sauce, and more broth as suggested. The only different thing I did, was... I was out of fresh grated parmesean cheese, so I used the dehydrated stuff, and I put in maybe 2 tablespoons into the cooling soup mixture, before I served the soup. Also, I could not find at the market the tri-colored, dried ravioli, so I used a fresh spinach ravioli, being careful not to over-cook it, as we'll be heating it up tomorrow. PS: I had some beautiful fresh spinach, so I threw in a cup of that as well. Hubby is still lapping it up as I write! :-)

Great soup! My Fiance and I both loved it. I did make a couple of changes, by suggestion of previous reviews. I omitted the zucchini, added a red bell pepper, carrots, a leek and added an extra 3 cups of broth and still ended up with lots of extra veggies at the bottom. A suggestion for people who like the flavor of fennel, but don't necessarily like to bite into a seed, put the fennel in a mesh bag (tea or hops bag for brewing). You still get all the great flavors while cooking. I will definatly make this again!!

This was a great-smelling and flavorful soup. I meant to make it with my turkey carcass from Thanksgiving but I missed the opportunity so I made it this week using a small whole chicken. I used the dark meat for another recipe and saved the white meat for the soup. I used 6 cups of the home-made chicken stock plus one can of low-fat canned broth, and next time would add even more broth. I used the previous suggestions of added salt, pepper, and worchestershire sauce as well as tri-color tortellini. I used a red pepper... perhaps next time I will also add a carrot and then use only two-color tortellini for a change of color pace. Very filling, main course soup.

This soup was easy to make and a nice change from the turkey vegetabe soup that I usually make with leftover turkey. I used the 3 color cheese stuffed tortellini - it made a very attractive soup. Tasted even better the next day.

Because I had roast goose for Christmas and not turkey, I used the goose, and a stock made from the carcass, as well as a few tablespoons of the leftover port wine goose sauce. Since it is December, I omitted the zucchini and replaced with turnip and celery. As soon as I added the salt, pepper, and worcestershire sauce recommended by prior reviewer, the flavor really heightened. Came out delicious. I cut the meat and vegetables into a small dice so they would fit well on the spoon, and only the ravioli had to be cut when eating. Next time would use tiny stuffed pasta instead of the average sized ravioli that I purchased. The appearance was lovely with the multicolored confetti of vegetables.

Excellent recipe!! I simmered the carcass (removing skin and fat) with the chicken broth and used tricolored tortellini as per other reviewers (a must). I also added about 3 tablespoons of my wifes shiitake mushroom gravy. and about 3 cups of water for extra broth and to reduce the saltiness probably from the added gravy. A new Thanksgiving tradition for me!!!!

I used the left-over turkey carcus from thanksgiving, which made a huge difference, and dried rainbow cheese tortellini. The dried tortellini worked very well. In order to give it a bit more flavour, I added some pepper,salt and Worchestershire sauce to taste ( a real trick taught to me by my husband - learned in chef school). The final product was excellent.

The soup was a nice change from the normal turkey noodle soup I make with left overs. The fennel seed really gave the soup a special flavor. I used turkey stock from the left over turkey bones for a better soup base. I also substituted frozen veggies for the zuchini since that is not our favorite veggie. It was great.
