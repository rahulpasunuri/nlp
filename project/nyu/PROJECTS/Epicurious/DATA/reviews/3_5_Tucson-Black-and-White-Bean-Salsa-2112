Great recipe, except I'll put less spice in next time.

Very tasty. The subtle heat from the combined jalapeno, chili, and garlic is great. The oregano is also a refreshing change from so many cilantro-based salsas. Next time, I will use fresh oregano rather than dried.

I've been making this for 15 years, since the recipe was first published. It's easy, it tastes great and every single time I've taken it to a party, at least one person asks for the recipe - most recently, teenagers at a high school graduation party. Now THAT is a recommendation! Fresh oregano makes a big difference. Play with the amounts but no need to mess with the ingredients. This is a four fork recipe in my book!

I use this for vegetarian burritos and add pepper jack cheese. My husband and I love it.

This is a great salsa when everyone is tired of the regular tomato salsa! Adding a little cilantro livens it up a bit and add more jalepeno for your spicier friends! The best part of this recipe is it's versatility!

This is definitely NOT a one fork so don't listen to the one review below. I added cilantro (good color and adds great flavor) and upped the lime juice to taste. It got rave reviews at a party and is very tasty and healthy!

Very tasty! I agree w/ Wisconsin, it's beauty is it's versatility! Cilantro is a definite add, try using a poblano pepper instead of the jalepeno. It is a great neutral base & goes with spicy foods or can be zipped up & eaten on it's own. We've made it twice & haven't had a single bean left over!

I thought this recipe was really bland even after adding cilantro to it. I think I'll stick to my own salsa instead.

This is a very good and colorful salsa. At the last minute I diced two avocados, tossed them with some lime juice, and added them to the salsa -- for even more color and flavor. People loved it. I loved it, too!

My husband surprised me and went wild for this! I served it with the southwestern lime chicken from this site. I also changed the recipe some... (I know...I know....!). I added 1 cup of chopped tomatoes, omitted the red bell pepper and used cilantro in place or the oregano. Yum!!!!

Very nice as a "relish" for grilled chicken -- and I agree with the suggestions of adding freshly chopped cilantro and a touch more lime juice just before serving to freshen.

I make this often. Unless using fresh corn, I usually don't cook it. When in a hurry, I have even made it with canned white corn--works well enough. I usually use all black beans--my favorite!

This is excellent, and very healthy. Relatively easy to prepare, but lots of chopping!

Made a huge hit at my party! next time, I'd decrease the cumin and chili powder slightly so you can taste the veggies more and not have it all taste like chili. Also, added some lemon juice the day I served it. Very good!

I decided to use this as a vegetarian filling for burritos as suggested. We couldn't stop eating it! I also added the Jack cheese. The dish is very tasty -- I didn't have to change a thing.

I followed the suggestions of cilantro and needing more spice. I used pasilla chili powder and added 1/2 tsp more cumin. The salsa is very tasty and the guests who tried it, liked it. Even my husband liked it on a tostada shell, and he is not a corn fan!

Used this as a dip with tortilla chips. It was somewhat bland. I added cilantro which helped boost the flavor, but not enough to make it again.

Used this dip along with guacamole and a spicy sweet potato for a colorful and delicious trio of options with tortilla chips. Very good even if you lack the time to roast the corn.
