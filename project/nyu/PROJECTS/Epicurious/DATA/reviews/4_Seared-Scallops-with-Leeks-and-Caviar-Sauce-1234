This was an easy, but elegant dish. I, too, placed the caviar on top of the scallops. There were plenty of leeks, so I placed an extra little pile in the center of each plate, surrounded by the scallops, then spooned the sauce on the center leek mound and added a few tarragon leaves on top. It was aesthetically pleasing and delicious.

Really excellent dish. I put a little of the caviar on each scallop and sprinkled a bit on the sauce for color, and used a mixture of large (not jumbo) scallops and a couple large key west pink shrimp. I served this as a second course on New Year's Eve and got two toasts stopping the dinner about how much the guests loved it! I would definitely make it again for a special occasion.

Easy and delicious. I topped each scallop with caviar rather than putting it in the sauce (wasn't sure what that would do to the color of the sauce). Elegant. Will definitely make again.

This came out great when I made it. I used tiny bay scallops and omitted the caviar only because for New Year's the caviar was soooo expensive. This was a hit at my dinner party. Pretty presentation too. Will make again!

Just loved this and so did everyone else. Is very party friendly--the leek mixture can be made way in advance and heated at the last minute. I wanted a smoother feel to the dish, so I pureed the leeks and sauce until it was fairly smooth which made a nice "nestle" for the scallops. Used American Paddlefish caviar which is not horribly expensive, but still tastes better than that other stuff you can find on supermarket shelves. All in all, a real pleaser!

Perfect. I've made this twice and it was a big hit both times. Instead of stirring the caviar into the sauce we topped each scallop with a dollop. Easy to prepare, visually appealing and delicious.

Excellent! This was a perfect first course for our Christmas dinner. Like other reviewers I prefer the sauce and leeks warm instead of room temperature as written in the recipe.

This dish was amazing and an absolutely wonderful start to our Christmas dinner! Tasted even better than expected with a glass of champagne. Halved the number of scallops so there were plenty of leeks, but ended up with too much sauce. The champagne in the sauce was exquisite, though think I'll use less cream next time, was VERY rich and thick. Sauteed some shrimp and piled them in the middle with scallops surrounding, topped each scallop with fresh ikura (salmon roe) for a really beautiful presentation. Will make again anytime there's a champagne-worthy occasion (or maybe this can be an occasion in itself!).

Oh, man, was this good! As others have noted, you could increase the leeks by 50% to have a better base for serving the scallops on. We made this using fat free half-and-half -- probably lost a little in "mouth feel" compared with cream, but still one of the best sauces ever for seafood. Made with dry tarragon and without the caviar -- still tremendous. Allow about 6 oz. of scallops per person as a main course.

Just made this for Christmas Eve. It was super easy and Fabulous. I love the make-ahead sauce.

I made this recipe once before and got rave reviews. I liked the fact that you can serve the sauce at room temperature which frees you up to do other things before the next course. I'll be making it again for a Christmas dinner party but I'll use red caviar and a tarragon garnish for a more festive look.

I substituted dry vermouth for the champagne, omitted the caviar, and substituted dried thyme for the tarragon. (Hey, I was just looking for some recipe/guideline to combine the scallops and leeks I had). The vermouth substitution was wonderful (I love cooking with vermouth) and the whole house smelled divine after making this dish.

Made this without the caviar...still delicious.

This was a great beginning to a dinner party. Enjoyed with a fine champagne. Even though who didn't like caviar raved!

Excellent dish! I accidently browned the leeks, so I omitted them, using only the essense (liquid) and I think I like it alot better -- more elegant, , , as if strained. The flavor is there. I have added this to my repetoire. YUM

Cooked it tonight and probably the best appeziter I've ever tasted. I used shrimp instead of scallops.Would probably use 3 leeks next time because you want a nice base to put the shrimp on. I sauteed the shells with olive oil and this added a great taste to the liquid which I poured over the shrimp. I spooned the champagne sauce around the the leeks and shrimp. Place the caviar on the top of each shrimp. Maybe the best I've ever tasted!

This was just scrumptious! What a beautiful marriage of flavors. I was looking for something that would use leftovers from New Year's Eve, and this fit the bill. Surprisingly, there wasn't as much champagne in the bottle as I thought (hmmm), so I had to substitute some chardonnay. I only had about 2 T of caviar and had to use dried tarragon -- despite all these alterations, it still came out great. If I make this for Valentine's Day, I'll take the suggestion of placing the caviar atop the scallops.

Great recipe! I've made it twice and the first time I did not have time to let the sauce cool. The second time I did. I like it much better with the leeks and sauce warm. Definitely put the caviar on top and not into the sauce especially if really good caviar. It's also great without the caviar if you don't have it.

I halved the recipe and made it for my husband on Valentine's Day. He went crazy over it! The recipe was veyr good and easy. I did warm up the sauce and I think a bit more sauce would have been good. Next time I'll make a little extra.

Absolutely simple and delicious! I made as one course for our New Year's Eve 2000 dinner (au deux). Because the leeks and sauce are made ahead, it is really convenient. I rewarmed the leeks slightly in the microwave before serving and I put the caviar on top of each scallop rather than in the sauce. A great starter for a special meal!

A major show stopper. I am making as the appetizer for our Christmas dinner this year.

This is amazing...I have made it several times for a fancy first course and it gets raves!

I made this dish at a restaurant i work at, except I used mahi-mahi. RAVE REVIEWS! I also substituted scallions for the leeks. The sauce is what makes the dish. You could use it on any seafood item. I highly recommend this recipe. You won't be dissapointed!
