Loved the recipe. Thankfully I read the prior reviews about it being too thin, so I made a quick roué an added at the last minute to thicken up the sauce and it turned out perfect. I too used crimini mushrooms and added some white mushrooms for bulk (since we really like mushrooms). I had a mushroom stock I made and froze a while back and that punched up the mushroom flavor even more.

I thought this was very good, but if I were to go to the trouble of making homemade gnocchi again (it was my first time), I'd probably try a different sauce -- pesto or a tomato meat sauce. Still, it was good. I changed the recipe only very slightly, following the tips to decrease the amount of chicken broth and add some wine (I did 1/2 cup wine first, let that reduce, then 1 cup broth) and to add a little flour to thicken the sauce. I also cooked the sauce on high, which helped with the thickening. I didn't use any truffle oil, and my arugula was baby arugula.

I used cremini mushrooms which gave it a depth of flavor. I used store-bought gnocchi and had the same issue as many others - the sauce was just too thin. After all the butter and oil, I just didn't want to add cream or starch and was hoping the starchy gnocchi would soak it up which it didn't when I first served it. After refrigerating the leftovers, and then reheating it for my parents a few hours later, I was pleased to see that some of the liquid did absorb though it didn't look as pleasing. They still enjoyed it. I don't agree with the garlic or button mushroom substitutes - the truffle oil, shallots and creminis give it a delicate flavor that I feel the garlic would just overpower and button mushrooms taste like nothing. Tips: Add less stock, Quick dish

Made it with store-bought gnocchi and had the same issue as many others - the sauce was just too thin. After all the butter and oil, I didn't want to add cream. Next time I'll add less stock but it was a hit and super quick so I'll make it again.

I used store bought gnocchi and less mushrooms (not much of a mushroom fan). The sauce was really great! It was savory. I will be making this again.

I made the mushroom sauce with store bought gnocchi, so this review is for the sauce only. I used button mushrooms and red onions instead of shallots, because that is what I had on hand. It was easy and delicious. Will definitely make this again!

Made almost to the letter...however, when it became time to mix the gnocchi with the sauce, the sauce seemed wayyyy to thin, so I added some flour. And seasoned with s&p. It was good, but not spectacular. But it was quick, so I'll def. try again, following the suggested additions of sherry and garlic.

This is a delicious recipe. My husband and daughter loved it. As recommended by other reviewers, I added lots of garlic and used one cup of stock (I used veggie) and and 3/4 cup of wine. I will definitely make this again.

I did a google search for gnocchi and mushroom because I had some mushrooms that were about to turn, and this was delicious. Will save and make it again

DELICIOUS!!!! Use store bought gnocchi. Substitute 3/4 cup sherry for the broth and add lots of garlic! The best food is made of simple, fresh ingredients and this recipe is a great way to show that! 1/2 hour and it's on the table and will garner compliments from all who eat it! YUM YUM!

great recipe ... my suggestion is to add a bit of sherry (in stead of wine) to deglaze the pan, and then add your stock. The sage in combination with the sherry add so much depth to the dish ... also, add a couple of table spoons of whipping cream to the sauce. Do not forget to season with salt and pepper and garnish with some parsley at the end ... deeeeeeeelicious! with these suggestions I think the recipe is well worth a forth fork ... ;)

gnocchi from a packet. and added garlic and wine to the sauce, it is a great recipe but i did not find it as amazing as some of the reviews indicated.

I used another gnocchi recipe as some suggested and made the sauce, which is good.

I used the half-and- half chicken broth/wine suggestion, and at the very end I thought it looked a little thin, so I put in a cup of heavy cream. Bad for the body, great for the recipie. It was rich and cozy, and everyone loved it.

I say the recipe is three forks as is but with a few tweaks it becomes a four fork. Added garlic, and a little cream did not add the arugula or the sage. Topped with some parmesan and chopped parsley. Was a very rich satisfying meal.

Delicious clavour. And would definately recommend substituting 1/4 cup of the chicken broth with white wine. Added a bit of flour to the butter and oil to thicken, as the sauce is a bit too watery. Would definately make it again.

Great recipe for the sauce -- didn't try my hand at the Gnocchi -- over mushroom raviloi's from Whole Foods -- added some wine and lemon juice while the mushrooms were cooking down, rosemary with the sage and a little creme fraiche at the end to thicken -- but it is a great basic and will use again and again

eh, I have made much better gnocchi. The sauce was nice and will make that again.

I made this one night when we were having company over for dinner - it was soooo GREAT! I certainly used another reviewers advice and used white wine with the broth for my sauce - it makes it so good and compliments all the flavours. I definately would increase the sauce though, perhaps double it next time as we couldn't get enough of it! The arugula was great - next time we will add a few bits of freshly minced tomato on top - don't forget the parmesan on top - it helps seal the dish well!

This is great! I really love this recipe. I've made it quite a few times. Baby arugula is best, but you can also you baby spinach for a slightly different (but still very delicious) flavor. I sometimes use garlic instead of shallots. And I agree that store bought gnocchi - if you find a good kind - is a very practical shortcut.

I wasn't overly impressed with the recipe at first glance, so I made some changes. I sauteed the gnocchi before adding them to the sauce, to ensure a firmer bite. And I added some Irish whiskey and sour cream. The arugula gave it a nice bitter touch.

Very tasty, and easy to make. I used Trader Joe's Gnocchi (excellent!) and added some garlic, red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup white wine and 2 TBS heavy cream. Truffle oil and the arugula added a special touch as well.

If I could, I would give this 3 1/2 forks. It is very very tasty. I think gnocchi is one of those (very few) things that actually taste better store bought that made at home, the texture is just better in my opinion. So, using store bought gnocchi and adding NO salt (and I am a salt-a-holic), this was really easy and delicious. I would definitely suggest baby arugula if you can find it as the flavor is more delicate. Spinach could probably be substituted if you don't like the bite of the arugula.

Followed the recipe almost exactly, with the sole exception being the addition of a few tablespoons of cream at the end. The sauce does seem rather thin and watery as another reviewer commented, but the gnocchi absorbs a great deal of it and the starch from the potatoes helps to thicken it adequately. The arugula is an absolute must for the dish, as it imparts wonderful texture and peppery bite, giving the overall dish another dimension and contrast that it would be lacking otherwise. I'm a big fan of arugula and didn't find it at all displeasing, but to those who found it bitter, I'd suggest looking for baby arugula instead of mature bunches as the leaves get more pungent and spicy as they mature. The overall dish is absolutely spectacular; will definitely make again and again.

I was searching for a recipe to make homemade gnocchi when i found this... i left out the pepper and nutmeg and didn't roll them with the fork ... they turned out perfect and tasted just like Nonna's. I made a pesto sauce to put them in, instead of the mushroom sauce and it was DELISH!!!!! iIll have to try te mushroom sauce the next time...and there will be a next time. mmm mmm good.

I altered the recipe a little, based on what I had in the fridge. I use common mushrooms and spinach in place of arugula. Over all, it was really good and my husband liked it too. I forgot to use the truffle oil and parmesan, mainly because my husband was late and I was miffed....I'll have to try it again as written.

I wish I could say that my family enjoyed this recipe because so many others seemed to, but I think the truffle oil sort of ruined it for us. I usually love gnocchi but this dish ended up in the trash.

Very good recipe. Making the gnocchi from scratch is too much work though. they taste a lot better than the store bought but it is not worth it. the dish is quite good without the arugula.

I've made this many times and everyone loves it. You can substitue a mix of mushrooms, but I like having at least part of them be shitakes since they're so flavorful. White wine is a nice addition to the sauce and next time I'll also add garlic. Next time I'll also experiment with different herbs just for the sake of novelty.

I loved this recipe and I am planning on adding it to my monthly rotation. I substituted Crimini mushrooms for Shitake, fresh chives and oregano for sage, and spinach for arugula -- it was delicious!

To Steve Shields: Whether gnocchi can be regarded as delicate or not is irrelevant. Similar to pasta, it can tolerate a wide range of sauces, and can be more accurately described as "hearty." Also, I would hardly describe shiitake mushrooms as delicate! And I love arugula made in just about every way - it's great with pasta.

I have been making gnocchi for well over 40 years, and I consider them to be one of the best foods on earth. Gnocchi, as well as mushrooms, have a very delicate flavor of their own, and care must be given in choosing a sauce that will do justice to them. By using arugula, or any other of the bitter herbs, the taste of the gnocchi and mushrooms is totally lost. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out pretty much as I had anticipated. It was a terrible waste of gnocchi!

I really like gnocchi and these were very good and easy. I didn't care too much for the sauce, too salty I guess. We had half with the sauce and the next day I fried the remaining gnocchi in butter, sprinkled with parmesan and a squeeze of lemon. Fresh herbs would have been good also. I will make these again. The fried version would be good breakfast fare in place of hash browns since you can make and boil them the day before.

I tried this recipe for company and got rave reviews. I altered the orginal recipe slightly. I added garlic to the shallots and mushrooms. I added about 1 1/2 tsp of dry vermouth to the sauce and allowed it to reduced a little bit longer than the recipe required. Just before adding the gnocci I stirred-in 3-4 tbs of heavy whipping cream and a dash of cayenne pepper. (I thought that the sauce would have been too thin without the cream). On the advice of another reader I substituted spinach for the arugula since my grocery store was out of arugula. Also, I cheated and used a package of the already prepared gnocchi from the freezer. The results were wonderful. I will definitely make this dish again, and I have already had requests for the recipe. This dish with some warm bread, herbed butter, and a salad is an elegant weekend menu.

I was looking for something to do with my mushrooms and wanted to make a sauce for my barbequed pork chops. I only used the sauce recipe, substituting the shitake mushrooms for regular mushrooms, and tarragon for the sage. I thickened the sauce and used it to accompany the chops and my husband raved. The sauce almost made the pork taste like a great steak of beef. I will definitely make this sauce with beef in the future

I never have time to make gnocchis, so I substitute portebello mushroom or chicken tortelini and it works out really well and goes really well with the sauce. The truffle oil is an excellent addition. This is one of my favorite dishes.

I made this dish for a dinner with my boyfriend, and it turned out fantastic! Instead of russet potatoes, I went with yukon gold (a favorite of mine), and the gnocchi turned out a lovely gold color with a rich, buttery taste. This is a dish I will definitely make again.

This recipe was great! I couldn't get arugula at my market so I substituted spinach, portabellos for shittakes, and as I was cooking for a vegetarian, I substituted 1 c. white wine + 3/4 c water for the chicken broth. The wine was a Pazen low-alcohol Riesling, and the flavor was so subtle, it underscored the sage and mushroom flavor with a delightful sweetness. It got compliments all around and was quickly devoured!!

We added chopped spinach and garlic to the sauce, but otherwise followed it exactly. I think our only change in the future will be to skip the eggs in the dough. Truly a delicious dish!

Coming from an Italian family where homemade pasta is the only way to go - I have to say the gnocchi was great. The only thing I would do next time is use a little less sage. The combination of the sage and white truffle oil was a little "musty" but still great. I reluctantly served it to my first dinner party of strictly meat-&-potatos people and they devoured it!

We loved the dish but since we are garlic addicts, I did add 2 tsp chopped garlic and a shake of cayenne pepper to the sauce which I think added a little extra zest to an already great recipe. I recently bought truffle oil so this is the reason I tried the recipe. It's my first experience with both and the outcome was worth the time and money.

This dish is fantastic! I made it for the first time about a month ago, and have already made it twice more! I prepared the recipe as-is, except I substituted "candy cap mushroom oil" for truffle oil. Making gnocchi isn't hard, just a little time consuming. I was actually impressed with how easy it is to make gnocchi. Or at least, it's easy to make gnocchi for two. Making this for a larger group takes more commitment -- I made it for 8 and rolling those dough pieces over the fork took quite a while!

Wow! What a wonderful dish! We loved the sauce and thought it was perfect with the gnocchi. Using 1.4 pounds of potato, I found that 10-12 Tablespoons of flour were needed to achieve the right consistency and elasticity. I substituted spinach for arugula, which I couldn't find, and left out the truffle oil for the same reason; will search some specialties stores so that I'll have it for next time. The recipe served three delighted adults as a main course.

Good recipe, time consuming though. Make sure you add enough flour to the gnocchi dough and don't boil them too long or they'll bee too mushy. Wasn't too impressed with the sauce, I would try a tomato vodka sauce next time.

This was absolutely delicious!! I can't think of any way that it could be improved. I made it for Valentine's Day and my husband loved it. We actually had it as an appetizer and ate the leftovers the next day. It was just as good the next day!
