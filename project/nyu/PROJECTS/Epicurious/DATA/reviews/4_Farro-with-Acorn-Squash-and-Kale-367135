I made this according to the recipe with one exception: I accidentally picked up collard greens. I used them, anyway and we LOVED it. We will definitely be making it again! Two notes: 1) I found the squash a little too soft, so next time will decrease the cooking time a bit or will increase the sizze of the chunks. 2) I found it a pain to peel the crevices of the squash, so next time, I will roast it with the peel, as in this other favorite recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Roasted-Acorn-Squash-with-Chile-Vinaigrette-236007

Very good - here I am making this a second time, and have some advice on making it easy to peel butternut squash. Cut off bottom inch, and top inch of squash and stand bottom down on chopping block.Using a vegetable peeler , in downward strokes,you are done in about one minute, no hassle. Then on to the cubing part...

This dish is absolutely delicious and a great way to sneak kale into the family's dinner! Yum, yum, yum! 4 stars!

DELicious! Toothsome and nutty. Peeling butternut squash is indeed treacherous. I suffer through it because baking the chunks from a raw state carmelizes them and gives them a nice substantial texture. The bake and scoop method is mushier and sacrifices the carmel - big loss. If the farro method is too fussy for you (heck, it's not risotto), You can start by just oven- roasting the farro and then cooking it in 2-3 cups stock until it's the texture you prefer (keep it chewy), then drain it the stock. Set it aside. Then melt butter, onions, wine, add farro, skip the stock and go on to kale, squash, etc. I don't think it sacrifices flavor.

I found this recipe to be delicious. I did make a few changes. I doubled everything as suggested by one review. I also roasted the squash in the oven whole (anything to avoid peeling and cubing). Roasting it whole allowed me to do that earlier in the day and then scoop out the squash and stir it in. I had chicken stock on hand so I used that instead of vegetable stock. I also used pearled farro which sped up the cooking a bit. I didn't find it too be terribly time consuming. I believe this dish will show up for Thanksgiving.

So, half way into this recipe, I was thinking, I am NEVER going to make this again... Squash was soo hard, it was difficult to cube it, ended up cooking for a bit (20 minutes) over water in the oven to soften it up, which helped. Also I thought the farro was a bit labor intensive (and expensive from the specialty store). SO, all that said, it was incredible!! Really healthy ingredients, with a simple and lovely combo of textures and flavors, and the end result was really just incredible all together. Even my kids, who weren't thrilled by the look of it, ended up eating it up. Will make again. Yeah!

This was a really lovely and delicious dish. I didn't have any broth so I cheated and cooked the farro in about 2 cups of water with bay leaf, onion, garlic, salt and pepper. After about 30 minutes or so I began the sauteing step as written and added the strained broth from pre-cooking the farro. It only took another 15 minutes or so to get tender enough to complete the recipe and it was truly delicious. Since I was already serving a separate chard dish, I omitted the kale and instead added about 1/3 cup chopped flat leaf parsley with the cheese at the end. It was incredible!

I so wanted to like this. It sounded so fall-ish and comforting. The farro became too glutenous, and the kale was a bit undercooked, so it didn't seem to play well with other ingredients. The best part was the squash, which would have been fine on its own. For all the time and effort, I thought it would be better. I'd maybe try arborio or brown and wild rice next time (since the farro is cooked gradually like a risotto), flavor the kale with something, and just barely toss the things together at the end. Otherwise, it's just globby like a savory oatmeal.

I have to say I am not a big fan of acorn squash. I also have not used farro that much in recipes, but this recipe is very good. It is time intensive but if you prepare your squash and pre-soak your farro ahead of time it will go a little faster. It is a recipe I will make again. This dish I made ahead of time and it was great for dinner the next day. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!!!

I cook with farro often and learned about it through trial and error. Farro is sold either whole, pearled or semi-pearled. It's important to know what type of farro you're cooking with. Whole grain farro includes the husk of the grain, and requires pre-soaking for several hours or overnight before using. If you use whole grain farro without soaking it, it will take much longer and signficantly more liquid than your recipe may say. Pearled or semi-pearled farro requires no soaking and cooks in about 20-25 minutes. The trade-off though is fewer nutrients.

Took a long time to make. I used barley instead of farrow and no wine. Tastes great, but maybe too consuming.

This recipe is utter heaven. Wonderful Fall dish. I can't get enough if it and so pretty on the plate.

Everyone loved it and it is a great and slightly different taste. It also looked great served with the coloration from sqush and kale. It was a bit labor intensive but like previous reviewers I roasted the squash the night before which helped a lot. I also needed more liquid (and more cooking time); I originally used vermouth instead of wine and then to supplement the liquid used a combination of water, stock, and a splash more vermouth. Arborio rice might work but I think it would last the earthy taste to match the fall vegetables.

while the end result was delicious, it wasn't quite worth the 1.5+ hours it took from start to finish. if i were to make this again, i'd definitely double the recipe. it was barely enough for my husband and me... and for all that time and effort, i'd definitely want leftovers.

Pretty good. You my have to cook the farro a bit longer to get it tender

I made this in two parts roasting the squash one night and then finishing the rest the next. It is delicious and I can't wait to have it again. I thought I was using kale but actually used swiss chard and substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth since that's what I had on hand. It was great!

this does NOT work with wheat berries - after 2.5 hours of cooking the grain risotto-style (and adding way more water to the mixture), it was still hard...

This is delicious! Couldn't wait to eat my leftovers the next day.

This is delicious! I cooked the farro for much less than an hour and liked the chewiness. The roasted squash was great on its own.

Made this with rich vegetable stock from this site (like beef stock without the beef) and it was a big hit. So much so that my husband, who professes not to look squash or kale, took the leftovers. Used half a butternut squash and will be making it regularly. Obviously, you could use arborio, but the farro is a nice change.

Very good! I used 1 large squash, an entire head of kale, no butter or wine, and barley instead of the farro. I also sauteed the barley on med-high instead of baking, and I just added the chopped kale when I added the first round of stock. Still totally delicious! Tastes like very healthy and hearty risotto!

The flavor in this recipe was fabulous. I am stumped about how to cook the faro adequately. I needed to use about 3 cups additional liquid and the faro was still too crunchy for my liking. I think I will make this again, but will soak the faro prior to using it in the recipe. Overall, a nice, wholesome meal.

Good. Have made this twice and it has been great ( and healthy)

I loved this, and so did my family. "Mom, this is the best thing you ever made." Kid is 22. That was kind of sad, and kind of wonderful. Question: has anyone made it ahead of time and kept it in the oven for a short time? Or done it another way so it would be good for company? Like risotto, it's time intensive at the end, just when you want to be visiting with company. But it is so good I want to serve it to company! By the way, I needed more liquid, too. Just used water because did not have extra broth, and it was delicious. Help appreciated.

I made this recipe exactly has written and it was exceptional. It did require extra broth and patience but you will be rewarded because the outcome is delicious. I made this with the accompanying chicken recipe which was well worth the effort as well. This dish though stands on it's own. I can't wait to make it again.

Excellent concept - I adapted it for what I had on hand and it became Quinoa with spinach and acorn squash. Delicious nonetheless! Very simple and flexible recipe.

This is really good. Give the farro more time and have a bit more liquid on hand. It's pretty much like making a risoto except it doesn't get creamy.

Outstanding! Made with butternut squash (just the bottom round part of the squash) and just toasted the farro in the pot with some butter instead of toasting it in the oven. This dish was exceptional - I cannot wait to make it again! It was just enough for two of us as a main course for dinner - next time I'll double the recipe so we can have leftovers. One of the best recipes I've tried in a while!
