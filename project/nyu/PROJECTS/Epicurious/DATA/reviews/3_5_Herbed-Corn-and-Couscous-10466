I thought this was great! I was looking for a mildly flavored side dish to go with Cornish hens which had garlic, rosemary & lemon. This fit the bill perfectly! I didn't have any fresh chives, so I added about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped shallots just before adding the corn.

I added chopped garlic and used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of chicken broth for my vegetarian husband. Tasty, light side dish that emptied out my pantry! I made it along with the black bean hummus (also on this site). They went together great for easy supper.

Added chopped garlic but otherwise folowed the recipee. Good and easy side dish. Made for a nice salad next day for lunch. My husband said it needed "more bang" so we added leftover diced tomatoes the next day. He liked it better.

Good side dish. I think the chives are wonderful with the corn. I used corn fresh from the farmers' market, but I can imagine frozen would work as well. I made the recipe as written, with no additions or substitutions. Fast and simple and good-tasting. What more could you ask?

I had only had plain couscous before trying this recipe. Since I didn't think the pain couscous was anything exciting, I was curious to try this recipe. Having read the reviews, I decided to only make one addition, and that was to add about a teaspoon of minced garlic to the butter for sauteing the corn. It turned out great. Very, very easy. Served it with the porkchops/applesauce recipt on this site, and the combination was lovely.

I also wanted to do something with some corn I had gotten and needed to use. But where's the herb? I added 2 tablespoons of chopped basil and about 1/4 cup of toasted pine nuts...gave it some crunch and a little more herbiness.

So true! It takes a whopping five minutes to make and is so scrumpy.

Served this with the broiled salmon and apple date chutney. Ohhhh! DELICIOUS!

Honestly? I was looking for something to do with corn, which I bought at the farmers' market yesterday, and I also had chives left over . . .for the effort involved, this was surprisingly (and very subtley) tasty. I substituted olive oil for the butter, but wouldn't change a thing. This will be one of my new staples.

This recipe is a great side dish for lamb. It could not be much easier & quicker to make using frozen corn and chicken stock cubes (as we do).

I made this last night with a soy-honey roasted salmon. Great quick meal that tasted came together quickly. Even my 10-year old liked who usually doesn't like "combinations" liked the couscous with corn.

This works great when grilling because it takes so little time and attention. I think I'll try some other spices in it next time--perhaps some cumin or garlic.

Beyond simple... And a nice accompaniment to so many dishes... I'll definately make again in the summer - especially for a bbq - and the rest of the year.

Ridiculously easy to make with great flavors and textures.
