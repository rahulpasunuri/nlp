This is one of the best recipes that I have ever made . it is sweet and tangy. if you like potatoes and sweet and tangy foods you will love this recipe I highly reccommend this food but you may want to add a little more sugar depending on your taste.

Overall not overly impressed. Not really different than any other roasted potato dish. What set it apart however was the Balsamic vinegar dressing. Kids loved it. Given its simplicity and their liking for it, I will make it again.

I only changed one thing. I didn't toss with cooking spray, I used olive oil. Olive oil is a good type of fat, and cooking spray is made with hydrogenated oil, which is cancer causing. I use it, but sparingly. Tossing with olive oil gave the potatoes a nice moist flavor, very very very tender, my mouth waters just thinking of how good they were! I added all thyme at once, and served with roasted balsamic red onions and roast pork loin with garlic and rosemary, also from this site. Perfect meal!! If I could give it a 5, I would. my sauce was perfect, I didn't find it too strong, and i love the smell of balsamic. Be sure to stir the sugar continuously until it is completely dissolved, maybe that is why some had problems with it solidifying.

I couldn't agree more with what the others said about the vinegar being too overpowering in the sauce. I just should've known better though. It really doesn't make since any way, a vinegar-based sauce on potatoes. Oh well, there are thousands of other recipes to try. Can't love them all!

The balsamic vinegar sauce was a little strong, but that may have been my fault. Otherwise, what a great way to eat new potatoes.

I really wanted to love this recipe because we love balsamic vinegar,but had mixed emotions about it. I used olive oil for roasting, as suggested by another cook - we really liked the flavor so much that it would be worth making up to that point. I had some difficulty with the sauce - I agree with the review that said the vinegar mixture solidified, so will try it again and not allow it to reduce as much - a thinner sauce would probably work well.

My husband and I did not enjoy these potatoes at all! I prepared the recipe exactly as stated. I love balsamic vinegar but it was way to strong of a taste which overpowered the potatoes. My four year old cried from the smell of the kitchen after preparing the balsamic and sugar glaze. There are many other recipes out there that taste much better than these.

The potatoes were delicious, but my balsamic sauce solidified upon contact with the potatoes. I overcooked it I guess. I never had that problem when I made reduced balsamic without sugar. Next time I'll skip the sugar. These potatoes are something I'll want to make again and again. p.s. I used real olive oil rather than spray.

This is a great recipe. The potatoes are wonderful and the balsamic reductions adapts well to a large variety of other uses. It's great on beef, lamb, and other veggies.

This was very good although I have to warm you that the vinegar stunk up the house. The taste was delicious! My husband was scared to taste it because of the smell, but when I finally persuaded him to try it, he took all the sauce! Delicious! Oh, watch that the sauce doesn't overcook or it will stick to the saucepan!

Pretty good. I used dried thyme - worked great. Big hit with the fam. I used it as a side for balsamic-marinated grilled chicken breasts on foccacia bread with romaine, roasted red peppers. Really complemented each other.

This recipe was great and really easy to make. Both my boyfriend and I loved it. I served it with the sirloin steak and balsamic glaze (check out the web site).

An excellent sidedish. This is one of the few recipes I don't change at all. It's also one of a very few potato recipes that my husband (not a potato lover) and I (a starch freak) both love. I toss them with the syrup just before serving.

This is an excellent recipe. I did not have fresh thyme, so used dried and it still was great. I also served to a diabetic guest without the syrup, and he loved it as well.

The potatoes were excellent though I cheated and rubbed oil instead of spray and also added parsley. I love balsamic glaze but this one can stand alone as well.

Simple to make, different and tasty. A keeper!!

This was a very tasty potato dish that I would make again. The vinegar sugar sauce adds a very different flavor. Using the non-stick cooking spray makes it very healthy, yet it is still very good. The sauce became very thick very quickly. Perhaps I overcooked the sauce a little bit, but it would have been nice if the sauce was a little thinner.

A wonderfully different potato dish that is healthy and easy. I used a mixed bag of gourmet potatoes from the farmer's market that gave it a colorful appearence. Using fingerling or similar potatoes gives it a creamy texture. This has become one of my standard side dishes.

The roasted potatoes would have been good on their own, but the balsamic vinegar added a special touch. The only problem with this dish is if you happen to inhale at the same time you take a bite, the vinegar smell is very prominent.
