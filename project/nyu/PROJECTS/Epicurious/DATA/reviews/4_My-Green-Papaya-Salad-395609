I made this salad last night, and while it is quite labor-intensive even compared to other papaya salads I've made, it was worthwhile. The dressing was so delicious, with much more flavour than other versions. I really liked that basil and mint were used, though I also included cilantro leaves. And I added bean sprouts for more crunch, particularly as the store had no papaya and just ripe mango. Overall, though, a really well balanced and intriguing combination. Only warning- it doesn't last that well in the frigidaire, the herbs and fruit were fairly mangled come next day.
