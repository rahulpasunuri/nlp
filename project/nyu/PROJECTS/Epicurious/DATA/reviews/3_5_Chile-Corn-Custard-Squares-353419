I added cumin and am hoping the salsa topping helps them, but these are just an exceedingly bland and boring base. Why bother to make something to then rely on the flavor of purchased ingredients (salsa & sour cream) to improve it? Will not make these again.

These were a hit as a Thanksgiving Day appetizer. I followed others suggestion of cumin in the onions and made them as bite size muffins. Took about 18 minutes in the oven.

This recipe had such great reviews. I wanted to bring these to a bunco night. Many reviewers made them in mini muffin tins. Being an experienced cook, I tried and followed a reviewers 10 minutes in the oven (sounded reasonable) not even close to done. I put them back in but after 10+ more minutes they still weren't done. I may have to try the recipe again but it was sure a flop the first time around. Can't even comment on the flavor. I had to go to plan "B" for bunco!

Quick, easy, delicious. Great for brunch or as a side dish. For instance: to accompany barbecue or as a fun first course served atop a green salad.

First these were amazing. I usually don't like a reviewer to change a recipe and then rate it. So I will say they are great as written. But. . . I did not have jalapenos, but used Monterrey Jack with jalapenos instead of the Mexican blend cheese. This gave it the kick it needed. I also added cumin to the onions like another reviewer suggested. I sprayed mini muffin tins with Pam for baking, placed 1 tablespoon of batter in them, topped them with cheese and baked them about 10 minutes. Perfect bite size appetizers. The recipe makes about 24. Fantastic! Then I put it over the top by topping them with a smoked tomato salsa I made from a recipe on another website. This recipe will be one I will make time and again. Have not tried to freeze them for later use, but do not see any reason they would not freeze well.

My MIL made this for a T-giving appetizer & we all loved it. She uses Frontera hot chipotle salsa. I'm going to use the ideas below to make in mini muffin tins, double & bake in 9x13 pan, and make larger to serve w/soup. Thanks all!

Delish, creamed corn made me a little uneasy, but it was tasty.

Very nice addition to our Old spanish days celebration here is Santa Barbara. I did not garnish it but served it with salsa. I did add some cumin and accidently baked it in a 9x13" but they still turned out quite nice. Would really like to try it with the jam noted by another reviewer. It was very easy to make.

This was really good ane everyone loved it. I would definately bring it to any party. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. Don't skip the cutting and garnishing steps of the recipe. . . very important.

so easy to make, and tasty too. served it with little dollops of the sundried tomato onion jam (recipe also on this site) and as a side to gazpacho instead of an appetizer. used a serrano instead of jalapeno, but will definitely try the cumin w/the onions next time. mmmm.

This was a really delicious little appetizer and went well with the modern fiesta menu.

I enjoyed this spicy and interesting new recipe. I did make some changes, added 1/2 tsp. cumin in with the onions while sauteing, and I also added green onions at the end.

Outstanding, everyone loved it, just wish I had doubled the recipe. As this was the first time making it, I followed the directions as written, fabulous, I wouldn't change a thing. It is not a "do ahead", but I just had all the ingredients measured and set aside and just mixed and baked, very easy.

This was a pretty good dish, very easy to make. I was just playing around at home and added a bit of leftover bacon, which was good, but not necessary. It could work well as a side dish as well as an appetizer. I think in the future I will make it in mini muffin tin for appetizers.
