Easy and quick brine recipe. I've used others before but this one can be accomplished by using standard pantry items. I only had time to brine for 24 hours but the result was still an amazingly moist turkey.

Used this simple brine for our Thanksgiving turkey this year. For a 12# turkey, I lined a large stock pot with a turkey roasting bag. I made 1/2 of the brine recipe without any changes. Placed the turkey into the bag and poured the brine over. I placed the pot in the fridge and let it sit for 2 days. This was the most moist turkey that I have ever cooked. One thing, be sure to rinse the bird well inside and out before cooking. I will never cook another turkey without brining it first.
