This recipe is delicious. Would highly recommend it, followed recipe exactly. Do not leave out the mint or the peanuts -- they really take it to the next level!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I made a few modifications. I added half the peanuts and cilentro (instead of mint) to the blender along with the dressing ingredients. Used shallots instead of red onion. I also added too much hot pepper for my liking so to "cool" it down I added a chopped and peeled apple. The texture of the apple worked quite well I thought. Flavours were great and I would make it again.

Really enjoyed this, and it was easy to make. Forgot the peanuts, and only had oyster sauce. Still great. I did add 1 shaved carrot, and topped with fresh cilantro, but feel if I just stuck to the recipe it still would be very good. Super refreshing! (red pepper might also be good.) Try it!

I was looking for the cucumber salad you get at Thai restaurants as a side, but this wasn't quite it. It seemed to need more sugar but also lacked tartness (I know that sounds contradictory)- rice vinegar, perhaps? The red onion was too potent; I'd recommend chopping it instead of slicing it and reducing the quantity. I won't be making this recipe again.

I've made this recipe many times. Although the fish sauce makes it smell bad, the taste is phenominal. I sometimes add (steamed) shrimp at the end.

Very tasty. A refreshing change from our usual cucumber salads. We appreciate that it's lower in fat, since there's no oil or sour cream. Next time around, we're going to look to reduce the sodium by making a substitution or reducing the fish sauce and lightly salted peanuts.

Used regular cukes and sliced them 1/2" thick. I also sub'd in palm sugar as is traditional in Thai cooking. Added heat with chili-garlic sauce, and garnished with cilantro, and dry-roasted peanuts. Served as a side for Gai Yang with a sweet chili-garlic sauce, and Thai Red Cargo rice. Delicious, and easy accompaniment for the Thai-inspired meal.

Perfect! Tasted just like the Thai restaurant's salad and my non-cooking husband made it on his own! I was so proud. It is labor intensive if you don't have an automated chopper or knives skills but other than that, amazing.

Found this salad to be light and tasty-needed a little more punch for me but I didn't put the entire amount of jalapeno it called for-think a splash of vinegar might help.. Could be mixed with chicken for a meal.

It was just ok. I made it with a noodle and peanut sauce entree and if we mixed it together it was better. Had a bit of a sour flavor. Perhaps because I used stevia rather than sugar. I'm made better cucumber salads before.

Easy enough that I assigned this to my husband to make while I worked on the rest of the meal. Fresh taste, nice for a change, but not something memorable; probably won't make again.

Yum. I love the sweet, savoury, spicy, and sour flavours in the dressing. The mint is excellent and the peanuts really make the dish. Sometimes I add yellow, orange, and/or red pepper to the mix. It is a household favourite!

I added carrots for color and the result was pleasing. The carrots remained slightly al dente and was a nice contrast to the cucumbers.

whoa! this totally rocked. Made few changes - shallots for red onion because I needed to use them up, and dry roast peanuts because I think regular are greasy. Fish sauce uncooked didn't bother me at all. Fresh and fabulous!!!

Very good, cool and refreshing. We served it with cilantro-crusted salmon. I use less red onion, and it seemed a little too salty so I used unsalted peanuts, and didn't add any salt at the end.

One of my favorite Thai cucumber salad recipes. Great with fresh rolls and Pad Thai.

Rating: 2
I thought the (raw) fish sauce was too overwhelming. I used a normal grocery store brand that works very well when used in cooked dishes. I also substituted anaheims for the jalapenos and that was a mistake as the salad definitely needed a bit more kick. I may try it again with less fish sauce and more vibrant chiles.

This is a great recipe, fresh, colorful, flavorful and easy. I recommend it with the chicken curry coconut soup. Great combination. Big hit!!

Excellent! The leftover vinaigrette left on your plate is great with rice as well. Very flavorful. Would definitely make again. Chili flakes would also make a nice garnish if you like your salad spicier and I might try it with fried shallots as well next time.

this was quick and excellent - tasted like something you'd get in a thai restaurant. i just did a few drops of fish sauce, since it grosses my out when not cooked, and did a tsp or so of rice vinegar too as another reviewers suggested, and it was great! served it in little porcelain bowls with chopsticks. a treat.

A definite step up from the cucumbers in vinegar & sugar with green onion that I grew up on! It is a great side to any Thai dish or simple grilled chicken or pork. I served last with the Thai-Spice Pork Tenderloin with Orange Curry Sauce from this site. It keeps well, just be sure to sprinkle the peanuts on just the portion you are serving to keep the nice contrast of texutre. Will definitely be making again when the garden yields it's excess of cukes.

It was good, but needed a little more tang. I followed recipe exactly

Rating: 3
Made a couple of changes in this recipe, so that affected the end result. I used 1 1/2 regular cukes, quartered lengthwise then sliced; subbed cayenne pepper in the dressing for the jalapenos (I am allergic), and added some grated ginger to the dressing, along with the garlic. This was really nice and refreshing, but there wasn't enough dressing (the recipe's fault) and too much cayenne (my fault). It's worth tweaking, though. I'll definitely make it again, but increase the lime juice and the sugar (probably sub turbinado sugar for white), and add more mint. The fish sauce was pretty okay.

Really love this version of the Asian style salad. I did use Splenda instead of sugar, making it very South Beach and healthy. Served it with Asian Lettuce Wraps from this site. Both easy as pie to make.

I practically LIVE on this salad in the summer when it's too hot to cook. I also tend to add cilantro and sometimes basil, too. Shallots are a good substitute if you don't have red onions.

I also added some grated lime-peel and substituted the jalapeños for thai chilli, but otherwise everything just as in the recipe. Very, very good one. Might try grounding some dried shrimp next time, or maybe just lots of fresh black pepper (dried shrimp is too hard to find here.

An excellent dish. I used small Lebanese cucumbers instead of English, white onion (soaked in water for an hour to make it sweeter) because I didn't have red, and substituted sambal oelek instead of jalapeno in the dressing. It was crunchy and fresh. I'd definitely make it again.

This was a great side dish to a thai dinner - I cut back on the Jalepeno so it wouldn't be too hot for my guests. I used sweet onion instead of red and put extra chopped peanuts on the side as a condiment.

I loved the dressing - it would get 4 forks - but the salad itself wasn't as impressive. After making the recipe as listed once, I made the dressing with the following salad: Asian greens (premixed bag), cucumber, julienned carrots, red pepper, bean sprouts, and roasted peanuts. This dressing with this salad is sooooo good!

I think this is an excellent side dish to pad tai and other thai dishes. Because I generally have cilantro on hand for pad thai, I use that instead of the mint. I used an attachment on my food processor to get the cucucumber and red onion sliced very thinly.

I give this 3 1/2 forks. It was certainly easy. The "original" recipe is a great accompaniment for a thai-style meal - simple, crunchy, light - and that's how I served it. It is not, however, in my opinion the "star" side dish of a buffet as is. I agree with others that if I were making it as a side dish for a meal, I would modify it for color (especially) and add mangoes, diced red pepper and/or jicama but then it loses its Thai authenticity..... Still, I would definitely make again.

Just came back from the cottage with 18 friends and this dish was a hit! I added sweet, ripe, green mangoes to each cucumber and sliced the mangoes in a julienne manner. Due to the amount of people eating this dish I chose not to add the chili peppers and soaked the red onions in hot water for a couple of minutes. I also subsituted the peanuts for cashews. Great recipe! The smell of the sauce is deceiving however, have faith. The flavours all marry into eachother. YUM!You can add boiled chicken breast to make it a meal. It's a keeper!

3 and a half forks. My husband and I both liked this recipe a lot. It's light, fresh and very pleasing. I didn't have enough cucumber, so I used thinly sliced sweet bell peppers to round it out. Do use fresh mint if you have it - the taste of fresh mint is such an AAAHH... sensation.

I've made this about five times now and it's getting better all the time. I usually make it as an accompaniment to Green Curry Chicken, also on this site. It's fresh and spicy at the same time. Just don't be too generous with the peanuts, it shouldn't be too crunchy.

I loved this and so did all my dinner guests. I didn't bother salting and draining the cabbage, which saved a lot of time. I added grated carrots for color and some chopped cilantro. I also sprinkled on some chopped roasted peanuts and crumbled fried wonton wrappers which added a lot of crunch. The recipe suggests that you can prepare it 2 hours in advance, but I would caution you to dress it at the last minute to keep the cabbage from wilting. Delicious

Absolutely delicious! I cut back on the amount of red onion and made some adjustments to the dressing until I was satisfied with the balance of flavors. I sliced the cucumbers and onion ahead of time and dressed it before serving; if you do that, be prepared to drain a fair amount of water from the cucumbers. I can't wait to make this again.

Delicious! It got a rave review from my dinner guest. I also substituted cilantro for the mint, 1 teaspoon anchovy paste for the fish sauce and spring green onions for the red onions. I pureed the dressing ingredients with the cilantro in a food processor and made a sort of pesto to pour on top of the cucumber and onions.

Made this yesterday and I should have followed the advice of others and reduced the onion quantity (and probably eased up on the pepper too). It's still good though. One other tip - be careful when you cut up that jalapeno pepper! I did not think to put gloves on and my fingers burned for a few hours afterwards!

I've made this recipe many times throughout the recent string of heatwaves. I replace 1/2 of the cucumber with Jicama matchsticks (really quick when you use a mandolin - the Ben Riner is avail at Williams Sonoma for about $30). With the jicama the dish is super light, crunchy and very refreshing. It's a real crowd-pleaser when paired with grilled meats (see Sesame Beef kebabs - absolutely delicious together even though the kebabs aren't Thai in origin). I also add the red pepper for color and a hint of sweetness. The cucumber-jicama version doesn't get soggy and is even better the next day .

Refreshing summer salad. I serve it with chicken and shrimp sate. However, this recipe yields too much dressing and not enough salad, so I added an additional cucumber and 1/4 onion. This can also be made with kirby cucumbers which eliminates the need for seeding them.
