Too bad this recipe is mis-labeled! This is really a biscotti & a delicious one too! The only change I made was adding 1 whole egg to mix and not using egg white as glaze. Recipe made 3 dozen medium size biscotti.

I was intimidated by the idea of having 7 dozens cookies of which I had no clue how they would taste, so on my first go I made only a half recipe. I used sliced almonds as I didn't have whole ones, mixed peel (as used in Christmas cake) instead of candied orange, and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the spices for more variety. Preparing and baking were no trouble, though perhaps using milk to brush the cookies with instead of egg white would be more economical (brushing is minimal: not worth an egg white). These biscuits are a form of biscotti and look very elegant, more than their English name ('crunchy spice cookies' versus the Italian 'piparelli') would suggest. They taste like gingerbread too. Nice!
