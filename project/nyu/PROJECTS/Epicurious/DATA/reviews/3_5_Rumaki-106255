Probably the best traditional interpretation. I highly recommend. I also made this for my Mad Men party and it was a big hit. It's a great choice if you want "mock" rumaki without the liver and with extra polynesian flair. http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/03/retro-food-redux-mad-men-viewing-party.html

The small, 1/2" pieces of liver wrapped in a half slice of bacon was a nice combination. Pre-cook bacon by microwaving five full strips for two minutes, sandwitching the bacon between layers of paper towels on a plate. This makes assembly much easier.

Rumakis were a holiday staple in our home growing up, and this recipe is very similar to my mothers. One thing she used to do different is instead of chicken livers she used to use chicken thighs for the liver haters. I myself got used to eating them this way and now find that if you are cooking for picky eaters the thighs are a safe choice.

Love this recipe. I can't stop eating them when I make it. The preparation is time consuming -- wrapping in bacon is a real pain -- but the results totally make it worthwhile.

I really loved the flavors of this recipe. I wish I had taken the "partially cook bacon" advice as it would have made for easier assmebly (silppery little buggers) and more even cooking. My guests enjoyed the texture and flavor and were shocked when the learned they were eating chicken livers.

This episode was a bit time consuming, but worth it! My guests loved it. I made them ahead of time and reheated for 10 minutes at 300 when guests arrived. They turned out great! :)

At my freind's recommendation I used larger size pieces of liver & would not do so again. The liver overwhlemed the other flavors. Although they were yummy I would keep to the recipe the next time. I think equal sizes of liver/chesnut would make for better pairing of flavors.

This recipe is very similar to the one I use with exception of the curry. I have found that dipping the rumaki into tempura batter after assembling & before frying makes the rumaki a wonderful hit with family & guests.

This recipe took a bit longer and I cooked them ahead of time and heated them up just before serving. I thought they were rich and delicious, but family who don't care for liver decided(after finding out it was liver) they were not desirable. So moral is--don't tell them it has chicken livers and they will love them.

I've always loved rumaki, and this is a great recipe for it. Assembly can be a little fiddly with raw ingredients, so I partially cook the bacon and the livers (30% on the bacon, 40% on the livers - but careful with the livers, they cook fast!).

I gave this 4 forks to encourage people to try it. I have been making Rumaki for years but with my own marinade. I have not tried this marinade so I am unqualified to judge it. I do feel qualified however, to add insight in general terms. Chicken livers should be not less than 3/4". Water Chestnuts 1/8 to 3/16". I also precook bacon 20% before broiling because ck livers cook faster than bacon. You want them pink inside.
