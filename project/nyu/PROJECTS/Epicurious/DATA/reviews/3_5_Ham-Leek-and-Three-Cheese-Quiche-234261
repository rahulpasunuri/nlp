This is a very rich recipe with 90% of it being cheese...not complaining though!!! It is excellent!!! My suggestions are two things: First, USE A FOOD PROCESSOR. Save your wrists grating the cheese and whipping the custard. Second, I strongly suggest folding the cheese/leek (and in my version I add asparagus) together in a large bowl, then add the custard mixture...fold together...and pour into the ham-lined pie shell. Saves on the mess of adding it to the shell. Also, I used a pre-made frozen deep pie crust. Didn't negatively affect the flavor at all.

So it was pretty good. At high altitude, it took about an hour to bake. I think if the mozzerella was substituted with extra-sharp cheddar, it would be much better. I added spinach to mine too, just to throw in some veggies. I'd do again with the tweak noted above, and perhaps I'll try with bacon next time.

This was sensational! Might have to call the cardiologist after eating it so only for special occasions but worth the fat and calorie splurge. My quiche took almost 2 hours to bake.

I hesitated to rate this as I made some significant changes but I really liked the results so wanted to share. I made this without a crust to reduce the carb content. Instead, I used an 11 inch ceramic quiche dish, buttered and dusted heavily with finely grated parmesan. The other changes included using 3 cups of strong cheddar, chopped leftover ham, and adding a 1/2tsp salt to the custard mixture. I then layered in half the grated cheese followed by the ham, the leeks, the rest of the cheese, and the custard. It was baked through in an hour with some browning on top. This is a great weeknight supper dish but I might reduce cheese a bit next time.

I'm a big fan of quiches and this one is truly outstanding! I made some substitutions to suit my tastes: I used black forest ham, gouda in place of the mozzarella (but I still used the gruyere and fontina) and subbed sour cream for the creme fraiche because I was on a budget. The leeks give such a wonderful mellow flavor where onions would have overpowered. The balance of flavors was perfect and everyone at my brunch really loved this. The one complaint I have is that the sliced ham was hard to cut through with the edge of a fork so unless you had a knife it kind of came apart when you ate it. The slices made for a beautiful presentation peaking out the sides of the quiche but I think to make it easier to eat I will chop it up next time.

Haven't made it yet....but quiche is always made in a deep dish like tart shell, never in a pie shell, that's why it sounds a lot for a pie shell

My husband declared this "God's perfect food." I made it for a tea party and they loved it! This will be go to dish now. I also added bacon. Make it! : )

First, if you follow the recipe exactly, I promise all of the ingredients DO fit into the pie pan. I used a store bought frozen one, and it came out perfectly. I didn't substitute anything, didn't need to, it was a perfect and delicious recipe on its own.

I am slowly learning to enjoy eating eggs and egg-based dishes. The wonderful, savory aromas from cooking the contents of this quiche (esp. the leeks, but we also add twice-smoked bacon) are just the right temptation to draw me in. We have made this several times now and I love it more each time (!). We use puff pastry instead of a pie shell and use a round cake pan instead of a pie pan. We vary the ingredients, but always keep the layer of ham at the bottom--it's perfect to ensure a tasty bite each time!

I made this for a baby shower, followed the recipe as was written except I added asparagus and I found it to be very bland, not much taste at all.

To the reviewer who commented that it was "snobby" to exclude frozen pie crusts: It's not snobby, it's about volume. The refrigerated ( Pillsbury red box) pie crusts called for in the recipe will go in a deep dish ( typically Pyrex) glass pie pan which holds significantly more volume than a typical frozen pie crust. There are commercial deep dish frozen pie crusts- I find they still hold less volume than my Pyrex. This may be the reason some people are having an issue with the recipe being too much for the pan. I thought so too as I was assembling the quiche- no way that was all going to fit! But I just put mine in the oven with the whole recipe. :-)

I baked and brought this quiche to work for a brunch event. I used asparagus and 1/4 cup of onion instead of the leeks. It was a hit!!! everyone loved it.

This was a great recipe. I made this for brunch and my guests raved about the dish. I will make this again, because it was so easy and it was a delicious make-ahead meal. I served the quiche with candied bacon and a side salad. Also, I substituted the smoked ham for Boar's Head Tavern Ham, which is a little sweeter and yummy. Unlike other reviewers, I did not have problems with all of the ingredients fitting into the pie pan. Also, I did not add more salt, because there is already a lot of salt in the cheeses. Note: it took a little longer to heat up the next morning than prescribed.

I made this quiche a few days ago and i was thrilled with the results. It was the best quiche I have made yet. I made some adjustments: I did use gruyere cheese, but for the rest of the cheeses I bought a kraft mix of mozza, parmesan and two other types of cheese, and the resulting taste was exceptional. also, buying pre-washed, cut and diced leeks is a huge time saver.

Rating: 3
I agree with previous reviewers who said this will not fit into a 9" pie pan--it is a bit too much! I have decreased the cheese/ham/leek components and been happy with the result. This is a good brunch dish that you can make ahead and warm up.

Now my local supermarket did not have creme fraiche today, so I substituted sour cream and a little plain yogurt. My other change is I used sliced honey baked ham rather than smoked, and gave it another 15 minutes cooking time. This quiche is yummy.

Disappointing. Bistro Jeanty is one of my very favorite restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly - no substitutions. I thought it dull and boring. The creme fraiche overwhelmed all the other flavors.

Yummy! I made this for a dinner party and had it again for breakfast. It is great, just as the recipe is written (except I did use sour cream instead of creme fraich) and not too hard to pull off. I'll keep this for future use!

i live four miles from Bistro Jeanty and love the restaurant and this recipe. however,the recipe needs salt at some point in the process. and if you follow the measurement exactly, it will not fit into a 9" pie shell. the result is still great if you substitute very crispy bacon or pancetta instead of the ham

This was very good! My only complaint is I think the leeks were too large. Next time, I will cut them smaller.

Since I didn't want the gooey texture some of the others found, I reduced the amount of cheese by 1/2 a cup. I also ended up using sour cream rather than creme fraiche. And I baked it for slightly over 1 1/2 hour (checking it starting at 1 1/4). The resulting texture was perfect! Cut cleanly and held together beautifully on a plate. My guests loved it and most had seconds!

This quiche is perfectly delicious and well worth the fidgety trouble of grating cheeses and cutting up leeks. HOWEVER the instruction that you can't use a commercial 9" pie crust is, well, an unnecessary piece of snobbery. I find that it works fine, so long as you reduce the amount of creme fraiche to one container. OR, since it's hard to buy just three ounces of cheese, you can double the recipie and make one to freeze if you buy half a pound of each of the cheeses & ham, double the leeks and eggs, but use only two containers of creme fraiche. Since commercial pie crusts often come in pairs, so much the better!

I made this as the main dish for a birthday tea party for my mother - never have received such rave reviews for one of my quiches before. It does take a ton of cheese, and indeed barely fit into the shell, but it still turned out wonderful. I made two of them, and changed some of the veggies in the 2nd version, and used some swiss instead of straight guyere, and it was just really very good. --Janene from theweedpatch.typepad.com

We really enjoyed this recipe, although it is pretty greasy given all the cheese in it. To be expected, I guess. I am making it again next weekend! It does take at least an hour and a half to bake all the way through. I made exactly like it reads...

A decadent & rich quiche - very good. We had this at the restaurant and I never thought I would actually find the recipe. Yes, it is soft compared to most quiches. But this in no way detracts from the deliciousness. A must try!

As a note to the people who have commented on the consistency of the dish. I recently had this at the restaurant and was surprised that it was not the "normal" quiche consistency. It was more gooey and cheesy than an average quiche would be -- so you probably got it right.

Very disappointed with this dish. It was a lot of work, and I ended up throwing 1/2 of it away. The pie dish size recommended for the recipe is too small to hold the quiche (I didn't use all of the cheese to make sure there was enough room). I had the same problem as the reviewer from Annapolis. I cooked it for close to the maximum recommended cook time, and yet it did not set and was mushy/goopy. In addition, my family thought that the leeks overpowered the dish (and they didn't like the size of the leek pieces).

Made in a 9.5" deep glass pie plate and while assembling it seemed like there wouldn't be room for all the ingredients but it was perfect. Cut ham into chunks instead of layering and prebaked pie shell then brushed with beaten egg and returned to oven for 5 minutes which helped keep crust crisp. Very tasty.

Rating: 3
OK I did love the taste but I have a question about the texture - I baked this in a 10 inch pie plate, so figured it would take less time, but still cooked for an hour and 20 minutes and then let it sit. But when we ate it the texture was more ooze than the firm texture I usually expect from a quiche. Is this the way it's supposed to be, or did I do something wrong?

This quiche is delicious! Every time that I make it, it's gone in seconds and everyone asks me to make another one the next day...people just can't get enough. I did substitute heavy whipping cream for the creme fraiche because I couldn't find any, and it still turned out perfectly.

This was great! It was also the first quiche I've ever made - super easy. The store only had pre-made shells or phyllo dough, so I went with phyllo and it was wonderful! I used about ten sheets, buttered in between each. I half-baked the crust before filling it, and then cooked the quiche for an hour (which was all it needed.)

My husband and I were extremely disappointed with this recipe. The ham and leeks were fine, and the light texture of the custard was nice. But my usual combination of Swiss and sharp cheddar create a much more flavorful quiche for considerably less money.

Made this for my mom today for brunch (as written) except for leeks, store was out - sub'd w/ onion and small cubes of ham, vs. sliced. It was DELICIOUS! So much flavor w/ all the cheeses - and although a little costly - definately worth it! Hubby said it was the best he ever had (he doesn't like quiche!)

I did my own crust. Covered it while blind baking it, except for the last 5 mins. I didn't cover it afterwards and both, top and borders, were just perfectly golden. It does need the standing time.

Oh my gosh this is soooo good...if you are even considering this, definitely try. This was the best quiche I ever had! Very easy to make. Only change I made was using bacon instead of ham...only because bacon was already in the frig. and did not want to spend the extra $ to buy ham. Also, concerning the foil, I did not cover the entire quiche with foil, just the crust to keep it from over browning. Made a ring with the foil, and left the center open. Browned beautifully

Quite possibly the best quiche I've ever tried, anywhere. And I even used a pre-shaped frozen pie crust! (because it was late on a weeknight) - it worked just fine. I made a lot of improvised changes to the quantities since it looked like there was going to be too much filling for my pie shell, but the key to the recipe is the high proportion of creme fraiche used. I have always used creme fraiche when making quiches but never this much - and it makes for a fantastically rich, moist quiche.

Very rich, but delicious. To add some veggies, I places blanched asaparagus spears on top of the quiche in a pinwheel design before baking. I made this for dinner Friday night, and we enjoyed it reheated for brunch Sat morning.

DELICIOUS!!. Served this today.I followed the directions and did not have any problems with recipe. Made this 2 days in advance. Cut and reheated at low temp. Used Pillsburg crust, would make my own next time as crust sides pullled apart from quiche. This is so easy and creamy. I am in a gourmet ladies group and they all loved it.

Supremely decadent! Chopped up some leftover Honeybaked Ham instead of using thin slices and it worked out well. Also took the foil off after 45 minutes, then baked for another 35. The custard puffed up and browned nicely.

I followed the recipe exactly and baked the quiche until it didn't wobble at all -- no visable liquid in the middle. I let it cool 45 minutes before cutting it, and still got a gush of uncooked custard that puddled in the pie plate where the "slice" was removed. I ate it, it didn't kill me, but I'll go back to Cook's Illustrated -- The Best Recipe quiche recipes instead of this again.

My husband requested a ham and broccoli quiche, so I found this recipe and just substituted broccoli for the leeks. Turned out great and he raved about the flavor of the cheeses. Now I definitely want to try it with the leeks. Next time I'll try leaving the foil off for at least half the baking time because the foil kept the top from browning.

Most creamiest, delicious quiche I've ever made!!! Followed directions explicitly, except for cleaning leaks. It's easier to clean larger portions, so I chopped off dark leaves and bottom, cleaned, dried, then chopped. I premade and reheating worked out perfectly. Fab!!! Everyone loved!!!

This quiche is absolutely delicious!!I made a few substitutions so to use up what I had in my fridge so quite a different version but worked well. I used tasty cheese only instead of the 3 different types of cheeses.I also used a mix of creme fraiche light and sour cream. I used 2 leeks instead of 3. I cooked the quiche for 1 hour and found this sufficient.
