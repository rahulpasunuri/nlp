This is pretty bland. I made it a bit more healthy by using canola oil instead of butter. I also did not use eggs. I added a jalepeno pepper and some Italian seasonings. But I ended up needing catsup to eat it!

This is great as written BUT with sweet potatoes, cooked and sautéed it is fabulous and healthier. Red pepper is pretty nice too.

This is a great way to use up leftovers. I make a bread and potato dressing with my turkey so I added that to the potatoes...very good. Didn't have a green pepper so I cut up some garlic as well. Yum Yum

This was way better than I thought it would be and I will be making it whenever I have leftover turkey. I used regular green bell pepper and added a minced jalapeno.

Delicious! Am not a leftover turkey fan, and this recipe was just what I needed to ENJOY our leftovers this year. I couldn't find the cubanells, so I used a green bell pepper and 1 scotch bonnet...just enough heat. Also am impatient, so microwaved the potatoes for 3 minutes before shredding (in the food processor).

A friend gave me fresh eggs, so I stumbled on this looking for an easy recipe. Great! I tossed several different veggies from my farm share and use leftover chicken (which you can completely skip if you don't have it). I also tossed some grated jack cheese on top. I'd never prepared potatoes this way and thought it was really handy.

This dish is pretty darn good. I was looking for a dish to make after Christmas. We didn't have leftover turkey, so I used 1 lb ground turkey instead. I cooked the turkey one day earlier, and I also chopped the onion and peppers earlier. So this morning, I just boiled the potatoes. I didn't even need to grate them, I just crumbled them into the pan after I sauteed the onions and peppers. I used arugula for the greens and tossed in two handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese. There was no hash left on anyone's plate when we cleaned up. We fed five people with this recipe and are quite happy to still have leftovers. I will definitely make this dish again not only for breakfast, but for dinner, too!

This has officially become a Thanksgiving tradition in my house--we've made it every year since it was published! Easy to make and so delicious. Highly recommend!

I plan to make this part of Thanksgiving breakfast each year--it is great. My only suggestion is that you really do not need 7 tablespoons of butter. I used about 5 and it was enough.

So easy to make! I've made this the day after Thanksgiving with leftover turkey for the last two years and now it's become a tradition. We go shopping in the early morning and come back and make this hash. It's wonderful!
