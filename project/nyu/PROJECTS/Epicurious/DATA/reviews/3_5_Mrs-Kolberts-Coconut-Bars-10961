I love these. Not only are they easy to make, they are different from other bars, don't require a lot of ingredients, and delish. I actually used fresh coconut from the backyard (I live in Mexico!) so added about 1/8 cup more sugar and a little bit of corn syrup to make sure it was moist. The combination of almond and coconut was fantastic. This is a new favorite in my recipe book.

I was cleaning out my baking cabinet and had just enough coconut to make these and barely enough brown sugar. I also had a good sized chunk of Callebaut dark chocolate. I had sliced toasted almonds in the fridge from another recipe and really hoped that they would work in their already toasted condition. AMAZING. I made the recipe as written and then grated the chocolate on the top right after it came out of the oven (not a huge chocolate fan) It melted, it is gorgeous. This is probably a winter-y cookie - but I doubt if there will be one bar left by tomorrow. Can't wait to be the cookie fairy and drop some off at friends' houses... Thanks Mrs. Kolbert

These bars are delicious. I have made variations pecans and milk chocolate chips. These are addictive. Everyone that tries them loves them.

version for a hawaiian friend's birthday treat. ditched the almonds, subbed finely chopped toasted macadamia to the crust, salted butter (was what i had), unsweetened coconut, and added fresh chopped pineapple and chopped white chocolate to the topping mixture. delicious, dense without being tough and the flavor's fantastic.

We loved loved loved this yummy bar, fast easy and the kids made it! I didn't have any almonds so we used same amount of chopped pecans. We also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Very versatile.

Just want to mention that this is an old traditional recipe known as London Bars (not sure why). Our recipe box holds a version obtained years ago from a friend of my grandmother, known for her baking, and -- aside from calling for walnuts instead of almonds -- it's identical. These are an easy, time-tested favorite. Highly recommended.

delicious! very yummy! I topped it with lemon zest and chopped almonds. I added less almonds and I did not have enough coconut. I added a tablespoon of milk and a squeeze of lime and it was a nice taste! I will definitely make again!

To me, it's ESSENTIAL to let this sit for a day or two, or even longer. The flavors don't bind properly unless you let them sit and develop. Otherwise, great creation that looks a lot more difficult to pull off than it actually is.

Easy to make and everyone loves 'em. Try them with macadamia nuts instead of almonds.

I didn't have a 13x9 pan, and since the reviews stated this was a thin cookie, I went ahead and did it in a 9x9 pan for a thicker cookie. Consequently, it came out pretty thick and gooey. I will try again with a 13x9 pan to see how it is different. Even thick and gooey, it was well received and I will definitely make again!

These are fantastic! I used unsweetened coconut and added 1/2 c of chocolate chips, and they were PLENTY sweet--probably overwhelming for someone without my pathological sweet tooth. I also used roasted almonds instead of blanched. Delicious--had to freeze most of them to keep from eating them all!

Very easy and very good! Will be part of my holiday baking every year from now on!

I made a batch of these for a summer birthday gift and substituted macademias for the almonds. Very easy, and very good, but more like candy than a cookie. The flavors and textures were both wonderful, but I think I would prefer a shortbread crust to the the chewy, carmelly crust of this recipe. For the holidays, I might try these again with dried cranberries.

I thought this recipe was great. The bars were so quick and easy. Plus not only do they taste great but they look fancy - I received many compliments and requests to make them again.

Just the thing I was looking for to satisfy my coconut sweet tooth---didn't have enough light brown sugar so had to use dark which made them dark but still chewy & sweet--better the next day

This resulted in a wonderful sweet treat; classic flavors, excellent texture & very easy to make. Its debut in my household was for a Halloween party potluck and it was the first item devoured on the buffet. I was almost embarassed to give out the much requested recipe, as it is so very simple for such a nice result. Coconut lovers, rejoyce!

I've been making these for years now, my favorite bar recipe. If you like chewy bars, you'll love these. I think unsweetened coconut works better and prefer walnuts to almonds.

These cookies were very good, and I don't even like coconut!

Thess were awesome! I made these for Christmas and everyone raved. Plus, they were incredibly easy.

I agree with the reviewer from Charlottesville. With all the great ingredients, you'd think these would be absolutely irresistible, but they weren't. They were okay, not great, just okay.

These cookies are amazing.

I love coconut, and after reading the other reviews was surprised to find myself disliking these bars. They were easy to make and smelled great when they came out of the oven. But, I found them bland and without much taste at all.

My family concurs that this is a great recipe. It's very easy, and looks and tastes rich and delicious. Cut into 48 means little squares, not bars. It really makes 24 generous bars and I wish I could only eat one!

I took these to work, and my co-workers loved them. I substituted Skor bits for the nuts, and they had a nice flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

The reviews convinced me to make these cookies. At the risk of sounding like a member of the Amen chorus -- Amen!! fabulous

Very tasty and yummy, but as a chocolate lover, next time I'll try mixing in some minature chocolate chips.

Yummmmmmmmy! I love these, and they were very easy to make. I will definetly make these again.

These are delish!! It's sort of like a pecan pie in a bar. When it's warm, just out of the oven, it's really sweet, and goes great with vanilla ice cream. I liked it better the next day - it's not as sweet and really chewy. I'll definitely make it again (I'll probably add it to my Christmas baking list, too.) Thanks, Mrs, Kolbert!

Instantly addictive. I sent these out in my Christmas cookie packages - and all 8 recipients called me for the recipe.

When I was called upon to make a cookie bar without any chocolate, I was at a loss until I found this recipe. It was not only attractive and delicious to eat, but also easy to make.

This was quick, easy, and clean, compared to most bar recipes. I warmed the baking pan to spread the bottom layer more easily, and used buttered wax paper to spread the top layer on. Although it was delicious as is, next time I'm throwing in some bittersweet chocolate chips. The bars are a little thin, but golden and nice looking.
