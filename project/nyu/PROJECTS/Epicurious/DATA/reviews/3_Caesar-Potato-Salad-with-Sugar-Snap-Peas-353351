Made this for a ladies' lunch and got compliments. Heeded the words about the sugar snap peas getting overdone so I just stringed and sliced them and tossed them in raw. Gave lots of crunch, more healthy and unusual.

The dressing is perfect if you use high quality mustard and olive oil. I tried a Herbs de Provence moutarde, and it shined through. I skipped the veggies due to the one comment that they changed color, which I wanted to avoid. I have tried this with red potatoes and now for the second time, with gold potatoes. I used green onions instead, and it gave it a touch of color and extra flavor.

I like this recipe quite a bit. I used red potatoes, and I would give it 2 forks using them. I think it would be 3 forks with the assorted fingerling. I also think adding hard boiled egg and chives would make it great. I added the anchovy to the dressing, as another reviewer suggested, making the dressing a true Caesar and all the more delicious. Fresh and easy.

This is a perfect salad for spring. The colors are beautiful. You can also play with the recipe. For example, you can use blue cheese instead of parmesan or you can smash a couple of anchovies in the dressing to make it a "real" Caesar. I have also added grilled chicken to make it a lunch entree. yum!

Awesome and easy! I used white, red and purple fingerlings for a colorful display. Also subbed frozen sugar snaps for fresh. People raved. Will definietly make this again.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ. I got all the veggies from a local farm and was so excited about making this salad as I wanted to do something different than a mayo-based potato salad. I must say I really didn't like this at all. The veggies became really soggy in the dressing, and the sugar snap peas became an unappealing grayish/green color. The flavors really didn't mesh well for me and leftovers didn't keep well at all.

I'll use the salad ingredients and dress it with my usual caesar dressing. It's a really good idea in theory, but I agree with previous reviewers that it bears little similarity to a caesar dressing.

This recipe is a great side dish. I've made it a couple times and it's always tasty. The only thing I change is I don't use onions because I happen to dislike them. The dressing is really delicious. A great alternative to traditional potato salad that's made with mayonnaise.

This is a great potluck salad. I added more peas and potatoes and it turned out great. It can give you pretty strong onion breath though.

Just tasted 'leftovers' from last night, and plan to serve for lunch. Paired with panko/lemon topped tilapia for dinner. Used fresh shredded parmesan cheese, added s/p to both dressing and salad while prepping. Nice change from mayo dressings for potato salad!

This was great and the recipe was perfectly written in terms of instructions and time. Did not change a thing. I thought it was good the next day as well. And agree the snap peas and radishes make it beautiful.

This was very good, and offers lots of options. I added feta cheese; one could add other cheeses or salmon. Based on another reviewer's concern about the red onion, I used green onions. But the snap peas and radishes really made this special.

A really tasty option in the world of potato salad recipes!

Very tasty -- I doubled the sugar snaps peas and added a can of chick peas as well, adjusting the dressing amount slightly to cover the added ingredients. My lunch for the week!

I agree with "a cook" - editing needed here as far as reviewers! This was a delicious change from mayo potato salad. The vinegrette was a nice tangy foil to our grilled crispy chicken thighs. And, you got us to try radishes.....we didn't like them as kids, but they added nice & crunch in here....we will use them more. I have to add that my hubby loved this, & he's not big on unique eats.

The recipe needs work. Steam the peas and then plunge into ice cold water (keeps them from going grey). Add anchovies or Worcestershire sauce to make more like a Caesar dressing. I tried this and thought it tasted great.

Easy to make and delicious, this fresh salad is a perfect, tangy side dish for any occasion.

If the veggies are top notch and not steamed to oblivion, and you add some classic Caesar dressing components, this could work. As it is, it doesn't. The next day the salad was dry and tastesless. Great ingredients and flavor combos...but will take some tweaking to get right.

To dipis: Actually the dressing leaves out both anchovies and raw eggs, two CRITICAL ingredients of a caesar dressing. This is just a vinaigrette (not a very good one at that) with parmesan added.

This was delicious, interesting and pretty the day we made it, however, its pretty tasteless the next day. So go for it but don't make enough for let overs.

The greying-pea-pod thing I read in reviews helped me decide to leave them out until last minute, and add more to potatoes on the next day eating.

I added Worchestershire to the dressing to give it a bit of anchovy taste that I thought was missing from the Caesar dressing. It really pulled the salad together for me. Next time I will use actual anchovies as I do when I make Caesar salad, I just didn't have any on hand when I made this.

Awesome recipe! All the produce we used was fresh from the farmers market and dish was wonderful. I probably have enough potatoes left to make another batch this weekend. Even good for dinner two days later!

I would assume the reason they call this Caesar potato salad is the dressing ingrediants nearly match that of a Caesar salad sans the anchovies. Although adding anchovies would likely add to the flavor. I thought it was pretty good, we did not have any leftovers.

Somebody please tell me how this in any way resembles a caesar salad.

I made this to go with the Darn Good Short Ribs recipe and the Poker Guys all thought it a great combo. A One Two punch as it were. great looking on the table as well

We thought this recipe was great. Put some of the dressing on when potatoes were still warm and added the rest just before serving. Would make this the same day as serving, the pea pods lost some color overnight but still tasted good.

There didn't seem to be enough dressing so I doubled that part of the recipe. Everyone enjoyed it.

This dish was ok, definitely a nice fresh salad that is probably a departure from the norm. Personally while I love dijon (used whole grain) mixed with lemon and olive oil, for some reason this didn't really work with me. Maybe the red onions were a little out of place?

The salad looked pretty but was a disappointment. The flavors neither gelled together nor complemented one another. The dish was edible and not entirely bad, but I won't be making it again.

This potato salad was great. The radishes gave it such a crunch, and was a very refreshing alternative to a mayo based salad. My only beef was that after the second day the snap peas turned a greyish green colour that did not look very appealing. It tasted great, but if you will be making this for company, I suggest either making it a few hours before and up to a maximum of a day before, to have the best results.
