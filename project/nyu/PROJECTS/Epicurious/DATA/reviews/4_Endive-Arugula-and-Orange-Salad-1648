Really loved this elegant, simple salad, which I made with raddichio instead of endive. I agree that the walnut oil makes the dressing special. It's the second night in a row I've made it and will likely go for a third with the leftovers tomorrow evening.

I made this exactly as written and everyone at the dinner party loved it. Use the walnut oil if you can find it - it makes a huge difference. Also, use fresh orange juice - it is slightly sweeter and really enhances the flavor of the dressing. Will make this again and again.

This salad was delicious! I altered the flavor for the dinner I was surving! It had an oriental flair so I used toasted sesame oil and olive oil- rice vinager and pineapple juice. It was a tasty alternative!!!

A variation to a Belgian endive salad is to chop the leaves in 1/2 inch pieces and toss with raspberry vinaigrette dressing
