We love this recipe and have made it a quite a few times. It has become our standard Easter dessert. You do need to start the day before and I have always assembled it right before serving to keep the bananas from turning brown. It is gorgeous, perfect for spring.

This recipe is too much trouble and does not taste as good as my old tried and true. My husband did not care for it.

The finished product LOOKED beautiful, but there really wasn't too much flavor. Also, it says you can slice bananas for the top and cover loosely up to 1 day ahead, but I found that despite the apple jelly glaze, the bananas turned very brown overnight. I would perhaps make this again, but use my own tried and true banana creme filling (which is much tastier) and slice bananas right before serving.
