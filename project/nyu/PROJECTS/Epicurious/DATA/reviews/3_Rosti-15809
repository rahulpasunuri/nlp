Hi all - I haven't made this particular rosti recipe, but I thought I'd offer a few hints that I have learned in modernizing my Swiss-grandma's recipe... First, the potatoes are IMPORTANT - don't use just any old wrinkly ones - choose firm, fresh potatoes that keep their texture when cooked (mushiness is rosti's enemy!) A mixture of potatoes with yam or sweet potato is also very tasty, and adds nutrients. Second, I suggest coarsely grating the potato and then blanching it in boiling water until JUST starting to get tender (this only takes a minute - test often). Drain, chill in a cold water bath or under cold running water, and then dry thoroughly on towels. This allows the rosti to cook faster and more evenly. Next, place grated potato in a large bowl, and add any seasonings you desire (a generous dash of salt/alternative is a must; pepper, fresh chives, and paprika are nice, too.) This is where you can get creative: add in shredded leeks or onions for flavour-magic, or any variations you can think of (just keep the size the same for all your ingredients to ensure even cooking). I also add shredded cheese (about 3:1 potatoes to cheese) at this point instead of on top - it gets crispy and golden, and also works as a great binder. Any good melting cheese that isn't too oily will work fine, although an Emmental or Gruyere is classic. Remember - if your mix tastes good at this point it will only get better with cooking; if it's bland, start seasoning! And resist the temptation to flip - rosti's work best if you allow the bottom to really crisp before turning. Bon Appetit!

I was pressed for time, and so didn't cook the rosti to the golden, consistent crust I would have loved, but it was delicious anyway. Dinner is over, I'm full to bursting, and I still can't keep from picking little crispy bits from the pan.

I add an egg to help hold it together. Don't make it too thick, or the outside will be crispy before the center is done. Like the Swiss, I use plenty of butter. A great dish.

I am marrying into a Swiss family and first had this after my fiance's father made it. Then I ate it every night when we were in Switzerland. The trick to getting it to taste right is a lot more butter than this recipe calls for (Depending on how big of a pan I make, I may use 1/2 cup) and also adding a Swiss spice called Aromat. I have found it in a few stores in the states, but we rely on packages from Switzerland for the good stuff. You would be amazed at how it enhances the taste. The previous reviewer's have been correct that often times onions and leeks are added, that is a personal choice if you like. As for it getting mushy in the middle, the trick is not to boil the potatoes too long. You want to cook them slightly, but them to still be firm. My fiance says that mine is as good as he remembers in Switzerland, but I guess he has too...

Very simple, great for a cold evening , add a fried egg on top, serve with a rich deep red wine.

I lived in Switzerland many years ago, and was taught to make this dish by some locals. They added onions and cooked crumbled bacon to the recipe. Its delicious that way. Also, a tip on cooking -- after cooking the first side, place a slightly larger pan on top. Now when you flip it over it will stay together perfectly. Continue cooking second side in larger pan.

Like the reviewer from Texas, I, too, have just returned from Switzerland where I had Rosti in Interlaken. It could be ordered with various combinations of ingredients in addition to potatoes. I had onions, mushrooms, for sure, and I can't recall what, if anything, else. The potatoes and other ingredients were topped with melted cheese which I couldn't identify, Gruyere perhaps, but it melted better, it seemed to me, than Gruyere I've tried. I'm particularly interested in knowing what cheese they use as it made the dish so tasty. I've tried the Switzerland web site without success. I was told there's no standard recipe for Rosti, but my traveling group loved what we had. Oh, how I'd love to be able to duplicate it but would be happy to at least know what cheese is "commonly" or most frequently used.

I added some wild rice and leaks before frying, tastes great!

My question/problem is outside was crusty, inside mushy. Is this typical?Perhaps, don't boil potatoes first

Delicious for brunch topped with creme fraiche (or sour cream or yogurt) and smoked salmon.

I was looking for the same dish I tried over in Switzerland it was close but not quit the same. But it was still good, I sauted a few onions and added it to the shredded potatoes. I will make it again but keep looking for th real thing.
