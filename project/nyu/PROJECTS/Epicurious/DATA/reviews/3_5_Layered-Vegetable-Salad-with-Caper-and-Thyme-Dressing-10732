Changes:Serves 8 to 12. I head of cabbage, less red onion, 2 large yellow peppers enough, less than 1 16 oz. bag of petite peas, add sugar to taste to yogurt and mayonnaise (less than a tablespoon.) Maybe some crunchy wantons thrown in last minute. Also would be a great salad base for a piece of grilled salmon for a light summer meal.

Christmas gathering with the neighbors and I brought this salad--added thinly sliced roma tomatoes for the red color. This was a huge hit (everyone wnted the recipe) and it will definitely stay in my recipe collection!

This salad was delicious. The onions must be sliced extremely thinly, or they overpower the dish. This is a good make ahead dish and the vegetables can be substituted per your taste.

Very nice combination of ingredients; I omitted peppers and reduced onions and increased capers and thyme to suit my taste.
