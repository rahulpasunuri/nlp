I used fresh crab that I purchased at Costco in a 44o gram container and doubled the recipe. I used fresh Texas Toast bread crumbs that I made in the processor. The cakes were extremely crabby and not at all bready. Moist and delicious. I did reduce the amount of Old Bay, howeverI also did not add any salt and pepper.

I didnt' the reviews before making, and now am I ever surprised. We loved them! I used very fresh bread crumbs, added more crab than called for and everyone loved them.

These should be called Crap Cakes because they are awful. I even followed the Reviewer suggestions and used less breadcrumbs and more crab (14 oz.) They still came out way too bready and not tasty at all. Very disappointing.

I was so excited to make the recipe but so disappointed with the results!!. Too too many bvread crumbs and not enough meat. They were like hockey pucks!

These were delicious but I altered the recipe slightly - I used more crabmeat (12 oz) and fat free mayo instead of full fat. We loved them!

So many times I have ordered crab cakes in a restuarant and have been dissappointed. In this recipe you can actually enjoy the flavor of the crab! My dad even liked it and he is the pickiest eater ever.

Old Bay Seasoning is a MUST when making crab cakes especially if you are from Maryland, it's a Maryland Staple and hopefully you can get it on the internet or in your grocery store. Otherwise try the recipe for Crabcakes with Delmarva Spice on this site, that is close but not as good. And to make crab cakes with immitation meat is not heard of in MD. You should really try the real thing!

These were wonderful crab cakes! I made mine with imitation crab, and they had great flavor! They were easy, and I would make them again.

We all loved it. I used a little less bread crumbs and added some Gorgonzola cheese to hold it together and give it some zip! Try it.

Very dry and did not stay together. Too little crab and too many bread crumbs.

This recipe had a very good flavor. I made it for company, and everyone scarfed it up, but the cakes were dry and did not hold together. If I make it again, I will reduce the bread crumbs, and add another egg. Probably half the bread crumbs would be plenty.

Too much bread, not enough crab.
