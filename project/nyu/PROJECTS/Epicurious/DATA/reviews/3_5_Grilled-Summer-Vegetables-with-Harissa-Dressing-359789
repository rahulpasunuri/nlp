Outstanding! I now can eat squash. It has taken many, many years to get past the squash casserole my grandmother used to make with the summer bounty, which was frozen and forced on the family through the winter. Had to say it. Anyway, I love harissa, used the past and thinned with the olive oil and lemon. Grilling the veggies gives the flavor some depth. If you like spicy, go heavy on the harissa.

I made with farmers' market eggplant, zucchini, half a white onion, four small bell peppers and store-bought harissa powder ("Seasoned Pioneers" brand), which I prepared mostly according to the directions on the pouch (mixed 2-4 tsp. with 2 crushed cloves of garlic and 2 T EVOO). Mixed with 2.5 T lemon juice, I found this to be plenty of dressing (and plenty of oil!) for the veggie mixture. Because I like things spicy, I used 4 tsp of harissa, and it gave the veggies a nice kick. It was a perfect summer meal, served over greens and sprinkled with a bit of feta.

We thought this was very bland. The harissa added a bit of a kick, but the veggies were just boring. We had fresh picked (from our organic garden) veggies and the the buttermilk routine. But it was just ordinary. We did half the veggies with and half without the buttermilk. The only difference was the ones with the buttermilk were mushy. No difference in taste. Would not do it again.

I do adore eggplant and the mix of everything was very good!

It's probably quicker to mix up your own harissa then find it in your store. i found the harissa paste but then wasn't sure it would work the same. I think you can cut dressing in half even w/ the full order of veggies.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I already had the powdered harissa so all I had to buy were the fresh vegetables. I prepared the vegetables and placed them on a grill tray and my husband grilled them. Meanwhile I mixed the sauce. I will definitely make it again and again.

Could not find harissa powder to save my life, but I was able to find imported (jarred) Moroccan harissa in the Middle Eastern section of Wegmans. This is a very thick paste/sauce that is *incredibly* hot! I made a "dressing" out of it by simply whisking a few spoonfuls with olive oil and plenty of lemon juice. I drizzled this over the veggies (used same ones in recipe plus some leftover shiitakes)...delicious. Must like spicy like we do! Served this alongside grilled salmon with a balsamic glaze.
