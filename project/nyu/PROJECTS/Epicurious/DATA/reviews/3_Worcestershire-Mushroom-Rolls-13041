While making these, I wondered if they were worth the effort. But they are slightly different and look elegant on a platter amidst other dainty hors d'oeuvres. Tasty enough. So would probably give it 2-1/2 forks and would make them again if I had more time and wanted something unusual. Otherwise I'd stick to my standards that are easy yet tasty.

Delicious! Although it took longer than expected and the chives kept breaking when tying around the roll. Will try the "low fat" version next time.

As an appetizer, this is way below standard (boring and way too salty). However -- the mushroom filling is excellent with the addition of more pepper, a dash of Tabasco, 1/4 c. of good sherry or 1/3 c. of red wine, cooked down. I've used this intensely flavored filling for a savory cheesecake, stews, omelettes....

I remember my mom made a version of this for cocktail parties in the '60s - I've always loved it & used to steal some as she made it for her guests. I reduced the fat & calories by using reduced-calorie bread, a nonstick skillet & replacing almost all of the butter with low-calorie cooking spray. Truly "yummy".

One word - BORING!! This recipe was okay but nothing special. I even doctored it up a bit based on some of the comments. I used half worsterchire & half marsala wine along with lots of fresh time. I also brushed it with roasted garlic olive oil before baking. My guests ate all of them but I've made much tastier appetizers. I'm glad I didn't go to the trouble of doing the chive garnishing.

Although took longer to make than expected, these were definetly worth it! Made two batches & both were gone before other snacks had been touched.

I made this for the first time, to bring to the office party. It was a big hit. We all agreed that I should cut the Worcestershire sauce in half next time. Will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious. The Chive ties were a bit tricky, but worth the effort. They looked as good as they taste. Had some filling leftover and used it in mini phyllo cups.....also delicious.

I have one friend who begs me to make this for every party I have. These are easy to make and I've never had leftovers even though I've tripled+ the recipe for larger parties.

These tasted just like the name, a little boring.

I've made these several times and guests literally vaccuum them off the plate. They can be made ahead, too.
