This is a nice dish to start off autumn. I had gorgonzola so I used that in lieu of feta and I have no complaints. I also used white wine vinegar b/c I didn't have sherry. I also like it with big carrots cut up rustic style.

Excellent dish, and very pretty! I made this as a side dish to take to dinner with friends, and everyone loved it, even non-beet lovers. I used large beets cut into cubes and full-sized carrots cut into ~2in. sticks. I served it cold/room temperature. I was a little unprepared for the amount of time it took to go through all of the steps of the recipe- it seemed like such a simple salad, but all of a sudden I had been in the kitchen for over an hour-- but it was totally worth it.

Perfect side salad for a girl's afternoon tea/ wine party. Light enough for an appetizer but heavy enough if you wanted to make a vegetarian meal out of it.

I slow roasted large beets (both red and golden) instead of par-boiling them. I did par boil the carrots, and then roasted as directed. The dressing was really good...loved the cumin flavor. Will definitely make it again.

I enjoyed the flavors but will make some changes next time. I'm not used to this technique of boiling and roasting and I overcooked the vegetables. I would only par boil the vegetables next time, and would roast them at 475; it took over 30 minutes at 450 to begin to carmelize and the vegetables became very soft. The dressing was very good and the flavors developed quite nicely overnight.

Approaching snow paired with carrots and beets in the garden caused us to try this one. I was not certain that we would like it, but we loved it "as is" and appreciate the subscriber who asked for the recipe. We're having it again tonight.
