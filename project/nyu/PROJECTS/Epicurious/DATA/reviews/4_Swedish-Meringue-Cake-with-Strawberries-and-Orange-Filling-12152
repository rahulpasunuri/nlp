My friends told me that this is the best desert that I have ever made. I had to agree. I followed the recommendation for for 2 tbs. of corn starch and I made the cake the day before. That worked very well for my dinner party.

For moiragb, I have the photo of this cake from the magazine, do you still want it? I found this recipe in my mothers collection (after she passed). I haven't made it yet, but will do so on her birthday this year, in memory of her, to share with family members.

This is so good! We made only some minor adjustments: slightly less than 2T of cornstarch in the orange filling; we let the cakes cool in the pan and didn't flip them on to racks, as I thought the meringue might break and crack too much. We left the whipped cream on the side, and didn't put the strawberries on top, so it wasn't as pretty as it could be, but the taste is wonderful.

I've made this twice in the last month, once for a birthday party, and second for a Smorgasbord themed pot luck. The first time it was so well liked I never got to taste it. The second time I only got a bite. Any cake that is this well recieved deserved to be made again and again. Some day I may get a whole piece. I substituted superfine sugar for the granulated. I believe it Makes the merange stiffer faster and keeps the yolks lighter.

A perfect summer dessert. Takes a little time, but is worth it in the end.

I made this when it first came out in the magazine. I just made it again tonight and it was as exceptional as before and still gets rave reviews from family and friends who enjoyed eating it. I wish they had the photo from the magazine, I took several of my finished cake and would love to upload it for a good visual.

I hate to be the stick in the mud here..but this cake was not what I expected after all the rave reviews it got. I baked the cakes and found the merengue rose and then fell...the cakes turned out to be 2 inches tall. I figured..a flop so I make the entire recipe again and they turned out about the same. I did the curd as the recipe said and it turned out fine. Be sure to stir it before putting it on the cake, it thins it out a bit. Overall alot of work for a strawberry shortcake like dessert.

This is a beautiful and tasty cake. It is definitely worth the effort. I took it to a Memorial Day picnic and everyone loved it! In response to adusting the cornstarch, I followed the recipe as written, Using 3 tablespoons makes the filling very thick and that helps keep the layers from sliding and makes the cake more stable.

I had misplaced this recipe for years. Now that I finally was able to retrieve it on-line, I'll never lose it again. You will consider this recipe a blessing to serve to your family & friends. It will be a surprise to my whole family when I make it for my birthday dinner. It is so delicious that I don't mind the extra labor it takes to make this cake. It is light and not too heavy. It is not too sweet. If you have to transport it somewhere, I'd suggest doing the piping of the whipped cream @ your desired location and then placing in the refrigerator to set it. Add to your recipe box and e-mail to a friend, so you never lose it. This one is a definite winner!!

I make this cake every year for my husband's and my sister's birthday. Everyone loves this cake. It's delicious and it's beautiful. Prepare the cake and filling ahead of time as suggested as this makes it much easier to put the cake together.

It was great! I made it for my husband's birthday and it came out beautiful. Everyone loved it. I used 2Tbls. of cornstarch for the orange curd and I think it was just right.

This cake was a wonderful suprise. With few reviews, and an unusual assemblage of ingredients, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very impressed with the turnout, and everyone who tasted it gave rave reviews. The orange filling, while DELICIOUS, is a bit problematic: I used 3 tsp. cornstarch like the previous reviewer suggested, but it turned out just SLIGHTLY runny. I will be making this again, but next time I will try using 4 tsp. EXCELLENT FLAVOR, though and great for spring/summer!

I just reread the recipe, and think I know what the other reviewer found not quite right with the cake. Instead of adding 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch, make that 3 TEASPOONS! That way, you'll get Orange Filling instead of "Flubber!"

I made this recipe when it first came out in 1991. I thought things were a little odd. Now with almost 8 years more experience, I am attempting it again. I will let you know what I found out.
