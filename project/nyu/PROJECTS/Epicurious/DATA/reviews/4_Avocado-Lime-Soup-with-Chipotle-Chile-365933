Very tasty--and so darn easy. Love the chipotle chile in adobo sauce--brings a nice, subtle heat. Next time, I'd like to try a nice white vinegar rather than the lime juice to make the soup slightly more complex in flavors (and also to avoid making the soup taste too similar to guacamole). Definitely try to finish the soup on the same day that you make it--it's best then.

GREAT recipe, easy to modify. I made to recipe, except: no water, made as a dip (still eats like a soup!) 3 small avos, 3rd one diced, not pureed, to add some chunks. lowfat yogurt. 3 cloves garlic. It's a bit tangy due to the yogurt, would be challenging to me to eat a whole bowl as a soup. Works great as dip for chips, or on a burrito or taco in place of guacamole or sour cream. Personally, I could use more on the spices, but would happily serve at home or take this with chips to a party as is (minus the water...).

Delicious, but I found the recipe directions difficult to decipher. So I used my judgment about some things. It turned out great.

This was so delicious. I disagree with the review that said it wasn't a soup - the whole point of adding the water is to make its consistency soupy. We loved it as-is and skipped the chips, just eating it as a soup accompanying fajitas.

I really liked this soup. I did add the ice water to make it more soupy and garnished with lime tortilla chips and salsa. I passed the recipe on and others have enjoyed it too. It was a bit too hot because I added extra peppers, so I am anxious to follow the recipe to the letter and try it.

I LOVED this dish, especially considering how easy it was to make. Because it's raw and utilizes minimal ingredients, I'd say it took 10 minutes from start to finish. I took the advice of the previous reviewer and opted out of adding the ice water. I also garnished with a few drops of Sriracha to give it some heat.

Calling this soup is a stretch. It is like eating thin guacamole with a spoon. Yummy, but next time I will leave out the yogurt and water and eat it with chips instead.
