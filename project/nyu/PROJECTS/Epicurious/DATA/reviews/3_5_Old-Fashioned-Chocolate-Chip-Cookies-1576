A great basic recipe. Reduce the flour to 2.5 cups, double the vanilla and make sure to cream the butter and sugars well. And just my opinion on all the comments of the cookie being bland,... isn't the whole point of a chocolate chip cookie to taste the excellent quality of chocolate chip used? I agree that the cookie itself should be tasty, but I'd rather highlight the chips.

ick...don't know how its possible to make a bad cookie but this is it! salty, too buttery. i like cakey cookies and thought this would be it. if anyone has any ideas for that, please share!

I found them rather bland and dry. I should have known when the dough didn't stick together. I did add a tsp. of cinnamon and used 2 tsp. of vanilla, but I don't feel it gave it much flavor. I should have read the reviews fully and cut back to 2.5 cups of flour... That might of helped. I'll probably be going back to my traditional recipe however.

This is my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. As other reviewers have said, increasing the vanilla to 2tsp and making sure that the sugars and fats really are light and fluffy makes a huge difference. Don't skip the dough-chilling step, it's important too! I also make a variation: replace the chocolate chips with 1c roughly-chopped dried cherries and 3/4c white chocolate chips. Both versions are well-loved by my friends and family.

I used only brown sugar 1.5 cups. Only butter (2 sticks). Changed to 2.5 cups of flour however I am going to try 2.75. I felt it needed something for more taste. Maybe that cinamon would do the trick.

This is the chocolate chip cookie recipe I have been searching for! I have tried many chocolate chip cookie recipes and this is the one I will use going forward! I too reduced my flour to 2.5 cups. The cookies hold their shape and have a wonderful texture. Primo!

Not much of a cookie maker, the holidays. Agree with the baker frm Norther NJ, cut back on the flour to 2.5 cups. Took a little longer to bake(12-14 mins) but came out soft and chewey. Good flavor, added cinammon, a keeper

The key is the shortening...these cookies stay crunchy and slightly chewy when stored in an airtight container. Better yet: chop up Heath or Skor bars instead of or in addition to the choc chips. Yum!

The perfect chocolate chip cookie. I made it with all butter. Produces slightly crunchy, slightly chewy cookies. I might add pecans next time, but it is a classic.

I have been making cc cookies for 30 years and these are far and away the most perfect recreation of classic cookies I have ever made! I followed others suggestions and used 2 t vanilla, cut the flour back to 2.5 cups and added 1/8 t cinnamon. I creamed the butter and sugars on high for at least 5 mins, and refrigerated the dough for 30 mins before scooping. Made 40 absolutely perfect cookies! Oh, I also added a cup of coarsely chopped toasted pecans. This is now my favorite go-to recipe for cc cookies. And it's easy, too!

Rating: 3
I read the reviews first, so I made sure to use the electric mixer on the butter/shortening/sugar - I think it made a difference! The cookies seem very light. I'd like to try them with only butter sometime, though. I was unable to find my brown sugar at the time, so I used 1/2 cup of white sugar where it said, and then a 1/2 cup of white sugar for the brown, with an overflowing Tbsp of golden syrup and a dash of dark Karo. They still came out great!

Rating: 3
After reading the other reviewers suggestions, I made sure I really fluffed the butter, sugars and shortening, I also added a dash of cinnamon, and I think it was a good call. These cookies were great! The key is not to overcook them. I took some out at 10 min and they were nice and chewy, just the way I like them even though they were really "floppy" before they cooled. The ones I left in were still tasty, but they ended up crunchy, which my mom likes.... so it all worked out.

Try replacing the shortening with coconut oil for a delicious treat! Coconut oil has nearly the same consistency as shortening at room temperature making it the perfect substitute for shortening.

I love these cookies! I have been searching for a soft cookie recipe that did not include melted butter (hate the way those turn out) and was very pleased with this cookie. I followed the recipe exactly except I used mini chocolate chips and only used about 10oz. I also used dark brown sugar. I agree that the key is to really mix the butter, crisco and sugars until light and fluffy- until they turn a shade or two lighter. The dough was very light and fluffy even after adding 3 Cs of flour. I also made sure my eggs were room temperature. I used a tablespoon sized ice cream/dough scooper and got 3 dozen perfectly formed cookies. They spread just enough but were not flat. They are also very good when completely cooled, whereas most cookies I only like when warm. They had a nice crunch exterior with a soft and cakey inside.

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe and added some walnuts- I do not believe a true chocolate chip cookie can be made without them. This recipe made a light, moist, cakey type cookie that was slightly crisp around the edges and a bit sticky in the center. It's a fine recipe by all means, but the dough seemed to be lacking something- some sort of depth of flavour. I'm not a fan of shortening in my cookies; yes they brown evenly and look great, but I find them to be too greasy for my liking. I'm happy I tried this recipe, but I doubt I would make it again. I'll keep on my quest for the "ultimate" choclate chip cookie.

Rating: 0
These were not too bad, I liked that they were not flat to the pan but like others said there was too much flour, even though I cut back to 2 1/2 cups and added extra vanilla, but yeah they still needed more vanilla and less flour.

I made these cookies with butter only and using half whole wheat flour. I made them very large - about the size of cookies you get at a coffee house. They were very professional in texture and presentation -- a little bland for my taste but the men in my life said they were the best ever. So I guess they are a staple in our household!

I've found it! I've been looking for a cookie recipe like this for a long, long time. I guess when reviewers call them 'cakey' that must have been exactly what I was looking for! I subb'ed 1 1/2 c. m&m's instead of the chocolate chips and my family was in HEAVEN! So was my husband, who had three cookies after dinner!

my family loves these just as is. they hold their shape nicely. they ship well too, and are really appreciated during finals week.

These cookies definitely have a different consistency - much more "cakey" than other recipes. However, my husband loves a soft cookie and he loved these. The dough is a little hard to handle since there is so much flour (even hard to get the chocolate chips to stick!). Next time I might try reducing the amount of flour. I followed others' advice and used an extra teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamin. Delicious! Note: I was not convinced the cookies were done after 12 minutes, but based on other reviewers' advice, I removed from oven anyway -- glad I did -- don't overcook!

Rating: 2
I like my cookies on the moist side with lots of chips. I reduced the flour to 2.5 cups. I added an additional tsp of vanilla. I used all brown sugar. I used half shortening and half butter. I also upped the chocolate chips to approximately 14 oz. The cookies still came out cakey. Many people liked the cookie. Next time, I will make some changes to that hopefully result in a still moister cookie. I would reduce the flour to 2.25 cups. I would also go back to all butter. I believe those two things will help make the cookie a flatter cookie, moister (especially when slightly undercooked), with lots of gooey chocolate chips. I may also try part granulated and part brown sugar. I looked forward to the next experiment!

Rating: 4
I cannot believe anyone would call these cookies tasteless and terrible, but, I guess there's no accounting for taste. I have used this recipe for years and get comments like I should go into business to sell them. I do add a bag of Heath chocolate toffee bits, and use 1/2-3/4 bag of white chocolate chips and 1/2-3/4 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips - both of which are Ghiradelli. Fabulous cookies. I get requests all the time for either the recipe and/or for me to make them.

This is a great alternative to the predominantly butter-based cookie and my most-used chocolate chip cookie recipe. I don't alter the recipe at all, and they turn out terrific each time. Very little spreading, slightly chewy consistency, and no complaints about flavor. I do cover and chill the batter before baking to keep the cookies compact, and slightly underbake so that they stay moist even after firming up.

I read the previous reviews and made some modifications that worked out well. 1. the eggs should also be at room temperature. 2. Add two teaspoons of vanilla extract instead of one, along with 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon. 3. Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees,if using a dark heavy cookie sheet. 4. Beating the shortening, butter and sugars until very light and fluffy is an excellent suggestion and should be followed. 5. Refridgerate the dough for 20-30 minutes. 6. After placing the balls of dough on the cookie sheet I pressed them with the bottom of a flat glass dipped in granulated sugar so they wouldn't stick to the glass. The combination of shortening and butter prevents the cookies from spreading. Great tasting cookies.

I was looking for a chewy cookie recipe, and this fit the bill. I followed others' suggestions: used only 2.5 cups of flour, 2 tsp vanilla, and cinnamon. However, the cookies still lacked a little "oomph". The texture was good, but next time I would add more vanilla, I think.

Rating: 1
On the plus side---the cookies were easy to handle and they did not spread out too thin when baked. The downside---they were a bit too cakey for me. I added chopped pecans and heath bar chips and that didn't even fill in the cakey interior enough. You definitely need to add a spice to kick it up a notch. I added fresh grated nutmeg. I think that if you used all butter and 2-1/2 cups flour, it would be a greatly improved recipe. But I'm not making it again.

I've been making Mrs. Fields cookies for years, but this time I wanted to take my chocolate chip cookies to the next level. I lucked out with this recipe! I took the advice of some other raters and used all brown sugar, creamed with the butter and shortening for 5 minutes, added a dash of cinnamon and doubled the vanilla, and added chopped pecans (didn't have walnuts handy). They are excellent! I have been sneaking cookies ever since I finished baking them, and I even had a couple for breakfast. This is my new regular recipe for chocolate chip cookies. They are just so much more cakey and moist!

I would like to add to my previous review...for the "bland" flavor that other reviewers were speaking of, add another teaspoon of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and use all brown sugar. Really make that sugar, butter, and shortening mix fluffy, it helps with the texture a great deal verses just doing a quick mix with the mixer. I mixed mine on high for 5 minutes. My husband, a VERY picky eater, absolutely LOVED the cookies! Yippie!!!

The cookies were dry and cakey and they tasted good, but not great. They reminded me more of cookie bars rather than good chewy chocolate chip cookies. INstead of making more individual cookies I made one big cookie, spread vanilla ice cream on top and froze. Then I drizzeled the top with homemade caramel sauce and froze it again.

I was looking for a soft, chewy, bakery-style chocolate chip cookie recipe that didn't go splat when cooked. I got it...sort of. They're soft and chewy, not splat, but as others have said, they're a bit bland. I added walnuts and used mostly brown sugar, but I suspect in sacrificing buttery splatness, I sacrificed taste. I probably won't make these again.

I followed this recipe exactly - and I think that was part of the problem. It really does need to be tinkered with. I liked the consistency of the cookies (I wound up with rather flat cookies, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle), but they are a bit cakey. The biggest problem I have is taste. They are very bland but I believe the taste could be improved with better ingredients. Here are my suggestions. Use high quality margarine and no white sugar at all. Refrigerate the dough for about 20 minutes before forming the cookies, and don't make the balls too big. Mine flattened out TOO much because the dough was room temperature when I put it into the oven. Of course one could argue that any recipe that needs so much tinkering is not worth trying to make again at all......

The flavor of these cookies were fine, nobody could argue that. But, mine did not turn out to be cakey.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found. I have tried many over the past 5 years(between 15 and 20) and this is one is fabulous.

These cookies are excellent. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I hate thin, flat chocolate chip cookies. These were perfectly puffy and shaped when they came out of the oven. They did sink slightly on cooling but they did not collapse. ALL INGREDIENTS WERE ROOM TEMPERATURE. I think this makes a difference. Also I really take it to heart when a recipe says mix until light and fluffy. I used a whisk attachment to whip the sugars, butter and butter flavored Crisco. I then switched to a mixing paddle (so as not to make the cookies tough by over mixing the flour mixture). Lastly I baked them in a 350* oven, middle rack exactly 12 minutes. PERFECTLY COOKED Just slightly brown. I should also note I make my cookies hearty I got about 27 cookies. I can't imagine people making small (60+) cookies and baking them for 12 minutes and not have them overcooked. Just my thoughts - hope they help.

These cookies were great, but not fabulous. The texture in the middle of the cookies was a bit undercooked (I had followed another cook's idea of taking them out of the oven even if they do not look finished). If you cut out the undercooked middle (like a doughnut) the edges were great!

On a scale from 1 to 10 we rated them with a big fat 9; they turned out pretty, pleasant and quick to make, 1 hour 45 min for the whole process, very easy to make; Got 63 cookies.

I thought this recipe had a perfect balance of shortening/butter to the amount of flour.

Excellent choco chip cookie recipe - I added walnuts and a bit of cinnamon and they were delicious. To those who had problems with the recipe - if you flatten out the rounded spoonfuls on your cookie sheet, they won't come out like blobs, and be sure to take them out of the oven after 12 minutes (even if they don't look done) or else they will definitely be dry and overcooked!
