The taste is wonderful. I accidentally added an extra 1/4 cup of cream and it was very runny. However, I quickly transferred it to my stand mixer and whipped it to peaks and it is soooo fluffy and amazing. Serendipity I guess.

I was asked to find a use for mascarpone, and tried this recipe. I had no problems with consistency. I let the chocolate cool over about a half hour, and whisked it into the cheese rather than folding it. Served it with berries and cinnamon cookies.

Took this to a BBQ with stawberries and pineapple and it disappeared instantly. When I first made it, it seemed quite runny but I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving and it thickened up nicely.

I noticed there were several reviews that said they had trouble with getting it the right consistency. Here's what I did and it wasn't runny at all! I took the mascarpone, entire cup of heavy whipping cream, vanilla extract and whisked it together with my mixer, using the whisk attachment. Then I took the 6 oz of white chocolate, about another 1/4 cup of whipped cream, melted that together and added it to the other mixture. Again, using my whisk attachment with my mixer, it came out perfect! And OMG is it yummy!

This is one of my favorite recipes for a summer desert. I made it with dark chocolate and it was equally good. I do make it ahead and chill it to get it thick enough.

OMG this was amazing! I made this for a kids' party and it was tough to not lick the bowl. I will definitally be making this again. I would love to sit in fromt of the television and eat this with whatever fruit I happened to have in the fridge.

The consistency issue (runny, lumps, etc.) can be remedied by using a hand mixer. I whipped up the marscapone and cream, but the mixture turned *both* runny and lumpy when the chocolate was added. A few rounds with the electric mixer and the dip had a very nice consistency.

This is delicious as a filling for phyllo shells, with fresh fruit on top. It's the perfect dessert for a dinner party b/c you make the filling the day before, and then just assemble before serving.

so delicious! The trick here is to whip the marscapone with the heavy cream until thick - the consistency of whipped cream. Then fold in the melted chocolate, using a large whisk if necessary to get rid of lumps...and quality definitely matters! There are many terribly tasting white chocolates out there. My favorite is Green and Blacks. I also added a few drops of lime oil - although lime zest would work as another reviewer pointed out. The only problem is - will it last until the party when all I want to do is wolf it all down right now!

Like other reviewers, I've had problems with the consistency. The first time I made it, it was too runny and I had to refrigerate overnight. The next time I made it, it was lumpy. Regardless, it is delicious. Definitely make ahead of time because of the likelihood of problems.

Absolutely perfect for dipping fruit or cookies. I had to refrigerate mine overnight before it was the right consistency. Will make again, but do it in advance of serving. Had no problem with blending the two components.

Nice dessert dip. But, I don't understand where I went wrong... "fold in chocolate"? My cream/ marscapone/ vanilla mixture was too soupy. Maybe next time I'll try whipping the cream before adding the cheese. Over all, though... good recipe if you have at least 2-3 hours to allow to chill & set up.

This recipe was excellent with a few tweaks. Actually served as a dessert rather dip in fancy glasses. Added framboise to the marscarpone mix and layered with fresh plump raspberries and topped with a drizzle of melted chocolate. What a hit and light for a very rich dessert. Wonderful and was put into my recipe box!

This was awesome, I made it for my boyfriend and I the last time we were together and it was a huge hit with him and his mom, I will be making this again as soon as I can. Kiwis are also a great fruit to use with this dip I found out too

Tasted great, but not many people ate it. Without knowing it's white chocolate, it wasn't a hit. I ended up eating way too much.

Cook from London how can you give this a neutral review when you replaced a major ingredient with one of much lesser quality? Anyway, on to the recipe; it's excellent. I used Lindt white chocolate with coconut and served it at a party. What little leftovers we had kept very well (not hard at all) and were served the next morning over homemade waffles. Delicious! I'm planning a baby shower in a few weeks and plan on using this dip to fill tartlets and then top them with fresh fruit.

I used cream cheese instead of mascarpone. It makes enough to feed an army. I had to keep it in the fridge so it went hard but we still liked it. It's just TOO MUCH!!!

This was excellent. I made 1 change-omitted the vanilla and substituted 1 teaspoon minced lime zest. I was spooning extra dip onto my plate to eat by itself it was so good.

This dip is outstanding! I have made it twice and it has been devoured each time. Do try to use good white chocolate, as using chips will give it a grainy consistency. I have also used this as a filling between two crisp,homemade chocolate cookies. It was like a foodies' Oreo!

I have to rate this 4 forks because people were going into fits over this dip at a bridal shower I threw. Girls even asked for spoons so they could gobble it up faster. I thought it was just okay, but obviously I am in the minority. On the technical side, it has the perfect dipping texture when chilled, and the flavors of both the mascarpone and the white chocolate come through.

I took this recipe to an Italian-themed party. It was a big hit! Easy to make and extremely tasty. It satisfies the sweet tooth without being too heavy. Many people asked for the recipe.

This was amazing!!!! Other fruit dips are good for highlighting fresh fruit, this one is great for indulging, while feeling a bit less guilty because "hey, we're eating fruit!".

I had great cherries,but my strawberries were a little disappointing.The dip made the berries delicious,elegant and fun.

I was skeptical about making a fruit dip since I really don't think seasonal fruit needs anything to make it better. However...this dip is fantastic.
