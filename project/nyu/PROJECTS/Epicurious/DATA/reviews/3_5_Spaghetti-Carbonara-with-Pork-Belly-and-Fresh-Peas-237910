I'm an old (72) retired chef and I think this Carbonara is probably the best dish I have ever made!!! I would wish those who don't bother to do all the steps involved in this dish please don't critique - you are not being the least bit fair to the recipe. Granted it is a long process, but really very little hands on time. Thanks Bon Appetit for another wonderful recipe!

As what appears to be only the second person who actually followed the recipe, I give the recipe 4 forks. If you don't go through the curing and braising process for the pork belly, you don't get the layer of flavors that you do if you follow it precisely. Oh, and I used frozen peas defrosted and minimally cooked in the microwave. They are just fine in this recipe. I can't say exactly what the pork belly contributes, but my husband and I--both of whom love traditional carbonara--loved the effect of this recipe. FYI, I tried this recipe as one of many because DH unexpectedly bought me 10 pounds of pork belly. One can only cure so much bacon.

We prefer traditional spaghetti carbonara. The pork belly, while tasty, would be better in a Southern american dish.

Curing your own pork belly, unless you're a charcuterie enthusiast, is fussy and unnecessary. However, bacon is a terrible substitution; its overwhelming smoky flavor dominates the dish. Thankfully, most good grocery stores these days carry pancetta, an air-cured Italian pork belly meat that's sweeter and more delicate than bacon. Use that. Finally, a word on authenticity. True Roman spaghetti carbonara does not include peas, nor coriander, nor bay leaves, nor wine, nor onions, nor any of the other fussy, silly, unnecessary additions made by this recipe. Whatever this bizarre recipe is, it's not carbonara. The carbonara I learned to make in Rome is composed of sauteed pancetta, two eggs and three egg yolks, black pepper, and a cup each of pecorino romano and parmigiano cheeses, tossed together. It's perfection. I don't know whether it's chef's ego or simple lack of respect for the cuisine that leads people to throw an armload of produce into this eminently simple dish. Either way, it's completely unnecessary, because I've been told by everyone that's ever had my version that it's the best pasta they've ever had. Also, if you're gonna make carbonara, don't screw around trying to make it "healthy." Carbonara is a treat and an indulgence. If that means you eat it three times a year, so be it....but don't sub in turkey "bacon".

Awesome. If you make the bacon version, it's a go-to staple that you always have the ingredients for. My children love it.

Bonus - found nice box of SHELLED peas at farmer's market and decided to do pasta with peas - found this recipe. Used cubed pancetta and sauteed with some onion - delicious! Keeper! intrigued by the comments of those who did the pork belly - will try that, too.

-The pork belly makes this special. -Peas are pretty, but...doesn't anyone else find eating them to be irritating? Asparagus could be a nice substitution. -skimming off the pork fat everywhere to make it healthier makes no difference in taste as the pork belly is rich enough

I have made this recipe many times and it comes out perfect every time. I make the bacon version and I almost always have the ingredients on hand to make a quick and tasty meal. My kids and my chef husband eat it up. Make this for your family! They will thank you.

I made this per the recipe except as a dinner for two (half the spaghetti, cheese, eggs). Raves all around, including being the best spaghetti dish ever. Leftover peas and pork will go to good use. Pork belly treatment is a bit of work but worth it in my opinion.

Made this with a 6-oz. package of turkey bacon and some whole-wheat angel hair to make it healthier. The juggling of various phases of this recipe proved difficult...It takes a very long time to shell 1.5 lb. of sweet peas!! As a result I was only able to prepare 2/3 of my peas in time to get them into the pasta water. The resulting dish is decadently yummy but I'm not sure it was worth the two hours of work...

I love this recipe. I omitted the pork belly and substituted with diced bacon. It's a staple in our home.

Used lamb bacon rather than pork belly. Great!

Exquisite! I didn't have time to do the whole pork-belly process, and I jused used pancetta. However, this was by far the most delicious pasta I have ever made! It is very heavy though, and is meant to stand on its own. Even just a small serving is very filling, and very delicious!

I did not use the pork belly (I will for sure next time since I love it), but this turned out great with some good quality bacon. Very tasty.

I prepared only the pork belly part of the recipe--it was fabulous! I don't think I'll ever need to buy bacon again!

I used the alternate recipe with diced bacon in place of the pork belly, and it was quite good.

Easy and delicious recipe. I used half a pound each bacon and pancetta and skipped over the pork belly prep.
