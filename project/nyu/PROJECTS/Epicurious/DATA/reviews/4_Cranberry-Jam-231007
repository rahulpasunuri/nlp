I took a cue from another reviewer and added cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and cloves. I also didn't bother to strain out the skins. It was to die for. I made extra and canned it and gave the jars as gifts. Almost everyone asked me for the recipe

I just made this recipe, but it turns out watery, my jam wasnt thick at all. Even after refridgerator overnight. Can someone help me to thicken my jam? Thanks

Excellent just as written and almost as easy as opening a jar or can. The orange juice gives a wonderful brightness that is complementary to the tartness of the cranberries. The sugar was just right to my taste, but I made it to serve with turkey rather than as a sweet spread.

This was an excellent recipe, very easy, great flavor! I halved this recipe and tweaked it: 6 oz. frozen cranberries 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup water 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I mashed the cranberries once they popped with a potato masher and didn't strain the skin/seeds out.

Wonderful recipe. I love the tartness. To make it more "holiday"-like I add cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, ginger and cloves! Yummmmmmmm! Spicy and wonderful smelling! Orange juice is a must have for cran jam!

Very easy to make and quite tasty, though very tart, so you might want to add more sugar. Also, I might use lemon or lime juice instead of orange next time. It is a beautiful color, so would be great for holiday gift-giving.
