I wonder if you could make this as squares instead of a tart?

Simple & delicious, and the crust was very easy to work with. Will make again!

I've made this tart several times and it always receives rave reviews. It's easy to make too.

My friends and family can't get enough of this really easy recipe. I've used every combination of nut and it's always perfect. My mother-in-law asks for this as her Christmas present every year! Excellent holiday treat.

Nice no-fail recipe. I used a combination of almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts and it was delicious. Added some bittersweet choc. chips too, to cut the sweetness of the caramel. This was well received as a sweet dessert with a nice cup of coffee.

Pretty rich; used bittersweet chocolate instead of white to cut the sweetness of the carmel. Also tried with macadamia nuts. Great crust -- would use it for any tart by just omitting the spice.

This recipe was so good several years ago that I searched for it again for this Thanksgiving. The cinnamon ice cream was an added plus!

It's delicious without being too sweet -- I think I can taste the honey in it! I've made this twice in two weeks...both times used a ready-made crust. I can't wait to try it with different nut combos.......

I get rave reviews with this recipe! I use only pecans rather than mixed nuts, and drizzle semisweet Ghirardelli chocolate rather than white chocolate over the top. The recipe is on the sweet side, but not overly so. It's a great recipe for the committed beginner, and a wonderful choice for the holiday season.

A great recipe and a delicious crush. Adding nutmeg to the crust made it perfect. I sure it will well with other nuts. I added hazel nuts to the mixed.
