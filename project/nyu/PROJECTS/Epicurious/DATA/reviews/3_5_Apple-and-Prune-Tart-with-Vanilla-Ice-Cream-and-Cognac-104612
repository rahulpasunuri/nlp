This was extremely good. I did something different with the prunes, which I knew from the start I would do, it is this: Take the marinated prune + the cognac and saute in pan and sort of squish up to make a puree kind of, then distribute around the tart after it is done. You don't waste the nice cognac and it is much nicer. Must have the ice cream with it. And the crust is really good. Of course, if you don't like prunes to start with - forget them all together, but the prunes with the ice cream - YUM! + very "different" and "gourmet" . P.S going to make it tonight for opening ceremonies of Olympics!

A nice dessert. But I did not think the prunes or the cognac added much. Tasted more like a regular apple tart.

This a fabulously easy and impressive dessert to make for friends and family. Especially if, like me, you buy the tart shell ready made!! I found the cooking time to be too long and shortened it to about 40 min. for the first bake. Use good Cognac.

I have made this a few times for my son, a strict vegetarian, and a friend, both of whom loved it. The pastry in the blender is a bit difficult - the consistency of the dough is not wonderful - I am doing it by hand this time. Other than that it's easy, attractive and tasty.

We really enjoyed this. I added some vanilla to the butter brushed on top. The prunes were a nice touch.
