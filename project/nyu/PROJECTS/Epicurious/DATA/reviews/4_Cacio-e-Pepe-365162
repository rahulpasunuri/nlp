Absolutely delicious! I didn't have Pecorino, so I just used Parmesan. The only problem was I followed the recipe exactly and, afterwards, I wished I made more. Even though I wasn't hungry, I wanted more!!! Will definitely make again and will also make for company with a nice buttered bread and perhaps a protein like grilled/baked fish or chicken. This is a big hit!

I'm a longtime cook and have never come across this simple recipe. It's not extravagant, but it has layers of flavors. Good for weeknights and way better than any boxed mac and cheese you may be considering for the kids.

Really, this needed a recipe? Hasn't anyone ever experimented with herbs and such in the kitchen? I've made this and similar sauces before even seeing this recipe. We need a recipe to add black pepper and parmesan?

If you played golf and walked the course and came home dead tired, instead of grabbing your coat and going out to dinner...just boil a pot of spaghetti and make this simple sauce. It is so easy and so delicious that I think it must be illegal!!

This a very easy and really tasty pasta dish. I will often use pastas with some light flavoring to them already to make it a little more interesting (Trader Joe's lemon pepper pappardelle is a favorite), but it is also delicious just as written.

Excellent. I made this exactly as written, except (don't you love that) was light on the pepper because of the kids. The adults added more pepper to our bowls. Kids loved it: 9-, 7-, and 2-years-old.

My son and daughter really like this recipe. It was simple and quick. It is better than my "standard" pasta recipe. You should try it out!

OMG!!! This is not only simple but incredibly delicious in its simplicity! I added some lemon zest and I think adding some pine nuts would be very good.

Love this recipe. So easy, quick and tasty. I use Parmesan and Asiago, which I tend to have on hand at home. Highly recommended.

Pretty tasty. I found it a little too salty but it was very good for being such a quick dinner. I grated some Pecorino and Parmesan cheese. I will make it again but probably play around with cheeses that are less salty.

I made this with fresh pasta so since that cooks up lightening fast, I did things a little out of order. Melted the butter and pepper and 1/2 c of cheese.Set aside. Then boiled my noodles and added them to the pan. Mixed it up real good and added another 1/2 c of cheese. I only used 1/2c of the pasta water and I didn't have the problem that the other cooks had with too much salt b/c I hardly add salt to my water - ever. I'm 100% Italian and the ONLY cheese we use is Locatelli Pecorino Romano. It's the best. My husband raved over this and I will be making it again and again! Brava!

Wonderful, Fast, Easy.....I did add 3oz of chopped pancetta...bad I know...but oh so good!...I see no reason to alter other that the pancetta

Nailed this the first time I made it. Admittedly, it is not a difficult dish to prepare but it was tasty, tasty, tasty! This one will go high on the list for our "Go To" meals. Will I make it again? What time is it?

This was delicious! I made it with parmesan cheese rather than Grana Padano, and my only hiccup was the total amount of cheese. I grated my cheese with a microplane, which made both cheeses very fluffy. So, 3/4 cup of microplaned parmesan is not as much as 3/4 cup grated. In any case, I used enough cheese to make it very, very tasty and I will definitely make it again. It would be lovely with grilled chicken or shrimp/scallops.

Very tasty and very easy. I added some red pepper, green pepper, and garlic to give it a little more veggie. It turned out really well. I'm going to make this all the time.

delicious! we used parmesan and iberico, which we had on hand, and they were wonderful. if you really take the pasta out at the right time (i.e., early enough), it all comes together beautifully. if you have trouble, try removing the pasta sooner or perhaps adding less pasta water in the beginning.

Great dish! the history behing it it's also interesting...original dish from Lazio, same region where Rome is situated. The italian name for it is Cacio e Pepe. Buon Appetito.

It was good, but need more cheese, salt and pepper.

Fairly fool proof without modifications to the recipe. It went well with chicken. This will be a staple.

so simple, yet so good. It is essential to use good pecorino, since the cheese gives the pasta most of its flavor.

Absolutely FANTASTIC. I tried it the first time and thought "Meh," but after some experimentation, it's one of my favorite dishes EVER. A few pointers for those who didn't find it sublime, yet: 1) It's critical to get the cheese on the pasta while it is still very hot-- otherwise, the cheese won't melt, and the noodles don't become coated. I've found that pouring it into a large bowl and tossing is more effective than trying to stir it in a pan. In fact, if you take the pasta off the stove, drain it but don't shake the colander to extract the liquid, and have all of the sauce ingredients already prepared on hand, there's no need to do the pan step-- just throw them in a bowl and toss with all the ingredients and it coats it just like mac and cheese. 2) Don't use Parmesan at all! It doesn't melt well and doesn't really coat the noodles. Use finely grated Grana Padano (which is way cheaper, anyway), and it will coat the pasta beautifully, even if it isn't as "fine" a cheese as Parmigiano Reggiano. I actually use it for 100% of the cheese and find it more effective than throwing in a little Pecorino.

This was good--but I confess I just don't see what all the shouting kis about--just pasta, cheese, and butter. It's lovely if one uses the best of those...but it's not a grand discovery.

This and every other pasta dish from the May 2011 Bon Appétit must be tried. The mouthfeel that results in finishing the pasta this way is the star of the show.

Very surprised that my family loved this cheesy, peppery dish. A lot. I had trouble with the cheeses glopping together though. Next time I will try whisking the cheese into the hot pasta water til melted, then pouring that over the pasta (per Cooks Illustrated).

My wife is expecting our second and I decided I needed to do more. I started with this recipe and she was very impressed. I added some seasoned chicken which was great!

Quick. Quick. 20 minutes to the table. Serve with a salad and try to only eat one helping....

I agree, edible but nothing special. I even tracked down the suggested cheeses. It is quick but not sure I would recommend.

Made this for dinner tonight in the time it took to boil a pot of water & cook the pasta. It was really delicious & tasted far more decadent than it was as other reviewers have memtioned. Thanks for a super fast, easy & delicious recipe!

This is great. Add as little or as much pepper as you like. Make sure you use both chesses. The recipe is super easy. Great on it's own or wonderful as a side. Enjoy!!

Just love this simple, easy recipe. Even on nights when we don't have pecorino in stock and substitute other firm cheeses such as asiago it is still great.

Made this last night with homemade egg spaghetti. I used Parmesan instead of Grana Padano and crushed peppercorns in a Jamie Oliver "Flavourshaker." My husband loved the taste and it was dead easy to make.

This could be our new Al Fredo. Has to be better on the waste line than all that cream. Be careful of the salt in the pasta water. Our first attempt at this was very salty because I usually add alot of salt to my pasta water and then using this water to thin out the consistency was too much. Can't wait to try this on my grandchildren who think my cheesy spaghetti (Al Fredo) is the best.

I have now made this pasta dish twice - once for the family and once for a dinner party (I doubled it). The first time, my teenage daughter raved that it tasted like alfredo for grown ups and my husband, not usually a pasta man, requested seconds. At the dinner party, everyone asked me to share the recipe. What a simple yet sophisticated dish! Followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is great. Easy, and very tasty. Made some spicy Italian sausage on the side since the hubby likes meat for dinner.. oy. Usually I end up making too much pasta, but this is perfect! Will absolutely be making this again!

This was delicious! Such a simple, tasty recipe. I added a little extra pepper (maybe about 1.5 tsp total) because I ground too much and we love pepper anyway. I also made a minor human error: I followed Bon Appetit's advice for salting the pasta water (much more salt than I usually use), but I ended up needing more than 3/4 c of pasta water to get the sauce the right consistency (I think my pan was too hot when I first added the water because most of it boiled off). Adding the extra water gave me the right consistency, but made the dish very salty (especially since the cheeses are already so salty). It was still delicious, just be careful not to accidentally over-salt the sauce by adding too much water.

Simply elegant dinner for 2. Rich with cheese rather than cream. Must love Parmesan and Pecorino.
