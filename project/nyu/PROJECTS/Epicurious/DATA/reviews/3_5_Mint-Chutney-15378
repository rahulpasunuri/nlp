This was good. I have to admit I was a tad disappointed though. I think the yogurt may have distracted somewhat from the pungent flavor I was craving. I also probably would have left at least some seeds in from the serrano, as I like more spice. It tasted a little flat before I added the vinegar, but when I added the vinegar, it tasty a little vinegary. I may try adding some lime juice instead of lemon next time, cutting down on the yogurt, and adding more serrano seeds. A good recipe that you can't go wrong with, but I was disspointed that the flavors I smelled in the pan did not transfer as well to the sauce. A great use for garden mint though. This recipe takes a lot!

I thought this was good and the ingredient list was certainly interesting. It went well with the samosas, but I didn't think it was a necessity with them.

This is awesome chutney--the best green chutney I have ever had anywhere. I was eating it by the spoonful! I was worried tbat the whole spices might end up a bit crunchy even after blending, which was the case, though the result was rather pleasant. I omitted the vinegar, finding it to be sour enough with just the lemon juice, and I added a bit of salt. Oh, I roasted the almonds by adding them to the coconut/spice mixture, and that worked just fine (and saved a step).

This is one of those all-time great recipes, I have served this many many times with samosas (the fennell-scented spinach and potatoe are terrific) or with any tandoori style BBQ as a side. This also is a great accompaniment for the Grilled Tandoori Lamb recipe found on this site. Highly recommended, always rave reviews from guests.

This goes great with the accompanying samosas. This recipe has been a real hit at parties since the first time I made it when the recipe came out.
