This was a fantastic alternative to the different types of tacos I usually make. The beans are amazing! I followed the recipe and ingredients as much as possible. The only changes I made was that I used store bought corn tostada shells and shredded the chicken vs. cutting it into chunks. Flavors were so good!

I just love this recipe! I've made it countless times and it's a real crowd pleaser. One big change is I've never made the tortillas - I serve it over brown rice instead. I've done it without the chicken for a vegetarian version, which is also fantastic. I also sometimes sub feta for the goat cheese.

great taco salad flavor. I used leftover roast chicken and about half a taco seasoning packet. I tossed the salsa with the lettuce anf have used TJ's cuban black beans.

Very good! We followed the recipe to the letter, except we just chopped up the avacado instead of making the whole avacado salsa - still came out quite tasty. I also recommend switching the order - go tortilla, beans, chicken, salad, salsa, goat cheese and it's awesome.

I made these as burritos instead of tostadas, and they were fantastic. Tostadas are just too messy for us (especially messy for my husband). We loved them!

My husband loved this...not quite as spicy as I expected...would pump up the salsa next time...would marinate & grill the chicken next time as well...try it!

Each element of this recipe (beans, chicken and, especially, salsa)is excellent in its own right. It was a big hit with my husband, as well as my 3 and 5 year olds, who really ate up the chicken, salsa and goat cheese. I, myself, preferred it with either beans or chicken, not both, because by the time you have built all the layers it becomes a very precarious thing.

Very different, but tasty. Made for a large crowd of teenagers, most of them liked it. I served everything at room temp, great for a hot summer day.

This was good if you use high-quality goat cheese. I made this a second time and omitted the chicken, substituted guacamole dressing from the Joy of Cooking for the salsa, and used cheddar instead of goat cheese. I thought it was easier and better.

Incredible! I went a little overboard on the red onions and will scale back next time. I also added a bit more cilantro and cheated by using ready-made corn tortillas.

Just LOVED this! The salsa has become a favorite all by itself. I have also served these as a small hor's douvres by using a 2" circular cookie cutter. These tostadas should ALWAYS be served crispy(fry or brush with oil and throw on the grill).

This recipe was different and delicious. I served it for six at a dinner party along with Mexican corn and rice. Very easy to prepare most everything ahead of time. I would recommend frying the tortillas before your guests arrive to avoid creating a very greasy smell in the kitchen. Also great dish to assemble with your guests for a fun activity.

Very different, great combination. We all raved. Will definitely make again. I even baked the tortilla with a brush of oil to lower the fat a touch & it was still great!

This is not only delicious but really makes a pretty presentation as well. I originally made this recipe when it was first published in Bon Appetit in June of 1992. We liked it so much I have been saving the recipe all this time (a bit crumpled and stained from using it so much). Glad to see the recipe here on Epicurious so I can finally throw the old paper one away!!

One of our favorite recipes! I marinate the chicken in OJ, garlic, chili powder and cumin then grill and slice it. Also- to make it easier I've subsituted purchased white corn chips instead of frying our own. Delicious summer meal all by itself.

Mmmmm...I loved them! The black beans and goat cheese were delicious together with the crunchy toastadas. I will definitely make them again.

Very nice use of goat cheese. I thought each person would eat 2, so I doubled the recipe, and enjoyed leftovers for a while after. I served it with mexican corn and rice with cumin and peppers (but I can't find the recipe -??)
