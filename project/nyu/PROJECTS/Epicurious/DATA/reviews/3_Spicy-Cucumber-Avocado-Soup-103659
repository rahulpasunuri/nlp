Like the other reviewers, I also replaced the ice cubes with buttermilk and used Greek yogurt instead of regular plain low-fat yogurt. However, to keep it on the healthier side, I did use low fat buttermilk and low fat Greek yogurt. I also used a whole jalapeno (took seeds out of one half as a precaution), upped the lime juice, used a whole avocado, and used just a touch less salt than the recipe calls for. Also only used one cucumber. With these modifications, the soup is delicious! Just enough spice to make it interesting, but still cool and refreshing.

As per other reviews I made a few changes to the recipe. I added green bell peppers, paprika, cumin, red onion, garlic powder,and cayenne pepper. The taste was very prominent, but next time I will tone down the cayenne pepper. I also added some milk to improve the consistency. Finally, I added some crumbled blue cheese for added depth in flavor. It was a fantastic addition!

I'm not sure what I expected from this dish, but it really just tasted like spicy cucumbers. I wish it were more hearty. Maybe it would get there with more avocado and yogurt. I made a video of the dish for my blog: http://makeityourdamnself.wordpress.com (Spicy Cucumber-Avocado Soup)

this actually got much better a day or two after i made it. i added chopped cherry tomatoes and some crumbled queso fresca for some texture and i ended up really liking this soup!

i followed the suggestions to use greek yogurt and used some milk instead of the ice cubes. i also upped the jalapeno a bit to guarantee spiciness. the flavors were good, but the texture was still a little weird. this would make a nice, small, starter for a dinner, but a large bowl of it was more than i wanted to eat.

This could have used a touch of honey though it was also fine as is. I wonder if ½ jalapeno would have been better. I made a double batch with most of a pepper and I got neither the flavor nor the heat (unless I mistakenly picked a milder pepper that looked like a jalapeno). Not Spicy at all. This might have also been tasty with the amount of avocado increased with more of the flavor & smooth texture. I did not use any ice. But this was definitely a winner. Eaten with pita chips.

I found it too bitter. I will try it again, because it was sooo easy, and I love the ingredients, but I think next time I'll strip off half the cucumber skin

I followed the advice of "A Cook from Los Angeles", 7/4/07 and liked the results. I used pickled jalapeno and extra lime juice. This was very nice for a summer night.

I guess it's not fair for me to rate this recipe since I tinkered with it so much without first trying it as written, but that's the beauty of soup-- it's versatile. Traditionally, soup has always been a heap of leftovers, plus liquid. Well, today, I went through my crisper and asked myself what needed to be used before it turned to compost. I threw my whole avocado in the blender with a little less than one hot house cucumber, and a LOT more than 1 tsp fresh lime. I did not have yogurt, chives, or jalapenos on hand, so I tossed in some grape tomatoes, almost an entire bag of celery (with leaves), and a half a red pepper, with a generous dash of sea salt and some whole black peppercorns. I skipped the ice cubes, because I like the velvety texture of what came out of my blender already, but I will sprinkle some flax seeds, snipped herbs, and probably a little bit of chopped tomato on top when I serve it. This recipe is really too simple to screw up. Just get creative, and remember that not everyone's tastes are the same. Lighten up!

I think this recipe is wonderful for those hot summer days when you want your vegetables, but can't bear to turn on the stove! I've made it several times, varying the ratios of the ingredients. I prefer 1 avocado and 1 english cucumber, and I use a 6 oz. container of greek yogurt. To those who found it bland--well, it's certainly not the most intense dish you'll ever make. But if you like avocadoes and cucumbers, and add enough salt and jalapeno for a zip, this is a subtle and delicious soup. Try it!

For the lactose intolerant among us - I substituted one cup of soy-based sour cream substitute (Sour Supreme, Tofutti brand) for the yogurt. I added two vegetable boullion cubes dissolved in a cup of water to thin the "sour cream" and also used a whole avocado. I'm not lactose intolerant so I know what the dairy version would taste like, and this non-dairy version is delicious.

Fabulous! Follow the tips that follow in the other reviews. Re: Theresa from Arlington, VA: thanks 4 the tip on the Trader Joes frozen avocados! As much I love TJ and convenience, I tried these once for guacamole and found them to be absolutely gross - slimey, flavorless, etc. Inedible. Curious if anyone else has tried them? But thanks nonetheless. Love this site.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used a whole avocado, a bunch of cilantro, whole milk yogurt and buttermilk instead of ice cubes. I enjoyed it as did my husband and 1/4 children. Other children suggested the leftovers would make for a good facial :)

Not to beat a dead horse, but it's imperative to read the reviews on this recipe and follow the advice accordingly. I too used a full-fat plain yogurt, substituted buttermilk for the 1 cup of ice cupes, and added cilantro along with the chives. The result was an extremely pleasant and smooth soup with a subtle and interesting notes. Make sure to taste and season (the soup was a little bland without the addition of some extra salt) before giving the soup a few hours in the fridge...it definitely benefits from some "down time" before serving. I served this in a shallow bowl with a pile of crab meat in the center, garnished with 2 chives. Beautiful color.

I liked this and I'd make it again. I really liked the consistency--some people had said it was too thick, so we added a little water. The yogurt combined with the high-speed blender made it nice an frothy. It was refreshing. I thought it was a little lacking in flavor, but it was pleasant.

I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used one avocado and one cucumber. I then added 2% fat Greek yogurt and 1 cup of buttermilk. The consistency was just right. The lime gves it a fresh taste. I added cilantro and Tabasco for some zip. However, I think Italian parsley or watercress would be good too. Be sure it has enough salt or it will tasteless no matter what you add. I had Avocado Soup at Sanford's-a wonderful restaurant in Milwaukee-served with buttermilk sorbet. Obviously, it was a memorable experience.

Having read the previous reviews, I used a whole avocado and one cucumber. I eliminated the water, used a 2% Greek yogurt and one cup of buttermilk. The consistency was just right. From that point you can add watercress, or parsley, or cilantro. For heat jalapeno or hot sauce. I used cilantro and tabasco, and thought it was a great summer refresher. A dish like this was served to me in a restaurant with a scoop of buttermilk sorbet. Obviously, it was a memorable experience.

This is like a blank canvas. Try some cheddar cheese (lowfat or full fat) on top to add some additional flavor that isn't salt or hot. I will definitely make this again, but probably not in the same way as before. Had a lot of fun with it.

I read all of the reviews and expected to make something yummy. Quite the contrary I'm afraid....boring. This is the very late night before a very special birthday picnic for my honey's b'day...I had no back-up plan. Please help! I added cilantro a little cumin 1/2 a serrano (no jalepeno) 1 whole avo, whole plain yogurt and a dash of cayenne. What should I do to spice this dish up a bit (not heat wise)? Has potential, I think, but I'm out out ideas at this hour. :-(

Delicious, with tweaks, following other reviewers' suggestions. For three servings (half an avocado doesn't make enough of anything for 6 people), double the avocado (use at least a whole one), reduce the cucumber (one whole English cucumber is plenty), increase the jalapeno (I used half a fat one, and it still wasn't too hot). Whole-milk yogurt is better, as low-fat yogurt makes it sour, and sour cream makes it a dip. Everyone is right about the cilantro; I used a big handful along with the chives, and it was perfect. The soup does benefit from sitting for at least several hours, and probably overnight. It's a beautiful color, and makes an unexpected and delicious first course. Super easy to serve, too; you could take it on a picnic. I'll be making this as long as good avocados are around.

We doubled the recipe to serve six large servings, and added about 1 bell pepper. To spice it up we used a whole jalapeno and added ground black pepper. A wonderful soup as it is, at first, cool and smooth, and then has a strong, spicy kick.

Fast and Easy. I added cilantro and used buttermilk rather than ice cubes. Trader Joes has frozen (Hass) avocado halves (allowing you to keep them on hand and use at whim) which I partially defrosted on the counter for an hour which really makes this a convenient throw together soup at the last minute. Costco has the english cukes in a 3-pack (they hold in the fridge quite well).

We both got home about 8:00 from work, what more can I say, this took the 10 min. A loaf of bread and sliced tomatoes--- a glass of wine to forget the day and enjoy. I did use 2 avocados & 1 Jalapeno pepper

This was quite good. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used a whole avocado, substituted oregano for chives, and tripled the jalapeno. When I tested the soup, I found it a tad too spicy, so I added more yogurt and ice. I also wound up adding a touch of garlic salt and garnishing with chives and crumbled feta cheese. It was very nice with a couple cold bottles of beer at my patio table on a warm summer night.

I am a career person, so often do not have much time to create exciting meals. We LOVED this! We are pepper heads, so I tripled the amount of jalapeño, and could have added more, but I did not want to upset the delicate flavor of the lime, cucumbers and avocado. For a hot NY summer, this was really fantastic.

Had 4 ripe avocados and 2 regular cucumbers, so seeded the cukes and used all 4 avocados. Also used low-fat sour cream because I had no yogurt. Used 2 habanero chilis, because that's what I had on hand. Used only 1/4 cup ice cubes. It was FANTASTIC!!!

After reading the other and normally liking spicy food, a added a little extra jalopano - unfortunatly too much for my husband who said it was too spicy and would have been better with just the cukes and avocado. The texture was good and I think if you worked on the balance of the pepper, it could be very good. I also will try another reviewer's suggestion of adding shrimp - sounds great!

I thought this tasted like a plain, mashed up cucumber. I followed the recipe exactly, and then tried to salvage it by adding way more jalapinos and some more lime.... still nothing. BLAND BLAND BLAND! However, my parents (who would eat strained peas 24/7 if you served it to them...) loved it.

Wow! What a great and easy soup...especially since we are swimming in cucumbers. I used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 sour cream as that is what i had on hand. Also, I added an extra jalapeno pepper to kick it up a notch and I only added a small amount of ice cubes as I enjoy a thicker soup.

This is one of my favorite cold soups! I love the sour/tangy/spicy flavor, and do add a bit more jalapeno. It freezes well, too.....just thaw and whisk to bring back to the proper consistency.

When I make this(and I do alot), I use more avocado, substitute sour cream for the yogurt, and cilantro for the chives and WOW----is it wonderful. My husband, who thinks he's funny(haha), says it reminds him of a potato chip dip-----told him to keep his chips away from my spectacular soup! Try this soup and do what you like with it----don't think you'll be disappointed.

I like cold soups in general, so I tried this one before reading reviews. Found the straight recipe tasty, but thin and lacking pizzaz. Will try again, but follow other reviewers recommendations of doubling avocado & using sour cream & cilantro...should improve flavor/texture measurably. For those diet-conscious among us, non-fat sour cream should work.

I have made this recipe twice now, putting differing amounts of jalepen~o. I prefer it a little spicier. Also, since everyone I know has different preferences of garnish, I put a plate of Monterey Jack Cheese, fresh chopped cilantro, fresh chives, and fresh cubed avocado on the table, and everyone makes the soup the way they want. The soup is very visually appealing, too.

This is a satisfying summer soup, but you surely have to like yogurt to enjoy it. I am not a yogurt fan and so had to adapt to the tart/sour-ness. Didn't have a jalepeno in house, but made the soup anyways and will make it again. Part of the enjoyment was that it was so low fat and packet with good things.

This soup seemed to beg for a SW influence. I used a whole avocado and added a handful cilantro to the processor, subbed toasted and rehydrated dried chipotles, and fried 3" rounds of corn tortilla to float on the soup. I layered the rounds with sour cream then put heaping teaspoons of fresh tomato salsa on the floating rounds. Mucho gusto!
