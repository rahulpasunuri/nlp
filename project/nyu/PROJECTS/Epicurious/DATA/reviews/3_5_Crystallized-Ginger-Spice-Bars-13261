For those who love ginger, these bars are great! Really a lot like very strong gingerbread. Left them in for ~12 minutes and they were crispy on the edges, slightly chewy in the middle. Next time, might leave in for longer to get something more like a gingerbread crisp: the combination of the chewy crystallized ginger with the crisp cookie might be particularly good.

These bars are a staple of our home's cookie collection; spicy and not too sweet, they're perfect with tea or coffee and great in the winter. A good recipe for the holidays. Prepare these the night before you want to bake them and note that it does take some time to chop up the sticky crystallized ginger. These bars don't LOOK great, but if you like ginger, you will LOVE them!

Very good. Basically, very gingery gingerbread. I thought they were great, but they were too intense for my boyfriend, so only 3 forks.

I froze half the dough last night when I made these, and I'm thawing it as I write! I'm not sure how long I baked them, as I put them in at dinner time, and forgot about them, but the oven went out, so the end result is crispy delicious cookies. I used at least double the ginger, but the stuff I bought last time (bulk) is quite mild. I think I'll use even more in the next batch. Addictively good!

I made the dough and froze half of the batch - these are great with ice cream after dinner. I have made these 3 times - easy and everyone gobbles them right up! You can play with the thickness of the slice - and I tend to bake a bit longer to make them crispy. Yum!

Delicious!! These bars have got a great bite to them,(I nearly doubled the crystalized ginger). Nice crunchy texture, great for dipping in my tea. Loved these.
