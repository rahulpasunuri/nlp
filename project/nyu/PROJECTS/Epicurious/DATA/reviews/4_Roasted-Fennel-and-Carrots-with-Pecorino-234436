definitely use all the olive oil and cheese. when i have made it with less, it was ok but lacked something. i was not sure about roasted fennel but it turns out beautifully. a very good complement to the lamb with salsa verde (giada de laurentiis' easter menu).

Fabulous. Even my husband, who is not a fennel fan, had seconds. I followed the recipe, but didn't actually measure anything. Probably used less oil. No pecorino on hand so substituted "Premoo" Cheese. Yum.

So incredibly good. I'm going to break out the mandoline next time so the fennel and carrots are more uniform thickness. And there will def. be a next time. I usually tweek the recipes to some extent based on the feedback & reviews but this one stands as is. Thought about subbing reggianno for the pecorino but so happy I stuck to the recipe. May be the best fennel I've ever had.

We served this as a side dish with pasta bolognese and beet salad last night. We received many compliments! The flavors are terrific for such a simple combination. As others suggested, I tossed the veggies with less olive oil prior to roasting. Added the cheese right before serving. Yum!

Loved it. Used Lots of Carrots. 3cloves minced garlic. Mixed oil with other seasonings and poured over veggies and tossed.Refrigerated overnight. Layered with cheese and baked one hour. Then added additional grated cheese and baked another 15 min.

Simple recipe letting the vegetable flavours shine. I omitted the cheese and cut down the baking time to 45 minutes as we like to keep our vegetables tender to the bite. The combination of fennel and carrot is lovely. Used young carrots, so I kept them whole with part of their tops on which I think makes a nicer presentation.

This was really good! Make sure you remove the tougher outer layers of the fennel, and do not undercook. Add the cheese toward the end if you're concerned about burning it.

A nice light vegetable for a dinner party (as opposed to a gratin or similar). It is very basic but it lets the taste of the fennel shine through.

It's good, but not great; a basic, is what I would say. After all, it's carrots and fennel roasted with cheese on top. A nice combination, but just roasted veggies, when you come right down to it.

This was delicious! Used different colored carrots and Piave cheese instead of Pecorino. One of my new faves.

a couple modifications when I made this recipe: 1. used purple carrots, which looked pretty to begin with, but then looked black when the dish was done. Tasted terrific, did not look so great. 2. only had one fennel bulb, so I added in two onions. 3. separated each of the veggies, after I sliced them, and tossed them individually with olive oil, then proceeded to layer in the pan as per the recipe. Did not add any additional oil at the end. This dish was excellent! Part of a wonderful spring menu with lamb.

I wanted to love this but didn't. It was OK. No raves and I had a lot of left overs.

I used a mandoline to cut the fennel and carrot about 1/4". It was starting to burn after 45 minutes, but it was still really yummy. The cheese melts in. It's surprisingly savory and not licoricy.

Fabulous! I did use a bit less oil also. This is even good w/o the cheese. The combination of the flavors is excellent. I have made this several times.

This is so good and easy, I make it every time I have guests and everyone eats it and raves. I agree that 1/3 cup of olive oil is too much; the cheese adds oil as it cooks. 2-3 Tbs is plenty, just enough to coat the veggies.

Excellent. I did hoiwever use 6 carrors instead of 2. Leftovers were nil.

I made this yesterday for our "Gourmet Club" dinner. It's an easy side dish to make but is so tasty. Everyone raved and wanted to take leftovers home with them. I will definitely make again. Fantastic!

I have made this twice and it has been excellent both times. This is easy, delicious, and looks pretty. The vegetables can be sliced ahead of time and the dish assembled in about 10 minutes before baking.

This recipe has been excellent every time I have made it. I find 1/3 c olive oil a bit excessive given the cheese, and prefer it with only a couple of tablespoons oil.

I made this for dinner tonight and both my boyfriend and I loved it. I love roasted fennel and the carrots went with it perfectly.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and found it fantastic, as did all my guests. I made it quite a few hours ahead of time and just reheated when guests arrived.

The pecorino on this is SO good.

I didn't have much hope for this as I was assembling it. I thought it was going to be a big steamy orange and white mess. It ended up cooking down by at least half. This is THE yummiest roasted fennel. I assembled it in the morning and then roasted it and let it rest and then warmed it up before serving. I was trying a roasted assorted fingerling potato dish and I ended up layering them with the fennel in the middle of the plate and putting grilled fish on top and sprinkling the whole thing with the fennel fronds. It was really good.

I cheated and added some carmelized onions to the finished dish!!! Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe

Delicious! I actually did what a previous reviewer recommended and tossed the fennel and carrots in the olive oil. I also added 3 chopped cloves of garlic. I did this in a ziploc bag and let it sit at room temperature for a few hours. Everyone loved it...even my teenagers!

Made for Easter Dinner with the Lamb with salsa verde. Perfect combination.

This dish was just ok. Although I like all these ingredients separately, put them together and they were blah.

This is a great side dish. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, but found that it came out too salty. The second time I made it I tossed the carrots, fennel, salt and pepper, and olive oil in a bowl and then made my layers. I felt I had a better distribution of ingredients this way.
