I do this dish with sea bass. For the succotash if fresh broadbeans aren't available, frozen broadbeans or lima beans and even edamame work well. You'll get the best results with fresh corn. Don't even think about using tinned creamed corn: it's too stodgy and not fresh-tasting enough. I add a dash of Tabasco to the creamed corn. To the succotash a little basil chiffonade is nice if added at the last minute, piled on top for height and fresh colour, or decorate the plate with some chive oil made with finest olive oil. Yummy!

SUPERB! I didn't bother with the fava bean topping; instead I added some fresh oregano to the corn mixture. Substituted low-fat milk for whipping cream and it worked fine. I will definitely serve this to company.

If you can't get a reservation at the French Laundry or Per Se, make the recipe for a fine example of Keller's magic. As noted, you must use the freshest ingredients.

I made just the succostash and creamed corn. The succotash was very good but the creamed corn was EXCELLENT and even liked by people who don't usually care for corn. Both were simple to make.

This recipe is light and delicious. I used fancy frozen creamed corn from Whole Foods and it worked very well.

Had some super fresh fava beans and this was the perfect way to use them! Cooked them for a little less than 5 minutes, and they were just a little overcooked. Your ingredients must be flawless to really appreciate this recipe! Replaced the parsley with some nice green onions and served with seared scallops. Yum!

I agree with the cook from Cape Cod on fresh ingredients. You must have very fresh, organic vegetale to enjoy this dish. Then, you will not have problems like not having enogh flavor. I just loved this.

This is a fabulous dish if all your ingredients are very fresh (no frozen limas). I baked the fish on an oiled sheet at 475 degrees for 7 minutes just until it flaked. It was moist and I think much better than fried in oil. The fresh fava beans add a bright green accent.

The creamed corn was worth the effort but the recipe in general lacked enough flavor. Made for a family gourmet group and while everyone enjoyed the fresh flavor, I was dissappointed. Maybe add garlic to the oil before frying the fish; maybe add something with a punch to the lima bean mixture. Very "summery" dish but just wasn't all I wanted it to be!
