Simple as can be, and just as good if nonfat yogurt is used. Great use for fresh pineapple. Even my husband liked it, and he's not a plain yogurt fan.

Excellent quick dessert, but I must confess to using canned pineapple in its own juice because that's what I had on hand and I wanted to try it. I used the juice instead of water and reduced the sugar, but the contrast between the sourness of the yogurt cheese and the sweetness of the pineapple syrup gave just the right note. I will make again, with fresh pineapple if I have it, but with canned if that's what's available.
