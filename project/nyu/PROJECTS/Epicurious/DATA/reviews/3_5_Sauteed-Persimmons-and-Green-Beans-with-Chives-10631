Made a day ahead. Served at room temperature. Colorful and leftovers were good too. I forgot to cut beans into 1/2-inch pieces and I think that would add to the tastiness of the dish as each forkful would be more likely to have both flavors. I will make again as my tree puts out a lot of persimmons and this is different.

Wow! I was skeptical of adding sweet fruit to green beans, but this was really tasty! The flavors went together surprisingly well....

I wanted to try a dish with persimmons, so I made this as a side dish at a dinner party. I did like the blend of flavors and overall it was popular, however I didn't like the skins of the persimmons in this dish. They were too tough compared with the soft fruit and al dente greenbeans. I will make it again, but next time will remove the persimmon skins (I imagine with the same method that one removes tomato skins.)

Simple to make, looks really pretty and tastes delicious. Made it earlier in the day exactly per the recipe but served it at room temperature as a sort of Thanksgiving dinner salad. Too bad persimmon season is so short!

This turned out surprisingly tasty! I also found that I needed no salt, since the persimmons brought out the sweetness of the beans. Three persimmons were enough in my case, although a fourth could certainly be added. I agree that the chives are better wilted than raw. This dish stood up well to some last-minute reheating right before serving and made a delightfully colorful addition to the Thanksgiving spread.

The sauteed persimmons and chives gave the beans an almost Chinese flavor. So simple and so sophisticated! Too bad my family isn't as sophisticated.... my iguana loved the leftovers!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful: colorful, simple to make, and relatively low in calories too. I forgot the chives, and it made not a bit of difference. It's a great change from more usual preparations of green beans, and everyone enjoyed it. Definitely a keeper. And yes, I used 1.5 lbs of persimmons.

Delicious - I could have it for dessert! I agree with the cook from San Mateo-more persimmons. Also, I don't like the raw chives sprinkled on top - add more to the recipe.

Very colorful and quite delicious! I really liked the combination of flavors, and was surprised it didn't even need any salt. Next time, I will increase the persimmons to 1.5 lbs.

Definitely use delicate green beans. And lots and lots of chives.

Wonderful, fun dish that added color to our Thanksgiving meal. This treatment of persimmons really makes the taste shine! I used french beans and would recommend this more delicate touch (over blue lake, et. al.).
