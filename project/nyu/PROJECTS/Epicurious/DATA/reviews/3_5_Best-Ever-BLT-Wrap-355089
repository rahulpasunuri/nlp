This a simple BLT that is found in the most adorable children's "Recipe Box", MY LUNCH BOX, 50 RECIPES TO TAKE TO SCHOOL! It is a classic BLT with a little modern twist, whole wrap and turkey bacon! My kids loved it and it was quick and easy to make!

While it is great I cannot believe it is under the heading of Best-Ever. I mean come on, it's just a BLT. I just think that to be the Best-Ever you have to do better than just the basic normal recipe that anyone would use off the top of their head to make a basic blt wrap. I'm just sayin.
