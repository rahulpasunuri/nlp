Great weeknight pasta - I made it exactly as written except used grape tomatoes. I would say it's a 3.5 star recipe but rounded up. It gets bonus points for being so fast and easy. It's also simple enough that you could make a lot of modifications for what's on hand. (Other reviewers mentioned parsley, adding shrimp, etc. It all sounds good.)

Superb. Just use your favorite tomatoes and you can't go wrong. I can't believe what a nice touch the breadcrumbs made; I used toasted panko.

Made it a few times with red cherries, sungolds and large yellow tomatoes. Nice use of fresh ingredients that can be pulled together fast, but not exceptional flavor. Not everything has to be awesome. This is one of those.

Will definitely be adding this to the rotation. Its all about the fresh ingredients with a dish this simple. I also agree with previous reviewer about the addition of some minced anchovy.

Outstanding. I wish I'd found this recipe a month ago when my sungold plants started going nuts. I would have made and frozen this in bulk. Enormous flavor with such simple ingredients.

Excellent. I doubled the amount of tomatoes and used 3 cloves of garlic. Simple and very good.

I made this recipe with sun gold tomatoes and basil from my garden. I used Pecorino cheese. I made it just how the recipe states with the exception of doubling the garlic. Oh my, it was so good! I used gluten free pasta since I am intolerant to gluten. My husband really liked the pasta as well. I think this is one of those recipes that I can just throw together without following the recipe because it was so easy to make. Oh and it is not bland at all. The sun gold tomatoes are bursting with flavor.

These kinds of recipes are why I LOVE Italian food! Out of necessity I substituted fresh parsley for the basil and whole (but good) tomatoes for the sun golds. It was still really wonderful! I can't wait to make it exactly as written.

So simple, I thought this would be good but it was great- top dish of the summer for me. Love the technique of finishing the pasta in the sauce, I thought it was way too saucy at first but the spaghetti absorbed it perfectly. Breadcrumbs are a great finishing touch.

This recipe comes up as a high fiber one. Huh?

Like another reviewer, I too could only find sun burst, not sun gold. I used shaved parm because that's all I had, and it did clump a little for all my effort to crumble it by hand. Nonetheless, tt all came together really nicely. Husband thought that shrimp would be a good addition, but I prefer it as is. He love love loveed it, I thought it was respectable, hence the 3/4 ("delicious").

What a great way to enjoy the tomatoes and basil from the farmers market! Quick and easy to prepare and delicious! I used shells because I didn't have capellini, spaghetti or bucatini and they worked great. I doubled the red pepper flakes and through in an extra clove of garlic. i think Pecorino is the way to go - parmesan would be fine too, but I think pecorino adds something extra. I'm sure the breadcrumbs would be great but I don't think I would go to the trouble - this is great on its own.

A very special recipe when using the best ingredients! I have been using that same pasta technique for several years (from the cookbook by Faith Willinger "Red, White, and Greens") and it always makes for tasty pasta! The Sun Gold tomatoes really shine in this dish! Okay, so they are my favorite cherry tomatoes!! :) I used imported pasta and I do think that helped make it extra special. My husband loved the red pepper flakes! All in all, it's a winner (easy too :) Try it!!

This is amazingly delicious. The flavor of the cheese--I used pecorino--pairs incredibly well with the yellow tomatoes. It seems so simple, but there's something special about it--much better than your typical red tomato pairing with pecorino. I got the tomatoes at the farmer's market so I'm not 100% sure they were sun gold, but they looked just like them and tasted just as described! I didn't add the last T of oil--still great.

I've made this twice now and love it. The second time I doubled the amount of tomatoes, red pepper, basil, and garlic. I love a lot of sauce and these proportions did the trick for me.

Nothing special ... bordering on boring!

Loved this...incredibly easy to prepare and sun gold tomatoes make all the difference...especially when you get them off the tomato plant standing in your back yard!!

Easy to make and very tasty! We rate our meals in our family and my 5 and 9 year old gave it 10 million stars out of 5. I do not like basil so we used oregano instead.

Made this tonight. I was a little impatient with the tomatoes and tried smashing them too early. A few went flying. Next time I'll let them cook a little longer before squishing them. My go to Sun Gold recipe is similar to Formann's (previous poster) ... an uncooked fresh sauce made with halved Sun Golds, minced garlic, lemon zest, olive oil and fresh basil. ... but this was a refreshing change of pace. Will definitely make again.

We have tried this recipe and raise our own Sungolds so I can only say what we prefer. We use the same ingredienst plus add several anchovey strips (finely minced). We play a bit fast and loose with the amounts as we like lots of garlic and fresh basil. Also between and tomato juice and olive oil we want enough for a good base. We mix all in the bowl but DO NOT COOK. After preparing the pasta we add the hot pasta to the tomato mixture and toss well. Top with a bit more grated cheese and parsley for garnish and enjoy. We also use finishing salt at the table

Made this with golden Sunburst tomatoes, which are similar to Sungold, although not as sweet/intense. The sauce was amazing, and so with Sungolds I would expect it to be even more so. Wish I had more bites of tomato with the pasta, so next time may double that. Really appreciate how something so delicious could be made from so few ingredients, and so simply. Thank you, Mario!

So as not to affect the rating, I am giving this the 4 that it currently has. I very much look forward to a review by someone who has followed the recipe, and that would be with sun gold tomatoes. No doubt that particular tomato will change the outcome and most likely for a better outcome.

Simple and quite delicious. It had the affect of being warm, comfort food, but the freshness of the tomatoes and the basil kept the dish feeling light and summery. I had a large, garden tomato that I needed to use up, so I used that instead of the cherry tomatoes; chopped it coarsely and threw it in the pan, seeds, juice, and all. Very yummy.

delicious! i used organic cherry tomatoes. sooooooooo good and simple!

Just delicious! I used campari tomatoes and a blend of cheese,reg parm, romano, parmigano reggiano and doubled the recipe using 3/4 box angel hair. It was very, very good and I will be making it again soon when native tomatoes arrive since the cost now is a little HIGH. This is a keeper, I worried about the skins of the tomatoes but frankly, it did not matter! Simple to make and restaurant taste.

Delicious! Agree that I have been making pasta the "wrong way" until now! This recipe is simple, but sooo good. Pasta (used thin spaghetti), cheese, any heirloom tomato (I subbed a large heirloom yellow for the Sun Golds), red pepper, basil, what's not to love? Run home and make yourself some tonight!

Oh my God is Bon Apetit right: I *have* been making pasta the wrong way. This recipe is such the right way that it could be the source of a major religion. Do you hear me, Pastafarians? This is your new testament. This technique is dead simple and the results are incredible. Get yourself some tomatoes from the farmers market and go to town. There is no need to deviate from the original recipe; follow it and be ready to be touched by His Noodly Appendage.

I won't rate this yet, but I have to comment - why is this recipe the recipe of the day in MAY, when sun gold babies won't be ready for at least two months? I'm saving this one to try when these are in season.
