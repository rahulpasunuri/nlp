Another Update! I must be the only person that finds this pie heavenly! I used Jazz apples this year, instead of Granny Smith. The GS apples are just too tart for this pie. I used only the amount of brown sugar called for by the recipe, and it was perfect with the added sweetness of the Jazz apples. Plus, Jazz apples have enough crunch to stand up to baking really well. I thought it was a perfect pie. And do NOT forget to macerate the cranberries in brandy. It totally ROCKS this pie!

UPDATE - I made this pie again for Christmas this year. Doubled the sugar this time around, as the Granny Smith apples I used were very tart. Last year's pie needed a bit of sweetening. Also used A Cook from St, Paul's suggestion of macerating the cranberries in brandy. The pie was PERFECTION! Thanks for the tip!

this is a knockout recipe. I macerated the cranberries in brandy, increased spices a bit. Terrific.

I just finished eating a piece of this pie, still warm from the oven. YUM! At first, my thought was it was not sweet enough, but by the time I finished, I decided it was perfect. This is a pretty tart tasting pie, and if you like it sweeter, I'd recommend adding a bit more sugar. I didn't have any ice cream or whipped cream, but if I did, that would make a perfect accompaniment, and would add the extra sweetness that is not in the pie itself. The crust is lovely! I usually use a half butter/half shortening crust, but decided to use the one given. It was easy to work with and yielded delicious, flaky results. I found 8 apples to be too much for the filling. Six was plenty, but mine may have been bigger than average. Also, I added a teaspoon of Penzey's Vietnamese Cinnamon. It's a truly wonderful, strong cinnamon, and for me personally, I can't imagine Apple Pie without it. Nice pie. I'll be making it again.

I took this pie to a Christmas Party and it was well received. The crust was great and easy to work with. I didn't have the 100 minutes to bake it so I baked it at 400 for 25 minutes, covered with foil and baked 20 minutes more. The bottom crust was not completely cooked and the lower levels of the apples were still a bit crunchy. Not inedible, but not exactly right. I'd definitely cook it the prescribed time next time and at least double the amount of dried cranberries. I'll also try cornstarch instead of flour next time and a sweeter apple than Granny Smith. Overall though it was good, not too sweet and still festive.

Am I the only one with a sweet tooth?! Like a dummy I made this exactly per the instructions; 1/4 C sugar was not enough!

Very great crust and filling. Cranberries make a great addition.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. The crust was perfect and the filling was good. Don't use too much cloves or it will overpower all other flavor. And next time I might add another 1/4 c. of cranberries because I like them.

This is an excellent pie! The tartness of the Granny Smith apples is mellowed by the sweetness of the dried cranberries and the small amount of brown sugar. The seasonings were just perfect. I made this for our office's annual Pie Day event, always held one week before Thanksgiving. It got rave reviews!

I wouldn't say this was "beyond compare" and so I didn't rate this 4 forks. I rate it 3.75 forks, though! I made this recipe as a galette, using the crust recipe (which was fabulous like the other reviews have said) and the filling recipe, and it was DELICIOUS. I didn't have time to bake it for 100 minutes, which I thought was a long time for a pie. But, as I don't make a lot of pies, I wouldn't know for sure. However, I baked it for 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven, then covered it with foil and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes. It turned out absolutely scrumptious! I'm making it again this weekend (as a galette as I don't have to attempt to crimp pie edges!) : ) I highly recommend this recipe.

This was a great recipe. I made if for my Gram's 85th birthday. All the guests raved. I cheated and used ready to go crust (say what you will, I am a busy person and the crust got fab. reviews) but I did brush the crust with milk. I used a mixture of apples: fuji, macintosh, cameo,& gold. delicious. I added some lemon zest to the mixture. I was surprised how long the pie cooked, but I covered it after 45 minutes and it was fine for the additional 55 minutes. THe pie sliced very well, not runny at all. I like it when a pie slice can keep its shape.

"Best apple pie and crust ever" and I have made what must be 100's in my life! A great recipe......a keeper! Perfect for Thanksgiving....or anytime!

The crust is flaky and rich, and fairly easy to roll out. I agree with the other reviewer who said the flour added a "floury" taste to the apple filling. I've made this pie four times, first as written, and the rest of the times I make the following changes: I use cornstarch instead of flour in the filling, and I subsitute dried cherries for dried cranberries. (just a personal preference) Sometimes I brush it with a cream/egg wash and sprinkle sugar over the top, other times I decorate the top with scraps that look like fall leaves.

The crust was DE-LI-CIOUS. The filling was a bit bland.

Good recipe, but I won't add the flour to the apple and cranberry mixture next time. My husband loved the way it turned out but I thought the flour made it very, very "pasty," not at all tasty. :-)

This was the BEST apple pie I made! It has a tart like finish as apposed to a syruppy over-gooey finish. I improvised slightly and the results were spectacular. I placed it in an over-sized quiche dish. This leaves very little dough for the top. I used my cookie cutter and cut out holly leaves and placed it on top. I brushed with egg whites and sprinkled with cinnimon and sugar. I made this 3x in one month b/c it was soo good and sooo easy!

I added about 1/8 c finely chopped crystalized ginger and it made it great.

I now use this pie crust as my standard recipe. I found that pre-cutting the butter and chilling before adding all at once has achieved great results. Also, add the water one table spoon at a time since depending on the weather, it may not need that last tablespoon. Roll out between two sheets of plastic, fold into your pie pan and chill while you roll out the top crust. After both crusts are made and chilled, then assemble the pie. My guests totally flipped out over how light and flaky the crusts were.

Great Pie! Everyone at Easter dinner loved it. My brother was so excited when I let him take the leftovers home for his lunches. The cranberries add just the right extra something to the pie...it was delicious:-)

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for book-club evening and everyone enjoyed it. It is a nice parture from the typical apple pie. Serve it warm with cinnamon ice cream!

My Fiance made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was the best Apple pie I have ever had. The addition of cranberries was a wonderful contrast to the apples. The crust was among the best I've ever had also. So you can tell I liked it.
