This is wonderful, especially if you don't want to eat suet (which is in the mincemeat in a jar.) I use organic dried fruit from the farmers' market. Omited the dates....upped the brandy..decreased the water. Even the mincemeat haters, like this one.

Wow. This recipe made for a beautifully spiced, not-too-sweet dessert. Definitely to become a holiday tradition in our family!

Mincemeat from a jar or box in the supermarket is delicious. Sometimes I add dried apricots, apple slices, and a squeeze of lemon to the mincemeat. When the pie is done, I serve it with whipped cream. Wonderful!

while i like mincemeat, and enjoy it once a year at thanksgiving, my family took one look at this pie and declared it way too similar to the dreaded fruitcake and refused to even taste it. oh well. i'll have to go back to the mince meat from a jar at the supermarket.
