I've made this before as it is written and it was great! What's nice about Gazpacho is that you can add or subtract to your taste. This time I used 7 fresh garden tomatoes instead of the salsa, added 1/4 red onion, only used 1/2 tsp. cumin, didn't use the broth and added horseradish instead of Tabasco. It is great also. It's hard to mess it up and what a great summertime treat!

Very good and very easy. A little jalapeno in the processor and it is a real winner!

I've been making this for almost 9 years! It is just super. Don't forget to top it with sour cream and avacado!

I thought I would miss the fresh tomatoes, and I did.

Very good and extremely quick and easy. Also added worchestshire and topped with sour cream from a squirt bottle and some diced avocado. Other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This was a big hit at lunch! I like my gazpacho more chunky. Next time I make this I plan to only minimally blend the ingredients in the food processor. Also, I wouldn't remove the olive oil as some reviewers said. The small bit of fat it provides allows the body to get the full benefit from all the nutrients in the veggies!

I thought the salsa made this too sweet, and I'm not too keen on "old" veggies (from the salsa) in my gazpacho. It was fine, though.

I found this recipe last summer and am so excited my tomatoes are now ripe! I love this gazpacho, so do my sisters who beg me to make it for them. It's always a big hit!!

Fantastic gazpacho!!! It's so refreshing during the summer. My recommendations: 1. substitute a 12oz can of diced tomatoes and 2.5 cups of spicy V8 instead of the tomato juice to make it spicy and heartier. 2. Skip the olive oil- not missed. 3. Do add chicken stock- adds depth. 4. Garlic- 4 cloves is ALOT and it's good but next time I will only use 2, just to be considerate to my friends, co-workers and family. Enjoy!

Very good! Four cloves of garlic is a heap of garlic, though, when we're already using prepared salsa. I just used two and that was plenty. I also don't think the broth is necessary--other than that, this is a really good, speedy summer soup.

Absolutely fantastic!!! My husband ate it all up. It goes great with any kind of bread. I used one cup of Bloody Mary mix and used one cup less of the tomato juice. Heavenly. Something we're going to make over and over again. Extremely easy, too.

I only made half of this recipe which was perfect for my food processor. I did, however, use one English cucumber, white balsamic vinegar and grape oil. I coarsely chopped the vegetable ingredients first and then added the V-8 juice ar the end so as not to over chop the vegetables. Perfect! I could not wait to taste so I ate a whole bowl. Heavenly!!!

Dee-lish! Used a combination of tomato juice, V8 and canned diced tomatoes. Added a splash of Worchestershire and used garlic tabasco instead of regular. Also used a chipotle corn salsa. Hubby asked that I keep this on the menu all summer!

Made tis moments before dinner. Added tomatoes to salsa, some not-called-for celery, parsley instead of cilantro (not on hand), etc. Still, superb. Expect it to be better tomorrow! Oh, added a couple of shakes of Worcestershire Sauce, which gave it a deeper taste without being a recognizable flavor.

Wonderful recipe! I would rated this even higher than this Andalucian specialty that I enjoyed in Southern Spain. I prefer the course puree to the completely smooth texture.

This is a solid recipe that's flexible enough for you to tailor it to your own tastes but delicious even if you just simply follow the instructions.

This gazpacho is amazing -- delicious, easy, and authentic. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used spicy V-8 instead of tomato juice and tobasco, and the results were great.

My husband loves gazpacho, I never really cared for it except this one! I used 2 cans of tomato juice with about 8 large fresh tomatoes, and since we both love garlic instead of regular salsa we added garlic roasted salsa, the kids even like it. What a great summertime meal

I've had this soup in Spain, and found this to be as good as anything I had while there. I used a blender but did not mind having the vegetables blended, since that was how I had it while in Spain.

Delicious. Used the red wine vinegar as specified and Paul Newman's mild salsa. Extremely easy to make and everyone enjoyed it. Not a drop of left-overs. I served 9 adults and it was about 1.5 ladles per bowl. Garnished with diced avacado and the croutons. Presentation was enjoyed.

Great!! Have made this several times. Would add a lot of fresh ground pepper and tabasco

I just got back from 2 weeks in southern spain and was craving gazpacho. This is good, but next time I will cut back on the cumin. Real Spainsh Gazpacho has "bits" to sprinkle on top like tomato, chopped hard boiled eggs, cured ham pieces and corriander. It's fun to let guests add bits to make each person's soup a personal experience.

This is very good. My husband and college-age son really liked it. So easy too! Instead of using 2 red bell peppers, I used one red and one green. Also, I added an extra tablespoon of red-wine vinegar. Overall, this gazpacho is quite good.

Maybe it's not a perfectly authentic version of gazpacho, but it tasted close enough to the stuff I had in Sevilla. Delicious. I did not use the chicken broth (the taste of cold chicken broth just didn't sound good to me) and I didn't add cilantro (they were out at the market and I was anxious to try this). It was delicious nevertheless. For a spring/summer get-together, it would be great to puree this and put it in martini glasses as a festive starter.

We recently visited Spain & discovered the joy of gazpacho. Was looking for a close match to ours in Anadalusia. This is it! The finely chopped veggies & a bit extra croutons made it perfectly Spanish. HALLELUJAH! It is MUCHO better the 2nd day, beware! Also a dollop of sour cream is wonderful albit not Spanish.

This was very good. I used a blender so it was completely pureed, which I regret. It was better the next day and I stirred in some extra croutons...who knew croutons in gazpacho were so delicious?

Excellent! Perfect summer dish. I took the previous advice and used the spicy V-8 and omitted the tabasco. Another good suggestion was to mix the liquids first and the veggies last so they don't get to fine. Yum.

Wonderful - served it at a luncheon and everyone took the recipe.

Loved it - the red bell peppers are a must-ve in all Gazpachos for me from here on out. I would cut down on the garlic, though, since I feel like it was really overpowering to the other flavors. Really spicy and awesome, but really spicy with a bit less garlic would be better next time. (I've been bringing this to the office and I think people are starting to avoid me after lunch. Yeah, less garlic would be good. :) )

I love this recipe! I made it about 10 times this past summer. As suggested by others, I used Spicy V8 and skipped the hot sauce. Yum!

Big hit at my July 4th picnic. I too used spicy V8, and also added a couple of tablespoons of fresh lime juice. Yummy.

Very yummy. As suggested by others, I increased the amount of cilantro and used spicy V-8. I also added a tad more cumin, lots of tabasco, and a few hot pepper seeds (we like it spicy). My husband loved it and keeps asking for more! A great summer dish!

I made this recipe for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was a smash! I used spicy V-8 juice instead of tomato juice and added a little more than a cup of cilantro and did NOT use low salt broth. Next time I may add some fresh corn. We order gazpacho everywhere we go and this was the best we've ever had.

I served this to guests last night and it was a big hit! My husband said he is looking forward to eating this all summer. I made a few changes: used V8 instead of plain tomato juice; used medium salsa; added celery and a seeded jalapeno and skipped the hot sauce; blended all non-veg ingredients first then added the veggies to the blender and pulsed briefly. I chilled it for about 6 hours before serving. Next time I might add some grilled shrimp for a garnish. Delicious and easy - my kind of recipe.

I loved this gazpacho. I opted to omit the ground croutons from the mix and instead mixed them in for each serving. This is the perfect summer lunch.

This gazpacho recipe is probably the best I've ever had! Although I added some chopped green chiles, extra garlic, celery & a jalapeno to the recipe since I like my gazpacho with some kick! If you want to make it very lo-cal (ie. for Weight Watchers) 86 the olive oil (you won't notice it!) and add a dollop of fat free sour cream on top before you serve it!!! YUMMY!!! A+++

My favorite gazpacho ever. I used hot salsa, not the mild and I omitted the Tabasco.

I adore gazpacho, and this one is pretty good. I suggest adding other veggies (such as radishes) and belding all non-veggie ingredients first. Then, add diced veggies last on a very coarse blender setting. I garnished with a "flower" dollup of sour cream with a sprig of cilantro
