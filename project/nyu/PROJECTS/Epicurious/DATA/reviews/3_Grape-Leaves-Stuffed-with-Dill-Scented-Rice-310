It seems it has been a few years since a review has been made for this recipe. I used chick peas and fresh parsley from my garden which was fab. I used crushed red pepper too, The lemon and dill combo makes this recipe. I suggest a bit of a sauce over the grape leaves while they are simmering.

I made the filling on its own as a risotto style accompaniment to go with seared fresh tuna steaks. With some wild rice mixed in with american long grain, I carried on cooking the rice in the pan, gradually adding the liquor risotto-style until the rice was cooked and creamy. The lemon and dill flavours were just perfect with the fish, and the moistness meant that there was no need for a sauce beside a little extra lemon juice and butter drizzled over the top. I look forward to stuffing some leaves next time!!

I made this two nights ago. I added mint (dried) and currants, like the last reviewer suggested, but, rather than feta, I added some lightly toasted pine nuts. I also used a lot more parsley and dill than called for. I don't know exactly how much - probably about 1/3 cup each. It all came out very tasty indeed. Next time, however, I'll reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup. I should also add that I used a bit more than a 16 oz jar of grape leaves and that the leaves in my jars were all small. I couldn't put a scant 1/4 cup filling in even the largest of these. I probably ended up with about 40. Do the leaves get bigger as the jars get bigger?

I tried this recipe, then found another I really like: it adds feta, mint and currants to the filling. That's what this one is missing!

We usually stuff the grape leaves with the rice mix raw. You are suppossed to add tomatoes and ground beef in the rice mix. Allspice and salt and pepper are also necessary. It cooks fine when the rice mix is raw, add a little bit of olive oil in the rice mix to stay tender. Chop some tomatoes and throw them at the bottom of the pan for a great tasting stewed tomatoes.

I really liked this, but had a terrible time rolling the leaves and getting them tight enough. I would also suggest adding something (I'm not sure what) to the filling. It lacked something. Otherwise I thought they were great.

Very good...I made a few changes..used only one onion,omitted the dill and added 1 1/2 t ground cumin & 2 t oregano, also I had to add about 1/2 c more water to the rice mixture....they taste just like the ones my Greek neighbors used to serve.

I have made this recipe several times and have always had great success. It is surprisingly easy! As a meal I have served it topped with a light tomato sauce with feta cheese and black olives.

Great receipe, but cut the cooking time in the water down and make sure you use a REALLY heavy plate/other to hold down the rolled grape leaves. They float and the rice spills out.

I love this recipe it came out perfect the first time i made them. it has a delicate taste yet its not at all bland. I even cut back on the oil the and they came out fine.
