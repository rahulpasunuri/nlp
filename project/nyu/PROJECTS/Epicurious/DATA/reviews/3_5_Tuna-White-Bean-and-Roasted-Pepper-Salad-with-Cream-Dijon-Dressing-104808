Great. I cooked the beans from dried, because I enjoy making things more complicated and time-consuming than is strictly necessary, and also added some little boiled potatoes and chopped basil. The dressing is pretty awesome for many purposes, including on plain old green salad. This recipe is good and you should make it.

This is very flavorful. I've made it twice: once just as written and the second time I omitted the tuna, baby greens and olives, but served the beans over a bed of baby greens and made tuna-patties and served them along side the beans and garnished with whole olives. (Basically the same ingredients, just deconstructed a bit.)

Great light dinner to make from pantry staples and a few fresh ingredients. Used canned salmon instead of tuna and fresh red peppers instead of jarred. Served with warm pita bread and sauvignon blanc. Will definitely put this into heavy rotation for those last minute family meals.

Pretty good, very simple to put together. I nixed the olives, added parsley, and stuffed the greens and the rest into a pita. A light but filling lunch or summer dinner in about 15 minutes.

A whole lot of flavor with very little effort. I stuffed it into whole wheat pita and called it a healthy lunch.

it was ok..followed the recipe almost exactly, but added parsley and served over baby spinach. Beautiful colors.

Wonderful combination of flavors! Light, yet filling! I did not have white beans so I used light red kidney beans instead. I decided to omit the olives and salt because the salad seemed salty enough from the beans and roasted red peppers. I will definitely be making this salad again and again!

This was a fantastic salad with a great combination of flavors, and got rave reviews from my husband. I'm sure I'll make it regularly over the summer. I just made a couple of minor changes, otherwise the recipe was fine as written... used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and added about 1/2 tsp of honey to the dressing.

This was great, and just what I needed after arriving home from driving 3000 miles in 2 weeks and not cooking. Very flavorful and easy-and a chance to use all the lettuce waiting in the garden. Didn't have kalamatas or red onion; used white onion and it was good.

Good, quick meal. I substituted black beans for the white and white basalmic vinegar for the wine vinegar. It was enjoyed by all..especially me as I didn't have to spend but 15 minutes in the kitchen!

Great fall salad. I made a light aoli instead of the dijon dressing. Everyone was amazed how good "beans & tuna" could be. Great for impressing world travelers. I used small coffee cup as a mold, which made for a great presentation.

I made this for my teenage daughters. No leftovers! And it works for Atkins Dieters. Excellent dressing and will make again using whatever fresh veggies are on hand.

If you think this recipe is good as is, try it with fresh tuna and roast your own red pepper. I seared a thick piece of tuna that I had in the freezer, using only salt and pepper to season, then sliced it thin and placed on top of the salad. I had a red pepper but not bottled ones so just roasted it. This is a fabulous hot-night meal. Toasted some Alteri's bread and we were off and running!

This was really tasty and so easy! I left out the greens and instead made it more of a tuna salad- just mixed all the other ingredients together. I used garbanzo beans as opposed to the white beans (just my preference) and upped the red pepper and red onion. I stuffed the salad in pitas and it was great...and filling.

Good but not fabulous. Most of these staples are in everyone's pantry - so a good salad to make when in a rush and you don't have anything else available for weeknight dinner. With a couple of bags of organic mixed baby greens, took all of ten minutes to throw together.

Quick, easy, tasty--what more could you want? Excellent weeknight dinner and ages well in the fridge.

Great salad! I have made this salad several times. It is a great whole meal salad. The combination of ingredients is wonderful and it is SOOOO easy to make, no cooking involved,just open cans and go. I am not usually a fan of canned tuna, but it works just great in this salad. I have also used left-over tuna steaks which works fine too. This is a tasty, pretty, filling, and easy recipe, so I gave it a 4. I'll take as many recipes like this as I can find!

I made this dish for a party & placed the ingredients on top of a bed of baby greens on a nice platter. It was good when eaten the same day, but the dressing lost all its "kick" when eaten as leftovers the next. Adding more dijon took care of that minor problem.

Very light and tasty salad - perfect for a warm spring night. Reminded me of a salad nicoise.

I gambled on this recipe the first time I read it and chanced serving it to guests for dinner. It turned out perfect and not a thing about it would I change. Thank you so much!

Delicious and light. Great lunch. I left out the mayo and mixed a little of the dressing in with the tuna before adding it to the salad. The textures blend wonderfully. I will add this to my work luch box repitoire.
