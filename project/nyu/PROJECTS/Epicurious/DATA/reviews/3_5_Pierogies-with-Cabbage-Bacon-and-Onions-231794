Was really good, My picky 7 year old daughter even ate it. I got cabbage in my CSA box & was trying to decided what to make with it. I halved the Recipe since it was only 2.5 people eating.

This was an amazing weeknight meal. Perfect for a snowy, cold night. I substituted chicken broth for the water, otherwise made it to the letter. It was gobbled up by kids and adults. Yum!

This was a hit at our house. Quick and easy. Good for a weekday meal.

I made this last nite to try to make a dent in the supply of savoy cabbage I got in my csa box (hey, if you're not involved in a community supported agriculture program, think about it - it's great!). The dish was tasty, a titch salty tho. I wouldn't make it again, but only because I have such a huge collection of recipes I want to try that I only "remake" stuff that is mindblowingly delicious.

The dressing for this is fine. But how can you call this a pierogie recipe when the main ingredient is prepared and frozen? This is silly.

This recipe was very good. You could probably add some spices to liven it up, but it is great as is. C'mon, bacon, sour cream, pierogies? What's not to love?!

this was a fantastic, simple, and hearty meal. i added some julienne carrots with the cabbage and used plain old cabbage instead of the savoy which was still tasty. at the very end of cooking the cabbage, i added a couple of tablespoons of butter to brown it and add a little richness. instead of the sour cream, a good greek yogurt such as fage is still rich and creamy but more healthful. this is a definite keeper!

I really enjoyed this dish. I added a few dashes of tabasco right before I served it. Next time, I'll try butter instead of olive oil. Other than that, great dish for brunch or dinner.

My kids like pierogies, so this is an easy weekday dish with good flavor.

The frozen pierogies I found at the grocer were only so-so - and that dragged down the overall quality of the meal. Simple and quick to make otherwise. Might try it again.
