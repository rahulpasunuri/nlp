New favorite spicing for pork! Yes, the juniper berries make a difference so try and find them if you can. We found ours at a Latin grocery.

Super, duper easy and delicious! I used a pork tenderloin instead and ground the pepper in my Cuisanart. It took forever and was horrifically loud but my arm got a bit tired after attempting to grind it by hand. How's that for lazy? I was terrified of the amount of salt required but the end result was fantastic. Highly, highly recommend this recipe!

This roast recipe was outstanding! I made this last night and the flavor of the meat was so delicious, not too salty and very moist. I did omit the juniper berries as I could not find them at the store. It still was extremely flavorful. Followed the recipe except for the berries and I used an oven probe. Took it out at 160 and let it sit for 15 mins before slicing. Will definetly make this again.

really cannot believe how much time this took. Does everyone have an electric spice grinder because I got quite a workout grinding pepper, allspice, fennel and juniper berries. Then it took an hour longer to cook than the recipe stated. Not worth the work

Delicious! I was very skeptical about all that salt, but it really flakes off and the pork absorbs all those delicious spices. Definitely making this one again!

Oh my goodness! This was fantastic. We served it for a dinner party on New Year's Eve and everyone raved and raved about it. We were skeptical about the amount of salt, but it worked perfect. Our only warning is that it takes longer to cook than the time indicated in recipe. The flavors are delicious and the aroma is unbelievable as it cooks. Definitely will be one of our favorite recipes.

We loved this recipe and are doing it again for New Year's Day! I had a little trouble getting the salt mixture to "stick", but for the most part the roast was covered. My husband cooked it in his smoker (with no smoke) and the guys were drooling over it.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was very easy to prepare and tasted wonderful. 2 guests were not huge fennel fans, but those that were raved that it was the best. Make sure to scrape off as much of the salt crust as possible. It did take longer to cook than listed, but my roast was over 6 pounds. Worth the wait. Leftovers make great sandwiches.

If this could have been easier, I don't know how. Followed it to the letter - it was absolutely perfect. Tender, moist, flavorful, beautiful presentation, easy cleanup, and very aromatic during cooking. Complete winner.

This was great! I haven't done any salt-packed recipes before and so was a bit dubious of the 8 cups -- but followed the recipe and it was great. I saved some of the extra salt to use on other meals after it was roasted. Smells wonderful, holds the moisture in the roast, and tastes fantastic. Also very easy.

I would like to note that the following review is from a collection of six adults... First, we were surprised by the over-abundance of salt required for this recipe. We elected to use 5 cups (a single box) of kosher salt, which seemed to suit the 5+ lb. roast. We also used half the quantity of juniper berries and all-spice (because we only had that amount), but the seasoning seemed well-balanced. The cooking time ran a bit over the 2 1/2 hours... but the end result was FABULOUS! The meat was moist, tender, and very flavorful. We plan to make it again... possibly next year pre-Thanksgiving or for a Christmas meal.

Excellent flavor. This is a special treat. While it does have a long cooking time, it is easy to prepare and the slow cooking process is worth the end result. I cooked to an internal temperature of 153, then let it rest...the temperature increases to 160 after resting. Cooking this more would make it just too well done and probably dry it out (in our opinion).
