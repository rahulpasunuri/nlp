I made the dressing exactly as written and it had WAY too much garlic. I had to add a lot more anchovies and buttermilk to counteract all the garlic. I would recommend 1/2 the garlic and twice the anchovies.

Made this for my very picky elderly mother-in-law (but didn't tell her how much mayonnaise was in the dressing, she's fat phobic but one could definitely get the same results with low-fat mayo) and she just about swooned. The dressing is so delicious and it didn't overpower the dungeness crab I used, just complimented it very nicely. I used the leftover dressing to make a farro salad the next night, combining it with fresh vegetables and it was a huge hit as well. Definitely making again.

Made with shrimp instead of crab, added some scallion, and used 2 anchovy fillets (I like anchovy, but I think the full amount would have overpowered the seafood). This was really light and delicious. I will definitely make again as a seafood salad and also just make the dressing if I happen to have buttermilk around.

I only made the dressing because I don't care for bottled Caesar Dressing. It was such a VERY good and tasty salad that I will build the entire salad. I didn't use the Worcestershire Sauce because my husband has a "delicate" mouth and the garlic was hot enough for him.

I made this for a Valentine's Day lunch for my mother-in-law and she loved it (she is also an exceptional cook). I used reduced fat buttermilk, no achovies and used store bought croutons. Would most definately make this again. Very easy to throw togther but because of the crab it makes a big impact. Making just the cesear salad again tonight and will try low fat mayo and will also try to find some anchovy paste or oil that others suggested.

I made this as part of a Mother's Day brunch. I had never made a Caesar dressing before, but now I will never use the stuff in the bottle again! My family loves crab meat so they were thrilled to see that instead of chicken. I used a mix of arugula, mache, raddichio, and romaine for the greens, fresh shredded parm, and store bought garlic croutons. There were 8 people eating it and no leftovers. I will def. make this again!

I won't rate the whole recipe, since I didn't make the crab salad, but the dressing is definitely 3 forks! Very yummy, creamy, and quick! Next time I will try with low-fat mayo to cut calories (hopefully it won't ruin the taste!) but as is, delish. Used anchovy paste instead of whole anchovies.

my opinion is look elsewhere for a recipe to use with crabmeat

This is an amazing dressing! Simple, yet full of flavour. I tossed the dressing on cooked, small red potatoes for an quick potato salad. Truly good!

I just used the dressing recipe for a regular ceaser salad. I used a bit more garlic and low fat mayo. I also soaked the anchovies in milk for about an hour. I didn't mix the parmesan in the dressing. I sprinkled it on the salad separately. It is the best ceaser salad I have ever had! And low fat too.

I usually make a lemon caesar salad dressing with no egg that my family loves, but this creamy version was a hit. I used a little of the anchovy oil in the mix and a little olive oil to reduce the mayo. It was great on a chicken, jack cheese,tomato, black olive romaine salad the next day. I'm sure crab is good in the mix, but the recipe is great as a side without. The croutons are a little greasy. I suggest brushing the bread with garlic oil, cutting in 1" cubes and toasting in oven at 250 - 275 for 30 min to 1 hour.

This was one of the most delicious salads I have eaten this summer. I used the tip from a previous review, and used 1/2 the mayo and doubled the buttermmilk. I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies, and purchased bakery croutons instead of making my own. Absolutely delicious!

Using a bit less garlic and a couple more anchovy fillets this was a great Caesar salad dressing on romaine, croutons and tomatoes

Wow! What a dressing!! Used it to make Chicken Caesar Wraps and it was a hit for a huge party we had. Everyone asked for the recipe and for leftovers... It's definitely going into my personal favorites!

I made the dressing only, with a salad of romaine, watercress, fennel, radicchio and Belgian endives and served it to an anchovy hater, with excellent response. I reduced the garlic, used less mayo (home made) and doubled the buttermilk. This made for a tangy, fairly low cal dressing that kept well in the fridge. Will make this again and again.

This recipe was delicious. I more than doubled crab, used very large garlic cloves, doubled anchovy and omitted croutons. Served at dinner party and got rave reviews.

The buttermilk salad dressing recipe was good, but it overpowered the dungeness crab. It was a waste of expensive crabmeat. If I make the dressing again, it will be for a regular salad.
