Great recipe. If you like buttermilk biscuits this is the one. FYI to the inexperienced: make sure your baking powder is not beyond it's expiration date or the biscuits may not rise. Remember to shake the buttermilk well otherwise you get a bland tasting biscuit.

I used oil instead of butter and substituted cream of tarter and rice milk for the buttermilk and they turned out beautiful. I now make biscuits on a regular basis.

With this recipe the biscuits rise if you knead the dough enough. They turn out buttery and delicious. I now make biscuits regularly.

these were ok but they didnt rise very much. My kids loved them.

I made this with a few substitutions (I had only 1 cup buttermilk on hand, so added regular milk + a bit of lemon to make up the full liquid, and used all butter)and ended up with a very slack dough. However, I added a tbsp or two of flour on the kneeding, and it turned out very nicely. I think because of this they didn't rise as high as they could have, but are still very yummy. I was also worried that I overdid the kneeding, but the biscuits were still very tender and fluffy. Will definately make again.

Used them on top of Chicken Pot Pie. Worked great.

I also used all butter and these biscuits were lovely! Earlier in the day I had attemped a Martha Stewart recipe for buttermilk biscuits and they were terrible. So I was really hoping for good results here and got them! YUM. Will make again.

This is my standard. I use all butter and often add 3/4 cup of sharp cheddar a tsp+ of herbs de provence and top dress with sesame seeds.

Real high-risers! Love the color added by the egg wash. Made this morning to re-heat for dinner but couldn't resist sampling the "runt" made from final scraps. Very nice! Looking forward to having them with the entire "comfort food" menu.

I love buttermilk, so this recipe fit the bill! They were nice and fluffy. Will replace this recipe with my old standard.
