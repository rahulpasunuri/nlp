a bit time consuming but otherwise worth it! Don't worry about the pistachios, they are good for you! They healthy fats in pistachios help to build and restore muscles! Have you tried ARO Pistachios??? www.orandiranch.com, they use Himalayan Pinksalt, man oh man are they GOOD!!!!

Over the top fantastic. Good for a really special occasion, especially as a lot of it is done in advance. Made a vegetarian version for my mom by simmering a lot of dried kelp in water for a long time instead of mixing dashi powder with water. (Dashi is just kelp and bonito) Couldn't find jerusalem artichokes but a mild turnip worked well as a substitute. It was super time consuming for me to get the skins off the pistachio--it helped to put them in a little bowl of water and kind of scrub at them individually with one's fingers. Then one could pick out the skins, many of which float to the top of the water. I also couldn't find shelled pistachios the first time I made this, so it sort of sucked to have to shell enough to make even a half cup, for 4 people. I've now found shelled ones at trader joe's, and they look like the skins might even come off them more easily, so I will make this again. Some of the ingredients may sound hard to find, but if you're in LA, they're all available and dirt cheap at the larger Korean supermarkets. (including the dried kelp if you want to try the veggie substitution)

Very good. Subtle Japanese flavours, great presentation, healthy and can be served to vegetarians (I simmered the pistachios seperately for them, as I did not want to miss on the great dashi flavors for the non-veg). I used fresh artichoke hearts instead of the jerusalem artichoke. A beautiful, true gourmet dish.
