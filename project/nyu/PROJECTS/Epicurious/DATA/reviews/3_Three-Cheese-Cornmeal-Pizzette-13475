Because the dough does not rise, the recipe is easy to make. The dough is very versatile. I make pesto pizza for the kids with this, which they love. I left some of it in my refrigerator for 2 days, then rolled out, topped it with olive oil, rosemary, and salt and threw it on the grill. It was perfect. Any way that you top it, be sure to get the texture of the dough right. It should be a little sticky before you knead it but not too gooey. It shouldn't be at all dry. Instead, it should be soft and elastic. Roll it thin and it will cook better.

I love this recipe! So easy, so good. The crust is outstanding. I've made it just as the recipe instructs, but found that it was a bit dry. This time I used just a little leftover basic pasta sauce, and (because we love out breakfast meats) I omitted the gorgonzola substituted chevre, and added fresh oregano and... peppered bacon... mmmm bacon. It was good.

This thin crust pizza was very easy to make. The dough recipe is doubled so you can freeze all the fixings for a fast meal out of the freezer. My family loved it. I added some herbs for extra flavor.
