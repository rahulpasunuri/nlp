This was a wonderful recipe. Very nice and mellow. The next time I make it I think I'll leave out the chopped mint leaves at the end, but a mint-julep connoisseur friend liked them.

Leave out the bourbon?!?!?!?!? Its the KY derby, not some frenchy bike race.

Delicious! The creme de menthe was a bit strong-- next time I might try substituting bourbon for it and adding a little more spearmint to make up for the lost mintiness. But don't get me wrong, this recipe is pretty darn good as-is. Has a good consistency even after a couple weeks in the freezer, too, which is nice.
