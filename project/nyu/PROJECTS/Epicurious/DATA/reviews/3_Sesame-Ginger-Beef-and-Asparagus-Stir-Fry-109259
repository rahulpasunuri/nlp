The reviews were helpful. Used a lesser cut of beef (top round) and only used sesame oil. Probably added a little too much ginger, but still liked the result. Bottom line: adding minced garlic and [more] ginger, plus dressing the meat with salt/pepper and and adding toasted sesame seeds at the end can make this a keeper. Served it over brown rice.

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this. I used only sesame oil to fry the meat & veggies, separately. I added red pepper strips, too. I made a beef broth, using far more ginger, adding garlic & soy sauce, too, as suggested. At the end, toasted sesame seeds. It truly tasted like ginger-sesame & turned out quite tasty.

Followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the ginger and garlic. The meat and veggies were cooked perfectly, but the sauce did not taste very good at all. Adding some soy sauce helped, but not enough. Will find another recipe.

Very easy to prepare, perfect for a weeknight meal. I used lean pre-cut "stir fry" meat from the market to save even more time. I would make this again. The family loved it too.

very flavorful and easy to prepare. I will make it many more times

I completely agree with (and appreciate) everyone who said adding various ingredients helps. I added a splash of soy sauce while cooking, two minced cloves of garlic, and some extra sesame oil, and it was really great despite my forgetting to buy ginger for the recipe. The asparagus also needs much longer than 2min to become tender, but you'd probably figure this out on your own. Use about twice the cornstarch, too.

This was terribly bland made as directed. After adding generous amounts of garlic and soy sauce, it was quite good. Without, it was totally tasteless. If I make it again, I will use more ginger, add fresh garlic, use soy sauce and sesame seeds or more sesame oil.

I don't know how anyone thought this dish was flavorful without any additions. It was about the least tasty dish I've ever made (although it did smell great). After the very first bite, both my husband and I went running for soy sauce and garlic. Once we added the soy and garlic, it was actually very good. I would make this again, but would add soy and garlic, more ginger, maybe some sesame seeds, or at least more sesame oil.

Enjoyed the crispy beef , added more ginger as suggested. Next time I will add garlic and soy sauce too.

I made this recipe exactly as written, unfortunately. Should've read the reviews first. It needs more ginger, and other reviewers' ideas about soy sauce and garlic would've helped too. This would be great with more flavor. But as is, I have to give it just 1 fork. Cucumber salad is good though.

Very good and quick... Doesn't require a whole day of chopping veg like some stir fry recipes. My sauce was a tad dry, so I added some soy sauce at the end. I also forgot to grab ginger at the store, so used about 3 tsp of the dried stuff. Served w/ sesame rice and Oriental Cucumber Salad (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=2036)

Very good, but we thought it needed more ginger, more sesame and some garlic.

This is an easy and delicious dish. Definitely serve it over rice, since it's too salty by itself. I made this again with chicken, but it wasn't nearly as good -- the fat in the beef really adds to the flavor of the sauce.

This is a very easy and quick dish to make. The sauce is absolutely delicious, and the dish as a whole is quite good, but I think something is lacking here. Next time, I will marinate the beef to make it more tender and flavorful. It might also be fun to grill the beef instead of frying for a lower fat version.
