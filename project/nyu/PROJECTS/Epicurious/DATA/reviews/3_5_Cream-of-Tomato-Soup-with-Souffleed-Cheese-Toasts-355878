I used good quality canned diced tomatoes, and that is what I think will determine the best flavor (plus decent stock vs. water). I didn't have ground clove, but crushed up two whole ones, then picked out the clove stem before adding the liquid. I think this is a simple and delicious recipe - and I used my stick blender and kept it much neater!

Very very good! Used 28oz of Contidina Roasted Garlic Tomatoes, 1/2 cup chopped sweet vidalia onion, Better than Bouillion Vegetable base to make stock and a splash of heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Grandpa and grandbabies loved it with a simple grilled cheese "sammich" on the side.

I own this cookbook and was surprised to find a recipe from it on epicurious. Tonight I made this soup and we all thought it was delicious. Based on other reviews I added one additional can of tomatoes and found no need for additional tomato paste. There was plenty of tomato flavor. I used homemade chicken stock and whole milk also. I did not make the cheese toast, only because I served a different cheese bread with it. Not sure why the hostile reviews, it was simple and really good. By the way, I've made about half a dozen soups from this cookbook and they've all been fabulous, (this tomato soup is a bit basic compared to the other recipes I've tried from this book). Her tomato and chickpea soup with quinoa is out of this world, as is the leek and celeriac soup with apple. If you like soups I highly recommend this book.

Just finished making the recipe from canned tomatoes and it has no tomato flavor. Next time I will try using fresh tomatos.

Excellent. And super easy. The person who made this and thought it was awful probably made a mistake; I followed the directions to the letter, and it was a fabulous soup. I didn't even have to add tomato paste; I did use top-of-the-line diced tomatoes in sauce, as suggested.

I used tomatoes from my garden that I processed through a food grinder, and the soup had a really bright, fresh taste. I used cream instead of milk, fennel instead of basil, and and added some meatballs to the bowl, which made it heartier.

This recipe was terrible. The cheese toasts were great - hence the 1 star. The soup was really bad. I followed the recipe exactly and found it very un-tomato-y. My husband and I each had a bowl and agreed that it wasn't worth saving the rest. Totally bummed because it sounded so good and in general I find the recipes on epicurious delicious.

This is a perfect combination for a cold winter's night. The soup was the perfect texture and the cheese toast was the perfect compliment to the soup. We used a good crusty sourdough bread; the softer doughy inside held up better as the cheese toast took about 10 minutes to rise and brown (our oven doesn't seal properly, so our over times always take longer). Our soup ended up having a nice kick to it- we left out the cloves, but didn't add any extra pepper, so we're not really sure where the pepper-like heat came from. In all, a hearty winter dinner.

This recipe is very nice. The soup is a rather basic tomato soup, hence the 3 forks, but the souffled cheese toasts are superlative. I made mine on some left-over grocery store italian bread. I highly recommend this recipe!
