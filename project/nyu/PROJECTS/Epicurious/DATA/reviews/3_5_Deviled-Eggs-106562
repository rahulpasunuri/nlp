This is a really good basic recipe. I made this for Easter dinner because so many folks are so specific about what they like or don't like in hard boiled eggs that it's just better to go simple. These did the trick. I did "up" the style a bit with smoked paprika as garnish, but other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. I personally missed the pickle, but I think I was the only one :)

Good basic deviled egg recipe which can be left as-is or tinkered with (as many reviewers have done). Peeling my eggs was soooo painful but otherwise the recipe is simple and satisfying.

This was essentially how I remember deviled eggs being. I, too, used smoked paprika and it added a great flavor!

Using smoked paprika is KEY. Everyone loved these and they were gone in like 20 minutes.

this is a good basic recipe for making deviled eggs. you only need to make it once (or twice) before mastering it and getting adventurous. i like mine with a little less mayo, a little more mustard, horseradish and topped with caviar. but that's the lovely thing about this recipe. it gives you the basics on which to grow.

I made these for a Halloween party and they were a hit. I didn't have dijon mustard (shocking, I know) so I used a Spicy Brown mustard. I garnished with smoked paprika and that made all the difference in the world. Will make these for many parties to come.

Simple, easy, and delicious. I made a triple recipe for a party and couldn't believe how good these were. Several people asked for the recipe and I'll definitely be making this again and again!

Sadly, I didn't get to try any of these at the luncheon I made them for, but I have to take their quick disappearance as a good sign. Everyone raved about them.

Simple and delicious. In a pinch you can pipe the filling from a ziplock bag, cutting a corner open.

Good standard recipe for deviled eggs. It was easy to make and I'll be serving these many more times in the future.

This is a great basic recipe. I was feeling adventurous and made them with homemde mayo. This is great for those who find regular mayo too bland...you can kick up the mayo any way you lik. I also made a few of them with wasabi powder. Very tasty.

Great recipe and very simple. I used a dijon mustard with horseradish in it already and I also added a tiny dash of chili powder. It all had a nice kick!

Used horseradish mustard instead of dijon and used smoked paprika as garnish. YUM!

Great deviled eggs. The only extra thing I added was horseradish, but I think it would have been good even without it. Just how I remember deviled eggs tasted like when I was a kid.

This was a very nice basic recipe to follow. It allows one to add ingrediants to your taste. I used chopped chives and some horseradish. My guest loved them, and they disappeared quite quickly. This is a keeper recipe.

I love deviled eggs. My favorite recipe is from the Joy of Cooking. This one is okay, but I add a tsp of vinegar and salt and pepper to taste, instead of cayanne. Which is pretty much the recipie from tJoC.

add horseradish. yum

I thought this dish was very easy and simple to make. But...the 5 minutes its says to leave the eggs was just not long enough. I would say put them in the fridge and let them cool for an hour then try removing the egg shell. Other then that it was good. I put double the pepper it called for and it was a rave!

The recipe is good, but 5 minutes in ice water is not long enough to yield an easy peel. It takes 10 minutes or more, with plenty of ice.

A very simple, almost "retro" kind of appetizer -- made it for my last party and it pretty much went. For the mustard part, I used 1/2 Dijon and 1/2 dry (the dry mustard packs a nice kick). And paprika is a "must" -- also dresses up the plate a bit. Ditto for the chives.

This is a great basic recipe if you can't find your grandmother's. For those of you who will read all the earlier reviews, I had to set the record straight one thing. Miracle Whip is not a "southern" addition. The authentic southern ingredient would be Duke's Mayonnaise. Miracle Whip was introduced during the Depression and may have been cheaper - but it's use was not indication of race, but of poverty.

I doubled the recipe and made these for a party. I used the basic recipe but split them into 4 groups and finished them with 4 different toppings. The four I used were capers, Old Bay (a suggestion from another review), Paprika, and dill. They were all great and made a terrific presentation.

Rating: 4
Brava! for simple food. Without complication or angst over presentation, there's a feeling of freedom to shamelessly prepare a comfort food that doesn't require hurculean effort, intense attention to detailed direction or a trip to the gourmet market for some exotic ingredient.

Was just browsing for a deviled egg recipe for a Lacrosse team dinner... who knew deviled eggs could be so controversial?! The kids liked them...

Great recipe! To A Cook from Denver who likes to correct other people's spelling, "aoli garic" doesn't mean anything but "aioli garlic" does. My main beef with this recipe is that it doesn't mention putting paprika on the egg at the end, which is mandatory.

I made two modifications to enhance an already good recipe: Add a teaspoon of honey mustard for a slight sweet "mystery" flavor; substitute 2-dashes hot pepper sauce (or equivalent hot sauce) instead of cayenne pepper for smoother and more even combining.

I, too, decreased the mayo and increased the mustard. Sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning for color and flavor. Everyone I've served them to has loved them. Quick and easy for almost any occaision.

Nothing like a simple mainstay recipe to make the regional factions fractious, hey? For the "sophisticated and distinguished" cook in Ohio: It's "palate", if you're talking about something you taste with. A "pallet" is something you sleep on. This is a good basic recipe, easily adaptable. If you're looking for a new spin on an old favorite, try the curried deviled eggs recipe on this site. I added a splash of apple cider vinegar, reduced the mayo, and increased the mustard. I happened to have a jar of aoli garic mustard sauce, so I used that. Turned out very tasty.

Thank god for the other reviewers who knew these are NOT "deviled" eggs. These are mayonnaised eggs! There may not a thing wrong with these eggs if you like bland and mild; and if so, this is probably a good recipe. It is not, however, "deviled."

Rating: 3
A great basic recipe! I'm always looking for simple basic recipes that students in my classes, kids or adults, that can be easily made. When recipes are simple, the students can adjust to their personal tastebuds. It teaches them to try a few with capers and to experiment with different paprikas.

Good basic recipe. Nothing fancy. Will make again for guests who prefer plain-tasting food but will make another version with more zing for others who prefer more flavor.

Would make it again, but the family would insist on gramma's additions: relish and mayo. (1920's style)and she didn't use Dijon. Personally, I eat 'em any way I get 'em. First, I have to try the different paprikas! Cobeen

From Epicurious Dictionary: To combine a food with various hot or spicy seasonings such as red pepper, mustard or TABASCO sauce, thereby creating a "deviled" dish.

Thanks for a great basic recipe. To "Devil" something means to highly spice OR shred or grind so both reviewers are correct. :-) I like mine with a few capers on top.

I thought it was great to snack on with the rest of the fam. I dont care for mayo or miracle whip either, but not enough to rip on poor white people from the south (see above). Lets please not identify types of mayo racially? After all, it was the too-good-for-anyone-else French who invented the stuff. peace

This dish was very good but I think it could have had more flavor.

I suppose if you want that 1950s feel, you could use sweet relish and Miracle Whip (way too sweet for me), but I prefer mayonnaise and paprika, as they make the yolks extra tangy. BTW, to the person who thought "deviled" referred to spicing the eggs, that is incorrect. To devil something just means to process it, like the yolks in this recipe, or like deviled ham (shudder). This is the most authentic recipe on the site--try it, you'll like it!

This is a great recipe for deviled eggs! I added a small amount of very finely chopped chives to the egg mixture. They "disappeared" before I could blink!

Look, this was a great basic recipe for deviled eggs. I visit this site to get helpful imput from fellow "chefs", not to read bickering about mayo vs. miracle whip. Everyone has their own opinion, and the snide comments should be left to yourself.

La! I see northern snobbery raising its ugly head. Miracle Whip is not a product solely for use by poor southern white trash folk. Mayo (which I find to be greasy & disgusting) is no better than Miracle Whip and just because you prefer mayo does not mean your palate is more discriminating. If you want real "deviled" (meaning highly spiced) eggs, you would use the more highly flavored Miracle Whip and more mustard.

These were great as written. Miracle Whip? Ick. The eggs were perfectly cooked with this method--no grey around the yolks!

Just realized that I said I added about two tablespoons of chopped green onion, but didn't mention that I had doubled the recipe too. That much onion would overwhelm a single batch. :-)

For slightly more "devilish" eggs, swirl in a bit of honey and several generous drops of hot sauce, such as Tabasco or Sriracha.

If you want a recipe for deviled eggs that is as close to delicious as deviled eggs get ..then this is for you. The review from Kentucky is far to down home for my taste - miracle whip? no thanks. A sophisticated egg for a more distinguished pallet

These were delicious! I did (as always) spice them up a bit. I used a little more cayenne & a tad more mustard... also a dash of tobasco. I took these to a cook-out a couple weeks ago - they all disappeared, quickly! I always use Miracle Whip vs Mayo! This will be my one & only deviled egg recipe from now on!!

Rating: 1
I suspect the disappearing deviled eggs that the writer referred to were not this boring! Do it the southern way and they will disappear quickly -Miracle Whip instead of mayo, a little more mustard, a couple of tablespoons of sweet pickle relish and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. You can top them with paprika, but a few finely chopped pimentos are much more appealing!
