The fish was moist and had a nice taste but overall I wasn't a huge fan. My guests liked it though. Part of my problem may have been that I used fillet instead of steaks. It is a great recipe for a beginner cook though.

Lovely simply fish recipe. I added a couple of big hand fulls of spinach to the sauce and it was great.

simple, and delicious! this will be my go-to halibut recipe for now on! i made it on a whim with all ingredients on hand-- i subbed finely chopped sweet onion for the scallion and omitted the tomato --you would never have guessed anything was missing. start to finish in under 10 minutes, and YUM!

Delicious!! Loved every bite. Only used 1/4 cup butter and had over asparagus.

Rating: 0
This recipe was phenomenal!!! I cooked the halibut way less than recipe stated (only about 1/2 way so it didn't overcook while the sauce was cooking). I increased the wine to 1/2 cup and used the juice of a whole lemon, plus some extra capers. I cut the butter in half and it probably could have been even less than that. But the sauce was so good!!!! I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. Easy to make, light, and healthy. Even my 10 year old wanted more. After reading some reviews I decided to sauté shallots (in lieu of scallions) until golden brown and somewhat carmelized; then put them aside and added at the end. There was a little left over so I had it for lunch the next day. Next time I will double the sauce recipe as well as the tomatoes. It was all so yummy....

I've made this dish so many times and it never fails me. I too use much less butter or none at all and it's still super delicious. The presentation will also wow your guests if you serve this at a dinner party. Last time I made it I used cod instead of halibut. I floured the cod before I fried it and it gave it a beautiful golden color and made it easier to handle (without it falling apart when done). I too do not seed the tomato and I see no problem with the presentation. Last time I made it I served it over asparagus instead of the haricots verts, as I had just bought some fresh from the farmer's market. Of course, I've made it many times as the recipe indicates. One of my all time favorites.

This has been one of my long time favorite recipes- I make it again and again. I usually double the wine and halve the butter, and add extra tomatoes and capers. Love it.

Loved this recipe. Relatively easy, fast, and delicious. I made it in the winter and there were no worthy tomatoes available, so I used canned diced (making it even easier), and the they were fine. I also used half the recommended butter and thought it was plenty.

Very good, and definitely worth making again!

Excellent! Just reduced the butter, upped the capers a bit, and omitted the tomatoes - my husband wolfed his down and asked for more. (He said the sauce reminded him of tartar sauce, one of his favorites that he's avoided for health reasons for years.) I will definitely make this again!

This is lovely but the second time I made it, I subbed shallots for the scallions and made the sauce in a traditional buerre blanc manner and it was divine.

I picked my first string beans from my vegetable garden, and they were fabulous. I followed the recipe as printed, except for using half the butter. It was easy and delicious. My only suggestion would be to pan fry the fish the minimal time, and then just pop it into the microwave oven for 20-30 seconds to cook it until just done in the center. This keeps the fish from overcooking on the outside.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe for a crowd, though it's not as easy as pulling out a pan from the oven and saying "ta da!" when dinner's ready since it requires some active time at the range. I cooked the fish a couple minutes more than called for, but otherwise the recipe is right on the mark. I decreased the butter to 2T as others recommended, and the sauce was light and delicious. I also used asparagus which went really well with the lemony sauce. My guests raved about the presentation and the taste and there was not a bite of fish left at the end of the evening.

We loved this. The sauce is so easy and good; it could be used with a number of different seafoods and forgiving to alterations. We used 2 filets and half the butter. It was the perfect amount of sauce.

What a great weeknight dinner! So quick and easy. I used tilapia instead of halibut, olive oil instead of canola, and only 3 tbsp of light butter instead of the whole stick. I thought that this recipe yielded just the right amount of sauce for 2 lbs of fish.

This is so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I used half the butter and it was still a very rich sauce. The sauce reduces very quickly, so I think I'd up the amount of wine and lemon next time. I love halibut and this sauce is a perfect match for it.

super yummy, super easy. having made this before and being a somewhat scatterbrained cook i like to get all my ingredients together before starting because this comes together so quickly u need to be ready. i always double the wine, decrease the butter to a bit over 2T, same w/ lemon juice; i increase the amount of capers and use 1 cup of drained canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh (i really don't think it makes a difference) i have even used dried onion in a pinch.

Almost gave four forks, just for ease. It was a terrific weeknight meal. I made it with tilapia, and did cut back a bit on the butter. My husband raved. I will certainly make it again.

My fish was a little thicker than the recipe called for and I ended up over cooking it slightly...the sauce (with 1/2 the butter) was great! I just used frozen whole green beans and steamed them, they worked great! My guests raved over it. Will definitely keep this recipe.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable sauce. Given how easy it was to make (honestly, just took a few minutes!), I was not expecting it to be so tasty. I've used many recipes from this site, but this one has to be in the top ten list. Very flavorful and surprisingly complex for the simplicity of the ingredients. Perfectly balance with the lemon. Served this with lemon sole to rave reviews.

Soooooo good. Light, easy to make, flavorful. Made this dish for non-fish eaters and won them over. Did use asparagus rather then the verts and only half the butter. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe! To the reviewer who asked about removing skin; it is MUCH easier to remove fish skin after it has been heated. Just sautee the fish for a couple minutes over medium heat, flip it over, then gently peel off the skin. Then if you want the skin side to be browned a bit, flip it back over. This is a keeper! I agree- butter can be reduced and it's still a great sauce.

Rating: 4
Woooow!!!! I tried this superbly delicious dish last night. I read quite a few of the comments to get some ideas (and followed some of them). I used grilled asparagus instead of the green beans. I left the little oil after sauteing the fish in the pan and used regular Holland House cooking wine and definitely half the butter. It looked like a gourmet meal, tasted awesome and soooooooooo easy to make. Don't wait, try it today!!

Rating: 4
Unbelievably tasty and easy recipe. I made this with haddock (I thought I had halibut when I found this recipe), replaced canola oil with olive oil, skipped the butter, and replaced it by keeping the oil in the pan (rather than pouring it off before adding the wine and lemon juice. I added a splash of the juice the capers are kept in to ramp up the salty tartness of the sauce. I seldom compliment my own cooking... but did so this time!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Definitely use less butter unless you like extremely rich sauces. Prep is even quicker if you don't peel or seed the tomato (I think that's mostly just for presentation...doesn't really affect the taste). I served it with green beans as well as sauted baby spinach, which was a great pairing.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I have a question about whether or not the fillets should have the skin removed before cooking. I removed it but thought may have made a mistake. Can anyone answer for me?

One of my favorite recipes from epicurious! I've been making it for years but wanted to add today that I made it with grilled asparagus instead of haricots verts and it turned out fabulous! Also, I don't use butter but olive oil (really good quality olive oil) and it's delicious!

This is so easy and delicious. I use half a stick of butter and it is plenty. I also sprinkle some toasted pine nuts on top. I've made this with tilapia and haddock and both are equally delicious. I make this often. It's a keeper!

I loved this recipe! It was so easy an quick to make, and the results were phenomenal! I did not use a whole stick of butter. 2 tbs did the job. Anymore and it would have been too much for my taste. I roasted 2 tomatoes in the broiler to add extra flavor since it is not tomato season and it was store bought. I added a chopped clove of garlic in the sauce after the butter went in, but before the other ingredients. I prepared two 6 oz. fillets of halibut, but made the sauce for four and it was the perfect amount. I served it with blanched asparagus because the store did not have any green beans, and a simple rice pilaf with mushrooms and onions. Definitely a keeper! I will be making this again very soon.

This is really special. Often a featured recipe doesn't turn out quite as wonderful for me as reviews indicate, but this one is fool-proof. I agree with reviewers who prepare smaller portions of halibut per person and less butter. It couldn't be better! We've had it twice in less than two weeks and I can't wait to fix it again.

Rating: 4
I would encourage everyone to try this dish as written for at least the first time. I made it yesterday and it was terrific. I had a very nice piece of Halibut and thought the whole thing devine. I got a good sear on the first side of the fish and made certain not to overcook it. If you need to impress, Alfred Portale is a fine cook who is using some pretty traditionally french techniques here. The sauce is a variation on a beurre blanc and the tomatoes are concasse'ed. The butter isn't really too bad for a special occasion, just over one TBSP per person. Try it. You'll be pleased.

Rating: 0
Definitely a winner! I decreased the butter, increased the other sauce ingredients. and added a bit of fat free half and half. I'm sure it would be great with more butter, too, but I just can't bring myself to be that decadent. The presentation is four star, too.

Rating: 4
I agree with using much less butter. It's not necessary for it to be good. I've also made this with monk fish and a variety of other veggies. Sunchokes and sauteed mushrooms work well with the green beans. I think this sauce would make almost anything taste good!

It was very good and certainly light (with less butter). I used Seabass as well and also floured it as someone else recommended. Doubled the sauce and only used 2 tbls of butter. Also used grape tomatoes cut in half.

I thought this dish was excellent. I served at for guests and everyone raved. The only thing I would alter is amount of fish, and amount of butter. It was simply too much of both. I fully agree with the suggestion to taste as you go. Start with half the amount of butter and increase for taste. Also, I happen to love tomatoes and thought you could probably double the amount and have the dish be that much tastier. But that's just a matter of personal taste. I highly recommend this dish!

This was absolutely amazing. I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the butter, and added a bit of butter to the oil when searing. I didn't have halibut so I used sea bass...the result was decadent...rich and silky wihtout being overly heavy. Definitely a keeper for dinner parties. It's so simple and quick but beautiful and delectable. Served a first course of grilled sourdough bread topped with oregano stuffed roasted tomatoes and some merlot marinated olives. Best meal we've had in a long time!

I just received a shipment of halibut cheeks from Petersburg, Alaska and was looking for a new recipe to showcase them. This was a perfect summer meal. The presentation is beautiful. The flavor is well balanced. The sauce may seem a bit overpowering upon taste, but after you pour it over the fish and beans, it blends perfectly. I am a tough "rater" and this one is really that good. Just don't overcook your fish!

Rating: 0
Wow!! This was so delicious. I have to weigh in on the wine-to-butter ratio. I doubled the wine, as suggested, and felt like it might have been a bit too much. I'll try somewhere in between next time. Used 1/4 cup butter, for me this was divinely rich; you could use even less, but I think 1 Tbsp. would have been too little for my decadent taste buds. Although I removed the fish from the skillet before it was done, the warming time in the oven cooked it just a bit longer than I would have liked. Next time I'll give the fish even less time in the skillet. As for the sauce, the tomatoes really do add something. I was a bit skeptical, and was tempted to use the sauce before the tomatoes were added--it looked so simple and golden and lovely--but the tomatoes add that one extra zing so that this becomes a sweet, tangy, and buttery sauce. (Heirloom tomatoes right now are eye-rollingly good.) Absolutely wonderful; can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I put the fish in a 300 degree oven after searing, while I made the sauce. I only used 2T of butter, which was plenty. This was a super easy recipe with a great presentation, and I would make it again for sure! YUM!

This dish is phenominal-definitely restaurant quality. I served it with steamed sugar snap peas and basmati rice. I did change the recipe, though. I used 1 TBSP. butter instead of a whole stick and it was fabulous. There was definitely enough. I also used a whole jar of capers-as we love them. I doubled the wine and used the juice of 1 small lemon. In addition, I sliced a whole clove of garlic and used minced red onion. We loved it.

I am always looking for halibut recipes and have never found one that I felt was special enough to serve guests. This is it!!! I was a little hesitant as I am not usually fond of capers, (I did end up using them). I subsituted shallots for the scallions, and asparagus for the beans. Both, excellent choices-the fish looked beautiful ontop of the asparagus. I served with red and white baby new poatoes with fresh herbs. My guests loved it and later said they don't usually like halibut!

Rating: 4
For a more healthy version, you can reduce the wine/lemon sauce (i added some home made veggie stock) and do not add the butter then added the scallions (i used leeks), capers and tomato. Heat and baste the halibut for a few minutes. I also used roasted asparagus. Totally awesome.Served with lemon risotto.

Rating: 3
This recipe is delicious, but I have to agree with another reviewer in that it can easily be modified to be more healthy (HOW much butter?!) and still delicious. I used half the fish but left the sauce amount the same, and it was fantastic- used olive oil for searing and used barely the butter and it was still fantastic. Serve with orzo and you're set.

Yes, absolutely I will serve this again. I also opted for shallots and sauteed them briefly before deglazing the pan. Not having haricots at hand, I served the fish with seared spinach, and it was a favorable (attractive and tasty) accompaniment..

This dish so rocks! It stands up to serious tweaking and still tastes way good. So my tweaks are as follows: shallots instead of scallions (didn't have them), lime instead of lemon (had a ton of limes and no lemons (CSA decided to dump limes on me), used two heirloom tomatoes (one zebra striped, other a red), no capers (didn't have them), lots lots of wine (didn't measure), less butter (by about half), olive oil instead of whatever oil for halibut, and steamed green beans without salt. So, the results were very very good. My 2-year-old even ate the "chicken" and green beans. Next time I will make it with the capers and lemon though I think I will keep the shallots. They are just so good with white wine.

Rating: 4
This was as simple as they say - very impressive for company. I made it exactly as written, but omitted the capers since neither one of us is a fan. My husband claimed it was definitely "restaurant quality." I made it a couple weeks ago for the two of us and am making it again tonight for my parents.

I substituted 1/2 cup of peas for the hericots verts and added 1 clove of thinly sliced garlic with the scallions - also I used grape tomatoes that I sliced in half - just the right sweetness. I served with orzo and got RAVE reviews. I will definitely make again with the above adjustments.

I have made this dish three times. The first time I halved the butter and doubled the wine as suggested by other reviewers, but I think it made the sauce too thin and threw off the flavor balance (though it was still good). The second time I made it exactly as the recipe suggested. Very yummy and rich. The third time I used 3/4 the suggested amount of butter and just a little extra wine. For me this was perfect. Bottom line, this is a fantastic, easy, colorful, delicious recipe that is wonderful as is and which you can play around with as you wish to your own tastes. A definite keeper!

This was a relatively easy, nice dish. I wasn't all that impressed with the sauce - I felt something was missing even when I followed others advice by doubling wine and using less butter. I served halibut over the green beans - but also added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the beans. Very nice presentation.

'Awesome!' was the last dinner table comment. Made some changes, sea bass, asparagus(looked the best at the market), half the butter & almost twice the wine(pinot grigio). Everything else by the book. I did manage to get the fish stuck to the pan, but did not panic & saved it. The sauce was velvety, bursting with flavor & just the perfect amount(amply covered any little appearance errors with the fish). Served with pan roasted baby dutch potatoes & steamed spinach. The sauce made everything better. Was amazed at how quickly this came together, definitely a main course when you don't have alot of time. It also looks so labor intensive when you bring to the table! I must also thank the reviewer for this tip - my fish pieces were of different thickness & I took off heat & covered with foil before completely done. It finished beautifully under the foil & was not overcooked.

Excellent! Read all reviews for tips on personalizing this dish. Placed cod plus sauce as printed (added 2T pesto) on bed of asparagus (green beans at my supermarket today sucked) and red potatoes roasted with garlic and shallot. Put baked, packaged onion rings around the rim of serving platter. Beautiful presentation. Husband and teenagers licked their plates. Add to permanent recipe list.

I tweaked it a bit and marinated my halibut in olive oil, white wine and chopped fresh herbs, rosemary, thyme and fresh minced garlic and then pan-seared and added scallion and white wine sauce - really refreshing and delicious halibut - would use the sauce w/ other fish like salmon or sea bass and also with scallops or shrimp

Yum! We served this for ourselves and another couple and it was a hit. Followed the recipe exactly and found it to be flavorful, colorful and wonderful. Halibut is such a flavorful, buttery fish that when combined with this amazing sauce, the flavors really pop. A little sauce goes a long way so I wouldn't worry about making extra (which I would never say normally since I love sauce, but this is so full tasting you don't need tons of extra - let the fish stand for itself) We also served this with roasted new potatoes with rosemary and fresh sliced tomatoes with basil to make a complete, beautiful meal.

Rating: 4
Delicious, impressive and easy. I used Mahi Mahi, and floured it lightly to help it brown faster (it also helped thicken the sauce somewhat). For extra flavor, I added some minced shallots to the pan before the wine and lemon juice. I also used quartered cherry tomatoes instead of a diced large tomato. I did not find it necessary to use all of the butter; it's a good idea to taste as you go and stop adding butter when it's enough for your taste. Also, I did not make the haricots verts; I am sure they would be good, but the dish stands well on its own without them. This was a luxurious dish for a cold and rainy Valentine's eve, but would be light enough for a lovely summertime meal, as well. The sauce is versatile and would work well on many kinds of fish.

We rented a villa on the southern coast of Spain for a week. When we got there, there was absolutely nothing in the pantry. This dish was perfect. It didn't require any expensive spices or herbs--all the ingredients are fresh and readily available. We got very fresh, local fish and used olives instead of capers because the former were more plentiful. So good, we made it twice (with two different fish) in the same week.

Rating: 4
Simply delicious even after burning the sauce while the baby was having a tantrum. Sprinkled some extra flavors on the fish while frying: a blend of freshly ground nutmeg, Prudhomme's magic seasonings and cayenne. Served over a bed of roasted corn (sprinkled with good chile powder) and topped simply with quartered yellow pear tomatoes and capers. I look forward to preparing it the way it was intended, but enjoyed the inspiration and the health value to the sauce-less variety.

Made this w/ my husband & kids - it was marvelous. Fast, easy & truly delicious. Everybody gobbled up the sauce, & I thought it would be great on its own with pasta. The only substitute we made was organic aspargus for the haricots verts, (couldn't find fresh ones - thanks to prior cook for suggestion). Also, we didn't peel the tomato (oops, somebody had already diced it), but it didn't affect the result. Marvelous; will be making this for "business company" soon!

I have made this recipe at least 15 times. It is WONDERFUL. Since I use more than the amount of halibut called for(about 10-12)I make more sauce. I use 1 cup wine, 1/2 cup white balsamic vinegar. Reduce to a third then whisk 3---3-1/2 sticks of butter. I use good quality petite diced tomatoes that have been dusted with a bit of arrowroot or cornstarch. Blend in with the scallions and capers to a bare bubble. I keep the sauce warm until ready---never boil or simmer. I always serve it with angel pasta and homemade pesto made with minimal olive oil. A perfect combo.

I made this dish for my fathers 74th Birthday and it was delicious, I used about a 1 kg piece of halibut and cooked it whole but found I had to put a lid on at the end to poach it abit. Moist and so flavorful with the sauce, I used yellow tomatoes and large capers ( double capers next time). Served it over rice this time, next time I'm going to try it over a pasta, maybe rotini? Going to try it with red and yellow peppers and snow peas instead of green beans as they are starting to get tough. Easy to make!!!!!

This was great even with all my improvisations. I reduced the Canola oil, added a tsp of butter (browns better). Didn't have scallions or capers so used sweet onion, a clove of garlic and the lemon zest. Halved the butter and doubled or tripled the wine. Sauteed the onion, garlic, and zest then added the wine, lemon juice, and butter then the tomatoes. It was wonderful - crisp, moist, and flavorful. The freshness and quality of the fish is paramount.

This is a fabulous recipe! I addded a little more wine (1/4 cup more) and additional scallions. I also browned the halibut on both sides for two minutes, then I immediately put the fish in the oven at 375 degrees (on some foil sprayed with olive oil) for six minutes as I finished making the sauce. The timing was perfect and the dish was amazing! I'll make this again, and again!

Fabulous recipe. This one is a keeper. Since I made this for just the two of us, I cut down on the butter, but kept the rest of the measurements the same. Served it over angel hair pasta that I had tossed with olive oil and lemon juice - the sauce from the halibut just enhanced it. We will be serving this one often.

this recipe rocks! i actually used cod filets [i'm in paris, and couldn't find halibut; the frozen cod filets from picard are great for all you frenchies out there!]--my husband raved. i didn't use all of the butter and ommitted the capers, and it was a light, flavorful dish. pretty and sophisticated enough to make for a dinner party.

This was a really impressive dish -- the sauce was marvelous (I kept the amount of butter as given in the recipe -- it is rich, but delicious). It also looks gorgeous on the plate. Definitely a keeper.

My comments echo the last reviewer. I picked up a beautiful halibut fillet at Costco and decided to try this. Only substitute was using asparagus instead of green beans. It was superb. That being said, I will try using less butter next time. I know it will affect the flavor and consistency of the sauce, but it is simply too much butter for me. I'll play with it and try to find a happy medium. To you butter lovers - go for it as is!

This is absolutely the BEST fish dish I have ever made! I had a gorgeous fresh piece of Alaskan Halibut, found this recipe with all the kudo reviews, and tried it. It is easy, quick, gorgeous on the plate, and good to the last bite. Definitely a keeper, and good for a formal meal....worthy of a fine French restaurant!! I did it for just myself this time, but can't wait to share it with guests soon.

I rarely make dishes more than once, but this one is now a weekly staple in my house! I use shallots instead of scallions and one small roma tomato. Also, I add more wine and only use about half of the butter. Goes well with any steamed veggies. Delicious!

Really really tasty sauce. I had thought maybe the tomatoes were an odd addition, but they were wonderful. This is spectacularly easy to make. I used regular green beans (cook them a little longer), and flounder since there wasn't any halibut at the store. I'll try for halibut next time. Still and all, wonderful.

This was a sensational dish. The visual appeal of the platter surprised me, very pretty. Quick and relatively easy. I would not recommend that anyone change the proportions on first try. This is one of the best chefs in the US and knows his stuff (click on the tester's notes). You need the butter to create an emulsion, thickening the sauce. This is a classic technique. I made the dish for one person, and to make it a whole meal I diced up a yukon gold potato to the boiling water and gave that 6 min before adding the beans for 6 min. This was the base to rest the fish on. The halibut still seemed rare in the center, but by the time it rested while I made the sauce, it was perfect. I plan to make this for company--this dish with fresh local halibut would cost $18 in a restaurant here and it is that quality.

Reasonably simple and delicious.Nice light sauce. Mistakenly used chardonnay once. With the right wine and fresh fish and tomatoes, it's our regular "guest" meal for now. We used it first with halibut cheeks and it worked quite well.

This was overall a great dish, we increased the wine and added fresh parmesan to sauce. Served over a bed of rice pilaf. It was a hit with our guests.....

Although I have made several recipes from epicurious, this is the first one that I have been compelled to review. This dish was simple to prepare and turned out absolutely marvelous. The sauce compliments both the halibut as well as the beans. I am not a calorie counter, but I did halve the amount of butter, however, I also tripled that amount of wine (just reduce longer) and added a pinch of fresh tyme. As per the other reviewer, herb rice and sauvignon blanc were a great match.

This recipe was really, really good. My only complaint is that it was a bit mainstream, but that is a real plus for a lot of people. I made it for my mom and aunt (who don't eat a lot of fish because it is hard to find really fresh fish in their city in Iowa,) and they went crazy for it . I will definitely make this again.

I impressed the heck out of myself and my date with this one. I served it with lemon risoto and a good Savignon Blanc. Easy and impressive!

I was able to get fresh halibut, but the steaks were each over 2" thick. So instead of just searing the steaks, I also baked them for about 7 minutes on 325degrees. They turned out flakey, moist, and delicious! I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 cup of Sav/B, 2tbl less butter, and 2 more scallions. And I steamed the beans. The sauce compliments the fish and beans splendidly. I highly recommend it for a quick supper, as well as a dish you can serve to guests. Great recipe.

This was very good, but not quite as good as another recipe I found on this site for "Halibut with Herb Sauce"

This dish was PHENOMINAL! Used regular green beans and cut the butter to 6 tbl. Also, I soaked filets in milk beforehand as they weren't the freshest and smelled a little fishy. Made this for family but will definitely serve next time I have friends over for dinner. The flavors melded together so well. And in addition to its incredible taste, it takes about half an hour to prepare! Nothing short of OUTSTANDING!

Delicious, easy, and fast. Made it for my family and they loved it. I cut back on the butter and added extra wine and lemon juice for sauce. Full meal, did not need extra veggies.

This was delicious and really fast! I didn't have any green beans on hand so I used sauteed zucchini instead with great results.

I also reduced the butter, increased the wine just a bit and used less fish (just 2 of us). Excellent! and so fast! I am making it again tonight for just me alone. It's that good

This dish was amazingly good! New favorite. And easy! I added a little more white wine (s. blanc) and cut the butter by one tablespoon. Did add the tomatoes. One of the best fish dishes I have ever prepared. Highly recommend it!

As a beginner cook this was so easy and quick. (I did reduce the amount of butter by 20 percent and double the sauce- delicious!) My family was really impressed. I'd definately make this for company. A keeper.

This was great. Just the two of us so we love finding recipies that are fairly low in fat and calories but taste great. This is a winner.

I cut the butter a little, and maybe do it a little more. At the same time, I would raise the wine a little. Served it with a 2000 Buena Vista SB and it was great!

Excellent! I cut the the amount of fish down for the 2 of us but kept the amount of sauce the same and I'm glad I did. The sauce is outstanding but if I were to make it for more than 2 I'd increase the amounts given. I also used sweet onions instead of scallions and a little less butter.

Fantastic. My husband and six-year-old raved equally about it. I omitted the lemon juice since my husband hates lemon on fish and it was still perfect (capers have a lot of acidity). I placed the halibut on a bed of brown butter spaetzle (which, a first blush, would seem odd). The combination was unbelievable!

I guess I'll throw in my vote too. This is just so good! I made it last night and everyone raved. The flavors are just marvelous. This one goes in the "keeper" file!

Wow - As a beef eatin' Texan, I don't usually go crazy for halibut, but this recipe was incredible and very easy to make.My husband and I ate all four servings - just the two of us. I even used 3/4 cup of LIGHT butter instead and it was still wonderful. As a novice cook, this will be a very frequent rotation on my cooking list. YUM!!!

Excellent recipe, as quick and easy to execute as the directions imply. It went well with a Bernardo 1999 Sauvignon Blanc (when made 9/01). I tried using half of the recommended butter and it was still superb!

I loved this dish. I used aspargas instead of the beans and sliced martini olives instead of the capers. Also tried it with red snapper fillets with good results.

I've found several delightful recipes on epicurious, but this one is particularly easy to make. I was surprised that the tomato added so much to the lemon and capers. I would definitely make this again.

My husband just returned from fishing in Alaska with 250 lbs of fish, mostly halibut. I prepared this last night with the halibut plus tomatoes and green beans from the garden. WOW!!! Everyone loved it! There wasn't a scrap of fish or one bean left over and my twelve year old daughter was spooning the juice from the platter at the end of the meal. I did probably use more tomatoes than the one large called for (probably 4 small to medium). But I have tomatoes like I have fish!

This was the best! Great fish with the least amount of cooking time. Used all the required ingredients and it was delicious. I'm sure you could substitute any semi-firm fish for the halibut.

Very nice. Great for a light summer dinner. I omitted the capers because I didn't have them on hand. Next time, I will add them to the dish. I improvised to make just enough for two, and it worked fine. Delicious.
