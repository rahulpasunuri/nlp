I'm not rating this recipe because, lacking fresh poblanos, I couldn't make it as it is written. I used the recipe as the basis for a sauce made with just the dried anchos, substituting a medium amber maple syrup for the honey, and my children fell in love with it. I now serve this variation several times a month as a dipping sauce for fried foods.

Good, but not as good as the salsa verde. Smoky.

Amazing! This was my favourite of the two sauces. The roasted flavor of the peppers is wonderful.
