Wow this was totally amazing, it's the seasoning that really makes it. I made a few modifications, but I think the original recipe would have been just fine, will try to make that as-written one of these days. I used boneless pork loin because that's what I had on hand. I didn't season it a day ahead, just a few hours. Then I baked it at a higher temp (450) in my clay pot - on a bed of apples (peeled and cut into wedges) and some more of the herbs. In the clay pot, it takes a bit longer to cook, 1-½ lb boneless roast took about an hour. It was completely amazing. The pork was deliciously seasoned, and the apples were sinful with the pork drippings & herbs. Very easy, do it all ahead for a dinner party, and relax with your guests while it all cooks. YUM!

I used a 4 rib, about 2 1/2 lb roast and rubbed it the night before roasting. I had to dig the fresh herbs out of the snow, but it was worth it. Let it set an hour on the counter and then put it into the convection toaster oven. Only cooked to 130 or 135 degrees before resting. I added 2 carrots, 2 parsnips and 2 diced potatoes about half way through. It could benefit from browning fat cap or even a quick brine. It smelled great and it tasted great. We have two chops left for tomorrow, and looking forward to them.

I used a 1.5 lb boneless pork loin (what I generally keep around the house) and it roasted beautifully in 45 minutes. I included onions in the potatoes and that addition was fantastic. Next time I plan to cut down on the garlic and put the herbs and garlic through the food processor for a much, much finer chop. The pan jus didn't go very far for a family of three, but it was very good.

Delicious! I did a 6lb. bone-in pork loin and 6 med. potatoes in a disposable foil pan. I needed to add another 20 minutes to get the internal temp to 140°. And I agree with another reviewer: Forget "browning" the potatoes in a separate pan. AND next time I will also omit that second 1/4 c. oil....it's not necessary. My husband and man-cub flipped over the taste of the potatoes and fought over the last few bites. Serve with the homemade applesauce on this site Pork Chops and Applesauce. Seriously! You can peel eight apples in under 10 minutes...don't think it'll take too long!

Easy to make. Turned out okay. I'd like it to fall off the bone, so maybe I should have cooked it slower.

Very good; very simple. Would be nice "do ahead" for company. My adjustments were: Took the Review recommendation and brined; Took the Review recommendation & slathered the herb mixture on 12 hrs. advance; Prepared a boneless roast (sale); Did not tent in the oven (mistake, LOL). Boneless roast was 1.83 lbs, & took 47 minutes to reach 140 degrees. Tented during the 10 minute rest to a more appropriate temperature, & it was wonderful, juicy. Only had room for half the potatoes in the pan, so spooned out some of the roasting yum into separate pan & continued pan roasting there with onions. Enjoy!!

Out of this world, change nothing. I did it exactly as directed and it was so moist and easy to prepare. Nobody talked, they just ate and make really good noises. I will make it again and again.

This was a great, simple recipe. Everyone loved it, including the dogs who got some small pieces for being good and staying out of the kitchen ;-) I almost didn't trust the timing but it was just about right, I adjusted for 5 lbs. and added around another 20 minutes to the initial cook time. Paying attention to the thermometer is a MUST in the end. Get close to the bones when probing the meat for 160, that's where "bone-in" roasts tend to sometimes under-cook. As a twist, I also added a crushed chicken bullion cube in with the seasoning mixture. This helped to give a little more flavor and salt to the spuds too.

this recipe reminds me of my italian grandmother.. she loved rosemary in everything. too much bother as written however; no need to fry the potatos first! who needs that mess? had the fresh rosemary growing in the garden, but used dried sage since my plant hasnt yet recovered from the winter; also added some thyme, because I like the flavors. remember, 1 tsp dried = 1 Tbsp fresh herbs! mixed everything all together at once, using home made roasted garlic cloves & oil; rubbed a small boneless loin roast & tossed about 6 small quartered yukon golds that I didnt bother to peel in the remaining oil mixture. it goes all into the pan at once, stir the potatos every once in a while, and cooked the roast to an internal 145. let it rest for the requisite 15 minutes, then plate & serve. that's the way a true old world italian would have done it. grams had no time for unnecessary fussing. delicioso!*

This was mouth wateringly delicious! I just laid the herbs and garlic around in the pan instead of rubbing a mixture on the pork - it still got a lot of flavour. Perfect!

Have made this a few times, each a bit different. This last time I made it exactly as written. All of them good...pork is so moist and tasty. I have also prepared it with just olive oil, ground pepper and garlic; also, olive oil, garlic, finely minced onion, course ground pepper, sea salt. I don't do the potatoes..but use new potatoes boiled...a bit more healthy and like the flavour more than roasted potatoes. Not a huge fan of potato roasted.

This is a simple, elegant recipe, full of flavor and just the right thing for a fall day. Along with the potatoes, I added a red pepper, and a quartered red onion. A meat thermometer saved on guess work. The roast turned out perfect. We paired it with a petite syrah&We will definitely make this again!

My boneless loin of pork came out good. I need to adjust the seasoning a bit. Totally, I use 3 tsp of salt for this dish. Two for the pork and one for potato.

I used a boneless pork loin so only cooked it 4o minutes. I cooked the potatoes with it the whole time. My husband loved it, our dinner guest went back for seconds, and I will make this again for sure. The potatoes were divine. I can't wait to make this again. (Oh I also brined the meat before roasting it. Yummmmm....)

I'm only giving this two forks because the recipe calls for baking the roast to too high of a temperature for my liking. I was going by another review that said something about a temp of 150 being great for pork. Next time I think I'll take it to 135 degrees, then remove it and tent it to shoot for a temp around 142. I brined the roast in a beer brine for 24 hours two days ahead, then removed it from the brine and rubbed it with the herbs and let it sit another 24 hours. The brining saved it from being overly dry, but it would have been much juicier had it been removed earlier.

I've made this recipe before for our small family (and everyone loves it) but yesterday i made it for an (extended) family Sunday Dinner. People would not stop talking about how wonderful it was as they took each bite, it is an impressive dish. i added extra oil, garlic and substituted fresh sage with fresh minced bay leaves. frying the potatoes in olive oil is a must for the crisp.

a truly awesome recipe--very, VERY close to what i ate in Rome.I could only buy a boneless center cut--brined it for three hours and marinaded it fo 24 hrs. I covered with foil and roasted at the recipe temperature for 1 1/4 hr, then added the sauted potatoes for the last 40 minutes. It was PERFECT! We didnt need knives to cut the meat; forks were all that were needed. I "nuked" the leftover potatoes and pork slices the next day for dinner--lovely..none of that stale "reheated" taste. This recipe is a true winner.

This is a great simple roast pork recipe. As for timings and this is critical. fair warning food police, I consider pork over done at 160 degrees. So, my 3.8 lb roast started colder than I would have liked.. 45 degrees when it when in the oven. Even at that, the cooking time to reach 155 (my favorite temp for pork) was 1 hr 45 minutes with a stand time in the roasting pan of 15 minutes. It was yummy, juicy and tender. I didnt' have a specail roast... I bought a bone-in pork loin roast from my local supermarket for 11.94 (for a 3.8 lb roast, not per pound). It was marvleous and the potatoes were excellent as well.

Timing is completely off in this recipe. I wasted a $40 cut of meat. Do not attempt this recipe without a thermometer. Cooking time is 2 hours or less. On the other hand, the herb mixture was good.

I've made this dish many times and it is spectacular. My husband has requested it for Father's Day. Be sure to call the butcher ahead of time so you get the bone-in cut, it makes the meat juicier.

I made this without the potatoes. It was very delicious - moist on the inside and a nice a crust on the outside. I would highly recommend using a meat thermometer to make sure it cooks perfectly.

A very easy receipe, but beware of the pork loin that you use, If you use a tenderloin roast, the cooking time is shorter, so put a thermeter into the middle of the roast and take out at 165 and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting. I browned the roast before hand, and in the same pan, roasted the potatoes before putting into the casserole dish. With the tenderloin, cooking time is 45 minutes roughly, so I prepared potatoes before putting in the roast. Served with a cranberry chutney, vegetable and green salad. Turned out great. this receipe is a keeper.

The pork was too tough. I bought it at the fancy meat place and adhered to the recipe, so I don't know what went wrong. The potatoes were delish, though.

Easy and delicous. I used a boneless pork loin and adjusted the cooking time. I put the potatoes in so that they would cook as long as the recipe specified, but a few were undercooked. May put them in earlier next time. Served with the baked apples from the October issue! Oh, heaven!!!!

I never rated this recipe because I've been making it since the month the recipe was printed in Bon Appetit straight from the magazine (which, by the way, is a total mess because I have made just about every recipe in that wonderful Tuscan issue!). This recipe is fabulous but I must admit that I do not fry the potatoes because I hate the mess frying so much makes to my stove top and hanging pots! I prepare them with the oil-herb mixture then I throw them into the pan with the roast a 1/2 hour after I put the roast into the oven, that way the potatoes have the delicious flavor of the pork.

This was DELICIOUS. I subbed two boneless pork sirloin roasts that weighed a total of 3.7 lbs. for the bone-in roast. Cut down the oil to 4 Tbs. total (2 Tbs. for the marinate and 2 Tbs. to fry the potatoes). Added 1 Tbs. water, extra garlic, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and used 1 tsp. each of dried rubbed sage and rosemary. Packed the marinate on the roasts and refrigerated them 24+ hours in a Zip-Loc bag. Used a huge non-stick skillet to fry the potatoes in 2 batches with 1 Tbs. oil per batch. Revised the baking time for the roasts to 40 minutes (covered); then 35 minutes (uncovered) after adding the potatoes. It was a little shy on pan juices because the meat was SO lean, but it sure was more heart healthy and still WONDERFUL. DO TRY THIS!!!!

I made this first with pork and it was OK -- two forks. But then I made it with a bone in rib (eye) roast and it was delicious. Let the meat marinate for at least a day so that the flavors can intensify. Fresh sage is a must (widely available in clear plastic packages in the produce section of most grocery stores) -- please don't substitute as you will have vastly different results!

I'm a novice cook. I cooked the pork in a pan that was too big (so my mom tells me). The juices cooked away and I had none left to pour over the meat. The result was pork that was just good instead of possibly great. Despite that, the potatoes were absolutely wonderful. I will try again with a smaller pan.

I made this recipe with a boneless pork loin--reduced the cooking time accordingly. I also approximately doubled the herbs, largely because I love foods with strong flavors. This turned out mouthwateringly tender, and the potatoes were wonderful. I'm in agreement with an earlier reviewer who is adding this to the list of company recipes. It's definitely on mine!

as a beginner cook, the recipe was very easy. but unfortunately i used a boneless roast that was cut in half so the time in the oven should have been decreased for the roast. the meat was very flavorful but i didnt have alot of extra juice (which was the best part!) next time i will use the correct meat cut and i will double the herb mixture. bottom line: the dish was very tasty and i will definitely use this recipe in the future.
