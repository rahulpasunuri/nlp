I also used some grated romano cheese on the galettes. Sorry, I can't put the Apple Tarts Poilane on the site. After typing in the recipe, I noticed that you can not submit a recipe that has been published. It was in Bon Appetit, May 2001 and on the cover it says Delicious Paris.

Yesterday, I was going through an old "Bon Appetit", May 2001 and found this recipe. I had no idea what a gallet was, so I came on the computer and found it on epicurious. I used a few of the ideas theat other reviewers suggested, such as cayenne pepper and a little bit of garlic on the galattes. After putting the galattes in the microwave, I baked then at 400 degrees for about 15 or 20 minutes, drizzled with butter. I also used a pound of jumbo lump crab ( which I got on sale at my local store).With a few more shrimp and two more galettes, it would have served six (there were four of us). In a word , it was DELICIOUS. For dessert, from the same magazine, I made Apple Tarts Poilane. I'll try and get it on the recipe section where site users can put recipes up.

Wonderful! I made a few changes. I went with the parmesan cheese and baking method recommended by another reviewer. I also added cayenne pepper to the potatoes while baking as well as to the crab mixture. I baked at 350 degrees but may use a higher temp or the broiler next time. After the potatoes came out of the oven I sprinkled chopped garlic over them before adding the crab meat. I also doubled the amount of crab meat as well as the sauce. For the asparagus, after removing the shrip, I sprinkled kosher salt and lemon juice over them before adding to the plates.

I think the last reviewer made an error. It isn't 4 inches high - the potatoes are in a 4 inch circle. I followed the directions exactly and they cooked perfect. I agree the sauce and crab is a little bland. I may try adding a picnch of horseradish or tabasco sauce to the sefood mixture (like a remoulade)next time.

I think the potatoes should be a little shorter so that they'd cook quicker. I made mine about 3" tall, microwaved them for 4 minutes, cooked them in a skillet as directed, and they still weren't quite done. Make sure you serve the crab/leek mix hot! Otherwise this recipe was pretty tasty and one I'd like to try again.

The flavors were all right in this dish, it seemed like it was missing something though. Maybe a different sauce might help things pop. Needs a little work.

The potatoes were delicious. Made ahead of time and then fried just before serving and kept warm in oven. Crispy and just perfect, although I wish I'd taken another reviewers advice and added parmesean. As for the crab part....BORING!!! The sauce....BORING. Definately a nice presentation but would change the sauce for a more flavorful dish. Too bland for me....and I felt as if I wasted my $25 a can crab!

I made this dish earlier this year for my monthly cooking club dinner -- it was the hands-down favorite appetizer for the year, voted "best of" and will be featured in our annual "best of" dinner in January when we invite a bunch of friends to sample our labors! I love this dish and can't wait to try it again!!

Outstanding combination of crab, shrimp & potato only made better by the sauce. Takes lots of preparation, but worth the effort.

How long did the cook bake the potatoes and at what temperature?

I was a bit nervous about the combination of flavors in the recipe, but the flavors blended perfectly. I served the dish as a main course by making the galette a bit larger and adding more asparagus and shrimp. I followed another reviewer's advice about adding parmesean cheese to the galettes and baking them in the oven instead of frying them and it worked beautifully. In addition to tasting delicious, this dish lends itself well to presentation.

This recipe turned out really good. Everyone enjoyed it very much -- there are a lot of steps to follow; however, the end result was delicious. I would definitely make it again.

In France, a galette is any broad, thin cake. A galette de sarrasin, by name, is a thin cake made of buckwheat. This is a fairly sophisticated recipe which deserves, when made correctly, to be served to guests often.

This is a really nice and easy recipe. I can also recommend when making the galettes to slice the potatoe slightly thinner, arrange the slices on a baking tray and sprinkle each layer with oil and parmesan cheese then bake until crisp don't bother about putting them in the frying pan just do it all in a hot oven. They're fantastic !

I think this was really very nice. I presented it just as it appears in the photo, which is picture perfect.
