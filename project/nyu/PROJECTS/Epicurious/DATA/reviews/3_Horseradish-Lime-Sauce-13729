My wife has been making this sauce for years, only she serves it as a refreshing dipping sauce with cold par-boiled broccoli. It is great in the summer when it is hot out and this cold hors d'oeuvre is cool yet zingy. It always sells out. Also, she uses 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. She lightly tosses the cooked broccoli in Italian salad dressing before serving. It should be crisp and cold.

I have been using this sauce for crab cakes, scallops and other various sea foods since the recipe was first published. My family LOVES this. Even my picky father-in-law asked me to make it and bring the recipe to a recent family vacation! Using fresh lime juice and zest is the key as the zest imparts the most favor without making the sauce runny.

Delicious sauce! Was dipping everything on my plate in it:-)

This is a somewhat sophisticated alternative to the traditional tartar sauce. I added an extra teaspoon of lime juice. I used white pepper to avoid black specks in the sauce. This definitely needs to be chilled for at least four hours--the flavors developed quite a bit in that time. As tasty as this sauce is, it falls short of the basil aioli (on this website).

I haven't made this recipe but several reviewers of the crab cake, fried scallop, and fish fritters all seem to be raving about it so I was suprised that there was no review here. Check out crab cakes 21 club for a review of this sauce
