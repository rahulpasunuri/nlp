Great recipe! My husband even went so far as to say "Kick-ass good!" I made a few small changes. (1)I used green olives with pimento centers and left the pimento in, (2)I couldn't find anchovy paste in my grocery store, so I used Worcestershire sauce and (3)as another reviewer did, I pushed the fish down into the sauce and turned it once during cooking. I think the fish may have been just barely over-cooked but otherwise wonderfully delicious! I served it over polenta, which was the perfect paring for the fish and the sauce. I would DEFINITELY make this again.

Loved the sauce but would have WAY preferred with almost any other fish. Will try a whitefish next time. Orange zest is a big winner in this dish, and it came out great with dried oregano, too. Trust that you'll need the bread (or serve over pasta) so as not to waste the delicious sauce!

Delicious! The description made it sound like the fish was supposed to steam on top of the sauce, but I pressed it into the sauce so it poached, flipping once. Used regular diced tomatoes and added fresh basil. Added lentils at the beginning and peas near the end to make it a full meal. Very flavorful, the tiny bit of orange zest really comes through.

This was yummy (I made it with tilapia and served it with brown rice), but I was dismayed to find that the organic diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano I got at Whole Foods had sugar in them. It made the whole sauce sweeter than I like. Next time I'll double-check the ingredients (are all canned diced tomatoes with Italian spices like this?) or just use plain diced tomatoes and add my own herbs.

Easy, healthy, fool-proof way to prepare fish! Second time I used swordfish and pimento-stuffed green olives..awesome. Make sure to have extra bread ready for soaking up leftover sauce!

This is a fantastic weeknight meal. I made it in 40 minutes last night for a guy I'm dating (not quite a boyfriend) in his very minimally equipped kitchen. He won't shut up about how delicious it was. I did make a couple of modifications: 1. Subbed fresh halibut for the mahi mahi because it looked better and was in season. 2. Made it without the anchovy paste as I didn't feel like buying any just for this and he obviously didn't have any on hand. We didn't miss it. 3. I subbed 1 pint fresh heirloom cherry tomatoes + 1 T. chopped fresh oregano + 1 big clove minced garlic for the canned tomatoes since the fresh ones are perfectly in season. As such, added the garlic in step 1 with the onion. It turned out absolutely fantastic and plated up beautifully. Make this! Especially if you want to impress someone. You won't go wrong!

Good recipe. Asian (Thai) fish sauce is a good substitute for anchovy paste. Squeeze some of the orange's juice in, as well. I only had unseasoned diced tomatoes, so I added fresh basil, more garlic, and fresh oregano. The sauce was great the next day over couscous.

I've made this dish several times and every time it's a hit! tonight I made it with but instead of 2 cans of tomatoes, i added 1 can, and then some lentils with water! it thickened it up and gave it nice added fiber and texture! I strongly recommend. The olives are to die for!

Simple, light and delicious. I have substituted tilapia when mahi mahi is not available and omitted the anchovy paste when I did not have it in the house. Good everytime.

Delicious! I added garlic, used leek instead of onion, subbed black olives for green, and served the dish with Israel couscous and green veggies. We licked our plates! The orange zest is an interesting addition - don't skip this.

3 words - sorry in advance...SO DAMN GOOD! Put a little garlic in (don't overdue this!), used Tilapia, and was SO glad there was extra sauce left over! Unfortunately on a low-carb diet, so couldn't have the bread, but oh - when we get to stage 2, we'll have it over Tuscan Bean Salad!

This was an easy and delicious dish. Would definitely make it again and again! Makes a nice presentation for company.

Rave review from husband. Kids were just okay with it. It took much longer to cook the fish. Maybe I didn't have the burner up high enough. Will absolutely make it again.

So, so flavorful and easy to make. I followed the recipe as directed, and served it over a warm Tuscan bean salad.

Excellent. Will make for guests next. Cooked down the sauce after removing the fish. Then mashed tomatoes with slotted spoon and dipped wisk into flour a few times and stirred into sauce to thicken abit.

I am surprised there are not more reviews for this recipe! This was very easy and the sauce was outstanding. I was not sure how I would like the orange zest in combination with the other ingredients but I am sold! Like others, I substituted tilapia (and decreased cooking time) and used sliced garlic instead of onions. I served it over orecchiette tossed with olive oil, salt & pepper. I honestly can't wait to make this again.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was very good - moist, flavorful and enjoyed by all. Probably could have cut the sauce by 1/4 to 1/2 the recipe - Had a lot left over. Would definitely make again.

Fabulous! I did not have anchovy paste, and substituted capers instead. I also added some garlic. Delicious on a rainy night with a crusty baguette. Boyfriend also liked it. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it. Simple to make and delicious.

Not bad. The tomato olive sauce was nice but way too overpowering for such delicious fish, we can barely taste the mahi mahi. I prefer simpler recipes for this kind of fish. I would try again but with a less expensive fish, like maybe halibut or cod.

Loved this dish for many reasons: it couldn't be easier, it's really quick, it's healthy, and, best of all, it's absolutely delicious! I made it just as written with the one exception that I added a couple of TBS of capers. For those who are intimidated and a little afraid of cooking fish, this is for you. It's foolproof!

Great! I only had red wine, but everything else was as written. I made the fish and the sauce seperately--to keep the fish warmer and avoid the tent.

Delicious. Will definitely make again, as even my teenage sons loved it. A note,to be careful not to overcook the fish, as that happens very easily if the fish sits in the sauce as it then continuos to cook.

Delicious. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful, healthy dish. Made exactly as directed except I thought I had anchovy paste (but it was tomato paste) so I omitted. Yum, yum. Served w/the bread as mentioned and some sauteed spinach. Does it get any better or healthier????

This is a one of the best recipes I have ever tried! I left out the anchovy paste. I served it over a bed of raw spinach. I also had to substitute lemon for orange. I made this last week when a friend stopped by and he took the recipe home. I plan on making this over an over again!

This recipe wow-ed me! It was a hit with both of my parents, and that's always difficult to achieve because my dad likes traditional foods and my mom likes experimental and exotic foods. This recipe was really great. I'll be making it again.

A friend gave us some mahi-mahi and I wasn't sure how to cook it. This recipe was quick and featured the fish nicely. My husband isn't a fan of anchovy paste, so I added capers instead. I know it was good because my husband had seconds, something he rarely does! This recipe would be great with halibut or talapia.

This was a hit! Super delicious and so easy. I used basa fish which had a nice texture but definitely benefited from the flavors in the sauce. Also subbed lemon peel since that's what I had on hand. The contrast of white fish and red & green sauce is very pretty. I will be making this again.

Delicious and simple. Mahimahi was too expensive, used tilapia. The sauce is scrumptious, would also be good on pastas, swordfish, chicken. The orange peel is lovely. Def a keeper!!

Tried this tonight for dinner, used 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano in with the tomato sauce as I cooked the fish, and 1/4 dried in with the olive added at the end since I didn't have fresh. Rave reviews!! It's a keeper.

I made this for a dinner party this evening, and it turned out wonderfully. We used tilapia instead of mahi mahi (due to availability) but it was still awesome. Easy, tasty, and everyone loved it.
