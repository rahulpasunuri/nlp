Didn't rate because I didn't make the full recipe, just the swiss chard filling. I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins, and it was fantastic. I'm not the biggest of chard fans, but we get them in our bimonthly produce box so I've had to be creative. This was a great recipe, I served it over pan fried porch chops. Delish.

Good, but cutting and stuffing the racks of lamb was more of a pain than it was worth. It was good because lamb tastes good. I liked the stuffing (I excluded the raisins - gross), but next time i'll serve the stuffing on the side.

I made a reduced version of this, just One 4-rib rack to feed Two. There was just enough meat, along with the Souffle and the filling for a hearty weeknight meal. I can't seem to find Chard here, so used some tenderstem Broccoli instead, and the lamb chops weren't big enough to be stuffed, so instead roasted the filling in the pan with the lamb. It made for an outstanding meal.

I am sorry this recipe didn't do it for me. I invited a couple of friends for dinner the other day, and I wanted a lamb dish to be the star ... it was not. The mustard flavour competed with the natural flavour of the lamb, the rosemary and thyme got lost in the mix. The swiss chard turned so bland as a stuffing, it should have been served as a side dish ... it is delicious on its own ...

I picked this up as a way to entertain guests and use up a bunch of pine nuts. Wow. It was absolutely delicious and received rave reviews. The meat was cooked just right, very juicy and pink on the inside. The swiss chard imparted a fresh earthiness that was sweetened by the raisins. To top it off, it took minimal time (I prepared it while chatting with friends over wine) and the presentation of a rack of lamb is always a hit. What a low maintenance way to entertain. I did find that I had more filling than was needed, but that quickly disappeared with a fork :) This was a wonderful alternative to the mint or rosemary that is typically paired with lamb (which I find to be really dated).

My daughter described this as simply the best meat she had ever tasted. I think that I might try something other than chard next time -- perhaps spinach. However, the dijon and herb crust with the vermouth was absolutely spectacular.

I thought the swiss chard mixture was a little too sweet and lacking something. My guests raved about it but I was underwhelmed.

Excellent! The baking (lower) element in my oven melted right before putting this in for Easter Dinner (yikes). With a meat thermometer and the broiling element this still turned out perfectly! Instead of the garlic souffle I was planning on having, served this with garlic mashed potatoes instead. Delicious - only problem was there weren't any left- overs.

This is an exceptional lamb recipe. It is so moist and the flavor is devine. I used a little less Dijon and a little more herbs. Jane

I was confused. Do you use the leaves from the chard or "stems and center ribs"?

What a great dish--- just perfect for Easter or anytime. I made it just for myself, so I made only the roasted red peppers to accompany it. I can only imagine how good it would be with the rest of the Gourmet menu. The only food I hate is raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries. Also, I had no rosemary in the house, so I substituted parsley and sage. Also, I used red chard instead of green because it looked better in the market.

This is always one of my favorite recipes. Dont just use it at Easter it is a great Table Pleaser on any occasion.

Extraordinary. I would not (and did not) change a thing. As is, it is likely the best presentation of rack of lamb I have ever made. As stated by another reviewer, I will make this over and over.
