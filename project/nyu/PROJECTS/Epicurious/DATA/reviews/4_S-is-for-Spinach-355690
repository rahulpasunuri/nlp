My baby loved this recipe for spinach! I used full grown (not baby) spinach and breast milk. Pureed it in a blender. It was delicious I have to say.

I didn't have regular milk and tried the recommended milk alternative. Very tasty recipe, even with breast milk!

I thought my baby hated spinach, until I tried this recipe. He loved it!
