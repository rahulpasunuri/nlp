I love this relish. I add about a half of a finely minced jalepeno pepper. My addition is why I gave it four forks. It's addictive. If the onion is strong, use less. If the jalepeno is super hot, use less. I make it the day before to let the flavors meld. Taste it the next day. Add more of any of the ingredients to the relish if you wish.

I really enjoyed this relish and I make it several times a year. I like the way the sweet pineapple blends with the heat of the onion and the cool taste of mint.

Really didn't like this relish. Very oniony taste that overpowered the pineapple and mint. Also very dry relish, tried to add pineapple juice but it still didn't help. Recommend using the cherry/pecan relish instead MUCH better!

This relish went well with the ham I baked on New Years. However, it was better yet the next day when I served it with left-overs.

Pretty mediocre, especially considering the excellent ham it originally accompanied. People ignored this dish at my dinner party--I wouldn't make it again. A nice Indonesian spicy fruit salad would be a tastier similar condiment, I think.

A very tasty relish, that makes a great accompaniment to ham. Great taste, color and texture.

This is a refreshing condiment. We served it with turkey and I plan on making it again when we cook ham.
