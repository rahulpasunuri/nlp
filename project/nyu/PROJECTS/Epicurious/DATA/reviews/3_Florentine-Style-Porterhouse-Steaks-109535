Sam marinades meat in olive oil,sea salt, much cracked pepper, and worchester several hours and allows the meat to come to room temperature. He cooks inside the house and purchases a long ri8b eye from Sams, cuts it to his spec and freezes nthe remainder. He cooks in a very hot oilked iron skillet about 8 or 9 minutes on each side nand at the end tops of with balsamic AND LEMMON

I have made this recipe so many times now and has become our favorite steak recipe for this cut because of it's simplicity. Most steak recipes are easy but this one is a bit more decadent since it reminds me of the steakhouses we go to for special occasions-only less expensive. I'm making it again tonight with a wilted spinach and crispy fried shallot salad. In my humble opinion, its the perfect summer meal

It is interesting to read through the ratings and comments below. Some of the reviewers are upset because this dish is so simple to make. There are even many comments about the salting of the meat. In Tuscany, were this dish has its origin, they use Chianina beef. That is the same cattle breed that is used in Parma to make the incredible "red cow" Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, which rarely gets exported out of Italy. As in most other Italian recipes, there are as many variations as there are people cooking the dish. I've had the dish made with no salt added until it is served. Salt and extra virgin olive oil drizzled over it right after it is cut. I've seen it prepared with a roasted rosemary stalk dipped in olive oil with anchovies and then brushed over the steak. My take on the "Fiorentina" in Bistecca Fiorentina is that it means "in the style of the Florentine women". The name Fiorentina (in this case and every other culinary case) has nothing to do with spinach. Having said of the above, get the best quality beef, generally porterhouse with a big tenderloin portion attached and cook as in the recipe. Add the salt before, during or after; whichever is your pleasure. Then enjoy over spinach, broccoli rabe, or arugula. It is simple and delicious.

A great company dish. I served it with sauteed spinach with pancetta - a hit.

The fascination of this dish makes it a natural for pairing with the equally demanding recipe for boiled salted water. oooh.

I have made this twice already because my Italian husband can't seem to get enough! Because of his high cholesterol(?), we stay away from red meat. But anything that reminds him of Italy, he says is good for him. The grilling time on this is right on and we use the best olive oil - it really makes a difference. After the steak is cut off the bone and sliced (which, by the way, is how they serve it at Peter Luger's - the best steakhouse in NYC), it can be served over fresh arugula w/a light olive oil vinaigrette. This recipe is simple, yet one of the best.

I haven't made this specific recipe, but I've copied the 'bistecca fiorentina' and the 'tagliata' I've had in Tuscany. The bistecca (a porterhouse) I made was just grilled, seasoned with pepper and salt, left whole, sprinkled with olive oil and served with a lemon wedge. Often the price in Itlay was based on the weight of the meat. The tagliata is better, in my mind. That one is a thick sirloin, (or you could use tenderloin, too) seasoned with salt and pepper,grilled to medium rare and sliced about 3/4" thick. Slices are put on top of (raw) arugula, it's all sprinkled with olive oil, and topped with shaved parmesan (reggiano)That has a lemon wedge, too It's absolutely fabulous. Just thought I'd add my comments!

The 'Tuscan T-Bone' described below is amazing (with the oil & herb infusion), the best steak I have ever had, but I haven't found it prepared in the US like they do in Italy. I think called bisteca fiorentina in Italian. Florentine refers to spinach in the dish when used outside of Italy, in Italy, it just means 'In the style of Florence', which could be anything.

When I read the ingredient list for this I thought it might be similar to something I once read about called Tuscan steak, where the steak is part-cooked and then finished by pouring boiling herb-infused oil over it. Sounds disgusting but is supposed to be delicious when done correctly. Has anyone heard of/made/eaten this?

You have got to be kidding ??? Salt before grilling, low to medium heat, cutting off the bone and then cutting into slices ? that wold be normally classified as roast beef not steak !

To the cook from New Zealand, Florentine just means in the style of Florence. Also, the picture is not of spinach, it is broccoli rabe.

When I had steak Florentine in Florence, it was served on a mound of raw arugula and drizzled with olive oil. A half lemon was served on the side; a good foil for the rich and sweet olive oil. The steak was heavily seasoned with salt and pepper. What a great dish. I love it.

As a cookery trainer at Massey University, New Zealand I was captivated by the name of the dish. "A la Florentine" means served with spinach, and the photograph accompanying the recipe verifies the presence of spinach. Alas no spinach in the recipe, however. An oversight?

I agree with the review regarding the quality of the steak. I have always grilled my steaks of better quality w/ just kosher salt on them. The diference is, that I know to call it "Florentine style"

Should I place the steak on the grill with the "T" facing the front of the heat source or the back. More important than placing the meat on the grill is the quality of the cut. Insist on USDA Choice and take note of the tenderloin size - there are only about 4 porterhouse steaks on an entire beef loin - so don't get "skewered" into buying a "T-bone" at Porterhouse price!

I love Epicurious with all my heart and soul, but I expect more of them than giving us a recipe than telling, in detail, how to put salt on a hunk of meat and then cook it. This is as silly as Boiling Salted Water.

The recipe for the Broccoli Rabe & steak are in the June 2004 Gourmet Magazine pg. 130-134. Well worth trying. Also the grill tips in "The Thick of it" pg. 90 is worth the price of the issue.

The veggie in the photo is the broccoli rabe that is included in the Father's Day menu.

I couldn't find any porterhouse large enough so I found 2 t-bones. There was nothing "fancy" about this but the flavor from the sea salt and the drizzled oil (Which I infused with some fresh savory) made this steak delectable. Grilling was easy and I served it with fresh spinach sauteed with garlic and baked potatoes. Can't ask for a more "meat and potatoes" kind of meal. Excellect, a definite keeper.

Fabulous, I just got back from living and studying at a culinary academy in Florence and this really helped me get over the homesickness. Actually, Bistecca alla Fiorentina isn't outlawed. The EU found that Italy is pretty much mad cow free and it is still one of the most popular menu items in the area.

I believe the vegetable is sautéed broccoli rabe (or rapini) with thin slices of the lemon that was mentioned in the recipe. Any dark leafy green would do, though!

Where is the information on the spinach that is on top of the steaks in the picture? Great instructions on how to grill though!!

Rating: 4
Of course this is a great recipe, completely dependent on your access to a great steak. A pity the EU outlawed Bistecca Fiorentina due to health concerns. (Note: no spinach...that's not what "Florentine" means in this context.)

Looks great in picture, but am I missing part of the recipe? Is the salt the only "florentine" part of this? How do I make the great looking veggie?
