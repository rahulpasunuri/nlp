Chicken was bland even with a generous amount of sauce and salt and the flavor of the thyme was overwhelming in the sauce. Just wasn't worth the cava.

Made this for company this past week - very light and delicious. Chicken was very moist. Would definitely make again. I think fresh herbs for this chiken do it justice - that is what I used and it turned out just great.

Followed recipe exactly since novice cook. Came out fabulous! Everyone at my dinner party loved it! Served this with Saffron Rice Pilaf with Apricots and Almonds also from epicurious. Seemed to me an excellent match for the chicken.

I have made this many times for company. It is wonderfully simple, delicious and light. It smells fantastic as it cooks. Frexionet (the sparkling wine in the black bottle)is a modestly priced cava, and works just fine. Try it with an interesting saffron rice and green peas, or a vegetable paella. To die for! Note, you will not get a thick gravy from this recipe - just a light, flavorful sauce to mosten the chicken. Not being a big fan of heavy, thickened sauces, this is a plus for me.

Tried the recipe using an Australian sparkling red wine, changed the look and increased the taste some. Might lessen the time in the marinade and change the herbs around as well. My kids liked it though as it was.

Was an excellant Sunday dinner for guests. Serves with sweet potatoes mashed with cinnemon and green beans. Will definately serve again.
