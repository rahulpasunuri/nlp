This dish received rave reviews at Thanksgiving. I skipped the fennel seeds and added a little more cheese and cream. It was delicious!

This dish is awesome and easy to make. I like that it is unfussy-the potatoes do not need to be perfect and being able to just throw it all in the pot means I can make this more often. I use reduced fat smoked gouda and everyone loves this dish-easy enough for a week night, but unique for a special meal.

Are "scallop" potatoes supposed to be the same thing as "scalloped"?

This recipe is so easy and WOW! My husband found this a couple of years ago, and definitely a favorite.

Didn't follow this recipe to a tee, but it still turned out excellent. A week later, people are still talking about it. My husband says it was the best potato dish he has ever had. High praise from a non-meat eater who doesn't care drink milk. My changes - 1 - To cut fat but keep flavor, substituted whole milk for whipping cream. 2 - Thinly sliced leeks substituted for the fennel. I used 3. No fennel seeds. Lightly sauted leeks to soften, before adding potatoes to boil. 3 - Goat gouda. Very mild but luxurious flavor & texture. 4 - Salt & pepper to taste - a must! 5 - Baked longer - about 20 minutes because the potatoes were not done by suggested time. I would make this again, not doubt. I think the russet potatoes make the dish, as does slicing the potatoes the same width (I used a food processor to slice).

This recipe is scrumptious. I halved the potatoes in the recipe and cut back on the liquid (1 1/2 cup half and half only)to compensate, I also used about 6 ounces of smoked Gouda. I also added a thinly sliced shallot and about 6 thinly sliced baby bellos. I cooked all the veggies together in the liquid and then baked as directed. Can't say enough good things about this recipe. It was the first time I used fennel and really enjoyed the taste. I also par-boiled the potatoes (15 minutes)and refrigerated them (overnight) before slicing them, I learned about this trick recently and it works every time--no underdone potatoes. I found it a bit labor intensive but the end result is worth the effort.

Very good! I ate this with steak. It is very mild and I think it would be good with fish as well. I did not cover it and it turned out great!

I added salt and pepper to the recipe and substituted Edam for Gouda (as they are similar) but otherwise made no changes. Served it alongside grilled steak and a fresh herbed butter lettuce salad and it got rave reviews. A fantastic side dish, good for any time of year. This is going to become an easy dinner party staple.

I give this 3.5 forks. The fennel / fennel / gouda combination works really well, and this is an easy but highly satisfying dish to put together. I can't give it the coveted 4 stars because while I liked the surprise of the fennel and gouda combination, I'm not sure I could use this as a mainstay. It's totally a question of taste.

Made this to bring to Thanksgiving. I used all half and half, no cream. Everyone loved it- most couldn't figure out exactly what was different about the potatoes, but they loved it. Definitely a KEEPER.

An absolute party hit. A taste bud sensation. Marvelous recipe and easy too!

Fabulous!! Like others, I made this as a side dish with lobster and and rib for holiday dinner and the guys were raving about the potatoes long after they'd forgotten the meat and seafood.

This was such a huge hit at Easter. So wonderful with the smoked Gouda, wouldn't use any other kind. Everyone raved and thought it was the best part of the whole meal. Will definitely be making again.

This was excellent. I replaced the half and half to non fat milk to cut down the calories. I did not cover the potatoes with foil and it was perfect. The family loved it!!

I triple this recipe and make it every year for a New Year's Eve party. It always gets raves. If there is any left over we enjoy it just as much the next day.

Wonderful potatoes! Packe with flavor, even with regular Gouda, since smoked as recommended by former reviewers isn't available here. Love it anyway, as a veggie dish on weeknights or a holiday side. Definitely making again!

This went very well with a lovely rib roast. I didn't have the fennel seeds, so made it without.

Fixed to accomodate a vegetarian at a dinner party and everyone else went nuts over this. Two months have gone by and a few people are still talking about this dish. Wasn't sure about the fennel and gouda combination but it worked perfectly.

I also made this dish with smoked gouda. While it was delicious, mine looked more curdled than creamy. Anyone else have this problem?

The combination of Smoked Gouda and Fennel is DELICIOUS. Must have the smoked cheese and fresh fennel, not dried. I serve this at holidays and it never fails...the men go back for seconds and thirds and want to take home a doggy bag. A Winner!

This recipe is easy and tastes incredible. I made this for my husband's birthday with the pan-fried steaks with shallot-gorgonzola butter (which we grilled) and they were both excellent together. I'm making it again definitely! Enjoy!

I tripled it for a thanksgiving get together and everyone loved it, even those who claimed not to like fennel. It seemed to have too much liquid but once you take off the foil, it works beautifully and the dish ends up moist but not runny.

I made this recipe for my in-laws. We all loved it. Very easy to make. In fact, I made it the day before, put it in the fridge and then baked the next day. Turned out perfectly. The combination of whipping cream and half and half was great.

I served this with grilled marinated porkchops and it was wonderful! I had never made anything with fennel and served this to my husband, my college age daughter and her boyfriend and everyone liked it. Would definately make this again.

I have made this several times and just can't seem to go wrong no matter how many changes I make. I've made the lower fat versions, have added sauteed leeks, and have substituted a variety of cheeses. Smoked white cheddar or smoked gouda are the best. I always toss the shredded cheese with a little flour--too many runny potatoe recipes in the past.

I was looking for a recipe with gouda but I don't like fennel so I replaced it with fresh mint (had some in the fridge). It turned out fantastic. I only used about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped mint but the hint of that flavour with the gouda was excellent. Will definitely make it again.

I loved this dish. I did however use less of the Heavy cream and more 1/2 & 1/2 and used 1/2 regular gouda with 1/2 smoked gouda and found the flavor to be wonderful!!!

Rating: 3
I chose this recipe only because I had some gouda I wanted to use up. The combination of flavors (the gouda and the fennel) is surprisingly good. I pooh-poohed the instructions to cover the dish with foil though and regretted it as it spilled out from under the baking dish cover and created quite a mess at the bottom of my oven.

Excellent dish. Made at Easter and everyone loved it. Easy to make and "different". Made per original recipe but next time I'm going to try the lower fat suggestion of earlier reviewer to compare.

A very tasty side dish with pork.

We thought this was wonderful. I substituted fat-free half & half and 1% milk for the cream and real half & half, and I used Gouda brought to me from Holland. I don't know how it could have been better with all the fat the recipe called for.

I didn't have fennel around, so I used leeks instead, and also added a few sliced garlic cloves to the cream mixture while it cooked. It was absolutely delicious, and not overly rich. I just had some of the leftovers for lunch, and it's just as good the next day!

This dish is absolutely delicious. I made it for Christmas Eve as a side dish to beef tenderloin. Rave reviews. It did take longer than the recipe stated to cook so prepare for another half hour or so. I have already passed the recipe on to others.I will definately make it again.

An excellent addition to my Christmas dinner table. My guests love it and so did my potato-loving husband. I picked this recipe at the last minute and had to substitute a very nice cheddar for the gouda. I also cooked this dish 2 hours before serving and removed it from the oven and left it covered. Knowing I wanted to cook this in advance, I sliced the potatoes a little thicker and removed the cover and browned the top when I put it back in the oven before serving. I also topped the dish with chopped fennel greens. One thing that I would recommend is that you use a baking dish with higher sides as when this drips over it does create a messy situation even with a drip pan...a very smoky cooking area. I would not cut down on the cream or cheese but I don't think this is one of those "every day" dishes but a dish for special occasions.

I made this dish for a small dinner party this week-end and it was a big hit. I used smoked gouda which gave it a really nice flavor. It was easy to prepare and defenitely will be on a future meni.

We had Basic Pot Roast and Napa Cole Slaw with this (both recipes are available here). It was marvelous. My most serious problem is how to save the left overs (there are only two of us). Try it, you'll like it.

I only used 1 cup of Gouda and half the amount of fennel seeds and the dish was wonderful. We will make this again for sure.

Good flavor with the addition of the fennel and the gouda cheese was a nice change. This recipe is very rich, and I would cut down on the amount of cheese next time. Think half the amount would work fine.

Absolutely delicious, my guests couldn't stop talking about how "grubbin'" it was. Wonderful flavor. I wonder, though, if there's a way to cut down on the heavy cream...
