Meh, did anyone else have a hard time w/ their cream cheese layer not setting?

Terrific! I made this as a cake rather than as brownies. I used a springform pan and it worked wonderfully. I made a couple of very small changes. For the creamcheese layer, I doubled the amount of creamcheese and also added a bit of cocoa powder (about 2 tablespoons) and more of the espresso (1 tablespoon dissolved in .5 tablespoon of boiling water) to the creamcheese layer. This was the best part of the whole cake. Everyone said that part was their favourite and many people asked for the recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent! I've made it several times and it's always a hit. The brownies are also delicious with a peanut butter frosting.

Excellent dessert. My husband made these for a pot luck for the Fire Department and they were gone in a flash.

These were fantastic. I made two small changes-I love cream cheese frosting, so I doubled the recipe for that, and the topping was a tad too bitter for my taste so I put a tablespoon or so of corn syrup in it. I served it alongside some coffee ice cream and the old-fashioned mocha fudge sauce from this site. My friend told me it could have easily been served at any nice restaurant, and it's probably better.

This brownie is really good, however I found it to be really rich, as other reviewers have mentioned. I actually made half of the cream cheese frosting and only put it on half of the batch of brownies because I wasn't sure of how much I would like it. I then made the chocolate glaze over the whole batch. I actually wasn't a big fan of the glaze - I found it to be really bitter. So to make it a bit sweeter I made a cappuccino whipped cream frosting (1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tbl instant espresso dissolved in 1/2 tbl of water and a dash of cinnamon). This icing was amazing and complemented the flavor of the brownie perfectly. I would make this again but without either the cream cheese or chocolate .glaze and use my own cappuccino frosting Its soo good for any coffee lover. This is my first time ever writing a review but had to because I thought it would add to this recipe.

I have been making these for special celebrations since the recipe first appeared in '96. Use the best chocolate you can find (or order) - I like Valrona (Ghirardelli may be all that you can find in your grocery store - that's fine too). This recipe was presented for demonstration at Central Market's cooking school by Gourmet magazine to showcase their new cookbook (2004). You know it's got to be a good recipe to be highlighted for that event! Special note: since these are very dense, it is a bit of a chore to cut evenly and look perfect - presentable. Solution: use a warm, thin, serrated knife; wipe knife clean after each "line" is cut. Very rich (cut in smaller pieces - 48), very rewarding.

I am semi-famous thanks to this recipe. They call me the 'brownie gal'. I love these as does everyone who ever tastes one! Wonderful!

The perfect dessert for those who love chocolate, cheesecake and Starbucks ...best served chilled.Always a hit and never any left-over.

This is a bit time-consuming but not difficult by any means. I make it in a springform pan which makes it much easier to serve. You can typically find the instant espresso in a small jar in the coffee and tea aisle.

This was unedibly rich! There is nothing wrong with the recipe... I just didn't personally like them (nor did my husband). However, once I scraped the top layers off, we had great brownies. I would make the brownie recipe again and just leave off all of the excess... they are good enough to stand on their own anyhow. Am I crazy? Everyone else seemed to love these....

Well! I haven't tasted it yet, but was waiting to make it for the longest time because I was out of espresso powder. Also, I used the Sharffen Berger chocolate (70%) and it's coming out fine. Reduced the amount of cinnamon to 1/4 tsp. because family doesn't like cinnamon. Also, made the glaze in the microwave: in 4-cup measure, microwave chocolate and butter for 1min20-30 sec on HIGH, then add expresso mixture and cream and then just stir (and then you could microwave on normal for about 10 sec) and wait until room temp, then spread on. Anyways! Seems great! Looks great.

Very good and rich. Made it in 3 stages so it was not time consuming. Had no leftovers and everyone wanted the recipe. Didn't have espresso coffee so substitued regular strong black coffee and 1 tsp Kaluha in both the brownie and glaze mix. Yummy!

FANTASTIC! Stick exactly to the recipe and cut them in 36 squares. Definitely serve them cold. Its like little truffles. Enjoy!

Made these for my boyfriend's birthday, and he loved them. Wouldn't even take them to the office to share!

Fabulous and decadent! I've made these twice and received rave reviews. They freeze well (should you have leftovers), another plus. When I first saw the recipe, I thought it looked too time intensive, but found I just had to plan for three fairly short blocks of time, not in sequence. I also had been worried that the top glaze would be difficult to deal with, but not so. It was easy to get a perfect smooth surface. As a chocolate, mocha and cheesecake lover, I'll look forward to any opportunity to make these again.

Decadent!! All my friends love these brownies. Follow the recipe because any alteration will result in a different brownie that is not like what the recipe intends. Serve cold!!!

Incredible brownies! I've made them several times and received rave reviews. Be sure to chill the brownies before spreading the cream cheese frosting on, otherwise the frosting will seperate from the cake when cutting. Super rich so cut into 36 pieces.

This recipe took a while but these are the best brownies I have ever had. They are decadent and rich and everybody loved them.However the cream cheese frosting might be a little strange for some people but I love them.

These were the most-oohed-over item at two dessert parties I hosted. The cinnamon adds a subtle lilt that makes them more grown-up than your average brownie. They're easy to make and keep very well (in the fridge, of course).

I'm stunned. With all the rave reviews, I thought for sure this would be the recipe of all recipes. I hate to say it, but I hated them. No one else would eat them either. I did then try the fudge toffee brownies and discovered heaven. Thanks to whomever it was who recommended them. I'm in love with a brownie!

I've made this recipe twice and have gotten major complements each time. A dessert that definitely stands apart from the rest. I agree with another reviewer, cut the bars small since they are incredibly rich.

Spectacular! Not difficult, but a little time consuming. Not a dish you can make in 30 minutes to satisfy a sweet tooth, but well-worth it if you plan ahead.

Very good and very rich!! Do cut into the 24 squares. One bite is enough! A Keeper!

These were wonderful! I doubled the frosting which I probably wouldn't do again because it oozed too much when I cut them (the glaze was harder than the underlying frosting). These are similar to a mint brownie recipe that I've been making for years except for the addition of cream cheese to the frosting.

WOW - were these good!!! I made them for my sister's baby shower and they were a big hit! Had some substitutions though. Used regular instant coffee (couldn't find instant espresso), and chopped pecans intead of walnuts. Also ran out of bittersweet chocolate during the glaze step so used added 2oz semi-sweet in glaze to make up for the shortfall. Finally, I forgot to add the cinamon and vanilla to the cream cheese frosting, so I put it the glaze instead. Didn't seem to make a difference. Everyone was highly impressed. Will definately make again!

Nine desserts were prepared for a anniversary celebration dessert table. This is the one people raved about! I prepared the first and second layers, cut in half, then froze the halves in freezer bags for over a month. I thawed the brownies it in the fridge, added the topping, then cut into squares. The brownies were moist, very rich and delicious. I made one change by using General Food International Coffee's Italian Cappuccino instead of expresso powder. Diana

I love these brownies! I made them for the second time, using the 13x9 size version from the November 1991 magazine. I cut the brownie base in half and made two recipes of the cream cheese layer, one according to the recipe, and one without the cinnamon. I made one half according to the recipe and on the other half I put some high-quality caramel ice cream topping on the brownie layer, then topped that with the cinnamon-less cream cheese, then topped with the glaze. A friend of mine loves Caramel Frappucinos from Starbucks, so that inspired me. Delicious!

These brownies were great! I made them for my suitemates at college one night. I left them in the fridge and told everyone to help themselves...when I woke up in the morning, they were gone!!! I guess that says it all. I definately found that they were very rich, but as long as they were cut small enough, it was easy to enjoy more than one. Great brownie recipe and I will definitely manke them again.

This is not the best brownie I've ever tasted. Though it's not bad, compared with the one I like the most, this one is just so-so.

While I'm not a brownie fan, I made these for my husband who loved them. My father also raved about them, so Despite my brownie adversity, I wold make them again for the pleasure they brought to my loved ones.

These are incredibly rich, dense, chocolate-y brownies! I made them once with the cream cheese layer, and I loved them, but everyone else found them a bit too rich (I cut the pieces too large, and Dutch palates don't seem to be accustomed to the level of richness Americans want from brownies). The second time, I made them without the cream cheese layer, and they were also fantastic. Either way, you can't go wrong!

These are incredible! Have yet to find someone who doesn't like them. Extras: I toast the walnuts before adding, and use Guittard (sp?) bittersweet chocolate. I also use Vietnamese cinnamon. They are delicious--anyway you make them. I find they keep a good 5-7 days in the fridge--we prefer them slightly cold.

In my opinion, this is the epitome of brownies. Everyone at work loved them & wanted the recipe.

Rating: 4
Absolutely luscious! This is probably the most popular of all the dessert recipes in my repertoire. People at work even pay me to make them for their special events. ** The one change I make is to cut them smaller: one pan yields 36 brownies for me, giving more bite-sized pieces, which somehow encourages people to indulge, whereas larger pieces are sometimes more than a person might want. With smaller pieces, if one isn't enough, you can always have a second (and a third and ...) .

I have used this recipe many time since finding it. I have made it with instant decaf, instant espresso powder and also Have substituted Kahlua for the coffee, it seems any way it is a hit. I have made this for an intimate dinner as well as a banquet for 140 people.. This is a must try you will fall in love with it

My 14 year old daughter and I entered this recipe in the parent/child category of our hospital's pro/am chocolate festival for Valentine's Day and won! This recipe beat out all the other entries (cakes, pies, candy, cookies etc) in that entry level, and we received many compliments. These were easy to make, and we subbed instant coffee for the instant espresso with no detectable difference.
