These meatballs are incredible! I made the recipe as directed and found everything to be perfect. We bought the already finely grated Parmesan in the container, and that was pretty much the only substitution. One suggestion, if you're going to all the trouble to make meatballs don't put them on dried pasta! We made our own spaghetti and the combination was wonderful!

I made this after reading all the rave reviews, followed the recipe to a "t" and found it to be the worse spaghetti and meatball recipe ever, and what is with all that butter. The sauce tasted like stewed tomatoes with butter.

Really good! For the sauce, I used 3 cans 28 oz San Marzano tomatoes and just half stick butter- plenty rich and deliciously simple. Left out the parsley in the meatballs due to picky kids, but awesome just the same!

Do yourself a favor and double this recipe. It is so good you will want to freeze some. I change nothing except putting less butter (a lot less, but still some) in the sauce. It is rich enough by the time you cook the meatballs directly in it. Do not mess with the sauce! (Italian seasoning?!) This is essentially Marcella Hazan's basic tomato sauce and it is so delicious.

I thought this was a strange recipe when I first saw it (sauce recipe), but the reviews were strong and I didn't have a lot of time so I tried it. Bottom line- it really works!! It is simple, fairly fast, and really is good. The meatballs are good and pretty simple, but there are also a million other meatball recipes you could use too. Pick what works. The sauce process is what makes this for me- - surprisingly good (and easy- especially if you are short on time). I do add some crushed garlic cloves and some Italian seasoning to the sauce at the start and back off the butter a little, and that's it. So simple, we make Spag & MB more often than we used to!

Delicious!!! I am not a meatball person (or I thought that I wasn't) but I loved these as did my entire family.

Very Good! I used whole wheat pasta and it worked out well. I used 7% fat ground beef to keep the fat content of the sauce down. Dry bread crumbs are effective, just don't soak them in milk first.

This is THE spaghetti sauce recipe. Delicious. Meatballs are pretty good, but the sauce is a star. I sometimes use homegrown canned tomatoes instead of store bought, which you can imagine makes it even better, but this is still a 4-fork recipe with processed canned tomatoes. (don't be a prude about the butter. put in the full amount)

Rating: 4
wow, the best ever! only change I made was: cut onion up and kept in sauce, added a little garlic, used 1/2 the butter & used 1 can whole peeled tomatoes & can trader joes sauce. Bread crumbs I used the Trader Joes version in a bag (had them at home) I used turkey & beef and they turned out great.

Rating: 4
Making this recipe was my first time making meatballs, and it turned out to be both easy and delicious. Initially, I was skeptical about making the sauce with just canned tomatoes, since generally I find the flavor a little iffy, but I resisted tweaking the first time and it was delicious. I was also skeptical that the amount of meat would be enough for 6 servings, but after adding the cheese and bread crumbs, it was perfect. The only thing I really changed was to skip the parsley (I'm not a fan), but I think it still tasted good. (I also used panko bread crumbs, instead of making my own.) Would definitely make again, and often!

This is now the family favorite recipe. I have used dark turkey meat and while not as great as the original it works. Also, I cook the meatballs in the oven ahead of time and then warm them in a pan when we eat. We eat sauce and meatballs separately for my sauce-adverse 8 year old. It is a easy great recipe because it satisfies the kid, husband and foodie mom.

Rating: 4
Adults and kids LOVE this recipe for spaghetti and meatballs! The ONLY change I make is to add springs of fresh basil while sauce simmers, then remove it when I remove the onions. Love that the sauce is smooth (kid friendly) while still imparting nice flavor. I often make on winter weekends and triple or quadruple the recipe and freeze leftover meatballs in sauce into "family of four" size portions to use on weeknights. One of our very favorite recipes!

I have made these meatballs multiple times now and they are outstanding! I always use all beef. I do wonder how people incorporate those wet breadcrumbs evenly?? And I'm never able to squeeze any liquid from the soaked breadcrumbs... Love making meatball sandwiches with these!

Don't make the mistake I made: I used panko as I didn't have fresh breadcrumbs and I tossed them with the milk, which then clumped into dime-sized balls. I don't think the panko was a mistake, rather adding the milk. The flavor is good, but I overworked the meat tryng to get the bread crumbs to blend more evenly. Also, I doubled recipe and I think 4 eggs were too many. I would suggest 2 eggs if doubling and then determine if it needs one more after incorporating. It doesn't need 4.

Very good. I used San Marzano tomatoes-worth the extra cost-and a combination of veal, pork and beef. Cooking the meatballs in the sauce made it a bit greasy. Next time I will brown the meatballs in a separate pan before adding them to the sauce.

Wonderful dish, particularly the meatballs...moist and flavorful. I used panko breadcrumbs and it was delicious (can't imagine fresh would have been significantly better). Added some fresh thyme, just because it was around. Other than that, made per recipe and got rave reviews from kids and adults.

Wonderful recipe. For the cook from DC, it is hard to reduce fat without changing the flavor somewhat. We use a lower fat beef and skip the pork. Also we omit the butter in the sauce. It is still rich and delicious!

This recipe has quickly become a family favorite. I highly recommend it. For the meatballs, I use ground chicken breast instead of red meat and ground pecorino instead of parmesan. I substitute EVOO for half the butter. With the leftover meatballs and sauce, we've enjoyed sandwiches on crusty baguettes.

As a Gluten Free & Calorie conscious cook, I modified the meatball portion of this recipe with great success. Breadcrumbs - used Ener-G boxed breadcrumbs in same quantity but they absorbed all the milk so I just used extra at the end for rolling the balls. 8oz ground Beef + 8oz ground Turkey; 4 large garlic cloves-pressed; Brown rice pasta; Side Note: for the Sauce - I used a jar of Trader Joes plus some homemade vegetable marinara and although not very juicy, the meatballs cooked well all the same - 25 minutes. Superb.

The meatballs were very tasty, very moist and soft. I omitted the garlic since I already had some in the sauce (my recipe). It adds a lovely protein to my vegetarian sauce.

This review is only for the meatballs: Absolute perfection on a plate. So soft and pillowy, and exactly what I had in mind when I was struck with the craving! I had run out of bread crumbs and substituted (butter & garlic) croutons,which worked out perfectly. I added some oregano to the meat, but other than that stayed true to the recipe. I would definitely reduce the garlic next time, as we were struck with garlic burps the whole night (you might not consider this necessarily a bad thing, of course). We simmered the meatballs in some fancy jarred sauce since we were strapped for time (and had no tomatoes on hand) - the meatballs really make the sauce 1000% better. Will definitely be making this again!

This is the most amazing meatball and sauce recipe! My family loves it and we make it several times each year. I've tried freezing extra raw meatballs, and they fall apart in the sauce once I cook them. This is the best spaghetti and meatballs recipe!

Hands down, the best recipe for soft, delicately seasoned meatballs. They, in their buttery sauce will melt in one's mouth. Let's not go all out for the Mediterranean rosemary, thyme, oregano for each "Italian" recipe. After all, Northern Italy is also on the map! I will make this recipe many times over.

I made this as written except I only had 1lb of grass-fed ground beef and no pork for the meatballs. I have made a lot of spaghetti and meatballs and this is by far the best tasting, and strangely easiest to make, recipe. The meatballs are so tender and add so much flavor to the sauce. I vastly preferred this texture to the usual browned meatballs texture. By the way, to the people who say this sauce recipe is too American, the sauce base is almost exactly a Marcella Hazan recipe from the Essentials of Italian cooking. It's very Italian. It's not the typical Italian-American sauce with lots of herbs and an assertive flavor, which is what I think a lot of people expect with meatballs. I loved its simplicity and it is now in my recipe binder with my other favorite recipes.

This is by far the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made. The recipe is so simple. Like others have said, cooking the meatballs in the sauce makes all the difference. I made it last week and I'm going out to buy more ingredients to make a double batch.

These meatballs are exceptional. I made them as written and was impressed with their texture and taste. I used a different sauce recipe (Spicy Tomato Sauce from this website) and the meatballs flavored the sauce in a way that was unexpected and sublime. I have always baked my meatballs before putting them in the sauce, but will never do that again. Try this one, you won't be disappointed.

This was absolutely delicious. I can't get over how good the sauce was, it was very authentically Italian. I want to eat it every day. I used San Marzano tomatoes, which might be why (well, that and the stick of butter...). The meatballs were also fantastic. I also loved how easy it was. Other times I've made meatballs it has seemed like such a process to make them, then brown them, drain them, then add them to the sauce. Cooking them in the sauce kept them really moist and gave the sauce great flavor. I'm definitely going to make this again.

i've made this recipe three times now....absolutely love the sauce and the meatballs. certainly, you could change up ingredients in the meatballs a bit to your liking, but the simplicity of the sauce is profound... i wouldn't change a thing there. an absolutely beautiful dish.

I just made this recipe for a comfy New Year's dinner for my family. Every single component of this recipe comes together beautifully. The sauce is sweet and tangy, the meatballs are perfectly herbed and soft and velvety. I sprinkled in some red pepper in the meat mix, as well as into the sauce. I think this is a 'grown-up' spaghetti and meatball recipe...but still oh so very comfort-food. For the sauce, I used an imerssion blender and scooped out most of the onions, but left some smaller bits and pureed it with the tomato. Gives it nice dimension. Will use as a pizza sauce next.

Rating: 4
I've made this three times now, and all my guests have raved about it. Definitely use San Marzano tomatoes if you can find them. The lack of other herbs makes the fresh taste of the tomatoes critical. I'd recommend against browning the meatballs first, since they give the otherwise simple sauce so much depth of flavor as they simmer in the pot. Similarly, I like making this earlier in the day, so the meat and its flavorings can continue to enhance the sauce before reheating and serving.

i'm an ex-pat living in south korea. while i was in the states, i would get some major cravings for a simple and hearty plate of spaghetti and meatballs. you can definitely find pasta restaurants here, but strangely enough, not meatballs. so i decided to venture out and make my own. i tried this recipe and it really hit the spot. the sauce is plain (in a great way), rich and satisfying and the meatballs are very tender. i made meatball subs with the leftovers! i would definitely recommend this to anyone, stateside or abroad!

I was looking for a simple spaghetti and meatball recipe with tons of flavor to make for a dinner party. This is not it. The meatballs were pretty tasty, but the sauce was almost bitter. Very strange flavor. I used good quality tomatoes, and followed the recipe exactly. I ended up adding the meatballs to a jar of sauce (which I would not have even considered before but had to figure something out at the last minute).

LOVE this recipe. I use ground turkey and make bite sized meatalls. I start the sauce at the same time (I use a totally different recipe for sauce) and as I finish a batch of meatballs, I add them to the sauce to simmer and add flavor. I also scrape off the meat drippings and add that in. Let meatballs sit in sauce for about an hour.

I think this recipe is overrated. My husband, a pasta fanatic who has never met one he didn't like, thought it was just okay. We agreed that the butter neutralized the acidity of the tomatoes and made it taste rather like Franco-American.

Made this for dinner tonight - husband & daughter liked it alot, but I didn't care for it so much. The meatballs were excellent, but I didn't like the sauce. I think it was the butter; I didn't have any hesitation in using it, but I just think I would have preferred a different sauce. Next time, I'll try making the meatballs with Lidia Bastianich's Tomato Sauce recipe from this site which is similar in that it is a simple, non-garlic sauce but I much prefer that recipe.

We used the recommended ingredients and cooked it the way the chef showed us how to on New Day (King 5, NBC Seattle). It came out WONDERFUL. We also rolled our own pasta. It was a hit in our house. The kids loved it. We will add the recipe to our treasured recipe box. Thanks Cafe Lago!

Absolutely delish - MERCY! Tweaked it slightly the second time I made this (second time in two weeks ! lol !) To the sauce ingredients, I added a tsp of dried oregano, and I made sure that I used San Marzano tomatoes - what a difference! When prepping the meatballs, I used freshly ground Parmesan...not the pre-grated stuff. I wanted to avoid the strong raw garlic taste that I noticed the first time around, so this time I sauteed the garlic along with 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion in a bit of olive oil before adding it to the meat mixture. And, I lightly browned the meatballs this time before popping them into the sauce. This is *pure* comfort food bliss. : )

I was reading some earlier reviews, and saw the question about why you can't just use the already chopped tomatoes. There is a reason! Tomatoes that have already been diced by the manufacturer generally have calcium cloride added to them , which maintains the firm texture of the dice. So, no matter how long you cook them, they will never break down to be as smooth as whole tomatoes that you chop yourself.

This is best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever made! And this is after making my Italian great grandmother's recipe and cooking very ambitiously at home for nearly two decades. Definitely one of the better things I have cooked this year. About the stick of butter that people are subbing out for olive oil or reducing: Don't do it. You're not reducing calories by using oil instead of butter. And it is 8 T. of butter for 6 servings! This is hardly freakishly fattening. The butter really adds an important element to the sauce as it is cooking, and one of the reasons this recipe is such a winner is the particular balance of the meatballs (which add flavor to the sauce, too -- don't brown them first!) and the sauce. I can't recommend strongly enough using the sauce recipe and directions as written.

We made this recipe for a child's birthday. All the adults said the same thing, "not very good, but the children will like it". The taste of the sauce was so unItalian - buttery and goopey mild that only very young children could appreciate it. The meatballs were equally bland and lacked texture. Do not ever make this recipe for people who know what real Italian food should taste like.

To the cook from New Berlin OH - I hope you're not serious...."Epicurious Authorities"? Too funny! My other favorite little gem from your rant was "From now on you will follow every recipe exactly as it is written, changing NOTHING." You're just as bad as the people you're complaining about!

Wow, I was really looking froward to making this recipe, due to the great reviews, and I sit here baffled. It followed the recipe to the letter and I knew when the sauce was finished that it was not going to be that great, and hoped the meatball addition would help..it didn't. My Italian husband said the sause was close to Campbell's tomato soup and we found the meatballs to be a mushy consistancy. This is certainly edible, but NOT the keeper I was hoping for.

Great recipe. I had been wanting to try Marcella Hazan's recipe (exactly the same as the tomato sauce in this recipe, I think) and I was very happy with the results. I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have quite enough parsley. The meatballs were great, and cooking them in the sauce really transferred the parmesan flavour to the sauce, and the meatballs stayed perfectly round. The sauce was subtle in flavour but delicious - hubby ate spoonfuls right from the pot. The only changes I would make is less garlic (and I love garlic - but the meatballs tasted too much like raw garlic, even though completely cooked) and I would top with a bit of basil chiffonade to brighten the overall taste.

Really delicious meatballs! And the sauce is pretty fantastic, too. We absolutely devoured this for dinner. I had trouble squeezing the milk out of the breadcrumbs, too, but the meatballs still held together just fine. I was tempted to cook the meatballs first and then drain the fat out like another reviewer suggested, but I wanted to try the recipe as written first...I really think something might be lost in the dish by not letting the meatballs cook and simmer right there with the sauce. I don't know for sure though, and it would be something to try in order to decrease a little of the fat. Anyway, great recipe--I'll make it again!

Very rich and very tasty! Won't replace my regular spaghetti & meat sauce but still something I'd make again. Followed recipe as is except for browning the meatballs first.

To answer our friend from Canada, our system usually grade by a meat vs fat ratio. So 15% equals 85% lean and is equal to your medium. 80% equals regular, 93% equals lean and 95% equals extra lean. We also have a grade of Market which is what ever is leftover from cutting steaks, and could be a combo of chuck, sirloin etc. It usually is great on the grill!!

Good basic sauce. Very good meatball recipe. I prefer baking first. I know a cook that browns her meatballs in a iron pan, in bacon fat and olive oil. It's a matter of choice. A tip is to use a food scale to insure uniform size. They make a much nicer presentation.

Haven't made this yet but can't wait to based on the reviews I've read! One comment... many were concerned about the stick of butter in the sauce (i.e., fat & calories). I'm thinking I might make the sauce exactly as shown, but instead of adding the uncooked meatballs directly to the sauce I'm going to bake them first, drain off the fat and THEN add them to the sauce. That should eliminate a little more fat without sacrificing the rich taste of the butter. Plus they'll get nice and brown first... added bonus! Do any of you true Italian cooks out there think this will drastically change the taste?

What is ground beef with 15 percent fat? In Canada we label our ground beef as regular, medium, lean and extra lean. I am guessing the 15 % is maybe medium ground beef ? Thanks for answering !

OK - this?! Ridiculous! The amount of effort was about a 3, for a result that was easily a 9.5. Followed the recipe, except for adding a little bit of basil and oregano to the sauce. Not sure, though, that it was necessary, because the meatballs simmering added quite a lot of flavor to the sauce. Oh, I did brown the meatballs before throwing them in the sauce, because...well, they're meatballs. YUM! Outstanding. This will be a go-to recipe.

This was excellent and easy. I was surprised that the sauce was so good since it didn't have the conventional spices but it was very good and the meatballs are the best. However, I still haven't figured out how to keep meatballs from flattening when I cook them. They looked a little lopsided but tasted great.

This was delicious! I substituted 3 tbl olive oil for half the butter. The only perplexing thing about the recipe is that the 1/3 cup of milk was completely absorbed by the breadcrumbs, nothing left to squeeze out or wet my hands with. After removing the onions, don't throw them out -- find a role for them, they are yummy.

I made my own sauce but made the meatballs. They were EXCELLENT! Followed meatball recipe exactly as stated. I grew up on my mom's homemade sauce with pork chops cooking in it all day.

These really are the best meat balls I've ever had. Fixed the sauce as per recipe, good but I also added fresh basil and oregano.

The meatballs and sauce were great - the butter gave it a unique richness. I had fresh ground turkey on hand so substituted that for the pork and it worked well.
