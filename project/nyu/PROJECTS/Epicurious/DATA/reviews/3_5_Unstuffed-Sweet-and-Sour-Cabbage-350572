Really good use of extra cabbage from box delivery. Based on other reviews and making this a few times, I offer these tips: 1. start sauce first 2. sear cabbage before steaming. I like the reviewers suggestion to brown some chopped bacon and sear the cabbage in the bacon fat, then sprinkle bacon on at the end. very good. 3. Cabbage takes 15 minutes to cook. really. Enjoy!

I used this recipe as an inspiration for my own dish, which my husband declared "spectacular." (Happy face.) Recipe follows. My recipe used 1 pound ground beef, but the pork would be fine. I substituted 2 C Trader Joe's Organic Creamy Tomato Soup, and used 4 T seasoned rice vinegar instead of the vinegar & brown sugar. Also omitted the cranberries. Used 1/2 C cooked brown rice. Rinse and remove intact as many leaves as possible from the cabbage. Simmer in a frying pan in 2 C broth with one minced clove garlic for 5-6 minutes. Remove to a plate. Chop roughly the remaining cabbage and add to the broth: simmer until tender, 5-8 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the onions, meat, etc. as per the recipe (omitting the berries.) Add 2 T tomato paste, the cloves, 1/2 the paprika & the caraway to the meat mixture: add the rice. Remove the chopped cabbage from the pan with a slotted spoon & place evenly in the bottom of a 13 x 9 inch pan. Neatly place the whole leaves over this, spacing evenly (I managed 4 rows of 3.) Distribute the meat mixture evenly among the whole leaves. Mix the tomato soup, 2 T tomato paste, 1/2 t paprika, and rice vinegar. Pour gently over and around the "deconstructed" cabbage rolls. Cover with foil and bake in 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes.

Made this as written and it was very good! Even my husband and son liked it and my husband is not a big cabbage fan. I did substitute ground chicken for the ground beef to save some calories. Was very good.

I made this! I browned the cabbage in bacon grease first and didn't cook it as long as the recipe says. I also added soy sauce and Worcestershire to the meat sauce, and some soujouk (dry Armenian beef sausage) I had lying around. I did not like this at all! Then I realized -- I don't like stuffed cabbage. Never have. I intentionally made something I know I can't stand. I am dumb. My husband loves stuffed cabbage and he thought it was great. So if you like stuffed cabbage, and you're not as dumb as I am, and you don't go around cooking things you know you hate, you'll probably like this recipe a lot.

I reduced the cooking time on the cabbage but otherwise made the recipe as written. It was good. I would make it again if I had the ingredients on hand but wouldn't go through the trouble of buying them especially for this dish.

A nice, easy and comforting recipe for a weeknight. I changed a couple of things and loved it. I used apple cider vinegar, and chunks of apple instead of cranberries. Good stuff!

This is a great, easy way to enjoy stuffed cabbage. I added 2 Tbsp of Hungarian sweet paprika and 1 Tbsp of half-sharp Hungarian paprika.

I now have a great recipe for all that cabbage I receive in my produce box. I followed other directions and chopped up bacon, cooked in the pan, removed with slotted spoon, seared cabbage sections, then added broth and steamed for 20 minutes. I also made the meat sauce first so it would have longer to simmer. Added soy sauce to the meat sauce too. Husband loved the dish, 6 year olds gave it a "big thumbs down." But they are 6 year olds, it's their job to hate cabbage. All in all really nice and easy too.

Sorry but this recipe did nothing for me. Probably won't make it again but if I do , I'll cut the cooking time for the cabbage. Forty-five minutes turned it to mush.

This was easy to make but much too sweet.

I was surprised at how good this was. I followed another reviewer's recommendation and fried up some chopped bacon until crispy, then gently fried the cabbage, which I had sliced,in the bacon fat with lots of black pepper and a bit of salt until cooked. I then added the crispy bacon at the end. For the meat sauce, I used ground beef only and fresh, rather than dried cranberries. I also added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, 1 T of soy sauce to give it some depth, and the sweet/sour balance was perfect. However, I left it to cook on a slow simmer for an hour for the flavours to really blend. Kids loved it.

Very good and even better the second day! Totally agree with the other reviewers on reducing cabbage cooking time. Found it to be a little too sweet so will probably sample before adding the brown sugar in the future. Will certainly make again.

Tasty and a good way to use cabbage from the produce share.

I love this recipe. Very easy to make, the only suggestion is not to cook the cabbage for 45 minutes. It doesn't take that long to cook. Other than that, very delicious meal!

I made the recipe as written except I used two 14-oz cans of spicy cherry tomatoes. The sweetness with the heat was fantastic, and my family raved about it!

This was delicious.... however 45 minutes was too long to cook and the cabbage was over done to my taste. I think cooking the cabbage about 20 minutes while you make the sauce would be plenty long. The sauce is awesome! I didn't make the rice.

Delicious. Will make it again. Didn't have the pork sausage so we used Italian sweet sausages, very good. I think next time i'll try it with tofu and see what happens. The quarter head of cabbage was a bit much for her, half (1/8 of a head) of that was plenty for her. It was very tasty on our foggy cold winter evening dinner. We served it with rice.

I made as directed the first time and thought the cabbage was mushy, but the sauce was really good. I made it again and chopped the cabbage up, threw it in a saute pan with a little oil, salt and pepper and let it cook until crisp-tender. Then I put the cabbage and sauce over some white rice. Outstanding. One other change is I omitted the cranberries because I didn't have any. I thought the dish was sweet enough from the brown sugar. Bottom line - this is fast, cheap, relatively healthy, delicious and the leftovers heat up well. A new staple in my kitchen!

This was easy and delicious. Rather than pre-cook cabbage in broth, I fried 4 slices bacon (remove when crispy) and browned the 4 cabbage wedges on both sides in same skillet until golden brown. Remove; set aside in oven proof dish. Make sauce as directed (adding chicken stock at the end). Reduce slightly. Pour meat sauce over cabbage wedges; add back bacon and bake for about 1-1/2 hours or so (covered). This will be repeated and repeated! Thank you Gourmet!

I often crave the traditional stuffed cabbage dish my mother use to make, but just couldn't be bothered going through all the fuss-- when I saw this recipe I tried it, just as it is written, and found it to be extremely easy to make and so delicious. It will be a regular in my house and the aroma will take me back to my mother's kitchen.

It was just okay. I thought the entire dish was weird and the flavors didn't mesh right, especially with the cranberries.

This was an AMAZING Wednesday night dinner at our house. It was so easy to prepare even with a 5 year old and a 1 year old running around the kitchen. It was delicious and healthy and the kids loved it.

This is really a wonderful recipe with great flavors. my husband is vegetarian so we did half with Boca meatless crumble instead of the ground meat. We had a lot of fun cooking side by side-- i prepared my half with meat; he prepared his with the meatless crumble. Both of us loved the results. It's keeper.

Simple and delicious. I substituted dried cherries and golden raisins for the cranberries and completely omitted the beef for great results. If you like stuffed cabbage this is a great way to get the flavors without the fuss.

This dish is easy and delicious. It's a great weeknight meal. My husband was a big fan as well - I couldn't keep him out of the leftovers! The meat sauce is good too - you may want to make extra.

This recipe was very good. I recall the traditional stuffed cabbage my Mother made and this recipe sounded good and not as time consuming. My husband enjoyed it. I plan to make it again.
