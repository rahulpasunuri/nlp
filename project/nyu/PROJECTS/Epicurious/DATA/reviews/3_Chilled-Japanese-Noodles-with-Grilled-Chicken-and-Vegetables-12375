I thought this was very tasty and refreshing, and am craving it again a week after making it.

This dish turned out almost as good as the one I had in a Tokyo resturant. It is very different from a Thai noodle dish (e.g. peanut sauce-based) or a Chinese chilled noodle dish (e.g. Dan Dan noodle which is soy sauce-based). This light and slightly sweet noodle dish is best served for lunch. Try it with a hint of wasabi.

Not exactly what I had hoped it would taste like. Might try to make it again with a few modifications.
