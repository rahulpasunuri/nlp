I pasteurised an egg! The most striking things I found about this salad was that it tasted less fishy than it smelt, and it was very, very light. It tasted delightful, but even after eating with goats cheese toasts, I still felt I needed a proper meal! Next time I'll make it as a side.

This pulled together fast for an easy lunch. I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and it turned out great.

Right. A dish like this is all about the quality of ingredients. The recipe is really about putting together romaine, tomato, and first rate crab meat. What pulls it all together is the dressing. I suppose it is a classic for those who are trained, but I was glad to be introduced to it here. Yolk, vinegar, water, blender, olive oil. THAT I will be repeating many times. Glad to have stumbled upon this treatment of late Summer basics. :) And yes, at the end of the day, this was a killer lunch pulled together in less than 30 minutes. Don't disappoint yourself. Get quality crabmeat!

to the cook in NC, backfin crab meat is considered a lower grade crab meat that comes from the crabs legs. It is best in soups and as filler in crab cakes,as it lends a great crab flavor. Try making this again using lump meat from the crab. It's more $$ but well worth it, and you will end up with a delightful dish!

A very tasty salad and easy to prepare. Next time I'll use more chives. A "do it again" recipe for sure.

We did not enjoy this recipe. I used backfin crabmeat from the grocery store, so perhaps the issue was the quality of the crab.

This was quite good. Make sure you use the blender. This would also go beautifully with some sesame crackers or even whole-grain saltines. Quick, easy, and tasty! The flavour is light, so don't pair it with anything heavy.

This looks delicious. I will try it this weekend. It would be extremely helpful though if you could provide nutritional info.
