It was ok......not a true "mousse" in my opinion. I will be looking for other recipes to try. Sorry

Absolutely fantastic! Be sure to sieve the lemon curd immediately after its cooked. This makes it much smoother and creamier.

Amazing! I made this for two baby showers and am not allowed through the door at a potluck anymore unless I am carrying a bowl of this mousse! I skip the zest - just a personal preference.

I made this dessert for a diabetic friend, using SPLENDA in the topping, as well as in the fruit & she loved it!

Yummy! Perfect summer treat. Strained the lemon curd before I chilled it, to get rid of all the little pieces. Tons left over. Might work to use leftovers on a cake too!?

I served this in 6 large wine goblets, not eight. The servings, although generous, were not overly so. I did not add sugar to the fruit. My experience has been that juices bleed when fruit is combined with sugar, and I was concerned that the lemon mousse might discolour. The sugar was not required. I did, however, add some icing sugar to the piped whipping cream topping. I garnished with a fresh raspberry and a sprig of fresh mint and sertved with a raspberry shortbread. Lovely presentation and a refreshing summer dessert.

This is on of the most delicious deserts I have ever had! It was so perfectly sweet, tangy, and creamy. I followed the recipe to the letter except for the whipped topping; I added a packet of splenda to it, and it added the perfect touch of semi sweetness to it, otherwise it's a little bland. Other than that, it's pure creamy heaven.

Served at a dinner party and everyone loved it! Followed recipe exactly except only used blueberries as I had a ton of them-simple and delicious!!!

This was fabulous. Don't bother with the double boiler and the thermometer. Just cook it over low heat in a non-stick saucepan. Rave reviews; why make it so complicated?

Excellent flavor, but I wasn't wild about the texture of the lemon zest in the mousse. I felt almost like I should be chewing it. Anyone else have this problem?

You need change nothing to have great results. I suggest a microplane for zesting, the most time-consuming part.

I made this recipe for a family dinner for people who can never agree on anything. Well, they were unanimous. This recipe was a winner. There was not a bit of the lemon mousse left in anyone's parfait!

Wow. This was orgasmic. I loved, loved, loved it. Even my boyfriend couldn't stop commenting how good it was. I used half lime juice and lime peel since I had some limes laying around. Fantastic citrus combo!

This is a perfect dessert for summer. It's a breeze to make and no oven is involved! I took it to a group so I put it in a trifle bowl. It looked so pretty and everyone raved. Definitely a keeper.

This is a staple for us. Wonderful with Gingersnaps from Emily Luchetti's Four-Star Desserts. Made it once with Key Limes, which are a bit more tart so we used 2/3 cup of juice, and used lemon zest because the key lime zest is dry and has little flavor. It was excellent also.

Boy oh boy! I have died and gone to heaven. I made the recipe as is. It is not a light fluffy mousse, it is more like the texture of a creamy pudding. I wouldn't change the amount of sugar or lemon, because the contrast provided to the smooth cold mousse by the tangy lemon peel is sensational. This needs to be served in tiny portions and it needs berries. A few blueberries look pretty on top. I served this in little goblets after a jambalaya dinner. My guests nearly swooned at the table. Make this.

Although this recipe was easy to make and was light and creamy, to me it was WAY too lemony. You should really LOVE lemon if you are going to make this recipe.

I made a variation on this dessert which you might want to try if you need to bring it somewhere, or you just enjoy pies - Put the lemon mousse in a vanilla or shortbread cookie piecrust. I didn't have fresh berries on hand (but they probably would have been wonderful garnishing the top) so I garnished the pie with plain lemon curd along the edges (reserve some)and a dollop of whipped cream in the middle - made a wonderful end to an Easter dinner!

I made this for a group of friends. It was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I gave the leftovers to one person to bring home to share with her boyfriend. She wound up finishing it before he even knew about it. I'd definitely make it again.

This dessert may take some time, but it's all worth it when your guests rave about how amazing this mousse is! I've made it several times, using a combo of blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries, depending on the season, and it's always turned out brilliantly!

Rating: 4
A light, refreshing dessert that you can almost convince yourself is good for you because there's fresh fruit in it. I only used strawberries and blueberries and it turned out great.

I didn't really like this mousse...it was creamy heavy and did not have the texture, consistency, and lightness that I expect from a mousse. However, my guests seemed to enjoy it and it was fun to hear them say, in surprise, "Wow! There are berries under here!"

*MOAN* Oh!! This was amazing!! I would make this with a tad less sugar next time, I read the reviews that mentioned that...then I forgot! I used a little more lemon juice...about a cup of fresh squeezed juice from Meyer lemons. Simple impressive ending to any meal!

This was great! The texture was perfect. Here's what I would change: reduce the amount of sugar by 1/8 cup increase amount of lemon by 1/4 cup. My guests loved this and the fresh raspberries too!

I made this for my now sister-in-law's bridal shower and everyone absolutely raved about it. I had to tell all the guests how to look it up on epicurious, since I didn't have my computer handy!

Scrumptious! This was the grand finale to an Epicurious-to-the-rescue dinner (main course was the Spice-Rubbed Salmon), and it was truly a hit. Definitely use the thermometer method for the custard -- and be warned that the needle sticks at around 150 for a while, then SHOOTS up to 160. I layered this with berries from the garden (blueberries, raspberries, and currants) in highball glasses, stuck a sprig of mint on the top of each, and let the oohs and aahs roll on in. Not too hard, and a big payoff in both looks and taste. Yum!

This was a GREAT recipe! I loved it and so did my guests! I actually marinated the fruit in grand mariner prior to adding to the mousse. I also doubled the recipe so I could layer it in the wine glass parfait style.

Great! No problem at all with it setting up, and, it being winter, I served it with a cran-raspberry compote and a little softly whipped cream instead of the mixed berries. Really refreshing and good.

The most efficient way I know of to make a lemon curd is in the microwave. Use a deep glass bowl, cook at high power and whisk frequently. My microwave has a temperature probe, which takes the guess work out of knowing when it is done (although it was quite easy to tell when the consistency was right). Try it, you will soon say good-bye to the double boiler. Very nice recipe, guests were pleased (skipped whipped cream topping as mentioned by others - didn't seem necessary).

This is a very good tasting mousse. The first time, I served it as suggested. The next time, I made giant cream puffs and used the mousse as a filling. Yum!

Never made it before so them mousse took me forever to thicken up..I ended up letting the metal bowl heat up in the hot water and I was on my way with no problem. I wasted way too much time whisking it up without getting the bowl in the simmering water. It came out great. I don't think it really needed the extra dab of whipped cream on the top or the large strawberry for a garnish..mint would have been enough..seemed to be overkill. Would def. do again because it was a nice and attractive desert that I could make ahead.

This recipe was very different and exciting to the pallate. The mousse tasted a little off, which I suspect was due to poor lemon quality. I would definetly suggest spending a little more to the best quality lemons you can. I think if I had better ones the dessert would have been perfect. I used peaches and strawberries instead of the other fruit as it was all I had on hand. It was great (the peach/lemon combo is one you wouldn't think of, but the syrupy sweetness of the peaches goes marvelously with the tart lemon). Also PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING- it makes the dessert look EXCEPTIONAL. In a food processor, combine about 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 - 3/4 cup of additional berries. Process for about 1 minute to make a fine syrup. Drop a couple drops of the syrup in a staggered pattern on the top of the the mousse. Take a toothpick and gently swirl the syrup (don't overdo it). This creates an absolutely beautiful marbelized top and it takes about 2 minutes to do. Have your guests put their own whipped cream on top so they can appreciate the beautiful design (PLEASE TRY IT! IT LOOKS SO GREAT!!!!)

This is marvelous! Take the candy thermometer seriously. It's important to keep track of the lemon curd temperature. I skipped the topping of the whipped cream. It wasn't necessary and would've added unnecessary fluff.
