Only reason I rated this 3 forks was because of the many modifications to the original recipe. Made tortilla strips as suggested. Sauteed 1 c onion, 1 c carrots, 1 c green pepper and a healthy sprinkle of garlic powder. Added 2 cans chicken, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can black beans, 1 can corn, 1 small can diced chiles and spices: oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, flat parsley and juice of 1 lime. Brought all of this to a boil, simmered for 20 minutes or so before deciding to add 1/2 cup basmati rice. Boiled again and simmered until rice was done. Garnished with diced avocado, grated asiago cheese and sour cream. My husband loved it!

Excellent! Added a can of black beans and did do the tortillas...for me they are an integral part of lime soup.

This is fantastic....with a few changes to make it "heartier." I throw everything listed in the recipe as well as all the items below in one big pot and bring to a boil until the chicken is cooked. Add 1 can black beans (rinsed) Add 1 small package of frozen corn Add 1 squash (julienned or cubed) Add 1 zucchini (julienned or cubed) Add 3 - 4 raw, red potatoes (cubed) Add 1 can diced tomatoes Add 1 can Rotel (if you like spicy, get the "Hot" version) Add 1 can green chilies (if you have them on hand!) If you're lazy, feel free to skip the fresh bell pepper and white onion and go into the freezer section of your grocery store where they have "soup bases." There is a package with onions and red, green, and yellow bell pepper slices. It works great and saves time! I skip the tortilla strips...I think they get in the way of the soup! Sprinkle with cilantro, cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. Freezes beautifully!

I think this soup is fabulous! Very easy recipe to prepare. I added the black beans and corn as others mentioned. I added extra tomatoes and onion, one can of diced green chilies and red pepper flakes to kick it up. I used a store bought oven roasted chicken. A spoon of sour cream on top with diced avocado and fresh cilantro finished it off!

Too much trouble for the end result. Not a filling dinner. I don't think I will make this again unless it is for a first course for a mexican themed dinner party.

I love this soup it smells so good cooking . I have learned to make it very easily with pre cooked chicken breast strips and the mexican chopped tomatoes is the can. I have found these fab tortilla strips from fresh gourmet that work out just great. I do use all the fresh herbs though and it is quick and yummy. My kids crave it.

I added extra lime juice, used Lizano sauce instead of vinegar, and threw in corn and black beans to stretch the soup. Lots of raves from this one... was just like tortilla soup from a good Mexican restaurant.

Very yummy and light - a good soup for warmer weather because it is not too hearty. I added corn and black beans to the broth (with about 5 minutes left to simmer). I also topped the soup with cubed avocado for a nice presentation and great texture. This is a definite keeper!

I used dried oregano, added a teeny can of corn kernels, and scraped the sauteed tomato-chicken-onion mixture into the broth and simmered it all together, rather than the plating method suggested in the recipe. I served it with shredded cheddar in the bowls and the homemade tortilla strips, which were great (as is anything fried and salted, I suppose) -- the fiance inhaled them. All in all the soup was good -- especially if you're looking for a bright lime flavor -- and serves as a good "starter" recipe. I'd probably make it again with the above changes.

This is so delicious! Great year round, healthy, tasty, simple dish. There are a lot of similar recipes on epicurious, so I made some adjustments based on things I liked in other recipes. This first time, I used a store roasted chicken carcass, and made my own broth, but in the future, I will just poach some chicken breasts and serve them up with some spiced stock and the rest of the ingredients. Used canned tomatos, and added frozen corn to saute. For serving, garnished after adding the broth with chopped avocados and tortilla chips (from a bag). The lime makes for a fantastic soup and these flavors just create a delightful palate. I will definitely make again!

Awesome & light. Now my favorite soup.

This soup was fantastic! It's almost identical to the soup served in a very popular Mexican restaurant by our home, only they use mushrooms instead of chicken. I skipped the peppers and served it with a generous portion of a shredded Mexican cheese blend, but it would be wonderful with out it.

Like other reviewers suggested, this is a great soup with a few modifications. I used 3 fresh (not frozen) chicken breasts-halves,poached ,cooled, and then shredded. I used the brand Red-Gold diced tomatoes with chiles-Hot version. This really added a kick. Then, I added a small can of tomato sauce. Served with cheese and strips of corn tortillas-fried. I liked it over other versions because it is a broth base and not a cream.

This is a terrific soup! I have to admit that I was a bit unsure at first-- the recipe seemed too easy and didn't have a lot of ingredients, so I thought it would be bland. The good new is I was wrong! And do take the extra time to make your own tortilla chips as the recipe suggests. They're so much better than the bagged kind. I added corn and chili peppers just because I had some on hand, but the dish doesn't need them to taste great!

The recipe turned out PERFECT! I served it to a group of friends and they loved it.

Followed the recipe exactly. Very mediocre. Gotta be better tortilla soup recipes out there! It was fast, which was nice, but no one said much about it.

This turned out to be fantastic! I left out the oregano and the bell peppers as neither appealed to me with the other flavors. I added a bit more chicken and cilantro, used crushed tortilla chips, and served it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. It's a hit with everyone who's tried it--even my dad who doesn't care for the flavors of Mexican food gave it a thumbs up!

I thought this soup was fantastic, as did my family. Since it was a warm, summer day, I decided to grill the vegetables and chicken breast rather than cooking over the stove and the results were exquisite.

This recipe has become a household favorite---literally almost once a week. I make it exactly as the recipe states.

This soup lends itself well to adaptation. Missing limes, I used lemon, of which I had plenty. Couldn't find good zucchini, so used sliced celery. Canned tomatoes were better than the fresh ones in the market, so used canned. Still delicious. Even used store-bought tortilla chips, as we had some that had to be used. My husband, born and raised in Mexico, asked me why I don't make soup like this more often.

GREAT recipie. I added more chicken and used it as a main dish. I also used low fat corn chips and crumbled them over the top instead of frying the tortillas. Great low fat dish. Have made it several times and it is a favorite!!!

Delicious, fragrant, easy to prepare and reliable. Just about everything you can ask for in dish.

Sooooo easy and delicious. I baked the corn torilla strips on a baking sheet to cut down on fat, works great. I think we used a whole green pepper because we put 1/2 in our mini chopper and it really whooshed it into juicy mini pieces so we diced the remaining 1/2; added a little more tomato too. Also, would add a little more chicken next time. Put chopped avocado in the soup bowls just before serving. Terrific!

Delicious! This is almost an exact replica of what we've had in Cancun and Puerto Vallarta. It's a special request from our daughter that my husband loves to make for her.

Fantastic soup with zing! I've made it twice in one week we loved it so much. I used the 2 Tbls of lime juice, plus another teaspoon or less that was left from squeezing my lime (didn't want to waste that lovely juice). The first time I made this as a meal and would probably add another chicken breast if serving as the main course again. The second time it was a starter and I used only the veggies - left the chicken out of the saute entirely. Still great! We liked the tortilla strips so much that I made them with 4 tortillas the second time (thus doubling them). Garnished with sour cream and chives.

Loved it. Be sure to make your own tortilla strips if you possibly can; they are far better than store bought chips. Nice light soup for lunch or to begin a dinner with.

Excellent! This soup is very good and easy to make.

This was light, packed with flavor & delicious! I used red pepper instead of green, and added a small amount of hot pepper jack cheese as suggested in two reviews. I also sprayed cooking spray on the tortillas, sprinkled hot chili powder on them, cut them into strips & baked them instead of frying them in oil. I substituted flat leaf parsley for the cilantro, because the fresh cilantro available here is way too pungent.

This soup is great! This is the taste I was looking for. I would personally use only 1 tbs of lime juice, and I suggest not cheating with store bought tortilla chips. There is just no love in store bought chips! Besides, making the strips is not hard at all. I also garnished with cubed avocado and shredded colby-jack cheese.

This was great. A nice simple summer weekday soup with bright flavors from the lime and cilantro. I used a yellow pepper for color and the sweeter taste.

Loved this recipe. I added mild diced green chilies instead of green pepper, and doubled the oregano and left out the cilantro (my husband doesn't like it). I crave it now, and will have to make it again soon.

In the words of that character on Saturday Night Live, "Love it, Love it, Love it!" This is a definite repeat in my household. I make the following suggestions: add slices of avocado and dicd jalapenos. Also, The soup is great when strained through a sieve. Refreshing. Thanks Gourmet!

This a fantastic soup, tasty, light and refreshing. I have made it several times to rave reviews. Good quality store bought torilla chips are an ok substitute if you don't have time to make the strips. If there are any leftovers, this soup re-heats nicely for lunch the next day.

Wonderful soup, very light and refreshing. I added more chicken than specified in the recipe. This is an easy dish to prepare which makes it even more appealing.

I loved this recipe. I added some corn and doubled the cilantro amount. I also lightly dusted the tortilla strips with cumin which my family couldn't resist popping in their mouths before they were even put on the soup! It's a light soup that is great for the summer.
