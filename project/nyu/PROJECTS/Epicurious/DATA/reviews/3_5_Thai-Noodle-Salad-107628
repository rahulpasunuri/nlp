Yum. I now have to "pad thai" style recipes, one traditional and this for a sweet nutty change, with rice noodles of course.

Rating: 4
Okay, so I made some changes. I cooked rice noodles instead of linguine. I omitted the mung bean sprouts and added shrimp instead. I also served it hot rather than waiting for things to cool. This was phenomenal! I used Tabasco sauce at the end to spice it up. I will definitely make this again.

A bit bland so I added more peanut butter and sesame oil. I used coconut oil to saute onions etc., sesame oil is NOT for high temperature cooking. Also added red pepper for color.

The Thai noodle recipes from Kraft Foods are superior to this one. Bland, fatty without flavor, and disappointing. My boyfriend could hardly come up with a polite compliment. Of course I let him off the hook.

This is a delicious sauce for noodles. Fragrant and very flavorful. I have now made this twice and with a few adjustments it was excellent the second time. I adjusted the following: changed the type of pasta to a Japanese soka noodle but I think angel hair pasta would still work well, slightly less noodles for more flavor from the sauce (I thought 12 oz absorbed too much sauce),2T of seasoned rice vinegar because I didn't have Unseasoned, added half a red pepper sliced (as suggested by others). we made this with the Coconut milk soup and it was a great combo!

this is amazing. I thought it was going to be a sort of shabby knockoff, not using rice noodles, but WOW. No. I did an emergency substitute for the sesame oil and used 3 T. peanut oil, 1 T. olive oil.

EASY and DELICIOUS side or main dish (could easily add pork or chicken if you wanted). I was just looking for a use for my bean sprouts leftover from another recipe since they go bad so quickly and I'm never quite sure what to do with them. My husband really liked this too, as did my toddler even though he said it was "pice-ies" (spicy).

A good meal. It's not really Thai -- there's no fish sauce, no dried shrimp. And then there's the sesame oil -- perhaps it's more Szechuan? But no matter, it hits the spot on the right day. I make this for potlucks and it's always popular, especially when I add a little extra Garlic-Chili sauce. Last time, I made a little more sauce than needed for the noodles and added a lot more carrots, bean sprouts, and onions. It made the noodle salad more substantial. I also used whole wheat linguine noodles this time, which added to the flavor and texture.

The taste was just ok. I guess I like more peanut butter flavor.

This was a hit with family and our international dinner group. I could not get chili garlic sauce that day, so used a Thai marinade that is similar, used half the honey and added several dashes of hot sauce. Also added small pieces of broccoli that had been boiled less than a minute. My daughter added shrimp & had it for dinner--excellent.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now, and it is always a big hit. I use dried thin noodles instead of pasta, and usually don`t have the bean sprouts, and so usually finely slice some red peppers through.

Love this recipe...great heat and simply the best peanut sauce recipe that I have found. This is also a great recipe to alter to your personal tastes by substituting your favorite vegetables, but I highly recommend the mung bean sprouts for a nice crunch. We always add about a pound of fresh gulf shrimp...mmmm!

Rating: 4
this is one of my favorite dishes. I have made it more than once. I have even made it without the soy sauce and the bean sprouts because they were simply not on hand at the time and it was still great but all ingredients is a must when possible. I see this recipe and my mouth waters!

Rating: 2
I made the dish for the first time yesterday, using rice noodles and garnishing with roasted peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Like others, I also tossed the noodles in 1T sesame seed and 1T vegetable oil. Although the recipe had great potential, it was much too hot for myself and my guests. Everyone agreed that they would have preferred less chili-garlic sauce so that we could taste the other flavors a bit more. If your guests enjoy hot food, this dish would probably seem mild, as is; but for people who don't enjoy much heat, I recommend cutting the chili-garlic sauce to 1 tsp.

Like others, used rice noodles. I'm asian and grew up using dark (toasted) sesame oil very sparingly because the taste is so strong. I only used 1 T. sesame oil plus another 1 T. vegetable oil to coat the noodles. I also didn't like the idea of 'cooking' the sauce so I kept it very brief and added the green onions off-heat. Didn't have bean sprouts, but added blanched (1 minute) brocolli florets and added some julienned red bell pepper as suggested by others. Roasted peanuts and cilantro were very good. Was very pleased with the results. BTW - not very kid-friendly (too busy), but I also made another cold noodle dish (for kids) alongside this one - 12 oz. 'chow mein' noodles cooked and tossed with sesame/vegetable oil and the sauce was simple (2 T. sugar, 4 T. oyster sauce and 3 T. soy sauce). Sprinkled on some sesame seeds. Flavor was good, but my picky 4-yr old complained about the sesame seeds.

This was pretty good - actually a little bland for me. I think I'll try adding cilantro as another reviewer mentioned.

The sauce is awesome..and full proof everytime. Used ground, honey roasted peanuts, missed the soy sauce, and never even really measured any of the ingredients and it's still good! Also, added fresh baby spinach and used soba noodles.

very good, I used rice noodles(Traders Joes). I found the noodles to be very sticky - and I used all the sesame oil plus sauce. Lots of compliments.

Rating: 3
I agree with previous reviewers - using the linguini was a mistake. The sauce would have been best on rice noodles, or even a thinner spaghetti (I couldnt find the rice noodles in trader joes). Also, cooking the ginger didnt sit well with me. I think raw ginger would have added a fresh taste to the dish. I also added sliced raw red pepper (as previously suggested) which made it taste nice and refreshing. Overall, a pretty tasty sauce if you make some modifications based on your taste.

This dish was lovely. I was a little concerned with other reviews saying that the noodles were a bit sticky so I rinsed them well in cold water after cooking and I used the recommended amount of sesame oil to coat. No stickiness. I couldn't find fresh bean sprouts so instead of ruining the dish with canned, I substituted with cucumber. Seemed to be a nice alternative. Thanks for a delightful recipe. Will be making this again, often.

I made this recipe for a group of "foodies" and everybody raved!This is 4 forks with the following adjustments as per other critiques. I used rice noodles, linguini size, and boiled them for 5 minutes. After rinsing I tossed with 1T sesame oil and 1T veg oil. I also added vegetables to the boiling noodles in the last 30 seconds (Zuchinni and broccoli). I julienned red pepper to add along with the grated carrot and garnished the dish with ground peanuts (unsalted) and lots of chopped cilantro. I served with lime wedges. To manage time I made the sauce and prepped the veg the night before. An hour before company arrived I cooked the noodles and tossed it all together to allow for flavors to blend. A nice option to the much more caloric Pad Thai.

Yum! I have made this recipe twice now and we love it. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added chopped bell peppers. We didn't have any chilli-garlic sauce on hand, so I just added some cayenne pepper and it gave salad a nice kick. I also added some mandarin oranges, chopped peanuts and cilantro, which added a nice flavor. Not sure about using Linguine, but I've made it with wide rice noodles once and with vermicelli another time. Both were great!

Rating: 4
We enjoyed this as a main course, with a few changes. We threw some green beams into the pasta pot for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking. We also sliced some red bell pepper very thin, put the slices at the bottom of the colander, and drained the pasta over them (cooking them just enough with the pasta and water). Lastly, we stirred in a good handful of fresh cilantro and some fresh lime juice, and topped with some chopped peanuts. Definitely recommended and a great vegetarian main course.

A great basic dish to then add on to, plus it is simple to make. I added Thai style saugage from Whole Foods to make it an entre. Also added some fresh tangerine juice and then substituted the tangerines for the carrots. I also juliened cucumbers and topped with Cilantro.

This is a dish that benefits from being made a day ahead. I prepared this for a Father's Day potluck, and the small amount that didn't fit in the serving bowl, I had the next day, and enjoyed it more. For those of you who commented on how dry it was after applying the sauce, this is why the 4T. of sesame oil helps to to coat the pasta so that it doesn't absorb all of it! I did make make 1.5X the sauce just in case, but didn't need it. You might keep some of the pasta water and use it if it still needs loosening up. This salad doesn't need to be swimming in sauce! I added the raw chopped scallions at the end. Also used tamari in place of soy, 1/2 ea. of rice vinegar, and lime juice and additional veggies such as slivered snow peas, and red pepper. Nothing like pad Thai, but delicious on it's own.

Terrific dish. I used rice noodles instead of linguine pasta. (This is my preference, but in case you're planning to store this dish a while before eating, rice noodles may dry out a little.) Also, it was enough to use only 1 tablespoon of sesame oil for tossing the noodles/pasta -- 3 TB would have been a little excessive. I did use a full 2 tablespoons of the chili-garlic sauce, and almost doubled the sprouts and carrots. I also squeezed in some fresh lime juice when mixing in the sauce. In the future, will try adding mushrooms, stir-fried tofu, and chopped peanuts.

This was a fabulous dish! It has lots of flavor and texture. I garnished it with sliced scallions, some chopped raw peanuts and a spritz of fresh lime.

This dish is phenomenal. It has a wonderful blend of flavors (chili, garlic, ginger, peanut) and a great creamy texture.

I made this recipe for my cooking class who requested a Thai dish. I added 30-40 ct fresh Texas shrimp stir-fried in peanut oil. The onion mix was stir fried in peanut oil as well. I used wide rice noodle that were ready in just 6 minutes in warm tap water. I backed off 1 tbsp of sesame oil, a full 2 tbsp of chili garlic, and added crushed unsalted roasted peanuts to the garnish. I got Thumbs Up !! all the way around and will definitely make this one a keeper for future dinner parties. Thanks again, Chef Greg.

This recipe is fantastic served hot right away or cold as leftovers. The first time I cooked this I used rice noodles to make it more authentic. Tasted great but those are a bit expensive, so I switched to brown rice which is cheaper AND healthier. I am definitely using brown rice from now on (3 cups dry is the right amount for the sauce). I've also thrown in chinese mushrooms, baby corn, and baked tofu.

Wonderful flavor and quite easy to make. I used mixed frozen stir fry vegetables in place of the bean sprouts and sauteed all of the veggies together with the green onions.

I made this on a Thursday exactly to recipe, except I added chopped red bell peppers and blached broccoli. I threw it all in a ziploc bag and took it on the boat for part of Saturday's dinner. Wow was it good - and not a drop of it was left. My friends were still talking about it the next day. It's key to keep the noodles a firm al dente so it doesn't loose it's texture. The spice level was perfect for us, and I think 2 tablespoons of sesame oil would have been adequate to coat the noodles. Excellent dish - and tolerates being made in advance well. What could be easier? Try it - you'll look like a star!

I made this dish for a picnic on the lake in a friends boat on a hot Texas Sunday. I thought that 5 cloves of garlic was overkill, even for a garlic lover; so I used three, it was plenty. I substituted Udon noodles instead of vermicelli and believe it or not, I could not find any mung sprouts in three grocery stores, so I julieened some cucumber and added thin strips of red pepper for color. We all loved this dish! Even my husband, who can be rather picky. It traveled well in ice and was delicious served with my friend's Grilled Korean chicken and fresh slices of cantalope cooled our palettes. YUM!! It made the 97 degree day very enjoyable.

I would really give this a 3.5 if possible. The flavor is wonderful! It was a little too spicy for me with all the garlic and chili paste, so I will reduce that next time.

This looks so beautiful with all the different veggies, and the sauce is wonderful!

I've made this recipe countless times since I discovered it awhile ago. I like to eat it cold, so I leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours before I serve it.

Delicious!

I added strips of red and yellow pepper to the dish and reduced the amount of bean sprouts. I didn't have chili-garlic sauce so I added Chinese garlic paste and a teaspoon of sugar which was a perfect substitute. This is a WONDERFUL recipe! The flavours run very deep and it's even better on day 2!

I used a 14oz package of rice noodles. I used a wok and 1 T. of peanut oil to stir fry one pound of large shrimp. Put in bowl with cooked noodles. Then I doubled the sauce, followed the cooking directions, and added the juice of one lime at the end of cooking. I also found some fresh baby corns at Trader Joe's and microwaved those, cut them in half and added to the salad. This is very tasty, and is cooling for dinner. Permanent keeper.

Added snap peas, crimini mushrooms, leftover cilantro/chili/ginger spiced grnd turkey from homemade potstickers, raw finely sliced cabbage and turnips. Was delicous when first hot. The sauce is amazing. However, when I simmered it, it thickened and took on a different flavor that I didn't like as much. Did sauce in food processor and would simply toss rather than simmer (perhaps it was my all natural peanut butter). Looking forward to trying it cold at lunch today too. Garnished w/cilantro.

I can't fairly rate this recipe (except for the sauce which is good if a trifle sweet) because of changes I made. But my changes were good ones and I want to share them. I used wide rice noodles instead of linguine. Three cups of vegetable are called for. Mine consisted of carrot, cucumber, green pepper, and celery, all in small dice except for the grated carrot. The leftover salad was just as good as when freshly made, perhaps better.
