This was quite good. Followed pretty much as written -- mushrooms were lovely and vinagrette was good too. Only change was that I zapped the escarole for a few secs in micro to wilt it a little bit more.

My wife made this for Valentine's day and it was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. It has a nice combination of flavors and textures. She used a very nice cognac in place of brandy. Just superb!

We used spinach instead of escarole. Absolutely delicious.
