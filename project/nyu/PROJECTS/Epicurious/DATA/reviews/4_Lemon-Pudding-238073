Not only is it fun to serve "soft boiled eggs and toast" for dessert it is DELICIOUS. Cutting the egg shells was the most diffucult part of the entire recipe. I filled the eggs with the pudding and curd by putting them in separate sandwich baggies and pinching the pudding and curd thru a small opening at the corner. The "toast" was also very easy and delicious.

I only made the lemon curd portion of this recipe as I was looking for a way to use up leftover egg yolks, but WOW, this lemon curd is amazing!! And incredibly easy - like 10 minutes total. I ended up topping the cheesecake tart from elsewhere on the Epicurious site with the lemon curd and it was a huge hit at a dinner party. YUM!

When I first saw this recipe I was totally intimidated by the whole "trompe l'oeil" thing. While I'm sure that is terrific for guests, it really isn't necessary to enjoy the flavor of the lemon pudding and custard. I substituted individual ramekin dishes for the eggshells, and I thought it was terrific. 3 teenage boys eyed it suspiciously, but ate it up! I thought it was terrific.

What I really want to know is how the lady from WA got her husband to go shopping for her at Sur La Table, bring home not one but two options even though one was far less expensive. Is she that good of a cook? :-)

This was very good tasting as well as a stunning presentation. I served only one egg to each guest since everyone is always saying no dessert for me. They ate every drop. I told my husband I was having trouble taking the tops off the eggs and he went to Sur la table and bought two egg toppers, One for about $5 and one for $50. I have to say the $50 topper does the best job once you get the hang of how to work it. I am planning to make this again for a dinner this week.

Everyone loved them, adults and children. I made them for a baby shower. Be carful to watch the pudding as it cooks. Mine got a little brown on the bottom which did not comprimise the taste but altered the apprearance slightly. I used the left over eggs to make a quiche. I had a lot more lemon curd than was needed but it made a nice topping for a chocolate cake served at the same meal.
