Not impressed with this at all. It was time consuming and not all that interesting. The cream cheese mixture was very, very good on it's own, so I might make that again to use with another dish, but I won't make this again. There are too many other simple recipes yielding delicious results to waste my time on this.

Very good, though shaving the daikon can be a little tricky. I also tried spreading the cream cheese mixture on hearts of endive, which worked well.

This recipe was a huge hit at a party I recently attended. It took me a few spirals to figure out that it's much easier to spread the filling if you dab at the daikon with a paper towel first to give the filling something to stick to. This is definitely something I plan to make again!

This was a wonderful, fresh tasting recipe, except I can't stand dill. I will do it again using very good italian parsley or maybe some cilantro or chervil.
