This is a brilliant, and simple, potato recipe! My husband, who is Vietnamese, normally doesn't like my potato dishes, but he LOVES this one -- I usually throw in about a tsp of dried hot peppers to spice it up a little. For the previous reviewer, try slicing the potatoes thinner! If you cut them about 1/8 of an inch thick, they'll cook up quickly and perfectly every time. If you cut them thicker (say a 1/4 inch) they'll take forever to cook! Great recipe, I make this just about every week ^_^

This recipe is very easy and flavorful, but the potatoes don't cook. They are extrememly dry and with no liquid or fat, they never cooked. The bacon and onions were delicious, but the potatoes were raw. We cooked them considerably longer than the recipe recommends and were forced to add a little chicken stock to aid in cooking and prevent too much sticking to the skillet. I love the idea of them, but I will not make these potatoes again.

Full of flavor. No adjustments to the recipe needed. This is a great side dish for summer, and it would also be great with a brunch. To dice the raw bacon, I used my kitchen shears - worked great.
