Flour measurements in volume (cups) can be problematic in baking. Pros use weight, so I tried 12 ounces of flour, which is the equivalent of 2.5 cups by most cookbook conversions. Works beautifully!

I stumbled on the video for this receipe first and knew that I had to make it! I've made it 3 times in the past 3 weeks! I used grape seed oil instead of the truffle. WIll have to invest in some so I can experience that flavor. The first time I made the dough, the consistancy was perfect! Next 2 time - runny - but ended up just as good. Incredibly delicious recipe! And Easy!

I don't bake/don't have the equipment so I cheated. I used Boboli crust and while obviously my product was chewier, the flavors were delish. Everything I made the same (oops--fat free sour cream for the creme fraiche too). I will be making the truffle creme/cream for many things from here on in. Seriously, my result makes me have to encourage others who don't want to make the flatbread to cheat too. It really was yum!

There is NO WAY that flour/water ratio is right. All you will end up with is a soupy mess. For one cup of water, you will need a bare minimum of 2-1/2 to 3 cups of flour to make a dough that is manageable and 'slightly sticky'.

UM Yumm! So easy and packed full of flavor. Athough I didn't use truffle oil, a good olive oil was a nice substitue. Also due to time constraints, I purchased a nice quality flat bread from my local market and baked it pre topping for about 3-5 min. at 350. Also was a great lunch left over. Would be a great accompaniment to an herb salad.

This recipe was an absolute HIT! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. I will definately be making it again My family loved it!

I had no problems with this recipe. YES, the dough is very wet, but it did form a ball and act the way it should. I modified the dough recipe by adding a teaspoon of oregano to the mix. NICE flavor add. Changed oregano to basil and it is equally tasty. Last modification was 1/4 tsp anise to the dough. Real contrast of flavors with toppings. Not to everyone's taste, but I like it. I also add either a few pine nuts or peeled sunflower seeds to the topping. Cook them with the mushrooms.

I prepared this flatbread exactly as the recipe directs and although the dough was very runny and hard to work with, it turned out great. I poured it onto a cookie sheet (covering it with plastic wrap made a sticky mess, next time I'll just leave it off) and after baking, it turned out perfectly crisp and delicious. The toppings are amazing together. I will definitely make it again. Although it was very sticky and runny dough, it turns out perfectly in the end.

I realize the dough for a flatbread is supposed to be wetter than your average pizza dough, but this recipe is extreme. Warned by other reviewers as to this problem, I even watched the accompanying video. There's no way you can get a dough of the texture they show using the amount of flour listed. I easily added a 1/3 cup more and it was still very sticky. And, yes, I know how to accurately measure flour. I think maybe the people who wrote this recipe don't. That said, the flavors of the topping were excellent, so I will be making using them as a jumping off point for further efforts. Just not using their approach to the dough.

Because of changes I won't rate this recipe. I made this sans truffle oil and used olive oil instead. Also, I didn't have any chives, so I sprinkled some more fresh thyme on the bread before baking and over the creme fraiche at the end. Like a better pizza, tasty!

This was amazing. I'm going to be making it over and over again. I decided to have a trial run after reading the previous reviews so, I didn't splurge on the truffle oil. I kneaded the dough by hand instead of using a dough hook and it turned out great. I added pancetta for some extra flavor and my flatbread only baked for 15 minutes.The video was very helpful.

I have a feeling that there was something wrong with your yeast. Next time, after you've dissolved the yeast in the liquid, let it set for a few minutes before adding the dry ingredients. If there are no bubbles on the surface of the yeast mixture, then you're definitely not going to get any rise or bubbles in the dough.

My experience making this flatbread was similar- the flatbread dough was so wet it was pourable. Please check the recipe source to confirm if the quantity of flour is correct. It is too bad this recipe was a failure as the video is informative and encouraging

What did I do wrong?? I've never made flatbread before and this did not turn out like I expected. It never did get "pufffy" and seemed too wet. Should there be more flour or less water? I had to scrape it off the cooking sheet when it was done. The topping flavor was very good. I'm just glad I didn't try this for a dinner party.
