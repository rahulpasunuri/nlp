This was a delicious and welcome alternative to our old standby of garlic and rosemary crusted lamb chops. We used lamb rib chops instead of the shoulder chops, which I find too gristly for the grill. The sweet and salty glaze turned the chops into succulent finger licking meat lolly pops that I ended up picking up and eating with my fingers! I served these with pan-roasted garlic ginger brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes made with sesame oil, butter and a little half and half(surprisingly delicious). A fun Asian twist on a western meal!

While the flavours are nice, they overpower the lamb in this recipe and are simply overdone.

Oh, my God; I thought the title of this recipe was Human Lamb Chops.

This recipe is so delicious. I have made it twice on the grill and I can still taste the sumptious marinade. Served this with a baked potato and a beautiful spinach salad with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, mandarin oranges, and avocado in a curry verouth dressing.

Great flavor, easy prep, and quick grilling! Perfect for a nice dinner at home or entertaining guests as part of a BBQ. I served this with mixed grilled vegetables.
