Just ok for me. The recipe states that you can make the salad 4 hours ahead, but I would not recommend it. It did wilt in the fridge and lacked a fresh crispness that I was hoping for. I like to make som tam (green papaya salad) and was hoping for a nice alternative that wouldn't necessitate a trip to the asian market, but this wasn't it for me. To note, the flavor of the dressing is very good, I just wasn't personally keen on the texture of the vegetables.

Really liked this combination of flavors. Made a quick, tasty, and refreshing lunch to take to work during the summer.

I made it without the fish sauce, adding rice wine vinegar instead. Maybe not authentic, but still tasty and very refreshing.

Very good--fast, and with a definite taste of the Thai salad it's meant to approach. I added half a red onion that I had on hand, and served with a sweet/spicy fish and a salty-soy eggplant dish and white rice for balance.

Quite good, especially considering the minimal preparation time. Definitely would make again, perhaps with slightly less sugar and half of another serrano chile.

I was flummoxed at how delicious this simple dish is! I couldn't get it out of my mind--I actually made it again the next day! It's true about the cucumbers making the dish watery if made in advance--I think 1-2 hours ahead is ideal; too far in advance, it's still a good dish, but doesn't pack the same punch as the freshly-made.
