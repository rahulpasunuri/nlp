Yeah, I'm with you "A Cook from Ardmore"....wish I had read the recipe through REALLY well before I went to the store to buy the ingredients. In addition to the tomato error, the recipe never mentions the zucchini again! Okay, so, I luckily bought more tomatoes, added 1/2 the tomato puree to the risotto and then served the extra roasted tomatoes with the zucchini on top. I can adlib well enough, but errors are annoying.

This recipe may have errors in it, and it differs from the same recipe posted on the SELFDishes website. In the epicurious version, the oven-roasted tomatoes are pureed with lemon juice and oil, and mixed in with the risotto. How then can you later saute the oven-roasted tomatoes with the scallops and then top the risotto with the tomatoes? What happens to the zucchini that was sauteed earlier? The SELFDishes version calls for pureeing the zucchini, and combining the zucchini with the rice, which makes more sense, given the later directions for the tomatoes. Not knowing this, I mixed the pureed tomatoes in with the rice, and topped everything with the sauteed zucchini. It all turned out pretty good, and I would make either version again.

Tomato flavour was WAY too strong and overwhelmed this dish.

this is a great, light recipe. the roasted cherry tomatoes make it fabulous, and you'd never guess it was lower in fat. plus, it's lovely looking.
