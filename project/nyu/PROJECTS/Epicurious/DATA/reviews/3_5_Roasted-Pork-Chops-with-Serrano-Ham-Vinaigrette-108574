This was very good as written. I though the pork chop time in the oven was perfect. Regretfully no prosciutto in the pantry tonight but everything else was. Quick, simple. I will look forward to using the proper ham next time. Used a non-nitrate cured bacon which tends to be much leaner than the normal brands so I was a little lLow on drippings.

This was good. The vinaigrette was very tasty.

I thought it was very good (and has potential), however, I did make some changes and next time I will do more changes: 1) I used less than the recommended amount of bacon drippings (to avoid it being bacon overpowering) 2) I passed the bacon drippings through a sieve lined with paper towels so it is clear 3) Perhaps because I used less bacon grease, the sauce was a tad too sweet, I would cut the amount of brown sugar next time 4) I infused the sauce with a few sprigs of thyme and a bayleaf which gave it just a hint of herb flavoring

This was OK. I don't understand all the oohs and ahhs, though. The recipe was easy, and the sauce was very tasty, but the meat was nothing special. I should note, however, I am not a big fan of pork, but was looking for something different. I have left over sauce that I will save for a pork tenderloin, which will be the cut I will stick to here out. I served with the potato gratin, roasted asparagus and a walnut roquefort salad. We struggled picking the wine pairing, because of the acidity in the sauce. Went with a Cote du Rhone, and it worked well, a rioja would also work, we think. I can't believe this would be served at the French Laundry as written, would expect something more there...

I also had to substitute thyme with rosemary and left out the ham, (is this a trend?) It was a great dish - Easy, flavorful and quick. Loved it.

Excellent!! I had to cut a few corners to make do w/stuff on hand and my budget (I'm a broke college student). I didn't add the Serrano ham, and substituted rosemary for thyme (yeah, yeah, sounds like the song, I know). Very good! I ended up leaving it in the oven for 10-12 min, instead of the recommended 8. Maybe I didn't leave it in the pan/oil long enough.

I'd give this 2 1/2 forks. It was good but I found the bacon drippings to be a little over powering in the vinaigrette, and I was hoping it would have a little more zing to it. Next time I might use a thicker cut of pork. I did make the suggested potatoes and they were great.

The sauce was really great, but I'm just not a huge fan of pork. I'll probably make this again but substitute something for the pork. I made the potato gratins to accompany this dish and was pleasantly surprised by their flavor. I agree that popping them under the broiler to brown the tops at the very end of cooking would help with the appearance.

OK, we changed it a little -- cooked the pancetta with the vinagrette instead of ham, and kept all the goodies in, no straining. We like our chunky sauces. We also made a bit more, put it over spinach and it cooked the spinach down and the sauce was a dressing. Served it with an herb risotto and it was delicious!

This was a definite keeper!! The pork chops were very moist and full of flavor! I would highly recommend for an easy meal yet very delicious!

Recipe was easy to follow, and the pork chops cooked in the stated amount of time. The vinaigrette could have been a little sweeter (or was it too much bacon drippings?), so we might add more brown sugar next time. Very yummy.
