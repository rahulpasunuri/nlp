It was okay, will continue to look for a better recipe. I guess I am spoiled by Big Island Candies short bread cookies.

These were delicious and couldn't have been easier to make.

This is the classic recipe, slightly modernised in that you can make it in the blender rather that the traditional rubbing-in method. I made both this and the traditional one in the recipe, Shortbread Cookies. No nticable difference in taste or texture so I'll use thi one as it is faster and less messy. I flavoured half the batch with vanilla and the other half with cardamon. Try the cardamon... It is to die for!!

Simply wonderful, I also did a twist with peanut butter as my daughter Mona did, I have baked three portions for the German Charity Christmas bazaar and I am sure it is going to be a smash. Thank you.

yummy...I actually didn't read the recipe correctly and I baked it all at once in a 10' pie pan....it came out good though...I had to increase the cooking time ....and after the initial 30min at 250 I increased the temp to 300 ...I dipped it in chocolate too...very good

You can't go wrong with this simple recipe. They were a hit.

This is the perfect shortbread recipe. You can add other things like a hint of lemon zest, minced pecans, finely chopped rosemary. BUT- prick the cookies into pie shapes before baking and cut them apart while still hot. MB

My daughter and I made this for her school's International Day as food sample from Scotland. They were delicious. The only dicey part was keeping the dough from falling apart when pressing it into the pie dishes, but the shortbread came out wonderfully. We'll do it again!

Toddler's love 'em. Kids love 'em! Grown-up's love 'em. Easy! Have made them too many times to count.

Excellent! I sprinkled top with a bit of superfine sugar about 10 minutes before removing from oven. Not for dieters! Also, I didn't have access to a food processor, so had to mix with pastry blender by hand. 'Worked fine.

I make these short breads about twice a week for my wifes salon. The ladies love them with coffee or tea. I usually sprinke a little sugar on top prior to putting in the oven
