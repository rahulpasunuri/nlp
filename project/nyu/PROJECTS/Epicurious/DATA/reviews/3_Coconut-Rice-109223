Has become a regular variation for our rice-based sides. Simple and lovely.

In reading the other reviews about the rice being boring, I used mango nectar (Looza brand specifically) instead of water. It turned out wonderfully! It brought out the richness of the coconut milk and added the sweetness and flavor I was looking for. Probably not 4 stars w/out the mango.

This was very nice. I did add a bit of curry powder for an extra dimension of flavour, but it was a nice side for a Caribbean night at home.

I made this rice to accompany the Macadamia-crusted yellowtail (also from this site). I first tried it with brown rice, and there was not nearly enough liquid, so I had to start over. The second time, I used basmati, and added some extra water and it turned out great! Make sure to add a fair amount of salt and pepper though, because it can be quite bland otherwise. It's a great pairing though for the yellowtail dish!

Yum! I made this to accompany chicken wraps and it was great as a side and in the wraps. I also made it in a rice cooker with a little thinly sliced bell pepper and cilantro.

I also had trouble cooking this recipe in my (Cuisinart) rice cooker. It turns off when rice is done, and kept turning off throughout the cooking process. Next time I will use a pot.

Great recipe. Simple and the cinnamon adds a nice aromatic touch.

Ya...so the rice cooker thing didn't work. I tried to just dump all the ingredients (minus the butter) in a rice cooker. The rice cooker switched to warm in about 2 minutes and I ended up dumping it into a sauce pan. It was good!

This was easy to make and came out great. I did change the portions b/c I didn't need so many servings. I used 1 cup long grain brown rice, still used 1 can of coconut milk and used around 3/4 cup water. I thought it was delicious.

Made this for my luau party and people were raving about it all weekend. I agree it was a tad on the bland side so next time I will increase the coconut milk. I added fresh pinepple, mango, and toasted shredded coconut.

Instead, I made the rice with only coconut milk, and added about 2 tablespoons of lime juice, tossing the used limes in with the rice. Much much better that way.

I had to make this dish without the chilies (because I have four small children who won't eat anything with the least bit of "zing") and it was still a great dish. I took the advice of others with the bacon and sliced the pork very thin. I made a coconut rice to go with this--one can coconut milk, 1 1/2 cups chicken stock, 2 cups rice and threw in some basil leaves. Yummy!

It was good, but the flavor depends on the coconut milk used. I will try a different brand next time. It could use a bit more salt in the recipe though.

This isn't "boring." It's "subtle." I started with brown jasmine rice and added grated carrots when the rice came to a boil. If you're going to do something like that, you'll need about 1 extra cup of water and some more cooking time. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers with a little sweetener for breakfast.

Not worth the time. Can't taste the coconut. BORING!

We serve this every year as part of a New England midwinter tropical dinner - the perfect side dish for a more flavorful or spicy entree. Basmati rice is the best.

Not bad, just a bit boring. Will probably try serving the leftovers with black beans (as suggested by one of the other reviewers).

Used basmati rice and had to add an entire extra can of cocunt milk and at least one extra cup of water. Tasted great whne it was done!

very nice, mild side. I made it with brown basmati rice and increased cooking time until liquid was absorbed.

Rating: 3
I will make this again, however next time I'll add a bit of sugar. I make this as an accompaniment to very spicy black beans and the sweetness balances with heat and spice really well. We enjoyed sweet coconut rice at Morada Bay Restaurant in Islamorada, Fl during our last spring break vacation. Very memorable!

I was looking for how to make "Caribbean" rice and found this recipe. I added a ton of other stuff, but the coconut milk was what made the brown jasmine rice delicious. I added pineapple, ginger and lime zest as well as red pepper, turmeric and hot paprika. Also sauteed a bunch of veggies and tossed in chicken and black beans. Yum!

Made exactly according to recipe, there was a lot of adding combinations of coconut milk and water going on to get the rice cooked through. I truly lost track of how much we actually added before the rice lost its crunch! I was serving a great curry dish with it, so to mask the 'sogginess'of the rice, the curry was served over not with the rice. There is another coconut rice recipe on this site dated February '98 - at least there's an advance warning about the consistency! Haven't tried it but given the abundancy of coconuts here maybe we'll just go that route instead.

This side dish was a nice compliment to a spicy fish recipe I tried for the first time today. I used brown long grain rice, so the cooking time needed some adjusting, but it still turned out very nicely. As the last reviewer noted, it was a bit on the bland side by itself, which will definitly encourage some further experimentation on the next attempt.

This was good. A little bland but made a fine addition to my Thai Shrimp.

So easy -- all I did was put all the ingredients in my rice cooker and turn it on. I did omit the butter and use lite coconut milk, and the flavor was still excellent. Served with West Indian Beef Stew to rave reviews.

I've never quite mastered the art of cooking rice so I had a little trouble with having all the liquid being absorbed well before the rice was tender. I served this with grilled jerk chicken with papaya salsa. The mild flavor of the coconut rice was perfect with the heat of the jerk seasoning and the sweet flavor in the salsa. Aside from my issue with the rice not being quite tender enough, it was a wonderful summer dinner that received rave reviews from my family.

This rice dish was good, with a nice coconut flavor, but I thought it was really filling.
