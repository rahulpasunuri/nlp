This was excellent and easy. I used gluten-free flour so my husband could eat it too and it turned out perfect. We don't get sour cherries in Berkeley so I used sweet and 1/2 the amount of sugar (and I should have used 1/2 the amount of water), also added some lemon and zest per another review. And added brandy after the cherries had cooled a bit and a pinch of salt - delicious!

I just made this sour cherry sauce without the torte to go with the Black Forest Cake I made except I halved the recipe as I was using leftover cherries. I also added an oz of dark chocolate and I have to say - it's pretty tastey!

Delicious, and quite easy! -- a friend gifted some sour cherries, and having no idea what to do with them, I tried this recipe. Torte itself is a wonderful buttery-almondy cake, and the sour cherry sauce is a perfect accompaniment. (Only comment, I'm not sure why the recipe calls for "blanched whole almonds"; as you food process them anyway. Next time I will just use a cup of the "sliced almonds" that you use anyway to garnish the torte.)

This is a wonderful, and wonderfully easy recipe for a delicious, moist cake. If you like marzipan you will love this cake. It is true that it should not be made more than one day in advance or the toasted almonds on top may become too chewy, but you could just avoid using them since this cake seems to maintain its richness and becomes even better and still very moist after a few days! I inverted the cake on a wire rack to try to prevent it from sinking and that seemed to work very well.

Love this cake, have made it many times before, but this time I had a problem. For some reason the cake rose up the sides and was flat and uncooked in the middle. It looked like a pei crust! I am bogled as to why this happened. The only thing I changed was I used unbromated flour. Really, I have made this before and it turned out beautifully. Please, any input would be welcome.

Outrageously good cake! And I'm not usually a big cake fan. Took this to a Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe to make two layers. Instead of the sour cherry topping I used a really good brand of cherry preserves. I frosted it with Buttercream with a little almond extract and pressed toasted, sliced almonds on the sides and an arrangement of cherries and other fruit on top - glazed with melted apricot jam for shine.

This is one of my favorite dinner party desserts. The cake is light, moist, not too sweet and has wonderful flavor. It is also exceptionally easy to make. Instead of the sour cherry sauce, I make a sauce with frozen dark sweet cherries. I briefly cook the cherries with a bit of sugar and touch brandy. Serve with the sauce and a dollop of whipped cream. So easy, and so goo. Everyone I've served this to loves it.

This is an excellent cake! I have made many times -- initially w/ sour cherries when they're in season (which is about 3 weeks tops!) Now that it's winter, I've been serving cake w/ dried fruit -- cherries, raisins & apricots -- poached in simple syrup & vanilla bean, adding orange zest. It's light w/o the egg yolks, and not overly sweet. Reliable and always a hit!

This is a delicious european style cake that slices cleanly and transports well. I used almond flour for the 4 oz of almonds and then dusted the finished cake with powdered sugar for a more attractive presentation. I had some good canned sour cherries and used that for the sauce and added a dash of kirsch. The cake makes a great base for all kinds of fruit compotes. This recipe yields 10 servings.

This dessert was awesome-even without the cherry topping! The first time I made it I remember that I had to keep making trips into the kitchen for "another bite"! Friends and family alike rave over it!

I really enjoyed this torte, but when I served it at a tea on a table with several other desserts, and it just didn't look sexy enough to compete. Lucky me: lots of leftovers. It would be great for a sit-down dinner party.

This is an ideal dinner party dessert recipe: sophisticated, delicious, never-fail, and quick and easy to prepare. The only problem is finding sour cherries -- so I've frequently made the cake with a raspberry sauce. If fresh raspberries are too expensive, you can even use frozen unsweetened ones, and add Amaretto or Chambord to make the sauce a bit more interesting. I just wish I had about eight comparable dessert recipes. If I had, I'd be able to pass myself off as a skilled baker...

This is an excellent cake. It was devoured by my guests. I didn't have any cherries, so I served it in a pool of chocolate sauce. I added a drop of almond extract to heighten the flavor a bit. I used a round of wax paper to ensure the cake would release from the pan. It is a wonderfully moist cake, very easy and quick to put together.

I made this recipe when it came out in the July 96 issue. It was delicious and I promptly put the recipe in a very safe place.. I can't believe that I found it again in your recipe files!!! It's delicious.

Almond and cherry has always been a great flavor combination. This cake is so wonderfully light and flavorful, and the cherry sauce makes a great partner. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the cherries to enrichen the flavor a little.
