Tasty and very satisfying sandwiches! I ended up using pita bread because that's what I had on hand, but I think it worked very well. I mixed some harissa with a bit of mayo for a spread and it was excellent.

This was SO good, more than the sum of its parts! I brought it to the office for breakfast, with good crusty rolls from the local French bakery, and it disappeared quickly. It gave me an opportunity to use the harissa in my refrigerator.

This sandwich was quick and easy to make on a typical Thursday evening. The flavor is good, although I thought the texture was a little dry. I used a good mustard like another reviewer suggested, which was good. I served it with coleslaw, which we ended up eating on top of the sandwich for added sauce. I think next time I will consider putting an additional dressing on it.

Great economical meal for a snowy february night, we've made it twice now. Used cumin powder, not seeds - also added coriander, a bit of paprika, and a couple hot peppers. It's a nice break from the typical potato fare...

Tasty and easy. I didn't have harissa, so used a strong mustard instead; it was a different taste, but also very very good. I think this recipe has a lot of versatility built in. Served with a light salad. A great late summer meal.

I took a bite while it was frying and it tasted kind of bland. I think the 'harissa' or cayenne should be a must, but since I have never tried it nor do i have it i just threw in some tandoori masala and cayenne. tasted really good after that. the frying peppers are called 'cubano' peppers at walmart. i had this inside a kaiser roll.

Excellent and easy to make. I ground some whole coriander seeds in with the cumin - I thought it needed another flavor. The harissa is a must. It makes a lot - which is great because the leftovers are great for hash or an omelet the next day!
