This is a 2 fork (good) recipe. The taste was interesting, but like others, I was expecting something a little more unique or flavorful.

I couldn't find any garam masala, so I made my own in my mortar and pestle. I adore caramelized onions, and these were lovely.. but the spices were not a flavor I was expecting. It overpowered the dip and I tried every trick I knew to hide it, adding extra cilantro, raw minced onion, white wine vinegar. I wasn't thrilled to serve this to my guests and though they claimed to enjoy it, I ended up throwing almost all of it out uneaten. My mistake for cooking with a spice combination I was not familiar with.

Not so good, unless you love gram marsala. That's all you taste. I may experiment with less GM like 1/2 to 3/4 less, strong stuff.

I made the dip recipe as written, and as others commented, it was really, really sweet for something that is intended to be savory. To make it work for me, I added lots of salt, cumin, chopped cilantro, some balsamic vinegar and red pepper flakes. At that point, it was nothing like the written recipe, but it was awesome, and even better the next day.

I love this dip. It's my go-to when I have to bring something to a party. Everyone here keeps commenting that this dip is too sweet but I disagree. I use sour cream which adds some acidity and bite and I add some salt and pepper to cut the garam marsala "sweetness". I agree that the pita chips are awesome, especially when the cilantro/garlic oil is made. So addictive. I could eat a whole bowl of this dip all by myself.

I loved the recipe and used vidalia onions but added a bit of cayenne for kick. I also stirred some of the mixture in my eggs and scrambled them, I really enjoyed the eggs as well.

This is great & super easy. I use sour cream so it is not too sweet. I also add an extra onion or 2 & a bit of salt. My brother makes it as well (with creme fraiche) and we both get asked for the recipe all of the time.

Had this at my daughter's Christmas buffet yesterday and thought it was very tasty. She eliminated the garam masala since she didn't have any, and used half creme fraiche and half sour cream which gave good results. I liked the toasty-oniony flavor but. One of the guests put it on the hot roast beef she had and said it was really good. She did not do the pita crisps--just had crackers and flatbreads and it was fine.

I thought this was tasty but my husband doesn't like appetizers too sweet and the cinnamon in the garam masala made him think "dulce". I make my own creme fraiche (1 pint cream plus 1 container active full fat yogurt) and raised some great onions called "Candy". Maybe if I used commercial sour cream and store bought onions it would not have been as sweet. I do love the technique on the pitas and will use it again. I opened a jar of tampenade and my husband loved that with the pitas.

This tasted good, but was way more work than it was worth. No one could tell it wasn't a store-bought dip, even though I splurged on creme fraiche.

This was an okay onion dip. I expected the caramelized onion to have a more dominant sweet flavor, but all in all it was a good dip. Definitely dice the onions, it makes it easier for dipping.

A little disappointing. Flavor was okay, surprisingly sweet. Made it for a cocktail party and it was hardly touched, not worth the time.

This dip is delicious & easy to make. The pita crisps were time consuming & finicky to make & definitely not worth the effort - go with a good cracker or flatbread!

Too sweet. It needed an acidic note to cut the richness. We added some fresh lemon juice to our taste.

I make a recipe very similiar to this using goat cheese for extra flavor/texture. Yum!

I thought that this dish was very tasty but it makes a lot and it;s not that exciting. You can have 2 or three crackers with the topping and be satisfied. I felt the whole thing was too much work for the results. I had a dinner party of 6 and they all had the same reaction. I didn't even finish a small ramkin. Thnk goodness I have some people coming over again tonight to use more of it up.

Too sweet of a flavor, and it seemed like a waste of creme fraiche, as the flavor was overcome by the spices. I thought the pitas were alot of work for very little flavor. Everyone ate the pitas though, but the dip was left behind.

This is a great appetizer that is differnt than the old stand bys. Make it ahead of time - it takes time, but I did other things while I watching the onions. Make the oil - it makes a big differnce

Truly delicious. A little time-consuming, but whenever I know I'm going to need an appetizer in advance, this one is sure to be very high on my list of make-ahead dishes. Don't skip infusing the olive oil with garlic and cilantro stems - it makes a good recipe great.

Very very good, I served it as an appetizer to a crowd of 17 for dinner one night. The only change I made to the recipe was to add a couple of tbs of sugar to the onions as they cooked.
