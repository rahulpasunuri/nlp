reminds me of a spanish tapas dish. It is good as long as you dry the calamari well.

oh my, this was terrible. All the fat and none of the taste! maybe I didn't dry the calamari enough. Oh well.

I was afraid this might be bland simply because the few ingredients, but I was quite impressed! Quick, easy and delightful!

Would definitely make again. I used pre-cut frozen calamari rings which make this recipe a quick dinner especially when paired with The Edamame and Carrot Salad with Rice Vinegar Dressing recipe!

YUM!! i've made this twice in 2 days it was that good - the second time i served it over spinach, halved cherry tomatoes and a bit of garlic that i sauteed over high heat just to wilt - the perfect, quick, easy, have all the ingredients, don't have to think about it meal!

This is a fabulous, easy and quick recipe. I can't rave about it enough. I will definitely make it again.

Easy but not very tasty. Make sure you thoroughly dry the calamari before cooking or you will end up with no taste at all!

Delicious...but try it with pancetta, the air-cured Italian bacon. Smoked American bacon is too strong to pair with squid.
