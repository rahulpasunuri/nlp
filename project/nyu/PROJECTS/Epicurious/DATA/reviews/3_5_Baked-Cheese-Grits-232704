I made the baked cheesy grits last Saturday night for dinner guests. It was delicious! I baked only 45 minutes, otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone loved them! My husband had THREE servings! Will definetly make this again. I may through in a little green onion next thyme for fun.

Very delicious recipe. My preference is for a deeper pan. I used a large glass baking pan and think next time I'll use something narrower and deeper.

Yum! Made for Easter to go with Cajun Rabbit in Roux Gravy from an Hp Cookbook by Terry Thompson. The leftover roux was great for pork chops!!! Will try agin with the spicy cheeses suggested by others. If you think you don't like grits definitely try these!!!

Excellent recipe. We recently moved from Alabama to Colorado. My son who's in college wanted to entertain 15 of his friends with a Southern dinner. I found this recipe, which sounded good. The kids loved it. Their remarks were, "I don't know what this is, but I sure love it!" The recipe was easy to make. Since my first make, I've changed the recipe a bit. Our family likes a bit of spice, so I substituted all the cheeses (1 1/2 cups) with Pepper Jack cheese. I used that for our dressing on Thanksgiving. On Christmas morning, I also added one package/tube of browned and drained Sage bulk sausage to the recipe (with the Pepper Jack cheese) as a brunch casserole. Everyone loved it, and many asked for the recipe. Either as is or tweeked to your tastes, it's a big winner.

This recipe really delivers on flavor, texture and simplicity. I love grits, but this took them to a whole new level. Served with braised beef brisket with chipotle & green chile sauce (see Beef Short Rib w/Chipotle & Green Chili) and it worked to perfection. It is indulgent, but everyone needs to splurge once in awhile.

This was a hit at my office. I doubled the recipe, but added only two eggs and it was perfect. It was definitely a crowd- pleaser.

I too went with the one egg...and I made them in individual ramekins. Guests were scraping the bottom of their dishes. It will become a regular around here.

Thanks to previous reviewers for the heads up on only using one egg. This was perfect with the etouffee. I think it could be cheesier though ... I'll probably add more cheese next time.

Very nice - and very easy! I used only one egg and added crushed garlic and a bit of cayenne pepper. I recently brought grits back to New Zealand from a trip to the US - the dish was a hit, even though no one knew what a "grit" was!

Good but not great. Easy.

Terrific alternative side dish. I made the recipe as written; however I doubled it for a party and added jalaps, pimentos, pepperoncini peppers, and 1/4 cup grated parmesan (because it initially didn't taste cheesy enough). Would definitely make this again.

Excellent! Very cheesy and rich, but so yummy.

Delish! Made this for Mother's Day (taking the recommendation of using only 1 egg) and it was perfect -- the hit of the day.

I loved this recipe because it was simple yet delicious. Plus, it looked great coming out of the oven; browned on top and then cheesy and rich on the inside. Wonderful!

Quick and very easy to make. Made with two eggs and found the grits to be very rich and creamy on first serving, but firmed up when refrigerated, like polenta. Recipe was enough for DH and I to have two dinners with enough leftover for lunch.

Thought these were great! Made them yesterday and ate them this morning for Christmas Day. They tasted wondeful and it was great to have one less thing to prepare as we had a busy morning with three boys under 6! Took others advice and used one egg and found the consistency to be perfect - creamy like grits should be with a cheesy crust on top. This will become a fixture on Christmas Day I expect.

Only One Egg. A little less butter. Add more cheese. A pinch or more of Cayenne. I often double the recipe because four people wipe this out. Add grilled spiced shrimp and a bloody mary for a perfect brunch.

I've made this recipe twice -- once without variation, and the second time with only one egg. The one-egg consistency is much creamier, like I would expect grits to be. Quite good with the etouffee, and a nice alternative to rice.

My dinner guest from North Carolina loved this side dish and she's a huge grits fan. It's easy to make and a nice change from rice or mashed potatoes.

I love cheese grits, so, of course, I liked these. I do prefer grits without eggs, though the baking method makes it a little easier to prepare in advance for a larger crowd. Excellent with the rabbit etoufee, and they bake at the same time.

To the cook from Ontario. I would NOT use corn meal to properly make this recipe. Grits are from hominy, which I believe is a relative of corn, but have a different consistencey and flavor from polenta. Being a lover of grits and polenta, I would try to find even the Quaker Oats brand in a large grocery store or not make this recipe. It looks like it would be a good one, although I would add some garlic to make it Garlic cheese grits.

Question: can't find "grits" around here - can one use corn meal instead (like polenta)???? Would appreciate knowing!

I use chicken broth in place of the water. Also may use a "tube" of garlic cheese (Kraft)in place of cheddar. Then place in dble boiler or bake as you directed

Living in the South, I frequently prepare cheese grits, but I really like this baked version. Adding the eggs and milk adds another dimension to this typically southern dish that we love...and it's a lot more presentable at the table!
