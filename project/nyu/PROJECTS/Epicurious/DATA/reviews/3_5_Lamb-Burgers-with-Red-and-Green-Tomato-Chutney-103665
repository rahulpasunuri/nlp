I wouldn't make the chutney again. It was a let-down compared to other ones that I've made.

We love lamb burgers in pita bread with tzatziki. The chutney is a delicious alternative! Unfortunately, I only find green tomatoes in the market during the summer.

The Tomato Chutney made the dish. It was easy to make and the taste was pleasant and interesting. The mix of flavors was memorable

This burger was easy to make, surprising and deliscious. Both the lamb and the chutney provide strong and complimentary flavors. The chutney, sweet and sour, tempers the lamb's pungency and they combine to make a complex and tasty burger. I did not enjoy the recommended accompanyment of rice and lentils and do not feel that it's bland flavor was a good match for this strong dish.
