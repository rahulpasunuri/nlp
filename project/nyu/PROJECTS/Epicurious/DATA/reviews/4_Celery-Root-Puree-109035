Easy and delicious. I did not add the garlic. I love garlic but don't think it would work to my taste with this recipe. I may add a squirt of lemon juice next time I make this.

I love celeraic puree, but the addition of the garlic adds a weird sharpish flavor. I've always just made it with half potatoes, drain, add milk, butter S&P. I think the chicken broth is a nice addition that allows you to cut down on the butter but definitely leave out the garlic.

Celery root is a wonderful alternative to potatoes--this is a great recipe--I left out the garlic and instead substituted 1 tsp. lemon juice--it adds a nice zing--

I wasn't wild about it but my guests raved. Would be greatly improved by horseradish and maybe some pecorino romano added into the mix.

This was excellent! My customizations include adding a bayleaf to the water I boiled the root in. Then using a handful of raw cashews rather than butter and cream. I put the mixture on a bed of steamed spinach with mushrooms, garlic and onions. Then sprinkled a bit of allspice or nutmeg on top. I've made this several times!

I would have never thought that celery root would make such an exquisite dish. An excellent alternative to potatos! If you can, find a root that is about a quarter to a third of a pound heavier than called for and you can cleave large pieces form the root, avoiding the problems mentioned below. Also, don't skimp on the fat: the heavy cream make all the difference.

Cut The Celery root to slices and than peel it.It is more easy this way.

HI I made this for dinner as a side dish to roast lamb because I wanted a low-carb but rich and satisfying side dish. This is it. Celery root on its own is about 7 carb grams per cup. Although it's not actually the root of the celery plant that we use in tuna salad and such,it has a strong celery flavor. Adding the cream and butter makes it very luxurious. The only reason I don't give it 4 forks is not the recipe's fault--celery root is a b--ch to peel and cut into pieces. It is very knobby and hard as a rock, so use a strong peeler and a large sharp knife and be careful.
