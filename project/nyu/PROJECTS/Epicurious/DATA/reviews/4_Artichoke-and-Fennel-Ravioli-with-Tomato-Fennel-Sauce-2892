I followed the directions except the part about the wonton wrappers. I used a more traditional ravioli pasta. Great flavor, I'm glad I tried this one.

I also substituted sun dried tomatoes for the fennel in the pasta filling. These turned out great! The wonton wrappers worked extremely well! We just folded them in half to form triangles. I will definitely make these again.

Very good sauce... made it alone and tossed with Campanelle curly pasta for a yummy weeknight dinner... will do this sauce again...

I loved this recipe, but I changed the filling a bit. I used sun dried tomato, mushroom, and artichokes. It was absolutely delicious. Next time instead of boiling I'll try either baking or pan frying.

Much better if you lightly pan fry them. Did both boiling them and pan frying them and the crunch with the pan fry is worth the extra oil.

Really shockingly good. I only made the ravioli - not the sause. Great taste combo. Filling the ravioli is time consuming otherwise easy.

I haven't yet tried this recipe, but plan to with a few of my own modifications. First, I plan on substituting the artichoke with porcini mushrooms and then adding a goat cheese to it with the fennel. I think the tomato fennel sauce would stand up to the richness of these ravioli, rather than the lightness that the artichoke would give. Lastly, I will probably add some yellow bell pepper to the tomato sauce to give it another depth of flavor. Anyone think this sounds as good as I do?

Loved the ravioli filling. We found that the sauce was not a good match. It overpowered the mild flavor of the ravioli. Next time the sauce will be an artichoke barigoule - slightly blended.

I followed the recipe the first time, but the second time, I modified the recipe by increasing the artichoke in the ravioli and using slightly less fennel in the sauce to give it more balance. I made my own pasta and did free-form ravioli. My guests raved! Definitely a keeper.

my only comment is that the recipe calls for the frozen artichokes to be unthawed. unthawed means still frozen. just a pet peeve.

This recipe was made into a 4 forker with a few modifications. 1st, don't bother with wonton wrappers, go all the way and make your pasta. Also I added some grated fontina cheese to the mixture to hold it together better, and add a little richness. Then I made fresh tomato sauce and added a white wine reduction. The sauce and filling can be made the day ahead, so all you have to do is make the pasta and assemble. It's worth it!

Too much fennel in this recipe. I would make the ravioli again, but would use a different sauce, maybe an alfredo. The tomato sauce was too acidic and overpowered these mild ravioli.

An excellent and unusual recipe. I would advise people to ensure that they have extra pasta dough on hand.

Really terrific recipe - relatively easy to do, unusual yet very good flavors. Good for a first course or vegetarian entree. I used wonton wrappers - did not bother trimming the edges nor folding them - just placed another square brushed with egg white over top of the first - the squares were attractive. Rave reviews from guests who are all serious cooks - everyone wanted the recipe.
