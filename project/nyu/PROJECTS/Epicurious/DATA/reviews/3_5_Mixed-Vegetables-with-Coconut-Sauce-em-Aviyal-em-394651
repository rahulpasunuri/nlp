Pretty good recipe but as others have said, needed some modifications to boost flavor. I added about 3/4 c. coconut milk as well as the shredded coconut, and I increased the turmeric to 1 tsp and the cumin to 1 tbsp. Plus added 1 tsp ground ginger and used a julienned red bell pepper in addition to other vegetables. I also par-boiled the potatoes since I didn't think they would cook properly with the other vegetables, that was a good move. Otherwise, it came out pretty good, needed a bit of salt but otherwise yummy! We served it with basmati rice and pan-fried tofu cubes. And, I actually like the texture of the ground coconut, so that was a plus for me. Oh, and don't worry about the yogurt thing. We used Greek yogurt and it turned out just fine. :)

I usually don't make dishes with so few and unenthusiastic reviews, but I had a bunch of ingredients to use up and this looked easy and I figured I could doctor it up. The basic recipe has good bones. So I tripled the spices except the peppers which I doubled and I added 1 tsp of Aleppo pepper flakes. I used green beans instead of zucchini. Threw in a little coconut milk with the yogurt ( I used kefir). There are some issues with the recipe as written. The potatoes take far longer to cook than the rest of the veggies so boil them a good 5 to 10 minutes before adding the carrots. I could not make a smooth paste out of the flaked coconut no matter how long I processed it and it came out gritty. Next time, I will try soaking the coconut in hot water before making the paste, or just substituting coconut milk. This recipe has potential, it just should have been vetted a few more times in the test kitchen.

Made this this morning according to recipe directions - it has to be the blandest dish I have ever made. Very little flavor. Ended up tossing the remainder of the dish, thank goodness I didn't try it on company. Not worth the calories!

I've been making a very similar dish to this for many years. First off, I would use frozen or fresh coconut instead of dried unsweetened coconut if you can find it. Also, Aviyal means mixed vegetables, and you can easily substitute vegetables of your choice in this dish, i.e. sweet potato, plantain, green beans, drumstick (if you can find it), and/or bell peppers of any color go very well. Instead of the various chilies suggested, you could use just the green chile, doubling it if you want it spicier... and I typically grind the green chilies into a paste. Another thing I do differently is to add mustard seeds, cooked for a moment in the coconut oil until they pop.
