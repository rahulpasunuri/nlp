Weird. I don't know what I did wrong and I did not have enough time to experiment, but this turned out to be not so great. the flavor was ok, but they were a strange sticky mess. I don't think I'd make this again.

Little jewels of flavor! Reduce amount of jam and cooking time for better results.

The jelly spills out all over the cookies and cookie sheet, making the cookies not pretty enough to serve to company and the cookie sheet very hard to clean. They taste ok, but don't cook them for as long as the recipe says because they will burn.

These cookies came out yummy, they just didn't look so great. The thumbprint that I put the jelly in rose during baking, so the jelly kind of spread out on top of the cookie. Like I said, not pretty enough to serve to company, but yummy nonetheless.

Either the directions are wrong or this is just an awful recipe. Threw the whole batch in the trash.

These cookies taste as good as they look. Very easy, and very impressive. We found 1/4 tsp of sugar per cookie was perfect.
