My husband who has a life-long disgust of peas no matter how they are prepared said he actually liked this dish! That's a first.

I used fresh shelling peas and boiled for only 60 second. Did not add sugar. Simple and delicious!

This is really good. Fresh mint from my garden. I used 3 onions.

Loved this! I carmalized my onions in a sautee pan rather than heat up the whole oven and used only a tiny bit of Splenda in place of the sugar. The peas and mint were from our garden. Easy and delicious!

Super simple and really good. Carmelized onions in skillet. Omitted salt. Heated frozen peas in microwave and tossed in mint and onions. Did not use sugar. Couldn't be any easier. Loved by all!

I cut this down by four as there are only two of us. I also substituted fresh peas. Excellent! The garden is abundant with peas right now, so we'll be having this many times.

Used this recipe as a starting point, but roasted quartered shallots with chunks of carrot tossed with the olive oil, S&P. Thawed peas, then tossed them into the other vegetables near the end of the roasting time just to heat. Omitted the sugar as I prefer a more savory dish (and lots of other things on the T-day table were sweet). Stirred in the mint just before serving. Liked the clean, fresh taste of the mint in contrast to some of the other heavier dishes.

I had planned an overly ambitious St. Patrick's Day dinner party, with this recipe being the only halfway healthy dish! I thought that the peas would provide some color and a nice flavor contrast to all the salty food. It did, however, I realized about 10 minutes before I started the peas that I never roasted the onions (!!) I proceeded anyway, using thawed peas that only boiled for about 1-2 minutes (just to warm them), then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. Still very nice, fresh- tasting. My guests really liked it. I will definitely do this again - next time with the onions!!!

So delicious! I omitted the sugar and added about a tablespoon of butter, plus salt and pepper to taste. My guests raved---over peas! who knew....

Raves - for peas! Felt like using the little onions instead of the rings(I know, how old hat!). Did the onions the day before. My mom especially loved this one.

Really delicious. Followed recipe to the letter and see no reason to adjust anything next time. So much better than boring peas and onions!
