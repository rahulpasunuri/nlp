This was good but I added about 7 garlic cloves and doubled the rosemary (it tasted rather bland until I added more). The garlic and rosemary made yummy little "crunchies" all around the potatoes. Will make again but I definitely suggested increasing the garlic and rosemary for more prominent flavor.

Great flavor (I doubled the garlic, we're garlic lovers) and we loved the crustiness of the potatoes from pan frying. This is a perfect accompaniment to a heavy meat entree. I think it is more a recipe for 4 than 2.

Not very flavorful. There are so many other good recipes than this one. I would not waste your time.

This was SO easy to make and very tasty. The rosemary is very subtle. I think next time I may add more as I LOVE rosemary. Even my picky fiance liked this one and had seconds! I'll definitely make this again.

Always looking for new potato ways and I liked This one. Easy enuf, too. Ihad no "new" potatos on hand so used unpeeled diced Idahos and itworked fine.
