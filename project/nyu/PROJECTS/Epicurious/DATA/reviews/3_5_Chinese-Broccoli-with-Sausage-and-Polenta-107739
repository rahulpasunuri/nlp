This was delicious. I was looking for a vegetable-based dinner that my meatetarian husband would eat. He thought this was delicious. I used 2/3 broccoli rabe and 1/3 broccoli to sub for the Chinese broccoli because it wasn't available in my neighborhood.

I didn't think this sounded very interesting but in my quest to vary our vegetable consumption we tried it. Sooo good! We use broccoli rabe, sweet italian sausage, and actually all I could find was the premade polenta log (don't judge!)I also seasoned the sausage and the broccoli with Penzeys cajun seasoning...great texture, hearty, and a great change from other winter fare

We really enjoyed our variation on this. I substituted my homemade Saucisson de Bretogne (Pork sausage with clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and fresh tarragon) for the italian sausage. I also, couldn't get Gai Lan, so I substituted a mix of brocolli rabe and mustard greens. Used Anson Mills rustic yellow polenta and added a bit of cream, and a small log of chevre.. I had been looking for recipes to use my sausage in, and this one turned out really well.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. I made a few modifications because I am a vegetarian and because I had broccoli rabe on hand. I skipped the heavy cream in the polenta, substituting about 1/3 c. rice milk. For the sausage mixture, I used Boca italian veggie sausage and added chopped mixed mushrooms (cremini, portabella, white, oyster and shitake). It was fantastic.

I have not tried the recipe yet but it looks fab, easier than another polenta/sausage recipe I enjoy from this site. THOUSAND OAKS-- I substitute kale for broccoli rabe, which is tad bitter for me.

I used chicken broth instead of water and left out the cream and cheese when preparing the polenta. I didn't miss the extra fat -- this was delicious!

I enjoyed this recipe. I removed spicy pork sausage removed from its casing, browned it and then drained it on a paper towel. I deglazed the pan with a bit of red wine and then threw in 2 crushed garlic cloves. I didn't boil the broccoli first but just sauteed it in the pan with the garlic. I also used red peppers, which I sauteed with the broccoli. The result was a bright dish with lots of contrasting flavors and textures. Delicious!

Hey Woodland Hills! What did you use instead of broccoli rabe? The hubby and I loved this dish, too, but we really don't like broccoli rabe, and are pondering what we'll use next time. Extra cheese in the polenta was super yummy. Also, my polenta cooks in 5 min. How do you cook it for 45?

I love chinese broccoli. It definitely has a stronger, more intense flavor than regular brocolli. The polenta was a terrific complement to this and the spicy Italian sausage. I classify this dish as comfort food, and I make it on crisp fall or winter evenings.

Used regular broccoli, but really enjoyed the combination of flavors. Added a bit of broth to provide a sort of gravy on the polenta. Easy to make.

Coming from a country who eats a lot of cornmeal, I must admit that both me and my husband were impressed with the flavors and the heartiness of this dish. I used a variation to the Chinese broccoli and it still came out amazing. Definitely a keeper!!
