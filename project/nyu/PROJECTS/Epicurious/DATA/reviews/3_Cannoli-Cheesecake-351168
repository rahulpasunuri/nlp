My guests always love this cake. It's light and airy, and the flavors are subtle. I sometimes substitute orange oil for the zest, otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly, including the store-bought ricotta. It's not a heavy cheesecake (made with cream cheese). It's not a cannoli. But it IS perfect after a large meal.

I make a lot of recipes off of Epicurious, most of them cheesecakes. I hate to say it but this is the worst cheesecake I've ever made. I am "known" in my circle, family and friends, for making amazing cheesecakes. I was humiliated by this one. If I could, I'd give it zero forks. Save your money on the ingredients. Not worth it.

I am giving this cheesecake one fork for the ease of preparation. Everyone at our dinner party thought it tasted "ok". I have made many cheesecakes and this one I did not like. As mentioned by others, the crust to filling does not seem to be proportionately correct.

This was really quite good and a perfect ending to tonight's dinner. I wouldn't say it tasted exactly like a cannoli, but it does have a similar flavor profile. It was very light and airy, decadent without being heavy. I omitted the candied orange peel because I didn't have any on hand and it was absolutely fine without it. I wonder what size pan was used by the reviewer who said there was too much crust, I found it to be the perfect amount for my 9" springform. I will definitely be making this again.

Whole milk ricotta from the store did the job just fine for us. Perhaps the person who found the recipe had too much crust used the wrong sized pan, because it was fine in the pan size called for. I substituted candied ginger for the candied orange peel, which I abhore. The result was FANTASTIC. 5 out of 5 people who had it LOVED it. It was easy to put together, and really just a wonderful dessert. I will make it again, and soon!

This is a charming dessert. The key to this recipe is the quality of your ingredients. Homemade ricotta is the way to go. I used 16 oz of ricotta instead of 15, and didn't keep it in as long as suggested, with a water bath underneath, and it was a success. I brought it to a party and it was a huge success!

What a terrible disappointment! This cake tasted nothing like the cannolis I've eaten - and we've got great cannolis here in NY. The crust was too thick and the filling was almost tasteless. Don't waste your time making this one. It's not worth even one star.

i think the recipe turned out tasty enough. my criticism is that this produced too much crust and too little filling. if i make this again i might try using a smaller pan and adjusting to make a little less crust. great for those who like the less sweet ricotta cheescake. yum.

Wonderful! I used homemade ricotta and had to candy my own orange peel. I added a dusting of grated semi-sweet chocolate to the powdered sugar topping. One on my list to do for more customers!
