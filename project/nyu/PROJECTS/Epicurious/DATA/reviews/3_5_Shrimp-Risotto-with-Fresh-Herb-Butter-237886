Absolutely divine! And simple to make. I, too, used half clam juice and half chicken broth, but next time I make this I'll try all clam juice.

This was amazing. We added lobster to the shrimp and used a combination of the clam juice and chicken broth. We mixed the basil, tarragon and butter and left it soft, not melted. Placed a dollop of it he mixture in the middle of the risotto. This is s "Dinner Club" worthy main course. However it does take baby sitting to stir the risotto. This s not a make ahead dinner because the risotto would dry out. You will just have to excuse yourself to work your magic.

Delicious and simple. Tarragon defitively gives a nice twist. I substituted clam juice with vegetable broth, and it turned out nice! Try it, you'll adopt it!

I agree with the mediocre reviews. I cut back on the butter a bit and used chicken stock instead of clam juice. I also added asparagus, but I still found it to be a little bland and one-note. I ended up throwing extra fresh basil directly into the risotto, which I thought made a big difference.

Even though I cut back on the butter this was nasty-rich and not particularly good, sort of one-note.

Great risotto! Added sauteed portabello mushrooms, which gave it more depth. Swapped chicken broth for half of the clam broth to save money, which worked fine.

I don't understand the rave reviews of this recipe. What a waste of good shrimp.

Excellent but don't overcook the shrimp. Add to pot at end, cover, and the heated rice will cook the shrimp in minutes. Mixed part clam juice and part chicken broth and added chopped scallions at end.

Really was SO easy. I only had baby shrimp, but I think it turned out better that way. I also substituted veggie broth for clam juice, still had great flavor

Served this for non-dairy, non-wheat, pescatarian crowd. Used soy garden instead of butter, veggie broth instead of clam juice, and they loved it. Super easy, super tasty. The herb butter was a simple task and very much worth it.

I made this recipe as soon as I got my copy of BA. And my husband has asked me to do it again tonight. Super quick and easy..I passed it on to our guest and also to a friend who's just starting to cook

This risotto was pretty good. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I substituted some fresh lemon thyme I had in my yard for the basil. I LOVE risotto, but this was not my favorite one. Pretty safe bet that this dish will be enjoyed if you have shrimp lovers.

Delicious! Don't change a thing, and don't skip the herb butter!
