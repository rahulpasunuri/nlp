In a word, fabulous! I made the dough and my friend brought over her pasta maker and claimed this recipe was far superiour to the ones she has used in the past. Both my husband and I kneaded the heck out of it, so perhaps that's the key. It was tasty and tender, with a great texture. It didn't become mealy or fall apart like other fresh pastas I've tried.

I live by reviews on recipe sites. But I've never been compelled to actually write a review myself until now. I followed the ingredients exactly with the exception of adding a bit of kosher salt. I made it in the stand mixer with the dough hook, kneading for about 10 minutes. Then I kneaded by hand for probably another 10 minutes. I rested the dough. It looked beautiful. But I could not get it to feed through my pasta rollers without tearing to save my life!! Never before have I had such a problem. I thought it may have been too moist so I kneaded in more flour. Same problem. So I kneaded in water until it was more moist than it was to begin with. Same problem. I just could not get this dough to the right consistency to run through my machine without jamming, bunching up, tearing, etc. I had to throw it away. I've made pasta numerous times, never having this problem. I'll stick to the traditional simple whole egg/ flour/ salt recipe from now on.

Here are some pictures of how the dough should develop through kneading: http://www.foodoffmyblock.com/2011/09/02/kneading-pasta-dough/

Simple and less messy when made in the standing mixer with the dough hook. Delicious and worked easily without sticking through the hand-crank pasta machine.

Incredible pasta. I find that this is less 'tempermental' than the tradional pasta I make. I rolled it out & cut it with a pizza cutter(fettucinne) and served it with a Lobster & Asparagus sauce. Totally sublime! The pasta became an integral part of the dish. My friends were in heaven. And the recipe doubles very well.

i love this pasta! time will slow down to an absolute crawl as you knead, it seemingly takes forever, but it is so, so, so worth it. i heart thomas keller!

Don't be intimidated by the length of the recipe. 75% of it canned be summed up as "knead it until your arms hurt". It's really easy to make, and very, very good.

THIS DOUGH WAS SO EASY TO MAKE AND WORK WITH, I LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING IT AGAIN.

I must admit that this recipe goes against everything that my Italian grandmother taught me about pasta dough - one egg to one cup of flour and knead as little as possible. I'm glad I threw caution to the wind. This dough is exceptional- both tender and tasty. I ran my dough through the fettucine attachment and made a carbonara sauce. It was fantastic. Don't be scared of kneading this dough. The consistency is a little like soft silly putty. I will warn you, however, that it takes a good bit of time to mix dough in this manner. It's worth it for a special occasion and the results really are magnificent.

This is the best homemade pasta dough recipe I have ever made. Very tender and flavorful, and yet firm enough to hold its own with the sauce. I recommend the thorough kneading suggested here; the extra egg yolks will keep the pasta tender. I didn't make the agnolotti with it first time out, but used it to make sheets for lasagne on Christmas day - my guests couldn't stop raving. Definitely worth the extra work, and I will be making it again.
