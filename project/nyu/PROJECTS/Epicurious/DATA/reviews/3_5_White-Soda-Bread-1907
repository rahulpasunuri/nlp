Great basic recipe. I've made it multiple times, varying the flour used with combinations of white and whole wheat, and all variations have been tasty so far. I think the best has been with 1 1/2 C white flour, 2 C whole wheat. Note: if you are dairy allergic/intolerant, this recipe turns out well using "clabbered" soymilk as a substitute for the buttermilk. I add about a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to my measuring cup, then pour in enough soymilk to make 1 1/2 cups. Stir and it will separate a bit and get thick.

I made this bread to accompany the beef stew and braised cabbage I made for my husband and I to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. The bread turned out exactly as I thought it should - it's not meant to be a sweet, loaded with flavor bread... it's meant to be a lot simpler, made with simple ingredients that you have on hand. I made the bread exactly as described, with the exception of adding a bit of rosemary to the top right before I popped it into the oven. I cut a large, deep X in the dough and it cooked perfectly for me without being doughy. Next time, I think I'll do what another reviewer suggested and add garlic and a few other ingredients (yes, I know it's not supposed to be a dressed-up bread, but hey, recipes are meant to experiment I think) A great traditional Irish bread!

This is a great recipe. It was quick and easy to make and tasted delicious! My family loved it and ate it all up. It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Wow. This is an amazingly easy and amazingly good recipe. I was expecting something dry and not very leavened, but it rose really well and tasted moist and flavorful, even the next day. Surprisingly close in taste to a yeasted bread. This is a keeper. I used 1.5 cups while flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour.

Super easy and incredibly tasty! It ended up requiring more like 2 or 2 1/2 cups of buttermilk, but otherwise was free of complications. I used all whole-wheat flour and included the optional caraway seeds with great results. This bread has wonderful texture and good substance, and is great for people like me who can't eat foods containing yeast! Additionally, it's both healthy and economical.

I love this recipe. So versatile. I sometimes add small chunks of cheddar cheese or leave out the caraway seed and add gorgonzola. Always rave reviews when I make this.

Just threw this together. Used regular milk/white vinegar combo as I didn't have buttermilk. Use white flour. Threw in all the "buttermilk" at once and felt I should have held some back so sprinkled in more flour (about 1/2 c). Sprayed the top with olive oil pam and a very tiny sprinkle of sea salt to be sure it wasn't undersalted due to extra flour. Forgot to make the "x" initially and did it after the first couple of minutes. I was sure to make it very deep and go to the edges to avoid underbaked center as others noted. Perfectly baked after 35 minutes in a 390 degree convection oven. (I always decrease the temp 25 degrees using the convection and take off 5 min. but reduced temp to 390 and let it bake the full amount to be sure the middle wasn't underbaked)

This was the first soda bread I have made that came out very good. I added currants because I had some hanging around. The only thing I would add is that my bread came out a tad too moist in the middle. The next time I make it I will turn the oven down about halfway through and possibly cover it with foil to keep it from getting too brown.

I made this recipe as written (minus the caraway seeds) and it was terrible. The bread tastes uncooked (raw flour taste like another reviewer), perhaps it's my oven but I wouldn't try this again.

This was my first foray into baking ever. I picked this recipe because it seemed very easy and didn't require proofing or other frightening processes for the novice baker. I had a similar problem to some other reviewers ... the loaf didn't bake all the way through (I took EstherB's advice re: time and temp. Thinking it might be my oven). I'm going to try again and experiment with making the loaf thinner, hoping that will rememdy the baking time/taste problem. The big positive: this recipe prompted me to move on to other baking adventures and I'm really loving it!

The bread came together in 5 minutes. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I mixed 1 1/2 tablespoons of white vinegar with enough milk to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid. I cooked the loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for 35 minutes, but it wasn't completely done. The outside browned well and a toothpick came out clean, but it still had a raw flour taste. After 5 minutes in the oven, the outside was a dark brown but it was still slightly undone in the middle. Next time, I would follow another recipe's directions and cook it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then at 350 for another 10-15 minutes.

Always perfect. I've made it with all kinds of meals, for breakfast or dinner (the leftovers are good cold for breakfast the next morning, if there ARE leftovers), with or without the caraway seeds, and it never fails. It's a fast favorite in our house and is devoured by grown-up and kid alike. Tonight It's going alongside steaming bowls of Irish beef stew - nothing better!

To the cook who ended up with a brick, is it possible that your baking soda was old? Baking soda loses its potency after a while. That could definitely have made bricks. I did two loaves using all whole wheat flour, one with caraway seeds and one without, and they were both great! My sister thought the recipe could use a little more salt, but I thought the flavor was a great foil for the butter and cheese I served with them. Plus, the recipe came together in no time at all. I will absolutley make this again.

I just tried this bread with orange and lemon zest, poppyseeds, and subbing two eggs with fresh-squeezed orange juice for the buttermilk, I KNOW that I have deviated from the traditional Irish Soda Bread, but it WAS fabulous -- a great breakfast bread (It still took LESS than an hour).

This recipe is tasty, EXTREMELY simple, and the easiest I have found. It can easily be adapted to a particular flavour or texture you desire. Some may find this exact recipe bland, so be sure to have a bit of real salted butter and honey on hand for serving (similar to bisquits). Easy enough to make fresh everyday (I make it every other day). :D

This bread was super easy to make and tasted wonderful. I followed the recipe and it worked great. I am not sure why some of the other 'bad' reviewers had issues with this bread, this is pretty easy and tastes wonderful if you do it right.

This is a marvelous recipe! We made it exactly as stated for a St. Patrick's Day dinner and since then I have gone to experimenting with all sorts of variations. The most recent and most delicious was adding 1 Tbl Sugar, 2 cloves of crushed then chopped garlic, aprox. 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper, and aprox. 1 tsp fresh rosemary. Just before baking I also cracked more fresh pepper over the top of the loaf. It was glorious and I will continue trying many more variations of this simple starter recipe!

Turned into a brick. Good for feeding to the the ducks with my kids though. I'm a pretty good baker so don't really know where I went wrong. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour for brown as suggested but bread turned into a heavy, quite dangerous brick.

Very disappointed in this bread! It was dry and bland. I even added raisins, and still no flavor.

I made this bread yesterday for St. Patrick's day and was so pleased with the results. It was simple, quick and took so few ingredients. I substituted half the white flour with whole-wheat flour and added extra buttermilk. I also was careful not to overwork the dough, which resulted in a very tender bread and fine crumb.

I LOVED this bread! I was so surprised because I couldn't believe that the simple ingredients and then the ugly bread that appeared from them could be so good! We did add the caraway seeds and followed the recipe to a T. A Keeper!

I just tried this last evening. My variation: 3c organic whole wheat flour .5c white organic flour, 2-3 tablespoons of raw sugar. 1 handful of golden and 1 handful of Thompson raisins. 1-2 tbsp of lemon zest, 1-2 tbs of butter worked into flour, I also had to use 2 whole cups of buttermilk to get the dough wet enough to work. It's a hit here at work with some lemon curd and butter!

Great, simple soda bread recipe. I made two loaves last night - the first using white bread flour, and with the second one, I used 2 c. whole wheat flour, 1.5 c. white bread flour. They were both great, but the white tasted better than the brown. I'm still going to make brown in the future for the health benefits.

Made it exactly as recipe stated with caraway seeds. Turned out great. Will make it again.

I used 1.5 cups of wholewheat flour and 2 cups of all purpose flour - I followed the previous commenter's advice to keep extra buttermilk on hand in case the dough gets dry. I ended up using 1.75 - 2 cups of buttermilk. The bread turned out very nicely. A great crust with a soft inside. Good with butter and/or jam or with soup.

This was a disaster. I followed the recipe's suggestion of substituting whole wheat flour for half of the white flour. I can't begin to imagine how bad this would be if you tried to substitute ALL of it. The recipe did not at all mention that you need to increase the liquid by a lot if you use a harder wheat. When I realized this, the dough was already dry and tough and beyond help. The final product was hard as a rock, dense, and just... ugh. Despite the texture, the taste was alright, so I may try this recipe again with a different ratio of flours as well as liquid. However, Bon Appetit should know better than to suggest variations of a recipe while assuming you already know the other crucial changes you need to make.

I made this last night and the family had some this morning for breakfast. Turned out great and very easy to make. Dense bread and delicious with butter. I did heat it up this morning. Looking forward to making it again.

I had made soda bread before and it turned out dry and awful. I decided to try again with this recipe and I was so happy with the results. The bread came out moist and dense and flavorful. I really liked the use of buttermilk. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Unfortunately, I doubled this recipe and used up most of my buttermilk:( Did not like this recipe. Maybe there's too much baking soda?? but it had a funny smell to it(fishy?)and it's not any of the individul ingredients(i checked) I would reduce the soda a bit next time. Maybe when it is cold it will be better. The texture is good. I left out the caraway and added raisins, and sprinkled a bit of sugar on top before baking. I also would prefer it have a little sweetness, though it seems it's not traditional.

For once, I made this exactly as stated. Turned out a beautiful, perfect-looking loaf of bread. The recipe couldn't be simpler. Took about 5 min to put together. I think next time I'll try it as a biscuit-type dough and make individual breads.

Easy and quick - I just threw all the ingredients into my Kitchenaid mixer and it all came together with minimal mess. I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted yogurt. The bread was very good - dense, fragrant, and crusty. Delicious with a smear of jam or the juices from a nice thick stew. Next time I'm making two loaves to last out the week!

Very simple and easy. I don't particularly like caraway seeds, so i didn't pu them in. I was afraid that the bread would be too blah, so I put in two tablespoons of honey. I turned out great, not too sweet, but i think the honey really added something extra. I will definitely make this again!

A friend gave me this issue of Bon Appetit she found when she learned that my husband and I were planning to open an authentic Irish Pub. "Maybe you'll find something in here you can use" she said. To say the least... we referred to that issue as our bible! This soda bread is the most usable because it is without the sweetness of raisins or the caraway. It is as simple to make as it says and goes with all the meals. We bake up to 10 loaves daily for 3 years now.

This was so easy to make it might as well be called a quick bread. I'm usually a bread-disaster waiting to happen, but this was pretty idiot-proof. I left out the caraway, and this was still a good, simple bread.

Very easy to make, especially because it doesn't require many ingredients.I think it is too plain because of this-I left out the caraway seeds because I don't like them, maybe that's why. It could definately use some molasses or honey. Very dense & hearty. A 'winter' bread
