My husband and kids really liked it. I wish I had doubled it, and next time I will. I used "sticky rice" instead of long grain and made it in my rice cooker, and I substituted sesame oil for some of the oil. I will defifnitely make it again.

Pretty nice recipe, however I added some chive, sweet peppers and onions just to jazz it up a bit. This is a recipe for those days that are really hectic. It's simple and fast.

This needs: soy sauce to taste; egg - beaten, fried into a pancake, diced; chicken (if you want to add meat - poach and cut small; and some coriander (cilantro) Top with a splash of sweet chilli sauce for spice if you like it. Excellent!

I agree there is something missing, though it is pretty good. I added the green part of the scallions, salt, pepper, and lemon rind to "kick it up a notch" I multiplied the recipe by 3 so I could have a nice pot of it and I'm glad I did. The ginger is very nice, and I added a little extra. I think what may be missing to pull it all together is garlic! Still good and still pretty. My peas did not go pale like the previous writer said.

Kind of bland and definitely boring. Much better fried rice recipes to be found, even on this website. It is very quick and easy to make. Adding chicken or shrimp would help balance it out and give it more depth.

Easy to make and doesn't taste bad, just tastes OK...much too bland for me. I added soy sauce for extra flavor, but it needs something else.

The fried rice was so easy to make. My friends loved it. I'll definately make it again, next time I'll add some chicken or pork.
