It's hard to believe that the pizza we made is the same as the one the other reviewers have loved so much. My husband and I tried this last night and ended throwing half of it away (never happened before with any sort of pizza!!!). We felt this pizza was bland, that the flavors didn't meld well, and that adding the eggs--which had sounded intriguing--introduced an odd texture. All that arugula scattered over the top after cooking pretty much buries the pizza in raw greens. Normally we might like this sort of salady touch, but it just did't work for us.

Love the flavor combo - unique! A fresh, light pizza and yet filling. Great for a last minute, easy dinner. Sauteed the onions before placing on pizza. Enjoy with a earthy red wine!

This is phenomenal - the first time I made it, I misread the recipe and put red peppers instead of red onions on the pizza to hold the eggs - it works great and tasted wonderful. If you do this, I would suggest adding carmelized onions to the pizza when you put on the olives - the carmelized onions really added to the flavor - YUM!

This pizza looks amazing & has great ingredients, but BE REALLY CAREFUL cracking the eggs. My husband & I just got egg all over our pizza stone. My suggestion: put the onions down first, before cheese or anything, so that the eggs are better contained & don't run all over!

This pizza rocks! It is really tasty, and the flavors work together very well. I thought it was rather filling for a pizza, and could make a nice lunch or light dinner. It is also a very simple recipe to execute. My only suggestion for this recipe is that unless you like your eggs still really runny, add them a couple minutes earlier.
