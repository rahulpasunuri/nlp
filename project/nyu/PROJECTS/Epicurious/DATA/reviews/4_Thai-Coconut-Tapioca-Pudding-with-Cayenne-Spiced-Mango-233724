I made this dessert exactly as described and, for me, it came up short. I planned to take it to a dinner party, but after tasting it, I decided to bring something else instead. Something about it just tasted soapy to me and I couldn't eat more than a spoonful. And this is coming from someone who cooks mainly asian food and has all those ingredients in my kitchen at all times. Unfortunately, I won't be making this again.

Steeping the first few ingredients adds a different dimension and depth of flavor to this classic dessert. It is amazing!

I thought this was good. I guess I was expecting more after reading others' reviews. It was also a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I would use less sugar. I used lime peel and no galangal in this recipe and thought the flavors worked nicely together. The pudding did not thicken like I expected, so I added some cornstarch. I also think I like the pudding by itself with no mango.

Wonderful tapioca recipe. I had to drive great distances to find the ingredients but as I was catering a large event - it was worth it to me. For everyday family enjoyment - I'll probably substitute. All those brave enough to try tapioca, thought it was wonderful. Will definitely make again.

Delicious. We've made this over and over again. When we can't find the more exotic ingredients we're able to substitute pretty easily. It really is phenomenal!

I'm afraid this recipe has forever ruined regular tapioca pudding for me. Now milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla seem a boring dish when one can whip up Thai spiced coconut with spicy mangoes. Unlike most American adults today, tapioca pudding was a common dessert staple in my house growing up; in fact, I used to make it when I was so young I couldn't separate the eggs on my own. However, now I will be furtively on the lookout for galangal and kaffir leaves so I can make this instead. Note that it is unwise to make your infusion, add your tapioca pearls, and then remember you promised the babies a walk in the park. Upon returning and adding sugar and milk, a brief length of cooking causes pearls to start dissolving and sticking to the pan, despite much stirring. However, it being so delicious, I still managed to eat far beyond an elegant sufficiency.

Absolutely delicious. Brought this to an everyone-bring-a-dessert bridal shower. All the women loved it! I kept on getting compliments and recipe requests all night. So simple and quick, yet so refreshing, especially on a cold winters night. I cut down the sugar just a little and added canned tangerine segments at the end because I couldn't find any decent mangos. As a home cook whose specialty is not exactly desserts, this was so refreshing and delicious that it will definitely be added to my repertoire.

Simply outstanding. I've made it a few times and it has never failed to please everyone. In the initial steeping process, I add at least 50% more of everything except the water. I've also noticed that this recipe work well even when the mangos aren't that sweet. So don't skimp on the lime juice if you have sweet mangos. The contrast between the sweet tapioca pudding and slightly tart fruit really make the dessert fly.

The milk mixture curdled so I started over and it happened again. I even used new milk. I think maybe the ginger and lime leaves had too much acid in them.

This is delicious. It makes a lot. I reduced the sugar quite a bit, and added some condensed milk at the end. I also added a pinch of salt, and sprinkled cinamon at the end. The cayenned gives it an interesting twist.

Amazing! So goooood. You can save some dishes by not using a food processor, it seeps fine without it. You can also use a cheese cloth instead of a strainer if you want. Be sure to bash the lemon grass with a heavy object or a mallet so it is bruised. It is more flavorful after being bruised. (Smell it before and afterwards.) I cut the coconut milk in half to reduce the calories. I also went heavy on (almost doubled) the lemon grass and galanga and light on the ginger, because I think that is a little more reflective of thai cooking. In any case, it is a great recipe.

i went to 3 asian markets and couldn't find thai basil so i finally gave up and used regular. it was still soooooo yummy! the only thing i did different was i splashed a little coconut milk around the mango. my husband, who was a piggy and finished it off, said it was even better the next day! i didn't get a chance to taste it but i loved it warm

This was wonderful. What a delectable and easy way to end a thai inspired meal. As much as I enjoyed this though, I have to agree with kenyee from Boston: when chilled, I felt this pudding pretty much completely lost its delicate kaffir lime and galangal taste. When served warm, the tastes were much more pronounced. Also, I slivered several leaves of thai basil and mixed them in with the pudding as opposed to just using as a garnish. It tasted delicious and made up for some the flavor lost during chilling.

An excellent and easy recipe that involves a minimal amount of planning ahead. That is, if you have all the ingredients on hand.

delicious. the ginger, lime leaves, lemongrass and basil flavors really shine. i sprinkled the top of each serving with some unsweetened coconut, minced crystalized ginger and chopped basil. i didn't have mango on hand, so i used fresh pineapple sprinkled with sugar and cayenne instead. perhaps try a combination of mango, pineapple and kiwi... yum.

Excellent tapioca dish. It's not really pudding consistency...more like a soup. There's a dessert at chinese restaurants that this is a much improved variation of in case you're wondering why it sounds familiar. The tapioca pudding was more interesting tasting when it was warm...the ginger/lemongrass flavor nearly disappeared when it was chilled and/or the mango overpowered it. Try it different ways (warm, chilled, w/ and w/o mango)...it's good enough to try different ways :-) The galanga and lime leaves are pretty hard to find, but you can probably substitute ginger and lime zest as others have noted. Galanga is basically thai ginger..it's a little less ginger tasting than regular ginger. At any rate, the final result is more flavorful than any version of this I've had at a chinese restaurant, so big thumbs up for me!

Wow. This is stunning. I wanted to use the ingredients in my kitchen so I made liberal substituions and it was still great. When I made the infusion, I dropped the galangal, and increased the ginger and lemongrass. I used strips of lime peel since it was going into the processor anyway. When I made the tapioca, I substituted 6Tbs. of quick-cooking tapioca and cooked it according to the directions on the box. That means that I soaked the tapioca in the infusion, milk and sugar for 5 minutes, brought to the boil, then took it off the heat and added the coconut milk. Divine.

This tapioca is so freakin' fantastic I don't know what to say other than I made it again right after trying it the first time!
