OHEMGEE this recipe was fantastic. I only used two garlic cloves in the sauce (four cloves of garlic for two people seemed a bit much), and added basil and sesame oil. Steamed the fish (whatever fish I had in the freezer - tilapia?) over broccoli and served over brown rice. I had leftover sauce, which I saved simply because I couldn't bring myself to throw it away. So good!

I had to substitute pre-cut Halibut since my store did not have a whole fish. Additionally, I did not have a Bamboo steamer so I used my regular pot with a steamer set into it. The fish turned out perfect and it was so delicious and flavorful. I would definitely make this again.

This turned out great, and is quite simple. I used whole rainbow trout, and made the paste in a food processor. My bamboo steaming basket was way too small for the fish so I sort of crammed it in there. 15 minutes cooked to perfection.

Excellent recipe, I used 'Pearl Perch' (a white fish) filet instead of the whole fish and steamed it in a plate in the wok. Served it on steamed coconut rice with a simple dressed (Sesame/Honey/Soy) English Spinich Salad. Great flavours.

This is excellent!!!! I made the recipe exactly as stated and will definitely make again. The only thing I would do differently is use bass filets instead of the whole fish to avoid the bones. The cooking time was spot on. Also any mild white fish would work.
