The cookies are delicious but difficult to roll and cut. The trick is with the temperature of the dough. You have only couple of minutes to work with the dough, coming from the refrigerator, until is soft and unworkable. Add more flour, since stars melt apart in the oven. First batch of cookies came out thin and without any recognizable shape. I added more flour and the next batch was presentable. The recipe needs work.

I wanted to have a "first go at it" with this type of cookie. Our youngest has a star cookie cutter and she saw the picture of these cookies on the computer. This was a very tricky one. The temp of the dough had to be just right or everything stuck!!! I will keep looking for the right one to come along. Or, just stick to my fabulous fudge.
