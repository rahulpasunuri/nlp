Yum! Didn't follow the recipe exactly. Instead of pureeing everything I only pureed the beans and spinach (fresh). I sauteed the onions with garlic and mushrooms and added some white wine, then added the pureed mixture to the pan. I let it simmer for about five minutes. Added a dollop of yogurt to my dish before serving/eating. I'll make it again for sure.

A great healthy version to creamed spinach. I used a hand blender just a little bit to leave some consistency. Great the next day too and would make a nice soup base as well.

This recipe was fabulous! I did make it with fresh spinach, which really makes it so sweet. Some we ate straight, some we put on pasta, and if there had been any left, it could have been turned into a dip or soup, it was that tasty! But the bowl was even mopped up with bread, and every bit vanished.

I loved the original recipe as it appeared in Sass' "Short Cut Vegetarian" -- just spinach, stock powder, beans, and lemon juice. Totally amazing and healthy. My kids (3 and 7) even eat this.

I just made this to go alongside the Mushroom Pecan burgers and found it to be a nice accompaniment. It just feels so healthy and was quite tasty when adequately salted and when the lemon juice was added (not optional in my opinion). Very nice.
