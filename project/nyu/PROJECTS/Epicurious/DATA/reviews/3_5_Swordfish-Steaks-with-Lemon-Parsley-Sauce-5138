Marinade is scrumptious! I had some fresh oregano available so I threw some of that in as well. Would work with any type of fish.

I made this exactly as written (but only marinated for an hour) and it was so delicious. Great flavors don't overpowering the fish. I served it with very simple cubed and roasted eggplant, which was also great with the sauce, and a tomato and basil salad. Scrumptious.

Made this last night and it was delicious. Marinated for about 2 hours and grilled the fish on the barbeque. The flavor was exceptional and we decided it's a keeper for sure!

This was terrible! Based on the ingredient list I thought I would love this recipe, but the lemon overpowered the entire dish. I couldn't even finish the fish and I usually love anything with lemon flavoring.

Made this last night for company.I don't cook swordfish alot so I found this and tried it. It is delicious !! Very easy ,moist and tender. I will definately make this again.

This recipe is incredibly easy to make and the fish came out delicious. I more or less winged it with the ingredients - throwing in handfuls of parsley, zest and juice of a whole lemon, a healthy dose of olive oil, and lots of garlic. I then mixed everything in a blender and adjusted the flavor by smell. I marinated the fish for about 30 minutes and then seared and cooked it on a cast iron skillet.

Very good, power went out while marinating so grilled instead of broiling. Also didn't have quite enought parsley, but still tasted great, we enjoyed it, kids included.

I was looking for a simple recipe that would keep my swordfish moist and tasty. This is it. The family loved it!

The sauce is delicious! I served this with green beans and used the sauce to dress them.

Very tasty. I tossed all the herbs and what not in the food processor. Served with roasted new potatos with spring herb pesto and spinach sauteed in garlic and olive oil. Next time I make it I'll prob use mahi mahi

broiling fish makes me very nervous, so i used the convection roast setting at 325 and baked for 20 minutes uncovered. it was perfect--next time i will attempt to conquer my "fear of broiling".

I didn't have any parsely on hand, and substituted with basil and grilled the steaks - the contrasting flavors were a delight!

Delicious! Instead of broiling I tossed it on the grill, and that just helped the flavor. Definitely recommend this one!

My husband, my sister and I absolutely loved this recipe! Instead of broiling, however, I cut the fish into 1-inch chunks and marinated it and some white and crimini mushrooms in the sauce, adding more garlic than called for. After an hour or so, I threaded the fish and mushrooms onto skewers along with some fresh red peppers and onions, and grilled 'em on the barbecue. Absolutely delish! I'm adding this to my recipe box and will definitely it again and again.

My family and I liked this dish. There are some other swordfish recipes on this site we prefer; Swordfish with Balsamic Brown Butter Sauce, and Pan-seared Swordfish Steaks with Shallot,Caper, andBalsamic Sauce.

Also excellent with lime instead of lemon and cilantro instead of parley.

I'm not a big swordfish fan, but I like trying new recipes and getting a varied diet, so I made this one. Loved the sauce. Still not really sold on swordfish, but I'd make the sauce/marinade again in an instant. It might do well with Kabobs (of either swordfish or some other seafood or chicken).

This is a keeper, it was so delicious and legal too! I reduced the oil by half. I'm on the South Beach Diet and this fit right in with what I'm allowed to eat. Delicious and I loved every bite!

This fish was excellent, though it was a little intense. We loved it though, and I would definitely make it again.

Excellent, easy, healthy and tasty. I used less oil than the recipe called for.

Great. Light. Simple. Elegant. Careful broiling, the oil splashes a bit. Plan on a bit more time and lower rack. Great!

The parsley/lemon marinade is a winner. Being a "fat conscious household", I've cut the olive oil in half with no downside in either cooking the fish or taste. I use the marinade on any white fish and have even served it on toasted baguette rounds as an appetizer.

Cooked this on my grill pan and added a can of artichoke hearts, halved. It was incredible and so easy. The sea salt is definitely worth the trouble and expense.

August 2, 2002 Great recipe, definitely made a big hit with the family. Used 1/4 to 1/2 in steaks and had time only to marinate to 1 1/2 hrs but still was great. I grilled the steaks instead, they were just wonderful and easy to do. A definite make again.

Delicious! I'd say let it marinade the full 3 hours. Flavor is terrific, easy prep time, great on the grill. Instead of grated lemon, I fine chopped 2 tablespoons of lemon pulp and rind together. I also used dried parsley, 1/4 instead of fresh and it was still good!

I was attempting to replacate one of my favorite entrees from an Italian restautant in Connecticut and the ingredients for this recipe sounded right on target. Everyone at my dinner party raved about it and I cannot wait to make it again. Incidently, I served it with spagatini filetto di pomodoro.

I used basil rather than parsley and addded Key lime juice to marinade. Also, sliced Roma tomatoes to create a bed for the marinated swordfish and baked in convection oven for app. 7 minutes. Members of the local country club gave it rave reviews. I will use this as a special in the future.

I also like to broil swordfish with lemon. I found this recipe to be quite delicious, quick and easy. An especially good dish for a beginner cook as well as a "seasoned" vet.

I usually marinate swordfish with lemon and serve it with a sauce like this one. This recipe was no better than ones I have used in the past. But it was OK.

This is a very simple recipe to make and it tastes great! I served it with spinach and it was a perfect combination.
