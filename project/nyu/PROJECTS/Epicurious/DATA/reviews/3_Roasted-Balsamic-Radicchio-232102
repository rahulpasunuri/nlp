I really, really enjoyed this recipe. I think it best if you've never had radicchio - or haven't had it much - to take the bad reviews of this recipe with a large grain of salt. It's the kind of vegetable you either love or hate. I love it and this is a simple, delicious way to serve it. I made a balsamic reduction as I didn't have high quality balsamic on hand. Excellent and simple.

My wife followed the recipe exactly and I feel bad for the poor plant, it is the first vegetable that I found that I don't like. I had to imagine that it was very healthy as I battled the thing trying to cut through it, chew it and deal with the bitter taste. I needed a quick dose of chocolate to recover from it. Note that my son liked it, so it must be a love/hate thing with this one.

Excellent recipe. I didn't change a thing. This would be wonderful paired with a rich dinner. I can also see using it as a base for a warm salad.

I've made this many times. The high temp means the radicchio gets slightly charred, which I tend to like. I usually make this when we're having a richer pasta like bolognese or pesto but want something besides a salad.

Sorry but this was nasty. Bitter, fibery, hard to chew and cut. I ate it because I was hungry and I knew I followed the recipe, but yeah. Bleargh.

This is so delicious. Between the caramelization and the balsamic, it mutes the bitterness and makes the radicchio crispy and wonderful. Love.

I agree... a great way to cook radicchio. I would not skip the thyme. If you love the bitterness of raddichio, then I'd highly recommend this dish. But don't expect the roasting and the basalmic vinegar to balance out the bitterness all that much.

Great way to cook radicchio ... with or without fresh thyme. 450 degrees in my oven is too high; I've been using 400.
