1st rate!!! I made this as 1 oval loaf instead of 2 rounds. I've been looking for a yeastless bread to use in an everyday fashion, and I have found it. I love the frugality of the ingredients, and I love the fact that there isn't a huge amount of fat used!!! Bravo, and Thank-you so much!!!!

I make this every year for St. Patrick's Day with corned beef and cabbage and it's always great. Makes excellent toast.

They should rename this one Irish wheat biscuts, cause thats pretty much what it is, one big giant biscut. It was really hard on the outside when it cooled. I wouldnt recommend this recipie.

This is a wonderfully simple, earthy sort of bread. I used currants and really loved it warm with butter (the toast thing -- it's really all about it being warm!). I enjoyed it a great deal. Mine seemed to take less than 50 minutes (closer to 40 minutes) to get completely cooked and golden brown.

This is a good Irish soda bread recipe if you want one that is more like bread than like cake. It is easy to make. It makes very good toast, too. The cook from California should not compare this to a yeast bread - the texture is totally different.

From the reviews, I thought this would be a great bread. I didn't have currants so I used dried cranberries and I added 1/2 of sliced almonds. The bread came out tasting very dry and way to "floury" tasting! Would the almonds and cranberries really make that much of a difference?! I'd like to try it again. Suggestions???

I made this recipe for a party, and my husband and I ate one of the loaves right away. It was SO GOOD! It may be one of those foods I'd want on a desert island ... sweet currants, slightly salty bread, YUM! It was definitely best the same day. Freezing it seemed to diminish it somewhat.

This was a nice bread but it just doesn't compare but the taste and texture of my favorite yeast wheat breads.

I have made this recipe twice subsituting the buttermilk with plain lowfat/nonfat yogurt (as a guest is lactose-intolerant) and omitting the raisins. It can out wonderful each time.

THE BEST WHEAT BREAD I HAVE TASTED! The only change I made was to omit the raisins (I wanted a plain wheat bread). It was fast and easy to make and I'll definitely be making this one at least once a week! A definite keeper!!! Thank you.

HAS THE TASTE I REMEMBER FROM A BIKING TRIP IN IRELAND LAST YEAR. STAYED IN B&BS AND HAD THIS SAME TYPE OF BREAD ALMOST DAILY. I USED KING ARTHUR IRISH WHEAT FLOUR, AND IT WAS GOOD FRESH AND LATER TOASTED WITH JAM. I ALSO USED DRIED CRANBERRIES IN PLACE OF THE CURRANTS. VERY GOOD!
