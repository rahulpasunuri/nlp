It does look good but for dessert, not breakfast. There's just not enough substance here for a breakfast. This little dab is supposed to hold an adult human for 4-5 hours until lunchtime? No fiber to speak of, no fat to speak of that would make it stay with me for a while? It's a recipe for feeling wan in the middle of the morning and overeating at lunch, or for going back into the kitchen at 10:30 to get something more to eat.

This dessert takes less then five minutes to make and it's light, and delicious. I also love how you can make it as is, or use almonds instead of pistachios.
