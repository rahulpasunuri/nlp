Found this pretty thick so added 1/3 C beer (this is a good addition, believe me) and a couple more tbs of olive oil. Let it mellow a couple of hours, at least, to combine flavors before serving. Don't forget to cut out the green sprouts from the garlic if you find some in the center, they are bitter tasting)

This is a good basic recipe. I took others suggestions and increased yogurt and lemon juice by 1 TB. Saved liquid from beans and added olive oil to get a smoother consistency. Also added approx. 1 TB Asian chili-garlic sauce to give it a kick. Everyone loved it!

Yogurt, yay! Less tahini, less guilt! But... wait a minute... it doesn't quite do it. This can be a really great recipe, but in my opinion (and how I imagine a yummy hummus should taste) it demands a few modifications. As is, two forks; with some changes, four forks. In that vein, I don't think the recipe was too garlic-y (as some others noted; roasting the garlic first would kick the garlic potency in the butt), but definitely needed to be kicked up and smoothed out. I added another tablespoon or so of yogurt and a splash of olive oil to make it more velvety (olive oil is good for you; really, it is). I threw in another teaspoon of cumin and a couple dashes cayenne. I added salt and pepper "to taste" and presto! Deliciousness in a bowl! (Next time I'm staying true to my hummus roots and, as I mentioned, roasting the garlic before pureeing it with its hummus-y friends.)

Too much garlic! Would use less next time. I also added olive oil and more lemon, yogurt and tahini.

This hummus is so easy, yummy and healthy. It's a great source of protein and my kids absolutely love it. I make it at least once a week and serve it with pita wedges and veggies.

There is way too much garlic in this recipe. It was overpowering, and I am a big garlic fan! Additionally, to make it smooth I had to add extra yogurt, tahini and a touch of olive oil. Otherwise it was a bit gritty.

Yup thats Hummus! So much better than that store bought stuff. Easy to make too. Very very good :)

I've been using this as my hummus recipe for about 7 years, and it's also the hummus recipe everyone asks for. People who don't like hummus typically devour this one. The yogurt makes a creamier, fluffier hummus, taking away some of the texture concerns some folks have. I add cayenne pepper always, a good pinch of salt, and some ground black pepper. Serve with pita, tortilla chips, or smear on some thick bread and top with tomatoes, cucumbers, and onion. This recipe is a winner.

Good but it seemed a little too thick to me so I added a splash of olive oil at the end.

Great idea to add yogurt, makes a light creamy hummus. I did however add a touch of extra virgin olive oil for a smoother mouth feel.

This is so wonderful! I've been making hummus for 20+ years and never thought to add yogurt. It's a perfect addition. I used whole cumin seeds, roasted red pepper & roasted garlic, added extra yogurt and red pepper flakes, a tsp of olive oil and made my own tahini. I will use this recipe from now on!

I personally enjoyed the flavour as much as any other hummus recipe.

The recipe above needs a little tweaking, but it's a good way to reduce the fat in homemade hummus. I reserved two tablespoons of liquid from the canned garbanzo beans and added that after pureeing to give the hummus a smoother, less coarse texture. I also added cayenne and more garlic (alternatively you could use roasted red peppers or basil) for flavor.

This was great. I used a bit more garlic, regular-fat yogurt, and a little bit more lemon juice. I also added some cayenne. Yum!

Rating: 3
Per prior reviews, I added extra lemon juice & yogurt (about 1 T each), extra garlic cloves and used a bit a sesame oil since I didn't have any tahini. I added some cayenne pepper (3-4 shakes) but probably would not add so much next time when I serve to other people.

better than store bought, a little thick, needed to add more liquid

Three forks, but only b/c this recipe as is misses some zip. Otherwise, it's a great hummus that can be made in 5 min. I double the yogurt and add a little olive oil. Also, to keep things easy, I use sesame seeds instead of tahini.

Great recipe - Mine turned out very thick so I added an extra tbsp of yogurt and extra lemon juice. Also add some sesame oil. Definate make again!

For a spicier version, try adding a tablespoon or so of hot green salsa (e.g., La Victoria's green salsa jalapena.)

I've added chopped, roasted red peppers as well.

Great lower-fat hummus. I didn't have tahini on hand and so substituted a drizzle of sesame oil. Also great with double the garlic and lots of fresh ground black pepper and cayenne instead of the cumin. Yum!

great recipe--I agree with the red pepper, and I didn't use olive oil, but I did use regular plain yogurt instead of nonfat. It made the hummus slightly fluffier; delicious!

Very easy, delicious, and healthier than your basic hummus. I have made this many times, my guests love it.

This is an excellent basic hummus recipe. Very creamy even without the olive oil. Also good with roasted garlic or some red pepper.

Really easy to prepare. Makes a great summer meal since there's no cooking involved. We had it with some toasted pita bread and fresh raw veggies such as cucumbers, red peppers, tomatoes.

Absolutely delish!! I didn't add tahini or olive oil and didn't miss either one. Added a bit more lemon juice and garlic.

Like other reviewers, I thinned this with some of the liquid from the beans and added more lemon juice. A very tasty, lower-fat dip that can be made in minutes - I'll make it again and again.

This was as good as the full-fat hummus I just had in a restaurant today. I went home and made this in twenty minutes. Super easy and a big hit with the family! I used twice as much lemon juice, a bit more garlic, and a half tablespoon more yogurt. I also used jarred Christopher Ranch chopped garlic in olive oil instead of whole cloves. This is very tasty with fresh flatbread.

This was another great recipe. I do not care for Hummus myself I made it for my wife with adding seasoned salt to the mix with some lime but red pepper and onion, but otherwise as directed. She loved it and our company that has tried it raves about, have to give out the recipe every time. Excellent!!!

Boy is this good stuff! I've never made my own hummus before but will from now on. This is 50 times better than anything you can buy in a store. The only substitution I made was sour cream instead of yogurt. The hummus and toasted pita chips were completely gone in minutes!

This is fantastic! You don't miss all the oil at all! I forgot to buy yogurt, so I subbed sour cream and it worked perfectly.

Wow! What a great, low-fat dish. I skimped a little on the tahini, and added more yogurt, and it was great! The second time I added it, I put in some minced onion - for those who like their hummus a bit chunky, this was a great addition.

Ok, Substitution Queen here... I ran out of tahini so I just went with the yogurt and a little sesame oil instead. I also doubled the recipe and used 1 can of cannellini beans and 1 can of garbanzos. I added some chili powder for extra flavor since I omitted the tahini. Obviously it would have been better with the paste, but this was pretty darned good! Also, a note about the fat content. Tahini is super good for you, it's a "good" type of fat which raises your "good" cholesterol, so don't worry about that! Instead, eat the hummus with veggies like lightly steamed green beans, raw carrots, snow peas, etc...YUMMY!

Made this yesterday and loved it. I'd recently had hummus down in the Caribbean that had a balsamic bite to it, so duplicated that and it came out great. I simply added 2 Tablespoons red wine vinegar to the recipe since I had no balsamic on hand. Delicious. I also doubled the garlic and used the juice of one whole fresh lemon (approx. 3 Tablespoons), and I did use 1/2 teaspoon salt. I will make this a stape in my home since I'm watching fat and cholesterol. I honestly could not tell the difference between this and other full-fat hummus from health food store. I only used 1/2 teaspoon cumin because I was tentative, but after tasting it, will probably use the full amount of cumin next time.

Awesome! Finally a low fat recipe that tastes like the original. Doubled the garlic and that is really the only thing I changed.

Rating: 3
Very good, basic, hummus recipe. I generally prepare a double batch 3x/month, and use one can of chickpeas and one can of cannelini beans -- makes for a smoother paste. I agree with other reviewers to use max garlic and more lemon. I thought I'd miss the olive oil and beaucoup tahini but loved the suggestion of sesame oil -- a tiny bit gives SOOO much of the same flavor.

Rating: 4
This was great! You would never know that this was not the full-fat version of traditional hummus. I added 7 garlic cloves and a bit more tahini than the recipe called for. I also added some of the reserved liquid from the canned chickpeas to get the right consistency. Very nice!

Rating: 4
Great tasting health food!! I have made this several times, with minor modifications. I use the juice of an entire lemon,lots of garlic (at 6 least cloves), lots of ground pepper, and a tiny bit of sesame oil. I've forgotten to add cumin on occasion, and it is just as good. This is great with crudites and toasted pita!

I really enjoyed this lower fat version of hummus, however I personally thought it needed more lemon and a dash more of the tahini. I also added a small amount of water to get the smooth consistancy I was looking for! I will make this again for sure!

This recipe is very close in flavor to the high fat traditional version with lots of olive oil and tahini. I used to enjoy hummus only as a treat because I adhere to a low fat diet, but this version I can have regularly. I use triple the amount of garlic and twice the amount of lemon juice and sprinkle fresh parsley on top.

i love hummus, but rarely use tahini in it and don't miss it (especially the fat!).

Good as a basic recipe guide. Good idea to add quite a bit more spice cumin and spike to get the flavor just right. Serve with pita bread wedges sprayed with olive oil and sprinkled with Spike and broiled.
