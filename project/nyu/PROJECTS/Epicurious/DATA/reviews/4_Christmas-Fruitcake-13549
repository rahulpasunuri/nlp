Has anyone tried this recipe as cup cakes? I use foil cup cake "papers" for fruit cakes and would like to try this one.

I have been making this wonder for 9 years now, and ever since I made some improvements, for instance I leave the fruit soaking for a couple of weeks, and we leave the cake in a wooden box for six months pouring brandy (I use it instead of dark rum) over it every two weeks for the first two months! This is a real hit at home, every one is looking after christmas dinner for this specialty

I make this every year in mini loaf pans to give away and they are a huge hit! The first year I made it I soaked more fruit with the intent of making more right away, which never happened; so the fruit ended up soaking for a year. The following year they were so wonderful that I have done it that way ever since. Highly recommended-just turn the fruit every couple of months or whenever you think of it. I also submerge the fruit in order to have enough liquid to drain into the batter. Yum!

WhenI was growing up A&P sold Ann Page fruitcakes and I used to wait all year just to bite into one. This recipe is as close to that ambrosia as I have ever found. I too cut back on the jam and gave the cake a rum bath once a week for several weeks before cutting into it. Wonderful.

I rate it three forks, but the rating is really for my altered version. The original was too sweet imo, and I don't like using those glaceed fruits anyway. On my second attempt I used 7.5-8 cups of assorted dried fruits and nuts. I poured 2 cups of hot rum (Grand Marnier is nice also or any fruity liqueur) over them and let the fruit macerate for at least 4 hours, overnight is fine. Next day I made the cake recipe as indicated, through the egg ingredient (only needed four as I did not glaze.) Baked it in two 8" round cake pans (using doubled foil pans worked fine as it's easier to give them away in disposable pans.) I did place a pan of hot water in the oven to increase moistness. Depending on the pans you use, check for doneness after a reasonable length of time. The tester should not come out wet, but not bone-dry. I removed from the oven and let them sit in the pans for about 15 minutes. Using a skewer I poked some holes and poured another generous cup of hot liquor over each one. I let them cool in the pan, then wrapped tightly and refrigerated (refrigeration increases the firmness, easier to cut them.) A few days later I added another 1/2-3/4 cup of room temp liquor to each, wrapped tightly again. I have been told that these are my best fruitcakes ever, and I am a pretty well-thought of baker.

I really hate fruitcake but made this recipe for my mother. It's delicious!! Everyone who's tasted it loves is, fruitcake lovers and haters alike. The only thing I noticed is that there wasn't any juice left to strain in the batter once the dried fruit was soaked overnight. Oh well, I just added more!! I would add at least 1/2 cup more walnuts the next time, though.

This is not the recipe for me, I found it much too sweet, and I used primarily unsweetened dried fruit and maybe 2 cups of the glaceed. I think the apricot glaze put the sweetness way over the top. More than 20 years ago Gourmet published a recipe for Fruitcake Haters' Fruitcake which I think is still the best ever:Cream together 4 sticks (2c) butter, with 2 1/4 c brown sugar, and 1 c honey. Add 10 eggs one at a time, beating well. In another bowl sift together 4 c sifted flour, 2 t each of cinnamon and baking powder, 1 t allspice, 3/4 t salt. Stir half of dry mix into the sugar mix. In remaining dry mix dredge 7 1/2 cups assorted dried fruit bits and nuts (apricots, dates, pecans, golden raisins, etc). Combine 1 c apricot nectar, 1/2 c light cream,& 2 T lemon juice, add to batter, fold in the fruits. Divide batter among 4 buttered and floured 9.5 by 5 inch loaf pans and bake in preheated 250 degree F (yes,250) oven for 2.5-3 hours, until tester comes out clean. Let cool in pans on a rack. In a bowl combine 1 c brandy and 1/4 c orange liqueur and sprinkle each cake with 1/4 the mixture. Let cakes stand one hour. Remove from pans, wrap tightly in foil, chill at least one week. Excellent!

This is time-consuming but it's the best fruitcake recipe ever. People who thought they didn't like fruitcake LOVED this. I also used an assortment of dried fruits (apricots, dates, and cherries) instead of expensive glaceed fruit, and citron instead of angelica (basically the same thing, it's just candied citrus peel instead of candied root). I only made one cake last year and it disappeared so fast that this year I'm making two.

Although we were sceptical of any fruit cake recipe, we found this to be a wonderful cake that we modified with excellent results. We used an assortment of dried fruits rather than glaceed fruits(dates, figs, apricots, coconut pieces, banana chips, papaya, all soaked in rum over night,) for a lighter, less caloric cake. We also saw no need to strain the apricot glaze and it came out fruity and natural. Finally, we used a simple, deep cake pan - teflon coated - and it worked well too! Would definitely make this cake again for a special occasion!

I cant fault this rich cake for complexity fruitiness and sheer delight.. eaten with a dram of 12 year old Whisky and a wad of cheshire cheese. .. absolutely tops but is best after three months of storage.. Who can wait?

"Angelica" had no idea what it is and couldn't find it - used candied pineapple instead. Also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a package of chopped dates. The changes were my own personal tastes. This is a great basic recipe. One word to the wise however. This cake sticks like you wouldn't believe! I tried making it in a fluted bundt pan so it would be pretty. DON'T!!! That was my mistake and a quarter of it stuck in the pan when unmolding despite greasing and flouring (that's why I could taste it before it aged for this Christmas). Do what the recipe says and use loaf pans lined with parchment paper, both on all sides and the bottom. I'm aging my 3/4 of the fruitcake by wrapping it in cheesecloth soaked in rum and storing it in an airtight container until Christmas eve. It won't be as pretty as I had thought, but it should taste GREAT!

Great! My additions - soaked fruit in peach brandy for 2 wks. used cherry flavored cranberries, maraschino cherries and dates in addition to fruit above. After 2 wks. added cup orange juice to fruit, soak 1 wk more. added juice and fruit to cake! Fantastic! I'd invite you over but it may not last till Christmas.

Angelia is a biennial herb that grows up to 2metres (around 6-8ft). Its thick, juicy stems are glaced (candied) to produce the green bits that you buy in the supermarket or gourmet suppliers.

I make this for a friend every Christmas and on her birthday. That's how crazy she is about it. Her husband claims he does not like fruitcake and he won't leave a crumb behind.

Have been making this recipe every Christmas for the last five or six years. It makes a great gift for those who love fruitcake.

I was out of rum or brandy so i substituted orange juice and a Tbs of vanilla extract. It was a time consuming, intensive recipe, but worth it.

I haven't made the cake, but I know what angelica is! It's like a candied peel thing, and I think it comes from a root. It tastes sweet, it has the texture of peel. It used common in England, used as a cake decoration. You can get it in any supermarket there, in the cake decorating department. Oh yeah, it's GREEN!

This is a good recipe. Like the first reviewer, I have no idea what "angelica" is. A couple of suggstions: I think the cooking time is too long by about 10 minutes. Also, I recommend letting the flavors "bloom" by brushing it with brandy or rum a number of times over the first few weeks and not serving it until it has rested a least a month. For serving, if you slice the cake down the middle, then make perpendicular slices, you can deal with the awkward round shape. A cup of orange spice tea and a slice of this fruitcake: heaven!!!

I'm not a big fruitcake fan but this was delicious. I left out the Angelica. (Maybe you'll have better luck trying to find it than I did.) As a round cake, it's rather awkward to slice.
