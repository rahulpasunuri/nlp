This was the most beautiful turkey. The color and glazing is perfect. The gravy is FANTASTIC! The turkey is good but I agree with Idaho Falls that it could use a little umph. I sort of became just a good vehicle for the amazing gravy I am planning to repeat the gravy, but experiment with the herbs on the bird a bit.

I first made this recipe in 1998 as well, and I have used it ever since! The gravy is by far the best part of the recipe, but the turkey is always moist too. I even won over people who don't normally eat turkey! Don't even consider another recipe this year... go to the store now and but what you need for this one!!!

This recipe is a perennial favorite for Thanksgiving. It looks beautiful. Has an exquisite taste. The crabapple jelly may be hard to find, but the tartness makes a difference.

This is the standard by which I measure all other turkey recipes.

Stop reading and make this NOW. Brine and cook the bird according to Alton Brown's instructions, following this recipe. The result was a turkey so beautiful and moist that there was nothing left for left-overs. This was my first turkey, and I needed to impress my family of cooks. It worked and now all future Thanksgivings will be at my house. Which might be something to consider before unveiling this beauty on your own clan.

My husband said over and over, "Even if this doesn't taste good at all it is the most beautiful turkey I have ever seen." Luckily for this cook it was delicions too. The most tender turkey I have ever had, and that's saying a lot for a 28lb bird

I have made this every year since the recipe came out. Do not skip the gravy! It is out of this world. If you cannot find applejack it will still turn out okay. You can sub, or go without the alcohol.

We tried this recipe when it was first published in Bon Appetit in 1998 and have made it every year since. Although it is a bit of work it is well worth it. The meat is moist and the gravy is out of this world good.

Ever since I first prepared this dish ( Thanksgiving 1998 ) I will never make a turkey any other way again.

Both the gravy and turkey were great, though I couldn't find any crabapple jelly either, and had to substiture apple jelly. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but the turkey turned out very moist, and the gravy great. Everyone loved it. I slso injected the turkey with apple-jack before roasting.

The turkey was only so-so, but the gracy was delish! I got rave reviews over the gravy, although I did have to substitute apple jelly, as there was not a single store in my city that carried crabapple. The turkey itself was good, just not a standout. I think I will keep the gravy recipe and make it with a different turkey.

My husband gave this 4 forks, we both really liked it. I used Calvados instead of the applejack. The turkey is just turkey, but the gravy has a sweet (but not overpoweering)flavor.

This is an amazing recipe. It is easy and fantastic. I have served two Christmas' in a row and have had people beg me for the recipe, especially the gravy. After reading the other reviews, you have got to try the gravy It is beyond words delicious. I know Applejack is hard to find but it is well worth the hunt.

This gets four forks for the gravy alone! The turkey is just fine, but all turkey tastes about the same to me. But the gravy is by far the best I've ever made. Would even serve as a dark rich "sauce" for a pork or beef meal.

My family thought this turkey was perfect! The appearance was beautiful, and the meat was very moist and had a great flavor. The only thing I omitted was the Apple Jack. I will definitely make it again in the future!

This was a hit at my house; very tasty but not overpowering. Also, easy to make - probably because I omitted the gravy. Regardless, the applejack/tarragon butter glaze was very flavorful.

Searched all over for the applejack-very hard to find, but wanted to stay true to the recipe. The bird was absolutely beautiful, the stuffing was rather blah (but we're used to sage) and the gravy was terrible. A lot of work, expense, and not worth it.
