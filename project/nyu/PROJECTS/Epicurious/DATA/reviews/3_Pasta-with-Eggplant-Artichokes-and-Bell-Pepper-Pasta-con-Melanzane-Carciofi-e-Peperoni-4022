Very good dish--and filling with just a small portion. I amended it a bit for flavor and health: used whole wheat penne pasta, added red pepper flakes and oregano, and a small can of crushed tomatoes. The tomatoes helped thin out the otherwise too thick eggplant "sauce," and gave it a nice, tart bite. One more "must" finishing touch: fresh chopped Italian parsley on top just before serving.

I made a few changes to simplify and the result was still amazing. 1) Cut the bell peppers before roasting into stripes and sprinkled with salt, oregano and red flakes. I also added some unpeeled garlic cloves to the mix 2) Used canned artichokes, cut them into pieces and fried them in olive oil before adding to the pasta. 3) Sprinkled the eggplants with oregano and chilli flakes before frying 4) Scooped out the roasted garlic and added to the pasta with the veggies. YUMMY!

This was very good but a LOT of work. If I ever make it again I'l use jarred artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers. Also, we ended up needing to stretch it out for some surprise dinner guests. I added tomato sauce, it was good. (still a lot of work though)

I usually find that any recipe with a good rating is sure to be a hit; but not so this time. I have to admit, though, that I didn't use the two cups of oil, so perhaps that would have made all the difference. I don't think that the lack of flavour was due to the lack of oil (because I did as I always do when a recipe says to fry eggplant: I partially grill the eggplant, sprayed lightly with olive oil, before adding it to the dish. I find the results are always delicious and just as good as the oil soak). Olive oil is full of flavour, though, so perhaps it is imperative in a simple dish such as this. I ended up adding sundried tomoto pesto to give some flavour.

I do believe that the ingredients meant to say 1- 1 1/4 pound eggplant. That is the same as a 1.25 pound eggplant

It does appear a little confusing, but you would search forever to find 11 eggplants that weigh only 1/4 pounds. Try using 1 eggplant that weights 1.25 pounds and you will be all set. Though I happen to be 100% Sicilian, I opted to substitute zucchini for the eggplant, which has never agreed with my tastes! It still was quite delicious, and a keeper!

I'm planning on making this recipe but it says "11 1/4 pounds eggplant". How much eggplant do you put in?

My husband and I thought this was delicious. The only change I made was I cut down the oil used to fry the eggplant to 1 cup and didn't add the 2 tablespoons of reserved oil to the finished dish. Next time I think I will add some red pepper flakes for a little kick.

I thought this was a lot of work for an average-tasting dish. I would recommend using roasted red peppers in a jar and frozen/canned artichoke hearts to save a lot of time. But, I likely won't make this again since my husband didn't even finish what what on his plate.

I simplified this down to nothing. Use 1/2 cup yellow onion if you don't have shallots. Heat 3 tbs olive oil and add your chopped red pepper (with peel on), onion, eggplant, garlic. Put in the olive and canned diced artichoke bottoms when the eggplant is soft. Top with Romano.

In response to question about 2 cups olive oil. The reason for 2 cups is to fry the eggplant, you actually only use a small amount directly into the recipe. The eggplant adds a nice flavor to the olive oil, I saved it in the refrigerator and used it in other recipes. This is an excellent dish. I took some short cuts. Use canned artichoke hearts (not marinated) and saute with the garlic. Add some toasted pine nuts also. What a delicious dish, the eggplant was so flavorful.We had an incredible Cote du Rhone wine with it and my husband is still raving about this dish.

Before I attempt this dish, someone please verify: TWO CUPS OF OLIVE OIL?? Isn't that a bit MUCH?

This recipe provides a great way to use eggplant. My family, not all of whom are eggplant lovers, devoured the dish immediately. The pasta was much enjoyed by all, and i will surely be serving it again at my table.

Also delicious with 4-8 minceed anchovies added towards the end. Don't forget the reggiano. Buon apetito!

Delicious. I used half the oil and cooked the garlic. It was a lot of work but well worth it. I'll make it again.
