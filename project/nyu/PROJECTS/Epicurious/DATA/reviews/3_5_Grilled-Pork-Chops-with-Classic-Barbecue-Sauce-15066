Oh dear, I didn't like it. Pork chops were moist and juicy, but the sauce was too sweet and lemony. I would omit the lemon zest, decrease the sugar, up the vinegar and seasonings, etc, but then it would be a different recipe, wouldn't it? I will make again, but with another sauce.

I will confirm what everyone else says - - very good, and very juicy without even brining. The sauce tastes kind of sweet and sour.

Rating: 3
This is a good sauce for chicken because it's on the sweet side.I didn't like the idea of having zest in my sauce, so I didn't use any and used all the lemon juice instead. Next time I would not use as much sugar.

This was really yummy - great sauce recipe. I used a "heavy" 1/4 tsp chili sauce and we thought it was perfect.

This sauce recipe is one of the best I've made by recipe; there is a "tanginess" from the vinegar and lemon that adds that extra bbq flavor, but it's tempered with the brown sugar. Definitely will make again!

I am always trying to find pork chop recipes with some punch and this one won my husband and I over. The sauce had plenty of flavour and it kept the loin chops very moist. Went straight in to my recipe box.

The sauce was very easy to make, and is better tasting than most bottled BBQ, but my husband and I weren't "wowed". We're too hooked on the "Grilled Jerk Pork Chops" recipe from this site, which are also very easy to make, but have much more interesting flavors and "zing" than this did.

This sauce is so good. Tonight I used it on left over steak--a tad more cooked than I wanted in the 1st place. Family lapped up the sandwiches--proof that this sauce is good on ANYTHING! Even over cooked steak!

Wow! 52 reviews & it's 100% approved. Had to try it. Now it's 53 reviews & STILL 100% approved. My goodness! This sauce is so easy & the best I've had! Meets my "sweet & spicy" tastes buds to a "T". I think next time I just might add a drop or two of liquid smoke. To meet my "sweet, spicy & smokey" taste buds. This is so easy. Sooo good! No more store bought for this gal! Ann Willan--you rock!

Excellent BBQ sauce. I doubled the added and extra garlic clove and some soy sauce for a little more intense flavor - will defintely make for all BBQ dishes.

Received rave reviews from my boys and husband. Tasted a bit tart after I made it but once brushed on chops and grilled it was real tasty!!!!! Definitely would make again.....much better than any store bought brand.

Oh! Yes! One wonders in this day & age of cooking how anything so simple could possibly so good. Ann Willan may be from England, but she does know my taste in BBQ sauce. I don't believe I'll ever buy BBQ sauce again. And my pork doubting husband (due to 30 year's ago pork) left part of everything but the boneless pork chop. That was gone!!! So glad I read the reviews. As for "juicing the lemon & adding 1/2 is most likly a European thing.`I used boneless pork just over an inch. And---the George Grill. Cooked grilled for 4 minutes, tested, let go another minute. Will do it for 4 minutes per side next time. Just a tad dry my way. The sauce will be excellent on meatballs, meatloaf, chicken. And she's from England? 1st BBQ recipe I've found that I like since big brother's, and he was from San Antonio!

I made this with Splenda brown sugar and low carb ketchup (as I just had bariatric surgery) and it was delicious. It did smell very vinegar-y while cooking, but the end result was great. I will make the modified version for me again, and the original one for company.

I am not a fan of BBQ sauces but when I saw Anne Willan's signature on this recipe I was compelled to give it a try. As usual she did not disappoint me. A good recipe to have on hand for easy, no nonsense summer grilling.

This was great. So easy and they came out so juicy. I didn't have ketchup so I used BBQ sauce and they were wonderful.

This was a relatively quick homemade barbecue sauce. I used all the ingredients until I got to the Tobasco and Worcestchire sauces and the hot spices. I used an 8 oz. can of diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chilis. It kept the integrity of the sauce without too much "heat". I slow cooked it in a crock pot for 6-8 hours on low. Great for a busy weeknight! Serve with cornbread and beans or a salad and it's really a hearty meal.

An excellent quick dish! This barbecue sauce is incredibly wonderful not only on the chops, but on sandwiches and chicken nuggets. This sauce makes me not want to purchase store bought barbecue sauce ever again. Perhaps next time, I will use a bit of cornstarch to make a thicker sauce.

Rating: 4
This was excellent and easy. I didn't have lemon, so I used orange instead. It was perhaps a little sweeter than with the lemon but still tangy and delicious. Husband and picky-eater son loved it. Can't wait to try variations, with lemon or with more spice, to compare results. Definitely a keeper.

Made this last night with boneless pork chops - it was delish and only took about 15 minutes to make. Would be just as good on chicken - I'll definitely make it again!

Needed a recipe that didn't require marinating, so tried this, hoping the pork chops would come out tender. Needn't have worried. Flavor and texture were great, and it was easy as could be. Going into my summer grilling file.

I made the bbq sauce last night for my dinner tonight. It's delicious and very easy to make. I ended up doubling the amount of curry powder and tobasco because it was a tad bit too sweet. The flavors are wonderful. Going away for the weekend and needed an easy recipe that required easy transporting and very little preparing and this is it. I can't wait to eat the chops!

I made a double batch after reading the reviews, and doubled the garlic again. Excellent!

I added some honey to the onions while they were browning then put in a tbs of bourbon after that. I also added some Pick-a-pepper sauce (it might just be a southern thing) with the Worchestershire because I didnt have any Tabasco, then doubled up on the chili powder. The sauce turned out thick, rich and was a huge hit. Fantastic!

Made the sauce and served it over beef ribs. Used banana ketchup instead of tomato ketchup. Awesome.

This is a delicious and "low effort" recipe for BBQ sauce. I love the fact that it uses simple ingredients like ketchup and brown sugar. The only labor intensive part is slicing the onions and garlic. The lemon zest makes it special! I'll plan to prepare it again for grilling chicken, pork chops, and other meats.

To Cook from Boston-You only add half the lemon juice. I agree that the recipe should be a bit more precise. Other than that, it sounds wonderful and I plan on making it this week.

Te barbecue sauce was very good and very simple. Idoubled the spicy ingredients because we prefer spicy over sweet. We used the sauce on babyback ribs and it was great. A keeper.

Am I losing my mind? The instructions say "Add the lemon zest, HALF THE LEMON JUICE, the sugar.....etc." When do you add the OTHER HALF of the lemon juice, or do you? If you don't, the ingredients should have said "juice of half a lemon." Can someone help me out here? Thanks.

First of all, I rarely give 4 forks, but I thought this one deserved it. I grew up in NC with very vinegary based BBQ sauces...and I still like them even though I've never been a big fan of a lot of vinegar. The sauces in NC lend themselves to the great flavor of roasted pork at 'pig pickins'. However, this was a really wonderful sauce; easy to make and the lemon juice and zest really made it. We used boneless pork chops and it was fantastic. A real 'keeper' that I will most definately make throughout the summer grilling season...and beyond!!

This was better than I thought it would be. I tasted the sauce after cooking and thought it was too vinergary for my taste, some people like it that way I don't. But after it cooled and I put it on the pork chops it was really good. When I am out of bbq sauce this will be the sauce I make.

I was in search of a homemade BBQ sauce and used this sauce on barbecued chicken. (I'll have to try the pork next.) I made it a day ahead of time and then re-heated it. It smelled a bit vinegar-y while cooking but don't let that fool you. The sauce was wonderful and a complete success.

I forgot to buy BBQ sauce at the store so I checked this site for an easy sauce as I was grilling ribs. This was very easy and tasty. My husband who is extremely picky devoured the ribs. I did add extra tobasco for some kick and I liked the sweet/hot combo. For not much effort, this was very good and much better than packaged BBQ sauce. I would definately try this on chicken and pork chops, too!

I was actually looking for a recipe for barbecue sauce and found this one. My friends were surprised that it was NOT from a bottle. This recipe is fantastic. I would double or even triple it for larger amounts of meat. It makes only about 1 cup as printed.

Best barbecue sauce recipe I've ever made! I use 2 pounds of boneless pork ribs and slow cook on low for 5 to 6 hours. Just throw all of the ingredients in (no need to saute onions, etc). I also substituted 3 Tbs lemon juice instead of the the whole lemon and seasoned the ribs well with salt and pepper before cooking. Amazing flavor.

Wow! My family LOVED this one! There was quiet around the dinner table while they ate and there was NOTHING left! I doubled the BBQ sauce to have a bit more for dipping if necessary. The pork chops came out juicy and tender. A definite keeper!

I used the BBQ sauce with baby back ribs and it was wonderful. I did add more garlic and chili flakes and used cider vinegar which gave it a nice zip. My boyfriend loved the sauce's tanginess. I will be making this again to use with chicken and pork chops. Thank you for another great recipe and thank you to the cooks who review the recipes; you really are such a help in deciding what to prepare and any adjustments needed.
