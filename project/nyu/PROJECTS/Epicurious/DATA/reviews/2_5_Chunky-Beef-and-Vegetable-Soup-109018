This is a basic beef and vegetable soup - There is nothing Filipino (sp?) about it. I wonder why it was put with this section of Mother's day recipes? I would not make it again as my regular recipe has more flavour.

I have not laughed so hard in years. I am saving this in my recipe box for the reviews and any time I need a good laugh I'll go there. The soup is good also!

I agree with Germany that this is an awful recipe. But I don't understand why you keep making it! There are other recipes out there. In the world of Beef and Veggie soup recipes of which there are so many, this is just not complex enough nor tasty enough to justify the work. If it tastes worse than canned soup, I won't make it again and this one tastes far worse.

My family and I think this soup is delicious, something we'll have again and again. We made no changes to the recipe.

This is the worst soup that I have ever tasted. I cut down the soaking time on the beans to 30 minutes, and they came out crunchy (which we like)and I substituted the tomatoes with brussel sprouts. I even punched my chest to make the herbs taste better, but that did not work. We eat this daily and are considering a new recipe.
