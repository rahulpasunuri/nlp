Really good recipe. Used thyme as I didn't have sage. Will definitely make again

Love this. Made it twice - once with goat cheese and once with Alouette with Fines Herb instead of the goat cheese. It was addictive with the Alouette -- people were praising my mashed potatoes months later. Making it to bring for Christmas dinner at a friend's and will try with the sautéed sage this time. LOVE this recipe.

I love this recipe. I just mince the sage very finely and use only the tender part of the leaves avoiding the stem. I also switch the milk for cream. These go fast; be sure to make enough!

Good stuff. Like other reviewers, I sauteed the sage. Make sure you salt this to taste.

I've made this a few times now, and also added the sage to the boiling water for the potatoes. I also sauteed the sage like another reader suggested and added it to the mashed potatoes and that worked out great. I used 1-1/2 times the goat cheese for enhanced flavour and it was delicious.

i substitute heavy whipping cream for the milk for extra taste. i agree with others to saute the sage for a little extra taste. also works well with thyme and rosemary depending on the dish you are making it with.

Tasty, easy recipe that you can tweak to your own taste. It's clear from the prior 25 reviews that everyone has their own ideas about whether there should be less butter, more butter, more cheese, more liquids, less liquids, more sage, other spices, etc. That's fine - mashed potatoes is one of those staples that we have personal preferences about! Here was my tweak: I threw sage sprigs in the boiling water as well as soaking sage leaves in the milk, and the taste of the potatoes was great. Just be sure you add plenty of salt and pepper to the potatoes as you mash them; this brings out the sage and goat cheese flavors.

After spending much money on organic yukon golds and goat cheese, I was disappointed with the outcome. The dish was just too heavy (tons of fat & calories), but not much flavor, even with extra sage & salt & pepper.

Creamy and wonderful - the perfect side dish!

This was delicious. Remember to season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper before serving, and they will have plenty of flavor. Three and a half forks!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Not much flavor--expected more.

We made this several times this past fall and winter as we enjoy the flavor profile. Two comments 1.) First steeping sage in the milk for a period of time pronounces the flavor. Or you may add sage to the boiling water. 2.) For added aesthetic appeal, I suggest adding red and blue sage flowers as a garnish just prior serving. (The edible flowers are from pineapple and blue anise sage, respectively.) Enjoy

A favorite for cheese-lovers. I needed to add a significant amount of extra milk to make them moist.

The combination of Yukon Gold potatoes and goat cheese is great on its own. The addition of fresh sage makes it even better. I sauteed the chopped sage for a couple minutes to bring out the flavor.

Made ahead of time. Added some cream so taters wouldn't dry out in reheat. Reheated slowly. Very nice.

Makes good leftovers! I substituted olive oil for butter. I was going to make 1/2 with olive oil, the other half with butter, but the olive oil half was so good I made the other half the same way! Needed a little more milk, though. Also omitted sage and used dried thyme instead.

This recipe was very good. I thought the goat cheese added a rich flavor and it was different from the usual mashed potatoes. The only reason I gave it 3 forks was because my family didn't like it as much as other mashed potato recipes I have made.

My family and I loved this dish. I'll be making it for Christmas dinner to serve with beef tenderloin. Easy and elegant.

Did anyone make this ahead of time? It says it can be made up to 2 hours ahead but I would like to make it the day before serving. Any suggestions?

This was good -- however, we incorporated additional milk and butter to moisten the potatoes. Next time we will also saute the sage before adding it.

This just didn't do it for me, even though I like all the ingredients separately...

I had to add more butter and milk to achieve the proper consistency. Wonderful flavor.

Easy and delicious! I added more goat cheese, butter and milk than the recipe called for and the potatoes were a big hit. I'll definitely make these again.

Very tasty and easy to make. However, I suggest that you wait and put the butter in at the end, that way it doesn't seperate into its three components (milk solid, fat and water) but rather makes the potatoes velvety and rich.

totally easy, and great for entertaining. made ahead and reheated. very subtle refined taste.

I made this for my Fathers Birthday dinner and everyone raved about it, even the purists who just like butter and milk. No leftovers that night. I doubled the recipe no problem.
