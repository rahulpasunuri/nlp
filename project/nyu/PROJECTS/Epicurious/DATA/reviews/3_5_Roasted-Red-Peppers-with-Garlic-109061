These peppers were really something on day two. On day one they fell a little flat, especially as compared to the roasted onions with Cabrales from the same issue. But as the flavors developed they got better. Tasty as a condiment!

This was a big hit at a Spanish dinner party.

I liked this recipe. I made a 1/4 size recipe (2 large red peppers) since it was the first time making it. I also didn't have sherry vinegar (thinking it said sherry only) so I used balsamic vinegar instead. It was kind of sweet but a few of my guests really liked the taste. I think I would try red wine vinegar next time.

I wasnt a big fan of this recipe. Peppers were a little to slimey I prefer to just roast them under the broiler (until very charred and tender) cool, remove skins then add some roasted garlic and allow to sit in the frige overnight till the flavours meld.

I made this recipe for New Year's Day. Found flavor superior to those slimy ones that come from a jar. However, the peppers lost stability as they wept in the oven, and were not as firm as the ones from a jar. Not sure how to solve this. Delicious anyway though and a great accompaniment to a platter.

Very good. The serving size is a bit out of whack. Made half the recipe (6 peppers) for 12. We had lots of other food. 1 and 1/2 peppers per person seems a bit much.

meh, didn't find it all that special.

Tried this dish out for a Tapas party. I was a little worried as the roasted peppers appeared very roasted indeed even before I cooked them in the vinigar syrup. However, they were outstanding as a tapas and folks went wild over them. Even the teenagers were sneaking into to grab this pepper dish. Will definitely make again.

These roasted red peppers were yummy. I served them as tapas with the onions in the same article. The onions and peppers on a platter, with some cheese and olives, served with a steak and a nice Malbec, made for a delicious and unique meal.

This dish was really wonderful. The first time I roasted and peeled the peppers three days ahead and stored them in their juice in the refriderateor. I cooked it a few hours before serving and let it cool to room temperature. I was delicious and gone, very quickly. I am just roasting some more peppers as I write for a special birthday celebration dinner tomorrow afternoon. Four of the 8 diners are celebrating their birthdays,including a 70th and 75th. I included this dish because everything has to be special and delicious!

I have made roasted red peppers on the grill many times, and then drizzled the oil and vinegar after they were peeled. Always a favorite at our barbeques ! Next time, I will give this recipe a try !
