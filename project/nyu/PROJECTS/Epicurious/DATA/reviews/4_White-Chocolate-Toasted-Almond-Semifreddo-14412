I sauteed the almonds in butter and a teaspoon of sugar until the sugar carmelized. Then spread on aluminum foil and sea salted the whole thing (based on another review here) I also use 40% butterfat heavy cream from the restaurant supply house (GFS) My friends describe the taste as a frozen mousse rather than an ice cream. They claim creamiest thing they ever ate, but not quite ice cream. HUGE success.

A wonderfully light and luscious dessert. Served it solo and people were delighted.

This certainly doesn't need the Lemon Rhubarb Cake Roll. Sliced with some fresh raspberries on top, it makes a delicious, elegant, and rather easy dessert. Definitely try this one!

Simple to prepare, and really luscious! Slightly salted almonds contrast with the silky sweetness of the white chocolate. I served this with a scoop of chocolate sorbet and a cava granita as part of a Spanish themed meal, and everyone raved.

I've made this several times, and it's always a major hit. The recipe is an absolute winner!!

I first destroyed my issue of Gourmet and then the pages with this recipe and the Rhubarb Lemon Roll Cake in my Gourmet hardcover cookbook from over-use from making this recipe over and over and over again. It is always such a hit at dinner parties and with my family - they beg me to make this with the accompanying Rhubarb Lemon Cake Roll - and I love both desserts too. I would and will make this recipe again.

This recipe is outstanding, I served it with homemade peach cobbler and a blueberry sauce. Perfect on a summer day.

This recipe was wonderful. The toasted almonds added both depth and texture to the semifreddo, and the taste of white chocolate was sublime. I will definitely make this again.

I had made this recipe years ago when it was first published, and I was glad to find it again on Epicurious.com. This is terribly rich, but the taste is wonderful. Chocolate sauce would kill the great almond taste, in my opinion.

A very wonderful dessert by itself! Definately give it a try if you like almond flavor.

Very good recipe and delicate taste. I also put some chopped hazelnuts. Serve with tortes is ideal. By itself i served it with a dark chocolate sauce. I defenately wold make it again.
