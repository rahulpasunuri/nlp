I prepared this recipe for a party I threw this past weekend and they were the favoured of the hors d'oeuvres. Admittedly, they were a little bland in flavour. I used a little more saffron in the preparation that was cooked for. Excellent overall however.

I used the cups from this recipe and filled them with apricot rosemary chutney (also on this site).I placed the brie on the chutney and topped with a toasted almond sliver then baked. They were fantastic.

To make this recipe much easier, buy frozen phyllo barques (boats) and fill according to the recipe. Preparation time is about 30 minutes and the results are the same.

Not outrageously good like many recipes here. But good enough. Don't buy the phyllo cups prebaked.

I have made these about 4 times now and you really have enjoy that dull taste of saffron to enjoy these. While it's a nice easy dish, I think I will move onto better dishes to make that have some flavor more appealing.

I made these tartlets for a New Year's Eve crowd, who look forward to my cooking surprises. SURPRISE! These were heavy, and dull tasting, as well as time consuming. After some thought we were able to jazz them up by topping with a dash of hot sauce!
