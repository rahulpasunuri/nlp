This was a delicious way to use a surplus of apricots, cherries, and some white wine that was past its prime. Rather than zesting the orange, i cut off the peel in wide slices and added it to the liquid, and then removed it before serving. After cooking the apricots and cherries for 5 minutes, I removed them with a slotted spoon and cooked down the remaining liquid until it formed a thick syrup. I served the compote with a dollop of crème fraîche, and it was a perfect end to a summer meal.

This is a wonderful way to use extra cherries and apricots from our CSA box. The compote was great on ice cream but it was also really good stirred into some greek yogurt. I'm going to try adding star anise today - that sounds yummy!

Not sure why this recipe comes up under "sugar free desserts" when there is 1 1/4 cup sugar in it?

Awesome!!! I used the frozen peaches and frozen bing cherries and threw in some fresh apricots, mango, lemon and orange peel. I also put in 3-4 stare anise. This is great with the cake but can be a fruit topper for just about anything.

This was a very tasty fruit sauce. I enjoyed it with homemade vanilla icecream and a nice slice of pound cake.
