Pretty bland if you ask me. I ended up adding salt, allspice and cayenne pepper, but it was still pretty bland. Pretty much a bland potato leek soup with a slight chestnut flavor. I love chestnuts, and I was disappointed. Too much cream too. Only add about 1/2 cup at the most.

Full Disclosure: I added an extra potato (left them all unpeeled), 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of cayenne,and used olive oil instead of butter. I pureed with my immersion blender. That said, the soup was delicious and easy. Comfort food. I'll definitely make it again.
