I agree it was too bland but many of my co-workers loved it. It needs a little zip!

I agree with reviews that say this was a bit bland. I like the idea and this is a good starting point Lemon juice and more garlic help.

I love ratatouille, but for added depth when using these flavors as a dip, I use finely chopped sundried tomatoes. It makes a big difference to the final product!

A nice array of flavors. Nothing special, though. I added a little more garlic and that seemed to liven it up.

Bland - I also did not like the texture of the dip.

I made this dish for a coktail party, on a friday night. The dish was a great make ahead. Everyone loved it.
