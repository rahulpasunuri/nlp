I was really disappointed with this. It's called a tart but it's actually an almond cake. And the flavours are bland even with the natillas and cream. Not at all the almond 'tart' my husband and I had hoped for!

Easy, and really tasty, you can use as a dessert in a formal menu or just as a coffe cake to have at breakfast. The trick is not to overbake it, or it will become dry!!!

I've made this twice now and both times it was a big hit- and it's so easy. I haven't tried the cream, but served it dressed with strawberries and dusted with icing sugar. I also skipped the blender (too much washing up!)and used bought ground almonds and mixed it by hand.

Made this recipe when a friend came over and everyone thought it was wonderful! From one Boston cook to another, that wonderful magical fluid you've been searching for is pure water. Eight fluid ounces of distilled water also weighs eight ounces. I hope you had another quest lined up or I'll feel bad. :-)

i'm not much of a baker. that being said, the tart turned out nicely (hint: be very quiet when removing it from the oven, otherwise the little bit of rising will faal). it was tasty (with a corn muffin texture), however the disaster was with the natillas (the suggested garnish). luckily, the dessert sans cream was great.

I made this for my cooking club and everyone loved it, especially the natillas. I would be interested to experiment with the natillas to try and use different flavors, e.g. citrus, etc. The cinnamon didn't come through too much in mine, but could have been a little aged.

To the cook from Iowa--liquid ounces and weight ounces are not the same thing. Sounds like you thought 1/2 pound = 8 ounces which therefore = 1 cup. Nope, sorry. Wouldn't it be magical if 1/2 pound of anything, be it solid gold or feathers, was always a cup?

I was perusing the test notes for this recipe and noted that 1/2 lb of almonds is equal to 1 2/3 cups. Whats up with that? Thinking that 1/2 lb was 8 oz. that is exactly what I used in the cake now cooling on my counter. Oh, brother! As recipe clarity is important to me I only gave this one star but I will make it again just to do it right.

I made this cake for a luncheon at work and everyone asked for the recipe. The natillas is fabulous.

It turned out great but it cost me my blender. I should have used the food processor instead of the blender to grind the nuts. Will definitely do it again.

I made this as a dessert for a tapas party. I liked the cake, really liked the natillas. My daughter called the natillas "rice pudding sauce" which made sense when I thought about it. It's cinnamon and vanilla flavored heavy cream thickened with a few eggs. Sounds like rice pudding without the rice. I was a bit concerned about how to tell when the cream thickened, but I just kept cooking for while and it become obvious. The 30 minutes is a bit of time to stir [nearly] continuously.

Fantastic recipe! I put the tarts in 9 inch removable bottom pan ( Butter well!) and they were stunning placed on the Natillas. I also added a swirl of raspberry coulis and a few raspberries for garnish. Fantastic!

Duh -- I figured a pint (2 cups) is a pound, so I used 1 cup of almonds in this recipe. I should have clicked when the batter was too liquid to be "scraped" out of the processor. Result was overflowing mess in the oven about half way through the baking time. What remained in the pie dish was okay to eat, albeit not very cakelike, and slightly bland to the taste. The creme anglaise was all that saved it.

Wow.. Everyone raved about this. Seconds were fought over. A suggestion from one of my guests, maybe a little fruit on top for appearance.

I served this at a dinner party for about 18 people including a friend from Basque region in Spain. Everyone loved it and commented on it again and again. The Basque friend said it was as close to the original as you can get (and he had three pieces!). It was extremely easy to make (the sweet cream took some time, but was not difficult, either). I would definitely make it again.

i don't know wether my attempt at this recipe was succesfful or not. the final product was a tasty muffin-like cake rather than the pastry i was expecting. this could be because of my poor baking skills, but it would've been nice to see a photo or a verbal description of the finished tart to compar.
