This was awesome!!! Didn't have beef stock or cranberry sauce so used more chicken and beef consume and used strawberry jam instead. The layers of favor and simplicity were amazing.

Yum yum yum! The sauce is delectable. I didn't find any medallions so fried 2 steaks instead. Bloody, juicy, tender and delicious. I served it with a buttery jacket potato. Do try this at home!

Believe the hype! This is delicious. Made it w/ cranberry sauce made from fresh cranberries, a little water and a little sugar (1/3 c. cran, 2T sugar, 2 T water, as mentioned by previous reviewer).

I will join the chorus of positive reviews about this recipe. I followed the recipe except made my own cranberry sauce from whole cranberries kept in the freezer when such occasions arise. It is easy to make whole cranberry sauce by using 1/3 cup cranberries, 2 tblspns sugar and 2 tblspns water and cook it for 15 minutes. When I cut up the backstrap into medallions I needed 8 for the 4 people being served. I did not get all 8 medallions exactly 3/4". The 3/4" thickness cooked medium-rare perfectly at 2 minutes per side in my hot grill pan with the butter past the frothy stage while the 1/2" were more medium to medium-well. Medium-rare is the best way to enjoy this cut of venison. All loved the results and gave two thumbs up. I enjoyed this much better than my brother's fave way of wrapping the whole backstrap in bacon and oven-roasting.

Excellent recipe. I made sure to cook the medallions no more than medium rare. The sauce was the perfect compliment to the venison. The only change I made was to add a beurre manie at the end to thicken up the sauce a little. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the best venison recipe I have ever tried. One enhancement: cut the medallions 1/2 inch thick and then pound JUST A BIT. Increases tenderness. And for the love of God do NOT overcook the venison.

I am married to a hunter, so each year I try some new venison recipes, but I always come back to this one combined with another one from this site (pan seared venison with rosemary and dried cherries), I use the port/cherry sauce with the meat marinated in the rosemary/garlic rub. I use the port sauce, but add cherries and a little jelly instead of the cranberry sauce, unless I have cranberry sauce available) I always have cherries for this recipe on hand. I usually make a full recipe of the port/cherry sauce, so 1/2 recipe of meat.

I call this recipe the "convert maker" for game skeptics. It is simple to make with intense flavors and aromas. Works well with pork or tenderloin, but loses that "wow" factor for newcomers to venison experience when they realize that they ate Bambi and LOVED it!

Yummy!!! My best friend & I made this for our husbands. We used beef tenderloin instead of the venison and it was incredible. Served it with Buttered Cabbage & Champ from this site. Quite a meal :~)

So simple and tasty. May try adding a bit of cinnamon and/or cloves to sauce next time, or perhaps some ancho chilis for a bit more depth. For the minimal effort it takes, it's a great dish.

Used this recipe as a basis for an elk stew, as I only had cubes, and not steaks for searing. Simmerd it all in a crockpot and finished the sauce with some congnac cherry preserves. This was awesome!

I've made this 3 times for guests - people who do not eat venison regularly like we do - and everyone has raved about it. We use our own venison so it's that much more awesome!

Amazing recipe! Made this for our non-traditional Thanksgiving dinner, though since I couldn't find venison, I used filet

Rating: 4
Given its simplicity, I was a little skeptical at how the sauce would turn out, but The Man & I followed the recipe to the letter. As he pointed out, the sauce tasted very "European" and the completed dish was incredible. Paired with garlic mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus and a Belgium ale, this is definitely a knock-your-socks-off meal.

I served this for a Junior League dinner and got rave reviews. I used a full venison tenderloin that I pan seared before roasting in the oven. I then cut the roast into fillets and layered sauce, fillet, brie, sauce, fillet, brie & sauce again - then placed in a warm oven for a few moments to melt the brie. Beautiful presentation & so delicious one of the girls hired to me cater her daughters rehearsal dinner!

Exquisite - the best venison recipe I have ever tasted. I shoot 2+ deer a year and this recipe is my favorite by far. FYI - the better the port the better the dish, so bust out the vintage port for this fine dish.

Rating: 4
This is a great sauce and has made multiple appearances at our house, and we'll be doing it again this Christmas. Uniformly gets raves - simple, rich, and delicious. A few recipe notes - since it's so rich, works well with other hearty meats like duck, beef tenderloin. The recipe is easily doubled (you will want more). I've occasionally thrown in a little fresh squeezed oj or fresh chopped thyme, and I generally substitute lingonberry jam (with berries) for the canned cranberries.

Rating: 4
Absolutely the best venison recipe I've ever had! Hubby normally doesn't like any combination of fruit and meat, but he raved! I thought it was perfect as is except with a small dash of onion powder--my reduction turned out just right in a little less time (my electric stove vs. gas maybe?). I had a large tenderloin and cut the slices 1/2 inch thick. This gave the perfect rare/medium rare, which is key, along with using plenty of butter in the pan and reducing the heat with the second batch of filets. Fabulous!

I made this last night with elk meat. It was delicious. The cranberry sauce was easy to make and very tasty. Two of us licked the pot clean. I did use an elk rub seasoning of equal parts of white pepper, salt, dry mustard, basil, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to sprinkle on the elk and season the sauce (in place of salt and pepper). We are planning on making this again for our Gourmet Club.

Rating: 4
Wow! The medallions reminded me of filet mignon. This recipe has you sear the medallions for a few minutes on each side, and it was just perfect. Still pink/red in the middle and very tender. The sauce was delicious and smelled very good while cooking down. I added more cranberry sauce than asked for (others' suggestions to throw in a handful of fresh cranberries would have been even better). I also added just a splash of balsamic vinegar to give the sauce a little "zing". This was very, very good -- better than you'd get in a restaurant! Can't wait to make it for company. So easy and just delicious.

Every time I serve this dish people are blown away. The sauce is extremely easy to make and it tastes wonderful. I prefer to sustitute truffle butter when finishing the sauce. The venison works well over white rice with sugar snap peas.

I grew up eating venison, never did like it. So when a neighbor gave us some venison, I decided to try this recipe. Made it exactly as written, and can't wait to fix it again tonight! One of the best meals I've ever had! Served it with roasted baby potatoes and red cabbage braised and sprinkled with pepper and balsamic vinegar..Yum!

Rating: 4
My favourite Venison recipe. I always use low salt stock as it can be too salty otherwise, and a handful of fresh cranberries really adds an extra freshness sauce (just add in time to heat through). Very very good.

Rating: 4
I makes this dish all times of the year. The sauce freezes, so in a pinch, I defrost for a gourmet tasting meal. Pork or beef tenderloins are great substitutes for the venison too...although the new zealand venison melts in your mouth! This recipe is a keeper according to the many guests that have enjoyed it my home.

This is my favourite venison recipe - it's delicious and ridiculously easy! I've made it with elk as well. I've also substituted black currant jam for the cranberry sauce. I serve with garlic mashed potatoes, snap peas sauteed with shallots and a strong red wine like Rioja or Shiraz. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4
WOW! This was fantastic. Served it over pork, as the elk wasn't defrosted, but it was one of the best sauces I've ever had. The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe, and that didn't work out as well-definitely needed a lot more time to reduce.

Rating: 4
This is GREAT! My husband is an avid hunter and we eat a lot of game. This is delicious and so easy and quick. Even though I used a whole tenderloin to make this, my son complained there wasn't enough because it was so good he wanted more! A big switch from many recipes that want you to cook venison until it is tough and dry. I know I will make this again and again and again....

Rating: 3
The sauce is incredible -- a perfect complement to the venison. I added a bit of fresh rosemary, great for the color and the flavor. The real trick here is to cook the venison in the rare to medium-rare range. The difference between a perfectly cooked piece of venison and a slightly tough piece is about 30 seconds. But this is a great, easy recipe -- you can made in in about 40 minutes.

Rating: 3
A great recipe. I made it with antelope chops, which were very gamey , but the sauce was fantastic. Will try it with some elk next....

HUNTING CAMP OWNER Cut frosted loin three eights inch diagonal strips aproximately two by two by five inch strips. Tenderized fifteen minutes and steamed fifteen minutes. Improved tender venison result most evident. Added a few chopped fresh chives for visual appeal. Otherwise we would change nothing. Our guests were very pleased with this presentation.

Someone gave me some fresh venison, and I used this recipe. The combination of port with the broth and the gaminess of the venison was fabulous! I improvised and used carmelized onions instead of the cranberries. Very easy to make but so gourmet-tasting. I'd definitely make this again.

Rating: 2
We only had venison steaks, and the meat was a bit tough (as venison often is), so next time I'll look for thinner cuts of meat. The sauce was very good, though, and I'd make it again. I like the one cook's idea for a meat pie, maybe I'll try that as well!

Rating: 4
Having never eaten venison before, this dish was magnificent. The meat was very tender (reminded me of lamb). This is an easy recipe to prepare, the trick is definently searing the meat on a hot skillet. The port and cranberries made the dish!

WE really loved this dish. I used Elk medallions. The sauce was scrumptious. Will definitely make this one again. I think it would work with Pork Tenderloin when Venison is unavailable.

I love the recipe but I decided to change it alittle, I served it as a sauce for a venison roast instead of medallions. Everyone raved, but I found an even better use for the sauce. I brown a pound of ground venison and mix it with the sauce and bake it into a pie. It is wonderful use of the ground and the pie is a hit every year!

I didn't have any venison so I used 1 1/2" thick beef tenderlions. Also used alittle extra cranberrys. Turned out great, my wife loved it. Can't wait to try it with Antilope.

Excellent! I served this with a side of creative mash potatoes. My wife actually went back to the kitchen, after dinner, to dip the potatoes and bread into the sauce! I win again!

I have made this recipe several times and never get tired of it! My husband hunts so I'm constantly looking for venison recipes that appeal to my tastebuds - as I'm not the one who grew up with venison on the table. This is the only recipe I have found that actually allows me to ENJOY venison! I highly recommend it and it's SO EASY!!

Best venison I have made! Great recipe, really pretty easy too. I had smoking chips on the bbq, used for some artichokes, and decided to grill the chops and it was perfect. Make sure you serve rare to really enjoy this one. I have also made it panfried and was good. Less calories on the grill!

We had bought farm-raised venison at a greenmarket, and also had blackberries, and wanted to do a fruit sauce for the venison -- so we substituted the blackberries for the cranberry sauce, and pureed them with the broth and port (after reducing the broth and adding the blackberries with the port for the further reduction step), we also added honey as suggested by someone using whole cranberries -- the sauce came out great! We're going to try it with cranberries next time! (By the way -- served with roasted root vegetables (parsnips, carrots, sweet onions, celeriac, turnips), and they were great together)

I'm not a huge fan of venison, but the recipe souded very interesting and easy. I substituted pork medallions instead with excellent results. It is worth trying just for the sauce.

i am not a gravy fan and i loved this so much i can't wait to make it again! i had carmalized shallot butter that i sauteed the venison loins in then deglazed the pan with sherry (i had no port) and added the stock and cranberry sauce to reduce. the stock was organic vegetable (again, i did not have exactly what the recipe called for) and i had homemade cranberry sauce made using the williams-sonoma recipe from thanksgiving 1995 which contains orange, apple, cinnamon and clove. all the flavors combined to create a perfect combination of tart, savory and sweet. a perfect balance- and spooning any remaining sauce over fresh spaetzle was fabulous!

Wonderful, very easy and impressive to all. We have made this for the last three Christmas Eve's. It also goes well with pork tenderloin and fillet. Next is fresh fish. We usually serve Knorr's mushroom pasta and green beans with bacon as sides. Very yummy!

What a GREAT sauce, can be used on lots of meat dishes! Probably great with filet mignon. We were given venison tenderloins and with some trepidation, I seasoned with s/p and gently pan fried. Added lots of fresh ground pepper and some marsala to the sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes. WONDERFUL!!!

I thought this was great and really easy to make. I would make it a regular except finding venison in San Diego is next to impossible.

WOW!! - this recipe was wonderful! We did a few minor variations. We marinated the venison overnight in salt, pepper, garlic, and the port wine. Then the medallions were wrapped in bacon before they were cooked. Adding the wonderful flavor of the sauce to the venison just made for a delightful dinner. I would highly reccommend this recipe to anyone wanting to try venison. Happy cooking!!

This dish was incredibly easy to prepare, and absolutely delicious. Make double the sauce quantity, as it reduced much faster than the recipe indicates. Very impressive for guests, and great with a red cabbage accompaniment.

The key to making this recipe superb is to begin with very lean venison medallions. The rest is a simple exercise in culinary skill. This dish was the easiest, most remarkable guest pleaser! The cranberry port sauce ranks with the best French sauce, I've ever tasted!!! C'est magnifique!

This recipe is now a staple of mine. However, for better flavor I recommend deglazing the pan used to cook the venison with reduced stock before wisking in cranberries and butter.

This recipe is excellent. I made it twice, once with venison and once with tenderloin, both got rave reviews. I used fresh cranberries and sweetened it just a little with honey instead of the canned cranberry sauce and served it with spaetzle. Very similar to a dish I had in Germany.

I guess this is more a review of the sauce....I too reduced it beyond the recommended amount (by accident, I must confess), to about 1/3 cup--with the cranberry sauce and butter added in it was very intense and delicious. The venison was great but just a vehicle, IMHO--pork, beef, salmon, any of those would be great with this sauce.

This was my first time preparing venison. This recipe was very good. I would make it again. The sauce was outstanding. As suggested I increased the reduction time. I will make the sauce many times over. It would be wonderful on salmon.

We served the sauce on Salmon that was pan seared and it was fab. Tomorrow we will try on halibut since we do not eat meat. It was wonderful if reduced longer, add 15 more minutes.

I enjoyed the simplicity of the recipie. When I discovered I was out of venison , I decided to use lean pork loin chops. It turned out wonderful. My boyfriend suggested I add it to his list of favorite foods. I couldn't ask for a better review. I do agree with another reviewer it needs to reduce longer than suggested.

The flavor was very good, however, we found the meat to be very tough to chew. For the first time tasting wild meat this recipe was pretty good, I was told the meat would have a strong taste and it did not.

Very easy to make and the perfect accompaniment to venison. We have since used the same sauce on beef tenderloin and enjoyed it as well. Reduce sauce longer than stated to bring to a thicker consistency or it can be a bit runny. Enjoy!

This is an excellent prepartion for venision, when it's available. The sauce is the star of the recipe--it would be equally delicious served on pork tenderloin if you can't find good quality venison.
