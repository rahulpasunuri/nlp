They tasted alright, but they don't look appealing. Although this recipe is incredibly easy there are better, more aesthetically appealing recipes available that I would prefer.

This recipe tasted good, but I don't think I would rush to make it again. The finished product was just plain ugly with a porous, gray, sugar-egg mixture coating the nuts...guests were hesitant to even taste them, although once they did, it was okay. The flavor just did not fully make up for the lack of visual appeal for me.

This recipe was easy to follow and did taste great, but the appearance of the nuts was not as i would have hoped. They are fine to mix into a salad, but I would not put them out in a dish for company. Also , they are not traditional in that they are very light and crisp, rather than dense and crunchy. Overall, tasty, but not what I was hoping for.

The basis of this recipe is good but it makes way too much for only 2 cups of nuts. I generally double or triple the amount of nuts I'm using (depending on whether I'm using halves or wholes).

These were great! Crispy and not too sweet. I sprayed pan with pam and loosened with spatula when they came out of oven then dried on cooling rack. Making for teacher's gifts this year. Perfect.

After reading over the many reviews, I decided to combine recipe variations and came up with this: 1 egg white beaten, 1/4 c. granulated sugar, 1/4 c. packed dark brown sugar, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t cloves, and 1/4 t cayenne pepper. What flavor! I plan to try 3/4 t cinnamon and 1/4 t cloves without the cayenne so that my girls will eat them.

i make these with walnuts or pecans for salads. I find that you can add a lot more nuts to the mixture, 4 to 8 cups total. I don't like them overly candied. then i put them in an airtight container and sprinkle on salads. Yummy.

12/24/2008 - easy and good. I halved the recipe and it was too much for half the salad recipe that it goes with.

Wasn't going for the shinyness others were. I used slightly more pecans. !/4 c each brown + granulated sugar, a dash of cinn + nutmeg. parchment paper didn't grease. didn't bother to separate each nut. came out fantastic!!! crumbled or whole on salad, crepes, ice cream, yogurt, granola... can't go wrong just eat 'em solo!

Very easy (other than having to pick each piece apart to put on the baking sheet) and *so* good. Not fancy but I would eat the whole bowl if I let myself. I used parchment paper instead of butter and they came right off.

After I spent many hours on a super fancy dessert, these were what everyone stood in the kitchen and snacked on until they were gone. Important to let cool so they can dry out. As one reviewer said, they are not shiny so don't expect that.

These didn't do it for me. I think that the baking time is too long. The nuts did not retain their texture; they had no crunch or bite to them. I also tried Sugar-And-Spice Candied Nuts and LOVED them.

This came in really handy at Christmas and even now in April for my Mom's birthday! So easy and very good! Just buy a tin to put them in as a gift.

There are many better recipes for candied nuts. These tasted so-so and were homely (dull; not shiny).

I was expecting lovely shiny pecans as I had made some candied chili almonds earlier. These turned out to be dull brown. I served them to my guests with champagne as they arrived, and it was a nice touch but I definitely won't be making these again.

Wonderful if a little care is taken not to overbeat egg whites. They must not lose their coating ability. Beat just till foamy, not fluffy and meringue-like. The difference will be a substance that adheres and stays on or one that is too light and turns loose once baked. Also the oil content will be different in different species of pecans. The oilier ones will not scorch as quickly as the less oily ones. If uncertain as to which you have, the heavier the nutmeat for its size, the oilier it is. If it seems to almost have no weight for its size it is less oily (also less flavorful).

I found the nuts to be excellent to eat by themselves or added onto ice cream. My guests loved them! Easy to make, followed the recipe exactly, but you do need to grease the baking sheet VERY well.

A good recipe but not enough cinnamon

I had some pecans and the rest of the ingredients available.Despite other "iffy" reviews,I thought they sounded good.Came out great,no problem.Everyone loved them.

Made these exactly per the recipe for my Xmas buffet. Everyone loved them. They got the ultimate compliment from my guests - no leftovers save for a few crumbs in the bottom of the bowl.

Boy did I have to modify this recipe! I used pecans and walnuts, used a whole egg instead of whites (which avoided the fluffy meringue disaster), and used honey along with the sugar. Mix the egg, sugar, about 1/2 cup honey, then add spices like nutmeg, allspice, clove, cinnamon, and a bit of cayenne for kick. Throw in the nuts, stir, and put on WELL GREASED baking sheets. Bake at 200 (not 300 - they'll burn) for about an hour, turning every 10 minutes or so. To see if they are done, take one out and put it on the counter for a second, then taste. They are soft when they first come out of the oven, but crisp up nicely when cooled. YUMMY!

Tasty results, but unattractive results. There are better recipes to try on this site.

I expected attractive, nicely glazed nuts. Instead I got nuts covered in a sort of thin, spiced meringue. Ugly as sin. Nice enough taste, but not at all crisp (except for the very outside meringe-ish coating).

I followed this recipe as written and it was not good. The nuts came out all fluffy and the sugar mixture fell off! After reading all the suggetions from the others you need them all to get good results. It's a waste of good nuts and time. The recipe should be revised. I will try again next year.

I incorporated everyone's suggestions, including another recipe for candied nuts, and the pecans are delicious! The key is to cook them in a 200-degree oven for an hour, turning every 15 minutes. I used 1 egg white; 1/4 C sugar; 1/4 C light corn syrup; 1 t cinnamon; and 1/2 t each of nutmeg, allspice, and sea salt to 2 1/2 C pecan halves. Next time, I will add ground New Mexico chile to spice them up.

I've made candied pecans and gave them to several of my friends and also gave them the instructions on how to prepare them. They loved them! You can also use Walnuts instead of pecans.

I have roasted Pecans for the holidays for several years and the recipe you present is vry lacking. My pacans are a very eagerly awaited concoction every year in my neighbourhood. First, the temperature of the oven should be 200 degrees. Next, the roasting time is one hour - turning the nuts every 15 minutes. Next, you must HEAVILY BUTTER the cookie sheet!. And lastly, the spices are Cinnamon and alspice. I experiment with the ratio but it is usually 3 to one Cinnamon. This creates a light, sweet, and very crusty nut that one cannot stop eating!

Awful! We threw out $12.00 worth of pecans and a wad more on the other ingredients to make something that looked as bad as it tasted. The eggwhite mixture didn't coat or glaze the nuts. It wrapped it in a puffy jacket that burned on the bottoms, even with 5 minutes less cooking time than required. My daughter's flying to her grandparents tomorrow, and had planned to give that to each family member as her hoiday gift. I guess we should've gone with something tried and true.

I also make this every year, but a much simpler version. 1 egg white beaten, add 1# pecans & coat well. Add 1 c. sugar, 1 t cinnamon and toss. Bake 300 for 40 min, stirring 1/2 way through the baking time. Easy to remember, since all ingredients are "1"s. They disappear fast!

Ive been making this for years and have always had people ask for the recipe. Quick and easy to make, it compares to, and even surpasses, the gourmet candied nuts on the market. Use it as a hostess gift or decrease some of the spices and add cayenne pepper to taste and you'll have a great addition to salads.

I make something very similar to this which is actually an amalgam of two other Epicurious recipes. It's slightly different (longer cooking time/lower temperature) but the same idea. I also use spices (ie: cayenne and black pepper) instead of the cinnamon. The nuts ALWAYS get rave reviews. I would double/triple this recipe and store the nuts in the freezer. They stay fresh and you can always have them on hand for company.

I make these every year but use 4 cups of pecans instead of two. If you only use two cups, they will turn out "goopy" and the pecan taste will be lost. I also add a pinch of ground cloves. They are delicious and I have to hide them from the rest of the family.
