To answer valen007's question about "best" quality = High quality. I terms of brands, for flour use King Arthur's or Bob's Red Mill flour. Both brands offer organic options. If you want whole wheat, use whole wheat pastry flour here. For butter, be sure to use unsalted. I recommend organic or European butter. Natural by Nature is a great brand, cows are grass fed. Organic Valley is my regular brand, but Horizon offers another good organic product. Cabot is a wonderful option but not organic. The recipe from Chef Ryan is fabulous. It is forgiving (I made loads of errors and still had a great King's Cake) but it uses only one quarter of the butter than the 12th night cake.

so - valen007 from CA, i find dear that this recipe is printed with its language the way it is - "the best flour" and "the best butter." these terms mean to use the best product you can afford... its something you should always do. the recipe is a reprint from a cookbook from a different era, keeping its somewhat arcane language intact, and definitely NOT meant to confuse. i LIKE this recipe, as it is brioche as cake. it leaves each chef up to their own imaginations for decorating and glazing. my friends are accustomed to the cheesecake filled gaudy colored king cakes, but this one really makes me happy

So, what does the best flour and butter mean? Please translate into brand names and types like all purpose, Land O lakes butter, what? Thanks!

While this appears to be a basic king cake recipe, I have one that includes more detailed procedures. If interested, follow the link: http://cajunchefryan.rymocs.com/blog2/recipes/king-cake-recipe/ Regards, CCR =:~)

I just wanted to say that you can put charms inside of cakes more safely by tying them with a ribbon that the person can use to pull out or "find" the trinket. For King's cake you could have empty ribbons for each serving except the one ribbon with the charm. You can put the ribbons into the cake or just under frosting with the end of the ribbon showing.

Portugal also bakes a King cake (when the Monarchy ended it was briefly officially called the Republic cake but everybody kept naming it King). Now you can find it the whole year round (they take all the fun of seasonality) but it was the cake for the Dia de Reis on January, 6 when the Magi Kings took offerings to the baby Jesus. Hence the name Bolo Rei (Kings cake) on Dia de Reis (The day of the Kings)  January, 6. Its not very sweet as it takes a lot of crystallized fruits on top and nuts on the inside. It has the form of crown like in Nawlins and it used to have a gold coin inside (traditionally a British gold pound coin in the very rich families) or a lesser value present for finders keepers. A dried fava bean was also included (and separated from the present) indicating next years cake purchaser. European Union safety rules as you can gag on the present or the fava, forbid them now. They take all the fun of simple uses. The point is that nobody knows the origin of the cake. Spain, Italy or France dont have it and now it appears as a tradition on the other side of the Atlantic although every patisserie has a secret own receipt. So a cook stole it and either brought it from the New World or took it there. The cake is supposedly related to Christianity and not to Carnival.

I rated this recipe highly because it seemed like a true brioche-type king cake based on my experience with mardi gras king cakes (mainly Haydels from New Orleans.) I was looking for a great recipe (and naturally looked here at epicurious) but this one has no cinnamon or the confectioners icing. I have never had one without the cinnamon in the twist or without icing. I know I can add it, but someone who never had a king cake wouldn't know it from the given recipe. I don't want a "filled" one, just a regular one. Is it actually more traditional to leave these out or should the recipe state that this is just the "bread part" of the king cake?

Excellent. Just like I've had at Mardi Gras. A comment regarding two other comments; if you don't have experience working with yeast, or if you didn't make the recipe at all, you probably shouldn't review it. The thing I like best about Epicurious is that it is not a beginner's site. If you can't really cook, try Betty Crocker.

At the Cook from MD's suggestion I tried the filled King Cake at mardigras.com and it was excellent. I'm a novice at working with yeast, but the instructions were detailed and the cake turned out surprisingly well. I used Polaner's spreadable raspberry and semisweet chocolate chips as the filling (along with the cream cheese).

Recipe should only be attempted by an accomplished pastry expert. The ingredients do not provide sufficient direction/quantity for a beginner. I searched several other sites and found more promising and tasty versions. After five attempts with various recipes, the best one was the filled King Cake recipe found at Mardigras.com.
