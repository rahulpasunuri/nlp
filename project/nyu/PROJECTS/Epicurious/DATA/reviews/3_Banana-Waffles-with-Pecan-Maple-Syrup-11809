Based on reviews of this recipe, I made some changes: I straight across doubled the recipe, except for bananas, flour, and cornmeal. I ended up with 10 single square waffles. (They freeze and toast really nicely for a quick breakfast during the week.) I used three bananas to boost the banana flavor. Instead of straight across doubling the flour and cornmeal, I used 1 cup of flour and 1/3 cup cornmeal for a little texture. I also mixed up my wet ingredients and then soaked the cornmeal in the wet for 10 minutes to keep it from being too crunchy. They turned out very nice and were delicious with peanut butter. I'm curious about whether you can cut back on the eggs when adding banana to a recipe. I've heard you can substitute but I've never done it. Any thoughts?

This recipe turned out okay, but didn't have enough banana flavor and was lacking overall. I used a regular waffle maker (not Belgian) and it made three waffles. I topped with an extra fresh sliced banana. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix; who makes a bread product with no spices??? Nevertheless, it was good, but not great, so I won't make it again.

We loved this recipe. Very easy to make - and my 2 yr. old and 4 yr. old gobbled them up! They didn't mind the cornmeal in them at all. We didn't use the pecans - but they definitely would make the dish very yummy for adults!

Tasty, but the consistency was too gritty. Next time I'll try more flour and less cornmeal. We skipped the pecans (because we didn't have any) and we think they would have added a lot to the waffles. They turned out well and were pretty easy so we liked them.

I've been making a lot of different waffles lately--sourdough and buttermilk to name two. My 7-year-old loves waffles. He hated these. He said, "Mom, please just make regular buttermilk pancakes from now on!" Normally, he will eat 3 belgium waffles (he's a little guy!) but today he only ate one. I didn't make the pecan maple syrup--just used real maple syrup. I think I might make these again someday for an adult breakfast, because I tasted them and did like them.

These were a nice weekend breakfast - not too sweet (I did not make the syrup but served them with fresh fruit and vanilla yogurt). The cornmeal adds a very nice texture, very easy to make.

It was pretty good. The juice goes into the syrup mixture after it boils.

So where does the orange juice or lemon juice go?(Listed as an ingredient)

The waffles were nice; although, they did not turn out as good as I hoped they would. Something different without alot of extra work.
