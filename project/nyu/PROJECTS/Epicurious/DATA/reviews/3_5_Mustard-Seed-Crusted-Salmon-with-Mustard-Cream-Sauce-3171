Great dinner party dish. We had a crowd, so broiled the salmon instead of sautéing, using a well-buttered sheet pan with a drizzle of butter over the top. The cream sauce took its sweet time to reduce, so next time would do it ahead and gently rewarm.

Very easy, quick and very good. Get good salmon and don't overcook it. I used less mustard seed than called for in the spread and it was plenty flavorful. Served with long grain and wild rice.

Try this with Blackcurrant Dijon Mustard (moutard au cassis de dijon) by Edmond Fallot...so good and the sauce is a beautiful color.

Yum!! Served over orzo, and with asparagus - perfect. The sauce doesn't keep well, though.

Just okay. There are better ways to use a piece of salmon. Won't be making it again.

Quite a lovely presentation! Perfect for entertaining, or as an everyday meal. The sauce is perfect over top of any steamed or grilled vegetable. This recipe will become one of my entertaining staples!

Well, back again to get this receipe. Family loves it so much that they periodically demand it rather than try a new salmon receipe. Be careful not to overcook the salmon.

Great sauce, but I think it was a little too bitter, maybe because I left it sitting away from heat too long. I'll try again with a fruitier white wine. I used Fetzer's chardonnay.

Mouth-watering delicious and easy to prepare. How can you go wrong?

Dinner in less than forty-five minutes. Roasted carrot and red bliss potato chunks with garlic cloves (unpeeled), olive oil, salt and pepper at 400 degrees for one half hour. Made the sauce, sauteed the salmon and had it on the table in a flash. The salmon and sauce were terrific. Just added the vegetable idea so you'd have a dinner that would come together at the same time. Try this; it's great!

A delicate, delicious version of the salmon/mustard combo, and so easy and quick to prepare! I served it with wild rice and fresh asparagus. Make extra sauce to serve on the side. It was so good that my guests used it on the asparagus as well as on the salmon. A winner of a dish!

My family is just so-so when it comes to fish, but with this recipe they go wild for it. They say it is the sauce and the mustard seeds that won them over.
