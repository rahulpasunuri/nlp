This is overly rich and tasted better when I made it a second time without mascarpone and with half the cheese.

Delicious. I almost forgot the marscapone. I think I can easily substitute whole milk for the heavy cream. Served it with salad for a weeknight supper.

lovely. Absolutely lovely. Subbed half & half for the cream, & didn't have truffle oil. Would serve this to Julia Child if she came to dinner - my highest compliment. The flavors were distinct but subtle. Made my own pie crust (sans sugar). My sweetie and I ate half of it, so I'm not sure it serves 8 for dinner. Served it with a caesar salad. It's pretty labor intensive, but makes for a memorable meal.

Oh my. Crazy good! Served with a nice salad and white wine. This is rich but oh-so-worth it. Can't wait to take this to a brunch! The only changes I made were to do a mock-marscapone (cream cheese, sour cream & cream), milk instead of heavy cream and no truffle oil. My understanding of using truffle oil is that it's meant as a flavoring AFTER cooking, anyway. The dijon on the crust is great -- don't skip this step!

This was a fabulous hit, even without the truffle oil. Really wonderful.

OMG! I followed verbatim. I adore cauliflower and cheese (and basically everything that's in this!) and this recipe did not disappoint. I even had the truffle oil! Wish I could upload the picture I took with pride!

YUM! I left out the truffle oil because I didn't have any, but SO good anyways! Obviously a little indulgent...but everything in moderation!

So good! I would have given it four forks but since I am trying to avoid hydrogenated oils I had to make the pie crust myself - much more labor intensive. The flavor was delicious and paired perfectly with a Zolo Torrontes white wine. Next time I plan on adding asparagus.

Crazy tasty. I used a frozen pie crust and it was fine. I oversalted the cauliflower a bit, but thankfully it was OK in the end. I'll definitely make this again, despite the fat content.

Ridiculously good, but very rich. Definitely a recipe to break out as an indulgent treat every once in a while. I left out the truffle oil, since I was out, and I don't think it was missed. I thought it was relatively easy to make and didn't find it too time consuming. It's worth the effort & multiple steps required (roasting the cauliflower, carmelizing the onions, pre-baking the tart shell) because the end result is so delicious.

This was awesome.. Made it for a dinner party and it was a hit. There was none left. I left out the truffle oil as I didnt have any and it was still delicious.

This was seriously good, I left my cauliflower in florets..couldn't see the need for slicing it? And didn't use truffle oil as I didn't have any! Made my own pie crust and this will definitely make it to my list for special occasions.

I agree that this is a rich dish and the prep was time consuming, but overall I liked it very much. The cauliflower roasted in about half the time and, as with another reviewer, I couldn't "slice" it when done, but did cut into small pieces and it worked fine. I did serve it along side a roasted chicken which was too much. Next time I'll just serve it with a salad. I also didn't have truffle oil and am not sure what it would have added. I might try it next time.

This was fantastic. Great combination of flavors and a lovely texture. I pre-baked the pie crust the day before, then prepared the rest day of. I cut down on the marscapone to only 6 oz, and could not fit all of the cauliflower in the pan (that made a tasty treat on its own). I served this with a green salad and it was filling but not too heavy.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times. The last time I eliminated one egg, the mascarpone, and truffle oil (in the interest of not blocking my arteries). It was still delicious. Use a heartier dijon mustard for more robust flavor. The cauliflower right out of the oven is like candy.

I gave diners the option of sprinkling truffle oil before they ate. That gave a better, more immediate truffle flavor--the heat does break down some of the truffle flavor during cooking, it seems. This is a lovely rich dish, though definitely a guilty pleasure.

Very good particularly nice for special occasions. SURTOUT....I think you would be happier with a homemade crust. A few good recipes exist on this site.

A standout dish that will woo a crowd! Each bite is fantastic. Added to my special occasion rotation--works equally well for brunch or dinner.

Surprised how much I enjoyed this- big fan of truffle oil, not so much of cauliflower. But I found the orange kind and had to use it. Couldn't really "slice" the roasted cauliflower, but cut it into little pieces. (Tasted one piece that got overly dark in the oven and it was heavenly.) Next time will absolutley prep the onions and veggie in advance. Time consuming but easy. Took others advice and added the parmesan for the last 20 mins of baking. Yum.

I am giving this 2 forks because it is good, but not outstanding in any way. Maybe more onions would add flavor. (As for roasting and caramelizing times, I found them close to what the recipe says.)

I thought this was excellent. My husband and I loved it an also felt you could serve this for breakfast. I didn't use the cream but milk instead and it was still rich. I did use the truffle oil but am not sure it was necessary. My kids did not care for it but I sort of expected that.

Very good, but too rich to make very often. I don't think the truffle oil is necessary, as it is undetectable.

I have made this twice and it is absolutely delicious. I would love suggestions on how to make the crust flakier... perhaps a home made rather than store-bought crust? Would a puff pastry work well? I would appreciate any thoughts on improving the crust.

I made this without the crust for Valentine's Day. Everyone loved it, even my husband who is not a big cauliflower fan. I would definitely make it again.

Oh, and I didn't use truffle oil, just olive oil and it baked in less time. Maybe my oven was fast.

This tart was delicious and lighter than I had anticipated. The only changes I made were to deglaze the onions with a little balsamic and to only use the gruyere. I used a half butter/half shortening pie dough. My boyfriend and mom loved it as well. Certainly a keeper. Good use for the cauliflower from the CSA share and the eggs we get as well. http://fineeats.blogspot.com/

Great flavors, very rich, maybe too rich. May try a "light" version next time. I had no truffle oil, but did have some tartufo cheese with truffles so I subbed some of that for some of the gruyere. Not much truffle flavor came through so I'll definitely try the truffle oil next time.

big hit! I suggest adding the parmesan after the tart has baked for 30 minutes...my topping looked to brown...but still delish!

Really really good. I used 2% milk instead of cream- and it tasted plenty rich enough.

Rating: 4
This was very good. I agree to cut down the parmesan cheese. The onions took about 20 minutes for me. I use a brocoflower instead of cauliflower. I will make this again. Would probably be good with broccoli, too.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Will make it again. But like the prior review I found 40 min for the onions too much. I only cooked it until it caramelized wich was probably no more than 10-15 minutes. Did not have truffle oil but it still tasted very good. Also, I thought that the 3/4 cup parmesan was too much so I cut it to 1/2 cup.

onions on medium for 40 minutes sounds extreme to me. is that a typo? should it be 4?

I had a little trouble with the crust in the tart pan, so made this in a regular pie plate and it worked out great. This recipe is a wonderful combination of ingrediants and flavors.....we will definitely make this again.

Fantastic recipe. Great for a brunch, or even as a side to a thanksgiving dinner. Find a deep pie dish, or if using a traditional aluminum throw-away, you will want to cut down a bit on the liquid or it will overflow. Other than that small suggestion, stick with the recipe (even down to the white pepper) - it does itself justice. Oh, and to the cook from WI, don't penalize a recipe with 2 forks because you burnt the onions, used cream cheese and no truffle oil. Try it again, do it right, and then post a review.

I used this recipe to make 6 very full individual tarts. I roasted the cauliflower and cooked the onions the day before. That being done, it came together very quickly for a delicious brunch.

This was AMAZING (and I didn't even have truffle oil) Served with ham and a green salad.

This was a delicious dish! I caramelized the onions and cauliflower the night before, so this was a cinch to put together. I made some modification for what I had on hand--ricotta instead of mascarpone, 2% milk instead of cream, and no truffle oil--and it still turned out beautifully. Next time Ill search out truffle oil

Vary good. Tasty. Not low-cal. Great for a vegetarian dish.

This was very tasty and a beautiful dish. It took me 2 hours from stat to finish - probably best to roast the cauliflower and caramelize the onion a day before to save time. I could not find either of the cheeses so I used a good cheddar and it turned out wonderfully! Although, this is no "quick" meal, it is worth the effort if you have the time!

The glorious hint of truffle oil lent this tart a delicate sophisticated flavor and complemented the roasted cauliflower well - I'd recommend using it if you can. My florets were on the small side and roasted brown rather quickly; moved the roasting pan up a level after turning. The cauliflower itself was on the way too small side so I'd recommend using a 'medium' head. Used Emmenthaler as I had it onhand - just delicious. I too used my own pate brisee and a broader (10-inch) quiche pan, so I did not need to bake the tart longer as did other reviewers. This is more time consuming than most quiche recipes especially if you prefer making your own crust, but definitely worth it. Served with roasted heirloom tomatoes with roasted garlic and thyme, roasted potatoes, and a light salad with shaved fennel.

I had the cauliflower larger than 1" due to the floret size, and the pieces burned in half the time and were raw inside. The onions, which my daughter was sauteing, burned in half the time - I'd do them on low next time, for half the time. I used cream cheese and milk, all olive oil, and swiss cheese and my own pie crust. The filling was gloppy and the eggs did not incorporate into the cream cheese mixture. It was quite difficult to make. Imagine my surprise when the dish came out edible (though the crust burnt). It actually tasted very good (expecially the cheesy part) but was quite hearty, so small pieces. Next time I'd steam the cauliflower and simply saute the onions til golden. It took the time it said, to bake.

I adore this recipe, but have to note it takes a LOT longer to bake then stated in the recipe. Like, about an hour an a half. Which is worth it, but needs to be noted for planning purposes. I think this a great dinner party dish, especially since so many parts can be made ahead of time. Would also work great at a brunch.

Rating: 3
I made this without the crust. I used frozen cauliflower -- microwaved it and did not use the truffle oil. The onions did not take as long to carmelize. I used swiss cheese along with grated romano and it turned out quite well. Next time I would add other vegetables such as spinach or mushrooms. I baked it for 40 minutes and it puffed up nicely. I will make this again as a side dish or for brunch.

Used Egg Beaters instead of eggs, it worked fine with no change in taste, I'm sure.

Steaming the cauliflower florets worked much better than roasting; didn't use the truffle oil and don't think it was missed. Husband and I both enjoyed the recipe, I will try another cheese next time, too. I didn't use all the cream mixture, tart pan too full and it was fine.

Very rich - it definitely needs some salad or other greens on the side. My cauliflower also roasted about twice as quickly as the time listed; I also had to bake the tart for about 50 minutes instead of 40.

This was an absolutely delicious and attractive dish. We're doing low carbs so I made it without the crust and it was still great. Will make again and again as a side dish or for a brunch.

Very easy recipe, and it's a lovely tart. I thought the onions and cauliflower were a great combination, although the cauliflower roasted quicker than the recommended time. Everyone loved it, and we all had seconds!

Very rich. Oddly sweet taste of carmelized onions don't work that well with the other smooth and subtle ingredients. My guests really enjoyed it though, so maybe it was just me. Watch the cauliflower when roasting--mine took half the time indicated in the recipe.

Superb, different, delicious, everyone raved favorably! Next time, I'll cut the parmesian toping to 1/4 cup, watch the baking time, needed an extra 10 min. Cut into 1 1/2 inch squares, easily served 18.

This is great! Made my own pie dough (without the sugar). It's pretty rich, so I served it with a simple salad of arugula tossed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper-- the acidity of the salad went well with the richness of the tart. In addition to the 1-9" tart I had enough to make 2-4" tartlets as well. Keep an eye on it-- it only took 30 minutes to bake through, not 40. Next time I make it I might tweak it and play with some mushrooms and bacon. Yum!
