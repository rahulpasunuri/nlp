This tasted alright, but really I have to ask "what's the point?". It's little more than a burger with minimal added flavorings. The "mayo" was okay, but you could easily just whip up whatever you like. The apple "slaw" was entirely pointless. Following previous review, I squeezed out the excess liquid before adding more; but once it was finished, it was really flavorless and added nothing at all to the burger. I won't make this recipe again; I'll just experiment on my own next time.

I've made this burger several times and it is sooooo incredibly good! We like to substitute ground lamb for the pork, though - I really think that helped the flavors (especially the rosemary!) to flourish. And you can always just coarsely chop the apples instead of grating.

I loved this! I don't have a grill, so I made this on the stove top. The sage and rosemary in the burgers was delicious, and the apples added a subtle crunch and tang. The 'mayo' could have been more exciting, but I liked it's simplicity since so much was already going on in the burger.

Although wanted a "healthier" alternative to a traditional burger, this was interesting... the apple slaw makes bun mushy so I would recommend straining or try slices but the slaw does almost feel like a "special" sauce, wasn't thrilled with the sage, would just stick with the rosemary next time
