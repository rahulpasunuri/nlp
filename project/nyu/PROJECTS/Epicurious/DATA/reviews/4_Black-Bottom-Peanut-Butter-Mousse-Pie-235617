This pie rocks...it's a keeper. The recipe was so easy and delicious. I followed the reviews of others by increasing the graham crackers to 9 (with a bit more butter) to fill a deep dish 9" pie plate, substituting 1 cup PB and 1/2 cup powered sugar for those horribly waxy and flavorless PB chips, substituting evaporated milk for the cream in the chocolate mixture to ensure a smooth consistency, and reserving a small portion of the chocolate mixture to drizzle on the top. Do not, as suggested by some reviewers, change the grahams to oreos -- too sweet; or decrease the amount of chocolate -- it's just right!

This is the best PB Pie ever! I make it for the restaurant that I work at and our customers love it!! Super easy and fast to make. A++++++

AMAZING. I thought by using all the chocolate in the pie it made it too rich (my boyfriend agreed). Next time I will use about 3/4 chocolate within the pie and save the other 1/4 for drizzling on top. I also drizzled peanut butter syrup on top and sprinkled some crushed up Reese cups on top. To die for!

This is the best pie I have ever had. I brought it to a party and it was gone quickly. Decadent!! If you love chocolate and peanut butter, you will love this pie. I can't say enough about it. I am in love with this pie. I will be making it again for our Halloween party even though it doesn't fit the theme.

It sure was delicious but way too heavy for me. If I ever make it again I'd make some changes, like...no butter, no cream...nonfat quark instead....I bet you won't notice a thing.

Fabulous! I made it for a child's birthday and it went over spectacularly. I followed the recipe precisely EXCEPT I used a store bought graham cracker crust because I was lazy. Perfect recipe just the way it is.

Definitely a keeper! I loved the fluffy peanut butter topping, and the chocolate was a wonderful compliment. The pie vanished very quickly. I do agree that there is a bit too much chocolate sauce though. I saved some for drizzling on top, but still had leftovers, which I will use to make some chocolate dipped strawberries. Next time I think I will try the chocolate crust. The graham crackers were good, but the flavor got lost in between the peanut butter and chocolate, so it didn't add much to the flavor.

Made this yesterday. Used a 9.5 inch pie plate. Did a regular chocolate crust (1 3/4 cups choc crumbs, 1/4 cup + 2 TB sugar, 1 stick of butter). Did the 1 C peanut butter & 1/2 c confection sub instead of the peanut butter chips. Topped with whipped cream. Everyone loved it & it FILLED the 9.5 inch deep dish pie plate. I would make it again, was pretty easy & impressive looking

This was raved over by family who consider themselves experts on peanut butter pies--however, you only need a small portion of the chocolate mixture for the pie crust. The portion the recipe produces is far too much. But other than that, perfect!

I suggest by all means take all the reviewers advice & make 'Chocolate filled Oreo crust instead of graham cracker, & use 1 c. processed peanut butter plus 1/2c. confectioners sugar instead of the peanut butter morsels! And I used a 'deep dish pie plate'. If I could give this 4000 Forks I would! Everyone loved this & couldn't stop complimenting me for making it! One person told me it tasted like the quality of desert that you would find at an elegant fine dining restaurant! {Per recommendation from other reviewers I made a crust using 30 of the Chocolate filled Oreo Cookies processed into crumbs with room temp butter {about 1/3rd cup, a little less than 1/2 c. butter.} I saved about 1/4 c. of the chocolate ganache spread mixture & drizzled it on top of the completed pie along with some lightly salted chopped peanuts. Serve it Cold! AMAZING!

Just ate the chocolate peanut butter pie at Emeril's in New Orleans and wanted to replicate it for Thanksgiving. This recipe was perfect! I followed other reviewers and used 1 cup peanut butter beaten with 1/2 cup powdered sugar instead of pb chips. Made an oreo cookie crust instead of graham crackers and used only one tbs of corn syrup. Also, after mixing the pb and powdered sugar, lightened the mixture with a blob of whipped cream and then just put the pb mixture into the partially whipped cream to finish whipping and it worked great. Much less work that folding it into the pb. This entire pie was eaten in no time and it tasted to me just like the wonderful one at the restaurant. Also decorated with chopped peanuts and chocolate like the photo shows. Everyone loved it.

This was amazing! It was everything I hoped for and more...I followed the advice of other reviewers and skipped the fake pb chips and whipped 1 c. peanut butter with 1/2 c. of powdered sugar, and finished the recipe in my standing mixer. It was delicious. Topped it off with whipped cream and the chocolate sauce drizzled. Incidentally, I omitted the corn syrup in the chocolate and replaced it with honey...heavenly. DO Make this one, you won't regret it!

This recipe became an instant family favorite when I first made it four years ago. I reviewed it on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Rating: 3
I made a few significant changes to this recipe out of personal preferance. First, I used an Oreo crust (Black Bottom Chocolate Pie, BA Oct. 1999) instead of the graham cracker one mentioned (not a fan). Then, to avoid that artificial taste peanut butter chips tend to have, I substituted one cup of smooth peanut butter and 1/2 powdered sugar. This worked wonderfully, and gave the mousse a lovely, distinctly peanutty flavor. This is quite a rich dessert, and we got 10 servings out of it.

Rating: 4
This is yummy! I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I used the packaged graham cracker crumbs and followed the pie crust recipe on the box. I used Reese's peanut butter chips and thought they worked fine. For the chocolate drizzle, I reserved about 4 tablespoons of the chocolate that goes on the bottom & mixed it with chocolate syrup. 10 minutes before serving I took this out of the fridge & had no problems slicing. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Very good, very easy. I particularly liked the graham cracker crust. I thought the chocolate was a little much, but my husband disagreed, so there you have it - could be that I'm just more of a peanut butter than a chocolate person. Peanut butter mousse was excellent. Tried to make it a little lighter by adding some low fat cream cheese and milk in lieu of 1/2 the cream. I also omitted the corn syrup and could not tell any difference. I took some of the extra chocolate and dipped strawberries in it, then placed them on a Silpat-lined baking sheet in the fridge. Very easy way to have beautiful chocolate covered strawberries with the leftover.

We thought this recipe was very good. I had a little problem with the crust though, not enough crumbs to go up the sides of the pie plate and very hard to cut once it was finished. Thought the flavor was great though and loved the chocolate peanut butter combo. I wouldn't cut back on the chocolate; to us, that was the best part. We'll definitely make this one again.

Rating: 4
Very good and easy too! I made this for a work birthday party and received rave reviews! The only changes I made were to use Newman's ginger cream filled cookies for the crust, to avoid the partially hydrogenated oil in graham crackers. I did scrape out the cream filling and followed the other steps to the crust. I also used more vanilla extract in both the chocolate and peanut butter mixtures. I think it could be successfully lightened up on the fat etc but you gotta indulge once in awhile....

This was delicious and fluffy, yet rich. It got rave reviews when I brought it to a dinner with friends. I will be making this again and again. Don't even think about using a store-bought graham cracker crust. I saved time using some leftover chocolate sauce I already had- which firms up in the fridge to a soft truffle-like consistency. this made it a very easy pie to make. The chocolate was the chocolate sauce recipe from the America's Test Kitchen Family cookbook, and it was perfect in this pie.

3 hours into this and still not sure if it will be edible... I listened to the other reviewers and made some of the adjustments they had done to lower fat content. When melting chips, in place of cream I subbed 2% evaporated milk. BAD IDEA - at least not without knowing what you are doing, which I clearly don't. When added to the whipped cream, it caused it to fall and turn into a runny goop. I managed to reserect the mousse by placing the bowl in the fridge for an hour and some of the filling into the freezer. When I re-whipped it, it did turn out OK. I then attempted to drop onto the base layer, but it still had not set enough and it now resembles chocolate - peanut butter soup.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious! It took virtually no time at all to get it all together. When serving I like to set it out for a little bit to get soft.

This is a VERY rich pie. More along the lines of a cheesecake than a mousse pie, but very yummy either way. If you don't like peanut butter, don't make this, but if you do, you'll love this pie. In the chocolate layer, I used evaporated milk in place of the whipping cream to make it easier to cut into. In the peanut butter layer, I used 1 cup of creamy peanut butter + 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in place of the peanut butter chips. The amount of graham crackers was just right for a 9" pie plate; had no problems getting an even thickness for the crust. The only mistake I made was cutting the pie into pieces, not realizing how rich this pie really is. Cutting this pie into anything less than 8 pieces is way to much, and this is coming from someone that sometimes just cuts pies into 4 pieces! This recipe is a keeper!

Wow. Really peanut- buttery, really rich. You'll grow a second chin after one piece! If you use 2/3 of the chocolate on the crust and drizzle the rest atop the mousse, it's delicious. If not using PB chips, use creamy PB and add powdered sugar to your taste! So many reviewers disagree with the sweetness that you should just add it to taste yourself - don't assume it's 1/2 or 1/3 cup...

Rating: 3
Please make sure that the chocolate is hardened completely before pouring the peanut butter mousse on top.I put the chocolate in the freezer for 1 minutes as decribed in the recipe ad it was not even close to being enough time. When I put the mousse on top all of the chocolate oozed up and almost our of the pie pan. It looks messy, but I am sure it will taste good. Next time, I know what to do! I lso don't think that there is enough graham craqcker crust to cover the bottom and sides with sufficient thickness. I would follow my other granham cracker crust recipe next time- 1 package of grahams crushed, 6 T. melted butter, 3 T. of sugar.

There's an awful lot of chocolate blackness at the bottom of this! I wasn't thinking clearly and was very heavy- handed with the "drizzle" and almost suffocated this poor pie, what with the darkness from above and below. You could probably skip the "drizzle" and use whipped cream with the peanuts. When you get to the bottom, you'll understand why. Rich and addictive.

Wonderful! I don't care for the artificial taste of peanut butter chips, so I took the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted 1 cup natural peanut butter and 3/4 cup powdered sugar.

We'll make this recipe regularly--now I just need to find a way to work off all that whipping cream!

I made this for my best friend's birthday and everyone loved it. I could not find any peanut butter chips (4 stores, I looked) so I used regular peanut butter. In hindsight, I should have added a little sugar to make up for the regular peanut butter. Still everyone loved this and the presentation came out great. I only chilled it for about 2 hours and I think it could have been better chilled harder. Also I drizzled the chocolate on top, but when we attempted to cut the pie, the drizzle would not cut easily and "mushed" in on the pb topping. Next time I would do chocolate curls instead of drizzle.

This was so very good. I can't say I agree remotely with the other reviews to halve the chocolate layer as it was a beautiful layer of creamy rich chocolate, which I choose to go with ghirardelli bittersweet chips. This lady knows what she's doing.The peanut mousse layer was light as air but had a wonderful rich peanuty taste, do be careful to not over whip the cream before adding to the peanut mixture as mine didn't incorporate easily but didn't affect the final product and was undetectable by the time I served it. I will hunt down reasons to make it again soon.

Light and creamy, despite all the calories! I followed the recipe precisely aside from using speculaas cookies for the crust (can't get graham crackers here, but to be honest, the speculaas give a richer taste anyway) and as suggested by at least one reviewer, I only used 2/3 of the chocolate sauce for the crust and drizzled the rest on top (though it was thick enough the I probably should say I dropped globs of it on top). There was still far too much sauce so next time I'll cut it by a third. Otherwise the pie was fantastic and drew lots of compliments. No leftovers on this one and my kids begged to scoop up the crumbs!

Delicious! I know that there's no point in trying to make desserts like this healthy, but it doesn't actually need to be quite as fat (or sugary) as it is. I've now made it twice without the corn syrup in the base or sugar in the crust, and have used unsweetened evaporated milk instead of whipping cream to melt the chocolate and the peanut butter chips. There's been no difference in texture or flavour, and people keep asking me to make it again. Even my mother, who doesn't like peanut butter, asked me to make this for her birthday.

One last item I'd like to cover...there was TOO much of the cholocate mixture so I omitted what I didn't feel like using and drizzled some on top, made a beautiful presentation.

To the cook from London: Malt biscuits are much more similar to graham crackers than digestive biscuits but if you can't get malt biscuits (but I'm pretty sure Australia and England are pretty similar in terms of what staples you can get from the supermarket) then digestive biscuits are your best bet.

I have not made this recipe so I did not rate it. This bears an astonishing resemblance to my Black Bottom Peanut Butter Pie which was a finalist recipe in the Pillsbury Bake-Off in March 2006.

Forgot to answer about Graham Crackers (which you can get at the same site or stop in their store in Covent Garden) Graham Crackers Graham Crackers: Invented in 1829 by one Sylvester Graham. Some called him a quack. Others an eccentric. With the passage of time, even more call him a genius. He was an American clergyman and a rip-roaring advocate of temperance, vegetarianism and... the graham cracker. The closest thing the UK has to the Graham Cracker is a digestive biscuit, but they definitely aren't digestive biscuits. The only way we can describe them is like a cross between a digestive biscuit and a Ryvita. They're not as sweet as a digestive biscuit, but they are nevertheless a sweet biscuit.

This isn't quite on the rarefied echelon with my other chocolate desserts, but it's still outstanding and I definitely will make it again. Simple to prepare, too.

To all you fellow Australians- yes, it is true we don't have the same amount or variety of candy as they do in North America and I think that peanut butter chips would be one of the last things that Australia ever decided to import or make here considering that PB just isn't loved over here as it is in North America but you can, as Perth advised, just melt more PB instead of using the PB chips, just add a little more sugar when making the PB filling. I don't like PB in my desserts (whoever thought PB could be used to make cookies- blech) so did not like this at all but my husband, being from Canada, liked this very much. I would only make this again if I had a party full of North Americans coming cos' I don't think it would get eaten by any of my Australian friends. I am giving it 3 forks because I know that if you like PB in your desserts than you will probably like this but personally I did not.

This recipe is so sinful. The crust is delicious. A big hit.

To the Aussies - chocolate chips are what you use to make nestles toll house cookies and peanut butter chips would be the peanut butter version of the same thing.

To the comment about chocolate chips and peanut butter chips in Australia - I live in Perth WA and I have not been able to find peanut butter chips at the grocery store. They are just the chocolate morsels, though. Just go to the baking section and you'll see the chocolate bits. I reckon just melting peanut butter right out of the jar tastes the same as using the peanut butter bits. That is how I did it and it was pretty good.

Would love to make this, Please advise what would be the equivalent of chocolate chips & peanut butter chips in Australia. Sorry to use this section, don't know where else to inquire.

This pie was very good. I didn't get the top layer as fluffy as I wish it had been. However, it didn't seem to matter, it was gone in 60 seconds.!

I made this tonight for a dinner gathering and everyone liked it - even my picky 8 year old. However, I agree with the above reviewer in that the chocolate was a little overpowering for the mousse. I used a combination of semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips and although it was delicious, the chocolate layer was thicker than I think it should be. I would make this again but just pour enough of a bottom layer of chocolate to have an accent for the mousse. Also, I was really nervous about overbeating the mousse (due to the warning at the bottom of the message) but I think I actually underbeat it. Even so, this was really delicious and I will make it again.

I made this for my bridge group, who really love rich, chocolate desserts. This fits the bill! They raved about it, but I think that it was a little rich, even for them! (or maybe my portion was too large?) And that's even though I used Light Cream for all but the whipped cream for the mousse. It's very rich, but not too sweet. Personally, I felt that the chocolate overwhelmed the mousse. I had a 9 1/2 inch diameter pie pan, and would add another graham cracker for the crust the next time. I drizzled chocolate syrup on top, but did not sprinkle peanuts, as the recipe suggests for the presentation. I thought that the peanut butter mousse was really excellent, and did not have an opportunity to shine in this recipe. Next time, I will reduce the amount of chocolate, and increase the mousse proportionatly. The pie is easy to cut, and looks beautiful. I garnished each plate with a strawberry and some mint to complete the presentation after drizzling the chocolate sauce over the pie and the plate. This is really very good, and easy to make.
