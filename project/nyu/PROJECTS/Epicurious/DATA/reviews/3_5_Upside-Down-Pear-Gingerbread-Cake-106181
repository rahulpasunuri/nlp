This was a nice holiday cake - very moist. I only had strong molasses in the house and agree that milder molasses would be better - it was a bit overpowering in my rendition. I might actually use only 3/4 cup in my next attempt.

Rating: 4
Delicious, moist and very fragrant! I made this in 9 in cake pans and the batter was enough to fill 2. I substituted about 1/4 C grated fresh ginger for the ground ginger so perhaps the ginger flavor was not too pronounced. Next time I would up the fresh ginger to 1/2 C.

Autumn and winter fall crowd pleaser, guaranteed. When I'm jammed with time, for sure the gingerbread mix is a good cheap savior. Yes, I toss in some candied ginger bits (thank you, Penzeys) in the gingerbread. Quick and easy to top with whipped cream or ice cream (vanilla obivous, but also ginger, or Toscanini's burnt caramel if you're in the area). BUt if you're into it -- try a nice creme anglaise sauce in a small pool, a little drizzedl over the top. Or (this is my day for cheap tricks) simmer some sweetened condensed milk with a little rum and add ginger bits if you like for a dulce de leche type sauce.

This dessert was not only beautiful but also really good. Sugar is just right and with some ice cream it is a great fall dessert. I did use a seasoned cast iron pan. Be careful not to burn the sugar/butter combination at the beginning. I had to do it twice. The second time I just put the butter and sugar together and simmered about a couple of minutes. Other than that, it worked great. Make sure to cool the molasses water combination also before pouring into the butter batter.

Great cake. I did a test run for Thanksgiving. I like the suggestions for adding extra pears. Also, I think I'll cut down on the butter based on others' suggestions. The top came out a little goopy and messy, but as it cooled it got a little more manageable. I used an 11-inch cast-iron skillet and it fit the batter perfectly. I'm guessing the extra butter made the top a little messier though...

This is a wonderful dessert. I would make no changes. I did not have light brown sugar, so used dark. Did not have light molasses, so used dark. Still great. Only problem is that the batter was too much for my iron pan, so I put some in a little bread pan.....which was great for snacking! Also, it feeds about 12 people, not 12! I have now made this twice and it is in my BEST recipe pile.

I can't believe the reviewer that said this "wasn't pretty". It is unbelievably gorgeous and the presentation is spectacular. It has just about every texture and taste sensation any food could have. It's my favorite dessert,for fancy and casual dinner finales. If I could only have one food on a deserted island, it would be this.

This recipe never misses. My family won't let me in the door without this cake over the holidays. If you follow the recipe faithfully you can't go wrong. And if you like a stronger ginger flavor, you can double the ginger and/or add candied ginger to give it a kick. This is a rich, decadent, gooey holiday treat that will be remembered by all who enjoy it.

I love this recipe! My daughter made a similar recipe one year for christmas and I wanted to learn how to make it. I went on this website and found this recipe. This recipe is actually much better. I now make it for Christmas every year

I used gingerbread mix (horrors) and it came out just fine though a bit much for the cake pan but I had put it on a baking sheet in anticipation. This time I'm going to add candied ginger to the mix and serve it with whipped cream with a bit of ground ginger and cinnamon.

This was moist and very flavorful. I didn't have enough molasses (only about 1/4 c.)so I used what I had and substituted maple syrup for the rest. Though this recipe was VERY good, I would try all molasses next time and maybe more ginger (only because I love a strong ginger flavor). Yum!

I loved this recipe...perfect for a cool fall evening. I had to substitute blackstrap molasses for the mild but I thought it was still good. I love the deep rick favors. Will make it again very soon but will use mild molasses as called for.

Very easy, even for a non-baker like me, and very good but not nearly gingery enough. Note that the Guinness Stout Ginger Cake recipe on this site calls for 2 Tablespoons of ground ginger!

I made this recipe to the exact specs, EXCEPT I had regular unsulfured molasses, not mild. It turned out horrible. The gingerbread was far too strong for the more subtle -- albeit sweet -- pears. When the recipe says it prefers mild molasses, make it a must!

Rating: 4
Read the reviews/problems,etc and found another just like this but with LESS amt. so it doesn't overflow; plenty of molasses taste but not overwhelming. I used an 8inch springform pan (it's deeper) sprayed with Pam. Prepared the fruit in a saute pan then arranged pear slices in a spiral in springform, pour sauce over. Cover the bottom with large piece of foil wrapped up sides and put baking sheet under to prevent leaking of sugar topping! This is so easy to unmold and quite pretty. I garnished with minced candied ginger; served with good vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it! Topping: 1/4c.butter;1/2c.brownsugar;3 pears, sliced. Cake: 1&1/2c.flour;3/4tsp.soda;2tsp.ginger; 1tsp.cinnamon;1/4tsp.cloves;1/8tsp. salt;1/4c.molasses;1/3c.water(with 1tsp.vanilla);1/2c.butter;1/2c.brown sugar; 1 egg. Follow same directions; bake 35-40min.@350 degrees.

I made this today, and instead of pears, used 3 medium sized apples, sliced thinly. It turned out beautifully. I served it with a caramel rum sauce...I can't wait to make and serve it again !

Rating: 4
Excellent. I do not own a cast-iron skillet or a pan deep enough for this recipe so I used a 10-in springform cake pan instead, which was fine, but I should have cooked the pear-sugar mixture longer to compensate. Molasses is not sold in liquid form out here so I used date syrup instead, which worked just as well and still gave it that nice deep brown color. Was asked for the recipe but every person who ate it.

Rating: 4
This was easy and good! All the adults loved it, including the ones who don't like pears. The flavours are a bit too complex for kids. I was surprised by how "soupy" the batter was, but it baked up into a nice moist cake. There was too much batter for my 10 1/2 inch cast iron skillet - so I baked the rest in ramekins.

Rating: 3
My modifications were to use 2/3 C each molasses and brown sugar.Omit the water, used 1/2 C milk. Substitute 1/2 C oil for the butter and use 2 eggs. I was end a rush so I ended mixing in 2 pears (diced). Baked in a bundt pan. Not the same recipe but wonderful none-the-less.

The 2nd time I made it, I only use 1/4 cup of molases and maybe 1/4 cup of water, and the cake turned out much better--not as soggy. Also I used more pears than the recipe suggested. Basically layer the bottom of the pan with wedged pears, somewhat overlapping them. Thirdly, I didn't use an Iron skillet, because I don't have one. The cake turned out just fine using my 9" round cake pan. It was a hit dessert post Christmas eve dinner this past holiday with my family. Very delicious when served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent - got raves. Prepared just as specified, just added a few pecan pieces to the pears. Will definitely make it again!

I have made this twice, this week already! I use full flavored molasses & the batter smells really strong, but the cake comes out without an overwhelming flavor. Use very firm Bosc pears & eat out of the oven with whipped cream or ice cream! So easy & perfect everytime! This comes out very light, for gingerbread & it serves about 15, not 6! Enjoy

Rating: 1
Too, dense? Yes, too dense! At first I thought I'd underbaked it, but on second review, I think there was just too much liquid in the batter, since it was cooked but had a fudgy consistency. Along those same lines, it tasted as though there was too much molasses (the flavor had a lot of bite) and definitely not enough sugar. I had to throw the whole thing out.

Rating: 4
it turned out exceptionally beautiful, i was so glad. it was very moist, but a little on the dense side. i'm not sure why. but it tasted lovely and was excellent served with whipped cream.

The pear tree in my community had a particularly good year, so we decided to have a pear party. Although the pears weren't the best, I added some apple slices. The cake got rave reviews, and was especially complemented by the pear ice cream someone else made! I followed other people's suggestions, doubling spices and adding fresh ginger. I used a 10" skillet, and thanks to others' advice, I put some of the batter in small Bundt muffin molds...and the skillet still bubbled over a bit! But it was great to have the little muffins to try before serving the cake to others. Would definitely make again!

Rating: 4
This definitely got rave reviews from my dinner guests (my husband, who doesn't usually rave about food, called it "exceptional")! I did what the other reviewers suggested and sliced the pears thin while reducing the amount of molasses to 3/4 cup. However, instead of increasing the amount of ground ginger, I added fresh minced ginger which greatly added to the flavor. If you use a 10 inch cast iron skillet, I would suggest placing the pan on a cookie sheet in the oven to catch drippings as and the batter pretty much went right up to the rim of the pan. Will definitely make again!

This recipe as written was served at a dinner party Sunday to rave reviews. We all agreed it's the best gingerbread in our experience and a little vanilla ice cream is just the right accent. Definitely a recipe to keep and repeat for me.

Correction: I would only double the ginger, not the cinnamon and cloves, since the latter two actually come through nicely.

oops in previous review I erroneously said I used 1/4c butter. In fact, I used 1/8th.

Didn't rate, as I cheated but thought I'd share my experience. I have a 5 month old baby so anything I can bake these days has to be a dressed up mix! I used gngerbread mix augmented with extra cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, and canned pears. I used about 1/4 c butter and maybe 3T of light brown sugar. Melted the butter in 8" cake pan on stove top, stirred in sugar. Sliced pears and arranged as in tarte tatin. Covered with gingerbread mix. Baked 30 minutes. Came out very tasty. I've just eaten three slivers warm

Rating: 4
Follow the advice of other and double the spices and use less molasses. I went with 3/4 cup. My only other adjustment was to use 4 1/2 large Bosc pears, all thinly sliced. Fantastic fall and holiday dish. Whipped cream with a touch of cardammon is a good alternative to ice cream for a lighter dessert.

This was extremely easy and delicious. I made it for a party and it got rave reviews. I am sampling a leftover piece today and its even better the second day.

Rating: 4
Loved this recipe. Reading previous reviews I decided to follow advice and use light brown sugar for the caramel in the pan, which turned out great. When I took my molasses out of the pantry there was only 1/4 cup left, so I used golden syrup for the balance and that was fine. There was extra gingerbread batter so I baked it alongside in an 8" pan and it came out wonderfully, I would even make the cake without the caramel and pears for plain gingerbread cake. I had a cast iron pan so used that, and couldn't have been happier with the end result, well worth the effort.

Rating: 2
I really like the concept of this cake AND the presentation. I used a non-stick Creuset frying pan which worked great. I also used a combination of pears and apples which worked really well together texture and taste wise. The only problem was that I only had dark brown sugar, which when caramelized made the cake taste like I had dumped a jar of molasses on top. I increased the ginger and added cryztalized giger, but I really do think the molasses taste was too overpowering. May just be my sugar, and my mistake, but I would definintely dilute the molasses next time. Tasted more like a dense plum pudding than gingerbread to me.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, and the presentation was lovely. We couldn't really taste the pears. Perhaps it was the type or ripeness of the pears I used. Might try it with apples next time.

Rating: 3
OK, Well, this is not so much a review, but more like how I made this my own. I liked the idea, but didn't have any pears, only apples, so I carmelized the apples in a cast-iron skillet and added cinnamon, ground ginger and fresh ginger to the butter/ sugar mixture, then decided to really spice things up and added about 1/2 a shot of dark rum too. I liked the reviews better for "old fashioned gingerbread" on this site, so I used that recipe instead (also added some rum and about twice the spices) I served with vanilla ice cream, but would probably do an apple cinnamon whipped cream next time. Make sure you don't overcook the cake, mine came out very dense and moist.

Rating: 3
Very nice. The only modification I made was to cut the molasses to 3/4 cup - the cake was still extremely moist. Next time I will add more pears and slice them thinner than the specified 1/8 pear size, and add more ginger. Vanilla ice cream or whipped heavy cream is a must with this, served warm.

I thought this was an absoluely fantatic dessert. I made it for dinner party of 8 and there was none leftover!

This is one of the most lovely gingerbread cakes I've made, and it was very easy. (Somehow, I managed to make a huge mess of the kitchen, though.) It reheated well, which was necessary, as no gingerbread cake is as good without ice cream melted on it!

Maybe I should only give this recipe one star, but I did love it. I bought a 10" cast-iron skillet for this recipe, because I felt that my 12" skillet would be too unwieldy. The 10" skillet was much too small, so I made a couple small cakes, too. I will be making it again using a larger pan, because it's the perfect fall dessert. I'll also use a spatter screen when I melt the butter. It does make a mess as the water from the butter evaporates.

I made this cake for dinner at my co-op, and it was a huge hit. People have asked for the recipe to be part of our basic collection. I have to satisfy people that were allergic to milk, chocolate, citrus, etc., so this cake was ideal. Preparation isn't the absolute simplest thing, but the step I was worried about -- turning the cake right side up -- turned out to be easy. I followed the recipe straight out, incidentally. I'm making it today for a friend's birthday.

My kitchen was a disaster after making this. Too many steps and the end results were just so-so. Granted I did not have a cast iron skillet but I used an 11 inch cheese cake pan with the bottom lined with parchment paper. There was not sauce at the top (bottom) of the cake and the gingerbread cake mixture was just so-so. I'm not a baker (more of a cook) so maybe that is my problem.

This would be four forks, except I cheated! I needed a nice dessert in a hurry, had the pears by chance, and a box of Hodgson Mills' gingerbread mix. Used crushed demerara cubes to saute the pears (couldn't find my brown sugar - we'd just moved). Cake unmolded perfectly, tasted fabulous, and kept surprisingly well. Kids who normally wouldn't eat anything non-chocolate gobbled it down, and impressed the heck out of my guests (just don't tell them it was a mix!)

I didn't care about presentation, and lacking any suitable pans, I made it in an ordinary 8x13. Baked for 35 minutes it was DELISH! Didn't bother turning it out.

I have never made gingerbread cake before, the texture & taste are amazing even without the pear & sugar.

I agree with the cook who said it was gummy and the pears didn't match the gingerbread particularly well.

I keep thinking I must have done something wrong...my cake rose, looked beautiful, and the *topping* was delicious. The cake, however, had the chemical taste of baking soda -- when I added only the suggested amount. I am confused by this -- it smelled good in the oven, but I ended up picking the pears out of the top and tossing most of the cake. Very disappointing.

Rating: 1
I've had wonderful results with most Epicurious recipies, but this one was a huge disappointment. The cake had an unpleasant gummy consistency and the flavor of the caramelized pears and cake didn't meld. Only one of my four dinner guests cleaned their plate, not a good sign. Next time I'm looking for a showstopper winter dessert, I'll opt for a tarte tatin instead.

Made a huge mess, and it was still a BIG thumbs up! Made the caramel in a pan, transfered it into a cake pan and layered in the pears. Used a 8X3 thinking how cute and tall the finished product would be. Didn't adjust for the baking time, took it out a 45 min. when my cake tester came out clean. As I was flipping it over, the center collapsed and oozed liquid cake all over the plate, table and a chair. =! Undaunted, I took a spatula and haphazardly put everything back into the pan and continued baking. Took it out 15? 20? mins later (I happened to be in the midst of frying chicken) and unmolded it again. The cake was lopsided, had a huge crack on one side and the pears were every which way. In other words, there was no reason for me to wait for guests before sampling. Mmmm... mmm... Soft, moist, rich, spicy and scrumptious. Will serve it cut up in dessert bowls with Haagen Daz vanilla on top. Heaven.

Let me just say this; STOP what you're doing and run out and get some nice firm pears to make this dessert! Could hardly wait for it to be cool enough to unmold! I used a 1/4 cup butter on the "topping", but I could have used it all - that way you get more goo to ooze down!! I sliced a vanilla bean in half and added it to the pears as they were cooking (don't forget to take it out!) I was thinking a dash of cognac or Southern Comfort would be nice when you're cooking the pears too! I also put a dash more spices (love 'em) Watch your baking time; you may not need 40 minutes!

I've made this twice but using the Cooking Light version, which is practically identical except for the amount of butter. It's turned out great both times. It's a perfect way to use up pears and you definitely don't need a skillet to make it. I use a pie dish and it works just fine. Delicious!

Rating: 3
I've made this 3-4 times and always to great raves. Four notes: I cut back on butter; picking perfectly ripe yet firm pears is a must; even slicing and careful arranging of pears is well worth the time; I use a lined 9 x 2" cake pan to both keep my iron skillet for savory use and in this case the straight side is a better presentation.

Outstanding. So easy to do. My boyfriend practically weeped on tasting it. And he's French, so this means a lot!! He couldn't wait for the door to close on our dinner guests before reaching for another big slab.

Outstanding and simple. I cut the butter in this recipe by about 40% (in both parts) with no substitution, and it was great. It did seem to cook slightly fast (30 min. was almost too much), possibly as a result? The only problem I had (presumably unrelated) was that it rose a lot more in the center than at the sides, so that when I inverted it a gaping crevice opened in the center.

This recipe is easy and delicious - I sprinkled a little candied ginger over the pears, but it would be just as good without it. A great winter dessert!

This turned out very well. Excellent gingerbread flavour and not at all dense in texture. I followed the recipe exactly with no substitutions. I was a little worried that the cake wouldn't rise sufficiently when I poured the batter into the 10-in skillet because it was nearly to the top. However, it rose to about another 3/4 inch above the rim of the skillet. I love the flavours of both gingerbread cake and baked pears, so this cake really hit the spot, especially served with creme fraiche. It definitely met my expectations.
