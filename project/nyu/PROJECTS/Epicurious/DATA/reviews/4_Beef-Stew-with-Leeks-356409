This came out well... but one major question. The recipe says to cook all the veggies and meat and then to deglaze the pan. Now normally, you take everything out before you deglaze a pan, but reading this recipe, it never says to do that. Is that what everyone else did? I didn't and it was okay, but there was way too much liquid.

Delicious! Cinnamon and orange zest make a difference. I used 1 cinnamon stick and didn't add salt for the second time. Served with mashed potatoes and salad. Pared with dry red wine. Worth 2 hrs of cooking!

Very good and flavorful. Agree with others - double the veggies unless you a complete carnivore

Wow! Made this tonight, and I must say it is the best beef stew I have ever made. I made it exactly by the recipe, and would recommend doing this per the recipe-do not use a broth of any kind unless you plan to leave out the salt or you will ruin the dish. The amount of salt called for in the recipe is on the edge of what is too salty for my taste, but it is saved by the fresh parsley and orange zest garnish. I will definitely be making this again and again, and the only change I will make is to cut back slightly on the salt. This is not a recipe to make if you are missing any of the ingredients-it's success depends on having the right blend and freshness of flavor. This should warm up many a cold winter's night to come.

Wow, this was good. I usually start by making the recipe as written , but this time, since I was doubling it, felt a couple of small adjustments were a good idea: First, half the cinnamon sticks. Second, used some stock instead of the water. The results were excellent. Next time, I think I'll use a bit less vinegar; don't get me wrong: you DO NOT taste the vinegar when all is said and done, but there is a bit of sharpness we'd rather be less. I did not feel adding more wine or veg was necessary; the taste was an overall success. Using half of the cinnamon (for a double recipe, remember) gave the stew a subtle taste of cinnamon which we thought was a home run.

I made mine a bit too salty so in seasoning the beef be generous, but not THAT generous with the kosher salt. Otherwise, exceptional. I kept on a very low simmer all day. Beef was tender. Flavors meld well together. Followed recipe exactly.

Stew was good - the orange and cinnamon lend nice aromas. Double vegetables as suggested and more wine - would add even more vegetables. Think I needed to simmer it longer as beef was still chewy. Will use blade roast instead of just "stewing beef" next time. Like the idea of braising in oven.

I served this to a crowd of people last week and it was a unanimous hit! Even those who don't usually eat seconds had some (one person even had a third serving), and they were still talking about it two days later. The recipe double easily. Because none of us are a fan of stews served over something else (potato, rice, noodles), I put small red potatoes in the stew, used beef broth instead of water, and then added about a 1/3rd of a bottle of red wine so that there would be a little more liquid in the stew. I also cut the veggies larger so that they wouldn't disintegrate into the liquid. I will admit I was a bit sceptical about the cinnamon, but it absolutely made the stew. Like others, I also doubled the herbs. This stew was so unique an flavourful, particularly with the orange zest! I will be making this stew again and again.

I've made this a couple times now and its a HUGE hit with the family. I followed some hints from other reviewers and also tried a few of my own. My changes include: a) doubling the carrots and celery and adding 2 parsnips and 3/4 C baby bella mushrooms, b) increasing the wine to ~ 1 cup, c) tying up the sage, rosemary and thyme in cheesecloth to eliminate the leaves falling off the stems into the stew, d) substituting 1 cup of beef broth for one of the cups of water e) using 1 tsp of salt. I let it cook about 1 1/2 - 2 hours and serve over egg noodles. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe! After reading all the reviews, I decided to halve the salt (which I think was a smart idea). With orzo, it was a really good meal on a snowy evening.

I would have given this 3.5 forks, however, the site doesn't seem to let you do this anymore. It was yummy! I doubled the vegetables and was happy I did. I followed the directions through to reducing the red wine/vinegar mixture. Instead of simmering on the stove I popped the dutch oven into a 300 degree oven and let it braise for about 2 hours. I just realized that we forgot the zest and I can imagine it would have been tasty.

This is very good... true, it definitely doesn't leave any salt to be desired, but I did not find it overly salty. I tried making it with Guinness in place of red wine and it was really very tasty, served over quinoa.

Watch the salt. This smelled wonderful but in following the directions exactly, I ended up w/ a pot of salty stew. Maybe it is just my taste, but be careful.

Mmmmmmmm, delish! Such pleasant and interesting flavors for stew. I let it simmer for an additional 30 minutes. Beef was tender. Leeks are something pretty new to me and I liked them a LOT. Can't wait to eat it again tomorrow for lunch at work.

Excellent. Halved for two over mashed. Just a little grating of zest over each bowl to brighten, and don't skip the cinnimon. There's nothing like a long, slow, sexy, stew. Yum.

Was very good. It didn't say how much orange zest so I used a whole medium orange's worth, and I think I'd use a little less next time, maybe only half an orange's worth, but it depends on your taste. Some people were weirded out by the cinnamon, but if you note that it's mediterranean/greek, it makes sense. If you want a run of the mill stew, use a plain stew recipe. This is like what you'd get at a greek restaurant. If you don't have cinnamon sticks and need to substitute ground cinnamon, try just 1/4 tsp to start, after cooking for awhile you can add more if you wish, but it's rather hard to take ground cinnamon out once it's in.

The orange zest at the end really tied it all together. Used all the herbs called for, went light on the (ground) cinnamon. Was a hit with the fiance. Took the reviewers' advice and finished it off in the oven for 3 hours. Although there was enough for 3 or 4 people, we ate it all!

I try to only eat organic foods so I purchased a grass-fed bottom round roast that I cubed myself. All fresh herbs were purchased as well. Unfortunately for me the taste of the sauce just didn't do it for me. I choked it down over the course of 3 or 4 days only because I didn't want to waste it. For now I'm blaming the cinnamon as the beef was extremely tender.

This beef stew has such a great blend of flavors. We loved the cinnamon flavor. The top blade roast we used for the stew was so tender and melted in our mouths.

Outstanding. The orange zest is a wonderful brightener, and the spices and herbs are ideal. However: first time I made this, I braised the dish for nearly three hours, let it sit (dinner was hours away) and then re- heated and zested. The meat was buttery soft and falling apart, yet thickly glazed with that rich sauce. The second time, I served it right away (no sitting or reheating). Now we all know braises like this tend to taste better on re-heating. But the consistency of the meat was also very different. In short, the first approach worked better, making for a much more tender braise as well as better flavor.

Best stew we've ever had! House smelled wonderful and it was so easy. Didn't have celery, sage or fresh cinnamon sticks but I can't imagine it being better. I used 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon instead and it was fine. Started it on the stove and finished it for 3 hours at 300 in the oven. Only thing I added was large chunks of red potatoes in the last 90 minutes (can't imagine stew without them) and it was delicious! The grated orange zest at the end was the icing on the cake. Everyone loved the slight hint of orange zest - definitely the icing on the cake!

Delicious recipe!!! I experienced a new flavor for stewed meat, the cinnamon and the orange zest add an amazing taste, I would definitely make this one again :)

I cooked this recipe as written with a few alterations - I substituted the sage for dried oregano, added bell pepper and some red pepper flakes, and added an extra half leek and carrot. This recipe will not yield the traditional savory, meaty broth you might be used to. Instead, the herbs and wine are the stars in the sauce. It is fruity and not too heavy. This stew is great served over egg noodles or accompanied with roasted potatoes you can make with the leftover fresh herbs. It's a nice change from other beef stew recipes as its flavor notes are more complex than just "meat and potatoes." A few days after trying this recipe, my family demanded I make it again - this time doubled for extra leftovers!

Sorry, I could see that this recipe has tons of potential but mine was WAY too salty. Not sure what went wrong. I think I will try it again, but without TWO teaspoons of salt.

I used beef broth instead of water when I made this for the first time and it turned out really well. Next time, I will use 3 leeks instead of 1 and tie my herbs together or put them in cheese cloth because them stems did get in the way every now and then. Really, the dish is very, very good.

Sublime. I made this for friends on a frigid December evening and it was perfect. I doubled the veggies and herbs, used grass-fed beef, and instead of simmering it on top of the stove I cooked it covered in a 375 degree over for about two hours (I was using the oven for other things, so it was efficient); I reduced the liquid for about 20 minutes when it came out. The flavors were amazing--complex, a little fruity and sweet, rich. The meat was so tender but not falling apart. I served over egg fettucini with roast slices of Hubbard squash, a salad of greens, roast beets, and goat cheese, and crusty bread. Awesome winter meal, plates all wiped clean.

I followed this recipe exactly - minus (unfortunately for me!) the cinnamon (hubby won't eat cinnamon) - so I 'compromised' by replacing about 1 cup of the water with beef stock. I used a Chilean cabernet sauvignon (a pleasantly well-balanced one, with a bit of spicy bite to it) and the meat turned out full-flavoured and extremely good. I wasn't sure exactly how small to chop the veggies (in the picture, you don't see 'chunks' of veggies) so I chose to work with a medium dice. Turned out to be the right choice, as the veggies kind of meld into the sauce, creating a rich, thick gravy. I served it with a potato purée mixed with a bit of sour cream and feta cheese, Thomas Keller's Leek Bread Pudding (also part of this article; recipe on this site), and some roasted grapes (red, green and blue varieties) with halved shallots and thyme. A very memorable meal!
