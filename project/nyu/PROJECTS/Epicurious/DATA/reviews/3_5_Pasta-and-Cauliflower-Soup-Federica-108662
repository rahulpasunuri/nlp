Very good, very simple, very quick! I added broccoli and a bit of onion and garlic, used orzo instead for the pasta. It was divine! I will make this again.

I made this when my boyfriend was sick, as I figured it would be easy for him to eat, but tasty enough to please me, too. It was fine, but really not great. Even though I used my good homemade chicken stock, and even though we are both cauliflower lovers, we found it too boring, even for a sick person. I made 2/3 of the recipe but increased the pasta to 1/2 lb, so it ended up more like a stew than a soup. I'd probably stick to the original proportions next time, but I don't really see myself making this again.

Good food doesn't get simpler than this. I completely forgot the olive oil and only had Asiago cheese but it was still totally delicious. I will make this again and again for a quick supper or side.

Really good. I made it with orzo instead of broken spaghetti.

This is a lovely soup. I used veggie stock since I don't eat meat and I also added some sauteed (almost browned) garlic. It is lovely! Eating it now!

Surprisingly delicious, simple soup. We had only half of the Romanesco cauliflower required, so we added broccoli for the other half. The recipe came out tasty, topped with curls of parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.

Echoing the previous review, this is a quick and easy recipe for a sick day. I used organic stock and broth from Trader Joe's, whole wheat pasta and regular cauliflower and it came out delicious.

Easy and quick. Just what the doctor ordered for a sick day at home. This is a keeper.

I am usually a really big fan of simplistic, peasanty italian dishes like this. And a culiflower lover but I wasn't so keen on this result, it seemed a bit bland & 'mealy'
