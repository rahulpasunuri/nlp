This dessert was a hit at our dinner party last night! It's a bit involved, but the presentation is so pretty that it's worth it. I had a couple of false starts (tried parchment paper like some reviewers suggested,but it stuck to cookies) and had to double the recipe to get six cookies on the sheet, but ultimately succeeded in getting them out of the oven and onto a custard dish mold in time. I used blueberries and lemon sorbet - which were perfect compliments to the ginger syrup. What a refreshing dessert!

I loved the presentation of this flavorful dessert! I had a couple of false starts (first tried baking the cookies on parchment as some reviewers suggested, but it stuck to cookies), but ultimately was able to get the cookies onto a custard dish for the mold. I only had one dish so I ended up using a little bowl that didn't work so well. I recommend having more than one mold at the ready. I used blueberries and lemon sorbet for the filling, which are delicious compliments to the ginger syrup! I would definetely make this again.

This was exceptional! What a delightful balance of flavors. I too used regular molasses and baked the cookies on parchment (pencil drawn circles on the opposite side of the parchment made sizing the cookies very easy and consistent). For the lemon sorbet, try the lemon- buttermilk sorbet from epicurious. It's outstanding.

This dessert has been a hit any time I've served it. I have never found light molasses so have just used the regular stuff and it worked out fine. I always have to make twice as much cookie batter though because I inevitable mangle the first ones.

The best cookie baskets I have made them several times. The kids love them too.

Not sure what happened but the cookies were a total mess. I couldn't find LIGHT unsulfured molasses so I used dark. A level tablespoon of cookie batter was nowhere near enough to make a 4 1/2 inch circle so I used about 2 tablespoons. Baked until I thought everything was cooked but the cookies remained limp even after weveral hours. Any ideas?

The delicious flavors combined with the elegant presentation made this a hit at my dinner party. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and used a spatula to help lift them. An outstanding finale!

A wonderful easy and elegant dish. I've used raspberry sorbey in addition to the lemon with wonderful results as well.

What a beautiful and EASY dessert to make. The flavors are wonderfully balanced and fresh. Your guests will be impressed. I also used my Silpat with the cookies and they were very easy to remove and mold. Just don't forget to throw in a sprig of fresh mint for a perfect last minute garnish.

Strongly recommend baking the cookies on a silpat which makes removal much easier. Also used blueberries which had been frozen after picking. After making the ginger syrup, simply stirred in the frozen berries and served over the sorbet. A stellar combination.

This was the perfect summer dessert. I will definitely make it again. The cups were very easy to make and were very beautiful. We made our own lemon sorbet. It was a wonderful combination of flavors and textures.

I just loved this dessert. The cookie baskets are terrific (and quick and easy to make ahead)and the ginger syrup is wonderful. Very gingery and tart with the sorbet, but we had it after a rich cheese course and it was just perfect. I used only blueberries, and the presentation was gorgeous. Yum!!!
