OK I forgot to add the lemon but even for a beet & lemon lover, this soup was mildly disgusting. Obviously, my personal taste but I think my favourite way of having beets are raw and grated with grated raw carrot and a lemon vinegrette. Lots of lemon. Anyway, maybe this soup is for some. Not me. Yack.

I was looking for a recipe to use 2 boiled beets. I added a can of Chicken w/ rice soup to the "beet water." Then I blended the beets with a little water. I sauteed 1/2 onion with a clove of garlic and doubled the lemon. Simple, healthy and tasty. And very easy!

For a beet-lover, this was very tasty, light and easy, and a great use for leftover roasted beets! I used vegetable broth, seasoned with dill, and added a dash of red wine vinegar.
