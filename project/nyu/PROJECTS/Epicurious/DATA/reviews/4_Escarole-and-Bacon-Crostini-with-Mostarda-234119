I was looking for something different to do with some escarole that I had gotten from a local farm. Thought this looked interesting and wanted to give it a try. I didn't have the cheese or the mostarda so I made some substitutions. Used Boursin Cheese spread and Dalmatia orange Fig Spread. Spread these on the bread first then added the escarole. Yummy

My younger sister, 14 yrs old next month, ate her serving of crostini! She is a very picky eater, who is more than content with just a cheese pizza. If she ate this- and with out a fuss- it must deserve four forks! I substituted fresh local mozzarella and a chutney mixed with a dash of honey for the mostarda. It was excellent!

Searched high and low for mostarda but could not find it. Proceeded anyway, substituting guiancale for the bacon. Luckily, I stole one from the tray before I put them out because they all disappeared in the two minutes between dropping them off and returning with a second tray of appetizers.
