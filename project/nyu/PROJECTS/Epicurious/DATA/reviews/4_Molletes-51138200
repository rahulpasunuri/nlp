We are ex-pats living in Mexico. Where we live molletes are a regular breakfast item, made almost exactly like this recipe. Filling, nutritious and delicious.

My household is 50% Mexican and we have molletes at least once every 1-2 weeks as a quick weeknight dinner. We have made them according to the recipe w/black beans, but more frequently w/refried pinto beans and mozzarella cheese. We also tend to sub mayo for the butter. One note - the recipe probably intended that the molletes be toasted cut-side up...
