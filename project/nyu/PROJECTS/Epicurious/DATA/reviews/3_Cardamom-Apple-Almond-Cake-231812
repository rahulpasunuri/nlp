Brilliant Recipe! I loved making this for passover, It will defiantly be my new go to desert recipe for passover every year. It is so moist and flavorful, I highly recommend it. (I opted to use fuji apples over granny smith and I used regular powdered sugar over the potato starch.)

Light and moist and wonderful. Also works well as cupcakes. One of my passover must-haves. I never use matzoh meal to dust pan -- prefer matzoh cake meal.

I enjoyed this recipe and found it moist (I believe we can thank the apples for that...). I agree with a previous responder that the flavors were enhanced overnight. The cardamom was prominent when it was baking and made the house smell delicious, but when I make it again I'm going to add maybe another 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground cardamom for a more pronounced flavor or take Singapore's advice and use the whole pods freshly ground.

I cook for passover with my aunt and she likes to bake in advance and freeze. It worked well (it didn't dry out) and was enjoyed by the family.

I made this for the Passover seder (several times; I kept hoping it would come out better) and was disappointed. Had a nice texture although there was no detectable taste of cardamom. I even bought cardamom pods and ground them, hoping that the fresher the spice was, the more likely it would be fragrant. Did, however, learn that it doesn't pay to be impatient with letting eggs come to room temperature; at room temp, egg whites whipped up nearly three times as much as cold whites.

Not a big fan. Made this for the first seder and followed recipe exactly. It was too eggy for my taste and did not go over well. Not one of the better Passover desserts.

This cake was excellent, moist and flavourful. I made it not because I needed a Kosher recipe but because it was for somebody who is lactose intolerant. Am not familiar with Matzo meal and leave in Asia so I substituted with bread crumbs. I used fresh cardamon (8 pods) which I ground together with the almonds and bread crumbs. Always, always use whole dry spices and grind them yourself when you need them. When ground they loose their flavour very quickly, so ground spices in a jar basically have no flavour in comparison!

Actually baking powder is not restricted on Passover. The restriction is on uncooked flour mixed with water that is not completely cooked within 18 minutes.

I don't understand the previous reviewers' comments at all. "Fat-less"? It has 5 whole eggs. "Hard meringue"? The egg whites are beaten and then folded into the batter to leaven it instead of baking powder, which cannot be used during Passover. Did the previous reviewer bake them separately? What recipe were they looking at? It seems clear that both the previous reviewers have no idea of what Passover is and its many food restrictions. To me, this recipe is a lot better than some of the leaden things I've been served at seders past!

Since I was not making this to be kosher for Passover I used cornstarch and powdered sugar because it was handy. Also, to make completely fat free I substituted 1/2 cup of egg substitute for the egg yolks and then used 5 egg whites. Dense with wonderful cardamom flavor. Great with a little whipped heavy cream or a bit of cheese if not keeping kosher. Good accompanied with a little applesauce. WOuld also be delicious made with figs instead of apples.

Was intrigued by a fat-less cake, hadn't used matzoh meal before. But: taste was off a bit, at minimum unusual, think perhaps from hard sweetness of meringue? Disliked enough to leave out overnight uncovered and admittedly, cake improved by next day. Perhaps it's an acquired taste?

For me, this was o.k. The cake came out good, but I am not used to using eggs instead of baking powder. I thought the cake would be eggy, but no it was not.
