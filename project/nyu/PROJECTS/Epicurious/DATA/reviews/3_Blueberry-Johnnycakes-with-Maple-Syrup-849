"Johnnycake" is a misnomer here - the recipe is for cornbread, not griddle cakes. That said, it's a very tasty cornbread. A bit cornier and less sweet than my usual recipe, but this is a good thing! The addition of fruit is essential to counteract the slight dryness from the cornmeal. I used fresh raspberries, which was absolutely delicious. By the way, the recipe halves easily - just use 2 eggs rather than trying to split one in half.

This is a good brunch recipe. I used half the butter and added applesauce for the other 1/4 cup of butter. Also, I used 6 egg whites in place of the whole eggs and had outstanding results.

I've been making this dish for breakfast since it was first published in Bon Appetit. It's a lovely quick breakfast that everyone enjoys. I usually use half whole wheat flour and reduce the fat by cutting the butter in half and adding some non-fat yogurt - the result is even more moist, though it takes a little longer to bake.
