I thought the idea of a fennel sauce was terrific ... sadly the fennel taste was too mild! It needs anise added to it. I don't think I'll keep this in my collection.

I found this recipe to be very good. The only big changes I made was to use more tomatoes and only half the amount of fennel that the recipe called for. I also chopped it up before roasting to speed things up as another reviewer had done. I noticed some of the other reviewers complained that the fennel taste was too strong. We did not find that to be the case - perhaps the other reviewers would have liked it better had they also halved the amount of fennel. I also used more tomatoes than called for - only one 14 oz can of the diced Italian style tomatoes and substituted for the second - a 28 oz can of Progresso whole peeled tomatoes w/ basil - chopped before being added to the sauce. All in all, it made for a pretty yummy quick & easy dinner.

The garlic and tomato sauce doesn't complement the fennel at all. It completely overtakes its flavor. Strangely enough, I heated this up the next day in the microwave and the fennel did have a stronger flavor then, although it still tasted strange with the tomatoes. I wish I had stopped after roasting the fennel and just eaten it then! (By itself it was delicious!) The consistency of the sauce doesn't stick to the pasta very well either. If you are ever out of your mind enough to make this, I would suggest using a smaller pasta like rotini.

This is a wonderful recipe, with good quality canned tomatoes (I like Muir Glen)or fresh, when paste tomatoes are in season. I cut the fennel into smaller pieces, quarters or eighths, for shorter roasting time, and more carmelized edges. This timesaver almost shortens the prep time enough for a harried weeknight.

This was a fun way to use fennel, but I felt like the tomato sauce really overwhelmed the delicate fennel taste. I would only make it again if I used fresh tomatoes. Next time I would add the pasta to the roasting pan, and coat it with the good fennel-oil mixture, and then add some light fresh tomatoe sauce to the mix.

Very good. But I just brushed the fennel w/olive oil before roasting,which took longer, and used aboaut 3TBL olive oil to saute onions. I never use sugar in my sauce, but once I added it, it brought out the sweetness of the fennel.
