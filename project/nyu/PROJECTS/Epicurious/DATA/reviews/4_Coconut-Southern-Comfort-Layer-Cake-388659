This cake is outstanding. I made it for Easter and it was a perfect finish to a great meal. I followed the recipe in its exact form; the only thing different was that I only have three 9" cake pans so it was a 6-layer cake, and it was perfect. The layers must be pretty thin with four cake pans. The thickness of these layers was perfect. Everyone loved this cake. It's been added to my list of keepers.

Cake was too dense and heavy. I had to only use ONE layer of this cake and combine it with 3 other layers of regular vanilla cake. This cake does NOT give you 4 cake pans worth of cake. if you did put it in cake pans, you would only end up with one cup of batter in each pan which is nothing since you have to slice the top and bottom off for cake levels. Bake it in two pans and then slice. I used coconut milk instead of oil for more flavour and glad i did since it was already too greasy without the coconut oil.

I made this cake for my son's birthday and followed the recipe as written except instead of using 4 9" pans I used the 3 8" pans I had. Then I was able to try out a new cake slicing tool from Germany I'd found at Home Goods to slice the layers. It has a metal frame with an adjustable wire that allows you to easily make perfect even slices. I also used a trick from a pie recipe with a crumbly crust that suggested using the bottom of an 11" tart pan to move the crust from the board to the pie pan. It also worked wonders for dealing with the cake layers. You just slide the metal insert under the cut layers and move them where you need them without breaking them. The Southern Comfort added an interesting flavor that everyone loved but couldn't identify until I told them what it was. My son is still talking about how good this cake was. It was work but definitely worth it.

This cake is da bomb. I made it for Easter. Not only was the presentation absolutely amazing but the taste was out of this world. There a couple of things I would do differently next time though to that would make it easier to make and taste better the next day. Unless you're an advanced pastry chef it's beyond difficult to make 8 layers out of these 4 cakes. The recipe only calls for 2 cups of batter in each tin - thus the tin isn't full - it's literally half - so to basically cut one 9" cake into a 4th is beyond difficult. It's also not really necessary. I made it with the 4 layers and it was just fine. One thing to note tho is the initial moisture of this cake - as there's coconut oil in the cake - it's VERY moist. Unfortunately even with a greased floured non stick pan the first cake crumbled out of the tin - I pieced it together and used it as the bottom layer - no one was the wiser. Once the cakes cooled - it was very difficult to remove them from the plates to arrange them into a cake - next time I would later each plate with wax paper to lift the cake off the plate and layer the cakes. I would not place it on a rack as this would only create lines in the cake as they cooled. Also - I don't know if I'd use Southern Comfort again - I'd try a dark spiced rum. I used a fair amount of SC on the cakes and couldn't taste any flavor. I also would NOT refrigerate the cake when complete. It feels like the coconut oil in the cakes reacted to the coldness of the frig and dried the cake out the next day. The cake was NOT as moist and creamy as it was the first day. It was also hard to arrange the toasted coconut on the frosting when it was cold. Overall the flavor of the cake wasn't the same or as good the next day after having sat in the frig. Next time I'd keep the cake in the microwave (not turned on) to keep the moisture of the cake. Definitely would make again!

This cake was beautiful and delicious. A definite keeper. Served it for Easter. Even those who don't like coconut loved it. I removed it from the oven as soon as I saw the layers pulling away from the sides of the pan. The tops of the cake were just lightly browned. My cake was very moist. I also made it two days before using and I think that letting a cake sit encased in frosting sometimes makes it more moist too. The flaked coconut on the sides gave a nice texture contrast and was so beautiful. I did not cut the layers in half, so mine was "only" four layers. Can't wait to make it again.

This cake was kind of disappointing. I followed the directions as written. As one reviewer mentioned, it was quite dry. It did not have an overpowering coconut taste - in fact, we found it quite tasteless - just thin layers separated by overly sweet frosting. To its credit, it did look beautiful, but that was about it.

I just wanted to give a 'tip' I learned about making the horizontal thin slices, I saw a Chef use 'dental floss' to slice across & make thin layers. It may have been Alton Brown but I'm not sure. I didn't rate this because I havent made this yet, can't wait to!

One of the best cakes we have ever eaten. This is a very special that we will serve for special occasions. Really delicious!

This cake was amazingly delicious and beautiful, but I hesitate to call it "easy." I agree that the layers were a little thin to slice, but it was doable so long as the cakes baked perfectly. 2 of the 4 I baked stuck to the pan a little, which might be avoided either with a non-stick pan or by using wax paper on the bottom. Anyway, it ended up with 6 layers, which was still impressive and tasty. Reducing the number of layers to avoid slicing them would probably make this an easier recipe, but them you couldn't call it a 6 (or 8) layer cake. I skipped the Southern Comfort and never missed it.

This was the best coconut cake I have ever made. So delicious. I too made a 4 layer cake and I baked 2 layers at a time. The cake was moist and the perfect coconut flavor. Many raves and everyone took cake home. Will make this again and again

First off...this is by far the tastiest coconut cake I've ever tasted! But a few observations and a tip. As the recipe was written, the layers were indeed to thin to slice...I was afraid they'd fall apart when picking them up, so like the previous reviewer, I made this a 4 layer cake. Also, with my small, 24" wall oven, baking was uneven. I made a second set of cakes, and only baked two at a time...and a good indication of doneness was when the cake started to pull away from the sides of the pan. The first "test" cakes were a bit dry, so I upped the buttermilk to 1 1/4 cup, for a little extra moisture. My big worry about this recipe would be an overpowering coconut taste, but considering how much coconut there is, the taste is remarkably subtle. And the icing recipe...I can't wait to use it on a chocolate cake, minus the coconut chips. At any rate, the birthday girl was quite happy with her cake, and she got many admiring looks from fellow diners in the restaurant. Highly recommended!

this cake is fantastic and easy! proclaimed by two people at the party as one of the best cakes they have ever eaten. a few notes: i only used three pans and the layers were pretty thin - probably 1/4 inch thick when sliced. can't imagine using 4 pans. also, don't like southern comfort so used rum instead. did not really taste it but didn't really need it either. reduced sugar by 3/4 cup and used sweetened coconut in cake recipe because it was what i had. added a little lemon juice and vanilla to frosting. finally, do not sub shredded coconut for the larger flaked coconut that covers cake. the large, toasted coconut shavings give the cake a fabulous texture.

This cake is delicious! My layers came out pretty flat, could be due to the altitude, so I only made 4 layers. It is beautiful and the Southern Comfort adds a delicious flavor to the cake!
