I made the dough exact to the recipe, it WAS sticky, but still workable, I did not have to add any additional flour. I cut half my dough into little 1 1/2" mini buns, and the rest into 4" normal buns, and added some sesame seeds to the top after the egg wash. They came out soft and delicious, with beautiful golden tops. The 4" buns came out just the right size for me. As another review mentioned, next time I will probably just hand roll them into flattened balls instead of using a biscuit cutter. It would be easier, and they would look better in the end.

Use a bigger biscuit cutter! I halved the recipe and still came out with 16 buns which were better for sliders than burgers. They rose fine and have great flavor, I think they just need to be about 4" around.

These buns turned out to be very delicious. I would recommend that everyone uses something like this for any burger they make. Take further advantage of these, though, with some good burger recipes, like stuff here, or the hamburger recipes I usually use.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the result were buns that were more like dinner rolls. They were very dense, not spongy like hamburger buns should be. That said, they were delicious just as they were, and I will make them again as dinner rolls.

These are so good! They are the best ones I've tried so far. I did have to add 2 cups more flour to get a dough that was still very slack, but just starting to pull away from the bowl. Then it has to be scraped out with a rubber spatula. This dough is very, very wet and sticky, but that's what makes it tender. I also cut my dough up into 24 pieces and rolled into balls instead of hassling with rolling out and cutting. The buns looked better that the ones in the picture. Also, the second rising only took 45 minutes, but it is very hot out today. Additionally, I used 4 teaspoons of yeast.

Update: the baked buns had a nice, light texture and the flavor was good. I ended up getting 30 buns, despite rolling the dough out to 1/2 in. and letting it have a second rise of about an hour. I was content with one bun but some of my family members used 2 due to the size. I tend to prefer a more substantial dough, and to hand-shape the buns. My 2 fork rating is really for ease (or lack!) of preparation. I'm not sure I would make these again. I noticed a version of this recipe appears in the June 2009 issue, with little modification in the liquid:flour ratio. Gourmet: would it be possible to give the weight of flour in a recipe, in addition to the cup quantity? Weight is more accurate and allows for more consistent results; cup measurement technique varies from baker to baker. Thanks!

Although this dough tastes wonderful, the proportions for the recipe are off; there is nearly 3 c. liquid (milk, water, butter, and eggs) to 6. c flour. My dough was like a batter and I ended up adding another cup of whole wheat flour (what I had handy) to the white flour dough and it was still soft but at least kneadable. With the large amount of yeast it should easily double in an hour. There is really no reason to proof the yeast (the first step of mixing it with water) as modern yeast is very reliable, and maybe that is the reason the second rise is low for some bakers...the yeast is exhausted. This recipe may benefit from omitting the proof and from letting the flour and liquids sit for 20 minutes before kneading, which allows the flour to absorb the liquid more evenly. We're rising now and I will have to see how it bakes up.

I've made this recipe twice now. I decreased the sugar quite a bit as the first time around they were too sweet for us. This time it also required quite a bit more flour to come together enough to knead by hand. I substituted 1 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour (perhaps the reason it took so long to absorb the liquid?)without any loss to the lightness. Even with less sugar both the rise and proofing were very fast- -about half the time listed in the recipe. I had no problems with lack of rise. These were perfect with red lentil and rice burgers with tzatiki.

PS I created this in the bread machine. Because of the large amount of yeast, they rise quickly. DEFINITELY keep on eye on them during the rise cycle if you use a bread machine. Also, 2nd rise and baking took shorter amount of time than listed.

A charming recipe that yielded a perfect cocktail-size bun to serve with pulled pork. The dough is quite soft but don't worry about adding flour as you roll. True for me as others, the thickness is critical to success, that is, make sure you keep the buns at least 1/2" when you roll. At first I thought the recipe needed more salt but my topping (pork) was salty enough. If you try to make these as stand-alone bread I would add 1/4t more salt. Very pretty bun, too, with the egg wash with a golden yellow center. A keeper.

Waw perfect! It's like true love! I believe I found the one (in hamburger bun world that is!). I wrote about this recipe on my blog: www.hiddenglasshouse .blogspot.com. Thank you again for sharing this family secret with us!

These are so simple and delicious. They are golden on the outside with a delicate crust and a slightly buttery flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and they baked up perfectly. If you like larger hamburger buns, you may want to use a 3.5" cutter rather than the 3" cutter but the cook time was the same. Used these with the north caroline pulled pork recipe and they were able to stand up the thin bbq sauce and maintain their crust. Delicious!

The buns are as beautiful as they are delicious! I made the dough in the bread machine, but next time I'll stop it 5 minutes before the end as it rose a bit too high and overflowed it. I agree about the thickness. I just made butter and cheese sandwiches with the thinner ones and then ate them all. I love this recipe.

I made these for a big 4th of July cook out and people seemed to really like them and impressed that I made them! The flavor and texture was great....my only complaint was that they were too thin but that was probably my fault for rolling too thin. I definitely recommend these, just don't roll them out too much!

Excellent hamburger buns. When you roll out the dough, make sure it is 1/2 inch or greater in thickness. A couple of my buns are on the thin side.

Great recipe. I even made mine using whole wheat bread flour, and they were still light and fluffy (a miracle using whole wheat in my opinion!) I only let them rise for an hour during the second rise - no need to let them rise more. I kneaded by hand - 8 minutes was all the dough needed. I can also imagine that this recipe would work well for a loaf of sandwich bread. Yum!

Agree with the others about 2nd rise much more minimal than recipe indicates. Regardless, recipe is quite easy to execute and the results are tasty. We also had it with the pulled pork and coleslaw from the June 2008 issue and the whole ensemble ROCKS!

Mine did not raise much in the 2nd rise - next time I'll cut them a little thicker. The flavor was delicious.

Excellent! These really are different than store bought buns. Worth the effort when you have the time and inclination. I made them exactly as written, though both rising times were quite a bit less than indicated. I served them with the Barbecued Pulled Chicken from the Cooks Illustrated website (hope it's okay to mention that here!).

These were fantastic. Dough after first rise was still really sticky but after rolling out on floured surface it was fine. I served these with pulled pork sandwiches and vinegar sauce and they held up beautifully. Well worth the effort.
