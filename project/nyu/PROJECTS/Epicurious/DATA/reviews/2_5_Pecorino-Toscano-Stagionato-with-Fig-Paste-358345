This is great!!!I have figs and dry them myself maybe that makes a difference . My whole family loved it . I canned the paste -we use it with cheese and crackers

Ok. I rarely encounter a failed recipe...seems I can always fix them if they start to go bad. BUT, I really feel stupid over this one; with the famous chef and all, I'm really getting a complex! This was truly terrible. Way too thin - do figs have that different of moisture contents that mine would be so bad? I even dried out the paste further in the oven for a long time. No. Never. Would not recommend. Not even worth adjusting, as I already did that.
