Easy, delicious. Everyone loved it. Smooth and creamy. Will make again.

Mine turned out awesome and it was my first shot at creme brulee (although I'm no stranger to challenging recipes). The only issue I had was that this one comes at as more of a "pumpkin spice latte" than a cappuccino. I'll definitely make it again, but would recommend cutting the cinnamon and sugar, and increasing the powdered espresso for a more sophisticated treat.

Very good. Smooth, creamy and delicious. Easy to prepare. I followed the recipe, but I thought it needed 5 more minutes in the oven. It looked liquid still after 30 minutes. It was softly set at 35 minutes. I used white sugar for the topping, and a blow torch. I'll make it again. My guests loved it.

Bama girl, you are hilarious! Way to have us on. My dilemna, too, is not having the espresso powder. Regular espresso makes it too watery, so I used two shots of espresso and some more, ground for espresso coffee--to sieve out later. We use demerera to brulee, also, but plain white sugar works well for me, too.

well, i dinnit have no cream, so i put milk in, but it was too watery. I put some some marshmallow cream in and it came out just dandy! Next time i think I'll try Cool Whip instead.

Made this for a dinner party and my guests loved it! Great consistency - rich, smooth and creamy. I couldn't find the espresso powder so I used 2 1/2 teaspoons decaf instant coffee. Like another reviewer suggested, I used turbinado sugar (instead of brown) and a blowtorch to finish off the topping. Delicious!

I found this recipe to be quite delicious. I made it with a friend who had never had creme brulee, and was hoping for something that would be quite like what I'd had at restaurants. This fit the bill quite well. My friend also enjoyed it and her 3 sons thought it was absolutely fantastic to watch me use a blow torch in the kitchen.

This was by far the best creme brulee I have ever tasted. It was simply incredible. I'm already making it for the second time in a week.

Excellent flavor. Easy to make. Needed at least 5 more minutes in the oven.

Just wonderful. It was very easy to make. i should have doubled the recipe, they were gone very fast and I did not have enough 2nds

I've always thought that making desserts was a messy project, but not anymore. My guests looked at me as if I had lost my mind when I gathered them for dessert holding a blowtorch in one hand, and the sugarbowl in the other.

Rich, Delicious, Wonderful and Easy to make!! I couldn't find instant expresso powder anywhere so I used about 2 1/2 tsp. of instant coffee. Also, I decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. I thought the flavor was rich and delicious! My guests scraped every bit from the dish! I used shallow creme brulee ramekins and the cooking time of 30 min. was perfect. A very successful dessert that I will definitely repeat.

Again, another great recipe. Try using raw sugar for the topping, it carmalizes much much better, and invest in a small torch. Worth it, so worth it!

This was a very tasty creme brulee. I used white sugar to carmelize on top. (I tried the brown and it caught on fire!) I also used instant coffee and increased the amount a smidge. I did get a bit of overcooked custard on the bottom of my ramekins but I baked for 35 minutes because they didn't look quite set yet. Next time I'll only bake for 30 minutes. Overall a big hit

This was so easy I couldn't believe it, and crowds just ooh! and aah! at the very mention of creme brulee. It did need more time in the oven than the recipe indicated for the custard to set, but who cares. It was great!

This desert is actually very easy to make if you've made custards before. I would suggest to one reviewer who felt it was too much work to simply practice and get a better understanding of custards. I used 1/2 a vanilla bean as opposed to vanilla extract (a pricey substitution from the recipe) but it was delicious no matter! I also used a propane torch to carmelize the sugar. I had to fight my 2 kids & brother just to have 1 serving.

Awesome stuff. Easy to make, nice presentation and absolutely to-die-for delicious. Everyone scraped the last bits out of their bowls.

Very easy and delicious. I would have liked a little more capucinno flavor so next time I will use a little more coffee.

I made this to serve at an Italian dinner. My guests loved it. I will definitely make it again and would not change a thing. They all asked for the recipe. My guests are all excellent cooks and bakers.

Not Worth the Trouble to Make. I made this dish for company and was VERY careful to follow directions, including a thermometer in the oven to regulate temperature. It took far longer to set than the directions indicated. I would have had a tastier dish had I stirred instant expresso into Jello Egg Custard mix and finished it off like creme brulee.
