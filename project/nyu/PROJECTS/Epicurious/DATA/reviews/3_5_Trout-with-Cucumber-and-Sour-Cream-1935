i made this with salmon instead of trout. it was still absolutely delicious. make sure you slice the cucumbers very thin! i am thinking about making some kind of cucumber puree/sauce next time. also considering mixing dill with sour cream and lemon juice.

I took lisamargaret's advice and substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and it came out very well. Preparation is quick and easy. I would definitely make it again.

Fantastic! Great flavors...dont skimp on the dill or the lemon. Simple enough for a weekday dinner too.

So good, so easy. I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (half the fat). The combination of flavors is very good and the presentation is lovely.

this recipe rocks for people interested in cooking outside the box when it comes to fish. you can use tilapia fillets instead of trout. i recommend wrapping them in foil and baking with olive oil and white wine before adding the fish to the cucumbers and sauce.

This is a very nice recipe. However, I was unable to catch trout with 12-14oz fillets...so, I reduced the suggested ingredient amounts. I should have used less lemon peel - that stuff goes a long ways!

This was outstanding for such an easy recipe. I used grilled swordfish, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. A tremendous effect with minimum effort.

Fabulous and extremely easy recipe. The sour cream and cucumbers bring out the taste of the trout without overwhelming it. Would definitely make this again!!

Agree with all the other reviewers. I have made this several times now with steelhead trout and it is very easy and very delicious. A definite keeper.

My husband said this was the best meal he ever had. It was extremely easy to make and elegant to serve. It would be a perfect summer dish but a nice change in the middle of January!

i really loved this easy recipe. i lined the baking sheet with foil and used non-stick spray; although i know it is edible, i choose not to eat the skin, i left it on the foil. i used sour cream, thinned with a dash of milk, but i could see using whole fat plain yogurt for my next attempt, i also plan to add red onion or capers to the cukes, glazed carrots and jasmine rice were my sides.

I made this dish a few nights ago for my wife, brother and dad and they all absolutely loved it, and so did I. I'm just beginning to get into this cooking stuff and this was very simple to make. I used the fat free yogurt as one chef recommended and the sauce was so light and awesome. I used whole trout we caught a couple weeks ago and de-boned (is that a word?)them after backing them and prior to placing the sauce on top. This worked great.

For lighter fair, substitute nonfat yogurt with touch of lemon for sour cream

We loved this recipe. It was simple to make and so tasty. Just beware that the sour cream is a little heavy.
