Pretty good. Taking into account other reviewers suggestions, limited beans to one 18 oz can, used fresh parsley instead of cilantro, it was garlicky--of course with three cloves, but good, will make gain

Delicious! I made it with a mix of canellini and pinto beans, and it was really good. I also made homemade tortilla chips, which really made it awesome.

Unremarkable.

good dip - i agree that you could use slightly less than 3 cans of beans or add more olive oil for creaminess. i had to process fo a long time to get creaminess right. definitely need to add salt esp when using beans with no salt added

I thought this dip was pretty slammin'. But I don't always measure when I cook, so I added lemon and other seasonings until I was happy with it -- I am pretty sure I added a bit more than the recipe calls for.

Sorry, but this dish was boring, true I could have added a bit more salt & pepper for flavor but overall it was just lack luster. My family wouldn't bother with it, so I had to eat most of it myself. Would not make again, I think there is probably a better white been dip out there.

Took previous comments by adding more lemon juice, olive oil and using only 2 cans of beans. Used fresh italian parsley instead of cilantro, also "smashed" garlic with sea salt to create a paste (it blends better). Great combo of flavors. Was a big hit at my party

Just okay, IMO, even with the flavor boosts recommended by other reviewers.

Followed the advice of other reviewers and used two cans of beans only (one of garbanzos, one of cannellinis), and more lemon juice. I cut the garlic back to one small clove, and the dip still had quite a kick. Also, toasted whole cumin, then ground it fresh before adding it. This was perfect for our outdoor summer party, as there was no worry about a dairy-based dip going south and possibly sickening anyone.

Followed the advice of several reviewers and only used 2 cans of beans. Fantastic dip! Great combination of spices - used organic lemons, so we could actually taste the lemon (wasn't overpowered by the spices).

Good base dip - I like that I didn't have to buy tahini. It was awfully thick, though - next time I'll add more lemon juice and olive oil.

This was delicious! I sauted the garlic first in olive oil to reduce the bite of the raw garlic. I served it with thinly sliced french bread toasted with olive oil and everyone loved it.

Almost inedible! I tried it a 2nd time, with the following changes: Reduced the cumin, chili powder and lemon juice by one third. I cooked the minced garlic in corn oil at low-med heat for 1 minute. Added spices and let cool. Added to beans mashed by hand. Result was very different, but pretty tasty.

I've made this for several parties and it always gets rave reviews. A few modifications: only two cans of beans and more of the spices. Goes well with tortilla chips.

I made this for a party this weekend and, of course, made a few modifications. I didn't add the cilantro (not a big fan) and reduced the spices a bit--1 3/4 tsp of cumin and 1 rounded tsp of chili powder. It was deliciously garlicky, but not overwhelming; and the color was beautiful. If you have the patience and don't have a food processor, you can make this in a blender. It takes a bit of attention and stirring, but it's doable. I would definitely make this again and not be afraid to try different variations.

I have made this recipe several times with great success and with compliments from all who taste it. The recipe is fine as is and still deserves three forks, but it's also good with some of the following changes: Use a pinch or two of cayenne pepper in place of the chile powder. Omit the cilantro if you prefer a smooth dip. You can also heat the garlic in a little oil in a saucepan then add the beans and cook until they're warmed through. Then proceed as the recipe indicates. This way you'll have a nice warm dip. I serve this with toasted pita chips as it seems to go well with the beans.

Very good with some changes - more of the spices and only 2 cans of beans. I also used a little less oil.

This dip is just fabulous. I have made it many times with rave reviews. I doubled the garlic last time and months later my co-workers are still talking about how good "that dip" was.

Great do-ahead dip for a party. I make a day ahead of time to give the flavors time to meld. The cilantro goes in right before serving. I made this for a couple gatherings and everyone just loved it.

I've been making this forever. I usually use 1/3 of the beans (one can), 1/3 of olive oil and 1/3 of lemon juice and use the full quantity of cilantro and spices. I serve it with muliti colored tortilla chips and everyone loves it.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and keep returning to it. Everyone likes it and the recipe makes plenty for a crowd. I do put in more cilantro than the recipe calls for, and like that addition.

I thought that this dip had great flavor, but it was way too thick. I tried to thin it out by adding water, but didn't want to dilute the taste. I wouldn't make it again unless i could figure out how to make it less thick. Also, it was better served warm.

It was very good but not quite the hit that the warm crab artichoke recipe from Bon Appetit Nov. 97 issue was. That one went in minutes with fights breaking out who was to wipe the dish clean!

I took this spread to a party and everyone wanted the recipe. It is really, really good!
