oops! Where I wrote "vanilla yogurt" it should have said "vanilla frozen yogurt".

I fried mango slices alongside the pineapple and served it with a spoonful of vanilla yogurt on top of the fruit, and the whole thing drizzled in the sauce. Delicious!

Delish! Followed the recipe as is, but next time, I think I'll make a slurry with the rum & some cornstarch because the recipe as written made one heck of a runny sauce for me.

For presentation, I cut the long strips of pineapple in half again and arranged them as a sunburst, with the walnuts in the center. Also, I crumbled goat cheese on top, which gave the dish some body and was the perfect complement for the pineapple.

An excellent end to a great dinner with a couple friends. Serve this on slices of lemon cake dusted in powdered sugar. Delicious!
