Fabulous! I also subsituted frozen cherries due to seasonality & it was still amazing. So fast - took 10 minutes.

This is amazingly good! We've done a lot of similar recipes that involve wine and lots more sugar, but this simple recipe beats them all. We did use a bit of orange juice instead of lemon, and really enjoyed these cherries on top of the Hawaiian honey ice cream for Haagen Dazs. My fiance, who is not a big fan of cherries, wants to buy another half flat at the farmer's market ASAP so we can make these cherries again!

This is a fabulous topping for a scoop or two of homemade vanilla ice cream. Great contrast of flavors.

I'm not a gourmet cook, but I do entertain a lot and like something different and simple to serve for dessert. This is it. I've served it 4 or 5 times and a big hit. I've decided to go with frozen cherries (much easier) and I add some crushed pecans to top off the ice cream. Serve it immediately as it gets soupy.
