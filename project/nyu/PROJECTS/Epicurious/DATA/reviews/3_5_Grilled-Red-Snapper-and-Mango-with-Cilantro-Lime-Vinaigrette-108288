Delicious! Cooked it just as written. Will definitely make it again.

Beautiful, tasty and so refreshing! I substituted 1/4 teaspoon of ground cumin for the seeds adding it right into the dressing along with a teaspoon of honey since I added a bit too much lime juice and it was perfect. I'll definitely make this again.

Outstanding dish! Grill extra Mangoes because they are delicious. I grilled whole jalepenos with it to add heat. Made really great fish tacos with the leftover fish, mangoes and jalepenos the next day.

First, just a comment, the review 3 below mine "Gourmand from Greenwich".... I can't decide if I think this is a joke or not. I hope it is. While everyone appreciates a suggestion, like "I used ground cumin and it worked just fine", what's the point in reviewing the recipe when you don't use a single component of the original recipe? You can only change a certain amount before it's no longer the same dish. I find this very frustrating when reading reviews. Anyway, this dish was very nice and light for the summer. I marinated the mango and fish in the vinaigrette for a few hours. In my haste I forgot to add the cumin before throwing everything on the grill, but it was good nonetheless. I think it probably kept a more "fresh" kind of taste without the cumin. The vinaigrette is very good but nothing ground- breaking, I think what makes this dish stand out is the grilled mango, which I'll definitely be making again.

Very good and easy. Broiled it. Would suggest using less cumin.

I used Basil instead of Cilantro and Cayenne Pepper instead of Cumin Seeds. I also used Bake then Broil in my oven instead of Grilling the fish. I served it with Spanish Rice as suggested. I turned out to be SO good, that I couldn't believe I actually made it and it wasn't from a five-star restaurant! I will DEFINATELY be making it again!

We used tilapia (a local fish) instead of snapper. Ground cumin worked fine in place of cumin seeds. A very nice, light and healthy dish. Broiling works well if you don't have a grill. Fast, easy and very tasty.

My fiance made this for dinner last night and we both thought that it was excellent (especially for such a quick dish). Can't wait to make it again. I would even make it for company, and that is saying a lot!

I make this all the time for company but in the oven. I often marinate the fish and mango for hours. There are rarely leftovers.

I've made this recipe a number of times and absolutely love it! I have found that marinating the fish for a half hour or so makes it even more flavorful. This is quick, simple, and a winner in my receipe book.

I never would have guessed that mango on the grill would appeal to me, least of all with snapper, but it does now!! This was delicious and easy, done exactly as described. I'd repeat this for company.

I thought this recepie was great. I used Tilapia instead of red snapper and it worked just fine. The Mango grilled better than I expected and the flavor combination is very nice. Its quite and impressive presentation for not too much work. Get everything ready for the grill ahead of time, once everything is on the grill its done fast.

Really tasty and super easy. I served it with some herbed rice. Nice change from burgers and steaks on the grill.

I marinated the swordfish for 1/2 hour before grilling which added flavor. Great dish, served with grilled zucchini which was a nice compliment.

This really would be more logical as a summer recipe, but I had an abundance of fresh mango and was looking for ways to utilize them. This was simple, fresh and delicious. I just used more than the sugggested two lettuce leaves, made a bed of lettuce on each plate before adding the mango and fish and it was a meal in itself.

I have made this recipe 3 times. My husband says it is the best red snapper recipe he has ever had.

Great dish! I used sea bass instead and it was delicious. Try grilling the mango and then mixing it with chopped red onions and more herbs. I served the halibut over mixed green topped with the mango and got great reviews from friends.

This was delicious! I received rave reviews! I used mango and pineapple chunks. I broiled it in the oven because it was a rainy night. Very easy to make. I would follow the recipe exactly and make it again.

Ignore all the PC comments and try this. It's simple to prepare and GOOD. Served it with black beans, yellow rice would also be a good choice.

i tried this recipe with halibut, and forgot the lime peel and cumin - great results! i loved the flavor of the grilled mango. next time i'll make a little more glaze for drizzling at the end, as another cook suggested.

The flavors of this recipe are very interesting. I wasn't too fond of the cumin seed, and would like to try it next time with ground cumin instead. I did take it upon my onis to add some garlic cloves and a touch of nutmeg. I loved how the fish came out and my husband who is super picky told me he liked it, as well.

I made this several times now it's delicious! The last time I could not get firm mangoes, they were all too ripe so I substituted fresh pineapple wedges we liked them even better! I serve the fish with grilled zucchini wedges sprinkled with balsamic vinegar.

My family & I really enjoyed this. I grilled some fresh opah fillets and they turned out very nice. The grilled mangos were unusual and very flavorful. Also grilled some zucchini alongside as the recipe suggests. Makes a wonderful, light, warm summer evening meal.

This is an excellent combination of flavors and very healthy. A lovely summer dinner. I've made it twice and will be making it again for company this week - with snapper although I can imagine it would be wonderful with grouper.

OK- I confess: I made this exactly as written and fear that in doing so, I have contributed to the eventual extinction of CILANTRO. Seriously, guys -while I recognize the importance of being environmentally aware, there are plenty of sites available to keep us in the know. This site is, first and foremost, about food. And, lest we forget, life on this planet began in our oceans and, I suspect, will continue to flourish there long after we go the way of the dinosaur. So - relax, and enjoy your dinner! That being said, I loved this recipe and will most definitely make again - with or without the snapper.

I was very impressed with this dish. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. It was very easy, tasty and different from the usual things that I make on the grill. A delicious, light summer dinner.

Yummy yummy yummy red snapper!! Might as well enjoy it while we can!! Would definitely work with halibut too though....excellent!

This was really great, good flavors, nice complexity. We used halibut; it's not a matter of being politically correct, it's just being environmentally aware. I saw that some people used tilapia. On the grill???? I've never thought that was a good fish for the grill.

We liked this a lot. Easy to make, and a great combination of flavors. Will definitely be making it again.

Political issues aside, I made this with Tillapia because that's what I had in the fridge. It came out delicious. Nice mix of sweet and char (the grill taste). Very easy and quick to make; perfect for summer when it's too hot to spend much time in the kitchen.

This recipe was quick and easy, but delicious. Everyone in the family loved it and put in a request to have it again. My dad said he would pay $65 to eat it in a restaurant(that is how he judges the taste of the food I cook).

Grilling mango sounds great but I, too, will not be making this with red snapper.

I am tired of being bombarded by all this information on safety! Everywhere we turn around we're being told what to do for our own health! By the way, the above entry was tongue-in-cheek. Thank you for the safe food preparation tip, and especially thanks for the information on which fish are overfished. This is a perfectly appropriate forum in which to hear/learn about such an issue when a recipe is involving an endangered species.

The grilled mango in this recipe is TDFW (Too Divine For Words)! We grilled the fish longer than stated. We left the skin on and let it become slightly crispy.Safety hint: save a portion of the sauce before brushing on the raw fish so that you can drizzle on after cooking.

great recipe, but red snapper is seriously endangered in most of the world. try halibut instead. it's got better texture and flavor and is a much more sustainable fishery.

I can't wait to make this dish with grouper (only because we like it better and it's local) and mangoes from our backyard. PC-ness is great, but so is good food...

I looked past all the PC blah,blah & tried this twice. I won't try again- it really was a very bland vinegrette....Even after trying to jazz things up, I didn't like this one.

This dish was absolutely exquisite. We moved to Greece where red snapper is plentiful and it was an exceptional change from the same/ole/same/ole grilled renditon...Thanks for the recipe and the tips from other readers.I am one of these people who reads feedback even if I don't do the politically correct thing... always humors me to see the lengths people go to to be proper???

Have not yet made this recipe but will do so soon *with* the red snapper. To the Cook in Lake Oswego, OR: It is not an issue of being offended by important, helpful or timely information. It is an issue of being bombarded at nearly every turn by "Political Correctness." Food, and the enjoyment of its preparation,is a time-honored pastime. Let people enjoy THAT aspect without ruining it with politics (because it's ALL politics.) Life is too short.

Snapper, mango and cilantro really blend well. I did cheat and add a finely minced scallion to the viaigrette the second time - But I like mango and cilantro with onion, too!

Excellent dish without snapper! And for you environmentally incorrect cooks, remember who was here first. It wasn't you or I.

Excellent, but as others suggested, substitute something for the red snapper (I used halibut). As for Epicurious allowing "political" views (although I believe this is a misnomer -- aren't such views environmental & humane?), it's good to raise awareness whenever and wherever possible. Too bad some people choose to be offended by such information.

Excellent dish. I made it with grouper and my husband loved it. The grilled mango was wonderful. I didn't have any cilantro so I used fresh parsley. I grilled it with a little homemade Mango Jalapeno Jelly. Try it you will like it!

This was excellent. I tried it with Tilapia. Yes, it's true. Chilean Sea Bass and Red Snapper and a great many other fish are being overfished. To find more information about this, look up the Monterey Bay Aquarium website for a list of which fish to avoid, which are OK and which fish you can use to substitute the endangered ones. I thought the mango was good grilled---if you can find the smaller mangos (honey, champagne, Chinese--whatever they're called) try those instead of regular mangos--they're heavenly!.

Actually, red snapper IS overfished and has been for many years. That said - I did make this dish using red snapper (shhh...) and it was delish. I didn't use as much oil and think I would prefer the mango ungrilled. But the vinagrette was good and so was the fish!

To the cook from Tacoma-I think you are thinking of Chilean Sea Bass not Red Snapper.

I haven't made this dish although it looks delicious. Just a reminder, though: red snapper has been extremely overfished and is in danger as a species. Cooks who wish to have red snapper around in the future will chose another suitable fish for this dish such as tilapia or other white fish. Bon Appetite!
