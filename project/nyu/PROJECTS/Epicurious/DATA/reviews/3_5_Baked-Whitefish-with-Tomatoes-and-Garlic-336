I used smoked paprika and subbed chicken stock for water, and it was still too bland. There are some great flavors in this dish, but it would be even better if they were more concentrated, and there doesn't need to be so much liquid. Next time I'll use canned tomatoes and add their juice, and I'll use only a little, if any, stock/water in addition to the tomatoes' juice.

used 1lb. of skinless whitefish fillets and smoked paprika; added some crushed red pepper subbed chicken stock for water; made full sauce and used 3/4; added some sliced leeks to cilantro and tomatoes (heirlooms) served on leek risotto

This was really good. I used swordfish, and chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. I also used way less liquid than the recipe calls for. Yummy and easy!

This is a wonderful, flavorful, and easy to prepare dish. I used tilapia which worked very well. As others advised, I used chicken stock (rather than boullion and water) and used less than was called for...maybe only 1/2 cup or so. I used double the cilantro (because we love it!) and sprinkled the cilantro with a bit of cracked red pepper flakes before layering on the tomatoes. I also covered my dish tightly and cooked in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, uncovering and turning on the broiler for the last minute or two. A little "Tony's Seasoning" at the end gave it the extra little kick I felt it still needed. (hey, I live in Louisiana...we can't live without Tony's!!) Will make this often as everyone who has tried it loves it!

Great. I don't know why this is called "baked" when in fact it is poached or braised...I gave it three forks because there is a layer of flavor missing that I can't figure out, but as printed the recipe is very, very good. Don't skimp on the cilantro and absolutely use chicken broth instead of water and maybe 1/2 tsp of chicken base as well. I only needed about 3/4 c of broth for the fish. This would work with snapper or any mild white fish, and probably with shrimp or boneless chicken breasts as well.

I took everyone's advice; added spices, threw in extra veggies, decreased water (even used stock instead of water+boullion) and this was extremely disappointing in it's blandness. The texture of my whitefish was wonderful though. Why is this called "baked" when really, we're talking steamed to poached?

I was looking for a recipe for Wahoo and I thought this might work but I think the steaks were too thick for any of the flavor to penetrate. I ended up dipping the fish in a side of Kimchee sauce to liven up the blandness. The tomatoes were tasty, I wish I had borrowed another person's suggestion to toss in more veggies, they seem to soak up the flavor better. The dish smells wonderful, so I really had my hopes up. I am sure it would be much better with the fish actually called for in the recipe!

I loved this recipe. I read the reviews before making it so I adlibbed the ingredients a bit for the cooking liquid. I used chicken broth, a little soy sauce, 1 chili pepper, and some lemon grass as well as tai chili sauce, everything else stayed the same. For the fish I used a fish called Basa. I took another tip from one of the recipe reviewers and made sure I didn't cook it too long. It was so good. I'd like to also mention it is perfect for the 1st phase of South Beach...and you will be satisfied!

This is delicious! I added asparagus and used fish stock instead of the chicken-flavored stock. I served it over a creamy risotto rice. Nice!

I followed the advice of including more vegetables and added sliced green and yellow squash, and sliced green onions. Also had capers on hand and threw them in, as well. Cut back to a cup or so of chicken broth, Took about 15 minutes to simmer. Served with cous cous (recipe of toasted pine nuts w/ asparagus and plum tomatoes and parm cheese). Quite delicious! I will make this recipe again.

Very easy, very delicious. The only thing you have to keep in mind is not to overcook the fish - nothing worse than that. I had quite a thin fish, so I reduced the cooking time by about 4 minutes and it came out perfect. This was also the first time I liked fresh cilantro in a recipe.

This recipe was terrific--after I doubled all the spices (but not the oil). I made it in a stockpot, added only a little water, and served it over large-grained couscous. Next time will add more veggies too. It was VERY fast and yummy!

To the cook from Suburbia (if you are still out there) you can use any pot or pan that will accomodate the volume of the ingredients in the recipe and that has a cover, since this recipe does not require the whole thing to be placed in the oven. Dutch ovens have oven-safe heat resistant handles for stews and things that require starting the recipe on the stovetop and then finishing it by slowcooking for hours in the oven. I haven't made this yet but I would just cook it on the stovetop in a large stockpot or skillet with a cover.

I took the other reviews and cut the liquid in half. Even though I used homemade vegetable stock and not water it was still a little bland and it was a bit too liquidy. I baked mine as well. We served it over rice and it was good with the veggies(I added mushrooms). I will try again but next time I will add a bit more spices and less stock if you do bake yours. I highly suggest stock or broth for added flavor. Ethier way it wasn't that bad, just needs some flare.

It was a great, easy way of enjoying mild-tasting whitefish. My kitchen smelled like a Thai restaurant! Very flavorful. It needed salty taste to it though- I added salt, fish sauce and chili sauce. Also added mushrooms for fun. It turned out a little too soupy. Liquid that comes out from veggies needs to be subtracted from water to add. Will make again with these modifications.

Fantastic recipe. I used a whitefish called tilapia, which worked well. I put everything inside heavy foil and put it in the oven at 375 for 20-30 minutes. I served it topped with fresh cilantro and a lemon wedge on the side, accompanied by the RICE WITH PINE NUTS AND CILANTRO, and steamed asparagus.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but I'm dying to try it BUT the last thing I own is a Dutch oven. What can I use as an alternative? Can someone assist please? Thanks.

This was easy, tasted awesome and a great dinner party recipe - one pot and one platter. We added asparagus to the pot and served with Cous Cous...

This fish was an easy and tasty fish dish. My modifications: I added fresh chopped green chilies with the coriander and garlic, and I sprinkled some salt over everything, and I used catfish fillets. I will definitely be making this dish often.

We loved the fresh taste of this recipe! The only thing that I changed was that instead of the chicken granules, I used 1 1/2 cups no fat/low sodium chicken broth (half the liquid recommended). I served it over basmati rice. Delicious!

Delicious dish. My wife loved the flavor of the cilantro combined with the fish. However, the tomatoes did not seem to add much to the dish. Still, a tasty dish which we plan on serving again. I served it on a bed of creamy risotto, with stuffed zuchinni on the side. A nice bottle of Chardonnay completed the meal.

It could have been because I substituted, as one reviewer suggested, arugula for the cilantro, but my husband and I took one bite, tossed the rest and went out for take-out Chinese. We were disappointed as we love all the ingredients, but we felt that all the spices and flavors overpowered each other instead of complimenting leaving a (strange as it sounds) bland flavor overall. Not a keeper for this kitchen.

This one is quite simple but very good. You have to like cilantro, although watercress is another option if you don't care for cilantro. I've made it without the turmeric and it can also be made without the oil if you're REAL particular about fat...but it's obviously extremely lean regardless. I use the full amount of water because I like the broth for the rice I put it over.

This is my favourite quick fish dish. It is so simple (it takes literally minutes), but absolutely DELICIOUS, particularly if you like fresh cilantro. It is imperative to decrease the water by about half (or else it is too watery). Spooning over rice is essential.
