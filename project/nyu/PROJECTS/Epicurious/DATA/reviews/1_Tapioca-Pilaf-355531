I'm Indian, and I recognize this recipe as an attempt at a "gourmet" version of a snack/ light meal popular in Western India. The review below is hilarious, but, I'm thinking, spot on - at least, based on the cooking instructions in the recipe. I think tapioca pearls, even cooked properly, may be an acquired taste for many Western palates. And the method given here is guaranteed to give you a starchy, gloopy mess. The correct way to cook it is to soak the tapioca in water for at least a couple of hours - the way to test if it's ready is to press a grain between thumb and forefinger. When it's ready, it will be soft to the core but not dissolving into mush. Then, when you're ready to cook it, stir-fry over medium-high heat with a little oil and spices until the grain is bouncy and translucent.

One of the worst recipes I've ever seen. This gets you a greasy, gelatinous mass. It looks like an elephant blew its nose into a bowl and then a smaller, different animal vomited in it. Sorry, that was probably too graphic. A very frustrating experience.
