Did a vegan version with organic Lacinato kale over a double boiler. Tasty.

This was not creamy at all... The plain "cremed sinach" recipe on this site is much better, I'll just add the garlic to that one next time.

THis is very good especially if fresh grated parmesan is added

Delicious. I used very scant 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and the flavor still came through well. It's definitely essential to the recipe, but could overwhelm the other flavors easily if you use too much. We served this with the fried potatoes with oregano & parmesan from this site (awesome!) and a fried egg - comfort food reminiscent of a meal I was served years ago when visiting a friend in Germany (but with a touch of mediterranean flavors). Will make again and again.

I left the garlic in and skimped a bit on the nutmeg, since we're usually not fans of this in veggie dishes. However we didn't find it quite creamy enough.

I had spectacular success with this recipe with some revisions to reduce the fat. Brought it to a New Year's Eve Party where it turned out to be the only hot item brought! People spooned it onto their plates next to the potato salad, etc. but some scooped it with bread or raw veges! Anyway, everyone loved it and wanted the recipe...here's what I did: used all 2% milk and no cream at all, (it still comes out very creamy), used only one tablespoon of butter and substituted 3 tablespoons of good olive oil, put the onion in the small bowl of my food processor with 5 large cloves of garlic until they were finely and evenly chopped so there would be no lumps of onion...for the spinach I took my biggest cooking pot, sprayed it Olive Oil Spray, bottom and sides and then, after heating a short time, filled it with the spinach and covered it. THere is plenty of water in spinach to steam itself and since you have to press out the water later it just makes sense. At first the heat was medium high but I lowered it as the pot got hot and the spinach really started wilting. I kept uncovering and stirring the unwilted spinach down (the oiled sides keep the spinach from sticking) and re-covering (and adding any spinach that wouldn't fit in the pot the first time). When all the spinach is wilted put the uncovered pot in the sink filled part with cold water to cool the spinach. While cooling, make the sauce. Put the spinach in a fine gauged colander/sieve and with a wooden spoon press as much water as possible out. Then follow the recipe as written. Last note...the recipe does call for salt and pepper to taste...it's just not listed in the "ingrediants" but it is needed!

Simple and delicious. Only don't be a coward, mince the garlic and leave it in. I think it can take more cream. But boil it down thicker than I did, to compensate that there will be some moisture in the spinach no matter how much you try to press it out.

I made this last night and it was fabulous. I followed the advice of other reviewers and left garlic in, added a tbsp. of low fat sour cream, some shredded parmesan and used half and half instead of heavy cream. My husband raved.

This was so delicious! My husband said that he could eat the entire bowl of it. I did make a few minor adjustments to the recipe. Instead of keeping the garlic whole and taking it out at the end, I minced it and kept it in. I also added a tablespoon or two of sour cream and a few tablespoons of parmesan cheese. It ended up like an alfredo sauce with spinach in it. I also used frozen spinach and it came out perfect. When I served it, I sprinkled some crumbled bacon on top and it was wonderful.

Not quite as good as Peter Luger...but then who is? I upped the amount on this and used frozen spinach. Ended up using 1 cup of cream (27%), 1100grams (about 2.5 pounds) frozen spinach, 4 crushed garlic cloves that I left in, salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Super simple and really tasty!

It was quick and easy, but nothing special. I love creamed spinach, but this does nothing for me.

a good easy spinach recipe

try simply microwaving the baby spinach for a minute or so(depending on your microwave)and add to cream. there is never a need to boil baby spinach. you could probably add it directly to the sauce and sautee very gently for a minute or so and have it turn out fine.

As some others had done, I left the garlic in and the flavor was great. Next time I will only blanch spinach... not so wilty. Overall good, but still didn't win over my husband the spinach hater.

I love spinach, but this was a hit even with the kids at our dinner party!

Julie, have you ever cooked anything before reading this recipe?

Rating: 0
Julie..the water is the amount you use to cook the spinach before draining and adding the cream.

Rating: 0
i'm a little confused: what do you do with the 1/4 c. of water? does that go with the cream, garlic, etc? sorry for the lame question.

I liked this recipe, except I'd chop the spinach after draining it. I might try it with frozen spinach next time.

This was delicious, and the garlic made it so much more interesting than regular creamed spinach. I tried to make enough for 4 but you know how little spinach you end up getting from a huge bag...so I ended up making more of the cream sauce and adding a cup and a half of corn. it turned out great!

I made it with frozen spinach. It was pretty good although i couldn't really taste the garlic when i made it the way the recipe says. next time im just gonna chop up the garlic and throw it in.

I blanched the spinach to keep it nice and green, and didn't discard the garlic. Turned out great.

A tasty version of an old favorite. Yes, it does take all that spinach for one serving.
