I love the Dona Maria mole - but this recipe is not quite right. For four servings, use half the container and only 1 cups of water max. It is more flavorful. I always add a few extra things - depending on what is available - like cumin, garlic, tomato sauce, powdered dark chocolate etc.. I bake the thighs in the mix - or, it is great in a slowcooker - but add a bit less water.

I was excited when I saw this easy recipe; I followed it, and had high hopes for the flavor...well, let's just say there was a distinct LACK of flavor. About as bland as you can possibly get; might as well been eatin' just the white rice. Too much broth to go with the mole; had to add a bunch more mole, and still not so great. Good thing we have the pizza guy on speed dial.

Easiest way I know! I made it just as is, but I added sauteed poblano peppers and corn to the rice and turned the chicken into enchiladas for leftovers. I served it with frijoles negros. Almost like home...

I give this 4 forks so did all of my guests. It was so simple. I used vegetable broth which was fine. Will make this again and again.

I made a chicken molé for dinner tonight, then went hunting for a recipe. Yes, I know. Backwards. Anyway, what I did impromptu was much like this recipe, except instead of whole breasts, I cube them, about 1". I poured several tablespoons of vegetable oil in a dutch oven (large fry pan would have worked, but I like the deeper sides) and sautéed 4 large cloves of garlic and about 1/3 yellow onion cubed coarsely. (as per another comment, I'd use a lot more onion, probably a whole one for two chicken breasts.) Once softened, I added the cubed chicken, raised the heat and seared all sides. Then reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally. The molé sauce was Doña Maria's. I used half an 8oz jar and mixed it with about 2 cups water for two chicken breasts. (Using low salt chicken broth would have been better.) When the chicken was cooked through, I added the molé sauce and simmered for a few more minutes. Serve over rice. It was great. I think part of the trick, traditional or not, is to cook the chicken fully, then just simmer briefly in the molé sauce. The result retains a great chicken flavor instead of losing it to the molé.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I suppose it doesn't help that I live down the street from a Oaxacan restaurant where they serve some of the best moles in the world! The chicken in this mole was very bland and did not help out the sauce very much. The sauce (I actually used a paste from a local market) was much weaker than it should've been. My mother-in-law adds peanut butter and Mexican chocolate to this same basic recipe and it comes out much better. I think roasting the chicken before hand would've helped a lot. I'm definitely not making this again.

We loved it. I whisked the mole with the broth as it was cooking instead of using the blender. The only problem I ran into was opening the jar.

This was very easy. Next time we will try it in the crock pot.

I use a roasted chocolate mole from Whole Foods, dump the chicken in a crock pot, dump the broth mole mix over the top, put it on low and go to work. When I get home, I do a box of goya black beans and rice, put that on the plate, slice the chicken breast and fan over the top, ladle sauce over that, crumble cojita over the top, sprinkle with sesame and cilantro. Easy and yummy. My hubby loves this dinner.

Very easy and different. The sauce has some heat to it. I only used half of the mole sauce (Rogelio Bueno brand) and 1 can of chicken broth and this was plenty. I didn't blend the two in the blender. Just put them in the skillet and blended as it heated.

This is such a simple and delicious recipe! My kids can't get enough of it...I like my mole a bit sweeter, so I add two rounds of Ibarra chocolate (this is traditional) and I saute a whole onion in a bit of oil before adding the blended mixture. I ALWAYS skin my chicken first, so there isn't grease floating on top...and I prefer to use legs and thighs. Chicken wings are also particularly good for a party dish. Make overnight in a crockpot and bring to your next potluck; you will be giving out the recipe forever! :)

I did the Trader Joes thing that previous reviewers recommended. I thought the sauce had zero flavor except salt (and I'm a big TJs fan). I really had to doctor up the sauce and it still wasn't very good. This recipe takes a bit more effort but it's LOTS better: http://www.recipezaar.com/recipe/getrecipe.zsp?id=35659

This was great! I made it in a crockpot, but followed the directions on the recipe and blended the mole & broth. I added a can of black beans and served with rice.

This recipe was excellent and so simple to make. I also used Trader Joe's Mole sauce. Definitely use a low-sodium broth, as the mole sauce itself holds enough salt alone. I divided the recipe in half, perfect for two!

I made this recipe using Trader Joe's fresh mole sauce. I poached chicken breats in the sauce for 20 minutes and then served it on multi-grain flour tortillas with rice, cheese, black beans, and sour cream and it tasted great. It was easy and fast and yummy.

This mole recipe was, dare I say it, better than the mole I can get at the "authentic" Mexican restuarant down the street. And it's super easy, even a child could make it.

The suggestion to use a crock pot for this receipe was a wonderful idea. I sauteed an onion and added it to the other ingredients in the crock pot. This made the dinner a breeze.

The Dona Maria brand is a terrific product. For each chicken breast or leg, I usually use 1-2 large spoonfuls of sauce - the rest stores in the refrigerator indefinitely. Although it isn't quick, I typically make mole in my crock pot - put the chicken, mole sauce, more chopped onions than you think you should, and enough water to cover. Crock at least 12 hours on low. The sauce thickens wonderfully and the extra cooking time really allows the flavors develop. This is a great 'do ahead' dish - put it on in the morning and by the evening dinner's ready.

Quick and easy. This is a great quick dish. The mole is not too strong. I'll definitelty make this again.
