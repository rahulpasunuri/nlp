I love this recipe! I tried this recipe with 2 different types of fish and used my fresh rosemary from my balcony garden. I tried it with red snapper and swai. I'm glad to put this up on my blog and share it with my readers. http://oakleysgarden.blogspot.com/

In a word: Meh. The potatoes were ok (I used yukon gold sliced into wedges & halved), but it's kinda hard to mess up roasted potatoes. The fish was bland, dry and overcooked, breadcrumb topping was soggy and didn't add anything worthwhile. I even took the advice of others and halved the garlic cloves, rinsed & dried the fish, used panko breadcrumbs, and added lemon and extra salt for a little more flavor. Glad I did that, it's what made it edible! On the plus side, it was easy to prepare, very "hands-off" other than chopping potatoes, and only uses one pan. Think if I make this again, I will let the potatoes roast one more 15 min turn before adding the fish, since I like them a little crispy and browned. I will also leave off the breadcrumbs entirely, maybe try marinating the fish in a ton of lemon juice & zest with a little olive oil and another herb like thyme. I'm sure the addition of my fave lemon-thyme buerre blanc would help. The mahi really didn't need to cook 14 min (maybe my filets were too thin? recipe doesn't specify a thickness), so I will adjust the cooking time too. For a little color, might try tossing some frozen peas & carrots with the potatoes when the fish is added. In other words, this is decent base recipe but needs some creative "tweaks" to fit your individual taste!

I made this recipe for dinner guests and everyone loved it. It was simple and easy and beautiful served on a platter with the roasted potatoes. I added some carrots and zucchini to the roasting which made it more colorful. It was also easy to do most of the work before the guests arrived so I was free to entertain while the fish baked.

Boring, and topping ended up soggy. Used fresh snapper. Added lemon zest to the fish, but still didn't do it. 13 minutes was the right time for the fish.

Made with mahi mahi. It was moist and delicious. The rosemary on the fish was a little strong. I would use very little next time or will just use thyme instead.

This was delicious -- the potatoes came out like french fries, and the roasted garlic was sweet and tender while lightly scenting the whole dish. I used half the olive oil called for and it was still rich. Served steamed broccoli on the side. I used whole wheat panko crumbs for the bread crumbs and red snapper for the fish. I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried and it was fine.

This was easy and tasty. Will definitely make this again. Just add something green on the side!

This took less than 15 minutes of hands-on time (really, all you have to do is wash the potatoes, and then you're there), making it perfect for weeknights, but it was good enough to serve at a casual dinner party. I used coarse see salt, which I think gave it a nice, rustic neighborhood trattoria flavor. With the breadcrumbs and roasted potatoes, the mise-en-plâce looks a little brown. If that matters to you, consider something else like peas or a red pepper purée, or roasted tomatoes (like another commenter posted) to mitigate. Plating with lemons is also an option and would brighten the flavor, too.

Rating: 3
This was great. I added some plum tomatoes to the potatoes (roasted for the same amount of time), as well as 2 shallots. I baked the fish for 20 minutes. The rosemary was sort of spikey, and I prefer the taste of oregano, so that's what I'll use next time. I'll probably add a little lemon juice or zest next time, too. Otherwise, a great, simple, healthy meal that's perfect for the middle of the week.

Really spectacular. I used yukon gold potatoes, fresh thyme instead of rosemary, and sole fish that was pre-frozen. While these aren't ideal ingredients, they were already in my fridge and I needed to use them. I served this with broiled asparagus. Plates were left clean!

Made this for dinner tonight. My husband is not particularly a fish lover and even he raved about it and there was not a crumb left. The only difference was that I added some sliced shallots to the pan with the potatoes and again with the mahi mahi. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
This was wonderful and simple. Lots of flavor with very few ingredients. I loved the crunchy breadcrumbs and the roasted garlic flavor. Only complaint is that the recipe doesn't specify a thickness for the fish. My mahi took almost twice as long as called for to cook. Was nearly raw after 14 minutes.

Rating: 3
This is a great way to cook fish. The only change I would have made in my preparation is that I used Chilean Sea Bass. I think the fish itself is a little buttery for my taste, so I would suggest using a different type of fish. The flavors in this recipe (especially the garlic) really stand out so having a milder fish might work better.

Rating: 4
Excellent dish. We received some gorgeous extremely fresh grouper filets (caught yesterday) and decided to give this recipe a try. I've often oven roasted rosemary/garlic potatoes and Panko crusted fish but never together. I did mix some lemon zest in with the chopped rosemary and breadcrumbs, left the garlic cloves whole, and used the sprigs of rosemary for the potatoes. And since the filets were about 2" thick, I added the fish after the first 15 minutes of cooking the potatoes. Delicious!

I thought the recipe was alright. To me the potatoes were better than the fish. I enjoyed the taste of the new potatoes. I may make them for breakfast sometime. I could take it or leave it as far as the fish goes. I'll hunt for another recipe.

But where's the melanzana? Before baking, we layered thinly sliced globe eggplant among the the potatoes, grated the garlic cloves, and buried the rosemary sprigs between the vegetables. We settled on tilapia fillets with excellent results. Since rosemary leaves tend to go brittle when baked, we left the sprigs intact which made for easy removal at plating time.

I made this recipe fora dinner party last night with Butterfish. Yum!!! So easy and so many raves. I only had some young garlic from the market so I cut that up and also added some zucchini and capers per everyone else's suggestion. I added a lot of capers and it was GOOD. I also cut up the sprig of rosemary into 1" or so pieces to put on top of the potatoes and I chopped the rosemary leaves that I put on the fish. I baked the fish for 14 minutes. It was delightful.

This is a great recipe, super easy to make. I used sweet potatoes and red potatoes. I also marinated the mahi mahi with fresh ginger, lemon juice, and a bit of cayenne pepper for an extra kick. Absolutely delish.

I made this delicious supper on the grill. I used mahi-mahi and refridgerated rosemary potatoes. I wrapped them in heavy foil. The fish and potatoes cook evenly in the same amount of time. I didn't flip it and kept it skin side down, took about 20 minns on the grill. Hubby said it could have stood more spice, so will mince rosemary and use more next time and there will be a next time!

I make this dish often. I have made it with sea bass and snapper. Each time it is delicous. I typically eliminate the bread crumbs, because the fish is so delicate and delicious with just the oil/salt/pepper rosemary. I roast zuchinni with the potatoes. There isn't an easier way to make fish delicious and the presentation is beautiful and fresh.

Wow! This is excellent. I used stripe bass for the fish, added about 2 - 3 TB capers to the potatoes (per suggestions) and used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs which gave it extra flavor and crunch. I can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe is. Will DEFINITELY make it again!

Rating: 4
I used mahi mahi and regular idaho potatoes since that's what I had on hand. This turned out great. I just cut the potatoes very small so they wouldn't take forever to cook. I used garlic salt on the potatoes b/c I was worried the garlic cloves would burn being in that long. I mixed some italian bread crumbs with 2 cloves of garlic (2 people) salt, and pepper and sprinkled that over the top of the mahi mahi, cooked it for an extra 10 min per another reviewer and the fish turned out perfect! my husband absolutely loved it and it was my first time making mahi mahi! I'm a picky fish eater and this will definitely be made again!

This was amazing. It was so quick and delicious and easy. This is in our weeknight rotation forever now. It is fabu! I don't know if the ease or the results are more fantastic. I admit I tweaked this a bit, but only because of the reviews that said it tasted 'bland'. I used Mahi- mahi; rough chopped the rosemary leaves that went on the fish; and added some minced garlic on top of the fish. For the potatoes, I halved the garlic cloves instead of leaving them whole and broke the rosemary sprigs in pieces so it scatterd among the potatoes. I also added capote capers to the potatoes per the previous reviewer. My only regret was that there wasn't more.

Simple, delicious, and a staple in a chef's repertoire. For the people who thought it was boring... Be creative. A roasted red pepper aioli or a wasabi mayo goes great with this classic dish. Panko bread crumbs on the mahi mahi (cooked for 10 min) creates more texture.

I love to cook with all types of seafood. I used the Mahi Mahi and while this recipe was not bad, it was nothing to write home about. I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor simply was not there. If I make it again, instead of leaving the garlic cloves whole, I will probably mince them. In addition to that I think this dish needs something to snap it up, perhaps some grated parmesean or romano cheese at the end.

Such a simple and delicious recipe. I streamlined things by leaving the potatoes in the whole time, and it was still excellent.

Made this last night. Followed the recipe exactly except used dried Rosemary. While it was OK, as my husband said, it definitely was NOT anything special. Needed to add a lot of salt at the table (which we almost never do), Not just sure if it was the Mahi-Mahi or that I did not add enough up front. On the positve side it was quick and easy, the fish did not dry out, and it only used one pan. May try again and punch up the salt up front, or may try with boneless chicken breasts.

I cut the potatoes into slices instead of wedges so that they cooked faster, and used thyme instead of rosemary, since that's what I had on hand. For fish, I used cod. Served with a lemon wedge and asparagus and it was delicious, and easy to prepare! Will definitely make this a regular weeknight meal.

This dish was good but was not anything special. I substituted sweet potatoes because that's what I had and they were awesome! For the fish I used panko bread crumbs and mahi mahi. I felt the fish needed something more, just not sure what. I think it is a good base recipe but could surely be improved upon. Would make again but would play around with the recipe a bit.

I made this recipe and followed it to the tee (unlike others who have commented in the negative-- how can you complain about a recipe when you don't follow it?? duh!), and I have to admit, it was delicious! While I had never made mahi mahi before, I was delightfully surprised as to how tasty it was. While its texture was a little firmer than I had expected, it was lovely. The flavours blended together really well. I would make it again in a heartbeat!

I am not an experienced cook, by any means. I am a single girl, who loves the IDEA of being a good cook and tests the waters every now and again.

Oh and I used True Cod.

Was looking for an easy and reasonably quick weeknight baked fish something and this fit the bill nicely - with one small problem: No one in this house likes the taste of rosemary! Used tarragon and a bit of basil instead. Turned out great! Also used crushed saltines for breadcrumbs (and omitted any extra salt) because it was what I had on hand. Next time I used half russet and half sweet potatoes, threw in a handfull of baby carrots that were a bit past their prime, and added about 2 T. capers - as suggested by another reviewer. VERY good 'in house' reviews! Has become one of our 'staple' fish dishes. Definitely agree with Bagelboots - not a recipe for Mahi Mahi or tuna. Cod or tilapia will work better. Do not neglect the rinsing and drying of the fish!

Rating: 3
First tried this in Zürich, with unknown type of fish fillet. Points for simplicity of preparation, and with fresh ingredients it tasted pretty good. I don't peel new potatoes, and I wouldn't use MahiMahi or any kind of tuna for this. The recipe is more suited to tastying up fish 'n' chips fish, like cod. Fresh rosemary definitely required. Add a veggie side (in my case, frozen mixed veggies) to make a meal.

This is the worst recipe I have ever gotten off of this website. The fish was bland; the color of the whole dish was monotone. Spuds were OK, but roasted potatoes are always good. I was especially pissed because the mahi-mahi was almost $12 a pound; what a waste. I did have to use dried roasemary, and I know fresh would have been better, but I had nice garlic and excellent olive oil. I've had Marcella's recipes before(I have several of her boks) and this just did not cut it. I could give it half a fork.

ok, so due to th the recent inclement weather in the Northeast, my selection of fresh fish was somewhat limited. I ended up going with haddock filets, which worked amazingly well. I added diced shallots to the garlic cloves. I also used redskin potatoes which I did NOT peel - why bother? They taste great, the skin is healthy and the color is an added bonus to this dish. Would definitely make this again!!!! I'm thinking of making this as main course for Passover seder, substituting matzo meal for breadcrumbs.

This was an easy one-dish meal -- I used halibut and the fish was moist and flavorful! We invited my mom at the last minute so I added onions with the potatoes, and then added mini zuchinni when the fish was added. Served with hearty bread -- plenty for everyone! I'll try again with other fish and different vegies.

OMG this is truly delicious 3.5 for sure. I used russet potatoes and cut them in half and then wedges and added onions to the potatoes and garlic. Oh my gosh, really just delish. I used dried rosemary as that is what I has on hand. I also added frozen green beans when I added the fish (Mahi mahi) to have some color (in fact next time I will use red onion just for the color instead of white), everything came out fab. For those who don't think there was enough flavor try adding a bit of salt it might be all that is missing.

How can something this simple be this good? I've never given a recipe four forks before, but this really is beyond compare. I used more garlic because my husband loves it. I made it with talapia. I may have used more rosemary than intended, but how big is a "sprig" anyway, especially when you cut if from a three year old plant in the garden. This dish is truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. The fish was moist, the potatoes brown and savory and the garlic rich and perfume-y. We couldn't stop eating it! I know not everyone agrees with me, but in my book, Marcella Hazan can do no wrong.

My wife and I really enjoyed this dish. It was easy to prepare and had a great flavor. I made this dish with grouper, left the skins on the potatoes, minced the garlic and used panko. I messed up and forgot the panko until the fish was half cooked, but the dish still turned out well. We will definitely be adding this to our regular rotation.

Very good and simple! My boyfriend is not a fish person, and even he liked it! For fish I used cod, and instead of bread crumbs I used well-crushed Ritz crackers. I also used dried rosemary instead of fresh. The results were terrific and we definitely will have this again. It goes great with steamed asparagus!

The fish took a bit longer to bake than outlined in the recipe. The potatoes were very tasty. I'm not a big fish eater, so this was not tasty enough to make the fish more appealing.

I never thought I would hear such enthusiasm for fish (much less grouper, which I love but not everyone does) but my red meat eating husband couldn't compliment this dish enough...and he would have eaten more if there was any left! I followed the recipe closely although I used minced garlic which provided a stronger more highly seasoned result. I think panko would have been better than my standard dry bread crumbs but the result was still wonderful. A definite repeater if I can find good fresh grouper again.

This was indeed easy to make and tasty. Even my husband who only eats fish if it's fried and served with french fries or if it's in fish tacos thought it was "not too bad." We forgot the garlic, but didn't find the dish lacking. We also used lemon infused EVOO instead of plain EVOO with success. This is an excellent quick weeknight meal; I wouldn't pull the recipe out for a special occasion, though.

Because haddock was fresh and on sale, I substituted haddock for the fish suggested in the recipe. So I cut back on the rosemary quite a bit, not to overpower the haddock, and I added some sliced zucchini when the potatoes were almost done and the fish hadn't been added yet. We loved it. Will definitely add as one of the recipes I make regularly. Very simple and tasty.

I used fresh Alaskan Cod and small new potatoes. I also used elephant garlic (as I do in most recipes, because of it's subtleness) so as not to overpower the cod. And...I used fresh rosemary.

Made this with Mahi Mahi, and liked it very much. I added carrots to the potatoes for roasting, and added slices of cold butter on top of the fish before cooking it.

I screwed this up royal. After the first 15 minutes of roasting the potatoes I turned the oven off instead of the oven timer. Fast forward to recovery and man, this was the best treatment of Mahi Mahi I think I've ever had. I'm pretty sure if I made it correctly it would off the charts.
