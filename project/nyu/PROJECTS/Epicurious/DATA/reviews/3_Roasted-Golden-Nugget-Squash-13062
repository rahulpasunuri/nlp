Wonderful. You don't usually get just the bare bones recipe, but that is all I needed, just wanted to know oven temp and time since I have not cooked one of this kind before. But now I can just use any favorite Acorn Squash recipe that I enjoy. Thanks for the quick tip.

Oh wow. Who'd ever thought? A little complicated, though
