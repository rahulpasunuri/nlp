Really delicious! I used the turn-off-the-oven method and got 25 cookies that were crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. I also added half a Trader Joe's dark chocolate bar, broken into tiny pieces.

I don't know what some of the first reviewers are talking about; I just made two batches of these, baked them for 40 minutes at 300, and they were STILL chewy! I was using a digital oven; perhaps the other ovens weren't very accurate? My first batch I got cautious and didn't quite beat the egg whites long enough, thereby resulting in bigger, flatter cookies. The next batch I really let the whites fluff up before adding the sugar, and I got the 40 cookies as advertised. Served them at Sarasota Opera the other night to our cast and crew; everyone loved them, and the one of the stage managers went back for fourths!

delicious cookies, with one warning: DO follow the recipe, no matter what anyone tells you! lol if you have a friend or relative who is a chef, they may try to convince you of certain things, and they are wrong! my boyfriend was standing around "helping" as i made these cookies, and these are the problems i encountered. "you dont need to sift cocoa powder." YES you do. the cocoa powder will sink your meringue if not sifted, it clumps just like flour. "you do not need to add the powder in such small increments; as long as you are still beating the meringue, it will not fall. taking too much time will result in overbeating." WRONG. lol. follow the recipe. either way, great recipe for wonderful cookies!

I've made these using other recipes before, but these turned out perfect! I didn't use cocoa powder and added chocolate chips instead. Delish!

Our Kisses deflated to flat discs in the oven.

Everything was great until the cocoa/sugar was added. The mixture deflated into batter consistency and couldn't be revived. Had to think fast by adding flour, baking soda, and making a no-cholesterol brownie!

Use convection oven to 'fluff' up the meringues. Heat oven to 300 degrees and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce convection oven to 250 degrees for 5 minutes and then turn off-can take them out after 30 min. Learned this in NZ making the national dish pavlova and tweeked it for the small kisses.

I got a little snazzy and folded ground hazelnuts in before dropping them onto the cookie sheets. I *did* back them a little too long, so they are nice and crispy, instead of having a tad of a chew, but they still came out wonderfully.

What a great little recipe! For those of who can't eat wheat, it is perfect. Easy to make, and yes, Roger Szemraj's baking tips made all the difference.

Many thanks to "roger.szemraj" whose suggestion to turn off the oven after putting in the meringues worked perfectly, although I had to leave mine in for about 2 1/2 hours to get the desired consistency. These are a nice afternoon coffee break treat. For those who are counting, I calculate that they're about 16 calories a piece.

Help! I made the batter twice attempting to us splenda in flake form rather than sugar. When I added the splenda to the egg whites they held up fine, but when I added the splenda/cocoa mixture the egg whites fell flat immediately. I tried again and cut the cocoa in 1/2 and this time it held up better but still didn't maintain a stiff meringue. Any suggestions? I'm using very good, dark cocoa. I cooked the second batch using the cooking time recommended by the reviewers which worked great. They taste good for a low calorie chocolate boost, but they definitely weren't pretty.

By substituting splenda for the sugar this is a great recipe for those looking for sweets on a low carb diet!

Here is a different way to bake them and avoid some of the problems found by other reviewers --- Preheat your oven to 300 degrees while making the batter. When you place the meringues in the oven, shut it off immediately. Leave in the oven for two hours for a crispy finish. The residual heat from the preheating will firm up and dry the cookies beautifiully without any risk of burning.

Turn down the cooking temp!!!Too hot, and mine burnt thank you very much.

I only cooked them for 25 minutes and they were nice and chewy--a good variation from traditional crispy meringue cookies. They are very light and balance a platter of richer cookies, but are (in my opinion) too light to be a dessert all on their own.

I wish to know why mine were so flat and yucko.

These were great and healthy too!

I only gave these delicious cookies 2 forks because the author's baking instructions are TERRIBLE! Who bakes meringues at such an extreme temperature? I'm grateful that I read some of the less favorable reviews, so that I could avoid a disaster - like wasted Valrhona cocoa (thank you reviewers!). I followed the recipe but I used the baking instructions from 3 other cookbooks, ALL of which recommended the following: 200° F for 40 mins - then turn off the oven & leave them in for an hour. Mine came out GREAT - give it a shot & see.

These are really easy and quick to make and everyone I know who has tasted them, loves them. I bake them 30-35 minutes and they come out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Just emailed the recipe to my cousin in Chicago so she can try them.

These were more like kisses of death. They turned out to be dry, bitter and inedible. As another reviewer said - a waste of good quality ingredients.

wonderful. yummy.

I followed the directions exactly and made the teaspoon sized merigues, the recipe yielded the correct amount. As I wanted the drier type of merigue I baked them for 30 minutes, the cookies were mostly too burnt to eat! Some of them were still salvegable, but were not even tasty enough to serve. There are far better merigue recipes out there, I wish I'd saved my best quality cocoa for another recipe!

Very simple and quick. Used my Kitchenaid mixer and teflon pan liners. Great recipe to make with kids because ingredients don't have to be precise. Make sure you shape the cookies before baking because what you see is what you get. Great taste and very light -- serve with fruit. Makes 2 dozen if scooped with a Tablespoon.

These were okay; I liked the chocolate meringue BEFORE it was baked better than after. They did bake up to be crispy on the outside, light and foamy on the inside. I had to bake them a little longer than I wanted so that I could get them off the tin foil. Maybe the parchment would be better. Give them a little touch before taking them out of the oven- when they are done they have firm tops.

Simple to make and the meringues are as light as angel's wings. Dutch process cocoa makes this especially satisfying. Recipe makes 2 dozen cookies instead of 40.

WONDERFUL!! Simple and full of flavor! I made a double batch for a party and they were all eaten. Impressive yet pretty easy to prepare.
