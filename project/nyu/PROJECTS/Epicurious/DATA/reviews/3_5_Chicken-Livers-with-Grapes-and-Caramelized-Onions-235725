followed the recipe exactly. Time consuming - 30 minutes devoted to caramelizing onions the sweetness of which was completely overpowered by the vinegar. Sweetness of grapes can also not overcome the acidity of the vinegar. Poorly thought out dish - a huge disappointment.

This is quite good. I used mostly sherry wine with a bit of red wine vinegar (no sherry vinegar). I also used a little chicken stock to deglaze. In retrospect, I might have added more vinegar, as the recipe suggested. The tartness was good. The sweet grapes were wonderful. I served this over a bed of greens, as some suggested. I thought butter lettuce would be perfect, but I couldn't find any so I used red leaf. It was good, but butter lettuce would have been even better I think. I microwaved some brown rice left-over from a Chinese restaurant and put it in the side. This could have used a more intensely herbaceous note. My feeling is that the rosemary could be doubled. I like to really taste fresh rosemary if I'm going to use it. Make sure you keep the livers pink inside. They are so delicate and tender that way. Make sure to use a high heat to brown the livers nicely; also when deglazing, so the drippings are well concentrated. Delicious.

I love this recipe! I don't like ofal meat so I made pounded out chicken breast and deglazed w/ reisling instead of the vinegar and it was great! I paird it w/ asperagas and sauted mushooms. mmmmmmm it was so good, I think I may try the parm w/ it, that sounds like it would add some kick. Anyways good recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I had it on a bed of greens as suggested by some reviewers, and had to have seconds. Best recipe yet for chicken liver, though may not be the healthiest cholesterol-wise. I will try it with 1/2 the amount of butter next time. Liver is already rich in cholesterol.

I enjoyed this combination of flavours - the sweetness of the grapes cuts through the richness of the livers. My husband and I ate this as a main meal served over salad leaves and some other salad vegetables. I tried the parmesan as recommended by another reviewer, but am not sure that I liked tha flavour with the other bold flavours of the liver and grapes. I would make this again.

This is a compromise rating. I made this for my girlfriend, who loves chicken livers. She found the vinegar overpowering. I kind of liked the recipe, but also found the vinegar too assertive. Maybe sherry itself would have provided a more modulated effect? Nevertheless, I'm deleting it from my recipe box.

Being married for 2+ years to a former professional chef and a foodie myself, I've learned to expect the unexpected; but I would never have imagined the unctious meal we were about to have when I came home to find chicken livers and grapes on the counter and carmelized onions underway. Served over a bed of spring greens - oh my goodness!!! When I prepare it for tonight's meal, it will be our third time of this surprising and lip-smacking dish. I can taste it already.

I liked it all a lot, but I think I would have preferred a more traditional pairing with pears or apples.

My wife brought home chicken livers and asked me to "do something with them." We had seedless green grapes, not red, and no sherry vinegar; so I substituted balsamic. I served it over mixed lettuce, with shaved parmesan on top, like one of the other reviewers. Fantastic! The mellowness of the chicken livers, sweetness of the caramelized onions and tartness of the vinegar and grapes make it very satisfying.

This makes for an excellent and healthy midweek meal. The flavours are outstanding and, served over baby spinach leaves tossed with toasted pine nuts and a little freshly shaved parmesan, it looks great on the plate.

I made this with calf liver - I couldn't find chicken liver at the time. And still, it was very good.

This recipe was really easy and quite tasty. I served it over mesclun greens--which was very good because the dish is quite rich and dense. I would not recommend serving this as an entree because of the richness, and also because it's not very pretty. However, as an appetizer and with the greens it is excellent.

I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand. It is a fantastic dish for those of us who love chicken livers. I agree with the people who cut the grapes in half.

I ate the entire recipe of this. It was amazing, and a great hangover cure. i used green grapes becasue we had accidentally used all of the red ones, and I substituted champagne vinegar for the sherry vinegar. Delish!

This is a really delicious way to eat liver, if you are going to eat liver - I don't know if it would make any liver converts, but for an already pro-liver eater it hit the spot! Just as the note said, the sweetness of the grapes balances wonderfully with the the other rich flavors and the tartness of the vinegar. And rosemary is a brilliant match for this combination. I did two things differently from the recipe: I halved the grapes before sauteing them, because I just don't like chasing round objects around a plate trying to spear them with a fork, and because I hoped more of the juices would come out when sauted. Also, I didn't have any sherry vinegar on hand so I subsituted white wine vinegar. Both changes worked fine, although the grapes didn't exude much juice and basically kept their body when sauted, which turned out to be just as yummy.

Used seeded grapes which I halved and seeded myself, but otherwise followed exactly. Will definitely make again. A quick and easy was to make a delicious, sophisticated meal.

I did the recipe exactly as stated, and loved it! This is the first time I've ever cooked liver, and I'm quite proud of how good it turrned out. It's very sophisticated, although I think it's a tiny bit greasy. I might try to cut back on the oil with the onions.

This was very good -- until now I have not been a lover of chicken liver, except for pate, so this was an experiment to see if I could enjoy livers. It was delicious. We did add some white wine at the end of the onion cooking, and used half of the vinegar, substituting a little more white wine, and also cut the grapes in half.
