This soup was GREAT!! Had it as a first course for a Chinese New Year wine dinner. We added the enoki mushroom and snowpeas. Also didn't include the serrano chili but passed that around as well as red pepper chili oil. We paired the soup with two wines - a Rose and a Gewurtztraminer to see which one was better. Interestingly the Rose was better when the soup wasn't spicy and the Gewur. was better when it had the added oil -the sweetness offset the spice.

I discovered this recipe last week and have already made it twice! So easy and so good. Lots of great flavors. I quartered mushrooms and used chicken instead of shrimp.

I added sliced carrots, snow peas, zucchini, and fresh sliced mushrooms at the end (zucchini and carrots a little earlier to soften) and it was delicious. I would also try a bit of chinese cabbage and perhaps some bamboo shoots next time.

i did this for a cooking group i'm in. i don't eat chicken, so used vegetable broth instead. i needed to add a bit more salt. i also added more lemon grass and used a jalapeno instead of serrano. it was delicious.

This is actually a very tasty dish to have when you get the inevitable winter cold.

Made this with a good homemade vegetable broth instead of the chicken stock, and while the soup was quite nice and tasty, it seemed more like something that you'd eat when you have a cold than a dish you'd find yourself craving. Maybe worth another try with the addition of the snow peas and enoki mushrooms mentioned by other reviewers.

My husband went crazy over this soup. It's now on our favourites list. I kept all the herbs as each one adds so much flavour and they all blend so well together. I used med shrimp rather than large ones. I did add a bit more lemongrass as we both love it.

I liked it, but think it needs a little more oomph. Next time I will add additional ginger and I will salt and pepper the shrimp before adding it in.

just made this - yum!!! mostly followed the recipe - only difference was that i kept the broth at 3 cans instead of 6 as there were only two of us. but herbs, shrimp, AND serrano amts were the same. it tasted JUST like Pho, which i guess maybe it is. we ended up fishing a lot of the serranos out b/c half of one per person is pretty hot. but the spiciness of the broth itself was great and plateaued quickly, so i wouldn't change that. oh, and i added enoki mushrooms, just b/c i'd never tried them. pretty good, but i think next time i'll use shiitakes. and it's so filling w/ all that broth so it's very healthy.

Delicious! I did not use the carrot (didn't have) and also substituted lemons for the lemongrass at the suggestion of another subscriber. Also, I will use a pepper with a higher heat index next time. It did not have enough spice for us. I'll also try the addition of rice noodles. Simple and tasty! Yum!

I personally think this dish was over-rated. I liked it, but I believe that 4 forks is too much. My husband liked it, and we'll probably make the dish again.

I have made this twice in 3 weeks, as it gets rave reviews. I did add some snowpeas and straw mushrooms at the end. I also decreased the mint just a touch; while increasing the garlic and ginger. Removing the serrano after simmering allows enough heat, but not overpowering. Everyone loves this great combo of spices. This is a "no fail" recipe.

The original recipe is very tasty and have made it many times changing it a bit every time. The latest attempt was my favorite and was very similar the thai hot and sour soup. When simmering the broth with the shells I added 1 tsp of chili with garlic (found in the international section at Whole Foods)instead on the serrano chili. It was a bit spicier than the original so I recommend 1/2 tsp to start and adding more to taste. I also left out both the mint (because I don't care for it) and the basil (because I didn't have it) and used all cilantro. I'm sure it would be fine with one or both. To make a light meal out of the soup try adding pea pods with straw mushroom.

Wow! This soup is fantastic. I'm not a big fan of spicy food, so I left out the chili, but it was still flavorful and had plenty of kick from all the ginger and garlic. Also, I found it easier and just as effective to peel apart the lemongrass, since it's tough. I will definitely be making this one again soon. And best of all, it reheated wonderfully!

wow. this soup is amazing - a definite hit and will be a regular menu item. also so easy. Not liking to devein & detail shrimp, I skipped the shrimp shells & cheated by buying deveined, deshelled uncooked shrimp. I otherwise generally followed the recipe (although I probably didn't have the full amount of shrimp in there - maybe 100g and I used 1 litre of broth). Was enough for 2 people for a large first course without leaving leftovers. The result delicious - my guest went back for seconds - & the shrimp just explodes in your mouth. Something mild like mushrooms wouldn't detract much from this soup - but I do like it as it is. Another recipe you just have to try. I wasn't sure what a serrano chili was so just used one of those small hot chillis you can buy in asian food stores & in regular supermarkets both. It was quite spicy (my threshold as to spiciness is quite low) but not overpowering. It was lovely. Another tip: you can use the carrot/ginger/garlic mix strained out of the broth for a seasoning base for a vegetable stirfry the following day.

This is a winner with anyone you have to dinner. I highly recommend it.

I substituted the serrano cerrano chili for 1/2 jalapeno. My wife found it still to stong, but the guests loved it. I also used a few slices of finely sliced mushroom caps to granish. Very good soup

A great soup. My family loved this. Have made it again and again.

Outstanding! The best first-course soup I have had in a long time, and my French husband, who typically prefers a hearty soup packed with ingredients, completely agreed. I made this EXACTLY as written, I would NOT omit the mint, the fresh combination of the herbs absolutely makes this soup and gives it a Vietnamese feel. I will make this again and again. To the cook from Atlanta, I would not recommend freezing this soup. I believe the success of it depends on the freshness and serving it immediately. Also, I lied when I said I prepared it exactly as written, my store was out of lemongrass so I used the zest of one whole lemon and it worked very well, since you strain the ingredients anyway. I also used homemade stock instead of canned (with full salt :). And at the risk of sounding like a foodie snob, to the Canadian from Toronto: if you think the only place for mint is in chocolate ice cream, you are on the wrong website!

I typically love spicy food, but for some reason I couldn't handle the serrano in this soup. I can barely finish my bowl...how embarassing. Otherwise, the flavors are great. It is easy, and very light. I think it does need something extra, like mushrooms or noodles, to add substance. But it is a *broth* I guess.

This is superb exactly as written. The flavors are fabulous together. My wife raved and raved and raved!

The broth in this soup is outstanding. I omitted the mint also, and the next time I make it, I'll add some rice noodles to the bottom of the soup bowls. I also added mushrooms.

Perfect, love lime / cilantro / spicy dishes, but is this dish freezable? Also, lemongrass is v. difficult to find. Any substitutions?

Rating: 4
Absolutely the best and esiest soup recipe ever! I would make it again in an instant. I added chopped red peppers at the end and some rice vermicelli noodles (cooked seperate and placed in the bottom of the soup bowls) and had it as the main course.

A lovely soup, spicy and delicious. Next time I will omit the mint, NOT because I think mint should only be paired with sweet flavors as another reviewer has opined, but because I felt it clashed with the coriander and ginger in this particular combination of ingredients. I, too, added mushrooms -- a combination of dried, wild ones. All in all, a complex and very flavorful broth that, unlike other Asian-type soups, was fast and easy to prepare.

Completely agree with other comments made -- a delightful tasting soup! I added straw mushrooms as suggested by others and also threw in baby corn. Turned out great!

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe and very easy! I added straw mushrooms (the kind that look like eyeballs!) and they added a wonderful taste and texture. I added them to the first step. I omitted coriander and mint - but did add coriander seeds. Mint should only be served with chocolate chips in icecream! Be careful not to overcook the shrimp - they are done in a flash! Wonderful dish.

Fantastic flavor! Explodes in your mouth; you want to taste more! Served as first course of dinner party to rave reviews. Didn't change a thing on the recipe, and won't need to for future tastings. Wow.

This is a wonderful, light recipe! Light enought for hot summer days, but great in the winter too. It really seems to warm you from the inside out. Great combination of flavors.

simple and better than the local resturaunt's version! I omit the shrimp and cook chicken in the broth instead, and put in dried red chili to simmer in the broth. At the end, I also double the spices (but have jalepeno instead of serrano), add jasmine rice noodles and bok choy to steam for several minutes. Serve with shredded carrot and raw bean sprouts, chopsticks and a spoon for a full, tasty meal!

Absolutely fantastic! This soup has wonderful flavor.

This is definitely a "4" WITH the modifications Sylvia suggests. I was looking to duplicate a deliciously spicy, pungent Thai soup from a local establishment and doubled up on all the seasonings including the chili. The result was fabulous and I am no longer restaurant dependent for my fix. Diet tip: drink the broth alone for a satisfying 10-calorie bit of heaven.

This was a delicious soup! My whole family liked it. Even my little brother. He eather loves a dish, or hates it. No in-between. The ginger tastes delicious in this fabulous dish!. I am definetly making it again!

I used all the flavoring ingredients (except the garlic) with only half the amount of broth, and just to turn it up even higher added a second serrano chili (not for the faint-hearted!) The result was a mouth-searing aromatic blast that had our jaded palates swooning. "You should open a restaurant" sighed mmy True Love.

If you like the lime-cilantro-spicy flavor you'll like it. I'll be making this again - even my father liked it!
