What to say about this recipe, I find nothing about it extraordinary. The mushrooms have a kind of microwaved-meal feel to them; all the ingredients disappear together under the Worcestershire, which the cornstarch just makes worse. I just made the polenta soft, served with just the sauce on top, and the mozzarella is just too plasticky (of course this was my own improvisation). Maybe I've had too many great mushroom recipes that are both rich & fresh, (Batali's Hodgepodge & Smitten Kitchen's mushroom bourguinon) and this can't compete.

Without a doubt, this is one of my all-time favorites for entertaining. I always get raves and always get requests for the recipe. It's so good, people ask me to make it for charity dinners - any excuse! It not only tastes incredible, but it's easy to make (though a bit time consuming), and it serves a crowd. It's hard to find good "casserole" sorts of recipes that don't have that "canned soup" feel to them. Delish!

I cheated a bit as well, using preformed polenta, sliced into rounds and then pan fried. The ragout I followed exactly and it was really delicious. Next time I might just serve the ragout over egg noodles.

I could see from past cooks, this recipe entailed extra work. I took the low road and cut thick slices of store-bought rolled polenta. The sauce was rich..very nice. The long simmering time for the sauce was worth the wait. I believe this side dish could of handled some additional cheese on top.

I serve this at Christmas every year. The mushroom ragout has a fantastic flavor. I've run into problems with layering the polenta and ragout, so now I just make the polenta traditional style and use the ragout as a topping. Way easier.

This recipe was OK. The polenta was rather bland but it was easy to make so I can't complain about the amount of effort I put into the recipe. I don't think I'll be making it again however.

I would only make this again with modifications. I had high hopes for this dish based on the previous reviews and I don't think it was worth the work. The shiitake ragout is fabulous, but there's no need for all the layering, cut-outs, etc. Next time I'll just make a polenta cake (using instant polenta), top it with this delicious ragout and sprinkle on a bit of parmesan, then bake & serve.

This recipe turned out well and I would make it again if entertaining vegetarian guests. It is a lot of work though for the output.

This was a lot of work, but a very tasty, rich vegetarian meal in the end (I used a vegetable broth). It was great that you can prep this the day before, because it was time consuming and you can't really rush things. If you prep and refrigerate the day before, it will probably take at least 45-50 minutes to heat up before serving. My polenta started to get lumpy, but I just quickly swapped my spoon with a whisk and that made it smooth again. It would have been helpful to have someone slowly pour in the cornmeal while I was stirring/whisking. Cutting out the stars was very easy, and that was the most fun part of this recipe! - They looked very festive for the holidays. Leftovers were great.

Wonderful!!!! I can't wait to make it again.

A good one for polenta. The grocery didn't have shiitakes, so I substituted cremini mushrooms. Also, substituted vegetable broth for the beef and used a Worcestershire sauce that didn't have anchovies in it--cooking for vegetarians. The ragout was the star of this dish, everyone agreed, and several of the people I served to had never eaten polenta. Is it an acquired taste? One person commented that they felt they were eating "gourmet grits." I love polenta, so I was pleased with this recipe.

I was really nervous when I tasted the ragout before assembling and baking the dish. But the flavors really meld and it turns out to be a wonderful tasty dish. The stars are easy to make and fun too! One word of suggestion, when you make the polenta continue stirring in one circular direction as you would if you were making egg drop soup. You must continuously stir as well to prohibit lumps from forming. Using these techniques my polenta turned out perfect and lump free.

flavor combinations were great; served on a bed of wilted greens before a main course of grilled buffalo steaks & roasted vegetables. to get the polenta smooth, i dumped the cornmeal in a wire mesh sieve, which i shook with my left hand over the pot of boiling vegetable broth as i whisked with my right hand. worked perfectly -- first time i've made polenta.

This was sooo good and soooo easy. I didn't use cutouts either, just layered the polenta and the mushrooms. I used portabello mushrooms and shiitake. I had some problems making the polenta..it got lumpy so I had to blend it using my hand blender. Otherwise, it was a complete success, and my guests (all guys) loved it!

This was wonderful! I made it for a potluck and it was one of the favorite dishes. The only changes I made we that I did not add the beef broth and just made the polenta on the side. To the polenta I added smoked gouda cheese, which added a lovely smoky flavor. Will definitely make this again!

I added a can of black beans to the sauce to make this a whole meal. It went very well with the cornmeal. Make sure you add a lot of salt to the polenta. It was too much work to make the cut-outs so I just spread half the polenta to the bottome of the pan, put the ragout on top and then spread the rest of the polenta on top best I could and grated mozzarella on top. It only needed 20 minutes to bake and was very delicious.

My family, friends and dinner guests all love this recipe. I have made some changes. Three or four years ago we had a similar dish at the Washington Inn in Cape May except the cheese used was Taleggio and the red wine was replaced by dry marsala. I have kept the cheese change and alternate with the wine. Someone always comments on the special flavor of the cheese. I use the polenta recipe from the Complete Italian Vegetarian Cookbook and it is perfect everytime. I add the parmesan as instructed in the recipe.

Lots of taste, very hearty. Couldn't find "Star" cookie cutter so had fun with using a Unicorn, Turkey and Ice Cream Cone. Diners all enjoyed it, although it's obvious some people like polenta more than others. Fairly labor-intensive, but worth it.

Heavy. But very good.

This recipe was great, and the mushroom ragout in particular was amazing! I used cremini muchrooms instead of shiitake. I also made the ragout to accompany the polenta and eggplant stacks (instead of the toato sauce in the polenta recipe) and it worked really well. I wanted to make this vegetarian, so I substituted vegetable broth for the beef broth, and it seemed perfect

We liked this recipe very much, will make it part of my repertoire, especially for brunches. I did not, however, cook the polenta myself, as I had a tube of store-bought cooked polenta already in the fridge. I just sliced it lengthwise into lasagna noodle like slabs and layered the mushroom mixture and fresh mozzarella as described in the recipe. Very satisfying vegetarian dish.
