Absolutely loved this salad. Simple easy dressing, low on the calories with fresh ingrediants. As mentioned by another reviewer perfect peaches are needed and make or break this salad.

Ooops, forgot to mention I didn't use the tomatoes either, and I can't imagine they would add anything.

Fabulous salad, with the addition of candied pecans and cheese (I've tried goat cheese and feta - goat cheese is my preference). 3 forks as written, and 4 forks with the additions. I used regular (dark) balsamic vinegar since that's what I had. Will do again.

This salad was only ok for me. I found the tomatoes did not add anything and although it was different it didn't taste different. Sort of middle of the road for me. I'll try something else next time I want a salad with fruit in it

I just made this salad yesterday for a casual bridal shower. I also added the feta cheese and toasted pecans according to the prior review to give it a bit of heft and mellowness. You could probably skip it and it would still be good with the dressing. I think the shallots really contribute to the taste. Everyone loved the salad and wanted the recipe.

Fabulous salad! Easy to make. I would highly recommend using tomatoes and peaches from the farmer's market.

This was delicious and refreshing. The salad dressing was light and fresh tasting. I peeled the peaches 'cuz we hate the fuzz. And since I forgot the shallot, I used red onion soaked in water for 15 minutes instead.

I thought this made for an absolutely delicious salad. The dressing made a fantastic contrast with the sweet peaches and tomatoes. It's important to use ripe fruit so they're sweet enough.

I could only find red tomatoes so that's what I used. I served this with the "Roast Beef Sandwiches with Lemon-Basil Mayonnaise" on this site. They were a hit together for most of my guests. Only one didn't love the savory dressing with the fruit, but I'd serve it again without question. This is hands down a fantastic way to take advantage of the produce of summer!

I made this without a single change and would do it again! Great healthful way to use fruits of the season. The dressing really makes it!

For a salad, this has rich flavor and wonderful heart-healthy ingredients. Sometimes we throw feta or some other type of soft cheese on top. Excellent in summer as a side dish. Made as directed!

VERY tasty & easy!! The peaches were a fabulous addition. Served this w/roast chicken & brown rice for a great, easy weeknite meal.
