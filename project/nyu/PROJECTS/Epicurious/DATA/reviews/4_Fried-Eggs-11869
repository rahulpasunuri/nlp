I too have known how to fry eggs since I was 7. Although my results were consistent, I was consistenly dissatisfied with the texture of the whites. This recipe solved the problem wonderfully. If one likes eggs, this technique for the perfect fried egg is as valuable and will be used more often than any fancier recipe!

Finally, after 15 years of marriage, I can prepare breakfast in bed for my beautiful bride. This recipe also works in a plain stainless steel skillet. Perfect eggs everytime.

While some may view this recipe as silly, there are new cooks who need to know the basics (just out of the house and new to cooking for themselves, newly divorced, recently widowed, etc.). A friend's mother used to make brunch for us on Sundays, and I asked her how she got all the perfect fried eggs to the table at the same time. She used her large electric frying pan, first off. Like this recipe, she would put butter on the bottom and the eggs on top. When the had set a bit, she'd put a little water on top of them and cover the pan. The water, she claimed, helped to cook the eggs by steaming them. If the new cooks in the audience are in need of good basic advice, I would suggest the Fannie Farmer Cookbook and perhaps How to Cook Everything by Mark Bittman, which has many fine recipes for new cooks and established cooks alike.

You know, I've been frying eggs for years (and years...) and sometimes, if I was lucky, they'd come out wonderfully, while other times they'd be overdone or wallered (good old southern term). I used my grandmama's technique, which was to fry the eggs in bacon grease at a fairly high temperature, splashing the grease over the whites to cook them before the yolk got hard. Like I said, mixed results. Tonight I fried eggs using the technique set forth in this Epicurious recipe, and my boyfriend and I ate them over thin steaks. Perfection. Heaven. I'll fry eggs this way forevermore. I don't get the people who sneer at "basic" recipes and condescend to those who use them. It's not such a bad thing, reading about the basics. Read enough and you'll eventually find something you didn't know. Technique can almost always be improved. So people want to learn about and improve upon the foundations of good cooking--is that something to disparage?

This is great! I think I have doing this wrong. Thanks for the basics. I am going to try it tomorrow at brunch.

Just like many others before me, I too just had to see if it really was what is was. At first I thought it was funny since I consider myself quite an accomplished chef, however recipes like this become a necessity after hearing about a distant cousin who's wife just passed away and his brother took a 4 hour flight in just to show him how to make an omlette. Well done Epicurious!

Don't be so hard on this basic recipe, one of my favourite meals is old-fashioned fried eggs. However, I'm 30 years old, and even I didn't know about the unsalted butter (I usually would just use regular butter, Pam, or dare I say it? Shedd's spread!)and I never thought of covering the pan! I'm looking forward to trying this "new" technique the next time I make fried eggs. ~Carol

I also had to look at this...definitely cooking 101. The best part was that this recipe can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.....

I was very surprise to see this recipe. I knew how to make fried eggs when I was 8 years old. But I do keep in mind that there are alot of new cooks out there that was not shown anything about cooking as they were growing up. So even though this recipe may seem stupid to most of us it may also be very important to others.

I couldn't resist looking at this just to satisfy my curiousity that it was really a recipe on how to fry an egg and nothing more! Got a laugh to see it had actually been published in a magazine!
