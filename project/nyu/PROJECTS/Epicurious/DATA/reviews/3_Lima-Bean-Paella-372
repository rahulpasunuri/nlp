Nothing bad about this recipe, just not enough flavor. It was somewhat bland, and it still needed rice in the end.

this was delicious! I doubled the amount of ham and chicken (1/2 cup ham & 16oz chicken) and it turned out really well. I served this over saffron rice and got rave reviews from my lima-loving husband.

I wish there were a rating for "Yuck!" Don't be fooled by the title. There's nothing paella-like about this truly unremarkable dish. It would take so much tweaking to make this recipe worthwhile that it wouldn't be close to resembling the original. Your time would be better spent finding another recipe.

Great recipe! I might suggest a few minor, hardly worth mentioning, changes: Double the chicken and tomatoes...add some Spanish sofrito for added flavor...and, this dish still needed rice. About half a cup at the beginning of the 25 minute cooking period. Hmmmm...still not quite there. Added three tablespoons of quality capers at the end of the cooking time. Stirred them in and tasted...not too shabby.

Seemed like a scant mount of chicken for four people but it worked very well. Stick with the dark meat for flavor and juice. Regular canned tomates will work as well you'll just need to spice it up to taste.
