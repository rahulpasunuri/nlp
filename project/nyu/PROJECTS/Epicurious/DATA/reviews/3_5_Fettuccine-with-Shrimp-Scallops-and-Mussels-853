Not difficult at all and delicious.

My family and I enjoyed this dish. We just returned from a trip to Tuscany and I was looking for something that might match the food we ate while there. Instead of making the homemade croutons, I crushed ready-made herb seasoned croutons on top just before serving. They stayed firmer and added a nice flavor to the dish.

This was a disappointment. The taste is good, but the breadcrumbs seemed to suck all of the moisture out of the dish.

I made this recipe in January of 1996 for my roommates birthday. It was a huge hit. I'm not sure I would say it was that easy, since there are a lot of steps, but it was definitely worth it. I have been searching for this recipe ever since under 'linguine' since that's what I originally used. I'm glad I clued in. There is a lot of basil, which could be reduced if you're not a huge fan.

Next time I'm going to cut back on the basil. One cup is just too much.
