I used this recipe with small Argentinian peaches (about the size of an apricot), and modified the honey cream recipe. It was a huge hit. I used whipping cream, a small amount of buttermilk and some honey, whipped it so that it was thick, but not stiff, and used that as a topping (I made it just before serving). The part about leaving the honey cream out overnight scared me, so I opted to substitute - and it worked well!
