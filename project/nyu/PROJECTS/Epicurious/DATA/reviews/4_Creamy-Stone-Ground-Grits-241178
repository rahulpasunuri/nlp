I used regular grits (not instant) instead of stone-ground and it cooked much faster and tasted fabulous! I halved the recipe because was only serving 3 people, and it was still a lot of grits.

So where does he say to add the salt to the cooking liquid before you add the grits???? To me, the recipe reads that you put in all 2 tsp after they have cooked. So, which is it?

Now I LOVE grits and these grits are fabulous BUT I do have to say that butter is not optional. It is completely necessary to have true southern grits!! The best way to serve grits is to plop a serving in a bowl and cut a nice slice of butter on top. A pool of melting golden butter over a nice bowl of hot grits - there is nothing better. I also have to note that he is right - you must salt the water before adding the grits. Salt makes a world of a difference in the taste.

This morning inspired by the latest issue of Gourmet January 2008, all about southern cooking. I fixed Cre amy Stone-Ground Grits and Low Country Breakfast Shrimp (page 77). I, of course, replaced the Shrimp with tomatoes. The grits are made with half water, half milk, and some butter. Instead of stone ground grits I use Bobs Red Mill Corn Grits they are located in the organic section of your grocery store. For the Low Country Breakfast Shrimp I substituted 3 Roma tomatoes for the shrimp. The dish turned out spectacularly. I have always wanted to go to the Hominy Grill in Savannah, but I dont eat shrimp. This was a perfect substitute. Thanks Gourmet for the inspiration!
