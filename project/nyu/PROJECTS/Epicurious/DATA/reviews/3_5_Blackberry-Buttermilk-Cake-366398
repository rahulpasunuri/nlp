I have to agree with those who wouldn't make this again. I was looking for a recipe to use up some buttermilk I'd bought for something else, and this had the bonus of being able to use those blackberries that got frozen solid when the freezer door got left open. :) Didn't have any horror stories with cake texture, underbaked center, etc. (although it WAS done in about 55 minutes) but for all the butter that went into it, it just didn't have an exceptional flavor, and the texture really suffers after a day. Maybe with an exceptional topping and a lot of it this would be better, but I'll never know.

Please check the time before you make this! 1 hour and 25 minutes was waaaaay too long, in my experience. I checked it, almost as an afterthought, at 1 hour--almost too brown, but not quite--I'd check it at 45 minutes if I made it again--which I won't. It's just not that special. I did not have the problem with the berries making a mush in the pan, as other reviewers have--solved that by measuring berries carefully and spacing evenly in a 10" pan--mine looked pretty much like the picture. But I just didn't find this wonderful--were I doing a cake of this type I would choose the Raspberry Buttermilk Cake or the Blueberry Cornmeal cake on this site--they are truly 4 stars.

I'm not going to rate this but a warning to whoever else tries it: When I unmolded this one, all the blackberries in the center had sunk (risen?)into the batter so it looks nothing like the picture. A few blackberries visible around the rim, and the rest a gummy pale ring, bleah. I'm going to serve it with the browned side up (very brown because I didn't catch the way-too-long cooking time. Don't know what I did, but watch out!

Vikieeaston..I have used lowbush cranberries, lignonberries, and it was wonderful, for Easter I'm going to use rhubarb and preserved nectarines, so far it's been super versatile.

I used 16 oz of blueberries and it was too much. Not enough cake. Flavors were good though. Next time I will only use 10 oz. My cake didn't cook in the middle also, which may be because of too many blueberries. Will try again.

This is a delicious cake! I followed the recipe exactly except for wanting a bigger fruit-to-cake ratio. With that in mind, I used much more fruit (blueberries), a smaller, taller pan (8") to which I added a lesser amount of cake batter. Baked at 350 for 45-50 minutes. A slice of my cake had near equal thicknesses of cake and berries. What extra batter was left made four individual shortcakes for sliced strawberries. Would have given this recipe four stars had the ingredients favored a better fruit-to-cake ratio, but I'm happy with the moistness of the cake and definitely will use this recipe again.

It is winter! Has anyone tried this with fresh cranberries? I think it may be a great holiday brunch addition. It has been a hit for me with blackberries.

The cake in a whole is very good except the part that doesn't cook, I think the springform pan is not the pan to use, this would be more of a 9x13 pan cake. The cake did not cook in the center I wasted 2 1/2 cups of berries. Do not recommend this recipe with the springform pan, use another pan

Rating: 2
The picture looks much more exciting than the actual taste. It isn't a bad cake and its super easy to make, it just seems to lack any excitement from a dessert. Maybe it isn't the cake but the fact that I served it for a dessert. I think it would be more appropriate for a brunch as a coffee cake. I wanted to like it.

Made with blueberries vs blackberries and garnished with some nasturtium flowers, turned out beautifully- tastewise and aesthetically. Leftovers were great with morning coffee. Nice as not overly sweet.

Excellent recipe. 10" springform and it was done in 45 minutes both times I've made it now

This was good, but I'm not as crazy about it as many of the other reviewers seem to be. It's very moist, but I don't know if I'd consider it to be light, like some people have said. The blackberries were a bit too tart for me, and I didn't really like having the seeds there. I probably will make it again, but I'll try it with apples and cinnamon. I might try peaches, too.

This was an easy and very tasty dessert that could also be served at breakfast. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Great cake--perfect for dessert or as a coffee cake for breakfast. Light, fluffy and moist, and the zest of the orange goes really well with the blackberry top. A couple notes: My cake was ready to be pulled out of the oven at 50-55 min, but I also used a 10-inch springform pan to cook it in. I liked the height of the cake more in the larger pan--better cake to berry ratio. :) Now I want to try a cherry-almond combination of this cake!

I made this cake with fresh blackberries from the farmers market for my friend's birthday yesterday. It came out wonderfully. Looked exactly like the pictures from the magazine and it tasted amazing. I substituted lemon zest for orange zest. I pulled the cake out of the oven after 55 minutes. Next time I will take it out after 50 minutes and add more zest. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
This is a great cake that I will use with other fruits. It was described as "light", which I construed to mean fine textured - mine was not which I liked. It was very flavorful and held together on the fork - didn't have to scurry around the plate mashing crumbs with the back of a fork.

Rating: 4
This is an exceptional coffee cake. The cake itself was moist and not too sweet which made it a great foil for the fruit. For the person questioning using half blackberries and half peaches, we haven't done that but the first time we made it, we used not so great blackberries (a great use for blackberries that weren't good enough to just eat out of hand). The second time will be with peaches. It'll be perfectly fine with a combo. This didn't last more than a couple of days in our house but, yes, the longer it sits, the gummier it gets at the top where the fruit and cake meet. Either scarf it all (not difficult) or freeze some ASAP. Although, it's not exactly BAD a little gummy... :)

FYI: I froze some of this cake. Defrosted it yesterday, and it came out great. Highly recommended.

You can use any combination of summer fruits you want. I used blueberries, but peaches and blackberries sounds wonderful. No reason I know of that it wouldn't work out. One thing, do not bake 1 hour 25 minutes. 50-55 minutes, is just about right.

Has anyone made this cake with a half/half mixture of blackberries and fresh peaches? Anyone know something about baking that should keep me from doing this?

Really nice cake this, light yet moist, sweetness balanced with tang from the fruits. It was so good, a housemate stole about a third of it! I didn't measure the fruits I used, but put down enough blackberries and blueberries to completely cover the bottom of the pan, and had blueberries left over, so folded them into the batter just before pouring it. Once inverted, the top looks lovely, like a berry tart, so much fruit!

Just made this for my wife and I. It was exceptional. I substituted blueberries and only cooked it for about 55 minutes. The top was golden brown and the middle was still quite moist. It was perfect in our opinion. Fantastic recipe!

Also great using Huckleberries or wild blueberries in place of the blackberries. A very delicious southern comfort recipe.

This cake tastes great so go ahead and make it. I read the reviews (thank you all) and baked the cake for 1hr but next time, I'll take it out at 50-55 minutes.

I made this cake with blueberries instead of blackberries. The cake turned out pretty good. I would agree with the other reviewers in stating that there is no need for the cake to cook as long as the recipe calls for. Additionally, I cut out the powdered sugar as I don't tend to enjoy powdered sugar. The cake was a bit dry and to compensate I added a scoop of lemon flavored yogurt to the top of each serving, making the cake much more moist. Next time, I am not cooking the cake as long and may add more orange and possibly a bit of lemon zest.

Rating: 4
Instead of orange zest, I used lemon zest. I also added a small sqeeze of lemon. This cake was very moist & it turned out great. Although, the time is way too long. I only kept it in for an hour. If you want the cake to look good, sprinkle the powdered sugar after the cake is cooled. It is a big hit.

This is a 4-star cake,super moist and the light orange flavoring really compliments the blackberries. I gave the recipe 3- stars because if you followed the instructions, you would end up with a dry, burnt cake. 1 hour and 25 minutes is too long to bake the cake. I used a 10-inch cake pan and baked the cake for about 45 minutes.

My 13 year old daughter made this for company and it looked just like the photo! Only thing I would change is the cooking time-we took it out 5 minutes earlier as it was starting to brown a bit too much. Yes, it is a dry cake (think coffee cake), but nothing that a cup of Earl Grey tea couldn't fix. Will make again.

This cake was delicious the first day, but after that it started to get gummy near the berries. It was OK the second day, but after that it was inedible.

Rating: 2
In spite of several other reviewers,I found the cake rather dry. I would not go as far as the reviewer,"A cook from Washington,DC",but had to applied a little blackberry wine on the second day. The cake is easy to make and would be better with blue berries and with some mixed into the batter as well.

I made this for my husband's birthday. the cake is incredible, very moist and flavorful. I will definitely add this to my regular repotoire. I used lemon flavored buttermilk and fresh lemon zest in this. I also substituted blueberries.

This is every bit as good as it sounds like it should be. I used fresh blackberries from the farmers' market, but I think it would be equally wonderful with peaches or raspberries or other summer fruits. The only changes I made were to mock up cake flour with the addition of some corn flour to all-purpose, and lemon zest instead of orange. Don't have the right size springform, so I used a 9" cake pan. Had enough batter left over to make two small gratin dishes as well. Didn't add sugar to the berries on one of the gratins, and actually like that one best. I'm going to make with peaches for a party next week. And did I mention, I hate to bake. But this is worth it.

Rating: 4
Took the advice from some of the other reviewers and watched the timing during baking. Also made sure my ingredients were all @ room temp. I will definitely make this cake again as it super easy and delicious. I didn't have cake flour so I just substituted AP but the texture was still tender and not too dense. A great way to enjoy the berries in season!!!

I've made this cake three times in the past month and it's a hit every time. I've substituted lemon zest for the orange, and have used a mixture of black- and blueberries depending on what's best at the market. I'm thinking of trying cherries next.

first I'm a pastry and baking student and i'm a home owner(52 years old), but I had a new backdoor put in today (86 today in Mystic), my blackberries were ready for picking. This cake first off is very, very easy to make, its very light with a flavor that's hard to put in words and the berries flavor go from top to bottom. I will make this cake many more times. Five forks (I know only 4 but I say 5)

Rating: 4
This cake came out great! Since blackberries are in season here that is what I used. It is important to sift the cake flour before measuring or you will have more flour then required. I also noticed that the top was browning too quickly but that was easily solved with a foil tent placed on top. I am used to working with 3-inch sided cake pans. Sometimes the cake doesn't bake quite the way you want because of the thickness of the batter, but I did not have this problem with this cake. Oh I also banged the pan after pouring and spreading the batter to get rid of air bubbles.

I made this for our 4 of July Celebration too. It was a big hit! The cake has a creamy texture that's moist and delicious, my family loved it. I used blueberries because they were on sale, they worked just fine. I found it to be a very easy cake to make. I followed the direction exactly. I cooked mine for about 1 hour and 10 min. and used a cake tester to make sure it was done. I had read the reviews and knew the timing was off in the direction, so I checked it after about 1 hour. I also used 1 tsp. Fiori Di Sicilia instead of vanilla, it has such a great citrus flavor that went well with the orange zest and the berries.

I used blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. I covered the berries completely with 2.5 cups of brown sugar. Check after 1hr 10min to see if done. I'm at 6000ft altitude so it's different. Cover with powdered sugar right before serving or the sugar absorbs all the berry juice and it's not as pretty.

Great cake. I substituted raspberries since blackberries aren't quite in season yet in Virginia and baked it for 45 minutes. I'll definitely make this again since it was simple to make.

First off -- can someone please come clean up the comments? I get that this user enjoyed the cake on the 4th of July, but I don't need to see it 10 times. More importantly, on the cake front. I wanted to like this cake -- I really did. I've made a similar raspberry buttermilk cake from Smitten Kitchen that was stellar and I expected even more of this. However when I made it to finish off a casual birthday dinner a few weeks ago I was beyond disappointed. The first slice (hours after it had been baked) was ok... but just ok. Not terribly flavorful and a bit dry. Fast forward to the next morning when I thought this would be a great snack with coffee and ugh. The cake dried out entirely and with the exception of the very top part with the berries it was inedible. I followed the direction to a T and was careful to not overbake so I think it's just the recipe. If you want a tasty and tested buttermilk cake, I say try over at Smitten Kitchen ... this one is a bust.

Rating: 3
Like the others I had to extend the baking time. Otherwise I did follow the recipe exactly and had a good result. The cake was very moist, but I didn't expect a decidedly orange flavored cake. Next time I will reduce the amount of zest and perhaps up the vanilla to allow the berry flavor to be the star. I will also try adding boysenberries for an even bigger berry flavor kick to balance the amount of cake in each slice.

Rating: 3
Like everyone else has noted, this looked DONE very early, so I pulled it out. The pretty picture with the dusting of powdered sugar results from putting the sugar on as a garnish after the fact. Meanwhile, I didn't even get to that point before the cake fell apart as I flipped it. Literally crumbled to pieces. I'm obviously not a pastry chef; I have no idea what I did wrong. The taste was lovely, but the texture was DENSE. I obviously beat something too long. Or not enough. I'm sure someone who understands pastry could pull this off, but this isn't a beginner's sort of dish.

I made this for our Fourth of July Celebration. EVERYONE loved it and were fighting over seconds. I can understand the issues others have had with it, so here are a few things to try for success. First, all your ingredients MUST be at room temperature to avoid under-cooked center. Second, cream the butter and the sugar for at least 5 minutes. This is very important for the crumb of the cake. Third, do not over-mix after the last addition of flour. Finally, and most importantly, the baking time in the recipe is way off! DEFINITLEY CHECK THE CAKE AT 60 MINS--IT IS PROBABLY DONE. I baked mine for 65 mins and that was almost too long. Still, the cake was a huge success; I only gave it 3 forks because I found it a bit bland. BTW, I used half blackberries and half raspberries. If you use a 10-inch spring-form pan you will need more than 10oz of berries.

The directions for this recipe were so specific and nit-picky it was almost comical. That being said, I did follow this recipe exactly, and even then it come out poorly. The cake was really brown after an hour...So I took it out early, only to find that the center was soup. I had to bake the cake about 40 minutes more to get the center to set. The result was a gummy, dense mess. The flavors were good, but that's about it.

Looks delish. I also made it on the 3rd for a party on July 4th. The time is way off. I cooked for 1 hour 15 mins and it's really dark. I hope it isn't overdone. I can't decide if i should serve it with ice cream or cool whip or whipped cream.

High Altitude note: I upped the temp to 365, also increased the flour a little and dropped down the sugar a bit and it looks perfect. I agree that the timing is WAY off. This cake was a dark golden brown at 1 hour, and I left it in for a few more minutes to be sure. I made it for a party tomorrow on July 4th ( today is the 3rd) so I haven't eaten it yet, but the batter was delicious! I'm waiting to dust the powdered sugar because I'm convinced the berries will make it a mucky mess if I do it too soon. But it looks and smells amazing. This was also incredibly easy to make and I'm sure I'll do it again.

Great cake! I used low-fat buttermilk and it was still very moist. I couldn't stop eating it ... and my 15 month old wanted more more more! I used the orange zest and it gave it a great fresh flavor. I checked my cake at 1 hour 5 minutes and it was a little too browned on top, but still came out good. Next time I will check earlier and probably take out at 55 minutes to 1 hour.

Rating: 3
This is a beautiful cake but there were some caveats: the powdered sugar that looks so beautiful on the top in the magazine won't look that way in real life because the berries are moist and therefore they suck up the sugar (dissolving it). So, it doesn't look as pretty in real life. Also, the cooking time is WAY OFF. I took it out at 1 hour 5 min and honestly I wish I had checked it earlier because it would have been better if I had taken it out earlier. Also, I used fat-free buttermilk because that was all I had and I don't think it made a difference, the cake was still great.
