The veal where I live is excellent, so I toned down some ingredients -- doubled the recipe, added only 2 tsp lemon peel and 1 tsp garlic; heating plates before hand, it is so convenient to spend just 10 minutes in the kitchen between courses for this- everyone raved! :-)

Good basic dinner, will make it with chicken or maybe thinly sliced pork for a more economical dish.

Too much lemon! I didn't think this worked at all, although my fiance really liked it. There's just too much lemon in the sauce. Veal is pretty expensive--there have to be better ways to prepare it.

This dish turned out well except for the fact that my veal was not very tender. I'm currently blaming that on the butcher, not the recipe. I served it with less lemon and garlic because I was making it for guests who I assumed didn't love both flavors as much as I do. I accompanied the dish with steamed artichokes stuffed with spaghetti squash and gargonzola cheese and topped with a lemon garlic butter sauce. It was great!

My wife really liked this dish and I thought it was okay. Once you get everything chopped, It comes together real fast though. I served this with roasted redskin potatoes, steamed broccoli and a wild mushroom medley. I would definately make more sauce next time.

This is a wonderful and simple dish. The second time around I sauteed shrimp along with the veal, doubled the sauce and served over angel hair pasta.

This recipe worked out really well, but you have to be a garlic lover to really enjoy it. Next time I'll chop the parsley more finely.
