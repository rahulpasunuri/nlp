Definitely won't make again. Toasting the seeds resulted in burning lungs, so that went into the trash. The sauce was alright, a little spicy but otherwise not particularly flavourful. Since I tossed the spices, I made up my own rub, and it was absolutely terrific, try it yourself: Mix together 2 tablespoons pepper jelly (I used Rose City Pepperheads Hawaiian Jalapeno), and 1/4 teaspoon each allspice, cumin, cayenne, chili powder, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and ground mustard.

yeah, same here, i expected it to be spicier, but it still was really good

This was very good but I agree with the other reviewer I expected it to be spicier. I used a leg of lamb instead of a rack and although it didn't have much of a spicy kick the flavor was still delicious. I served with home made tamales.

I was excited to make this dish as it seems Mustard and Rosemary are too often used with rack of lamb.I will make this again, but I was expecting a spicier dish with the chipotle and pepper seeds. Next time more chipotle and 1/2 chicken stock 1/2 water to give the sauce a little more depth. . .also I am going to add a little ancho chile powder in lieu of the allspice or cloves (will have to experiment). Those two plus the anise seed and cinamon have too similar a flavor for me. Even with those three "future changes" I ate 7 chops (they were small) on my own!

This was fabulous. I don't have a spice grinder, so used a mortar and pestle and left a lot of the chile seeds whole, which added to the texture. I served it with Roasted New Potatoes with Spring Herb Pesto and Green Beans with Citrus Butter Sauce which made a nice contrast. Served with Champagne instead of Red Wine as well.. very tasty!

Definitely bound to be a favorite around my house. We love rack of lamb, and we love Mexican and other spicy foods. Followed instructions exactly,although I'm not sure why it calls for ground allspice, when the other spices start out whole. But why argue with success?

I had a rack of lamb, chipotles in adobo sauce and pecans, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I did not have anise seed or cilantro so I substituted star anise when the sauce simmered and removed prior to pureeing in blender. I then added ground coriander to the sauce when I reduced it. I also used a little cinnamon in the spice blend. I tried to stay true to the recipe with the ingredients I did have and found it to be absolutely wonderful. The sauce is really a compliment to the lamb, not masking but instead enhancing its flavor. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the pairing of a 2002 BV Coastal Estates Cabernet Sauvignon was a real match. Extremely simple and can easily be timed for entertaining which I will now schedule because I definately want to make this again.

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times to excellent reviews. I have also used it in a cooking class that I teach. The sauce is fabulous and works with pork and chicken as well as the lamb. I also like the sauce because it is not roux or cream based, but still has a silky appearance and mouth-feel. The heat in the sauce can be adjusted by using more or less minced chipotle and/or adobo sauce. I use guajillo chile seeds and they work as well or better than the pasilla and/or anchos recommended. The chile seeds are not especially hot. I also use a little less anise seed than stated in the recipe. In class I serve this with mashed potatoes and grilled fresh apsaragus.

Im a chef working in the great northwoods for a spell, Lamb is by far one of my favorite Entree's to make and eat. This dish is Fabulous. I made 12 full racks and was sold out by 8:30. Used guaijllo peppers in crust and sauce, plus a little chicken stock and just tightened it up with a slurry and a butter finish.

I had this at a friends house and it was delicious. Although he used a leg of lamb instead of rack. still, good flavour. Great even as left overs.
