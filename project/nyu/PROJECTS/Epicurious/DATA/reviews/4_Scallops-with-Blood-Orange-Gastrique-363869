My review is just for the sauce-will post the rest when I finish, but the gastrique is the most "fancy" part of the whole thing. This was an exceptionally easy-to-make sauce, but a couple of caveats: As several other reviews have noted, be sure to have all your ingredients measured out and ready by the stoveside-the initial steps move FAST! A lot also depends on the quality of your pans and the power of your stove. For me, the sugar melted and was golden in about five minutes total-this may not be the case for you. I used my 2 Qt. All-Clad Copper core, which conducts heat super fast-I always have to be adjusting, though I love, love LOVE my pans. My saucepan has fairly high sides, so the sauce took FOREVER to reduce down to the 1/2 cup the recipe specified-way more than the 15 min. the recipe called for, even with the heat set correctly and a high-power stove, so plan accordingly. It never "coated" the back of a spoon, as was mentioned also by other reviewers, so maybe I'll thicken it up a bit with cornstarch before serving tomorrow for Valentine's Day. But it tastes amazing, and I know it will look awesome across the dish! The sauce darkened up a tad while reducing, more a burgundy color than the red it started out as. This was my first attempt at a gastrique, and it was simple, yummy and pretty. I have a tiny blood orange tree growing in my yard(it's a baby) and I was able to use a a few of my first year's crop for this dish-great bragging rights. I'll look forward to reading others' reviews-let me know if yours came out thicker, and what you did to get it like that. Cheers!

Fabulous and interesting! This was my first gastrique, and it came out very well. Just have everything ready to go and have the steps memorized or at your fingertips. You could easily burn the sugar just going to look up the next step. I followed this true to recipe except I trimmed and quartered the brussels sprouts. Got some nice brown spots on them in a hot pan, but made sure they retained some nice firmness. The classic seared scallop was a huge hit -- really so delicious, and four components really went nicely together and looked beautiful on the plate. Since it was recommended in the notes, I served this dish with the "Creamy Parsnip Mash" on this site, from Apr/2001.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, though I merely quartered the brussels sprouts. In the future, I would double the sauce.

This made for a very simple, elegant, and beautiful appetizer. I, too, found that I had to eventually add a little cornstarch to thicken up the gastrique b/c it just wasn't boiling down to the right consistency, even after the recommended amount of time. I was excited to use blood oranges in cooking for the first time, only to find that in CA they're not available after March. Bummer! The other thing is that even after drizzling the scallops w/ the gastrique, I had a LOT left over. Highly recommend this dish, it's a keeper.

Lovely, but you really MUST use day boat scallops. Other American scallops have had preservatives/plumpers injected and will ooze.

Did this as an appetizer for Easter. Had a hard time finding blood oranges, and then low and behold, I accidentally happened upon them in Target of all places. We also substituted asparagus for the brussel sprouts because we hate brussel sprouts. Followed the direction exactly otherwise, and it came out fabulous. This is now my favorite scallop recipe. The dish was just amazing, and the herb and orange salad just added to the overall amazing and luxurious feel of this dish. It was truly something you would expect at a very fine restaurant. Exceptional.

I loved this recipe. It was my first effort at making a gastrique and I had no problems but I think that more vinegar would have been nice. The scallops were delicious and I, like other reviewers, used asparagus. I couldn't find blood oranges so I used navel and they wee fine. I will make this again!

Gastrique was devine. Made one day in advance but had to dilute a bit more with chicken broth upon reheating to balance out flavor. Made with asparagus instead and skipped the tarragon: the side salad was complementary and dressed it with a squeeze or two of honeybell oranges I happen to have in the fridge. Watched a couple of youtube videos to sear my scallops just right. Got it perfect for my first time, and I used avocado oil, which can withstand high heat, and complemented the dish quite well.

The scallops and orange salad turned out delightful...the brussels sprouts, bleh. I'll definitely substitute asparagus next time. I burnt the sugar on the first try, but the second try came out just fine. I felt it took a little longer to boil down the gastric and I ended up with less than 1/2 a cup to get it to coat a spoon, but it was lovely with the scallops. Oh, I couldn't find blood oranges, so I used a combination of oranges, tangelos, and clementines.

A wonderful recipe -- great combination of flavors and colors, so fresh and pretty and absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe faithfully and served it with a combination of brown/wild/japonica rice. A perfect dinner.

I had very good results with this recipe--a beautiful, showy presentation and the scallops seared nicely. Make sure they are dry--I used a lot of paper towels. I agree that asparagus would work nicely as a sub for brussels sprouts.

This recipe is very impressive, but be warned- the sugar can easily turn into burnt yuck instead of caramel! That said, this is a good recipe to try for special occasions but it is WAY too expensive for everyday. This was my first time cooking scallops, so I followed the instructions to the letter.

VERY tasty and easy too! I thought I was going to be a little intimidated by the gastrique, but how super simple it turned out :-) I used a cast iron skillet for the scallops - rinsed them well, dried them off with paper towels as instructed - a littl S&P...TIP: make sure to heat the skillet up for awhile to get it smokin hot, then pour in maybe a Tablespoon of grapeseed oil (or canola oil...something that can take the high heat). The scallops seared off to perfection. This is a keeper....

To answer your question, Kodojay from NH, after drying the scallops, sear them as directed in a hot saute pan. Heat the gastrique in a separate pan and drizzle it over the scallops once they are on the plate; you will not get a nice crust on the scallops if there is any moisture in the pan.

OMG:This is a wonderful recipe. I substituted arugua for parsley, and also did 1/2 asparagus and 1/2 brussel sprouts. The salad poses interesting and complimenting flavors. I will use blood orange olive oil or meyer lemon olive oil in the future. The gastrique did not thicken as expected so I will add 1 teaspoon cornstarch in the future. What a great flavor! Wish blood oranges were in season all year.

Truly amazing! Made the gastrique early in the day. Dried the scallops as recommended and placed them in a hot pan--didn't move them until it was time to turn them. Warmed the gastrique while the scallops cooked. It all came together so quickly. Brussel sprouts were only OK and were a pain to core and separate. We felt asparagus would work well next time. Used extra oranges for the salad since they were rather small. The plate looked beautiful and everything got rave reviews.

I love the gastrique but I am confused. Do you pat dry the scallops and then dip them in the gastrique and then cook them in th super hot pan? Or do you pour the gastrique into the pan directly? Or do you cook the scallops separate and then pour the gastrique on them on the plate? thanks for any help - the recipe doesn't actually say how the scallops and gastrique interact?!!

The gastrique was delicious. 20 sea scallops is a huge amount for four servings, I used three per person. That may be a mistake in the recipe. I wasn't sure if the sprout leaves were meant to be completely separated or just the core cut out. At any rate, I think I will omit the sprouts next time.
