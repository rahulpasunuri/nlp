So fast, easy and good. Does not even need the cheese. You can add some beans to boost the protein if you feel like it.

This pasta salad gets rave reviews when I serve it! My picky husband likes it because it has no onions. It's a rare pasta salad that doesn't have onions but you don't miss them in this recipe. I use rice wine vinegar as others have suggested and I throw in a handful of shredded mozzerella because the kids like it. It's a really pretty, summery salad!

I forgot to add that I would wait to add basil until the end. I found the warm pasta and corn wilted it a bit.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did follow others' suggestions and used 5 tablespoons rice wine vinegar for a double batch (thus reducing by 1/2) and thought it turned out great. I also sauteed the garlic and added the corn rather than using raw garlic. I like garlic so maybe could have even added more. I used fresh corn and only 20oz of tomatoes (1/3 less than recipe) as I quartered them and it seemed plenty. I added lots of salt and pepper. Yum!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this. As others suggested I used rice vinegar (as that is what I had on hand) and used a 2:1 ratio for the oil to vinegar...isn't that the usual? Very good and we will definitely make this often. Would easily accomodate any fresh or grilled veggies/chicken/tofu you like.

This was delicious! I happened to have some pesto that I'd made earlier in the week so I used it in the dressing but the ingredients and ratios were the same so not really a change. I did add some grilled chicken breast, which we thought was a nice addition, but we would have loved this without the chicken.

WOW!!! This was by far the best pasta salad I have ever had. The flavor was absolutely amazing and I loved it! I did add a few ingredients...avacado, cucumber, and a can of olives. I'm sure it's fine without those things as well though. Thank you Epicurious for another great recipe(:

This is my new "Go To" Pasta Salad. With all the fresh summer flavors, my family cannot get enough of this. I always double it!

EASY and DELICIOUS! It was my first time making pasta salad, and I thought that this was pretty easy. Did what other reviewers did, sauteed the garlic and corn first, but used rice vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. The cherry tomatoes and basil are really important, it gave its color and spice! I also used bow tie pasta and added chicken thighs (marinated: dijon mustard, brown sugar, olive oil). Will definitely make it again!

I loved this recipe. I used 1/4 cup of basil because I thought 1/2 was too much but other than that, I loved it and will definitely make it again!

This recipe has potential, but 5 tablespoons of red wine vinegar is INSANE. My stomach is throbbing as I write this. I will try it again with 2 tablespoons of vinegar, and then I think it will be very good. I'm giving it 3 forks for its potential.

I personally thought this was the worst past salad I'v ever made. I doubled the recipe, and boy am I sorry, I have most of it left. The flavor was bland, I even added pine nuts and fresh mozzarella. Plus I roasted fresh corn, it just wasn't good. Usually, everything I make from Epicurious with over a 90% user rating is wonderful. Skip this salad and try something else.

Rating: 4
I made the recipe almost exactly as is, the only modification being tri-color rotini instead of penne. It had a little too much vinegar for my tastes, but everyone else at my party absolutely loved it. Several people asked for the recipe as well. It's easy, quick and tasty. The fresh ingredients (especially basil) are a must; don't try substitutions that might dilute the flavor. I unfortunately had to use Kraft parmesan cheese instead of fresh (fresh cheese is expensive and hard to find in China!!), so it lacked the nice bite of a strong parm.

Rating: 4
Very easy, appeals to everyone, and delicious. Fresh corn and basil make the recipe! The tomatoes weren't in season yet so I used red pepper instead, and it was great. Also used only one garlic clove. Make sure you don't use too much pasta. I almost used a whole pound but the recipe is only for 1/2 lb. I wonder if that's why some people thought it was bland.

I had some friends over for a picnic and served it. Kids and adults loved it. I made it with rice vinegar instead and added chicken. I will definitively do it again.

I would recommend using 2 SMALL garlic cloves finely chopped. I felt like there was too much garlic, but not enough to ruin the dish (luckily). I also chose to saute the garlic with the corn and that worked out for the best. Another great epicurious recipe!

This was a big hit at a BBQ earlier this summer, even with the picky eater children in attendance. I did saute garlic with the corn and added red onion & feta cheese as suggested by some reviewers.

As is, it's very bland and needs more vinegar, maybe more corn & garlic too. I used fewer tomatoes and it still was too many, in my opinion.

I followed a few suggestions made by other reviewers. I sauteed the corn with the garlic, very yummy, made extra to eat later. I used 4 tbsp rice vinegar and 1 tbsp balsamic, good. I used cubed monterey jack instead of parm, not so good. I think I will use parm next time. I would also use home grown tomatoes if possible. This has a very good fresh flavor, the basil is great.

I used cheese and garlic tortellini instead of the penne, and shallots instead of garlic cloves. It was fresh and very delicious!

Great summer salad!! Highly recommend it with some changes some have suggested: 4T rice vinegar 1 T balsamic (I used a little more even), cubed monterey jack cheese, sauteed garlic w/the corn. This is one you can goof up on here and there and add + or - ingredients and it'll still be good.

Rating: 2
I would give this recipe about a 2 and 1/2. It's not out of this world, but it is good with some adjusting. I used a variety of colored pastas and substituted cubes and crumbles of feta for the cheese suggested. I also used fresh rosemary instead of basil and added red onion. It's a pretty dish and easy too. I think I would increase the garlic next time.

This was the hit of a summer barbeque. I used fresh tomatoes, basil, and corn from the garden. I took the advice of other reviewers and sauted the garlic with the corn, and used the rice and balsamic vinegar. Also, instead of parmesan cheese, I cubed monterey jack and threw it in---delicious!

I am surprised that I didn't like this more! I made many of the changes below - used rice vinegar and balsamic instead of red wine, added toasted pine nuts and feta. The only thing I might have done "wrong" is that I used dried instead of fresh basil. Still, I expected this to be outstanding, and it's only so-so. I also really dislike raw garlic, so if anyone else is in the same boat I suggest sauteeing it first or leaving it out.

Wow! Made the recipe with all the changes the viewers suggested before me. Cooled all the ingredients before mixing together. Used 4 T. rice vinegar and 1 T. Balsamic. Cut the parmesean to one quarter cup and added about one third cup Bulgarian feta(milder). It was fabulous! So thanks to all of you, I have a new favorite pasta salad recipe!!!

I was looking for a pasta salad recipe that did not include mayonnaise, and this was perfect! I used fresh corn, since it's in season. I also used farfalle instead of penne - just to make it more interesting. It was daring to make for a party, but everyone seemed to enjoy it. Even my finicky child loved it! I will definitely make this again.

Simple, elegant and tastes wonderful. What's not to like? My only regret is not having my own garden fresh basil, corn and vine ripened tomatoes. It could only get better with fresh ripened to perfection ingredients. After reading the reviews I might just have to try one thing. I'll try grilling a few ears of fresh corn for a touch of color, flavor and smokiness. I did have to substitute dry basil for fresh (December in Iowa don't ya know). It still turned out very nicely.

I have made this recipe so many times and everyone loves. I have to admit, I have always left out the corn. It just didn't seem necessary. Since most of the reviews are in favour of it, I may just add it next time. Also, I like to add black olives and sometimes diced red pepper. Just a suggestion.

Rating: 2
As printed, the hot corn and the hot pasta are dumped over the basil, turning it black and flavorless. It wasn't very good. If I try this again, I will add the corn and pasta to the dressing first, then fold in the tomatoes and basil. I made this for a family party and have far too much left over.

Superb summer salad recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer and added chunks of deli salami and pine nuts. I cooked the garlic with the corn and pine nuts until soft as I prefer the texture and flavor of cooked versus raw corn. Next time I will add red pepper to the corn for added color and toss small chunks of mozzarella di buffala with the pasta at the end.

This is a fabulous salad. I always try to look for things that are difficult to make because I think they will present at the table with a bigger impact, but that was not necessary in this case. The simplicity of the flavors is what makes them so intense and delicious. I sauteed my garlic with the corn (used frozen and it worked fine) but that was the only change to the recipe I made. Served it at a summertime barbeque picnic with grilled herb chicken and green salad.

Wow! I am not a tomato fan but this salad is to-die-for. Perfect for summertime. I used sweet white corn against the basil, tomatoes and vinegar. This salad was easy, excellent and very flavorful. Next time, if I use pre-cooked corn (canned or frozen) I won't saute it because I like it on the crisp side.

What a fantastic accompaniment to barbecued baby-back ribs! I doubled the recipe for an 8-member dinner party, and VERY little remained afterwards! I took liberties with the basil (adding more than called for in the recipe), as well as the parmagianno. Likewise, I used whole grape tomatoes rather than chopped roma/plum tomatoes ... a really nice addition. For the dressing, I added a little dijon mustard and a small amount of sugar (to cut the acidity of the red-wine vinegar)--perfect enhancements to a marvelous "flavor chord!" I will be making this again in the very near future.

I don't know if this is entirely fair because I made a LOT of substitutions but it turned out GREAT and was a perfect accompaniment to our fall picnic along the coast. For starters, I used a spicy hot pepper penne and since I didn't have corn or tomatoes on hand I substituted julienned carrots and diced red pepper. I also added lots of fresh cracked pepper and used dried basil because I didn't have fresh. I also omitted the garlic since the penne was so spicy. Fabulous!!

This was a wonderful recipe. I don't like most pasta salads, but this was an exception. It was extremely easy...The corn and tomatoes I used weren't especially delicious, but the results were great.
