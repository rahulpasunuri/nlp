This dish turned out well for me but the recipe needed some tweaking to make it more flavorful. I didn't want to make such rich eggs, so I used half the butter and cream in the recipe. For the crab, I used pre- cooked Alaskan king crab legs from the fish counter at the grocery store. I heated them up by taking them out of tthe shells and steaming them directly over the pot where I boiled the asparagus (took the asparagus out with a slotted spoon.) Finally, I used red pepper flakes along with the black pepper and salt, which enhanced the flavor of the eggs and was a nice contrast to the crab. I also tried squeezing lemon over the dish, which was good too. If you like egg dishes, crab and asparagus, make this dish but be prepared to modify it to add more flavor and suit your taste.
