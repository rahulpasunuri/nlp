Forgot to mention that I served with rice and sautéed asparagus which was a nice complement.

I made this recipe except for the following changes: Used tilapia instead of flounder Used parsley instead of cilantro and only had one jalapeño. Added cayenne pepper to the sauce at last minute Did not fold the filets... Didn't seem like they would cook well, so I flipped them which was fine. Was okay. My husband liked the "subtle flavor". Not a must-have

Simple with wonderful flavor. I was a bit skeptical using all the seeds of a jalapeño pepper as I only added a few. Next time I will use the entire pepper. Yum yum. .........can't say enough about this recipe

Wow! Simple and wonderful! Was planning on adding garlic like the previous reviewers suggested, but forgot - did not need it at all. Made it exactly as outlined. Makes a wonderful presentation when served over a pile of white rice. Made the Baja Slaw (also from epicurious) and had a quick meal that I will be making again and again. Wondering if I could substitute coconut milk in lieu of the cream - will try in the future

AMAZING! My plate was licked clean. Use at least one clove of garlic, and saute the jalapenos if they are too hot for your taste. I served with asparagus, although I think spinach would be delicious as well.

good dish with a very unique flavor. I coated the flounder with a mixture of cornmeal and flour and sauteed it, then kept in a warm oven and poured the sauce over instead of cooking the fish in the sauce. this made the fish a little crispier. After sauteeing jalapenos and green onions in the same pan used for the fish, i added 1/4 cup of dry sherry and 1/4 cup of chicken stock and let it reduce before adding the cream. my boyfriend ate his own large portion and then half of mine. it was delicious.

Very good. Added 2 minced garlic cloves to the chopped scallions (saved the green parts for sprinkling on top of the finished dish)- silly to reserve for another use and they add a nice bright garnish to dish. No cilantro on hand so substituted fresh parsley.

Used salmon (no flounder at the market). it stood up well to the sauce. this has a surprisingly sophisticated taste for something so quick and easy to make. the mixture of cream & jalapeno was very tasty. DH doesn't like whole tomatoes so I threw some left-over spaghetti sauce in at the end. This is now a week-night staple.

I made this just as described and my whole family LOVED it. If you cook the cream sauce a little longer than it calls for, it thickens up nicely. quick, easy delicious......perfect.

I really enjoyed this, the second time i made I added an avacodo with the tomatos and cilantro, this gave a very nice flavor w. the jalapenos.My guest loved it..

Thought this was pretty good and has potential. Sauce was not thick enough for my taste and needed something.Used Thai chilis (max amount) so it was a bit spicier than I had planned. I had a side dish with chili powder in it that mixed into the sauce and made it tastier. Will try adding about 1/2 tsp next time. Very easy weeknight dinner.

Had all these ingredients so gave this a try. Shouldn't have bothered. Plain, old sauteed flounder would have been better.

I use this recipe over grilled salmon and am going to try cooking halibut in the sauce instead of flounder.

It was delicious with flounder, but we used the sauce on grilled salmon and it was even better.

Typically when a recipes say "reserve for another use" as with the scallion greens here, it means "keep them if you want to use them in another recipe". Heck, their just scallion greens, they could just be discarded. Hope that helps.

Didn't find anything special about this recipe and made it just as written. Only reason I wouldn't make it again is because there are many better recipes out there to be tried (in my opinion). Wasn't bad, but wasn't a keeper.

Turn out good even though I put the green part of the onion in the sauce...Hopefully I did it right. Very good. I used salmon instead of flounder. Worked out well.

I am making this tonight so we'll see what happens. What are you supposed to do with the reserved green part of the onion?

This simple dish is really delicious. I found some nice red jalapenos, I used about one tablespoon, and the spicyness was just right. I substituted regular ripe chopped tomatoes and the texture of the sauce was just right. This is a very easy, no fuss delicious fish recipe. I will certainly make it again.

We loved this. Used about 1 1/2 T of jalepeno, not too spicy we thought. Also had plum tomatoes on hand, which I used rather than grape, just seeded and chopped to approximate size

I loved this recipe but I would be careful with the amount of jalepeno. I used 2 tablespoons and it was very hot!
