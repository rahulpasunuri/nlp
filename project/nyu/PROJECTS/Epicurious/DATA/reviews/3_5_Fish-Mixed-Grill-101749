Anyone who loves shellfish can never go wrong when cooking them on the grill. However, I did marinate the shrimp and scallops in a lock and seal bag with good olive oil, sliced garlic and large slices of lemon zest (lemon juice may have started the 'cooking' process) while I prepared the rest of the meal. We used langastino instead of lobster and omitted the white fish. Anyone who has tried to grill sole knows it flakes apart easily, so I would suggest using a firm fleshed white fish such as cod or halibut. Since I have never had flounder, I can't verify its firmness. I also used two skewers to secure the shrimp and scallops when turning. We served tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, melted butter and lemons for the fish. We also served grilled corn on the cob and other vegies from the garden, a simple salad of tossed baby greens, sliced vine ripened tomatoes straight from our garden and warm crusty bread with butter on the side. Except for the salad, virtually everything else was done outdoors. It's a perfect way to kick back with friends on a late summer afternoon.
