This was definitely the star of the meal. Delicious! Served with grilled salmon over pilaf and a Pinot Noir from Carneros. So good, we are serving it over grilled steaks the very next night. This recipe is definitely going into my recipe box.

So lovely to prepare and even lovelier to eat. I let it reduce a little longer for a more syrupy finish. delectable!
