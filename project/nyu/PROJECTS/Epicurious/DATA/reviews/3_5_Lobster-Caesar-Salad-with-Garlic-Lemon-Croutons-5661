For the cook from Baltimore, I don't know if they fixed whatever it was that you didn't understand or if you don't understand 1/4...that's one-fourth of a cup, just in case.

Not sure the dressing measurements are correct-very, very garlicy and thick-only 1/4 cup of oil? Also, not crazy about celery root in a ceasar salad

Absolutely delicious! This recipe is worth saving for the Caesar dressing alone. I've experimented with many Caesar recipes and the proportions are just about right. I personally add a bit more fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon mayonnaise (to replace the raw egg and adds a touch of creaminess), and lots of fresh cracked black pepper. The addition of the fresh lobster is the only thing that could make a "real" Caesar salad even better. The Garlic-Lemon Croutons are also a very nice addition - I like them a lot better than the often over-seasoned caesar croutons.

Can't afford lobster, but I used the salad dressing recipe...it's exceptional!

I agree, the dressing is delicious (and easy)!

This is a clever and delicious take on a caesar salad. I normally subscribe to the 'no cheese with shellfish' rule, but this is a notable exception. the dressing is marvelous. The croutons were just lovely. I was especially pleased with the recommendation to substitute parsnip for celery root which is so hard to find in my area. One note: unless this is the only course, it makes an enormous amount for 4 people. Three of us enjoyed it as a salad course prepared with about 3/4 of a lobster.

reserve how many cups of lobster juices from bowl? I'm Sorry if this sounds dumb but I don't know what that symbol means.

The salad dressing is great, whether you use it with the lobster, chicken, or just plain! Very easy to whip up in a blender.
