Used white balsamic vinegar and substituted Maui onion for the shallot and a very good olive oil. Would use more mint and as other reviewers note add it shortly before serving. Ditto for peas-- I used frozen petite peas from the freezer. Only salad at a picnic for 40 that was gone!

I have made this potato salad a couple times and it is addicting! There is something about that mint! I've never added the peas.I agree with another reviewer, some mint is more mild and the stronger mint works best in this recipe. I prefer to add some garlic to this salad also. Fist time I used fresh minced garlic, next time was powdered; Both were delicious.

Delicious and light, for a potato salad. I substituted white onions for the shallots because that's what was in the fridge. I also added some chopped red pepper. The sweet flavor and crunchy texture was a nice compliment.

Really good, healthy potato salad. Used fresh peas from my CSA box.

I made this twice now. the first time the fresh mint I used was strong and came through very well. The next time it was a different mint and didn't make as much impact

Made exactly as written (well, bit more mint and a small sprinkle of sugar) and was excellent - served with Lamb Loin chops - great hot or cold.

YUM!! This is an amazing potato salad. I used a mixture of red, white and purple potatoes (using up whatever I had around), which made for a really beautiful presentation. Also I only had a can of peas on hand.. worked perfectly. Added a bit of dried tarragon and had to use rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Very delicious and pleasantly unusual dish.

I made this for our 4th of July BBQ yesterday and guest couldn't get enough of it. The snap of the pepper was perfectly complemented by the fresh mint and peas. Delicious! Can't wait to get home and have some for dinner.

This recipe was a little unusual and nothing fantastic, but was tasty enough. Upon testing the dressing I felt it needed a little white sugar to cut the vinegar but otherwise the recipe is ok as written.

I agree with previous reviews, this is an awesome recipe, simple and delicious. I used a lemon infused olive oil which added a subtle lemon flavor. Per previous reviewer, add mint at the last minute to keep the bright color.

Came out great. I left out the peas from the recipe because the wife and kid don't like them and it still tasted great. This dish was great with southern fried chicken and roasted asparagus bundles.

I made with white balsamic - yum

I made this with basil instead of mint and minced scallions instead of shallots and a combination of rice wine and rice vinegar because I didn't have mint, shallots, or white wine vinegar. It was still delicious and will be a staple this summer. Meg

I have to agree with the reviewer who said this was "retardedly" simple but delicious. I made it because it looked interesting and I had all the ingredients but I had no idea it would taste so good. I had fresh peas that I blanced in the potato water for about 30 seconds, but raw would have been good fine.

This dish is delicious and easy, but elegant. I've made it twice now, and it's very pretty if you use a mixture of yukon gold, purple, red, baby and new potatoes. I've made it ahead both times and found it needs a bit more dressing added on day two. It's definitely worth the trouble to shell and cook fresh peas.

Man oh man, this recipe is so retardedly easy, and it tastes superb! The flavours just mingle and balance out perfectly- and I love how the peas kind of soak up the vinaigrette then burst between your teeth in a tangy, herbacious little tap dance!

A delicious, quick, easy, and popular dish! Best of all it is so much healthier than traditional potato salad. I will definately be making this one again!

A great twist on traditional potato salads. I omitted the mint because I did not have any on hand and it was delicious without it.

I didn't think the recipe sounded special enough to try, but I did, and it was very, very good! I had it for guests, and everyone really liked it. The peas and mint together are very tasty, and I used a combo of yellow fingerling, purple and red potatoes, and it was a pretty salad. One thing, add the mint at the last minute, as it had a tendency to turn brown on the edges as it sat in the salad.

The flavor in this is excellent. Because it doesn't have any ingredients that will spoil quickly, it's a perfect potato salad for picnics. The recipe doesn't suggest chilling the salad, but I like it best cold.

This is a good potato salad for those who like the flavor of mint. I have mint growing in my garden like crazy and am always trying to get my family to try new dishes with mint in them. Figures that after trying this dish, they still only want to see mint in their mojitos. A substitution of parsley or cilantro for the mint would work.
