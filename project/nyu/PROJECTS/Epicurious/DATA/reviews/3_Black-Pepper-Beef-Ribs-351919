I had a problem reading the recipe. What juice into what sauce? I didn't go any further.

One of the highest flavor-to-effort ratios of any recipe I've tried. Next time I'll probably try increasing either the temperature or the time slightly; the ribs were plenty tender, but not ideally so.

I was somewhat scared off by reviewers who said the meat was dry and overly peppery, so I baked it covered with foil for the first two hours and backed off on the rub. At the end of six hours,it seemed a quite moist and a bit on the bland side, suggesting that the original recipe was closer to the mark. I decided to cut the slab into individual ribs and finish them on a charcoal grill. The end result was quite tasty, and not bad for a $5.25 investment (half the recipe). There is definitely something to this recipe, and it is worth further experimentation. I am thinking that 5 hours in a slow oven plus 1-1 1/2 hours indirect grilling might be very interesting.

I agree with Berkley, i followed to the letter, because i have not had much success with Beef ribs in the past, preferring my recipe for Pork ribs, but was intrigued by the Long slow dry heat method, and was not disapointed at all, they were wonderfully flavoured and as tender as the pork ones i make! I did however get a really good quality of beef ribs, i think that was the key.

I agree with a previous reviewer. The aroma of the ribs cooking was wonderful but the taste was disappointing. I rescued the ribs by adding the ribs, cooked dry lima beans to the clay cooker along with homemade beef broth, chopped carrots, celery, and onion and cooked at 400 F for 2 hr. Refrigerated overnight to remove the fat, added to a large saucepan along with 2 tsp fresh thyme and chopped kale and cooked until kale just tender and still bright green. Seasoned with 1 tsp dry mustard and red wine vinegar to taste. The meat fell off the bones and the combination was really tasty. Therefore, I gave the recipe 3 stars for a good start to a hearty winter stew.

I followed the recipe for the rub, but used beef short ribs instead of beef back ribs and changed the cooking time and temperature because of the comments from another review (dry). I followed cooking directions for other rib recipes. I cooked them for 2.5 to 3 hours at 275. They were EXCELLENT. Very moist and tender. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Well, obviously this recipe is so simple that there was very little to change or add without making something completely different. I had a little trouble holding my oven at 200 degrees, but it never went above 250 for the entire 6 1/2 hours. The ribs smelled fantastic while cooking, but I was a little disappointed. They were not tender, still somewhat tough and definitely not "fall off the bone". The flavor was good, with the black pepper overshadowing the sugar and paprika completely. My husband liked them much better than I did - I would have given 1 star for just OK.
