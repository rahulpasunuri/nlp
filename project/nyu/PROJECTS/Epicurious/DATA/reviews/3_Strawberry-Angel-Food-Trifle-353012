Made this using both frozen and fresh strawberries, but I must say it was not great. Trifle should be light and sweet, but the weight of the yogurt imparts a heavier, cheesier texture, and a much tarter flavor, which some might like, but not me. I am all for easy, but subbing in whipped cream, very lightly sweetened is not much harder than adding yogurt. The angel food is nice, and more fruit is always an improvement. Also, if you insist on the healthy route, perhaps using vanilla yogurt, which is a bit sweeter than plain, might give it a lift.

So easy!! Mixed nonfat with 2% gave it a nice texture. Used frozen berries instead and added fresh mango great combination. My guests loved it served in individual martini classes.

Easy to make for sure, but rather ordinary.

I just made this for one of the desserts served at our Family Christmas (early), of 8 kids (3-11) and 18 adults. To a person it was a hit! I bought frozen straberries in a tub, not a bag, and let them thaw overnight, skipping the extra sugar. Also I used 1 1/2 Angel-Food cakes, sliced sideways in thirds, then torn into small pieces for easier eating and more surface area. After each layer of cake, I brushed the cake pieces with apricot nectar, just to moisten, not soak. I stirred the Greek yogurt (something we all like anyway) in a bowl, to smooth its consistency, before putting it in the triifle dish. This would be great fun in parfait glasses, too. The refreshing frut flavors and lightness of the cake and yogurt complemented the "comfort food" of the beef tenderloin, pickled shrimp, homemade scalloped potatoes, peas in cream and other delicious dishes at table this year.

This is simple and easy to make and low cal to boot. I've also used fresh peaches. Guests always rave and the gals are especially appreciative of the great fresh flavors without the big calories. Definitely a summer keeper.

Completely underwhelmed. Not healthy enough to warrant the lack of yumminess. Not tasty enough to stand on it's own merits.

I'm a foodie and I design recipes. This is a simple recipe and my friends loved it. It's not your typical trifle filled with a zillion calories...it's healthy and tastes fresh and not too sweet or over processed. I made a few changes to my liking. I used organic frozen strawberries for the syrup and macerated them. The frozen berries have a bit more moisture to them and are better to work with over the stove. I used seasonal fresh cut strawberries and blueberries in the layers. I added a 1/4 tsp organic vanilla bean extract to the 2% Fage Greek Yogurt (..which btw greek yogurt has a lot less fat and calories and is super-good for you). This is the second time I have made it and my guests love it! Perfect for summer.

This will be my second time making this trifle, last time it was for a dinner party and every one loved it. I added a little bit of whipped cream on top for a finishing touch. I have made trifles before but this has been the easiest one.

I made this for a party last night, and it is not a good recipe. There are plenty of easy dessert recipes that look and taste much better than this one. I can't imagine that anyone thinks it's good.

This was so easy to make and its a great summertime dessert. I make it all the time now and never have any leftovers. If I dont have any yogurt I just use cool whip fat free and it still tastes great.

This was a quick crowd pleaser. It was the last minute bonus dessert at our 4th of July BBQ this past weekend (the one you only make if all the other prep is going well and you actually get to shower more than 5 minutes before guests arrive!). I have quite a large, wide trifle bowl, so I roughly doubled the recipe. I couldn't imagine using frozen strawberries in the middle of summer, so I macerated about 2 lbs of fresh strawberries with about 3 TBS of sugar about 8 hours before I assembled the trifle. I used 2 store bought angel food cakes, and 16 oz of whole fat Fage Greek Yogurt, and 16 oz of their 2%. The difference in texture was evident during assembly, but not during tasting. The whole fat yogurt was much thicker and harder to spread, I think next time I will use all 2%. I would probably also go with another 8 oz of yogurt and at least another lb of strawberries, if not 2 lbs. Given a few extra minutes this would have looked nice garnished with some fresh mint and a decoratively sliced strawberry, but as I finished guests were arriving (and raving!). I will be making this again for sure. Enjoy!

Very simple and very good.Added blueberries with the strawberries and they worked great. Also made whipped cream to put on top and that worked well too. Will definitely make again.

Super easy and different take on usual trifle. Added blueberries to make it complete.

I found this recipe to be a little vague. It doesn't specify if the yogurt should be favored or plain. I also used a full 32 ounce container of yogurt. I'm letting it soak in the fridge overnight before serving.
