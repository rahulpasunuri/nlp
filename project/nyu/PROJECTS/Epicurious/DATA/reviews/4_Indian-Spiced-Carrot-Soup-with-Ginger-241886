I love this recipe with a few modifcations as mentioned: I use dry spices and double the amounts. I substituted 1.5 cups of broth with light coconut milk. Also, the last time I made it, I used half carrots, half roasted butternut squash (that I happened to be roasting for another recipe). The result was amazing! Velvety, rich, filling, super tasty. But even just with carrots it really is superb.

Pureed veggies soups are a big hit in our home and I had high hopes for this based on the other reviews. But we were disappointed with the end result. I did double the spices as others had suggested since I had a mild curry powder, and old coriander seeds. It had a well balanced spice profile but I didn't think it was the best compliment for the carrots. We prefer the Joy of Cooking's Butternut Squash Soup recipe. A similar soup with subtle flavors but absolutely delicious (squash, leek, ginger and garlic).

Delicious made exactly as specified in the recipe. "Velvety" is the right word for this satisfying and flavorful soup.

I doubled the amount of ginger and added approx 4 cloves of garlic and this was wonderful. We found that it did need a little milk, coconut would have been preferred, but as we didnt have any on hand, a splash of Horizon's organic 2% helped even out the flavors. Wonderful soup! Already can't wait to make it again!

Delicious, even when I messed up! I had ground coriander and mustard so I thought I should halve the amount I put in...next time I'll do the opposite and double the spices instead. I also added some cayenne (which this soup *needs*, in my opinion) and I added a teaspoon or two of Better Than Bouillon chicken base. I can't wait to make this again with garlic or coconut milk as others have suggested!

Exceptional soup! Warms the heart on a cold snowy day. I used high quality spices in this soup, that I ground just before adding to heated oil, really makes a difference. Very filling soup, next time I will add a little coconut milk, but this soup really doesn't need it. Freezes well.

We had this delicious carrot, ginger, coconut milk soup on vacation and iI found this recipe to try to emulate it. Wow, super good! I added 1/2 can or so of coconut milk and it makes it really rich and delicious. I also used coconut oil instead if peanut oil, because that's all I had, I am sure it doesn't make much of a difference. I used ground coriander and ground mustard from the get-go also.

I'm giving 4 forks to my version of this recipe, which was AMAZING! It is unbelievably smooth and tasty. Changes: used ground mustard, olive oil instead of peanut oil, doubled the curry and ginger, and added 1/2 can of reduced fat coconut milk during the puree process (I can't imagine making this soup without it). I will be making this many, many more times.

Rating: 4
I didn't notice the coconut milk option, but added it after tasting -- the soup was begging for it. I also added a smidgen of sugar to balance the lime's acidity and used ghee* instead of peanut oil. *One tablespoon only, a little goes a long way.

My go to recipe when my CSA overloads me with carrots. Like the reviewers before I double spices and ginger and add a fat clove of garlic. I also add a small potato, and when I check for salt and pepper i usually add cayenne pepper.

I wasn't totally crazy about this soup but the raves my husband and guest gave it changed my mind.i did make a few changes to the recipe though: added garlic, didn't have mustard seeds so replaced them with some fennel seeds and a little prepared mustard (felt a little weird, but the seasoning was still great). Spaced out, may have added the curry powder twice, added some crushed pepper. Lemon instead of lime. Served with cashews, a great addition. I love epicurious. Almost all of the recipes come out great even with major changes.

It is insane how good this was. I tripled the spices (seriously), added garlic, and a couple tablespoons of tomato paste. Skipped the lime. Used chicken bouillon. Unbelievably good. Will make this like 1000 more times.

Love this soup! As previous reviewers, I doubled the spices and ginger, added garlic, and 1/4 c of coconut cream at the end. Used kaffir lime leaves for lime peel. Did not need yogurt. Velvety for sure and delicious. Used hand blender and it was super easy. I also added some cayenne, and topped with fried onions.

Delicioso! Had way too many carrots and this recipe was a fantastic solution to my problem. Used the coconut milk and doubled the spices as suggested by other reviews. Garnished with a dollop of sour cream, lime zest. Loved sooo much bought more carrots.

Pretty good! I followed the recipe almost exactly (veg oil instead of peanut oil, and mustard powder instead of freshly ground mustard seeds) and, while I found it to be a little mild on spices, my Indian grandmother enjoyed it (which is an enormous seal of approval). I will make this again.

Rating: 4
I didn't mean to click the rating because I didn't cook this recipe as written. I double the spices, ginger, lime peel, and lime juice and added the coconut milk as recommended. This went over really well at an Indian food themed potluck we went to. At least two of the people raving about it hate cooked carrots - one of which was my husband. The flavor and texture were superb even before adding the coconut milk, and out vegan friends could enjoy it again. I will definitely make this again!

Second time I made this dish. Used recipe as is but i doubled all spices, Lime rind, and lime juice. Did not see a need for coconut milk. Velvety consistency, and after letting it sit over night, flavors mellowed a bit and became a more layered taste experience. Would definitely make this again. Took about 3 hours from start to finish (including cleanup).

Delicious and velvety! Yes, double the spices, unless you have very strong high-quality spices. My modifications: I used mustard powder and it worked fine. I halved the peanut oil and skipped the coconut milk suggestion to make it healthy--still WONDERFUL.

Very good. Agree completely with doubling the spice. Substituted prepared mustard for seeds. Probably needed some more heat given that. Used 4 cups of stock for slightly thicker soup.

Many thanks to all previous reviews submitted. I knew you couldn't all be wrong. Doubled the spices & ginger and added 1 can of coconut milk while pureeing. Smooth and delicious; lime juice was the perfect subtle tang this soup needed. Perfect starter to a more vibrantly spiced Indian dish. I'm keeping this one in my recipe box!

Rating: 3
This is very good: tasty, light, and healthy. Everyone is right about doubling the spices - I did this straight off and might even consider doubling them yet again as it tastes much blander than your typical Indian soup. I also substituted cumin for coriander (since I had none) and whole seeds because most Indian recipes have you pop the seeds in oil and that would not have been possible if I'd followed directions. They got ground later in the puree step. This would have been good with coconut milk but I didn't go there bc I'm on a diet. You could also make this with cayenne for a spicy soup.

Very tasty with the spices doubled. Added a little coconut milk as well while pureeing and skipped the yogurt since I don't like it. Enjoyed it with some crusty bread. Will make again.

Very good! I followed as the reviews said and doubled+ the spices. I did not use broth, in order to cut down on the sodium. It was still very flavorful! I also added fresh pressed garlic and bay leaves while it cooked, as well as added coconut milk before pureeing. Yum!

Got a chance to use my mortar and pestle tonight (for those spices). As others have suggested, I doubled the spices, ginger, lime rind and juice. Best of all, I made the decision to add a can of coconut milk prior to using the hand blender to puree. Unbelievably good. A keeper.

I went looking for a carrot soup recipe to rival my favorite purchased soup, Pacific (brand) Cashew Ginger Carrot, in an attempt to control the sodium. So my changes are based on that.. homemade no salt chicken stock & no added salt. I agree that more spices are needed especially if you dont use salt. The first time, I topped with the yogurt. The second time, I thinned the soup with unsweetened coconut milk. Which ever way I make it, its going into the rotation. I cant wait for fall & homegrown carrots.

I missed all of the reviews buried back there that recommended doubling the spice. Yes. Double the spice. If you don't you will have a big pot of hot carrot water. At least that's what round one of our soup tasted like. I let the failed first batch sit for the night and the next day added another onion sautéed in a generous amount of the same spices and the results were much better. The soup is still a little lackluster, especially for being "Indian." Next time I will be experimenting with chili spices to get some kick in there.

I'm not leaving a rating since I'm not sure I've liked carrot-ginger soups I've had in the past; I suspect if you generally like carrot-ginger soup, this is a good recipe. Like other reviewers, I recommend doubling the spices and ginger. Also, be sure you grate the ginger; I chopped it and ended up with stringy pieces of ginger in the soup, which certainly didn't contribute to its appeal!

Delicious and simple! We only wished that the soup had made more. Our one alteration was using ground coriander and ground yellow mustard since that is what we had in our spice rack.

I don't like cooked carrots or carrot soup, but this is amazing. It's become a tradition as a light lunch on Thanksgiving day. The soup keeps well and has wonderful flavor that is enhanced by adding the lime juice at the end. Serve it with lime wedges for the best effect.

I usually only prepare really simple recipes. Since we had several kilos of carrots picked from the farm, I decided to be more adventuresome with my son and family during the holiday. While, for me, the recipe when followed exactly, was challenging, I managed to pull it off. The reviews from family were raving -- they asked me where they could get the recipe. I wonder if letting it mellow in the refrigerator for a couple days actually enhanced the flavors. To a sensitive palate (non-smokers) the amount of spices was perfect.... I blended it with an immersion blender (my first experience with one of those). It was just lumpy enough to give it some personality. Now, I am researching immersion blenders to add one to my "tool kit."

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe to the "T", however my Cuisinart needed a new blade. So the texture was not smooth. I would say the soup was ok. THEN!! I pulled the soup out of the freezer after Thanksgiving and ADDED: Chopped Turkey, Minced Garlic & Pampered Chef Asian Spice. WOW!! What a difference that made. So if your reading this trying to decide to make it. DO, and try what I did or be creative!! Good Luck!! Great way to use up a lot of carrots!!

Rating: 1
This recipe just had something missing. I eat a lot of Indian food and I love the flavors so I thought this would be great. After cooking it I kept trying to pin point what it needed. There was something bitter about it (maybe the lime zest?) so I added sugar and more broth, didn't help. Increased the spices and it still was just lack luster. Finally I remembered I had left over curried pumpkin soup (also on epicurious and delicious) and I added it to the soup. This made it so much better. I still added a bit more sugar and a ton of salt and more chili powder to contrast the added sugar. I am finally satisfied with the soup, but I would not make this again.

Unlike everyone, I cut the ginger down to a fraction, even though I like ginger, because I'm tired of the ubiquitous carrot-ginger soup dominated by ginger. I followed the recipe re the other spices, ground whole seeds, and the balance was just right. Also I used ghee instead of oil--it's just better.

I've tried many different recipes for carrot soup, from Epicurious and from other sources, and this is one of the very best. I did double all the spices (I do that with most recipes anyway). Served as a first course at a dinner party featuring Indian cuisine, to rave reviews . . . .

I am going to make this soup today and am really looking forward to it with all the rave reviews, always looking for healthy soups to make and freeze. I'm interested to see if anyone has ever used this as a base and added more veggies (brocc, cauliflower), or chicken...I'm just trying to pack in the nutrients with more veggies versus just carrots (I KNOW it's carrot soup :), trying to make it a meal, with a little protein and even more vitamins.)

This year I received a lot of carrots in my CSA box. I've made this soup again and again. It's light enough to eat on a hot summer day and substantial enough to eat on cold autumn day. I usually double all of the spices. (today I added a tbs of curry by accident -- it's still fantastic). It's beautiful to look at and freezes well.

I also doubled the spices and ginger, and used olive oil instead of peanut oil. The recipe was fantastic! I think the lime zest tops is off and ties all the flavours together. Nobody could tell that it was carrot-based, my family thought it was squash. Definitely will make it again!

Not a review, a question: how many servings does this make?

Rating: 4
This soup came out really good. I took the advice of others and increased the spices (to at least 2x the recipe), and the ginger (to about 1.5x the recipe). I also toasted the spices first in a dry pan to enhance the flavors. I didn't have mustard seeds, but it was an ingredient in the curry powder (which I'd increased), so I figured it was ok. Otherwise i followed the recipe pretty precisely. In the end the soup is a bit thick, but i loved the flavor, so i didn't want to dilute it with more water. The flavors go really well together. And it was fairly easy/quick to make.

Rating: 3
Great, surprisingly hearty, soup. The flavors aren't ones you'd come across often and I did up the spices a bit - for a wonderful result. Paired with an easy chicken curry and brown rice for a nice weekday meal. Only substitute was that I didn't have peanut oil, so used toasted sesame oil instead - tasted great. Really easy to make, only time-consuming part is chopping up all of the ingredients.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spice and ginger. I didn't have coriander seeds so used the powder. To enhance the flavor of the spices I cooked them in a dry pan before starting with the recipe. Used an immersion blender which worked fine although there were a few small chunks of carrot (not a problem). Made a great vegetarian winter dinner along with a spinach/brie/pear/toasted hazelnut salad with blackberry vinaigrette (from one of my cookbooks). For some reason this soup took quite a while for me to make but it the results were worth it.

Made it as was and was not impressed. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had used more spices, espeically ginger. Despite me not really enjoying the dish, my guests loved it and ate it up entirely. The yogurt does give it a depth that is missing with the soup alone.

Rating: 4
This soup...is SOOOO good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with only these variations: -used already ground coriander and mustard -added about 25-50% more than written of each of the spices, including a bit more ginger. Very easy, fairly quick. Totally delicious! The flavor is unique and just a bit spicy (with the add'l spices). You can taste the lime zest and juice. I agree with the other reviewer who said that serving with the yogurt is key. Nice contrast. Will most definitely make this again. Yum!

I would give this recipe 4+ if I could. It was so delicious. The blend of flavours with the ginger, spices and carrot made it so special.

Thanks to all those who recommended adding extra spices and doubling the amount (as well as adding more ginger)! I used garam masala, chili powder, and some Chinese mustard powder. But another step I took was to first roast the carrots with some parsnips and yellow onion in a little olive oil, then add it where you'd normally add the carrot -- but just let the whole thing boil and simmer a few minutes, not 30. It really adds a rich dimension to the soup! SO good. We are getting 3 meals from this recipe, and it's so healthy!

This was terrific! Carrots are one of few foods that I really don't like to eat, so I've been trying to find a way to eat them that doesn't taste too carroty, and this was perfect! I did have to make a few changes, but I think I kept the overall integrity of the recipe pretty well. I doubled all the spices to start. I did not have curry powder, so I used 2 tsp dried fenugreek seed + 1/2 tsp garam masala instead. I also added a hearty shake of cayanne pepper. I did not have a great way to finely grind the seeds, so my soup has a bit of seed/shell debris in it, but it doesn't affect the taste. Next time, I will just use ground coriander and mustard seed. Also, I think I added too much lime juice (did not measure) so next time I will be sure to add recommended amount. Can't wait to eat the rest for lunch!!

This soup is outstanding. I used some cumin seeds and a touch of chili powder as well for a kick. The lime is key and gives it a unique touch. Cilantro is a perfect garnish, and the soup is wonderful hot or cold. Try keeping it thick and using it as a dip for naan bread. yum!

Thanks to other reviewers, I made some modifications as well. I also didn't have the spice seeds so I used ground mustard seed and ground coriander. I also added a heaping tsp of ground cumin. I substituted canola oil for peanut oil because that's what I had on hand. I also added one small jalepeno pepper from my garden with the seeds and ribs removed, diced small. The pepper went in with the onions. Make sure your oil is hot enough so the spices are toasted. I served it with chopped fresh cilantro and sour cream for extra decadence. It tastes so good after it was chilled that I suspect it would be great after being frozen. Yum!

So easy and delicious! I substituted a curry dry rub that I'd make a while ago for the spices (it's the one from the Joy of Cooking), and it was fabulous. The lime juice really adds some zing. A tip re: the ginger. It grates more easily if it's frozen, and you don't have to peel it first; the peel is edible, and makes no difference to the flavour.

This soup was wonderful - easy peasy, yet has rich and complex flavours. I would be thrilled to have this at a restaurant. I was short on time and used already-ground coriander and mustard powder, as well as bottled fresh ginger. I didn't have limes on hand but I did have some Kaffir lime leaves in the freezer (buy them fresh at your local Asian Market and you can keep them in the freezer for months!)and I tossed in three of these to simmer. The gentle flavour they gave was wonderful. With that one ingredient substitution, this recipe will be on my "make-often" list.

I'm rating this 4 forks to counter those people that rated it 2 forks (sorry, a cheap ploy). I do agree that the spices need to be upped 50%. Hey add more lime juice if you like, less curry, etc. As written with the upped spices this soup is delicious. I served it cold with the fresh lime juice, cold yogurt and some fresh cilantro and this was fantasstic. A yummy summer starter not to be missed. Bland? No way.

This soup is exceptional. I love Indian food but really dislike carrots, so I was very skeptical. But the flavor was so delicate and layered. The soup was yellow, not orange like I expected, and I didn't taste a "carrot" soup. The carrots turned into a great smooth creamy texture. I am making the soup again a few days after finishing the first batch, and this time I'm making a double batch. The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I substituted olive oil for the peanut oil due to severe peanut allergies in my home. I added a little Indian red chili powder (like cayenne) to make it a little spicier, but it really is delicious.

This soup was absolutely delicious! I know there are a lot of folks out there who really want to "taste the (insert specific ingredient)" and won't like the recipe if they don't, but I feel that one of the most wonderful elements of this soup is that no one ingredient overpowers any other. In fact, in every bite I found that I could really distinguish the various flavours playing off eachother. Which is a very enjoyable (and tasty) experience. My "coup de coeur" of this recipe is definitely the lime, though I must admit, the yogurt is a close second. This soup is inexpensive and simple to make, and a pleasure to eat. What more can you ask for in a dish?
