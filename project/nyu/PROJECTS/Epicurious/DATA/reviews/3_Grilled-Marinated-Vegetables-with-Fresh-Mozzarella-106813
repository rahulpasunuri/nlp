This is a FABULOUS DISH and should be made as-is. I've been making it exactly as directed since it first appeared in bon appetit and quite honestly the marinade recipes are always requested. I assemble a platter every year for the company pool party along with specialty olives, roasted tomatoes stuffed with feta and blanched asparagus wrapped in prosciutto. It starts as an app and is gone by dinner! Another bonus - take your leftover veggies (if you have any) - throw them in a processer with some roasted onion and additional olive oil - you have a fabulous dip; great on pita!) LOVE IT!!!!

Easy and delicious. The mint marinade with zucchini was particularly special but the entire combination with the mozarella balls was a winner both for taste and visual appeal. I too added a red onion to the red pepper batch and a tablespoon of balsamic to each marinade.

The marinades were aromatic and were very subtle additions to the vegetables. However, I found the process extremely messy and had no marinade left over to serve as dressing as suggested. Good but not great.

hi... 16 tablespoons is a cup. okay? add two and you're not measuring 18 tablespoons. unless you want to.

Fantastic. I added a red onion, 2 large sliced portabello mushrooms and quartered plum tomatoes to the selection. Used half olive oil and balsamic vinegar (thank you for the suggestion) instead of straight olive oil. Perfect with steak or a grilled chicken.

This was very good and a great "make ahead" recipe for company. I also used balsamic vinegar and added the red onion- both good suggestions. Perfect at room temperature.

Delicious. This was presented as a starter and then the platter hung around for the rest of the meal being used then as a condiment or accessory for the main course (steak). I did not read the reviews ahead of time but think the balsamic vinegar idea is a good one and would try it next time. Need someting to cut the oil a bit. That would do it. For the peppers I used the "stoplight" selection you can buy these days in the markets - red, yellow, orange. Also used regular eggplant which was fine. For the marinades I used 3T in each marinade and used the remaining 3T for the drizzle instead of the 2:4 formula prescribed by the recipe. Seemed fine. Also I marinated the vegetables in plastic freezer bags. Seemed an easier way to distribute the flavors to the vegetables.

We really enjoyed the vegetables; the balsamic vinegar was a great suggestion!

One should not have to measure 18 time for the olive oil.

I used red pepper, zuchinni and red onion. The secret is the fresh mozzarella and basil with the olive oil drizzle. Great with a steak, will definetly make again.

I made this at the last minute and did both zuchinni and eggplant in the basil garlic marinade. I did add a bit of balsamic vinager as suggested. Then I forgot to buy fresh mozorella and even to put the regular that I had in the fridge. It was very tasty fresh and as leftovers - even without the cheese.

Very very tasty. Light and perfect. But try adding slices of red onion and/or yellow squash too. Loved the balsamico tip too.
