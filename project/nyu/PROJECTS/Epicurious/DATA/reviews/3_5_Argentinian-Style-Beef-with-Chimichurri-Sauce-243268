Four forks for the marinade; Two forks for the Chimichurri sauce. I used much less vinegar in both as suggested - the tenderloin was extremely tasty. The Chimichurri requires quite a bit more fresh parsley and/or cilantro - I would suggest something along the lines of two cups. I will definitely use the marinade again, however, I will find a better recipe for Chimichurri.

Very tasty but I will leave out the red wine vinegar next time. It over powered the other flavors.

i made the chimichurri for a dinner party and served it with grilled chicken.i used red onion instead to make it milder, and more of it, along with a quarter cup of fresh cilantro, as i didn't have any parsley. it was delicious - our guests liked it so much we barely got any, so i will have to make this again!

This looks good - only thing I'd add: the fire-roasted jalapeno that Judy Rodgers suggests in the Zuni Cafe cookbook. +, why not some rosemary? I used that chimichurri as a marinade for a hanger steak over roasted potatoes with a red pepper coulis and arugula coulis.

I marinated three 1-1/2" thick ribeye steaks in the beef marinate for 5 hours turning every hour. It was a big hit, everyone loved it. Next time I will cut down on the amount of onions. The chimichurri sauce was good but again, too much onions in my opinion. I also made up a second batch of this chimichurri sauce which I liked better: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chimichurri-Sauce-107159 People seemed to like both depending on their taste preference.

Pretty darned good. I wasn't instantly transported to the street side sand which stalls on the streets of Bariloche, AR, but I'll make it again for sure.

Used a little less vinegar in the chimichurri and added some fresh lime juice. Also added a little more parsley. Yum!

The Chimichurri sauce is pretty good, but I dressed it up with chopped green onions and 1/2 the amount of regular onion. Also, DO NOT use the vinegar in the marinade - I was suspicious, but tried it anyway. Unfortunately, acids (like vinegar) will toughen beef and make it mealy and chewy - which of course it did in this case. I would drop the vinegar from the marinade and substitute with more oil (I used olive oil)

I really liked the flavor that the marinade imparted to the beef. The chimichurri had a little too much red-wine vinegar for my taste so next time I will but it back. This is slightly different than other recipes I have seen for chimichurri. Most of them don't have the vinegar.

It needs a LOT more parsley to balance the vinegar. I also ended up adding more oil.

Great marinade and excellent chimichurri sauce. I've used this on sirloin and london broil and both came out very well. The chimichurri was terrific and I made enough to store and use on chicken later in the week. Recommendation: run the chimichurri ingredients through a few pulses in the food processor to make it a little less chunky. Delicious and have placed this in my regular meal rotation!

This dish is most excellent. I substituted bison rib eyes and they were so good. This was the first time I had attempted Chimichurri sauce and the result was delish. I recommend making this the previous night and letting the ingredients merry over night for the best result. The vinegar really permeates the other ingredients and breaks them down mellowing the entire concoction out.

Delicious and a big hit at an "end of summer" dinner party this weekend. I made it with the tenderloin and pretty much stuck to the recipe. I did add a smallish amount of Spanish paprika to the chimichurri which gave it a little depth while keeping the flavors bright.

Fantastic! We used sirloin instead of tenderloin and it was great! My husband was more patient than I would have been and very finely minced the ingredients for the chimichurri sauce - which made it drizzle beautifully over the meat.

Made this last night and it was awesome! I really liked the marinade for the beef, and my husband raved about the chimichurri sauce. The only thing I thought could be improved was that the I thought the chimichurri sauce was too chunky - I think that the chopped and minced ingredients could improve with a whirl in the food processor or the blender so they were finer and more like a sauce and less like a chunky salsa.

THis was great. I used flank steak cut into strips that were grilled on kabab sticks. It was a bit garlicky for me, so next time less garlic. I served it with tomatoes and feta on the side, tsatsiki and pitas... mmm mmmmm

This was a great marinade and the fresh herb sauce on the side was great. got lots of compliments - I used flank steak, no skewers, then sliced the meat on an angle put on a platter with the suce on the side. even 3 days later it tased great! One

This was delicious. Not a morsel was left over. Great with fresh herbs right out of the garden and peppers right off the vine.

Very good...as long as you're planning ahead and can marinate and make the sauce early. I didn't bbq it - I did the cubes in a ridged pan...just as good even without the skewers.

AWESOME!

Mmmm. My family (fussy teens) loved this! I served it make-your- own-sandwich style with grilled pita, cut-up tomatoes, Greek yoghurt and the chimichurri on the side. Very simple- I marinated it only 2 hours instead of 4 and it was still v. tasty. Also doubled the sauce recipe and it's gone.

Loved this!!! I marinated a flank steak and grilled it to medium rare, and it was tasty on it's own. Adding a drizzle of the chimichurri sent my taste buds over the moon. I've finally found a chimichurri that I will make again and again!

Made this recipe today, July 26th and it was delicious. The sauce is absolutely amazing, so much so that I just used the leftover to season a whole chicken I am roasting tomorrow.. Simply Spectacular, I totally recommend it.

Great recipe. I used tenderloin steaks, instead of cubes. I'll make it again, the same way and will also try it with chicken.

Had this for dinner and it was really good--nice seasonings and flavor. Used flat- iron steak, and altho a bit chewy, had great flavor. Hubby loved it. A keeper! Served it with grilled peppers and onions.
