after reading regarding the cornmeal, here are my substitutions. ALL RAVED ABOUT THIS CAKE!!!! 3&1/4 cups flour no cornmeal 2&3/4 cups sugar 1& 1/4 cup mashed avocado 1 cup buttermilk go with the rest of the ingredients. Bake in a 9X14 greased & floured pan for same amount of time. Tried it with sliced strawberries& whipped cream. another time with vanilla bean ice cream. YOU NEED TO TRY THIS !!!!!! My next project is to substitute with mashed mango!

Love the cake. Could not taste the avocado. I used medium ground corn meal. The cake came out really moist. I iced the cake with Avocado icing, that is 2 avocados, juice of one lemon, pince of salt and powder sugar. The icing brang out the avocado flavor. Rate this a 4 fork.

When this recipe was featured in an email, I was intrigued. It was a bit scary that the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, although for 2 cakes. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups... that's 1 cup per cake. It was just enough sugar to not overpower the yummy avocado flavor, less guilty, and delicious! Great with tea and coffee.

Thought it was very good. Added walnuts and toasted it for breakfast. Pretty much like banana nut bread without bananas. Spread with butter or cream cheese,very good. Thanks for another use for avocados.

I was intrigued by this recipe and decided to give it a try despite the mixed reviews. I found the taste and texture of the cornmeal overpowering and unpleasant in a cake. There was no discernible avocado flavor. I really wanted to like this cake but unfortunately threw it all out.

With very ripe avocados, their flavor came through fairly strong. It is a hybrid between cornbread and pound cake. A bit strange, but everyone that tasted it (at a party and at work) said they liked it without obligation. Overall, a unique flavor combination, good texture and balanced flavors.

Holy cow was this delicious! I had a piece for dessert, and then had another, and now I'm going to pop!

I was raised in California and grew up loving avocados. The recipe sounded interesting so I made it this weekend for friends. It's an acceptable pound cake, but I wish it had been better. There is zero avocado taste and way too much sugar. The cornmeal doesn't add anything to the finished product. The fussy switching the positions of the pans mid-bake is unnecessary; simply bake both pans on the center rack. It's good, but not great. I would choose a classic pound cake over this version anytime.

Our guests did enjoy this, but we ended up serving it with dinner instead of as dessert because it was more corn bread like than expected. It was really good, but did not taste like avocado at all, and I would never call it pound cake.

This was a good pound cake but the avocado flavor doesn't come through. I guess if you had an avocado tree in your back yard and needed to use up a bunch...... I found the texture to be perfect.

No forks! This was awful. The cornmeal overwhelmed everything else. The texture was nasty. The flavor of the avocado was bland but enough to destroy the taste of the vanilla that usually delights in pound cake. I threw it away.

I put this together this morning - and trust me - it won't be the last time either! This is so easy and delicious! As Rach would say: "YUMMO"
