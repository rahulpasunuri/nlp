They are Quesadillas, they are easy, they are delicious. Nice combination. Very simple. I use a wider variety of cheeses.

I altered the recipe a bit, using basil instead of cilantro and unsing only cheddar cheese (it was what I had in the fridge). I added some red pepper flakes for heat and used jarred roasted red peppers since this was a last minute meal. My significant other raved about it and wants it again!! very easy

I recently made the lamb and red pepper kabob recipe from epicurious. Loved it! Thought that the flavors stood up to each other. I thought the red pepper was overpowering the tomatillos in this recipe. And to me they're the star ingredient. I think I'd substitute red onion or corn next time in place of peppers. Otherwise a wonderful quesadilla. Reviewers complained of them falling apart too easily. Tortillas come in packages of 8. Make 4 quesadillas instead of the 3 the recipe requires. There's a lot of filling here! Plenty for 4, and then they don't fall apart from being over-stuffed.

Delicious quesadillas. I am always on the lookout for a new idea for quesadillas to serve as an appetizer, so I only wish these were easier to eat. I definitely think that these are better as an entree with a fork and knife--on my first attempt to pick up one of the wedges a shrimp and tomatillo slice fell out! I forgot to buy cilantro at the store, but I added some finely chopped scallions and they were still delicious. I almost did not go to the bother for the roasted red peppers, but I am so glad I did!! I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.

Have made other recipes using similar ingredients, so I knew this would taste good. I used canned tomatillos and they were fine, but would use fresh if they were available if only for the firmer texture. No flavor is lost with the canned, though. Will make again.

Impressive just as described! A fantastic mid-week entree.

Very tasty! Roasted the tomatillos as well as the red bell peppers. Used regular monteray jack instead of the pepper jack.

This was very good. We will defintely make this again. It was so easy and good. I didn't have pepper jack so I sliced some jalapenos. It was great. I think better than the pepper jack would have been. I think the only thing I might add in the future is some roasted corn.

Using shrimp and tomatillos makes these quesadillas far more delicious than most. I found that the roasted red peppers were worth the extra effort.

We love this simple, yet fantastic dish!

Very good recipe and quite easy. Next time I'll make it in a large pan on the stove top like other reviewers suggested - and perhaps add a little minced red onion.

This was excellent. Like some other reviewers, I took this to a party and everyone loved it. The tomatillo slices are great. I used a fresh jalapeno and regular Monterey Jack (which also allowed us to make one without the chiles for those who wanted it). I didn't bother roasting the red peppers.

This was a great appetizer for a New Years Eve party at Queenie Martini's home. I would certainly make it again. Next time I would simplify it and cut down on prep time by using precooked shrimp and roasted red peppers from a jar. I garnished with more cilantro, lime wedges and avacado.

Great Recipe! I did make a few changes and have some suggestions. I thought the shrimp needed to be salted before cooking so I lightly kosher salted them. As I am from Texas, I thought a strip or two of roasted poblano or just a few extra jalapenos would be perfect as this was just a bit mild for our tastes. When I make these again for a party I will leave some as the recipe calls for and spike some of them up. Over all a wonderful balance of twange from the tomatillos, richness from the cheese, and of course the delicate shrimp. Also, at my local rural east Texas Wal-Mart they now carry 'ready to cook' flour tortilla. These are fabulous! They are made by a company called La Abuela. The dough is paper thin and and ready to cook on a hot griddle or pan. Far superior to bagged grocery tortillas. In our store they are in the refrigerated section with the Mexican cheese products.

Because I don't like cilantro and can't tolerate spicy food, I substituted with 3 Tbsp. dried basil and regular Monterey jack cheese. Made it for a potluck and everyone enjoyed!

The cilantro made this taste really fresh. Both my husband and I were impressed.

It's been quite a while since I tried these, but as I remember they were quite good. I loved the tangy taste of the tomatillos in a warm, gooey, cheese-filled quesadilla. Mmmmm!

I reduced the cheese in half and topped it with guacomole and plain yogurt mixed with sour cream, and topped it with more cilantro. I made it another time by placing the filling inside a burrito warmed in a hot pan on the stove (no oil) and folded it in half after filling it. Less fat, and still quite delicious.

I have made these several times and they are always well received. I also serve with sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo.

I substituted Maine shredded crabmeat for the shrimp, because I already had shrimp on the menu, and the dish worked well. Assembled quesadillas in the afternoon, placed them on waxed paper, topped with more waxed paper, then plastic wrap, and cooked them just before serving.

I have already made this a couple of times. Yum, yum......Such an interesting combination of flavors. A bit of fresh pico de gallo and guacomole and you have a meal to savor.

Instead of shrimp, I poached some chicken breasts, let them cool, and shredded them. Delicious. I served with canned jalapenos (my husband's request), sour cream, and homemade guacamole. My oven was broken, so I cooked them on the stovetop in a large skillet, covered to melt the cheese. Reviewers said they didn't work as leftovers. I made some extras but did not cook them, wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator. They heated up easily the next day and tasted great.

Truly delicious. This can be made quickly by putting cooked shrimp, tomatillos, red pepper and cilantro in the food processor to make a coarse mixture. Use the processor to shred the cheese while you're at it, and you've got a weeknight dinner dish.

These are perfect. No need to add or change anything, but I always serve with sour cream and guacamole and a fresh salsa. Very good indeed.

I concur. This is a winner. Our jack was a hotter variant with habaneros which gave a little extra kick . Only reservation was that the finished product did not reheat well (soggy), so I reccommend only making as many as you plan to eat.

This was one of several appetizer recipes that I used for a party, and these were the biggest hit. Delicious!

I really loved this dish! Everything about it. I served it with guacamole and sour cream and a side order of black beans (also an epicurious recipe). Since there are only two of us, we had leftovers, so I had it again the next day for lunch. WARNING: I also found my weight had reached unprecedented heights that second day. This is not a dish for the dieting!

Terrific! I made it with fresh tomatillos from my garden. It's great with the addition of a tomatillo salsa.

Wonderful recipe. It's great to have a different mexican recipe. The tomatillos and shrimp (I was surprised that the shrimp worked so well) give the quesadillas a diffent twist. A must try. A meal in itself.
