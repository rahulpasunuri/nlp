I made this cake for my birthday and was slightly disappointed. Each element on its own is delicious, but when everything is put together the chocolate filling is really overwhelming. I'm a chocolate lover, and I especially love dark chocolate, so for me to say that is really something. Unlike some other users, I was able to use all the filling that the recipe made, but I do agree that for the sake of having a more balanced flavor the amount could have easily been cut by 2/3, and perhaps should've been made with milk chocolate. Based on flavor alone I would give this recipe 3 stars, but I have to take away another for what I consider to be a major problem with the instructions that could and probably has caused serious issues for someone with less experience making layer cakes than I have. There is absolutely no reason to chill the filling overnight. To do that and then try to apply it to the very soft cake layers would absolutely tear the cake to shreds. I chilled my filling for about 2 hours and even then I had to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes until I felt I could spread it on the cake without doing any damage. I'd also suggest that after stacking the cake you might want to chill the cake for a bit before applying the frosting. If the filling is soft your layers might want to slide around unless you let it firm up.

This cake turned out great and was a crowd pleaser. Other reviewers are right. don't chill the filling overnight. 4 hours worked well for me. You also don't need to chill the frosting for an hour. I put a crumb coat on as soon as I mixed the frosting, chilled the cake for 15 minutes, then completed frosting. I used Reese's peanut butter cups & roasted peanuts instead of Butterfingers. It was great!

This cake was fantastic all the way around. And to change it up, It would also be just as fantastic with using only the chocolate peanut butter filling as the "frosting/icing" for the whole cake or using only the cream cheese and butterfinger frosting for the whole cake without using the filling because each are excellent on their own. Each pair well with the cake in their own right. I will make this cake again and again all three ways.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday. Though I would cut baking time to 20 minutes and reduce filling by half per others' reviews, we thought this cake was fantastic and I will definitely make again with those changes.

Rating: 2
I made the cake only (no frosting nor filling). It seemed to much sugar for the amount of flour, however I added it as indicated. I added about 2/3 cups buttermilk since it was already soft enough for me to bake. When baking it rose OK but at the end it sank completely. The flavour is too sweet for me. I am not sure I will make it again. If I do, I will add about half of the indicated sugar (or less) and 2/3 the buttermilk.

I made this cake for a party and was not happy with three things: the cake was very fragile, the filling became too hard in the refrigerator (had to microwave it for few seconds)and was twice as much as needed and the butterfingers shredded when cut with a sharp knife. I tried putting them in the freezer first but they were still a mess. I will eliminate them next time and serve them on the individual slices if in fact I ever make this again. Lot of trouble for the resulting product.

Rating: 4
This was a stunning and delicious cake - and really quite easy. Agree that the filling makes almost twice as much as needed. Used some of the extra to drizzle across the top and down the sides - made for a more "gourmet" appearance. Chilling the filling overnight is not really necessary but a couple of hours is plenty. Because the cake is a little crumbly, the filling needs to be soft enough to spread easily. The cream cheese/whipped cream frosting is a great combination. A good crumb coat is necessary before fully frosting the cake.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday party and everyone loved it! I had many requests for the recipe. She is a big peanut butter fan, but this cake is the perfect amount of peanut butter. It was my very first from-scratch and layer cake! However I did a few things different, first I subbed sour cream for the buttermilk kept it nice and moist! I also did a four layer (cut 2 cakes in half) but this does require a longer bake time and some skill for cutting the layers! I kept the chocolate filling layers light and it helped keep the cake less super-sweet. You could definitely make less filling so you dont have a lot left over. I also decorated with the new mini reese cups and did a drizzle design with the peanut butter.If your thinking about it, go for it!

Rating: 4
Truly a four-fork cake! I didn't change a thing except for the topping: Since I was writing a happy birthday message on top, I nixed the Butterfinger and nuts for Reese's halves lining the perimeter. This is definitely one of those cakes that is easy but time consuming. I made the ganache and cake layers on day one, then made the icing and assembled everything on day two. It tastes and looks fancier than it is and is just sinfully good. Make it!

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS. Fantastic flavor blend and also great presentation- great for birthdays!! This is my favorite cream cheese frosting- lighter than most and so good. Careful cooking the cake though; I'd check it at 15 and 20 minutes because it dries out quickly. The only thing I fiddle with are the nuts; I use creamy peanut butter in the cake, add extra crushed walnuts between each layer, and I substitute the candy bars with crushed nuts (walnuts and hazelnuts are both good). I think the candy is just over the top, while nuts are a delicious and attractive garnish.

Rating: 3
This cake is very good but few things you need to know. First the chocolate filling is way to much for this cake, you can easily cut the recipe in half and you'll have more than enough filling. Also, the icing is very good but not with this cake! A chocolate one would be way more appropriate with the taste of the peanut butter cake and chocolate/peanut butter filling. It has a lot of flavor and doesn't need an extra flavor with the icing. It is worth trying this cake for the peanut butter lovers.

Rating: 4
This cake was fantastic! It was a great presentation for the party and provided enough for 12 adults and 5 kids. This is now my go to cream cheese frosting - it is the best I have ever made. After reading the reviews I did add a dollop of sour cream to cake batter and it was perfect consistency. There was more than enough chocolate filling so I made truffles out of the left overs. Will definitely make this again.

This cake is so good it should be illegal! Best tasting cake I've ever had especially considering I'm not a big peanut butter fan. I made this cake on Sunday and it was gone by Wednesday. I didn't have any butter milk so I made my own by mixing 1tsp of white vinegar, 1tsp of lemon juice into 1 cup on milk, let it stand for 5 minutes and you have buttermilk. I skipped glazed peanuts and only used Butterfinger candy as decoration, cake looked and tasted great.

I actually found this recipe in a book somewhere not on Epicurious. I made it for my daughters 21st bday last year. The cake was spectacular. Check out my photo which is much different than the one shown here and my blog post comments. http://in-homeculinaryclasses.blogspot.com/2010/08/happy-21st-birthday-cake.html

I'm only giving this three forks, but due to my own error. I used 8 oz of sour cream instead of buttermilk, instead of in addition to the buttermilk. It was just a tiny bit dry but again, that I believe was my fault. The cream cheese frosting and the chocolate peanut butter filling was fantastic though. The chocolate wasn't too sweet with was a really great compliment to the sweet peanut butter cake and cream cheese frosting. It did leave me with a lot of leftover chocolate filling but it goes great with fresh strawberries so no complaints there. This did make a HUGE cake though. I had 8 guests that all had some, got a lot of compliments, but it's so rich that we couldn't even finish half of it.

I had saved this recipe for quite some time because it looked so great. I am a die hard peanut butter fan so I wanted to try it. The PB cake was easy to make, was moist and had nice PB flavor. The frosting was light and great flavor as well. Now, the filling was another story. There were 9 of us eating this cake and none cared for the filling. I tasted it when making it and found it a bit over powering but went ahead and made as directed. I did not put as much filling as it said too but I feel that the flavor was too much for the soft PB and cream cheese flavor. I will make the cake again but will more than likely use the frosting as a filling next time.

This cake was a huge hit! Especially for the birthday girl who is a huge fan of Reese's peanut butter cups. I followed suggestions from previous raters to use sour cream instead of buttermilk, and only use 2 c. of flour in the cake. The cake turned out wonderfully? I did not cut the ganache recipe in half despite comments that it produced too much, and I ended up with some extra (but not a ridiculous amount). I ended up making truffles out of the leftovers, and they turned out very tastily as well. Rave reviews all around, and several requests for the recipe. Definitely worth making again (just don't count the calories).

I saved this recipe years ago and finally got around to making it for Christmas Eve. My guests absolutely loved it, but I am not a fan of the cream cheese frosting combination with this cake and filling. I loved the filling and the cake, and I will make this again with some type of chocolate frosting.

Rating: 4
great recipe. won the office bake of with it... make a whole bunch of frosting and chocolate filling, but hopefully i can use it for other baked goodies. the only thing i changed was adding additional buttermilk like other reviewers and used mini peanutbutter cups from trader joes to decorate the top. yum yum yum and worth the work!

I have made this recipe twice now and it is loved by everyone who has tasted it. It will be my husband's birthday cake this week as per his request. Only change I have made is to bake the batter in two 9 inch pans and then cutting each layer into two slices making an impressive 4 layer cake. I have found the cake to be very moist and the chocolate-peanut butter ganache addictive. Enjoy with loved ones!

I made this for an office party and everyone went crazy for it (my boss said it should be illegal). I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the cake (at the same time I added the vanilla). I watched the cake very carefully while it was baking, because I was afraid it would become dry, but it actually needed the full amount of time listed in the recipe and was very moist. I used most of the filling, but next time I would use only 2/3 of it.

I made this cake for my 11 year old daughter's birthday with mixed results. I followed other reviewers' recommendations and reduced the flour to 2 cups, the sugar to 2/3 lb and used sour cream instead of buttermilk. Cake was very moist, if a bit dense, and family loved it. I made the frosting exactly as per recipe with cream cheese, butter and vanilla but stopped there as the texture and taste were perfect and the whipped cream seemed an unnecessary addition. Family adored it and said it was there favourite frosting. The only thing I would change would be the chocolate ganache filling; the whole family found it too heavy and strong for the cake. Next time I would replace this with a lighter filling, eg.cream cheese flavoured with peanut butter.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was phenomenal. I made the filling on a Friday, baked the cakes on Saturday and wrapped them in plastic wrap and left them at room temperature overnight, and made the frosting and assembled the cake on Sunday. I did need to chill the cake after each step of assembly (after the first layer of filling, second layer, and the crumb layer of the frosting). The cake was moist, although it only needed about 20 minutes to bake. I used all the filling and it was the perfect amount to bring the chocolate flavor out. The frosting is amazing! It's the lightest, most airy cream cheese frosting I've ever had! The cake was a huge hit with the whole party. There were 12 of us, and we only ate half the cake!

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time!! The blend of flavors and textures is complicated and absolutely perfect. It's not a quick recipe, but the time is worth it. My 12 year old brother and my parents both could not get enough! Also, wonderful presentation. Love the candy on top!

This took me a while, but the result was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! I made the chocolate filling the first day; the cake the next; then finished up with the frosting and assembly on the day of my party. Every one loved it!!!

I tried this recipe about four times in the course of one evening. Thank goodness I had so many supplies, time and patience. I thought I would make cupcakes with the recipe. The batter definitely made lot. My first batch ended up with major overflow that left cripsy cookies of sorts on the top of the pan and sinkholes for cupcakes. Tasted amazing, looked terrible. For my second batch, I completely under filled them and got sink holes still. I threw out the batter and tried again, this time testing my baking powder and soda, which were fine and being very meticulous with measurements. I tried making a cake to start, never opening the oven and making sure I followed all directions. I still ended up with another sinkhole. I tried amending the recipe again and never came up with a solution. Love the taste but the look is absolutely appalling. *Sinkholes-high crispy sides, bottoms densely packed, soft and chewy.

Just a great cake! It's easy to make and very forgiving. For those who thought the layers were dry: Did you measure out the flour correctly? You don't scoop with the measuring cup, you lightly spoon the flour into the cup and level with a knife. Done that way (and I did add another two tablespoons of buttermilk, just in case) the layers were dense and moist. Definitely a peanut butter lover's cake. The ganache was delicious and made a substantial amount of filling-but why would you want less than lots? I've always done chocolate frosting on similar cakes but I found I really liked this cream cheese frosting, a bit lighter than chocolate, and I'll use it again, here and elsewhere. And yes, I did use peanut butter cups instead of Butterfingers, I think their consistency is more appropriate.

Rating: 3
I substituted peanut butter cups for Butterfinger. Yum! If you have a scale, the cake layers can be measured out to roughly 1 lb 3-4 oz. each. The layers bake nice and firm (i.e. dense) and were easy to build with. I was too eager and didn't have the patience to let the peanut butter ganache chill overnight, so I chilled it for 2 hours before building the cake, after which I put the crumb-coated cake in the freezer for another hour before completely frosting cake. No problems there. This is quite a sweet cake, and you MUST love your peanut butter to make this, cause with a whole jar of PB required, there's really no backing down. I gave most of it away because it was huge! Can probably feed 12-15, possibly more b/c of it's richness.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. Wow, was it delicious. I did you Reeses Peanut Butter Cups instead of Butterfingers. The cake tastes best when served cold and must be refrigerated. The icing never solidified but that didn't affect the taste. I'm going to use my old stand-by cream cheese frosting recipe.

I made this cake for my husband's office. He took it in at 9 and by 9:21 is was completely gone! The favorite parts were the frosting and the filing. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a little more buttermilk to the cake batter, however the cake was a still a little dry and crumbly. The flavor was very good though. I think I will play with the cake batter a bit for the next time.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday since he enjoys peanut butter and chocolate together. It turned out great and was a big hit with our guests, who were mostly men. I followed the suggestions of some of the reviewers and only made half the filling, and like others said, I still had some leftover. I also kept the flour the same but added about 2tbsp extra of buttermilk to the cake batter and it turned out perfectly. I did not find the cake dry at all, although I made everything ahead and froze the cake layers to assemble the next day. My filling did set into a solid mass after being in the fridge overnight, so I just took it out in the morning and left it on the counter until the afternoon, and it was the perfect consistency for spreading. I didn't have ANY problems with oozing at all, even considering I made it on a +27C degree day and my kitchen was warm. Freezing the cake layers really helped with everything. As other reviewers did, I topped it with 6 Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, and that seemed to be the perfect amount. A great cake, and I will make it again, even though I'm not a personal fan of peanut butter!

Rating: 4
This cake was wonderful! I baked it in the recommended 3 layers, and it only took 18 minutes in my oven. I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't chill the ganache overnight- 2 hours and it was the perfect consistency. I layered it thickly between the 3 cakes, and had none left over. I'm not big on cream cheese frosting, but everyone who tasted it thought it was amazing. The cake made a very impressive presentation, I will definitely save this recipe for the next holiday.

I used the above reviewers suggestions and substituted sour cream for the buttermilk and reduced the flour. We also switched reeses cups for the butterfingers (seriously, who likes butter fingers anyways?) In our oven the coking time was ~15 minutes The cake benefited from cooling at each step of assembly. The filling had to be warmed to spread, then once the cake was assembled, it was chilled again to get it to harden. Chilling the cake after frosting the crumb coat also helped. Everyone who ate this cake enjoyed it. The cake was moist, and the peanut butter flavor was subtle. The frosting blew people's minds, and induced declarations of love,proposals of marriage,etc. Both the filling and frosting recipes make a lot. You could probably use it all if you really, really like frosting, but if you make a full recipe you're likely to have extra.

Followed advice from others: half the filling, reduce flour to 2 cups, only used 1/2-2/3 pounds of brown sugar for cake, substituted sour cream for buttermilk, baked cake layers for 17 minutes. Cake is very tender and moist. Fantanstic.

This cake is delicious! I was short on time and had a lot of dishes to make for a party, so i modified it a little to save time. I used a yellow cake mix and put the peanut butter in that. I also did not whip the cream separately from the frosting, but just added it about half to the frosting. I did not have glazed peanuts, so i used roasted salted peanuts instead and it was fantastic- good salty sweet. The cake was delicious and a big hit!

My husband loved this cake for his birthday! It is super rich so cut small slices. I did modify the recipe slightly, based on previous reviews that the cake was dry. I used just 2 cups of flour for the cake batter and baked the cake for slightly less time, about 22 minutes. It came out with a delicious moist dense crumb...perfect!

Rating: 2
This cake was okay but not worth all of the work! The cake was dry and you could barely taste the peanut butter flavor. The chocolate filling was good but that was all that you could taste. The chopped butterfinger pieces on top of the cake ruin the appearance of the cake by "bleeding" into the cream cheese frosting. There are so many other delicious cakes on this site that you don't need to waste your time with this one!

This cake was a hit! It yields at least 16 wonderful servings. Although slightly time consuming, it's rich and indulgent. I made two differnt cakes the night I made this one, and this one was gone much before the other! I opted for fresh berries over the butterfinger bar - I didn't think the candy bar was necessar - sweet enough.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday, and shared it with a bunch of friends. It was super rich and every part of it was delicious! I could have taken a little more time to make the layers more perfect. The frosting and filling are both incredible, and I think the slightly dry character of the peanut butter cake it a good compliment.

Made with French vanilla frosting, 10" pans and otherwise followed recipe to a T. The filling is great and would be delicious in crepes or on bread. But it makes too much...so you can use the leftovers that way. Cake itself is VERY peanut-buttery but a little dry. Definitely makes a large, presentation-style cake so make for plenty of company!

This was a very good cake. I made it as a Thanksgiving dessert. It is very rich, so it may not have been the best choice after a big meal. Unlike most of the reviewers here, my filling needed an overnight chill to set. Even then I was a little worried about it, so I whipped it a little. The texture was similar to soft peanut butter fudge. You can bake the cake in two 9"x 2" pans, but don't try it with 9" x 1.5" pans. The cake rose to the very top of my 2-inch pans.

Rating: 4
I thought this was a pretty darn good cake. I would rate it 3.5 stars. As others have suggested, don't let the filling sit overnight - 1-2 hours was plenty. Also, I thought people were exaggerating how much chocolate filling this makes, but I have to agree. I slathered it on in two very thick layers, and I still threw out about 1/3 of it. And frankly, I thought the think layers of chocolate were too much - they really overpowered the peanut butter flavor and I found myself eating around them. Aside from this, the cake would have been perfect. So next time, I will probably make half or less of the chocolate filling.

I first made this cake for my husband's birthday. He is a peanut- butterhaulic. It was a huge hit. I have made it twice since then. Men particularly love it. It is a very dense peanut- buttery cake, and the cream cheese frosting and sweet ganache between the layers really balance it perfectly. If you love peanut butter, you will love this cake!

The cake was good, but too dry. For as long as it took to make and for as fattening as I know it was, I don't think it was as good as it should have been. Again, way too dry.

This cake was good. It didn't wow me as much as it did my family (and they have pretty high standards so that's good I guess), but it was a solid PB cake. The texture wasn't dry, but it was definitely dense, although still cake-y and not particularly moist. I prefer more moist cakes because I'm not a huge cake fan in general. Just give me a cup of the frosting and I'm a happy camper :) The filling was pretty awesome, and I would definitely make that for some chocolate chip cookie sandwiches or as a brownie topping. The cream cheese frosting was delish, and I would recommend subbing pb cups for the butterfingers for those who aren't huge candy fans.

WOW! What a cake. It does take time and planning, but worth it. I used Reese's for the topping. I only had fat free buttermilk but it turned out just fine - no problem. I used Peter Pan crunch peanut butter - worked fine. I was so please with how it turned out - presentation and taste!! Will make again.

A birthday party hit! the cake is wonderful, although mine turned out a bit dry. The frosting did not need set up time in the fridge. I had trouble folding in the whipped cream as the cream cheese mixture was so thick, but it turned out delicious. The only weird part was the filling- mine was hard as rock after chilling overnight and I had to beat it in my mixer and add more cream to loosen it to spreading consistency. I only used about half of it. In the future, I'll use less chocolate (6-8 oz) to get a creamier filling. Feeds more like 20 as it is rich!

Well, hello all. Not that it's too important, but I am a 35yo man and I just started baking late last year. This is my 2nd cake, and I must say, the best thing I've bakes so far. I only did 2 layers, and mine DID come out very moist. I think I went a little overboard on the frosting, but I made it for a girl here at work and everyone just about exploded! It turned out really good, I will make this again as a 3 layer. Chilling things really helps keeps everything together, but I was able to chill overnight and it turned out ok. I did substitute Reeses Pieces and the peanut butter taste is phenomenal, I am very happy with this! pics here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/boyjedi/sets/72157603868674737/

I thought this cake was so-so. I love chocolate and peanut butter but the cake didn't have a wow factor to me. All the components were tasty by themselves but putting them together still didn't put it over the top for me. The cake was not dry, I was sure not to overbake. I did have quite a bit of ganache left over but that is fine. the cream cheese frosting was delish and light. I would only make this again by request.

Overall every part of this cake tasted GREAT! But there were somethings...I added 1/4 cup of sour cream b/c some previous reviewers said it was a bit dry. The filling was wonderful, but I didn't refridgerate it over night, about 4-5 hours. The frosting tasted perfect, EXCEPT it was more of a filling rather than a frosting. Maybe it was me, but the frosting didn't "set" and once it was applied to my (completly cooled) cake it slide down the sides of the cake, creating a 'ring' of frsoting around the bottom...maybe i used too much frosting and it was too heavy, but I was trying to cover the dark apperance of the cake through the frosting. In the end I melted a little of the filling and used it to drizzle over the edge of the cake and let it drip down...applied the butterfinger and it looked good, but not sellable to me, Great for family and close friends. Overall everything tasted wondeful, But I would substitute a different cream cheese frosting.

The cake was excellent! I made if for my brother's birthday- his favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, so this cake was perfect- I just substituted the peanut butter cups for the butterfingers and it went perfectly together! Another user suggested adding a little sour cream to the batter to help moisten it. I added about 1/4 cup and it worked great! I also added a little more peanut butter to both the batter and the chocolate filling. Overall a great cake, will definitely make again! Recommended!

I should preface this review with the fact that I do not really like cake (except carrot), thus perhaps I am an overly harsh critic, but I did not think that this cake was drop-dead fantastic. The ganache in the middle was delicious...but it should be, given the ingredients. My main problem was that the cake itself lacked strong peanut butter flavor. I think that I would make it again, but for others, not myself.

I made this cake for my peanut butter fanatic husband on his birthday and wow, did people love it! I didn't have any problems with dryness or oozing of the filling. I'm wondering if those who had oozing problems didn't let it set up in the fridge overnight. I let my filling set out for several hours but it still was too thick to spread on to the cake without tearing it up. So I just got out my hand mixer and whipped it and it was fantastic...creamy and light. It did change the color a bit because of course the cream in it was getting whipped but I thought it better than the way the recipe was written. What can I say about the frosting??? Oh my god, it was heaven. This will be my new standard frosting as well. I did put in slightly less sugar than called for without any consistency problems. I'm not sure why some thought it didn't go with the flavors of this cake, it did a perfect job of cutting the sweetness and richness. I can't imagine putting a buttercream on this cake, it wouldn't be edible because it would be so sweet. I did add a dollop of sour cream to the cake batter and I also used real natural peanut butter...I think the oil in the 'old fashioned' kind is what really makes the cake so moist. Will definitely make this again and again.

That works out to 964 calories per serving. If you pare it down to a modest 20 servings, it's 578 cals per serving. Not a judgement (as the cake is great), just for inquiring minds wanting to know.

Very good, 3.5 stars. Cake still a little dry even though I added extra buttermilk. I would also increase the cream cheese frosting a little next time and maybe decrease the filling. Overall, very good. Very tall, a little hard to cut.

I made this cake for a coworker for her birthday and everyone LOVED it! Even her husband, who had sworn off cake for the past four years couldn't get enough of it. I would suggest that you let the cake come to room temp before serving, otherwise it's a little dry. Mmmm mmmm!

2nd time making this beautiful cake. Follow the recipe exactly and it will not be dry, and your filling should not ooze, if you make it correctly it will be very firm. Let it stand at room temp and then just work with it. With the frosting, I added about another box of powdered sugar to get the spreading consistency; I think because our kitchen was too warm. Overall, MAKE THIS CAKE! It's fabulously rich and delicious!

This cake was delicious! I had no problems with running or oozing or dryness - and happened making it with only one cake pan in a dorm kitchen with very limited equipment. If anything, my ganache was a little too firm (hard to spread!) but it also ended up staying in the fridge for almost a day. This is a beautiful combination of flavors!

After reading all of the reviews I was a little worried about making this cake. The picture was beautiful, the ingredients sounded great...But there were complaints of dryness and oozing. I had no problems at all. I made the filling one night, put it together the next and then served it the following day so the flavors had time to sit and so the cake was extra moist. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of buttermilk (just in case) and I was careful not to overcook it. I also used Reeses Peanut Butter cups just on the edges and I think it was a little more elegant and more fitting with the chocalate peanut butter theme. The frosting is now my husband's favorite cream cheese frosting. Oh, I did not use all of the filling because I was so worried about oozing.......It was easy and fun to make and an impressive looking cake!!!

I seemed to have a bit of trouble with this cake, even after reading the warnings about oozing filling....the layers just kept sliding. After icing it and returning it to the refrigerator, it held up pretty well. The most disappointing aspect was the dryness of the cake. I love the idea of this dessert; however, I think I can find a better cake recipe and a more stable filling.

I made this for my daughter's 10th birthday party. It is very rich! She loved it! I made the ganache the night before. I took it out of the refigerator in the morning while I made the cake. I did not have any problems with spreading or it running. Make sure your cakes are very cool. Always when baking use the full fat content in everything unless recipe states otherwise. I also used Smucker's natural chunky peanut butter like it called for. The cake needs to be dense to hold the heavy ganache. I divided ganache equally between layers. Cake turned out perfect and I had no problems. I followed recipe exactly. Do cut in small pieces!! Enjoy!

Fabulous cake. Had no problems with oozing filling or soft icing. Perhaps you all are using a lower fat content cream. The higher the fat content, the more stable a product. If you can't find heavy whipping cream, I've seen suggestions of adding butter to increase the fat content. That should eliminate the oozing problem.

The cream cheese icing was fantastic and a great complement to the chocolate and peanut butter. Also, with other suggestions, sprinkled the top with chopped peanut butter cup. EXCELLENT. Also, I added about 1/2 c. of sour cream to the cake batter to ensure moistness. The cake was fairly moist, but sort of dense. I made everything the night before, and assembled the next morning.

Rating: 3
Elaborate and tasty. I sprinkled chopped peanut butter cups over the icing - seemed more appropriate! Chilled the filling only about 4-5 hours before spreading and that was fine, and used ordinary semi-sweet baking chocolate, though nicer chocolate would make it smoother. All very good - however the cream cheese icing is tops, would use it elsewhere; the filling is quite good; and the cake is an excellent layer cake, rose nicely, stacked nicely, perfect size for the 3 pans, but not too much peanut butter flavour. Moist enough if you ask me because the filling and the icing are both quite moist.

This was a big hit at a dinner party. I only made two tiers of cake in a 9" pan, then used the remaining batter for mini cakes. The cream cheese frosting is great. I also found that there was extra ganache, though I heated it up and poured it over ice cream when serving dessert. I agree with some of the other reviewers, the cake was a little on the dry side. I would use extra buttermilk or find some way to make it more moist.

I made this for a friends birthday cake. Everyone at the party LOVED it. There wasn't a piece left.

This is a good recipe, but it makes at least twice as much filling as needed! I was going to freeze half, but urged on by my husband and 7-year-old, I used it all. The cake nearly collapsed on itself. Also I might try using milk chocolate next time -- semi-sweet seemed too strong with the rest of the cake.

I made this recipe for a Golden Age club meeting. Everybody went for my cake,and within 10 seconds it was gone. I made your cake just like it was,except I change the peanut butter to JIFF, and I chopped fine Butter-fingers and put in the frosting,Then chill for 3 hours and serve. My cake didn't ozzed at all.

I recently made this for my husband's birthday. I must admit that I didn't try it as it didn't appeal to me, but everyone seemed to really enjoy it. Let it be said, however, that I had also made Ina Garten's "Outrageous Brownies" and those were the hit of the night. I heard way more comments about the brownies than I did about the cake! (They are truly the best brownies ever!) But as far as the cake, it is a monster of a cake. So huge that my cake dome would not fit over it. This cake would easily feed 25 people, as you only need to cut it in slivers. For those that love the chocolate/peanut butter combination and also love butterfingers, this is a great choice. It seemed to be more of a hit with children than adults, though.

Wonderful recipe. I do agree with some others that the ganache oozed and the layers started to move. I saw it coming and wrapped a springform pan around it while it was in the refrigerator overnight. That helped keep it in place. Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make again (using 1/2 the ganache). Yummy.

i'm a novice at baking (i've only made two cakes before) and this one was sooo good and fairly easy. i had no problems with the filling or frosting. one of the layers did come out very unevenly and unusable, but the cake was huge enough without the third layer! i made this cake for my brother-in-law's birthday (he loves peanut butter) and he LOVED this cake (so did my husband!).

I also had a problem with the filling oozing out despite following the directions to the T! Won't use the old fashion peanut butter next time- it tends to be runny anyway.

Rating: 3
I made this for a local cake walk but tested it first on my family (half recipe in two 8 inch cake pans). I had no problem with the chocolate/pb filling being too runny. I did think there was too much filling. You could easily get by making only 1/2 of the filling. Also, the Butterfingers turned gooey within a day or so, which made it look less appealing. (I topped it with Reese's PB cups for the cake walk.) The peanut butter cake is very light. It is the filling and the candy on top that make this cake very rich.

Loved this recipe - it's a show stopper! But the filling oozed after being in the fridge overnight plus the freezer for a few hours. Any tips on the filling would be most welcomed. I'd like to make it again without the oozing. faith@thomascallahan.com

Made this for a party. Received rave reviews from all. Allow alot of time for this one. Also, thought I would let you all know, I made it days ahead-put in freezer 30 mins, then wrapped real well in Saran. It held beautifully and tasted so good. It is thick, rich and moist. Cut small pieces for most. Good luck!

THERE WAS ALMOST A FIGHT AT WORK OVER THE LAST PIECE OF THIS CAKE. EVEN THE HEALTH FOODIES AND PERPETUAL DIETERS COULDN'T RESIST THIS DECIDEDLY DECADENT DELISCIOUS CAKE. THE FINISHED CAKE WEIGHTS ABOUT 10 LBS. I AM MAKING IT AGAIN FOR MY SON'S BIRTHDAY. I FREQUENTLY BRING CAKES TO WORK FROM PAULA DEEN'S WONDERFUL CREATIONS TO THE EVER POPULAR HUMMINGBIRD CAKE TO FATHER TIM'S ORANGE MARMALADE CAKE BUT THE BUTTERFINGER CAKE HAS BECOME THE MOST REQUESTED.

Every year we have "camp" at our house and the girls picked this recipe to make. I supervised while they made the whole thing. They put chunks of butterfingers on the sides of the cake too and it looked great. I wish I could post the pictures! We put the cake on a ruffled Annie Glass footed cake plate and I swear it looked twice as good as the picture. The cake was dry the first day and after it melded together overnight it drew moisture from the frosting and filling and was really moist and yummy. Think about quick breads. Who doesn't want a cake that is better when made in advance?

This cake was very good. But be careful to use natural, unsweetened peanut butter, not Jiff. It makes the cake and ganache too sweet. I would use regular sugar instead of powdered sugar in the frosting. I would agree with the reviewer who mentioned that you should make the frosting and cake one day, and put it together the second. The flavors work well that way. All together, a nice cake, a lovely presentation, and a great hit. It was on the rich side for me- I probably won't go to the effort again.

The only problem I had, was the frosting stayed very soft. I could never get it to "set". Otherwise, it was good and not all too terribly hard to make.

Recipe was easy to follow. It would be better to take two days to make cake (one day for frosting, filling and cake baking) put it all together on day two and then serve it on day three. Much better day after when everything came together.

This cake is just amazing,from the cake to the sublime ganache filling to the perfect icing!!! I am not an experienced baker at all, but I followed the instructiions exactly, and allowed sufficient time for the filling to chill and firm up, as I did the frosting...and the results are GREAT!!! The filling is rich, and not to sweet, it really compliments the PB cake which is incredibly fluffy and delicately flavoured...Couple that with the candy and the cream cheese frosting, and all the textures and flavours are so delicious. WIll defineitely make it again

Another note -- in order to make a less-huge cake, the second time I made this I cut the recipe in half and baked it in 2 eight-inch round pans. No problem there! I highly recommend this if you're serving this cake for a smaller group.

I've made this twice and gotten rave reviews both times. I used buttermilk powder + water for the buttermilk, w/no problem. You really do have to chill the filling overnight -- the first time I did, and it was no problem. The second time I did not, only put it in the fridge for 5 hours, and it was a gloppy mess. Two hours in the freezer helped, but the filling still ran off the cake. Something about overnight in the fridge makes it work here!

I had to keep running out for ingredients, so I was so relieved when it was all worth it and the cake was delicious! Even though it's a huge cake, our friends helped us eat it up in no time. The only thing I did differently was omit the butterfingers- didn't miss them at all and think it would be too sweet with them.

Rating: 3
So, yeah, I will make this again...as soon as I no longer must attempt the complicated feat in my tiny Manhattan "kitchen." And I attempt plenty in that "kitchen"; this was simply trying. The cake pans, batter, butterfingers and cream cheese perched precariously atop every surface suggest that this cake requires a more suburban setting for its creation. Even though I added extra buttermilk per all the reviews of dryness, it was still a bit dry. My brunch guests and I just threw it in the microwave for 15 seconds/piece and the gooey chocolate and icing made it seem much less dry. Fun, and a very pretty presentation!

I brought this to a cookout and everyone loved it. One friend called it "a crime against humanity!" It is probably the most decadent looking cake I've ever made. Personally, I have never cared for the combo of cream cheese and chocolate, so I would use a plain buttercream icing next time, but I was clearly in the minority on that! I found that the ganache filling does need to be left at room temperature for awhile before filling or else it will not be spreadable. The icing, on the other hand, was VERY soft and spreadable ... bordering on too soft. The candy and peanut topping was the clincher ... it appeals to the kid in all of us. Serve this one in thin slices -- a little goes a long way! One cake could easily serve 16 to 20 people.

I loved this cake and so did my family. I have had to make it several times per their request. The ganache filling is very rich, but tasty and the cream cheese frosting pays excellent homage to the cake. I liked the frosting for its light texture and have used it for several other cakes (banana and other fruits).

Alot of work for a so-so result. We'll keep the frosting recipe. The cake was tough though. Could've been 15-year-old son's overzealous use of the KitchenAid! Could've bought a cake from local upscale bakery for less than I spent on ingredients for this one (husband pointed this one out)!

I'm puzzled by this cake! I made it for a party last night and it looked amazing with the white frosting and the ring of chopped butterfingers and glazed peanut with alittle drizzled chocolate glaze making a pretty contrast in colors. Some folks raved about the flavor I thought it was good but not fabulous. Two things puzzle me. I make a lot of fairly difficult cakes and never have this trouble but the layers for this cake fell in the centers. I checked my oven temp and even re-made the layers making sure nothing was missed. Same problem then! Any ideas what went wrong? I'm also thinking that the author left details out that should have been in the recipe like returning the ganache to near rrom temp before spreading and a chocolate glaze to drizzle as in the picture. All in all I'll cook it again only if I'm asked to!

I made this cake for our weekly dinner group, and they LOVED it! I baked the cakes and immediately covered and froze them for an hour after removing from the oven.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday, and he absolutely loved it. He has been talking about it for the past week, non-stop! Everyone at his party loved it as well. It is, as has been mentioned, a very big cake, and we got 16+ servings out of it as a result. I had no trouble with dryness at all. I made the cake layers a few days in advance, wrapped them well, and froze them. This made them very easy to fill and frost the day of the party, since I didn't even thaw them before frosting. I made the ganache the day before and just let it come to room temp before spreading, and it was the perfect consistency (and didn't ooze!). The cream-cheese frosting was the best I have ever, ever had, and will become my standard. It was so light-textured, and the flavor was perfect! I assembled the cake and let it sit in the fridge for about 3 hours, and it was perfect for the party.

WOW! What a cake! Like a previous reviewer experienced, several of my Easter dinner guests (including my husband) are not really "dessert" people, but they all FINISHED their sizable pieces. Based on suggestions, I added a healthy dollop of sour cream to the cake batter. I also baked the cake layers and made the ganache the day before serving. I chilled them both in the fridge overnight. I placed the cake layers in between pieces of non-stick foil and sealed them all stacked atop one another in a huge ziploc bag to save space. The ganache (which I made with Jif creamy peanut butter) did have to warm significantly the next day before I could spread it. I followed the instructions for the frosting to the letter. I did top it with the Butterfinger pieces so it would look just like the picture (which it did!) but they did not keep well since the candy got a little gummy after a night in the fridge. Next time I will just frost and serve the candy pieces on each piece so that the cake remains pristine. It was GREAT for several more days!! Enjoy!

I baked this for Easter. Everyone, including my brother -- who doesn't even like desserts -- said this was the best cake I had ever made (and I bake A LOT). I opted for a simpler cream cheese frosting recipe (2 8-oz packages of cream cheese, two sticks of butter, three cups confectioners sugar and two teaspoons vanilla), but other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. And the cake was even better the next day. Definitely try this one.

I had the opposite problem with the filling. I had to let it warm up for a while before it would spread. I used the heavy whipping cream and the natural peanut butter, however, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead. If the cake part were any more moist, I don't see how it would be able to support the weight of the filling and frosting. Had no problem with the frosting. I used Reeses peanut butter cups instead of the butterfinger candy. I thought it more in line with the flavor of the cake. I chilled them before slicing. If people are having trouble finishing a piece of this cake, it's probably because it is so rich. Try a thin slice of cake with a small scoop of ice cream. Drizzle with chocolate syrup. Yum And serves so beautifully.

I, too, thought the cake was a tad on the dry side. My problem came with the filling, it was too runny. I left it uncovered in refrigerator overnight, but that obviously was not enough. I went ahead and used it (only half/drizzled some on top of cake) and held my breath when I cut into it. The filling on the outer edges was fine, but the filling in the center was still runny. My guests just assumed it was suppose to be that way, and I played along. Any tips for the filling??

Beautiful cake--just like the picture; very professional--the cakes were perfectly formed out of the pans. I didn't refrigerate the frosting and it was exactly the right consistency to spread and make like the photo. I loved the thick filling--save a little to drizzle on top. It actually should be made 2 days ahead--one for the filling and one for the made cake to just sit in the fridge and meld all together--it was LESS dry the 2nd day. Maybe because of it's texture, it holds together so well and makes a gorgeous slice on a white plate. If it's still too dry, add a dollop of whipping cream next to it. Because it is rich with the thick filling, the slices should be cut thin--so the cake serves many more than 12.

I was enraptured by this cake the minute I saw it in the magazine!! It was good, but the cake part was a little dry. It may be due to the fact that I ran out of all purpose flour and had to supplement it with cake flour. I may use regular PB instead of natural b/c I found it to be too chalky. I may also use more of it b/c the peanut butter taste of the cake was lost with the ganache filling. I though the cake would be too sweet but it was delish! Tip: let the frosting set for longer than and hour....mine was still glooping off the cake even after an hour in the fridge.
