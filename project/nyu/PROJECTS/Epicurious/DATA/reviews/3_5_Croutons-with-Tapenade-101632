This is my hands-down favorite appetizer and topping. I serve it with the croutons, chunks of crusty bread, or drizzle it over salmon or chicken for a main course. Family, guests and friends can't get enough and ask for it year after year! As a note, the anchovies can be left out with no affect on the taste, and while the ultra-strong taste of Kalamata olives are the draw for me, if they are too strong of a taste for you, the addition of sun-dried tomatoes will mellow the tapenade a bit.

Actually, this was not even okay. It was horrible. I am throwing it away. It is VERY sour. 2 tablespoons of lemon juice is VERY excessive. Other recipes called for much less. Or,it this another case of people OVER RATING recipes again. A four fork should be rare and BEYOND compare, so please do not over rate and lead people astray

This recipe is very easy to make. I made it first as directed it was too salty and the olive oil pooled on top. So, I tried again and kept out the anchovies and cut down on the olive oil. It was better, but missing something. I then added half an anchovie, but it was still not great. I thought maybe it was my bias, but it was definitely NOT the hit of the party! I have had good tapenade in a restaurant or a jar. This was not my favorite. I am still searching.

Made this for a party. Guests who swear they don't like olives ate quite a bit of it! It is rather salty, but that's what you want in a tapenade. Could probably do without the anchivies, though.

This tapenade is great. I made everything the day before serving and unfortunately I was not happy with the texture of the bread. It was too dry. The tapenade is so flavorful I won't bother rubbing the bread with garlic next time. And I think I'll try grilling the bread instead of baking.

Yesterday I went to a new bistro in our town. They served a great albacore tuna sandwich on French bread that was spread with tapenade. Umm great--so nothing would do but I had to try to duplicate it today. Mine sandwich was every bit as good as theirs. The tapenade is great too.

Made this using 4 inches of anchovy paste from tube and just 2T oil. Too salty for me, so next time I will reduce both anchovy paste & capers. Otherwise this was great.

Recipe is perfect as is. Better than any tapenade you can buy. I serve it on baby potatoes that have been halved, a bit scooped out, and then baked (400 degree oven) cut side down on a baking sheet lightly olive oiled and salted. Just stuff the tapenade in the hole in the potatoes and you have an appetized that is sure to please you and your guests.

Simply the best. All my guests loved it, as did I (and I'm not an olive fan!)

Great recipe! I've made it twice now and received compliments both times, even from people who don't usually like olives. I don't like anchovies, so I skipped them, and the second time I added another clove of garlic, which added an extra kick.

Wonderful! I made this for a "Holiday Party in Monte Carlo," so it fit the theme well. I enjoyed it, and I don't even care for olives that much. I left out the anchovies, and simply used garlic powder and a little coarse, kosher salt on croutons.

Excellent tapenade recipe - wonderful flavors. Made it exactly as stated. Did not make the croutons.

I made this recipe for a French themed party. It was an absolute hit. People could not get enough and everyone raved about it. I am making it again this weekend for a birthday party. I made the recipe exactly as stated above as I am not a fan of olives and could not taste to adjust it.

A bit too salty for my taste, but next time I will reduce the capers and should be fine. Very very easy.

Very good and very authentic-tasting -- it brought us back to the south of France! Served it at a recent dinner party and people raved about how good it was.

I made this yesterday to serve tonight. I thought it was way too strong and bitter then, however after sitting in the frig overnight all the flavors have married and it's wonderful. I too only used 2 Tbl. olive oil, only 3/4 tsp. of fresh rosemary and thyme. I also used anchovy paste, approx. a 1-inch ribbon for ea. anchovy called for. Be careful, even though I reduced the olive oil, when my boyfriend dropped his serving in his lap (!!), we had a very hard time getting out the oily stain. Very good when made ahead of time.

I have made this tapenade repeatedly since the recipe was printed in May 1999, and it's always a hit -- not to mention, tastier & cheaper than what I can buy at the store. Plus, it's so easy & fast to make.

Whipped this up in a matter of 5 minutes (and pitting the olives took the longest time!). It's a great quick spread. Did add a touch of fresh black pepper. Whatever you do, DO NOT over-process it.

This is the best tapenade recipe that I've tried. My husband loved it and he hates olives. Try it on top of a little goat cheese.

So good, you crave it again and again. Use it as recommended, or on bruschetta or a sandwich. Also good in an omlette.

I didn't care for this tapenade, although I usually love strong flavors. My husband and I came up with a different sort of tapenade: Mix together equal amounts of chopped Kalamata olives and sun-dried tomatoes. Add shredded Parmesan cheese and minced garlic to taste. Pour in some olive oil and add salt and freshly ground pepper. This is to die for!

I loved this! I modified it, hoever and tought you might like to know. I added about 1 Tb of finely chopped parslet and omitted the rosemary and thyme. I would normally never eliminate rosemary, but it seemed a little too aromatic for these flavors. I also used 6 anchovies instead of 4 and reduced the olive oil as was suggested by one of the reviewers.

This was just plain terrific! I'll admit that I did add some sun dried tomtoes because I had them, but even without, this tapenade was superb. I served with homemade pita chips dusted with cumin. This was even yummy the nexy day on a turkey sandwich!

What a WINNER! I made this recipe for an association annual meeting. The ingredients are easy to find (in a small town) and simple to assemble ahead. I will make again soon.

Great recipe. I was nervous that people wouldn't like it, but they did. They love olives so they liked this. I did serve it with spreadable goat's cheese as well, however, and that took some of the edge off the bitterness of the tapenade. The recipe makes a lot, by the way. (I was able to fill three ramekin dishes.)

This is a terrific recipe for tapenade. I like mine thicker, however, and less runny, so I use 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of the recommended four. I also use anchovy paste, though I'm still figuring out how much to use -- 2 teaspoons? I make the tapenade to have with a fresh baguette. Yum!

As a big fan of Peter Mayle's books on Provence, I have become a big fan of things Provencal, especially as regards the pleasures of the table! This elegant tapenade, simple to make with ingredients that most of us have lying around in the kitchen was evocative of the sun and soil of that region. The flavor is intense and complex. We will make this again soon!

People that like these flavors really liked it and ate a lot!

I served this with other appetizers at a small reception I was catering and everyone swooned over it. I made it again 2 days later when a family member came to visit. Both times I used anchovy paste from a tube, rather than mincing the anchovies, and on both occasions it was declared by every person served the best tapenade they had ever tasted.
