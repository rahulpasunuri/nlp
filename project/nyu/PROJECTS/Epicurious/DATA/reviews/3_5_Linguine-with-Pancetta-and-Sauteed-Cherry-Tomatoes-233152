This all started when I had a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes with no idea what to do with them. Heard on The Housewives of New Jersey that one of the Italian husband's favorite pasta dishes was a cherry tomato sauce and thought hmmmmmm....so I looked up recipes on epicurious and found this recipe. Had everything I was looking for: speed, convenience and lots of flavor. Made it for myself since my husband works nights and it was delicious! Didn't measure anything but just eyeballed quantities of oil, cheese, etc. and it was great! Other than quantities, followed all of the diretions except skipped basil since I was out. Next time will make on the weekend when my hubby is home so he can enjoy it too! (and will add basil!)

Easy but not much to it-increased the pancetta and still not much flavor-wouldn't make it again even though it was quick.

Perfect for using the overgrowth of basil in the garden. I substituted lean bacon for the pancetta. I added the peppers with the garlic after the bacon was partially cooked. I didn't use enough bacon, so will increase that next time. And there definitely will be a next time.

Wonderful. Made this with fresh homemade pasta. Easy and so good! My garlic didn't turn black either. Try grating the garlic rather than chopping.

This recipe illustrates so well how wonderful epi is! I needed to use up pancetta and some of our glut of home-grown tomatoes. After a simple search, and reading reviewers' comments, the result is another fantastic meal, and appreciative husband! I added the garlic with the pancetta, as suggested, and just served the sauce over the pasta without adding the Parmesan - this we sprinkled over the top. Fabulous!

I just made this. While it wasn't bad, i felt it was way too heavy. the major thing i would do different is either cut back the cheese dramatically or just sprinkle it on top. i felt the cheese overwhelmed the dish and i couldn't taste the flavors. plus, with the pancetta, it's way too heavy with a cheese sauce. did anyone else feel this way?

Using this recipe as a base, I've created amazing results and gotten numerous requests for the recipe! I've tried it with several pasta shapes and my absolute favorite is casarecce. I use thick-cut black forest bacon...yummy!...and I've found that the cherry tomatoes must be absolutely super-fresh and sweet to make this dish work...and the smaller the better so you can eat them in one bite. When I can't find perfect tomatoes, I substitute red pepper which adds a great sweetness and is more readily available. I also add either chopped sugar snap peas or green beans along with the tomatoes/red pepper. This makes a very colorful and balanced dish. I have never used the basil, but I sometimes add more crushed red pepper. The best part about this recipe is how flexible it is. Experiment with it and you'll find gold!

needed to use up some leftover salt pork and a large tomato and stumbled upon this recipe. halved the recipe, and followed others' advice and added the garlic after letting the pork brown. simple, delicious, and fast. will definitely make again.

This was very nice-- simple, fresh, easy. I liked the whole, cooked cherry tomatoes. I also used spinach linguine and fried the pancetta separately. I'd use a little less garlic next time, personally. (I minced it and sauteed the tomatoes with it.) I'd also use twice as much pancetta-- it gives a nice textural twist.

This was very good. I used fresh spinach fettuccine and followed others advice about adding the garlic much later. I also brined some chicken breast, sliced thin, and sauteed in olive oil separately to make it a bit more substantial for company. I was glad I did that, otherwise it would have been a bit on the lean side portion wise for 4 people. Will definitely make again.

This was really good and very easy to make. I cut the garlic cloves in half and sauteed them in the oil until they browned and then took them out. I don't know how you could avoid burning them otherwise. Followed the recipe exactly after that and my husband and I ate the whole batch.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cooked the pancetta first before adding the garlic. This was delicious and quick.

I took the advice of the other commentators and cooked the pancetta first before adding the garlic. This is a great recipe. Simple ingrediants, wonderful flavor.

After infusing the olive oil with the garlic, I would recommend removing the garlic and setting it aside so you can crisp the pancetta without burning the garlic. I was short on cherry tomatoes and ended up using a mix of cherry tomatoes and sun dried tomatoes. I also used real, imported pecorino romano. This dish was just excellent prepared in this fashion.

This was good and easy, but I recommend the following augmentations: 1/4 cherry tomatos 3/4 baby roma tomatos angel hair pasta add long strips of pancetta into oil until cooked then remove and set aside. cook pasta until dente, then drop pasta into tomato and oil mix. covering completely with oil. Add basil. Then mix parmesean in slowly stirring often. Serve with cooked pancetta sitting on top or to the side.

this is pretty good. i thought it was a tad on the bland side, but my bf really liked it. if i want to make a pasta dish with pancetta/bacon and cherry tomatoes, i prefer bucatini all'amatriciana (there's a recipe on this site) but my bf prefers this.

this did not turn out well for me. garlic burned even though i added it after pancetta. i don't understand how the pancvetta is supposed to meld into the dish anyway, it ends up like randomly floating, as do the tomatoe and basil. i could rewrite the whole recipe but whatever. i reccomend something else

The garlic should not be added so early into the recipe. Mine turned black and caused a bitter flavor in the end. I will make this again, adding the garlic after the tomatoes have been added. Also, I think the amount of olive oil can be cut back, especially considering the fat from the bacon.

The secret to getting a crispier pancetta is to have the person at the deli slice it thin. It cuts down on the cooking time as well.

This is a quick flavorful recipe. Took advice from above and sauted the pancetta first, then drained it. (The pancetta had rendered over 1/4 cup fat.) Turned out perfect.

This was a quick, easy and delicious recipe. 3.5 forks. I had a hard time getting the pancetta to crisp, as did another person. Besides that it was great. I added more red pepper and sauteed mushrooms.

This pasta is excellent!! I used fresh pasta and fresh pancetta. My pancetta didn't crisp well so I ended up separating it from garlic and cooking it separately. The garlic turned black as a result but I mixed it with tomatoes anyways.....it smelled and tasted amazing. My foodie husband ate it without speaking and wanted a Third serving!!!
