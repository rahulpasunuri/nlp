I made this dessert for a New Year's Eve party, and used cinnamon swirl brioche-based bread from my local bakery, and added a cup of raisins that I had soaked in rum (the raisins were a tad dry, which is what I get when I buy too-big bags at Costco!). I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. For the bourbon sauce, I used a very good bourbon and, as another reader had suggested, added some grated orange rind. I thought the sauce would be bland, but paired with the bread pudding, it was simply divine. I served vanilla ice cream alongside. This recipe doubles quite nicely.

Excellent. Everyone loved it, specially the bourbon sauce. I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread. Let the bread soak in the mixture overnight. Water bath is a must when making this bread pudding.

Rating: 3
The water bath retains the moisture of the bread pudding. Be sure to use raisin bread with sufficient cinnamon or add a bit of your own (we like a little more intensity.) The bourbon sauce is lovely but I suggest doubling or tripling it as it does not make a large volume. Easy to make and well received by those around my table.

Amazing delicious and amazingly simple. I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread and skipped the water bath. Raves from everyone!

You just can't imagine how good this is. I quadrupled the recipe for a large party, and made it in 2 13 x 9" pans. I soaked the bread/egg mixture overnight (you can't beat the raisin challah bread) and baked it during dinner. As good as the pudding is - you can't skip the bourbon sauce. It truly is the icing on this cake!!

I made this after having an incredible bread pudding at a local Italian restaurant and it almost measured up to theirs! I used regular cinnamon-raisin bread and it came out great. Used the leftover caramel sauce on ice cream for a week!

Like others, I find this wonderful recipe works best with challah raisin bread. I also add cinnammon and nutmeg to taste. Fresh vanilla also provides an additional zing. And, oh, that sauce!! Great favorite for the holidays and just about anytime when there's a seasonal crackle of cool air.

This was a fabulous recipe. I took it to a Mardi Gras party and everyone raved, (great coming from s bunch of New Orleans folks) I used Pillsbury Cinnamon rolls without the icing and baked them a couple of days before. I soaked 1/4 cup of flame raisins in about 1/4 cup of Makers Mark bourbon for two days and added them with the toasted pecans. I did add another 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup cream as there was more than 4 cups of bread.

So I made this over the weekend, only I did it in individual deep-dish pizza pans. I didn't toast the bread in the oven, I let my bread dry out for a couple days. I also let the bread soak in the mixture overnight. I ended up adding 1/2 cup cream poured over the top of each one so the pudding was not dry and then I covered it with caramel sauce after it came out of the oven. I would make this again anytime.

We made this tonight. As with others reviesers, I used challah bread and raisins instead of raisin bread. I cooked it almost 10 minutes less than specified so it was a bit gooey like rice pudding, but it was delicious. We also added another tbs. of the bourbon to the sauce-- yum!

I make this recipe every year for our Kentucky Derby party. I use challah instead of the raisin bread and I double the bourbon sauce because it is EXCELLENT on ice cream later in the week. My friend who swears she hates bread pudding asks for this one every year. One of my favorite recipes.

This delicious dessert is even better when the raisins are soaked in bourbon or brandy before being added to the dish. Personally, I like to use a little less bread so that the custard stands out a bit, and I skip the sauce and use haagen dazs vanilla bean ice cream as a fabulous topper on the hot pudding. Having made this dish at least 6 times, it may be time for me to go on a diet!

I must have done something wrong - I've had better bread puddings than this - maybe I overcooked it? It was too dense, but it did have good flavor.

The bourbon sauce is like crack for foodies. Soooo good!

Rating: 4
A definite keeper. I thought it came out kind of thin in the 8x8 pan, so I doubled the recipe (and doubled the sugar as previously reviewed, so 1c sugar in the doubled recipe) and used a 9x13 pan. I use 1 1/2 loaves of Pepperidge farm Cinnamon Raisin Swirl..it's the perfect amount. The pudding bakes to the top of the pan in about the same time, allowing for big, moist squares for serving. Of course, you have to double the bourbon sauce as well. I have made this numerous times and always get raves.

This recipe was a big hit at a dinner party I went to. It even reheated well. We just warmed up the pudding at about 300 for 7-10 minutes and the sauce was ready in no time. The only changes that I made to the recipe were a tsp of orange flavoring and an extra 3 tbsp of bourbon to the sauce. The orange really added a nice accent to the dish and the bourbon made it even better! Wonderful!

Ok. I made half recipe. I didn't have any old bread, so I baked frozen French bread instead. Chopped it in cubes and left it to dry inside the oven (it was off, but still warm). Since the bread had no cinnamon I added it to the custard + a little nutmeg and I used about double the sugar too. Since I used Irish Whiskey for the sauce I pre-soaked some raisins in it. I poured the custard over the cubed bread and pressed it with plastic film. Then I left something with a little weight over it to keep pressing to soak the bread, and left it in the fridge for over an hour. At the end I added the toasted pecans and the "happy" raisins. Didn't waste the soaking liquid...I sprinkled it over, and the leftover I'd pour over the sauce. Check my comments on the Sauce (It came out delicious ;) Voila' :)

The BEST bread pudding

I made this dish using challah bread (one loaf) instead of the raisin bread and it was DELICIOUS. Such a decadent dessert - everyone loved it - even my best friend on a perpetual diet couldn't resist having seconds. I took another reviewers advice and doubled the bourbon sauce recipe. Good call. This is a keeper!

I am absolutely not a bread pudding fan, but this was so good and ridiculously easy to make. My little sister swears by the bread pudding at Claim Jumper, but their recipe is nowhere to be found online, so I took a chance to make this recipe for her birthday and she had seconds and took leftovers home with her! I even loved it on its own and was even better with the warm buttery bourbon sauce (which I doubled) and it worked out great! Used regular eggy challah bread and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup of raisins; let raisins sit in cup of water to get plump while I mixed other ingredients, then laid raisins on bottom of pan. I put the cubes of bread (one challah loaf) into the milk mixture and stirred it in, so that all the bread can get equally soaked with the milk mixture, before pouring over the raisins in the pan. So easy, so good: thanks Epicurious!

I made this for a dinner party to rave reviews . . . even my non-dessert eaters were licking their plates. The only thing I changed was to use raisin challah bread (often times bakeries will make this) -- there's nothing better for bread pudding than egg breads. Spectacular dessert.

I just acquired a taste for bread pudding and decided to make this for my boyfriend who loves sweets. He absolutely loved this recipe and I couldn't believe how easy it was to make. I used rum in lieu of the bourbon for the sauce since I didn't have any bourbon. The sauce came out delicious any way. I will definitely make this again.

This bread pudding has become a family favorite! I made it twice in one week -- once for a New Year's party and once for dinner with friends. Everyone loved it, especially with the warm bourbon sauce which is a must. The only alterations I made to the recipe is to double the sugar (I have a major sweet tooth) and add one chopped granny smith apple, which I thought added some texture. I would also caution everyone NOT to skip the warm water bath for the pudding. It definitely makes a difference. The one time I skipped it, the pudding did not come out as moist as it normally did.

I decided to prepare this for Christmas eve dinner at a friend's house that same morning. I used a fresh loaf of bread and only had time to leave them out for a few hours. I suspected they would dry pretty quickly probably due to the heat in the house being winter time. I also didn't have time to leave it in the fridge for more than 2 hours before baking. It however came out great. I didn't have time to prepare the bourbon sauce as well. After dinner, I poured a little milk over it and warmed it up in microwave as suggested by a grandmom there to help keep it moist. I then served it with vanilla ice cream and a spoonful of warm milk over it. It came out delicious yet quite simple. Everyone had seconds and there was no leftover. Will try the bourbon sauce recipe next time if I have more time.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I changed things a bit. I increased the recipe by 1.5 all the ingredients to make 9 servings. I used a whole loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinn. Raisin Bread and just left the slices out on the counter for a few hours. I added a 1/2 cup of raisins. I did not bake it with water in another pan, I just used my convection bake and it came out great!

We all loved it! I was so concerned it wasn't well cooked when I got it out of the oven, but when it cooled down, it was very good. I used a raisins bread with a swirl of cinnamon, to add a twist. The bourbon sauce was also very good yet so rich that we only had a spoonful of sauce of each portion - being the sauce type, imagine how sweet it is!

Absolutely delicious and an instant sucess. I didn't have raisin bread so I used Italian bread instead and added raisins in. I soaked the raisins in a little bit of bourbon to plump them up and it turned out great. The bourbon sauce is is a must have! If you're a big fan of restaurant bread pudding you must try this.

I too am getting rave reviews having made this recipe several times. My problem has been with the pans: some require I bake the pudding longer and I have to put tin foil on top to keep the surface from drying out. This requires a cut-out hole in the center to cook thoroughly however! Added a bit of orange extract along with raisins, a bit of tart apple and cinnamon. Delicious!

Excellent dessert--very impressive. Rich, yet remarkably light. I made this for a large group and it got rave reviews. Ingredients fit to-the-drop perfectly in a large 10" x 15" glass baking dish (will have 2 layers each of ladyfingers and the marscapone mix).

This recipe is a keeper! I've made it several times for co-workers and I get rave reviews for it. I use whatever bread is handy and add extras like raisins, walnuts or whatever tickles your fancy. I like to add a small amount of almond extract to round out the vanilla flavor. The sauce is great but I also add a little vanilla and a hint of cinnamon.

One of the easiest recipes I have ever made. The sauce is definitely a "keeper". We ate some of this bread pudding the day we made it, and then again 2 days later. It tasted even better 2 days later after all of the pudding flavors had a chance to mix in with the bread.

The best bread pudding I have ever had!! I used a dense bread that had LOTS of cinnamon and it was perfect. I thought the sweetness was just right once you add the bourbon sauce, so I wouldn't recommend the extra sugar that some have suggested. Will keep this one to make over and over.

I found the pudding itself to be VERY bland, even with the addition of extra cinnamon, raisins and pecans. The texture of the pudding was fine, but the sauce overpowered it. In fact, the pudding was so tasteless in comparison that both my husband and I scraped the sauce off the top and ate it with the ice cream that I served on the side. DEFINITELY wouldn't make the pudding again, might make the sauce...

This has become one of my 'signature desserts'. Everyone loves it. Only modifications needed: 1) Some bread is wetter/drier. Adjust for the moisture level of the bread. Start with a little less bread than the recipe calls for, and add more until the texture is right. 2) Do not use a cheap well brand bourbon. Use a premium brand like Maker's Mark or Rebel Yell. A harsh bourbon will make the sauce inelegant.

I made this dish for my father's birthday a few weeks ago and he is still raving about it...said it is the best he has ever had. Very light texture and easy to make. I added a bit more salt to the sauce, as I found it a bit too sweet. Incredible dessert overall.

First time I've made bread pudding (or any pudding for that matter). Unfortunately, I realised too late that I'd forgotten to cook the pudding in the water bath as directed and the pudding was a little too dry but it was still excellent nevertheless and the bourbon sauce (I substituted cognac for the bourbon) helped make up for the dryness. Still, everybody loved it, including myself and I will definitely be making this again.

yummy, cold-day comfort food. i used enriched soy milk instead to replace the dairy, sprinkled raw walnut on top which toasted themselves as the dessert cooked, and brandy in the sauce. i didn't bother to refrigerate it - just made sure the bread was soaked before popping it in the oven. delicioso!

This is wonderful! I doubled the sugar and added extra bourbon to the sauce (as recommended by previous reviewers). I also used my own homemade raisin bread (made with golden raisins - in a bread machine). I picked this recipe because of the two hour refrigeration time.

I don't usually give recipes a 4-fork vote. This, however, is AMAZING & deserves every fork imaginable. Partly because of the delicious flavour & partly because you get a huge return for very little effort. I have shared the recipe with all my co-workers, positively INSISTING that they go home & try it ! It is now a keeper for them, too. Don't omit the Bourbon Sauce. You don't need much & its a perfect complement to the pudding. A scoop of Haagen-Daaz vanilla ice-cream doesn't hurt either ! Cuts the buttery richness nicely. Altogether a great dessert which tastes best after a light, healthy main course. A great do-ahead. Everyone I have made it for positively groaned with delight.

This was delicious! I made it for a dinner party, and multiplied everything by 1-1/2 and baked it in a 3 quart baking dish. I found that it made 15 generous slices, so you can probably get about 9 servings from one recipe. I substituted Irish Whiskey for the Bourbon. Everyone loved it! The sauce is delicious and not at all bland.

for as easy as it was to prepare, this dish was unbelievably delicious. it was beyond simple and everybody loved it. i was a bit concerned, though, by the thin, soaggy bottom layer. i don't know if anybody else encountered this minor flaw. since it was just as good the second day, i wonder, if i used stale bread, could i prepare the pudding the night before and bake it before guests arrive the next day.

This one is a keeper. I never fancied myself a bread pudding fan but this is wonderful. Be sure and make it with a light, yeasty bread (cinnamon rolls work great); I made it twice and the second time it wasn't nearly as good because the bread was much more dense. I left out the nuts, but I thought the amounts of sugar and bourbon were just right. DON'T SKIP THE SAUCE! It makes an already delicious dessert fabulous.
