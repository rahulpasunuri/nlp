We've made this many years in a row. A family favorite.

I first reviewed this recipe in 2006 after making it 3 years running. Here in 2009, we are still making it. I still stress brining. And will add that it is important to make the Giblet Stock which is sort of "hidden" in the recipe as a link; it is vital to the gravy flavor.

Made with CROWN OF PORK. Worked BEAUTIFULLY. Some minor modifications: added about two tablespoond of shallot infused red wine vinegar to the glaze in order to cut down on excessive sweetness. Basted with home squeezed orange juice every half hour or so to ensure good crust. Got wonderful pan juices, about three cups (thick enough to be used as sauce once blended and strained without the need for thickening agents). The bad, presentation fell through because meat was so tender it fell off the bone and didn't quite slice. No complaints here though!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. It got rave reviews from all 33, even the kids...I do recommend using a fresh turkey.

This was the first time I made this turkey for Thanksgiving and it won't be the last. Brine for as long as possible. I used an organic free range turkey. It was great!

I first reviewed this recipe in 1999 when making it for the fourth year in a row. Well, it's 2007 and the family still won't let me make it any other way. Nuff said.

My husband and I have prepared this turkey for the past 3 Thanksgivings. We'd like to try something new one year but we can't seem to break away from this one--it's just too tasty! Be sure to brine; in fact, we recommend brining 24 hours. We have found that the turkey itself doesn't matter--as long as it is brined well, it will be juicy, so save your money and buy the supermarket special. Perhaps next year, we'll venture out and try something new. Naaaah . .

Judging by the great reviews that this recipe received, I prepared this for Thanksgiving Day. Let me start by saying that I am a caterer by profession and that I love to cook, but this recipe was not the worth the time that it took to prepare. Yes, the turkey cooked up moist because of the brine. My problem was with the jelly mixture/glaze. You would think that it would have been very flavorful but I found that it didn't penetrate the turkey beyond the surface. The least memorable turkey I've prepared so far.

I have made this several years in a row for thanksgiving - and every one was "the best ever"!

This is the first time I've ever brined a turkey, and now I'll never do it any other way! Unbelievably juicy and tender, even dark meat lovers will admit that this is the most succulent white meat you'll ever have on a turkey. The gravy was also wonderful and was a great complement to the meat. Highly recommend!

Like the others, this is my fourth year making this turkey. It is the absolute best. Made with the sausage, pear and parsnip stuffing (same issue) it doesn't last long enough for left-overs.

I'm searching for Thanksgiving recipes and remember that this is the one I made last year. With 14 guests, all agreed it was the ultimate turkey. I don't think I'll look any further. It's impossible to top "the best ever." The brining is essential to achieving the magic. Don't skip ingredients or steps. This one can't miss!

I adapted this for a whole turkey breast and it was so good I'll definitely make it again for the holidays.

actually used this recipe for chicken during christmas, quartering ingredients or to taste. excellent juicy chicken. my family raved over the flavor and tenderness of the meat. i thought the gravy wasn't quite sweet enough to match the sweet glaze, so i actually added red currant jelly to it (not in the paste). then the gravy complemented the chicken well. might try this recipe with turkey next thanksgiving.

Like Buddy from San Jose, I can't stop making this turkey. I'll be making it this year for the fourth Thanksgiving in a row. It's basically a perfect recipe. I do modify the broth, making it in huge quantities and using all the turkey necks I can find. This makes the best broth I've ever tasted, and I love to freeze it and use it in all sorts of other dishes. People ask me the secret of this turkey, and when I tell them the recipe they say "too complicated". But they all say it's the best they've ever tasted, so it's well worth the effort.

The use of the brine is invaluable with any poultry. It is so much better than a marinade because it penetrates the meat much more thoroughly than a marinade. The meat was juicy and succulent. The currant glaze added just the right amount of interest to what can sometimes be a rather mundane main course.

Excellent!

I made this the first time from the original magazine article (which I still have). Today I am making it for the third time for x-mas dinner. I suppose by now I should be trying something else but the whole family say's this is the best turkey they have ever had and the red current glaze makes a beautiful presentation. The big problem with this recipie is that it's so good that it's hard to let go and try something else.

Used this recipe for thanksgiving with great success. Turkey meat was wonderfully moist and juicy which is what counts most with our guests. The glaze gave this dish a special touch.

I served this recipe on Easter and it was a huge success. My guests said that it was the best turkey they ever had. I will definitely make it again -- maybe for Thanksgiving or Christmas.
