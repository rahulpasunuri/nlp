Hearty and easy soup- I used a very good ham shank (since the meat provides a lot of the flavor, I didn't want to skimp) and heirloom yellow-eyed beans, and canned tomatoes. The arugula was good but the soup could be enjoyed without it. This is going on my short list.

This was delicious, but I made a few modifications. I made it more like a stew - using less of the cooking liquid and less stock. I used more tomatoes (canned diced tomatoes) and also used some of the liquid from canned beans to thicken. I also added strips of bacon, a splash of balsamic vinegar and more time to pump up the flavor a bit.

Very good soup. I added carrots and celery and omitted the arugula. Makes lots!!

This soup was only fair and I generally adore anything ham hocky. It lacked flavor and texture and unlike other reviewers I didn't find any enhancement by allowing the flavors to meld the next day. My ham hocks are better spent elsewhere.

Great soup! I added carrots and celery to this as well, used spinach at the end instead of arugula and loved the addition! I will make this again.

I also used a leftover ham bone instead of ham hocks, just because I had it on hand, and it turned out great--I let the stock simmer for much longer than the recipe calls for, though--all day, really. The only other changes I made were to add the tomatoes near the end of cooking the soup (as others mention here, tomatoes toughen beans--I'm not sure why the recipe calls for adding them before adding the beans), add some extra ham and just serve the corn bread on the side instead of as croutons--it tastes great on its own.

This soup is hearty, rich and delicious. I agree with a lot of the other people here, if you stick to the recipe, it's a little thin...I decreased the amount of chix stock, (6 Cups), and increased the amount of onion, garlic, and herbs by an extra 50%. Have made it with just smoked ham hocks and with ham bone.....I liked it both ways, ham hocks give more smokey flavor. Have made it with bacon fat as well as with olive oil...again liked it both ways. Also have made with and w/o greens...again, both good. A great hearty soup for a cold winter day.

I really like this recipe, but my wife and I prefer a heartier soup so we modified it to meet our tastes. First, we use 2 lbs. of smoked ham hocks and 8 cups of water. We increase the beans to 1 1/2 lbs. and finally we add cooked ham (from a ham bone if possible or a package of julienned) 5 minutes before we serve. I used spinach since I had some on hand instead of arugula. To give the soup a creamy taste I pureed 3 cups of beans with broth and added it back. This is a great meal with a salad and some multi-grain bread.

using as much liquid would really result in a thin soup. I used less water, added a couple of chopped celery stalks and mixed in some vegetable broth along with chicken broth to give a richer flavor. I am on the fence as if I should blend a cup or 2 of the soup to make a creamier texture. This soup will be much better the second day as the flavors meld.

I have made this soup several times without the croutons; however, I experienced a serious error in the recipe by adding the diced tomatoes BEFORE the beans were cooked. After listening to chef Melinda Lee explain that the acidity of tomatoes added to the soup mixture before or with the dried beans would prevent the beans from ever becoming tender! Now I add the tomatoes (canned diced) AFTER the beans are tender and the soup is great. I also add a couple of diced carrots and 3 or 4 diced celery stalks for added flavor and color. If I have no ham hocks I simply add about 1/2-3/4 lb. of cubed ham ("Farmland" brand). It certainly makes a hearty soup...delicious.

The flavor was good - not great, a bit bland. Also, even though I cooked this FOREVER, I never got it to cook down enough to lose that cornmeal texture once it was blended. I added cumin and a bit of cayenne and that seemed to help. A good recipe for a leftover hambone but not worth the purchase of one. Maybe (gasp!) canned beans would be better...?

Very good and easy. Read suggestions, used olive oil and spiral ham bone. Pureed several cups of beans & broth toward the end to thicken. Next time I may let broth sit in fridge overnight to defat. Hearty and delicious on a winter evening.

Delicious. I too use the bone from a spiral cut ham, olive oil in lieu of bacon drippings and diced canned tomatoes. Last time I made this the arugula didn't look fresh so I used escarole instead. I think any spicy green may be OK. Freezer friendly.

I made this last year a few weeks before our annual ice storm. That night, my 40 minute commute turned into 2 and a half hours. I came home, pulled this wonderful concoction out of the freezer and it was hot and bubbling when my brother-in-law knocked on the door at 8:30PM to seek refuge from the storm. Everyone was so complimentary of my ability to whip up such a hearty and weather-perfect meal in 20 minutes! Shhhh!

OK...looking at the pot after doing the first part of this recipe I thought...man, that's just gonna be way too much liquid so I added about 4 cups of chicken broth and two cups of the boiled down ham hock broth. I also added one chopped carrot and during the saute added a couple of tablespoons flour and in the end took a couple of cups of soup, beans etc and blended it and added it back...that makes a nice thick homey soup. I used spinach instead of arugula and bacon bits at the end (didn't use the bacon grease, used healthy fat olive oil in the beginning)...was very good and my family felt warm on a cold Santa Rosa night...if these changes don't work for you, blame it on the Lunar Eclipse!

I am always amazed when I read a review and the people substitute and change the recepe. Cut out most of the fat (tast!) and then complain that the recipe was a little flat. I found this recipe to be great and a true comfort food.

We made homemade cornbread instead of the croutons since my family doesn't like croutons. This dish has become a family favorite. It's a relatively easy to make, stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal and it also freezes well. I make a double batch an then freeze some for those nights when we're too busy to cook. it also goes well with a hearty store-bought bread.

The soup was good. It makes a lot. I had to cook the soup for much longer than an hour to get the beans tender. It was worth it. At the very end, I added some half and half to make it a bit richer but this step was not necessary. Using a vegetable grater, I put slivers of parmesan cheese on top. This is a good and easy recipe.

Substituted a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 1lb of fresh. Added: 14oz can of navy beans, extra cup of ham broth; boiled down center bone from spiral cut ham instead of ham hocks; 1c shredded ham left overs, bag frozen mixed veggies (carrots, beans, peas, lima beans, corn) Used 2 TBS of flour +1/2c water to thicken No Arugula used dried basil (no Arugula on hand) Result: Satisfied kids, added texture, NO LEFT OVERS!! Served Family of 6.

I substituted pancetta for ham hock, and just removed the meat all together at the end - it was fabulous. The beans were still a little bit hard after many hours of cooking, though - I would boil them for 2 minutes prior to soaking next time.

I thought the soup was great. I used a leftover ham bone from my spiral sliced ham, omited the step of boiling the bone (hock), and cooked it with the beans in one step. Instead of the arugala, I used chiffonade of collard, which weren't as strong as the arugala would have been.

I was surprised that other readers didn't find this recipe more appealing. My husband and I made it - without the bacon drippings - and we thought it was excellent. The arugula does struggle to hold its flavor used in this way, but we did not think it harmed the flavor of the soup.

Okay...I was a little hesitant to try this soup based upon the previous reviewers comments. However it really looked yummy in the issue of Gourmet so I gave it a shot...with some modifications. I simmered the ham hocks as directed, however I only reserved 1 cup of the cooking liquid. I added the cooking liquid to taste and made up the difference in the liquid with fat-free chicken broth. I only ended up using about 1/2 cup. I also did not use the bacon drippings, I just used a cooking spray to cut down on the calories. The soup turned out fine although not as tasty as you would anticipate by the photo.

I am fond of both bean soup and arugula, and the photo in the November issue of Gourmet made this look enticing, but the results were disappointing. The arugula lost its characteristic peppery flavor and didn't taste of much at all. The ham hock, meanwhile, caused the soup to become very salty, even though I used unsalted broth. My tactful husband suggested the soup might taste better after a day or two in the refridgerator. It didn't, and after four days a large portion remained untouched in the fridge, which very rarely happens in my house full of teenaged boys.
