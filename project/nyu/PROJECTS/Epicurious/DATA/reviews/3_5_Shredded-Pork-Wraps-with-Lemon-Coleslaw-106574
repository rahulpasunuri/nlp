this recipe was amazing. the pork and the sauce combine to make a healthy, non-oily delicious pulled-style pork with a little kick. the coleslaw is equally as amazing, both on its own and with the pork. the coleslaw is light and lemony, not heavy or mayonaissey. my boyfriend and i both loved this recipe. we've been cooking from epicurious for years and this one is one of the best!

For us this was so-so. I can see why some might like it in that the flavors are rather interesting. It just wasn't quite my taste. I did not leave the meal with a wow, I gotta make that again feeling. I made this in the crock pot (as is) on low for 8 hours. I shredded the pork after 6 hours and left the lid off for the last hour to cook off some liquid. Made the coleslaw as well. And although the coleslaw was not soupy and I know how to properly wrap (fold the bottom in and roll) there was a mini-lake of liquid at the bottom of our plates. Will not keep the recipe.

Rating: 4
Awesome! So easy to make. The coleslaw is a MUST. The lemon with the spicy pork is perfect. I did follow the advise in previous comments and doubled the sauce. Also excluded the water from the coleslaw. Will most certainly make again!

Loved this, but I was looking for a way to use leftover pork shoulder roast. Also wanted something quick and easy and the hour and a half active prep time was a bit daunting. But this worked out beautifully with my leftover pork, and it was fast. I bought deli prepared coleslaw. To avoid the mess of juices spilling, fold your tortilla on the bottom edge first, then fold in the sides, kind of like an envelope. I'll make this again very soon!

I also cooked this in a crock pot. I started it at lunch time as I like my meat well-marinated and tender. Otherwise, I followed the directions pretty much as they were. Didn't have any thick chili sauce, so I added a little more ketchup and a lot more thin chili sauce :) Served with flour tortillas. (If you're dieting you could use lettuce wraps and not miss a thing.) The lemon coleslaw was a must! This is delicious and very stimulating to the tastebuds. My husband got out another pork loin right after dinner and threw it in the pot so we could have it again tonight. (I like the lemon coleslaw, as is. The only change I made was extra herbs. I sent my husband out to pick some parsley in the garden and he accidentally also got a bit of summer savory and lemon thyme, so I added them in. It was a superior coleslaw experience.)

Rating: 4
I had great success turning this into a slow cooker dish. I cooked the onion/garlic etc. according to directions, then placed the pork loin in the crockpot and topped with the sauce. Lemon coleslaw: followed other reviewers' advice and omitted scallions and parsley. I used half regular cabbage and half red cabbage. The kicker was julienned jicama. YUM!

Great summer meal and easy to make in large quanities for a crowd. Had only thai chili psate on hand, so substituted for the chili sauce. Also, added extra lemon juice & less water to the slaw. Used prebagged lettuce/cabbage/carrot mixture, as we are not huge cabbage fans. Big hit!

Rating: 4
This is outstanding. I've made it over and over for several years, and we never tire of it. I sent the link to a friend and he made it for a group of 12, with rave reviews. To those who don't think it's hot enough, try the hot sriricha. I use 1 tablespoon of that in place of the chili sauce and the tabasco, because I always have sriricha, and sometimes it is on the verge of too spicy. Coleslaw is so-so. Pork is addictive.

Rating: 3
This was a very good recipe, which I will make again with some modifications. I served the pork and slaw on whole wheat tortillas to try and add a bit more fiber (vs. flatbread or flour tortillas). Like other reviewers, I will probably double the sauce the next time. May also add some peppers to amp up the heat. Think this could become a staple as it's easy and healthy. One word of warning: our meat took closer to 90 minutes to get super tender. Maybe additional sauce would help!

Rating: 2
Easy and good but not great. Could have been a bit more piquant. Caution: the pork shreds sop up the sauce like a sponge: your wrap looks nice and dry, but bite into it and a pint of juice squirts out the other end! Don't serve it inside, at a stand up buffet, or to people who like their clothes. I might make it again, but it doesn't jump to the top of my list.

I have made this several times now and still love it! The only changes I make are doubling the sauce, and then using bagged coleslaw and still making the dressing. I like to make my coleslaw with cilantro instead of parsley, and I add sunflower seeds for some extra crunch. Oh, and I guess I always use tortillas instead of lavish. The vegetable tortillas are kind of a sweet accompaniment to this dish. Yum!

Ohhhhhhh yeah. Everyone loved this - I made it for boyf's first time meeting my mom, and I'm certain it soothed his Suth'n nerves a bit. Hee hee. I'll definitely make this again, but will probably double the pork & sauce, cuz there were NOT enough leftovers for us the next day! :D I'll halve the slaw next time - a whole head of cabbage was probably 3 times as much as needed for the wraps.

I can't believe how good this is. I can taste it now. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for the first time. The second time I thought I would save myself some time and make the shredded pork in the crock pot. I browned the meat first and used pork shoulder. It turned out great. I will definetly be making these again soon. I made the lemon coleslaw with cilantro once and parsley the next. Both were great.

We found this recipe delicious..cole slaw and all. The pork turned out very tender. I followed the recipe to the letter, lowfat options and all. It worked for us and willbe making it again. I can not imagine how one writer said the slaw turned out soggy. Ours was very crunchy and we make it ahead of time. The one dumb mistake I made was trying to blend the sauce in the blender when it was still hot..explosion! Won't do that again.

Guys- Save yourself some money and buy a pork shoulder instead! You will have to remove the fat and skin, but it is easy and at 99 cents a pound, it is well worth it, I think. This recipe was an excellent hit at my 4th of July party. I made the pork ahead of time and placed the shredded pork in one of those big aluminum party sterno warmers. I actually smoked the pork with indirect heat for a couple hours before boiling it in the sauce. I also made the coleslaw ahead of time, but used only half the lemon juice. Instead of the flat bread, I warmed up some corn tacos on a gas burner and wrapped them up in foil to keep warm. Then, people could come up, buffet style, and make as many as they wanted. Something different than the usual hamburgers, chicken and hotdogs!

We have made this several times - it's an easy weeknight dinner and is always enjoyed. I usually 1.5x the pork and double the sauce. The coleslaw is a nice compliment to the pork - although a bit too lemony (for my husband) on it's own.

This recipe is a little fussy--the coleslaw part at least--but it's worth it. The lemon with the smoky pork is an excellent and unusual combo.

Rating: 3
I only made the shredded pork (unfortunately my boyfriend does not like coleslaw) - it was great. Not the typical barbeque flavor, but it definitely worked. I doubled the sauce, and next time I may add a little brown sugar to it. The pork itself took little to no effort beyond sauteeing the onions and mixing the sauce - after that just placed it in the pot and walked away for 45 min. After pureeing the sauce (which was easy and worth it b/c it helps to thicken the sauce a bit), I put it back in the pot (sans the pork) to thicken the sauce even more before mixing it in with the pork. Can't wait to make again (next time I'll insist on the lemon slaw).

Good recipe with some very interesting comments in the reviews. Because of the reviews I doubled most of the spices, garlic, etc., and did not attempt to blend the sauce. The flavors were excellant and the only problem that I ran into was attempting to hold the lavash together. We also agreed the lemon coleslaw really added a needed flavor to this recipe. Next time I won't bother putting the sugar in the coleslaw, it is not needed for taste or carbs.

My family and I loved this! No need to puree the sauce...it blended in quite well with the shredded pork. Also, plain tortilla's worked just fine in a pinch! Absolutely loved the lemon coleslaw with this. The flavors of the pork with the coleslaw complimented each other wonderfully! I do agree with other readers on doubling the amount of meat and sauce!! It's soooo good and even better left over the next day! I'm getting ready to make this for dinner tonight (my second time making this dish) and am already anticipating eating it! So glad my New Year's diet starts tomorrow!!

I have made this recipe many times, with both prok and chicken. Both are wonderful. The meat and the coleslaw are very good left over, and I have even made double the meat portion of the recipe and frozen half to make my life easier next time. The thicker flatbread rounds are also very good. Definately not bland.

The pork came out too watery. The flavor of it was just okay.I bought regular coeslaw and made a wrap with the pork and that. The coleslaw did not go with the pork. It took away from the flavor of the pork. Eveything was a soggy mess, too. I would not make this again.

Excellent & very easy. Made the recipe as stated and it was wonderful. I made it two days in advance of serving (Thursday evening for Saturday lunch) and it kept very well. The pork soaked up additional sauce and made it very tender. Didn't try the lemon coleslaw based on the reviews regarding storage, used Whole Foods cabbage slaw with cider vinegar and added my own fresh lemon juice. Will definitely make again this summer.

A little disappointed at the lack of flavor of the pork. It thought that it truly needed more "kick". I used greek style pitas for the "wrap" and it worked wonderfully. This was ok but for the work involved, I think I'll pass.

An update on the question of whether chicken can be used for non-pork eaters. My non-pork eater also doesn't like dark meat chicken (he likes his boneless, skinless breasts), so I thought that I'd try turkey breast, thinking it might have a little more integrity and might stand up to the spicy sauce. But alas, there was no turkey at the store. So I tried chicken. I didn't put in the chili sauce, but instead added a jalapeno. I also thought I had Worcestershire sauce (who doesn't?) but it turns out in our last move we got rid of it. So I put in some steak sauce and a little soy sauce instead. The basic gist of this review is that you CAN use chicken. I simmered the breasts for about 25 minutes, until they were perfectly shreddable. With just the jalapeno, there really wasn't much zing -- the chicken could have handled more. Add the chicken to the lemon cole slaw (I used cilantro instead of parsley), and it was all quite a tasty and satisfying dish.

DELICIOUS. I am not a fan of coleslaw, but it's ok here. I found the recipe to have just the right kick and the right amount of sauce. I only had pork chops so I cut them into strips and threw them in the pot. Will make again for sure!

I think chicken breasts might not work, but maybe using a dark meat like thighs. Also, shredded beef would be very good with it and would hold up to the spiciness of the sauce.

Delicious - my two-year-old even ate it with gusto. I made them with the lemon coleslaw, and used flour tortillas since I couldn't find the lavash. I'd have preferred something thicker like the lavash, but tortillas did fine in a pinch. The flavors married beautifully.

Very good. The sauce was very spicy, it was great! Surprized cause only two tsp of tabasco for real heat, but it works! We loved these wraps and thought the coleslaw was great too. Perhaps the reviewer before should try another brand of chili sauce? We used Heinz chili sauce. I dont know why they had such poor results, I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

Wow. I just don't get it. We had to work hard to take this recipe from bland to average. I followed the recipes exactly, and we were incredibly disappointed. After much doctoring of the pork, it wasn't bad, but we have several better pulled pork recipes. The coleslaw was dreadful.

Too bad we can only use 4 forks to rate this recipe! I would have given it 6 forks! It's the yummiest wrap recipe ever! Don't bother putting the sauce through the food processor...I found it wasn't necessary. I also added cilantro and pineapple to the slaw. I should have doubled the recipe on the pork. We had a tiny bit left over, which was promptly eaten for breakfast this morning! The best!!

I made this for a summer b-day party. I needed to serve 25 people so I made 8 lbs of meat and changed the other ingredients accordingly. I made it all in a big nesco roaster on 350 for about 2 hrs. Tender, juicy, didn't heat up our kitchen, delicious! Then I shredded it and added the sauce all a day ahead and warmed in a crock pot to serve. It was a perfect make-ahead dish loved by all!

We loved this recipe! It was messy and drippy and delicious. I've already given the recipe to several people. One of the nice things about it is that it cooks quickly on top of the stove and so so don't have to heat up the house by turning on the oven, important as we're having a heat wave right now. The lemon coleslaw was perfect...refreshing and great with cilantro. We used the unbaked flour tortillas from Cosco and they were great.

Doubled the sauce, substituted lager style beer for the water. Used a 3 lb. sirloin pork roast since that was the cut I had on hand, cooked in crock pot low heat for 8 hours.

If you're a cabbage-hater, try substituting thinly sliced lettuce tossed at the last minute with only sour cream, mayo, zest and s&p. The lemon-y/crunchy addition really is delicious w/ the pork. Next time I'll try serving this atop corn cakes.

Excellent, just delicious and a little unusual because of the lemon zest in the coleslaw. I made the pork in the pressure cooker (~12 min under high pressure), which worked beautifully.

Great flavor and wonderful light weeknight dinner. Based on several reviews I doubled the sauce for a 1# tenderloin and found that it was too much sauce. Next time I may follow the quantities in the recipe. The sauce has a definite kick to it and may not need the 1/4 tsp pepper. The coleslaw was simple to prepare and can be used as a sidedish with other entrees.

Great recipe! I made it on the weekend and we had it for Monday night dinner. I loved the tangy sauce, this is a great rendition of a traditional recipe that would be much higher in fat, and would take longer to cook. I used Jufran Hot Banana sauce, a Pilipino condiment that has good heat and is available at my grocery store, for the 'ketchup style hot sauce.' I served it with the slaw in whole wheat tortillas. I'll definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
This is similar to Carolina Barbeque and very good. I like the tangy flavor, not too sweet. I cooked according to directions and then shredded the pork into the sauce and placed it in a crock pot where it simmered for a several hours. It did not seem to affect the flavor and made it convenient for a cook ahead meal. The lemon cole slaw is a little different and was well received, but I have one using lime juice with an oil an vinegar dressing that I will use next time.

I made this exactly as stated. Used Heinz Chili Sauce in bottle, a favorite of ours for cocktail sauce. We didn't find that there was not enough sauce, in fact this was perfect just as written. Had enough left for two wraps the next day for a friend that stopped by. Enjoyed by all and she went home with the recipe. Great with the lemon coleslaw.

Loved it! The coleslaw IN the wrap was different, but very good. This recipe can be transposed into a slow-cooker recipe very easily - just cut down on the liquid ,use a cheap pork shoulder cut(.99 - $1.19 on sale), and use crockpot on high 4-5 hours or until meat is falling apart.

What did I do wrong??? I followed the recipe to the letter and my pork never shredded, perhaps if you were a body builder you could of shredded it, but it was more like a sunday roast. I love shredded pork so if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. I live in Switerland, maybe the pork is different here. I looked at a chart to see how they cut up and bought the right cut but it didn't seem to help. The sauce was excellent and my husband loved it dispite the texture.

My pork turned out so tender and flavorful but you have to double the sauce. I also added way more mayo to the lemon coleslaw as that amount would make the slaw really dry and healthy but I needed much more mayo. Used the tortilla wraps. Good messy meal.

I almost followed this recipe to the letter, but I realized I didn't have the right kind of chile sauce, so I added extra ketchup and chile powder --- so I guess it was the same. I think you definitely need to make twice as much sauce, I did not seem to have enough for the pork, albeit, I think my tenderloin was bigger than 12 oz. So much of the sauce seemed to simmer away, but the pork itself was very good. I used flour tortillas and the lemon cole slaw.

My family devoured the pork wraps, which tasted quite a bit like Carolina pulled pork, without all the work. I found the pork very easy to make and didn't even bother to puree the sauce, although I had chopped the onions fairly well to begin with. Depending on the sweetness of the onion, it may be necessary to add a small amount of sugar to balance the sauce. I like things tart, but even so, it benefited from about a tablespoon of sugar.
