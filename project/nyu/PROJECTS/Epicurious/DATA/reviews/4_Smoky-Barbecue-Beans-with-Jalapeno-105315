This was really good! The jalapeños made it more interesting. I used smoked turkey legs and did all the cooking on the Weber grill in cast iron for additional flavor.

Maybe it was just me, but the beans suffered from too much ketchup. I think I will try the liquid smoke next time.

This recipe was simple, and the results got high reviews from my guests. I did a double batch, using an un-doubled amount of Turkey wings, and an un-doubled amount of smoked ham hocks. I also added a little liquid smoke to enhance the flavor...the results were great! I logged on today to get the recipe again for a BBQ this weekend.

Not sure what i did wrong with this. followed recipe exactly, but after baking in the oven, the beans were not tender, so i ended up baking for much longer and when served it starts looking like dried up beans.

Have not tried this yet, but expect to do so very soon. Toprevent flatulence, use the old Sunset magazine method: Soak overnight. Drain. Add fresh water and bring to boil. Rinse well and drain again. Then proceed with recipe. Another choice: To save time, use 2 cans beans -- but be ssure to rinse well to remove salt, then drain.

Fabulously good beans! We made with the ham hocks.

I have made these beans at least three times. They have been a huge hit every time. I used the smoked ham hock instead of smoked turkey wings. They are great.

This is my favorite barbecue bean recipe. My husband loves them too. They're sweet and spicy which I really like.
