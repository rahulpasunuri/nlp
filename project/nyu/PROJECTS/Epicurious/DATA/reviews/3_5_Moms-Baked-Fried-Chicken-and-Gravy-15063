Good old baked chicken! I substituted what I had: 4# drumsticks at 99 cents a pound, 3C leftover buttermilk for the marinade, and the gravy was a simple pan drippings with milk/flour and a little red wine for deglazing. Everyone went back for seconds and even thirds. Thanks for the idea.

This was delicious! The spice level in the flour used on the breading and the gravy was perfect. I made a fresh flour 2 T mix for the roux. This will become one of our regular week night meals.

This was so good! My husband insisted that I log in while he did the dishes to rate this one. Really excellent flavorful gravy. I used Tony's seasoning for the seasoned salt and paprika plus a little bit of cumin. Served with mashed potatoes with a bit of vinegar mixed into the cream and steamed asparagus; a perfect meal.

I tried the recipe about a year ago and it's been a constant in our routine since (like once every couple of months - this isn't a dish I'd serve weekly with all of the butter and sodium). One thing I do: we substitute chicken tender for a whole chicken. It's easier and my family prefers the chicken on more of the crispy side, which is easier to accomplish with tenders in my opinion. I also double the gravy recipe because my family loves to cover their mashed potatoes and chicken with it and it goes fast. All in all, a terrific recipe even for an amateur cook (like me). Try it - you won't regret it!

I don't frequently make fried chicken or gravy, and this recipe was a perfect treat, a delicious indulgence. I thought this spice combination was great--mildly flavorful, and nice. I omitted the scallions from the gravy since I'm not a big onion person, and found half a bouillon cube to be a perfect addition (more just seemed too salty, which is saying a lot considering I love salt!). I made sure to use whole milk for this recipe (an indulgence I usually avoid), and it made the gravy especially delicious. I served this with buttermilk ranch mashed potatoes and it was heavenly. I'm looking forward to making it again!

Really love this recipe. Love the flavor and yes, it does allow for you to be creative and use your own ideas, but rate this recipe for what it is and only rate it if you cooked it the way you see. All the "I did it my ways" are good if they are subtle, but when you completely change it, its no longer this recipe.

Rating: 2
I agree with others that the method is the great part of this recipe. I use my own fried chicken seasoning (see Sunday Dinner Fried Chicken in user recipes) and turns out great. I omit mushrooms in gravy recipe and use a little chicken broth rather than cube which would make it too salty. Therefore, only two forks.

Rating: 3
This real value in this recipe is in the *method* moreso than the seasonings. I used my "standard" fried chicken seasoning formula for the flour (a mixture of 1 Tbls. poultry seasoning, 1 tsp. pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 1/2 tsp. MSG ["Accent"]). You must go HEAVY on the seasonings, because flour is bland - just like with "conventional" fried chicken. The reviewer who mentioned the importance of using a pan large enough to allow some space between the pieces of chicken to insure crispiness is correct. I used a sheet pan (which has low sides) and I think that also contributes to crisp skin (better heat circulation around each piece). If your oven isn't perfectly level (you'll notice this when melting the butter if the butter pools in one area of the pan), then rotate the pan 180 degrees halfway through the baking time when the chicken is skinside down, and halfway through when the chicken is skinside up. The chicken was tender, juicy, flavorful, and crispy - and the gravy was delicious, too!

Rating: 2
I didn't think this recipe was "all that." It was good enough in that I'll make it again, but only because my husband said he liked it. I thought it lacked flavor. I don't know what I could add to make it better. I will say that I didn't make the gravy to go with it because I didn't want the added fat. Maybe that was my mistake. If anyone has suggestions to make this go from 2 forks to 4 forks for me, I'm all ears.

i love this recipe! it is so easy to make and it pairs nicely with simple sides like steamed rice and broccoli. i didn't make the gravy bc. i was trying to keep it somewhat healthy (although i'm sure the stick of butter wasn't helpful) but i def. loved it. i also decided to drizzle a little honey to the top of the chicken after i flipped it over and finished the baking. my husband and i both agreed the little bit of sweetness was very nice and i'm going to make it like this again.

I don't know what I did wrong. The flavors were great but the coating was like cardboard over rubbery chicken skin. I soaked the chicken in buttermilk which was great.

This is the ultimate comfort food. I made the chicken as per the recipe, making sure I added enough spices. The chicken was crispy, flavorful and delicious - just like the pan-fried version only LESS WORK!! I made my (southern) grandmother's chicken gravy from the drippings and served it with home made biscuits and mashed potatoes. We had a nice, plain green salad to even out all of the rich food. Followed this up with some peach pie and it was like living in the south! This recipe is a keeper!

I've been using this site for years, but never wrote a review tho I have many keeper recipes in my box. This recipe is now one.

What a small world - and what a wonderful treat to have crispy chicken without the frying. Delicious! Definitely add Old Bay!

P.S. I believe it's important that the chicken be in a dish/pan where it can strrreeetccchh out. No touching. Get crispier skin that way.

Man. This was so good. And so easy. Very forgiving recipe. Forgot to melt the butter, so had to pull the chicken out of the oven dot it with frozen butter. Dumped in black pepper & paprika into the flour mix. Oops! Didn't make the gravey, but the "scrapings are going into the bag along with the bones for chicken broth. Don't do a good job of cutting up chicken. End up with "hunks of chicken". Will buy pre-cut chicken next time. And there will be a next time!

Excellent and very easy. Soaked chicken in buttermilk. Had no seasoning salt so used table salt and added a dash garlic powder and a dash of cinnamon to the flour mixture. Used baby portabella mushroom slices and chicken broth in the gravy. My two "picky eater" toddlers ate more than I did!

I got rave reviews from this dish. My windows were open and all the kids in the neighborhood came over to get a piece. They said it was the best ever.

Very easy compared with regular fried chicken, and still has a nice, crispy exterior. I will probably play around with the seasonings for the flour, and may soak in buttermilk instead of regular milk next time (I just like the subtle flavor that imparts). Overall, good stuff!

What a great recipe if you're hankering for the taste of fried chicken without the guilt of all the fat that accompanies it - or the messy grease spatters everywhere! Used half home-made chicken broth and half milk in the gravy, and minced onion instead of scallions and it was very tasty. Also added a generous amount of garlic powder to the flour mixture. The finished dish was brimming with down-home, country flavour and elicited many mmm-mmms from my family. Enjoy!

I used scallions instead of shallots for the gravy and didn't bother to soak the chicken in milk first. It still turned out well--as close to actual fried chicken as you're likely to get in the oven. A good weeknight dish.

I used drumsticks, cooked 20 min, turned then 25 minutes more and it was great. Nice and crispy on the outside moist and meaty on the inside. Very good flavor. I used this great garlic salt called Dad's Garlic Salt for the seasoning salt. Everyone loved it including my 4 year old and 2 year old.

This has become a firm family favourite since I first found this recipe around 4 years ago. It works really well with pork chops too, though I normally give them around 80-90 minutes in the oven. For "seasoned salt" I use celery salt.

Mine was crispy. The cooking time is off - (be sure you are at 400) cook it for 25 minutes skin side down and another 40 skin side up. When its done it LOOKS crispy (I used quite a big chicken though). Gravy was great, except I softened a few shallots instead of scallions. I made a roux with the leftover flour and then added a quart of stock (forget that milk idea!) and reduced it, and it was terrific. Mashed potatoes with cream and a can of corn and Bob's your uncle!

Beware of too heavy a coating. I didn't have a bag and hence rolled my chicken pieces in the flour mixture on a piece of waxed paper. I thought I had a light coating but my chicken turned out gummy and the cold leftovers for lunch were even worse. The only reason for the problem that occurs to me is that my chicken had too heavy a coating, but it was so awful that I am not going to experiment. Did not try the gravy. Ugh.

This was very good and a nice change. I would suggest trying Janes Crazy Mixed-Up Salt for the Seasoned Salt. It's excellent compliment to almost any dish. I buy it at Denningers in Canada.

Very good flavor. The gravy is really good on potatoes. I didn't use the whole boullion cube. Instead I took the cube and swirled it briefly in the gravy just to get a little flavor.

The skin was on the crisp side and very flavorful! Definitely would make again.

Great dish - everyone liked it! The chicken didn't turn out as crispy as I would have liked, but still very tender. How have people fixed that? The gravy was great but there wasn't enough for second helpings. I added some red wine to make it go around and, I must admit, it was great that way too!

Very moist and tasty. Didn't come out as crispy as I want it to be, but I think that's workable.

Not for low-fat dieters, however, nor for cooks pressed for time. We played with the seasoning for the chicken coating, adding some garlic. Next time, I'll scale back on the seasoned salt as the gravy was quite salty; consider carefully whether to add the boullion cube as well. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans, mighty fine!!

I wanted to make a good ole fashion chicken dish and searched this site and read many reviews on chicken. I decided on this one for it's simplicity and I am so glad I did! I soaked mix pieces of chicken all day in buttermilk, coating entirely. Then I used 3 sep pans for the oven, all with the 1 stick of melted butter in each. I doubled each ingredient in the coating and I too added cayenne pepper for a kick! Then I doubled the gravy ingredients as well. I had lots of chicken! It was incredible. The chicken, was so moist, I am sure soaking it helped a lot. When I prepared the gravy I chopped the sliced mushrooms to about dice and continued. My family devoured every piece of chicken and wanted more! I had lots of gravy left and thought how good it would be on meatloaf, or other beef. So I poured into a food processor and smoothed it out. This is not necessary to do but will make great leftovers and maybe I'll even freeze it for a later time. In any case, I was pleased with the results. Don't leave out the chicken bouillon cube or nowadays they have chicken packets which measure the same as one cube. For sure add it as it enhances the gravy flavor. I am making this again for the football upcoming on Sunday, sorry not a Bucs fan, still a diehard Dolphin fan! The wings that came out of this recipe were without a doubt perfect! I am glad I made this! I served the chicken with green-fried tomatoes and rice! Yummy!

This was really great. I took others advice and used a pyrex dish, hot butter, and the chicken had a wonderful crispy coating. My husband thought it was fried atop the stove! The seasoning is great too, although I do recommend adding ground cayenne (1/4 t. is all I used, but it really could have used a little more). Made the gravy without the onions and mushrooms, and it was very good too. This is pretty easy to make but great comfort food.

This is my second review of this recipe. I've made it about 5-6 times and have to say that it hasn't always been consistent. My findings? A glass (I use Pyrex) or metal pan is essential. Making sure the butter and pan are REALLY hot is also important. Oddly enough, I found salted butter worked better than unsalted. While the butter is heating in the oven, I bread the chicken and set aside so its ready to go when the pan comes out. Also, SEASON that flour! Its like mashed potatoes... You have to put in alot of seasoning because its such a bland ingredient. I put cayenne, paprika, garlic salt and lots of cracked black pepper. If the skin side of the chicken doesn't crisp up as well as you like it, put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Also, when removing the chicken to make a gravy, put the chicken on a wire rack in a warm place. I found stacking the chicken created steam and soggy skin! Hope all this research assists you make this recipe. I like it a great deal.

Overall, the flavor of the chicken was really good, my only qualm with it was that the breading didn't brown evenly (or well), and it didn't really stick very well when turning the chicken. I would recommend dipping chicken in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs (with seasoning mixture in recipe) for the breading (and that's what I'm going to do next time I make this dish. Great flavor, but the "fried-ness" needs a little work.

My wife just raved about this dish. She especially liked the gravy which I made slightly different. Since there was so much butter with the pan scrapings and the two extra tablespoons, I added much more of the seasoned flower to the hot butter until all the oil was absorbed. I then added chicken stock until I got the thickness right. After cooking the gravy, I added about 1/2 cup of half and half and stirred it in. The whole dinner was a great success.

An enormous "thank you" to the cook from Jackson, NJ. I made this recipe exactly as she (?) described, gravy and all, and it was delicious. The chicken unintentionally sat in the buttermilk for 3 days which made it especially tender and wonderful (we had a power outage due to a storm, 2 nights in a row, right at dinnertime, making it impossible to cook). My family voted this a keeper.

I tried this without making the gravy since many of the other reviews did not care for it. I found it to be the best "Fried" chicken I've ever made. All the pieces were perfectly golden and tasted wonderful. I did use all thighs thanks to a mistake at the grocery store but they all cooked even then. My husband ate 4 pieces and does not even like chicken. I would make this again with out hesitation.

Great recipe! Good flavor and easy to make. I used chicken breasts and left out the seasoned salt. For the gravy I added chopped onion and minced garlic and didn't add the bouillon. I also added a pinch of paprika to the gravy. The dish was flavorful and we loved it! I'll definitely make it again.

I followed the advice of others and used half flour and half corn meal. The chicken was great nice and crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I used a metal pan and let it get very hot before adding chicken. This will prevent the crust from becoming soggy. The gravy was good, just not outstanding. I would not use cayenne again as it made the gravy too spicy. Stick with the paprika.

Having had the benefit of reading other reviewers' comments and suggestions for this recipe, I think I found the combination that worked for me. Used buttermilk. Not a user of seasoned salt, I increased the plain salt to 2 1/2 tsp., and added 1/4 tsp. each of crumbled, dried sage and thyme. Reduced the fat to 2 Tbsp. each butter and canola oil. Simplified the gravy by adding the seasoned flour (which I'd removed before shaking the chicken) to the pan drippings, and using chicken broth as the liquid. The chicken came crispy, not greasy, and both chicken and gravy were flavorful.

Rating: 3
I only used 1/2 stick of butter to cook the chicken. After I read the rater who said that the dog flushed the gravy down the toilet I decided to change it up a bit. I left out all the gravy ingredients. I baked 5 bone in, skin on chicken breasts for 1 hour. Then I took the pan out of the oven and added flour to make a roux and stirred it until very brown. I added salt and pepper and 2 cups of water and whisked until smooth and thick. I ate it over mashed potatoes and anything else I could find and it was wonderful. I am from the South and we are the queens of gravy. Try it.

I love this recipe! I told my sister about it and now we all refer to it as "the chicken." The key to the crust staying on is to make sure that the pan is hot and the butter well melted beforehand. I do admit that the gravy is less than perfect, but still- YUM!

Is not an adequate substitute for fried chicken. Maybe I expected to much form the other reviews, but I followed their suggestions and it did not taste or have the texture of fried chicken. It tasted good and was easy, but I was hoping for something more like fried chicken. I will do it the hard way next time.

This recipe definitely needs the addition of cornmeal or cornflakes in the coating. I used only 1/2 stick of butter and felt I should have used even less. The browned parts of the chicken were crispy, but the problem was that not all parts of the chicken browned evenly. The other parts were mushy (thus the use of cornmeal or cornflakes to help avoid this). A convection oven would probably help as well or perhaps increase the temp. to 425 F? (Chicken was cooked on inside but coating could have used more time). Also I would coat or drizzle the butter on the chicken rather than having it all sit on the bottom. Overall, the browned parts of the chicken were crispy and good, but the rest was pretty greasy. I didn't make the gravy based on other reviews...

I tried very hard on this recipe even marinated the chicken in buttermilk overnight instead of just milk. During baking the batter came off the chicken and it turned out to be a big greasy mess. I would not make it again. There is no such thing as oven baked fried chicken

Very good, and easy! I too cut down on the butter, and skipped the seasoned salt adding a 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and white pepper. I also soaked the chicken in buttermilk for a few hours. This was exceptionally good, ranking up there with the Bon Ton chicken from this site (ok, the Bon Ton chicken still is tops, but this one works very well and is easier). Wondered about the gravy though, I poured off most of the fat, so it perhaps was not as tasty, and it got thick fast, had to add more milk. Served it with good homemade buttermilk biscuits, green beans and mashed potatoes. I loved it, family agrees. Thank you Epicurious!

I soaked the chicken in buttermilk, cut the amount of butter in half, and used half flour and half cornmeal. The chicken turned out crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy inside. I loved this recipe, and it was also a hit with my kids, who are not big chicken fans. I will definitely make it again and again.

This is the best and the easiest fried chicken I have ever made. I used paprika instead of cayenne and it added just enough spice. I paired it with corn salad, sliced tomatoes, homemade bisquits and was transported back to the south!

I made a few alterations to the recipe, but it was the BEST chicken I've ever had. Since I prefer dark meat I marinated 8 thighs in 1 quart of buttermilk with 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper for 3-4 hours. I then coated the chicken with 2/3 cup flour, 2/3 cup cornmeal, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1 tbsp seasoned salt, 2 tsp paprika, & 3/4 tsp pepper. Finally I cooked the chicken in 1/2 stick of butter with some olive oil.

This was excellent chicken, much moister than stove top frying. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and agree the butter was too much. Plus I took out the flour for the gravy BEFORE I dredged the chicken. Next time I think I'll add a tablespoon of cornmeal to the floor too make the skin a little more crunchy. BTW, the leftover chicken was just as moist cold the next day. Would be excellent picnic chicken!!!

This chicken was wonderful! I'll never mess with frying chicken on the stove again. I took the suggestion in some of the previous reviews and reduced the amount of butter. The gravy was just o.k. I made this dish for some friends and the next day she wanted the recipe for herself and her sister. They both made it and also gave it rave reviews.

This recipe ROX! It is way easier than the usual fried chicken I make. The only thing different I did was leave out the seasoned salt (I hate that stuff) and I soaked it in evaporated milk, lemon juice, and paprika. YUMMM!!!! It didn't need any gravy either, and it was mega cruncy which I dig.

Rating: 3
I thought the chicken itself was quite good -- incredibly moist (even the usually-dry breast pieces!) and with a tasty coating -- but the gravy gave this recipe that extra delicious, rich, and sinful "oomph"! I've made this dish twice, and both times my coating badly wanted to fall off the chicken, even though I sprayed generously with Pam. I did add about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture for an added kick, and reduced the butter to 1/2 stick, which I thought was the perfect amount. Overall, I really enjoyed the recipe and will definitely make this again!

My whole family loved this recipe. Husband and 2-year old daughter couldn't get enough. We LOVED the gravy. I used a 13x9" pyrex glass baking dish and half the butter. The chicken came out wonderfully crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. I also didn't have any problem with the breading sticking to the pan or falling off. The only changes that I made were to add a few dashes of hot sauce to the milk while the chicken was soaking, although I really don't think it made any difference and I also added 1 tsp. of garlic powder to the flour. The chicken was excellent cold the next day too. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Can't wait to make again!

Two forks means "liked it, didn't love it." All these wonderful reviews had me thinking that I was going to pull REAL fried chicken out of my oven. Guess I should have known better. I did marinate(?) my chicken in milk all day (with a little hot sauce and mustard thrown in.) I coated according to recipe, substituting a little corn meal for some of the flour. Let rest on a rack for 30 minutes before cooking. Used the bottom part of a broiler pan to cook in. Did only 18 minutes per side (small pieces.) The coating stayed on perfectly, it was crisp, and the chicken meat was certainly juicy. What it wasn't is the flavorfull, crunchy fried chicken that comes out of the skillet.

This is a very good chicken recipe and the gravy is excellent. For those who said that their crust was falling off, if you let the chicken sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes before you bake it, the coating tends to adhere better. I also cut down on the butter and added garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper and parsley flakes to the flour mixture.

This will definitely become a household staple. I am sure it will horrify some, but I substituted tenderized steak (cubed) for a healthier version of Chicken Fried Steak and served with a green salad and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes whipped with skim milk and bit of fat-free yogurt and roasted garlic. For dessert, angelfood cake and strawberries. Not THE healthiest meal on earth, but then again not the typical Texas Gut Bomb that my family truly craves (REAL chicken fried steak, cream gravy, butter and cream drenched mashed potatoes, iceberg/tomato/ranch dressing salad, peach pie and sweet tea).

I didn't substitute anything in this recipe and it came out incredible. I did however extend the cooking time to 30 mins. first side and then 20 mins. to make nice and crispy. I didn't need to add additional butter to gravy as there was plenty left over in the pan. My two year old son could not get enough of it. He almost ate as much as we did; we were stunned. I roasted garlic cloves in the pan and used them in my red skinned mashed potatoes. Great combo. Out of this world recipe! Highly recommended.

As a mother of two boys, finding this recipe was GREAT! Both the 9 yr. old and 6 yr. old loved it.(Husband, too) The only changes I made were to omit the non-stick spray and add ground sage and tarragon leaves to taste. The gravy, also, was wonderful. I will definately be making this again. Thanks!

I was disappointed. The coating was too salty, and even with cutting the butter to 1/2 stick, it was still greasy and did not get very crispy. The gravy was dull.

Rating: 3
My mom has made a version of this for years, and it is our family's favorite. I cut the margarine to 1/2 a stick and omitted the regular salt in the coating mix. Otherwise, I kept everything the same in this recipe. I've always made oven-baked chicken in a flat metal broiler pan bottom. Works great and comes out very crispy. I also usually let the chicken cook longer on the first side than on the second; in this case, 30 minutes, 15 minutes. The gravy was great, but I think next time I wouldn't add the additional 3 tablespoons of butter, just the drippings from the pan, because the gravy was a little greasy.

Everyone has a opinion but I thought maybe my suggestions would help the last two reviewers.All that I needed for that extra kick was lawrys tabasco seasoned salt. It was great..added that spice... I Had the same problem with my chicken not being crispy...Until I cut the butter to 1/2...

As my husband would say, "This is a keeper!" The chicken was moist and the coating was crispy. I cooked mine longer than the recipe said, since some of the breasts were quite large. I've never made gravy with milk before and this came out great! I made mine by making a roux first with the leftover flour and then added the milk gradually, it came out great! I added cayenne and extra salt to the flour, but no seasoned salt (didn't have any). The gravy had a wonderfully slightly spicy taste. I also served with biscuits, we loved this! (Except of course, my 6 yr. old who doesn't eat anything except Kraft macaroni and cheese!)

I've made chicken pretty much this way for years (as did my mother). I tried the milk (OK, half buttermilk) soak yesterday, but didn't see much difference. I just throw the chicken pieces into a ziplock bag with the flour mixture (I never tried seasoned salt, just salt and paprika, but always do 1/2 cornmeal and 1/2 flour). Like others, I don't feel the need for quite so much butter in the pan. Always great comfort food.

This was the best experience I've had in trying to fry chicken--the coating did stay on and the chicken was moist. However, I think I'll try Washington D.C.'s suggestion on using mostly bread crumbs with some flour, I would like a crispier coating. Didn't have mushrooms, and used shallots instead of green onions, and the gravy was still pretty good, it would have been a lot better with mushrooms. For those experienced fried-chicken cooks--does a glass pyrex baking dish or a metal one make for a crispier coating or does it matter?

I too reduced the butter and added cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the chicken flour coating. I also used a glass pyrex baking dish for the chicken, and it couldn't have turned out better.

I have never been a good gravy maker, my mom is so I don't know what my problem is, but this turned out wonderful. I'll be making this over and again. (To the cook from Chicago, the butter and the pan MUST be hot when you put the chicken in to bake. This may have been the problem.)

I didn't have seasoned salt, so my flour mixture was a little bland. I soaked my chicken in buttermilk, but then had a hard time with the coating sticking to the chicken.

Delicious! My husband is from the south and loves GOOD fried chicken. He raved over it AND the gravy! I only did chicken breasts and went according to the recipe except I doubled the paprika. I was really skeptical that the chicken would get crispy but it did. It was extremely moist and these were large chicken breasts. Since I had no scallions or mushrooms I used only chives in the gravy. It was outstanding! One tip about lump free gravy. Put the 3 tablespoons of butter and drippings in a pan and heat. Slowing pour in the flour and blend with a wisk as if you were making a roux. Blend until smooth and slowly pour in milk and continue stirring with the wisk. This was so easy and NO MESS! This was a hit!

This recipe is delicious! The chicken coating was nice and crispy, and deliciously seasoned. We have three small children, and they all loved it as much as we did. It was easy to make and a nice diversion from the typical Campbell soup, quick meals I usually cook that compromise a bit on originality and taste. My husband gave it a thumbs up, too. Next time, I'm going to try soaking in buttermilk as suggested by another cook and add a bit more cayenne to the recipe. But still - delicious as is, a wonderful treat.

I made this with skinless leg quarters and breasts and put in a pyrex dish with the melted butter,and left it in the fridge for several hours while at work. My non-cook husband managed to put it in the oven and turn it once, and I arrived home to perfectly browned crispy chicken. I was concerned that the long wait in the butter might make all the coating come off, but it held together great. I wouldn't call this company caliber food, but for a do-ahead after work dinner, it was very good.

Okay, even as a self-proclaimed "serious" (or snobbish) home chef, I have to admit that I occasionally must make comfort foods for my midwestern husband. This is in his top five favorite recipes of all time, and I have to admit that I occasionally get a craving for it. I make extra gravy to pour over mashed potatoes, and we both eat so much we are immobilized for hours afterwards.

Yeowza!Talk about comfort food! This is the stuff memories are made of. True fried taste without the bother. I used buttermilk for the soak and added Tobasco. I added paprika and a few more spices to the flour. Shallots instead of scallions and WOW! What a winner. I used a dark sheet pan and only 4 tbl butter and 4 extra virgin olive oil. It was crispy and delicious! Boston, lighten up! :)

YUM!! I made a double batch and my family loved it. After reading the reviews, I cut back on the butter and spiced up the flour with garlic salt, paprika, and cajun seasoning. As an experiment, I baked one chicken in an aluminum sheet cake pan and one in a glass pyrex pan. The glass pan browned quicker and provided a crisper crust, although both were fine. I did not add butter to the gravy, used canned broth and added thyme and lemon juice. I'll make this regularly!

We liked the flavor and moistness of the chicken, but mine didn't really get too crispy.

First time I made this I skipped making the gravy because I didn't have time. The chicken was good. I made it again and made the gravy. That was the kicker! The gravy is wonderful. I agree with everyone else to either use less butter or take the skin off. Definite favorite of my kids!

I was searching for a tasty, easy way to prepare the chicken breasts that I had thawing at home. I came across this recipe and felt it, "hit the bill". I too used less butter. I also added a healthy sprinkle of garlic powder to the flour mix and used 2 T. vidalia onion and a sprinkle of chives (since I did not have scallions in the house). Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears. Delicious, warm and "homey" meal. Might try this on my in-laws!

I did not decrease the amount of butter and the chicken came out somewhat crispy. Good enough for me considering I didn't have to take the time to fry the chicken and then clean up the stove afterwards! I will probably cut the butter by 1/4 next time. I used a disposable aluminum roaster and was very satisied with the results, plus, no clean up! A heavier roaster would probably help with crispier chicken, but the easy clean up was worth it! I did have to cook the chicken for 20 minutes longer than the directions said. I served with a salad and biscuits topped with the gravy.

Some reviewers said chicken was NOT crispy and brown..others described it as crispy and brown. A lot has to do with the type of baking pan the chicken is cooked in.

I used buttermilk, as suggested by some people and added some cayenne to the flour for a little more kick.

This recipe was really good. I was amazed that i got it to come out right on the first try. Actually, the gravy did come out a bit thick, but i thinned it out with some chicken broth and it was yummy!! I will add only half the flour next time. Besides that it was excellent. The chicken was nice and crispy, and if let to sit on paper towels for a few minutes before eating, it is not at all too greasy. I will definitely make this one again!

This is good old-fashioned comfort food- a dinner that Grandma would have served at Sunday supper. I used a boxed seasoned flour mix and skipped the scallions and mushrooms. I used Vidalia onions for the gravy instead. I used only 4 tablespoons of margarine and still felt it was a bit greasy but I guess it was necessary to produce a nice crispy skin.

My family, & the friends joining us for dinner, all enjoyed this chicken dish. Excellent comfort food. I'd give it 2 1/2 forks if that was an option. And for the benefit of the cook from Boston/NYC/LA, none of us is crazy !

This recipe was great. Even my husband who is not a big chicken fan liked it. I also only used half the amount of butter and used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup in the gravy. EXCELLENT!!!

You all are crazy. Let me say again that I made the recipe _exactly as the recipe says_, ignoring the other comments about their being too much butter--all I have to say is, I should've listened to the few voices of reason here. This was horrible. Chicken had to be seriously drained and never got crispy (also had to cook it an extra 10 minutes to be done). Gravy was viscous and tasteless. I wouldn't make any version of this again.

I made this dish for the first time and my family loved it. The chicken had a fried looked to it and was just as crispy as fried. I didn't make the gravy but plan to the next time..Thanks for a great recipe.

I will definitely make this again. The chicken was done perfectly in the recommended time, and although I also left out the mushrooms, my husband loved the gravy. (I didn't think it was super-special or anything, but he NEVER has gravy, and ate 3 helpings!)

This was the best "non" fried chicken I have ever prepared. It was quick and there was no greasy clean up. Everybody raved about the gravy. Perhaps the cook from Boston tried to lighten it up. These recipes are not for the calorie conscious but they are both terrific. The chicken was also good cold the next day.

YumYum. This is a total crowd-pleaser!!

This is true blue comfort food. Gravy turns out perfectly and the chicken is just like fried chicken, crunchy too! I made it omitting the mushrooms and although I am sure they would add a lot, the dish with just onions (cooking and green) was terrific. Sides of garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus made this meal good enough for company.

This has become a staple in our family. We LOVE it! It's a comfort-food - you know, one of those fattening but irresistible foods. You MUST serve it with fluffy biscuits and pour gravy over them too! MMmmm-MMMmmm GOOD!

The gravy recipe was an original twist on an old standby--next time I think I'll double the gravy recipe to have some leftover!

Didn't look like fried chicken and didn't make such a mess as fried chicken does, but sure tasted and smelled like it! I substituted the mushrooms with cream of mushroom soup and the gravy still came out great! With a side dish of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans it was a big hit with the whole family!!

This recipe is a for real treat. I decreased the butter by about half and made gravy with 1/2 cup chicken broth with 3 tbsp sherry and it broke the mouth. Sooo good.

This recipe was fantastic. I did find it necessary to add a few spices to the flour mixture, as well as the gravy. I would definitely make this again. My fiance loved this too. The gravy was so mouthwaterning and rich in flavor. I do however agree with some of the other cooks on the quantity of butter. The butter should be decreased by at least one quarter. I found that by the end of the meal there was more butter left than bones from the chicken. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables, this recipe is a super hit!

Wonderful! I followed the suggestion to use buttermilk and Hot Sauce as the soak, and I replaced the seasoned salt with a generous amount of Old Bay seasoning. Terrific with sauteed greens and biscuits with sweet potato butter.

Lovd this and would add to my repetoire.

My husband raved about this dish!!!!I only added a little less than half of the butter but I increased the seasonings--next time I'll add even more. The flavor is a little bland without adding extra to it. I also added worcestersire to the milk-yummy. I think that it also needed 10-15 min more cooking time. (I live in N. colorado) This dish is really simple--my husband could make it that's proof enough.

Yummy! The gravy was sooo good too. I will make this again but I will wait until I deserve a treat after a week of watching my diet!

The kids loved it! The gravy was wonderful -- I expect to use that recipe often. Next time I make the chicken, I will modify the recipe somewhat to try to cut down on the fat -- the butter was dripping from the chicken! I probably could have halved the amount of butter and/or used margarine.

I was overwhelmed with the flavor of this dish! The gravy is "to die for"!!!! I did not have scallions so I used half of a small onion. I would also prefer large slices of mushrooms - about 8 oz. as opposed to chopped. I will make this over and over.....

Nancy a cook from Seattle My family loved this dish! The gravy was very yummy! My daughter ate the drunsticks to the bone. I used the half buttermilk half milk and let it soak all day and I added the tabasco to give some kick. I will make this again and again. It was a little greasy so let it soak up on some paper towels.Doug young Ilike reading your reviews you sound like quite a cook!

This was a delicious dish! For the gravy, I used shallots instead of scallions, and I used 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup whole milk in place of the 1 cup milk. And it was really easy too!

Delicious, easy, fattening. The gravy is very good.

I used 1/4 cup bacon fat drippings in the baking dish instead of plain oil which gave a great flavor. Since my family prefers milk gravy, I just used the leftover drippings to prepare it. Wonderful comfort food without the mess of stovetop frying!

I was looking for a receipe that would prepare chicken to taste like my grandmas. Without all the work, this one came close. My family enjoyed it and it was alot easier to cleanup than grandma's black heavy frying pan.

This was amazingly simple and surprisingly good. I did follow the suggestion of a previous reviewer and "kicked it up a notch" by adding some hot sauce to the milk and some other spices to the flour.

Outstanding and soooo simple! Add some Tobasco to the milk to "Kick it up a notch!"
