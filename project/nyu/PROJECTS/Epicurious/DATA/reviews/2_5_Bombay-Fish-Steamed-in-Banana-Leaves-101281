Good,very easy - we used desiccated coconut instead of fresh and not as much mint as it called for (I ran out) - I'll try it again with more mint.

We made this using Black Cod and really liked it a lot. Delicious and not at all heavy. Added a touch of honey to the sauce. Only made two filets of fish and had soem extra sauce so used that in the steaming liquid...the whole kitchen smelled wonderful. Also thought the sauce would be nice stirred into some plain rice and served as a side dish with other things.

This is a Parsi dish. Bombay has one of the largest Parsi populations in the country...these are people who came from Iran and have developed there own unique style of cuisine. It basically has a thick mint cilantro chutney inside the banana pocket...a few variations are seen from one family kitchen to another. Someother Parsi jewels include Dhansak, lagan nu custard..... yummm!!

This was a very light dish, appropriate for a late summer supper. I'd recommend increasing the garlic for more flavor, although I think it still needs something else. After all that effort grating the coconut, I was disappointed that it disappeared in the sauce. I would save the freshly grated coconut for another dish that features it, and use desiccated coconut or coconut milk instead for this sauce.

Easy recipe; is more authentic with catfish rather than salmon; also I would recommend adding a pinch of sugar to the marinade and a little bit of serrano chili pepper to make things hot/sweet/spicy. Also when you steam the fish add a tablespoon of flavored vinegar to the water
