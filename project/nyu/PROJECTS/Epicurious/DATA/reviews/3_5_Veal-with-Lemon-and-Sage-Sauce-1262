Good but not great. The sauce didn't have as much depth of flavor as I would have predicted. I wouldn't make it again without some modifications - maybe brandy instead of white wine?.

This was easy and fabulous. I would certainly make it again. I did like was suggested and made the sauce earlier in the day....be careful and don't reduce too much, want to have enough to pour over all the veal. Served this with carmelized red onions, mushrooms and wilted spinach, and wild rice with toasted pecan pilaf (from this site) and a gazpacho salad, and a frozen lemon dessert....perfect.

Delicious!!! Definitely make the sauce ahead of the veal. Served it with artichoke, romaine and cherry tomato salad from epicurious.com. Substituted mache for romaine and grape tomatoes for cherry tomatoes in the salad. A winning combination!

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a hit (take previous reviewers advise and reduce broth ahead of time). I think it's my favorite recipe from epicurious. Very easy to prepare and just extreamly yummy.

Very nice and easy recipe. I would recommend to add some lemon juice to the veal itself before preparing it. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce to make it thicker and it was really good. The lemon peel gives it a really nice taste.

I made this for company and everyone loved it. My pre-teen loves it so much he learned to cook just so he could make this dish. Very simple to make but great flavor.

Followed the advice of others to reduce the sauce ahead of time...good advice. Used some free-range chicken broth I had in the freezer...it may have had too much salt as I found the sauce salty and hadn't added any salt to taste. Next time I'll stick with something that definitely says "low salt".

I loved this one! I started with veal. Guests dropped in during cooking so we added boneless, skinless breasts cut horizontally and pounded thin. I followed the advice and made the sauce before the scallops. Added a small amount of wine to deglaze the pan (I love the browned bits) and finished the sauce. I served it with a mushroom risotta and salad. I was the chef of the day!

Loved it! I appreciated the advice, to boil down the sauce ahead of time....this indeed saved time! Second time I tried the sauce on turkey cutlets; equally good!

Everyone loved it! The dish is not hard, although the timing is tricky. I like the other reviewers' suggestions to reduce the sauce first, then cook the veal, reheat the sauce, add the butter and serve. I will definitely make it again.

One of our all time favorites! I like to use pork tenderloin instead of the veal. Just cut and pound it gently. I also use twice as much fresh sage. Always rave reviews!!!!

This was easy and delicious. I followed previous advice and simmered the sauce for 40-45 minutes, but I began it by sauteing (sp??) shallots.

Absolutely delicious - a big hit! The sauce took 45 minutes to reduce but I used the advice of another reviewer who suggested to reduce the sauce first and then cook the veal so it was fine.

The sauce tasted wonderful, although the veal cooled down almost completely while waiting for the sauce to reduce. Oh well. Next time, I'll make the sauce first, as the veal took about 5 minutes to cook. All in all, a hit on father's day.

Very good. You can get around the problem of the time it takes to reduce the sauce by reducing the liqids before cooking the veal. Then justdeglaze the pan after cooking the veal with the wine, simmer till the alcohol is gone, add reduced sauce and incorporate butter.

The veal was terrific, but the sauce would never reduce in fifteen minutes, more like forty-five.

Truly sumptuous. The sauce is incredible and one of the best (and not too difficult) dishes. My now husband proposed at the Antico Martini in Venice, so it is especially wonderful!

This is a very special meal. The sauce takes a long time to reduce and i found that the veal didn't keep warm as a result. The blend of flavor is terrific. I garnished the dish with fresh sage sprigs and sliced lemon.

This dish was simply fabulous! The sauce is very delicious and light. It is perfect for a summer gathering. While the sauce is reducing (and it really does take 30 minutes as the other reviewers have stated) you can easily prepare the rest of your meal and voila! An epicurean success.

The sauce is very tangy! It works really well with rice. You will need to allow about 30 minutes for the sauce to reduce, but other than that I loved it!

I thought that the dish was really tasty. The sauce was great but it was a bit on the salty side. It definately took longer then 15 minutes to reduce. I would make it again. By the way, I used veal lions instead of scallops.

Used it on a first date, and the marriage is set for May. He still talks about that dish.
