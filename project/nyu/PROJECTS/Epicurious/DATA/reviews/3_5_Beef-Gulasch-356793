You know I live close to Hungarian borders and from 1620 - 1918 Czechs and Hungarians (and others) lived in the same country - the Austro- Hungarian Empire so goulash is the part of Czech cuisine as well and Hungarian recipes for it are known here very well. Sorry, but I don´t think any Hungarian would cook goulash according to your recipe. The main rule is that the amount of onion must be the same as the amount of beef. I don´t like your method at all. There are tens of recipes for goulash with various ingredients but all of those goulashes are made this way: Onion and garlic is fried. Cubes of beef are added and fried for a while till they get brown. It ´s seasoned.Then paprika is added and next some liquid (water, stock, beer, wine) quickly as paprika could get bitter by frying. Then you add all remaining ingredients and slowly cook it till it´s tender. Finally you add some bread or flour with water to make it thicker (but you can also toss beef in flour before frying). That´s the method. Sorry, never heard or seen something like you described.

The pumpkin seed spaetzle makes this dish superb. Without the spaetzle we found it to be bland, and too much vinager. If you cook the vinegar down as instructed it is fine. I have made it several times and guests are always impressed with it. Is very easy for a make ahead meal.

It is incredible to me the things that are perpetrated in the name of "gulyás". This is a good beef stew, no relation whatsoever to the authentic dish which is a nice, simple flavorful soup.

I was surprised at the amount of vinegar but in the end, it didn't seem too overpowering. I did trim all the fat off of the beef shank. I had no idea what kind of cut this was and it was fatty! Good and hearty flavor, though. I ate it over barley, although I think noodles would be better. Next time I will take reader's suggestion to heat the paprika in oil first. I think mushrooms might be good, too.

I made a few minor changes to the recipe and adapted for the crock pot. I added a tablespoon MORE of the sweet paprika and no hot paprika (family does not do spicy). I also used chuck roast cut into 1-2 inch chunks. I did brown the meat (I ALWAYS do this with the crockpot) and THEN cooked the onions in the pan with some of the chicken broth to pick up the fond. The rest of the ingredients I added to the crock with the meat and cooked onions. After 9 hours on low I did extract the cooking liquid and boiled it down. I thickened it up a bit with flour and added the meat back in. I served it over egg noodles with sour cream topping and my family really liked it. I most likely wouldn't take the time to make this on the stove top. For us this was a good crock recipe but nothing special.

Alright, a bit heavy on the vinegar for my taste. It also feel like it needed more earthiness in the sauce, maybe mushrooms would have been a good addition. We had it over egg noodles and rice the second time. I'd suggest rice over egg noodles.

I thought it was a bit too tart. Also had to cook quite a bit longer to get meat tender.

I am 100% Hungarian and grew up eating gulyash. While everyone may make it differently, there is one change that MUST be made. The paprika needs to be added to the oil and cooked briefly (be careful not to lat it burn), before any liquid. So, after the garlic and BEFORE the tomato paste. It's the oil that brings out the flavor of paprika.

Made it last week and it was superb. Only change to recommend is less oil. I was surprised that the recipe didn't call for browning of the beef, but it worked out very well as written.

I used just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. After initial steps, I cooked this in a crockpot for six hours on high. I used 4.5# short ribs-bone in. Not much meat. Next time I will use pot roast. Removed meat and transferred sauce to saucepan to reduce. I didn't feel the need to use a blender. I served over roasted potates. YUM!

At the beginning I'll say that the taste of this recipe is good, even worth of four stars, but it is kind of beef stew, daub or ragout, even Texas chilly style with so many differences from the original as all this recipes have. Speaking about that, the original goulash has as many recipes as they are villages in Central Europe. There is a basic rule for goulash (gu-y-ash): use as much meat as onions, use Hungarian style paprika, salt and water. This recipe takes long 3 to 4 hours of cooking. Browning meat before, has the advantage of caramelizing and searing the beef, but it could be done in one pot and one step. The taste will be the same, if you concentrate the liquid by evaporation. And look at the picture; speatzle with meat only in Germany; and that is an other possibility for Bon Appetit taste.

It's a bit less work but I still think this one from Gourmet tastes and looks better: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Paprika-Veal-Shanks-351301

My mother is Hungarian, father Slovenian, so goulash runs through our blood and is a constant staple since I can remember my first meals... Issues: 1) It is IMPORTANT to brown the meat first, this one doesn't, I would suggest doing that first in a bit of sunflower oil, remove and continue the recipe from the start 2) More garlic... I would AT LEAST double to 4 cloves and cook on lower heat until well softened... personal preference is to use half a head of garlic 3) Goulash is essentially three flavours added to meat and stewed: Paprika, garlic and RED WINE. Substitute red wine, the heartier the better (Egri Bikavér is best - famous "Bull's Blood" wine from Hungary), for the white wine vinegar which seems very wimpy to me The rest seems appropriate but remember, Paprika, garlic and red wine are the essence and you can't go wrong after that... Even try 'gamier' meat, I've used organic venison and boar with tremendous success, but MOOSE meat is honestly the best, but you can probably only get that up here in Canada :)

I read the 3 reviews above and I agree-this was a great meal! The Flavor was incredible... the only critique is 1/2 cup of oil is way tooo much oil..I pulled 1/4 cup out after cooking the onions for 20 minutes and it still was very oily.

Wow, looks relatively close to how we make it here in the Czech Republic...we eat it with dumplings, but I suppose egg noodles or rice would work. Oh, and to the person who asked for an authentic side...here it's only served with BEER!

This recipe is as good or better than what we had ten days ago in Vienna. Fave reviews from all around. I was unable to find beef shank, so I used the boneless beef short ribs. One word of caution: I burned the onions the first time around. After 25 minutes, they were not "golden brown", so I continued to cook them until they reached that level. Huge mistake. By the time I added the garlic, and tomato paste to the onions, they were burnt. I tossed it out and started over. Stick with the 25 min mark, and add a couple of mins after the tomato paste. Also, I picked up the paprikas at the Christmas markets in Germany. There's no getting around this one. You must use both kinds of paprika.
