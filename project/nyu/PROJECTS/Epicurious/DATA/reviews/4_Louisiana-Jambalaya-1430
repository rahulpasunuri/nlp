Made this for a murder mystery party with a Mardi Gras theme. Everyone loved it including my picky Indian hubby. Makes a LOT so it is a nice thing to make when you have a crowd coming for dinner. Will definitely make it again, esp when I have a lot of mouths to feed.

Good flavor but turned out to be so salty it was barely edible. Next time I will skip the chicken stock and just use water.

I made this pretty close to the written instructions with the exceptions of adding 3 stocks chopped celery and 2.5 rather than 3 cups of rice. The rice broke down so I am wondering if 2 cups would be better. Exceptional flavor. I added smoked sausage from Ville Platte, LA, tasso (made in Seattle!), chicken, and shrimp. The only seasoning I used was 1 Tablespoon of Slap Ya Mamma Cajun seasoning.

everything was going fine til...the rice. complete disaster. after reading some reviews of the rice becoming mushy, i added the rice 30 mins after the vegetables. the thing wouldn't cook. after 2.5 hrs, rice was still not done. my hungry fam waiting for their 2 hr late lunch :/ flavor of sauce was perfect~don't know if i'll try this again...

This recipe turned out great! I substituted half a stick of butter with 2 slices of bacon; 1.5 lbs chicken tenders for ham. I've got a tender tummy, so mine was plenty spicy with only half a seeded jalapeno, plus the cayenne and spicy andouille sausage. I have tried cooking this dish with the rice in it many times and I find that the flavor gets lost in the rice. Instead, I served mine over rice prepared with chicken broth and salt and it was rich and brothy and delicious!

Rating: 4
I followed others advice and cooked the chicken, andouille and rice seperately. Added celery and sub'ed the oregano for thyme. Added rice slowly to mix to get the right consistency and had a lot left over. Took it to a party where everyone loved it, the spiciness is just perfect. Will definitely keep this in the recipe box.

Having read many of the reviews prior to trying this recipe, I too decided to alter the recipe somewhat. I was very happy with the result. I added about a cup of Chenin Blanc along with the broth; reduced the rice and used 2 cups of long grain brown rice; and, cooked the rice by 1st sauteeing the meat, removing the meat from pan, then crisping the rice in the juices left by the meat, then added the veggies and the meat back in and cooked everything together on low for about 1.5 hrs. I also used only about half of the jalapeno seeds as I was afraid that would make it too hot. But, I think you could use all of the seeds and it would still be very good. We added a little more cayenne at the table to spice it back up a little. I also added 2 stalks of chopped celery, which a jambalaya MUST have! I used the red onions and it was good but just to be different I'll use white or yellow next time. I used andouille sausage and chunked pancetta. I couldn't find tasso locally (cajun ham) so thought pancetta could be an interesting alternative. I had the butcher cut it into big slices for me to cut into 1/2 inch cubes. The taste was excellent but considering how pricey the pancetta was, next time I'll subsitute with shrimp or just use the andouille which is already full of flavor. Of course, if you use shrimp, put the shrimp in at the last 10 mins of cooking or the shrimp will overcook and become mushy. This paired well with a light Syrah and the Chenin Blanc. If you opt to make it spicier, I'd stick with the Chenin Blanc.

This was not difficult at all and very tasty. I made it pretty much according to the recipe, but skipped the tomato paste and used white instead of red onions because that's what I had. 11 and 12 year old boys and husband all loved it; my son said "make it again soon!"

This is my new favorite jambalaya recipe. I added a few carrots and celery stalks in addition to the onions and bell pepper and skipped the tomato paste.

This is a very tasty recipe with definite kick to it. As presented, it makes a huge amount of food, which I've found to travel and reheat very well. Also, plan to have some extra stock on hand if you want the end result to be at all soupy.

Rating: 0
Love this, and have been making it for about 3 years now. I add grilled chicken and shrimp instead of ham. I do sometimes have an issue with the rice being too mushy, so next time I will take another reviewer's advice and add it 1/2 hour after the rest starts simmering. I have also found that Creole seasoning and Cajun seasoning mixes are sometimes the same, but sometimes drastically different. If it's really heavy on the herbs it's probably not what you want.

Rating: 4
Based on other reviews added 5 stalks celery, 1tbs extra tomato paste and a lot of extra cayenne to make it spicy. We also used serrano peppers rather than jalepenos. It was all the store had. We also used chicken rather than ham. Next time I may try to roast the chicken first or at least saute it. It was a bit dry. We also decided that we should have sliced the sausage much thinner (1/8 inch) in order to have more bites of sausage.

THis was tasty but turned into mush. Clearly I lost track of the amounts of rice and liquid. I think if I made it again I would add cooked rice to the stew just before serving.

Amazing Super Bowl feast. Started one day in advance. Doubled all veggies, spices, canned tomatoes. Subbed sweet onions, thyme, no tomato paste, added celery. Added andouille and ham midway thru veggie cooking, can of tomatoes at end. Cooked rice separately (2 T. butter, 4 c. rice, then 7 c. chicken stock, 1 c. pork stock). Mixed together, fridge overnight. Day 2 - Made one more single batch of just veggies, spices and canned tomatoes, added chicken and more andouille. Poured over raw shrimp, then poured over Day 1 rice mixture. Added 1 small can chicken stock and reheated slowly on stove. Huge pot of Jambalaya. Guests were in awe (kinda surprised me too). Thank you all for great advice!

ooops... it's probably obvious but forgot to mention that i omitted the ham. here are the final ingredients.. 1/2-1 stick butter, 2 yellow onions, 5 green onions, 1 large green bell pepper, 4-6 garlic cloves, 4-5 stalks celery, 2 bay leaves, 1 jalapeño pepper, 1 tbs Creole Seasoning, 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp dried thyme, 2 tbs tomato paste, 1 lb andouille sausage, 1 lb diced chicken breast, 16-oz can plum tomatoes, 3 cups brown rice, 3 cans chicken broth , 1 lb medium shrimp

Made this for the NO Saints game and brought them luck. Made enough to give everyone who came a take-out container. I needed to add two more cans of chicken broth. I would definitely cut back on the rice by half, which should even out the broth requirements. Makes much to much rice.

Rating: 4
Since so many reviewers suggested changes, I read all 151 & incorporated the most noted changes [& some only mentioned by a few] but also used some tips from another jambalaya recipe Ive made before from this site [Self 2002]. The result was a perfect jambalaya. First, since I could not find Creole seasoning, I made it myself using an emeril recipe [2 1/2 tbs paprika, 2 tbs garlic powder,1 tbs ea: pepper, onion powder, cayenne, oregano & thyme]. Like most, I used most of dc's changes: yellow i/o red onions, subbed thyme for oregano & added 5 stalks celery. I did however use the tomato paste & cut butter to half stick, used brown rice & added chicken & shrimp. I added 1 lb cubed chicken breast & TJs smoked andouillie chicken sausage, both [uncooked] after 1st 10 minutes of cooking veggies & then cooked for another 10. To avoid uncooked or mushy rice that others noted, I increased broth to 3 cans but added the rice 1st to thoroughly coat it in the butter/veggies & then added the tomatoes & broth. Cooked for 1 hour 15 minutes & added 1lb shrimp in the last 10. i also stirred the rice about every 10-15 minutes to make sure it cooked evenly. It was perfect!

Rating: 3
This was super yummy and surprisingly easy to make. A few concerns which many others have echoed: I added celery. It was the right thing to do. On the water: I added more water b/c there didn't seem to be enough water as I was cooking. However, the leftovers now have too much water. Therefore, maybe stick with the recommended amount of water and see what happens? I'd use smoked ham next time. Recipe doesn't tell you to add sausage cooked or raw. Added it raw. it was fine.

Rating: 3
I haven't had much jambalaya in my day, but my boyfriend and i really enjoyed this recipe. Since I have a food processor, I could forego most of the chopping. Made it easy enough even for a weeknight meal. I had to make a few modifications - I only had 1 red onion on-hand, and I had Cajun Seasoning, as opposed to Creole (is there a difference?). Also, the recipe didn't specify if the Italian Sausage should be added cooked or raw, so just in case, I sauteeded the chopped sausage prior to adding it to the rice. Next time, I will probably sub Kielbasa for the ham, and add celery as the purists have suggested.

Rating: 4
Crazy good and even if you alter with Turkey Andouille or Kielbasa, it's still amazing! I have been using this recipe for 5 years now and it's always requested at parties.

Rating: 4
Great Recipe if modified: *1/2 cup butter = RICH (but yummy). Consider modifying accoring to the fat content of your sausage and your diners! *DEFINITELY add celery (2 stalks chopped)! Otherwise you just have Pasadena Jambalaya. Sorry, Ms Callahan. *A chipotle pepper makes a great substitution for the Jalapeno, giving a slightly deeper, smokey flavor. *Modify or omit the cayenne according to preference: all it adds is heat which is well accounted by the jalapeno or chipotle with seeds and the hot sausage. *These proportions make for a slightly rice-heavy Jambalaya. Consider using a full pound of ham or even cutting back to as little as two cups of rice with 1 can of broth. *1 HOUR will turn the rice to MUSH. I pre-rinsed the rice, holding it and the sausage out until everything else reached a good simmer before stirring them in. 30 minutes covered on low is all you need after that.

I made this dish without the ham (just added more smoked sausage). Was very easy to make. It turned out great - will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
I followed the advice of the other reviewers here and added celery and additional chicken broth (I did 6 cups of broth to match the 3 cups of rice), used thyme instead of oregano, and added the rice halfway through the prescribed 1 hour cooking time. I also opted to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I just peeled, seeded and diced them, then added them in at the beginning with the other veggies. The results were delicious. This is now my go-to recipe for jambalaya.

This was a really good meal. We made it up without any meat products and cooked some Portuguese sausages and chicken, respectively, separate and split the cooked batch in half then mixed in the meats. It was great. Added 1 extra jalapeno and eyeballed the spices. Makes a lot.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe using the adjustments listed by Kerala1 (page 1 of the reviews). It turned out awesome! I didn't have andouille so I used Eckrich smoked sausage. The only negative was the rice was mushy. Next time I will add the rice AFTER everything cooks for a half hour (but before the shrimp).

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! A lot of chopping, but that's what food processors are for. I made the following changes: I only used one- third of a stick of butter; I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper; omitted the tomato paste; eliminated the ham and used shrimp instead, adding it during the last ten minutes of cooking. I'm making this again, only this time I'll add roasted chicken (already cooked from a local market) and add it five minutes before serving. This dish always goes over well. Requests for seconds and thirds is not unusual.

Rating: 0
Tip: I've always found that this dish comes out much better and the liquid balance is much easier to control if you cook the rice separately.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! I made a healthier version of this dish, using a pound of pre-cooked turkey sausage, skipped the ham and butter, and used low fat and sodium chicken broth. I also added pre-cooked, chopped chicken breast slices and white onion instead of red. It came out amazing, although I do agree with other reviewers in that more chicken broth is needed to thoroughly cook the rice. A great dish, and my mom (formerly from southern Louisiana) loved it.

Rating: 4
Loved it! I chopped a stalk of celery, (no cajun would omit celery). Also, I found that the liquid quickly depleted before it was done. I boiled the shrimp shells from the dozen I added 15 minutes before done in two cups of water and rehydraded it as needed. That really amped up the flavor!

Rating: 4
Great dish. Had to add a 3rd can of broth to allow the rice to fully cook though. Nice blend of flavors.

This is a very good basic recipe although I made several changes to suit my family's taste. I lived in New Orleans for 11 years, and from what I remember, I thought this recipe needed more New Orleans flavor. I did as the DC cook recommended. I knew it was great when my kids asked separately who got to eat the leftovers (it went to my parents who asked me to save them some),although I did promise to make it again next weekend. These are the changes I made to the original recipe: 4 stalks chopped celery; 7 green onions; 6 large garlic cloves; 2 jalapeno chilis; 1 1/2 tbsp. creole seasoning; 1 tsp. dried thyme; 32oz. carton of chicken broth; 1 lb. of diced and browned chicken breast added with other meats; 1 lb. of med. shrimp added in last 15 min. of cooking. And I did not add tomato paste. It turned out perfectly!

I love this recipe, and it's popular every time I make it. Based on some experimentation and other reviews, I use yellow onions instead of red, thyme instead of oregano, skip the tomato paste and the ham. I add chicken - but to save time I shred a rotisserie from the supermarket. It's delicious!

This was a crowd-pleaser. I used long grain brown rice and 32 oz. of chicken broth and it came out perfectly, although it took 1.5 hours to cook. I also added a red bell pepper and chopped celery, and skipped the ham (because it's not to my taste) and added 3/4# more of andouille. I also added a pound of shrimp the last hour of cooking. It got rave reviews, and it tasted like it came from the French Quarter.

Loved the recipe. I served this at an open house, everybody loved it. I just don't recomend doing this in a crok pot, the rice turns to mush..

Super crowd pleaser. MUST have a good boil going before the rice goes in. :) Perfect dish for a family get-together, add some cornbread on the side. Super filling. Love this recipe.

Rating: 3
I'm downgrading this rating from my original 4 forks because it comes out differently everytime as I find it needs some tweeking. First of all, don't bother using chicken. I put it in one batch for those who can't eat shellfish but next time I'll just leave out the shrimp in their portion. The chicken became very dry. Second, you can do this ahead and I've tried that different ways. The best is to cook with the meat the day before and take off the fat before rewarming and adding the rice and shrimp just before serving. Alas, the quality of the sausage and ham is really important. Still, my guest loved it and it's a practical meal to serve to a crowd along with a big green salad and bread.

Rating: 3
Good comfort food.

Rating: 4
I followed DC's advice as well as the suggestion to use brown long grain rice. I used the standard meats (chicken, sausage and shrimp). My approach: in a seperate pan, cook the sausage then remove. Add a little bit of olive oil and cook the cubed chicken; slightly browning the edges. Remove the meat and add it to the dutch oven/stock pot with the cooked veggies. This cut down on some of the grease. I've made this recipe 5 times. And it is true, if you want it to be authentic, cook the rice with the ingrediants. But, if you want to serve it later, it is best to cook the rice seperately.

For meat, I used andouille sausage and shrimp. I agree with other reviewers that 3 cups of rice is too much. I used 2.5 and still didn't have nearly enough liquid to cook the rice. I had to keep adding broth and tomato sauce, then more spices to keep the flavor. Overall, it was great in the end!

Rating: 3
Excellent! First jambalaya recipe, first use of extremely expensive Le Creuset 5 qt Dutch oven - both are keepers. To the novice: consider all reviews except the negative (lazy cooks). I browned all raw meats for addt'l flavor. Chicken, thyme, celery, shrimp are a must. Halved the rice (generic, grocery store variety, no mush), almost doubled the liquid.

Wonderful dish! I've never had jambalaya before, but trusted this recipe for a Mardi Gras party we had-- and it was a huge hit! This comes out tasting like a spicy paella. VERY spicy! I followed the tips of many reviewers including-- 4 stalks of celery, yellow onion, used long-grain brown rice (and made sure to coat it well in the buttery mixture before adding the liquids), and added a lb of tiger shrimp at the very end, and subsituted 'cajun spice' mixture for 'creole spice' as I couldn't find it at the grocery--other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out wonderfully and I will definitely call on this recipe again next year...

i have loved this recipe since i got it. I've made myown substitutions here and there jsut testing the waters, shrimp is a great add on and the further you break down the jalepeno the stronger the kick! I love this recipe, its definatley a keeper!

I really rarely rate anything a four, and admittedly know almost nothing about jambalaya. I couldn't even tell you the difference between jambalaya and gumbo. But this was really really good. Everyone was happy. I used chicken (2 large breasts), shrimp (20), penn cove mussels (20), and two kinds of sausage (4 large links). No ham. Did the chicken broth in the ricemaker as suggested below, and did almost everything DC told me to. Next time I'll make more. 5 of us almost went through the whole thing. We barely had enough left over for lunch.

Rating: 4
An absolutely Wonderful recipe. I also made it with yellow onion, added celery and used fresh thyme. I used 1 lb andouille sausage, 1 lb boned and diced chicken and 1/2 lb of uncooked shrimp with tails (which I threw in the last 5 minutes) I also decreased the rice to 2 cups and added 1 can of chicken broth. I would suggest that you serve this immediately when rice is finished or cook rice separately to keep it from soaking up all the stock and becoming mushy. A surprising subsitute also became a winner. I generally throw in a handful of parsley for the aesthetic look but only had about 1/3 cup of cilantro. The addition was positively wonderful albeit, not authentic. Then again, isn't this what Cajun cooking is about? Taking what is on hand and adding it to the pot? This is a definate keeper.

Rating: 3
I followed the suggestions of the many other reviews written, yet the dish didn't turn out as I'd expected. While tasty, it was rather dry. I'm not sure if adjustments are needed due to altitude (we're in CO). We expected it to have a bit more of a bite. I would add more seasonings next time and less rice.

This was my first try at Jambalya and it was delicious. I too followed DC's suggestions. I made everything the night before but left out the shrimp. When I took it out of the frig before warming the next day, I was able to scrape of the hardened fat on top otherwise it might have been a bit greasy (from the sausage, I suppose). I added the three cups of rice which soaked up all the liquid so I added a bit of chix broth at the end when I put in the shrimp. Everyone enjoyed it and I look forward to serving it again.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, provided you follow most of the other cooks' advice. I mostly followed the DC cook's advice, plus a couple other random suggestions. I added celery, subbed thyme for oregano, yellow not red onion, no tomato paste, added chicken, shrimp, and okra, and a couple really spicy serrano peppers instead of jalapeno. The chicken I used came from leftover roasted fryer. I also cooked the rice separately, a really yummy "nutty," wild-ish rice basmati mix, strange it seems, but it was great together. I wanted lots of tasty broth to go with all the extra goodies I added to the recipe, so I did 1 and 1/2 times all of the "broth" ingredients, including seasonings, I also had a barely used can of Vietnamese Pho beef broth in the fridge that I threw in. Then I let the whole thing, except the shrimp and rice, simmer for the better part of a day in my stock pot. When it came time to eat dinner I cooked the rice, then right before serving, I threw in a pound of shrimp for maybe a minute and served it. Everybody was very enthusiastic, and a few people gobbled up full second helpings. I am sending off this recipe to some of our guests right after I finish....

Fantastic Recipe!! We all loved this one. The flavor is perfect. I made it with linguine and chicken instead of rice and sausage. (I partially cooked the linguine in a seperate pan and put it into the sauce to simmer for 8 min before serving)

I've previously reviewed this recipe, with all the changes mentioned, but made a discovery worth sharing. Tonight, I used ham base instead of chicken base. What a difference. Also used my own rotisserie chicken for the addition of 3/4 lb. of cubed cooked chicken, and homegrown serrano chiles. My andouille was from Baudin's in LA. Used only 2 cups of rice this time to 2 cups of ham base stock. Also, the trick with the rice to to make sure it is very well coated in the fat before adding liquids. Another five minutes of stirring with the vegetables before adding the meats. This way, it cooks up like a dream. Shrimp is always a traditional addition.

Best recipe I ever made! Not being a pork eater I subsituted beef sausage and cubed chicken, but it was still savory and wonderful. Absolute rave reviews!

This recipe is excellent with DC's changes, of course. The mushy rice problem is probably because not all long grain is created equal. You need to use a drier grain (like from Texas). If you have an Asian long grain it will be MUSH!!! The generic rice in your major grocery store will probably be from TX.

This was tasty. Would make again-- adding the celery. We used left over smoked chicken and andouille sausage and less rice as suggested by the other cooks. Get ready to use the biggest pan you have!

This was delicious! Like almost everyone, I followed DC's advice and used yellow onion instead of red, thyme instead of oregano, added 4 stalks of celery, left out the tomato paste and added chicken and shrimp. Due to problems experienced by previous reviews, I cooked the rice in the chicken broth separatley. I agree that you could easily 1/2 the amount of rice. I marinated the chicken in oil and creole seasoning and browned it separately. I added it at the end. In the last few minutes I added the shrimp. I left out the jalapeno because I felt the cayenne was enough heat. I could not find andouille sausage so I used linguica which is Portugese sausage and it worked just fine. It has a smokey flavor. Next time I will add okra. Total cook time was about 40 minutes.

Rating: 4
I use the thyme as suggested, and I also throw in chicken breast and shrimp to make it a true jambalaya. Always use high-quality Italian sausage - it makes or breaks the dish. I always make my rice in a ricemaker (with the chicken broth) and add it to the rest of the stuff at the end. Delicious, even better the second day!!

Rating: 3
With modifications, this recipe is very good. You have to add celery. I pretty much stuck to the mods posted here, subbing thyme for oregano and no tomato paste. I used a 28 oz can of Progresso whole tomatoes, and cut down a little on the stock. I also cut down on the cayenne, as my kid doesn't like it too spicy. I used andouille, ham, chicken breast and shrimp. I add the uncooked shrimp at the end, when the dish is almost finished baking. I believe it was years ago I made this recipe originally, but even then I added celery for the Holy Trinity. Always use yellow onions.

It was enjoyable and I would give it 2 1/2 forks if I could. However, it was missing something. I followed DC's suggestions, but was underwhelmed. Alas, my search for the quintessential jambalaya continues . . .

Here is a summary of the changes that the DC cook suggested that everyone talks about (2-16-03 review) Being Creole by heritage, I had to correct some fundamental problems with this recipe as some previous reviewers did. First, the Holy Trinity of Creole cooking is incomplete without adding (four stalks) chopped celery (please, no carrots). Replace the oregano with thyme. Replace the red onion with yellow onion. Eliminate the tomato paste. (Author must be Italian). If andouille sausage is not available, use smoked sausage v. italian sausage. Proper Jambalaya also includes chicken and shrimp. With those modifications, this recipe can make authentic creole Jambalaya.

Amazing! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added celery, omitted the oregano and replaced it with thyme, and made my rice in a rice cooker with chicken stock instead. I also substituted tabasco sauce instead of jalapenos so I could control the heat factor. Added a handful of cooked shrimp and presto! - the jambalaya turned out delicious and sooooo tasty! I'd definitely make this again. I highly recommend it.

I added shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, and ham. I would have added crawfish too if I could have found any. I grilled the chicken and the shrimp first in butter and creole seasoning. I doubled the can of plum tomatoes. I used plum tomatoes that were canned with chilis. I also added some tobasco for a little extra kick. The rice took a while to soften though so I cooked the rice more then directed in the recipe.

Rating: 4
Made this for Fat Tuesday and it was the best! I definitely recommend making the changes suggested by the DC cook 2-16-03. So many complaints about the rice so I only used 2 cups. Good thing since I still needed to add 2 more 16oz cans of tomatoes, but it came out perfectly. Watching our salt so used Emeril's Essence recipe minus the salt for the Creole seasoning. I skipped the ham and added chicken seasoned with the salt free Essence. Cooked the chicken and andouilie seperately and added shrimp in the last few minutes. The butter is unnecessary. Try a scant amount of olive oil instead. This recipe makes a ton, but it's even better the next day!

Rating: 4
I made the changes suggested by a cook in DC and it came out fabulous. I thought the flavor and consistancy of this was perfect, and didn't have the mushy rice problem some of the other reviewers mentioned. I made sure to stir the rice from the bottom as suggested by another reviewer. I omited the ham and added cut up boneless chicken breast, which I browned first in some butter and cayene pepper. I also added a pound of shrimp in the last 5 minutes. I had some dried cayenne peppers so I crumbled a couple of those and threw them into the pot too. It came out with a nice bite, but not overpowering. All in all, this one's a keeper....might just have to have a mardi gras party just to have an excuse for another batch!

Hello I've been reading everyone's reviews (thanks!) and am planning on making this recipe very soon.

For the unnamed cook... You can cook the sausage as directed. I always grill the chicken first (I always like it better that way) and then throw it in with the shrimp in the last 5 minutes.

Ive made this a few times with substitutions and its great, Im only writing this after reading other reviews, for those in NJ or PA near Philly, try Reading Terminal in central Philly, there is a butcher there that makes his own sausage, their Andouille Sausage is wonderful (as is all their sausage) the market is also fabulous, loads of stands. Well worth a visit for those who love home grown, home baked, home made everything, you can spend a lot of time there!

Being Creole by heritage, I had to correct some fundamental problems with this recipe as some previous reviewers did. First, the Holy Trinity of Creole cooking is incomplete without adding (four stalks) chopped celery (please, no carrots). Replace the oregano with thyme. Replace the red onion with yellow onion. Eliminate the tomato paste. (Author must be Italian). If andouille sausage is not available, use smoked sausage v. italian sausage. Proper Jambalaya also includes chicken and shrimp. With those modifications, this recipe can make authentic creole Jambalaya.

Great recipe. After reading earlier reviews about the rice issue, I tried something different. I cooked the rice in my rice cooker with the chicken stock. It turned out perfect. I also subbed hot Italian turkey sausage for the meat portion and added 1.5 cups okra and 2 celery sticks. Cooked the sausage separately, cooked the veggies, added together, then added the rice, more chicken stock and simmered for 15 minutes. Done in about 30 minutes. Yum. Making it again for guests.

Like other reviewers, I had a problem with the rice being a bit gritty. Used the entire litre of chicken stock and still could have used more. Next time I might try cooking the rice separately or perhaps putting the whole thing in the oven to cook. Otherwise, it was delicious.

Easy and delicious. I threw in some sliced carrot and celery which were languishing in the crisper. Next time, I may include other veggies like okra or corn or lima beans or .... I halved the recipe with no problems. However, I also added the entire carton of chicken broth, resulting in an almost risotto-like dish using basmati rice.

I have a very hard time getting all the rice to cook. Most of it cooks, but maybe 10% remains hard and uncooked. Presoaking the rice and cutting back to 2.5 cups seems to help- any other suggestions? I wish it would always turn out, b/c it is v. good when it does.

This dish is a lifesaver! I a min college and I can let this dish do its thing while I am at class! My boyfriend (who has a tendancy to be a little picky loves it! I add smoked sausage and shrimp to this dish then I freeze the leftovers.

I added crawfish to this recipe and next time plan on adding chicken as well as crawfish. It was great. Might cut down on the amount of rice. I had to add a little more broth, but that might be because of the added crawfish tails. It was a BIG hit at this house, but is a HUGE recipe. Will work at cutting it in half.

This is a great jambalaya, I've made several times to great reviews. I poach a few bone-in chicken breasts with onion, carrot, celery and cajun spices, then use both the chicken pieces (2+ cups) and the reserved stock (3-4 cups) for the recipe. I also use a large 28 oz can tomatoes, and add more stock as needed.

This was really not worth the effort for the final result to taste identical to Zatarain's Jambalaya that comes in a box.

Awesome. I split this batch up into two portions: fully loaded suasage, and lower fat turkey sausage. Fully loaded was better, of course, but turkey was just fine. It was nice not needing to have my arteries de-clogged after eating...

This was a fabulous recipe! Instead of using the jalapeno, I used a home made jalapeno relish and it added a little something extra. We also threw in chicken drummettes and fresh shrimp (add the shrimp at the very end) for those in the group who don't like ham and sausage. It was a little too spicy for the kids, so we had to make sure there was something else on hand for them. I would make it again in a second.

Wonderful! I used chicken instead of ham and added celery...next time an extra jalapeno for more heat.

This recipe makes a HUGE batch of delicious food! It has become my stand-by when I need to feed a crowd. I have used expensive sausages, sausages with cute names or glamorous packaging, but for my taste, nothing beats Evergood brand Hot Links. Oh, I also add celery to the vegetables and use cubed raw chicken thighs in place of the ham.

If you use great andouille sausage, why ruin it with chicken or ham or even shrimp. Love the tomato base and used arborio rice - it's great and easy to make!

I have made this dish several times..a family favorite! Even my 10 yr. old daughter likes it! It is spicy which is GREAT for me...kids may need an extra glass of milk with theirs! I have altered it just slightly by adding 1 cup celery and I use chicken breasts. I also use about 3 14-1/2 cans of chicken broth and I cut down on the rice to around 2 cups. I love tomatoes so I add 2-16 oz cans. The hot italian sausage has been a perfect zing to this dish. Once I added raw shrimp about 20 minutes before it was done, but I wasn't real crazy about that even though I love shrimp.

Rating: 3
Overall, this recipe was most tasty. I have tried a number of other jambalaya recipes but this one seemed to have the most flavour. I made some substitutions for the meats and spices but followed the liquid proportions exactly. However, my rice came out somewhat mushy and a little burnt on the bottom. I suggest tweaking the rice and liquid contents.

Rating: 3
I am in college, and with a restrictive kitchen, this recipe is wonderful. I'm not a big fan of ham, so I put chicken in, and used Japanese short grain rice. It came out delicious, but next time I would cut down on the spice by just a tad...even though I really like spicy food. I didn't even include the seeds in the jalapeno and it still was pretty hot. All in all a good recipe, no matter how authentic it really is.

Rating: 3
Trust me on this one....I lived in New Orleans for almost 10 years and the correct spice in this dish is thyme, NOT OREGANO! Also, I do not like a tomato based Jambalaya, so I left out the tomato paste and the canned tomatoes. That way, the good carmelized vegetable flavor comes through. I found this dish to be plenty hot enough without the extra cayenne.

Rating: 4
This turned out great, but next time I think I'll try chicken breast instead of ham. Added more heat in my bowl with some good hot sauce and washed it down with a lot of beer.

So the rice gets a little mushy! I added a little water while cooking because it looked like it was getting dry. Made this for a dinner party and everybody loved it. For authentic Jambalaya, I used 1/4lb. of Tasso ham (cajun-spiced - look for it in your local upscale grocery). I served it with a simple salad that had creole-seasoned crouton's (easy to make - 1T of seasoning for 3 cups of breadcrumbs, then toast them in the oven). With a king cake ordered from the internet, it was a very authentic Mardi Gras meal. A good, easy crowd-pleaser.

Rating: 4
Great dish. I halved it and used shrimp & sausage. Browned the sausage first. Also used some long grain rice that had wild rice in it. The wild rice was still chewy after 1 hour and needed to be cooked longer. This recipe is definitely a keeper in my recipe file!

I have made this receipe three times and each time I get rave reviews. My guests just love it. My 14 year old took some to school for a mock mardi gras party and the kids devoured it. I made a few modifications like adding some shrimp and spicing it up with a few more chili peppers and cayenne. It's a great meal.

Rating: 3
Very Good! and Very Easy!. Cut the recipe in half and still worked well. Next time I make it I'll probably use chicken or shrimp instead of ham. Of course sauasge is a must. I'd say heat was medium (I did not add jalapeno seeds) so if you want it hotter, add the seeds or a touch more cayenne.

Rating: 4
My failsafe large group coming over and I want something that does not take a lot of fuss at the end. I put it in a large le cruset (enameled iron) pot with the lid on , low heat. every bite gets devoured no matter how much I make. by the way, It is my personal opinion that minute rice is not fit for human consumption.

Rating: 4
This was awesome. Very easy to throw together, and the results are well worth the effort. I went the minute rice route as one of the other reviwers suggested, and I also added some cajun-seasoned chicken. It packs some heat too. If you want to keep the heat down, you can reduce or omit the seeds from the jalepeno.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very good but the amount of butter was unnecessary. As for the rice to water ratio, it is fine as stated in the recipe. If less rice is used, the consistency will just be a little more moist, as stated below. A tip for making Jambalaya - Jambalaya should never be stirred - turn, rather than stir, after the rice has been added. This prevents the grains of rice from breaking up. Most cooks turn jambalaya only two or three times after the rice is added, being sure to scoop from the bottom of the pot to mix rice evenly with other ingredients. If you want to find another excellent jambalaya recipe, try www.gumbopages.com. The recipe found there rivals this one and there is no added butter.

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less rice, subbed chicken for ham, added shrimp in the last ten minutes, and since I had a little sweet Italian and a little kilbassa (sp?) in my freezer, I used that instead of just the hot Italian sausage. It was really delicious (and spicy!). I did have the mushy rice problem, which I will blame on paranioa after reading all the reviewers! If I had just left it alone, with the lid on, for the hour the recipe called for it would have been perfect. I look forward to making this again and giving it a 4 fork rating.

Rating: 3
This recipe was a hit! I would also cut the amount of rice back if you like it to be a little moister. I used portugeuse hot sausage (i think it's called chorizo). I also used chicken like another person suggested. It was spicy enough for the novice hot food sampler, but could use more if you're used to eating spicy foods.

Rating: 3
I followed the reviewers sugestions and used 2 cups of Uncle Ben's converted rice instead of 3 cups as the recipe specifies. This turned out to be the correct for the amount of liquid used. The taste was authentic but I might reduce the amount of butter next time.

I needed to use up some leftover ham and had all the ingredients for this, so decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! It was easy and tasted fabulous. Based on previous comments, I only used 2 cups of rice and that was perfect.

I am a caterer, and a prospective wedding client ordered this for a tasting. She and her fiance now want me to serve it at their wedding for 200! I added chicken, baked separately with Cajun spices, and juices at the end (so it wouldn't overcook). I also used more Cajun spice than recommended. It is the most authentic and tasty Jambalaya recipe I've tried. For the critic that had problems with the rice, try Uncle Bens (the quick cooking version), and include the amount of water suggested on the box - it makes exactly 3 cups, and you can't mess up the consistency.

I used the andouille sausage, sauted chicken and shrimp. Since there are no 16oz cans of tomatoes, I used two 14.5oz, and about 1/2 cup of white wine and Emeril's Essence. I added a little Tabasco as well. Mine served alot more than 6 but everyone wanted the leftovers!

I had the problem with the rice not cooking all the way, and it went from hard to mush. I kept adding chicken broth and water and could not get the texture right on it. Good combination of flavors however. Did not have a jalapeno so used a hungarian hot pepper with good results. Doubled up on the cayenne, like it firey. Added shrimp and used Eckrich smoked sausage. Browned the sausage ahead of time in a little butter and used the same pan for vegetables to deglaze, cut down on the amount of butter since the pork drippings add great flavor. This was popular and received compliments but I myself thought the rice could've somehow cooked better. I covered it and simmered for over an hour and kept adding liquid so I don't know what went wrong. Made the day before and reheated next day.

This recipe is fantastic. I doubled it and served to a crowd of 20 people. It got rave reviews from all. Seasonings were perfect and the amount of rice worked very well. I used Chicken in place of the ham and I cooked it in a cast iron pot over an open fire -- camping style.. next time, I will try shrimp. and, there will be many next times.

Very flavorful! The seasonings are just right. I modified to suit my own tastes by adding a cup of diced celery (to keep the "trinity" alive and well) replacing the butter with 3 tablespoons olive oil, and omitting the tomato products. I also used turkey sausage. I reserve half the sausage and grill the other half for garnishing the plates. Extra delish!

Delicious way to celebrate Fat Tuesday! I substituted chicken for the ham, as recommended by other cooks. I browned the chicken first in the pot, then browned the sausage to render & drain off some of the fat. The veggies & butter helped to deglaze the pan, which I'm sure added to the flavor. I used one whole jalapeno (but only half the seeds), and beef stock instead of chicken since that's what was on hand. I halved the recipe for the 2 of us, and the proportion of stock to rice was perfect.

The only reason I gave a "3" is because I must have done something wrong. The seasonings were fabulous. Yet, after an hour of simmering, the rice wasn't even close to being done. I had added extra broth (as so many writers had recommended), but it just never worked. I should also point out that I did keep turning the dish in order to get everything cooked evenly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. (My aunt lives in New Orleans and I visit her at least once a year, so I do know what Jambalaya should taste like) even though I live in Utah right now. Thanks, Diane

I love this recipe... I've made it a few times and it comes out great each time..... make your own creole seasoning though, you can get the spices and amounts off epicurious. I omit the ham and add chicken cut into bite size pieces. I also add shrimp at the end and celery along with the green pepper. One of our favorites. I usually serve it with a green chili and cheddar cornbread. For those that have had trouble with the rice... try cooking it separate and then just serving the jambalaya over the rice.

I made this dish for our monthly meeting of the Tucson Chapter of the United States Personal Chefs Association.

I decreased the ham and added a pound of crab claws, 3/4 pound of shrimp, a habanero pepper and about 1/2 a cup of Merlot. A sliced baguette and garnishment of steamed crawfish! A perfect meal! Fed four adults (twice) and still had enough left over for lunch the next day! Yum!

This makes a lot of jambalaya! Being on a low-fat diet due to a recent heart attack, I used non-stick spray with just a little butter and chicken breast and turkey sausage instead.

This jambalaya compared well.

We really liked this Jambalaya. I substituted chicken for the ham, and also added some shrimp at the end. My schedule did not work for me to cook the rice in the dish, so I just served it over the top of rice. We made some to freeze for those "I just don't feel like cooking" days!

This is a basically very good recipe with one very big error. You must reduce the quantity of rice to 2 cups. There is simply not enough liquid to make 3 cups.

In a panic I got online and found this recipe. It was close to what I had made before, however I substituted shrimp for the ham and added an equal part of chicken to the recipe. Since I had to quantify the recipe to serve 300+ servings I was a little concerned about it turning out, but it came out great.

I have been making this, my first jambalaya, for about 3 years now, usually for guests, and everyone loves it. It is really easy to make. I never measure out the spices, just keep throwing in more hot stuff til it's sinus-clearingly hot. I like to serve it with collard greens or a red onion and spinach salad, and lots of cold beer. Once I somehow ran out of butter and decided to substitute oil for the sauteing--big mistake! Some of the guests said they couldn't tell but my husband and I thought it tasted flatter.
