The cake had a good, nutty flavor, but I would have loved it more if I could have made the glaze work--had the same prolem as an earlier reviewer who missed the "string" and overcooked it. See the tester's notes to resolve most problems (not the link above, but http://eat.epicurious.com/eat/cookbooks/index.ssf?/eat/cookbooks/1998/cupcaketest.html

I did not "grind" the pecans, that would be a waste. Coarsly shopped..that's it. When sliced, it is very pretty with all the pecans evenly distributed. If my husband likes it, thats all that matters.

i was excited to make this recipe based on the test's kitchen results. i was disappointed. the main problem is that it was dry -- when i make a quick bread i want it to to be moist. another issue -- i assume ground pecans are that -- ground like course meal -- i did this with most of the pecans and left some at more of a chopped stage for texture. for the glaze i just did lemon and confect sugar. i served at a brunch and there was a lot left.
