Very good. Made "chicken tenders" from boneless chicken breasts -- it just seemed more "dippable" that way. I added 1 tbsp 5 spice powder to the flour mixture, and added some rice wine vinegar and sriracha to the dipping sauce. Make extra! The kids loved having leftovers!

Delicious! Used game hens cut in half and they fried up beautifully. Since there were multiple negative reviews on the dipping sauce, I used one from another Chinese poached chicken recipe on this website and it was awesome!

Not great, but good enough to make again. Replaced 1 tbsp of the powdered ginger with 5 spice. Also, found the dipping sauce too salty & a little boring, so added approx. 3 tbsp each rice wine vinegar and mirin, which was a solid improvement.

delish.. my husband who is not a huge fan of Chinese liked this a lot! He said he'd want this one again. Didn't have any green onion, so I just skipped it, and the dipping sauce was fine... a tad salty though, as the other reviewers said. Made it with the deluxe fried rice also on this website.

i am having a cooking club party this saturday, and i chose this website for all of my recipes. this was my dish to bring, so i practiced making it before the party. here is what i did differently and it tasted better. i used more soy in the marinade with a lot of ginger. i also added sesame oil and a dash of sugar in the marinade. for the dipping sauce i used a fraction of the soy, added a little beer and put the whole lot, plus a lot of fresh giner in the blender. the dipping sause is too salty the other way, but i think this is a good recipe!oh yeah, i also,used a skillet with a little olive oil to fry it. i think i will leave out the ginger next time and use a low burning point oil.

My daughter loves Chinese chicken so I thought I would try this receipe. This receipe was really bad. I marinated the chicken for 8 hours but it still turned out bland. The coating on the chicken did not have any special taste. The dipping sauce was horrible it tasted like pure salt (I used lo sodium soy sauce). I went back to check the receipe thinking I had made a mistake but I made it correctly. We like everything but this was bad.

Yumm! I had to make a few changes to the flour mix. Instead of ginger I used a little Asian 5-spice, dried mustard, curry powder, cumin, basil and seasame seeds. Spousal Unit said the chicken was moist, tasty, subtlety spiced but no so subtle that it required a sauce for flavor. The dipping sauce was a little on the salty side for me so I added rice wine vinegar to cut it--which added a welcome dimension to the sauce. A low sodium soy sauce or tamari would have been better. I also added minced garlic to both the dipping sauce and to the deepfry oil.

Maybe it is because I didn't marinade the chicken breast for long enough, but it turned out extemely bland-not nearly as crispy or flavorful as I had hoped. The only Asian edge I found was in the soy sauce (used low sodium) mixture-and it was overpowering. My guests ended up dipping the chicken in bbq sauce and honey (not quite the meal that I was going for!)

Very crispy chicken delicately flavored with the seasonings. The dipping sauce is good too, but I would use low-salt soy sauce as it's a little overpowering if you're not careful with it. It's delicious on it's own over steamed rice!

Great recipe and quickly devoured by my six guests at our weekly dinners...I used skinless and boneless chicken breats sliced into bite size pieces, marinated overnight- delicious and great for everyone to pick at with their chopsticks. It is a wonderful dish that is easily partnered with the "Cold Poached Chicken with Chinese Garlic Sauce" recipe. the poached chicken, I doubled the portions, which worked very well. Of course, I'll make it again because the demand was so high!

I agree with everyone! This was excellent and simple. I used boneless thighs cut into 3 to 4 bite pieces and cooked about 4 minutes per side. The dipping sauce is very yummy and a great compliment. I used 1/8 tsp. of chili paste since I don't have chili oil and if heat is desired than use at least 1/4 tsp.

Who wants to eat regular fried chicken when you can make this tasty, easy, dish!!! I make a tri-color oriental noodle salad with this and it all disappears! This recipe works well in quantities, you'll need it... it's fabulous!!! I'll make it again and again.

I really love this recipe. I've made it about 10 times. Once, I just used the marinade/ batter with chicken tenders (cook 3-4 minutes per side.) If you love CRISPY fried chicken this recipe is for you.

Very, very good with subtle oriental flavors. A new family favorite. Good dipping sauce.
