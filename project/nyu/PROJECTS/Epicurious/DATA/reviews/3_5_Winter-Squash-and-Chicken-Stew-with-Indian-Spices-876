Excellent for a winter stew. I deboned a leftover whole cooked chicken and turkey breast to use in place of the chicken thighs. I also added ~ 4oz. of mushrooms (that I quartered), that I happened to have in my refrigerator. And, I followed the suggestion to use garam masala in addition to the curry powder, etc..

Great base recipe to expand on! I was looking for something to use a bumper crop of kombucha squash. I had some pork steaks thawed, do cut them into chunks to use instead of the chicken. I liked the ginger idea, so added a bunch with the garlic. I did use garam masala for part of the curry powder (hoping hubby wouldn't complain about curry). I didn't use potatoes, but added green beans. Forgot the cilantro, darn it! would have added a nice, bright flavor.

I make this regularly and like it very much with some additional seasoning. I always add more tomatoes, minced fresh ginger, some lemon zest or juice (just a little) and garam masala.

I've made this twice as a friend strongly recommended the recipe. Can't figure out why though.. rather bland and gloppy. There have to be better chicken and squash stews out there.. maybe I just need to doctor this one up a lot.

Seved this dish to company, one of whom is quite the cook. She (and everyone else) took seconds! Noted that almost all other reviewers added to the recipe. We added two more thighs, substituted 1/4 cup coconut milk for part of the broth, added 1 tsp ginger, and a couple of generous handfuls of raw cashews. The cran-raisins mentioned by another reviewer sound like a good idea in retrospect, even just regular raisins.

I thought this was a nice beginning. I added some personal touches... I followed the recipe until the end. I then took a few ladle fulls of the stew and blended them with 1/2 cup of half n half and then added that puree back into the stew. It made it more luxurious and flavorful. I also added a splash of red wine vinegar to the stew before serving it to brighten it a bit.

10/26/10 Yum! I tweaked this recipe quite a bit. I added a splash of lime juice, some apple cider vinegar, and some fresh ginger at the end. It definitely needed some more depth. But I thought it was grubbin' when it was finished! Oh, I also added a bit of chipotle powder, much to Byron's chagrin. Corban thought it was great, though.

Great recipe, but I made a few changes: - chicken breast cut into cubes - 2 tbsp garam masala instead of curry - 1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon yum!

Rating: 3
Lovely flavor in its original form, but slightly one-dimensional. Added about 1 tablespoon crush red pepper flakes for warmth, and a splash of apple cider vinegar to bring the other flavors to life. Also used a mix of butternut and acorn squash. Baked the squashes and potatoes before dicing, and cooked the whole thing at a slow simmer for about four hours to allow it to melt into a deliciously smooth stew. Absolutely delicious!!!

I thought this stew was plenty sweet enough without substituting sweet potatoes for the russets. I did, however, add some lite coconut milk to round out the sauce and I served it over basmati rice. Yum!

I just peeled an acorn squash, and cubed it. Added a diced carrot as well. I used some shredded chicken from a leftover roast chicken. I added the spices, plus some cayenne and maple syrup for sweetness. I added a jalapeno as well. Cooked it in my slow cooker on high for about 5 hours, and added some half and half at the end, and served with some whole wheat couscous. Very good! Husband loved it, as did I. I was glad to find something different from what we usually make, that incorporated some odds and ends from my kitchen. I will definitely make this again!

I also roasted the squash before cubing it an adding it in, and it broke down while simmering, making it very thick and perfect on a cold day.

wonderful, easy. I added some garam masala, but otherwise kept as is. Also cooked the squash first by roasting so it was easier to peel, which made it fall apart in the stew, adding a lovely thickness to it. Yum.

The recipe as it is written is ok, but worth tinkering with. I added some spice and chick peas, which helped to counter the sweetness from using butternut squash.

this was delicious and guests asked or the recipe, but it does need a little boost as far as herbs...could use a little hot sauce..I added cashews and cranraisins. I would increase the amount of spices...taste as you go along...

This is definitely a "four fork" recipe because its easy make, and its also flexible regarding use of ingredients. I followed the recipe except for a few minor changes, which were made primarily because I needed to use some stuff in my fridge (I used chicken breasts, and also included a yam and red pepper). Based on recommendations, I also added some 1/2 and 1/2 and chopped almonds to my soup bowl. It tasted fantastic. This was so simple, fast and tasty, I will make it again.

We liked this a lot. Always, when I use butternut squash, I bake it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees to soften it up before peeling and dicing. Otherwise it's impossible to work with!

I thought it was decent as written, but a bit mild. When I reheated leftovers, I added some coconut milk as suggested here and think it definitely improved the flavor. I also added just a touch of sambal to spice it up. Would definitely recommend adding a teaspoon or more for those who prefer a spicier broth.

This is perfect comfort food. I replace the russets with sweet potatoes to boost the nutrition, color and flavor. This dish is great to make ahead. I've made it many times.

I hate it when people rate the recipe when they changed it - but I was not really feeling this by the time I was cooking so what the h*ll... Definately add 1/3 - 1/2 can coconut milk. Didn't have plain tomatos so I left them out but would add next time. Don't use both squash and sweet potatos... I used squash and regular potatos - turned out good. Sweet potatos would have been WAY too much (sweetness).

Rating: 2
This dish was good. I used chicken thighs and chicken legs and besides that followed it just how it's written. I think that a vegetarian version would be great, I think next time I'll try that by adding chick peas and carrots. I might also add raisins next time, in which case I would omit the tomatoes, as I'm not sure how tomatoes and raisins would be together.

Rating: 3
This dish was great! Easy to make and very satisfying on a cold rainy fall evening. The only problem I had was that I used an acorn squash - what a PAIN it was to peel! Next time I'd use a butternut squash. I also threw a couple of yams into it and it was very good.

Rating: 4
This will probably draw future criticism from those who hate it when a someone alters a recipe and then reviews it based upon their alterations but oh well! We loved this! I substituted 2-3 t. garam masala and 1 t. curry "seasoning" for the spices. Left out the tomatoes and used 2 c. chicken stock instead, and added in 1/2 can coconut milk towards the end. I also started making this early in the afternoon so that the starches would break down and thicken it up a bit. It worked very well, my end result was definitely stew-like. Also, I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs; browned them, diced them up, and added them back in after the 15-minute simmering step. We had it over jasmati rice and I can't wait to make it again!

Wow.. this was so good! I made it for my book club group's lunch. Made a few additions - added about a cup of cooked lentils to thicken the gravy, and probably doubled the recipe (chicken, stock, tomatoes, used butternut and acorn squash, etc). Also added two yams, as well as potatoes, and added some other spices to kick it up a bit (indian chili powder, cumin, tumeric, garam marsala, coriander, and nutmeg). Delicious with rice or nan (or other breads). This will become another standard in my house!

This is the only recipe with squash in it that my kids thought was delicious. I did add a can of light coconut milk as someone suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was great.

Rating: 3
YUMMY! i'd probably give this 3.5 forks because not only is it delicious, it's also easy and packed with nutrients. i, like many, deviated from the recipe a fair amount - some out of necessity, some out of choice. i used store-bought rotisserie legs and thighs; sweet potatoes (frozen pre-cut - wanted to use the pre-cut squash but couldn't find it), no potatoes, whole cumin instead of ground and no cinnamon (i was out of both - oops); and no chicken broth (my tetrapaks were too old - oops again!). and just for fun, i added a touch of cream and chopped almonds at the end. YUM!!! it was great. i had to stop myself from eating it. my version sounds rich - ok, it is rich - but served with brown rice, it's also packed with nutrients. regarding the diced tomatoes - i thought their acidity contrasted perfectly with the sweetness of the sweet potato (or squash, i can imagine would be similarly sweet) and the warmth of the spices. clearly this is not only a good recipe, but extremely versatile and flexible. and, it can be made SUPER-quick if you use things like the aforementioned store-bought chicken, pre-cut squash, etc; and, the leftovers are going to last me a week (and i know i'll want to eat them). given my grad student budget, this dish is a definite keeper.

I previously reviewed this as "A Cook from Redondo Beach." I made this last night for the first time in quite awhile. I followed the other posters' recommendation of microwaving the squash and using a melon baller. BTW, 6 min. on high was too long for a small acorn squash, it totally cooked! I used chicken tenders for the chicken so it would cook faster. I also used a sweet potato instead of russets. I served it over olive oil and garlic couscous with pita bread. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be making this dish again unless I can figure out a way to make it not so sweet. My husband thought it was too sweet, might be the squash, sweet potatoes, tomato...? I think it's great though. Maybe someone can post a less-sweet modification? Perhaps regular potatoes and no canned tomatoes...?? I'll have to think about this.

The spices were quite unimpressive, too bland. Also, I didn't like the addition of the tomatoes, they competed with the sweet aroma of the fresh squash. Overall, not terrible, but I definitely would not make again.

This is a great staple recipe !! I cant wait to make it with chicken but since I had veggies attending dinner I substituted pan fried tofu and shrimp. I also added zuchinni, raisins, and garbanzo beans and in the end added a bit more spice to make up. It was fantastic ! It got rave reviews and everyone had to ask what was in it. Il definitely add it to my fall/winter recipes.

This is a good everyday dish with ingredients usually found on hand, and a great save when you have a last minute dinner to prepare in a hurry. It is equally good without the tomatoes (a little spicier though)and the sugestion of the coconut milk is a great idea. Nice change of pace.

I added extra spices and omitted the potatoes - thought it would go nicely with some basmati rice instead. I used cut-up chicken breasts instead of thighs, but they got a bit overcooked because I simmered longer than the recipe indicated. Over all delicious, next time I might cook it vegetarian and add some separately cooked chicken at the end.

I made this recipe as less of a stew by omitting the broth, tomatoes and potatoes, and then served it over jasmine rice. It was very delicious!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used garam masala in place of the cumin and cinnamon. I definitely used more olive oil than called for but I wasn't going for a low cal dish, just a satisfying one for a cold wintery night. And it was a success. Even someone that supposedly doesn't like curry, liked it. I'll be making it again this winter when we crave something spicy and flavorful.

Love this - have made it many times for last minute Saturday evening get-togethers to rave reviews. I like to add a handful or two of couscous about 15 minutes before serving (also have served it over cooked couscous) to thicken it a bit. Hot curry is delicious with the sweet squash.

Have made this soup many times. One of my daughters favorite soups. People are so surprised by it! It's very comforting paired with a great salad.

This was so good my husband wants me to make it again less than a week after making it the first time. I used a generous tablespoon of Madras curry and a generous tablespoon of a spicy blend similar to Garam Masala (in place of the cumin and cinammon). I also used a kabocha squash instead and added some fresh caulifower florets too. YUM!! I cooked it a long time, more stewlike that way. Delicious also as leftovers. Serve this on top of some jasmine rice.

This was superb, excellent, delicious!!!! I couldn't stop eating. It was that tasty. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. The only additions I made were--added a pinch of mace, toasted fennel, cumin, and coriander seeds, ground them along with cardamon seeds from cardamon pods. These are not necessary, but I thought it might add some flavor. I also like others added raisins. I think I added too much potatoes and would do less next time. Otherwise I followed the timing on everything as indicated. Served a green salad with it and drank a California Chardonnay as recommended. Scrumptious!

Perfectly savory, aromatic, and satisfying cuisine -- just the thing for a cold winter's night. One note: toast your own cumin seeds and grind them -- the difference in aroma and taste is incredible. (And you should try making your own curry powder mix at least once. ) This recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe vegetarian and it was AMAZING! Obviously, I omitted the chicken. I upped the garlic to 8 cloves, and added the following: 1 can of garbanzo beans, 6 oz. bag of fresh spinach, grated fresh ginger, 1 teaspoon hot curry powder, 1 teaspoon garam masala. All of the spices I used were from Penzey's (I think it makes a BIG difference). This recipe was SO good I am making it again this weekend!!

Tasty, easy and healthy. Also makes great leftovers. Like a previous reviewer I made it with rice instead of potatoes and I will make it again with other veggies. A simple yet highly flavorul dish.

Rating: 3
First of all, it is, IMO, impossible to brown skinless chicken in one teaspoon of oil. I used a tablespoon or more and didn't need to add more oil for cooking the onions/garlic. I used a heavy hand with the spices, and threw in a thickly sliced zucchini after I belatedly noted that we had no canned tomatoes. Didn't miss the tomatoes at all, and the zucchini added a nice color. The stew sat on the stove a little too long as my family was late getting to the table, but when we finally ate, it was dee-lish. I would have liked it served up sooner so that the vegetables wouldn't have broken down so much, but the BF thought it was great. Will definitely make again. Might try without meat sometime, maybe with garbanzo beans. Yum!

I hesitate to review this recipe because I did follow the reviewers suggestions but took it a step further due to a scheduled root canal and ended up loving it even after the drugs wore off! I mixed the cubed butternut squash with 2 cups of cubed sweet potatoes, tossed them with olive oil sprinkled with salt & garam masala (has the cinnamon etc.). I roasted these for 45 min at 375 while I took a shower. I browned the chicken, sauteed the onion & garlic, added 2 tsp. Thai yellow curry paste (has the cumin, cinnamon, etc.), 2 tsp of curry powder, can of tomatoes, can of garbanzos, the chicken , squash & sweet potatoes, simmered for 15 minutes and stirred in 9 oz of spinach leaves. It was not the same recipe but really yummy, full of flavor and comforting not to mention few calories and extrememely nutritional. I served it over rice and my husband not knowing my easy healthfood agenda wolfed down two helpings. I never knew skinless chicken thighs would brown so beautifully, not that you even need them if you want a veggie only entree. Hope this makes sense.

I added an apple and increased the spices by half, but this was stil a little too bland. Too much squash, I think. I might make it with more apples and less squash, and/or add some other vegetables, but I'd rather start with a better recipe before tweaking it in that way.

Delicious AND healthy! I'm on Weight Watchers, and I figured this comes to 7 WW "points" for 4 servings. I used 1 lb of chicken thighs and cut them into smaller pieces before cooking. I also used fat free beef broth in place of chicken broth (it's what I had on hand). I simmered covered for 20 mins rather than 15 and the veggies were perfect. Very flavorful and filling. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This recipe was easy and tasty for a weeknight meal. We didn't have potatoes at hand, so we paired it with steamed rice and it went very well. I think next time, I will also add some garbanzo beans and cauliflower to add more veggies to the one-pot meal. And also some chopped jalapeno pepper (when sauteing the onion) to give it more kick.

My husband suggested adding cashews and golden raisens, which were a nice addition. I thought this tasted better reheated the next day.

I found this while looking for a low-cal dish which would qualify as "comfort food" to cook in a snow storm (with in-house ingredients). It was really wonderful, not "authentic" Indian, but close enough to satisfy an Indian craving. Oh, for those who have problems peeling butternut squash -- I use a vegetable peeler (the one shaped like a Y) which is a breeze!

I made this delicious meal without the tomatoes (because I wanted a cleaner, fresher squash taste) and made it again two weeks later as we were all craving it. Don't expect it to taste like Indian food. Just love it for what it is. Also, to make it really easy, I used a pre-roasted chicken from the grocery store which I deboned and cubed. D'lish!

I love this recipe. I use homemade chicken stock instead of canned, and the flavor is outstanding. I also cut the vegetables a bit smaller than the recipe calls for.

I too used boneless skinless breasts and chopped them into pieces before adding them back in before simmering. I also added about half again as much of the cumin and curry and a tad more cinnamon.

Great recipe. It smells so lovely and it is such a great "comfort food" in the winter. I've made it with sweet potatoes and russet potatoes and I prefer the sweet potatoes, they add another element to the stew. It is a great stew to make on a Monday and eat it all week.

Absolutely delicious! I used hot curry powder so it turned out nice and spicy.

Very yummy!!! A lot of work though - next time I'll use boneless breasts and try precooking the squash. I used acorn squash, red potatoes, the whole can of chicken stock, and no cilantro. Tip: the sauce is good over brown rice. Yum, you get all the spices! I bet some naan would be great too.

Hands down my favorite recipe to make in the fall. I use boneless skinless chicken breast in place of the thighs. I cut the squash and potato into fairly small cubes (around 1/2 inch) so they cook evenly. I found when using the 1-inch cubes like the recipe states one or the other winds up undercooked.
