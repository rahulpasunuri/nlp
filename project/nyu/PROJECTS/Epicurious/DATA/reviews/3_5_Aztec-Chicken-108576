It wasn't anything like I thought it would be. Very nice. Interesting to combine capers, black olives and avocado.

Had some chicken and ripe avocados and wanted to try something other than the usual tex-mex style chicken dish. I am sorry didn't follow my instincts when I found this recipe - there are so many things wrong with it. Too much vinegar, the avocado just doesn't belong, WAY too time consuming considering the end product. What a waste!

Ok the 4 hour diet says eat the same thing over and over but I know that's not gonna work for me. So i tried this recipe..... I made a few tweaks sundried tomatoes instead of fresh, canned blk olives instead of oil cured, no sugar, and red wine for the sherry, and I had red,orange and yellow peppers.....served with roasted asparagus.... #30dayvaycaycountdown

My guests and I loved the flavors of this dish but I'm astounded that none of the previous reviewers mentioned how salty it is. When I make it again I will make serious modifications to the salt required - between the Kosher salt, olives and capers - wow - and I'm a confirmed saltaholic.

This is funny... I can't see one aztec ingredient in the list, even though the dish is called "Aztec Chicken"... Aztecs didn't even have chickens, they cooked duck...

Didn't make this myself but I had it at a friends house and it was fantastic. Super flavorful, great combination of flavors. I really loved it. Took her no time to make it once the prep work was done, too.

This was a little bit time consuming, but with good organization (and doing this repeatedly) I'm sure it'll take less and less time. This received raving reviews when I made it last week. The only modification I made was to completely and thoroughly coat the chicken with salt and cumin, for extra taste. Highly recommended recipe. No leftovers :)

It was the best chicken recipe I ever tried.The only thing when I put fresh herbs in,I chopped them very coarsely.So,it felt a little strange while eating the meal.Also,the other's comments were very helpful.

Dish was very tasty, however, it involved waaaaayyyy too much time to prep things. It defintely is not your everyday dinner. Perhaps better saved for a special occasion? Nonetheless, it was very tasty and my husband and I enjoyed it.

I served skinny noodles with this just tossed in butter.

My soldier son absolutely loved this dish- if not for him- I would have been scared off by preparation! Yet it is not hard- used chicken breasts and added some hot peppers- superb! May make it for Christmas.

This dish requires a lot of prep but the result is well worth it! I left out the capers and used boneless/skinless breasts. Also added a little more sugar. Still worked out fine. All those spices blend together to produce a truly authentic mexican flavor. It's chicken but I recommend a merlot instead of white wine because of the sugar and sherry vinegar. If done right, this dish is exquisit!

Absolutely delicious! The variety of ingredients blended very well. I used red wine vinegar, instead of sherry vinegar and used dried herbs Very easy to make, and well received by our guests.

I didn't think this dish was anything special. It tasted fine, but wasn't really worth the preparation.

My family enjoyed recipe very much. The sauce was very flavorful and the chicken tender. I did however leave out the capers. I served this with white rice but would like to try something different next time I make it. I hate slicing onions so I used the food processor to get thin slices. I prepared the sauce earlier in the day and stored it in a container. Then I cooked the chicken at meal time. The sauce reheated nicely and the end result was very tasty. This is great way to do it if you get home with little time and energy to prepare dinner.

I thought is was ok but the result was not worth the effort.

I didn't find that there was alot of work involved with this dish. My whole family enjoyed it. I left the avocado out of the sauce and just let those who wanted it put it on top of the chicken. I gave it a three fork, but I think the rest of the family would give it a four.

I would not make this dish again. The end result of this recipe is not worth all the prep time. The sauce smells better than it taste.

I just love the flavors in the sauce. Try the snapper veracruz, chipotle meatballs, and chicken and green olive enchiladas if you liked this recipe (all on this site). There's a fantastic dish created by Zarela Martinez called pollo almendrado (almond chicken) in her Oaxacan cookbook - I think it raises the bar on this dish and you may be able to find the recipe online somewhere!

I agree with the first reviewer: it may seem like a lot of work, but once you've done the chopping, the assembly is easy. Try carmelizing the onions as you cook the chicken to save time (I browned the chicken in a skillet and then placed them in the oven - they needed about 20 extra minutes due to size). Otherwise, it's a fantastic way to have chicken: the cumin and salt are great as a rub; the sauce is so full of color and flavor. Very nice way to use avocado & lime! (I might also use a little less vinegar next time...)

Absolutely loved this! Great flavors and a new way to present avocado. I even made it for my neighbor after she was home from the hospital after having a baby and they loved it too. This is a keeper!

My daughter and I made this recipe on one of the last days of summer. It was absolutely delicious. The only change we made was to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. When I make it again I will reduce the vinegar from 3/4 of a cup to 1/2. I will also chop and prepare everything before we start to cook. There were quite a few steps to this recipe and we kept finding ourselves running back to the pantry for another ingredient and then out to the garden for fresh herbs. This recipe was a little time consuming on the first run through, but the results were certainly worth it.
