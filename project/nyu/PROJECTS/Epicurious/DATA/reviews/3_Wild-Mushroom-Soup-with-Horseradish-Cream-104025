So good! Used mushrooms available fresh locally. Added the garlic just before the mushrooms thanks to the last reviewer.

An easy recipe with great results. The only thing that I noticed towards the end of making the recipe that the instuctions missed when to add the garlic, so I added garlic powder instead of the chopped garlic as I was to far into it. This would make a great starter soup or a light supper soup with fresh buns. We really enjoyed it !!!
