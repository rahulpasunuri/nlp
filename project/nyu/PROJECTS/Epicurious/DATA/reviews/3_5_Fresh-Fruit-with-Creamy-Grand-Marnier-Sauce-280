I love this recipe. It is so easy to prepare in advance for a dinner party. I have served it many times with people always finishing every last bite!

really bland - nothing exciting. I even added a little concentrated orange juice to spark it up - disappointing.

I've made the sauce several times for dipping with fruit, and keep coming back to it. It is addictive and guests love it. It is also great that it can be completely made ahead with no problems.

The cream cheese Grand Marnier sauce was not worth the trouble or wasting the Grand Marnier. It would have been better to use just the sour cream sweetened with a little sugar or vanilla or just the Grand Marnier on top of the fruit.

With strawberries in season, this recipe is heavenly.

I used neufchatel cheese and low-fat sour cream and it turned out great (might try half and half next time). Also, increased the Gran Marnier by one tbl. Paired the cream with the Double-dipped Chocolate Strawberries (on this site) which made an impressive buffet presentation for a party (cream placed in bowl, surrounded by strawberries on plate). Also made a couple of neighbors very happy with lovely individual servings (two strawberries nestled in cream in small ramekins). Definitely a "do again" with as easy, tasty, and pretty as it is.

This is a wonderful recipe for a potluck or buffet set up. Allow the guest to determine the fruit/Grand Marnier sauce combinations. Easy, relatively complex and elegant.

This was a good summer dessert. Must say when I first made sauce and tasted it, I wasn't impressed. But once I mixed in the fruit, I was was happier with it. My boyfriend and guests were much more impress with it than I. Used quite a bit of Grand Marnier and still didn't get a big orange taste. Will defintely make again, just based on guests reactions.

This is just wonderful!!!! A new favorite. I made it for Memorial Day picnic yesterday and it was a hit. I made two changes. Because of restricted diets, I used Equal instead of powdered sugar and unsweetened orange juice instead of Grand Marnier. I also served sauce on the side for those who are lactose intolerant. I can't wait for blueberry season. I'll layer the sauce with blueberries in a pie shell.

Yum! I served this recipe at a springtime baby shower and it was a huge hit! (in spite of the outrageous fat content... or perhaps because of it! *wink*) I actually spooned it over a large tray of fruits and berries rather than make individual servings. This is a "must try" dessert!

I made this dessert for a dinner and won rave reviews. Instead of pipping the filling into a dessert glass, I placed it inside a dessert crepe with ice cream and then topped it off with some whipped cream and more of the Marnier creme....

I cannot believe that this recipe hasn't gotten more reviews over the summer! This is one of THE BEST ways to serve summer fresh fruit. It is light and creamy and elegant and SIMPLE! Try it, you won't be sorry....I am bringing it again to a BBQ with friends tonight.

Decent dip, but not my favorite. Too much orange flavor for my taste

I cannot describe just how good this truly is! Everyone loved it. I served this for Sunday breakfast. So easy to make. EVERYONE went back for more. WOW!

Very good and refreshing for a summer dessert. Great sauce- I had a little bit leftover so I am searching for ways to use it up, it was so good. I only used the minimum amount of Grand Marnier and it was perfect, not too "orangey".

This is great and easy. I served it for friends and they loved it on a hot summer night. I used fresh fruit in season, peaches, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi.

My husband hates cream cheese and anything made with it, but I didn't tell him it was in here and he loved this (even when I didn't have sour cream home and just used 8 oz cream cheese, the cream, sugar, and Grand Marnier). That is to say, it's not a "cheesy" dessert--just a cool, refreshing way to eat fruit and still feel a little decadent. Excellent served with lightly sweetened raspberries, but absolutely sublime served with chopped ripe mangoes marinated with lime juice, lime peel, sugar, and more Grand Marnier.

This is an excellant dessert for a dinner party. Everything is done ahead of time and gives you time to enjoy your guests. I used all fresh summer fruits and it was the perfect ending to a summertime dinner. Very light.

Being the off-season, I couldn't find blueberries, but used canned chunk pineapple. This is a great finish to a great meal. Not as heavy as pie or cake. Next time I'll use bananas and more Grand Marnier. Yum!
