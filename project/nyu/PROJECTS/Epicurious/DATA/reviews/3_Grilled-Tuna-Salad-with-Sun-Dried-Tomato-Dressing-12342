My entire family loved this. My sun dried tomatoes were not in oil, which may have made the dressing a little more delicate. I also used greek yogurt in place of sour cream. I think the sauce/corn/tuna flavor combo is perfect. I don't think the cherry tomatoes added much...they didn't hurt but they were forgettable.

This was really good. My 16 yr. old son loved it. I made it exactly like the recipe with no problems. Definitely will make this again.

This is an all-time favorite. I made it in 1991 from the original magazine issue and after moving in 2002 could not find the magazine. I'm delighted to find it on-line. The recipe specified serving the salad with freshly cut corn from the cob (uncooked)--the combination of seared tuna, frisee salad with corn and the dressing is an unbeatable combination and is a great presentation.

Very tasty dressing and a very healthy recipe.

I didn't make the salad--just the dressing. If followed as is, the recipe is a bit too thick and "tomato-y" for a garden salad. I stretched it with another 1/4 cup or so of extra virgin olive oil and a splash more red wine vinegar until the consistency was lighter. I also added a generous pinch of sugar, then tossed just a bit with mixed greens. Topped things with cooked egg, cold steamed green beans, gorgonzola, red pepper. Delicious!

I was just looking for a salad dressing and this was perfect. I had no sour cream so I used sometable cream. I also added some chili flakes for bite and some sugar in the end to mellow out the tanginess. We all loved it.

I've thrown out the concept of 'salad' and now make this dressing as a dipping sauce for sourdough bread. I use pre-made sundried tomato pesto and only 1/2 the oil. Also, instead of fresh Coriander I use dried and it works fine. The salad gets a '2 fork' rating - but the dressing moonlighting as a dipping sauce is a 4! (my buddy even broke his no-carb diet to indulge one evening!)

The dressing is fine - just not for tuna. I tried without the sun-dried tomatoes in oil and it was much better. There are other recipes out there - try them instead.

I'm just rating the dressing itself. I thought the dressing was good but my brother and mother devoured the salad I made with it like it was mana from heaven. They really loved it. I made my salad with butter lettuce, frissee, and baby red leaf and tossed it with the dressing. topped it with honey smoked trout, glazed walnuts, red onion, and cucumber. It was delicious.

We eat lots of salads with fish or chicken on them and this sounded interesting. I had no problem with how the dressing looked but it was just to overpowering for both the greens and the tuna. The salad would have been better with just a simple vinagrette. This "dressing" is actually surprisingly light for what it is and might be good on fish or chicken alone.

This is a great salad. We make it often. I do not understand what about the color of the dressing the other reviewer did not like. Use ripe tomatoes and don't over cook the tuna. I use frozen corn which makes prep go faster.

I'm not sure what happened with this. Maybe the tuna was overcooked or not fresh enough. Whatever forces were at work- this was not very tasty. The salad itself was nice but the addition of the tuna, which should have made it better, only detracted from the dish. The dressing should have been good, but it was difficult to get beyond the color and texture. Maybe I will give it another shot next summer.
