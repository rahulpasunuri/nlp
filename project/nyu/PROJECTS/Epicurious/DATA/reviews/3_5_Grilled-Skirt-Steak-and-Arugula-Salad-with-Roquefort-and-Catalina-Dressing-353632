I love this recipe. I have made it multiple times. I have brought it to potluck dinners. One diner told me she had to force herself to stop eating it because it was so delicious it was binge-worthy. I think the key is a great balsamic vinegar. I made it multiple times with a Global Gardens blood orange balsamic and thought it was amazing. When I ran out and used a common supermarket brand of balsamic I was less infatuated.

Absurd that the photo would show skirt steak cut along the grain, and not against it. Makes me think the the Gourmet editors don't really edit their recipes.

excellent flavor combination, if you don't use too much dressing. perfect as a summer lunch/dinner.

I too was dubious of the dressing but found it quite pleasing-as did my family, including picky grandkids...I think the trick is to use the dressing sparingly.

If the idea of ketchup, sugar, and 2 tablespoons of balsamic makes you a bit ill, then for God's sake make another dressing. I went against my gut, and ended up with one of the worst dressings I've ever encountered - disgusting is the only word for it. I can't imagine Rith Reichl ever came upon this. The big however, is that steak, arugula and blue cheese go very well together. So stick with that main idea and use your own dressing.

Steak and arugula - a match made in heaven, and such an easy summer dinner! However, in our view, this dressing completely overpowered those lovely tastes trumping even the muscular roquefort. I'll return to my tried and true summer steak salad. For those who love the arugula-steak-cheese combo, try this: Follow this recipe re: steak & greens but substitute the following dressing, and top with freshly grated Parmesan: 2 T balsamic vinegar; 2 sm cloves garlic, finely minced; 1/2 t. minced fresh thyme; Sea salt & freshly ground pepper; 5 T. extra-virgin olive oil (recipe from SF Chronicle, May 2008). Bon appetit!

So easy to make. We used a Point Reyes blue and added cherry tomatoes and sliced red onions then served it over grilled flatbread.

The dressing is fantastic. Combined with the roquefort, the effect is excellent. I agreed with other reviewers that it needed more vegetables, so added slivered Vidalia onions and diced heirloom tomatoes. Also tossed in some whole grain garlic croutons. Definite new summer favourite to use leftover steak.

We really loved this. Made as written, except used NY strip. Great salad, lots of flavor.

Made exactly as written this recipe is extremely bland. It is not add up to more than its parts. It needs more vegetables. The steak needs to be marinated or seasoned before cooking. Very disappointing meal.

Very quick and easy! The dressing is the hit of the salad. This is one of those recipes where you can add whatever you like.....I added sliced avacado and quartered hard-boiled eggs....

Excellent. Tasty, easy, and quick with components that can be made in advance which means this will probably end up in heavy rotation.

Made this for dinner tonight. Was deliciously light but filling. The dressing was quite tangy, but complimented the saltiness of the meat nicely. We used a blend of baby arugula and baby spinach for the salad part. I also only used 2 ounces blue cheese total to cut down on calories. One serving, of about 2 cups of greens, 1/4 of the dressing, 4 ounces of meat and 1/2 an ounce of blue cheese was about 420 calories. Very easy to make and easy on the diet. Will make again!

Really good, and SOOoo easy! I must say I was suspicious of the "Catalina dressing", because that brings to mind Kraft bottled unnaturally orange dressing, but this was really good. Don't skimp on the Roquefort, that makes the recipe. Also any mixed greens will do, don't feel overwedded to arugula. Will definitely be making this again!

I have to give this a 4 which I almost never do--fast and fabulous. I nearly skipped it because of the "Catalina Dressing"--no resemblance to the bottled Kraft version whatsoever. This is an amazing, healthy dish.
