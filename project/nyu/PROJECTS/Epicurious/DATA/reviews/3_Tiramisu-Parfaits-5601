This is a great dessert! It's a fix ahead and tasty thing. The only change I would make is to use lady fingers instead of biscotti. To the cook who said this does not taste like tiramisu. It may not taste like YOUR recipe for tiramisu. I would like to point out that there is NO one recipe for tiramisu, in Italy or in the states. Every cook, restaurant and house wife has their own version of tiramisu. Different people flavor it with different things, some use brandy, rum, kirsch, etc. In this case the flavoring is orange/brandy. The only fairly consistant flavor is coffee (and usually chocolate in some form). Heck, even the method for assembly varies depending on the cook. It's kinda like that old stand-by, church pot luck banana pudding w/ vanilla waffers. Everybody makes it, but they all do it a little differently.
