Wow! I read the reviews and had to try this--it did not disappoint. Served this for Easter dinner dessert. It was cool, light, creamy and a lemon delight. Perfect for this warm spring day. Needless to say it was a hit and I will definitely make this again and again.

This is my number 1 summer dessert. Everyone loves it. As recommended by another reviewer, I do mix extra gingersnap crumbs to sprinkle over the top before serving and I have found Anna's Ginger Thins (available at Walgreen's) the best I've tried as they are very thin and crispy.

I have NEVER made a dessert like this or icecream, etc...and it was awesome. Made it for a friend's birthday and topped it with fresh slightly macerated raspberries. It was a special "light tasting" dessert that was a big crowd pleaser. The best compliment I received was "you MADE that?!" Yes. And I will definitely make again!

This is one of my favourite recipes. I was worried the lemon ice cream would be too sweet, but the gingersnap balances that out nicely. I tried this topped with a homemade raspberry sauce and some frozen raspberries, which tasted great and looked amazing.

This. Was. Amazing. Boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how good it was!! I used the ice bag method someone else recommended and it came out perfectly! I licked the bowl it cooled in, the bag I froze it in, AND the plastic wrap I covered it with... If you've ever been to fleming's steakhouse, it tastes just like their pie. That's actually how I came across this recipe (trying to duplicate that pie) and it's a perfect match!

Everyone raved about this dessert! One friend said it was the best dessert she ever had in her life! A big thank you to the reviewer who linked me to the sci-toys site, a great way to make ice cream without an icecream maker. My only difficulty was getting the pie out of the pie plate. Anyone have any suggestions? Sue

The gingersnap crust was a huge hit, and the lemon was just lemony enough. I would suggest making some extra crust and scattering that over the top of the pie, as there was so much fighting over extra crust! Also, not necessary to have an ice cream maker-- go to the following website (it's a science website) for an easy way to make ice cream with just ziploc bags, ice, and salt! http://sci-toys.com/scitoys/scitoys/thermo/ice_cream/ice_cream.html

This is good. Served it after a lobsterfest and my guests enjoyed it. I didn't have trouble cutting it. I put fresh blueberries on top. My husband particularly liked the ice cream so I will make again.

My twelve year old daughter and I made this together. We doubled the recipe to fit our ice cream maker and ended up with two pies - one for a party and one for us. Everyone thought it was delicious, but the crust was very difficult to cut. I think it needed to bake for longer, maybe twelve minutes or so, which I'll try next time. We thought the ice cream mixture would also make a wonderful lemon pudding, if thickened properly. We'll try that at a later time.
