I made this with dinner tonight and had to immediately comment. Absolutely delicious. I will definitely make again, probably as hors d'oeuvres, and I don't even feel guilty about eating it if I make it with all (or most) fresh ingredients.

Great recipe. I made a few changes - I made my own pizza dough and used canned plum tomatoes, well drained and buzzed in the blender but not cooked - for toppings I used the artichokes but substituted sliced canned olives for the Kalamata (too salty) and pesto. For cheese I used mozzarella and parmesan. Make the crust very thin and cook at a high heat. My friends loved it! Like I said, a great recipe. Oh wait a minute - that's my recipe, not yours!

This was a great hit with the hubby! However, I made a few changes. I did not use the spread, but rather the layer of crumbled feta on the pita and the I add the following as toppings: gyro meat (pan fried w/ no oil, since the meat had a lot), onions, fresh tomatoes (not canned), strips of sun dried tomatoes, salt/pepper to taste, and sprinkled with crushed red pepper on top!

Tasty and very easy. A bit on the salty side- but it helps to rinse off all of the toppings in order to dissolve excess salt. I also would not suggest pouring the remaining artichoke marinade over the pizza after adding toppings, though you need to use it to pre-bake the crust. I used normal flatbread that I purchased at my supermarket. This bread was kind of like a cross between a tortilla and a pita and it came out very crispy. A great summer dish.

I used some square flatbread with herbs bought from the local grocery store instead of the pita bread which added another layer of flavor. Very easy to make and my guests loved it

Too salty! Maybe substitute fresh tomatoes for the canned ones, but other than that, I don't know what to do about the excess salt. Feta, olives, marinated artichokes are all salty.

Very tasty, but not as filling as I expected. I also tried not splitting the pita bread, but it doesn't come out as crisp. Next time I will try toasting the split pitas, then stacking two halves for a more filling meal. Very satisfying for a quick weeknight dinner.

In order to make this again, I think I would change it somehow. The texture of the canned tomatoes was less than desireably. I might try sun-dried tomotoes - or fresh in season and cook it a litte longer once assembled to blend flavors.

Very fast and easy. Light summer meal.

This is a very tasty, full of flavor, quick weekday meal. I used pita instead of the armenian bread and it was nice and crispy. Not a gourmet dish, but it only took 10 minutes!!!
