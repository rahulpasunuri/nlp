I would only make this recipe again if I substantially upped the amount of ginger. The earlier reviews were right about it being bland. To shake things up, I put in sauteed onions, more sugar, and cinnamon, while serving it with swirls of cream.

So, I tried it just as is and found it as others of you did- a little bland. So, I added some red chile sauce and peanut butter as well as some parsnips and a bit more garlic. It became a truly remarkeable soup and a personal favorite in the fall. My mother is always asking me to make it for her parties. Serve with a touch of yogurt on top and some chives or fresh oregano.

I agree with the other reviews. Very bland, not a very interesting soup. I will try it again however with a heavy cream to see if it gives it a little pep.

I had something called Carrot Orange soup while in Germany last week and it was DIVINE--and this was nothing like it. I tried to take it on its own merits, however, and simply found the orange juice flavor too strong and the overall taste just not so good. and i _love_ ginger, too! if anyone has any other yummy carrot soup recipes, though, i'm more than willing to try them.

Clearly a strong ginger taste. If you like fresh ginger, you will like this recipe. If not, don't try it. I added significantly more lemon juice and pepper at the end to give it an extra kick. Very quick and easy to make.

This recipe was VERY bland. Very little flavor & seemed to be missing herbs.

This made a quick and easy meal when paired with a crusty loaf of bread and a salad. This is a keeper.

This was very good and light enough to serve as a great Thanksgiving first course without filling everyone up. I had many requests for the receipe. I made it with vegtable stock (instead of chicken.

My husband described this soup as something you would have in a fine restaurant - he was so surprised I could make it! It was easy and delicious and bonus, low calorie.

The soup was quick and easy but I found the ginger overpowering

I've made this for dinner guests before, and they thought I slaved over the stove with this soup, which takes no time at all, especially if you grate the carrots with a Cuisinart.
