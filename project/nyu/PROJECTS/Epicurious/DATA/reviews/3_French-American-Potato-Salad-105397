Simple and delicious - i use shallots and chives instead of regular onions and skip the radish - lots of fresh tarragon is a very good thing.

Surprisingly delicous! Easy too.... I omitted the eggs however.

a nice healthy version of the potato salad. i added dried dill, tarragon and salt to the vinagrette, then added the potatoes, skin-on, while hot to soak up flavor. colorful, but tends to discolor a little.
