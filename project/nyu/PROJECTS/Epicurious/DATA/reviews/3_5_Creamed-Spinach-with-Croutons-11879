Great spinach recipe! Did use double quantity of nutmeg and lemon to give a stronger, Mediterranean taste. Also used less sour cream(didn't have much and forgot to buy). Next time i will try it more creamy.

Stopped even looking at with the beginning using regular white bread to make croutons.......glad to see from other reviewers I did not waste my time cleaning all that spinach. I love this site for the feedback from REAL cooks!

I use tzatziki sauce in place of the sour cream to give more of a Mediterranean flavor. My kids love it! You can also mix it in with risotto for a different take.

Gloppy, bland and gross. Useful as glue.

Ditto 7/13 NYC review - go directly to Emeril's creamed spinach recipe on foodnetwork.com. Served with fried soft shell crab. Fantastic.

I use this recipe base and add extra sour cream and 2 cheeses: asiago and parmesan. The recipe can't be beat now! My family begs for it every holiday

Honestly, you cannot get much better than Emeril's spinach recipe at foodtv.com- the one included in "Delmonico's Dry-Aged Sirloin Steaks with Homemade Worcestershire Sauce, Scalloped Potatoes and Creamed Spinach"- I LOVE this site, but no creamed spinach here can compare to his.

Utterly disappointing. I don't know why I bothered making this from scratch - totally unnecessary and a big waste of time - use frozen spinach - in fact, use a different recipe alltogether. It was bland and just not good. Hard to mess this dish up too... I was surprised.

Definitely not the best creamed spinach I've ever had. Good, but not great. Definitely not creamy enough, and I took the suggestions and added a little cream cheese. Helped alot.

I divided this recipe by 2 to make two servings. For my 1/2 recipe I used a 9 oz. bag of pre-washed fresh spinach. Made the roux in a small heavy pot. Added 3 large coarsely chunked fresh regular mushrooms to the onion in the roux pot. Added a bit more flour, sour cream, and nutmeg to the roux pot than was required for my 1/2 recipe. Also added some cayenne pepper and a splash of dry white wine to the roux. Did not put anything into a food processor, only wilted the spinach with a bit of butter in a large pot while the roux heated. When I mixed the roux mixture with the spinach, it was quite bland, so I added 1 slice of Kraft American Cheese Singles, a VERY generous sprinkle of canned Parmesan cheese, and extra black pepper. NOW it was a serious YUM YUM. P.S. Used Garlic Parmesan French bread (from W/M) for the croutons. I cut the bread into 3/4" cubes, and they were TO DIE FOR!!! NOW this recipe rates 3-1/2 stars.

So easy to make, and tasty. But next time I will definitely add some cheese.

The best creamed spinich ever! I approx. 1 tablespoon goat cheese, 2 tablespoons brie, and 2 tablesoons gruyere. You need to use whole milk! Would certainly make again.

This was a wonderful recipe! I showed my daughter how to make a sauce while I was doing it. My little daughter even ate her spinach! You simply cannot beat that.

Creamy, delicious, the best creamed spinach, Peter Lugers doesn't hold a candle to this recipe !! My family loved this, and I would definitely recommend this as a main course or side dish. I substituted sour cream and milk for half-and half, ricotta, brie, and parmesan cheese, which lended richness to the recipe, with 2 cloves of garlic added with the onion, and increased the nutmeg (freshly grated) by 1/2 tsp.

This was the best creamed spinach I have had. I did change a couple of things however. I substituted goat cheese for the sour cream. I also added some sauteed mushrooms and white wine. I added a pinch of cayenne, too. It was wonderful. I will be making this frequently!

To get a creamy texture, make certain to use whole milk. I used 2% the first time and it didn't turn out like the restaurants make it.

my kids loved this dish, will definatley make it again.I did add one clove of garlic to this before adding flour .

ok, but add lots of garlic and parmigano-reggiano and more nutmeg. I didn't use a food processor but chopped spinach rather fine. Also, discovered I didn't have enough fresh spinach so added in chopped frozen spinach, thawed, and it was tasty.

Great basic creamed spinach recipe. I didn't take the time for the croutons (weeknight) but it still turned out well. I added parmesan and left out lemon juice. Nice and easy side dish.

Fast, easy, great taste. I have tried this sort of dish in a few Gourmet restaurants and they truly do not have any edge on this recipe!

This has become a staple recipe for me. I don't always make the croutons, but they are a wonderful counterpoint to the spinach. Also, I don't use sour cream or lemon; I add a little gruyere instead. And because I don't have a food processor (really!), I simply chop the spinach nice and fine. Great recipe. Actually, judging from my experience and the reviews, one of the best things about this recipe is that it is very adaptable to individual tastes. Just make those first basic steps with the shallot and the roux, then you can add your own touches.

Fantastic with a little doctoring...I chopped up the spinach with a kitchen scissors after cooking and draining vs pureeing in a food processor. (I think the result would be much too mushy in a FP.) Used shallots vs onions (first time around I went with onions and found them a bit overwhelming); use half & half vs milk; double the lemon juice; double the nutmeg - fresh ground if possible; at least 3 tblsp of parmesan cheese; at least 1/2 tspn of salt. Easy subsitutions/additions but WELL worth the difference!

I went the half & half route like one of the cooks below, didn't cook the spinach down entirely, and didn't puree until the ingredients were all together: then I used a stick blender and pulsed it a few times. The result was delicious: even toddlers liked it.

For 2-1/2# bag of spinach I used, 1 medium onion finely diced, 3 T. of butter, 3T. of flour, 1-3/4 c. of half and half, 3T. of sour cream, 3T. grated parmesan, nutmeg, salt, and pepper TT. I also coarsely chopped the spinach rather then process into a "mush". Was sufficient enough sauce to bind the spinach but not to where it was floating in the sauce. Served with a lemon/thyme/garlic roasted chicken.

This rivals all those creamed spinach side-dishes in the expensive steak houses we have been to--easy to make, too, and the freshness of the spinach comes through. Great!

I'm a big fan of creamed spinach and was very pleased with this recipe. Shallots were perfect, rather than onion. I added a bit less nutmeg, and salted enough so it was not bland. Also served with baked fish with mango salsa; the salsa flavor really "pops," so the taste change of the spinach was welcome. I'll definitely make this on a regular basis.

I like this better with shallots than onions, the shallots give it a nice milder flavor.

I thought this was really bland. I substituted ground nutmeg, maybe that's why.

Ok, I don't think that any side dish can be "A dish beyond compare," but I don't even LIKE spinach and when I make this, I fight my spinach loving husband for the lion's share. I always follow the recipe to the letter (less the croutons) and have never been disappointed. A standard for our home.

Even the people in my house that don't like green things liked this one. However, it does need some Parm cheese and a bit more sour cream - its just a touch too bland.

This was quite simple and delicious. Remember that a lot of fresh spinach goes a very little way. We had it with corn pudding for Christmas dinner and everyone loved the combination.
