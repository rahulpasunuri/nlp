Lovely salad - with changes. I added raw spinach to the watercress. I thought that honey would too overpowering, so I substituted mirin instead. I also replaced the red wine vinegar with red wine and added about 1/2 tsp. lemon.

Delicious! I made this for my mom's birthday & it was so good!!! We added bleu cheese & oranges & it gave a sweet taste to it. This is a recipe that I will make over & over again!

Excellent. Everyone loves this one. Although the first time I made it I realised that I had run out of red wine vinegar, so I substituted Cider vinegar, but used less. Worked perfectly and complemented the watercress flavour better. I now always make it with the cider vinegar instead.

Excellent. Everyone loves this dish. The first time I made it I realised that (shock, horror) I'd actually run out of red wine vinegar. So I substituted cider vinegar, using less that indicated in the recipe. Worked perfectly and complemented the watercress flavour better. I now always use cider vinegar.

Simple and delicious. The warm vinaigrette wilts the watercress just enough and this salad was a nice compliment to a simple turkey breast dinner.

The dressing is delicious, but not the best complement for the flavor of the watercress. The second time I made the dressing, I served it over mesclun and it was wonderful.
