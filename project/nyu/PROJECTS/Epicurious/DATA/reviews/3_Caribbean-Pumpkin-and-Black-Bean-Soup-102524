This is the first recipe from Epi that I have made and HATED. It was so bland and was basically just liquid with an occasional bean. This needed a LOT of work. I just threw it out!

Good with a lot of modifications. Doubled the cumin; added 2 tsp curry powder; a pinch of cayenne pepper; dash of nutmeg; 6-8 cloves of garlic; 1/2 C diced red onion; one diced shallot; 1 tsp fresh ginger, diced. Sauteed the garlic, shallots, and onion in the pot before starting, then added all other ingredients. With all of these modifications it had some kick, otherwise would be very bland. With modifications would give it 3 forks.

Needs some spicing up. I doubled the beans, doubled the lime juice, and added hot sauce. Yummy.

This is even better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to blend a little more.

Delicious! I especially liked the tangy lime flavor. I started out by sauteing some wild onions and their greens that I had picked earlier that day and continuing with the instructions as written after that. The only other change was omitting the cilantro--I can't stand the flavor. I definitely will be making this again.

I think of soups as an all-day simmer, but this one is quick and easy. That doesn't mean it is short on flavor! It's delicious!

This soup was fantastic for dinner with a simple salad and whole wheat quick bread. This time I sauteed one small sweet onion with two cloves garlic in olive oil on med heat until translucent, added the stock and pumpkin and allowed it to come to a low boil. After that I reduced the temp to strong simmer and added the coconut milk, cumin, and lime zest. I added the lime juice and cilantro 5 minutes before serving. The slow simmer kept more of the flavor. For a double quantity, I doubled everything beside the coconut milk.

Of course, I should have read the reviews before starting. This had some neat flavors but was seriously lacking in depth. I added curry powder, ginger, and corn kernels, but it could really have used some onion and garlic as well.

This became a four fork recipe with some work. Like others, I started with sauteed garlic and, in my case, shallots which is what I had on hand. My cumin had lost its mojo, and we like heat anyway, so I used hot curry paste and also added cayenne. Then I substituted white wine for the water. But after adding other ingredients, it tasted bitter to me, so I stirred in about 1/4 cup of sour cream and BAM! it went from questionable to fabulous. My boyfriend kept saying, "I want this twice a week!"

I think halve the coconut milk, and up the spices. Very easy recipe to tailor to your taste buds. Very filling. I loved it.

The soup turned out good; however, the flavors were not exciting in any way. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned so that may have contributed to the lower flavor. Canned pumpkin probably would have been sweeter. I also used beans that I cooked myself so they didn't have any extra sodium in them. I did use 1.5 teaspoon of cumin due to the reviews. I usually enjoy fresh lime added to a soup but it was lost in this one. It was good but needed something.

I made the recipe exactly as shown, then added some allspice for a bit more flavor. Delicious!

I liked this, but unfortunately my husband didn't. "Weird, it tastes odd," he said. "Soup from the uncanny valley." I did do it the harder-to-make way because I had dried black beans in the house and you can't buy canned pumpkin or chicken broth in this ____ country, so only the coconut milk came out of a can. Iit was still yummy and not too much work. I might make it again, but it's not going to become a regular.

I would up the spice as well. Add two cans of beans and extra lime juice. The raw onion, avacado and oranges on the side are a must have! Super easy.

Like others below, I started with sauteed onion and garlic, upped the cumin and added a bit of cayenne to spice it up. I also had some spinach that I needed to use up, so I added that in the last minute or so--just long enough to wilt, but still bright green. It was great and next time I would plan it with the spinach.

We subatituted parsley for the cilantro. Delicious, fast and easy.

This soup is tasty, but it definitely needs some spicing up. First, I added a heaping TBSP of dried chipotle powder, but it still didn't have much zip. So I squeezed in some Siracha sauce and that took it from good to delicious. The lime and coconut can stand up to a lot of heat. Next time, I'll add another can of beans. But it really couldn't be simpler to make on a weeknight, especially since it's easy to keep all the ingredients in the pantry.

a great recipe to start with then personalize. Other pumpkin black bean recipes call for more beans than pumpkin so the finished color looks more inviting but I prefer the taste of this equal-parts version. My changes: I have made this with chicken stock and added leftover roasted chicken or turkey. I have made it with coconut milk or not, have substituted curry powder instead of cumin-yummy with a dollop of Fage yoghurt on top and chopped cilantro or green onion tops! I have replaced the coconut milk with 1/4 c sherry and pureed the beans and added 1 canned chipotle pepper with 1 tbsp adobo sauce then finished with either sourcream or mild cheddar cheese and diced white onions. This recipe has Vitamin A, fiber, iron, warm and filling and CHEAP to make. I highly recommend you try it and make it your own. And yeah, I know changing the ingredients doesnt quite make it Caribbean any more but the world is our supermarket now and anyways Caribbean food has many influences.

Very quick easy tasty soup. The lime juice makes the dish; I was generous with it and it was very tasty. I had a medium red onion so I diced it and sauteed it to start the soup which added nice flavor. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was very tasty with the creaminess of the coconut and the bite of the lime contrasting with the hearty pumpkin. The only changes I made were the addition of 1/2 cup finely chopped onion, and 1/2 teaspoon tobasco, and when I doubled the recipe I did not double the coconut.

This recipe is one of my favourites. It has all of my favourite flavours. cilantro and fresh lime juice are a must--they really set this one apart. Sometimes I add more beans.

This is such a great combination of flavors! I have made the recipe as written, and it is good, but this time I substituted butternut squash for the pumpkin. Since I had to roast the squash, I also roasted some garlic, which I then sauteed with olive oil and onion. I also upped the cumin. So, so good!

Thanks everyone for your reviews! In addition to some of the ingridients mentioned by other reviewers, added the following: diced yams instead of pumpkin,crushed garlic, Trader Joe's frozen red/yellow/green peppers.Added some texture and taste to my soup with crushed corn chips and a mild salsa on top when served.....got the kick it needed!

I really like this soup. The only thing I would omit is the grated lime rind and just add a little more lime juice. I will probably add some red pepper flakes, as well, to give it a little zip.

This is the first and only pumpkin soup I have ever enjoyed. I made this recipe so many times last year I got sick of it. I'm looking forward to making it a bunch of times this year! I'd bring it to work, and everyone would say things like, "ooh, that looks good, what is it?" The only change I made was that I added some cut up chicken.

OK..I just returned from the Carribean, and had a FANTASTIC pumpkin coconut soup at Oliver's in Anguilla. I have made this recipe 2x now, and I have it PERFECT!! If you follow these directions to a T, you will have ALMOST exactly the soup I ate there. Double the cumin.Use 1 can of black beans only. Use 2 cups veggie broth. This recipe makes a lot of soup. If you don't want this much, you could use 1 cup of veggie broth, and half the can of pumpkin. I also added pepper while cooking, and pepper when serving. I also garnished with a ring of lime in the center of each bowl. Presentation is everything!! I know that there are a lot of variations to this recipe in the reviews. Feel free to try them all, of course, but to really stay true to the intended flavors of this soup, do this. It is fantastic..

I had a lot of problems with this one, starting with the fact that I live in Japan and Japanese just aren't big on canned foods. This meant I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned, which was fine, and dried beans, which were terrible. Whatever you do, do not use dried beans! I also forgot to buy cumin; used allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon. I replaced the coconut milk with fresh cream (my wife hates coconut milk). In the end, the soup itself had a good, mildly sweet flavor and nice consistency, except for the beans.

This is so quick, and really delicious. I'd definitely serve for a dinner party or just every day. Next time I would add more beans, and the extra spices recommended by the other reviewers were a needed hint.

This is the first pumpkin soup I ever liked. After enjoying this soup this weekend, (my mom made it) I decided to make it myself. It is soooo easy. Two things to note. It's great with chicken. Also, this recipe makes way more than two servings.

Didn't really care for this recipe. If I tried it again,I may want to add more cilantro, lime and salt as one reviewer suggested.

It does not get any easier than this! Don't skimp on the fresh cilantro, lime juice, or salt - it makes all the difference (otherwise the soup does lack some depth). For those who thought it was bland, maybe using chicken or beef broth rather than vegetable stock would help?

I've made the soup...for a dinner party tomorrow night. Based on previous reviews, I thought if it sat overnight, it might be better...we'll see. So far, I'm not impressed. I tried several of the suggestions and the only things I added (additionally) were more coconut milk and some grated unsweetened coconut. I do like the texture of the soup--and the consistency is nice. I think it's a bit bland even with the reviewer additions I've made thus far (sauteed garlic, pepper,onion, chili powder). Be prepared to "doctor" this one up. Also, I agree with previous reviewers that this makes way more than 2 servings. Wish me luck!!

This recipe didn't do it for me. At first I thought it didn't have enough substance, so I added rice. I still thought it lacked a certain depth of flavor that I suppose comes from starting with sautéed vegetables. The following day, I tried to salvage it by adding milk, pumpkin pie spices, and a bit of sugar. Then it was pretty good, but nothing like the original!

This is truly a wonderful soup. My husband says he never gets tired of it. (I only make it once or twice a year -- so maybe that's why!) Even my kids liked it -- but they generally like anything. It's so easy, and so quick - and the combination of flavors is very unique and interesting. I thought next time I might sprinkle some chopped cilantro leaves on top for another flavor dimension.

This is a nice, quick weekday soup. To add a little depth to the flavor and increase the texture, I sauteed 1 chopped red onion, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 chopped green bell pepper before adding the cumin. I also used 2 cans of black beans, which I think is a must-- with only one you can barely tell the beans are there. Some grated sharp cheddar makes a nice garnish.

I was expecting a mix of sweet, sour & spice, but the recipe was a little blah. I left out the lime peel due to allergies, but added more lime juice to make up for it. I salvaged the recipe by adding even more lime juice and toasting some additional cumin seeds to sprinkle over the top. It may be better on the second day. I'm thinking something like fresh pineapple or red bell pepper might help.

Good the first time I made it; better with the addition of garlic and onion the second time. It makes at least three very generous servings, not the two stated in the recipe.
