Finally! A really good recipe for the overwhelming cherry tomato crop. The flavor is superb, and my picky husband thought so as well. Only change I made was to add fresh basil at the end and top with a little fresh parm.

This is one of my favorite (and easiest) go to recipes! I sometimes substitute or leave off some ingredients (use shallots instead of garlic, leave off feta and use parmasean, etc.) and it always tastes great.

Excellent and easy. I'll definitely make this again. I used cherry tomatoes and oregano from our garden.

Deserves 3-1/2 forks and is a quick and easy, flavorful sauce for any pasta. My produce store was practically giving away cherry and grape tomatoes (red and yellow), so I loaded up and used the fresh oregano that overruns my garden. I roasted a combination of tomatoes, which it quite colorful. The recipe should tell you not to season until the end, as the capers, olives and feta (I used an ordinary one) provide so much salt. It certainly wasn't inedible, but I will hold off next time and not season it until the very end. Plus I will try with a better feta as well. I don't think rinsing off the capers does that much. However, I love the addition of some shrimp and plan to make more of this for the freezer. You do have to toast pine nuts; they are raw.

This is, indeed, a lovely marriage of tastes. I used the last of my bumper crop of cherry tomatoes, oregano from the garden and good quality balsamic. I marinated the tomatoes for several hours, just because I wanted the work done ahead of time. I made no changes in the recipe except, since there were only four of us, I only cooked 12 oz. of pasta and still there were enough leftovers to almost feed four of us again. (We all loved the pasta but there was still salad and dessert to come.)

This was great. Used tomatoes on the vine cut into chunks as they were WAY cheaper than cherry tomatoes this time of year. Followed everything else to the letter and it was so good even my 6, 5, and 2 year old ate it up. It also provides lots of leftovers which is nice. Husband asked that I please remember this one and make it again!

This dish is pretty darn close to perfect. I've made in twice in the last month and it turned out great both times. It's received rave reviews from a wide range of guests - - from my college-age son and his buddies to a friend who's lived in Tuscany. I follow the recipe, but sometimes add more garlic and shredded fresh basil on top at the end. This is so easy and oh-so satisfying! For those who find this dish too salty, I suggest rinsing the capers with water before adding and using best-quality feta, which tends to be less salty than the garden-variety feta.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any cherry tomatoes, but I had some big ones out of the garden which I diced up and used. Also, I'm not a huge feta fan, so I used goat cheese, which I thought was wonderful in this dish. When I make it again, I may omit the pine nuts or the capers maybe, but it's generally a really flavorful, interesting dish!

Rating: 4
We really enjoyed this alot. Roasting the cherry tomatoes with the vinegar makes them very sweet and delicious. Also a very easy recipe with impressive results. I was generous with the balsamic vinegar (probably doubled) and used regular slice olives and dried oregano. I also added a touch of pasta water when I added the tomatoes to the pasta just to give it a little more liquid.

Really simple to make but Very tasty. I used what we had so I subbed the bowtie for multigrain penne, cherry tomatoes for regular heirloom and fresh parsley and dry oregano instead of the fresh oregano. My husband loved it.

This was so simple to make and the result was just fantastic. I used the grocery store balsamic recommended by Americas Test Kitchen (Monari Federzoni) which has a wonderful rich flavor. I also toasted the pine nuts slightly to bring out the nutty-ness. Only made 1/2 recipe since I didn't think leftovers would taste as good as freshly made. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and loved the result. I'll make this one again.

nicely balanced and a great way to show off summer's bold flavors. It is particularly good with whole wheat pasta. This will definitely be a "go to" recipe for my family

I made this last night with some whole wheat pasta. It was delicious and a nice change-I will definitely make it again. I think I was a little "heavy handed" with the capers- I'll use less of them or omit them next time around as they were a bit strong with the other flavors.

I made this recipe for my family, and everyone loved it, my son who is such a picky eater got seconds. I subsituted shrimp for the capers, put a lot more red pepper in (it gave it a zing) and did not toast the pine nuts. Overall it was delicious and we will be making it again.

We loved this recipe; I needed something to bring to my boyfriends house and cook, so I made the sauce ahead of time, just assembled there and everyone loved it. Don't leave the pine nuts out; they added a great crunch to the dish and the nutty flavor blended with tomatoes and olives very well. A keeper in my house!

Very good. Used more tomatoes.Needed to peel them, then sauted in garlic and oil & used a French feta. Next time I'll use less olives, and a different cheese

Delish! A few modifications (based on what we had in the pantry): radiatore pasta (shaped like little radiators?), 1/2 feta and 1/2 goat cheese, and vine tomatoes instead of cherry. I agree that cooking the whole shebang together for just a minute at the end melds the flavors in the nicest way. I also let the pasta sit for a minute in a covered pan (while the fish was finishing), and that seemed to help everything set. Oh, and since I started late, I roasted the toms @ 475 for about 10 min, then broiled 'em for about 5--even faster & tasted great--nice & roasty!

Rating: 4
Delicious, easy, and beautiful! We used sungold and red cherry tomatoes and rounded out with a few heirlooms of various colors (2.5 lbs of cherry tomatoes is a lot! Ours were tiny, organic cherry tomatoes that were more like grape tomatoes)so we had lots of color in the finished dish. Followed recipe closely, except for addition of a few heirlooms and used a pasta shape called rombi that I hadn't used before. Oh, and added a touch more garlic. Thought the recipe was perfect for weeknight dinner with guests. Everyone had seconds. Just the right amount of kick from the red pepper. Will make again!

This is delicous made with either grape or cherry tomatoes but the cherry seem to make it a bit more saucy. Be careful with the salt, the feta, olives and capers lend a lot of salt to the dish when it's finished.

yum, Yum, YUMMMM! Excellent. My husband went nuts over this recipe. I really liked it but wasnt crazy about it at first. The second time I made it I added the oregano into the tomatoes before roasting then added a bit more after. I think next time I will make the sauce in advance, chill it to let the flavors get a chance to soak in and then put it together with the pasta and remaining ingredients. I even used reduced fat feta, which didnt melt as well but was equally good.

Since I already had some roasted tomatoes in the fridge, this recipe was a sinch. And it was delicious. I look forward to making it soon again.

I've made this dish probably a dozen times, and each time to rave reviews. It's pretty flawless, and you can improvise a lot -- you can use cherry or grape tomatoes; you can use feta or goat cheese; you can use any black olive; you can use any pasta. You can also adapt the cooking time of the tomatoes to fit your schedule. Whatever I do, my guests demand that I make this again. The one crucial thing is to return the sauce, pasta, and cheese back to the pot to cook. Also, I toast more pinenuts and add these to the pot too.

Rating: 4
Very quick and tasty pasta dish; I increased the amounts of cheese and olives, and cut back a bit on the capers and the tomatoes. I also toasted the pine nuts, which enhanced the flavor in my opinion. Definitely something I'd make again, well liked by all.

This was great! I was in a panic about what to make for some vegetarian dinner guests, and this dish came through. Roasting the tomatoes took minimal effort but quickly transformed the dish from regular pasta into dressy pasta. I grabbed a package of pre-sliced bell peppers and roasted them along with the tomatoes, which added more crunch color & flavor.

I made this dish for the first time when I had guests. It's wonderfully simple and very tasty. I served it as an accompaniment with salmon filets. I used parmesean cheese instead of feta and I did not put the pine nuts. I will definately make it again. The olives make the dish zest.

This was scrumptious. I too used grape tomatoes and it was a pleasure to roast them so nicely to add a rich and beautiful sauce. I chose this recipe so as to use up my fresh oregano, and I too substituted left-over basil for sage...Mmm! Italian cookbook author Marcella Hazan writes of the deep, deep comfort that pasta affords, and in my opinion this lovely recipe epitomizes what she means.

I agree - I can't wait to make this again in the summer when the tomatoes are fresh. I too used grape tomatoes, and I skipped the pine nuts and capers and used romano instead of feta. I halved the recipe and used proportionately less cheese and it was still salty. My husband and I both really liked it, but I couldn't imagine it with more salt. We had a crusty bread and an aeromatic Pinot Noir - wonderful combination!

I made this recipe as it reads, and eveyone loved it. It's definitely "a keeper" that will show up at future family meals. The flavor would, of course, be enhanced if it were tomato season, but the flavor still came through with the help of the wonderful assorted ingredients. I light red wine went great along with a salad and crusty bread.

Made this dish for my girlfriend and her vegetarian friend; wasn't expecting it to be much. My girlfriend loves it so much, she ate all of the leftovers and demands that I make it again. I thought it was pretty good myself. The sauce is outstanding and the capers and feta are extremely good. If you plan on having leftovers, save some kalamata olives to add in as you eat; they lose their a bit of their flavor and the dish will suffer for it without them. Made this with the apple walnut endive salad and they go well together.

I have made this several times because everyone likes it. I took it to friends' this past weekend which worked out great! I just roasted the tomatoes and seasonings, added the capers, and put it all in a plastic container in my cooler along with the cheese. All we had to do was bring things to room temperature, cook the pasta, toss a salad, heat up garlic bread, and VOILA! dinner!

Wow, this was really good! I used the reddest, ripest plum tomatoes cut into quarters instead of cherry tomatoes, and used 2 teaspoons of dried oregano (mixed with the tomatoes etc. before roasting) instead of fresh. After roasting, I mashed the tomatoes slightly with a fork. Too bad I won't be able to make this dish during winter when tomatoes are all pink and mealy...

This was a very good recipe to make use of some sweet cherry tomatoes from the farmer's market. The feta and olives add enough saltiness so I thought the capers were unnecessary. Next time, I'd add some roasted red peppers to counter the saltiness and add to the sweetness of the tomatoes.

A fantastic weeknight dinner dish. I halved the recipe for the two of us, but maintained the number of cloves of garlic at five. I also used dried oregano and added it into the olive oil mixture before baking. I suspect the sauce would also be excellent over grilled chicken or swordfish on a bed of, say, orzo. Hmmmmmm, may have to give that a whirl soon :-D

This recipe is GREAT -- it tastes even better than a similar one I always order at a favorite restaurant. It is essential to use high quality ingredients. I used dry cured olives instead of brine cured, because of their richer flavor and texture. I think that roasted eggplant, roasted zucchini, artichoke hearts and proscuitto would make great additions.

I had purchased large container of cherry tomatoes at the warehouse and went in search of a recipe to use them. I am so glad that I picked this one since I was doing a "first day of summer celebration dinner." I used 1/2 lb. of penne and rinsed the capers to reduce the salt. Even my roommate who doesn't care for pasta ate it. Served it with warm foccacia. Yum!!! Perfect for my vegetarian lifestyle. Definitely a keep.

I adored this meal. I roasted three baskets of cherry tomatoes, (minus the few handfuls my two year old ate,) and they turned out sweet and delicious. I did reduce the oil a bit. Also added some fresh oregano because we happened to have some. Discovered that my family not a huge fan of capers and will leave them out next time. (Their flavor is distinct and adds to the dish, so if you enjoy them, certainly include them.) Too be indulgent, I'll add a few more pine-nuts next time. So good....

I have made this a number of times according to the original recipe and my family has loved it each time. For variety's sake I tried a number of the reviewer's suggestions and the result was unbelieveable: along with the tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, red pepper and olive oil, I added cubed eggplant, regular sliced black olives and capers to the pan and roasted them together. I sauteed boneless skinless chicken breasts and then put them in the pan with the tomato mixture to finish cooking. When everything was done, I served the chicken breasts on a bed of orzo, then spooned the sauce over the top and sprinkled the feta, toasted pine nuts and a bit of minced oregano on top of the sauce...it was magnificent and every morsel was gone.

My new favorite pasta recipe. I used vine-ripened regular tomatoes instead of cherry and removed most of the seeds prior to roasting. I also used less olive oil. Otherwise, the recipe's proportions seem just right. The feta makes the sauce creamy and the pine nuts add a nice crunch to the texture. Not to mention that the preparation is simple enough to make this a good weeknight meal.

Although I toasted the pignoli nuts, I completely forgot all about them! I'll use for the leftovers. Served with crusty Italian bread. I personally thought the capers were very much needed, gave it all the more of that Meditterenean taste. I too used grape tomatoes which smelled great while roasting with the garlic. I also cut back on the olive oil (Extra-Virgin) to 1/4 cup and used fresh oregano from my garden. Will make again.

This was fantastic. It would have been even better if I would have had enough feta to add to the pasta. Since I only had a little, I just sprinkled some on top.

I cooked this last night and we found it very light and summery (as long as you don't use too much oil) Not sure what it's like with capers though. I always find them very overpowering so I didn't use them. I'll definitely cook it again.

I accidentally burned my tomatoes while roasting. Boo Hoo. They did smell delicious too (before they burned!) Luckily, I had a jar of sundried tomatoes in oil that sliced up. I made the rest of the recipe as directed. I love capers and thought they were a great addition. Oh, I used the oil from the tomatoes rather than plain olive oil, I thought it would add more flavor. I plan to make again in the summer when the tomatoes are ripe. Next time I'll watch the oven better!

I would give this recipe a 2 1/2. I don't think the cherry tomatoes were sweet enough and combined with the olives, feta and capers, it made the dish quite tart. I might try it again in the summer when tomatoes are in season. It's the kind of recipe that once you make it, you don't need to follow the recipe as printed again. The smell of the tomatoes and garlic being roasted was wonderful in the kitchen. I used whole wheat rotini, light feta and cut down on the olive oil substantially.

I thought this recipe sounded interesting when I first saw it in the magazine and decided to try it after reading the reviews. I cut out the olive oil and just sprayed the tomatoes with olive oil cooking spray instead. I also roasted mushrooms to add to the pasta and left out the capers. The final result was delicious. The oil was not missed and I could not imagine what it would have added to the dish other than unnecessary calories. Same for capers -what's the point? Try this - it was a little time consuming for a weeknight, but fun and easy for a Sunday evening dinner.

I made half this recipe for dinner for two - it got RAVE reviews. I dramatically reduced the amounts of oil and cheese, and used penne instead of farfalle, because we had it on hand. I'll use a different pasta next time, though it was still delicious.

Made this. My wife loved it. I thought it was just okay--my wife has more sophisticated taste than I.

I think this dish has great potential, but I felt the cheese was overpowering and the tomato flavor was lost. Next time I will reduce the amount of cheese to 1-2 ounces and reduce the pasta to about a 1/2 pound to allow the tomato flavors to come through better. As others have said, the amount of oil can be reduced. I reduced it to 1/4 cup and I think next time I will cut back even further.

This dish is a winner! I too cut back on the oil to two tablespoons. I added the cooked, drained pasta along with all other ingredients to the hot dish of tomatoes straight from the oven. I could do without the pine nuts but my husband liked them a lot. Used orrechete pasta-the shape holds the sauce really well. Quick to make and satisfying flavours-what more could one want? Thanks for a great recipe.

Absolutely deelish! I too sub'd gorgonzola for the feta, and used shell pasta which "caught" all the ingredients nicely. It would also be good on pizza crust...

This is a good one. The flavors are just great together! We had fresh "peel and eat" shrimp and a nice bottle of Husch California wine...great eating for a springtime Sunday night. Would probably go well with grilled chicken as well. I rarely give four forks but this deserves all four.

Wow!!! I made this for myself when my beau was out because he HATES cooked tomatoes. I had enough left over for a little lunch but I ate it up before the night was over. I used grape tomatoes which are very sweet and I think make a big difference, also coarse grey sea salt and loads of pine nuts. I only had dried oregano which was fine. Who knew that something so simple could taste so unbelievable?! I made it again last night for my boyfriend only using a little dried herb and finished it with fresh oregano and he declared it a "keeper"! Make it - you'll love it!

I made this for my family of four last night using only 1 lb of cherry tomatoes, 1 tbsp of olive oil, 2 garlic cloves and 1 lb of cheese tortellini. I left everything else basically the same. They liked it, but said they would prefer it with plain pasta instead of tortellini.

Very flavorful and looks good on the plate. I'm planning to use for a vegetarian dinner party that I'm planning already!

This dish is going to become a staple in our house. So easy to prepare and very delicious. Comments about reducing the oil are right on. I didn't measure, but used significantly less than what is called for. We paired this with an Australian Shiraz and it was yummy!

This was great and almost no work. I too used Roma tomatoes cut in eighths due to price and used dried oregano. Definitely add the pine nuts--bites of this dish with the nuts have a delicious buttery velvety flavour. As another reviewer noted, this is sooo Mediterranean. Would work I think with almost any pasta (but the bow ties are so pretty) and many other cheeses. This is a keeper!

This is the exact kind of recipe that I look for. It was fun to make and extremely delicious. This dish will now become a regular in our house.

I thought this recipe was great!!!! I made it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. The fresh oregano was the best flavor!

I made this last night for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. I used 3 pints of cherry tomatoes and that seemed to be the right amount for one pound of orrichette. Also used gorgonzola instead of feta because I like it better. Reduced the amount of oil to two tablespoons. Skipped the pine nuts and forgot to add the capers (maybe it was the wine...) but didn't miss them at all. This is a really good sauce that tastes very complex but is easy to prepare. I'll make this again soon.

Have made this a few times now. I use the grape tomatoes found at Costco (price is right!) I would recommend cutting the kalamata olives in thirds or so. Very good combination of flavors.

This was wonderful and a definite hit in my family! Great flavors!

Only two of the six who ate this loved it. The other four would pass on it again. My guess is because the flavors were not as rich as a roasted tomato and sun dried tomato pasta we eat regularly.

So, if you are a purist who belives the recipes should only be rated if made exactly as listed, ignore this review. If you want a more econimical and healthier way to make this, read on. Cherry tomatoes were $2.59 for a 7 oz. box so I bought plum tomatoes for .89 cents a lb. instead. I cut them up into 8ths and roasted them with less oil the garlic and balsamic vinegar. What a delicious aroma and taste!! I also omitted the capers because I don't like them and the pine nuts. I served the sauce (everything else in the recipe) with orzo, mixed in well. Everyone loved it,will definately be making this again.

I loved this recipe. This one keeps well for leftovers (though a bit garlicky for lunch at work), it is a snap to prepare, and you can make the sauce in advance. I have used rotini instead of the farfalle, and I have used basil instead of oregano, both with success.

Great dish. The pine nuts were an outstanding element. Not sure what the capers brought to the party - next time I will omit. Be sure to use real Kalamata olives, even if removing pits is a bore. Served with pita and hummus. Yum.

Really excellent. I had wonderful cherry tomatoes and made the recipe as written. Loved this recipe, and it is easy to make. Will use it again.

I substitute Campanelle because neither my wife nor I am big Farfalle fans. The results are superb. I do not know anyone who has not loved this dish with any suitable pasta used.

If I could give this recipe 5 forks I would. My husband and I ate more than we should have because it was delicious and had an interesting mix of flavors.

Worth repeating! I was delighted with this assertively-flavored pasta. The ingredients and textures work harmoniously and isn't boring like many pasta recipes out there. I don't usually care for olives, but I loved them in this! Only change I'd make is to add a bit of wilted spinach, it adds a nice contrasting color.

The results were so much more gratifying than the amount of work deserved. I served it to a group of 8, 4 of whom are very discriminating eaters, and they loved it. I wouldn't change a thing!

I cook recipes from this site all the time and I've never been motivated to write a review...until now. This dish was so delicious that I almost cried. I went easy on the feta and added a little more oregano and WOW! I'd serve this to even the most discriminating foodies.

This was a fantastic and easy recipe! The flavors were complex and very mediteranian. Note that you don't have to be a feta fan to like this. The kids didn't even know!

Fantastic! I try not to compliment my own cooking during the meal but I couldn't help myself while eating this one. My dinner guest heartily agreed. We both noted the importance of keeping the pasta - i used spaghetti - al dente. Another reviewer mentioned that "the pine nuts made all the difference". I forgot to add them, so I can hardly wait to make this dish again...for an even better experience, no doubt!

great dish! easy and very tasty. flavors all meld and complement each other beautifully. a green salad and you are done. the only thing slow was roasting the tomatoes, but you can do it ahead for a fast delicious weeknite dinner.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. It is simple to make and tastes delicious. The pine nuts make all the difference. I will definitely make this again.
