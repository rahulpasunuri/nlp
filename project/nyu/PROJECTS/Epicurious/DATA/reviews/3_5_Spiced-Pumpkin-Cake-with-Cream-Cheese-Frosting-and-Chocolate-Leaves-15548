Delicious! I searched for a good pumpkin cake recipe and this one was by far the best.

This is sooo good and decadent. I did not make the leaves because I could not find them. Can't wait to make again

My husband made this with our 3 year old, for my birthday, complete with the chocolate leaves and 3 layers. Beautiful, delicious. I will request it again now that I know they can do it!

I LOVE this recipe. I love the idea of a spice cake with pumpkin. Also, after I made this cake for a friend's birthday, another friend decided that I should open a bakery ;) About the frosting... I skipped the orange peel and used Kahlua instead of molasses because that was what I had the first time. It turned out delicious! Another time I tried creme de cacao- okay, but not nearly as good as the kahlua.

I'm surprised. I have been baking for more than 30 years - this is the first time I have ever thrown a cake away. The cake was adequate but the frosting - made exactly as written - was a disaster. No one (out of 20) like it.

This was a huge success with the following modifications. 1) I made this in the form of cupcakes 2) I didn't do the chocolate leaves 3) after reading complaints about the frosting, I instead used the frosting for the Pumpkin cake roll (Gourmet mag) 1 8-ounce package cream cheese, room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts Mix all together. I then frosted the cupcakes individually after they cooled. The cupcakes came out moist and flavorful. The modified frosting was so yummy - with or without the cake!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dessert and it was a big success! The presentation drew a lot of interest and the cake itself was quite delicious. I was nervous about attempting the leaves, but although time consuming, found it to be quite easy. I also found I could get the same amount of leaves from half the amount of chocolate (1 3.5 oz bar of Lindt in each flavor). This is a keeper.

Very nice cake. I followed the recipe exactly. I made two recipes of batter for a 12x18" sheet cake that I turned out for frosting and decorating. I also doubled the frosting recipe, but a single recipe was probably generous enough to frost the double recipe sheet cake. I wasn't sure I liked the frosting when I tasted it alone, but in combination with the pumpkin flavor of the cake it was wonderful. The leaves were fun and made a delicious contribution to the overall flavor and look of this cake. I'm sure I'll make this cake again this fall.

I made this for a birthday party I catered in June and it was a huge success. Instead of a cream cheese frosting, I made a white chocolate butter cream for it and it was an amazing combination. One guest said it was the best cake he had ever tasted. So I am definitely making this cake again for my children's birthday party.

I have made this recipe three times and absolutely love it! I've gotten nothing but rave reviews on it, and it's quite an impressive presenation with the leaves. I have substituted golden raisins for dried currants and it's just as good. This recipe is definately a keeper!

Made the cake for a kids Halloween party, and it was a big hit -- very moist and tasty. I left out the nuts (in case of allergies) and used golden raisins instead of currants. Also, I made it to look like a pumpkin -- baked in Bundt pan (colored frosting orange), ice cream cone in middle for stem (green frosting) and piped green lines down the side. I used another cream cheese frosting recipe and didn't have time for the leaves.

I made this for a halloween party -- just the cake and not the frosting because I ran out of time. I didn't do the leaves either but the cake was great. Didn't have ground cloves so I put in 1/8 t ground ginger instead. Left out the nuts and used raisins instead of currants. Cake was light, moist and yummy. Made 12 regular sized muffins and one 5inch round. Will make again this week for my son's preschool in mini muffins. Will make for another halloween party with the frosting. Will rate it again after making the frosting.

I have to admit I was afraid to make the frosting based on the reviews - half liked it, half really disliked it. I decided to substitue maple syrup for the molasses and omit the orange peel since that is where most of the complaints seemed to arise. The color was light brown, so I chanced it and based on another review added red and yellow food coloring to attempt some sort of orange color. I would not do that again as the color was that of what another reviewer called silly putty or some sort of salmon mousse. Nonetheless, the frosting tasted great, I even put in more powdered sugar to make it nice and stiff. Heck, if you are going to eat cake it might as well be sweet. I wondered about adding a little pumpkin puree to get the right color but didn't have any left. Or even maybe a little carrot juice? I'll try one of those next time, instead of the food coloring. The flavor however was great. The cake tasted great. I also omitted nuts due to too many allergies and subbed golden raisins for currants. Don't dust them in flour though - a lot of the flour didn't dissipate and remained on the raisins which was unsightly. Finally, I made the chocolate leaves. They made the cake. Plan at least an extra hour to do this, but they take it from an ordinary to an extraordinary cake and made it the showpiece of the party. I wasn't able to find lemon or camellia leaves but asked the florist and used some leaves they use for arrangements. I was a little apprehensive since I hoped they weren't poisonous or something. I washed them well with soap and water and dried them. They worked wonderfully. Beautiful!

I LOVED this cake. I have to admit I didn't prepare the frosting as I was afraid of some bad reviews. I just make regular cream cheese frosting. The cake has excellent flavor and is very moist.

This cake was very DENSE. One slice laid on the plate like brick. Is it supposed to be that way or did do something wrong? I'm a novice, so it's entirely possible. I followed the recipe to the letter. I thought the icing was DISGUSTING when I sampled some out of the bowl, and just tolerable with the cake. It tasted really buttery, not cream-cheesy. And the color was just unappetizing looking. It was the color of silly putty. What a waste of an afternoon.

I really liked the spices and flavor of this cake. I omitted the nuts just because I don't care for nuts in cake, and the recipe worked fine. I used neufchatel cheese, and the frosting turned out great. There was an abundance of frosting, but that's better than not having enough! Also, I didn't make the chocolate leaves, though a friend claims it's easy to make them...

Made this again for about the 10th time. This cake turns out perfect every time. I did not have any brown sugar so I subbed some white sugar with a little molasses and the taste was still the same. I also used craisins instead of currants. I have NEVER made the chocolate leaves and feel this cake doesnt really need them. There is tons of icing so I just get out a piping bag and pipe a nice top to the cake and sprinkle with some fall colored 'jimmies'. beautiful presentation.

This recipe was very easy to do. I'm not a fan of spreading icing, but after a few takes, it worked out. Everyone at my dinner at my fathers' house, loved it, and so I would make this cake again but next time I will make time to do the leaves. We don't have lemon trees in Canada, so I will opt that out and find something similar.

This recipe was fabulous! My friend and I actually nixed the chocolate leaves all together and just made the cake. Boy, did it save a lot of time! The cake was easy to make, and looked great even without the leaves. I would definitly make this cake again.

I made this cake for a halloween party and it was the best dressed thing there. I omitted the powdered sugar from the frosting, and it was still sweet enough. I had many requests for the recipe.

I was surprised by this recipe -- it tasted completely differently than I had imagined...it was better! Not at all pumpkin-y, it is easy to make and is a very satisfying dessert with a complex, pleasing flavor. All the flavors work well together, especially the currants which do not overwhelm the delicate taste or texture of the cake. The frosting recipe makes a huge batch, I did not use all and put the remainder on a loaf of carrot bread.

I made this for my boyfriends birthday. It was I hit! My hot firefighter nieghbor loved it too!

My family loved it. I prepared the cake batter according to instructions except that I ommited the currants and walnuts. I used a 13 x 9 inch pan, baked for 30 minutes and used a prepared cream cheese frosting. This cake was quick and easy and soooo good! I would like to try the long version some day when I have time and some company to serve it to.

This is a good cake recipe to have on hand for the fall months. I omitted the currants and nuts in order to suit the preference of my guests. (Although next time, I'll try making it with raisins.) I also used 2% reduced-fat milk instead of whole & the cake still tasted great. On the other hand, the accompanying frosting isn't that great. I'd look for another recipe for the frosting.

Love this cake! It's easy and the frosting sets it off very nicely. Only omitted the orange peel due to an allergy. It made a beautiful fall wedding cake. I also did a dark choclate cake decorated with white chocolate and butterscotch leaves. The two cakes together were delicious and made a stunning presentation.

I made this cake with golden raisins instead of the currants and with 2% milk. Since the icing received mixed reviews, I used the maple cream cheese icing recipe that went with the apple cake in the same issue. I was wonderful. My icing was a nice caramel color, though, not the white from the picture. I suspect this was due to the dark brown color of my maple extract as opposed to the clear that it also comes in. Excellent Fall cake.

Yummy and very fast. I did not have currants so used Craisins (dried cranberries). Very good. The icing recipe did not appeal to me so used the "lemon cream cheese icing" also from this site. It was a very good combination and did not overpower the delicate flavour of the cake. Next time I would probably add greater quantities of the spices.

I made this for my son's birthday party the day after Thanksgiving. The very tasty cake was a bit overwhelmed by the frosting, I thought. I might use mild molasses and light brown sugar next time in the frosting. Also, I had at least a cup of frosting left over. I didn't do the chocolate leaves. Note that the recipe calls for cake pans with two-inch sides. I just used the normal shallower cake pans and nothing spilled over in cooking.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone raved about it. I found the recipe easy to follow and make. The only change I made was to eliminate 1/2 stick butter from the frosting, and I think I could have eliminated one whole stick.

I made this cake for a "Fall season" party and everybody loved it!! I accidentally omitted the powder sugar from the frosting and it was still creamy-smooth,rich and delicious. I plan on making this again, very soon. It will be a perfect compliment to any Thanksgiving dinner.

Didn't think the orange flavor of the frosting worked well with the cake. Also, the cake was bland. I expected a more intense pumpkin flavor.

Rating: 2
I made the cake, including the leaves, and it looked spectacular. However, the dark molassas--added primarily for color--ruined the flavor of the frosting, in my opinion. It's an acquired taste, perhaps. I'll use maple syrup next time, even though the color won't be as good.

Thanks for this easy and stunning dessert - now everyone expects this dessert for all occasions and won't eat anything else (unless my sister brings your Jan 1999 flourless chocolate cake!)

This cake had a wonderful spiced flavour. I omitted the leaves etc. as I ran out of time. I also served it up with sprinkled Icing Sugar rather than the frosting. A really lovely cake, one would never know it had pumpkin in it. Also I used fresh pumpkin, as we do not have canned pumpkin readily available

The cake was wonderful but I thought the frosting had too strong of a cream cheese flavor. I ended up with a lot of leftover frosting-next time will try 12 oz or less of cream cheese. I made this cake a week ago and it's still moist. I plan to make another this weekend for my dad's birthday.

i WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT IS BETWEEN 3 AND 4 FORKS. THE FROSTING IS WONDERFUL, ALTHOUGH i USED LESS CREAM CHEESE AND SUGAR SINCE THE CAKE IS ALREADY SO SWEET. EVERYONE AT WORK RAVED ABOUT IT. i ALSO SKIPPED THE WHOLE CHOC. LEAVES PART. I'MM OVER THAT STUFF!

I made this cake last year for my husband's early November birthday, and he loved it so much he wanted it for Thanksgiving dinner as well. My whole family loved it, and have asked me to make it again for this year's Thanksgiving get-together!

This is a perfect fall cake! I added some candied ginger for a little extra spice, and the cake itself kept perfectly when made two days in advance and frosted later. Substituting the molasses and powdered sugar with two tablespoons of pure maple syrup provided the autumnal color and prevented a cloying sweetness.

I made this cake for a Halloween party last night. Because our "guests" were 9 and 10 year olds, I omitted the currants and 1/2 of the nuts, but the cake was still delicious. I added yellow and red food coloring to the frosting to make it orange, and used a scraper on a hunk of good chocolate to make curls that looked like bugs, worms, critters, etc. Almost everyone asked for seconds, even my fussy 9 year old! Definitely a keeper!

Delicious and lovely cake, but the brown sugar frosting much too sweet. I made this in 6 layers for a birthday cake and substituted regular cream cheese frosting (with 1 T. of powdered sugar per oz. of cream cheese) for all sides but the top, for which I used the brown sugar frosting to set off the white chocolate leaves. The chocolate leaves were fun to make. Paint a generous layer on each leaf; too thin and it breaks when removing. Our guests raved at the presentation and taste. Well worth the effort.

This cake is not as difficult to make as it sounds and the resulting presentation is very elegant and delicious.
