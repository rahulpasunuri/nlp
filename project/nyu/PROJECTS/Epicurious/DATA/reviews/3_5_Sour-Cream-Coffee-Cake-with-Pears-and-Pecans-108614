This coffee cake was okay but definitely nothing special... Good flavors and not too dense, but it required way too much work for what it was. Five bazillion dirty dishes in the sink!

This was delicious and a crowd pleaser. Mine got to brown around the edges, be careful not to over cook.

I used two pears and I wished I had used three. The pear really adds a lot! Don't overcook, it gets dry fat!

Hadn't made this for a long time so tried it again. Found the batter a little skimpy for the size of the pan and the edges browned a bit too much. Think i'd use 2 8 inch square pans next time. Good texture, good flavour.

This turned out great! I even added some whole wheat flour - about 1/2 cup and used FF milk and light sour cream. Turned out moist and light. It took about 50 minutes at 6600 feet (higher altitude), and to compensate for the high altitude I added about 2 T extra milk, reduced the white sugar by a few teaspoons and the baking powder by 1/4 tsp. I'm freezing half of the cake for work and school snacks....

I've been searching for a great coffee cake for some time, most sour cream cakes leave me cold. But this one was amazing. The cake is light and airy and the combination of the lemon zest and the pears make it special and unique. The topping is crunchy without being overly sweet. This will definitely be a keeper!!!!

This cake is amazing. I made it for a large party and everyone asked for the recipe. This will definitely become a tradition in our home.

We loved this coffee cake. In fact, it was one of the best. I followed the suggestion by others to double the fruit and am glad I did. This recipe is bookmarked to make again :)

This is a really good coffee cake recipe. All the ingredients work well together and you would hardly know that there are pears. The topping makes it! I made half the recipe using an 8-inch baking pan - perfect after 35 minutes in the oven. BTW, I used FF milk and light sour cream.

This recipe tastes fine but not amazing. The topping is overwhelmingly pecan flavored and could benefit fro the addition of a white sugar to offset the nuttiness. There's also not nearly enough fruit. It should be doubled at least. Also, it is a lot of work (4 bowls) to yield the simple, okay tasting cake that you get.

Very easy and tasty! Was able to use pears we hadn't eaten. I made a few substitutes only because of what I was missing - I ran out of flour and had to replace 1 1/2 c flour with bisquick, and I used 1% milk and extra pears. Used walnuts instead of pecans. Very, very good. I think the crumb of mine was different because of the bisquick though.

Made exactly as directed but used about 2 1/4-2 1/2 cups pears (two large pears, peeled, cored, diced). Tasted my pears first and they were good and flavorful. This was too sweet and not much flavor. Looked exactly like the picture.

This was good but not superb or special. Ideally, I would give it 2 1/2 forks. As suggested, I doubled the fruit. That was a good idea. I found the batter a little skimpy for covering the surface area of the pan, but by scattering dollops of batter, I was able to spread it out evenly.

Great coffee cake. Light and very moist. Like most reviewers I think next time I would add more fruit. The 1 1/2 cups didn't quite cover the surface. I used light sour cream, fat free half-and-half and walnuts instead of pecans only because that is what I had on hand. I found that the amount of topping was perfect, I didn't think I needed any more. I only baked mine for 45 minutes and the cake was very brown but not overdone. I will definately make this again, maybe with apples or fresh peaches.

The pears I used didn't have much flavor. Next time I might use something else. I doubled the filling/topping as someone had suggested. It was good. I would make it again.

Very delicious, no changes to the recipe at all! It was a bit time consuming but worth it. Everyone loved it, definitely making this one again.

Very good! I used Granny Smith apples instead of pears. It's a little time-consuming/putzy to make but a good coffee cake. Next time I will try not to grind the nuts so much.

Best coffee cake I could imagine! I made it twice with reduced sugar and double the topping. You wont be able to stop picking at the topping, yum....

A HIT! Made cake less sweet with 1/3 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Topping was excellent.

Great cake for a crowd. I added cranberries to the topping and pears for colour and a bit of sourness. Definitely too much sugar in the cake batter; I reduced the granulated sugar by 1/4 cup and it was delicious. Also used buttermilk instead of sour cream/milk combination.

i made this cake for our anniversary, my husband and i thought it was delicious, fluffy yet not too heavy. will definitely make it again.

I made this using peaches my brother grew and a handful of raspberries for color. My fruit was really sweet, so I used half the sugar recommended for the cake. Delicious!!! I also added some cinammon to the cake!

I made this for father's day with a few changes...I used apricot preserves instead of pears, and i switched walnuts for pecans. Bake time was only 45 min in a pyrex pan. Everyone LOVED it, and i made it again today for friends!! Great recipe!!

I agree with the others that 2+ cups of fruit is good here and you can subsitute apples and other nuts and it works well.

This is fabulous with one substitution: I used sliced almonds instead of pecans. I disagree with other raters who said to increase the topping amount. I found it to be just perfect. But I did use 2 c of pears to cover the entire surface. It rose beautifully and did not fall when removed from the oven...took 50 minutes exactly! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe which shall be added to my collection!

As usual, I had to make some substitutions for this cake to use what I had on hand. I used apples instead of pears and almonds instead of pecans. It was delicious! Even ignoring my substitutions, the texture of the cake was moist and perfect! I look forward to trying it with pears and pecans!

Rating: 3
I subbed in apples and almonds for the pears and pecans which worked fine. I agree with another reviewer that 2 cups of fruit would be better than 1 1/2 cups of fruit, but overall it was delicious! It was not super-sweet, which was fine with us.

This recipe is nearly failproof! I like using apples more than pears, you have to get really good pears to do it well. I imagine I'll try blue berries next. Double the recipe for the topping, its the best part of the cake!

I thought this coffee cake had really great flavor and texture. The pears add something very different and unique. I added extra pumpkin pie spice to the topping, and extra lemon rind to the batter for more flavor. It is quite labor intensive though. Also, for those of us spatially impaired, splitting the batter in half is more difficult than it sounds. My bottom layer was much thicker than the top!

Nice texture, nice appearance etc., but the taste was kind of dull, even though I livened up the pear pieces with a squirt of lemon juice. Maybe I should add more vanilla? Maybe the cake needs more spice (e.g., nutmeg)? Maybe I should use another fruit?

Very yummy! The pears were a great touch.

Definitely watch the pecans as you're chopping them. I processed for a few seconds too many and ended up with pecan butter. I mixed it up with enough cinnamon-flavored instant oatmeal to return it to the desired consistency, but would have preferred if my venture went as planned. Absolutely delicious nevertheless. I used ripe organic Comice pears.

I thought this coffee cake was great! I would definitely recommend using only the best, organic, sweetest pears available. Pears really stand out in this recipe and if you don't use great quality pears, the recipe will just be so-so.

This was delicious--very rich, though. The only problem I had was I didn't have enough batter for the two layers. Just managed to scrape enough. Maybe my pan was bigger than it should have been? Definitely one I'd make again.

I've made this cake a few times always with good results. I've substituted apples for the pears and added a cup of halved frozen cranberries and left out the lemon in the batter. Really good. I find you need to use a shiny pan, with a non stick pan the bottom browns a little too much.

Was fun to make and my co-workers and I loved it!!! Will absolutley make this again!

This is a perfectly nice coffee cake and I would certainly make it again. I am only giving it 2 forks though, because it really didn't blow me away. I think this recipe would be better if made with cranberries or blueberries. It needs the color and the little kick a sour fruit would give. Also, you will need closer to 2 cups fruit.

Rating: 3
I substituted apples for pears since I had them on hand. It's a tasty, simple recipe, different from the other sour cream coffee cakes I usually make. Nice change and seasonal to boot.

Rating: 3
Made the coffee cake and added 1 cup of fresh cranberries to half of the cake. Liked that part a lot better than the half that only had pears, because it added a nice zing to the cake. I love the pecan topping, but thought with the pears alone it was too sweet and not so interesting. Defeinately not enough pears, too. Next time I'll add at least 3-4 cups of cranberries and increase the amount of pears as well.

Loved it. No problems. Great taste.

This is a wonderful recipe. I changed it a bit by omitting the nuts and substituting wild blueberries for the pears. It was very well-received and it my new standard for coffee cake!

An excellent coffee cake, made it exactly as written except for only having fat free sour cream on hand. I baked it exactly fifty minutes and it was done. The lemon zest in the cake really adds a nice touch, I could see making this with other fruits as well, apples, cranberries, raisins etc. The cake is perfectly moist with a fine crumb. Really lovely recipe and easy too.
