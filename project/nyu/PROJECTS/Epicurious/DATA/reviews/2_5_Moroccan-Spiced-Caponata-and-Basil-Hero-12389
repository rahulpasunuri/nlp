I added a can of stewed tomatoes to this recipe to "snazz" it up, and ate it plain or over rice, but end up agrees with the DC cook - it's just not that good. There are much tastier ways of preparing these ingredients. I suppose, though, it would be tasty if you added a BUNCH of cheese... but anything tastes good with a bunch of cheese.

I found this to be too sweet. The flavor was not bad, but it was somehow not good either. I'd recommend trying a more traditional caponata.

Halved the recipe and it made three pretty big sandwiches - can't imagine possibly stuffing any more of this into the bread! Also added a tablespoon of olive oil and sauteed the onion, garlic and spices in it first (oil releases more flavor), and 4 ounces of cubed mozzarella cheese. Mozzarella worked really well, makes a big difference, highly recommend it. Might also try with tofu. This keeps very well in the refrigerator for several days - great for a standby. Will be making again.

We made this for a dinner party but we made it into crostini instead. It was good. Still used the basil as a garnish.

Im a college student. This tasty dish is not only easy to make, but I can make a bunch of it inexpensively and eat it for lunuches for days saving time and money. Plus its vegitarian! I also didnt use the basil though, because I thought it would overpower the dish and fresh basil is too expensive for its role in this dish in my opinion.

I served this as a side dish, not as a sandwich at a African theme party. It was made several days in advance and chilled. The smell coming from the pan was heavenly! Very interesting flavors with the cinnamon and cumin. It was my favorite dish at the party. Never did figure out what to do with the basil, though. Do you put it on the sandwich directly? It just seemed a little overwhelming, so I left it out.
