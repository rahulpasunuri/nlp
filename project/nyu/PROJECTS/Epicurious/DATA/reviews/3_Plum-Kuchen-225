This recipe needs a lot of changes, although it is not without hope. I would add a tablespoon of sugar inside the dough and also for sprinkling on top. It was very sour, not sweet at all, and I could not eat a bite without frozen yogurt or dumping a ton of cinnamon sugar on top, although that may be partly due to my sour plums. Make sure to use the sweetest fruit, or use nectarines or pears, which always seem to have a better chance of tasting sweet than plums. Also, using refrigerated dough is a terrible idea. Not only is it a pre-packaged item, but there is no way to unroll it as it was not intended to be unrolled. So I had to roll it out with a rolling pin and I didn't know what size. It also would not go up the sides of the dish and kept shrinking back. I also had sogginess problems, even though I didn't pour all of the sugar mixture on top. I would suggest using only a couple of spoonfuls and then spinkling a generous amount of cinnamon sugar before baking, for which 32 minutes is plenty. I don't know if I will try this again; there also so many other better dessert recipes out there!

A very easy and tasty recipe. I would suggest baking the empty crust for a few minutes before adding the filling. The bottom turned out very soggy due to all the juices, so pre-baking it might help a bit.

This was a very easy recipe to make. Two things though -- make sure the bread dough is cold - it's easier to work with. Also, I let the fruit sit in the sugar/egg white mixture for 20 minutes (the taste was very good!) I substituted the pears for Golden delicious apples. Turned out great! Next time I'll mix the apples w/currants. Highly recommended!!!!
