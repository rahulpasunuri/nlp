I grew up with Bisquick dumplings. These were easy and delicious. Very light. They did take about 10 minutes longer to cook than specified. This rating is for the biscuits because I made my own traditional concoction for the soup part.

Used the reviewer's buttermilk dumpling recipe and did a quick brine on the chicken first. Really good and hearty. Good way to use up the legs and thighs in my freezer.

This recipe was a huge hit at our weekly dinner club. I doubled the quantities, added 4 parsnips and a fair amount of chicken demi-glace to give it more depth. I also made the dumplings recommended by other reviewers and they were fantastic. I gave it 4 forks because the recipe has evolved thanks to other's good input.

I made this in a healthy way: doubled the veggies, cut dumpling recipe in half. Used 50% whole wheat flour, and substituted 1 egg with 1/2 cup skim milk for the creme. Next time I'll try 100% whole wheat flour. This was DELICIOUS, and I can't believe it turned out to be healthy. No need for creme.

Doubled the veggies. Made half the dumpling recipe, and ***used 1 egg beaten in 1/2 cup milk with it...delicious and healthy! Oh, and I also used 50% whole wheat flour; next time will try using 100% whole wheat flour. Delicious!

I made this recipe with a few changes (prompted by reviewers who thought it was bland- thanks!). I doubled the garlic and celery leaves and added a sliced shallot to the pork. I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and herbs de provence (about 1-2 tablespoons). Also added some herbs de provence to the celery and apple saute (about 1 tablespoon). It was delicious! My husband (who's been pretty burnt out on pork lately) LOVED it- he had seconds and wanted thirds!

This was delicious! Rich, hearty, and perfect for a blustery fall evening. The only problem I had with the dumplings was that I didn't use a big enough pot, so they clumped together. Next time I'll use my 8-quart pot and add 2 cups more stock, and I think it'll be perfect.

Seattle's dumpling recipe (this took me some time to find, so I wanted to share it with you all, since several reviews reference it): The basic technique for making chicken & dumplings are accurate in most of the recipes here. To make real flour dumplings here's a basic recipe: 2 cups sifted flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 4 tablespoons shortening, 1 cup of buttermilk or soured milk. Mix together the dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening until crumbly, stir in the buttermilk taking care not to over mix. Allow to stand 5-10 minutes. Drop by rounded tablespoons into the simmering chicken. Bring back to a soft simmer, cook 10 minutes with the cover off, 10 minutes with the cover on. Remove the dumplings to a serving dish with the chicken. If you want to do herbs in the dumplings, stir any kind you like into the dry ingredients then continue. Personal choice here. If you like - and this is REAL Pennsylvania German, eat the dumplings with a little cidar vinegar sprinkled on them.

With a few changes, this is excellent! Do yourself a favor and (as so many have said), use the reviewer from Seattle's dumplings recipe. I have been making this recipe for a few years with the dumplings as written, and always thought they were okay. Last night I saw the reviews about Seattle's, made them, and they were SO much better! To the chicken portion, I add garlic, oregano, extra thyme, poultry seasoning, and peas.

This was awesome! Was skeptical at first about the dumplings since I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was great! It made the meal. Also added a cup of white wine before adding the broth. Someone commented about the yellow color of the turmeric. I actually like it. This recipe will definitely become a staple in my household.

I just used this for the dumpling recipe as I was out of the Bisquick I normally use. The dumplings dissolved and we had chicken in thick gravy....not terribly appetizing!

I even did a vegetarian one at the same time, just omitting chicken, and it was AWESOME. My husband was so impressed with this recipe.

Rating: 4
This was so easy and so quick! I made some adjustments: used leg quarters and cooked the chicken for a full 30 minutes before adding the dumplings and cooking again for 20 minutes more. It was so good in a bowl surrounded by steamed broccoli. I added only parsley flakes, thyme, salt and pepper for seasoning. It was delicious and true comfort food! It thickened beautifully and everything was cooked to perfection!

Made this recipe using stock and turkey left over from Thanksgiving and it was great! Given the wide disparity of reviews here, I think perspective cooks should note two things: 1) there are two types of pastry called 'dumplings': the first is a puffy, bready ball, and the second is a very flat, almost noodle-like pastry (a 'southern dumpling'); look to the recipe as to what you should expect. 2) any cook worth his or her salt knows that baking has much less room for improvisation and/or deviation from the recipe than cooking does, and the 'dumplings' portion of this recipe definitely qualifies as baking, so PLAY AROUND WITH IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Change the ingredients or even mess around with the dough too much, and you're going to get a lack-luster result. Follow the recipe. Expect non- Southern dumplings. Improvise with what goes into the stock (but not with what goes into the dumplings). Eat. Enjoy.

I made this recipe for the second time and it was enjoyed by all. I think the turmeric and fresh thyme really make this dish. Instead of using one chicken, cut into pieces, I used pieces that we prefer to eat which included three chicken legs and two boned in breast cut in half. The carrots werent cook enough for us so I think Id cook them a bit longer next time. Id also recommend using a coarse cornmeal as the recipe recommended for the dumplings which will give the dumplings the body they need. Id make again. Its a wonderful twist to the chicken and dumplings my grandmother made.

This was fantastic. I made the base of the recipe the evening before and refrigerated it so the prep time would be so long since I would be making it after work. Everyone loved it. The dumplings were delicious. I would have liked them to stick together just a little better but all in all I would take the fluffier texture over a heavy ball of dough any day.

This turned out well and was simple. I wasn't crazy about the yellow color caused by the tumeric, but other than that it's a fine recipe for chicken and dumplings if you need one. I usually wing it, and the results are pretty similar. Hard to mess up chicken and dumplings really...

good home style meal in one pot. seasoned with listed ingredients except thyme. instead used sprig of oregano, several bay leaves, doubled turmeric, added some smoked paprika and regular parprika. also a garlic clove.ended up simmering on low with chicken for approximately 30 minutes until fall off the bone tender. turned out well - maybe i'd make it more of soup next time. adding 4 cups of water extra.

The only thing I'd do to make this more delicious (besides adding mushrooms and peas like someone else mentioned) is to add a lot more carrots. Yum.

I dreaded making this in August, but a summer cold gripped the entire family. My daughter and I made it in stages throughout the day so we could nap and still have dinner ready on time. Prep and cooking time were short, as advertised. Flavor is easily intensified and the feel-good factor gets a 10.

Followed the dumpling part of the recipe exactly and it turned out a goopy mess. Sorry ladies, but if you have to "tweak" the recipe to make it palatable, that means the recipe failed. Very disappointed with this as the recipe has 4 forks. Perhaps one can't trust the reviews here anymore?

For the sake of experimentation, I combined some elements of another recipe and tried adding a little sherry, peas and mushrooms to the soup. And for the dumplings I added 2 tablespoons of butter and used less milk.

This simple recipe turned out great. I followed the recipe as described but left out the celery and added two small leeks. My simmering herbs were a few fresh sage leaves and thyme. I totally forgot to add the tumeric and I did double the amount of broth. For the dumplings, I added a bit of chopped fresh parsley and didn't need all the liquid. This was so delicious and my entire family loved it! All the flavor comes from the browning the chicken skin so why others left out this important process I won't understand. The dumplings were amazing!!!

My Grandma was a German dumpling making machine. However, she never recorded any of her recipes. Her sons, daughters and now grandson have been trying to recreate her recipe. This is what we have come up with and they are pretty dang good. I still feel I'm missing something. If any good German knows the secret help us out. Thanks. -- Recipe: Get a stewing hen and boil on low for 2hrs. Put 5 boullion cubes in the water. In a bowl, put 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk. Stir. You will add about 2-3 cups of regular{ not presifted flour} a little at a time and stir with a spoon in your hand. You should be able to keep the spoon upright in the batter for a few seconds if the consistency is right., You add the flour a little at a time. When you get the right consistency, take a tablespoon and drop the dough into the boiling broth. After you have dropped all the dumplings, cover and put it on low for about 10 min. Take out of the pot. Take about 3 cups of the broth and put it into a pot. Take about 2 tablespoons of flour in a small jar with hot water and shake it up. Add it to the broth. Stir constantly on low until thick. Add about 2 tablespoons of granulated chicken boullion to he broth. Now you have gravy.

This dish could be rather bland if you follow the recipe as written but it's an easy problem to fix. I roasted a chicken for more flavor and added more broth, celery and carrots as other reviewers suggested. I also put the flour in a food processor and pulsed some butter into to give it a biscuit texture. My 18-month old enjoyed it so I'm happy about that. Next time I make it will tweak it some more to give it the oomph it needs.

I love this recipe with some minor changes. I use boneless chicken shredded (if already cooked, added later) or cut into bite size pieces then browned (which works best. I love the dumplings and tho tender I haven't had a problem with mushy. They really take no time to make, very easy. I started dinner at 6 (had taken 10 minutes to chop veggies before) and was ready at 7. Teenagers loved it, had no recommended changes aside from smaller pieces of chicken.

The dumplings are to die for. This is a very hardy meal. I didn't have turmeric, but I seasoned the breading with Italian seasoning and I added rosemary into the broth. I made it with drumsticks and thighs, bone in. I think next time, to make serving easier, I will use boneless chicken breats. I also added about two cups of water with a few cubes of chicken bouillon.

My great-grandmother lived next door to me growing up and she always made soup with dumplings. This recipe is amazing and I am not a fan of chicken and dumplings. I had roasted a chicken and made broth...so I sauteed the vegetables, sprinkled with two tablespoons flour and cut the left over roasted chicken up and added it. I like that the vegetables are chunky. Didn't have a thyme spring, so I added 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme. Stopped there and tasted...still haven't added the dumplings...but made the batter earlier today. It tasted wonderful The cream gives it a buttery flavor.

This dish is w/o a doubt delicious. I will totally make this again. I followed reviews from nengels, amerkiwi & cook from San Jose. I used 1 lb each of thighs (bone in skin removed) & breast, 5 carrots, 1 lb green beans and opt for the Bisquick dumplings. After soup was done cooking I placed the dollops of dough in a separate casserole dish with a few ladles of soup and baked for 15 min at 350. Didn't have cream so I used whole milk. I have never had chicken & dumplings so I don't know how it is supposed to takes or look. Didn't matter...it was great. Thanks for all your reviews!

I can't speak for the soup, but the dumplings were exceptional. I dropped them into my homemade chix soup and simmered them, covered, for the prescribed time. The dumplings were light yet hearty. They dissolved enough to thicken my soup nicely. Seconds and thirds were had by all until every last one was devoured! NB: I was a 1/4 cup shy on the cream so I added 1/4 C buttermilk.

I used this recipe more as a guide as we don't eat much meat in our house, but it was a fantastic guide. Especially with the suggestions of you, fine reviewers! We used carrots, mushrooms, frozen peas, green beans, and onions for our veggies and added garlic, some cumin, a fair bit of dried thyme, and paprika. And of course salt and plenty of pepper. I couldn't find my turmeric so it stayed out. A couple of tablespoons of flour sprinkled over the pot thickened the broth. I followed the suggestions of many readers and cut the liquid in the dumplings to just over a cup. I started with a cup but it wasn't holding them together well enough. Another splash of cream and they were perfect. Some of the soup went into a baking dish and the dumplings were dropped in over it and put in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. This produced a breadier dumpling that I particularly enjoyed. Okay, so I used this as a loose guide. But it goes to show what an adaptable recipe this is!

Rating: 4
This was simple and delicious. I added a bag of frozen peas and waited 5 mins before adding the dumplings (to bring the heat back up from the frozen peas) and had added 5 carrots but still could have added maybe 3 more and a bag of frozen corn. I served steamed cabbage on the side but think kale or collards would have been better. The flavor of this recipe is amazingly good! 2 days later I went for left overs and someone had eaten all the dumplings

Rating: 4
This was excellent and surprisingly easy. I used 2 chicken breasts and 4 chicken thighs with bone in and skin on. I did add 2 - 3 cups more broth so the dumplings had something to cook in. Since I added more liquid I upped the thyme to 3 sprigs and used the largest bay leaf I could find. This is now on my list of favorite comfort foods.

I totally loved this dish. I am a real picky person, but loved it. I used turkey instead of chicken, and the bisquick. I doubled the simmer time for both. It was so fast & easy to make!! Bragged to my sister of this one!!!

I adore this dish. So much so that I make it from memory now. I've made it nine or ten times over the last two years, with only minor tweeks. I'm a bit more liberal with the flour, as we enjoy a thicker sauce. I use boneless, skiness chicken breasts and regular drumsticks. This allows me to impart the flavor of the dark meat and skin, but have plenty of meat to serve without running into too many bones. I'd like to think it makes the dish healthier as well. The final change that I made was to double-up on the cornmeal dumpling batter. I literally cover the entire top of the dish with batter. It takes longer to cook, but completely worth it. I also substitute Splenda for real sugar in the batter. It's just my husband and myself at home, so this dish feeds us for two days with plenty to spare. Its also a great dish for casual entertaining.

Just what I wanted for a cold winter dinner! After reading reviews I made some minor changes. I used boneless and skinless chichen breasts that I cut into bite sized pieces. I added some butternut squash to the veggies that I sauteed. Since I didn't flour the chicken, I did sprinkle two tablespoons of flour over the veggies and stirred that up and cooked it for a couple of minutes before adding maybe 1/2 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the broth. I ended up using 6 cups of broth. I cheated and used the bisquick dumplings which were ABSOLUTE HEAVEN! I made doubly sure to cook them long enough covered. They were light and airy and OMG delicious! I had seconds! Truly an easy and delicious meal! Please give this a second chance if you ran into trouble the first time, just so wonderful!

The chicken was very tender and flavorful, but the dumplings were a disaster. They ended up mush balls floating on top of the soup. I don't know if I added too much cream or what. My wife asked why I didn't just use Bisquick. I think there needs to be more herbs or spices used. Overall the dish was a little bland

Rating: 2
I thought using the whole pieces of chicken (skin, bones and all) would really impart a nice flavor and make this soup stand out from other chicken and dumplings I've made before. Alas, the broth was unimpressive and quite bland for my taste. I also found the chicken difficult to eat. Didn't enjoy the dumplings much either...

I also decreased the amount of liquid for the dumplings, decreased the amount of chicken (2 lbs of drumsticks), added a bit of spice (paprika & cayenne) to the flour dredge mixture for the chicken... Unfortunately I found this to be rather bland! The texture of the dumplings was lovely though. Maybe it's because I am seriously missing the vinegar hot sauce, but this didn't quite taste how I've had chicken and dumplings in the past. Next time, I'll add some sage or dill to the dumplings, and increase the spices

I have made this dish several times with different variations, and absolutely love it. I recommend substituting a fennel bulb for the celery; it adds a depth of flavor and tastes fantastic with the tumeric.

Love this recipe, but I only gave it three forks cause I thought that there was not enough broth for the amount of dumplings that it required. The dumplings totally soaked up all the broth and it was more of a mushy delicious mess rather than "chicken and dumplings". HOWEVER, the taste is SUPURB!!! I will definitely make it again...except I will add maybe twice the amount the recipe calls for in chicken broth.

I was skeptical about this dish, since it was from Cookie magazine, but it was amazing! I am making it again tomorrow! I added more celery and carrots, used dried thyme (large pinch worth) and boneless, skinless, chicken. The dumplings are surprisingly good, but they about triple in size. I was worried when I first put them in the pot, since it looked like they would fall apart, so I just covered it and waited for the recommended time and then peeked in. They had risen and cooked and looked beautiful. I did not mix them any more than necessary and I did use a cup or so extra broth. This will be a regular winter dish for us!

Made this for 4 people total. I am glad I bought 8 cups worth of the chicken broth, it needed all of it. I bought 3 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast at the store and used that for the chicken, it makes a LOT of chicken, and so I also needed more of the seasoned flour for browning the chicken. But the dumplings worked like a charm and it tasted AMAZING, considering the last time I had chicken and dumplings my great grandmother made them!

Rating: 4
I just made this and it came out delicious! I will most definitely make this again! I followed the recipe almost exactly except for using less liquid for the dumplings as per other reviewers. Oh I also added about 1/2 cup more water to the broth. The dumplings do suck up a lot.

This soup was delicious! The broth was super rich and full of flavor and the chicken was tender and falling off the bone. I added almost twice the chicken stock and additional carrots and celery as well as some baby potatoes. Used chicken thighs and drumsticks (skin on) which I think added to the richness of the soup. The dumplings were a bit on the heavy side (I added less liquid as a previous reviewer recommended), but I think I might have made them too big. At any rate everyone raved and I will certainly make this again. With the additional liquid and veggies this made plenty for 5 people as a main plus leftovers for 2. Served with crusty bread and some nice wine.

This is a simple dish that will make your family think you slaved away. Definitely a keeper. The trick with getting the dumplings right is to add the cream just a little bit at a time until they are sticky. If you add too much cream (like the amount suggested in the recipe), they won't set right and you'll get either mushy, wet dumplings or tough dumplings from being overmixed. If you add just a little cream at a time and then stir a little and add the dumplings in batches, you'll use about 1/2 the cream and still end up with perfect dumplings.

I made this for my book club on a cold, rainy night, and got rave reviews. Like many others here, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and upped the quantity of vegetables.

And empty bowls all around. HIGHLY recommended.

This is a wonderful recipe, with a few modifications. I roasted the chicken, skinned and deboned it, then sauted the mirepoix in the rendered fat.

perfect winter weather food! No need to use bisquick, the recipe is easy as is. Hint, could make the soup in a crock pot (slow cooker) and do the dumplings when you get home. Also, as other readers, increase you liquid, the dumplings soak up a lot. Tried once with all spice powdered instead of the tumeric, thyme. It was very nice that way too. Just individual taste in herbs.

First, to the Cook in Boston,MA...if you say "the soup isn't even simmering yet..." then it appears you put the dumpling mix in waaay too soon. Broth should be at a good simmer, nearly to boiling before adding one small dumpling at a time. It's an awesome recipe. If you read this, give it another shot. I used the Bisquick suggestion, but used 1/2 cup cornmeal to 1 cup Bisquick.

Amazing! Super Comfort food. I made this for a pot-luck on a cold & rainy night, the raves just kept coming. Modified it to suit a crowd: used legs and thighs skin on, increased carrots, onion and celery & added cubed potato & stringbeans. Added 2 c. more chix broth. Left simmering 1 hr longer. Skimmed lots of schmaltz (b/c of skin). Dumplings were amazing, too bad not more of them! Best I've made. Chicken fell off the bone, great flavor. Be sure to use a large frying/saute pan to increase surface area for dumplings, cover while cooking. A new favorite!

this is one of the best recipes I have found on epicurious! my past experience with chicken and dumplings has been pretty bad - pasty, flavorless blobs of dough and bland chicken. this is completely the opposite and redefines chicken and dumplings for me.

The dumplings are perfect and the base is a great start for Chicken soup! I used boneless chicken breast and it came out tender and delicious. A KEEPER. A must make! ENJOY.

I wanted to make matzoh ball soup tonight, but my honey ate all the matzoh. I've had *the* worst luck with dumplings in the past (lead soup sinkers), but since the weather was cold and clammy and I had already bought broth, carrots and celery I wanted to use them! Since there were only two of us, I ended up using a boneless breast and more broth and cutting the dumpling recipe in half. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead and added almost a whole XL egg (mixed in a separate bowl and added to the flour with the 1/2 & 1/2), some cracked black pepper and chopped cilantro. They were the lightest fluffiest dumplings ever! Finally, the dumpling recipe I've always dreamed of! Yeah, I dream about dumplings.

This recipe was fabulous. I used 6 cups chicken broth instead of 4 and loved that there was a little extra broth. My kids loved it, including a neighbor boy (9) who ate 3 bowls. This will be a cold day staple at our house too.

i followed other cooks advice like this: add 1 egg to the dumplings change cream to 1 cup heavy cream + 3/4 cup 2% milk add 1-2 TBL to the stock to thicken turmeric is essential, could possibly add a pinch more i forgot the thyme but it turned out fantastic; this will be a staple in my house

This recipe is awesome, and so easy! I didn't do the cornmeal in the dumplings this time, but I added some dried thyme and rosemary to the dough. Really tasty!!

Really really good, but not the best C&D recipe I've tried. I added some extra veggies (2 of each didn't quite seem enough) and used dried thyme. Also thickened with flour. Soup base was delicious. Dumplings were also really good, but tasted a little too heavy for me (and that's after I misread the measurement and added 1 1/3 c. instead of 1 3/4 c. of heavy cream). They still came out moist and tender, but just had too strong a cream aftertaste. Maybe using half and half would be a little better? Still, it was a delicious recipe.

Very, very good. I added an egg to the dumplings and used 1 cup cream, 3/4 milk (2%). Also added flour to the veggies to thicken the stock. Everyone loved it!

Really good! Used 1 c. cream and 3/4 c. whole milk b/c that's all I had on hand and it was still great. Added a little poultry seasoning for good measure. Dumplings took close to 20 minutes to cook all the way through.

Best Chicken and Dumplings ever! I really loved the cornmeal in the dumplings, slightly sweet and not to heavy. Done wrong cormeal dumplings can be like rocks, these were perfect! The only thing I did diffrently with the dumplings was to add an egg to the batter. They just seem to hold together better that way, and I like my dumplings a little heavier. Anyway the recipe was wonderful, I will be making it again.

Very good!! A great winter dish. I also added flour to the vegetables to thicken the soup. A parsnip and celery seed added extra flavor. I used boneless thighs and breasts and followed the recipe. Before I added the dumplings I cut the chicken into bite size pieces. It was a winner.

Awesome! The few minutes it takes to make your own dumplings with the cornmeal is well worth it. Like the others, I used boneless breasts; I also took the slow way around and cooked the veggies on low heat, covered, until tender, then finished as written. Yum!

I made this for dinner after work last week, and I loved how quick and easy it was. My husband is a very picky eater, and he gave it "four out of five" stars. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts (3) cut into pieces about 1-1.5 inches square and they were delicious! I used garlic, oregano, and white pepper instead of the spices they listed and it turned out very well. Next time I will cook the carrots for much longer, I prefer them to be almost mushy, and these were too crisp still. The dumplings as directed were yummy, not too sweet, just enough. I did have to cook them a little longer than directed to get best results though.

It is mandatory at my house, that at the first snow storm of the season, I stay inside, blast some down and dirty rock and roll, and make this recipe. I use boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks. I also add about 1/4 cup of flour with the vegetables, before adding the broth, as I like my chicken and dumplings thick, more like a stew, less like soup. Never disappoints.

Fantastic! I have never made my dumplings with cornmeal, but this was amazing and a great yellow color.

I used skinless boneless breast and thigh meat to save time. Also used the Bisquick route for the dumplings. Great winter comfort food. Would have liked a little more broth and seasoning in the dumplings. Will try it next time.

I used some leftover turkey and some chicken to make this delicious soup. I used Bisquick for the dumplings and it was a snap!
