This was possibly the best frosting I've ever made/tasted. The cake was very tasty too! Made it for someone's birthday, and the whole family was impressed!

I'm not rating this because I only made the frosting. My frosting was a light brown color, kind of the unattractive color of chocolate mixed with peanut butter. And it tasted way too sweet. One reviewer thought it might be too much powdered sugar, but I think maybe it's the corn syrup. I notice that many reviewers liked the frosting, but I did not care for it.

First time it fell. This time I followed the suggestion and used 2 eggs, 1 stick butter, 1-1/2 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 tsp soda. No falling! Icing is the best.

This frosting is excellent. It has a nice gloss. It is soft and easy to work with and has a smooth chocolate-y flavor.

First time I've had a cake fall. Looking more closely at the recipe, and comparing it to the "basic" recipe where sugar=flour (by weight) and eggs=butter (by weight) it sure seems like there is not enough structure building eggs and flour in the recipe. This recipe has 5oz flour, and over 9oz sugar. It has 2 1/2 oz eggs and 5 oz butter. With all the baking soda, the bubbles will be big. All of this points to the reason folks are having trouble with it. If I were to try again, I'd cut the sugar a to a cup, increase the flour a bit, and add at least one more egg.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this cake TWICE! Way too much batter. My first cake spilled over the pan, so I made another assuming I did something wrong, I even used a tape measure to make sure I had the right size pan. The second time I didn't pour all the batter in the pan, but it fell apart when I tried cutting it in half. I thought the icing was very sweet, but good. I will not try making this again.

re: frosting - it's WAY TOO SWEET like store-bought. i would cut the amount of sugar to 1 cup if there is a next time.

Based on the lackluster reviews for the cake, I opted to make a bittersweet chocolate cake, and just used the frosting. The frosting was amazing! I cut down the butter to one stick, and it worked fine.

As many of the previous reviews said, the cake recipe is just so-so and did fall (I think it was my first fallen cake!) But the icing is divine and would be excellent with the World's Easiest Chocolate Cake (Mississippi Mud) also on epicurious... The icing gets four forks.

We liked it. It's a nice moist chocolate cake ( you can't say that for most chocolate cakes!) A bit fussy to make...but worth it. I used two 8in cake pans (30 mins instead of 40, skipped the parchment paper) and one of the layers fell a bit. I think it's too much batter for one 9in pan!

This cake is so moist & delicious. My family loves it.

To "A Cook from Texas": Beware! Chocolate is poison to both domestic cats and dogs! The amount varies depending on how dark the chocolate is, the weight of your pet, etc., but it is indeed toxic. So no matter how much you hate this cake, don't feed it to your pet! The last thing anyone wants is to have a dessert actually kill a friend...

I made only the frosting, not the cake. The frosting is, in a word, DIVINE. I used Ghirardelli chocolate. The frosting came out perfectly and was really easy to work with, unlike many frostings with so much butter/chocolate that I've encountered. This recipe makes approximately 3-4 cups, which I found to be just enough to fill and frost a 3 layer, 9 in round cake (not a particularly tall one, however.

Everyone is right, this frosting is unbelievable. My cake sunk as well but not enough to damage anything. Still split evenly. Lots of frosting and almonds made this a lovely and easy and great looking dessert. Another keeper.

Really Yummy! Easy easy easy - everyone LOVED it!

My 12 year old daughter made this cake. I helped her only when slicing the cake in half. I used plain dental floss when it had cooled quite a bit. That seemed to help a lot. We only had one small piece fall off and we 'mended' it by using the frosting as glue.

I did not make the cake...only the mocha frosting and it was divine. I could live on the stuff. Have made it several times and everyone goes crazy for it.

After assembling this cake I decided to rate it again and say that I don't think I'd ever make it again. AS I assembled it the cake crumbled and fell apart. UGH..what a waste of time.

This is the 3rd time I've made this recipie in one 9" pan. Each time (including this one) the cake sinks. I'd quit, but it tastes great - even after it's fallen. If someone would kindly email me the cooking time for 2 9" pans, I'll try that next time. Thanks!

My mother and I made this cake, and it was great. We did bake it in 2 pans instead of one which made it a lot easier. Instead of putting the almonds on the sides, I decorated the center with them in a circular pattern. I do have a pic of the cake, if you want it.

This is a wonderful cake! I also made the mistake of cooking it in two pans and cutting the cooking time and it came out amazing. Also, you don't put the almonds on individually - just put a bunch in your hand and push them onto the sides of the cake. It's a snap. I made this cake for 3 different parties and everyone loved it!

I was checking out recipes on this site when I came across this cake. It caught my eye because of the problems associated with making it. I haven't tried it yet, but I wonder if the problem with the recipe is that there is too much fat and/or sugar for the batter to support.

I don't know but this recipe should not be on the Epicurious site...it should be on the recipe rejects site. After tasting the cake I decided it was NOT FOR ME so I tried giving it to my dog Muffy and he gently gnawed on a piece. I tell you...after it dawned on him that this cake isn't even fit for a dog...he took one whiff of it and ran. I have NEVER seen anything like it. I have never seen my dog run so fast. They say a dog is man's best friend but, after giving him a piece of this cake, I'm not so sure he considers me a friend anymore. UGH!!!

This is a wonderful recipe. The problem everyone is having is that it should be made in two cake pans and the cooking time should be less. I made the mistake of cooking it in two pans and mine came out perfect. Everyone else had the problem of the cake falling. Enjoy everyone. It's a perfect cake. Alana from Los Angeles.

I was going to try this recipe until I read the reviews. If anyone figures out what is wrong with the recipe, I'd love to know if you'd please e-mail me.

All I can say is that I'm glad it's not ME! I was seriously questioning my pastry skills with this one. My cake fell also. And, the frosting did not turn out as pictured. Mine was much lighter in color and stiff. I made it to take to work, so I kept it one layer and loaded much of the frosting in the middle to make it even across the top. It looked fabulous until you cut it. But it still tasted good. To answer the cook from Glen Ellyn, I just took a handful of almonds and pressed them against the sides.

I made this recipe twice, the flavor is good but the cake falls everytime. I used the right pan, right ingredients, right temperature and baking time. Can anybody tell me what is wrong with this recipe.

Rating: 1
I made this twice - 2 cakes each time. Not only does it fall, it exploded in the oven. Doesn't anyone from BA read these reviews? WHat's wrong with this recipe

Rating: 3
Frosting was delicious. Cake fell, but still has a nice chocolatey taste. Is there any way to put on the almonds without tediously placing them on individually? Also almonds should be medium/well toasted to have a taste effect against all that chocolate frosting.

What is wrong with this recipe? I have made it 4 times thinking I was doing something wrong. The cake sinks every time. The frosting is good.
