I've been making this to rave reviews since I found it in the cookbook I borrowed from a neighbor about twelve years ago. Unfortunately, there's a typo with the 5 minute cooking time, but it does say to cook the wings until golden brown. These are great as part of a summer tapas party.

I have been making this recipe since 1999 and is one of my all time favorites. Always a crowd pleaser and a nice alternative to buffalo style wings. You can tweak this many ways. Sriracha sauce adds a nice kick!

This was the worst recipe I've made in a long time. The flavors were "off".

Great little recipe. It's very easy and is a nice change from hot wings, indeed, a great summer dish.

This sounded interesting, but I can't bring myself to bite into a big, possibly undercooked, piece of chicken. No recipe is so good that I'll risk salmonella for it!

I have been making this recipe from the thrill of the grill for a long time. It's easy to make and always gets great reviews.
