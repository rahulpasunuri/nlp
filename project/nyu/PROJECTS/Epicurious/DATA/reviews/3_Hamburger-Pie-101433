I was skeptical about this receipe. I used unsalted (low sodium) canned beans and added a little bit of chipotle beans I had left over. Sprinkled a little montery jack on top of the potatoes. My 12 year old son absolutely loved this. Other than the hi sodium of the tomato soup, this was great easy meal. I will definitely make it again.

OMG this recipe sounds horrible. To make it complete, use frozen mashed potatoes instead of fussing to make your own. And sub in condensed cream of tomato soup. Be sure to add the juice from the can of green beans. And plenty of salt, couple of teaspoons at least. Top with a healthy grating of cheese, 2 cups at least. I suggest Velveeta.

I was raised in a very poor family, and this was a WEEKLY dish my mother made for us, using this exact recipe......For those of you who are subbing the soups and opting to use multiple veggies, this makes it a Shepherds Pie, not Hamburger Pie. To this day I still make this dish (in fact I'm making it tonight). I have over the years jazzed it up a bit. I add chopped bacon, sour cream, and butter to the potatoes, to the meat I season it with French Onion Soup Mix (flavors it perfectly), and I add on Sharp Cheddar Cheese (shredded) to the top during the last 10 minutes of baking. Occasionally I'll add in French's Fried Onions (cheddar flavor) with the soup, beef and green beans for added flavor and texture. Other than that, i make it as the recipe indicates and it's wonderful. A great comfort food for me when I'm feeling homesick!

This recipe comes from an old Better Homes and Gardens cook book. I tried it without the grean beans and instead had a side salad with it. It came out great! I also used potato flakes (4 servings) instead of taking the time to mash the potatoes. Great leftovers too!!

My children are mutiny-ing (is that even a word? mutinizing?). Definitely will NOT make again. Agree with the reviewer who suggested crushed Doritos on top make this "all-American."

Very easy and very good, added extra seasonings and garlic and the result was very tasty.

This recipe was easy to throw together! A few adjustments -- I used ground turkey and it worked beautifully. I also skipped the egg in the potatoes and added corn and sliced mushrooms along with the green beans. Hamburger pie is my boyfriend's favorite dish, and this version lived up to his expectations!

this is a dish my mom made too. although Tazewell review...cream of mushroom soup! Nooooooooo! That is is different dish - NOT hamburger pie.

My husband and I were hesitant at first because it looked like a mess, but the taste was very good. I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the tomato soup, but I added a can of drained, Italian-style diced tomatoes. It was quite tasty.

Like most others, I adjusted this recipe based on what I had in the pantry. I used lots of garlic, tomato soup, creamed corn, cheddar cheese and gussied up my taters with some sour cream and butter. I made it an hour or two ahead of time as the kids allowed me time at that point and let everything cool and then assembled it so the cheese wouldn't melt, put it in the fridge, and then thirty minutes before hubby arrived home I put it in the oven. For that matter, you could do it in the morning before you left for work. It does need a little extra time when it's cold..about 45 min. Any busy mom can appreciate the chaos of the six o'clock hour and this saved me. I even got to enjoy a glass of wine while dinner was cooking! It turned out suprisingly good. It reminded me of my mom's hamburger soup. I will make this again for sure. Quick and easy.

The addition of some poured ketchup on top, and perhaps some crushed Doritos or potato chips would explain the level of obesity in this country.

This was a good everyday meal. I would make this dish again, but probably with a few changes, like some butter in the mashed potatoes for flavor and a little more seasoning.

My husband is Latino, so I added some Goya adobo,sofrito and sazon. I did not add the green beans, but when I baked the recipe I added some french fried onions(the cheese flavored) to the top. Good easy meal.

This is a standby at our house. I use a can of white corn instead of the green beans, also I use some cumin and cilantro in the ground beef mixture. I cook once a month, so this is great you can brown 4 lbs. of meat at once, divide it into plastic bags, add one can of soup and one can of corn to each bag and mix. I freeze the meat mix and keep instant mashed in the pantry. I also put a layer of sharp shedded cheddar under and over the mashed layer. YUM!

This was okay... I think I'd rather just have a hamburger patty with mashed potatoes on the side.

I make this without the potato, soup or greenbeans. This has been in my family for years and DOES taste good. All you do is brown the Hamburg with some onions. Mix together eggs and cottage cheese. Put the meat in the pie shell, and cover with egg/cottage cheese mixute. top with dill and bake. much MUCH better than the recipe suggesed here

I made it with a few essential changes. 1) subsituted frozen corn for green beens 2) subsituted "rotel" chopped tomatoes and peppers for the tomatoe soup 3) added a little cheese to the mashed potatoes WOW very good

trade the beans in for fresh peas and a hard boiled egg chopped, and omit the tomato soup..then it is shepards pie if you use ground lamb instead of beef..

Wow this was real easy to make and taste really good sometimes fusion cooking and making a recipe out of 20 ingrediants is just too hard and going back to comfory food just feels and taste right. I followed other reviewers (as always) and added 4 cloves of garlic along with my onion I then skipped the green beans and used frozen mixed veggies and then added some smokey marniade by Knorr to jazz it up abit (I have just moved and can not find worchister sauce in the boxes yet LOL My family loved this Of and I added garlic to mashed potates and sour cream and cream cheese I got that recipe from the silver palate cookbook and that is how I always do mashed potates great big spoonfuls mashed in with cram and butter NOT FOR LOW FAT DIETS BUT WELL........:)

After reading comments that the recipe needed more seasoning I added worchester and soy sauce while cooking the hambuger.

Yum! Take the advice already given on this dish, and spice it up a bit. Along with some of the other suggestions I used a little cooking sherry in the beef. But the best substitution was to use condensed Tomato Bisque soup instead of regular tomato. Try it with the bisque and you wont have to worry about having leftovers :-)!!

Excellent comfort food. I did make a few modifications, though: I added red wine and oregano to the beef, and parmesan and roasted garlic to the potato topping. Not quite in the same spirit as mom's, but quite good.

Too bland. I should have made hamburgers with a side of potatoes. It would have tasted better and my two children might have had seconds. Nobody touched the leftovers.

Rating: 0
Although this was okay, if you add a can of creamed corn over the hamburger, it's better. Also, if you add several (8-9 is better) large cloves of garlic and a heaping handful of chopped up carrots to your potato water five minutes before you add the potatoes, you will have a delicious and pretty topping for the pie. Good way to get kids to eat cooked carrots. Leave out the mushroom soup - the creamed corn makes just the right consistency.

This recipe was very tasty. I replace the beans with corn and I also used instant mashed potatoes. It was like meatloaf, mashed potatoes and corn all in one. I will definitely make this again.

I have altogether different memories of this recipe than the author. It was my all-time favorite. After I grew up and left home for college, it was something I made often, just for myself. I discovered early on that frozen green beans work very well as do instant mashed potatoes in a pinch. I also add fresh garlic on occasion. I make it for my family now. Another generation learns to appreciate the simple things in life. (My mother still has that same cook book.)

This dish is yummy in the way that road-side diners and cafeterias are yummy. Nothing gourmet, but hits the spot, and a sure-fire win with the preschool set. I used tomato sauce instead of soup, and slices of cheddar cheese on top.

I made this dish last night for some friends and it was a big hit! I used 'cream of mushroom' soup and french cut green beans. I also added a tablespoon or so of worcestershire sauce to the beef,bean and soup mixture for added flavor and topped it off with shredded cheese before the mashed pototoes. A definite do. I also jazzed up the potatoes with garlic and French's french fried onions (the stuff you use for green bean casserole). Serve this with a nice salad and fresh bread. Everyone asked for seconds and thirds.

Easy, tasty, good old-fashioned meal. I followed the recipe but added a can of tomatoes and random spices :) I didn't know what to add so I actually mixed in some curry, jamaican all-spice, soy sauce and seasoned salt. Sounds weird but tasted great.

I loved this dish!! Even my super-picky boyfriend loved it. I thought it was a great disguise for green beans, which the boyfriend hates. I did a combination of everyone's advice by using one can of low fat cream of mushroom soup, half a can of diced tomatos, and frozen green beans. After placing all of that in the casserole dish, I sprinkled a layer of cheddar cheese over it then added the mashed potatoes. Marvelous flavor and texture. This is going to be a regular in our house!
