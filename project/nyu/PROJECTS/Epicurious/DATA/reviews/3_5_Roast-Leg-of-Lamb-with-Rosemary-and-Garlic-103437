Amazing! My husband added a teaspoon of champignon foud and a teaspoon of sherry to the rub and it made a huge difference (more depth to the flavor), truly the best lamb we have ever had! At our dinner party everyone was raving and asking for the recipe!

This was really good, but I too had to look elsewhere on line for roasting times. I had a 3.5 lb boneless leg. Roasted btwn 325 and 350 for about an hour and 20 min. More done than I'd like, but my guests were happier. My 80-something mother had three helpings.

Grisby again. The problem with this recipe is that the ingredient list neglects to specify wether or not the (weight of) lamb was bone-in. Any joint of meat will cook differently OFF the bone, or if it is boned and tied, etc. Shame on the editor for not catching that one!!! I'm sure it confused many cooks when the meat came out of the oven "blue".

This recipe is very nice, but I grew up with Roast Lamb on many Sundays, and I prefer a more traditional approach. Forget the lemon and go for a thick blanket of dijon with garlic and rosemary spears piercing the skin. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! :) As well as flavour this helps to keep in the moisture and keep it tender. Enjoy!

I made this with lamb chops instead... It was pretty good. The lamb came out really tender, with a mild flavor. I like meats with a little more kick to em... I might add extra garlic and rosemary next time.

this recipe produced the most flavorful lamb i have ever tasted---although i did make some changes. last time i used a simple rub, i felt the flavor didn't permeate the meat enough; so this time i made a paste. i combined 7 cloves of garlic, 3 tbls rosemary, just a hint of cumin, the lemon zest and as much olive oil as was needed to my small bullet blender, until it came out to a thick green paste, which i then spread all over the salted lamb. i let this sit over night, and the next day, i scraped off the excess paste, leaving just a little on, and transfered to a roasting pan. i then sprinkled the lamb with more oil and lemon juice. it was delicious. superb. i used a syrah with the pan juices to make an exquisite sauce and even my father--who HATES lamb--had seconds. i had a 7 lb leg for 10 people, and there were NO leftovers. as for the cooking time, i simply did the "20 mins per pound" i found in The Cooks Bible, and it worked well. served with chive and garlic mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, and french lentils for a truley memorable easter dinner.

Brought to a multi-cultural crowd at a church supper. Success! The only change from the recipe was that I marinated it overnight. Thanks to a previous reviewer for her cooking times. Twenty minutes per pound, from room temperature, was perfect.

I tried this recipe on Easter Sunday using a 7 lb, bone-in leg of lamb &, like "A Cook from Milwaukee, WI on 04/11/04", it took about 2 hours. I only gave the recipe 3 out of 4 forks because although the it was easy & the result was delicious, I used it as a basic guide since I could see immediately that "1 hours" is a typo. So here's what I did: Roast lamb at 20 mins per lb, then let the roast stand on a platter, as the recipe indicates. This made a medium to medium-rare lamb w an internal temp of 150°F aprox. I roasted the lamb at 400°F for 15 mins, then reduced the oven to 350°F for the remainder of the cooking time. This seared the outside & created a nice crust. I used 6 cloves of garlic, since as a Sicilian, I consider 1 clove to be laughable. I didn't bother to reduce the pan juices - it wasn't necessary. I hope my post helps anyone looking for a new take on an already excellent recipe & Happy cooking!

This was wonderfully easy (I made the rub the night before, and refrigerated the lamb with it on, for added flavor), and really, really good. I'll definitely do this one again. The only part I omitted was the deglazing of the pan. The juices on the platter were perfect without any addition. It took nearly 2 hours for my room temperature, nearly 6 lb. bone-in leg to get to 130, and in retrospect, I could have roasted it a little longer, as I like my lamb a little more well done. At this temp it was still quite pink in the center, but quite good nonetheless.

Now, now. No name calling. None of us were born knowing how long to cook a leg of lamb. To those wondering about cooking times: A five pound leg of lamb takes approximately 1 1/2 hours to cook. It might help to think of it this way: the starting temperature of the meat (maybe 40 F) and the ending temperature of the meat (about 135 F) for medium rare. You need to raise 5 lbs by 90 degrees F. Figure one minute of cooking time for each degree of temperature, or, the old rule of thumb, 18 minutes per pound. The trouble is, there are so many variables: is the meat whole or butterflied, bone in or not, how cold is your refrigerator or how long has the meat sat at room temperature or how hot your oven. The easiest solution, estimate 18 minutes per pound in a 350 oven and use a meat thermometer. Remember the meat will rise in temperature about 8-10 degrees while it rests. You can fudge a little when you carve; separate rare from well done and let folks choose the way the like it best. (Another tip, take a few minutes to make a wee chart of doneness lamb, rare, 135, beef, well done, 150, etc.)

I'm not the best cook but, this is super easy to do and yields the most delicious results. I double the herb rub for extra flavour. Fantastic and makes really great lamb and mango chutney sandwiches the next day. You won't be sorry.

The best word I can think of to describe this is luscious. I've made this a couple of times, and the second time I didn't serve it for a meal. Instead, I thin sliced it and used it for those little between-meal treats with some garlic-dill spread (homemade) or some English mustard. That way I got to enjoy it for almost a week!! Incidentally, the cooking times vary so much because the actual accuracy of the oven temps vary. I had mine tested when I bought it, and the oven was off by 60 degrees! If it is taking alot longer to cook than the hour directed, you can buy an inexpensive tester and check your oven temperature accuracy yourself. If it is off, you sure want to know about it!

This was my first time roasting husband and guest could not stop eating it. I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dried and it was still amazing. I cooked it to 170 degrees which to most standards may have been too much but my meat thermometer doesn't even register as low as 130. Next time I will try cooking it a little less

Very subtle flavorings contribute to an amazing lamb. Easy beyond belief and so tasty. I would have never guessed that something so simple would be so good. Our house guest ate away the leftovers before we could even get to them!!

Very very tasty. I used a boneless leg of lamb (about 3-4 pounds) and it took about an hour to cook to 130 degrees. Very simple and very easy!

Delicious, I served this to a dinner party of 10 who were stunned at how tender this lamb was. A leg this size did need to cook for ~2hours for a delicous pink and juicy center.

We made this at Easter and it was unbeliveable...We all loved it,including my parents ( which is pretty amazing when you consider they are British and change is hard to accept!!!) WE will have this again & again..

What a great, easy recipe. Made this for a Passover seder and it garnered rave reviews. Followed the recipe pretty closely, adjusting amounts for a slightly larger leg of lamb. All told, took about 15 miutes of prep and minimal cleanup. This will have to go into the repetoire.

This is incredibly delicious. I did as the previous reader suggested and added extra garlic and marinated overnight. Very tender! The cooking time does not seem accurate thought. My lamb was just under 7 lbs. and took 2 hrs/40 minutes. Worth the wait!

This recipe is terrific. I used extra garlic, dried rosemary and the lemon zest adds a wonderful flavor. A big hit! I put on the herbs and oil the night before my party, then preset the oven to cook for 1 1/2 hours to serve at a lunch. I did find it took almost two hours to cook to med-rare for a 7 1/2 lb leg of lamb.

I made this for my first Easter dinner....it was great. My dad, who loves lamb, said this was the best he'd ever had...delicious and very very tender. I added some grated orange rind for a different twist. Full of flavor!

I have made this several times for company-eeryone loves it. I use a 'de-boned' leg. I put the herbs, fresh garlic and slices of fresh oranges and lemons in the meat then roll and tie. I let it marinate at least 24 hrs. w/ a bit of red wine. I also use the herb for a rub on the outside of the roast. The pan juices beg for roasted garlic mashed potatoes! I am making this again tomorrow night for a dinner party.

The lamb was fabulous. I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to the rub. I also read in one of the reviews that the recipe did not yield much pan juices, and I agree. I added half and half of chicken and beef broth along with a little red wine with the lamb drippings. The au jus was very good.

We loved this simple recipe. For those who are bothered by the cooking times. I roasted a 3.5 lb. boneless leg of lamb for 55 minutes and the meat was medium. Next time I will marinate the meat for at least 2 hours and roast it for 45 minutes, but even medium the meat was excellent. During cooking, the meat thermometer wasn't well placed. After removal, a meaty spot was found and confirmed that the meat was cooked.

Normally the stuff I make is strictly amateur - home fries, pasta. Then I had the idea of making this recipe with vegetarian lamb! I used White Wave brand seitan (which comes from wheat, strangely enough, but tastes quite meaty) and served it with some potatoes, and it was a HUGE hit. A friend of mine tasted it and told me I had to bring it to a "food party" she wants to have for her "friends who cook" :)

I thought it was an elegantly simple recipe; not rare spices for lamb but nicely put together. For the comments regarding time to cook--get real. Ever heard of a meat thermometer? There are common suggestions for mins. per pound in every cookbook. What babies.

We love lamb (in Australia)and especially with garlic. Rubbing it over the lamb was a change from my usual preparation (making slits and inserting under the skin with small sprig of rosemary). Definately a favourite in our house.

I cannot rate the lamb recipe since they did not give an estimated cooking time for the leg of lamb...
