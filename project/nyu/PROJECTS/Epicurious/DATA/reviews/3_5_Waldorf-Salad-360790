Remember that this is NOT a fruit salad. A waldorf is a waldorf. Classic. Try yogurt and a touch of honey instead. The pic does not show the mayo. I personally think that mayo can just ruin it.

This was fab. I did read the reviews and I tweaked the recipe just a bit based on the previous reviews. Instead of grapes, I used red currants b/c I made this for Christmas dinner and the grocery store had gorgeous currants sitting next to the grapes. I had to have them. They were beautiful and had a nice tart-sweet flavor. For the dressing I did 1/3 sour cream, 1/3 mayo, and 1/3 vanilla yogurt (a couple of spoonfuls of each). Once I tossed it all together I let it chill for a little. I served this by putting a couple of spoonfuls of the salad over a baby greens/mesclun lettuce mix. This is a great basic recipe that I think offers a lot of flexibility, so you can take it whatever direction you like.

Made this for my two year old son and his friend of the same age. Did not add the marshmallow as it seems like unneccesary processed sugar when the salad is sweet enough on its own. I tossed the apples in lemon juice before adding the dressing to stop the browning process, and to add some kick as well. Did add a very small drop of honey to dressing and left out the waluts for the children. I would't serve this at a dinner party, but it was good enough to keep the boys happy.

Great basic recipe. To the mayo I added a little lemon juice and 1 tbsp of sugar, dash of salt. I had forgotten how much I like Waldorf salad. Thanks for sharing another great classic. Another great way to prepare this salad is - in addition to the mayo mixture; fold in about 1/2 cup of heavy whipped cream that has been whipped

This was a big hit this christmas - my family including all the kids, gobbled this up and requested seconds. The crunchy freshness is great along side traditional christmas dinner fare, but I did omit mayo and instead used 3/4 cup blue cheese, and dressed it with a few tablespoons of olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Very delicious.

I made this for Christmas dinner to accompany pork loin, broccoli casserole, and mashed potatoes. I used pecans, since I didn't have walnuts, and used half lite sour cream/half lite mayo for the dressing. We loved it!

This recipe was a disappointment. I also regret using Granny Smith apples. There are better fruit salad recipes out there.

Try it with filberts in lieu of walnuts. Persimmons make a great seasonal substitute for apples, and this crop is the best in years.

A true classic - have had it this exact way for 50 years.

I make mine with pecans, dried cranberries instead of raisins or grapes, light sour cream instead of mayo and some freshly grated ginger for a little zest.

I make mine with vanilla yogurt  kid favourite requested for all holidays  I use green apples, green grapes  pleasing to the eye.

Sweet family history. This was our first-course every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, served on iceberg lettuce leaves. My dad would ask my mom, "Why do you only make this twice a year?" Her version included fresh lemon juice, and raisins, not grapes.

This was a tradition in our house growing up. My wifes family doesn't like mayo so I started making this with plain yogurt and a squirt of lemon juice instead. Slightly different taste but just as good IMO.

I make a similar salad with apples, almonds, celery, red onion & chickpeas. The chickpeas add some protein and round out the dish nicely. Dressing: 1/2 mayo, 1/2 plain, full-fat yogourt, squeezed 1/2 lemon, crushed dried mint and salt to taste. Enjoy!

My mom always made this in the fall. I like the dressing made with 1/2 sour cream and some maple syrup to sweeten it.

This has been a (Midwest) family favorite for many many years. I recommend trying a dressing of 1/2 mayonnaise 1/2 sour cream to lighten the taste a bit. Also the juice of half a lemon on the apples helps to keep them from turning color. Enjoy, we always do
