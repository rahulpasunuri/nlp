This was awesome. Didn't change a thing. Make sure you cook the rabbit until it wants to fall off the bone. Otherwise it can be cooked but a little tough. The flavors intensified the next day and almost tasted a little vinegary, so I would only make to consume that day or alter things if I were going to make it ahead.

This was just OK. Replaced water with white wine (half a cup) which added a bit more flavour. As a novelty tapa this would be fine, but not as a main course. Rabbit is expensive and boneless, skinless chicken thighs would have worked in this recipe.

I can see by the previous reviews that I am the ONLY person who cooked the recipe the way it was intended.It was perfection itself! We had 8 people and doubled the recipe.Everyone raved.Delicious.

This came out great. Lots of flavor. The sauce has a slightly sweet-tangy taste that really goes well with the meat. I used a smaller amount of rabbit but the same amount of vegetables and sauce as called for in the recipe (I think a larger portion of veggies to meat is healthier). I will make this again.

I just finished eating one of the best meals I've cooked from a new recipe in a long time. Used normal onion, halved cherry tomatoes, dried thyme, normal vinegar and left out the celery. Vegetables were a perfect texture despite 15 min. longer cook time and the rabbit was so tender. Paired with a light Ligurian red this was perfect. A Cabernet Franc from the Loire or a Pinot Noir on the tart side would have also been nice. Definitely will make again, for company. Fantastic flavor.

Very delicious. I used kipfler potatoes and verjuice because that was what I had in the pantry and tinned tomatoes. I cooked it covered for about 2hours. The meat just fell off the bones....I'd forgotten how nice rabbit was. Family thought is was very tasty. I wil lmake it again for certain.

It's really quite delicious. I skipped the potatoes and served it with rice instead (wife's diet). I also substituted black olives for green, 'cuz that's what I had. If you don't have a handy rabbit then turkey might work nicely; I think the taste is a little strong for chicken.

A great recipe but you don't have to use all the ingredients. For 2 people, I cut down to 1/2 large green pepper, 1 can drained tomatoes, 1 red potato, 1 white onion and 1 shallot, 12 ish olives, 2 tbs. capers, 1 large garlic clove, 1 celery. Still used 1/4 c apple cider and 1/4 c water. Stripped down and alot less costly to make, this is tangy and juicy. Really recommend with rabbit.

I made this with chicken and it was fabulous. Even better the next day. Lots of great vegetables and the vinegar adds a great taste. I used white wine vinegar, as it seemed more Sicilian. Do they even grow apples in Sicily? Next time I will definitely try a rabbit.
