So easy and delicious with a beautiful presentation. Definitely a winner.

Watch your fish closely - with a nice hot charcoal grill, they may need only about 3 minutes a side. This is ridiculously simple and offers a very high taste/effort ratio. I will never turn up fresh-looking branzini at the supermarket again.

Worked out extremely well! Was delicious. Slight change was just to augment the lemon in the Ladolemono with some lime, as I didn't have enough lemon. Had much more sauce than needed, so you can make less unless you would like to save it for other uses, which is not a bad idea. The Ladolemono is excellent.

Absolutely fantastic. Never write reviews but feel compelled to today. This was top notch - one of my favorite recipes ever. Yum. BTW to the previous poster, the magazine proportions are one to one so I think the online version is incorrect. I used 1/4 cup of each lemon and olive oil and it was perfect.

The notes to the recipe for Ladolemono call for a one-to-one ratio of acid and oil, yet the recipe calls for one-to-two ratio. Which is it? It will certainly make a difference in presenting the branzino.
