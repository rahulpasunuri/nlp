I make these cookies every year and everyone loves them. Missing from the recipe... 1.Preheat the oven to 325°F. 2.Cut the log into twenty 12-inch rounds and arrange them 2 inches apart on all sides on a parchment-lined or nonstick cookie sheet or sheets. 3.Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool the cookies on a wire rack. Also, "and cream" in the recipe means "cream the butter and sugar together in the mixer," not "add cream."

One thing I have learned about shortbread from living in many different climates, is that the differences in dryness and texture are related to differences in altitude, humidity and temperature of the environment. You may have to play with all pasty and shortbread recipes to adapt to new climates.

While a good recipe, it is incomplete. Add cream? OK where is that ingredient mentioned / how much? Cooking temp? Assume 325 - 350? Time?

I love this simple, delicious recipe and they get rave reviews across the board. A favorite is to half dip baked and cooled cookies in melted dark chocolate and then sprinkle with fresh orange zest!

I had the same problem as knh4 below with the dough being too crumbly as written and I measured carefully. I also varied the recipe by making browned butter and then chilling it to be the consistency of softened butter. The browned butter added a nice depth of flavor. I will make these again, but will change the recipe to add an extra egg yolk for a sturdier dough.

Quick & easy, but next time, I'll reduce the salt by half.

These are in no way shortbread, much less "classic shortbread". There are NO eggs in shortbread. I tried them as someone said they were more a spritz type. Not bad, I think the longer you cream the butter and then the eggs the less dry the cookie.

The recipe instructions are lacking the words "and THEN cream on medium speed with a mixer" I guess I can understand why some reviewers thought they needed to add cream because this recipe turned out too dry to hold together for me, so I added 2 extra egg yolks and a splash of water. It turned out perfect.

A great, really simple cookie recipe. Tried it by making 1/3 of the batch size, worked out fine, made the classic flavored cookies. Wanted to clarify a point in the recipe I think some of the readers are having a problem with, it's not asking you to add cream, but cream is the verb in that sentence. So, no missing info, no cream.

The shortbread this recipe makes is ok. I just made the Classic with regular sugar and it's alright. It's not very sweet and the salt taste is strong but works well. I was a little ticked at the directions suggesting I add cream that wasn't specified in the ingredients, so I winged it, kept adding throughout until I achieved a good consistency. All in all, I doubt I'd make this again. I have better shortbread recipes.

How much bloody cream? Stupid recipe

These are delicious, easy, and I will make them again. However, I would not exactly classify them as a shortbread cookie. Traditional shortbread is made of flour, sugar, salt, and butter. The egg yolks in this recipe make these cookies taste more like spritz rings than traditional shortbread. I used about half white pastry flour and half wheat pastry flour, which gave these a lovely flavor. The slight saltiness was really delicious. I served these with panna cotta and macerated plums, which made for a real crowd-pleasing dessert. These keep well; just don't underbake them. I baked them in a convection oven at 350 degrees for maybe about 16-20 minutes.

The recipe is easy to follow but for a shortbread cookie lover this is just an average cookie.

This is the best shortbread recipe I've found! Easy to make and very stable (i.e hard to mess up!). The family adored the saltier-than-usual flavour and it's become a weekend baking favourite. The recipe also holds up well to some innovations. Have added mini chocolate chips and cranberries for a fruit and choc version. About 100g of ground almonds and 1 tsp of almond essence also make a fantastic cookie (these are slightly firmer and crunchier than the butter version). Love how well the dough keeps in the freezer so I can make a fresh batch during the week!

Mmmm... I've never been a fan of shortbread. I've always thought of it as flavourless flour-y cookies that old people ate :P But these where just divine! Very much a melt-in-your-mouth experience. The flavor was subtle, but enhanced by the light fluffy texture. I'm not sure how they compare for the die-hard shortbread fan, but I thought these where fantastic! I had them both plain, and with the spice mix. I highly recommend the five-spice mix ;)

I forgot to mention that I baked these at 325 degrees for 18 mins. The slow baking process was recommended by my mother and proved to be perfect.

For a beginner baker, I found this recipe to be relatively simple. I made some slight modiications by pushing a small dent in the top of the cookie and adding a smidge of raspberry jam and a couple of almond slivers. These were a hit with family and friends. Thanks

Lighter and mealier than shortbread, but still delicious. A great way to have a cookie party though! I made two batches of dough and let guests dip and mix their own cookies. If you undercook them as drop cookies a bit they have a chewy cookie consistency. If you overcook them as cut moons from frozen dough they have a denser shortbread flavor. A good all-around cookie that is super easy to whip up. I'd suggest making several batches of dough and freezing it for different holiday parties throughout the season!

These cookies turned out lighter than I expected for a shortbread cookie, but my family and I sure loved them! I used regular salt and left out the vanilla bean simply because I didn't have one. This is one cookie I can truly say is more than the sum of it's parts. Oh, the recipe didn't specify oven temp or bake time, but 385 for 11 minutes worked for me.

I was not very impressed with these cookies. I was worried by the recipe, but the great reviews convinced me to try it. Sure enough, turned out as quite a good sugar cookie, but not very shortbread like. Perhaps I should have burned them more; the overcooked ones definitely had better texture.

hello again! well, i made another variation, and it was fantastic! before adding the flour (3 1/2 C), i added 1 1/2 C or so of crystallized ginger. i processed it with 1/4 C of the flour, shook it down from the sides, added another 1/4 C flour, and processed again until there were small bits (minced- sized). i added this mixture to the wet batter, and folded, followed by the remaining 3 C of flour. i sent about 7 dozen cookies to a family reunion yesterday (1/2 5 spice, 1/2 ginger), and everyone raved. i highly reccomend this variation-- i've already thought of two varying subsets to the ginger...will try next time.

my cupboard was a litle bare, but i was dyin' to bake, so i made a couple of changes: one stick of 50/50 butter/Smart Balance, and one cup of Smart Balance instead of all butter; 50/50 Splenda/sugar; crushed Himalayan pink salt instead of Kosher; and only the 2t vanille, no bean scrapings (no beans to be had in the cupboard). even with the changes this is a nummy cookie dough! so far, i have only baked them with 5 spice, but the double chocolate ginger is intriguing...

Cream is not an ingredient in this recipe as some other reviewers noted. I believe the word "cream" means to cream (or beat) the butter, sugar, and salt until almost smooth. Although, I think the addition of cream would make this cookie even richer and more decadent!

I'd never had shortbread before making these, so I can't compare this recipe to other shortbread cookies, although I think that a recipe's appeal to a new taster should also count toward its rating. Anyway. First, these were really easy to overcook -- I burnt or almost-burnt most of the batches. Second, I thought they were WAY too salty. Third, the texture was like sand, which, as we all know, isn't nice to chew. I made this recipe because I've been trying to make black-and-white cookies, and I read somewhere that the cookie base is shortbread -- after making this recipe, I can see that this is completely false.

What a great cookie! Not too sweet; I loved the salt (though I worried other people would think it was a mistake), and the cookie itself had a wonderful texture. The second time I made these, I dipped some in sugar and some in a mixture of crushed toffee candy and finely chopped bittersweet chocolate. Holy yum, Batman! I can imagine endless variations but the plain cookies are pretty killer on their own.

I'm stingy with the four forks rating but this recipe is eminently deserving. Loved the intense vanilla flavor (because I was using double-strength vanilla, I reduced the amount to 1 tsp plus 1/2 Tahitian vanilla bean). I considered reducing the salt but I trusted the recipe and I'm glad I did. These were the hit of our New Year's Day open house. This recipe is going into permanent rotation in my repertoire.

Made these cookies two ways - classic and five-spice. Both are delicious but be forewarned, the five-spice version yields a very unattractive cookie. I decided to stick with the classic for holiday cookie platters since I give them as gifts.

These were a great simple cookie. The Kosher salt was debated amongst diners, some thought it was too much to get a salt crystal... I thought it was a lovely cookie.

There is no better shortbread recipe than this. I first baked these for visitors from Scotland and they raved about them. I have since baked countless dozens and am constantly being hounded to bake them. They are not too sweet and the vanilla bean with the vanilla extract gives it a nice depth of flavor. The kosher salt gives it a great texture. Perfect for dipping into tea or coffee - they don't fall apart. I follow the recipe exactly and bake them plain and they are amazing. Highly recommended.

While I have not yet made this recipe, for the previous cook, the cream refered to in the instructions was a direction of what to do, not of the ingredient "cream". . . rather 'to cream'.

I'm sure this is a delicious shortbread but I made a few additions that made it even more delicious. I added some fresh orange zest, orange extract and folded in some chopped bittersweet chocolate chips. I did find one error in the recipe preparation as listed- it called for cream, but no cream was listed in the ingredient list. I searched other shortbreads that sounded similar and used 3T cream per batch and it worked well. I also spooned out and rolled the cookies into truffle sized balls, instead of using the log method as listed and it turned a tender cookie. I cooked 2 half sheet pans with 15 cookied per pan for 27 mins at 350 and yum-buttery, tender, moist. I then dipped the 1/3 of the cooled cookie in melted bittersweet chocolate and they were fabulous. Enjoy!
