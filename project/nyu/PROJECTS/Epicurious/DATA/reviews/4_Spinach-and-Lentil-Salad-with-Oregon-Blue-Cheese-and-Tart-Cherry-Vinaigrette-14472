Instead of adding the spinach, I served the lentil mixture as a lettuce wrap. Very flavorful and different.

Delicious and filling salad. I used lowly brown lentils, dried cranberries instead of cherries, and did not add the bacon; still delicious.

Delish! I substituted apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar as suggested, but added 2 Tbsp of champagne vinegar added to the lentils. And dried blueberries instead of cherries. Really tasty and will definitely make again!

This got such great reviews and we thought it was good but nothing special. Lentils don't really have any flavor. The only tart dried cherries I found had sugar as an ingredient so I didn't add the sugar.

This was quite a good salad. I used it as a cool, summer main course. I increased the lentils, used four slices of bacon, and used apple cider vinegar and cranberries at the end, as other recommended. Really, it was so so good.

I thought this salad was great. I had flipped by it numberous times in a Gourmet cookbook, but was never interested until now. I made some substitutions. I used honey instead of sugar and only 1 tbsp. I used some spinach and herb salad mix as I had it on hand. I used pancetta in place of the bacon and then some of the pan drippings in place of the olive oil. Also, I left some of the cherries uncooked and added them at the end. It was unique and delicious and my boyfriend loved it as well. Definitely would make again.

This recipe was great either despite or because of some changes I made. 1) I omitted the bacon as others have done. 2) Used apple cider vinegar. 3) Subbed dried cranberries for the cherries and only added them at the final tossing instead of cooking them into the vinaigrette.

Very good! I chopped the cherrys first, as they are quite big, and could spread them amoung more mouthfuls when chopped. Also didn't use the bacon, as was for vegetarians, and this salad still had delightful depth and flavor. Lentils are a great touch. Went to 5 stores before finally finding green, and any lentils would probably be attractive and tasty.

This is an amazing dish. I used dried cranberries & doubled the vinaigrette. My husband who doesn't care for lentils raved! I made the vinaigrette a second time & used quinoa instead of the lentils, it was outstanding! You've got to try this one, it's a keeper!

The gold standard for salads. Wonderful, balanced texture and flavor.

I could only find dried cherries -- not tart, dried cherries -- and I found the vinaigrette to be a little too sweet. I added some vinegar to it which helped, but it still could've used a bit more flavor. Otherwise, though, the salad was great.

I was a little nervous putting all of the "earthy" ingredients together in one dish but the reviews made me want to try this salad. It was GREAT! My wife and I have made it several times and It never gets wasted...leftovers get eaten the next day. The only person that didn't "like" the salad said that it was good but she doesn't like blue cheese. Then she asked for the recipe.

A hit at all parties. I agree that the lentils aren't needed, though one time I did add black beans at the last minute just for a protein element. Usually, I just serve this as a salad. I actually find that the dressing is more than sufficient and often add additional spinach. A winner.

We loved this! I used feta and omitted the bacon and used more spinach than called for. I added spiced pecans on top to add another flavor. It was beautiful and tasty.

Not sure what all the excitement is on this one. One of my favorite things to make is salad, and this one isn't worth repeating. And it even had many of my favorite ingredients--blue cheese, shallots, dried cherries/cranberries.

Every time I make this salad everyone wants the recipe. Sometimes I use feta if i dont have blue cheese. The best spinach salad I have ever had or made.

Everybody asks me for this recipe. I leave out the bacon for my vegetarian friends but otherwise I dont change a thing. Bit Big hit.

A restaurant-quality salad with a festive presentation for the holidays. I prepared the entire recipe except for the tossing the spinach and plating the lentils the morning of, and just warmed the vinaigrette before serving the salad the same evening.

A true gem. Simple to make. Beautiful and well-balanced flavors. People will be impressed. You will feel impressed with yourself.

After reading all the reviews I did run and buy the ingrdients right away for Thanksgiving. My question is... can the dressing be made a day or two ahead or does it need to be done right before serving?

Run to the store and buy all the ingredients right now and make the salad immediately when you get home. Go! Now! This is the best salad EVER.

FANTASTIC - whole family loved it. Left out the lentils because I was looking for a spinach salad dressing. Continued the vinaigrette process in the bacon skillet (duh!) after draining the grease. Served with peeled orange slices on the side (ready to eat with the salad) - looked beautiful.

A wonderful salad! I mixed the lentils in with the spinach and I used fake bacon because I am a vegetarian. It turned out great. Also, Maytag blue cheese is worth the splurge. It's so good!

Loved this salad. Unfortunately, I did not have any shallots around and subbed vidalia onions. Used a mixture of craisins and dried cherries. Will certainly make this again. Rating is actually a 3.5 forker

a wonderful salad. I used dried cranberries instead of cherries, and it worked just fine.

Best salad I've ever eaten. Used 1 c. lentils (careful not to overcook them; they really should take only 15 min. or so) and doubled the dressing. It reduces quickly, so keep an eye on it. Also added toasted pecans for a bit of crunch. Great dinner party salad; everyone raved.

This salad will become a regular for us- without the lentils. I made it the first time exactly as written and thought the lentils added nothing but an unattractive color. The second time I made it without. It was every bit as good, prettier, and easier to put together!

Tasty! I'd also double the dressing amount next time, though. Added chopped pecans and some mandarin oranges as a topping..that was good, too. Think I'd reduce the amount of lentils next time, as well. There were an awful lot of them in the salad! And yes, I also had a rough time with the oil and vinegar vapors. Guess you just have to be prepared for that!

This salad has the most complex flavors, the caramalized shallots cooked in the vinegar, the blue cheese and bacon. I absolutely love it and so do all my friends.

WOW was this yummy,i used turkey bacon and tossed everything together at the end . I also made extra dressing (1 1/2) as suggested (only adding the liquid ing.for the extra 1/2)

Rating: 4
Yum, yum, yum. Do most of prep ahead of time. Next time, I would reduce the amount of lentils by about one third to one half - personal preference, I guess. Very hearty and different.

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone raved. The blue cheese and bacon are really a nice touch. One word of caution: When cooking with the oil and vinegar, the vapors from the mixture stung my eyes terribly. I don't know if that's just me, but please be careful! I can't think of anything to recommend to avoid this problem (short of wearing a gas mask or closing your eyes and holding your breath), but I thought I should point it out.

I made this for Thanksgiving and just tossed the lentils in with the spinach etc. It was wonderful that way too. Took the advice of others with doubling the dressing and adding pecans. I did have left over dressing but it lasts a long time and is good over andy salad. EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THIS SALAD IT WAS AMAZING.

This was incredible! I thought that there was more than enough dressing. I will make this again and again.

This is a fabulous salad. We made it the first time last Thanksgiving and are planning on making it again this year. Much of the preparation should be done well in advance, but it will be well worth your time.

This is a wonderful hearty salad. Much of the preparation can be done ahead of time.

This salad is an exquisite combination of unlikely ingredients and makes an elegant addition to any meal. I suggest the addition of caramelized pecans which seem to complement the salad beautifully and provide a sweet crunch. I also omit the bacon and don't miss it at all. Like other reviewers, I agree that the viniagrette should be increased by 1/2. A must try!

I don't give many 4-fork reviews, but if any recipe deserves one, this is it! The flavors are incredible and, as I told my husband, if I tasted this in a four star restaurant I would rave about it. Fantastic!

I made this for a dinner club and a family dinner and with each bite I got oohs and ahhs and inquiries about each ingredient. Don't let the lentils throw you, they really do add a nice texture. Making 1 1/2 the vinaigrette recipe was the only change I made.

This is truley the most amazing salad I have ever tasted! I made it on my first Thanksgiving married for the whole family and it was a hit. I still get requests for this recipe and all my sisters make it all the time. The combination of tart and sweet witht he spinach is incredible!

I made this salad as part of a formal Thanksgiving dinner. Many of my guests are still talking about it, 8 months later. It was simply delicious, and has inspired me to vary it in many ways to make other delicious salad. The dressing is divine, and the marriage of flavors and textures is truly phenomenal.
