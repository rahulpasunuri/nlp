Made it yesterday for a holiday party and it was delicious! What I liked about this recipe is that it is so easy but tastes pretty complex. I added a few extra seasonings like powdered ginger, ground cloves, nutmeg. Next time I would up the ginger a bit.

I'm not reviewing after reading some of the other reviews. Try the Cranberry Walnut Tart that's on the site. It's originally from Gourmet 1990 or 1991. I usually sub pecans because I prefer them and usually have them on hand. The recipe is just so good and so easy!

I am a pretty accomplished cook, but I had a tough time with the custard. When I added the corn syrup to the melted sugar, it hardened and I couldn't get it to melt again. Second time around I melted the sugar and syrup TOGETHER. It worked better, but when I added it to the egg mixture, again it hardened . I had barely enough custard to finish the recipe. What did I do wrong? I would like to make this tart again. Everyone loved it!

Made the tart twice to try to combat the leakage issue. 1st tart leaked so much that it ruined the taste. 2nd attempt was more successful but still very difficult to extract from the tart pan with all the carmelized sugar under it. Also would cover the top to prevent the cranberries from getting so dark.

I didn't make it - I ate it! Several friends and I have an 'agreement' - when we entertain another couple - the guest couple brings dessert & the same applies to them - we bring dessert. It lightens the prep load considerably. Our guest brought this tart and it is simply superb. However she commented that it was a bit of a pain - i.e. - fussy. It wasn't too bad because she wasn't cooking the entire dinner - but.... That leads me to speculate - I wonder if it would produce a similar result if cranberries were simply added to regular, no-nonsense pecan pie? I'm going to try it one of these days and see what happens - hopefully not a disaster!

This was more delicious than I expected. I love pecan pie, but find it to be a little too sweet. The cranberries really cut the sweetness. The crust was delicious and easy to make. Note of caution, use a tray underneath when baking, sugar overflow tends to set off smoke alarms!

the cranberries stayed moist. Great recipe.

We all love pecan pie, but let's admit it: it's sometimes just a bit too sweet. I found this tart to be a nice alternative. The fact that you make the caramel before baking seems to take some of the straight sweetness off. I think it's fine as is; at the same time, I think that if you want a more intense cranberry flavor, there is definitely room for it. Overall, very nice.

I loved this recipe! It was a great variation of the butter tart. I made individual tarts as opposed to one dish. Next time I will decrease the pecans to 1 cup, and the cranberries to 3/4 cup. I had too many by using the individual tart shells.

OK, here's a tip: the FIRST thing you want to do when making this recipe is cover the bottom rack in the oven with Foil. (If you contain that sugary overflow, then you'll be fine). This was an awesome taste, and a beautiful holiday pie, too! I got a lot of compliments on the way it looked. Top with a dallop of either creme fraiche or whipped cream, and put a pecan half on top of that.

Easy to make and the cranberries add a tartness that breaks up the usual overwhelming sweetness of pecan pies. Great!

I served this for Thanksgiving and thought it was a great change from the typical super-sweet pecan pie. However, I did have the problem some other users report, of filling overflowing. Turned my oven into a big, smokey mess!

Although the caramel was delicious, I had a problem getting the tart to set. I often run into the same situation (runny filling, burnt pecans) with pecan pie. I use an oven thermometer and fresh eggs. Can anyone help?

Everyone at the table loved it and wanted the recipe. The tartness of the cranberries cut down the sweetness of the standard pecan pie/tart perfectly. I did use extra pecans and cranberries in the filling. What a hit!

I made this for Christmas Day dinner and it was fabulous. A nice contrast of sweet and tart flavors and easy to make. I used the recommended tart shell recipe with no problems. I did not knead it like instructed. The shell is thin. One problem I did have, the carmel filling seeped around the edges of the shell and it was difficult to remove the rim of the pan. I reheated the tart and that worked okay. It is an impressive holiday presentation.

The pasrty for this tart was very unforgiving. I would use a favorite tried and true pastry instead. The filling is incredible.

This tart was delicious. My husband loved it!! It's not overly sweet like some pecan pie type recipes. The caramel added a nice smooth consistency to the filling. And the cranberries were a nice contrast! I'd even serve it for Thanksgiving if everyone weren't expecting Pumpkin Pie!!

I am a chef with a few degrees and must admit I was amazed how such a simple dessert could taste. One must always use freshly shelled pecans or at least fresh as possible or any recipe will wind up being soapy. Beautiful compliment maongst the main ingredients.

No one in my family liked this tart. I liked it so little, I threw the remaining servings away.
