My pepperoni-tomato sauce-loving boyfriend proclaimed this "the best pizza in the world", and I would have to agree with him. It was INCREDIBLE. Some changes I made: using my own homemade pizza crust, omitting feta and using a blend of mozzarella, asiago, and parmesan, and throwing some prosciutto on top. Delicious. I think next time I might make more of the garlic-tomato paste, but overall it was wonderful.

Delicious! Better than the nearby pizza parlor.

This was excellent. The only changes I made were to add lots of fresh basil, some fresh tarragon, and I used a blend of asiago, parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses - Yum!

I can't rate this recipe because I took too many shortcuts, but I did want to suggest one of my shortcuts: garlic cloves can be roasted individualy and it takes only about ten minutes.

If you like bold flavors you will love this pizza. It was well worth the time it took to make it. We paired it with Lindeman's Shiraz and it made for a great Friday night with my husband. I used two heads of garlic and put those in the oven first and than sliced a large red onion and put it in a 13 X 9 baking dish. I put the basil and parsley on top of the garlic tomatoe sauce vs putting it on top which would burn the herbs. Next time I would add anchovies as another reviwer suggested and thinly sliced fresh tomatoe. My husband likes it so much he wants me to make it once a month.

This pizza was incredible and worth the amount of time it takes to make it. If you like bold flavors you will love this pizza.I roasted two heads of garlic and put them in the oven first, than sliced a large red onion and put it in a 13 X 9 baking pan. I put the basil and parsley on top of the sauce vs. adding it last because if you do this it will burn. We paired it with Lindeman's Shiraz and this made for a great in home date night for my husband and I. Next time I will add some anchovies that another reiwer suggested with some thinly sliced fresh tomatoe.

I liked it, but my husband did not. You really have to like garlic a lot to like this one - I followed the recipe and found the garlic a little overpowering.

This pizza recipe is in the regular pizza rotation at our house--I have been making this pizza for years. I always roast my own peppers--so much more flavor and it really doesn't take that much time. I have used different cheeses at times and the results are always great!!!! A real keeper!!!!

Yummy! I used parm. reggiano in place of the feta. I usually don't like sundried tomatoes, but they really were rather subtle and added a great layer of flavor. And please, in the name of all things good, use fresh basil!!

A really tasty treat! The tomato garlic paste will make a good foundation for any pizza. I love roasted garlic so I used 2 heads instead of one. I don't care for Feta cheese so I used parmesan in its place and roasted my own red bell peppers.

The flavors were ok. I thought they would have blended better. I felt the feta cheese overpowered the rest of the flavors. I'll still look for another gourmet pizza recipe.

Surprisingly good. Not a huge Feta fan, so substituted Parm. Boboli made it fast, which I liked alot. My husband who doesn't really like sun-dried tomatoes ADORED it. Ate 3/4 of the pizza himself.

Wow, this was good! I love the roasted garlic/sun-dried tomato paste idea in place of sauce. Even my sister and I, who don't really do sun-dried tomatoes, loved this pizza. Next time I will start earlier so that I have time to roast my own peppers--the jarred ones are pretty flavorless. Also, this go-around I added extra feta, and I won't do that again as it was pretty overpowering. Otherwise, a great pizza.

This pizza has been the hit of graduation parties, birthday parties, and my annual Christmas party since the first time I made it, shortly after it appeared in the magazine. It's gorgeous, delicious, and doesn't require a lot of work. It must be fab for me to turn on the oven in the summer! It's one of the most requested of recipes in my repertoire. I use a pizza crust from my local Italian market --very thin & crunchy as a base. Boboli paled in comparison.

I was a little skeptical reading all the rave reviews, but made it and MAN O MAN IS THIS PIZZA VERY, VERY GOOD! THIS IS A KEEPER OF A RECIPE! Only drawback....my waistline says I can't have this too often.

This has become the pizza recipe against which we rate all others. My son loves garlic, and my daughter loves red peppers, so this recipe crossed the gender borders quite well. This is a definite keeper!

I enjoyed this recipe. I used fresh spinach instead of the bell peppers. I recommend making fresh dough if you have the time.

"Best pizza ever" said sister. I might just have to agree, especially for homemade. I burnt the onions a little, so didn't get to use them all (keep an eye on them), and used my own roasted peppers (not from a jar). Loved the flavors! Big hit.

We loved this pizza!! We belong to a gourmet club and I would defintely serve this on a gourmet night. Instead of using the mozzarella cheese and feta, I used fresh grated parmesan and 5 year old cheddar. I also roasted my own peppers makes a big difference! It was great with a White Zinfendal wine.

Oh so yummy! Not only was it beautiful, it tasted just as good. I added chopped Kalmata olives, as I can't imagine eating feta without them, and they really added texture and flavor. Also, I baked the onions for about 40 minutes, and although I was afraid that I'd overcooked them, they got all caramalized and smoky and delicious. An absolute must try!

This pizza was a most wonderful delight to the senses... the flavour, texture, and eye appeal. This pizza was like an evening in front of a fireplace on a cold winters evening - wrapped in your favourite flannel pj's.

Loved this pizza but we will roast our own red peppers next time - red peppers from the jar had little flavor.

I brought this pizza to an appetizer party and everyone raved!! I roasted the peppers instead of using the prepackaged ones. I didn't like the cooked fresh basil, so I waited until the pizza came out of the oven to add that. This yummy easy to make pizza is a favorite in my home!!!

This was very good, although if you are roasting garlic, why not just roast the peppers too? I did roast my own...it's not like it's that hard, and it's always better than bottled. I like to sprinkle crnmeal on a cutting board and place the pizza crust in the cornmeal. It adds a nice taste and texture. Also, I used fresh basil and no parsley. (I hate parsley it has no real taste to add to anything.)

Wow! What a terrific pizza. It was delicious and had my guests licking their fingers. Well worth the preparations, this pizza is an eater's delight. Garlic lovers and roasted pepper fans will jiggle in delight. A definite show stopper. Bon apetit!!

I followed the suggestion of 2 garlic heads and will not do that again. I love garlic, but the bottled red bell peppers were lost. The combo of feta and the garlic is delicious. We also added the marinated artichoke hearts, but will not again and we added anchovies which we will use again. I roasted both white and red onions and those were also delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Wow! What a great pizza. My family raved about it. I used 2 heads of garlic which was suggested in other reviews and found it the exact right flavor. I added a cut up red pepper and cooked them with the red onion. If you like peppers you may want to try that it was perfect. I also topped it off with a few marinated artichoke hearts and it was totally awesome!! We will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made this pizza for guests, and it was a HUGE hit. I took the suggestion of using additional garlic. That was a good idea. I used two large heads, and it was perfect. One thing...I burned the onions to a crisp because I thought the 45 minute time referred to onions and garlic (I'm a novice!) I had to run to the store for more. Whoops.

Great pizza recipe. If you're a meat lover, you don't even miss the meat . I followed a couple of suggestions - used all 4 oz. of (tomato basil) feta and used 2 heads of garlic. I used the Boboli thin crust because it is sooo easy. I bought a jar of roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes but couldn't smell the garlic so didn't use it. We love garlic. Definitely use a LARGE red onion it added so much flavor.

This recipe is a keeper! We topped it with 1/2 lb. of medium-size shrimp (shell & devein fresh shrimp, put them in the microwave for a couple of min. & viola!). Next time I'll probably increase amount of sundried tomato sauce.

In place of the feta cheese try gorgonzola. Very good.

MMMM DAWGY!! This was really good! I just used a Pillsbury pizza crust in a can on my pizza stone, and added some rotisserie chicken from my local deli ( if you can call it a deli in Utah)

This recipe was easy and tasted delicious. I served it for a small party and 2 people asked for the recipe. The feta cheese adds a special zip.

This pizza not only tastes great but is pleasing to the eye as well. I happen to like meat on my pizza so I added strips of grilled Chicken after it came out of the oven, that way the chicken stays moist.

Oh wow -- this pizza was unbelievable -- my husband is still raving about it. We made our own crust, which added a little time to the baking, as well as roasting the peppers ourselves. I highly recommend this -- we are planning a pizza party in the next two weeks just so we can share this with friends.

I actually found a tampenade of roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes in a jar. Finding the right pizza crust is a factor too! I too used the basil and tomato feta cheese. This recipe has been a huge hit and I have given out 4 copies of it already. The perfect non -meating eater recipe. Try it! You'll love it!

I used tomato-basil feta instead of plain and it was delicious! Great for entertaining.

This was excellent. I substituted a pre-made crust for the pizza dough recipe also listed on this web-site, baking it according to the dough recipe on the bottom of a 550 degree oven for exactly 6 minutes. (You'll need to modify quantities slightly to accomodate a 9" pizza.)It's worth the extra effort! Try adding shredded and sauteed spinach on top of the cheese for extra color, flavor and vitamins.

I always double the feta!
