Kid-friendly yes, but for adults, just so- so. Needs more flavor somewhere. I like the review that used almond butter and soy milk, but it still needs something else - maybe chocolate chips? icing was fine, peanuts added nice crunch, be sure they are salted.

These are fine; kind of like a peanut butter cookie or muffin flavor. I later found a way to make a sublime, cake-like peanut butter cupcake with milk chocolate frosting: Google "peanut butter train cake" and bake the cake batter as 16 jumbo cupcakes. You can also find the recipe in an epicurious forum. I promise you will love it.

For me, these cupcakes turned out moist and delicious; however, I added chocolate chips to the batter so they melted within the cake and increased the taste---Did anyone else's icing turn out like a liquid glaze?

I made these for the first time last night and, given the outcome, think they've gotten a really bum rap from other reviewers. They were light and fluffy and not too sweet -- and as an added bonus, they were easy to put together. I suspect some other bakers might have over mixed them, which usually contributes to tougher, more dense cakes.

Definitely dry and dense, but not inedible. Not was I was expecting, but a nice snack nevertheless, like a very chewy bread or muffin. Not too sweet. Overall not the disaster the other reviews described. Next time I will reduce the flour.

Delicious and moist. Very userfriendly recipe. Quick, and they stay super moist for several days. I liked crunchy peanut butter for a different texture. My girlfriend demanded me to make them again tonight!

Delicious! Not dry at all! I reduced the flour to one cup based on previous reviews, and these were so moist! I even used reduced fat peanut butter. I also used white chocolate for the icing because I didn't want to overpower the peanut butter taste. Everyone at the party loved them too. I was sad that there were no leftovers the next morning.

Good- with modification. I used only 1 cup of flour and mixed in 2 tbsp of sour cream in. I also cut a few minutes off the baking time. Not spectacular, but easy with ingredients I had in the pantry.

Didn't taste that good, it wasn't moist enough.

Took advice to reduce flour; using what I had on hand, I replaced the peanut butter with almond butter, the vanilla extract with almond extract, and the milk with soy milk and it was light, moist and delicious.

I absolutely love peanut butter, but these were abominations. They were dry, almost tasteless. Please.. If you're thinking about making these, find another recipe.

I think that they make a wonderful come home and enjoy while you are relazing in your chair. I really enjoyed these and hope that if you have children that you would share them with them.

Agree with previous comments. These were dry and tasteless - almost like muffins instead of cupcakes. Frosting came out like glaze despite chilling - not like frosting. Altogether, totally unsatisfactory - who tested this recipe?

These cupcakes were so dense that they made a noise when you hit them on the sink. We ended up slicing the tops off and just eating that part, not the dry bottom. I wish it would have turned out better.

After reading other reviews I reduced the flour to 1 cup. so, it is not dry anymore. Delicious ! this recipe will remain in my recipe box.

my family is peanut butter crazy. I am not fond of it. It try to prepare "Peanut Butter sweets" so I wont be tempted. I even dislike reeses cups. My family hated these. Each ate one and said please don't make again. So bad my husband could not give away at work. I will stick to my fav pb cookie and add choc chips for a change.

I thought this recipe was delicious. It was moist, but it did not last longer than three days in my house. I also kept it in an air tight container.

What a fun easy & original recipe! Most ingredients are just sitting around the cupboards already. I thought these had a melt-in-your-mouth texture, thanks to the moisture from the peanut butter. Definitely need milk with these. Next time, I will try leaving the cream out of the topping, and spread the straight melted milk chocolate on top for more of a peanut butter cup effect. Will have a little less fat and seem more decadent anyway! This is a recipe kids could have fun with also.

Dear previous reviewer, Did you make these cupcakes? I did, and they were delish warm with a cold glass of milk. Overlook the grammatical mistakes and get in the kitchen.

Seems we have people who need help on their geography (Tashkent, is indeed in Uzbekistan), and their spelling and grammar (Mark: "too" vs. "to" - know the difference). You misspelled it "to" times! Ha ha.

Way to heavy to be a cupcake...to floury to be a cookie. Try again with some alterations to the recipe, perhaps!

Another vote for "dry". No one loved them, so I won't be making them again. Bummer, because they sounded so good.

These were very dry and bland. I tried filling the cupcakes with a peanut butter mousse and was still disappointed.

Cupcakes were too dry.

Made them for my ten year old daughter's b-day. Her favorite candy is peanut butter cups so I made a chocolate buttercream frosting (also her favorite) instead of the above frosting, stuck a peanut butter cup on top of each one and a candle in each of the candies. Piled them on a three tier tray to look like a cake. They were a big hit. They loved them. Good for kids.

not good..for real.

I was worried this recipe would be too dry because the consistency of the batter was more like that of cookie dough that cupcake batter. Unfortunately, I was right. I did use skim instead of whole milk, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. If I make them again, I'll use more liquid.

Delicious and so easy! My ganache ended up a little runny (never sed milk chocolate before but it's my husband's favorite so I thought I'd try it) but still tasted great. Great, fast and inexpensive treat!

These are absolutely THE BEST cupcakes I have ever made!!!! They aren't too sweet and the peanut butter flavor is very deep and rich. I made the dozen and they were gone in 2 days... and there's only two adults (me and my hubby) and one 6-year old here. I ate 2, the kid ate 2... so you can guess where the rest went. I came home from a day long shopping trip and they were gone! He tried to blame it on the dog but I could smell peanut butter on his breath a mile away. Don't pass these up!!!!! I'm getting ready to make 3 dozen for a birthday party.

I was disappointed with this recipe. While the cupcakes looked great they did not taste great. They were very dry.

Rating: 3
These are very sophisticated cupcakes. I accidently used a whole stick of butter, and they were still great. I just made them richer and more fattening. I will try again with the correct butter! My husband raved! Thank goodness or I would have had to eat all of them by myself!

A deliciously moist cake that appealed to the grown ups as well as the kids!
