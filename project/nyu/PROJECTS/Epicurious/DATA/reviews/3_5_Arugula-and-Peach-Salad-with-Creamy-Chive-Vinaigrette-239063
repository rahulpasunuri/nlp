Very tasty. Had no whipping cream so used plain yougurt for dressing. Gave it a nice tang.

This salad was a snap to make but didn't wow my guests. The oily dressing lacked flavor and did not enhance the peaches or arugula.

This is a keeper. Per other reviews, I did macerate the peaches in lemon juice for abt 15min. I added red pepper flakes to spice it but a bit. I will definitely make it again.

I just made this salad for the second time. I didn't have any chives or whipping cream, so I just made it with arugula, peaches with the lemon juice (I let them sit in the lemon juice for awhile), raspberries, salt and pepper, and olive oil, and it was AMAZING! Maybe better than the original recipe. YUM

I hemmed and hawed about making this recipe, and I was pleasantly surprised; it was excellent. Tips: only use really fresh ripe peaches. Do add salt and pepper, but not too much. The dressing is delicate (not bland, as other reviewers describe). I did not add the lemon juice to the peaches. I used red leaf lettuce instead of arugula.

oh yea...i added marcona almonds and a little bit of grated pecorino romano to my salad...i think that added more depth to it. also i didn't use as much lemon juice. my first test batch of the dressing was a little too lemony. but otherwise it was a good lunch!

This is great for summer when peaches are in season. Subbed spinach for arugula. Maybe those who said the dressing was bland didn't season with S&P. I thought the dressing was awesome as written.

I don't know why people rate this recipe so poorly because it was a big hit with my family. I made it at the height of summer when the peaches were excellent, and I got compliments from everyone for the chive dressing. I did add some honey to the dressing to give it a bit of sweetness, but it was really a great salad on its own.

Would not make this dressing again, unless I wanted a challenge. It was too bland. I was at a loss to how to fix it. I would make the salad, just trying another dressing.

Although very colorful, this was good but not great. Followed a previous suggestion and added some goat cheese. Could benefit from some toasted pine nuts or walnuts.

This has been my go-to salad recipe since last summer. I've also made it with strawberries instead of peaches, and with mesclun instead of just arugula. I've also omitted the cream to make it healthier.

This was very dull.

I loved this, but only with some modifications to the dressing to cut down on the lemony taste. I added some red wine vinegar, a little sugar and salt and pepper and increased the whipping cream by a little bit. Now THAT was good.

The Dressing was too lemony. It overpowered the ingredients in the salad

Rating: 2
I'm only giving this one a 2, but my hubby would likely give it a higher grade. I found the chives too over powering. I added a pinch of sugar as well to try to balance out the dressing a bit more. He loved it but I won't make this one again [sorry, honey].

I added a small bit of honey to the dressing. Nice. With goat cheese, this salad rates four stars!

So good and incredibly easy. This goes together in a few minutes. I made it with the Tequila chicken from Bon Appetit. A fabulous meal!

All of my dinner guests loved this and it couldn't have been easier! On it's own, I did not care for the flavor of the dressing - very sour due to the lemon juice. But once everything was combined, it was really wonderful.

Yum. When peaches are in season and juicy, you can't do better than this.

Had the August Bon Apetit with us on vacation. While flipping though it on the beach, I thought this recipe looked good. So, I gave it a go. Our vacation group gave it a hearty thumbs up. I added goat cheese for a bit more dimension. It was a great addition! The peaches, the cheese and the dressing were a great combo. Added lots of fresh ground black pepper for a bit of zip. Stood up well to our pasta & seafood meal.

Beautiful presentation. I used white peaches. I thought the dressing was a little bland, and it was a lot of dressing. I've used it with regular salad greens since then, and it is not as overpowered. Arugula has a more distinct flavor and the delicate dressing is overpowered.

I substituted nectarines for the peaches and I added a little bit of sweetner. It was wonderful. This is a perfect summertime salad.

A very simple, very elegant show-stopper. Changed nothing, and it was magnificent.
