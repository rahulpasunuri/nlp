So easy and absolutely delicious. Made this with my New Year's blackeye pea leftovers (which were cooked with ham and veggies and stored in the freezer). Added a pinch of cumin, and put half the cheddar in the dip rather than on top... a classy and flavorful version of retro party food!

I was looking for something to help use up leftovers in the fridge and a can of black eyed peas in the cupboard. I took the suggestion of another cook and cut back on the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and kept the chilli powder. I added to the bean mix a handful each of fresh flat leaf parsley and coriander as well as the white part of the green onion. It was a really dense dip so I added a bit of water as it was mixing in the food processor. I also had a little fajita mix (onions and bell peppers)left and threw that on top of the bean mix after it was in the pie plate but before adding the shredded cheese. More like a casserole than a dip but it satisfied my need for comfort food

This was tasty--made it for New Year's Day to get the requisite black-eyed peas covered. I will do this again, but I'll definitely cut the cayenne to about 1/4 tsp. Way too spicy, even for us who like it with some kick.

oh also we tend to be lazy and use canned peas just one can of 15.5 oz. works just fine ... don't think i have ever tried it with the dried ones just yet

My family and i have made this every year for the past 10 years or so every new years eve is a must seeing as how it is supposed to bring you good luck in the new year. This is so yummy and delicious sometimes we can;t finish the whole thing so reheating is just fine! oh and i am not sure if the recipe is written wrong or what but we always put both cayenne pepper and chili powder

What am I missing here? when do you add the cheddar cheese? The recipe says to add garlic and next 3 ingredients which would include the cheddar cheese, then you are supposed to put the cheddar on top. I used the cheese in both places and I added a lot more cayenne pepper, it was nice and spicy.

I made this on New Year's day because you have to have black-eyed peas on the first day of the new year to have good luck (old southern tradition). This is a nice way to dress up a bean that's otherwise dull. This recipe has a great kick to it and the cheese makes it perfectly!!! I will definitely make this again next year!!!

Easy and really good. Liked the spicy flavor. I accidentally put the green onions on top before it went in the oven but it wasn't a problem. We'll definately make this again!

I had never made anything with black-eyed peas before, so this was a little bit of an adventure for me. It was easy and tasted great. I made it for a party and most people liked it a lot. In taste, it is almost indistinguishable from the usual refried beans you get in Mexican restaurants.

Really nice recipe, especially for black-eyed peas. I processed the scallions with the other ingredients to include in baking. A very delicious turnout, indeed!

Prepared it for a "nacho bar" with Chipotle Dip and Avocado & White Bean salsa. I microwaved it immediately before serving rather than baking it. No complaints.
