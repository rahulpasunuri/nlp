These cookies needed a lot more lemon flavor, otherwise they were tasty. I actually served them with lemon curd and that really did the trick.

These cookies are delicious. Not overly sweet and the toasted coconut adds great texture. We will definitely make this again.

YUMMY! I added the juice of one lemon for a tangy lemon hit, which worked well. Next time I'd: Double the lemon zest (using tasty Meyer lemons) instead of using lemon extract (tasted too fake) Increase the butter 25 - 50grams - the final cookie was a little dry. I was surprised not to have to add extra flour with the extra lemon juice. Mix the coconut in at the same time as the flour. Doing it afterwards meant too much handling of the dough. I think with a bit of tweeking this will be a favourite

while these cookies have a nice, light texture and flavor, I and all my "tasters" only taste the coconut, even after having followed other reviewers' advice to increase the lemon extract. since I'm serving these for a party, I think I'm going to either sandwich them with lemon curd or drizzle them with a lemon icing. i also agree that the confectioners sugar at the end doesn't do it for me - I took one bite and shook off as much as I could from the rest of the cookies.

I love lemon and I love coconut but the logs were quite crumbly and the cookies turned out dry and unattractive. I made them exactly as directed but was hoping for better results.

These melt-in-your-mouth buttery gems truly deserve "4-forks". Not the prettiest cookie on the plate, so everyone was so surprised by this lightly lemoned coconut shortbread style cookie. Held up well in the cookie tin over the course of a week. I followed the recipe exactly but didn't feel the second dose of 10X sugar was necessary. Perfect for dunking into a hot cup of tea!

Easy to make and they tasted fresh for 5 days.

Since 1999, I've wanted to make these for a friend that likes all things lemon and/or coconut. Finally made them this year for her - they were delicious - we both loved them. A lovely melt-in-your-mouth tender shortbread type cookie.

Needed a little more lemon flavor (surprisingly so!). I rolled the logs in lemon juice and then in shredded coconut, then sliced. Just be careful not to burn the coconut...browning is good!
