This recipe was quite easy to make. It needs to sit with the taragon so make it the day before. I served my soup in a class bowl and used the vegetable confetti in a garnish that sat on top of the soup. I also put some watered down sour cream in a squirt bottle and used that in the design. My guests loved this soup so that in itself gives it four forks. It is very easy to make, too, if you use canned tomatoes, which I did. I used Hunt's canned tomatoes. The presentation, tho, is what I think sells this soup. Bring it to the table and ladle it out with a glass ladle.

I have been using this site for recipes for over a year, this is the first time I have been disappointed. This recipe was easy to make however it had no flavour.
