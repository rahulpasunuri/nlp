after reading reviews, i thought these wings would be really good, but imo, they aren't all that great. didn't like the flavor the marinade gave the meat and sure didn't like the sauce. won't be making this again.

i marinated the wings in yogurt & all the marinade spices (i used twice the amount) over night & also added a couple of green chilis & some fresh ginger. i cooked them covered with the mixture, which resulted in delicious but non-crispy wings. for the sauce i used fresh cashews & ground them with some olive oil. i don't think the sauce is necessary at all.

I've been making this recipe since it appeared in the magazine in 1992 - and it is indeed a staple. Will be making it again for a party tomorrow. I disagree with the reviewers about the sauce - it's a key to add complexity and surprise to this dish. The sweetness of the coconut, red pepper and PB are offest by the spiciness in both the wings and sauce. There aren't too many dishes that combine these elements so well. True - the wings alone are quite good. But's that's only half the full effect.

agree that the dipping sauce is a taste overkill. the wings are good enough alone. i also baked them, then poured off the fat and broiled them to crisp. not sure why you needed to mince and mash garlic and shallots with the salt to make a paste. i just throw all the marinade ingredients together in a mini-food processor and spin to a moist paste and then add the oil. easy and no difference in taste.

The marinade is wonderful! Made these for a party last night and people raved about them. However, all those in attendance (including myself) agree with sveral of the previous reviewers' opinion that the sauce didn't really suit the wings. The sauce is good and may be good with something else - but it seems to clash with flavor of the wings. But I will definitely be making the wings again, sans sauce.

Wings were very good. BBQ'd them instead. Sauce was ok/good, but don't need red pepper.

This was the biggest hit of my birthday party, I was sorta surprised. But I guess they taste exotic enough to impress non-chefs : ). i would double the peanut sauce. I look forward to making these again, along with other varieties of wings, for a super bowl party.

Very tasty--have made several times. Took some to the office holiday party and won the "gold medal." I did make two changes: Baking the wings as the recipe indicated didn't produce the crispy skin I like, so next time I made them I broiled them (turning frequently) for about twenty minutes. Also, I love peanut sauces but I didn't think the sauce and wings went together that well so I skip the sauce now. And finally, I garnish the wings with a generous amount of fresh chopped coriander when I set them out on the platter.

I made this both with wings and with skinned chicken breasts and thighs, both were excellent. It makes a nice presentation with chicken breast with the sauce poured in a stripe with a sprinkle of chopped red onion.

I read all of the reviews of this recipe, and I expected the dish to be pretty phenomenal. I allowed the chicken to marinate (I used wings as well as drummies) for about 5 hours. Maybe that was my problem? The wings had an original taste, but they weren't as flavorful as I thought it was going to be. I also thought with the amount of spices I added (cayenne especially) the chicken would have more heat, but it didn't. The peanut / coconut milk sauce was just okay. I didn't think the sauce complemented the chicken too well. I was hoping to make this dish for a party setting, but after tasting it, I don't think I will anymore.

My family and an associate raved about these wings w/the associate thinking I had bought them at a deli or restaurant! I and my family adored the dipping sauce which was a welcome departure from the traditional satay sauces. We served celery sticks alongside and were dipping wings and celery in the sauce. Oh; we didn't use shallots; even if they're green onions, I didn't have any and didn't want to go get some. Still, the wings were absolutely delicious.

This has become one of my standards, though I thought the sauce was disgusting and haven't made it since the first time. I've even made it for friends in Poland where it received raves.

This is an awesome recipe! Even my picky family liked them except for the peanut sauce (I loved the sauce). The marinade is great and the wings taste great by them selves without the sauce. Next time I will try it with chicken thighs. Definately a keeper!

Great recipe. Should be called International Chicken, because of the far reaching influences. I used the basic recipe, with chicken thighs instead of wings. Yum

LOVED the marinade, just make sure you crumble the rosemary into very small pieces. I didn't think the sauce was either necessary or that great (although I did substitute coconut milk for coconut cream); I think a plain old peanut satay sauce would have been just fine. As I'm not a fan of chicken wings, I intend to use the marinade on chicken breasts next time and serve this dish as a main course.

We've made this several times and the mix of flavors is great! As is usual for us, we use red onions instead of shallots. We've used drumsticks as well as wings (and a mix of the 2). Easy clean up and really unusual. A nice alternative to jerk chicken

We used drummettes instead of full wings. The marinade was too powerful for such small pieces. But even when we tried it on larger pieces, the shallots were too strong and I thought it was too salty. The thing to take away from this recipe is the peanut sauce---addictive! Great dip for snow peas, cucumbers, chicken pieces, shrimp, red bell peppers, etc. I like putting a little more red pepper flakes in the sauce for extra kick and then spooning (little goes a long way) over cold pasta with shrimp, cucumber, carrot and red bell pepper. The hot sauce and cold pasta contrast very well. It's our new summer favorite.

Easy to make and delicious. My eight year old loved it. The sauce is particularly good.

I substituted mixed herbs for rosemary and it was very ebjoyable. I also used a premade sate sauce and that just finised it off nicely.
