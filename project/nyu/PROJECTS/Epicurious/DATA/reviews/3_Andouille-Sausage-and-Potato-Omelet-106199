Since there have only been 3 reviews on this recipe I feel compelled to add my two cents. Was looking for some way to use up some andouille (left over from last weeks gumbo) and a few small yukon golds. Looked like this would be a good match. Misread recipe used about 1/2 cup of red pepper and onion. Didn't fine it overwhelming. Also had two pieces of applewood smoked bacon so fried and added. Made for Valentine's Day brunch for 2. The omelet (more like a frittata) was "hearty". Agree with other reviewer this would also make a good supper dish with a salad. Will keep and make a again, might try sprinkling with cheese when placing in oven.

A frittata by any other name--what's not to love? We added minced red bell pepper when we threw in the sausage. This has "bed and breakfast special" written all over it.

A good simple evening supper. You might either want to cut back on the salt a bit or use a low-sodium sausage--my omelet turned out quite salty.

This was delicious, a really easy sunday night supper. It would lend itself to a lot of variations. I roasted some asparagus while I was sauteing the veggies and andouille and served it along side, with grape tomatoes, fresh salsa and hard rolls. My husband added his ubiquitous Busha Browne's to it and we were both happy. If you have a problem finding andouille, Bruce Aidells makes a really good one and it is available at Sam's clubs here in Florida. If you go to aidells.com you can check for availability in your area. Worth seeking out because it has many uses,such as seasoning bean dishes, used with shrimp in pasta dishes and also as the sausage in jambalaya.
