This recipe was a hit at the BBQ! With the marinated artichokes and basil, the red wine vinegar is not really necessary since there is already so much flavor. Also, I tried the salad without the cheese and it was much better before I added the cheese, but still good with it. I also added yellow bell pepper and black olives and think this would be fantastic with other veggies for some crunch. I will definitely make some version of this recipe again.

I have to go against the grain on this one. I didn't think the dressing was anything special. It was a bit bitter, as well, although that might have been my fault because I didn't measure out the goat cheese. Do note that they tell you not to add the cheese until right before serving because it will clump a bit if it sits in the salad overnight.

Very average. Wouldn't make again. Wasn't bad, but not worth the ingredients.

Great, fresh and light pasta salad! I made the salad the night before serving and added the goat cheese last minute. Excellent! Easy and super flavorful.

Very good. We used our fresh garden tomatoes and basil. Will definitely make again. Very easy and quick to put together. Would make a good dish to take to or prepare for a party.

We've made this a few times - tasty and easy. Today I accidentally bought a package of Boursin Garlic & Herbs (thinking Boursin was goat cheese. Oops.) - HAPPY ACCIDENT! Coats the pasta more evenly than the goat cheese. I'm adding it in my notes to do that from now on.

This is the very first time I've ever submitted a review. It isn't something I really care to do. However, when I saw some negative reviews, I had to respond. This is my most fave recipe ever. My family loves it, my friends love it...I have loved this recipe since its debut in August 2002. Thanks BA for such an awesome recipe!!!!

I served this as first course for a dinner party and my guests raved over it. I used top quality everything. tomatoes still warm from the sun, goat cheese from a local cheese maker, a special olive oil I found on a recent visit to California. I think in a simple recipe like this the quality of ingredients is everything.

Took to an outdoor concert and two liked, two didn't (I didn't). Makde as directed but not "cured" as long as called for. Maybe I just don't like goat cheese as much as I thought, but I won't make this again.

yummy!!! rave reviews at the cookout. we can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! FYI: i followed the instructions below of 1/2 c. each of oil and vinegar, and it was a bit dry. there wasn't a significant vinegar taste anyways the way that i made it, so i recommend following the recipe as instructed.

cut the olive oil in half, doubled the red wine vinegar, added lemon juice and black pepper and chopped red and yellow bell peppers, and upped the green onion and basil. can't speak to what the original recipe tastes like, but with these modifications it was TERRIFIC. it was devoured by our guests.

Surprised to read bad reviews - I made this for two bbqs in the same weekend and it got rave reviews all around. I lowered the oil amount significantly and upped the vinegar, because I prefer a vinegary salad. I also added orange and red peppers and used fun pasta shapes. The salad does get gluey if kept too long in the fridge, like overnight, but my first attempt was a double batch and I didn't have any left.

I agree with the previous reviewer. This was horrid. Grocery store pasta salad is a step up from this. The goat cheese glues to the pasta, resulting in a dry texture. You can barely swallow each bite. It is also very bland.

Rating: 1
There should be a zero fork option. I see the reviewers who rated it well made substantial revision to this bland, yet slightly rancid tasting pasta. I made it as written. When my open minded family put it in their mouths it was roundly given an ugly nose scrunching, lip puckering blech! I rehabed it... sort of... by adding colorful veggies and more cheese and it was still only just so-so. Barf.

Used tips from other reviewers and used less oil, a combination of sundried and regular tomatoes and added parmesan cheese. It made a huge amount, could have cut recipe in half. Made a day ahead and refrigerated and it was a little dry. Liked it, but didn't love it.

I made this dish for a cocktail party I just had. Everyone loved it and a few people asked for the recipe. Yummy! I reduced the oil as suggested by other reviewers,good call! I also doubled the artichokes and used 10 oz of goat cheese, I REALLY like goat cheese! I cooked the pasta,added the artichokes, onions and oil & vin the night before, then tossed in the rest before serving. Be careful not to pick a delicate pasta,like I did,it broke apart from all the mixing. This is my new pasta salad recipe!

This was delicious hot. No leftovers to test how it would be cold. My husband suggested the addition of crabmeat as a variation. Might just try it.

Served 2 versions (one goat cheese and one feta cheese) and it was very well liked. Make this ahead definitely. The flavor is better after it sits for awhile.

Served this for a Mother's Day crowd of 25 with leftovers for the next day. I used gemelli pasta for an interesting twist, feta with basil and sundried tomatoes, and grape tomatoes. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

I served this hot, and it was still good. The goat cheese melted and coated the pasta and the tomatoes softened. I used half the oil the recipe called for (in response to the previous reviews), and it was fine. I'll have to try this as a cold salad!

Lovely! Cut back on the olive oil, added more basil and vinegar, not to mention a splash of lemon juice for bite. Tasty and different!

I substituted balsamic vinagrette instead of red wine vinegar. and added paremsean cheese. My guests loved it and thought I bought it from the store....I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe! Made exactly as the recipe was written. My only change would be a little less oil.

Great salad! I used feta and parsley because it's what I had on hand, but next time will definatley try it with goat cheese. Will also add some onions next time.

Good flavors, easy, and you can make it ahead--a huge plus when having big parties. My guests were scraping the bottom of the bowl. I used grape tomatoes and cut them in half and used feta instead of goat cheese because too many people aren't too thrilled with goat cheese.

I liked this a lot -- but varied it by using a different pasta shape; adding a sliced yellow pepper and some quartered kalmata olives; and substituting feta for the goat cheese -- and increased the proportion of artichoke hearts. Yum! And the left-overs were just as good, if not better on day 2 and beyond.

We loved this salad. Used feta and added sweet onions for an added bite and a little crunch. Have made it several times all to rave reviews.

Great recipe. Made with little spirals. Needed to add more vinegar to the recipe since it was too oily as it was. Used red and yellow grape tomatoes, cut into 1/4s, and cut down on the onions. Add the tomatoes last minute, too, so they don't get mushy!

I left out the scallions, and used a mixture of red, orange and yellow tomatoes. However I couldn't find fresh basil today so I used a scoop of pesto I had on hand. Thought this was nice, but didn't love it.

This is delicious. An elegant upgrade to your usual pasta salad with out additional work. It also lends itself well to variations. I've added mushrooms, arugula, and red peppers as the mood strikes. Also added some roasted chicken to the leftovers as suggested by another reviewer and had it for lunch. Excellent in any form!

This is it! I will NEVER make another pasta salad besides this one again. It's refreshing and lovely. The pasta was filling enough to make this a meal. I halved the recipe and we had 4 full meals out of it. This would be phenomenal as an appetizer or a nice summer lunch

This is our new favourite pasta salad! I lessened the oil to 1/4C and added about 1/4C halved kalamata olives. Really, really, tasty.

Yummy! This is a great pasta salad. Drained a can of tomatoes (because I hate chopping them)and forgot to add the goat cheese, oh also I cut the recipe in 1/2. I thought the flavor had diminished by the second day, so I would make it the day it's being served.
