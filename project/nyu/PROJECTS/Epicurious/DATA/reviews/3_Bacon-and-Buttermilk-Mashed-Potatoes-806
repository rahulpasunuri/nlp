Well, since the first time I made them in 1994, I am the one who brings the mashed potatoes annually to all family gatherings. I add one tablespoon of bacon fat to the potatoes consistently. Depending on my whim, I may add cheeses,& garlic. Not the creamiest or smoothest, but, now a traditional family favorite.

Add a little cheddar cheese and these were the best loaded mashed poattoes!

I first made these for Thanksgiving in 1994 and they instantly became a family tradition. My son, who loves bacon, loves to prepare this dish. And eat it. There are no leftovers.

I'm not really sure what the buttermilk added beyond liquid. The potatoes were good but I certainly didn't taste any difference between them and mashed potatoes made with regular milk. I mixed the chopped bacon into mashed potatoes rather than sprinkling them on top. Maybe some of the crunch was lost, but I did wait to mix the bacon until right before serving. Good, but not special.

I followed this to the letter and found them to be bland. My wife thought the same thing. I would not make them again.

This sounded so wonderful but we were so disappointed. The only thing I changed was I used red potatoes instead of russet. While the flavor was okay, they were sooo dry. I even added extra buttermilk but it didn't help.

I forgot to add the onions, but everyone loved them anyway! If I make them again I might leave out the bacon or halve the amount.

As l made it last year and my family kept comming back for seconds and thirds. I had nothing left last year. It was a perfect side dish. I'll double the recipe this year.

Not for the faint of heart (literally). Sinfully good, but you'll need to eat salads for a week to clense the arteries.
