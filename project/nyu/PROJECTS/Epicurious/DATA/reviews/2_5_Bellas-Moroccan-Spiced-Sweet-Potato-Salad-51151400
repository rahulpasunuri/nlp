This dish needs more of a kick for me to rate it higher. Consider adding 1/3 more spices than called for. I will make it again.

Just to clarify - a Yam is not a Sweet Potato.

I'm getting ready to make this recipe and appreciate the CONSTRUCTIVE comments. Seems to me if you just want to criticize and not contribute..save it for another forum!

What in the name of God makes this "Moroccan", the maple syrup???? Please, let's be more judicious when it comes to "christening" our food with vapid adjectives to make it sound delicious.

It was OK. Cooking time is way off, it took at least 30 min (not 15) and about 10 more uncovered and I added about 2tbsp water. Kinda bland, the highlight was when you connected with an olive. I used toasted almonds, gave it a good crunch but it needed more salt in the end. It is a different way to use sweet potatoes though and I might try again but increase the spices.

Was a very tasty dish after I made the following alterations: doubled all of the herbs and pistachios and used 1 Tbl of maple syrup. The cooking time is WAY OFF. It took me close to an hour to cook to doneness, however the finished product was quite scrumptious. The briny olives with the sweet potatoes and bright citrus flavors plus the smoky cumin and paprika really make this dish come alive on your palate and offers a unique way to prepare sweet potatoes and add interest to a vegetarian dish. Delicious.
