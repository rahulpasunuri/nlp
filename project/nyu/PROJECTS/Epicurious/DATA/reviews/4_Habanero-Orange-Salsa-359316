Roasted pine nuts would add to the flavour too!

This would likely be really good with sliced endive and possibly radachio. Garlic is a must! Will try and get back to you.

This salad is absolutely delicious. We've made it with fish, on its own, and with tacos and will make it again frequently. The flavour combination of the sweet orange, spicy habanero and savoury onion is just perfect. It's also great for surprising dinner guests - nobody expects a spicy salad!

We thought it was more of a salad than a salsa- something we ate with a fork as opposed to tortilla chips. It was incredibly simple, refreshing, and unique.

This was easy and fabulous with pork chops. I'll be making this again and again.

Fantastic recipe! Very easy and delicious served with pork chops, chicken or any dish needing a little more spice and excitement. I paired it with Arugula Salad with Caramelized onions and candied walnuts (heres the link- http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views /Arugula-Salad-with-Caramelized-Onions- Goat-Cheese-and-Candied-Walnuts-357496 ) Add a white wine, and it is a great treat!
