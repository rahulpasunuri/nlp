Great! I used a can of petite diced tomoatoes and cilantro, and half frozen corn, half canned, since that's what I had. Next time I will make more so there actually are some leftovers.

Bland and boring. Was embarrassed to serve it. Would absolutely not make it again.

I always make a recipe exactly as written to have an accurate review. This recipe was very uneventful and way too bland. The edamame beans should be pre cooked as they were very underdone. The onion was very mushycompared to the rest. I recommend if you want to use this as a cold salad to mix the tomatoe in after it cools to avoid cooking the tomatoe as happens as this recipe is written. I ended up tossing the leftovers as none of us were enjoying them. There are much better edamame reicpes, I won't make this one again.

A good recipe when fresh veggies are scarce. I used all pantry/freezer staples. . .canned corn, canned tomatoes, frozen edamame. . .it's a tasty recipe in a grocery pinch. I used coriander, cumin, dried oregano, chile powder and lime juice instead of fresh herbs. I wished I hadn't added more salt than it called for. We'll make it again.

This makes an excellent side dish! Although it does make alot (well, it's 16oz each of corn and edamame!!), it has a nice combination of flavors and textures to compliment your main dish. I'm looking forward to trying it cold with lunch tomorrow.

I enjoyed the warm version of it much more. I added a thai red chilli to the dish for some extra flare. I ended up throwing the left overs into scrambled egg whites for breakfast in the morning. Very healthy and satisfying

We enjoyed the dish but made some of the modification suggested by other despondences. I used both basil and chives and a healthy amount, as my herb garden is bountiful right now. I also added feta, diced green pepper and chicken breast to make it a main dish. Salting to taste, a bit of cumin, and the juice of 1 lime, perks up the flavor a lot. It was very good and I will make it again for a quick summer meal that can be made ahead.

Simple, but tasty and my 2 year old loved it. Didn't change a thing. Making it again for lunches this week.

I skipped the corn, and added half a diced jalapeno to the edamame for a great kick, and tossed room-temperature sweet grape tomatoes with half a diced orange pepper. I squeezed lime over the whole thing, and it was excellent. I might have this next with a piece of grilled salmon or in a tortilla.

My entire family loves this one. It's so easy to make, and it's one of the few dishes that never comes out wrong. I leave out the onions and use sweet basil instead of chives, which makes for a slightly sweeter dish. Sometimes I add a bit of bufala mozzarella after I've put it on the plate, which turns it into a modified caprese salad. One of my husband's favorites!

Very good and simple to make. I had some edamame in the freezer and this recipe was a great use for them. I worried that it would be bland but salt and fresh black pepper did a good job of making it tasty and the chives gave it a kick. Very colorful and attractive.

The recipe as-is was bland for my taste, even with using fresh corn. The basil version (as opposed to chives) is a little more flavorful. To liven things up when using chives, I added feta cheese and shrimp.

Not bad - but it does make a LOT. I had to resort to butter beans, but my husband wouldn't go near it, so I had to eat it by myself. Too much for me!

I made this to bring to work. It's great adding chicken to it..nice flavor (I made it with basil), pleasant texture. The flavors are subtle...you might want to increase the herbs, if you prefer a stronger flavor. All in all, a nice side dish, or lunch main dish.

The basil and frozen corn did not complement each other. It was better hot and I was left with too many leftovers.

Superbland-kind of like eating boiled frozen corn mixed with boiled frozen edamame, and I even added extra salt, pepper and basil. Any tips for giving what sounds like a nice salad base some flavor?

This is a great side salad. I served it with turkey & blue cheese sandwiches. Big hit with the fam & friends. Had left overs and added it to black beans which also was yummy.

I like this so much better with the edamame in the succotash as opposed to Lima beans.

I love this recipe, obviously not for the ingenuity, but because everything in the recipe screams summer. It's simple, fresh, nutritious and pretty.

Absolutely Excellent! I have never had Edamame prior to this and served it as the vegetable for a wine dinner pairing it with Pinot Grigio. Everyone loved it & a vegetarian who was there said it was excellent. Only change I made was to add a 1/2 -1 tsp of dried italian herb mix. Finished mine with fresh basil and salt & pepper to taste. I made quadruple batch and will make it again for two more tastings this month, served it with parmesean crusted chicken over penne w/ butternut squash sauce.
