They are certaily easy to make, but I think next time i would add nuts to break up some of the richness.

This recipe was loved by my family! Very easy to make too. I used oreo cookies as I could not find chocolate wafers.

Who could resist this bittersweet treat and it's minty aftertaste. For those who want to try a classic dessert, try this: All American Chocolate Cake - http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/all-american-chocolate-cake

I love this recipe and so did all our friends! Super easy to make and they look pretty, too! I used the mini marshmallows and a Safeway brand chocolate mint thin wafer cookie broken up into small pieces. Followed the recipe and used the loaf pan lined with foil and had no trouble removing it from the foil afterward. I cut them into bite size chunks and served for dessert. They are totally addictive!

Easy and tasty, but could use some changes. As is, the pieces are way too thick with too much chocolate (can't believe I'm saying that). This recipe would work better in a larger pan (7x11?) so the candy is more like bark. I added some crushed candy canes, which were yummy and added color. Instead of plain wafers, I used Anna's Chocolate Mint Thins for the cookies. Next time I'll use small marshmallows, smaller cookie pieces and a larger pan.

This is the quickest and easiest holiday treat ever! Both my picky husband and a party I went to loved them. Made them as written and they turned out great.

very delicious chocolates! i used milk chocolate as the base. peppermint joe joe's from trader joe's in lieu of the pepp extract and chocolate wafers. and drizzed with both white and bittersweet chocolate on top.
