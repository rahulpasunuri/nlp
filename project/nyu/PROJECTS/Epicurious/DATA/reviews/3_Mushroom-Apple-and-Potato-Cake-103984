Great! I would make half again as much of the mushroom / apple mixture and sprinkle layers of potatoes with fresh pepper. Made the dish for my "gourmet" club for a theme of "everything had to have cake in the recipe", so this was fun.

Absolutely loved the flavors of this dish. Putting it together was a little difficult for this novice cook. But, it was worth it. Completely impressive side dish.

I wish I could give it 2 1/2 forks! (2 forks is "like it", 3 forks is "delicious"). I liked it a lot and would certainly make it again, but not for company. It is quite a healthy dish so I make it now and again for my family, including my 2 year old son. I've used sweet pototoes as well.

I made this recipe for 2 and found the proportions to be off. I used an 8" skillet and needed the full 1# of potatoes to get the layers. Also when I flipped the cake and went to put it back in the skillet it wasn't 'together' and fell apart. The flavor was okay but had too many potatoes to get much of the mushroom/apple flavor.

The apple flavor was just a little too different for our tastes. We would have preferred to have substituted onions or leeks for the apple.

I wasn't sure about this when I first made it, but now I'm sold on it! A great side dish for the Pork Chops with Sauteed Apples and Cream recipe also on this site. Try it, you'll love it, trust me.
