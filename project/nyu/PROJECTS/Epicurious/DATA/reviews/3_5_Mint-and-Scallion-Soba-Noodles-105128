This is very good although I made quite a few changes. I used sesame oil and also (after tasting the sauce and finding it VERY sour) I added a LOT more sugar. Not sure how much, maybe a quarter cup. Also only used three scallions although could have gone up a little on those. But I think 1.5 cups would have been overkill. As I made it it's very refreshing, healthy side.

Fantastic on a hot sticky summer night, and very easy. The sesame oil instead of the veggie oil is definitely the way to go. I also added cucumber, but whatever veggies you have would probably be very nice. Don't skimp on the mint, it adds a lovely fresh flavour.

Very nice, and so easy! Wonderful just as written. But if you run out of mint or just want to vary this a little, try shiso or lovage in lieu of mint. Also nice to substitute scallion with green garlic and/or chives, in the spring.

These noodles were delicious. I didn't have any scallions, so I used some sliced shallots. Like the other reviewers suggested, I used sesame oil instead of the vegetable oil. I served these with stir fried veggies, but I think they would stand on their own, especially with some tofu.

Really wonderful and easy. I definitely recommend adding 1 cup of cucumber to add more crunch.

I added the sesame oil as well and it was amazing. I think next time I'll add more veggies... the scallions were a little overpowering.

Quick, simple and delicious. I added cucumber (thanks to another reviewer). I substituted ume plum vinegar for the sugar and toasted sesame oil for the vegetable oil. I might cut back on the oil next time.

Very good and simple recipe. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and added a splash of sesame oil - it made a very positive difference. YUM.

I made this last night for a quick light dinner, it was fast and delicious. Instead of using veg oil I used sesame oil, splashed a little extra vinegar and sugar, omited the extra salt; the soy sauce had enough; and added cooked brocolli, thinly sliced cucumber and julianned carrots. I think this recipe is so versatile you could add whatever veggies you wanted and it would just add to the wonderful flavor of the dish. We loved it!

I was given a bunch of mint from a co-worker's garden and as I was looking for something easy to make for dinner in the middle of the week, I came across this recipe. It is excellent!!! ...leftovers taste even better.

This is a great recipe-- I keep soba noodles around so I can make it any time, esp. for summertime guests of the vegetarian persuasion. Everybody always likes it.

This was a GREAT recipe once I substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil! Makes a WORLD of difference! Delicious! Would definitely make again!

This was a pleasant side dish--good with the super-flavorful Korean steaks. This is definitely a side dish, though. There's not enough flavor to stand alone. But it rounds out an Asian-flavored meal nicely.

I loved this recipe. For a little variety, I added 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds, and some shredded carrots. My entire family loved it!

This was great served with the Korean style steak with cilantro sauce. I had to make a little extra dressing because it became a bit dry after sitting in the frig for a bit.

Wow, this is first time using mint in soba. But I think it is good westurn idea. I don't know we can consider soba as salad but ... sure!!

I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe, but I want to emphasize that it wasn't the soba noodles (my first go at them) which were every bit as tasty as any other noodle. I plan to use them again in other recipes. I think the salad needed more ingredients, such as the cucumber one reviewer added. I did cut back on the salt as suggested, and added about a teaspoon of minced ginger to the dressing. My dining companion thought the noodles were quite good, thus the 2 fork rating, while I would have rated it 1 fork, or so-so. We both thought the dressing contained too much vinegar, and I felt the salad was overly sweet, perhaps due to the mint. I think that the Sesame Soba Noodle and Vegetable Salad on this site might be more interesting. Heck, maybe I just ate too many cookies before dinner.

Yummy! Fresh and cool tasting. I also cut down the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Adding a little diced cucumber was good too. I feel that the recipe really required a little more dressing so I used 1 1/2 times the suggested amount and it was perfect!

I made this as a side dish to the Poached Chicken with Ginger and Scallion Sauce recipe and it was fantastic. It was very simple and fresh- my guests liked the noodles the best.

This was great! It's a quick, easy and refreshing dish for summer days. I added a bit of fresh minced ginger which complimented the scallions and mint nicely. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Before making the receipe, I noticed that it contained soy sauce and 3/4 tsp. of salt. The salt amount seemed to be too much, so I only used 1/4 tsp. instead and it was the correct amount. If I had used the amount recommended in the recipe, it would have been inedible. Instead, it was terrific and it will be a summer staple.
