These are a good tea cookie. They are dry and crumbly - so NOT for people who like moist cookies. I was surprised to see baking powder in a sables recipe, but it makes these cookies a little less dense than traditional sables. Toasting the walnuts AFTER they are chopped really brings out the walnut flavor. The second time I made this recipe I left off the raw sugar and drizzled the cookies after they had cooled with melted chocolate - which I thought much improved the taste. Chocolate is such a good compliment to walnuts. I'm a reasonably patient cook, but don't enjoy fussing with cookie cutters, so I rolled these out in a slab and cut them into small diamonds.

So, if I substituted granulated sugar for confectioner's sugar in this recipe, would it be a one-to-one substitution? I cannot stand the cornstarch flavor and texture in confectioner's sugar.

These are very good cookies. The oven temperature in the recipe is 325 F and it works just fine!

I make these cookies every year and they are very good. It's a quick, easy, yet elegant addition to christmas baking.

These were just OK. The oven temp is way to high for a rolled cookie. The first tray was too brown on the bottom while the tops were still pale. I lowered it to 350 with better results but the taste was average at best. If you want a much better nut cookie try the mexican wedding cakes on this site. They are out of this world!

I made these exactly to the recipe. They were delicious!! I did shorten the baking time a little. Just watch closely.
