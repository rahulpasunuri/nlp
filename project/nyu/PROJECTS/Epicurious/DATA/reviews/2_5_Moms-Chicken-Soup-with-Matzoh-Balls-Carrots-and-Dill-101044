Regarding the matzoh balls. Here are some tips from my grandmother the Jewish cook and modified by my mother, the scientific home economics teacher. Use canned or boxed chicken broth to cook matzoh balls so you don't waste valuable soup. Seperate the eggs and add the yolks to the matzoh meal mixtures. Then beat the whites until soft peaks form and fold into the mixture. Makes an even lighter matzoh ball. Don't take off the cover until they are cooked...At least 45 minutes.

Cooking matzoh balls in the makes the soup cloudy. Instead of cooking them in the chicken soup, I substitute chicken soup for the water and that adds the flavor.

I also use Seltzer and I too chill for at least 1 hour (and if the reviewers read the recipe you'd see that it calls for chilling!). But I agree with those who use plain water for cooking. First of all, that's how my grandmother taught me. Second, my soup is too precious to lose it through the boiling process. And third, grandma said you do anything to protect the soup against clouding - and that include celery and matzo balls.

I've been cooking for 35 years, and I am successful cooking matzoh balls in boiling salted water with the pot cover on about 90%. If you boil or cook water for 35 minutes, it diminishes -- it cooks out. Why would you want to use precious homemade soup to cook matzoh balls for 35 minutes, and risk loosing a quantity of your soup. What a waste! If the matzoh balls are properly seasoned, they will be equally delicous if they are cooked in boiling water! Covering the pot while cooking, makes the matzoh balls double or triple in size.

Tsk, Tsk, ladies....for a NEVER FAIL soup try Croyden Matza Ball Soup Mix. With the soup or your own....the balls are simply great! Of course I add fresh dill and a dash of cinammon. And I have been known to pour 1/2 c. white wine in soup...and more dill. And yes, I cook them in the soup..20min.covered. They are sooo good!

These have to be the worst knaidlach (matzoh balls) I've ever eaten. My grandma wasn't the greatest cook, but even her knaidl were better than these! The best recipe I've ever tried, is actually the one on the Manischewitz box of matzoh meal. No seltzer. I use organic olive oil in place of schmaltz, & it's still great, & water for broth & it's still great!

I haven't tried this particular version yet but had to respond to the first reviewer's comments about cooking the matzoh balls in the soup. For maximum flavor that's absolutely the BEST way to cook them -- and it certainly doesn't ruin either the soup or its appearance! I've been using my grandmother's recipe for years and would never cook them any other way!

Two things seriously wrong withthis recipe. First, you must chill the mixture before cooking. Second, you NEVER cook the balls in the soup. Cook in boiling water only, then add to soup before serving. Cooking in the soup will absolutely ruin the soup.

My grandmother gave me this recipe when I was first married and told me that the family secret to the lightest matzoh balls was the use of seltzer. Either Anne and I are related, or else my grandmother's secret is no more. Anyway, people using this recipe should not be put off by the fact that the batter will be loose at first, but will thicken after it is chilled. The other secret that I learned is once you drop the matzoh balls in the soup, do not peek for at least 30 minutes. Enjoy this recipe; my family has for generations.

I have not made it yet, but I fully intend to. It sounds delicious.

I cup of matzo meal isn't enough for all that liquid egg, fat, and seltzer mixture. Also it should be chilled before cooking.
