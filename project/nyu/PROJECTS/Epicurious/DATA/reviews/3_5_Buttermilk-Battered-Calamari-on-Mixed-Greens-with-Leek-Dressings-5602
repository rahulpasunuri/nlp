Added salt, black pepper and a little cayenne pepper to the flour, otherwise, i followed the recipe as written. The calamari turned out tender, light and crispy. Better than the restaurant dish I recently had that inspired me to try this. Will definitely make again.

I haven't made this version, I came looking for a nice salad to serve with fried calamari. Nigella Lawson makes a great, totally simple version (if you have great, fresh squid, this is definately the best way): Put some flour, lots of salt and pepper in a ziplock bag, add calamari rings and tentacles, shake until coated and fry in your choice of oil until crispy. Don't overcook or they get rubbery.

I was skeptical about trying this dish based on some of the other reviews, but I'm glad that I did. I added a good amount of "Mrs. Dash" spicy seasoning to the flour mix and was very satisfied with the flavor. This dish is also very easy to prepare and not time-consuming. It was a hit served as an appetizer with salsa on the side.

I've made this one several times and it has always been enjoyed by any squid lover. I like squid peppery so I add a fair amount to the flour. I prefer to use the large squid bodies or even cuttlefish, which are relatively huge. Much more tender than the little guys that you usually find. If you're lucky enough to have a decent Asian market nearby, that's a good source.

Sorry guys, this just didn't do it for me. First of all 1 pound of calamari is equivalent to about 2 whole squids. There is enough flour and buttermilk for 6 pounds. Threw most of it out. I even doctored the flour with tons of herbs and seasonings to give it some flavour. I put garlic in the oil. It just seemed to lack having lots of flavour. I still haven't found that perfect recipe yet that tastes like calamari you'd get in a restaurant. I am going to try buying this tempura mix that they sell in my local seafood shop and see if that turns out better.

Thois is not only excellent freshly done, but the battered squid can sucessfully be frozen and reheated. Helpful when cooking for one.

Cook from New York: if you check this recipe again, you'll find the Leek Dressing recipe by clicking on it. When a recipe title is underlined, it's linked.

Did I miss something? Where's the recipe for the leek dessing? I was going to try this recipe when I realized that the leek dressing recipe appears to be missing.

this was wonderful! i added cayenne to spice it up, make sure oil is HOT, then add battered calamari, it's out within 10 sec. I put it over a bed of baby spinach and added lemon-olive oil dressing...mmmm

The buttermilk seemed to make the whole recipe. I added 2tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper and 1 tsp of a homemade chili powder to the flour and deep fried each batch in hot crisco, it came out light, crispy and not greasy at all. Each batch was GONE before the other was out of the frier.

One of the best fried squid I've ever had!
