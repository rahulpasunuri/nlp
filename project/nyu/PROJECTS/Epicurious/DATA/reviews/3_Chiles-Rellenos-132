Several of you say the sauce makes the dish. What do you use for sauce?

I have had more than my fair share of soggy, greasy, fried rellenos and these baked ones really let the pepper shine through. Hatch canned poblano peppers deliver in flavor, authenticity and convenience. Since the garlic is not cooked, I found it overwhelming and will leave out next time. Microwaved the leftovers the next day with no loss in texture or flavor. This recipe is simple and good enough that it will be used to make a food presentation featuring Hatch chiles to a vendor.

These turned out really good. The only substitution I made was fresh poblano peppers instead of canned. The sauce was okay, but the peppers made the dish.

I gave it 2 forks because it could be an interesting mid-week meal BUT.... This is not Chiles Rellenos. Call it a chile casserole or something, anything but not Chiles Rellenos.

I've made this twice, both times with fresh chilies and the second time with the Mexican cheese suggestion which was best. Both poblano chilies and anaheim chilies work great and they reheat well. I love the fried ones, but these are a terrific substitute. I've made the first part of the suggested sauce and each time blended in a different commercial salsa. It works for us.

I've made this twice and can say that the suggestion of Mexican cheeses was right on! The second time with oxaca, queso fresco some cheddar and a little feta whether in the poblano or anaheim chili this was great. I've yet to completely follow the dierections for the sauce as I have blended a different commercial salsa into it each time. I love the fried ones, but these are a terrific substitute. They reheat well, too.

I made this dish as part of a vegetarian tapas dinner. It was great. I used fresh peppers and roasted them. I omitted the feta altogether and used a very aged Reypenaar instead of the cheddar. I did find the sauce a little bland actually. Maybe it was because the jalapenos I used weren't very spicy. I would definately make it again.

What a fresh alternative to the traditional fried chile rellenos and healthier too! Any combo of cheeses would work well with this. I used Queso Fresco, Asadero and Cheddar...YUM! But I have to agree with most reviewers...it's the SAUCE that makes these a dish worth repeating.

I would say to stay with the traditonl ways of doing it fry them and stuff them with jack cheese or chickin or beef or all the above. and for the sauce use the racharo sauce on this site it is good just leave out all the peppers in the sauce, like one said you are stuffing peppers.

I think the cook from Mexico should relax a little-- and stop insulting others. No need to call the cook from Frankfurt "catatonic" just because s/he doesn't want to seed the chiles. If I were in charge of Epicurious, I'd have a word with Chef Mexico about manners.

feta is too salty. I would use goat cheese, it's closer to the real Mexican cheese generally used for chiles rellenos. If you don't peel fresh chiles, not only are you lazy, but you're going to have a very bitter and tough chile. Not seeding a chile? Why use good ingredients and then be too lazy to prepare them properly? If you're that close to catatonic, use canned.

I agree that fresh chilies are best. We made this recipe using fresh poblanos, but with a few changes. We used uncooked chilies and stuffed them with the seeds intact. Then we grilled the chilies instead of frying them the traditional way. We were having them with steak fajitas, and with mesquite on the grill and pico de gallo over the top, these were quite good. We didn't fool with the tomato sauce since we had the pico made. Lower fat, and it is easy to avoid eating the seeds. The filling was really good, we'll make these again.

A great variation of chili relleno's with the bite of feta cheese! If you can't get fresh green chilis, Canned ones from Hatch are the closest you'll come to fresh tasting ones.

This was not Chiles Rellenos but it was good. The feta makes it. I substituted Monterrey Jack for cheddar and added a traditional egg topping. At the end, I put spicy salsa and more M. Jack on top.

NEVER wach canned chilies. You loose flavor. Look for New Mexico's HATCH brand of chilies. Mexican Oregano boosts the flavor!

This is a good, basic, fast dish. It's not the best in the world, but it's feasible and tastes good for something you'll actually bother to make when you get home from work. Really, now--is it so bad to use something out of a can? I don't have a snobby attitude about that... and some of us can't spend all night cooking.

Welcome to the new Bon Appetit -- cans, boxes and prefabricated food products. Just another "keeper" recipe from BA. This goes really well with several of the Lean Cuisine side dishes.

I was not impressed with the canned chile's.I believe in fresh ingredients, fresh food, fresh taste and there are no true shortcuts for this Great dish. The roasted tomato sauce was very good.

I don't mean to be disrespectful of the other reviewers, but I didn't like this one at all. The filling was all runny and nothing special....didn't anyone else have this problem? Sorry but that's my opinion!

Delicious! Easy! Impressive! The strongly flavored sauce complemented the mild filling. I did roast and peel poblano peppers rather than use the canned peppers, but the canned peppers would probably be fine if you're short on time, or can't find good fresh peppers. The flavor of the roasted tomato sauce was wonderful!

chilis rellano should be made with fresh poblano peppers that are roasted and peeled
