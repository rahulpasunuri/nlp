I make these most years for Christmas. So good! They're a perfect cross between candy and a cookie. I recommend using parchment paper instead of foil though. My MIL asked for the recipe, so I think they're a hit.

I love pecan pie, but I have to say that these are better than pecan pie. Everyone who tried them loved them. I used whole wheat flour for half the flour amount and they turned out great.

Easy and very tasty. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup but it came out just as great.

Very very good cookie recipe, I expected these to be sweeter but they're actually perfect in sweetness. I had to sub 1/2 the brown sugar for regular and I can't imagine it made much of a difference. One tip - after baking the shortbread, line the sides of the pan with parchment paper as the caramel is going to be a PAIN to chip off the sides of a regular glass pan. :) Delicious, and great as presents!

Made these for the first time and they were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for baking the shortbread an additional five minutes b/c mine wasn't quite done. I used a ceramic pan, which may have been the reason. I was worried that I didn't cook the topping enough, but it was perfect. These cookies were more impressive than the effort it took to make them, which is my definition of a good recipe. The topping was a little blander and less caramelly than I would prefer, though. I think they needed a little more salt to bring out the flavor of the nuts and buttery caramel. Next time I will add a pinch of salt to the topping and use golden syrup instead of corn syrup.

Wow. This was the first of this type of dessert I made and it was amazing. I followed exactly except that I used the assortment of nuts I had on hand: almonds, pecans, walnuts, and a few pistachios. And I used evaporated milk bc I had no whipping cream. Everything else was exactly as instructed and it was a definite hit!

I have made this recipe many times, and each time I get rave reviews. I omit the chocolate though, it cuts better, and less messy.

Dangerously delicious! I made them using what I had in the house (golden syrup instead of corn syrup and half & half instead of whipping cream) and they turned out perfect. I might try adding some orange zest next time, though it might be gilding the lily.

Love these! The first time I made them, the shortbread turned out a bit too hard for my taste. The second time, though, I didn't compact it down as much before baking, and it's much better. So that might be a tip for those of you who are finding the cookie base isn't tender enough.

To me, these are better than pecan pie because the crust is easier and they are more chewy and less gooey. I only had 3 cups of pecans so I added macadamia nuts. I also added shredded coconut.

Have made these a number of times, they disappear every time.... I have been using Golden Syrup (British product, in some places Publix sells it, or perhaps you can find a grocer with English foods) instead of the corn syrup, and I think it really adds a nice flavor. Also,I use half and half, topping seems to be just great. They are not too sweet - just sweet enough that you want another one!!!

I don't want to ruin the ratings for this recipe in case I just need to experiment with it a bit more, so I'm not awarding any forks... My cookies turned out fine, but not stellar. They were basically gooey pecan pie in a bar cookie form. Definitely better as they aged, but mostly still just a super-sweet pecan pie concoction. I had no problem with crumbling (considering they're shortbread) or super-hard cookies. My oven is precise and I followed the times in the recipe, but something tells me maybe the cookies needed more time in both baking cycles?

Rating: 4
This is a great cookie. I have a very ill-tempered oven, and while the majority of my shortbread turned out pretty well-done, it didn't subtract from the flavor at all. These cookies really do get better with a little bit of time, which for me makes them even better. Who doesn't love stuff you can make a few days before an event and have them taste even better because they're a few days old.

Such a hit! I double the cream (1 cup instead) because I made a mistake the first time and it turned out so well! I use parchment paper and it's super easy clean up, too.

Brought these to work - they think I'm a genius. Ha! Will definitely add to my Christmas repertoire.

These were absolutely outstanding. Cut them very small because a small piece is really all you need. I found the shortbread crumbled a bit when I cut the diamonds. I think squares may crumble less.

Truly outstanding! I made these for a crowd (40 ppl) and everyone raved about them. I added a chocolate zig zag on them for an added punch of perfection. These will become a staple in our home.

Oh my gosh, these are positively addictive! I've made them many times over the years, I often take them to parties, and everyone always raves and asks for the recipe. (The last time I made them I accidentally shorted the butter in the crust by 2 tbsp but they still came out perfect.)

These are Oh My Gosh Good! And not hard. The food processor makes the crust easy to do. I doubled it, but made the crust in two batches so it would fit the processor. Then made the filling all in one batch. I used two large glass baking dishes, and parchment paper, thus no need to grease it. When baked, the crust had only slightly changed color, so I worred it was undercooked, but trusted the recipe, and indeed, it was perfect. I wonder if those who found it too crumbly overcooked it trying to get the crust to brown. I also pressed on the dough hard when putting it into the pan, which may have helped keep it from crumbling as well. I chopped the nuts in the processor,and the resulting variety of sizes of pieces worked fine. I put the finished cookies into individual cupcake papers, that had a Christmas design. This made a cute tray when passed after dinner along with mini-brownies. This is a wonderful combo of a shortbread cookie, with a praline/caramel nutty topping. Just fabulous.

I have now made this recipe three times and each time it has been consistently yummy. It's very easy, quite delicious and would keep for a long time if they were not devoured so quickly. The first time I made it I used dark corn syrup and the second time I used light as per the recipe - no real difference in the results or color. I did not cut them into diamonds, but left them as bar cookies and placed each in a foil cupcake wrapper which made a nice presentation.

Have been making these for a decade--raves every time. Double the recipe and it will fit a jelly roll pan. Cut-up and frozen these diamonds are a fast dessert. The only difficulty is finding them in this search engine..alas.

Outstanding! I will definitely make these again. Came out perfectly on the first try.

I made it as written and it came out wonderful. A great alternative to pecan pie

Everyone loved them!!! My aunt took the recipe for her mother-in-law and she's made them twice in the last month. The pecans are costly but well worth the investment. This is a really great recipe.

Good recipe. Followed the correct recipe directly from the magazine. Easy to make with excellent flavor and texture. Also works well with only 2 cups of pecans (personal preference)

Received lots of recipe requests for this one. The only problem I had was that the crust was very crumbly. Tasted great - just kinda messy with people walking around eating these little desserts. Tasted great, though! Not at all hard like I thought they would be.

These are fantastic! My guests can't stop eating them. I substitute maple syrup for the corn syrup for a little added richness.

Nice taste, very chewy. A lot of pecans. I think toppin should be cooked more. Cooked crust less, because someone else made them and they were like rocks.

One of my most popular recipes for cookies. Perfect as is, no changes necessary.

I'll tell you what these are: pralines with a crust, and they are delicious. I was expecting them to be too sticky and or hard like burnt sugar, but they are excellent.

Okay, here's another review! I have made these delights for 3 years now. I just made a batch last week and gave them to my husband to take to work. The next day they called him and told him they would "pay" me to make these again and to bring them in soon!

I have been making this recipe since it apperared in Bon Appetit in 1999 and have given the recipe to literally dozens of people. I cook and bake a lot and have NEVER had anything I have made get so many wonderful compliments and requests for copies of the recipe. It is easy, and one pan will feed a lot of people since it is so rich that most people will have only two or three small pieces. Great with butter pecan ice cream and drizzled with chocolate.

Absolutely delicious!! Will make again and again and again. Not just for the holidays recipe. A definite keeper.

Definitely addictive, I loved the sweet caramel goo that holds it all together... a fantastic find! Thanks to Cyndee for sharing this with me. I think it's a recipe I'll be making every Christmas!

Wha? Ottawa, powdered sugar is icing sugar. Don't go overboard creating work for yourself for no reason.

Rating: 4
One of the best cookie recipes I can think of! So simple to make (especially if you have a food processor), they look fantastic, and taste even better. Tip: for 'powdered sugar', do NOT use icing sugar, instead whirl granulated sugar in a food processor, or use fruit sugar. Also, I am too geometrically-challenged to do diamond shapes .. rectangular bars (1"x2") are easier.

Rating: 3
Very delectable- my only issue was a very crumbly crust. I did it by hand, but I'm not sure what I did incorrectly... And is icing sugar the same as powdered sugar?! Suppose that could contribute to crust troubles. Next time I'd drizzle with chocolate. Yum.

This recipe is a family favorite.They freeze perfectly and have been shipped to family and friends many times. The bars retain flavor and a chewy texture even after freezing.

I made these twice for Christmas baking, once for work and once for family. Of all the things I made, I found these very addictive. They're easy to make and don't take long. Definitely will make these again!

I normally don't like such a sweet cookie, but this one is terrific, and it looks like it is very difficult to make, so it's impressive, too. make sure you cut them into smallish diamonds or it's too much cookie to eat.

This is a great desert. Not too rich. Just enough sweetness. Used parchment paper, had no problem. It's a keeper!

I doubled this recipe and made it to take to a party. I had people coming up to me saying that they never eat sweets, but couldn't stop eating these. I made them again yesterday to take to my sons' school fair. I know they will be a big hit. I absolutely love this recipe. It is part of my often used stash of recipes.

I have made these many times and they are soooo good. Some helpful tips:1) Use parchment, no need to worry about sticking! 2)Do not overbake, as soon as they are bubbling in the center,take them out, they will firm up when cool!Someone mentioned they were hard to chew, they overcooked them! 3)Add a little good vanilla to the topping and 4)when cool lift them out of the pan using the parchment and take a bench knife and cut off the edges all the way around(then eat them)I then cut them into diamonds PERFECTION

I don't usually bake, but for Christmas I like to make a little homemade gift for family and friends. I quadrupled this recipe (substituting half the pecans with walnuts) and spent hours making it, but it was very much worthwhile-- I've never had so many compliments before, and so many requests for the recipe. I wouldn't make it more than once a year, but I would certainly make it again.

I can't give this recipe a rave review like the people before me. The bars tasted good, looked lovely (I used walnuts instead), but were almost too chewy and sticky. I brought them to a party and a bunch us had one and could barely unlock our teeth afterwards. People with dental work and braces beware.

Rating: 4
These bars don't know if they are a cookie or a candy but you won't care when you are eating them because they taste so good. I didn't realize that there was a typo in the recipe and only added one third cup powdered sugar to the crust--but it didn't seem to matter. Delicious!!

Rating: 4
I used walnuts and it was still a great recipe. Also, I wanted thinner diamonds, so I made it in a jelly roll pan. Cooking time seemed to be about the same. I've never made this without being asked for the recipe.

I brought these bars to a party and everyone loved them, they were all gone in fifteen minutes. People were asking me for the recipe. I looked up the recipe in the magazine and used 2/3 cup powdered sugar in the crust. These would be great for Christmas gifts.

big success and easy to make. a great holiday or any day recipe. a couple of people commented that it was easier to cut into squares. Just cut straight across (horizontally) into 4 to 5 rows then cut on an angle instead of straight down when cutting vertically.

I searched for this recipe online after receiving many requests for it. It's excellent! However, I've noticed a typo in this version of the recipe...it states only half of the powdered sugar for the crust than the magazine's version. I believe the latter is correct since this was the what I used with much success.

Made these for Christmas and got lots of raves. Rich and delicious flavor without being too sweet. Easy to make too, but like the other reviewers, I didn't even try to make them into diamonds -- just cut them into small squares.

Rating: 4
I thought these were incredible. The topping tasted just like the inside of a really good turtle candy. I took the previous reviewer's advice and cut them into squares which worked very well. One could drizzle the top with a little melted chocolate if one wanted them to taste even more like turtles. It doesn't get much better than this!

These are really rich and tasty. The dough never really seemed to come together, but the crumbs in the pan did set into a crust. I tried to cut into diamonds, but ended up doing squares, as the narrow points seemed to crumble. Looked very pretty in paper baking cups.
