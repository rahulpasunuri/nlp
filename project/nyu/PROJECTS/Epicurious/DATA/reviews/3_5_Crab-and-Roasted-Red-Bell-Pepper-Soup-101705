Loved this recipe. Note to all of you- a little FYI that maybe will make you chuckle- when pureeing the mixture, PLEASE REALIZE THAT HOT LIQUIDS EXPAND. Because my kitchen was A MESS! :-)

Loved this soup, but agree it's more of a bisque. I love spice so I added cayenne pepper to give it some kick and can't wait to make it again.

I'm not quite sure why this recipe is called a soup...(lol) It really is just a bisque. It is a good bisque though. If you want more flavor out of this recipe, just reduce your broth (stock is the correct term for you culinary type) a little futher then called for.

Sautéing the shells enhances the flavor of the broth, that part works. But after all the labor involved in making this soup, it only tastes like a crab broth. This one didn't make the "keeper" file, there are too many other tasty soups out there to bother with this one again.

Made it for Christmas Eve for my family. Got great reviews. The next day, I put the leftovers in the blender for a change of texture and it was still great!

I had this soup at a friend's house and had to make it for my sister's baby shower. Although it is pretty labor intensive, it is worth it. It's rich and wonderful and had numerous requests for the recipe. I would make it again for a special occasion.

My husband liked this soup more than I did. I found getting the meat out of the crab to be a lot of work. Also, sauteing the shells didn't really seem to have a purpose. I never did reach the 'fragrant' stage.
