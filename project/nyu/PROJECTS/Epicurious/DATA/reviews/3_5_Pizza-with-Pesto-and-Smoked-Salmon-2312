The pie crust is greasy and gross. But, I confess, I'm a pizza snob. I've sampled pies from NY to Italy and so far I haven't found a homemade/store bought pre-made pizza dough that is really worthy. The toppings are good, but it definitely needs more basil as well as red onions and capers. Actually, you might as well skip the pie crust and just bake it on bagels.

i tried this with some slivers of marinated artichoke and red onion before cooking, then added the salmon and capers with a little lemon after. was light and very tasty, will definitely make again.

Great with the red onion and capers. My husand mentioned that he really liked the sauce; we usually just put regular pesto on our pizzas, but the ricotta favorably mellowed out the sauce.

First off, thanks to all the previous reviewers for your suggestions! I used a Pillsbury pizza crust rolled out thin, and found that a liberal addition of thinly sliced red onions to the toppings and a squeeze of lemon complemented the flavours of the pizza wonderfully.

I found that the pesto flavour was very harsh. We made it as written the first night and thought the pesto over powered the rest of the dish. The next night I made it without pesto, but threw some gorganzola and diced red onion in with the ricotta. Sprinkled some black olives on top and then baked. When it was out of the oven I added capers, smoked salmon and some lemon juice. We both agreed this was much better than the original recipe.

I have made this so many times and it is a hit but I always have to add to it. At the end I top it with some fine chopped red onion, capers, a squeeze of lemon, and extra chopped basil. Season with pepper.

Disappeared in a hurry. A real treat.

Four forks reserved for really amazing. We tried with pie crusts and and the "instant" refrigerated pizza dough rolled thin....we liked it both ways, but preferred the dough. The pie crusts were too greasy for our tastes. I always make extra to toss in a lunch the next day. This is an EASY favorite, but a bit dry, so serve with a nice crisp salad and/or sliced tomatoes.

This was great with the addition of some roasted red peppers. Also, I added the salmon BEFORE I baked it. I served it to my hubby with the "Garlicky Greek Salad" i found on this site--he absolutely loved it!

A great appetizer. I used Pillsbury pizza dough rolled very thin, and lost the pine nuts somewhere between store and kitchen. Guests raved and insist I do it again.

This recipe is fantastic, especially with homemade smoked salmon. It was easy to prepare,and unique enough that if you change the crust size, it makes a great appetizer. I would definitely make it again, and again, and again....!

I made this a while ago. It was delicious and quite easy. I will make it again now.
