Super-easy and quick to make with ingredients that are generally on-hand - best of all, very tasty!

Definitely had to add things to this recipe to keep it from being too bland, but the end result was quite good. I used more green olives, added a few black kalamata olives (to provide a little color), an achovy and capers. I think this gave it the kick it needed.

just made it for a party and it was a huge hit. used marinated artichoke hearts, a few extra olives, and extra walnuts, and omitted the lemon rind. i also didn't puree it, just chopped everything really finely. had a nice texture, good flavor, and even looked very nice. was great on sliced baguette - everyone wanted the recipe. enjoy!

Bland and too dry. Had to add olive oil so the tapenade would at least spread and not crumble. One of the more disappointing recipes I've found on this site.

The lemon overwhelms the other flavors. I'd omit the grated rind next time.

Very delicious. I had canned artichokes, not marinaded as so many have recommended, so I added a smidge more of olive oil and some dried crushed red pepper. Also put in double the fresh parsley and added 1/2 cup parmesean. Took advice below and heated between 1 and 2 cloves of garlic in the olive oil. Will serve on small rounds of crusty french bread. Will make again. Mmmmmm...

I would give this two forks, but my guests devoured this recipe, so three forks. Use marinated artichoke hearts and add a glove of garlic. I served it with pita chips.

Great recipe for a party. Easy to prepare and can be made the night before. Do use marinaded artichokes and add the garlic for extra flavoring.

Not a bad recipe at all - IF YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE IN THE REVIEWS!! However, I think that if I hadn't used marinated artichoke hearts or garlic, it would have been awfully boring. Also, I followed the advice of Hoboken (10/29/00) and heated, over low heat, the garlic in the 1 tablespoon olive oil. Making it ahead of time is a wise move.

I love this recipe! I've used it as is several times, for several parties, and have had many requests for the recipe. A great dairy-free option! Great on bruschetta or with rice crackers.

With two changes (using marinated artichoke hearts instead of plain canned and adding a small clove of garlic, minced) this was an instant hit, which is why I gave the recipe 3 forks instead of 4. Even my picky Dad raved about it. Excellent atop crostini.

I improvised with the items I had on hand and it was a real hit. No lack of flavor when I used marinated artichoke hearts (drained) and pimento stuffed green olives! I probably added slightly more lemon zest than was called for. It was easy, quick and delicious.

This recipe has become a staple in my file! Our family loves it. One neice eats it by the spoonful.

Bland and salty; not much else. To turn this a 'keeper'would take enough variations to make it a different recipe entirely.

It definitely needs garlic, but with that addition, I have received rave reviews from friends at several parties.

Great once I added 3 minced cloves of garlic! Also, I used a 12 oz. jar of marinated artichoke hearts because that is what I had on hand. Turned out great! Quick and easy; served on toasted baguette slices... KIMBER

Not sure why I didn't like this. I like all the ingredients, but the end result was just so-so.

Delicious and easy to make. I served this at a dinner club gathering and all of the guests enjoyed it, even those who like myself, are not huge olive eaters! I added 1 clove of crushed garlic and prepared 24 hours in advance as suggested by the other reviewers. This one stays in my files!

This was excellent!! Perfect as a fresh appetizer with some wine. I served it with some pita chips, which worked great, complimented the taste nicely.

I also added garlic to this recipe. I made this for a party and got raves and requests for the recipe. I think it improves with some aging, so make it at least 24 hours before you expect to serve it.

This was fantastic with white wine and grilled french bread slices. In fact, our guest took it upon himself to put the whole bowl in front of himself and devour it completely! Our only taste came in the kitchen before we took it out!

This is divine. Definite party hit and the bowls were empty of this one!

This is quite good. I thought the olives would be too dominant, but it was a nice mix of flavors. I did think it was improved by the addition of garlic.

Delicious and easy! I too added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and it was fabulous (and I don't even like olives). Should be made at least 2 hours ahead of time for better flavor.

I loved this. It was so simple to make and even easier to eat! I did add some garlic to kick it up a notch, but other than that it was wonderful and I will make it again.

Maybe I missed an ingredient, but I found this bland. Great texture, cool looking on a crostini (I even tried multi-grain baguette) -- but so-so. Hence, one fork.

This recipe was easy and really delicious, a great addition to a cheese platter. The one change we made was that we first heated a couple of cloves of garlic in the oil and added them to the mix. Wow!

The flavors blended well together...I was afraid the olives would overpower everything else, but the balance was perfect. I cut the recipe in half because there were three of us...plenty for three or four. I would DEFINITELY make this again, and wouldn't change anything. I made it about 3 hours ahead...next time will make it 1 day ahead to allow flavors to mature.
