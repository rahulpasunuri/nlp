The brownies were tasty. My roomates like most things that I cook or bake. So they gave it an A. I served it with homemade whip cream. I never measure anything when I bake, but these were so simple that it took less than 10 minutes before I tossed them in the oven. I doubled the recipe and it only took another 5-7 minutes in my oven before they were ocmpleted done.

I thought these were a good, quick way to satisfy a chocolate craving, and I would make them again. I used hazelnuts instead of almonds, because it was all I had. I think the results were OK, but I think I would have liked almonds better. My husband, on the other hand, gave them an "A+".

I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but these were REALLY good. Everyone, except my boyfriend, raved about them. He thought they were too dry, but that may be because he ate them 2 days later. I doubled the recipe, and had no problems. Next time though, I think I would add a bit of cinnamon.

These were the best brownies ever. The consistency was great, not too fudge-like, not too cakey. They also had somewhat of a "dark chocolate" taste that was out of this world. Will make them again soon.

Everyone loved these brownies! I quadrupled the recipe and it was a problem, very undercooked and too gooey!! I cooked them much longer than the recipe called for and then sliced them and cooked them an additional 20 mins. This made them a bit crunchy outside and fudgy inside (perfect).

I doubled this recipe but made the mistake of using a pan that was deeper rather than wider, trying for the chunky look. They did cook, eventually and after some beating down, and were still delicious. I was only disappointed there were no leftovers when the guests went home!

Very good! Wait until it really cools down, it was even better (fudgier, chewier) the next day after having been in the fridge! YUM!! Hoping he'll make some more soon!!

I love the recipe. The only thing I would change is quatruple the recipe instead of making on batch. I would not be enough.

This was a pretty good brownie but my family and friends preferred my "junk brownies" over all. To turn this recipe into a junk recipe, just add milk chocolate, mint chocolate or white chocolate chips (or all 3), peanut butter or butterscotch chips (or both)and 1/2 C chopped walnuts. After spreading the batter in the pan, swirl caramel and hot fudge sauce over the top and bake. Talk about heaven!!

Oh my goodness this is what a brownie should be!!! Main ingredient CHOCOLATE! Almonds for crunch and just a little bit of other stuff to hold it all together. Fabulous!
