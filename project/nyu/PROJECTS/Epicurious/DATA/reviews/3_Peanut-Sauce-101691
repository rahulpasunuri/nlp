This didn't come out with the consistency you'd hope for (even allowing for the shallot slices in it). I did some things to rescue this in the end to acceptability, but I think I'm going back to those peanut sauce recipes that have you start with the chunky-health-food peanut butter that has that wonderful starting consistency of mixed spackling paste. The texture in the end ends up significantly better than this.

It was good, but I've had better. And it made way too much sauce for the rib recipe.

This is not a horrible sauce by any means... however, the shallots just over powered the flavor and gave it a disticntly Indian flavor that I wasn't looking for. Some would enjoy it very much but I would cut the shallots in half at the least if not lose them altogether in favor of something more interesting.

also great with skewerd chickenbreast pieces, fried, grilled or on the bbq, first soak the wood skewers in water for half an hour. put the sauce on when the chicken is cooked.

I'd cut down on the peanut butter. Way too peanutty--it drowns out the other flavors!

I made this recipe for an Indonesian gourmet dinner. However, I took a shortcut and substituted the peanut oil and peanuts with creamy organic peanut butter. The result was absolutely delicious! An enthusiastic cook in Canada...

I was wondering how you would serve this dish until I clicked on the your photo. I tried the recipe and we found it to be delicious and tasty. Especially using your own faverite veggies to dip...! Thanks
