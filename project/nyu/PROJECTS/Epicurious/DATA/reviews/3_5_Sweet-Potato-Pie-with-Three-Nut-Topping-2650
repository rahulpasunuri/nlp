This pie is spectacular! A couple of ice cream stores in Concord MA make cinnamon ice cream. I serve it with that when it's available. If I can't find it, vanilla works well! Tonight, I am serving it with homemade whip cream spiked with vietnamese cinnamon! Can't wait!

I've been making this for Thanksgiving for years; now it's by demand rather than request. I myself am not very fond of it because it's so sweet, so I've tweaked it a little and heard no complaints. I use NO sweetening in the filling -- between the crust and the topping it gets overwhelming -- and I replace the honey in the topping with light Karo. I've also had used milk or part milk in place of the whipping cream. Even people who "don't like sweet potato pie" love this.

I was exceedingly excited to make this recipe. Don't be confused by only 2 forks. The truth is that the indivdual parts of this recipe are better than the sum of the pie. The crust, the filling, & the topping are very good but when you put them together they are just OK not outstanding as I had expected. I will not make this pie again but I might make the crust & I will for sure use the topping in other recipes (perhaps over gingerbread or icecream)

Every one raved about this pie. It will be at every Christmas from now on. I used a store bought crust from Whole Foods because of other reviewers remarks that it would be to sweet. It was perfect and I'd have to agree. I used raw nuts and toasted them a little and they were amazing. I am sure you could use any nut if you didn't like one from the mix. The topping was like nutty caramel and the filling rivals pumpkin. YUMMY!

Fabulous, the crust is one of the best & most innovative I have tasted. Also very simple to prepare. Didn't make the top thought it was sweet enough without it.

Delicious, Just a great pie for the holidays

I grew up eating sweet potato pie, and I've abandoned my family recipie for this. I often omit the nut topping (a bit too rich and tedious for me), but the flavor and texture are just awesome!

This is a wonderful recipe that's even better the second day. Everyone who tried it loved it. Not overly sweet, dense and nicely textured, perfectly spiced, and fun to make. And, I repeat, even better the second day....I had it for breakfast this morning.

This recipe was fantastic! It looks and tastes amazing. Everyone that tried this loved it, probably because this tastes more like pumpkin pie than other sweet potato pies that I've tried. Someone compared it to a combination pumpkin and pecan pie (I used almonds, walnuts and pecans for the topping, coarsly chopped). It sounds like it is time consuming, but really it isn't bad for the beautiful pie at the end! I baked the sweet potatoes the last time I prepared them for dinner, then peeled and froze them, which cut down the prep time by quite a bit.

I made this for the 1st time in 1992, when it was on the cover of one of the issues of Bon Appetit. Everyone liked it so much it has become a Thanksgiving family tradition to make and serve this. It is time consuming but well worth the effort. I make 4 of these at a time, keep one and give the rest to family and friends who can't join us for Thanksgiving. I have never had a complaint and it has become the "secret" family recipe.

This was a LOT of work. It was beautiful. But I noticed that while some of my guests loved it, several just picked at it. Which is a bummer considering how hard it is to make (and I had to make it twice because my dog ate the first one when I left it to cool. No joke.)

I'm in the Northwest, so many people at my family gathering were, unfortunately, afraid to try it. However, those that did try it were pleasantly surprised. It was QUITE tasty. Only downside was it was hard to cut because the nut top got too solid--probably my error.

I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THIS, BUT I DEFINITELY ENJOYED IT. MY FRIEND MADE THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I'LL BE MAKING IT NEXT WEEK FOR THANKSGIVING.

Since I do not like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, I modified the recipe somewhat. Used a Keebler 9 oz., 2 extra servings, graham cracker crust instead of making the nut crust. Made the filling exactly as stated, and it was excellent. Used the crumbs from a gingersnap pie crust (mixed with about 1/2 c. of pecans) for the topping--Thanks Martha Stewart for your recipe (on the web) for "Sweet Potato Pie with Gingersnap Crust". (I didn't get past making the gingersnap crust. After baking it you could see light through the glass pie plate, so I gave up on that recipe, and saved the crust's crumbs to use as the topping for this recipe.) The way I made this Bon Appetit recipe made it too sweet. Next time I would still use the graham cracker crust but delete any topping, and then it would be a quickish, easy pie. Since I modified the recipe sooo much, I have to give it 4 stars. Even the way mine turned out, I would still give it 3. DO TRY IT!!! THE FILLING IS EXCELLENT!!! BE CREATIVE!!!

I made this for a pot luck dinner (all items brought had to begin with S), and every single person who tried it was floored. I even caught one person scraping the crumbs off the pie plate. I used my own blend of spices rather than pumpkin pie spice, but other than that it was perfect.

I thought it was outstanding. I substituted pecans for the walnuts. Covered it with foil for the entire duration, but took it off towards the end because it was taking forever to set. I'll definitely make this one again!

This pie was great. I made a couple of substitutions that worked out fine. First, I made the crust in a 9 inch cheesecake pan. It popped off just fine and the crust held up to cutting. Second, I used half and half for the filling and that was great too. I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It's a winner!

the topping & crust really make this recipe & aren't nearly as time consuming as they sound. a very nice recipe.

This pie is pretty and the nut topping is great, but the pie itself was not worth the time. The crust became too dark while the filling took forever to set. The relatives still enjoyed it. I used pecans instead of walnuts also. Maybe my sister will try it again and see if she gets better results than I did.

This was my first sweet potato pie and it got rave reviews! The topping added a delicious twist. I may substitute pecans for walnuts the next time I make it. Overall, I was impressed with the results - it will most likely become a traditional treat I make every holiday.

I've made this recipe twice and I would say it is now an official tradition with both sides of my family. Everyone loves it. It is rather time consuming, but definately worth it

For the one who gave it "1 fork", you must not be able to follow a recipe! Wow! I've taken gourmet cooking for years from an internationally known cookbook author & restaurant owner, and none of her desserts compared to this pie! After reading the ratings, I used pecans and I also used foil over it the whole time it was baking & the crust was perfect!! Someone else didn't do the carmelized topping. DUH! That's what makes it!! EXCELLENT!!! I will make this pie a lot and plan on making it for friends as a gift! Very, very good!!!!!

I've made this pie several times and win new fans with every iteration. It's a standard at our house at Thanksgiving.

This is one of the few things I make in the kitchen. Since i've never liked pumpkin pie I decided to try this on instead and have been making it for every Thanksgiving ever since the recipe was published in 1992 and it's gotten nothing but rave reviews. I have used pecans instead of walnuts though, since I can't stand walnuts.

My first time making a sweet potato pie and I thought it was very good. I especially liked the crust! I didn't get around to making the topping and the pie was still very good. I would serve it in place of pumpkin anytime. (although I couldn't tell much of a difference between the two types of pies?)

pay no attention to the one fork rating of the previous reveiwer, this is a one of a kind pie. I made this for guests at the restaurant, and they absolutly loved it. Some had it for dessert, took some home, and then came back the next day just for the pie. This is a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. The pie was gorgeous - but I was very disappointed in the taste. I followed the recipe every step of the way.....

I also used pecans in place of the hazelnuts for this pie and was very much impressed with the results. The texture of the filling was smooth and dense with a wonderful contrasting crunchy nut topping. Everyone who tasted this pie (many of which having hard to please palates) loved it.

The topping (carmalized nuts)was difficult to slice through. Next time I would place the topping onto individual pieces right before serving. Otherwise delicious.

I made this for my husband's family reunion -- they're all primarily southerners & absolutely *adored* this pie. It was also my first time making it -- I found it to be a little time consuming, but not difficult! It's going into the "family heirlooms" recipe book!!

This recipe has been a Thanksgiving favorite in my family since 1992. Everyone loves it. I have used pecans in the past to substitute for hazelnuts.
