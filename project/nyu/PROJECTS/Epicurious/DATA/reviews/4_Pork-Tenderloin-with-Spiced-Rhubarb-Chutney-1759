This recipe was a huge hit! I doubled it, as I had six adults to feed and wanted some leftovers. I also had a moment of panic because not a single grocery store in my area had rhubarb in yet. I subbed with Granny Smith apples and cranberries instead - 2/3 apples to 1/3 cranberries. I ended up using 6 cups of diced apple and 2 cups of cranberries. It came out wonderfully, I will be making this chutney again!!

This was a successful dish and easy to do ahead (I made the chutney in the am and did the pan searing and basting about 20' before putting it in the oven). The grocery only had enough rhubarb for 3 cups so I added a cup of peeled chopped apples which probably made it sweeter and more autumnal than intended but I was glad to have the suggestion of apples from other reviewers. I think the base might work with other fruits (peaches perhaps) as well.

Perfect example of using rhubarb for something OTHER than dessert. Absolutely delish and worth making again, might cut back on the sugar though.

One of the worst recipes I've made in my life. The only redeeming factor was that I served it only to my husband and myself, and not to other guests. Yes, I like rhubarb - but this recipes just doesn't work. Flavors were off - there wasn't a cohesiveness to it. Also tried it with chicken, as recommended. unfortunately, I can't 't even add the chutney to the compost pile, since it includes sugar. A waste of time, energy and money. I would give this a negative fork review, if possible - there isn't even a half fork option.

DEEEEELICIOUS!!! This chutney is incredible. I'm going to have to make some more and do some canning as gifts. It's really great with the pork loin (which we grilled on the barbeque after pan searing). Highly recommend this one just as it is.

Unbelievably delicious!! I had enough rhubarb for 1 1/2 times the recipe. How I wish I had lots more. Easy to make, easier to eat!! Now I'm ready for dinner guests on Sunday with the tenderloin waiting....

YUM. I didn't have enough rhubarb, so I used apples and I replaced the cherries with cranberries. Four of us demolished over a kilo of pork. The left over chutney made amazing toasted sandwiches with ham and camembert the next day. Will definitely be making it again soon!!!!

Excellent!! I made it with what was called for. Once I tasted it I remade it (doubling the recipe) the same night and canned several jars. Gave all those jars away, and will make it as soon as I pick more Rhubarb, I even tried it with chicken and that was very good also. Canning didn't hurt it at all.

We got a lot of rhubarb from our CSA share and I made this, it was delicious with the pork and just as good with chicken breasts. I stirred some of the left over chutney into my greek yogurt the next morning and loved that too.

Double or triple the recipe for this chutney; you'll want to eat it with a spoon as a side dish. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and it came out fine. It had a bit of a bite and would have been just as good with less red pepper.

The spiced rhubarb chutney from this recipe pairs absolutely beautifully with smoked salmon cakes! The next time I make this, however I will reduce the cinnamon to half but only because I'm not big on cinnamon. Can't wait to try this with the pork tenderloin next!

Fantastic! We use dried cranberries and substitute as cranberry sauce when we have turkey dinners. Yum yum! We are canning it this year for friends & relatives - just that good!

I made this exactly as directed and it was ridiculously easy and delicious. When I served it--to company--my husband was sure that he wasn't going to like it, but he ended up loving it. He kept exclaiming about "the great flavors" it had. I will definitely make this again.

LOVED this chutney! We have a bumper crop of rhubarb in our yard, and I was surfing recipes. I had fresh cherries on hand, so used those (about 1 cup) in lieu of the dried . I wasn't thrilled with the roasted pork tenderloin - next time I think I'll grill it. But the chutney is just outstanding!

I made a few modifications to this recipe, but overall it was very good! I followed the chutney recipe for the most part, but being fall I substituted apples and fresh figs for the rhubarb and went with the dried cherries as opposed to raisins. Since I did not use the rhubarb it was on the sweeter side, I probably could have reduced the sugar and/or increased the vinegar to make a tarter chutney (though I loved it as is.) It turned out beautifully! I did serve this with pork tenderloin, but I did not use the cumin and hickory smoked it on the grill instead. The chutney also goes well with chicken! Excited to taste the chutney again tomorrow after the flavors have melded further. Give this one a try!

Yes, a 4 fork meal! We were surprised how much we loved this (made only to use up rhubarb). We do love cumin but thought the cumin flavour was not that obvious here so don't be put off by others' reviews. I used currants instead or raisins. Can't wait to make again (and we rarely make anything twice). My husband is still walking around the house going "MMmm-mmm" over it an hour later!

Excellent flavor - used an apple in the chutney as I had only about 3 cups rhubarb. Loved the cumin flavor. The color of the chutney was not very appetizing but tasted great!

Very good. Due to the season, I was forced to use frozen rhubarb and it worked just fine. The chutney is yummy. I might try eliminating the cumin next time form the pork rub because the flavor is very distinct and not appreciated by all.

I made the chutney to serve with cold chicken. It was delicious and quite simple to make. I added some additional brown sugar (about 1/4 cup), because it was a little too sour; I also needed to cook it longer to achieve a texture I was pleased with. It was a huge hit at a summer dinner party!

For a summer alternative I used salt, pepper and cumin as a rub and grilled the pork. Spooned the chutney over the pork to serve. Easy preparation with gourmet results!

I've only made the chutney and thought it was quite tasty (albeit alone). I'll serve it with grilled boneless turkey. I cut way back on the sugar, which makes it quite tart, which I like.

We make the rhubarb chutney all the time and freeze it. The pork recipe is not my favorite - try Tender Pork Tenderloin by Sheila Lukins on this site with the chutney. I always double the recipe (note increased cooking time for a big batch) and cut the cloves in half. The cloves really develop if you have leftover chutney, although it's fine if you eat it the same day. I prefer the chutney a little chunky, so I've experimented with cutting some slightly larger chunks. We prefer the dried cherries - sometimes we mix some dried cranberries.

The chutney makes the dish. I was unable to find rhubarb in New York during January. So, I substituted the rhubarb with grannysmith apples and also added dried cherries. It was great!

This recipe was OK. My wife and I found that the cumin over powered the dish. I would recommend not seasoning the pork with cumin and cut back the amount in the chutney. The cumin was so strong we could not distingish any of the other ingredients.

I have tried this now 3 times, searing the pork with roasted coriander, that I ground lightly, and with cumin. I actually prefer the coriander. The rhubarb chutney is good, but I have also made pear chutney for it and prefer the pear. I guess by this time, all I'm talking about is the method, not the recipe.

Very delicious but we didn't care for the way the pork looked when serving. (not very child-friendly presentation) I think I'll simply roast the seasoned/seared pork tenderloins and serve the yummy spiced rhubarb sauce on the side when I make it again.

I really liked this although I couldn't find any rhubarb! So I made it with cranberries instead and it worked out well. Very simple and pretty.

The Rhubarb Chutney makes this dish, and goes well with many other meats (turkey, chicken, pork chops). I tried one variation where I used a little pureed razberries to give it a more festive red color for serving during the Christmas holidays.

This dish rocks! I have made this numerous times. In fact, I make the chutney in the spring with fresh rhubarb from the garden and can it. That way, it is so easy to open a jar during the winter and takes only minutes to prepare. I use Chinese Five Spice Powder instead of cumin when first braising the pork.

wonderful for dinner parties with potatoes au gratin (use gruyere, butter and milk with breadcrumbs on bottom and top). the pork is tender, succulent and very flavorful and the chutney sets it off beautifully. Great spring recipe. I use either fresh or frozen rhubarb.

I must confess I have not tried the pork part of this recipe but we love the rhubarb chutney. I make large batches of it and can it while still hot. My friends always ask if they could have another jar the next time I make it. It's a good job we have an abundance of rhubarb in the garden.

I loved this recipe!!! It took only moments to prepare, most of the ingredients are in the pantry (which keeps costs down) and yet it had a definite star quality. I will try this for my next dinner party. Chutney was quite chunky - I may blend it into a sauce next time. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and it was very evocative of Christmas and mulled wine with that cloves/cinnamon/cranberry mixture. It was a lot shorter time in the oven than the recipe suggested - I used a meat thermometer to check pork temperature. A lovely mid-week winter dish for tired cooks.

I made this last week for Easter Sunday with friends. It was great. Made the chutney ahead and followed cooking/basting instructions as written. I couldn't believe how good it was! While making the chutney I was afraid the cumin taste would be too overwhelming, but cooked with the pork it was just fine. Friends loved it. Served with roasted asparagus and lemon rice (old Time-Life cookbook recipe). Yummy AND Springy!!!

I am always looking for rhubarb recipes - my parents have over 100 rhubarb plants - and this one is excellent!! I left out the cilantro, as it is hard to find in England, and I thought it would detract from the chutney.

I was slightly concerned with the ingredients but was very impressed at how well everything married together. The company directors that I cooked it for were equally impressed. I made up a gravy/sauce by liquidising 1/3 of the chutney and sieving it and thinning it with chicken stock.

Excellent recipe! The chutney is awesome - we made extra to use throughout the week! I made this recipe for a crowd: I pre-browned the meat, then put it all in the refrigerator for a few hours, with a little chutney on top. When the time was right, I continued baking the meat. I forgot to baste it, but it came out tender anyway. It was a hit! Try this recipe!!!

Wow! I wasn't a rhubarb fan before, but I can't say that anymore. The chutney and the pork were delicious together - a great spring dinner. I hope the chutney works with frozen rhubarb, because we wouldn't want to wait until next spring to have this again. The recipe is certainly worthy of all the accolades.

This dish is great! So quick and easy that you can make it for a weeknight meal. The chutney has a wonderfully spicy flavor and could be used in a lot of different ways. I made brown rice as an accompaniment and mixed some of the chutney into the rice--delicious! This evening I think I'll serve the chutney on a cracker spread with cream cheese as an appetizer.

This recipe was awesome! We have made it twice now in 2 weeks. We grilled the pork on our BBQ which gave the meat a nicey crispy, sticky glaze from the chutney.
