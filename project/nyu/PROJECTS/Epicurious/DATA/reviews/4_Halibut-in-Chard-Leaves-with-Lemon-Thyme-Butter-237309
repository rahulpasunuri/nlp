This is my "go to" recipe for halibut. All the ingredients accentuate the flavor of the halibut. If Swiss chard is not available, you can place the halibut in parchment paper or foil. If you have extra Swiss chard (I prefer the rainbow variety), cut the stems 3/4 - 1 inch slices crosswise, and saute in some olive oil or butter, until crisp/tender. Add a tablespoon or so of the lemon/herb butter used for the fish, if there is any left over, and then add the chopped chard leaves and cook until tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Makes a great side dish.

I've also successfully grilled the halibut wrapped in chard. Just don't leave the ends of the chard open and the fish will remain moist. Also, don't grill over direct flames.

Big disappointment. Followed the recipe exactly; we all thought it was rather bland. I don't think I'll make it again.

Tasteless with over-cooked fish and under-cooked chard.

Delicious, needed less than half of the butter portion so saved it to serve with pita the next day. Very flavorful. Don't know why people say it's bland. Highly recommended!

This dish didn't make a big splash at my house. Could've been the quality of herbs or fish that I used. I bought previously frozen wild caught fish at Ralphs. One way to make sure you're eating sustainable fish is by checking the "Monterey Bay Aquariam Sustainable Seafood Guide" -There's an iphone app for it too!

WONDERFUL. Delicate and uniquely flavored (not bland at all!), and light, yet satisfying. We used rainbow chard that was fairly young, but we used several leaves for each piece. The chard imparts a lovely flavor to the fish and is delicious to eat as the side vegetable. (wouldn't go for lettuce as a substitute).

Succulently moist and tasty fish. Used beet greens instead of chard and wrapped the whole thing in parchment paper. The cooking time needed to be extended a bit, 18 minutes at 450 worked for me. I removed the paper before plating and topped the fish with tiny Shiitake mushroom and finely minced Walla Walla sweet onions sauteed until golden brown. This added a bit of texture and depth to the dish. Those of you who found this recipe a bit bland may want to give it a second chance with this suggestion.

I've made this multiple times. Fairly easy to prepare and always a hit. I've made the butter with dried herbs--not as good as fresh, but it works if that's all you've got on hand.

I made this recipe with a bed of baby rainbow chard rather than the large tougher leaves, as it is still early in the growing season here, and I was able to get some good stuff at the farmers' market. I also made an herb emulsion with olive oil instead of butter and doubled the hers and lemon peel/juice. Worth it! Because of the sparse amount of chard made with the dish, I served it alongside some sauteed baby rainbow chard with sliced garlic, red pepper flakes and olive oil, which went well with the juice from the bottom of the foil..... Still Drooling!

this is a very good and simple dish. the only thing i did different was use garlic salt when salting the fish.

i made this with redfish i caught, otherwise by the recipe, except i used parchment instead of foil. good. the times were very accurate for me--12 minutes. needed aggressive salting, lemon juice. extremely easy, but nothing special. great for a weeknight.

Delicious! I didn't have chard, but lettuce worked fine. Used a little less butter, lots of lemon zest.

Super Fast and great flavor - I went with an 8 oz. size/18 min. w/ butter lettuce and it was perfectly cooked.

Um, wow. This is really, really good. Light, herby, very fresh. The sauce is perfect and doesn't overpower the taste of the fish. I used butter lettuce just because it sounded better to me, and it was fantastic.

This one is a keeper. Really simple and delicious. And a bravo to CPOREMSK from San Francisco for reminding us to eat SUSTAINABLE FISH and to buy from SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES! Remember, there is not now and never was any surplus in nature. Be kind to the earth, her systems & creatures...

This was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly. Other than the initial stress of wondering if you are wrapping these properly (don't overthink it, just place the piece of fish and roll it) it was an easy and delicious dish that looks like you put a lot of effort into it.

Oh My Gosh! This was fantastic. Made it just as the recipe stated, but made a few smaller portions for the kids around the table. All gobbled it up, from age 8 to age 80. Used parchment for a prettier table presentation.

Halibut will never again grace my grill pan. This is an amazingly easy and effective preparation for halibut and Chilean sea bass. I also garnish with red and green peppers inside the "package" and take the drippings out of the packages, simmer quickly, and make a light lemon butter cream sauce to the serve with the fish. It is easy, fast, and delicious. The only thing that I disagree with in terms of this preparation is the idea of having aluminum foil on a plate. I take mine out and serve it traditionally. Getting the fish out of the foil without breaking it can be problematic, though, so I'm trying to come up with a metal "base" for the pockets of fish to allow for easy and whole removal.

This is absolutely fantastic, and nearly fool-proof. I've made for company three times, and always received rave reviews. The best part is that most of the prep (making the butter, etc.) can be done in advance, which makes it perfect for dinner parties. Follow the recipe exactly, and you'll be thrilled.

I also found that the cooking time is more like 18 minutes. I made this twice, once with monkfish which I thought was really delicious.

i must be missing something or did something wrong. this was nice but not all that flavorful. and i did use the full amount of butter.

This is really really moist. Next time I would cut back a bit on the thyme--especially if using fresh out the garden. It can be a bit too pungent and overwhelm the fish,.

Beautiful dish, impressed my company. Only change I would make would be to cook it a little less. I cooked for 13 minutes and it was slightly overcooked. My portion sizes were 6 oz, so maybe for 8 oz portions this timing would work.

The best halibut we have EVER had. The second time we made it I added a small tomato slice for color and wrapped it in parchment paper then with foil. Remove the foil before serving. The parchment paper packages give a nice presentation on the plate. Beet leaves also work.

This was really great. I have made it twice now. The second time I cut the butter in half and it was just as delicious. You definitely don't need all the butter if you want to make it a little healthier.

Oh My Gosh!!! This was unbelievably tasty! I'm not a fan of swiss chard, so I was looking for a new way to prepare the massive amounts of chard that our neighbor brought over. This was so easy, and the fish literally melted in my mouth. It is one of the most flavorful fish dishes that I have ever experienced. I will make this again and again for both weekday dinners at home and fancy dinner parties.

The recipe makes excellent fish, but I would make two suggestions. The first is that the time for cooking is too short. We checked the fish at 14 minutes, and it was nearly 80% raw inside. We have a Viking range set at 450 degrees. We cooked it for 10 more minutes, and it was done. Perhaps cooking for 18 to 20 minutes may have been better. However, our fish was stored in the refrigerator after preparation before baking, so that may have contributed to the longer cooking time. Second, we used less of the butter, trying to save calores/fat. Don't do this. Use it all. It tastes much better with more butter.

This is now one of our "show off" dishes, and we always get rave reviews from guests. And the best is that out here in the Western US, you can buy SUSTAINABLY HARVESTED Pacific Halibut at better stores. Why is this important? According to the Monterey Bay Seafood Project, "Most Pacific halibut are caught either in Alaska or off the west coast of Canada with bottom longlines... In Alaska, fishing for Pacific halibut is strictly limited to this bottom longlining method. Bottom longlining causes little habitat damage and has low bycatch associated with it. In both the U.S. and Canada, [an] allocation process has resulted in creating longer fishing seasons, while keeping the population healthy."

this recipe is excellent and quite easy to make. I eased off on the butter and it was still delicious esp since the herbes are readily available from my garden

Moist, fragrant and delicious! I didn't have chives, but otherwise followed as written. Used crusty bread to soak up all the juices.

I had chard but not most of the other ingredients. So I used snapper, margarine, herbs de Provence and spring garlic. I served it with pasta and thinly sliced parmesan. Even my two-year old liked it!

Nothing new to add except that this was a terrifically flavorful and easy to make dish. And I usually don't like halibut.

3.5, Very good, I added tons more chard so it can be a meal in its self but it took longer to cook. So next time I will have the fish fully covered with chard and make a separate foil bag with extra chard, spread and lemon slices as well and put that in the oven first for 10 minutes then add the foiled fish for it's time. Wanted to take a photo but it smelled so good I forgot and ate it.

Fantastic! A perfect blend of flavors. I added a dab of truffle butter. Very easy and quick to make. My husband said it was the best halibut he's ever had.
