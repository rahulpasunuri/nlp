This is a wonderful topper to a light, fresh meal on a hot summer day. Extra care should be taken with the caramel as too dark will cause the sauce to harden when poured warm over ice cream. We threw in a little Captain Morgan spiced rum (all we had) and the sauce was still delicious. We also bought fresh tropical fruits - mango, papaya, banana - and mixed in a little canned pineapple as well. Excellent!
