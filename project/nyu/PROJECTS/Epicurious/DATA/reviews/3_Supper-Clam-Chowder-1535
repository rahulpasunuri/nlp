Not the best..that's for sure. Didn't even taste the clams..very boring.

I was so excited to try this and was very dissapointed. I tried cutting back the Thyme. Even the addition of salt and pepper didn't help and I couldn't taste the clams, the corn or even a hint of bacon. I just checked to make sure I didn't leave anything out and I didn't. Oh Well

I've been searching for a great Clam Chowder recipe for a while now, but this isn't it. One of my sons loved it, one hated it, and I thought it was good, but nothing special. I agree with others that the addition of cream-style corn makes this a different animal enitrely (I followed their advice and only put in one 15 oz. can, which was more than enough. I can't imagine how overpowering it would have been with two!). As for the "colorful" description above, well...sure, if you consider grey/brown colorful. Dissappointing.

I agree with the cook from McLean, VA. This soup was a cross between a clam and corn chowder. The flavor was good, but next time I'll either leave the corn or the clams out. I thought that the flavor of the clams were masked by the corn. If you are wanting a traditional clam chowder, this recipe is not for you.

I have yet to make this recipe, but was served it at a party yesterday - wow!!! It is a wonderful version of clam chowder that is hearty enough to make a meal with perhaps a salad on the side.

Fantastic lower-fat version of a favourite dish. I reduced the corn as recommended by other reviewers and added a bit of skim milk to increase the liquid. I also let it simmer a bit longer to allow the flavours to develop more. Very yummy. I served this with corn bread and it went over quite well.

great chowder. i used 1 can of cream corn instead of 2 and cut the amount of thyme in half. i also used half and half instead of milk. i'll definitely make this again!

This soup was wonderful! It is more of a corn chowder and I might even leave the clams out next time I make it, but it was delicious.

Always a hit. Many have said it was the best chowder they have ever had. Taste better with half the amount of thyme.

Loved the simplicity. Would make it again with fresh creamed corn. The thyme was good but did use a smaller amount than suggested---just a little less.

This chowder has become a family favorite. Unfortunately, we are not as fat conscious as we should be and I substitute half & half or cream for the milk. If you are using dried thyme, you may want to cut the quantity somewhat or it becomes a little overpowering. This one is a keeper!!

The creamed corn is critical. Don't use a cheap brand. Whole milk is needed. Red bell pepper makes a nice presentation. Surprise for a non-traditional clam chowder.

I liked this dish, but found the corn a little excessive. A little less corn and a little more cream may have done the trick.

Be sure when making this recipe to use creamed corn that does not have added sugar. It makes the soup too sweet. Otherwise this is very good, even my kids liked it.
