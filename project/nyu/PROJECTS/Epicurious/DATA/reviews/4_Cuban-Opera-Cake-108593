I am not an expert baker - but I am proud to say that I wow'ed my friends with this cake - which was delicious and beautiful. I followed the recipe for the cake (used godiva liquer) and my mousse was perfect (no changes to the recipe). I put the mousse in the fridge for a couple of hours before I layered it into the cake. I made some changes to the buttercream - used mostly dark chocolate - and had to add some cream because it was too stiff with the corn syrup. delicious. I followed prior advice to place the first and second layer then refrigerate for a while before placing the last two layers. Refrigerated the whole thing over night in the springform pan. The most significant change I made was for the "glaze" - It was a very rich cake and I wanted something lighter. Put a layer of light cocoa whipped cream and then a very fine layer of milk chocolate ganache. (mostly because the whipped cream frosting just didn't look pretty) It was a hot day and it sat out for hours at the party - I was imagining it would have melted or that the mousse would lose all shape. Nope - perfect - easy to cut - beautiful layers - and so good! Takes a lot of time - but that's part of the fun of pulling it off. It was an adventure - and I will make it again!!

Really delicious! The cake is moist and light, the coffee mousse is fantastic and the buttercream is rich and chocolatey (but definitely buy a good quality milk chocolate to keep the end product from being too sweet, or add some unsweetened cocoa/chocolate). I *did* have trouble with the mousse not setting up properly, but that could have been something I did. And it still tasted great! The only changes I made to the recipe were to use a standard ganache recipe in place of the glaze, and to cut the cake into six layers rather than four (with three layers of buttercream and two of mousse in between). Will definitely make again.

I have reviewed this recipe before. I have a few 'tips' to speed along the process of making this exquisite cake. This is cake that leaves everyone speechless...it is so beautiful and so delicious. Here's a pic http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/noZorTBJ36GH3CbDc2O9dLiNUkZd3WMiMptAAmHLZWs?feat=directlink Now, here are my "Tips" Tip 1: With the buttercream, glaze and coffee mousse---use a metal/copper pan set in a bowl of ice water to speed the beat-to-cool phases on each of these. For the glaze, be careful as it will set up quickly. You will save yourself much beating/waiting time (even with the mixer) by employing this. Tip 2: For the mousse&.I put the mousse on one layer (rather than assembling with the other three) as follows: Put the mousse on one layer, spreading to the edges. Then put in the freezer for about 10 minutes. This allows the mousse to stiffen up. When you put the second layer on it, it will maintain stability, and not get squishy. You now can advance a step in the process&see Tip 3&. Tip 3: When assembling the buttercream on top of the 1st layer (then but your top/bottom mousse filled duo on top of that), then cover 3rd layers with butter cream). Go ahead and put the 4th layer on top of that. Because the mousee is set, and the buttercream is stable, your cake will be fine. Tip 4: Use the remainder buttercream to put a skim coating on the sides of the cake. This truly allows the final glaze to be even. I filled in the crevices on the mousse layer and of course the buttercream layers. It really makes a difference on the glaze layer, and you dont end up with any bumps on the side of your cake.

this cake is really delicious and totally worth the time & effort. there's nothing particularly difficult about it- just a lot of steps, that- if timed and spaced right- don't add up to a big job. for the "instant coffee" portion in the mousse i just use that international foods cafe vienna stuff, which tastes fine and means i don't have to keep sanka in my larder. don't skip the refrigerating process for the glaze- if it's not sufficiently hardened it'll just dribble off the cake and pool around the base. and allow plenty of refrigerating time post-glaze to let the sucker set. this cake is a stunner, very impressive, and really, really good. my sister even identified it as her "religion" on facebook...

This is the most exceptional cake Ive ever made. It is stunning, and tastes divine. Quite an investment of time and ingredients, but pretty easy to work with. Only substitution was Kahlua for crème de cacao. Mousse was too thin to spread, so I chilled before layering it on the cake. Note, you will only use about ½ the amount of buttercream that you make by using ¾ cup per layer. I barely used any glaze. The sides of my cake would have needed significant trimming in order to be flat enough to be covered by glaze, so instead, I made a chocolate band (recipe on this site in Irish Cream Mousse Cake) to cover the exterior. It was gorgeous! But it also cut down significantly on the amount of glaze needed. I ended up just using it on the top, and then piped extra buttercream along the bottom border. Although this is so over-the-top in the ingredients, the cake is actually a perfect balance, and really not at all too rich although a small slice is very satisfying. I was able to serve 18 with it at a dinner party. The slices cut and served beautifully.

I was not at all impressed. The mousse was not stiff enough so it made cutting very difficult. Also the glaze was not thick enough so it made a huge mess. Not a pretty presentation but if cut in the kitchen and served with a drizzle of the glaze it was much nicer. The cake was just so so but I will definitely take the buttercream recipe and use it elsewhere. Sorry I spent so much on the chocolate.

Fabulous recipe! It was rich with chocolate, the coffee mousse was perfect and the cake moist. I would suggest: 1. Making all the components except the glaze the day before. 2. Refrigerating it before assembly. This will allow the different layers to stand out rather than being absorbed into the cake. 3. Rather than slicing the cake in half I sliced each cake into thirds and made a six layer cake. 4. Did not have the Creme de Cacao, so I doubled the lukewarm coffee. 5. Did not have the right size springform pan, so instead I folded some aluminum foil and made a heavy duty band and wrapped it around the cake. Then chilled it overnight. 5. Let the cake chill after the first pouring of glaze and then re- glaze it. There is plenty of chocolate glaze!!! We made hot chocolate and even used it on some eclairs. 6. I doubled the coffee mousse, because it complimented the chocolate so well! Enjoy!!!

I've made this cake at least a dozen times for various occasions, and always to rave reviews! The hard part is convincing people that they really *don't* want the recipe, because it is lengthy, and although it's not difficult, it is intimidating for those who aren't familiar with baking. I've gone on to create variations of it with lemon cake, raspberry mousse or lemon/raspberry curd, and white chocolate glaze and buttercream. Always a hit!

For all the work involved, I thought this cake was so-so. I was expecting something with a bit more chocolate flavor. There are much simpler cakes that achieve the same effect as this one. Also found the coffee mousse to be too gelatinous, not as pillowy as had hoped. Not worth the calories.

I was making the coffee mousse and it got a bit like scrambled eggs if this happens can i still mix it into the whipped cream or has it turned? Also, why does this happen? Can this cake be frozen?

Agree - this is a terrific cake. Unlike some, I didn't find this difficult or overly time-consuming. Like others, I used Kaluha. I also cut back the sugar in the buttercream - I didn't use the corn syrup and about 1/3 cup of sugar. The result was good! Also, on the glaze - I didn't want it to be very thick on the cake so I didn't wait the two hours but was sure that the cake was very cold when I poured it. I also added some Kaluha to the glaze to cut the intensity of chocolate. (I'd run out of bittersweet chocolate & so use a few ounces of milk chocolate and about 9 ounces of dark chocolate to get to the 12 ounces.) My one mistake was that I didn't use as much of the mousse in the cake as I should have. Instead I served the extra on the side. That worked out well and avoided the problem that others reported of the cake not cutting well.

I didn't rate this because I didn't make the entire cake. I made the cake part, which was very good. The creme de cacao is definitely noticeable. I also made the chocolate glaze, which turned out a little thinner than I would have liked. In order to coat the cake, I had to pour it on several times, which makes a HUGE mess. I can see why the people who put all of the components of the cake together thought that the cake was very rich. I don't think I plan to try it that way, but I may make the cake again.

yes, keeping it refrigerated only helps it stay firm. 2-3 days-you'll be fine. i prefer it to sit and 'gel' overnight actually

I used semisweet chocolate and kahlua in place of creme de cacao. I baked the cake for 25 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and let the cake cool in the oven with the door open to prevent falling. I inverted one of the cake pans I used, and put a double layer of tin foil around it instead of dirtying a springiform pan. I refrigerated overnight with no issues, and the next day transferred the cake to a cake stand lined in ample wax paper. I put the glaze over the cake, then pulled away the wax paper for a mess-free clean up. The cake was a huge hit. I had a ton of extra chocolate glaze and coffee mousse that I served on the side with each slice of cake. It was a huge hit.

This is basically my favorite cake recipe. I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it for a bridal shower. It was tasty but funny- looking. The mousse did not set and the cake became more and more lopsided as the evening wore on. Now when I'm craving this I skip the glaze and instead just layer the cake with the mousse (being sure to let it set overnight!) and frost it with the buttercream. I usually make the buttercream with semisweet chocolate because the milk chocolate is too sweet for my taste.

I prepared this cake for my husband's 50th birthday. It was a huge hit. It is a lot of work and it is very rich but well worth the effort. I have also made a quick version of the cake by using whipped cream flavoured with coffee for the filling and finish off with the glaze. Delicious and takes much less time!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday last year and it was a big hit. Since it was just the two of us, I halved the recipe. I baked the cake in a 9"x5" loaf pan and cut it into four layers. It worked great! We got a lot of servings out of it since it is so rich. His birthday is here again, so I am making the cake another time. I can't wait to have some! FYI- the cake freezes well if you have lots of leftovers.

I'm an ambitious cook, but this one is too much for me. This is the most time consuming recipe I've made from the site. Every component tastes good, but you have to get each and everyone exactly right and be hanging around to combine it in at exactly the right time. Since simpler cakes taste nearly as good and my French husband was annoyed that this looks "nothing like a gateau opera" I'll be leaving this one to the bakeries!

I did not have good luck with the cake part of this recipe. It fell for me as it did for other reviewers. I think it might work better with less baking soda or with baking powder. I covered it with a ganache frosting instead of the glaze it calls for.

Rating: 4
I simply love this cake!! However I had to try making it 3 times before I got it right. You need patience when making this dessert. Also This cake is so rich that you might what to keep the main course light. (not a lot of heavy sauces etc) That was my mistake, I made a very heavy main course and then to add this cake was to much. Over all I love the cake though, and my guests loved it as well. I also made one and served it at a traditional English High Tea.

Rating: 3
Extremely rich - I can see how chocolate lovers enjoy this cake. Because of the richness though, it serves many more than suggested - I fed about 20 people well. I substituted Kahlua for the creme de cacao, and it worked quite well. Also, the amount of ganache is a touch too much. Impressive cake, but too rich for our tastes.

I have made this recipe twice. Once for a NY's Eve dinner party and then for my son's birthday by request. It is quite a production, and I was so impressed with a few of the reviewers who said they tackled this cake as a "first-time-from-scratch" endeavor. It is absolutely extraordinary and worth the work, and as others have noted, patience is not only a virtue, but a requirement with this recipe. I have NEVER made a finer dessert than this--and I've made plenty. It will be a staple at dinner where you want to shower your guests with a treat that they'll not likely get anywhere else.

Everyone at our dinner party loved this cake. It's incredibly rich. I served 10 that night and still had leftovers (I cut the cake in 16ths). Also, I subbed splenda for one half the sugar in the cake and non-fat yogurt for the sour cream. I'm sure no one noticed with all the other butter and sugar in this recipe. The cake came out fine--it didn't fall.

This was my first time making a cake from scratch. The cake fell some shortly after removing it from the oven, and was a lot of work, but was really, really good! The coffee mousse was so good it would make a nice dessert by itself. Very rich, can't eat much in one sitting.

This cake was delicious and I would make it again. The cake,frostings, etc.were all excellent and I had no problems there.The only problem I had was cutting the cake. The mousse squashed out from the cake. I ended up using a serrated knife that I placed in hot water and that helped some but was very difficult to cut. Maybe I had the ganache too hard? Any other recommendations?

This cake came out delicious and very rich. I did a half recipe to try it out (I was looking for a dessert for Thanksgiving). My mom and her boyfriend tried it out along with my daughter and RAVED about it. I used an instant hazelnut espresso for the mousse, and semi-sweet chocolate. No problems, just takes a little patience and a lot of time. Don't rush through the recipe, because it'll be worth it. I refrigerated the mousse beforehand and when I spread it over the third layer and placed the fourth layer of cake on top, it sat on top real nicely and didn't move around much. I'm bringing this tomorrow for Thanksgiving for a dessert dish, and I can't wait until the rest of the family tries it out!

Wonderful cake, enjoyed greatly by my guests. Allow full time suggested for cake to firm up. I was rushed and didn't. After putting the top layer on and starting to pour the chocolate the whole thing started slipping. I grabbed the springform ring and shoved it back on. What a hoot! The cake was a little lopsided, but tasted devine. Worth the high PITA factor (pain in the a..)

This was a fabulous hit with all of my dinner party guests! Definitely would make it again. Allow for alot of time on this recipie though To the cooks asking about the falling cake. I would suggest checking your baking soda. The older it is the more likely you'll get a turn out like that. Or check your oven. I've had numours cakes and breads, you name it, fall because of a faulty oven.

I too am an experienced baker, and my cake came out of the oven TWICE high and airy and collapsed like a brick. I made a second cake because I thought I had done something very wrong the first time, had the same result. Haven't eaten it yet, but I wish I had read that comment before I baked the first cake.

Excellent and interesting combination of flavors. Do NOT add any additional gelatin as one reviewer suggested, as the mousse is much too much like gelatin instead of mousse. I will make this again, following the recipe to the letter. The chocolate buttercream is one of the best I have ever tasted.

I made this cake for a co-worker's farewell party because she was leaving to work with the opera. To my horror as I was preparing to make the cake, I realized I had accidentally purchased milk chocolate instead of semisweet. It was late at night and I didn't have time to run to the store, so I sighed and made the cake with all milk chocolate. To my surprise, everyone raved about the cake. My co-worker said it was the best cake she's ever had (and she's a foodie.) Many people said they liked the cake because it didn't have the intense chocolate taste that comes from using semisweet. To make the cake have a rich flavor, I used freshly brewed espresso instead of coffee. I am planning to make the cake again as directed so I can compare.

I have made this cake twice. It is wonderful and very impressive! I agree with another reviewer that it is very time consuming, but not difficult...definitely worth every minute - and penny. Ingredients can get costly, especially when using good quality chocolate (a MUST for the recipe)! Just make sure you read the recipe all the way through and start the day before you plan to serve it. Make sure to allow the glaze to really cool and thicken otherwise it will just run down the side of the cake without really adhering. (If making in the summer I would put in the fridge for about 30 - 45 minutes and stir every 10 - 15 minutes) Also - milk chocolate for the buttercream was way too sweet - second time I used all bittersweet---absolute heaven!

I love this cake! Time consuming, but worth it! I have made this cake twice this season, since it got such rave reviews the first time! Be sure to use good quality chocolate, espresso powder and vanilla. It makes all the difference. For the previous reviewer, your chocolate should not make chips, since nothing is cold that you are pouring it into! But, if you are having problems, just continuously stir or beat the mixture as you are gradually adding the melted chocolate. This should prevent it from hardening into chips!

Rating: 0
I'm in the process of making this cake so I can provide no forks yet but I'm rather despondent over the melted chocolate. How do you add the melted chocolate without it congealing into little chips??? I wanted a chocolate cake not a chocolate chip cake. Any help, PLEASE...

Definitely a keeper. Made it for Thanksgiving. Worth the effort for a special occasion. Unbelieveable chocolate cake. Only things I would change is, you can do a whole cup of buttercream between the layers instead of 3/4, there is plenty, and I personally would prefer hardened thin chocolate "crust" on the outside instead of a sugary chocolate glaze. It looks so beautiful once you have poured the glaze on top and I would have preferred for it to harden all the way. (Mind you, I had to transport). I found the sugar glaze too sweet as well. Lastly, as with all these double boiler recipes, just melt the chocolate in the microwave in a small ceramic bowl in short increments with frequent stirring/checking! Worked just fine.

Rating: 4
While this cake was, indeed, time-consuming; it is well worth the results! I made it for one of our Thanksgiving deserts. The only thing that I would change is to the cake. I would melt the chocolate in the coffee. I had difficulity incorporating the chocolate. Although the chocolate was thoroughly melted and smooth, when I added it to the batter, it solidified and made small lumps of chocolate. It worked out well, though. But it turned out more like a chocolate chip cake rather than a chocolate cake. Everyone loved it. Don't know what S. Fisher did to have his cake fall. Even with my mistake, it was beautiful, light and airy.

This was very time consuming - especially as I had not made a cake from scratch before. About halfway, I thought I had messed the whole thing up - the only thing keeping me going was the cost of the ingredients. I perservered and was rewarded. It looks terribly impressive - for that alone I would make it agan. My only issue is the glaze - I'll try tweaking it to use less sugar.

I made this cake for a church function. However I am Latter Day Saint (mormon) and we are not supposed to eat or drink anything that has coffee in it. So I substituted the essence of coffee flavoring. (this idea I got from my future mother inlaw who lives in Holland) Well what can I say she was right and it worked. It was a smash hit and a favorite with everyone. It is a little labor intensive, but if you have the time make it. Your guests will love you in the end!

I've made this cake twice. Both times it tasted absolutely fabulous, a real "showy" cake. The first time I mistakenly put 1 tablespoon of gelatin in the mousse. Second time I used 1 tsp. The second cake did not hold up well at room temperature, where it does taste best. The fist cut smooshed the cake, & the mousse oozed out. The extra gelatin in the 1st cake gave the mousse more body, and the cake was easier to cut into thin slices. Sometimes we learn a lot from our mistakes! I will make this again, and maybe try 2 tsp. of gelatin.

Rating: 4
This is a cake that people crave. It is extremely rich, so shouldn't make it too often. I didn't have any problems with the mousse or the cake falling. As to the mousse layer, I would make it earlier and let it sit in the refrigerator while the cake is baking. There was way too much icing. I would half that. The cake needs to refrigerated for several hours, but it taste better at room temperature. The cake was gone in one day and the everybody is still talking about it.

I made this as the groom's cake at my best friend's wedding. I wrapped a plaid ribbon around it and served it with raspberries. It was a huge hit. The cake is ridiculously moist, the coffee mousse perfectly airy, and the buttercream melds all the flavors together. The glaze is easy and universal. This wins the world championship of chocolate cakes!

The cake was excellent! The layers were dense and rich, the chocolate buttercream was decadent, and the coffee mousse seemed to infuse the whole cake with flavor. The glaze rounded the whole thing out with extra chocolate-y goodness. Total chocolate overload. I had no problems at all with the cakes falling or with the mousse collapsing.

Rating: 4
While time-consuming, the results were worth it. I did not have problems with the cake layers falling...but do have a suggestion for the collapsing mousse. I mistakenly allowed the mousse to set before adding the third cake layer. Retrospectively, this turned out to be just fine and allowed for a thick, firm but still airy mousse layer.

I would have given this a four forks PLUS, but had the same problem Steven Fisher did...cake fell in the middle during baking which made assembly quite tricky. It is a fabulous party dessert, so I'll make it again (everything else about it was just great), but I'd love some tips on preventing the cake-falling problem.

I'm curious if anyone tried this recipe and had the cake fall while baking? Mine did. I know I followed the recipe perfectly. I'm an accomplished baker. I think the recipe was flawed. After much research on my behalf, I believe the cake should have been made with baking powder instead of the called for baking soda. Any help would be much appreciated.

I made this cake for my girlfriend's birthday, and it was amazing! She ate it for breakfast the next morning too... I didn't have creme de cacao so I used a mixture of Godiva liqueur and Kahlua, and dark coffee grounds in lieu of espresso powder. Though there are many steps and it was somewhat time-consuming, it's wasn't very difficult to make, and I would definitely make it again. The mousse layer collapsed when we cut the cake, but it tasted great anyway, and the presentation effect had already been made...
