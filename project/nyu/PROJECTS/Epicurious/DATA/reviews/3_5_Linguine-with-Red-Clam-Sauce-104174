Outstanding flavors and so easy to prepare. This is definitely a keeper -- good for family meal or for company. Used 1 TB anchovy paste, strained clams and did not add clams to sauce until last 1 -2 minutes. After bringing sauce to boil simmered about 30 minutes, which let the flavors meld and nicely thickened the sauce. About 1/2 C chopped parsley added at the end with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Great meal -- Red Clam Sauce is definitely as good if not better than what i've had at restaurants. And yes we did sprinkle with finely grated Pecornio-Romano cheese.

This recipe was so easy to make, and so delicious. I followed the advise of other reviewers and added the clam juice without the clams, reduced the sauce a bit, and then added the clams for a minute or two before adding the pasta. I also used 1 can Italian style diced tomatoes, and one with jalapenos to give the dish a little more spice. Other than that, just a little salt with the onions at the start and finished with some fresh cracked black pepper.

Only used 4 anchovies (packed in oil with capers), plain diced tomatoes which I seasoned with dried basil, oregano, parsley, italian seasoning, and rosemary, extra crushed red pepper, only 2 cans of clams which I chopped finely, and no fresh parsley. I thought it would be brothier based on the reviews but I suppose since I didn't add all the clam juice because my bf was watching me cook. The flavor was great though.

After consulting many cookbooks and online recipes, I liked this one best and used it. I used fresh clams and measured the strained juice and chopped clams to equal 26 oz. I used my own fresh parsley and basil chopped fine at the end and a tsp and a half of lemon juice to brighten. We loved it. This is mine now! Note to other readers: red clam sauce is SUPPOSED to be soupy. You are supposed to serve in a soup plate and mop with crusty bread or garlic bread. So be careful of too much boiling to achieve reduction--you could wind up with VERY salty sauce.

Really great red clam sauce. Agree with the earlier reviewers though, its a bit on the thin side. Next time, I would strain the clams and add their juice at the same time as the tomatoes and let that simmer for a while, adding the clams later on. Still a great sauce though: incredibly easy to make, did not even require salt and pepper it was so well spiced. Another plus: its done quickly.

Spectaular and so very easy to prepare. All my guests were impressed. It's easy enough for a weeknight meal, too. Only problem is that it had to cook down for a REALLY long time. I might try turning up the heat a bit next time so it cooks down more quickly if time is an issue. Totally delish.

Add clams at last 1-2 minutes or they turn rubbery. Pinch of basil, oregano, sugar and dash of worcheshire make it zing.

Very good red clam sauce! Rivals our local resaurants' versions. It will be a staple recipe in my collection.

This is the one. Everytime I've made clam sauce in the past it has been lacking. Followed this recipie somewhat closely and was blown away. All of the elements are there for a good seafood based red sauce. Will try this with mussels, shrimp, whatever I can get my hands on....

SOUPY IS RIGHT!! GLAD I FOLLOWED SUGGESTIONS ON REDUCING BEFORE ADDING THE CLAMS. GOOD FLAVOR BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE CHUNKS OF TOMATO WITH THE MINCED CLAMS. THE BEST RED CLAM SAUCE I HAVE EVER HAD WAS IN A LITTLE UNKNOWN TOWN IN ITALY AND IT WAS MORE LIKE A MARINA SAUCE MADE WITH A TON OF FRESH CLAMS. I THINK THE REVIEWER WHO USED CLAM JUICE COMBINED WITH "CRUSHED TOMATOES" HAS THE RIGHT IDEA. I'LL MAKE THIS AGAIN AND TRY IT THAT WAY. JUST FYI, THE ANCHOVY IDEA IS A FAVORITE OF RACHEL RAY'S. ALSO, IF YOU SHOP AT COSTCO, THOSE HUGE CANS OF CLAMS THAT ARE 52 OZ ARE EXACTLY DOUBLE THIS RECIPE SO YOU CAN SAVE ALOT OF MONEY AND FREEZE SOME AWAY. CHECK OUT RACHE'S "SPICY SHRIMP AND SPAGHETTI AGLIO OLIO" ON THE FOOD NEWTWORK. REALLY EXCELLENT.

Made this after my husband requested Linguine with Red Clam sauce like we had a Cafe Puccini in San Francisco. I think I came really close! I used canned clams and added the juice with the wine, but saved the clams to add at the end (per other reviewers). This is a real keeper, esp since nearly all the ingredients can be found in the pantry. I think the anchovies and red wine are the key to success that my previous attempts had been lacking.

I absolutely love this dish, and have made it again and again. I've also made it with whole baby clams and with mussels, and it's consistently delicious.

this is a staple dinner. always ends up on my recipe rotation. locate clams in a jar rather than a can (if you aren't using fresh seafood, of course). the canned clams tasted a bit metallic.

I make this dish every Christmas Eve, only I add mussles, shrimp, clams, scallops and crab claws. Its absolutley delicious.... only problem is I can't the in-laws to eat anything else now! Or anywhere else!! So be careful who you serve this to.

GREAT basic recipe that one can change to suit tastes. I used a whole can of anchovies, doubled the crushed red pepper, added an 8 oz bottle of clam juice, and used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. My version might not be identical to the recipe as written, but it was certainly inspired by it and is DELICIOUS! My husband declared this sauce 'restaurant quality' and is already asking for it again.

Made this with fresh clams because it was what I had on hand. Hubby said it tasted really close to a dish at our favourite Italian restaurant.

Definitely a keeper. I made this for my husband who claims his mother made the best red clam sauce. Not only was this easy, but my husband said this was the BEST EVER.

Love the flavor of anchovies. The aroma as it sauteed with the onions, shallots and garlic was heavenly. I might even increase the amount next time. I also used nearly a whole head of garlic. Definitely simmer clam juice in sauce with the wine and add the clams at the end.

This was very good but a tad too salty for my taste. I would reduce the amount of anchovy filets next time.

Dee-lish. Add the clams at the end. (I added the clam juice early to cook up then tossed the clams in just to heat them). Easy, yummy, healthy, little shopping required as these are mostly pantry staples. Taste alone is a 3 fork but the ROI makes it a Four Forker.

Tasty and quick...like others, I used one tablespoon of anchovy paste and waited until the last couple of minutes to throw in the clams (though the clam liquid went in with the wine and tomatoes).

I thought this recipe was delicious and very easy to make, I to had to use anchovy paste but it seemed to have still worked out. I also used a hand full of frozen clams with the canned clams and threw in a little extra garlic. very tasty.

I have never cooked with canned clams before, and now I know why. YUCK! Just rubbery flavorless bits. From now on I will stick to clam sauce using fresh littlenecks.

Very tasty. Used anchovy paste which seemed very strong at first, but was subtle in the final dish. I let it cook for about an hour before adding the clam meat and it was still a little thin. I'll cook it longer next time.

Quick and super easy. Good flavour for the amount of work involved. Seems though that a full pound of pasta is too much for the amount of sauce. I used achovy paste which works great. Makes great leftovers and makes a lot.

One of the best clam sauces I've ever had! I took the prior suggestion and used only half of the clam broth and reduced prior to adding the clams. My husband has asked for this recipe multiple times since I first made it three months ago.

Totally awesome! Simple to make, yet a taste that's out of this world. Make this one !

One word: Wow! I must agree that this was the best Red Clam sauce recipe I've seen-- and tasted! I substituted butter in place of the oil, and being a cheese-fan, I HAD to add fresh Parmesan; in my opinion, it was well worth it. My only concern, was that it took quite a while to simmer down to the thickness I wanted. Next time I'll just add the clam juice at the beginning-- I'll hold off on adding the clams themselves until the very end, so they will stay a little more tender. And I can't wait to try adding fresh seafood too... great recipe!

excellent recipe: rich and super-flavorful. and the amount of calories v. protein makes puts my mind at ease. i made a few modifications: 1) i separated the clams from the juice. i simmered the juice with tomatoes, wine and added the clams (and 1/2 lb. sauteed bay scallops) about 2 minutes before adding pasta. 2) i reduced the sauce by about 1/3 (the consistency is a bit soupy as is). but it worked fabulously. really allowed the flavors to meld and concentrate. 3) i used a can of unseasoned san marzano tomatoes, crushed them by hand and added fresh basil and dried oregano. better than del monte could do. 4) boil the pasta for 8 min (1 lb.) - under time by a minute - so that it picks up some of the sauce and adds some starch/thickening to the sauce. next time i'll add a few little necks in-shell for presentation.

Terrific recipe. Very easy to make, quick and satisfying. We halved the recipe and found it just right for one pound of liguine. Since we're in the US and not tourists in Italy, we used freshly grated parmesan on the sauce simply because we enjoy the taste.

Hands down the BEST linguini and clam sauce recipe. I was a little nervouse about the anchovies so I used about a tbls. of anchovy paste and the results were wonderful! Don't substitute wine use a dry chianti....you really could taste the difference. I also threw in a dozen little neck clams at the end and steamed them in the sauce until they opened along with the canned clams. It came out beautiful!! Next time I plan on adding calamari, shrimp, mussles and clams. This dish is a must in everyones recipe box!!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! It is extremely quick and easy. I am a member of Weight Watchers and modified it by using 1/4 cup of fat free chicken broth instead of oil. Will definately make it again. It also freezes very well.

Used anchovy paste instead. And baby clams, with some fresh basil. Very, very, good. As far as the parmesan, I like it. Maybe if I was in Italy I wouldn't use it, but fresh grated parmesan is so good!! Besides, isn't that what cooking is about, making things how you like them?

This was SO good!! As for using canned clams: it is a tad difficult to get good fresh clams in Northern Minnesota. I have discovered that the clams should not be added to a sauce until JUST before serving. They tend to get leather-like if cooked too long. As for using cheese on pasta: Maryanne Espisito, Lidia Bastianich, Nick Stellino, Marcella Hazan, Biba G., Carlo Middione(to name just a few) all recomend parmigiano-reggiano on pasta OTHER than seafood. Only in rare cases is it used on seafood pasta. I find it hard to believe that the Parma region in Italy would produce parmigiano-reggiano cheese & sell it for $18-20 a pound just for use in the USA. As I understand it, they have been producing this wonderful cheese far longer than the USA has been in excistance. Once you have had the expierence of this cheese, the stuff in the green can just won't do!

I never used canned clams before and won't again. The tomato base was good but the clams were not.

This recipe follows the tradition of classic clam sauces, and the whole family found it very good. I replaced the olive oil with butter for a more flavorful sauce. A note to the author...you never ever, ever use parmesan cheese on pasta when traveling in Italy. If you do, they will know you are a tourist for sure!

This recipe was very easy to make and involves minimal fresh ingredients- the sauce is wonderful. It has a complex and not overly fishy taste; the anchovies contribute a saltiness but don't overpower the sauce. The linguine was a perfect pasta for the sauce, although the amount of sauce could probably cover more than one pound of pasta.

This was delicious! Everyone loved it. Since it uses canned clams, you can pretty much throw it all together straight out of the pantry. It's a great recipe for those I-have-nothing-in-the-refrigerator days.
