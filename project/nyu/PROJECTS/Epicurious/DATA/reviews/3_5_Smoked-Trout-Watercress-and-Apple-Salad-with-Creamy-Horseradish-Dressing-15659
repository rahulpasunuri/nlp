This did not work for me. Dressing is to heavy and watery at the same time.

As others have said, this is strange, but combines into a wonderful salad. I'm surprised no one has commented about the amount of dressing that is left over, however. The recipe calls for you to make almost 2 cups of the cream dressing, but then you only use @ 1/3 cup to dress the salad. I now have 1 1/2 cups of the dressing leftover. Quite a waste. If I had it to do again, I'd make 1/2 or 1/4 of the dressing recipe.

Delicious. Rather than serving as a composed salad, I tossed heirloom lettuce, baby spinach with diced red onions and pieces of apple. Just prior to serving I tossed the salad and the FABULOUS dressing. To serve I plated the salad and topped with a main course size piece of smoked trout. Will make again. The elements are soo very delicious together. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this last year for break-the-fast and everyone loved it so much, they asked if I was planning it for this year. The answer is yes! I do cut the watercress with butter lettuce for a less "composed" and more salad like presentation for a group.

Wonderful salad. Full marks to the reviewer who cautioned against trying to sharpen the dressing before experiencing the effect of it on the onion, trout and apple. You can't judge this salad dressing until you try it all together. Will make again and again I'm sure.

I made this recipe last year for a large family gathering. People who watched me composing the salads all made negative comments about the combination of ingredients. Without exception, once they tasted it, everyone LOVED it. I am going to make it for Passover this year because we are having a meatless Seder, so no conflict with the use of cream. The only time consuming part of this recipe is cleaning the watercress! I may use a combo of spring mix and cress to cut down on the prep time.

Fabulous - used peppered, smoked mackeral instead of trout but otherwise followed exactly - definately make again!

Made this exactly as written except substituted home-smoked black cod for the trout. Also added a few butter lettuce leaves as a bed for the "salad". It's an exceptionally flavorful and elegant appetizer course. (When tasting the dressing alone I thought it lacked depth, and I had to restrain myself not to enhance it with additional ingredients. But as I assumed, the subtlety turned out to be perfect with the onion and apple flavors.)

Really nice recipe. Didn't have any cream so used creme fraiche instead - worked well. The combination of apple and trout was delicious. Will try with walnuts next time.

i smoke my own trout on my Green Egg - this dish comes out quite nicely. How can you miss - watercress/pears/nice fish/tangy dressing This is great as written - no tweeks other than i prefer asian pears. This is, however, not intended for the masses

Wonderful old-world-Larousse-esque combination. Great salad.

i used just over half the horseradish called for and that was enough to turn some folks off. but i was surprised at how balanced it tasted, really; very sophisticated tasting dish. i almost omitted the cider vinegar but it really tones down the horseradish and pulls all the flavors together amazingly. i tossed some of the dressing with cooked, chunked salmon, diced fuji apples, and thin sliced red onion, and served over mixed spring greens. it was fairly lightly dressed but full of flavor and texture. 1/3 the amt of dressing was enough for 1 lb salmon, a large fuji apple, over naked spring greens.

Rave reviews. I made this for a large potluck Thanksgiving meal, so instead of the lovely presentation the recipe suggests, I just mixed everything together and dressed it just before serving. I'm sure it wasn't as beautiful, but it tasted fantastic -- a sophisticated combination of flavors. Everyone liked it. I look forward to making it again for a small dinner party, where I can plate it & do the attractive presentation.

Fabulous. I used a prepared, seasoned trout, and topped with a bit of caviar. Went easy on the dressing because the prepared fish and eggs were strongly flavored. Definitely a substantial enough salad for a lunch.

Used whole smoked trout filet laid atop salad bed. Guests loved it. So did I.

Wow. I made this salad for our Christmas Celebration. It teamed very well with our Cold Turkey, Pork and Ham. It was one of five salads on the table, looked and tasted superb. I doubled the ingredients and added celery, red pepper for colour and avocado. A truly spectacular dish. Will definitely make again on a special occasion.

Fantastic!! I changed the presentation a bit though. I used a trout filet with the skin, then rolled the skin back 2/3 of the filet leaving1-2 inches of the skin attached. Next to the fish, I used a radicchio "bowl" filled with watercress and 3 apple slices fanned on the salad. I ladled the dressing along side of the fish. Rave reviews!!

This is fabulous! If you add some boiled new potatoes at room temp. it helps make this salad a meal on it's own. I treated my boyfriend to an elegant dinner and made this salad. He loved it.

If you want to impress. Make this salad. It takes some prep time, but it is worth it. I will be making this again.
