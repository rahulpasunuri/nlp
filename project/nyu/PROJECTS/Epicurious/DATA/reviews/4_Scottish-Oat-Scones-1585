I added 1/2 cup fresh black berries. fresh orange and half milk half orange juice. and dash of cinnamon to this recipe. next time I will be trying to see if using oat flour instead of the white all purpose flour works better to make it not as dense and smoother.

These taste great, but I didn't read earlier reviews before starting, and I should have. The batter was very wet, so much so that the scones didn't really hold together on the way into the oven, or coming out, either. They're basically just a yummy pile of crumbs on our plates right now. It's possible that we were a little short on the flour, too. My 3-year-old was measuring, and I tried to supervise, but ... Anyhow, I will definitely use this recipe again as a jumping-off point, skipping the cream of tartar and going to 1/2 cup butter or veg. oil.

I use only 1/2 cup of butter and add about a handful of chopped dried apricots, a handful of dried cherries and any other fruit on hand. I usually mix the dried fruit into the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients. Yum.

This recipe can be easily altered as the others have stated - I made it using Almond milk, wheat flour, and blueberries instead of currants. Added cinnamon as well. Copied the Oatmeal scones recipe and sprinkeled brown sugar and oats on top.... delicious! Stick with less butter as others have said - 1/2 cup works great.

Great base recipe. I turned them into maple oat scones. I omitted the raisins and cream of tartar. I added scant 1/4 cup maple syrup to the batter and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. These were exceptional. Crisp and dense like a scone should be but with the melted butter it made them somewhat moist on the inside. I also made the maple glaze from the Maple Walnut Pound Cake recipe on this site with a bit more powdered sugar and drizzled it over the top. Delicious!

I love this recipe with the following substitutions to make it healthier and easier: whole wheat flour (doesn't have to be pastry flour), no cream of tartar, 1/2 cup canola oil instead of the butter (as per someone else's suggestion), and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Instead of rolling out the dough and cutting it, I just grab about a half cup of dough and fashion it into a scone shape then bake instructed. This makes a very easy, yummy and satisfying breakfast scone. Also, I always double the recipe because they go so fast!

Delicious and versatile  gets rave reviews every time. First time I made these I misread the recipe and used only 1/3 cup butter... they came out prefect! Sometimes I'll use up to a 1/2 cup of butter, but never more than that and they always come out tender and buttery. I cant imagine using the full 2/3 cup butter the recipe calls for. Adapted into Cranberry Almond scones by adding 1/2 coarsely chopped died cranberries and 1/3 cup coarsely chopped slivered almonds - yummy! Another favorite: add 1 ½ tsp cinnamon and one finely chopped apple for a super moist Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal scone. This ones a keeper!

I made these last minute when I realized I didn't have any buttermilk on hand for the Julia Child recipe I usually make. These didn't begin to compare...understandably. They are a bit healthier, but my boys and husband didn't like them very much and the leftovers are languishing on the counter days later. Wouldn't make again.

Easiest. Scone Recipe. Ever. Love using melted butter instead of fussing with cutting in. Have also adapted into a vanilla scone recipe - vanilla sugar, scrapings from a vanilla bean and topped with a vanilla glaze. Big hit. These are delicious.

I made with pinhead oatmeal and dried cherries instead of raisins, as my daughter hates raisins with a passion. Otherwise, made as written and thought they were spectacular! Am definitely going to make again.

This is THE OATMEAL SCONE recipe for oatmeal and scone lovers. I make one change: instead of 2/3 cup butter, I use 4 Tbl. melted butter, plus 2-3 Tbl. applesauce. Ultra simple and quick to make - the perfect breakfast pastry!

Rating: 1
These came out with mixed results with some scones having a very metallic or bitter taste. Is the cream of tartar? Not sure, but I'm surprised based off all of the positive reviews. I've baked many times before and not had such a weird result. I might try again without the cream of tartar as one person suggested.

Scones have become a weekly food for us because of this adaptable recipe. The first time we made it the eggs were swapped for a banana and the milk for silk soy milk and the raisins were left out - the only complaint from my picky eater was that the whole oats from the oatmeal were too chewy. the next time the oatmeal was ground first and I increased the sugar by 1/4 cup, added vanilla and cinnamon. They got it two thumbs up. So that along with the ease of individually freezing these has made them a daily lunch box addition. Now I'm wondering what would happen if I traded the soy milk for carrot juice.

This has become my standard scone recipe; I always have the ingredients on hand and the recipe is easy to memorize after a few batches. I usually increase the sugar to 1/2 to 3/4 cup, decrease the butter to 1 stick, and omit the raisins and cream of tartar. As others have noted, the dough is generally very sticky, but I find that adding extra flour makes the finished product too dry, so I just flour up my hands and the countertop well. Also, be sure to combine the milk with the butter before adding the eggs; I was in a hurry one day and partially cooked the eggs.

I used 1/2 c. sugar... grated frozen butter (whole stick) into dry, add dried cranberries (instead of raisins) and 1/2 c. diced apples and chilled for 30 minutes before mixing with wet ingredients. Added 1/4 c. apple juice concentrate to wet ingredients. These are really a good base scone to do alot with...baking time I took out about 2 minutes early.

These were really good and I got a thumbs up from my "tasting panel" of three teenagers. The recipe is very versatile. I omitted the raisins and added butterscotch chips, I used "raw" sugar instead of regular sugar and replaced the regular oatmeal with a 5 grain oatmeal. Excellent.

Turned out great! I undercooked them by about 2 minutes. The flavor was light but just enough. I did top them with a sugar dusting, just for some flair. Will definitely make again!

Outstanding! I used fresh-milled hard winter wheat berries for the flour and about a cup of fresh blueberries. I found the pastry very wet so I added more flour and oats until it resembled the consistency that seemed right to me and I placed about 8 large dollops on cookie sheet instead of cutting them. I don't know if it's the butter, the fresh flour, or the blueberries but these may well be the best I've ever made. I will make again the same way and add lemon zest next time. Oh, I also substituted a Tbsp of fresh lemon juice for the cream of tartar.

I was so impressed with these scones! I omitted the raisins and reduced the sugar because I wanted something that could be dunked in soup, and these certainly delivered. Not too sweet but very moist and filling, with great oaty flavour.

Rating: 3
I made these as per recipe except I added 1/4 cup additional sugar (I like a sweeter scone), and used dried tart cherries and broken off pieces of a Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate baking bar. Even with the extra sugar, these tasted to me like not quite sweet enough oatmeal cookies. I ended up wishing that I had either made a batch of oatmeal cookies or the scones I usually make that do not have oatmeal in them. However, these were still tasty, and I did feel somewhat more virtuous eating them than I would have without the oatmeal.

I've made these about a dozen times since recently discovering this recipe and each batch is gone before the baking is completed! I usually substitute dried cranberries with toasted pecans or chocolate chips rather than raisins but they're good with just about anything added. (I've made them so often I even had to replenish my cream of tartar!). Be careful to leave enough room while baking as they spread and puff up. They can be cut into smaller pieces than called for and still turn out beautifully. Enjoy.

I have now made this nearly a dozen times since I first discovered the recipe and each batch is gone quickly - even kids who claim not to like oatmeal love these easy-to-bake scones.(I've made them so many times that I had to replace my cream of tartar!) I usually add dried cranberries and some chocolate chips rather than raisins and often with toasted pecans or other nut. It doesn't seem to matter - they're always delicious. Be careful, however, since they do spread and puff up and they need to have some space while baking. You can cut them into smaller pieces and still end up with good size scones.

Very easy and delicious! As prior reviewers suggested, I used only 1/2 cup melted butter and substituted whole what pastry flour for the regular flour. Served with sausage strata from this site for an easy brunch for out of town guests. I was a bit dubious about melting butter vs. cutting it in -- but they turned out great.

I have made these a few times now, using 1/2 C butter, and they're great scones. I made them this morning and forgot to add the cream of tartar and they taste fine, so I don't know if that ingredient matters much.

I made this last week and everyone LOVED them. Changes- 1/2 cup butter instead of 2/3 cup. Also, instead of raisins, used a generous 1/4 cup of original Craisins and 1/4 cup of choc chips. YUM! Making them again right now.

Rating: 4
I use this very easy scone recipe as the base for any number of additions. The only things I have changed "permanently" are the following: I use white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and I use 1/2 c. butter instead of 2/3. Other than that, I find it a great recipe and have added choc. chips or dried cranberries or peaches or plums.

I've been baking this recipe since I was 12 years old. It's very, very good. I usually omit the raisins (they get too dry in this recipe) and reduce the butter to 1/2 cup. My original copy of this recipe (from the Quaker company) recommends instant oatmeal--I prefer old fashioned (as called for in this version of the recipe).

This is the old standby, turns out perfectly everytime. I have made many variations from blueberry to cranberry orange, just add a tbsp of orange juice to the batter. I have also replaced the butter with canola oil and the results are just as favorable. This is a classic recipe. Enjoy!

Eat them and they'll melt in your mouth. It was a perfect amount of butter to make them moist enough without being greasy. Another dried fruit would taste better with these tho

I have been making these for years and make multiple variations. I have the original recipe torn from Gourmet! if I have it onhand, I prefer buttermilk (in everything baked). I often use the orange-flavered dried cranberries ("craisins") rather than raisins. When I do, I also add a 1/3 cup of toatesd pecans and I then serve with a locally-produced orange-blossom honey and butter. Yummy served warm. Soetimes I make them "plain" (no raisins, craisins, or nuts - just the basic oat recipe). My family and uests love the nutty-oatey flavor much more than standard cream scones. I have ben asked to make these for others. I usually cut them into 8 wedges, rather than 12, and cook them a inutes longer. Wonderful, versatile, easy-to-make recipe~ Great with Darjeeling Tea in the afternnon~

We made this recipe with whole wheat flour, soy milk, and maple suger. We had to add a bit more flour for the proper consistency. They were terrific!

Rating: 3
I substituted these ingredients for a "healthier" scone (but, with all that butter, who am I kidding?): whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, 3 Tablespoons agave syrup for the 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup sparkling water for the 1/3 cup milk. Instead of the melted butter, I cut in cold squares of unsalted butter with a pastry blender. I also added 2 Tablespoons pumpkin pie spice for a little kick and minced the raisins before I mixed them in. I cut six scones each from two rounds, as another reviewer suggested. Because of the agave syrup, I baked them at 425 degrees. They were well-browned in 11 minutes, so they could have probably been done at 10 minutes. The result is flaky and crumbly. They hold up well on their own, but probably wouldn't withstand a slathering of butter and/or jam too well.

Scones were good. I used cold, cubed butter instead of melted. Dough was a little dry, but a teensy bit o' milk fixes that.

This is a favorite standard for flavor and ease/speed of assembly. They re-heat well the next day, developing a little crunch. I skip the raisins, and we slather on butter and jam.

We made these for Mother's Day brunch. Instead of one large round, we made 2 smaller ones, cutting each into 6 wedges. We also used dried blueberries in one round, and dried cranberries in the other. Both were yummy, easy to make, and will definitely be made again.

These are a definite make again. This was my first attempt at scones & they were easy and wonderful. I used dried cherries and served them warm with butter & cherry preserves. There are so many variations I look forward to trying!

I can't give this a numerical rating because I made a few mistakes, but I'd like to leave myself some reminders for when I do this again the right way :-) If you use salted butter, remember to omit the 1/2t salt! Remember to mix in the raisins so you don't end up pressing them on the top afterwards ;-) Also, the dough came out so wet that I simply made drop scones. I also baked at 400F for about 16 mins.

Good basic recipe. Nice texture. I added vanilla, maybe next time will use lemon peel. Also heated the oven to 400 degrees. They came out perfect. But why the cream of tartar?

Great Scones! I used quick cook oats (versus the old fashioned) and it worked fine- also I added more sugar (almost a half cup) and semisweet chocolate chips instead of raisins or currants and they were fab! Wonderful with coffee or a glass of milk!

These are homey and good--not a sweet scone, if that's what you're looking for. Two hours after baking them, my kitchen still smells wonderful! I will definitely make these again and experiment with the recipe.

This is a very easy recipe. It's basic, but that just means that there's a lot of room for variation. The next time I make them I'm going to substitute mini-chocolate chips for the currents. My husband loves them and will often ask me to make them with Sunday morning coffee.

I've made many kinds of scones, but this is the one I keep returning to. Every time I make them, I'm hounded for the recipe. Incredibly easy to make, delicious taste and texture (not the usual rock-in-the-stomach). Great served warm with fresh blackberry jam or spun honey. I also substitute dried currants for raisins on occasion. Maybe it's my oven, but I have to lower the cooking temp by 25-50 degrees or they overcook, and I shorten the time by a few minutes as well.

This recipe was disappointing. I tried to do them as individual scones and they didn't work as well. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was underwhelmed. Flavor was OK, but they burned too easily and fell apart too easily.
