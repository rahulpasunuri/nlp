Very good, quick, easy. I took a few hints from other cooks and I used green onions, took the shrimp out to thicken the sauce. I also added more mustard and a couple of splashes of white wine. It got excellent reviews at dinner!

This is a wonderful recipe. Very easy to make, and incredibly tasty. I used green onions instead of chives, and added a little cayenne and a bit too much salt (need to be careful about that one). I cooked down the cream/mustard mixture with the butter/garlic before adding the shrimp. Like a previous reviewer, I served it with spinach, which soaked up the delicious sauce. Highly recommended.

A pretty tasty dish. I was out of dijon mustard, so I used deli mustard (at least 2x the amount), 1 tbsp wasabi, 1 tbsp Vietnamese chili garlic paste, doubled the garlic, and added a small can of clams (but kept to 1/3 cup of clam juice as directed). Sauce was still a little thin, but overall, the dish was a hit for a party with Asian friends.

This is delicious. I agree about the thin sauce, and next time I'll reduce the cream, clam broth, and mustard mixture before adding it to the shrimp. "Buttery Rice Timbales" is an awesome accompaniment! Find the recipe by searching here at Epicurious.

This dish was amazing! I followed all of the suggestions, sour cream, green onions and even served it over pasta. The best part was the cook time, just about 10 minutes from start to finish.

The sauce was a bit thin, but very tasty. I think I would probably take the shrimp out to thicken the sauce, otherwise they would be overcooked.

Very simple and simply delicious! I used regular sour cream,jumbo shrimp and "Texas Onions" Added a pinch of paprika and pepper and served it over Orzo. Rave reviews from family.

I agree with the Cook from El Paso, don't wait for guests! I used reduced fat sour cream instead of heavy cream, and a country dijon mustard to give it a little pop. Served it over a bed of steamed baby spinach (into which I tossed the left over chives at the end of the steaming process) to lighten it up even more, and it was delicious!

Aside from peeling and deveining the shrimp, this dish is very easy to make! I couldn't find any chives so I used green onions. Made the dish as is, without any alterations and got raves at the dinner table! Next time, I'll add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to perk it up a bit.

This is scrumptious, I'm completely enamored with it. Even works lightened with evaporated milk and less butter. I would definitely use chives though, unless you really can't find them. Don't save it for "company," it only takes about 5 minutes to make.

This is my favorite kind of recipe. It is very simple and really delicious as is, but you can vary it greatly by the addition of one or two ingredients, like the red pepper or mushrooms. Whatever you have on hand, or are in the mood for. I served it over couscous.

Used extra-large shrimp--provided a little more time to reduce the sauce. Tried it with green onions rather than chives--great result!

A just so-so shrimp dish. It was too bland for me. I added cayeme pepper and salt. The sauce came out too thin.
