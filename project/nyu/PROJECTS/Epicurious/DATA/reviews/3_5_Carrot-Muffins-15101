Delicious. Part carrot cake, part apple bread, fully delicious. My muffins didn't rise as much as I would have thought (or liked), but tasted so good it didn't matter.

I'm not going to rate this but it wouldn't be fair. I made too many adjustments: cut the amt of flour and used 1C of rolled oats; cut the amt of cinnamon & incl 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves, nutmeg & ginger. Cut the amt of oil & used unsweetened applesauce. Didn't have pecans used walnuts. Overall, very good, moist and flavorful

So moist and so delicious! I used candied pecans and omitted the raisins. I used slightly less then 1 1/4 cup of sugar because I used the candied pecans. Soooo good and very easy to make.

good basic recipe. i substituted whole wheat, a cup room temp butter instead of oil, added 1/4 cup each ground flax & bran, toasted the pecans & doubled, & used crystalized ginger chunks in place of raisens. really tasty. there's so much you can do with this.

I followed the recipe, except that I left out the raisins and used a dried, unsweetened coconut. Otherwise, it made about 48 mini muffins and they were delicious! These came to about 89 calories each, but next time I'll modify the recipe to lower the calories.

These turned out so good. I used 1/2 whole wheat flower, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/4 c oil and subbed applesauce, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon allspice. I cut out the coconut to keep the fat down. They tasted like a yummy carrot cake, even though they were healthy and relatively low-fat (made 12 muffins, and I think there was 9 grams per muffin.)

These are good. I had to make them without nuts and raisins due to school restrictions. That left them a little flavorless. I added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. This helped give it more flavor. Next time I will try adding some ginger. I used 1/2 cup of shredded non-sweetened coconut. I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 yogurt in place of the oil. The muffins were still moist and had a nice texture due to the shredded carrots and apple. No need to peel the apple. I also only used 1 cup of sugar as others recommended--used 1/2 regular and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I made mini muffins and they turned out great. It made about 55, which is great since I served some today and am freezing the rest for an event in a few weeks. These muffins are good and will please a variety of palates.

Rating: 4
very good base recipe. As other reviewers noted, reduced sugar to 1C and added orange zest ( but with nutmeg&cardamon instead of cinnamon ) and replaced oil with 50/50 oil/apple sauce.... Have tried different variations, but as long as you keep flours, eggs, and the Cup of 'oil/oilsubstitute', these are pretty fail proof. Next version with dried fig chunks of dates instead of raisins and almonds.

I'm not a baker, at all. Love to cook, can't bake - don't like being exact. Apparenly, muffins are the way to go since only about 2 reviewers followed the recipe :) Adapted this recipe to no nuts or coconut due to my son's allergies. Reduced sugar as many reccomended and recipe turned out great. Easy, quick - love it.

I swapped the cup of canola oil for 3/4 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 cup coconut oil and tossed in a handful of flax seed. Much more healthy that way and just as moist and delicious.

though i did change a few things (subbed half whole wheat flour for white, half the sugar (3/4 cup), added 3/4 tsp ginger, doubled the carrots, used walnuts for pecans, craisins for raisins, and crushed pineapple for apple...kind of a lot, i know!) next time i think i would use less oil and maybe use half a cup of applesauce in its place. as others have said though, i think this is a fantastic base recipe. easy to tweak to your own tastes!

These are great! I made the following changes: 1 c whole wheat flour/1 cup AP flour; cut sugar down to 1/3 white and 1/3 brown (this was a pretty drastic cut, as the muffins did not come out with much sweetness, but I liked that!); substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil; added some nutmeg; added some ground flaxseed; used extra-large muffin tins (made 10 muffins). With these changes, they came out very moist, not too sweet, and delicious.

4 out of 5 family members liked these muffins...I used the this recipe for a base and then altered. Used 1/2C oil and 1/2C plain yogurt, used 1 1/4C all purpose flour and 3/4C whole wheat flour and cut 1/4C of sugar out...still tasted great, great texture and still moist....ate it with peanut butter on them yummy!

Outstanding muffins!! I substituted the apple for pineapple, added nutmeg, was a little more generous with the cinnamon and did 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar. I also have baked these in tiny muffin cups (less time, of course) and the kids love them. Plus, they freeze great. I would highly recommend these.

Rating: 3
I agree. Good solid recipe but alter for your own tastes. My biggest change from the original would be less sugar... Even with less than a half a cup each of brown sugar and white sugar, I'd still scale back more to about 1/3 each. Could probably have used more nuts too, and I used 2 heaping tbsp of cinnamon, 1 tbsp each of nutmeg and cloves and the spices still could have been more pronounced. But yes, great basic recipe! And I like the addition of apples!

i just tried it, and i really liked it. of course, i made a few changes. but i did think it was a good base recipe. my changes defintly wouldn't change how moist it was!! i might add a bit more cinnamon next time, just a personal preference.

These muffins are OUTSTANDING! Following the advice of a few commenters, I made a few changes which I highly recommend: added 1/2t of nutmeg, 1/2c of golden brown sugar and 3/4c regular (instead of all regular sugar), and instead of apple about 14-15oz of crushed pineapple, liquid pressed out. the result took a bit longer to bake than called for, but were seriously to die for. This will be a go-to recipe for me.

Rating: 3
Excellent muffins. Made as directed, but substituted a 14 oz can of crushed pineapple for the apple (squeezed the fruit to get it as dry as possible). This recipe is less sweet than the highly rated Triple Layer Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Icing from this site. I had frozen leftover icing from that recipe and used it on these muffins. Fabulous!

Rating: 3
Decent recipe.. Moist on the inside, nice and crunchy on the outside. I used 3/4 cup grapeseed oil instead of corn oil because that was all I had. Also, used half sugar and half agave syrup and it turned out nice.. Most of the sweetness tasted like it came from the apple. Next time, I might try pineapple instead.

Note to egirl2u. Incredible. You change all the ingredients and then say the texture was terrible. Hmmm. If you start fooling around with the recipe, sometimes it works, sometimes not. You FEAR the recipe would be greasy? I fear you don't know what you are talking about if you haven't tried it. I have made the recipe several times EXACTLY as written. No problems, people like them and even ask for the recipe. A cup of oil sounds like a lot, but it does make 18 muffins. They are moist and flavourful and definitely not greasy. If its too much oil for you, find another recipe.

Jeez. I read the reviews because I want to find a reliable basic recipe. I can figure out how to make the odd substitution if I need to.

But how does that help me to evaluate the recipe?

This is a great recipe! I've made it over and over and will continue to make it. Sometimes I use wheat flour or sub applesauce for half of the oil to health it up a bit. All variations have worked out great.

I love this recipe. Admittedly I triple the spices, add a bit of what-ever is in the spice rack - nutmeg, ginger, all spice, cloves. Also, having experimented with flavours, have found 1/4 cup more than enough for our family's taste, almost always omit the coconut. We use 1/2 or even 1/4 of the oil, replace it with mashed banana/yogurt/applesauce - again, what-ever is available. On occassion we have used 1/2 rye flour, 1/2 wholemeal. A very versatile, reliable family muffin that the kids love and my husband can snack on almost guilt free. A reviewer said it wasn't mind-blowing, but with respect - it is a MUFFIN! A great base recipe to tweek to suit your own taste.

Rating: 2
This is a decent, not mind blowing muffin. When asked if he liked the muffin while eating it, my husband just replied: "Eh, they're there". That just about sums it up. My lukewarm review, however, did not prevent me from eating plenty of them. They aren't bad. They just aren't great. I think a hint of cardamom could improve this recipe and I might go so far as to try again with that addition. I made these in mini muffin tins and I reduced cooking time to 12 minutes. Currants work well in place of raisins and I added some ground flax for health and texture. All in all a fine little muffin but nothing outstanding or memorable.

I too made substitutions such as walnuts instead of pecans, used only 3/4 cup of sugar, and only 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also substituted in 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Since I live at altitude in Denver, I also needed to cut down on the baking soda to 1 3/4 tspns. Once it was all mixed together it did look a bit too liquidy, so I added another 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. In the end, it came out perfectly and very tasty.

Like everyone else, I see a recipe and make intuitive changes. I omitted the raisins, reduced sugar. Used 1/2 c. butter and 1 banana (for moisture since I was reducing fat by 50%). The muffins were way too moist for my taste despite adding at least another 10 minutes to the cooking time (my oven temp is right on, too). Had I used the 1 cup oil as the recipe suggested I fear they STILL would be too moist, but then greasy as well. The flavor was great, but texture terrible. Will try them again, but without the banana, and still with the reduction in fat. One reader suggested turning the heat up to get crunchier tops. Will try this as well next time. This recipe gets one more try then it's "into the trash".

Excellent recipe! Like "Jezebelle" I only used about 3/4C of sugar. I omitted the nuts and coconut but upped the amount of the raisens and used 1C all purpuse flour and 1C whole wheat flour and they came out excellent!! The recipe yielded 12 standard size muffins and 6 minis. I should also note, I have a Jack LaLanne power juicer. I love carrot juice and was looking for a recipe to use the leftover pulp. This recipe worked PERFECTLY! They were still moist even though the carrots weren't the same as grated. I also used a Cortland apple instead. I think the next time I make a batch I'll up the cinnamon and add some nutmeg or use some pumpkin pie spice. I think these are great snacking muffins!!

Used probably 2/3 lb. of carrots to get 2 c. shredded but delicious muffins resulted - modified by using 1c. white and 1 c. wheat flour, 1/2c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. yogurt. Omitted coconut and apple and added 1/2 c. chopped candied pineaplle.

Very good recipe. I was a little worried when it seemed like there wasn't enough wet mixture to incorporate all the dry ingredients. BUT, it all came together beautifully with the help of my Kitchenaid Mixer. The only thing I would possibly alter with this recipe is the amount of oil. Maybe next time I will use 1/2 cup of oil + 1/2 cup of applesauce.

Oh, and forgot to mention that I also use about 3/4 cup sugar instead of the 1 and 1/4. The carrots are already inherently sweet - no need to overload on the white poison :)

This recipe is amazing!!! Granted, I don't make this into muffins, but sort of bake it as a quick bread (less trouble this way) or in a pie tin and it turns out amazing. My one consistent substitution is to use 3/4 cup apple sauce instead of the same amount of oil. The other 1/4 cup is quite necessary. Also, I once had to make it without the granny smith apple, and it turned out just as amazing (if not as moist as with the apple). So altogether, great recipe, great muffins (cakes) and great eats!

I was looking for ways to get my toddler to eat more vegetables, and this muffin recipe is so easy, delicious and readily modifiable for kids. I add more carrot than it calls for, and substitute either use half white and wheat flour, or if I don't have wheat flour, I use 1/2 cup of wheat germ for the white flour. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup or less and the muffins are still sweet. If I don't have an apple to grate I substitute 1 cup of sugar-free applesauce. And I toss in more raisins than it calls for. These freeze well -- I put some in my son's backpack for him to take to playgroup and they are always a hit. Adults love them too! I now make this recipe every other week. This is now a hands-down family favorite.

Loved it! Easily changeable to your tastes: I added 1/2 cup of carrots and 1 red apple, with about 1/4 cup of each of the following: bran flakes, conrinth raisins, whole walnuts, mixed nuts & grains (powdered), and kamut flakes. I changed the 1 cup of oil to 1/3 of apple sauce and 2/3 of corn oil. The muffins came out perfectly moist and taste wonderful!

Rating: 3
I agree with the other reviews - very yummy recipe and very easy to modify to your own preferences. In my opinion it's foolproof and they tasted great! These are the modifications that I made: for the flour I used half white, half whole wheat. I dropped the sugar down to 1 cup total, and used half white, half brown. For the 1 cup oil, I changed it to 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup plain yoghurt. I omitted the Granny Smith apple all together. I baked them until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean (~20min).

I followed the recipe to the letter the first time, but found them too oily. They're much tastier (in my humble opinion) using half whole-wheat flour, unsweetened dessicated coconut, 2/3 less 1 Tbl. sunflower oil, a handful of shelled, unsalted sunflower seeds, some nutmeg to taste, and 2 Granny Smith apples. The acidic tang reacts with the baking soda to make them rise. With at least 2 always- hungry teenagers in the house, it's important to have healthy snacks like this available for them to choose. They may groan, "Mommy's doing her nutrition thing, again," but they (and their friends) always eat them. At breakfast, one of these split and spread with a little natural peanut butter keeps me sated and energized 'til lunchtime. I use a mini muffin pan (24) when I serve them for breakfast or brunch buffets.

Even, with all the changes, the muffins came out so delicious!

This recipe was great. I tried it in a desperate attempt to get more fruits and veggies in my toddlers diet. He loved these muffins and so do I. I shredded the carrots fine because I didn't want him to figure out he was eating anything good for him. But other than that stuck to the recipe. Next time I might toast the coconut first.

These muffins were great...and very forgiving. I used whole-wheat flour, added more cinnamon and some nutmeg, decreased sugar to 1 cup, used walnuts instead of pecans, no raisins, and applesauce for half of the oil and the apple. The coconut added interesting texture and flavor; while not essential, the coconut really added to the complexity of this diverse muffin. Very moist and just perfectly sweet (used turbinado sugar). Would highly recommend for a nice change from standard blueberry and corn muffins!

I am VERY stingy with the four fork rating, but this is such a great "it's all good recipe" that I can't resist. Just look at other reviews- use what you have on hand & they will still be good. I forgot to add vanilla (price you pay for making muffins while two cranky toddlers are around) and they are STILL good. I had some extra sweet potato casserole from Thanksgiving lying around & added that instead of apple. Oxo makes a GREAT box grater with plastic handle that eliminated the need for dragging out food processor. About 15 minutes in mini muffin tins (silicone of course- they ARE the bomb for non-stick) and a bunch of pre-school kids will be quite happy tomorrow @ snack time.

Please don't waste your time on this muffin! When I read all the rave reviews, I thought I had found the quintessential muffin recipe. But, no!!! Way too oily, despite substituting apple sauce for a quarter cup of the oil. I reduced the sugar to one cup as per most instructions, and used organic unsweetened coconut. Unless something miraculous happens to the flavours and texture overnight, which I seriously doubt, they are destined for the garbage bin.

This is the most forgiving and delicious healthy muffin recipe I've ever come across. I'm a notoriously bad recipe-follower - I mean, I can't help but change things.

Just excellent!

These are great. I made them for my daughter's pre-school class and they were a huge hit. I couldn't put in the nuts and didn't have an apple so I upped the carrots to 2.5 cups, replaced half the oil with apple sauce and used more rasins. They smelled so good! We love them. I would probably only use one cup sugar next time.

Oh my god! I literally just took these muffins out of the oven and had to try one (to make sure they're done, of course) and they are phenomenal. I am a huge muffin fan, and a very big carrot muffin fan and these are as good as any I have purchased from any high-end bakery. I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions: I used just a tad over a cup of sugar, and used a little less than 1 cup of oil, and I used canola oil. Try these muffins!

My boyfriend likes healthy stuff and always finds commercial muffins too "cakey". So I tried these with some modifications and they made really tasty, wholesome-looking, chunky muffins. I know it's painful sometimes to read through people's substitutions, but in order to make these a bit healthier for my boyfriend, I completely substituted the white flour, and instead used 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 cup oat flour (just oat flakes coarsely pureed into flour). I also sub'd 1/2 the oil with unsweetened applesauce as other reviewers suggested, and omitted the coconut (because I've got a banana-coconut muffin recipe to try next). Pecans were switched to walnuts because I happened to have them. I grated almost 2.5 cups of carrots. Also I used all brown sugar instead of regular granulated. I find brown sugar gives more flavour and despite the difference in weight, it can be used in place of white sugar on a 1:1 basis. All in all, delicious muffins, and despite all my modifications, these would almost certainly be good without any changes as well.

I omitted the coconut and pecans but doubled the raisins. I did have doubts because the batter looked very chunky, but everything evened out and the result did have a nice texture. This recipe made 6 somewhat large muffins and an additional mini loaf. The muffins took an extra ten minutes or so to bake. I also added 1/3 tsp. each of nutmeg and clove and frosted the muffins with a cream cheese frosting to which I added a splash of Cointreau.

I have made these muffins many times now. This is a very adoptable and flexible recipe. I used whole wheat flour, added 1T of orange peel, and cut oil in half and used 1/2C apple sauce. Using Rum instead of vanilla gave an extra kick with cinnamon. A definate keeper!

I really don't think these muffins were all that great. We were going to use them for my religion class but I got sick and we canceled. I think others might have liked them but kids may like them.

A very good recipe! I substituted brown sugar for the plain sugar and applesauce for oil and they were great, they took a little longer to cook though.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! I didn't have any pecans so I threw in an extra handful of raisins and I cut back on the oil by a fourth(next time I'll make that a 1/3, they ARE a bit oily.) My daughter's preschool class LOVED them-- getting 2 year olds to eat that many veggies! I took them in for her Halloween party on Friday as cupcakes. I whipped up 8oz cream cheese, stick of butter, the juice of half a lemon, a tablespoon of vanilla and about 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar as icing-- they were incredible! I think the teachers loved them more than the kids!

I made some of the modifications listed (1/2 cup applesauce 1/2 cup oil; 1/4 cup splenda 3/4 cup sugar). But they had a really, really, bitter aftertaste. I didn't decrease the baking soda b/c others seemed to have been ok with the full amount so maybe that was it? Or the splenda? This is the first time I baked with it. I'm quite pissed as I ihad to haul out the food processor for this.

Delicious recipe! I left out the coconut and raisins and added another carrot or two, and swapped the oil for applesauce. My roommates loved them, and nary a one was left the next day.

great...used apple sauce and flaxseed as well....just great

Rating: 4
Fabulous recipe! I followed the suggestions posted to cut down the oil to 2/3 c. and add 1/3 c. applesauce. Divided the batter into two regular-sized loaf pans. Using my mini food processor to shred carrots was a great timesaver. Turned out great. It's moist, flavorful, and easy to make. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Rating: 3
YUM!!! Definitely a fail-proof recipe since it survived my extensive health-conscious substitutions! I did 1/2 whole-wheat 1/2 reg flour, cut down oil by a third, cut down sugar by a third, added flaxseed in lieu of pecans. I asked my husband whether he could tell that this was a "health" muffin, to which he replied: "Not by taste. Just by feel-- it's so heavy you could probably kill someone if you threw it at them." Hahaha. Great!

I thought these were terrible. There was WAY too many fillings and flavors. They were very overdone. I will NOT make these again.

I took the liberty of using 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all purpose, decreasing the sugar to 1 cup, using 3/4 cup oil, using a pear instead of an apple, using walnuts and almonds.... and the muffins STILL came out GREAT. This is definitely a good recipe that takes modifications well.

I really really liked these. I reduced oil added ground flax see and applesauce. loved all the stuff in them

I took the advice of other reviewers listed here and substituted 1/4 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil. The muffins were moist and delicious. I left out the pecans, but the recipe still came out really good.

I combined from 2 previous reviews; cut the oil to 3/4 cup and 2 Tbs water and put 1 1/2 tsp baking soda. It was moist enough and delicious.

to the cook from pittsburg, i find that baking soda gives a funny aftertaste, a little bitter. i always cut down the amount in recipes.

This is just yummy, the whole family enjoyed these. I did use 3/4 cup oil and added about 2 Tablespoons water, instead of the 1 cup of oil the recipe called for. I made this twice in one week!

In a word, Yummy!!!!!!!

Rating: 3
Nice texture and taste. I added 1/2 tablespoon flax seed. The coconut didn't particularly add much to the taste. I also made these with a mix of 3/4 cup Splenda(since I had some left over from my Atkins Diet in-laws who visited for T'Giving) and 1/2 c. sugar and they tasted natural. Definitely will keep this recipe. Question. Can these be made with LESS OIL? I used muffin paper liners and the liners were soaked with oil, as was the tin itself.

I left out the raisins and nuts and added an extra apple - the muffins were delicious, very moist.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe and found that they ended up having a bitter taste to them. I wonder if it is because the recipe doesn't call for peeled carrots. If I were to make it again, I would try it with peeled carrots. My husband couldn't get passed one muffin where as I have had a few.

As other reviewers have noted, these are the perfect carrot muffins!

These were great!! I used an all natural sugar replacement (similar to "splenda") from the Whole Foods Market and replaced canola oil with olive oil. I doubled the recipe and used a mini muffin pan; it made about 100 miniature munffins.

Fantastic! Super moist. Used some of the other suggestions about sugar and oil and made a loaf instead, took long about 50-60 min. A great surprise and alternative to banana bread.

I made these for my carrot-cake loving husband, who also likes coconut (I dislike both). Simple to make, and I can have a batch in the freezer for him. He says the recipe is a keeper.

I was all set to make some fantastic carrot muffins. Mixed the dry ingredients together, then realized I only had two carrots. Briefly considered changing them to apple muffins, but only had one apple. So, at 10:30 PM I went outside and raided my zucchini plant. (As you can tell, I'm not the most responsible cook!) I cut oil in half, omitted coconut, used almonds instead of pecans, used whole wheat flour, and only added 1/2 cup sugar. AND THEY STILL TURNED OUT GREAT! Amazing, a recipe that can stand up to all that cannibalization!

Rating: 3
This was SO delicious! It was a hit at home and at work. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and used baby carrots instead. I think that adds enough sweetness along with the raisins. Also food processing the carrots makes the grating part easier.

Rating: 4
These last more than a day in our house ONLY if I make them when my children aren't around! I make a dozen bigger muffins vs. 18 small, using 1 c. whole wheat flour, an extra half apple, only 2/3 c. sugar, and go nutless in warm weather. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup. I also baked it in a loaf pan for about 1 hour. It was still very sweet and a nice hearty bread. So moist and so tasty!

Rating: 4
Delicious! My husband couldn't get enough of this! Instead of muffins,I made this in a loaf pan -- took longer to bake (approx. 50 minutes)or so, or until a tooth pick came out clean. My husband wants to make sure I keep this recipe. HE LOVES IT.

Rating: 4
Wow! Really, really good. I was surprised, actually. It is a kind of strange recipe and, since I was making it for my toddler, I left out cinnamon, coconut, raisins and pecans. They were still great. They had an unusual buttery brown sugar flavor - I don't know where it came from. I will make these again.

Rating: 4
These are some of the best muffins I have ever had. I did cut back on the oil and the sugar to 3/4 cup each. I just made these for a shopping bus trip we took for my girl friends birthday. Everyone loved them. I have made about 4 times now. YUM YUM

I'm picky about muffins because they usually turn out dry, but these guys were extra moist. I used walnuts instead of pecans and added golden raisins (which went very well with the coconut). They were delicious.

These muffins are truly wonderful. I followed everyone else's advice and scaled back the oil to a little bit more than 1/2 cup. This amount worked just fine.

These were delicious! However next time I think I will use less oil, or maybe combine oil with applesauce

DELICIOUS.DELICIOUS. JUST FOLLOWED THE ABOVE RECIPE. GOOD WITH CREAM CHEESE SPREAD ON.

Rating: 3
I really liked these muffins. But I had one small problem. The amount of oil it called for seemed excessing while I was making the recipe but I added it anyway. And as I suspected the end result was an excessively oily muffin. Next time I'll try atleast halving the oil. I did like that the muffin was so moist so if that impacts the moistness badly then maybe I'll try some combination of applesauce and oil. Other than that these muffins were very tasty.

Rating: 4
Made them this morning, and possibly due to only having had one cup of coffee so far, did not see any instructions for adding the sugar on my printed version. Beat it into the wet ingredients. They were fabulous! The strangest looking batter I've ever seen, but they baked up fine. Used unsweetened coconut, and as usual, replaced half the white flour with whole wheat PASTRY flour.

Rating: 4
The first clue that these would be good came from the smell that filled the kitchen while they were baking. Then there were the visuals. They were richly browned at the edges and golden on the tops and when I broke one in half they looked lovely with the threads of carrots brightly visible. They were delicious of course. How could they be otherwise with all that sugar and oil. As a healthy snack this recipe doesn't rate more than two forks but I was expecting it to be just what it was. I did reduce the sugar to one cup and the oil to 7/8 cup, the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsps (I think most carrot cake/muffin recipes call for too much cinnamon which then becomes the flavour rather than enhancing it) and added 1/2 tsp of cardomom (also left out the raisins and coconut thinking they would just sweeten things further, and the nuts, which I never put in muffins anyway). I can't wait to start tweaking, starting with the sugar and next the oil but am going to thoroughly enjoy these just baked ones in all their sweetness and glory.

Rating: 4
Look no further - this is the absolutely PERFECT recipe for carrot muffins. Easy to make, nice in appearance, a crowd pleaser, and very moist - no need for butter or any topping (unless you simply want to indulge with a cream cheese frosting).

Rating: 4
One of the best carrot muffin recipes I've tried. Added to my Recipe Box. Will definitely make again. As with all breakfast pastries a little cardamom never hurts.

Rating: 4
These turned out great! I made a very few changes: I used 'Lighter Bake' instead of oil - I use it all the time and it's good for any kind of baked goods except biscuits or pie crust. The other change wasn't intentional: I didn't have enough carrots so I used parsnips(!) for half. I was amazed at how well it worked -- no strong flavor, just a hint of sharpness. I think I'll use parsnips next time too.

Rating: 4
Fantastic muffins! Moist, delicious and deep brown in colour. Only two changes I made were using apple sauce instead of the granny smith apple and macadamia nut oil instead of vegetable oil.

Rating: 4
I pretty much made this recipie as written, although I did reduce the sugar to 1c and thought it could have been reduced more. I didn't do the oil reduction, and the muffins didn't turn out heavy.

These are delicious! I make them weekly and they are gobbled up everytime. I omit oil replace with applesauce--great recipe!

The muffin just will not raise. Maybe not enough soda.Over all i find one cup of oil is too much and make the muffin soaky.I will not make it again

These were tasty, but not great. Good texture and not too heavy. I omitted the raisins; would probably add them next time. Maybe add the crushed pineapple suggested.

Rating: 3
I love to cook but I seldom bake, so I was elated when these muffins turned out just perfectly. I added them to a brunch menu for a vegan on the guest list but everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. There are two muffins left and I'm looking forward to breakfast tomorrow (if I can restrain myself until then).

Rating: 3
Excellent. I omitted the raisins and nuts and substituted crushed pineapple for the apple per a suggestion. It made 12 regular muffins and 18 mini-muffins. I've been to a bakery that makes something similar to these and they top them with a dollop of orange-cream cheese frosting. I may try that though they are great as they are! (I also used paper liners which turned out fine.)

Wow, this is rich. But good.

Easy to make and wonderful to eat. Very moist and flavorful. Makes a wonderful Jumbo Muffin.

I've made this recipe twice, but I've cut out the fat. I replace the corn oil with the correct proportion of Sunsweet Lighter Bake (for more fiber and less fat). Also, I've tried this with pecans, which was great, but also sliced almonds (to prevent allergic reaction) and that was delicious. I serve this with a reduced fat or fat free cream cheese, mixing 8 oz with about 1 tablespoon orange marmalade and a teaspoon of honey. Just like carrot cake, but much better for you!

Rating: 4
This is the best carrot muffin I've come across. The first time I made this, all of my friends wanted the recipe. I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts instead ( which tasted better to me anyway). Usually I'd have to scale down the sugar, but this recipe was right on the mark. Definitely a 4+ fork!

Rating: 3
3 1/2 fork! The perfect addition to serve for brunch. Even my four year old loves them. Using 1/2 c. corn oil with 1/2 c. apple sauce worked great. Thanks.

Rating: 3
I just made these and they are quite good. I changed the recipe by making it more of a "morning glory" muffin. Like other reviewers I substituted apple sauce for half of the oil. I added dates, raisins and orange zest (couldn't believe the zest was left out :)). Very yummy...I'll try them again...but maybe with brown sugar rather than white next time.

Rating: 4
This is such a good recipe I would give it 5 forks if I could. A caterer in MA.

Rating: 3
These muffins are great - my kids love them and I have made them many times for school events. The only change to the recipe I made is to use less oil - only 2/3 cup. The recipe also works well when all ingredients are doubled. Mix neufchatel, grated orange rind, a little orange juice and powdered sugar for a topping or spread. Yummy!

Rating: 3
Great muffin recipe!! I was looking more for a "carrot cake" type of muffin and although this is not what I thought it would be, it was delicious! Definitely use the oil/applesauce and less sugar advice...

Rating: 4
This is an awesome recipe!! As crazy as it sounds, I wanted to make carrot waffles (ha-ha), so I found this recipe and just modified it somewhat. I only used 2 1/2 T oil, and used a cup of applesauce ( I didn't have an apple) and a half a cup of water ( I didn't have any milk). I also omitted the coconut and used 3/4 C brown sugar on suggestion from other reviewers. I cooked up a couple as muffins and put the rest of the batter in my waffle iron------AMAZING!!! They came out soooo great! Totally low-fat, really moist and very flavorful! I also made a drizzle/glaze of cream cheese and honey mixed together.......Oh baby!!

My boyfriend went to Costco and came home with about a 23lb bag of carrots (maybe a slight exaggeration). I've been looking for carrot recipes ever since. This one is fantastic! Like the others, I substituted applesauce for half the oil. You won't miss it at all. A silly bonus is that this recipe is from a famous golfcourse, and we are golfers!

Rating: 3
A nice,moist,very tasty muffin with the perfect amount of sweetness!~ I did make the following substitutions after reading all the other reviews. I did the 1/2 wheat/white, 1/2 applesauce/oil, 3/4 brown sugar(I don't like it too sweet), and I added a little nutmeg. I didn't add any pecans, raisins,or coconut. I think next time I would add a brown sugar crumble topping for extra sweetness.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous. I used the 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 white flour, substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil, skipped the coconut, and drizzled with a reduced fat cream cheese glaze. Perfect. I could eat these all day. They make slightly more than 18 if you're using normal size tins.

Great muffins. I also made a few modifications (substituted half the white flour with whole wheat, added some applesauce to reduce oil, used 3/4 c. brown sugar in place of all the white sugar). The muffins are loaded with carrots - a nice touch. Also, the small amount of coconut adds a nice sweetness but is not overpowering. I served these muffins to coconut haters, and they didn't even notice.

I've tried many a muffin recipe and these definitely top the list! The apple really adds a yummy tartness. If I make these again though, I will only use 3/4 cup of oil, as I found them a bit too heavy.

It appears that everyone who has made this recipe has made some sort of modification to it... So in keeping with tradition I substituted chunky applesauce for the apple and reduced oil and sugar both by 1/4 cup. Baking raisins worked extremely well in this recipe. They turned out great!

I used suggestions from other viewers. I love muffins in the morning and these were great. I left out the raisins and substituted 1/3 of oil with apple sauce. Cutting down the sugar was a good idea.

I do not like the flavour of applesauce as a replacement for oil so instead replaced just over 1/4 of the oil with low fat sour cream. The muffins were very moist. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 c and the remaining one cup was half brown, half white. Very tasty, definitely not too sweet.

Rating: 3
Very tasty muffins! I, too, substituted half the oil for an equal amount of applesauce and cut back the sugar to just under 1 cup. I was very happy with the muffins -- they were moist and had a great flavor.

These are great! Just like the Morning Glory muffins at my favorite coffee shop! They freeze nicely too, and my kids loved them!

By substituting applesauce for some of the oil as suggested and reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup, I have found that this has been an excellent way to get my 2-year-old to eat carrots!

Very yummy! Like morning glory muffins. I don't like lowfat applesauce things, so I made it the full fat way and I thought they turned out great. I chopped the apple instead of shredding it and made 12 big muffins, baked for approx 27 minutes.

Very nice muffin. It would also make a great cake covered with cream cheese frosting. As others suggested, I cut the sugar to 1 cup and altered the oil (2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce). I also omitted the salt.

Lovely muffins. I substituted 1/2 cup pureed canned pineapple for 1/2 cup of the oil, with good results (also cutting down on the sugar slightly and omitting the coconut). They baked in 20 minutes and were crunchy on top and nice and moist throughout.

Fabulous! Just like carrot cake! I made mini-muffin size for my 16 month old and piped a cream cheese frosting carrot on top for Easter. He loved them. I would try substituting pineapple for the grated apple for something different.

Very good recipe. As many others said, I used 1/3 of applesauce and 2/3 oil. I cut the sugar to 1cup. Everything worked perfectly. It was very moist and tasted great next day. I will definitely bake these again and again!!!

Rating: 3
I altered the recipe a bit due to what I had on hand on a snowy morning, but they turned out so well I will make them the same again. I used 1/4 c. macadamias rather than pecans and 1/2 c. raw sunflower seeds (that I toasted) rather than raisins. Used unsweetened coconut from my Indian grocer -- no creepy preservatives or chemicals. I only had two eggs, so for moisteners I used 2 eggs, 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. fat-free plain yogurt. I think yogurt is a good solution because to me, baked goods made with applesauce are 1. cloyingly sweet 2. all taste the same, no matter what sort of muffin they intend to be. Probably next time I will use 1/2 c. yogurt & 1/2 c. oil -- it didn't seem to cause any trouble. My boyfriend said "So -- are these the best muffins you've ever made?" Thus answering his own question. (I reserve 4 forks for Life-Affirming Experiences...)

Rating: 3
This is a great muffin recipe. I followed many of your suggestions, and split the oil and unsweetened applesauce 50/50, split white and whole wheat flour 50/50 (I may go 100% whole wheat next time because it was great), and used golden raisins. I will probably cut the sugar significantly next time, as these were very sweet muffins. The applesauce made them a bit "spongy", as it tends to do, but my kids love them that way. I left out the coconut (for my husband) and the nuts (for my little ones, although I would have LOVED them), and they are still the best. My dad asked for a doggy bag after visiting and tasting one!

These muffins are WONDERFUL! My husband LOVED them and didn't even notice that I substituted applesauce for part of the oil. As he was eating his first he requested that I make them again. Didn't have any problems with uneven baking as some other reviewers did, and used the recommended time. This recipe will definitely become one of my regulars.

Rating: 4
These muffins are delicious! Like some other reviewers, I found that the tops did not get done, but the bottoms did. I left the muffins on the middle rack, but turned the broiler on for 1 1/2-2 minutes after they finished baking. This made them perfect. If you live in the D.C. area and love the "morning glory muffins" from the Firehook Bakery, you'll love these--they taste just like them!!

Rating: 3
I was trying to use up carrot remains left over by my juicer and threw them into this recipe. Like other folks, I did a 50/50 oil and applesauce mix, and then added another 1/4 cup applesauce to make up for the dryness of my carrots. Very tasty!

i also substituted 3/4 cup applesauce and the muffins were fabulous; however, i've made the recipe several times and they never seem quite done. next time i'll bake them at a higher temperature for a little longer.

Excellent! Normally I'm not one to take the low-fat route in baked goods, however, this is definately a recipe where you should substitute some of the oil with applesauce. Next time I'll try 1/2 and 1/2.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the past 3 weeks. Everyone loves these muffins!! Like others, I substituted 3/4 cup of the oil with applesauce and they are still fabulous. My only complaint is that the muffins are too moist on top. I would like the tops to have a little crunch to them.

I had been looking for a hearty muffin w/carrots or zuccini. This recipe included everything I wanted, and is very tasty. Difficult to eat just one. I was a bit skeptical, about all the sugar so I added a little less, but would add it all next time. I would also add more rasins, and a tad more cinnamon next time, and if you do not have the cocanut, I do not think you would miss it much. Do not be alramed at how gooey the batter is, it bakes up fine. I have already e-mailed this to several freinds, and intend to give it a front spot in my Epicurious Recipe Collection Notebook. Very Good!!

My husband liked this recipe, and he doesn't like carrot cake. I reduced the sugar a bit, substituted pistachios for pecans, and made it in two small cake pans. I've topped it with the cream cheese frosting from the Triple layer carrot cake recipe, with a little cointreau added. By the way, 2 cups ended up being a lot more than 1/4 pound. This would be great for serving friends informally.

VERY flavorful muffin! Not a big raisin or coconut fan, but these ingredients blended well. I liked the suggestion of using applesauce in place of some of the oil. Also, the muffin was a little too sweet for my taste. I'll try using 1 cup of sugar next time. Really great recipe.
