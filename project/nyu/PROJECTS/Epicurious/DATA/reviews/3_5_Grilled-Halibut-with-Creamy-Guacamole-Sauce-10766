Best described as bland and a waste of perfectly good halibut. There are no flavors to this recipe. The avocado is neutral. It isn't "jazzed up" with peppers. The scallions do little for it. The quantity of lime was inadequate to blend a creamy sauce. Pass on this one.

You wouldn't normally consider pairing fish with guacamole...but boy, am I glad I did! The combination is excellent. I added a bit of cayenne pepper as the gucamole wasn't very spicy. Next time, I would add a bit of serrano pepper, and at least 2x more lime juice.

Followed other reader's reviews and added a garlic clove to the sauce along with a little cilantro. Delicious!

Most fish recipes on this site are catch-and- release. This one's a keeper. Used halibut filets in lieu of steaks and served with an Oregon pinot blanc.

Used Cod instead of Halibut...worked great. Forgot the garlic and regretted it...but it was still an awesome dish. BE CAREFUL with the lime, it can get a little tart.

Very nice. Made it with Escolar rather than Halibut, a fattier, meatier fish. Forgot to buy scallions, so used a leek. Worked, but needed a scallion.

This is better with a cod or rockfish - halibut has enough flavor on its own. Add in garlic, and I used mayo instead of sour cream.

I like the sauce but it didn't seem like a good match for the halibut.

Very easy, and the presentation is excellent. Fancy food for week night dinners. When avocados are in season this is a definite winner

We liked this recipe a lot, thanks to all the advice in the reviews. For the sauce, I used wine instead of water and added fresh garic. I also rubbed cumin on the halibut and spritzed it with lime just before grilling. Additionally, I treated the tomato garnish as a salsa and added scallions and some lime juice. This kept all the flavors the same but jazzed it up a little. Will definately make it again.

We made this last night and really loved it. We thought the sauce was a nice complement to the fish, especially garnished with avacado, tomato, and scallions. We added some garlic salt to the sauce and next time I think I would add some minced garlic to kick it up a notch. Also, the recipe doesn't make a ton of sauce, so you might want to make extra if you're cooking for a group. Not sure why some people gave this lukewarm reviews--it's very easy and very tasty!

I thought this was a decent recipe, but the sauce was a bit bland. Aesthetically, the dish was pleasing, and there was nothing wrong with the flavor- just not stellar.

This was a hit tonight and we'll probably have it again but I think I prefer more halibut flavor and less other stuff. It is an easy dish to prepare.

this was a hit at our house! We added a little extra spice and used light sour cream and it was great. thanks for the recommendation on the white wine...it added good flavor.

I made the creamy guacamole sauce to go with a different kind of fish - I can't even remember what it was now (sea bass?). Anyway, the sauce was very good.

The guacamole was really good on the fish, the only change I made was thining it with white wine instead of water.

Excellent Dish - We will definitely prepare this again. I used Light Sour Cream to cut calories, and subsituted red tabasco sauce and red pepper flakes for the cayanne pepper and cumin. Added just enough "kick" and really complimented the fish.

My husband and I drool over anything with avacados in it. This dish was nice because it's hard for me to get him or the kids to eat fish. He and I really enjoyed it, but the kids were grossed out. "What's that green stuff?" Someday they'll understand. I'll make this again, while they're at Grandma's eating mac and cheese.

Excellent dish.....the texture of the halibut is perfect for the creamy guacamole sauce. We broiled the fish on low in the oven for 4-5 min. a side. It's light and delicious. We also added a little green tabasco to the sauce...extra umph!

I thought this recipe was excellent! I added tobasco sauce and paprika to the avocado sauce to zest it up a bit. It made a beautiful presentation...my guests were very impressed!

My family loved this recipe. I also made a tropical salsa to go with the fish. We did add more garlic to the guac and thinned it with extra low-salt chicken broth, with great, great results.

Guac needed some garlick and/or jalepeno to give it a little boost but other than that very yummy with crusty bread and white wine.

This is good but not great. We felt like it needed something, but still can't figure out what. It's moist and creamy, but just needs a boost of flavor. We'll probably try it again and if we have any luck we'll review it again!

This was a fair recipe. We all like fish and Guacamole. But I cant say it was an exceptional dish. Basically I think I would use my own Guacamole recipe if I did try it again, and just thin it out.

Awesome! Great halibut recipe and so easy to prepare. We used non-fat sour cream and also served with white rice and hot salsa. Definitely a keeper!

One of my favorite food memories is eating this with crusty bread and white wine while sitting outside with a friend on a summer day. Delicious!

I wanted to cut calories, so I switched the sour cream for non-fat yogurt. Big mistake. The resulting sauce was too bland for halibut. I don't know how much difference my switch made, but I disliked it enough to ditch the recipe.

I made this recipe on vacation to Kauai. I substituted ono for the halibut. My husband & I loved it! I will definitely try again soon.

Excellent recipe - easy to prepare, and the flavors mix nicely. My husband loved it!

My family loved it! It was quick and easy. However, we used halibut filets more than an inch thick and it took more like 8 minutes a side on the barbecue.

Escondido is the "Avocado Capitol", so, naturally, we love this dish! The creamy sauce nicely complements, but does not overwhelm the fish.
