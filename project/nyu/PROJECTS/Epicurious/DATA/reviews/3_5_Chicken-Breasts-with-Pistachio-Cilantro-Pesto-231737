Easy. Simple. And absolutely delicious. I omitted the cardamom simply because I didn't have any on hand. Next time, I'll try it with -- however, I didn't miss it. The chicken was succulent, and the sauce was to die for. This is a great dish for entertaining but I can see this getting into the regular rotation, too!

Ok I found this recipe and thought it was gonna be great. Then I remembered that I had purchased a jar of the Cheesecake Factory's Spicy Peanut Cilantro Dressing and had it in my refrigerator. Voila! What a cheat! No prep time! I spread it under the skin, seared the skin and baked with more spread on top... fantastik and absolutely no effort!

Terrific dish that's easy and so flavorful. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast sliced thin and folded over a layer of the pesto with crumbled feta (about 1-2 t feta in each). I followed other reviewers' advice and used the whole cilantro stem and leaf and was generous with garlic, salt and pepper. I roasted the chicken for about 15-20 min, skipping the first step of searing in a pan. This saved a lot of time and was one less pan to clean. I served the chicken with Mediterranean cous cous (apricots & kalamatas) and steamed asparagus made for a terrific birthday dinner for my husband and our friends.

This was a really solid recipe, and by making the pesto in advance was a real time-saver for hurried dinner preparation. Like many, I omitted the cardamom to no negative effect. I also put a little bit of parmesan cheese in the food processor, which made it more like a traditional basil pesto. Surprisingly, the cilantro flavor was not very pronounced. I also doubled the amount of lemon and cut back a bit on the oil. I spread the resulting paste on grilled chicken breasts and served it with thinly sliced zucchini.

The pistachio-cilantro pesto was savory and delicious. I followed the advice of others and omitted the cardamom. I'm a garlic-lover, so I added a bit more to the recipe. Definitely a tasty alternative to your basic pine nut-basil pesto. Will definitely make this again!

Wow! I love basil pesto. So I was a little skeptical at first as I thought that the cilantro would be too strong but this tasted absolutely wonderful. I used boneless chicken breast. Because of this I cut the time in the oven by half. My husband ate the pistachios before I could make this so I substituted freshly toasted pine nuts. I cut about one inch off the bottom end of the cilantro and used the whole bunch instead of just leaves. I added one additional clove of garlic as I do with most recipes. I love basil pesto, but with the taste of this cilantro pesto and cilantro being a fraction of the cost, I think Ive found my go to pesto recipe.

This pesto is delish. Had leftovers of it over cheese the next day.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and always get rave reviews. I am a caterer and often use my variation of this recipe for large crowds as it is delicious hot or at room temperture. Here are my changes: I use bone-in, skin-on thighs for added flavor (they also turn out juicier), I omit the cardamom, I use raw or roasted pistachios (whatever I have on hand), I adjust the lemon/garlic/salt levels after processing the pesto depending on how strong my garlic and cilantro are. Also, no need to pick the cilantro leaves as this recipe goes in the food processor--just chop off the part of the stem that doesn't have any leaves and use the rest. Great chicken dish!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Really a great flavor combination. I didn't even need to serve the sauce on the side. I reserved it for a rotisserie chicken or whatever else makes sense. It takes a little more time picking cilantro leaves (compared to basil) but it's well worth it. Some smaller stems remained in the pesto with no noticeable difference. I used roasted unsalted pistachios from Trader Joe's (easy). I grilled the chicken and lathered the pesto on for the last 10 minutes.

I had serve this dish for 3 or 4 times with diferent kind of guests. Every time someone ask me for the recipe! I allways use lime instead lemon and never use cardmom

This is my all time favorite pesto recipe. The flavor combination is rich and subtle and a welcome change from the more common basil pestos. Rather than cooking the chicken with the pesto under the skin, I recommend cooking the chicken separately, adding some pasta, and then mixing in the raw pesto. This preserves the subtle fragrances of the pesto. I would give the pesto recipe by itself a rating of four; I only gave it three because I thought the chicken cooking method left something to be desired.

I tried this recipe and followed it to the letter. Quite frankly I was disapointed and would not recommend it.

good recipe, i added more cilantro, can be bland, suggestion is to add a few mint leaves and lots of lemon. As per one suggestion I did add feta and rolled up some chicken breasts. Served with lemon marinated crimini mushrooms on top and voila! Really yummy

Great recipe. Find hulled pistachios and save yourself some time. I like to slice the breasts down the middle, spread the pesto inside, and put a big ol' slice of quality swiss cheese on top before grilling or baking. I also like substituting lime juice for the lemon The pesto goes great with fish when used sparingly.

I made this a quite a while ago and just found that I never posted a review. Though I did omit the cardamom as I didn't have any on hand - it's a great variation on pesto and overall taste - everyone loved this dish. I will be trying some of the variations that were mentioned in other reviews.

I actually rate this just shy of 3 forks. (between good and delicious). I thought it was very flavorful and the ingredients worked well together. I just didn't think this was an outstanding dish.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I made it as is with the exception of an additional clove of garlic and my chicken breasts were boneless/skinless. The only thing I would change next time is I would buy regular roasted pistachios, I didn't understand the need for raw. We loved this meal!

I made this for a luncheon of 40 people and I only heard very positive things one of which was "this is the best chicken I've ever had". I used skin on boneless chicken breasts. I tripled the recipe and had plenty of pesto for all forty chicken breasts. I only used one teaspoon of the cardomom for the whole recipe because I thought it was a little bitter. I stuffed the pesto under the skin, seared them on the flattop and finished them in the oven. They were moist and the skin held in tons of flavor-and kept the pesto in very neatly. I served it with hummus, quiona/chickpea salad, and fresh veggie salad. I think the pesto is even better when cooked-although I did drizzle the chicken with the raw pesto when I served it.

This dish is ok, but with all the nuts and olive oil, it's a very rich pesto and the recipe calls for much more of it than you need. My boyfriend loves pesto and can eat pistachios for days on end, but this was too rich for him.

Rating: 0
This was wonderful! The nuts and the cilantro were an inspired combination. I substituted large chicken thighs and browned them before stuffing rather than after, as suggested, letting them cool before inserting the mixture. Thus my pockets didn't flatten and spill. I also used lime rather than lemon, worked as well.

Fast and Easy. Will definitely make again. Be sure to really pack the cilantro - a lot is required. Used leftover sauce on Lamb for Valentine's Day. YUM

Rating: 3
The pesto is wonderful just as written! One reviewer said they could not taste the cilantro - my guess would be they didn't pack it down. I measured about 4 cups of loose cilantro leaves that packed down to 2 cups... I used boneless, skinless breasts and pounded them flat. Put tbsp of pesto and a slice of swiss cheese in each and folded over and secured with toothpicks. Browned them on both sides in pan with olive oil and then baked for 25 mins. DELICIOUS! And the pesto is excellent on couscous.

Rating: 3
Wonderful instense flavor. The cardamom is not for everyone, but I really liked it in this dish where it was muted by the pistachios. Not having breasts with skin on, I merely baked the chiekn with the pesto underneath and then topped them with more pesto when serving. They were great. I served this with the carrot caraway soup and found them to be a great match.

I have tossed large cooked shrimp in a bowl w/ the pesto instead of using on chicken. Quite good.

Simple, and a very unusual taste. Fresh cilantro and pistachios are the key. The flavor is nutty and the texture a little dry, but if the chicken is moist it's oustanding.

What a waste of good pistachios. The flavors of the nuts and cilantro were overpowering and did nothing to add to this dish.

This dish was great. My husband and friends raved about it. Made a few substitutions for on-hand ingredients: Pine nuts for pistachios, ginger powder for cardamom - but it was still fabulous! Will definately make again.

This was great! As suggested by another reviewer, I used boneless, skinless breasts and pounded them flat, spread the pesto and some feta cheese in the center and rolled them back up. Delicious!!

This was easy and such a wonderful change from our hum-drum chicken recipes. More garlic and more cardamon are a must for flavor, though! And the paste does need thinning out a bit at the end, although I am not sure it needed any more olive oil... I used it with the skin, but no bones. It needs the skin for the taste-- trust me! Really tasty!

I took a lot of lazy shortcuts, and my very picky housemate loved this better than anything I've made, saying "I feel like a KING eating this stuff!" My lazy shortcuts: I used nutmeg instead of cardamom, I used boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders, and I used salted, roasted pistachios (omitting the additional salt and the roasting step from the recipe). I'll be asked to make this again and again.

I made this dish for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The pesto is amazing-- I really love the combination of Pistachio and Cilantro. I added very little goat cheese on top of the spread on the chicken and that made the dish even better. I would make this dish again, as it really is different and delicious.

The only thing I changed was adding a little extra oil (grapeseed in this case). Great recipe. I'll be making this a lot. Try using this as a base on a seafood pizza with veggies instead of tomato sauce. Awesome!

I didn't give it one fork because my husband thought this was a great recipe. I was disappointed. I used all the cilantro and neither of us could taste it and I used the correct amount from the recipe. I thought the pesto was BLAND and too oily. I thought the chicken had no taste. Usually I find the recipes on epicurious great, this is not one of them. Keep searching and make something else

I followed the recipe without any changes (well, by mistake, I added too much garlic butit really worked for the recipe). The pesto was very good, but both my husband and I agreed that we'd prefer it with a delicate white fish. Will definitely make again with fish!

absolutely lovely, easy to prepare and a good do-ahead dish. I made this for my book group meeting, and ended up giving the recipe to several members (one was going to ditch the menu she had prepared for a party the next day and do this instead). The left overs were lovely, and the extra pesto was delicious stired into cous cous to make and unusual salad. Highly recommended.

This is so easy and tastes so great! We made it for a dinner with 24 adults and 3 children. Also, for our vegetarian friends, we just added the pesto to some sauteed tofu cubes. Everyone raved about the meal. I made it a second time just for us and it was still very very good and easy. This is definitely a keeper and repeater.

I made this for a girls night out dinner. I left the cardamon out of the pesto (because I don't like it). Turned out wonderful. I served it over pasta that I mixed with the extra pesto and paired it with Big House Pink.

Absoulutely LOVED the pesto!!! But not the bone-in chicken breasts. I think next time, I'll take a boneless/skinless breast, pound it thin, layer the pesto and maybe some cheese. Then roll it up, skewer it and brown it. Flavors are great, but too much work cutting the meat off the bone, also not enough pesto for me.

This recipe is fantastic...made the dish once, per the recipe, and thought it was great. Made it a second time, substituting lime (the true companion to cilantro) for lemon and doubling the (freshly ground) cardamom, and thought it was excellent. I will be making this one again, that's for sure!

Based upon the rave reviews given to this recipe, I'm afraid I'm in the minority when I say that I was not impressed. Although the recipe sounded interesting, I found the overall instructions & ingredient list to be poorly written & the end result to be bland & very so-so. I'll take basil & pine nut pesto over this concoction any day.

The pesto sauce was a bit on the thick side for my tastes -- next time out I'll cut back on the pistachios. Great flavor. I agree with the comment about not skimping on the pesto under the skin -- I used more than the 1 tbsp. called for in the recipe. The pesto helped moisten the chicken as well as add flavor.
