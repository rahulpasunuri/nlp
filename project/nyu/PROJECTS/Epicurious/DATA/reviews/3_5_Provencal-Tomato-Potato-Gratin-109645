I made this by mixing home-grown cherries, sliced heirloom tomatoes and sliced russet potatoes in a gratin dish, oiled and salted as suggested. It roasted up just fine and was a hit at the table.

I enjoyed making this dish, it did take some time to get the casserole prepared and it was truly worth the time. The thyme in this dish was the gane-changer for me. I used it fresh however can imagine similar results. This recipe was better preparing with my friend; I washed vegetables, removing unattractive parts, while she cut. This was a pleasure to maker alongside someone else. I highly recommend this to you. Also, extra spices, triple garlic, thyme, pepper were good. Try it! And Enjoy it! :)

nyc cook is exactly right. parboil the potatoes, use canned tomatoes (the best you can find) and the recipe becomes very simple and still as tasty.

this is a lot of steps. I prefer Ina Garten's recipe for vegetable tian. It also calls for zucchini, but the result works better because everything cooks at the same time. If I have to go in and out of the oven this much I'll make cookies.

Way too many steps and too much trouble. Just get out your $25 mandoline, slice potatoes thinly and then layer them with 1/4" sliced tomatoes. Or, parboil thicker potato slices and layer with tomato slices in the pan. All this separate pan nonsense - stick it all in the oven and have a glass of wine!

I've made this a couple of times now and it's been a big hit on each occassion. Maybe someone with a more refined palate would disagree, but I don't think you gain that much flavor using fresh basil and thyme instead of using dried versions.

If you make the recipe as is, you undercook the potatoes and overcook the tomatoes. This just didn't come together.

The first time I made it, I sliced everything too thin. It was dry and somewhere between subtle and bland. So I did it again with the right thickness ingredients, and it was vastly superior. Also, used fresh tomatoes. I did up the garlic a bit in the topping and used gluten free breadcrumbs. Got raves and was very tasty. I used nonstick pans for the prebaking and a Corningware square for the broiling. It worked fine. I like the "stripes" of alternating rows in a single layer, more pizazz in the presentation.

Recipe reads like it's complicated, but it isn't. Made it with red potatoes and with russets and it was fine both ways. I grated parmesan cheese over it the first time because I didn't think the dish was tasty enought. The 2nd time I increased the salt and pepper and it was fine. By the way, I also learned to make a simlar dish using alternating slices of russtet and sweet potato, topping with a crumb mixture using Thyme and Parmesan instead of basil.

while good, it didn't blow me away. My husband said he really liked it, but hasn't touched the leftovers ...

I made this recipe after reading all the reviews. So I tripled the garlic, cooked the tomatoes and potatoes a little longer (my husband and I are all fashioned, we like vetables cooked just right, not half-cooked as is the fashion in Edmonton (Canada)restaurants. I find the salt and pepper measures amusing. They depend so much on tastes! Anyway, it is a good recipe reasonably adaptable.

My mom said this was the best potato dish she had ever eaten. As she has eaten a lot of potatoes in her life, that makes this recipe a definite winner in my book.

So my husband and I had a different result than the previous reviewer!! I made the recipe as listed except sliced the potatoes too thin - they need to be 1/4" thick! I put the roasted potatoes in the bottom of a porcelain tart pan, put the tomatoes on top, etc. We both loved it. I served this along side Monkfish Saganaki. FYI: there is a similar recipe ont his site with feta (or goat) cheese and kalamata olives that may be worth a try.

Way too much bother for the result: a bland dish, with little or no characters. Having to use three separate baking pans just to prep the ingredients was a total turn-off. While I think it could benefit from the addition of, say, goat cheese, I'm not sure this recipe is worth trying to improve.

I thought this was wonderful, but my husband thought it was just okay (didn't like the texture of the tomatoes). Used baby red potatoes and romas straight from my garden. Do try this, it is so simple!

This is delicious. I substituted Italian breadcrumbs rather than plain. I will make it again.

This was perfect for a summer luncheon. I didn't put it in a single layer at the end. I had the potatoes on the bottom, then the tomatoes, then the crumbs. mmmm...

Glass dishes can't go under the broiler, at least mine (Pyrex) can't.

Yes, but it says "NOT GLASS" - can't figure out why they would specifically exclude it?

The acid in tomatoes can be reactive with some metals (like aluminum) which can lend a metallic taste to the dish. This is why glass or ceramic dishes are preferred.

Why does it matter if the roasting dish is glass or not? What is the difference?
