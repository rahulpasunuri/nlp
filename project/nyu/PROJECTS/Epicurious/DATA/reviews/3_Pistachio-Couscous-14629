A good accompaniment to our lamb dish, this recipe was liked by all. Definitely coarse chop the pistachios, as their flavor and crunch add a nice complement to the mint and lemon. Use the best olive oil you can find and this dish just sings. I used half chicken broth and half water and it was very flavorful and moist.

i really liked this couscous, it had a nice, nutty flavor. however, we found it a little on the dry side. it would be great if you add about 2 or 3 more T of oil if you can spare the calories or chicken broth might work too.
