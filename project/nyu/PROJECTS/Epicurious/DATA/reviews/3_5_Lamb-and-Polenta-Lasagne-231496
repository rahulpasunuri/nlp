I've made this several times and it's always good. Needing to use up some CSA vegies, this time I sauteed some onion and garlic with the lamb, and then added some chopped kale to the mixture. I also broiled some eggplant slices and put them between the two polenta layers. It was great with the extra vegetables.

Have been looking at this recipe for some time now before deciding to make it. Thanks for the other reviewers suggestions..I made it with a bechamel sauce instead of the cheese, added cinnamon and allspice, and caramelized onions I had frozen last summer. Even tho I did try to cook down the tomatoes to nearly dry, I still had a little more water in my lasagna than I wanted. Next time, will make my own polenta as did others and cook the sauce even more! It was very tasty and VERY filling and made terrific leftovers!

I love this recipe. I have to tell you that I had polenta on hand and didn't have lamb. (well, not ground lamb), so I made an italian variation of this recipe. I used grass-fed 1lb ground beef. And I still used 2 cans of tomatoes as suggested, but changed the spices a bit. I used 1/2 of an onion, 3 cloves of garlic, dried parsley, basil, oregano and a bit of red pepper (and s&p). I decided to add the allspice too to give it a bit of earthiness. I also added a pinch of sugar to tame the acidity of the tomatoes. And I used Romano cheese mixed with mozzerella. It turned out fantastic! My husband loved it too! I over ate of course. Be sure to let it sit for a while before serving. Great recipe. Thanks!! Next time I'll try lamb.

Great, easy recipe with some basic modifications. Don't bother with the food processor but instead purchase 1 28 oz can of San Marzano tomatoes --no need to drain these.. I added 2 caramelized onions to the recipe. I also added cinnamon and allspice to the meat. Remarkably great taste for such a simple and easy to make dish.

Rated only 2 forks as I made many modifications. Easy, tasty (with reviewers additions) but not 'quick'. If I had not made my own polenta, this may have speeded things up but with the other revisions it still would not be a quick prep meal. Made in a 8x11" lasagna pan, made polenta, then baked on jelly roll pan for 15 min. and cut out sheet to fit bottom of lasagna pan, then "noodle" strips for top layer. Unfortunately, the polenta was 1/2 inch thick, next time will ensure only 1/4 inch. For the tomato sauce - added sauteed onions and garlic and chopped fresh mint; ensured sauce reduced per recipe. To the lamb - added sauteed onions & garlic as well as cinnamon. Can't imagine how this lasagna would be without the sauteed onions and garlic. If making in 8x11 pan next time, could add 1/4 - 1/2lb more lamb. Also want to try bechamel sauce next time. Mozzarella was good but think bechamel would be a good revision.

Besides making sure to properly reduce the tomatoes, I would definitely add caramelized onions and sauteed garlic to this dish, as well as a bit of cinnamon and black pepper to the meat. Another thing that I did that took this over the top was to replace the cheese with bechamel sauce topped with fresh grated nutmeg...

I followed a number of the changes recommended by other reviewers and this is now one of my all time favorite meals.

I have made this several times, and everyone loves it. It is important that the sauce is reduced enough, and when cooking the lamb and tomatoes, no liquid is left in the pan. If you do these 2 steps it shouldn't be watery and you should get rave reviews.

This recipe is great, especially the next day. Adding a little bit of sautéed onions or garlic to the meat, to taste, adds a little bit of flavor. The wateryness comes from the polenta, making your own can reduce it significantly. This dish, while good after letting it sit a bit, is absolutely fantastic after a day in the fridge. Wonderful leftovers!

This recipe needed some help as it was. I usually hate when people completely revise a dish, but I thought this one had promise, so I made some changes myself. To the tomatoes (which I did not puree) I added sauteed onions and garlic, and chopped mint. To the lamb, I added more sauteed onions and garlic, and spices: allspice, garam masala, cinnamon, pepper-- just to taste. I also made my own polenta, added a little curry, then spread it thin in a large baking sheet. After it cooled I cut it into strips like lasagne noodles. I used plain shredded mozzarella and added some crumbled feta. The dish was delicious! Sorry for all of the revisions, but I felt the recipe could be better...and it was!

This was great. Next time I might try to make the polenta so I can layer easier and do not have the discs. The flavor is so good. It is a easy and impressive dish. Great the next day to.

I have made this several times. Usually I use ground turkey, part-skim mozzarella, and a "flavored" polenta and it is delicious! Very simple - the only thing I have found is that I MUST take the time to reduce the sauce. It can be a bit watery, but we never mind. Great for a quick, hearty, simple dish!

Reducing the tomatoes significantly seems to resolve 2 of the problems others mentioned -- it is not watery (unless your polenta is watery) and the tomatoes begin to carmelize, intensifying the flavor.

This recipe was very easy and I actually made a vegetarian version with soy round, but all the polenta made for a very pasty entreé. My husband usually loves polenta, but hated it done up this way. We will not make it again.

I made this following the recipe exactly. I did not find it "watery" as the previous reviewer did, but it was somewhat bland. My husband and daughter liked it, but we all agreed that it would probably be better made with ground sausage and some added garlic or spices. Having said that, it's a good recipe if you like your food on the mild side. After I make it again with some changes, I'll submit another review. Oh, and one more thing: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 400. I had to go and find the magazine -- I was glad I hadn't thrown it out.

Very tasty but a bit watery. Next time will make sure sauce reduction is complete. also do not overbake as cheese becomes rubbery.

Very tasty but a bit watery. Next time will try reducing the sauce a little more.
