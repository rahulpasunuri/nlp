This recipe sounded great. I only made one alteration. I make it using a graham cracker crust for the base. In my opinion it improved the recipe because it definitely needed a lot more cookie. I had a lot of trouble finding chocolate wafers in the market and almost gave up when I found some in the Goya section. I also did not have an easy time finding espresso powder. In a pinch, one can use instant coffee. Anyway, this recipe was a little too sweet for my palate. I also think it had too much cream and not enough cookie. It was like eating a bowl of delicious whipped cream with cookie crumbs in it. If I were to do it again, I could think of a few other ways to do this. Maybe use all graham crackers (because they are less sweet than chocolate wafers, or thin biscotti. Maybe even ginger snaps. The last layer of cream with more cream should have a layer of cookie in between. This could easily be topped with toasted almonds. What would really finish this recipe off would be a little booze. Amaretto perhaps. It's just missing something.

This dessert is SO good! I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I used Oreo's, scraped out the inside cream, and those worked great. This recipe was easy to follow and measurements were accurate. The cake was rich without being filling or overly sweet. This is a show-stopper - I can't believe I made it myself!

This was very easy and it was well received by my guests, though I think next time I'll punch up the flavor a little more even. I went EZ for this though. I bought a pre-made chocolate cookie pie! Mixed heavy whipping cream and sugar with the mascarpone cheese. Since some suggested it would be bland, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and that helped. Next time I'll probably use two even. For the layers of cookies I couldn't find wafers so I used Oreos, scraped the cream filling off and placed them out symmetrically for two layers with cream between each. The final cream layer I added some condensed instant espresso that I mixed in a small bowl. The mix added a subtle coffee flavor and honestly I think I'll just do exactly that again but for all the layers, not just the top layer. The oreos never got completely soft and cake-like, and my guests liked that it had a little crunch. I followed advice here and froze it overnight and defrosted all day in my fridge. Very easy, tasty and popular.

Note: since these amounts are so small, a small mixing bowl (6.5 diameter tapering to 3base & 3.5 tall) and hand held mixer makes this easier. I adjusted this recipe to one 4.5 springform: 1.5 TBsp sugar to 1/2 cup heavy cream; 1/4 cup (56 gm) mascarpone; divided total mixture into thirds and made the layers starting with wafers and ending with mixture. I froze it for 4 hours and then refrigerated it for 4 hours; the resulting texture was perfect. For espresso cream: 2.25 tsp sugar & 3/4 tsp Medaglia Doro Instant Espresso Coffee to 1/4 cup heavy cream. I then tried a reviewers improvement. Again I adjusted it to one 4.5 springform: 2.25 tsp sugar to 1/4 cup heavy cream; 1/2 TBsp vanilla extract (reviewer used sweet marsala) to 1/2 cup (112 gm) mascarpone. BUT I used Trader Joes Triple Ginger Cookie Thins for this version and omitted the espresso or any whipped cream topping. To those with access to TJs, I highly recommend these ginger thins, plus they contain no PHF or HFCS. For both versions I always added a splash of vanilla extract to any heavy cream. My husband and I enjoyed both versions and thought the ginger thins were amazing in this cake.

This was easy to make, but I was a little disappointed. It might have been better if I had added more mascarpone as some others suggested, but as printed here it just takes like a big plate of whipped cream. Definitely not something I'd serve to a sophisticated crowd.

Very good, and not too hard. This actually reminds me of a cream cake my mother used to make back in NY with peak freens ginger cookies held upright and covered with whipped cream. That was even easier as it was made at least a day ahead. The cream would soften the cookies and you could cut the cake with a fork. Anyone know how to get Peak Freens in the UK?

Rating: 4
One of my favorite simple desserts to make. The cookies soak up the liquid from the cream and become very cake-like. I've made this many times. I did once have a problem with it being runny, and I now keep the cake in the freezer overnight before moving it to the fridge. That really works well to keep a firm consistency. I have added a third layer per advice here, and that's a great tip. I have also used other flavors - Chambord instead of espresso cream, coconut extract, peppermint for the holidays, the possibilities are endless!

Rating: 3
Quite nice, and very easy. I used an 8 1/2" springform pan, added a base layer of the Nabisco chocolate cookies (easily found at Central Market), and used 2 cups of mascarpone because I love it and I wanted a little firmer consistency. I piped the espresso cream on top instead of frosting to save time. Froze overnight and put in the fridge during the day while I was at work. Worked perfectly.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Very simple to make and the results were great. I took everyone's advice of adding more cookies, I still had only 2 cookie layers but overlapped them more. I made this the day before and just left it in the freezer, then put it in the fridge in the morning. The consistency was just right, it stayed together very well and I had no problems cutting it into presentable slices. I also followed the advice of decorating with chocolate covered espresso beans, interspersed with raspberries...made it look very impressive. I will definetly make this again!

Rating: 4
This is sooo easy and wonderful....I actually put a layer of chocolate cookies on the bottom so it would cut more easily for serving and then used a pastry bag for the espresso cream and decorated with it....also used chocolate covered espresso beans for decorations amidst the piped espresso cream. Got rave reviews....and perfect for a summer dessert with no oven to deal with....

I took this to a picnic in an oblong casserole dish. I refrigerated the mascarpone and wafer layers overnight and added a layer of espresso cream and wafer crumbs on top just before leaving the house. It was a convenient way to serve the dish and most coffee lovers enjoyed it. For a few people, the espresso cream was overpowering, so I would consider serving it on the side the next time.

Rating: 4
I agree with the user who suggested 3 layers of cookies, I've done it both ways. Also, Williams Sonoma has something called Vanilla Bean Paste which is vanilla in a syrup sort of thing, and a tablespoon in the cream makes it a little amber colored, but full of flecks of vanilla beans and SOOOOO yummy. Next, I'll try mint!

This cake was delicious and refreshing. We really enjoyed it because it was not a rich dessert but had great taste. The recommendation of doing three layers is a great idea. I had a large amount of crumbs to put on my cake, so I coverd the whole cake.

This was great. Everyone I served it to loved the recipe.But the chocolate wafer package has 45 cookies in it. So I would make another layer of cookies (14X3= 42 cookies). The remaining 3 cookies are enough for the crumbs. Otherwise the crumbs cover the cake.

I made this for New Year's Day, and it got rave reviews! The next time, though, I will use a glass trifle dish and put the cookie crumbs on top!(Reason being because I couldn't remove the ring of the springform pan without the cake cracking, so I improvised by covering the cake with the crumbs instead!) My husband said it was the best thing we had to eat that day(at HIS mother's house! Happy New Year To That!)

WOW, this was wonderful and got several requests for recipe. I made some additions: made another layers of cookies. Next time, I will fill in all the gaps with cookies. Might make the espresso layer from some of the cream and mascarpone. Not sure why one would need additional cream on top of cream. The best part was that I topped the cake with leftover pecan praline topping (chopped) from another epicurious recipe. It was fantastic. Recipe is in the epicurious search. Enjoy.

I agree with several other reviewers who feel that a little extra cookie is called for in this recipe. It did seem a bit like a pile of whipped cream with a little cookie interspersed throughout.

I know I am going to be reaked over the coals for changing the recipe and then reviewing it but here goes!

Super yummy and I think the berries cut the richness a little.

What a hit! The chocolate lovers loved it, the non chocolate people loved it. The left overs were quickly claimed and my Dad licked the cake server! The only comment was it could use more cookies in the layers. I agree and since I had more crumbs than I needed, I will add more cookies next time. Also, I wonder if I could use Oreo crumbs instead?

A great recipe. I easily found the Nabisco wafers at a local Hannaford market. I did sprinkle each layer of the wafers with a generous tablespoon of Amoretto as I assembled the cake. I used some instant coffee (decent brand) that I had previously purchased for another recipe. A very rich dessert, but also quick and easy.

My husband's mother used to frost Nabisco chocolate wafers with whipped cream, let them sit for awhile and then serve them as a special dessert.

I found this recipe to be delicious and well worth it! Very easy to make and impressed my guests a great deal. A few comments: 1) If you can't find the chocolate wafers, Newman's Own also makes a version called "Tops and Bottoms" chocolate wafers which are widely available in organic stores. I think they taste better than the Nabisco wafers. 2) I agree with the cook below who suggested increasing the proportion of mascarpone, which makes the texture and flavor a bit more substantial. 3) I had to freeze mine for several hours in order to get it out of the springform in one piece.

International Coffees makes an instant coffee called Cafe Fracais that would work wonderful in this recipe. It can be found in any major grocery store. Safeway also has their own labeled instant coffee by the same name. Whilst Oreo cookies will work as a subsitute, stay with the Nabisco Famous Chocolate Waffers if at all possible. The Oreo taste to me is like flour with some chocolate added for flavor. The Nabisco Waffers are like chocolate with some flour added to bind it into a shape. You will know the difference once you taste one. I am sure you will agree.

I used the instant international coffee- cafe francais from safeway. The flavor of this cake was very good, but I didn't like the consistency. It was like eating a bowl of whipped cream with cookies in it. Maybe because it was so hot at my house but it took forever to whip the cream. I thought it was too much whipped cream and not enough mascarpone. And it didn't really have a base. I might try a cookie pie crust next time. I'll try it again with alterations. the family loved it, but it wasn't quite what I expected.

Not as sweet as I'd expected, even with the espresso cream. Very rich and creamy texture, with very subtle flavor. I had no problem finding instant espresso powder (Cafe Bustelo is sold at Publix Supermarkets, even in Birmingham, AL), but I could not find the chocolate wafers, and I checked three stores. I attempted to do as another user suggested -- using ready-made Oreo chocolate crumb crusts, but 2 is NOT enough. I ended up making an espresso cream PIE this time around. Next time, I will widen my search for the wafers.

This is nothing special, I would even say boring. I dumped most of it in the garbage not wanting to waste calories on eating this. Save your chocolate wafers for the cookie and cream log instead. In fact, I would suggest making a log with the cheese/espresso creams instead, using a higher proportion of chocolate wafers and less filling.

To the previous reviewers asking about the cookies: I buy them either in the baking aisle or the cookie aisle-- they are most often next to the graham crackers. They look like giant oreo cookies, minus the middle. They come stacked, about 30 or so cookies in a clear package. But if you still can't find them, I have also used straight oreo cookies; don't even bother to scrape the filling off. Hope this helps.

Wonderful For anyone having a hard time finding chocolate wafers: you can easily make your own. I've seen many recipes in different books....I make the ones in Alice Medrich's Bittersweet (her cookie book contains another, slightly different version). Obviously this is not a dietetic or healthful recipe, but at least you can avoid high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oil, preservatives, etc.

This recipe sounds great! Just found it - will try it soon. In reading the reviews....the instant espresso is "Medaglio d'Oro" - an Italian brand. It's usually available in market with a good coffee section, or an Italian deli, or the like. I've used this product for quite a few years now in various recipes. It has a much richer flavor than just using instant coffee.

I made this for a dinner party in late August. WOW. We started with bruschetta, the tomatoes and basil were fresh out of the garden. The main course turned out even better: Lemon and olive chicken, mujadara (not the one from this site)and garlic roasted green beans and red peppers. I was feeling pretty proud of myself and served the dessert. They went crazy! Die hard non dessert eaters ate every bite, saying it was the best dessert they've eaten! Of the whole meal, this was the only recipe anyone (and everyone!) asked for. I will definitely make this again, it was wonderful. I did make two slight adjustments: Like other reviewers, I had trouble finding the cookies so I gave in and bought a pack of oreos. I just opened them up and scraped off the frosting. It worked beautifully. And as for the espresso powder, instant coffee works fine. It gives the right flavor, maybe not as rich, and there are no granules (from ground espresso beans, as someone had suggested) Works for me!

I must admit that I made a quick version of this. (Cheated for time sake). I used a chocolate cookie crust, but made the filling as written, but with 2 cups cream only.

I will make the icebox cake eventually, but the filling is delicious in a pie too!!

I had to try this because of all the good reviews. I could not find Nabisco Famous chocolate wafers, but did find some chocolate wafers at a Asian grocery store when I was there for something else. The mascarpone cream and the espresso cream tasted wonderful, but my wafers became chewy! It wasn't bad, but I had expected it to be like a regular wafer. Because of the chewy wafers, the cake was very difficult to cut and looked like a big mess! I hope the taste made up for it for my guests! I think the problem may be that I left the cake in the freezer for about 8 hours (because I forgot to take it out!). I will try it again leaving it in the freezer for only 1 hour.

OUr Mothers (Grandmothers, depending on your age) used to make a similar dessert in the 50's & 60's. I made the recipe on the famous wafers box, and had a caterer ask me for the recipe!! Everytime I make it, everyone says that they cannot find the cookies, yet almost every store in town carries it. As someone has already mentioned, look first with the ice cream or the fixings for ice cream. Occaisionaly it will be up on the top shelf on the cookie aisle. There is absolutely NO substitute!!! It is a most versatile cookie. Use it and they will think you are a gourmet, and there is very little effort!!

to Indy: This is simply an elaborate version of an old fashioned ice box cake. As a child we had a family cow and could never find enough uses for all the heavy cream so this dessert turned up on a regular basis. Do yourself a favor and use the chocolate wafer cookies. The result will be much different with lady fingers, etc. The Nabisco coolie is getting harder to find, it used to be a pantry staple. You should not have to pay 4.00 a box, they retail for about 2.89. Once you locate a vendor that stocks Nabisco products ask to order a case. They keep a long time in the freezer and have other uses.

For "A Cook from Singapore": It helps to read the recipe over again. There are 16 tablespoos in a cup so the half cup is 8 plus the 1 T which does equal 9. Also the 1 cup mascarpone cheese is added to the whipped cream so that is why you can add 1 1/4 twice and the the rest on top. Don't worry - we all do this sometimes!

For those of you having trouble finding the Nabisco Famous Wafers: They have always reminded me strongly of the cookie part of Oreos. (I wouldn't be surprised if they're basically the same thing.) I wouldn't use Oreos with the filling, but if you're dying to make this recipe and have it be the way it's intended to be, you could unscrew Oreos and scrape off the cream. Or just use the side without cream, forcing you and your family to eat the halves with the cream. A tragedy, I know. The chocolate version of the Nilla wafers is really pretty different in both texture and flavor from the Famous Wafers and I don't think it would be a good substitute.

I haven't made this recipe yet (gotta go hunt for the instant espresso powder), but I am sure you could use Splenda instead of sugar.
