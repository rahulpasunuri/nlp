Be careful to cook the wheat berries and barley separately! I hastily skimmed those directions and cooked them together. Took over an hour and the wheat berries were a tad mushy. The recipe is good but slightly dull. Using fresh sweet corn helped. I added a little cayenne, lemon juice, cilantro and lots of olive oil. The parsley salad was great.

Better than the sum of it's parts. I've been making this salad since it first was published in the mag in the 90's. It's always very popular, even with people who have no clue what it is, and are "traditional eaters". I like the way the vinegar starts to break down the moz just a bit as the salad sits and flavors meld a bit. I usually just use plain moz, not smoked.

This is a really wonderful summer salad (or anytime, I suppose)...I've made it for two gatherings, each time to rave reviews, with the exception of using grape tomatoes instead of cherry. The first time, I made it exactly as written, the second, the store was out of smoked mozzarella and the red onions looked awful, so I used Vidalia onion and pearl mozzarella, and it STILL got rave reviews! It's a very versatile dish that appeals to meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I would agree that a little boost of vinegar/oil wouldn't hurt it a bit, and it's VERY good the next day (and the day after that, if you're lucky enough to have any :)

Fantastic. I usually make this salad without barley, but it's great with both. If you don't chop the red onion very fine and soak it in ice water, it can be a bit overpowering.

This had a nice texture, but could benefit from more fresh herbs, and perhaps a slightly higher oil to vinegar ratio. We found it to be much better the next day.

Loved this. I substituted pearl fresh mozzarella for smoked, because I don't like smoked mozzarella, and chopped tomato for cherry tomato. I think next time I would take out the red onion and only do green, but it was still totally delicious no matter what.

This was my first time cooking with wheat berries, and I really liked it. The combination of the wheat berries, the barley, and the cheese has a great texture, and the cheese gives the salad a great smoky flavor. It's really great. I was cooking just for myself so halved the recipe, but otherwise I made it as written.

This is fantastic. the texture and taste are exceptional as is, and it was the hit of the party with absolutely everyone going back for more.

This is my favorite recipe on epicurious.com. The combination of the chewy wheatberries with the sweet juicy tomatoes is great. I've made this dish a million times, and it's still fantastic. Simple, healthy, and tasty!

Excellent made exactly as specified. It was a big hit at our office party. Tastes great a day or two later too.

I did not have high hopes for this, but I happened to have wheat berries and smoked mozzarella I needed to dispatch with. What a surprise--it was scrumptious! I used extra tomatoes to balance the edge from the raw garlic. Also glad that I used my good basalmic in generous amounts. I highly recommend this--if I were in college still, this would be a major grub-fest!

I have made this several times and received nothing but rave reviews and requests for the recipe (or that I make it again myself). I only made the parsley salad once; it was not well-received and in my opinion, totally unnecessary. IThe main salad is a great alternative to the usual picnic potluck side dishes, and I have served it with tamales for New Year's as well.

I agree with misyb, the first reviewer. While I liked the texture of the wheat berries, I found the flavor combinations uninteresting. Rather than make the parsley salad, I added parsley to the salad with a litle additional oil and some lemon juice. Don't understand the need for a separate parsley salad.

Fabulous! I multiplied it times 10 for a party for 100 as a side dish. Didn't use the tomatoes, used pluotes instead, they added a gorgeous color. Also, I used raw corn for an excellent crunch. Didn't use quite as much onion. Everyone raved about it and at least 10 people asked for the recipe and I was asked to bring it for the next party I was going to! It's a very elegant side dish, does not come off as a health nut boring thing, comes off as very elegant and different and superbly delicious!

This is delicious...and a great recipe for the pressure cooker. I did both grains (together, at the same time) in the pressure cooker for 30 minutes, drained & rinsed with cold water and then did the rest. Much faster. This is so good, and a great vegetarian meal.

I thought that this dish was fun and had a nice texture to it. The cheese was chewy and the wheat berries chrunchy. I think the key is top notch ingredients (because it is so simple). But, I got a lot of compliments in it at a dinner party. I gave some to my mom a couple days later and she wanted the recipe--so it keeps well. I would recommend it only as a side dish though.

Made this as a side dish to grilled sausages. Served it along with a green field salad. It was delicious. Used regular fresh mozzarella instead of smoked and did not make the parsley salad. Made sure the tomatoes were sweet and tasty which I think makes a difference. Makes a large portion, will serve it again this week for lunch.

Chewy and delicious, really hearty. I calculated about 250 calories per serving, if you divide it into 12 servings.

Delicious! This is easy to make, filling, and attractive. Wheatberries are exotic and a new taste experience for many.

I love this recipe! Nice combination of flavors. The chewy wheatberrie make it a refreshing departure from traditional summer salads. Reminds me of the type of interesting salad you'd find at a Whole Foods deli or other upscale market that offers take out.

Pathetic, I know, that a native prairie girl hasn't tried a cracked wheat salad (in my defence, we're known for our beef here in Alberta, not our wheat). This is a great dish! I didn't have smoked mozz so I used smoked cheddar which I'm sure is just as good.

Delicious. The grains provide a nice texture and sweetness. I roasted the corn for extra flavor. If making the recipe in advance, you may want add a little extras olive oil before serving.

Spectacular! I have made this many times for many different occasions and always have someone request the recipe! Makes quite a large quantity, and the leftovers are great! Excellent side dish at our annual holiday tamale party! The parsley salad is not necessary; I made it the first time and no one ate it.

Have made this dish several times and each times it receives rave reviews! People can never quite figure out what is in it (the wheat berry/barley combo.) It is perfect for a summer picnic. The smoked mozzarella add a wonderful smoky flavor; chop it into fairly small pieces or it can be overpowering. Didn't like the accompanying Parsley Salad...

We really liked this salad. Because I love to cook so much, I always play with recipes. I always seem to change something due to what I have in the frig and stocked in the pantry. So, in this one I used sauteed onions and garlic, a little more vinegar, cheddar cheese, and a can of drained diced tomatoes. I liked this so much I shared the recipe with a friend who also likes to cook organically!

Didn't like this one, although it sounded good (we love wheat berries!). Something just wasn't right.
