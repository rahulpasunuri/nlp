This was just ok. Very healthy but a lot of chopping for only a little flavor. It might work with more garlic and herbs and a little red pepper sauce but my family didn't like it enough for me to try it again.

Wonderful! I used rotini pasta instead of pappardelle, because I thought it would be a better match for the chunky sauce. I increased the garlic & tweaked the amounts of herbs to my taste, and also omitted the garbanzo beans & just used a whole can each of white & kidney beans- leftover bean problem solved! To those who complain about lack of flavor, etc- you have to make the recipe your own, TASTE while you cook, add more herbs & spice as you go along. If a dish is still a disappointment when you serve it, whether to 1 person or (oh, the horror!) a party full of guests, then you only have yourself to blame for your failure. Try something more familiar next time.

Healthy and delicious, not to mention fantastic colors on the plate. Drives me crazy when a recipe makes me open a can of beans and then says only use part of it. Like: what am I supposed to do with a tiny amount of leftover kidney and garbanzo beans?? I just tossed the whole can in there, it was fine.

Yummy! Even my kids liked it. Wonderful textures, flavors, we loved it all, and loved the idea of a meatless entree. This is a new addition to the tried-and-true recipes for family & friends. A must - using the pre-cut squash - saves a ton of time & effort, it's worth the price.

I have made this 3 times. I did not think this was a lot of work to make. I usually roast the butternut squash w/onion and rosemary then toss in w/ the other veggies. I also do as others have suggested and cut down on the number of types of beans - I usually just use cannellini and they are great with this dish. They key to this dish is to use top-quality parmesan cheese. A top-rated veggie dish meat-lovers will also enjoy.

This was great! Contrary to other reviewers, I thought it was somewhat quick and very easy to make. You just have to buy the ALREADY CUBED butternut squash, which is available at almost any market these days. I used 12oz of squash, which I recommend - great flavor and texture. I also added a pinch or two of sugar to balance out the acid of the tomato and enhance the butternut. I only used kidneys and garbanzos, totaling 1.5 cups instead of 2. I think the full 2 cups of beans would have been too much. I also substituted mushroom broth for the wine. It turned out great - even my non-vegetarian husband found it flavorful and hearty. Next time I'll make enough to freeze.

This is a labor- intensive but satisfying recipe. I loved the hearty flavors and made my own pasta to complement the yummy textures of the ingredients. This is probably the most delicious vegetarian dish I've ever made.

This was fine and good, but nothing special

This dish does take some work, yes - particularly prep work - but it's worth it! It's all sorts of flavors and textures -- and the pappardelle pasta is just lovely. It is true, however, (as an earlier reviewer commented) that you'll have several cans of unused beans sitting in your fridge just begging to spoil. I suggest you make an extra large portion of this dish, use all the ingredients, and have company over --they'll love it!

This recipe is a lot of work, but well worth it. When I make this, I double the recipe and freeze half of it since it does take a lot of time. Excellent recipe!

to shash56: there's no reason why you can't use dried beans in this recipe- i did, and it was great. just soak and cook them ahead of time. it requires a little prior planning, but tastes better anyhow.

No forks because I haven't made the dish - this is by way of an editorial comment, not a review! I am single, cooking for one, and I am always frustrated by recipes, such as this one, that require use of only a part of a standard package of any ingredient. In this case, it's those 3 partially-used cans of beans that will sit in my fridge until they spoil! I can only eat so many beans in a week, and the recipe will make 4 servings - that's plenty! Why can't recipe inventors think more practically and create recipes that will actually fit into most purchasing patterns? This one could have used dried beans, which keep more or less forever once you open the package, and given you a shot at being able to use up the whole thing. And yes, I could just throw out the unused canned beans but as a child of parents raised in the Depression, throwing away "perfectly good food" is simply anathema. There, now I've vented and I feel better.

I am vegetarian and this dish sounded intriguing, but the amount of ingredients required is ridiculous. The taste was OK, but not worth the effort.

I made this recipe for 10 guests based on the reviews of the others. No one took seconds, and I recieved no comments on this dish, and was left with ton of leftovers (which I promptly threw out). I cook a lot and executed the recipe as instructed. Definately will not make again. Too much prep for a very mediocre result.

the whole family loved this dish, and none of them are vegetarians. i forgot to add the parsley, so next time i will have to remember to put it in. i also skipped the white beans because it's easier to just add two small cans of the other kind so that i don't end up with leftover beans in my fridge.

I decided to make this again, and I had to revise my earlier review. I enjoyed it thorougly, and with a little planning, it was quite pleasant to make. I found myself wanting it again, and this will be third time I've made it this month.

My wife is a vegetarian so I am always searching for "main" dishes that are filling and tasty. I'm getting better and this dish is a help. Truly, even if she were not a vegetarian I would make this again. It is, as one reviewer said, a lot of work but well worth it.

Nice flavor, but it was quite a bit of work.
