This wasn't all that bad! I did use stock as some other users had mentioned (this one: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/reviews/Brain-Boosting-Broth-51124600?cached=F&savedReview=true). I doubled the recipe, used frozen corn (fresh corn is no longer in season and I was just trying to use up my half-tub of leftover silken tofu), and used a bit more garlic (about 3 cloves for the doubled recipe) which I added to the onions for a couple of minutes after they had softened, before adding the rest of the ingredients. My husband and I both had several bowls. I like the fact that this recipe uses tofu instead of milk, as I prefer to have iron in my meals as it's easy to have calcium as a snack. I didn't like the fibrous skins of the corn that were there despite pureeing, but I guess that's just how corn is. I pureed too much of it (left out one cup instead of two) which was a shame...

I thought this was simply horrible. I'd actually give it zero forks if possible.

I love this recipe - as a jumping off point. It needs a lot more flavor and my version was awesome. I used vegetable broth (can use chicken broth) instead of water. I also added some dried thyme to the onions while they were cooking. My toddler LOVES this soup!

Hint: whenever epicurious says to use water in a soup, substitute chicken broth, or, if you must, vegetable broth. voila, flavorful soup.

I thought this was good but not great. I used fresh corn, as the recipe calls for, and thought that really made the dish. I am not sure why the cook below would have used canned creamed corn: I'm sure preparing it that way WOULD turn out dreadfully.

Okay--I thought it was edible. Nothing spectacular, but fine. I wouldn't make it again only because there are tastier corn chowder recipes in abundance. I did, however, actually MAKE the recipe (unlike the previous reviewer who made up his OWN creation and then gave IT a bad review....some people just amuse the heck out of me!).

I prepared this recipe with the following changes: I doubled the quantities. I used butter instead of oil. I added ½ of a shredded dried hot pepper for flavor. I added 3 Knorr chicken bouillon cubes. I used one can of creamed and one can of whole kernel corn. I cut the tofu in ½ inch squares. The soup was quite good until I pureed it. Then it turned into a gritty mass similar to a curdled cream sauce. It looked unappetizing and did not feel good on the palate.

I found this dish quite bland.
