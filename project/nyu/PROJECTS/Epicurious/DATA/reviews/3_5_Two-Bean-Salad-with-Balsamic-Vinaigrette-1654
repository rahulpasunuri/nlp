A good basic salad, but was under seasoned. Needed some citrus.

I make this all the time. It's easy, fast, healthy and tastes great. I find that it gets even better the longer it sits in the fridge. The only thing I do different from the original recipe is that I add a bit more balsamic vinegar and a little less oil. Delicious!

I modified this, I didn't have any black beans or parsley so I just used garbanzo beans, red onion, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt pepper and cumin.

This has become one of our neighborhood favorites! I use cannelini beans in place of the garbonzos. I also use less oil and add some cucumbers. I agree with other posters that red pepper would be great too!

Wow, I make this all the time. I think I made it for every picnic last summer -- it is super easy to "play around" if needed, but I like it just as is. Really good and good for you, too:-)

Very bland, even with the addition of diced red pepper. Keep looking there have to be better recipes than this one....

First time I made this recipe exactly as written. It is very good, but I made a couple of simple changes which I think really made it better. I used both parsley & cilantro and added dried cumin - yum!

I messed around with this a bit but kept the idea the same--i used black beans, corn, two tomatoes and kept the rest the same. My family loved it!

Delicious! I make this recipe all the time, and love it. It's delicious as written, or served on lettuce leaves (Bibb is lovely) or yellow rice. I almost always add diced red pepper and celery, and sometimes fresh diced jalapenos. yum!

A nice spin on the bean salad theme. I made it as written, and someone at the party said it was the best bean salad she'd ever eaten.

Great salad to use as a side dish, or on its own! I added corn, as another reviewer suggested, and it was terrific!

Have made this twice, once with garbanzos, once with cannellini, it really makes no difference. I added the red pepper as suggested in previous reviews AND some blanched frozen corn. Increased the balsamic by one tablespoon. WOW! colorful, tasty, and healthy. My husband wants it everyday with his sandwich at lunchtime. Will add tuna to it in warm weather and have it as a main course. This is a keeper!

In addition to the ingredients listed, I half tiny grape tomatoes and chop red pepper in as well. This is our favorite bean salad, colorful, healthy and delicious. Everyone always asks for the recipe.

Yummy!!Excellent easy dish for summer BBQ's. I added diced tomatoes.

Yummy! I added diced red and green bell pepper...it gave it a nice crunch. I also used cilantro instead of parsley (I grabbed the wrong one in the grocery store) it added a nice flavor. Great for a Sunday BBQ!

Nest time I will include less onion; it was a bit overpowering for my taste.

tasty and extremely healthy. family loved it and only asked i add green beans as well. next time though, i will cut back on garlic a tad. it was a bit overpowering.

My husband and I are both crazy for this recipe; it's a lazy person's vegetarian dream with a couple of strong, wonderful flavors giving the beans some bite. I often double the recipe and we get several meals out of it; it is also a favorite at my office potluck. Garlic, onions, olive oil, legumes: eat this often enough, and you'll live forever....

My husband and I love this recipe. It's great to have a low fat side dish in the fridge for lunches or just snacking. Super easy and quick.

Perfect salad to bring to a gathering. Great taste and pleases a large audience. I added a little extra balsamic, I thought the amount of garlic was just right, and added red bell pepper. I'll try it next time with celery and cucumber too, for more crunch.

This dish was fast and simple. The first time I made it I used all chick peas and the second time I used both chick peas and black beans. It was delicious both ways. I believe you can use any beans you have on hand. It's the balsamic vinegar that makes the dish. Great for a bring-along dish for a barbeque.

This was nice on a bed of lettuce that had been tossed with a little olive oil. A very easy salad for days when it's too hot to cook. I used two cloves of elephant garlic instead of three regular cloves, but it was still too pungent - and I am someone who likes garlic. Next time I would use less or else sauté the garlic for a milder flavor.

This is a great salad, especially on a hot summer day. I often add extra vegetables such as celery, cucumber, and red pepper. I sometimes leave out the oil, or give it just a drizzle to reduce the fat and it really turns out just great. Definitely a keeper.

I try nearly every promising-sounding bean salad recipe I encounter, and this is terrific one! It was enthusiastically consumed by my husband (who generally wishes I wasn't so devoted to the pursuit of the perfect bean salad). It's very quick and simple to prepare, too. Although I'm extremely fond of garlic, I thought the flavor was a bit too strong, and will scale back to 2 cloves when I next prepare it.

This is an absolutely GREAT recipe! I am not a huge fan of bean salads, but I will definitely be making this salad again and again. I didn't have any parsley so I just left it out, and it still turned out wonderfully. I will try adding it in the next time I make this (probably very soon)!

This recipe is super. It's easy and flavourful. I make it often with many different kinds of beans and it always turns out very tasty, and it's perfect for a summer barbecue.

I think that this is a great recipe. So easy and a great taste. Since I don't care for garbanzo beans, I substituted great northern beans with great success. I served mine slightly chilled like another cook had suggested. I might try soaking the beans the next time, (if I have time), to see if they retain a better texture than the canned beans. Great picnic dish with the spicy fried chicken!

VERY delicious and I recommend serving slightly chilled rather than at room temperature. I had large garlic cloves and still used three but would have preferred using less - and I'm a garlic fanatic. My guests loved this dish and so did I.

Very good. Added lima beans because my husband loves them.

I am not a "bean salad kinda girl", but this is fantastic. I took it to work and between 10 people and 3 other dishes available, the beans were completly gone by lunch time. Not to shabby for a dish the can be thrown together in no time flat!

We liked this easy to make dish very much. We used it as a side dish, rather than main dish. Husband,who is a vegetarian, really liked it. I, who am not too fond of beans, had 2nd helpings. My 17 month granddaughter just loved it, and kept leading me to the refrig. for more. It was even better the second day.
