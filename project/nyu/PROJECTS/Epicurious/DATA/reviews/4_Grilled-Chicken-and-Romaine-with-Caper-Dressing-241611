This is really wonderful and so easy. On a hot Arizona evening it really hits the spot. I did marinate the chicken longer and doubled the dressing. Did not use all the dressing but nice to know you have it if needed. Don't pass this one up!!

Surprisingly good. I have made this many times for a weeknight dinner. The dressing is amazing.

Delicious...I marinated the chicken all day (and added a little extra homemade dressing; next time I think I'll double the dressing recipe). I am a huge fan of grilled romaine...LOVED IT!

I made this a few weeks ago and it was incredible. Very easy to make and the flavors are really noticeable with the homemade dressing. This is definitely a keeper.

My whole family loves this recipe. I have made it ever since I found the recipe in the magazine. For those of you who think the dressing is a bit tangy for your taste, try adding honey to it. A little garlic powder along with the salt and pepper on the chicken doesn't hurt either. I love the dish just the way it was written but have no problem experimenting to make it even better!

Delicious, easy and fast. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is very good. The dressing was a bit tart for my liking, so i added 1 1/2 tbsp. plain lowfat greek yogurt and that helped a lot. I served this with veggie skewers and it was very visually appealing. Will definately make this again!

The chicken was good, although not great. Probably need to marinate at least an hour to bring out the flavors. The romaine, however, was fantastic!

We made this dish over the weekend for friends and it was a huge hit. The chicken was very moist and the lettuce tasted terrific. Even those who skeptical of "grilled lettuce" loved the combination. Served with Corn and Tomato Scramble for a perfect hot summer night meal.

Very good! I used boneless, skinless thighs and marinated them for about 2 hours. I also subbed garlic for the shallots. Lastly, wanted to make use of a head of romaine that I had on hand. I had to tie a string aound the hearts to hold them together - that worked perfectly. GOOD STUFF!

Dressing was great, but my romaine didn't turn out so good. Not sure what happened.

taste to effort ratio is EXCELLENT! i used the full dressing recipe for two breasts and was glad i did, though cut back the oil to 1/3 cup. was perfect!

I really liked this dish but my husband was thrilled with the grilled Romaine. I would make it again but toss the romaine and the chicken together and make it into a salad.

I think that this is fantastic as well. I've made it for family members and they all love it. I'm making it tonight for my parents. My mom is a fantastic cook and I'm anxious to see how they like it.

I have made this many times. The dressing is so good that I usually double it so I have more on hand for later in the week. I've tried grilling the lettuce...but I prefer the lettuce uncooked...so I assemble this as a tossed salad with sliced grilled chicken on top and some fresh garlic croutons. Easy, delicious and it appeals to everyone I serve it to...including the kids.

Wow, I made this last weekend and thought it was so healthy and good! I'm a sucker for capers but the dressing was so yummy and I really liked the charred romaine, I'll definitely be making this again.

This tastes great! It's healthy and easy to make. I decreased the oil to 1/8 cup without the dressing being watery. It looks fancy and if you slice the chicken thinly, can be prepared in less than 10 minutes. Lettuce looks pretty and tastes interestingly intense. I will definitely make this again.

My fiancee and I loved this. The taste of the dressing is similar to that of ceasar dressing, but even better. Grilling the lettuce gives this dish a really unique flavor. I would suggest sprinkling the chicken breast with a little garlic salt before grilling to make it more interesting (garlic salt is my secret weapon with all types of chicken). This has become a regular in my menu rotation.

Easy and delicious. I went with a bit less vinegar, as recommended by the other reviewers, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I served with potato salad and a red cabbage salad, and loved the colors. I rarely make anything twice, as there are always new things to try - but this recipe, I will make again, because it was unusual, easy, and fun. If I were to serve it to company, i might try quartering the lettuce, as it is a bit imposing on the plate.

My very picky kids LOVE this--it's a regular at our house. Easy, too!

Really yummy- anything with grilled romaine is outstanding. The acid level on the dressing was a bit much- I would cut down on the vinegar next time.

This was a great light summer dinner! The only change I would make is to put less shallot in the dressing. I found it to be a bit overpowering.

Terrible....followed directions as is and the chicken flavor was inedible. Neither my husband nor I liked it.

Very tasty. I added a bit more mustard and vinegar to the dressing, and we really enjoyed it. Very filling as well.

Delicious! I made a bit extra dressing . Do the romaine quickly on the grill at high heat. The first time I grilled it too long and it was tough.

Delicious supper salad! Basted the chicken with the dressing/marinade while on the grill, very flavorful and moist. Served with the Oven Fries with Whole Grain Mustard Aioli from this site.

This recipe is deffinitely a keeper !! I can't wait to serve this to our next dinner guests. The flavors are incredible, and grilling the romaine on the BBQ was so delicious, who would have thought....I grilled a large head of romaine, and my husband and I wanted more. Simple and so YUMMY!!

This dish was an unexpected triumph. It is rare that you find a healthy, clean dish with such complexity of flavor and textures that is also simplicity itself to prepare. We liked this so much that I served it 2 nights in a row. My daughter declared, I could eat this every night! I also grilled a large, white onion cut into ½  slices to go with the salad. My son suggested toasted pecans and Ill be including those next time. A definite keeper!

I got rave reviews on this from my husband who is rarely thrilled by chicken breasts. I loved this as well and was very surprised by the delicious grilled lettuce. A keeper!

This is definitely a keeper for a week night meal. Great dressing on both the romaine and the chicken. I'll be making it again and again.

My husband and I were disappointed with the chicken, but we liked the caper dressing and will make it and the grilled romaine again, perhaps with salmon.

Wonderful. Next time I'll only use one shallot, it was very strong.

Great for a week night. Tastes like a grilled Caesar salad. Healthy too! If you like this, also try the Grilled Chicken with Basil Dressing from this site.

Simple and easy. Toss some grape tomatoes in the dressing and grill as well. Forgot to buy shallots but it was still good without them. Had never thought about grilling romaine before, but it turned out to be my favorite part of the dish.

A Hit. Easy to make. Usually not a fan of capers but used tiny non-pareil capers and the taste was great.
