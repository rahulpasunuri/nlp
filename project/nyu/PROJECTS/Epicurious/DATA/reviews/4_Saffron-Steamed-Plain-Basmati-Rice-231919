This recipe is amazing. I have several Persian friends with secret family recipes for saffron rice. They talk about how many hours it takes. This was a quick simple way to get fantastic results. It is so great to be able to make it myself!

I enjoyed this rice at a friend's dinner party and it was honestly the best, most savory, rice I've ever had ! Kind of a fussy recipe... but I can't wait to try it in my "smart" rice cooker.

Just made this again and it was perfect. This time I buttered the foil. And I "flipped" it out of the pan right after it sat on the damp towels - so it came right out, and the foil peeled right off the crust of the rice.

First time making this dish I'd leave 2 hrs. It was an enjoyable experience! And successful. I followed the recipe exactly. Didn't have a large non stick pan, so used the foil. The rice and crust did not just come out when turned upside down, so we carefully removed the rice, then picked up the foil and crust and laid it ontop of the rice. Then we carefully peeled the alum foil off the crust. It took a little patience. It was delicious. Well worth the extra effort.

Great recipe. I wasn't able to achieve the crust (still getting used to the electric burners). So instead, I scooped off the rice and just left a thin layer and cooked it on high heat for about 5-7 extra minutes. The crust came out very nicely.

I did the rice cooker method and the taste was great however I did not achieve the tah dig, the delicious crust, because my rice cooker turns off after the rice is cooked.

PERFECT INSTRUCTIONS, excellent all around, I l didn't use the yogurt, and it was fine. Using the nonstick pot is key, however.

Excellent! I made accompanied this dish with Lamb and it was a big hit. I will definitely make this again.

I used the first method (without the steamer). I have made a similar recipe before, but I think this is even better. The bottom "crust" is crunchy and beautiful! I use a paper towel between the pot and the lid and also poke a few holes in the rice with the handle of a wooden spoon during the last step to better release the steam.
