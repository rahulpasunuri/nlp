I agree with the other reviewers in that there is too much chocolate (and I like chocolate). It overpowers the delicate meringue and ends up tasting like a chocolate chip cookie without any texture to balance it out. Maybe the suggested chili powder and clove will give it some complexity.

Actually, you can improvise on the same theme.... instead of cinnamon, create a mix of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and chili powder (trust me) in addition to the chocolate... it is incredible

It was AMAZING. I used unsweetened Ghirardelli chocolate and it worked out great. I added a little extra sugar to compensate. Followed the cook times exactly and it worked perfectly. Nice rich chocolate flavor, melts in your mouth!

Quick recipe, very light pick-me-up, and not too bitter as another cook commented (perhaps you have to like bittersweet chocolate in the first place, or use milk chocolate instead?). I also only used half the chocolate specified in the recipe, and it was plenty. (A vegetable peeler is a fast way to turn a hunk of chocolate into usable form.) I did, however, have to tweak the times. After 30 mins. in the oven, my meringues were nowhere near firm to the touch, so I consulted other meringue recipes and went with 45 mins - 1 hour (turning down the heat to about 200 degrees would have been better). Don't know if this is the recipe's shortcoming or my oven's. I also fought temptation and left it to dry in the oven overnight. Best of all was the cleanup -- this is a non-fat recipe so things just rinse right off.

Great!!! Everyone loved it, even the kids!!! I actually used half of the quantity of chocolate quoted in the recipe, and substituted it for orange-flavored Valhrona chocolate and it was excellent!!! leaving it to dry in the oven for over an hour made them overly dry, though...

YUM! This was my first stab at meringues, and they were great! They needed a little drying out in the oven to make them crisp, but the chocolate and cinnamon is a GREAT combination!!! I used Ghirardelli's Double Chocolate Chips crushed... They were heavenly! Recipe needs to be doubled.

I would make this again, but without the chocolate. Being in the oven for 30 minutes burnt the chocolate slightly and made the meringues bitter. However, I don't have the best oven, so that could have been the reason.
