I double this recipe and add finely chopped red bell pepper also. Gives it some nice red color.

This recipe is very good. I also suggest serving it with some lemon wedges on the side to add juice to taste. Perfect for when you are heading to a potluck or asked to bring an appetizer for a holiday dinner, since you can assemble it at home then just pop it in the oven when you get to your party!

Tried this for the first time at a Thanksgiving gathering. It went very fast. I live in the Southwest so I like it alittle more spicy. Will add a tad bit more hot sauce. Will make this again Christmas Eve

This is my favorite dip. I absolutely love this stuff! I make this with Alaskan King crab leg meat. Sometime I use shallots, sometimes green onions, sometimes some of each. I leave out the Old Bay seasoning because there is already enough salt in the other ingredients.

this recipe was great everytime i make it everyone wants the recipe.

This is a massive hit at every gathering I've ever brought it to. Adjustments: more crab meat, sour cream instead of mayo, scallions instead of onions, more hot sauce, and I also add a bit of ground mustard. 10 minutes before taking it out, I sprinkle a layer of shredded parmesan cheese on top. Good crab meat is CRUCIAL.

Not healthy but sometimes you need to treat people--I made this for a bridal couple party, and the groom was doing back flips! Get good crab, don't skimp on that.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was amazing! The crab was the star of this dish as it should be. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again and again.

This was a surprising hit. Two people practically devoured the whole thing in one sitting!

Made exactly as written, and it was quite delish. Would be great to double, triple, etc for a party. Will definitely make again, but only once in awhile since it's certainly not low-cal!

Super good. Easy to double or triple for big parties and goes FAST!

This is a yummy, although calorie-laden, dip that is satisfying. I've made it several times a year since the recipe debuted. Could drop the calorie or fat content by using fat-free or low calorie ingredients but I think you would miss the mark. I used 8 oz of crab, used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo for the mayo portion, and used a bit more cream cheese since I added more crab. Spooned it into four ramekins instead of one baking dish. Put two ramekins into the oven for a shorter baking time (one each for my husband and me) and refrigerated the other two for another meal. Also sprinkled shredded parmesan over the top after baking and broiled to melt and slightly brown the cheese. Serve with warm crusty baguettes. A fab addition to a big green salad.

I quadrupled it due to a large party, and I found it very lemony. I added garlic salt and cayenne to taste. Would probably cut back on Old Bay if I were to make it again.

I make this frequently. It's very good, and very easy--a real "wow" hors d'oeuvre that comes together fast and is virtually foolproof. It's a bit expensive, but worth it. And I often doll it up by using shallots instead of onions, espelette and celery salt instead of Old Bay, and goat cheese instead of cream cheese. It's superb!

Most delicious. I say that with a caveat. I followed the other suggestions to use sour cream instead of the mayo. And...here's a biggie...I used 16 oz of crab meat instead of 6 oz. I couldn't find a 6 oz container. I found an 8 oz container, but right next to it were 16 oz containers and they were a much better deal. When I got home I forgot to save half for later...anyway, I added a little more sour cream, added some mayo...and everyone devoured it.

Made it as-is and added 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese. I was lucky enough to have fresh blue crab meat. It was gone in 15 minutes !

Good advice from other cooks. I substituted in sour cream for mayo and green onions for onion, plus added capers, garlic salt, and some "cajun spice" (why not). A bit too lemony when cold, but works just right after it comes out of the oven. Worth doing again once the stock market rebounds and I can afford the crab meat...

I gave it 3 forks because I tweaked it, but it is absolutely easy and delicious. It gets rave reviews at every party. I added 1 tsp of dried mustard and 1/2 tsp of paprika and I also substituted sour cream for the mayo and increased the cream cheese to 6 oz instead of 4 oz.

I actually came to this recipe for the oven temp. because I had a whole pile of filling left over from a stuffed mushroom recipe. Amazing enough, the filling has almost all the same ingredients as this dip except chopped mushroom stems. I thought it was lacking in taste but I tweeked it and added another can of crab as well as more seasoning.

I just made this dip for a dinner party tonite, and it turned out great! I doubled the ingredients, substituted garlic salt for old bay, and green onions for onions. This will be my go-to recipe for crab dip!

Very good, easy to make dip - important to use good lumpcrabmeat. Has a little spice to it which is nice.

I too felt the need to tweak this. I added horseradish and some Worcestershire sauce to make it more zippy. I also double everything and measure nothing. Turned into the most effing awesome slop ever, I make it for our "Snacks for Dinner Sunday" all the time. Served with some cornbread crackers or a baguette and you have a little bit of heaven.

All my company loved this recipe. I substituted sour cream for the mayo and I added freshly grated parmesean cheese on top before I baked it. It came out wonderful!

I make something similar to raves every year. No worries with flavour: 1/2 cup onion, sautee'd with some butter or olive oil, first. Skip the mayo, I use light cream cheese and then a bit of grated sharp cheddar (just 1/4 cup is enough) and in addition to the Old bay, lashings of black pepper and 1/4 cup minced coriander or flat parsely.Add crab,lemon juice,tabasco,old bay as recipe. Pile it all into ovenproof dish with two slices high-quality white bread torn up and slightly pressed into the ingredients, drizzle with a little butter. same time in the oven. sinful and great.

Excellent recipe, and easy to adapt to taste. (I double the recipe for guests, reduce the cream cheese by 1/3rd, double the onions, and increase the crab. For double batch I use 16oz.) Absolutely delicious, every time.

I revamped a few items. Cut the 4 oz. cream cheese to 3 oz. light cream cheese, omit the mayo and substitue with 1/2 c. light sour cream, used 1/4 c. chopped sweet Vidalia onion, 2 T. fresh lemon juice, 3 T. Old Bay seasoning, 2 T. Tabasco, 2 T. sweet Paprika, 3 T. finely chopped garlic, 1/2 c. grated Parmesan cheese. Mix everything together, except reserve 1/4 c. Parmesan cheese. Pour into casserole and bake at 375 til bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese and sprinkle with Paprika. Serve with carrot sticks, red, green, and yellow bell pepper slices, low-salt wheat thins. Leftovers are delicious spread on sourdough rolls (split in half) and broiled. Top with grated cheese of your choice.

Easiest, so far only hot crab dip recipe I came across that didn't require blender/food processor. It worked so well. Substituted Worcestershire sauce for Old Bay. Served with additinal Tabasco on the side for those who wanted more hot.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I can now add it to my culinary abilities along with the veggie platter and fruit salad!!! I used the krab once ... couldn't find the good stuff ... and yuck. Also, being the lazy cook that I am, I choose to nuke it for about 2 minutes (adjusting the time depending on how hot you want it). It might be better baked, but nuking works.

I served this this weekend with saltine crackers and rosemary and sea salt flatbread. I omitted the onion due to the tastes of my group, but I also think it would be good just as written. I would also try adding Worcestershire sauce next time. Overall, very easy to make and tasty, a keeper!

p.s. absolutely no mayonnaise! Just cream cheese and a little sour cream if you need it to be looser. No mayo!

I make a crab dip like this but for those who are finding too little flavor I add a few heaping spoons of fresh horseradish and some healthy shakes of tabasco. It does not overpower the crab and it really kicks up the flavor. Canned or fresh is fine.

Blah. What a total waste of expensive crabmeat. Too much mayo, no real taste whatsoever...could have been tunafish...next time I'll just bite the bullet and make crab cakes!!

We liked this. We used canned crab claw meat (oh, the horror!!) but doubled the amount. Next time I would reduce the mayo AND cream cheese as it was kind of runny and just "too much". But certainly it was easy and all of us - including and 8 & 10 year old - like it. A good dinner on a rainy summer night.

I made this for a party and it received a lot of raves (my friend left with the recipe). I used canned crab meat and it was still delish. Sliced french baguette rounds go perfectly with it.

oh yeah, and i used 1 pound of crab instead of the 6 oz. it recommends.

this is real good, be careful not to sprinkle too much old bay at the end, it could get TOO salty. and be sure to use fresh crab! it was devoured immediately

try one tsp sherry instead of the hot pepper sauce- amazing! sliced baguettes compliment well- everyone loved this dip...

This dip is simple and just right, just the way those from the Chesepeake would make it. Sprinkle w/a little Old Bay when it comes out of the oven. Get the good crab meat, not the weird fake stuff or the shredded canned meat. Trader Joe's has crab meat much less expensive than Phillips.

I made this crab dip as an appetizer for Xmas dinner. It was very easy to make. While everyone seemed to like it the dip, I felt that it could have been more favorful. I plan to keep this recipe on file. I will, however, continue to look for a better crab dip recipe.

Felicia, how wonderful such a young cook has it all together. It's all about making the flavors meld...you are right on about "krab"...I splurged on a can of "claw" meat for this and it turned out wonderful. If you use the best ingredients, you rarely go wrong. Keep cooking child!

This is exactly the "comfort food" dip my family clamors for. Served it with Ritz crackers at our Family Christmas party and it was a complete hit. The only thing I omitted was the Bay Seasoning due a family member's low salt diet restrictions.
