This is one of the best salads I've ever made. Very little effort and quick to prepare for such sophisticated flavours. Quality ingredients are a must!

Made this for dinner last night subbing in butterleaf lettuce (all I had), used green figs and fig balsamic vinegar. Delicious! I have some dressing leftover and will make this again for my lunch today.

Delish !!! Made a few changes, did not have argula so used romaine lettuce. I also did a reduction of balsamic vingear to drizzle over the salad at the end, the tanginess of the dressing and the sweetness of the reduction with the figs with the proscuitto & cheese was wonderful. Will make this again and again. The key as always is having the best ingredients even if you make subsitiutions.

Perfect Mediterranean salad. To suit personal preference, I use goat cheese instead of Parm. Also, sometimes throw in some slivers of roasted beet.

Everyone I make this for loves it---even the younger kids! I can't wait for figs to come in season to make it.

Can't go wrong with this blend of flavors! Perfect with grilled beef, easy to do and eye appealing. Good dinner party/brunch recipe.

When I made this recipe I cut the prociutto into short strips and tossed all the ingredients together, instead of arranging it. Much easier, and came out more like a chopped salad, not so fussy looking. Still yummy.

I made this last night to go with the Poached Salmon with Tarragon and Fingerling Potatoes.....Everyone raved about it! I finished dinner with the Berry Tart with Mascarpone Cheese! What a great dinner! Easy too!!

To be honest, I really wasn't impressed with this salad. I thought it was just mediocre.

This dish was a hit, and I used all the great suggestions below: substituted fig balsamic vinegar; mixed (baby red) lettuce with the arugula (nice color complement with the figs) and also cooked up the prosciutto. This is a really special salad.

Impressively gorgeous salad with a great mix of flavors. I used only half the arugula (as it had no hard stems to remove) and would recommend reducing the Parmigiano-Reggiano slightly as well. Use super-ripe figs!

Excellent! I used pancetta bits instead of the prosciutto. A delicious combination.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and it was a big hit. Instead of just arugula, I used some mesclun greens and only one bunch of arugula. Also, I used fig balsamic vinegar instead of plain balsamic; it was so good I will use fig balsamic from now on. A very nice, different salad.

I first had this fabulous salad at Rat's restaurant in Hamilton, New Jersey (a much better place than the name gives it a reason to be). The only difference was the figs tasted like they had been lightly glazed in a black curent liquor and port combination. Delicious. I also like to saute the prosciutto until it is crispy. The textural contrast send it into orbit. This may replace the pear, Stilton and walnut salad with sherry vinaigrette as my favorite Thanksgiving/Christmas salad.

This was delicious!! So easy and and so impressive. I made a few changes to it though. I used baby greens and added fresh blueberries! It was amazing. The yin and yang of the flavors was wonderful. I also rolled the prosciutto into cigar type rolls, and served around the perimeter of the salad. So much easier than the way you are supposed to do it in the recipe. Served with rustic bread on a deep blue plate it looked and tasted great!

This has a wonderful flavor. I substituted Fig Balsamic vinegar and liked it much better. I agree with the others: use only top quality Prosciutto and Authentic Parmigiano Reggiano.

This was very, very tasty, and so easy to make. Make sure you use good prosciutto. Adding more figs than the recipe called for might improve an already great dish.

This salad plays like a symphony in your mouth. Though all the ingredients sound rather strong, they balance beautifully. I'm going to feast on this as long as I can and then be strung out when the short fig season is over!! Try it, you'll love it!!

Fantastic salad! I substituted the ubiquitous baby mixed greens for the arugula, and it worked just fine. For this dish, the high quality of the ingredients, the more sublime it is. And it's pretty dang impressive to serve too.

Very easy to make. Be sure to use Parma ham and authentic Parmesan. This is great with grilled meats and a good red wine.
