I grew rainbow chard in my garden - and used this recipe for my first ever taste of the vegitable. Only substitutions - dried cranberries - then sprinkled the pine nuts and a bit of blue cheese on top. wow - awesome!

Made this with rainbow chard from the garden. Fast, simple, delightful. Used toasted sliced almonds instead of pint nuts. This recipe will become a standard in my kitchen.

I used this as a way to add more color to the table for a party. Was great: Light, crisp, fresh tasting. The pine nuts added a nice crunch. All of my guests, some of whom claimed to detest cooked greens, loved it. I par-cooked the chard beforehand and squeeze out some of the water in the collander to keep the leaves from getting mushy in the wilting process. Worked like a charm!

this was yum and an approach that is vegan-friendly. after so many times doing this combo, i tried a different approach with oyster mushrooms and chinese bbq sauce. fooled meat-eating guests into wondering which dish was vegan! http://onehotdish.blogspot.com/2012/04/rainbow-bright-on-rainy-day-seurat-in.html

I toasted the pine nuts dry in the skillet and cut the oil for the onion and chard to about 1 Tbsp, omitted adding 1/2 cup water with leaves, and used regular raisins because I had no golden. It was very good.

This is tasty. I put the leaves and stems in at the same time, and it didn't make a difference, however I did chop the stems pretty small. I also didn't add too much water since the water on the leaves from rinsing made it wet enough.

Really enjoyed this recipe as a way to use up the chard that was taking over my garden. I cut the olive oil in half, but otherwise followed the recipe. Works great as a side for pork.

I've also made this with currents (first soak in a little boiling water), often without pine nuts, if I'm out.

I'd give this 2 1/2 forks. It was good. Cut down on the olive oil as suggested, and added 1/2 teaspoon of honey to cut the bitterness.

This is probably my new favorite way to prepare swiss chard. I tweaked the recipe slightly: toasted the pine nuts in a toaster oven (no need for oil); used 2 tbsp oil instead of 1/4 cup; used a red onion; added ~1/3 cup chicken stock instead of water when adding the raisins; didn't add any extra water when I added the chard leaves (they were already wet from rinsing). This makes a beautiful dish, and it kept reasonably well in a warm oven for nearly an hour before serving (just stir it so that the slightly-dried outer leaves get mixed back in). This recipe is a keeper; I'm looking forward to getting more chard in my CSA box so I can make it again!

I prepared this exactly as directed, except that I threw some beet greens in with the chard. The only thing I would change next time is to add a few more raisins, as their flavor was more subtle than I expected. Served it with Moroccan Chicken with Green Olives and Lemon (recipe on this site), and it was an excellent combo.

Very easy to prepare. I added some Moroccan spice mix. The sweet of the raisins played well off the hot of the spice mix.

To make it healthier, I omitted the oil. I sprayed some Olive Oil Pam to sautee the onions and then added some low sodium chicken broth and raisins. Next, added the chard and cooked for about 5 minutes. I also toasted the pine nuts in the toaster and added those last. The chicken broth made it too watery, but I simply dumped the water out. I also added a little cumin and it was delicious!

A friend told me that she remembers this dish from her southern Italian childhood. Like many reviewers, I've found the wet leaves sufficient, without adding extra water. This recipe made my husband a chard lover! Now we cook chard often, in several different preparations (including braising the stems as you would leeks or celery).

A few suggestions: Toast pine nuts in a dry pan, chop raisins and lump them in Marsala wine, top with 3Tbs (two slices)crumbled apple smoked bacon. I also added one medium minced shallot and a small minced clove of garlic to the onion when cooking. The recipe is absolutely fine without these, but I just had to experiment and it was a pleasant change.

So easy, so good, and so nutritious. Served with brown rice cooked in vegetable stock. Guest who turned up her nose at the menu was begging for more.

I made this from Swiss Chard from the garden. I will definitely make it again. Make sure not to overcook this, I did, and it was a little mushy. Also, I would dry toast the nuts first in a skillet, so they stay crunchy. I think the flavor was good but needed a little something extra, maybe lemon zest.

I love this recipe and have adapted it as follows; 1 1/2 lb Swiss chard, 1/2 cup roasted nuts, finely chopped (2 1/2 oz), 2T olive oil, 1 large onion, finely chopped, 3 cloves garlic, 1/4 cup raisins. Tear chard leaves from stems, then coarsely chop stems and leaves separately. Cook onion and garlic in oil stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Add chard stems and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Add raisins and cook until stems are softened. Add chard leaves, cover pot, and cook until leaves and stems are tender, about 3 minutes. ( Add water if necessary, but I have found that the water clinging to the leaves after washing is sufficient.) Season with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with nuts. Mushrooms are a nice addition to this dish. This is a quicker version that eliminates the problem of too much water and adds to the flavor.

I loved this dish and have made it multiple times, however, it was a little watery. I would cut the added water in half. The greens naturally release water when you cook them, so there is no need to add extra.

Delicious! I'm not usually wild about chard, but I received some from my organic CSA so tried this recipe. Couple of modifications- did not chop raisins (why bother?) and added a splash of cider vinegar with leaves which brightened the flavor. I had mix of green and red chard and it was pretty too.

This recipe is heathy, great tasting, and easy to make. I was surprised, I thought it would be bland but the raisons and onions seem to give it life. And my 72 year old Mother loved it...this is a keeper.

It's delicious. I added a little cornstarch to thickening the sauce at the end before add nuts, and also let the flavor stick to the vege. It worked well.

Delicious. Use Craisins instead of raisins, which added a nice colour. I reduced the oil on the pine nuts though. Otherwise, it would be too oily in my opinion.

Great dish. First time my wife ever liked chard. Used chopped dried dates instead of golden raisins because I had them on hand. Also topped with a little bit of fresh grated parm and some crumbled bacon.

Quick PS to my previous post: I've also made this dish using chopped, oil-cured black olives, in place of the raisins. I actually prefer this dish with the olives, but I wanted my 1st review of the recipe to be of the recipe AS IT IS WRITTEN.

Wonderful, delicious & healthy. I served this over quinoa for a terrific meatless dinner. Even my husband liked it, who went back for seconds!

Really good variation from the "usual" sautee treatment! Nice side dish for any Fall meal. We had it with wild rice and maple smoked pork tenderloin with dijon mustard and cognac. Comfort food. Ahhhhhh.

This dish was a really nice combination -- I used currants instead of raisins and also added in some mushrooms and garlic; drained the water off at the end and skipped the raisin-simmering step completely, just added them in with the onion to sautee. I thought the toasted pine nuts were perfect to add a little crunch. I haven't pan-toasted pine nuts before -- usually just use the oven -- but everything is better fried, right? I'll use the raisins/onion/pine nut combo again.

We really enjoyed this. As suggested I also just used the water that was on the chard after rinsing and it came out great.

This is a great dish, but I would recommend braising (simmering) the chard in water for 5 minutes beforehand, draining it, and *then* sauteeing it with oil and garlic/onions. Then just as you're about ready to serve, toss the toasted pine nuts and the currants in the pan and sautee just enough to heat it through. This recipe is too watery.

Really good recipe, I did not have to add the last half cup of water.

Easy, quick, and tastier than I expected. There are better ways to prepare Swiss chard, but I'll make this again on a busy weeknight.

Ok. But prefer garlic and oil. Don't need as much liquid.

Rating: 3
And - you don't really need to add the water. Just rinse the chard leaves well, shake them off a bit, and toss them into the pan with the water that stays on the leaves and saute with the other ingredients.

This dish is delicious - I've made other versions of it from other cookbooks as well. The swiss chard is great, but spinach works as well. Clifford A Wright has a great version using golden raisins and spinach in "A Mediterrenean Feast" that he describes as a recipe from the ancient Romans. I've served this as a side with fish.

Swiss chard is one of my favorite vegatables because it is good no matter what you do to it. This recipe was ok, when I make it next time I would reduce the water by 1/2 or more.

What a nice way to use this yummy vegetable. Didn't have golden raisins, used currants instead. Very tasty.
