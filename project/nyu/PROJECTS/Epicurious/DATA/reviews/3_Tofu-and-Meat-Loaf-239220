I found it very bland, and the hoisin sauce didn't smell appetizing to me. It was interesting to try, though.

Great Healthy Recipe! Easy, tasty weekday meal. I have to admit I omitted freezing the tofu (due to time constraints) and I sauteed the vegetables to soften them, but it came out really juicy. I didn't miss the rest of the beef at all!
