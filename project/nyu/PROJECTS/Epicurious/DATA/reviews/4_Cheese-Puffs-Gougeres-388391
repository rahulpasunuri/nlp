Followed the reviewers answer about the water and they came out great! Didn´t have the xanthan gum but it didn´t seem to matter they were so tasty. Served them as a hors d´éuvre with champagne and one of the guests is gluten intolerant and everyone loved it!! I will definately make these again, even though noone at the party is gluten intolerant.

"Combine the milk, water..." WATER? How much water? This recipe is DOOMED. Epicurious, please fix this typo.
