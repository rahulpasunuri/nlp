This dish turned out very well. I might switch the white onion for a red onion for color and to round out the flavor since the zucchini is so mild, otherwise, the flavors were nice and bright on a cold winter's night. Served this with green beans boiled, then added good olive oil and salt. This one I'll add to my recipe box.

The only change I made to this recipe was to cut down the salt by 1/2. Both my husband and I agreed that this one is a keeper. I'll be making it again --- when I find halibut on sale.

This was delicious, however... if you have a sensitive stomach, don't go near it! I get really bad stomach aches from broccoli and cucumber, among other things. Apparently raw zucchini has a similar effect. I was curled up in a ball within an hour of eating this.

salsa was amazingly good, my husband had to ask what it was and was shocked to hear it was zucchini. I did add the salt slowly to monitor taste. easy and good, I would try it with chicken too, or tacos

This was a good recipe. I diced the salsa ingredients, but would recommend blending them as the recipe suggests. I would also reduce the amount of salt called for, but overall a healthy and tasty halibut dish.

Pretty good. I just diced my salsa ingredients and then warmed them with the fish.

Needing to use up a zucchini, I stumbled on this recipe and just had to give it a try. Lovely, refreshing, and a great change of pace. We kept the extra salsa to scoop up with tortilla chips the next day. Even my mom, who was wary of both halibut and any kind of green sauce, loved it.

This was delicious. I made it with chicken breasts on the grill pan instead of halibut. I did not skimp on the jalapeño and it was delightfully refreshing on a hot summer evening.

I cut back on the salt and jalapeno by half. The recipe made way too much salsa, but it will serve us well with nachos for dinner tomorrow. Overall a very tasty meal. When halibut is on sale, I would make this again.

Easy to make but lacked pizzazz. Be careful not to add too much salt - mine came out too salty.

So easy and totally yummy! My husband, kids, my kids friends, and I all loved it. Unique and tasty! I am going to try it with chicken next.
