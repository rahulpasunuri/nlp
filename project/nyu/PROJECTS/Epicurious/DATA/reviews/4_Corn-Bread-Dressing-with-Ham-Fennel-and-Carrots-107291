A very good recipe - I would make it again. You definitely don't need to add all of the liquid.

For the past 40 years or so our family has prepared the same turkey stuffing. This year I did an intervention and made this one instead. All the skeptics gathered in the kitchen to share their doubts with me. I perservered. The final result was fantastic and every single person from the grandparents to the grandkids raved about how much they loved the stuffing. The preparation is a little time consuming, but the instructions are straight forward. The only problem I had with the recipie was adding the water to the prepared dressing. I added the full amount and it turned my dressing into instant soup! I shredded up an additional loaf of french bread and took the risk of putting it in the turkey in a super moist state. It worked out perfectly. I can hardly wait until xmas to make this dressing again!
