I used fresh ham. Cooked it for to 160 degrees in a 325 oven - than proceeded with recipe. It was very good - but I'd recommend fresh ham, much juicer.

Very good recipe. I added some onion and portabella mushroom which gave the sauce some depth. Next time I won't add salt to the sauce, the ham was salty enough!

I love ham and I love spinach, so I was ready to love this dish. Both my husband and I found it boring.

This recipe was so simple I wasn't sure it would have much flavor, but it was actually very tasty. I added a little Monterey Jack to the spinach.

A quick, tasty weekday meal, once the spinach is thawed.

I would highly recommend that the ham used is already glazed and seasoned. Just the spinach and ham with no extra preperation could be boring.
