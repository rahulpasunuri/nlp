This was delicious and had "wow" factor. However, the steps involved made it a real chore and I have no desire to repeat it. As we all gobbled the results in about 30 seconds, I decided that the half-day required to make this dessert wasn't worth it! However, I'd definitely make each component again and just serve as cake and ice cream, as another reviewer suggested. One tip if you're going to do the checkerboard--your ice cream really needs to have hardened. I think it's hard to achieve this with the liquor and it's easy to give up on it, because all the steps in this recipe are exhausting and you are just desperate to finish things up. But, if your ice cream isn't hard enough, your cake will just sink right into the ice cream. I think that if you can make the ingredients in the evening and then freeze overnight (as I ultimately did), you can assemble and refreeze in the morning for a dinner that evening. Good luck!

The milk-carton assembly worked fine for me, and the checkerboard did make for an impressive presentation. But for the amount of labor involved, I wasn't blown away by the flavor. The creme de menthe ice cream was a little cloying, and the cake somewhat dry.

My husband loves mint chocolate chip ice cream so when I saw this recipe in Gourmet, I knew I had to make for him. I followed the recipe step by step, although I would probably let the ice cream freeze longer then suggested. The recipe was easy and my husband loved it!! Definitely a recipe to impress guests. . .excellent presentation and delicious!!

The flavor combination was incredible, but the process was a little tedious. A good suggestion might have been to add the creme de menthe towards the end of the freezing process in the ice cream maker; I could not seem to get the ice cream to freeze because of the alcohol content so in a pinch, I had to use store bought.

I didn't find this cake too hard to put together. The milk carton worked well but I have to admit that I had the Gourmet magazine with a picture of how to cut it out so that made it easier. The checkerboard is very impressive. The cake is delicious. I didn't think the ice cream was very minty so next time I may add a bit of mint extract to the custard. It was good but a little fiddly to make.

I thought this was fun to make. The time estimate is pretty accurate. It's actually easier to do than you'd think, but certainly need an offset spatula. Sliced up, it looks neat. The ice cream and cake complement each other quite nicely. If you don't care too much about the presentation/wow factor, you could just serve the ice cream alongside the cake.

the reason this is a 2 forks and not 3 is the assembly method - IT'S RIDICULOUS! i tried this "milk carton" assembly just to try and follow this receipe - well, it's awful - i instead used a square baking pan to assemble the "checkerboard" and it was sooo much easier! the cream de menthe ice cream is excellent and the chocolate cake receipe is just right - just don't assemble the way they say - make up your own - but be sure to line what ever type pan you use with the oil and plastic wrap system - that does work - btw - my husband LOVED the ice cream/cake combo -
