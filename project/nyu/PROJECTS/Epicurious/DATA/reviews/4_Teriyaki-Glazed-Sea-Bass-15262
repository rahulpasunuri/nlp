I used cod instead of sea bass which was a mistake. But the enoki mushrooms were the part of the recipe that turned my husband off - they turned out slimy and rubbery - I would probably use another type of mushroom if I made this again. The sauce was good, I may try this again using a different cooking technique on the fish, perhaps on the grill and baste with the reserved soy sauce mixture. Will keep experimenting with this one.

Nice flavor and very easy. I added grated ginger root to the sauce, and scallions in place of the chives.

This recipie has been a favorite since originally published in Gourmet several years ago. Works well with salmon and other fish. Enjoy!

Superb combination of flavors. I used reconstituted dried shiitakes rather than enoki mushrooms, and loved the earthy flavor they added.

The teriyaki was delicate and perfectly suited to the sea bass, and aside from some minor prep work this was a quick meal. I would pour off all but 1/2 Tbs. of the teriyaki before sauteeing the enoki mushrooms (they were a little soggy, but still flavorful). The chives are essential; I also added some toasted sesame seeds. The Scallion-Ginger Fried Rice was an excellent accompaniment.
