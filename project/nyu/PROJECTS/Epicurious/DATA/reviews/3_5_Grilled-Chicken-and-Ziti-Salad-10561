I was looking for another recipe, but when I saw this I had to add a review. It is one of my old favorites and I am surprised that the ratings haven't been more favorable. We've always loved it, both freshly made and the next day. To the best of my memory, I've always followed the recipe and been delighted with the results.

Very nice pasta salad. I changed the chicken using an old family recipe for lemon chicken instead, but other than that (and cutting the oil and upping the mustard) didn't change anything. Very nice and different from the standard pasta salad fare.

Pretty good...I doubled the chicken too and doubled the dressing (did not double the oil though). Added lettuce and it was a nice light dinner.

I thought this dish was good, especially if you like dill with mustard, but I prefer more of a mayo/sour cream/pepper base with dill. As previous reviews suggested, I doubled the dressing recipe, but now I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't have! Perhaps it's because I don't like the combo of mustard and dill, but I thought the mustard flavor of the dressing was a little overpowering -- I couldn't even taste the chicken. Consequently, if I made this again, I would double the chicken, as other reviewers mentioned.

Made this without the chicken as a sidde dish for a bbq. Otherwise, made it as is (but doubled dressing). I don't like olives, and still loved the flavor of this salad. The dill and dressing are a nice, fresh combination. Will definitely make again.

This is a family favorite; everyone loves it. I add only an additional pound of chicken breasts marinating them in olive oil and lots of freshly ground black pepper for a couple of hours before. It is delicious and great for a hot summer night.

This is one of our favorite summer recipes. Makes a good tailgating recipe. Very good left over when the dill flavor comes out more.

We've been making this recipe since 1990 and we love it. I, of couse tweek it for our family. I make more dressing and grill the chicken. Because my family prefers dark meat I use chicken thighs. We don't like dill so I use a combination of other herbs.

I hate to be the naysayer, but after all the great reviews, I was really disappointed in this recipe. It was okay, but nothing that I'd care to make again - there are plenty of other pasta salads that are much better. There wa sjust nothing special in this recipe that stood out.

I loved the flavor of this dish! I found that it needed more of the dressing (easy enough). It had mixed reviews with the kids, some weren't impressed, and others loved it. The calamata olives added quite a zip! I'm going to make it for the holidays as a side dish, omitting the chicken.

This is a colorful dish that makes for a dazzling presentation. I always increase the amount of chicken.

I made this for a shower, the girls loved it! I used only about 2/3 of the pasta called for in the recipe. It was very no-hassle and made for easy entertaining.

very nice-but double the dressing. Definitly a good picnic/backyard party salad!

Very good.Everyone loved it at my 4th of July picnic. However,when making ahead I would only put 1/2 of the dressing on, the rest when I serve it.Allos, I didn't have enough celery so I added fresh cauliflower. Great!

This is fabulous! I used 6 chicken breasts (an increase) and less pasta. I used a multi-colored, slightly tubular pasta which added even more color. I also used red, green and yellow peppers. It is better the 2nd day after flavors mix together.

I made this for a picnic and it was a hit! I added less onion (about 1 cup), but it was still a bit strong. Next time I'll try about 3/4 cp.

This has been a standard for us since first published. Great for tailgating. Important to use fresh dill. May want to cut back slightly on the olive oil. Enough that you'll always have leftovers.

Very disappointing after reading all these reviews, this was incredibly average. Note that those who love this have all changed the recipe. I agree with the other reviewer - the dressing lacked something. Too much mustard, maybe. Also - this made a ton. And it needs more chicken.

This recipe was excellent! I also made a few adjustments: vegetable instead of olive oil, omitted the dill, and added feta cheese. I meant to add Roma tomatoes but forgot; I'll add them next time (there will be many next times!) Also, next time I'll use less celery. I got a lot of compliments on this recipe!

Yum-yum! This is definately a keeper! I used leftover grilled chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It is worth all the chopping!

This was very, very tasty, which is lucky because it made many delicious meals for the 2 of us. I didn't use celery, used green instead of red pepper, videlia instead of red onion, and added tomatoes.

I make this every time I have company. It's awesome!! Everyone loves it.

I read the comments and also made some changes. I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise. I also grilled the chicken with some of the vegetables for extra flavor. Mixed the salad as directed, then added chunky squares of mozzerella, next time maybe feta. This added a little more dimension to the receipe. Also, one of my friends said they heated up the salad and with the cheese, it was yummy. Definately a good salad.

I am sorry to say that I was disappointed with this recipe (especially after reading the other reviews!). The salad ingredients were good, but the dressing lacked something. Maybe it was the chicken/dill combo? I'll try a different recipe next time.

Wonderful recipe! Instead of grilling the chicken, I fry it in a mixture of butter & olive oil in a skillet on top of the stove. Make sure you do NOT overcook the chicken. Also, use only fresh dill. This one's definitely a "keeper"!

I have been wanting to make this recipe for quite some time after reading the posted reviews. I finally made it last night. It was tremendous although I, personally, would cut down on the red onions. Leftovers tasted even better. Definitely a recipe to keep.

I've made this recipe several times and have always received requests for the recipe. I do use mesquite grilled chicken breasts and make sure that all of the ingredients are fresh. Wonderful!

I was out of mayo and olives so I omitted both. It was still delicious. If you'ld like to make this more light, give this a try

I made this as a straight pasta salad without the chicken, adding 1 Tbl. of lemon juice to make up for the missing chicken juices. All the vegetables make it nice and crunchy. I only had dried dillweed on hand so I used half as much as the recipe called for; I'd use more next time or plan ahead and buy fresh dill. The only other change I'd make is to use a large red onion, but I LOVE onions, cooked or raw! I didn't find the dressing oily; I made it in my blender, trickling the olive oil in, and the dressing stayed emulsified. I'd definitely make this again. Leftovers are great to bring to work for lunch.

Good recipe. I liked it hot rather than cold. It was a bit oily the next days. I would cut the dressing recipe in half, and increase the number of olives. I would make again with those changes. It makes a ton of food. Good for a time you are on a strict budget and want something hardy.

Took this to a roof top barbecue and received many unsolicited compliments.

This is a great summer salad! I found that it could be cut in half using left over grilled chicken breasts and it still made enough with some garlic french bread to serve four. Use the best olives you can find.

This is the best pasta salad I have ever come across. It makes a large quantity. A couple of things must be Strictly followed....Always make the dressing as per recipe(no substitutions). Be generous with the lemon juice. use the special olives It has readily become a family favorite and is one of those recipies requested for special occassions.
