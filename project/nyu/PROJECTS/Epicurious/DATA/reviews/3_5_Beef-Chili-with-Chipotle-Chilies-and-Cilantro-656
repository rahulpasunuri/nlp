I loved the idea of using cumin and chipotle chilies in adobo sauce for a nice smokey taste. However, I couldn't imagine eating this without tomatoes. I substituted one of the cups of onions for a large yellow pepper. I probably should just add the pepper and not eliminate the onion. I used minced garlic rather than garlic powder. I added a 15oz can of tomatoe sauce and a 32oz of diced tomatoes. WIth all this extra juice, I didn't add 2.5 cups of water, I just rinsed out the can with water and then poured it into the mix. I also love chili with beans so I added a can of red kidney beans. I added 4 tomatillos. And finally, I always add celery to any dish. I added just one stalk. I LOVED the added taste of the adobo sauce and cumin!! But I felt like I needed the extras I put in.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't awesome. I deviated from the recipe quite a bit, based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I used bison instead of beef, a jar of green chilies instead of the chipotles, two cloves of garlic instead of the powder, and beef stock instead of water. I added 2 cans of red kidney beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and a can of crushed tomatoes. I also added a pack of spaghetti near the end, as my husband likes it that way. After tasting it, it was still a little bland. I added some lime juice, based on previous reviews, and that helped. I then added a bit of cocoa, and that helped a lot. A little salt at the end also greatly improved the flavor. It wasn't until I'd added sour cream and cheese to my own little bowl that I was actually satisfied with the chili. They really did "make" the dish. So make sure you don't skip the sour cream and cheese!

Way too much cumin in this recipe for my taste. I didn't read the reviews before hand, but great minds think alike. I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes (half can chunked, half can pureed, one whole can drained and pureed), quadrupled the chipotle, more garlic powder, pinch of smoked paprika, and tsp of salt. Served about 1 Cup mixed with two boxes of mac and cheese...edible. Not pleased at all with this recipe.

Followed the reviews - added a can of crushed tomatoes and substituted 1 1/2 cups broth for water. Used 500g of ground beef, and added a can of black beans - left out the cilantro. Only had 45 minutes until dinner and it worked out fine. Delicious - kids loved it. Sharp cheddar and chives to top.

So the chili I ended up making barely resembled this recipe, which seems to be missing some key components...like tomatoes...and beans. I took the suggestion and used 1 1/2 cups beef broth in place of the water. I substituted pureed canned tomatoes for the other cup of water. I sauteed a fresh poblano in with the onions and added an extra tablespoon of the chipotles. I used about a pound and a third of lean chopped meat (90%) and it was a good amount of fat considering it doesn't get drained. For the rest of the "protein" I added a can of black beans and a can of red kidneys. I skipped the cheese and sour cream for diced avocado and Greek yogurt instead. It was a perfect chili (by my tastes) and easy on the health conscience!

Made this tonight and thought it was excellent, though I made the modifications that so many others suggested (beef broth, can of diced tomatoes, can of black beans), plus added a half can of crushed tomatoes. Also added jalapeno peppers and almost the whole can of the chipotle peppers with the adobo--I like HEAT. What I like about this is that you really CAN adjust it, easily, to personal taste. Will definitely make again.

I love when people change/add to the recipe.I read almost all the reviews and then combine the changes to suit my tastes.Thats why we have this section guys!....Yes, beans......yes, garlic chili paste...diced tomatoes and beef broth.

this is a great recipe for the whole family to enjoy. We added 4tbsp of key lime juice to cut the heat for our younger 'foodies' and found that it added a nice 'zing' to the palate.

Followed recipe exactly. Served chopped fresh tomatoes as an accompaniment along with cheese cilantro, sour cream, and onion. Super easy and good.

A few changes to the basic recipe which really worked: ground bison instead of beef (lower fat), 1-16 oz diced tom, 1-16 oz black beans, beef stock instead of water, 2 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder. great simple chili recipe and will make it again.

Really Good!! Incredibly tasty.

I, too, added a small can of drained green chilies, diced tomatoes and one can of black beans. Instead of water, I used 2 C of beef stock and a 16-ounce dark ale beer. Instead of ground beef, I used beef roast. The chili was really, really good. I'm giving it 4 stars because I altered the base recipe so much.

I like a hotter chili too, so I upped the chipotles and used Mexican hot chili powder. I also added some chopped tomatoes. It is hot and just the thing for a cold winter night (it's minus 20 celcius in Moscow, so we need it!). A good basic recipe to build upon.

I've made this a couple of times but use lean ground turkey and just plain old canned diced chilies, a small can of diced tomatoes and it's INCREDIBLE!! It's healthy and the turkey works so well with the cumin and fresh cilantro. I serve it with the listed sides and diced avocado. Got rave reviews from my guests and can't get enough of it! Wow, wow, wow!!

This chili didn't come out as spicy as I would have hoped, and the adobo flavoring was a bit overkill. If I try this again, I'm going to use more chipotle peppers, but rinse off the adobo sauce. And I'll probably add other fresh chilis from the market to give it more of a kick. This is definitely a great basic recipe to adapt to your own tastes.

As I too like spicy chili, I added a few things others mentioned (more chipotle, more adobo, plus diced chipotles,) Adobo spices with bitter orange, lime, vinegar, red wine, tomato paste and bitter chocolate. Very tasty!

Rating: 3
I really liked this. It was easy, quick and good. I like the smokiness of the chipotles. I did add more chilies plus more adobe sauce. I too added diced tomatoes, beans and fresh garlic. It is definitely worth making again and freezing in small quantities to have on hand. Try it; you will probably like it.

i thought this was pretty good but not special. i added more chipotles because i like spicy chili. honestly, it didn't taste much different than the chili kit you can buy from the supermarket.

I used 1 lb. of beef and one can of beans and it was perfect that way. I also used fresh garlic and not garlic powder.

This was great for someone who is looking for a low carb dish! Very meaty and delicious. I added a can of diced tomatoes. Next time I will add more heat! I also think the soup needed some type of vinegar to balance it out.

Rating: 4
I thought this was delicious and I'll be making it again. I used two whole chipotle chilies (chopped up) and also added black beans. It was hot, but the sour cream and cheddar cheese cooled it down some. Next time I'll cut back a bit on the chili powder. I served it with Mexican cornbread - yummy!

Rating: 4
This recipe was amazing even though I made a blatant mistake by using the entire can of chipotle chilis in adobe sauce....it was beyond spicy but once it was cut with the cilantro and sour cream....amazing. Next time I will follow the recipe much closer by using only 1 TBSP of the chilis. It was amazing with sweet Mexican corn bread. Highly recommended for anyone who does not like beans in the chili.

Rating: 3
Like other mentioned this is a great starting point. Added diced tomatos, replaced water with beef broth, fresh garlic, 2 jalapenos, splash of vinager, and a can of kidney beans. Also doubled the chipotle peppers, wanted a little more heat. Very good the next day.

Rating: 4
This is a great classic chili base. You can prepare it as listed, which is delicious and fail-proof. You can also add serrano chiles for extra heat or canned chili beans, if you prefer beans in your chili. The buttery corn bread recipe is a must have along side this dish!

This was a great non-bean recipe. Added canned tomatoes as well as some beer for flavoring. Great dish to serve with cornbread!

I've made this recipe several times now and love it. I've made a couple of adaptations that I think improve the recipe, though. I use chunked sirloin, fresh garlic, and I add a can of drained tomatoes. It's always a hit. I especially like the fact that this chili has no beans.

This was super easy to make. I used a toasted poblano pepper in place of cumin and cilantro and chopped fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder. Also, I used 3/4 cup salsa and 3/4cup water, in lieu of all water. This was a big hit at a Texas party where the chili is either "all meat-no beans" or "all beans-no meat". The chipotle sauce added color and a smoked smell to it. It actually tasted better the next day.

I nixed the water and used diced tomatoes, beer, and beef broth instead. I also dropped the garlic powder, and subbed fresh garlic which I sauteed with onions, beef & green pepper. I added red beans, too.

Very good - but on the advice of other readers, I substituted 8 ripes tomatoes for the water, added red beans and dropped the garlic powder (the other seasonings overpowered it anyway in my opinion)

I agree with "A Cook from Poconos, PA on 10/05/02" in that this very good, basic recipe is something great to build upon. That said, I hope that Epi review purists will pardon me in advance for not rating the original recipe "as written". I used about 3 C Pomi chopped tomatoes & their juice in place of the water + I added a cup of red beans & since I LOVE chipotles, I put a bit extra in. Served this with grated cheddar cheese & chopped scallions. Divine. This really didn't require 1 1/2 hours of cooking time - it was ready to eat in about 40 mins. Next time, I'll try adding some lime juice, as others here have recommended. Sounds like a great idea! I'll definitely make this again & will enjoy experimenting with it.

This was a very good basic chili, enjoyed by the whole family for an easy weeknight dinner. I started it after work, and cut down on the cooking time, which turned out fine. I served it with Spicy Tortilla Chips, from Epicurious, which also were great, and easy to prepare. I like the suggestion of adding lime juice; will try that next time.

I used this recipe as a starting point but did not follow it fully. Normally I wouldn't post a review, but it came out really good so I want to share. I added two small mild habanero peppers a friend of mine grew, chopped fine. (Be careful with these!) I added a can of black beans in cumin sauce, some lime juice, some fresh garlic with the onions, a small can of tomato paste, some red wine, and a can of low sodium/low fat beef stock. Instead of the can of chipotle chilies I used a mix of chipotle chili powder and regular chili powder to make up the amount required in the recipe. After everything was simmering nicely I added enough minute rice to thicken it up, then a little salt. The results were awesome, but a bit spicy. I'd probably stop at one pepper next time. Some freshly chopped onion and shredded mexican cheese mixed in at serving made this a dish that I will make again.

This was okay, but nothing special. I'm sure there are better ways to make chili with chipotle, actually there was another recipe from epicurious with chipotle and lime crema which was much better.

I love this recipe. I made a vegan version with Boca crumbles, a can of kidney beans (drained), vegetable broth instead of water, a can of diced tomatoes and a little extra chipotle. I can't wait to make it again.

Not impressed....I thought it was a very bland chili. Had to incorporate other herbs just to make it edible. (oregano, coriander, majoram, cloves and mustard powder).

Great chili! I added "hot" chili powder and 4 chipolte chilis, will cut this down the next time to get more of the cilantro taste. I also added what the cook from St. Paul suggested and it did add alot of depth and will try this one at our local chili cookoff.

This is a P.S. to my very last review, changing it from a 3 forker to a 4 forker! Since this was a Latin dish, we were drinking beer with lime juice as usual, and decided to add lime juice into our chili! I added the juice of 2 limes and what a masterpiece it became, (along with the addition of the can of tomato paste and can of black beans with juice). It looks and tastes teriffic!

Delicious! I also add a can of diced tomatoes to this recipe and cut back on the water a little. Sometimes I add a can of drained beans as well. This is also delicious when made with ground turkey instead of beef.

This was a great basic chili recipe. I juiced it up a bit based on other reviewer's comments. I added some chopped tomatoes, a can of chili beans, extra chipotle, a quarter teaspoon of cayenne and, surprisingly, about 2T of white wine vinegar to round out the flavors. It was fabulous! My husband loves it..says it's the best chili he's ever had.

I really liked this one, but only after adding a 6 ounce can of tomato paste. Without the tomato paste, it was relatively bland. I love the chipotle chilies -- it adds a slight fire but isn't overly hot.

This chili has flavour with the chipotle chilies and cilantro. Since I am the only one who likes chili in my family, I may make it hotter next time.
