This was very nice and easy. I did add onions, because I can't imagine curry without them, and carrots, since I wasn't cooking any veggies on the side. Other than that I followed the recipe as written (except that I used skinless chicken tenders since they were on sale at my local grocery) and was generous with my good quality curry powder. I cooked 1.5 pounds of chicken for 3 people and there is barely enough left for me to take to work for lunch tomorrow. I liked adding the chutney to the sauce so that we got a taste of my favorite part of curry in every bite. Apples and other fruit, as suggested, would be very nice too. I can see this becoming a go-recipe.

Bland? No way! This was terrific and very easy to prepare. I would recommend doubling the sauce. I was cooking for two so used only two chicken breasts but kept all the sauce ingredients as in the recipe. The sauce is so good, you're going to want more and I served this over basmati rice. The sauce was very nice with the rice. If you feel the need to make it hot, add to the spices or use a hot chutney. But for us, this recipe was wonderful.

Very nice and quick curry. Use good powder, it makes a world of difference. And serve with coconut rice. Yummy and quick weeknight meal.

This recipe, while simple, was really bland and boring.

I'd make it again because it is so easy, but I think I needed better curry powder, as suggested by the writer below. This was nothing special.

This is our standard curry recipe, it's great followed just as written. Reviewers who found it bland are probably using curry powder from the supermarket. If you don't make your own, order some from Penzey's, the spice website, which has an array of curries to choose from. It makes all the difference!

Make this recipe with a few changes: I boiled the chicken breasts without skin, cut into small pieces; used canola oil instead of butter; added an onion; in place of curry powder, used curry paste (available in most Indian grocery stores); eliminated the brandy; used Wondra instead of flour; used yogurt instead of cream. For condiments, I used: mandarin orange sections, raisins, peanuts, toasted and shredded coconut, fried and raw onions, pineapple chunks, cantaloupe chunks, diced bananas, diced fresh tomatoes. Served over basmati rice with Major Grey's Mango Chutney. Pile everything on top and eat with large spoon. Delicious!

I thought the sauce was a little bland and too sweet. I whisked in about 1/2 tsp red curry paste which really helped cut the sweetest and give it more punch. The condiments (chopped bananas, raisins, etc) should be listed in the ingredient section rather than simply in the preface. They're essential to making the dish tasty. Without any condiments, I agree with cook in SF below that the dish is a little bland. Extra points for being simple and quick, however.

Everyone seemed to really enjoy this recipe, except me. I made it twice just to be sure, and both times I found it too bland. I recommend you give it a try, since so many liked it. But, I didn't think it was special.

I thought this was a great recipe, especially considering how quick it is to prepare. I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, and I added one chopped onion and a tablespoon of crushed garlic to the chicken while it was cooking. I took the previously posted advice and replaced the cream with 1/4 cup coconut milk and 1/4 cup chopped Pomi tomatoes. Remember to add the coconut milk at the very end, because the coconut milk will separate if it is boiled. I also added some steamed carrots into the curry. My husband likes something sweet in his curry so I added some raisins and chopped granny smith apples in at the end. I served the curry with mango pickle and lime chutney, which I found at the local Indian market and Major Grey's mango chutney (which I deliberately omitted from the recipe).

This was quick, easy and wonderful! Didn't have coconut milk- so used dried coconut soaked in plain milk for about an hour. Worked great. Definately a do-again.

Very Good recipe just as is. Can be made in the time it takes to cook the rice. Would definitely make it again

Very good and quick dinner. I also used coconut milk in place of the cream. Having the condiments on the side to add was not only delicious, but fun. Especially for the kids. We had banana, peanuts, raisins, and coconut. Will do again for sure.

I tried this recipe and I was in a hurry because of a ravenous husband standing on one foot and then the other. It was easy and so good. I had to substitute coconut milk for the cream and sherry for the brandy, but it was delicious. I also used some masala that I brought from India, so it was very spicy. I used the remainder of the can of coconut milk to add to the rice. I served it with 7 condiments (boys) and made a really great 7-boy curry.

Even the young fussy eaters would eat it again. Very easy and quick.

We followed the recipe except that we substituted plain low-fat yogurt for the cream and mistakenly put in more curry powder than recommended; it still came out great. I added a little extra yogurt and broth to thin out the finished sauce. Future (easy) modification, since I cooked it in a non-stick skillet, would be to eliminate or severely reduce the specified amount of butter. After reading the ingredients on the Major Grey's mango chutney, I would also be willing to experiment with sugar and/or frozen mangoes in lieu of the Major Grey's, but can see how using the pre-made chutney is a lot quicker when "in a hurry." All in all, I would also consider steaming some potatoes or other veggies (small quantity) to add in toward the end to supplement the chicken.

easy and great when you're out of ideas.Used some mix of coconut milk and yogurt.

This is a great weeknight dinner. The recipe is simple but the flavor is suprisingly complex. I substitute an equal amount of plain yogurt for the cream. Less fattening, and maybe more authentic. Just be careful not to let it boil.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts because they don't get dried out. I made my own curry powder - first roasting the spices then grinding them in a coffee grinder - because most store bought curry powders are bland and I think this dish needs a tad more heat for my taste but for a quick curry this is quite decent.

Easy, quick and very good. What more can you ask for ? I diced the chicken and used cognac instead of brandy. With the curry I served pineapple rice (pineapplejuice instead of water) with chopped almonds. I also put some almonds and bananas in the curry. The second time I made it I omitted the mango.

This was GREAT! and in a hurry. I cut the chicken up in pieces and coated it with flour before sauteing. I stirred in cut up mango after it was cooked and it was yummy. I used half and half - and it was plenty rich - with a peanuty smoothness.

Excellent, easy dish. I doubled the sauce and added green peppers and onion. They add some extra flavor. I served with basmati rice and a salad. Turned out great. With curry, the longer it cooks the more flavorful.

I loved this dish! It was fast, easy, & delicious. I cubed the chicken before I sauteed it and that worked well too.

a VERY SIMPLE recipe which tastes like you slaved over it. The Curry is well balanced and, to my taste, needs no alteration.I used skinless chicken as opposed to the recipes choice of chicken with skin. I had no Brandy so I used Sherry.Adding a little extra chicken broth thinned the sauce a little (not too much) and made it go a little further. I served ordinary converted rice but substituted Pineapple juice for the water and added some raisins (after the rice was cooked) which I heated in a little water before hand. For desert I served the "Flourless Chocolate Cake" (without the Coconut Lime Sorbet, but with fresh whipped cream). Try these. You won't be disappointed!!

Great recipe! It's amazing how good it turned out, considering it has no onions or garlic, but retained that Indian flavor. I would definatly make it again, especially when I am short of time.

Enjoyed. I did make some substitutions. In place of whipping cream, I used n/f yogurt, Cognac instead of Brandy & no flour or salt. I did add a dash of garam marsala. I also used the pressure cooker. Very tasty w/just enought sweet & spice.

I teach a basic cooking group and had people prepare this recipe. It was delicious and very easy.
