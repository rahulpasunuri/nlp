I just got through making this. Very easy and economical. It's going to be one of my weekday recipes now. I had everything in the pantry except the chilies. I added oregano and paprika for more depth. I would've added lime if I had some in the fridge. It also needed to add a bit of olive oil to round it out a bit. Good recipe but needs a bit more time than 15 minutes to get the beans creamy and tender. This is enough to feed my family two dinners with sides (two adults, one kid, one toddler).

This was a good (easy) weeknight or large group meal. I added only 2 cans of pinto beans and increased the GB to 1.5#. With less beans it did not get as "creamy" as the recipe suggested, but I just increased the heat and spent more time "smashing" the beans. The dish is not at all spicy, but pleasant and nice. I added a little bit of salt (1/4tsp) and pepper (1/2tsp) and did not use salsa, however the green onions, cilantro and monterey jack (not cheddar) were a must. On reviewer equated this to Taco Bell and I laughed, wondering when their epicurious membership would be revoked, but they were right. My more than grown up husband is a huge TBell fan and we both felt that this was probably what TBell was aiming for on their recipe. Overall, it easily served 3 adults, 3 "taco-style" burritos each and no side dishes. You could double this for a weekend game day recipe and it would be very nice.

I realize I've made this about a dozen times; probably time to review it. I've used beef, ground turkey, and bison, either pinto or black or mixed, and always double the green chiles. It makes enough to freeze another meal for my hungry family of 4. Works as a nacho topping. Also easy to make camping or take along in the cooler. An easy hit. Yum.

An easy way to used ground beef and a good way to ensure that my husband and kids get their legumes in their burritos. Nothing super special, but tasty enough. I froze half of the recipe for a rainy day.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! REMINDS ME OF TACO BELL'S CHILI CHEESE BURITTO!! I added a can of refried, jalapeno beans and loaded it with cheese in the end---YUMMY!!! Will make again!!!

I used venison because I have alot on hand. This recipe was simple to prepare. I let the meat and beans (1can black and 1can pinto) cook longer so it really thickened. This recipe leaves the door wide open for adaptation to your taste. And ladies this would be a great throw together the day before and have the babysitter heat up in the oven while you are out.

This is a very simple recipe to prepare. I let the meat and beans cook a little longer to thinken more. I use a potatoe masher to mash the 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pintos that I used. Didn't mash all of them just did about 4 mashes around the pan. This recipe leaves the door wide open for adaptation to your taste. It isn't going to win any awards on it's own. And ladies this would be great to throw together the day before and have the babysitter throw in the oven and heat up while your out.

I wish I could give zero forks for the rating since I would never make this dish again. Even with the suggested enhancements (lime juice, ancho chili powder, fewer beans) this recipe truly was a waste of my ingredients. Keep searching, I'm sure you'll find a better recipe.

Rating: 3
Very easy to make. Used extra lean beef, so I added a little bit of oil to cook the beef. Since there were only two of us, so I halfed the recipe, using one can of 19oz bean. As I used low sodium beef broth, I had to season it with some salt. It was great as a component of my burrito, which I also put in some red rice (from another epicurious recipe), guacamole, salsa and cheese! Much better than those fast food chain ones. Definitely make it again!

I had a ton of ground beef and beans laying around so this recipe called my name merely to use up my excess in the pantry. I didn't have any broth, and instead substituted water. I used one of the empty bean cans full of water and added 3-4 T of cornstarch to thicken the mixture. I also added salt and pepper and crushed red pepper. Also didn't have green chilies but found some red peppers in adobo laying about and used one from the can. This recipe works well if you use the base of beans and beef with the onion and garlic and elaborate from there. It's tasty and slightly spicy the way I made it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it if the items hadn't been on hand.

Excellent for a quick family meal!

Rating: 3
I make this recipe all the time and is my staple for burritos. I have never used the full amount of beans (seems a bit much) one can usually works for me. I don't add green chilies but I use chipotles in adobo sauce instead. I have used with chicken stock instead of beef and find that it is fine. We make fresh guacamole with it and serve with sour cream, cheddar cheese and salsa. Great for a weeknight meal.

I agree, kind of blah. Certainly better than regular taco filling, and much more healthy, but nothing I can't live without.

Split decision at our house...I thought they were fine, not extraordinary; my husband LOVED them. For our purposes they are a good thing to keep in the freezer for weeknights--relatively healthy and nice to have on hand, I guess.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did half it since their is just the two of us. I also used refried beans instead of whole. One other change was I wrapped the filling in a flour tortilla, then fried like a chimichanga. I then topped with chili con queso, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Delicious! Will definetely make again. The recipe cut in half filled 9 small flour tortillas.

This was wonderful. I used turkey instead of beef, chicken stock instead of beef, added 1 Tbsp. Ancho Chili powder and the juice from 1 lime, based on others comments and what was in my pantry. This is a favorite.

Rating: 3
These were delicious!! However, instead of the beans mentioned here, I used refried beans (2 14 ounce cans). It was awesome, yummy! The green chilies you can find in the same section as the refried beans. Wherever all the taco kits are. Also, we wrapped this up in tortillas, baked them for 20 to 30 mins at 400F. We also had grated cheese over the top. And, we had two each and were stuffed! So we froze them and had them another night, and they were just as good!

These were very good. Sure makes a big batch. I froze half for next time.. I hear you Knoxville. My son makes an annual trip to Hatch NM.. brings home a couple hundred pounds of green chile. MMMmmmmm

Best burritos I've ever made!!! I used ground turkey and added lemon juice, hot paprika for color, and a touch of salsa and used whole wheat low carb tortillas. Next time I would add more spices since it was very mild. Also spread yogurt on the tortilla so it wouldn't crack and since I didn't have fresh cilantro used watercress. Very delicate mix of flavors!!

Rating: 3
Uh, this is lacking a pretty essential ingredient, in my opinion. After browning the beef, I stir in 1t ground red chile. Note that that is NOT chili powder, which is mixed with cilantro and cumin and made with wimpy chiles. It's kind of hard to find east of Mississippi, tho. You could maybe used 2t or more to taste of wimpy chili powder. Or grind up dried chiles.

We think that this is fantastic, can be made before hand and microwaved later when you are doing the tortillas.

My kids loved this! I used two pounds of beef instead of one, and kept all other ingredients the same. I followed advice of others and assembled the burritos, covered them with shredded mexican blend cheese, then covered dish with foil and baked for 20 minutes. Serve with sour cream and salsa.

I'm going to find all my recipes on Epicurious from now on. This is the 4th one I've tried and the 4th one that was easy and delicious! I wrapped the burritos myself and baked with cheese on top and served with chopped tomatoes and lettuce.

Rating: 3
Very easy and the filling is great. I made this for my son's birthday party and because it wasn't practical to have 8 kids folding their own burritos at the table I filled the tortillas beforehand and sprinkled generously with the cheese. I then baked them for about 20 to 30 min and served with the salsa. The tortillas were a little too dried out so next time I'd cover them with aluminum foil whole baking.

This dish is so simple to make, 10 min. to the table. Quick and easy. I used refried beans to add flavor and didn't add the spices and it was great. A good recipie for those who work 8-5 and need supper at 6

Wonderful, easy to prepare. Made this with chicken, added salt & pepper, and some chili powder. Asked my husband if he would like me to make it with beef next time he said "no way". I cut the recipe in half and we had great leftovers. A keeper!

Yummy yummy for our tummies!!! I made this last night for dinner and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. Instead of beef I used ground turkey and I added some black pepper to it while it was cooking. I also used black beans with jalapenos in it to add spice. I made the texican rice, as someone suggested, as a side but my husband didn't care for it as a side dish but I also put it in the burrito and he enjoyed it. Served with avocado and cholula and we loved it. I took the left over meat and beans with cheese and made a taco salad that I'm enjoying for lunch right now.

Very flavorfull dish. Made this one day ahead of time and reheated in oven. Worked out great.

Rating: 3
Used 2 cans spicy fat free refried beans...next time I'd use only one. Used half the beef broth--may even need less with only one can beans. The spicy beans helped season the dish---without them it needs some help from oregano, chili powder, cilantro, etc. This is a basis to elaborate on! P.S. Try this with the Texican Rice from this site. We piled the rice on with the beans and meat with sour cream, guacamole, olives, salsa, cheese (we like our condiments) as accompaniments!

I made a few substitutions to please my picky kids: used refried beans to make them undetectable; subbed canned tomatoes and chilis for the canned chilis; reduced the quantity of beef broth by half. I also used leftover chipotle-grilled beef. The entire family loved it, including my picky 5 year old whose favorite meal is a hot dog from Home Depot.

Perfect Sunday night family supper. Quick and easy.

We really liked this recipe. adding the salsa and cilantro at the table lets everyone, especially kids, make these the way they want. I only added one can of black beans and would probably mash them before adding to the meat mixture next time. If you think mexican has to be hot then you will want to add more spices but i thought it had a very good taste as is.

This turned out quite well, indeed. I took the suggestions of previous posts and modified the recipe a bit. I used refried beans instead of the pinto beans, and added about 30 ounces worth (2 cans instead of 3). I used 6 cloves of garlic, and a stronger beef broth than canned: I use something called Better Than Broth, and the flavor is richer and fuller than canned. I believe it made a difference here. I also included a 4-ounce can of diced jalapenos instead of the diced green chilies. Finally, I threw in a handful of chopped cilantro when I added the cumin. All in all, an excellent, full, somewhat spicy flavor, which my entire family enjoyed.

This is not the prettiest looking dish but it tastes great. I only used 2 cans of romano beans and added a whole lot of garlic and cilantro and some extra spices to give it a kick. It was good even without the tortilla.

quick,easy and good. Who wants more on a busy friday night. I used 6 cloves of garlic, and only one tin of organic refried black beans other then that I followed the recipe. I wrapped the burritos myself put them on a cookie sheet spayed them with oil and baked at 400 for 15 mins. They were a chimichaga (minus the fat). Served with homemade salsa, and sour cream. Next time will put cilantro in meat. Do try P.S few weeks later - adding about 1/2-3/4 cup cilento to the cooking meat mixture makes it taste even better 12/26/01 -

I agree with the others that this needs something extra-- cilantro or mexican oregano. However, it is an incredibly easy recipe and is quick. A great starting point, then make it your own!!

These burritos were excellent. I used only two cans of pinto beans instead of three, and the proportion of beef to bean was perfect. The leftovers were just as good 2 days later. However, crushing the pintos with the back of a spoon proved tedious and time-consuming - I switched to a potato masher; I will try using refried beans next time.

These were great! We enjoyed them the first night and then made the leftover bean mix into burritos the next night, put them in a baking dish and added a can of enchilada sauce and cheese and baked them for 30 min. at 350. My husband liked them even better this way!

Good for a quick and easy meal but needs some additional spice kick. Added some red pepper flakes before reheating the leftovers.

This dish was fine, but nothing special. It was easy to do, which is a definite plus. I found that it lacked something and ended up having to add salt & pepper to get more flavor. Having salsa in the burritos was essential, or they would probably be pretty bland. If I made it again, I would add something to make it spicier / tastier (fresh cilantro, etc.).

GREAT RECIPE!!!! I DID MAKE A FEW CHANGES. I USED TWO MORE GARLIC CLOVES, AS MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE GARLIC. I REDUCED THE CUMIN BY ONE TABLESPOON AND ONLY USED TWO CANS OF BEANS INSTEAD OF THREE. I ALSO DIDN'T MASH UP THE BEANS, THE MIXTURE WAS THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY AND MADE IT A LITTLE MORE MEATIER TEXTURE. I PUT THE FILLING INTO FLOUR TORTILLAS AND ROLLED THEM UP AND DEEP FRIED THEM TURNING THEM INTO CHIMICHUNGAS. I SERVED GUACAMOLE, SOUR CREAM, LETTUCE, SALSA, CHEESE, ETC., ON THE SIDE. HUSBAND AND MYSELF LOVED THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MADE A HUGE BATCH AND FROZE THE MEAT MIXTURE INTO ONE MEAL PACKAGES FOR TWO. TRY THIS RECIPE.

actually made one batch with ground turkey and the other batch with pseudo-meat beef-like tofu. i am told it came out well. spicy is good, so i actually tossed in about 7 oz chopped jalapenos in lieu of the diced green chiles. the tofu batch was fine in terms of liquid, but i ended up having to boil down the turkey batch once i got the beans & broth in.

Aloha, I made this dish with little or no problem as long as you clean as you cook. I used big tortilla's and my friends and family loved them. Now they want me to cook more and more.
