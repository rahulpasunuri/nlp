I definately think it needed the saffron because otherwise it was very bland. I used long grain rice and I have to say the amount of liquid and cooking time were perfect but it says it makes 6 servings. I was shocked to find I had about 15 servings of this! I will make it again for a pot luck but we will be eating this forever.

I made this dish recently, but had to do it in two stages because I do not have that much time after work. It was great. I used my own homemade chicken stock and I used a little more saffron. It is absolutely delicious. Also I had to use Jasmine rice as i could not find the alborio.

Tried Arborio Rice and didn't like it. Used long-grain rice and it was a big hit and is a regular for my family, who love it.

Followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with a really disappointing dish. Would not consider preparing again.

This tasted something like what "Arroz con Pollo" would taste like if you bought it at McDonalds.

Very close to my Cuban mother's recipe, the only differences are we use a condiment called Bijol, available in most grocery stores these days, instead of the more expensive saffron, we add Sherry, and we use Piementos instead of roasted red peppers. I've also gotten lazy and use boned chicken thighs and breasts. Oh, well, mama would probably approve since she had to "make do" in the old days when we had to bring Bijol back from Cuba after our visits each summer.

Tp the cook from New York....didn't you read the reviews before you made this? If you would have you could have seen that no one has even commented on it since May of last year! That's a tell tale sign to me that it would not be very good!

I don't understand why everyone despises this dish. I did have to adjust the baking time so that the rice was more tender, but it turned out fine in the end. I also used boneless chicken breasts -- it made a very easy and healthful dinner that everyone enjoyed.

I'm sorry to say this dish was a disaster. Did anyone on your staff taste it? I'm an experienced cook and followed instructions to the letter and it turned out really bad. I would not try it again.

I would make this recipe again with certain modifications. First, I would leave out the saffron. For a lovely golden color, you can also steep annato,or, achiote in very hot olive oil. Annato can be found in Mexican groceries as well as larger supermarkets on the West coast (i.e. Ralph's, Albertson's, Vons, Stater Bros.). Remove the annato and go on to the first step of the recipe. I also like to add capers and green olives and brown the chicken first with chili powder.

You really need to check your authenticity of a recipe before giving it to the world. My family is from Barcelona, Spain and we have never had such a bad tasting arroz con pollo. Please redo your receipe by beginning with the Baking in the oven and the usage of Saffron. There is a product called "Bijol" which is sold in all supermarkets, it is a food coloring. TRY IT, IT"S ALOT CHEAPER AND GIVES THE SAME EFFECT!

i had a "latin" dinner party at my house and this did not turn out well at all. I followed the recipe exactly and the rice was not completely cooked. I had to improvise in order to save the evening.

I am spanish and this is one of our normal dishes. Normally we use artificial colour instead of expensive saffron and I personally don't get the rice into the oven. If we use parboiled rice, we just leave the food for 99% of the water to evaporate and it's very important to not to stir too much. If you use round rice, which is not parboiled, you should be very careful. Be exact on the measures of the rice and the water, use a cup and use exactly 2 cups of water by one of rice, and don't heat it until the rice is boiled. Stop boiling 5 minutes before it finishes, drop some garlic and parsil cut into very small pieces and leave it with its own heat while eating the starters. That's the way to have the rice a perfect way

I compared this recipe to an authentic recipe our family used from Spain. This one is a bit watered down, but okay. With regards to the person looking for a Mexican dish, Arroz con Pollo is not Mexican. It is a Spanish dish which has been adopted by the Mexicans which, I'm sure, has undergone some transformation. As most Mexicans and Spaniards know, these two cuisines are not the same!

This was delicious, easy and quick once all the chopping was done. I tried to make it "low fat" by not using any oil at all. I used skinned chicken drumsticks and thighs and non-stick cookware. I didn't quite see the point of steaming the saffron -- couldn't I have just crumbled it without that step?? Very tasty and filling and I will definitely make it again!

I wasn't sure whether this recipe was a Mexican recipe or not. My background is of mexican origin, and this wasn't at all like any arroz con pollo I've ever encountered. The recipe itself was fine, but if you were aiming for a mexican meal, this isn't it.
