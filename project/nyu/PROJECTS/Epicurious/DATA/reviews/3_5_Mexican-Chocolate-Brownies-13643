I made these brownies for Cinco de Mayo and they were soooooo gooood. I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't find whole blanched almonds so I used chopped blanched almonds. They were chewy, chocolatey deliciousness. I made them a second time and doubled the recipe which worked fine. They are really good cold too. These brownies will take care of any chocolate craving you might have. This recipe is a keeper.

I love this brownie recipe, everyone who has tried it is in love. I add a bit of dark chili powder and cayenne pepper for some exotic heat. Also, I used 4oz of bittersweet chocolate and 1oz of brute cocoa powder. The dark cocoa adds a nice deep chocolate flavor.

Love this recipe! Brought to a mexican night party and it was a hit. Served with Dolce de Leche ice cream. Used entire stick of butter and pulled out of oven a little early to prevent dry brownies. I will double the recipe next time because The servings were very small.

Loved these brownies! I had almond meal so I used 1/2 cup of that rather than toasting and processing almonds. I added 1/8 teaspoon chipotle chile powder and used about 2 tablespoons less flour. Baked for 27 minutes. The flavor was awesome and the fudgy texture great.

AMAZING! Used 1T. extra of butter. They are so rich and fudgy. My new favorite brownie!

These brownies are fantastic. An instant favorite! To make them spicey I added 1/2 tsp ground red pepper; and to add the exotic, 1 tsp Navan Black Madagascar Vanilla Cognac. Based on the other reviews about dryness, I used a whole stick of butter. Also, whisking dry ingredients in a seperate bowl before adding, slightly beating each egg before adding, and processing almonds until indistinguishable from sugar are key.

These brownies were absolutely delicious; what's more they are really very simple to make and very forgiving. I managed to make them for the first time while living in a country with no electricity (hence no food processor) and only two settings on my oven (on and off), and they were still great!

I have made these brownies a number of times and have always had great results. You definitely need to grind the almonds very fine. They come out very moist and very chocolatey. I usually serve them with homemade cinnamon ice cream and chocolate sauce and it is fabulous!

These were pretty disappointing. Not very chocolaty and kind of dry. I even underbaked them, as suggested by some of the reviews, but they were just not what I was expecting.

Like the reviewer before me I didn't think these were the greatest BUT everyone else begged to differ. These brownies flew off the plate! Maybe it was the 'twist' to regular brownies? We served these with a small scoop of Bryer's vanilla ice cream.

i personally didnt think these brownies were anything special, but everybody else seemed to love them! if you have a great brownie recipe already, just add a little cinnamon and they would probably be better than these.

I love the combination of chocolate, cinnamon, and almonds. I second the recommendation to grind the almonds very fine -- the dough is rather gloppy if you don't. They have come out a bit dry in the past, but a bit of ice cream or chocolate sauce, with a dusting of cinnamon, fixes that handily.

Based on a recipe from an old Mexican cookbook I bought at a market when I use to live (sigh) in California,I used toasted pine nuts in this instead of almonds. I made this for a Mexican dinner I made for my new friends in the Great White North, and got great reviews!

These brownies are great for adults as well as kids. Our "leftovers" got richer & denser, more "fudge-like", after sitting in the fridge overnight. Sinfully delicious!

we LOVED these brownies! 12 guests and more than 12 moans of "YUM...these are SO GOOD!" mine turned out very moist and rich... not too sweet but chocolately and complex (due to the almonds, i guess) i served them with vanilla ice cream and caramel-rum sauce but they were great plain, too!

Great taste! love the chocolate/cinnamon combo. I found these brownies to be bit dry, but with a high quality vanilla ice cream on top it fixes it right up! I doubled this recipe for company. I used pecans instead of the almonds.

I really liked this recipe but I will cut the salt in half next time as it seemed salty in some bites (despite mixing the dry ingredients before adding to mixture) and I will sift the dry ingredients as suggested by another cook. Make sure to ground the almonds FINELY. I also added about 1T of vanilla for more taste.

I thought these were a little dry and a little too sweet. In recent months I've made lots of different brownie recipes, trying to find the perfect one, and I really think the best is the ultra-easy recipe on the back of the Baker's unsweetened chocolate box.

I made these brownies recently and thought they were really good. I served them plain with just powdered sugar but, they would also be very good cut into larger squares and topped with ice cream or flavored whipped cream.

These brownies are deadly! I made a few changes. I needed enough for 40 guests so doubled recipe and made 2 batches using a 10x15 pyrex baking dish. Used almonds and pecans (ran out of almonds, did not toast), added a bit more flour, an extra 4 T for the double recipe, dusted pan with cocoa instead of flour. Also remember to sift dry ingredients together. Absolutley wonderful. Served large brownie for dessert with small scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Rave reviews.

I omitted the almonds and this was still the best homemade brownie recipe I've tried.

Many happy faces and positive remarks from those who sampled both batches baked (home and work). All enjoyed and commented on the cinnamon and almond flavors w/chocolate. Definitely "a keeper."

My family just goes CRAZY for these brownies. Once you try them you will want to make them again.

We made these and the other Mexican brownie recipe on this site over the same weekend. We did not like these as well - but they are still very good. A little dry. Better the second day & they made excellent, packable bars for a family hike.

When I was in 3rd grade.(1 year ago)I made this for our rainforest bake sale. It sold so fast I didn't even get a chace to buy some. But later in class my friends told me it was delicious.

Hearing the enthusiastic reviews of this recipe, I was eager to try it. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience, since I had no white sugar and had to use brown sugar and honey, which yielded a bitter flavor. Not to mention I think I cooked them a minute or two long so they were bitter AND dry. eheh. Oh well. I want to try them again under better circumstances. (my sister said they were so intensely chocolatey they gave her a headache) So, the lesson is: Cook just a little less and no honey or brown sugar substitutions, even if you're cheap.

WHOA! What rich brownies! These were great--the cinnamon and almonds gave them a wonderful texture and flavor. Definitely not for those watching their cholesterol, though....

I made these brownies for dessert after a burrito buffet at my house. My eight co-workers devoured the plate and gave them four forks up!

These brownies are simply amazing. Try pairing them with premium-quality coffee ice cream (I suggest one the of Starbucks varieties). You will be blown over by the simple, yet decadent combination!

tHESE BROWNIES WERE TRULY UNIQUE! I WOULD COOK THEM ABOUT 5 MINUTES LONGER THOUGH. IF YOU WANT A MORE INTENSE CHOCOLATE TASTE ADD 2 TABLESPOONS OF COCOA. THEN THEY WILL BE PERFECT!!!

Grab a glass of ice cold milk and enjoy! I had to make a second batch to keep up with the demand in my house

This was yummy. I served them with vanilla ice cream. Make sure you grind the almonds finely. Mine were a little too coarse

In all the different brownies I have tasted in my 55 years, this is definitely the best ever. It will become the brownie receipe I use in the future. Thanks for sharing this marvelous receipe.
