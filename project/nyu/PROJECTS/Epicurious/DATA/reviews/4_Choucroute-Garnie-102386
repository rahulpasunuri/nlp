My father, who lives in the Alsace region, always uses pigs feet in this dish. He uses hocks too but their sausages are a lot different than you can find here. I suppose this dish is flexible in its ingredients. In his town they traditionally used to take there dish to the baker's (as well as many others) and they would cook as the bread oven cooled and be ready when they returned from working the fields. (They don't do this now but thought the tradition was worth relating).

Omitted ham hocks as suggested by reviews, replaced with chicken broth. No juniper berries. Otherwise followed recipe. Everyone loved it. Will make again!

Honestly, I've been counting the days till the weather was (finally) cool enough to make this spectacular dish again. I discovered this recipe last year, and made it at least a half dozen times over the winter. It's the only recipe I'll ever use for choucroute, and has replaced my family's old Pennsylvania Dutch standby of pork ribs and sauerkraut. I do make several changes to the recipe, which include; forgoing the ham hocks (they over power the taste of the other meats in the dish and lend a "stringy" texture to the velvety sauerkraut and apples). Instead I just add low sodium chicken stock. Also, I add smoked pork chops to the sausage combination. Delectable. As far as the apples are concerned, I use what I happen to have on hand, which is usually Golden Delicious or Granny Smith, and neither compromise the flavor. Finally, I usually end up buying a nice Riesling since I can't find the Alsatian wine, and no one ever complains. On a final note; the juniper berries are essential; don't skip this ingredient. And if you make this a day in advance you'll thank yourself; it is out of this world, and cold-weather comfort food at its' best.

I did not have all of the meat and sausage required so used beef broth instead of ham hocks and didn't have quite all of the sausage. It was still delicious and I bet would have been even better if I had had all of the sausage. I also used champagne instead of wine because I heard that is more traditional. (Good way to finish any leftover or open sauerkraut in your fridge)

Delicious even when heavily modified to reflect what I had. Used fresh shredded savoy cabbage, not sauerkraut; braised it with 1 onion, some smoked Cure 81 ham, apples, a tablespoon of turbinado sugar, plus cloves, juniper berries and peppercorns. Added white wine and braised for 30 or so minutes; splash or two of cider vinegar at the end. Browned bratwurst, chicken bratwurst, and knackwurst separately, then served on top. Stonewall Farms horseradish mustard on the side.

Guests loved this, I followed other reviewers advice: skipped ham hock and used 2 cups stock instead, added 2 pounds cubed smoked pork chops, made a day in advance, tied spices in cheese cloth. Next time I would replace the kielbasa with more smoked pork chop and cut it into larger pieces. I also think there was too much sauerkraut and would cut it in half.

This is exceptional. A crowd pleaser. I skipped the ham hock step, used chicken broth instead. Added garlic to my cheese cloth spice pouch. I used bratwusts and smoked sausage. Only one and a half jar could fit in my pan. Made everything stove top. takes time, but it's pretty easy to make.

It was delicious. I used Fiji apples beacause I don't care for Reds. I didn't have any juniper berries, and used the chardoney on hand instead and it it turned out great. The apples were delicious! Tossed the potatoes in butter because hey, this ain't no fat free dish.

Absolutely delicious. I have often made the "quick" version (also good) but my family and I loved this one. Prep time is not too bad once you've got everything - next time I would do the ham hocks in advance. Ingredients are key - I am lucky to live near a German deli and their quality wursts and kraut added a lot. I like this with a dry Alsatian white such as Trimach Gewürztraminer or Pinot Blanc.

Rating: 4
Super choucroute recipe, and easy to do, once you do the shopping for all of the ingredients. I cooked the ham hock the day before, and that worked well.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe though I did not follow exactly. I left out the ham hocks, bratwurst,and knockwurst. Instead used 8 ounces apple smoked bacon, 1lb keilbasa, 1 lb pork chops, and 1 lb chicken/apple sausage. Used homemade sauerkraut from red cabbage, gala apples instead of Delicious. I also skipped the potatoe ring. I happenned to have the Alsace Pinot Blanc on-hand and used the juniper berries which gave the dish a unique aroma while cooking. This ia an excellent recipe. Just ate it for the second night in a row and I think it was the best after sitting a day and half.

This is a very good recipe for a traditional French Brasserie dish. I made the recipe exactly as written and plan in the future to skip the ham hocks step for two reasons: the very smoky stock overwhelmed the flavor of the sauerkraut and the dry bits of hock meat did not appeal to me. I have been served Choucroute Garnie many times and the sauerkraut is generally not so full of bacon and ham hock bits as this recipe includes. It is very important however to saute the onions in bacon fat. The apple is important and after cooking, the peel is the same color as the sauerkraut and barely distinguishable. Do not skip the apples. As for the wine, I do not believe that a dry white is crucial. A Riesling or Gewürztraminer will also work just fine. The juniper berries, cloves, allspice berries, and bay leaves are wonderful. To bake this dish in the oven is an option. I have exactly the same results with Choucroute (in a good heavy Dutch oven) on the stove top over a low flame. Buy some horseradish mustard, good beer, hearty bread and invite some friends over. You will convert some who think that they dont like sauerkraut.

I am a personal chef. I tried this recipe on new clients and it was a hit. They (and I) loved it. I will definetely be making this dish again.

I am a complete novice when it comes to this type of cooking, yet despite that and the fact that I substituted beef broth for the ham hocks and broth, this recipe was excellent. I would strongly recommend to anyone with a love for German/Bavarian style brats and saurkraut.

Really delicious! This smells fabulous when it's baking. I was able to lighten this dish in a few ways. I made the ham hock broth 2 days ahead and skimmed the layer of fat while it was cold. I also used only 4 oz. bacon and drained off all but ~ 2 T. of the rendered fat. I set aside the bacon and crumbled on top of the finished dish for a bit of crunch. I soaked the sauerkraut, it was just right, and used bratwurst, kielbasa and smoked pork chops, which were lean and tasty. I would resist the temptation to add more broth/wine while it's baking as there's plenty of liquid already, and the browned sausages make a nice presentation.

Delicious and hearty, this choucroute recipe makes a huge amount so that I made one fourth to feed two and still had lots of leftovers. I used smoked pork chops, knockwurst, bockwurst, and bratwurst. Keep this in mind for your own Octoberfest.

I have made this recipe dozens of times. It's wonderful as-is, but it's fun to substitute other meats, like fresh pork sausage or smoked pork tenderloins. I add allspice and cloves, and I think they taste great.

Rating: 4
Excellent ... Excellent ... Served Choucroute Garnie as a main dish after Salade Vigneronne and followed by Alsatian Apple pie ... Excellent dinner. I skipped the Knockwurst ... but smoked sausage and bratwust were very succulent and sauerkraut not sour or gassy. Well worth the effort.

I made this dish using pork shoulder chops cut in cubes and a chicken stock cube. Perhaps a bit less tasty but it saves a lot of time. Like one of the former reviewers I thought the allspice a bit out of place so I didn't use that, but I did use four cloves. I also liked the serving method with the potatoes dipped in parsley and the additional mustard and horseradish. I'll make this again, if need be again on a hot day, just like this time. It's that good.

Rating: 4
One of my favorite dishes. Serving this dish with the mustards and horseradish is a must. I have found that people who generally do not like saurkraut tend to enjoy this. However, I do not think the cloves and allspice are necessary (this is not a fruitcake) and I always use fresh saurkraut from the refrigerator section not jarred or canned.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I made this for 11 people and still had leftovers, even though they all had seconds and thirds. The next time I made it I persuaded a confirmed sauerkraut hater to taste it, and she admitted it was good. Put the spices in a little square of cheesecloth and tie with a string...then they can be fished out easily. I didn't think Red Delicious apples were EVER edible, but they seemed to be just right in this. A great cold-weather dish!

I keep making this recipe. In fact, I keep thinking about the next time I'll do it (when I feel it's cold enough outside). Contrary to some people here, I don't do anything to make it less fat. On the contrary, I keep bacon grease on hand to had it to the choucroute. If you can get them, smoked pork chops are one of the best things to add to the dish.

This is a pretty good version of Alsatian Sauerkraut. I'm not sure why there is so much controversy over if it is French or German though. Anyone who knows anything of Alsatian history will tell you that Alsatians are beer drinking French, or wine drinking Germans depending on your perspective. Although Alsace is now part of France, history shows that Alsatians have been a rough 50/50 mixture of both cultures and at various times a part of both countries. Sauerkraut most certainly is brought in from the German. Let's see, sauerkraut, pork and sausages - that really sounds French! NOT. I would not have served this at an all "French" dinner party. Alsatian Apple Tart or Quiche would have been a better representation of Alsation French cuisine.

Very good recipe. I bought a "paprika speck" (paprika flavoured bacon) which I boiled with the pork and it gave the entire dish a reddish colour and a mild paprika flavour. Very good and very filling!

Really excellent recipe with easily obtained ingredients. I did drain some of the bacon grease before adding onions. Purchased sausage from a German market where they make many varieties. They are leaner that the supermarket brands and the dish was not full of fat.

This was just so delicious! I couldn't find juniper berries, so I substituted a generous splash of gin. (I wrapped the spices in cheesecloth for easy removal later.) I simmered the ham hocks the day before and skimmed the fat from the top of the reduced broth. I also poured off a good amount of the fat from the bacon/brats, leaving enough to saute the onions and apples. We expected it to be somewhat on the heavy or greasy side and were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't - just full of wonderful flavor. My husband and my teenage son have hearty appetites, but we still had plenty left over. I can't wait to have this again. Yum, yum, yum!

Iv'e made this twice (substituted chopped ham for the fatty hamhock) and converted former sauerkraut haters (myself included.) Instead of baking, I simmered it in a crock pot for 2 hours. Although the family prefers low fat meals, this is a great one to splurge on.

Rating: 3
Key to this recipe is the quality of sauerkraut and sausages. Sauerkraut from tin cans won't cut it here. I go to a local Polish store for the sausages and sauerkraut. The hamhock is nice, but the other sausages usually taste stronger.

Rating: 4
Served this as part of an "everything French" dinner for 35 guests. It was very well received by all, expecially those who had only tasted "sour"kraut in the past. This is not a heart healthy meal and I suspect some of the fat from the bacon or hocks could be removed without much loss of flavor. As others have noted, the Alsatian white wine is a key flavor component.

Rating: 3
Great dish. Agree that as it is Alsatian, requires a tart white wine - Riesling is perfect. Chardonay won't work as well. I did omit the apples, however. But used lots of potatoes.

Rating: 4
This is just the best recipe ever! I recommend purchasing good quality sausages and going through the trouble of boiling a hamhock. This can always be done the day before if you're short on time. The dish makes a beautiful presentation and can be eaten for days! A wonderful Fall or Winter dinner.

This is the best Choucroute recipe I've ever made. I will not look further. It will be with me for my lifetime. I lived near the Alsace and this brings back memories. I had 8 friends over and the sounds of lip smacking and low moans of satisfaction said it all. Do serve it with a nice Alsacian white wine. Do not omit the ham hocks and be sure to get good quality sausages. I also added pork chops to the recipe.

Rating: 4
This is delicious. I've tried several choucroute garnie recipes on Christmas Eve, and this one has great flavor. Next time, I will replace some of the kielbasa with other sausages, just for variety. I used smoked pork chops, too. Would have used smoked pork butt except I couldn't find it. I added a tsp of caraway seeds, too. Everyone (except the health-food types) loved this meal!

The whole peppercorns, allspice, and cloves were just awful to bite into. This recipe makes so much more than 8 servings. We ended up throwing most of it out. Nobody ate it after the first day. It was definitely nothing special.

Talk about a valve clogging good piece of work! This is it. If you even have one good German meal a year this should be it. Dont forget a decent beer on the side.
