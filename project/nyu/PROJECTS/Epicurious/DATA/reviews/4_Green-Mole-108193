it's swiss chard. You should be able to find it in any grocery's produce section. It usually has red stems and large green leaves.

This was delicious! I didn't know what Swiss Charred Leaves were though. I even asked at a Mexican Store and they had no idea, so I made it without. Still good though.

Having just returned from Cuernavaca, I can tell you that yes, tomatillos and tomates verdes are different. Tomatillos are cherry sized and tomates verdes are "jitomate" (red tomato) sized...

Yes, in her cookbooks Diana Kennedy calls tomatillos tomato verde.

Are tomate verde the same as tomatillos?
