This is an extraordinarily easy but showy dish...the flavors are phenomenal. And, as other reviewers have mentioned, using half water and half milk is the key to success cooking the grits. Additionally, I stir the grits fairly regularly (not as often as one would risotto, but at least every minute or two). That makes for super creamy grits...and super creamy grits make for happy grit eaters, even ones who say they don't like grits!

Super easy with great results. I couldn't find the stone-ground grits so I used yellow grits and followed those directions with adding cream at end. The significant other doesn't like ham so I used canadian bacon instead. Used stewed tomatoes - Mexican style. Added a little kick. Used onions instead of green onions and added fresh garlic. Didn't add water at end.

Really delicious - a great way to make scallops substantial enough for a cold day. The tomato reduction added flavor and color to an otherwise white plate. Instead of adding cream to the grits, I added softened goat cheese, it seemed to complement the other flavors nicely. A new favorite.

This was delicious. I made the grits with half water and half milk but other than that I followed the recipe.

Excellent! We followed the recipe exactly except we couldn't get chorizo at our chicken sausage loving grocery and substituted hot Italian sausage.

We've been making this for either New Year's Eve dinner or on New Year's Day for several years now. I convinced a co-worker to try it and it got rave reviews for taste and ease of preparation. Great recipe! Easy to fix and great tasting. We often serve it with fried green tomatoes.

This makes a delicious dinner served with a green salad with a lemon vinegarette. Using good stone-ground grits is key! If you don't live in the south, consider ordering some online. I usually use a can of tomatoes instead of the fresh ones and I deglaze with vermouth before adding everything back into the pan. Depending on who I'm serving, I sometimes double the scallops and use no shrimp, sometimes double the shrimp and use no scallops. I almost always use pancetta instead of ham (unless I have leftover ham on hand). The recipe is fantastic as written and it stands up well to variations to suit your personal taste.

I'm not a very experienced cook, so I loved how easy and absolutely delicious this was! I couldn't find chorizo sausage so I used andouille instead and it was great. Also threw in some chopped zucchini for color. I would make this for company--it looks complicated but really isn't. Definitely impressive.

This is a perfect winter meal.

We really enjoyed this. The flavors are just right and blend very well. I liked how the chorizo was a little sweet and spicy but my family said it was to hard to chew. Next time I will try a different sausage or chop the chorizo up smaller. I also liked how it was not greasy tasting or too rich from the butter.The amount of butter was perfect. I also did not peel or seed the tomatoes and they were fine as is. The grits were great. I couldn't find stone ground so I used regular and I shaved the cook time to 25 minutes which makes it a great after church for brunch

I used 1 cup of 2% milk in place of 1 cup of the water, and eliminated the heavy cream. We couldn't tell the difference in the grits. They were still creamy and delicious. We like to make them in the crock pot, cooking them on high for about three hours, with a head start by heating the liquid on the stove or in the microwave. The clean-up is much easier, as grits tend to stick to the pot when cooked directly over the heat. A rice steamer works well, too.

Making this again for dinner tonight...Last time I added collard greens to this recipe and it is wonderful I just cook the collards with a little bacon and place on the plate with the grits ... I have made it both times without the scallops and it is still great. It is something close to a dish at a local restaurant that I love.

Always have been looking for something different to do with grits...and now I have found it. Awesome. Served it for company with a gutsy red wine and beer.

I LOVE this dish! I first enjoyed it at S.N.O.B. on a recent trip to Charleston, and am so happy to be able to make it at home! Even my friends who thought they didn't like grits loved it!

I just returned from a vacation in Charleston and enjoyed these grits at Slightly Up the Creek, a sister restaurant for Slightly Up North. I am so excited to find this recipe! The grits are absolutely delicious. I've eaten at some of the world's top restaurants, and this was among my more memorable meals.

Made this tonight for dinner for my sausage-and-seafood-loving husband who hates grits.....believe I've got a convert! I'm not big on grits myself, but loved this dish. I'd put a little more garlic (2-3 cloves) and a bit more salt, but other than that, it's divine. Quick, easy, a definite keeper.

This recipe takes Shrimp and Grits to heights unknown! Not the traditional method, but delicious and easy. Even folks who don't like grits rave about these. And the stone ground grits are great, but cooking the instant grits long and slow will work in a pinch.

This recipe is amazingly delicious! Be sure to use stone-ground grits as opposed to the regular old grits you typically find in many stores. This could be very difficult to find in a grocery store up north, but you can always order them. I've found that it's best to use Jimmy Dean Sage smoked pork sausage, cut into circular pieces.

Thanks you for your request Mr. Gordon! I have eaten this dish at "Slightly North" and plan to do it again this year when I go down for the Cooper River Bridge Run. Try it, it is excellent. Now all we need is a muffelatta recipe from Central Grocery!

I tried the recipe, but substituted rock lobster tails for the shrimp...yum!
