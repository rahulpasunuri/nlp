America has been missing out on these. OLD English favorite. I have a girl friend here suggest adding a brushing of Dijon mustard to the sausage. Then you roll it in the puff pastry and surprise! Pork pies are another long kept secret. Yummy!

These are simple and delicious! I had a wasabi dip on the table and somebody started dipping these into that dip ~ that was really, really good!

Easy, fast and impressive. Bake time cooks meat all the way through which was a concern of mine. After 20 minutes bake time the rolls needed a minute or less under the broiler to brown otherwise they looked pale. This is my new best appetizer recipe. Very tasty, lots of compliments. I used puff pastry which is so much easier to use than phyllo for me. Bayside California

Delicious! Made for my husband for an early portable breakfast on the way to his birthday golf foursome. A childhood favorite of his - and he said they were better than any he's had before. Used sage pork sausage for some extra flavor. Easy to make ahead and freeze for later use.

This is FABULOUS! My husband and I made spicy Italian Sausage on Saturday and with the bulk that did not make it into the casings, I made this on Sunday for snacks. Great recipe. So easy and yet elegant. I can hardly wait to do it again for the freezer. Plus the combinations are endless. We might do some marinara next time for dipping or if we use our fresh brat recipe, serve with mustard. This is exactly why I come to epicurious...great recipes that fit into our life.
