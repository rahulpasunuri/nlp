This is really good; even my teens liked it. I read the reviews, and used half vegetarian broth and half water, used at least 3 times the amount of oregano, added about 14 oz. of tomato sauce. I also used an entire big sweet onion (more than the 1 cup) and lots of garlic. It really was good and would probably be just as good with other vegetables - whatever you've got on hand.

This recipe is good as is; however, to make it absolutely GREAT, do the following: use chicken broth instead of water, replace 14 oz of the broth with 14 oz seasoned tomato sauce, add a spoonful of Thai chili garlic sauce (or better yet, Thai chili paste with sweet basil leaves!) and add about 1/4 cup pesto sauce just before serving. We also add another 1/2 to whole can of beans for a truly filling meal.

This is my favorite soup - Once the squash are in season, I make this at least once a month, sometimes twice. It's a great way to go through your CSA and doesn't need a side! Love it.

This was a big hit. Didn't have kale, so used chard. Instead of 6 cups of water, used 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth, 3 cups of water, and 1 tbsp double-concentrate tomato paste.

I really love this recipe. My favorite variation so far is when I've made my own chicken stock from a leftover carcass, and added the remaining meat from the bones to the final soup. Many chefs say that water is preferential to commercial stock (http://ruhlman.com/2007/11/thanksgiv ing-th/), and it may be that our palates are less accustomed to more subtle flavors. If you do use commercial stock, mix it with 1/2 water (3 cups stock, 3 cups water). There are a lot of great quick and easy vegetable stock recipes out there, too, should you want to make your own. If you're using kosher salt, be sure to increase the amount of salt based on the brand that you use (http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/sa lt.html#measures). I generally double the carrot, for color and for flavor. And last, but not least, serve with shaved or grated parmesan or pecorino (or add parmesan or pecorino rind to the stock along with the kale and beans). You won't be sorry.

i definitely suggest subbing at least half of the water with broth. i also added a spoonful of pesto. i've made it twice so far and everyone loved it.

Marvelous recipe- I did embellish it though. I added tomato paste, hot peppers, turkey italian sausage, and pesto to the soup. I also used leftover whey from homemade cheese in lieu of water. It was marvelous!!I'm adding it to the rotation. What a great way to use up our CSA produce!

Rating: 4
I made this mostly as written, although I can't imagine just using water. I thought vegetable broth would compliment the dish more than chicken would, and I added a can of stewed tomatoes. Since I had a stray sweet potato, I threw that in there and added a touch of garlic-chili sauce to balance the sweet (also I like my food a bit spicy). Shortly after the kale went in, I tossed in a random assortment of other vegetables I had leftover - mushrooms, orange and green pepper, and some Tofurky sausage. I think this is a great recipe to use up leftovers, although I think some sort of leafy green is needed. Again, don't use plain water.

Yummy, wholesome, veggie-generous soup. Easy peasy. Good balance of dark green and brighter flavors. Added a bit of chicken bouillon, no regrets.

This was delicious. I made as directed except used chicken broth, not water, and a spoonful of pesto before serving. It made 7 two-ladleful bowls of soup and I wish I had more leftovers. I used the buttercup squash and yes, it's a good thing for the squash haters in the family. I think adding a little barley to it would also be a good addition, but its simplicity is good on its own too.

This was the perfect recipe to use up much of our leftover weekly CSA allotment. It's quick, easy, and very kid-friendly. I used acorn squash and a bit more kale than called for. Also, I was out of onions, so I used onion powder instead. An earlier commenter was right: two bowls of this is almost too filling!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I omitted the beans and added Italian sausage. I also over cooked the veggies, but that ended up being ok. Everyone loved it.

I made this soup with several delicata squash that came in our CSA box. As others mentioned, it was initially a little bland, but I added some pesto (also got tons of basil in the CSA box). Squash-hating husband loved it!

We just finished this delicious soup. I followed the recipe, with the following additions: I used 4 cups of beef stock and 2 cups of water, three small tomatoes, skinned, seeded and peeled; and a handful of fresh chopped parsley, basil and oregano. I also reduced the salt to just a tad less than 1 teaspoon. It was really good!!

Rating: 4
I read all the reviews before making this, because I thought the written recipe looked bland. I made sure to pick up fresh herbs when I hit the grocery store, because other people commented that this recipe is a wonderful base for each chef to adjust to their taste. I love my food to have a nice kick, so I took other reviewers' recommendation and added in a half teasopoon of red pepper flakes to the oil as I sauteed the garlic and onion. I used delicata squash, which I had never tasted before. I was very pleased with its texture, which stayed solid even after boiling. The key to beating the bland was a combination of homemade vegetable stock and the addition of a handful of fresh chopped parsley and basil and 2 sprigs of thyme. I then decided to nix the kale, and to substitute Ditalini pasta for the potatoes. I don't love tomatoes in general, but I added a can of diced, because it felt more authentic. A huge hit, my carnivore boyfriend went back for seconds and wanted thirds but it was so hearty that he decided he only had room for a little ice cream, to fill in the cracks!

I think this is a delicious vegetable soup. I use the 4C of vegetable stock and 2 C water and delicata squash. A great lunch for a cold day!

Rating: 4
I thought this was very good and not bland at all. The substitution of an Italian blend of spices instead of oregano (I didn't have plain oregano) might have made the difference. Other than that, I added the kale with the other veggies instead of with the beans because that's how I originally saw the recipe written. I've also made it with swiss chard instead of kale and that also worked well. It's quick and easy to make with stuff I usually have in the fridge so no special trips to the store.

Rating: 3
Followed the recipe fairly closely, but omitted the beans & used pacifica low sodium veggie broth. Agree with others that it was a little bland. i think would be better with sausage, tomatoes, or cheese, as others have mentioned. Alternatively, you could sautee carrots & celery along with onions for mirepois, along with whatever herbs you were using. But as-is, it's a nice way to enjoy fresh fall produce.

Rating: 1
This is a good start to a soup, but has no flavor. We added thyme, rosemary, bay leaves and, as we served it, parmesgian, and still found it bland. I'd definitely substitute vegetable or chicken stock. I will probably look for a different recipe.

Rating: 3
This is a solid soup recipe, and makes good use of fall ingredients. Definitely use a veggie stock (we used 4c stock to 2c H20), as it adds much needed flavor. Any kind of fresh herbs on hand works well. Serve with garlic bread and salad for a yummy weekend dinner.

Rating: 2
Pretty good. Actually, as far as kale recipes go, this one might be my favorite. That's handy since kale is the only pest-free veggie in my organic garden, so I always have bunches of it. For that reason, I'll probably make it again. Maybe less salt. Next time I'll try 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken broth.

Rating: 3
I was looking for a different minestrone than the typical tomato, pasta, bean, vegetable soup, and this is perfect. I love the combination of vegetables (but I subbed rutabaga for the potatoes since I had a beautiful one from the farmer's market). I did use chicken broth instead of water; I added about 1/4 cup small pasta, and I added a little red pepper flakes with the onions, etc. Also, I had some fresh thyme so I used that instead of the dried oregano. With those changes I think it's a 4 fork recipe, but I think with water it would have been bland.

This was good, and hit the spot for having the flu and having something that hubby could make that was still healthy. Used olive oil, double garlic, more onions (carmelized) more oregano, and chicken broth, and hot pepper flakes, and it was still a wee bit bland to be honest with you. BUT, I might make it again, and it sure tastes better than canned soup. Oh, I also added a bit of pasta at the very end.

With the changes I made to the recipe, I've found a keeper that I will make again and again... This is not only delicious but a very pretty soup! I added 1 lb of sweet, mild italian sausage, rosemary instead of oregano and a little nutmeg. I also tossed in a parsnip and used 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 water for the 6 cups of liquid. I also added less kale and more beans (2 cans, drained). It was absolutely delicious. I served with a pinch of crusty whole grain bread with plenty of butter and a tall glass of cold whole milk. It was just scrumptious!

Delicious! I made a vat for 15 people and served it with really good bread and butter. It was a huge hit and tasted comforting while still being really healthy.

Great soup. Didn't have kale on hand, so added 4 c. of greens instead (collard, mustard, etc). Cooked them down for 20 minutes before adding all other ingredients. Also used leek instead of onion. Served on top of day old pumpernickel cubes. Delicious. Made 1:1 with vegetable broth and water.

I frequently make vegetable soups. Sadly, this is one of the worst recipes I have ever tried. It was not only almost flavorless, but also was actively unpleasant -- almost sour in flavor and excessively salty. No corrective measures (including the trusty salt-absorbing hunk of potato) could rescue it. Unfortunately it had to be thrown away despite the top-notch ingredients.

great soup. i had some leftover acorn squash from the table decor i used for thanksgiving and this was a delicious way to use it. i followed the recipe, with two slight changes: the 6 c. of water to 4 cups of vegetable broth + 2 c. water and i omitted the kale (although if i had it, i probably would have used it). nice thing about this soup is that it has a hearty taste, even without chicken broth. ...so many items i make to satify my 11-year-old vegetarian son will not satisfy my cheeseburger-loving daughter. i think i will make this fairly often.

Rating: 4
This is very, very good. My changes were no kale (I couldn't find it, but I think the soup is better without it), added a quarter of a can of chicken soup that i had in the fridge, doubled the garlic and cooked about 3 times as long as they said so the flavors would meld better. Seemed a little bland at first, but in a healthy comfort food sort of way, but after sitting overnight in the fridge -- amazing. Acorn squash was a complete pain to cut but I think it adds a necessary dimension to the flavor. I nuked it for a few minutes and that made it *slightly* easier to cut and peel.

I made this soup last night with acorn squash and it was delicious. I used low sodium vegetable broth instead of water. Diced tomatoes instead of potatoes, and spinach instead of kale. I also cooked it for longer that the recommended time. Wonderful, filling, and healthy. Perfect for a cold evening!

Rating: 3
I tried this soup twice--the second time I added a can of tomatoes, and I almost liked it better without them. I also used half chicken stock and half water--that way it's still healthy but has a litlle more flavor. I would definitely suggest (like other reviewers) cooking it for a longer amount of time than the recipe suggests. It's especially important to cook the soup long enough for the kale to become tender.

Rating: 4
I used buttercup squash which turned out to be delish in this soup. I also added tomato paste to give it some color and flavor, as well as blanched and peeled grape tomatoes. Not a big fan of kale and didn't add it- it was perfectly fine without it. An 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper added a little zip and complemented the sweetness of the squash and grape tomatoes perfectly. After adding the potatoes, celery, etc, it definitely takes more than 10 minutes for the veggies to get tender. Absolutely perfect for a cold, rainy night!

Rating: 3
Like other reviewers, I used vege and chicken broth, tripled the oregano, and added corn, fresh parsley and basil when I added the beans. I also added about 1/4tsp hot pepper flakes and it was pretty darn spicy - I'd recommend using no more than 1/8tsp. Overall, an excellent soup - way more flavour than you would think from the ingredients.

This is an easy and comforting meal. I used parsley, and topped with cheddar cheese. The beans may be changed for a slightly different flavor. Moosewood delivers again!

Loved this soup! Here's how I tweaked the recipe: After I sauteed the onions and garlic I added the squash (used delicata), celery, carrots, potatoes (cube and partially cook first) oregano (1 1/2 tsp) 1 tsp salt, freshly ground black pepper, and 1 tsp chipolte pepper flakes. Cooked for a few minutes then added to the crockpot along with 1 15 oz can Muir Glen diced tomatoes with garlic & onion, 1 1/4 cup browned Gimmelean sausage, 4 cups Imagine vegetable broth and 1 cup water. Cooked for about 6 hours on low then added beans and kale and cooked about another hour. Served with vegan parmesan but regular parmesan would work, too. I let this sit in the frig for a day before serving. Really enjoyed this soup!

This is a favorite fall staple. I always use a little organic vegetable bouillon with the water in fast soups to give it more flavour. I also added a little rosemary. Delicata squash is lovely in this soup. If I wasn't making this also for my toddler, I would add red pepper flakes.

This was very, very bland. After I tasted it, I kept trying to "fix" it. I added a can of stewed tomatoes and that helped, but not enough. Then I added some homemade chicken stock and that helped a lot, but this still isn't a recipe I'd ever make again.

I really liked this recipe. It was simple and tasty. I made a couple of modifications to this: 1) I added some tomato paste to the soup, 2) I thickened it a teeny bit at the end with cornstarch and 3) I added red chili flakes and a pinch of sage to give it an extra kick. The soup did require a ton of salt, but it was perfect for a cold, rainy evening (just like the recipe described!)

For those who -- rightly so -- are unhappy with the prospect of peeling and cutting an acorn squash, I have a couple of solutions. First, they could cook the squash separately by halving it, seeding it, and cooking it upside down in a pan holding a half-inch of water in the oven until it's tender enough to scoop out of the shell. Secondly; they could use squash that doesn't have ridges, making it an easier prospect for peeling. I like butternut for those occasions.

Rating: 2
I gave this a 2 just because it wasnt fabulous, but I liked it. I had a lot of difficulty with the squash - I had never prepared one before and had a hard time peeling it, and then the inside was quite grainy and stringy so I didn't know if it was bad or not? Needless to say I only used a little of it - maybe thats what was missing in the soup. I doubled the garlic and oregano and added a can of chopped tomatoes, and served just with a baguette. Not bad, will make it again.

This soup is quite delicious, although I used homemade vegatable broth, which made the soup a little too concentrated. I would also find some other way to prepare the squash: peeling and cubing acorn squash is just too dangerous and not worth the soup!

Made a version of this with veg's I had in the kitchen - 2 big carrots, 1 parsnip, a butternut squash & some pumpkin that I didn't know what else to do with. Used a Leek instead of kale, plus 250g mixed lentils pre-soaked overnight & a couple tsp Bouillon powder, a handful of chopped Parsley. Thickened it up further by whizzing about 1/4 of the cooked mixture in the processor & returning it to the pot. Had it with a couple chunks of granary bread... lovely (and easy !), a definite for the coming winter months.

I made this the first time with acorn squash. Just a tip - they are very hard (and dangerous!) to skin with a knife without wasting much. I expected a more robust flavor and thought the acorn squash was a bit too sweet. Today I have adapted the recipe: used Martha Stewart's vegetable stock recipe and butternut squash. I'm planning on letting it simmer all day, then add the kale and canellini beans tomorrow. I might thicken it a little to give it some more oomph. All the work aside, I think it's a great and healthy soup - you just need to tweak it a little. I served this the first time with Italian Ciabatta (recipe from this website) and thought they went well together. PS - triple the orgegano!

Being that it's the end of summer & my heirloom tomatoes are flourishing as well as my basil, I decided to incorporate them both. I omitted the kale & added many handfulls of fresh basil. I used fresh oregano & added a nice full sprig of thyme, as I also love full bodied foods. I also used Veggie stock from Trader Joes as well as the cubed butternut squash from there as well (much easier). This was delicious with a nice hot crusty loaf of ciabatta bread & a glass of sauvignon blanc wine.. Mmmm Mmmm Mmmmmm! Delish!

This is a great recipe, although I did make a few changes.. I was on a diet, so I skipped the potatoes and used a little more of the Acorn squash as a substitute (worked great!). I also skipped the beans, but added about two cups of diced fresh tomatoes at the same time as the kale.

This was an easy recipe and a big hit. Of course, I too made some changes. Substituted 6 cups vegetable broth instead of water. Added 1 can chic peas, 1 small zuchinni, an extra potato and 1 can petite diced tomatoes, drained. I omitted the oil and steamed the onions. And omitted the kale (my husband thought it was perfect without the strange greens he saw waiting to be added.) This only served 3 adults. Delicious and easy to adapt to what you have.

Glad to find this new recipe. It is definitely an idea starter and could serve as a springboard for whatever you like. I'm into pretty full-flavored foods, so I used vegetable broth instead of water. I doubled the garlic, used lots of freshly ground pepper and added a few sprigs of thyme and several sage leaves for some extra Fall flavor (then pulled them out before serving). This soup with some nice warm crusty bread & butter was a hit on a cold Fall afternoon. Unique enough for company too. I cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for so the carrots & potatoes were intact but had no crunch left in them. At the prescribed cook time, they seemed a little underdone - besides, the flavor of the broth kept improving as it simmered. ENJOY!

Delicious especially on the second day. To make it kid friendly I pureed about 2 cups of the soup and added about 1/4 cup pastina. I also did the same thing to the squash as another reviewer - I microwaved it (slice it in half and put in the dish cut side down with a little water, cover and microwave untill soft, scoop it out into the soup in the last five minutes of cooking.) This made the soup very creamy. Kids loved it!

like just about everyone else, i used vegetable broth instead of water, and the results were great. i also roasted the squash (along with the garlic, which i stuck into the squash cavities) and scooped it out instead of bothering with the peeling. this worked fine except that the squash sort of disintegrated into the soup! i kind of liked the effect, which gave the soup a slightly more substantial, richer broth.

I made this dish using a strip of smoked bacon to saute the onions and garlic, and then served it with a sprinkle of parmesean cheese and some lemon zest. Fantabulous.

I was delighted to see this recipe,as we have an over abundance of acorn squash! I used frozen chopped spinach instead of the kale.
