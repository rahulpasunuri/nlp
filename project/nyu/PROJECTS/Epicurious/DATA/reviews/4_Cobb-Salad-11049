How simple and good is this recipe?! I happily ate this for 3 days and that is not like me! I loved the Roquefort (I used blue cheese crumbles from TJ's) in the dressing. You could add more to your taste and to make it creamier as my husband prefers. I added 1 tbl. lemon juice, 1 small garlic clove minced and 1/2 tsp. sugar after reading other Cobb salad recipes.

So delicious. The vinaigrette is terrific. Will definitely make this again (and again and again...)

This was excellent. I used a bag of mixed salad greens that had a good combo of crunchy and leafy lettuces. I also increased the amount of hard boiled egg to 2 and substituted feta for the blue cheese. A really nice salad that my boyfriend had 3 servings of (this from the man who was quite unenthusiastic when I told him we were having salad for dinner!) Definitely will make this again. A classic.

I used 2 Cherokee Purple heirloom tomatoes -- I felt that one might have been lost. A great summer salad, although I found the dressing had too much oil and not enough kick. a pinch or two of cayenne pepper helped, but next time I will reduce the amount of olive oil.

Way too much work for the end result. Will make a simpler salad in the future.

Absolutely better than any restaurant..I made as directed, less bacon for my taste. Great for a warm evening with a nice glass of chilled local Sauvignon Blanc and Sourdough Bread

I followed this recipe loosely, using all romaine (which I had on hand) instead of the mix of lettuces, but adding all of the suggested toppings. I followed the dressing exactly and found it to be the best part of the recipe. Instead of the overly rich and creamy dressings often served with Cobb salad, this dressing is light yet satisfying, even when made with reduced fat blue cheese. I'll be making this dressing again!

great for a hot summer's day! I made it exactly as the recipe directed and here's what I would change: less dressing, less egg, more bacon. My familly thought it needed a little more crunch. Other than that, delightful!

Simply delicious! I did every step and it was great. I served it with garlic bread and a cream soup and everyone was so full.

I have made this several times and it is GREAT! The previous reviewer added NON- Cobb Salad ingredients and left out true Cobb Salad stuff. Stick to this recipe as is, it is wonderful and the dressing is perfect.

Made this salad last night for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I left out the endive, egg & chives but added a couple of variations: a can of drained corn (great for color), fresh salsa, bleu cheese instead of Roquefort in the dressing (less $$), plus lime slices for the guests to squeeze on top. Next time, I'll use 3-4 vine ripe tomatoes instead of just one. I served the salad with cucumber bisque and brownies for dessert. Delicious! Will definitely use this recipe again!

We make this all the time. How can you go wrong with bacon and avocados?! Yummy for summer.

I have not made this recipe yet, but I am a big fan of the Cobb Salad. Most restaurants serve the diced ingredients segmented on a bed of lettuce where the leaves are too large. I have had this salad at the Brown Derby and it is by far superior to any other that I have ever had! The absolute key to this recipe is dicing or shredding the lettuce and mixing well all the ingredients together, thus having each and every bite delicious. Granted, it can be time consuming to make unless of course you have a food processer. Give it a try......it is worth it!! Can't wait to make this one.

I have had this original recipe at the Brown Derby in Hollywood, it was served with toasted dark rye bread. Many restaurants try, but just don't get it right. Lettuce must be shredded or diced.

Unlike one of the previous reviewers, this California gal has Cobb Salad on a regular basis. Thus, I stayed with my own favorite combination of salad ingredients while trying your version of a dressing. It was great.

I've only had Cobb Salad once in my whole life, as I don't often see it on menus, so I was thrilled to find a recipe for this wonderful treat. I made a huge bowl and was actually wondering if I had made too much. About ten minutes later my question was answered as there was not one leaf left! I followed the recipe exactly and it certainly was as fantastic as I had remembered.
