Made with both prosciutto and pancetta and put it under the broiler since I don't have a grill - simple and fabulous!

I was unable to grill, so I oven roasted with sea salt, cracked pepper olive oil and slivers of pancetta - DELICIOUS......roasted for about 15 minutes and then served at room temperature. Really was a perfect side dish for Christmas Eve dinner. Before serving just splashed with alittle aged balsamic & EVOO. YUM, YUM, YUM.....

Exceptional appy. My guests raved about this. Definitely a keeper. To ensure that the asparagus would be fully cooked, I placed the prepared skewers in a tinfoil tent and allowed them to steam on the barbeque for about 10 minutes prior to grilling them.

Also works great with prosciutto like the previous reviewer suggested. I didn't have anything else on hand and it worked wonderfully on the grill

Incredibly quick and easy. However, my guests deemed the pancetta (the real deal, sliced transparently thin) too salty. They far preferred the ones wrapped in prosciutto, which I'd only used because I already had some in the 'fridge.

Wonderful and easy to make. I had the pancetta sliced alittle thicker than normal and wrapped it around bundles of 3 asparagus then sauteed it in a pan for a few minutes. Everyone loved it!

Thought this was great and so easy. Cut pancetta in half but I think I will try a whole slice and maybe thinner next time. Amazing! served with grilled pork chops with arugula salad.

AMAZING! This is so good. I cut the pancetta in half and oiled the asparagus after I wrapped it. I got a little nervous as I grilled it, because I had tripled the recipe and tried to cook it all at once. It was too much to manage and the oil and pancetta started causing flare ups, but I someohow managed to get it all cooked perfectly and my guests loved it. I served it with a baked ham, mashed potatoes, strawberry spinach salad and deviled eggs for our Easter dinner. Everyoen raved. I will definitly make this again.

Aside from any excuse for pancetta... Perfectly easy; perfectly healthy; rustically elegant. Always a bbq/grill favouite, and again this Easter. I like the suggestion below using three spears because we now get this lovely little bonsai-ed asparagus. A favourite.

WOW! How easy was this? OMG!! SUPER EASY! I added a splash of kosher salt to the pepper/oil. And it was so amazing that we can't wait to have dinner guests!

I made these with Thanksgiving dinner strangely and I think they were everyones favorite part of the meal. Next time I will use thinner pancetta though, mine was completely crispy. And also I made them under the broiler so a nice barbeque taste would probably make them even better.

1st blanch asparugs in boiling water 1 minute max then ice bath Pass on the skewers and wrap the sparagus in bundles of 3, tringles, then spiral wrap with prosuito. Pan sear in lightly oiled teflon pan until all 3 sides are crisp. Refridgerate 1 hour then top with a light semi sweet garlic dijon dressing served cold. Serve atop organice greens criss crossed and place bruschetta mixtture on plate at thick ends of asparagus for extra flavour and colour, They are a big mover at our restauarant. Note: u can also serve hot straight from pan hot still dressing and palting the same,

My Girlfriend and I used this recipie several times: 1) as a side dish it is great but works best (in my opinion) with grilled chicken dishes 2) we made this for bbq and it turned out awesome and was a great hit!

This recipe was delicious -- and much less work than I thought. I did them in the oven and they were still great.

Absolutely delicious, as an appetizer or with an entree such as braised lamb shanks with garlic and rosemary. But instead of wrapping more than one asparagus spear in a long slice of pancetta (or prosciutto) -- I just cut the pancetta slice in half per one spear.

I had to make this with proscuito, because we can't find sliced pancetta anywhere near us. And I put two asparagus spears in each proscuito slice instead of just one. It was pretty good, but the taste (and saltiness) of the proscuito overwhelmed the asparagus a little. We'll make it again, but maybe with less proscuito, or something.

These are very tasty! We did everything according to the recipe, with the exception of using a grill pan on the stove top and it turned out great!

I could only get cubed pancetta, so sauteed it with the asparagus (cut to 1") instead. The recipe still turns out very well this way even if it might be missing a little of the grill flavor.

This recipe was very good. We wrapped two spears of asparagus in one slice of pancetta. Will make again!

Buonissimi!! And so simple too. I found that the pancetta stuck to the asparagus w/o oil. I then rolled the completed spears in oil to coat, and broiled them in the oven for about 7 min, turning once. Served to a crowd of hungry Italians at my birthday party and almost missed a bite myself, they went so fast! An excellent appetizer.

This recipe rocks. I had some left over and it was still awesome three days later!!! Definitely a keeper! BTW, I soaked my skewers for over 30 mins and they still burned. Perhaps metal is the way to go?

I have been making this for a couple years, but I use proscuito and wrap 2-3 spears. First I bag the spears with olive oil, salt, chopped garlic and black papper. If you can't grill, you can seare in a frying pan. I will have to try with the pancetta.

Made this with proscuitto by mistake for a party this weekend. Everyone really enjoyed it.

Wow this is great! Love the salty crispy taste of the pancetta and the fresh tase of the asparagus. Used as apps with baked parmesan crisps. Deeelish!

This recipe is superb if you bundle 3 asparagus with a couple of pieces of thinly sliced pancetta. Just befor its done put a wegde of soft cheese like camenbere on top so it melts over the "wrap". Delicious.

It's impossible to wrap asparagus with thick pancetta. So, contrary to comment from an earlier reviewer, I recommend using thin-sliced pancetta.

A great recipe. When they are slicing your pancetta in the deli - tell them you are using it to wrap and then will grill it.....so it isn't to thin. I also wrapped two aspargus in one pancetta. Easy, looks great with a wonderful flavor combination.

Yum! Easy and delicious. Can't wait to make again.

This was my contribution to a Memorial Day barbecue and it was a smashing success. Amazingly simple, but deliscious. I've already two more times at home.
