What a waste of beautiful, fresh, crabmeat! Used extra lemon rind and juice, more pepper flake, white wine, etc. Bland, bland, blah!

Spaghettini with Crab and Spicy Lemon Sauce. Brian Hill. September 2007. I don't generally love anything with anchovies in them; I generally cook with them for my husband. But this recipe is wonderful.

We are Italian and therefore do a lot of pasta. We loved the lemon taste but the second time I made it I made a few changes suggested by others and added a few of my own. 1 lb of pasta, 6 tbsp oil, 4 cloves of garlic, can of anchovies in oil, 1/2 bottle of clam juice, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 1/3 cup lemon juice, l teaspoon fresh lemon zest, ground red pepper to taste. 1/2 Chopped cilantro, the meat from 2 dungeness crabs. I sauteed the garlic, red pepper and anchovies in oil, until light golden. Added clam juice, and wine. Simmer until thickened slightly, added lemon juice, zest and cilantro simmer a few more minutes. Mix 2/3 of sauce with al dente pasta including a little pasta water to moisten. Place serving on plate lay 6 blanched asparagus spears in a spoke pattern on top of pasta, drizzle with some reserved sauce and mound 1/4 of the crab on top. My family went absolutely nuts. Thanks for such a great recipe for me to expand upon.

Terrific! I followed the revised recipe that included clam juice and lemon juice. I too like 'spicey' and increased the crushed red pepper to a full teaspoon. In addition I added shitake mushrooms which added some nice earthiness. A non-oakey chardonnay makes for a wonderful pairing!

I agree with other reviewers - this recipe needed some tweaking. And, don't use canned crab with this -- save your canned crab for crabcakes. This recipe really calls for the fresh stuff.

I have to update this review because I keep making this recipe and it just gets better and better! Even friends who don't like anchovies or spicy stuff have loved this. I think the people who were disappointed might not have used the right crab meat. I live in the middle of nowhere in France so it's virtually impossible for me to get fresh crab meat, so I'm stuck using canned. However, I have discovered that there is a HUGE difference in quality from brand to brand. The best I have found over here is a brand called Nautilus which offers luscious whole chunks of crab meat, no cartilege or any of the fine shredded stuff. Now I even add a bit of the juice from the can to the saucepan! I made the mistake once of buying a cheaper can of shredded crab meat and it didn't have the same wonderful flavour, so make sure you really get the good stuff, it makes all the difference.

This was some of the best pasta I've had in ages. The lemon sauce is particularly refreshing. I did make a few, minor changes: 1) reduced amount of olive oil in half (in my opinion, most epicurious recipes call for way too much oil/fat for my taste/waistline. For this reason, I also did not put in the prosciutto. I also don't see that it would improve the flavour.); 2) upped the amount of red pepper flakes (pretty much doubled it as I like things spicy); 3) I didn't have anchovy paste so I mashed a few anchovy filets that had been cured in brine (but rinsed them first); 4) I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley, as I think it's a better match for both the lemon and crab. Delicious!!! However, I agree with another reviewer who said they didn't have enough sauce for 4. In my house, this was just enough for 2 adults.

This was awful. I was looking for an interesting way to use dungeness crab in a pasta dish and liked the lemon elements of this so I tried it. The anchovy paste blocked all other flavors. This was an awful waste of delicious crabmeat. Should have stuck with a basic olive oil/garlic sauce to let the dungeness shine through.

Thank you to daceyh from houston for the detailed revision. I had some leftover crab meat from New Year's crab legs and little else in the house to work with... and a craving for pasta. I used your revisions, well sort of...I didn't have clam juice or white wine, but used 1c. chix stock as a replacement a la the virginia beach comments. With the combo I used, I do think 1/3 cup is the max on lemon juice any more is too much. Oh, and I used about 1.5 tsp chili pepper paste in place of the dried pepper-- called "Gourmet Garden(R) Chili Pepper", it is a real handy thing to have in the fridge! I read another crab/pasta recipe after the fact on epi, they recommend tarragon--hmmm...I think that could work nicely in place of the basil. Definately will make it again, with the revisions already presented by previous commentors, and continued tweeking on my own!

I have fooled with this recipe since it came out, and while this revision is more revision than original recipe, it is a huge hit at my house, so I am passing it on. Saute 2 cloves pressed garlic in 4T olive oil. When garlic softens and turns golden, add 1 bottle clam juice, and 3/4 C dry white wine. Boil down to about 1/3 C. While this boils, add 10 thinly sliced sundried tomatoes, prosciutto, and 2-3 t anchovy paste. after this has reduced, add 1/3- 1/2 C lemon juice to taste and zest. Stir in pepper flakes and pasta and leftover pasta water if needed and 16 oz fresh lump crab meat. garnish with 1/4 C chopped basil and parmesan and fresh ground pepper.

Very bland as written. I added a tomato, chicken stock, and white wine for flavor, upped the garlic, as well as added some asparagus, and it turned out very well.

we thought this was quite good. fast and easy to make also. however, i cut about of pasta in half and upped garlic, anchovy paste and added tomatoes. also, i added a bottle of clam juice to olive oil mixture and boiled it down for a few minutes. i think that helped a lot in terms of added flavor, without fat/calories. its actually a very healthy dish.

I was not impressed at all with the end result. Very lackluster and not interesting at all. I would not recommend this recipe.

Recipe as written was good, really liked the lemon sauce but there wasn't enough sauce for 4 servings. I did add a ripe tomato, chopped finely along with the crabmeat, which added to the flavor. Would make again but would double the amount for creating the sauce.
