This is a quick dish that has some zip and makes a vegetable dish interesting. I will make it again. No need to grind the spices, put them all in together. I also added water chestnuts since my husband likes mushy veggies and I like a little texture. It works.

Nice, kicked up version of steamed broccoli. I did grind the red pepper but left rest whole.Very tasty with smoked chops and twiced baked stuffed taters.

This recipe was okay. Iserved it for Christmas dinner. I was looking for something different using broccoli. I would try again, but make modifications-more red pepper flakes, lemon, etc.

This has become a staple with us. Honestly, I usually don't bother with the grinding of the spices. I've tried it both ways and it makes no noticeable difference in flavor. Very fast, very easy, very tasty dish.

I have been making this for years--even before it appeared in Bon Appetit--it just seemed like a good combination to me and my husband likes it. I toast the sesame seeds. I drizzle olive oil (though you could sesame if you have it on hand) over the steamed broccoli, then sprinkle the red pepper flakes and sesame seeds tossing gently. It definitely perks up broccoli!

i varied the recipe by using fresh red bell pepper instead of dry. i sauteed a red onion in olive oil, and added the bell pepper, diced extremely fine. I then ground the sesame (I used black sesame seeds due to lack of the regular kind) in a mortar and pestle, and added it to the sauteeing onion and pepper, next adding the lightly steamed broccoli and butternut squash (as per the modification by another user). The end result was fantastic, and had an impromptu asian quality. I would definitely reccommend experimenting with this basic recipe, the results are delicious!

Although I didn't follow the recipe to a 'T', my variation was delicious and colorful! I was in the mood for broccoli & butternut squash together, so I varied this recipe. I caramelized a red onion in butter in an iron skillet, then added in cubed & lightly steamed squash and browned. Then came the lightly steamed broccoli followed by lots of grape tomatoes and the freshly ground sesame/red pepper seasoning from this recipe that I had doubled due to the increased mass of ingredients. It was a beautiful dish as well as delicious, and will definitely make it again. A dollop of sour cream was a nice addition, and the next time we'll try adding a touch of brown sugar. MMmmmm good!

It's good and easy!

We loved this! I used a mortar & pestle to grind the spices. We love sesame oil anyway, so combining it with the spices on otherwise-bland broccoli was delicious!

why bother grinding? Was nice and hot (hubby loved it). I thought it was too dry so added more oil at the end. Will not bother grinding next time and just toss.

Very easy. Nice, but not great.

We also split - I liked it (2 forks), my huband complained that it was chalky and that the sauce just sat on the broccoli. Not a stellar success, all in all.

This was a welcomed relief from lemon-butter broccoli (which is good, but I needed a different flavor). This dish can not be any easier to make and the red pepper lends a great, but subtle kick! YUM!

Great dish. And the seasoning is so good on other vegetables, too.

Wonderful recipe! The second time I made it, I made an extra container full of the spice mixture so I can use it as a quick addition to other veggie dishes.

This recipe makes it possible to eat broccoli. Amazing.

I also found this too salty - and I'm a big salt fan. My husband found it too spicy, but I didn't. The spice mixture is an easy way to add interest to broccoli, I'm wondering if anyone has tried it with other vegetables (I'm thinking of trying green beans). I used my mini-prep (small food processor) to grind the sesame seeds, salt & red pepper flakes without any problems.

EXCELLENT spice mixture. I've served it at two dinner parties to rave reviews. Great kick!

use a coffee grinder instead of a spice grinder.

To try to answer the question about lack of spice grinder: Try a mini-chopper such as the attachment for a hand blender, or a mortar and pestle if need be, or knife.

I'm curious, if you don't have a spice grinder, what would you use instead?

This was delicious and a great new way to serve broccoli. I appreciate how easy it was to put together while orchestrating a big meal. This was one of a few side dishes I made for a dinner of steak au poirve for the holidays, and my guests loved it. Not a flower left! One change I'd make: I found it a little too salty (the guests didn't say anything), so I'd cut back on the salt. Otherwise, a keeper!

I have fixed this dish several times and really like it but I don't grind the sesame seeds. I also like the sesame-red pepper mixture sprinkled over a green salad.

If only I could give this 2 separate ratings with one review. In short, I didn't care for this, I wouldn't make it again and would give it 1 fork. My husband did like it, and would give it 2.5 forks. I thought the sesame formed a chalky, powdery coating on the broccoli that was unpleasant. (yes, I toasted the seeds) He thought it was a nice change from plain steamed broccoli and liked the flavour of the sesame oil with the broccoli. So if you're considering this recipe, I would give it a try, it's simple and cheap and it wasn't inedible so even if you don't love it, you'll still be able to eat it and not throw it out.

So good! I cut way back on the salt and threw the sesame seeds, oil, and spices together all at once, but it was still fabulous...and I even made it ahead (doubled to serve 10) and served it at room temperature. A great way to spice up steamed broccoli--better to undercook a little for the crunch.

This was a different way to spice up broccoli. It was great and really easy. This is a make again!!

This is a great way to spice up broccoli. It's a really nice side for chicken and fish. This is a great way to get your kids to eat broccoli. The kids loved it (minus the crushed red pepper)!
