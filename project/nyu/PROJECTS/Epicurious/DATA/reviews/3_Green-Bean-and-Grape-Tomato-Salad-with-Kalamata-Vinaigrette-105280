Was OK with some modification. After reading some of the reviews it was clear that there was way too much dressing, so I made just half the recipe, and still decreased the olive oil by a bit. I had no anchovy paste, so I added 4 small canned (rinsed) anchovies to the puree. Also, I wasn't thrilled about having a dark puree, so I pureed only half the olives, and added the rest minced at the end. I used more than 1 tsp of fresh thyme, and 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper. I substituted 1 tsp of dry mustard for the dijon. I used chunks of beefsteak tomato instead of grape tomatoes. It was good, but not fabulous. Still a little bland. Feta and/or garlic would probably improve it.

A couple hours after I made it, I thought eh... but a day later I ate almost all of it in one sitting. The anchovy paste begins to match the kalamata flavor after it sits for awhile. I think some edible flowers, such as Nasturtium, could mask the unappealing visual- the purple olive past obscures the bright red and green of the seasonal veggies.

I used about 3/4 of one shallot. I made the dressing the day before, and let it stand over night, then re-whisked, and used a little less than half on the beans and tomatoes. Mine looked as pretty as the salad in the picture, and the dressing worked with the beans instead of overpowering them like some people said. Wasn't my favorite part of the picnic, but I'd make it again when I want to jazz up a cold green bean salad.

I made this for a potluck, and followed the recipe, except I replaced the anchovy paste with capers, as one guest was vegetarian. It was excellent, and I was asked for the recipe by 3 different people. All leftovers were claimed and taken home! This recipe is for olive lovers only - and good olives should be used (not canned or bottled) for the best flavour.

This was okay, but something about it was a little overpowering. Won't make again, at least not with this exact combination. (To be fair, I didn't use anchovy paste and I don't know how much that would change the outcome.)

I just made it and it tastes excellent. I did add a little honey to sweeten it up and cut some of the bitterness from the lemon juice.

Made it yesterday and served it today for a brunch. I agree with previous comments: there is too much dressing but as it is delicious and can be used with any salad, who would complain? The salad was a success and I will do it again. I had made one small change: I replaced the cherry tomatoes by a tomato preserve I had made this fall. For those who speak french, the preserve can be found at: http://aladistasio.telequebec.tv , look for: Tomates Cerises Marinées en Bocaux.

This was easy and delicious. Even my 5 and 3 year old gobbled it up!

The recipe made a ton dressing and after using the dressing on other things, I am amending my review. The dressing is very refreshing and goes well on steamed vegetables and any salad.

I made it with yellow and green beans to make it more colorful, however the dressing camouflages the color anyway. I dressed the salad right before serving. If I did it again with would let it sit over night because the leftovers were better after the dressng soaked in.

I've reviewed this before but the more I use it and find how versatile it is, the more I want to up the rating from three forks to four. The dressing is a nice dip for crudites and is wonderful over hot broccoli.

Rating: 2
Despite the two fork rating, I might actually try this again but only with some doctoring. I found the sauce too light and a bit bland. It seems to have a lot of potential but is missing something. I might add some cubed fresh mozzarella or even feta next time and cut back on the lemon / lemon zest a bit.

Still a hit after all these years! I make this dish for Easter in years past and wasn't going to make it this year as I thought my friends and family were getting tired of it. However, I had several people call up just to remind me/ask me to bring it again. It's a great dish for spring. The flavors and ingredients are so fresh.

My guests & I enjoyed this salad very much, although I only used 3/4 of the dressing, after reading the reviews of others (thank you). In addition, I added thinly sliced red onion & some sliced Kalamata olives. Also, I microwaved the green beans, which was far easier than blanching or steaming.

Rating: 3
Very unusual, very good. I followed the recipe exactly and then topped the salad with crumbled feta cheese, and my family loved it.

Rating: 3
This is a really excellent recipe if you like kalamata olives and anchovies and similar strong flavors-if you don't like them, try something else! The green beans stay crisp and colorful when you prepare as directed and dress them right before serving. There's plenty more dressing than you need so add it to the vegetables with restraint and enjoy the leftovers on another salad.

I used this recipe only for the vinaigrette, which was delicious. Well, no, I used basil instead of thyme, and I didn't use the anchovy paste, so it's up to you whether to determine how useful my review is. However, I put the (modified) dressing onto tomatoes, added red onion, more of the olives, feta cheese, and a handful of mint, and the salad was quite good. The dish was well received, and someone asked to take extra home. I also didn't use all of the dressing - just enough to coat nicely, but not drown.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. Definitely need less dressing than set forth in recipe. Very tangy and refreshing. Works since it is a puree even if you don't love olives.

This recipe was a big hit both in our family and for entertaining. I was surprised at the negative reviews. Why would anyone try this if they did not like olives??!! As with any salad recipe, dressing should be added with restraint and to taste. This salad is unique and delicious.

This dish turned out very well for me. I don't like olives so I did not use those--I did use lots of crumbled feta, less olive oil and more lemon juice. Omitted the anchovy paste too, and let it all marinate for awhile. It was a big hit at the picinic!

Rating: 4
Excellent. Made it for a dinner, gave ample leftovers (I made way too much) to daughter who took to picnic next day after it was chilled overnight. She said it made it even better. It was a huge hit at the picnic and added "by demand" to the standing picnic menu.

I guess I am not a fan of, or used to, Kalamata Vinaigrette. Did not like it. The tomato and green & yellow bean salad combination was great. I will use a different vinaigrette when I use those two salad ingredients again. It looked so good and was so seasonal that I had to try it though.

I made this dressing in a blender and it emerged as a bitter paste. I saved it by adding a tablespoon of sugar, a shot of sherry vinegar, and a good dose of salt. Next time, I would simply whisk the dressing, cutting back on the shallots and the dijon mustard, and tasting as you go. I cut the beans realatively small, then added sliced mushrooms and allowed the "salad" to marinate overnight before adding the tomatoes. I then used the salad as a bed for sliced duck breast and served it as a nice, largely do-ahead, first course at a dinner party. In general, a nice presentationt that takes advantage of in-season produce -- but make your own vinegrette.

Agreed: 2x too much dressing, and the flavor isn't as satisfying as I expected it would be. A little tart and less savory than kalamatas and anchovy paste might suggest. I kept leftovers and ate several days later, fully cold, with our fingers, as we cooked salmon for dinner. Beans kept their color as I prepared them in bamboo steamer, skipped the shallots, threw in some different olives (from a deli-bought country olive mix), and would revisit this recipe if found myself tired of green beans the same old way.

I guess I should have know better than to make this dish. I don't like kalamata olives, but tried it anyway. Very odd tasting and looking.

The dressing was a little too tart.

It is true--there is way too much vinaigrette for this recipe. I used half of it and it was plenty. Also, using half, I did not have the problem other reviewers mentioned with graying of the beans and tomatoes. My dish looked just as beautiful as the picture, and my guests were quite impressed with its appearance and flavor. Also, make sure to put the dressing on at the last minute--don't let it marinate the veggies or that will also cause discoloration. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

was looking for a recipe to help w/ the abundance of green beans my garden produced this year, so i gave this a try. i was pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the flavor, thought the anchovy and olives would be stronger. the dressing recipe could easily be halved...if i used it all the veggies would have been swimming!

Rating: 3
This was pretty good, but i agree, when i added the vinaigrette, the bright colors of the vegetables turned dark and gray. i put some toasted pine nuts in to add a little crunch. I received good reviews but it made bad leftovers the following day.

I have made this two times and received rave reviews. I did not use the olives as am not an olive fan and it was terrific without it!

Blech. This looked so striking in the magazine with the bright green and red. However, when I added the vinagrette it turned it a purplish/gray. The vinagrette was just not appealing at all. The flavor was too heavy w/the olives. I would advise to make a small version for yourself before serving it to your guests.

I made this for the 4th of July and everyone thought it was delicious! I didn't use nearly all of the vinaigrette, and the leftover dressing was delicious on other salads and vegetable combinations.

This is a delicious, new and refreshing green bean salad. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry because I prefer them. I served guests at an outdoor dinner party and received many, many compliments for the dish.
