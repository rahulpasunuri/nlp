I've made these cookies for the last 5 years running. I've never had any issues with the dough being too crumbly or with very much spreading when baking. I do find that kneading the dough and folding in any errant bits or flour in the bottom helps. Not sure what happened with some of the commenters. They are indeed fussy cookies but they are much beloved by my family. If I pick one cookie to make for the holidays it's these or the triple gingers. I usually alternate between a variety of jams like strawberry, cherry, lemon curd, apricot, marmalade.

The cookies turned out great. I made them as singles as they are easier for the kids to eat and they can eat different flavors. Recipie is easy to follow.

I love these cookies. I usually make them as singles, but they are a terrific cookie either way. Two tips I read here that I have found useful: try Nutella in the middle (my kids love that); and to bake them with the indentation for half the time, pull them out, re-dent and add the jam at that point. It really helps keep the cookies looking pretty. Don't overwork the dough. It's easier to work with if it is not too cold.

These have become one of my go-tos for when I want to impress. They come out beautifully, but can be a bit challenging. The dough, when made properly, can be a bit on the crumbly side, making the assembly part difficult. I find that using an electric mixer is not the best route with these-I use the mixer up until the adding of the flour, and then once the consistency gets thick, I use my hands to kneed the dough together-more like a bread almost. I have found that NOT chilling the dough makes these easier to make. I roll small balls of dough in my hands for long enough that the dough is slightly warm and pliable. Then I construct the "triangles" and use the blunt end of a wooden spoon to make the indention. I don't smush the dough balls, they seem to flatten well enough just in the baking, and this way the jam doesn't spill out. I also only cook for about 12 mins so they don't end up over dry. These have ALWAYS been a huge hit-I have even sent them to a friend serving in Afghanistan, they traveled well and were tasty, I'm told.

These cookies were a major flop. I made them according to the recipe and chilled the dough overnight. In spite of all this, when I popped them in the oven they spread out over the baking sheet into buttery puddles with bits of jam floating in the middle.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I did do things a little differently than the directions, since I've had problems with thumbprint-style cookies before. I constructed the triangles, flattened and gouged, then baked them for 7 minutes, rotated the pan, then for 7 more minutes, then took them out and gouged them again with the spoon handle, dabbed the jam in the depressions and put the whole mess back in the oven for 3 more minutes. This way the jam melted enough to set, but didn't run over. I'm really pleased with how they turned out. Since I'm making them for Christmas I divided the dough into 3 sections and tinted 1 red and 1 green. Great recipe!

These are so pretty. I used red raspberry and apricot jam and made them singles, not trios. They added color to the Xmas cookie box that I sent my family members all over the U.S.

I think the dough was too cakey and a little tough. I'd re-use the trio concept, but with a different cookie dough. It was also a little tough to prevent jam spillage, they weren't as pretty as in the picture, but they do look pretty neat.

Just made these and while they take a bit of time, the final effect is well worth it. A light, buttery cookie with the jams of your choice, and they look great. I subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and used organic cane sugar to great results.

easy recipe. not a big jam fan, but enjoyed this cookie. made half trios (one flavor per trio) and half singlets. the singlets were a lot prettier and will be easy to pack. will make again if only because they aren't too personally tempting!

Great, easy cookie! This is the first time I've made them, so I did single cookie sheet batches to figure out what works best. First off, working with chilled dough is a lot easier to work with while rolling, flattening, and making the indentation. Instead of flattening each rolled dough ball with my hand, I used my cutting board to flatten it for more uniform circles. Also, don't be tempted to add more jam/preserves after you see what your first batch looks like. After baking, the jam has condensed and basically sticks to the walls of the indentation--it doesn't necessarily look "filled." Using more than 1/8t will result in a slight overflow with irregular shaped jam circles. It just looks much prettier with only the 1/8t. As far as taste goes, they are absolutely delicious. I didn't think the small amount of jam would work, but it adds just enough fruity flavor to the cookie. The only downside is how tedious it is assembling the cookies. However, it is worth the effort!

My daughter made these for us when she was 9 and has continued every year since. A great cookie to impress the relatives if you are small and fun to make with the children.

Once baked, I used a light dusting of powdered sugar to cover up any spillage of jam. Delicious!

Loved these! They come out great if you roll the dough into marble size balls before assembling into triangles. I also used a very light dusting of powdered sugar to cover up some of the filling spill over after they were baked. So pretty and festive!

Just made this for the first time and it rocks. Halved the recipe and made exactly 22 cookies. Needed all of the 20 minutes to bake, but stuck enough to the sheet I'll line it next time. It was a pain of a process, but tasty and attractive enough to suffer. I noticed a few of the last cookies to go down spread, but I think that's because by the time I got to sculpting the last of the dough, the dough had warmed too much. Will refrigerate the dough in batches next time to keep the dough cooler while I'm working.

I made these cookies tonight in preparation for Christmas. My husband gave me some great advice that turned out very well. To make the preserves/spreads more festive, we added 3-4 drops of red food coloring into the blackberry and cherry spreads, and 3-4 drops of green food coloring into the apricot. If I were making these cookies for any other holiday, I wouldn't do it, but for Christmas, the enhanced colors look fabulous. We also added some lemon juice to the preserves to bring out more tang as an offset to the sweet cookies. They taste marvelous - light, slightly crunchy and just sweet enough.

This Thanksgiving, I was looking for an additional, alternative to pumpkin pie. I wanted to make blueberry tarts, but I don't make good piecrust. I thought of these cookies, and wondered if they would make a good piecrust alternative. I used a muffin tin, and hand patted the dough flat, and fitted it into the cups. (I didn't grease the pan beforehand, thinking there was enough butter to take care of it) I spooned blueberry pie filling into the cups. I baked them until the "crust" was lightly browned and let them cool in the cups. A knife slid down the side and a slight turn of the tart, and they lifted right out. The only sticking problems I had was on the couple where the crust was thinner on the bottom. (Greasing the pans may help in this regard). My family loved them - even my pumpkin-pie loving husband commented on how good they were.

Rating: 3
Good holiday cookie recipe that is fun to do and very festive looking. Be careful not to overfill the cookies with jam, as it will run over once they bake and ruin the look of the cookies. Also, look for smoother jams for easier filling. The level of tastiness depends on making the cookies a little bit on the bigger side, using high-quality jams, and being careful not to over-bake.

these cookies were kind of a pain. i am a perfectionist about how my cookies look, and these just kept spreading. they taste great, but sort of look unappetizing. i tried different temperatures with the butter, adding cake flour, and just about any technique to stop the spread of the cookies, but to no avail. boo.

I made this Recipe for the Virgin of Guadalupe procession in our town. It is always a long cold walk and after there is always plenty of hot cocoa, coffee and Cider. I made this early in the day and put them into a big cookie bag which I Carried in my purse during the walk. My husband who had seen my sneak the cookies into my purse got hungry during the walk and asked me to sneak him a few. Well... my mom and dad soon caught on and wanted a try as well and soon we were handing cookies out left and right. Everyone LOVED THEM and were really loving the "TRIO" aspect. But the best compliment came from my Husband who begged me to make more of the delicious cookies the next day!

I've made these cookies two years in a row now, and this Christmas the first batch went so fast with all the cookies we gave away I had to make a second. I, too, had the problem of the jam boiling out of the depressions from last year's batch and this year's first batch and also having unevenly (but tasty nonetheless) shaped rounds. . . not so the second batch I made this season. What I did differently was that I only refrigerated the dough for probably about a half hour, and used a level teaspoon as per the recipe. I was a bit distracted by watching a movie with my sister while making them, and so after rolling them into perfect little marblesque balls, I failed to flatten them before using the end of a wooden spoon (about 1/2" in diameter) dipped in flour. They ended up with nice, deep pockets that could have taken a smidge more than 1/8 tsp filling. They flattened out a bit while baking, and I daresay they were just as beautiful, if not more-so, than the ones pictured here. I have noted on my printed copy of this recipe to NOT use dough that is too chilled as sometimes the colder dough would crack nor to flatten balls before making depressions. I also used lemon curd as one of the fillings (along with black heart cherry and blackberry) and it was a winning combination. The other half of the batch was raspberry, lingonberry, and rhubarb--also very good.

I made an assortment of cookies from the "25 Days of Christmas Cookies" on epicurious.com and this will definately make it on the list for next year. I also tried them dipped in sugar before filling with jam, but I really preferred the original. It is very easy to make the balls too big, even when you think you are being stingy. I made the balls about the size of a dime, or nickel when flattened a touch. Then I made the indent with my finger tip, pushing down in a small circle (to make it a little bigger). They turned out just as the picture shows!

Made these 2 years in a row for the holidays. They're so beautiful in the end - despite all the work it takes. I always start off making them too big, and they work much better when they're small. I also use whatever jams/preserves I have on hand. This year I used a homemade "seedful" blackberry jam and they still turned out well.

The taste was good, but I found that,as happened to an earlier reviewer, the jam boiled out of the cookies. They were not worth the time it took to make them, though I like the dough recipe.

These cookies are beautiful and make a great presentation. I took a suggestion from a previous review and made half inch balls (or a little smaller). I added finely chopped pecans for taste and texture. Not a recipe to take on if you don't have time.

These looked so beautiful when I put them in the oven, but then when I took them out the bottoms were burned, the jelly had sunk and/or bubbled over, and needless to say they looked nothing like the picture. At the suggestion of others below, and so that I could make more than just a dozen, I used a half (instead of a whole) teaspoon to make the balls. That probably means I should have checked on them around 10 minutes, but by 13 they were in the present state. And b/c they were smaller, I feel like I probably used less jam than the original called for, so I'm confused as to how it wouldn't bubble over in the bigger version...sigh. Oh well.

This was an easy recipe. The cookies are attractive and added color to the plates of cookies I am giving as "gifts". They taste pretty good too.

The cookies came out just fine, and look very pretty. For all of the extra work creating "trios", it's not worth the effort. They taste just like sugar cookies with jam filling. After a couple of batches of "trio", I made a sheet of singles, and it was much faster. Only downside to that is that you don't get three different jam flavors in one cookie, and it's not so fancy-looking. Don't make these if you're in a pinch for time. If you want an elegant slant on a sugar cookie, and you have time, this is your recipe!

Delishious - someone made them for me as a birthday gift last year and they were wonderful, so I thought I would give them a try this year for Christmas cookies. I made them in a gigantic version with homemade jam, and they turned out beautifully and lasted about three seconds before being gobbled up by the children running around. yum!

These cookies came out fantastic!!! Took them to a party and everyone commented that they looked like jewels and said they tasted amazing. :) The only thing I would say is that when making them the dough shouldn't be too cold otherwise the cookies will crack when you make your indention. If the dough seems too hard when you take it out of the fridge, let it sit out for a bit.

These are lovely little cookies! Very pretty. I made them for a cookie drive, and they were the Belle of the Ball! I made them much smaller (which was a good size) and yielded over 6 dozen! Used a 1/2tsp like an ice cream scoop on the chilled dough. To keep the consistency the same, scoop out 45 chunks of dough (and put the rest back in the fridge), then roll into marble-sized balls, and press them onto the parchment in threes. As long as they are touching, they will adhere. Getting the jelly into the holes was easy using a tiny (espresso) spoon and a sharp tipped knife. Will do these again.

These cookies are excellent. The jam in the middle doesn't get leathery or tough after being baked. It took me a test tray of them to figure out exactly how far apart to place them so that they bake up as in the picture. Next time, I think I'll roll the balls of dough in sugar before pressing them down and filling them; I think a crunchy, sugar crust would go perfectly with this buttery, melting cookie.

A very fun cookie to make. I found it was easier to work with the dough if it was slightly warmer. It tends to crack when it's too cold as you're putting the indentions in. I did have one batch that spread too much because I used too much dough. I think the trick is to be very stingy on the dough, keep them small, and make a really nice deep impression for your jam. (I used my ring finger because my nail broke earlier in the day!) I used blueberry, raspberry and apricot. Gorgeous cookies.

I love this cookie. I made it similar to my grandma's recipe by adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Mine spread way too much and didn't look like the pic, so I mostly made them singles - I made them much smaller than I usually do but I have to say the bite-size ones are too addictive...

These are very good. I made them as single thumbprints, and because I don't like the leathery texture of jam that's baked with the cookies, I added the jam after the cookies came out of the oven. I used a nice tart homemade jam of raspberries, cherries, currants, and strawberries, boiled the jam for a few minutes until it was a bit thick and sticky, and filled the thumprints. The cookies are prettier this way because the filling isn't shrunken but nice and rounded. It took an entire pint of jam for this number of cookies, which gives the cookies a more intense jam flavor.

These were a huge hit with my family. I made them exactly as the directions stated and they turned out well. I might refrigerate them a bit before baking next time because the dough softens since the assembly of the cookies takes awhile. Mine did spread more than the picture, but tasted great. On a side note, it was humorous to get directions on using 1/88 t of preserves...I couldn't find that measuring spoon :)

I loved this recipe. I didn't think that it was lacking in the taste department. I told my boyfriend on his way home that I was making cookies. When he got home, he was disappointed that they were not the standard chocolate chip, but he ended up loving them. My cookies didn't turn out as pretty as the picture because they cracked and were not nice, perfect little circles, but they still looked pretty. My dough got a bit soft and started to run and it made a flatter, less shapely cookie. So I would suggest keeping the dough cool, working in batches, and maybe even chilling the baking sheets. The jams get hard and chewy after a few days (like the junk you buy in the grocery store), so I would suggest making these when you know you'll have enough people around to eat them.

Let me start by saying, these cookies are some of the most visually pleasing cookies I have ever made. I do agree that they are time consuming, but the finished presentation is worth it. Definitely use premium jams as they tend to pack more flavor.

I made two batches of these cookies and I thought they were great. I didn't agree that they took too long to assemble,at least not more time then any then any other cookie recipe out there(I did make them as singles to save time). They were soft and had a really good traditional shortbread taste. One tip to get them to look even and pretty is to roll the dough into balls of the same size between your hands and place on the cookie sheet (I've worked in a bakery for years and that is how we do it). Then put the "thumb print" in them. I brought them to work and everyone loved them!

These are fantastic little cookies. Here's a tip for saving a lot of time. Instead of measuring out teaspoon after teaspoon of dough, measure out one teaspoon of dough so you know how big that should be. Then roll out the dough into logs that are about 1/2-3/4" in diameter. Then slice the dough so it's the right size for a teaspoon. This saves a lot of time!

Great recipe, I only made half the amount, which worked great, and now I need to make more!! I made it a little easier by putting only two cookies together. And I rolled portions of the dough into little snakes, cut it into pieces and shaped hazelnut-sized ball.
