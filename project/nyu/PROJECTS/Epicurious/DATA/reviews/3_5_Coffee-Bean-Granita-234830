This was very good and simple although it was a little time consuming to stir every 45 minutes for 5 hours. Served it with a scoop of fresh whipped cream and mint leaves and Baked Bananas on the side.

Delicious and easy. Used decaf beans as was serving this late at night and was fine. Made half the recipe which barely served five, but left Kahlua at 1/4 cup and it was yum. Served with wet, very slightly sweetened whipped cream with a mint leaf on top in a drinking glass. Pretty and mint fragrance brought it all together! Making again tonight.

Super simple recipe that makes enough to serve an army. Loved the coffee flavor, but upon the advice of a previous reviewer, I used Baileys instead of coffee liqueur, and didn't like the flavor it imparted. I'll definitely make this again, but next time I'll stick to the recipe.

This was very simple and tasty. We had it with the chocolate custard, but there were leftovers that we served with Baileys Liquor poured overtop.

This granita was wonderful! I didn't have kahlua, so I put a little Bailey's Irish Cream in, and it was delicious. I served it in martini glasses with fresh whipped cream that was also laced with a little Bailey's. My guests, who have traveled the world by restaurants, raved.
