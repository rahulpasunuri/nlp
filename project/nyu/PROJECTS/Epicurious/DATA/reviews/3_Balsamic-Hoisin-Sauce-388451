Maybe not amazing, but still pretty good and gets bonus points for the fact that you probably have everything in the pantry already. I made this as part of a trio of asian-ish wing sauces. It wasn't THE sauce of the night, but it was well received. Worth trying once at least, as I think many people would really like.
