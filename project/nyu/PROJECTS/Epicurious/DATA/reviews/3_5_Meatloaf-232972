Best meatloaf ever, probably because of the soy sauce and a few changes I made. Instead of cooked oatmeal I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs. And instead of raw onion, I sauteed the onion with about eight chopped button mushrooms, along with the garlic and thyme. I added the sauteed vegetables to the meat/egg mixture just before mixing it all together and forming into the loaf. I didn't have chili sauce so used ketchup instead. And I made it last night and served it tonight, so I think that made it even better.

We've made this meatloaf many times. From the beginning I misread the recipe and only used one pound of gr. beef while keeping the other amounts the same. It was a little less loaf-like than other meatloaves I've had, but my husband loved the flavor. We tried doing it 'right' and realized we like it better the other way. SO, we now make this every time with a pound less meat. We have learned though, to use less soy sauce to cut down on saltiness when we use less meat. In all, this is our meatloaf winner.

First of all, let me start by saying I am a meatloaf fan. I like trying different recipes and the first time I make a recipe I try to stick as close as possible, if not exactly, to the recipe, otherwise how can I possibly critique it adequately? That being said, I only gave this 3 forks because I think it lacked something. I was skeptical about the cooked oatmeal, since I usually use bread crumbs, but used 1 cup of Quaker's Old Fashioned Oats. I also used good, old traditional Heinz Chili Sauce. The texture was good, the loaf held together well, but the flavor...can't put my finger on it but it might be the soy sauce. Anyway, it's not as good as Emeril Lagasse's Mighty Meaty Meatloaf. And if you want to cut down on calories, I agree with other reviewer that the ground turkey and zucchini meatloaf is awesome.

Surprisingly, neither my boyfriend nor I had ever made meatloaf before, so we tried this last night. It turned out pretty super amazing despite a screw-up. We didnt have oatmeal, so we used a cheese grater to break up some stale italian bread we had. We substituted some basil for the parsley. And we didnt have chili sauce, so we used .5 cup Brown Sugar, .25 cup Vinegar, 1 tsp dry mustard, and .5 tsp of paprika for the sauce. My boyfriend forgot the sauce goes on _top_ so he accidentally mixed it in with the meat. We cooked it that way regardless. Turned out fantastic, really. It still had a 'crust' as well. The brown sugar carmelized but the texture turned out great. When we make this again, which we will, the only thing I would change is to add more garlic. We are still shocked at how good this was.

I doubled-down on the garlic and was lucky enough to have my wife's cooked oats handy (she uses Bob's Red Mill extra thick cooked with milk). For the chili sauce I mixed some plum sauce with Thai pepper sauce and ketchup.

Forgot to rate my previous review. Also, I used steel cut oats. Much nicer texture than regular old fashioned oats.

Delicious meatloaf. Very moist. Thyme is overwhelming. Would recommend not using it at all. Used regular ketchup instead of chili sauce (very vague... this could mean many things!). Also threw in an extra tsp of garlic.

This is a complete winner with my family, even with my 3 year old. I have done it several times... I have tried it with the sweet chili sauce and with my own sauce (mix of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar) and have to say that I prefer it with mine, the sweet chili sauce dried up in the oven.

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe said and although the flavor was good the texture was like canned dog food--mushy, flabby, just horrid. I'd never used COOKED oatmeal in a meatloaf recipe before & thought it was a little weird, now I know it was a bad idea. It probably should have said quick-cooking oatmeal!

This is a winner. Don't change anything. how can you write a review on a recipe you have changed? Reader keep that in mind.

I made this recipe exactly as it states and it is superb! The only difference Is I did not have chili sauce so I used ketchup, some hot sauce, some brown sugar and vinegar, to make a chili sauce...and sauteed the onion and garlic a little prior to bring out the flavors before adding. My mother used to make meatloaf with oatmeal and I did not have her recipe so I made this one. Even better than Mom's. My husband, kids and I loved it! Those of you who substituted breadcrumbs are missing out.

This was my first time making a meatloaf and it came out great! I subbed bread crumbs because I didn't have oatmeal and also used worcestershire, otherwise made it as written. Plenty of flavor from the chili sauce and it was nice and moist. Will make again!

Rating: 4
I think that most people have some meatloaf preferences. I basically made the recipe as is but used bread crumbs instead of oatmeal and worcestershire instead of soya. The topping though is one that my mom used to use. Ketchup mixed with Keens dry mustard and brown sugar. It is a nice compliment to the salty meat.

i dunno--i am a reasonably competent cook, but cannot figure meatloaf out. i followed this recipe with no alterations and was disappointed. i did use all beef (locally-raised natural) and the flavor was OK, but all of my meatloaf attempts just seem like big hamburger logs with too rough a texture. i guess i'll leave the meatloafing to my husband who seems to have a feel for it.

Just made this for my family this weekend. Read all the reviews, and revised the recipe this way: -Used not quite two pounds of high-quality ground beef -Added 5-6 baby bella mushrooms, finely chopped -Replaced half the soy with worcestershire sauce -Added 1 packet of dry onion soup mix -Replaced the parsley with cilantro, because that's what I had -Mixed homemade chili sauce with a couple of tablespoon of ketchup for topping My family, including my two year old, loved it! Said that the leftovers the second day were even better. Of course, a big part of it was probably the homemade chili sauce!

So good! My grocery store didn't have the meatloaf mix prepared so I bought a pound of ground turkey and a pound of lamb, and it worked just fine. The best meatloaf I've ever made.

Another review said not to use Shiracha. Maybe try Heinz Chili Sauce instead. Plain American ketchup worked well here and counteracted the soy to reduce the salty flavor. I didn't cook the oats, and it bound just fine, with the oats absorbing the flavor of the beef instead. My family loved it.

Rating: 4
It was good. Except next time I won't use Shiracha for the chili sauce. I'll probably substitute ketchup or some mild BBQ sauce. Rooster sauce... way too spicy.

Rating: 2
Just okay, the soy sauce seemed to make it a little too salty for us. I also think the cooked oatmeal caused it not to hold together as well as others fillers. Will make some changes and try again.

I had two friends over for dinner who, before this meal, thought meatloaf was one of those horrible dishes their parents tried to force on them as a kid...but they gobbled it down, even mentioning it to others at the party we went to after. A repeat, for sure.

Very good recipe. Tasty, but not too spicy. I used all beef. My family requests this meatloaf.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I made it with ground beef and pork and used torn bread pieces instead of oatmeal. I thought the chili sauce added an interesting flavor and would increase the amount next time. I would also grate the onion instead of chopping it to add moisture and would also add cottage cheese to make it even more moist. This is a solidly good meatloaf recipe.

A question.....when I read the first review on this meatloaf I was immediately curious about the Turkey meatloaf with the shredded zucchini that was mentioned. I searched it and could not find it...only three recipes came up, none of which had zucchini....help??

All meatloafs (-loaves??) are not created equal, as those of us who enjoy them know quite well. Personally, I can happily enjoy a mundane recipe, and this is slightly above that, especially using soy sauce, which was new for me. The first oatmeal-based recipe originated with Quaker -- Rick Nichols of the Philly Inquirer did an article on this last year. It does add nutrients, fiber, and flavor. One of life's great joys is a leftover meatloaf sandwich!!! However, in my personal (30-years-of-testing) Pantheon of Superior Meat Loaf Recipes, the top winner is the Turkey Meatloaf (the one w/ shredded zucchini) on this site, which is very similar to Ina Garten's, only better-- check it out, it has loads of reviews. I agree with a prior reviewer who mentioned Lish Neeson's (sp?), also here. My 3rd would be one I clipped from LHJ back in the 80's. As for the rest of the commentary, my great-grandmother used to say, "Let fools talk."

I could only get a one pound pkg of veal at my grocery store so went with one pound veal and one pound pork. What the heck! It turned out great! I used old fashioned mother's oats (all I had)and microwaved the oats for 1.5 mins on high to cook them. The rest came together splendidly and was delicious. Good texture and held together well.

A good basic mix to personalize and make ones own. I find the display of food snobbery on these message boards fascinating. If a person can display so much passion over a meatloaf, I can't imagine how they conduct themselves when discussing something really important. Yikes!

Yes . . . of course Meat Loaf is boring. For someone to take offense to that remark is actually pretty funny. To think it's "exciting" is delusional. But meat Loaf is like "casserole," or "stew" . . . boring, but there's nothing wrong with these comfort foods once-in-awhile. Lighten-up, meat-loaf junkies!

I find this meat loaf recipe wonderful and I would like to declare that the very insensitive remake of Legend55 calling it BORING was indeed uncalled for. If she did not like the recipe she should have just said "it's not to my liking" and left it at that. My sweet departed mother would chime this worthy phrase "if you cant say something nice about a person or their recipe you should not say anything at all" this is also very good advice for posters (chefmb from Mesquite, Texas) and (A Cook on 10/28/05 ) who's comments here I find equally as BORING. If my dear heart Mom were still alive she would say "I wish those two old ladies would just mind the own business" Imagine the two of them never mentioning the meat loaf recipe but found joy in chastising other posters. Shame on them. I am Dorothy Follingsworth .......

a meat loaf is a meat loaf, i can't understand all these arguments around it. from my experinence it all about quality beef you are using, the rest of ingridiants, is up to your own taste and likes and that's very much like anything else in life....

I would like to echo the cook who posted a message on 10/28/05...individual and personal attacks have ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS ON WEB SITES SUCH AS THIS. If you do share someone's else's opinion, that is okay. However, it NOT okay to insult another person. Perhaps we should all remember the Golden Rule, 'Do unto others as you would have them do to you.' We all have different tastes, likes and dislikes, which is one reason we visit web sites such as this. That is the point of reviewing a recipe. It causes one to wonder what the culinary skills of fpczyz in California might be since this individual attacked the culinary skills of legend55. There is an old adage that says something to the effect that the traits we least like in someone else are also the traits with which we have the most trouble in ourselves. If fpczyz in California believes that legend55's skills might be lacking, then perhaps the same could be said of fpczyz in California. Think about this and keep personal attacks to oneself and completely out of forums such as this.

Instead of Chilli Sauce, try drained Salsa or a drained can of Rotel tomatoes with chilli's for the topping...I also add a little to the meat mix itself...Save the liquid to use at a later date, or freeze for another use, too good to throw away

Recipe sounds Boring. 2:1:1 Mix is the way I make my meatloaf. I add 8 Saltines and 1/2 cup UNCOOKED regular oatmeal with 2 tbs worchestershire, 1/4 cup ketchup and 2 tbs A1 gives it a bolder flavor. My son Loves it w/ 4 strips of bacon on top, adds a wonderful smokey flavor and makes a great Gravy. Just for fun I put 3 hard boiled eggs in the middle make it look and taste great!!

I love meatloaf (strange, I know) and I'm always game to try new ones. This is OK, but I'll go back to my usual from a James Beard cookbook. Beard suggests a 2:1:1, beef:pork:veal mix(nice texture and moist)and flavors the mix with rosemary,thyme,garlic (lots), grated onion, shredded carrots, Dijon mustard, and Tabasco. "Filler" is bread crumbs in cream. It's terrific.

Rating: 0
Two comments before trying:it seems similar to a Lady's Home Journal cookbook recipe (1970's)= that used saltines for the bulking up. Recipe also does not say if cooked oatmeal is using the old fashioned or the quick oatmeal- there is a difference. Will let you know as soon as I try it.

What can I say, meatloaf is meatloaf. I and my family have always liked meatloaf and this a little different and new. All liked this version and it will go into recipe boxes for future use.
