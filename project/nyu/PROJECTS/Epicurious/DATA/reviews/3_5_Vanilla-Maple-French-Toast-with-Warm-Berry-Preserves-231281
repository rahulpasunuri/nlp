I have never soaked the bread overnight because I thought it was unnecessary. I've never been disappointed with a 10-15 minute "dip" in advance of cooking. I suppose if you wanted to have a "make ahead" there could be value in soaking overnight. But otherwise, you're fine doing it just before putting it in the pan. I'm not sure about other reviewers complaining about burning. I was getting close to there at 4 minutes per side and maybe I'd reduce to 3.5 minutes per side, but that's not a big difference. The taste of this is delightful, with the vanilla-maple flavour permeating the toast.

I hate to give this a 2 but following these directions did not lead to a good result. I halved the recipe, added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. I used a Blueberry Breakfast Bread and soaked for about 5 minutes, even in just that short time it got pretty soggy. Grilling over medium was too hot, my sides browned but the inside was mushy. I ended up baking for 15 minute in a 350 oven but even that couldn't save this attempt. I would try this again, but next time I'll only bake as other viewers recommended and not let my bread soak as long.

I skipped the sugar because I'd pour maple syrup over the cooked french toast anyway, and it still came out fine. The only thing is, the recipe calls for cooking the toast over a medium-flame for 4 mins each side, but on my stove, a medium flame burned the toast after just 1-2 mins. For this recipe, I used some stale artisan bread (wheat and rye) that I couldn't think of any other uses for. It turned out fine.

Warm berry preserves was the best part; I used frozen strawberries and blueberries and loved the result. This recipe gets four forks for being easy and tasty, but I'm giving it an overall rating of three forks because I just didn't think the batter had much flavor. I couldn't taste the maple syrup, and I wished I'd added some cinnamon or nutmeg. Can't beat it for an impressive Christmas morning breakfast, though - just fire up the griddle, pull the dish out of the fridge, and voila! I'll definitely tweak it and make it again.

I love this recipe. I used the braided Challah bread and cut it just under an inch thick. It never gets soggy, and the flavor is amazing after soaking overnight. I also make a fresh berry sauce using 3 cups fresh mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries, blackberries), 1/2 cup sugar, 1 T. fresh lemon juice. Cook in small pot over low heat approximately 15 min or until sauce thickens a bit. Finally, add powdered sugar to the toast/berry platter. Beautiful and delicious.

This is an outstanding french toast recipe. I used to make the eggnog french toast for Christmas every year but this recipe is even better and has become a new tradition for our family. The maple vanilla flavor is superb with the the warm berry preserves which have just the right balance of sweet and tart.

Like one of the ealier reviewers, I too have found that french toast when soaked overnight often becomes quite soggy. Due to my experience with this problem, I decided to soak each slice of toast about 30 seconds per side just before cooking it on a large griddle. recipe. I also transferred the fried toast to a baking sheet, sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar (I do love the flavor of cinnamon), and baked the toasts for about 10 minutes at 300. The toast came out with a nice carmelized sugar coating and no sogginess. Success! With the cinnamon sugar coating, the french toast really didn't need anything else, and was quite delicious all on its own, so I didn't end up making the warm berry preserves or even using syrup. I would certainly make this again, but with my changes. Hey, every cook adds a personal touch, right?

It wasn't bad so much as it was not great. The berries were fabulous (I used one 12oz bag each of frozen raspberry and frozen blackberries) and would definitely make again. The best part of the french toast was using the french bread (firm and chewy) but the actual flavor of the toast was very mild, almost bland. Hmmm, I don't know if I'll revisit this recipe but I would encourage anyone to make it.

This was GREAT! I served it for brunch on New Year's Day and it was a hit. Some tips: I substituted 1 c. of what my family calls "Coquito" (eggnog, a little rum, cinnamon - no particular amounts) for 1 c. milk, and added a couple dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix. This made for a rich flavor. I, too, warmed the toast in the oven at 250 deg. while cooking the other pieces and waiting for guests - no soggy-middle problems! Also, be sure to make the berry preserves. It's really easy, and everyone raved!

Tremendous recipe. Very easy to make, just put in 10 minutes of work the night before and 20 the day of. The vanilla and maple flavors in the french toast were in perfect harmony and didn't overpower things. The berry preserves were excellent as well. Adding the Red Currant jam was a great touch, lending a touch of acidity and helping to thicken the preserves with the pectin that is so abundant in currants.

I made this french toast on xmas morning for my family (parents, sibling, boyfriend and two sets of grandparents). Everyone said it was the best french toast they'd ever had and wouldn't leave without the recipe. Will make again and again.

Had to increase the egg/milk mixture as others have also. Used egg bread. This smelled delicious coooking. Did not make the warm berry preserves. Served with warm maple syrup.

I made this ahead for Christmas morning breakfast. It was not difficult. My family loved it. Although it was not necessary, we added whipped cream on top of the berry preserves just to see how it would taste. It, too, was a big hit.

Very Good. Used one part half and half to two parts whole milk, and upped the eggs and everything by about a third. Used trader joe's texas toast bread. Everyone loved this Christmas morning.

Outstanding recipe! My 96-year old grandmother who is very "picky" even asked for seconds. For the sauce, substituted a 10-oz. frozen bag each of organic frozen raspberries and organic frozen blackberries, increased the red currant jelly to 3/4 cup, and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. The flavor was wonderful and better than when using the mixed berries (which adds blueberries and even more strawberries). Will definitely make again. Great when served with the suggested Rosemary and Mustard Breakfast Sausages.

Excellent--this will be my standard french toast recipe from now on. The fruit topping is good but nearly masks the fabulous custardy flavor and texture of the french toast.

Four forks for a french toast! I was surprised how exquisite yet simple and delicious these were with the mere addition of vanilla and maple syrup. Easy too - made quickly on Christmas Eve, then tossed in the oven Christmas morning. We decided to bake them to avoid any possible sogginess, and this worked out great - 400F for about 35-40 min, turning halfway thru so both sides crisped up. We served with maple syrup and just had a nice fruit salad on the side, plus the mustard/rosemary sausage patties suggested on the site.

i made this twice so far. the first time i followed the recipe, but the second time i just left the soaked bread in the dish and baked it at 350 for 1/2 an hour or so. i am lazy and clumsy in the morning, so i prefer the oven baked method. plus it tastes better, because the bread insides aren't soggy. the topping is fantastic. i add a shot of rum, because i am also a lush.

This dish was just wonderful. I happened to have some fresh vanilla bean in the house which added some extra flavor. We kicked it up a notch by adding Bailey's Irish cream to the mixture- all I can say is wow. Everyone was raving the next morning. A perfect brunch dish!

This was amazing. Although I did not make the berry preserves, just served with local maple syrup, everyone raved about it. It is now a brunch favourite!

This recipe was so delicious and very easy to make. I actually had a lot of the ingredients at home, so I didn't have to go to the grocery store and spend a fortune. I didn't put as much sugar into the egg mixture as they called for, but it still turned out great. It had just the right flavor! My mom loved it for a Mother's Day breakfast :)

this reminds me of the best french toast i have had which was in Marea, Tahiti - french bread is the best and soaking overnight - keeps the bread from just being toast w/a coating - then have fun w/what you put on top

I made this recipe, due to its simplicity and ability to make ahead of time. The French toast was great, the preparation was easy, but I thought the compote wasn't thick enough. I would make a variation of the French toast in the future, but omit the compote and top with glazed bananas, raisins, nuts, and maple syrup.

This was very good. I took the advise of the other reveiws and placed them in the oven for warming while I cooked the others and all turned out well. Since I did not have the currant jelly, I used home made crabapple jelly for the sauce, but used perhaps too much sugar. The sauce was very sweet. Next time I will try it using the ingredients listed and see how it goes.

This is a nice do-ahead recipe. My family enjoyed it. I sliced the bread thicker (1 inch) and cooked over lower heat for a longer time. I also warmed in the oven and had no problem with the french toast being soggy.

My family gobbled this up. The berry sauce is amazing. After frying up the french toast I baked to get rid of the soggy middle. YUM!!!!

Rating: 3
Came out very nicely with the berry sauce. The flavor and texture of the toast is great, but, as other raters have mentioned, right out of the pan the toast is soggy. Hold them a few minutes in the oven and you will have the best french toast ever. I might add the lightest dusting of powdered sugar at the end next time.

Delicous and loved by my guests. Putting them in the oven after cooking is a great idea, because they do tend to sogginess!

I have to give this one a qualified yes on making it again. When (if) I make this again, I know that I need to cook them longer than 4 minutes a side and on lower heat. Cooked according to directions, I had barely browned and soggy-in-the-middle toast. In all honesty, the recipe is too big for my needs and too labor intensive for the results. Nice for mornings when you want to show off, but not going to be one of my regular repetoire.

Rating: 3
Very good. Just after frying the first one, I found it soggy in the middle and was unsure how the rest would turn out. After holding them in the oven while finishing, they cooked just enough to be perfect. The berry preserves were great with this. I liked being able to do everything the night before, and I didn't find the bread too difficult to work with in the morning. Great leftovers.

Absolutely devine, I have made this several times and it gets better each time. A must have in your recipe box.

I hate to comment without trying but wanted to answer the reviewer about the rating. First, as far as I can tell, Epicurious counts comments without a fork rating as 0 forks and, if you don't check the 'would make this dish again' then it counts as a No. So, anytime someone makes a comment without checking those two items, it makes the ratings appear worse. Hence, my three fork rating and a yes, I would make it again (even though I haven't made it the first time!) Hey, I just love breakfast food.

I agree with Omaha reader. The 10 mins. soak on both sides is enough.

I wanted to ask the reviewer from Cape Cod what the recipe for rosemary-mustard sausage was. I cannot seem to find it anywhere but it sounds delicious.

This turned out light and delicious. I love that for a large crowd, one can brown in a skillet, and then hold in the oven while all batches are being browned, until ready to serve. This also helps bake the doughiness out of the toasts.

I have not tried this recipe but it sounds delicious. Just wondered Epicurious, why rate this at 57% where almost everyone who tried this gave it a minimum of three forks.

We loved this recipe! It is so pretty and festive, not to mention delicious. I did not see the 2-hour thaw time on the berry preserves until Christmas morning, so did it in the microwave, and could notice no ill effects. Scrumptious!

Made this for Thanksgiving as well as Christmas breakfast as part of the whole menu...citrus fruit salad, rosemary-mustard sausage and caramel hot chocolate. We loved it! I soak the bread for only a few minutes before cooking rather than overnight to avoid the sogginess issue. Leftover berry preserves are wonderful over ice cream!

Apologize for comment without trying recipe; however, my wife and I have tried recipes where the bread is in the egg mixture overnight and invariably the toast turns out too soggy for our liking. Read on. What intrigued me about the recipe was the addition of maple syrup to the egg mixture. So, I will make my (dip it and fry it) version using the syrup and the warmed berry preserves.

Yum! Tasted great and even though the preserves turned out a bit runny it was a great breakfast.

I halved the recipe and, since we had a late breakfast, the batch soaked over night for about 15 hours. The toast seemed to brown in less than 4 minutes on medium heat, and the inside was warm but soggy.

To the cook from New York: Yes, Challah is always a wonderful choice of bread for french toast.

The Geneva Convention states that it is illegal to use challah as an ingredient in this recipe.

If it gets too mushy to fry, you can always bake French Toast. It will get puffy and browned and cooked through without getting too dark on the outside. This sounds like a great variation on an old favorite.

Have made it two or three times for company. Delicious!!!! First time, left in refrigerator for 2 nights instead of one due to busy schedule. Not a good idea, it fell apart was very mushy but still delicious.
