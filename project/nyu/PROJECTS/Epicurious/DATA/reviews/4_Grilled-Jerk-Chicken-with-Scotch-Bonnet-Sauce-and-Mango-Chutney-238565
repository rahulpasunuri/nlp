I love spicy food, however this was over the top. Next time I make it I will not coat the chicken, only partially coat it. The mango chutney was a nice accompaniment but I would double it--I might also follow a previous reviewer's advice and not cook it but serve it fresh as a salsa. I served it with cold cantaloupe soup which was a godsend considering the heat of the recipe!

SO quick and easy, and SO delicious. By far, best jerk marinade i've ever had. If you've never made from scratch before, must try. You'll never buy prepared again. for the chicken maranade i followed the recipe pretty closely. I substituted shallot for scallions, added a few cloves of minced garlic, and used a touch of prepared mustard b/c i could not find my dry mustard until after the fact. also, i roasted and peeled the scotch bonnets before mincing into paste. For chutney, I substituted peach for mango, omitted sugar, and did not cook. Mine was more of a "peach salsa" but I loved the cold fresh fruit with the spicy chicken. I didn't think I'd need the extra sauce, but made it anyways, and was glad that i did. I prepared a simple cabbage slaw, and also some black beans for side dishes, sauce was particularly good drizzled on top of black beans and chicken. And everything was cooled down by fruit salsa and slaw. YUM! Thuis was a super quick, easy, inexpensive weeknight meal. Can not recommend enough!

Made this for a going away party as I went off to college. Loved the chicken, it was very moist and juicy, but I used a different recipe for the mango chutney. It was very spicy, and I didn't use habaneros because I couldn't find them, so I used serranos. Even with the lesser pepper, it was damn hot, and I love spicy food. I used dijon mustard for the sauce because I don't care for yellow mustard, and that was nice and tangy. My girlfriends and I were dipping sliced cucumbers into the sauce it was so good!

this recipe is awesome. the chutney cuts the heat of the rub and sauce really well. yes, the sauce is spicy, but not overpowering and sense-dulling. i'll make this again (and again, etc.) but next time i'll make more of the chutney. awesome.

The number of chilies including seeds is intestinal suicide. I used habaneros instead of scotch bonnet because of availability. I used 1 seed pod for every 6 the recipe called for and this was still very hot. The chilie sauce itself still so insanely hot I strained the seeds and chilies from it before serving hoping it would cool down and no one could tolerate more than 1 tsp of sauce per serving. I live in Phoenix where hot food is customary but I would highly advise not using any seeds in this recipe. The chicken and chutney were delicious.

I've made this many times according to the recipe and everyone loves it. But I was in the West Indies for the holidays and Mango's were out of season. So instead I used apples (not expecting it to be that great of a substitute) The apple chutney was amazing. I made it just as I usually make the mango chutney, and will probably never use mango's again as everyone agreed the apple was much better.

Rarely disappointed in a Bon Appetit recipe - but unlike others I wasn't impressed with the Chutney or the rub.

I needed to do something different with some chicken breasts. I have always preferred "paste" marinades to liquid ones, so I found this recipe and used what I had on hand, which was jalapenos instead of scotch bonnets and wasabi powder instead of dry mustard. It was still a delicious result (and spicy -- I think the wasabi made up for the fact that jalapenos are milder than scotch bonnets). I also needed to use the mango that had ben ripening in the fridge. I didn't make the sauce; I will next time. This was great!

Awesome! While this recipe is different from what I tasted in Jamaica (the only condiment I had there was a hot red sauce), everything works so well together. The leftovers were delicious too - hot or cold. Serve it with Jamaican Rice and Peas (also available on Epicurious) to cool it down a bit. The leftover Scotch bonnet sauce (halved the mustard and filled in with mayo) is excellent on eggs. Wow. This is one of my best finds so far on Epicurious.

Very good, and a big hit at a summer dinner party. I served this with red beans and rice and cut corn on the cob mixed with a bit of sauteed onion and chopped green pepper. I made this with slightly less than half of the peppers it called for, and this was still PLENTY spicy. I recommend following others advice for the pepper sauce and reducing the amount of mustard used and mixing with 1/4c mayo. Note: This is very, very time consuming to make, because you are making a fresh spice paste and two separate sauces. All three of those could be made ahead of time. Suggestion: Brining the chicken breasts was easy to do and made them juicer on the grill.

I didn't change anything! Wow, great flavor with just the right amount of "attitude"!

This is a great recipe. Served it to the elderly parents. It wasn't to hot for them. I did omit most of the seeds. I allowed the chicken to marinade overnight. It remained moist,tender and flavorful.

Fantastic! It has just enough heat, but you can still catch the curry and cumin flavors. Served it with traditional Jamaican rice and beans and plantain chips. I recommend adding the 1/4 c. of mayo to tone down the strong mustard flavor. Next up: I'm trying it in a dutch oven on our next camping trip.

The habanero is not the same pepper as the Scotch Bonnet They are of the same species but the Scotch Bonnet is not a Cultivar. The Scotch Bonnet has a different shape - one which closely resembles a Scot's bonnet - so it is very easy to differentiate the two. The Scotch Bonnet grows mainly in the Caribbean islands while the habanero grows mainly in Latin and North American. The flavor of the two, however, is very similar as is their heat level.

This dish was phenomenal. The mango chutney created a sweet background which perfectly complimented the very upfront hot and spicy chicken. Even for spice lovers this dish kicks as evidenced by the preparation directions stating "stand back to let fumes dissipate." Loved it! A++

We used a milder chile, but this was an absolutely fantastic dinner, and the children loved it! We served it with couscous.

I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, so I won't give a fork rating for my altered version. I brined my breast/wing and thigh/leg chicken portions for 2 hours before seasoning them. (Rinse well after brining.) Seasoned and chilled for 3 hours. Next time, I would leave in the fridge for an additional hour or two. I didn't change the chutney; it was very delicious but next time, I will make a mango salsa instead. I blended the scotch bonnet sauce ingredients and added 1/4 cup of mayo to tame the strong mustard overtones. The addition of the mayo really allowed the flavors of the cumin and curry to stand out. This will be made again and again!

Superb! Had some leftover jerk and scotch bonnet sauce wich worked very well later in the week with some store bought turkey burgers on the grill. Mixed about 4 tablespoons of sauce with 1/4 cup mayo and man, that was some spread. I love heat that has flavor, and this recipe has an abundance of both.

This was excellent. So full of flavor. I didn't care for the scotch bonnet sauce-it tasted too much like mustard. But just the spicy flavor of chicken with the mango chutney over jasmine rice was amazing.

This is hands-down the best recipe of any type that I have ever found. It is so good that I dreamed about it all night! Everyone at my dinner party was astonished at how flavorful, complex, and balanced this dish was. The combination of the spicy grilling paste, the sweet chutney, and the immensely flavorful and spicy sauce is ingenious. I used bone-in chicken breasts that I grilled to get grill marks and carmelization and then finished in the oven. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and packed a punch. I used habaneros insteach of scotch bonnets, and I included seeds. The habanero sauce would be excellent on fish, pork, or beef as well. This dish was the focal point of a dinner that consisted of fruit salad with orange yogurt sauce, the chicken with sauces, my chipotle potatoes au gratin, grilled corn in lime juice, key lime pie, and (later) peach, blackberry, and raspberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream.

This was an excellent jerk chicken, full of heat and flavor. I wasn't able to get Scotch Bonnets, but substituted Habaneros which are equally hot, and I did cut down a bit on the quantity. I also used chicken on the bone, which kept it nice and moist. The only thing I would change would be to use a different Mango Chutney (Salsa). I definitely will make this again.
