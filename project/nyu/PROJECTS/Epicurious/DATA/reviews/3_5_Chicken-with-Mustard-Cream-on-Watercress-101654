I used spicy brown mustard and it was great. Just the right kick. Easy and my kids loved it. Could substitute half and half if the whipped cream is too much for the diet.

Really terrific. Fast, too. But not at all healthy, of course.

I found this dish a little bland, maybe dijon mustard would have been better, or some white wine in the sauce. Coupled with the watercress, however, it wasn't bad. And very quick and easy.

I had to substitute stuff I had in the house: sour cream and Grey Poupon for the sauce, arugula with a little watercress thrown in for the greens. I always dredge the chicken in seasoned flour when making a dish like this... It came out really well! I don't much care for honey dijon, anyhow. This is a nice, easy recipe that lends itself to tweaking.

Everyone loved this dish. I skipped the watercress and served with rice and peas, just a simple weeknight dinner, so simple and delicious! Whole family said - make this again!

I kinda modified the recipe and marinaded chicken breasts in the sauce and then baked in the oven. This didn't really add anything to the dish and we didn't have enough sauce. Since the flavor was so good, next time I will just put the sauce on a few chicken breasts, bake at 350 for about 15 minutes and YUM YUM! I will also make sure to have enough sauce for dipping...delicious!

This really deserve an extra half fork because it was so easy! If your chicken is thawed already, it's a super quick meal that looks like it took awhile to make. I followed it to the 'T' (except drizzled some olive oil and sea salt over the greens) and there were no leftovers. Next time I am going to double the sauce for bread-dipping.

This dish is absoultley worth trying, but only if you like cream sauce obviously. It was super easy and fast to make, and it tastes different and great. My folks even liked it, and they never like anything except their own foreign-crap. The chicken was so moist, I have never cooked a more perfectly moist piece of chicken in my life. I will definatley make this again. I used half & half, and skipped out on the watercress. Yum!

I made this for a little dinner party I had a week ago and it was SO easy and everyone loved it. It doesn't get much better than that... delicious, easy, quick and impressive!

Such a great dish!!! SUPER easy and fast. I've made it a few times and want to lick the plate each time. I haven't used a honey dijon because I only have Grey Poupon (sp?) in my fridge and I haven't bothered with watercress. It's good with buttered noodles though. Without the watercress it makes a little too much sauce but that's ok becuase you'll want to swish your veggies or whatever else is on your plate in it. It's not one of my favorite foods, but it's getting 4 forks because the amount of yumminess you get per effort expended is awesome.

The sauce was perfect for chicken. I also like the pepperiness of the watercress. It was a good compliment to this dish. This dish is very easy for the gourmet taste you get. I'll make it for company next time.

I've used half and half and it works just as well. A nice easy dish.

This is a much faster than 45 min. recipe, and it works well for a meal that is more than "ho-hum" and a "get out the china" meal.

The sauce was GREAT! The second time I made it I used low fat sour cream instead of regular cream and a little cornstarch to thicken---and that was even better!!! Good on salmon, too.

Very good recipe. Great with the watercress. Works fine with half&half. Could even cut a bit on the butter I think. And best of all -- it's so simple to make!

I made this easy-to-prepare dish for a party of 6 and received rave reviews, especially because the chicken breasts were remarkably tender. I served it with couscous prepared from a box and roasted cauliflower with garlic, another favorite recipe from Epicurious.

This recipe was easy and quick, yet tasty and mature enough for a impromptu dinner party. I had all of the ingredients in the pantry/fridge and my in-laws loved it. I don't cook as much as I used to now that I have a baby, so this is good recipe for the haggard and harried.

This was definitely good, but nothing really spectacular. I didn't find it necessary to use whipping cream -- half and half or light cream are just fine. I'd also like to try different flavored mustards to change the taste a little.

Easy enough for "just dinner tonight" and tasty enough for company. Use the watercress for sure, spinach is ok but changes the dish a lot. This dish gets more complements than it deserves considering how easy it is.

I agree with the previous reviews -- an outstanding dish considering the ease of preparation. I also served it on spinach instead of watercress. But serve it with rice, couscous, noodles, buckwheat -- something to soak up the scrumptious sauce.

I'm giving this dish 4 forks for its simplicity. I came home a little late from work and happened to have all the ingredients on hand (gotta love those holiday recipes!) except the watercress. I threw this together and found it very tasty and easy to do. I nuked a potato and poured some of the sauce over it...yummy! It also went well with the broccoli I prepared. I used half-n-half and didn't notice anything lacking. This is one of those easy-to-remember recipes that will save you on a weekend night.

I've made this 4 times, and it is always a winner. I even used alfalfa sprouts in a pinch once (I'm not proud of that) and it STILL worked. Really foolproof, that reviewer from VA puzzles me too. Make this one tonight!

This recipe is a winner: Quick, tasty and, with just a little modification, very low fat/calorie. my modifications: I sauteed in 1 teaspoon olive oil in nonstick skillet, simmered 5 minutes in the chicken broth to ensure thorough cooking, cooked the broth down after removing chicken and used fat free half & half (1/3 cup mixed with 1 tea cornstarch). I will try arugula or spinach when I can't get watercress.

This recipe will easily dazzle your guests! It gives a great presentation, easy to prepare and taste wonderful. The reviewer from VA took an easy recipe and made it sound complicated-it's not.

I am a newlywed so I now cook for two tastebuds. My husband adores this recipe! Although it is a simple recipe, people will think you spent a few hours in the kitchen. It took me 20 minutes to prepare! I served the chicken on couscous and spread the sauce over both. Steamed broccoli added a nice touch to the dinner and made the plate very colorful. This recipe will go into my dinner rotation.

This was so good! It's a recipe I will make again and again. It was easy too.

The person from Northern Virginia should really read the recipe carefully before criticizing, because obviously they are a little inexperienced and mixed up ingredients here. It really is a simple and quite excellent recipe when followed properly. Which is the first rule in learning to cook, by the way.

I make this dish at least twice a month -- it's a great fallback when you want something that's fast (takes about 25 minutes if everything's ready to go) and pretty tasty. Nice sweetness to the sauce, especially if the chicken's been browned a lot. You don't put the watercress in the sauce, though -- no wonder it didn't thicken up!

1.) Watercress, as it is called, is watery, like spinach. A thickener or pre-cooking and draining of the cress needs to be done. 2.) Cream--does this recipe come from a recipe that used creme fraiche? Could try sour cream or homemade creme fraiche, no? 3.) Says saute until sauce thickens, but it doesn't, because of above two factors, the light cream and the cress. 4.) What's with the honey mustard?? Why not just mustard? 5.) But the real problem is flavor. I'd put some finely chopped shallots, or finely chopped garlic and onions, and use a combo of chicken broth and butter, with madeira or dry sherry or lemon juice or a little vinegar into the pan after searing the chicken, to get all the little bitty bits up into the sauce, then add creme fraiche and mustard, THEN put it all onto the bed of drained cress. 6.) Why would you put dill into the couscous, when you have all these wonderful flavors in the sauce that the couscous can soak up? Perhaps, if you're a real fan of dill, you could put it into the salad as a last course refresher, but I would still find the combination strange.
