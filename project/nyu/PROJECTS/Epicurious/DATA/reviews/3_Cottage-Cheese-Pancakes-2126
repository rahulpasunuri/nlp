These are pretty good, fluffy yet substantial and not too sweet. I cooked them in butter rather than oil. I also added a dash of salt and 1/8 tsp. of cinnamon, and reduced the cardamom to 1/8 tsp. I'll make them again.

While I subbed low fat plain yogurt for the cottage cheese and almond meal for the oatmeal, these are delicious and fairly healthy. Very tender thus a little difficult to flip, but individual packages of these in my freezer is like money in the bank when I need something quick to heat up for breakfast on a workday. Just add some sliced bananas and a little grade B syrup. Yummy and nutritious.

I was looking forward to this recipe, the batter looked lovely, but didn't set up in the pan and they were too difficult to flip-very soft and a mess in my pan! Did the recipe as a 1/2 of the original, but all the ingredients were the same, no substitutions like others who reviewed. May have to make up my own or use one another reviewer suggested. Disappointed.

I had no vegetable oil and the butter really caused cakes to blacken during cooking, but they tasted pretty good with applesause. Will try again and be more careful with whipping and folding whites. Very good but missed a certain substance/richness to cake. Plan to use for next day breakfast for picky toddler who gave them a "yum".

Really delicious! Like the person below, I needed to use some cottage cheese up. Used white flour, no oats, and maple syrup instead of honey (okay, so they're not so good for you!), and an equal # of egg yolks to whites.... They are light, flavorful and easy. Much nicer than regular pancakes!

I had this package of cottage cheese. I didn't know what to do with it. So I found this recipe, and although the stuff was full fat and not fat free, I decided I'd try it anyway. I also didn't have whole wheat flour or the special oats, so I used regular white flour and regular oats. It turned out just great, if not the same exact healthy version. The egg whites really top it off. I didn't make the special topping, which sounded good, but applesauce would've done nicely too. Also, I wouldn't cook the things in vegetable oil. I'd just use a nonstick pan.

I love this recipe - so decadent, yet healthy. Be sure to follow the recipe - don't overwhip your whites and make sure to fold the ingredients in batches rather than all at once.

I really liked these pancakes alot because they are healthy and different (I'm always trying out different pancake recipes). I thought the amount of cardamom was perfect. I tried them once exactly as the recipe was and another time modified where I added the same number of yolks and whites (although I did still add the whites separately which I think is important to make the pancakes light) and I also added a little more flour and grains the second time. Both times were great, but the recipe as is produces a lighter more delicate cake. Yummy!

I added a cup of ground hazelnuts, one cup pomegranate seeds and a tsp of dried orange peel. I used four egg yolks and two egg whites plus a little more milk. Cottage cheese and milk were non-fat. Great taste, crunch and fluffiness

What is "mutigrain oatmeal"? Isn't oatmeal made from one grain: oats?

A question: does the recipe call for dry cottage cheese curds, or the regular tub of creamy cottage cheese? It seems it would be really wet with the regular stuff.

Forget the yolk/whites separation and the cardamon; yes, these may taste almost like the regular pancackes as another cook observed, but they are more nutritious and more satisfying thanks to the cottage cheese and oatmeal. I try to make this recipe every time I buy cottage cheese.

These pancakes were OK, but there was too much cardamom in both the pancakes and the berry topping--my husband said they tasted peppery. If I make these again, I'll reduce the cardamom by up to half. Other than the cardamom, these pancakes didn't taste too much different than normal pancakes.
