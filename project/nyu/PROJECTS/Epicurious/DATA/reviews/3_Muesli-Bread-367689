I made this recipe with only a few changes. Stayed true to the almond flour/almond butter base as I was looking for a GOOD gluten free quick bread. First, almond butter -- drained off oil and mixed it with apple butter instead. Added Cinnamon and Cardamom. You can use any combo of dried fruits and nuts. Mine was clean out the cupboard combo -- dates, coconut, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax, craisins. I recommend baking on the shy side of 50 min. as it was more than ample time. Glad I made a double batch!! Perfect drizzled with honey, jam or paired with a tangy cheese. Love it and so does the family.

The "not vegan" review I don't think is a fair review, as no where does it claim to be. I quite enjoyed this recipe, but I have to confess, I did change it quite a bit, as this recipe became a "garbage" bread - I used up a bunch of dry ingredients I wanted gone and I didn't want to buy things I might not use again. But the consistency was excellent and the cook time was correct. I kept measurements the same except only used 3 tbsp arrowroot as I didn't have much. Here are some of the substitutions I used - nutella for some of the almond butter, almonds instead of pistachios, whole wheat flour instead of almond flour, wheat bran instead of flax meal, raisins instead of cranberries, shredded coconut instead of sunflower seeds. Sorry lots of subs, but I really enjoyed this and think I will buy some of the called for ingredients now. But I also like this bread for the fact that I can use what I have laying around too.
