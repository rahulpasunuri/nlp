I loved it! Seems that my sea bass was not thick enough, so 12 minutes in the oven made it almost fall apart (maybe it's supposed to be so). Also, it was to much onions to eat. It's great to have it for flavor, but i would just leave a half in a pan. Accompanied the fish with steamed baby carrots, zuccini and corn kernels. Looked just like we are in a fancy restaurant=)

This is a wonderful recipe. My kids loved it! Its great because you can sneak in veggies with the sauce. Its a delightful dish that definitely deserves 4 forks!

Holy crap, that sauce is delicious. I let the onions cook alone for awhile before I added the garlic, anchovies, etc (so they wouldn't burn). Served it over steamed spinach instead of bread. Excellent.

The boyfriend was thru the roof about this fish- dish. Not only was the bass "like butta," the sauce complimented the fish perfectly. Tossed pasta in the reduced sauce and served under the fish. Oh yum!!

I have made this dish multiple times, including for dinner parties as it is easy to do all the prep work ahead of time. The recipe is excellent just as written, but I have modified it at times with great success as well. Adding a bit of lemon zest and capers helps to give it more of a Mediterranean flavor and brightness. I typically will add a full cup of wine too rather than just 3/4. I have served it over French bread as recommended, as well as rice cooked in broth and pasta as well. Also, substituting halibut works well as it is very thick and flaky and holds up well to the sauce. Herbs such as Herb de Provence or thyme are nice additions too, especially if you have the herbs fresh in the garden and are looking for a good use for them. Definitely try - you won't be disappointed!

This is a delicious dish. I made this using drained canned tomatoes and I added a few chopped Kalamata olives with the tomatoes. Didn't need to simmer the sauce down. The fish came out perfect. Watch it carefully though at this high temp.

I first had this dish @ Rose Pistola & it was one of the best things I have ever eaten in a restaurant. Sea Bass was unavailable so I used Dover Sole, stacked 2 thin filets (per person) on top of one another then followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out absolutely delicious! Definitely a keeper.

Very good, and easy to fix. I also added asparagus into the pot, which came out perfectly.

This dish was a big hit. I served it over linguini and didn't use anchovies. Olives or capers would be a nice addition. The sauce can be prepared ahead of time and left on the stove until you're ready to cook the fish and eat! ENJOY!

This was fabulous. I skipped the crouton part. Instead, I made the "sauteed swiss chard" recipe from this site and laid the fish over the swiss chard and then ladeled the sauce over the fish. Served with a light herb rice. It was a great and easy way to make fish.

This was delicious and easy! I used tilapia instead of bass and it came out great. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious! I used shallots instead of onions and fewer tomatoes than the recipe called for. Another change was using more wine for more sauce, as suggested by other reviewers. Finally, I added a bit of cream to the sauce just before serving. I used just 2 filets (1 lb of sea bass) and served it over thin spaghetti. It was a hit at our house and if I am fortunate enough to find fresh sea bass again, I will use this recipe!

I dont eat seafood-(ick!) but my fiancee loves it so much that i make it specially for him. He thought that this was delicious and would "eat it everyday!" Easy to make too!

Delicious every time I've made it! It could probably benefit even more from another tablespoon or two of anchovies, and I'm not a huge anchovy fan. Also, before adding the fish to the sauce, I always sear it in a separate skillet for a few minutes until lightly browned on each side. It just gives it a nice sort of "crust", for lack of a better word. I love it served over angel hair pasta with a little olive oil.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe. Next time I will add more wine to the pan to have more of a sauce, and I would definitely increase the anchovies for a more intense flavor. Very nice.

This was excellent. I used whitefish instead of sea bass and canned diced tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh. Otherwise everything as it was written. The anchovies really add a lot of flavor.

Nice but not spectacular. Fairly basic-tasting tomato coulis.

This dish is wonderful. It has amazing flavor! You can't taste the anchovies, so don't let them scare you away. I will make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! I couldn't find sea bass, so I substituted fresh grouper. Also used shallots instead of onions. The anchovies and red pepper added a nice complexity to the sauce. Will definitely make it again.

This was the first time my beau and I made this recipe together (our first New Year's together!). It was absolutely delicious! I definitely want to make it again. I think the anchovies really make the sauce. We added a little extra for flavor. And thanks to the cook from Charlotte, NC for the shrimp idea! I recommend it too.

This recipe was AMAZING!!! It was so simple yet so delicious. The sauce is excellent. I wouldn't change a thing.

We really enjoyed this recipe and I have been craving it ever since. I highly recommend it even though I made a few adjustments cause of what I had in the house. I did not have french bread so I skipped that part of the recipe. I did not have plum tomatoes and used grape tomatoes inystead. It was yummy just the same.

I also tried this last night and was greatly surprised. I found the fish (I used stripped bass caught the day before)and it came out extremely moist. I recommend this to anyone especially a person who does not like a strong tasting fish.

I've made this dish several times for family and friends and it never fails to draw high praise. I've even added peeled and deveined shrimp and baked along with the fish. Wonderful!!

The recipe was a delicious surprise. I expected it to be a little more bland. I used a west coast fish, white sea bass, instead of the typical Chilean sea bass and a chardonnay. I also added a little extra red pepper (3/4 tsp total) and a few extra anchovy fillets. Instead of regular French bread, I substituted whole wheat French bread which added extra flavor. Use good quality olive oil on the toasted bread as it adds a surprising amount of flavor. The recommendation of four slices of bread (for 4-8 ounce fish steaks)was less than adequate to have bread with each piece of fish. Make 7-8 slices and serve each piece of fish on the bread like an open face sandwich. That way you get the flavor of the bread/oil with each bite of fish. I will definitely make this one again.

I just made this last night, but substituted swordfish for the sea bass. It was wonderful! My husband who usually thinks that fish is too bland, loved the flavors in this dish!

This was delicious and I am a terrible cook. Very easy to make. Takes 10 mins to prepare and 15 mins to cook. I cut the recipe in half for two servings but used an entire 2oz can of anchovies by mistake. Turned out great anyway. I used cherry tomatoes and cut them in halves..looked very pretty. Serve with asparagas or green vege for extra color. thanks, jamie in philly

THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE SEA BASS RECIPE. EXTREMELY EASY AND DELICIOUS.

I've made it twice. The sauce tends to sublimate the delicate sea bass, so I'm starting to think halibut would be better ("just for the halibut," nyuk nyuk). Be sure to adjust the final dish for seasonings if your tomatoes aren't snappy.

I tried the recipe with halibut instead of sea bass and it turned out great!

Easy! can substitute a 14oz can of chopped tomato with garlic and onion for the fresh ingredients, with excellent results and faster cooking time! The toasted croutons make the dish!

Very easy to make! Simple and delicious. I didn't reduce the sauce at the end, so it was more of a broth, but still wonderful.

The dish turned out great, and was one of the better fish dishes I've tried. Word of caution, though: be carefull with the last step of cooking the sauce. Remember that the pan was just at 500 F!

Very flavorful dish, light, fresh and so easy to make.

Surprisingly easy and taste so fresh! Even when I substitute the sea bass with orange roughy or other fish.
