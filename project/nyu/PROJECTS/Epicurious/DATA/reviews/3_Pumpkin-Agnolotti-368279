Overall my wife and I loved the results, but some tweaks might help. First, using won ton wrappers was problematic as they tended to tear when boiling and when being flipped in the frying pan. Consider making your own pasta. We did like the lemon zest in the filling which brought a nice light note to it. We also added sage and nutmeg (pretty classic). As the finishing touch we ditched the creme fraiche and drizzled white truffle oil on top. We served this as one course of Thanksgiving dinner and it met with rave reviews.

My husband loved it and it was easy to make. Just the right amount of pumpkin.

This dish is simple but elegant, the sort of food one would eat on a night they wish to be warmed but not stuffed, satisfied but not engorged. They are delicate, and require the touch of either a masterful cook or well trained lover. If someone offers to make these for you, it would be best to ask which of the two the other person is before proceeding. I must however bring a rare mark of SHAME down upon the food deities at Bon Appétit. Agnolotti, I would expect them to know, is a very specific type of ravioli originating in the Pietmont region. To be Agnolotti, the filling MUST be roast beef and vegetable with no cheese, with a sprinkling of Parmesan allowed. Changing the recipe results in a new type of...albeit delicious...ravioli. Why fuss? Well, to make a pumpkin ravioli and call it Agnolotti is like grilling pineapple in prosciutto and giving it to someone as bananas foster. It would be like offering a ham sandwich to a vegan who ordered a garden salad. If we are complacent with such food wishy-washiness, chaos...nay, ANARCHY...could reign down upon us, ushering in a dystopian future where all of our foods are pre-processed packages of unrecognizable chemicals. Hey, wait a minute... Actually, I was just amused that whomever wrote this recipe felt pretentious enough to use Angolotti over ravioli, but was too lazy to look up what Angolotti was. I mean, do they not have food dictionaries or Wikipedia over there?

The flavors are delicious once it all comes together. Added a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon and sage. We found them delicate, which could easily come from our lack of experience making agnolotti/ravioli. Would love to master the technique, this would be a lovely first course.

Good- not great- even with a lot of tweaking. These were good and a fun activity with the kids since we made the pasta dough too but really, I've had better from the grocery when it comes to pumpkin/ squash pasta.

Keep in mind that 2 forks is good, but that's about all I would give this one. However...i did opt to roast a butternut squash instead of pumpkin, so my version was a little different. Personally, I don't feel as though wonton wrappers are a good substitute for homemade pasta. There just aren't the same. So, if you have the time, making your own pasta would really enhance this recipe if you ask me!

Pretty good. I was happy, though the other taster suggested the sauce was a little sweet - which I thought went well with the pumpkin. Other reviewers suggested nutmeg and cinnamon, which turned out to be very welcome additions to the mix. I suggest pairing with Sam Adams Winter Lager if available. The spices in the beer work very well with the pumpkin. I also suggest doubling this recipe if using it as a main dish.

I doubled this recipe, and it served 6 (including 2 hungry boys). I added nutmeg, smoked paprika, and a pinch of cinnamon - but felt that red pepper flakes might have kicked it up an extra notch too. Excellent easy recipe!

This was delicious, inexpensive, and easy! I couldn't resist adding a little nutmeg ...
