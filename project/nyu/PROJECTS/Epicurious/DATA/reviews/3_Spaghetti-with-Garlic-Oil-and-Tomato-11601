I doubled the sauce for a little over half pound of perciatelli and it was fantastic. Like eating in Rome!! Fresh parsley a must and if you can get San Marzano tomato puree, all the better!

This is a really quick and easy dish, I had no fresh parsley so I used dried instead. It still tasted good but next time I would use fresh parsley, it makes all the difference.

This was really delicious. I had something similar in a restaurant recently and really enjoyed it so I thought I would try this one to see if it was close and it was. The only thing I would do different next time is to make a little more!!!
