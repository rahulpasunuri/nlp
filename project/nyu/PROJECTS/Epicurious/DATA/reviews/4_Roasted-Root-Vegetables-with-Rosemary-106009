Question - Can these be made the day before and reheated? The oven space is taken on Thanksgiving. Thanks.

This was a wonderful recipe even though I made several adjustments to use the vegetables that I had on hand plus I forgot to add the garlic though I prepared it. Since I live alone I halved the ingredients. I did not use rutabagas, celeriac, parsnips, nor leeks. I did use instead celery, yams, beets and broccoli plus dried rosemary. I did have red potatoes, carrots, and onions. I also did cut down the amount of oil. I shared with neighbors and they also loved it. Next time I will add broccoli with garlic. I cut the cook time by 15 minutes. Seems like a lot of changes but it testifies to the creative possibilities with this super recipe. Will cook again and again after my weekly trips to the farmers market.

This is simply an OUTSTANDING recipe - skipped the potatoes and leeks and added in cauliflower and brussel sprouts - my family LOVED it - the deep flavors from roasting are just delicious. I'm enjoying leftovers at breakfast. MAKE THIS!!

Elegant in its simplicity. I used a large pot to roast the vegetables in. I forgot the potatoes, but it was excellent without them. I would suggest 30 minutes, then perhaps another 35 instead of 45 if you roast in the pot(uncovered). I am guessing they cook a bit faster. Still...a wonderful wonderful recipe. Thanks!

I made the recipe as written, but cut the oil to 1/3 cup and left out the leeks. The vegetables were just as I'd remembered them from a cooking class where the chef had made the same recipe. My family, who had never tasted rutabaga, parsnip or celery root, loved the dish. The only problem is it's really high in fat. I'd be curious to see if root vegetables are just as good slow roasted in 1 or 2 tablespoons of oil.

This is an excellent way to have a variety of vegetables at Thanksgiving or any other feast without having to make a lot of separate recipes. Most of the prep work can be done ahead of time, and the roasting is simple. Be careful about the timing, however. My vegetables were done about 20 minutes sooner than the recipe called for, and if I had left them in the oven the whole time, they would have been incinerated. Like some other cooks, I added fennel, butternut squash and baby beets. I also added halved cippolini onions instead of leeks. I didn't use the potatoes, as we were also having stuffing. I found some parsley root at the market, so I threw that in, too. The overall effect was fabulous.

I've made this a number of times and it is always a hit. Plus, it's a great way to introduce a variety of roots to people who aren't used to them. I usually don't include potatoes (because I am usually having them as their own side), so substitute beets or sweet potatoes. It's great with Thanksgiving dinner and you can use an assortment of whatever roots you prefer. As suggested by other reviewers, I used a little less oil and added the leeks when I added the garlic (and used extra garlic!). Make sure you cut the roots into 1" pieces- the first time I made this I thought that seemed huge and started making smaller pieces- they ended up overcooked. The rosemary is a nice touch!

I made this with baby potatoes, cut up turnips, baby carrots, cauliflower, onions and halved Brussels sprouts, lots of garlic, rosemary, thyme and salt & pepper. I also cut the olive oil down a bit. Roasted and kept turning till edges were browned and onions kind of caramelized. It is amazing! Great leftovers, too. Am making again for Thanksgiving.

This is probably an obvious recipe for experienced chefs, but I wouldn't have thought of it myself. Was wonderful. We got pretty much all these vegetables (except leeks, which I omitted since I didn't have any) in our CSA share, plus beets and yams, so I threw those in too. I have to say, this was totally fabulous and it also made the beets and yams (which I dislike because they are so sweet) super tasty!

Only used onions, carrots and parsnips because I didn't want to have too many leftover root veggies that I would otherwise not cook. Forgot to add the garlic; didnt affect the taste. Didn't think it looked that great, but tasted wonderful. Will make it again.

I found this bland compared to other veggie roasts I have made. I like roasted parsnips with ginger, etc,, Probably would not make this again.

Not only does this dish look amazing, it tastes great too. Used as a side dish for thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews. Followed suggestions for reduced olive oil (1/3 cup) which was more than enough. Also added the leeks at the same time as the garlic, and they were cooked perfectly. Next time, might cut the leeks up more, the big 1 in circles that you get when you slice as directed were kind of weird to bite into. I added a yam as suggested by another reviewer, and next time will probably use at least two. Also subbed turnips for the rutabagas, as I was unable to find the later at the store. Buying a bag of peeled baby carrots cut down on some of the work in peeling and dicing, I threw them in whole and it was totally work the extra $$

I made this for someone who requested sweet potatoes...made it with only parsnips and sweet potatoes. Turned out really nice, even ppl who usually don't like SP ate it up. Was in a rush to get it done with the turkey so used garlic powder instead of real cloves. Very tasty.

love it! this will be my 4th or 5th time making it this year!

This was delicious but I added beets, red peppers, and fennel to the mix for additional color and flavor. I also substituted red onion for the leeks and onion. Towards the end of the roasting time I tossed in several handfuls of dried cranberries. Other than that, I followed all instructions carefully! ;-) Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/review/preview/Roasted-Root-Vegetables-with-Rosemary-106009#ixzz13YiWncWw

This was delicious! I served it at a dinner party to rave reviews. Easy as heck to make, as well. A perfect alternative to run of the mill roasted potatoes. I paired it with braised beef, but would work beautifully with a simple roast chicken or pork.

Rating: 4
These were a delicious addition to Thanksgiving dinner. Next time, I might use slightly larger chunks. I also oversalted just a bit, which has never been a problem for me when roasting vegetables. I left out rutabaga because they're a pain to deal with and I was rushed.

Oh my God!!! This was so good. I decided to make it as a side dish for Christmas dinner and it knocked our socks off. I have never eaten rutabaga or parsnip before. Even some guests that weren't vegetable eaters loved it. I will definately be making this again!

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner. I have roasted vegetables, but not most of these root vegetables. All of us loved the side dish and guests wanted to take some home, but there wasn't much left and I wanted to keep it for my own, but I acquiesced . I think next time I will use half of the oil just for hearts sake. Delicious tasty and the 1 inch cubes made a big difference in taste. Try it you'll love it even if you hate veggies.

I prepared this recipe for a progressive dinner. It was perfect! I was able to prepare it ahead of time and finished the pork roast while other hosts provided apps and salad. I reheated the veggies while the roast sat and everyone loved them! Per thier requests, I have emailed out the recipe. I will definately use this again!

I made this for a dinner party with our neighbors the other night and it was a big hit. The vegetables came out perfectly and were absolutely delicious! It did take quite awhile to chop up all the veggies though.

Excellent, healthy, filling without being heavy. There is so much variety no other side dish is needed. This is easy to make. The indicated amounts serve way more than eight.

I really loved this recipe. You can be so flexable with it and really brings those winter warm feelings to the table.

Delicious and beautiful! I agree with rotating the pan for even cooking. These veggies work very well with the leg of lamb with rosemary. I also varied the vegetables with the leftover lamb: added butternut squash and fennel. Definitely a keeper.

Made this to accompany the beef tenderloin my husband was grilling for our family x-Mas dinner. (Gotta give the guy credit, we live in Wisconsin.) Everyone - even those who would not normally consider eating parsnips or celery root - raved about this dish. Very good and simple to make. Left out the rutabaga for the fussy ones, next time I will include that as well.

This dish turned out great. I will definitely make it again.

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I omitted the potatoes (both regular and sweet) because I was having them in other dishes. I used fennel and some butternut squash instead. I also took a reviewers' advice and waited to add the leeks until I added the garlic--great idea; I'm glad I did it. I can't wait to take the other reviewers' suggestions to turn the leftovers into soup!

I took liberties with the veggies; used butternut squash, yam, beets, parsnips, carrots, yukon gold potatoes, onions and garlic, roasted with rosemary. I have been roasting these veggies for years without rosemary, it was a nice touch. Adding the garlic later in the roasting was a splendid idea; instead of being rock hard, the garlic cloves were softened just right. I took the leftovers, boiled them in low salt chicken broth, blended them with handheld blender, thinned with nonfat condensed milk and had a delicious soup for lunch the next day.

Great recipe!Looked wonderful, tasted better than that! Served with an awesume prime rib, yet everone raved over the veggies, even those who had never had turnip or rutabaga. Also added sweet potatoe. Next time will use pearl onions so they don't fall apart. Will also add more garlic as people were fighting over the roasted garlic cloves.

I love this recipe! You can use any and all root vegetables.you can also use crushed garlic and mix it in. I also used olive oil instead of a vegetable spray. You can puree the leftovers in the blender and make a wonderful winter soup. I added leftover mashed potatoes for thickening and a can of chicken broth.

OK-just took these out of the oven for Thanksgiving dinner and I'm afraid they may not make it to the table! Used butternut squash, brussells sprouts, parsnips, carrots and fennel. Amazing.

This has become a winter favorite at our house. Delicious and easy! Good introduction to rutabagas and parsnips for those who were not lucky enough to have been brought up eating them!

Delicious! As far as my 63 year old Dad is concerned, there are 3 vegetables in the world: potatoes, tomatoes and green beans. I made this for Easter Dinner and I even my Dad kept going back for more parsnips and celery root. I nearly passed-out. This was very good.

Rating: 3
These turned out pretty good. I thought they were Ok, but everyone else raved. A great short cut is to microwave the hard items (potatoe, parsnip, etc) in a bowl of shallow water for 5-10 minutes so the final rosting time is cut in half.

My husband also can't stop talking about parsnips now. This dish is complex yet easy. It was a great accompaniment to my tenderloin for Christmas dinner. Beats the usual mashed potatoes any day.

Oh, yeah - roasting is what it's all about! Great complexity in flavor - provided a nice counterpoint to Epicurious's pork chops with apple balsamic sauce (and healthier than the recommended accompaniment of bleu cheese potatoes gratin). Yum!

This would be an excellent Fall dish especially at Thanksgiving. I added the sweetpotato but didn't have red potatoes so I used regular potatoes. It was still very good and even better the next day so it could be prepared the previous day for a holiday dinner.

If you can get past all the peeling, this is a delicious version of roasted vegies. My husband, who does not normally eat such things, enjoyed them. I did not find the fresh rosemary to be to strong but just right. The suggestion for a splash of extra oil was helpful.

I love this recipe. I made it last year for Thanksgiving at my bosses house and everyone thought it was delicious. The only thing to watch out for is the leeks drying out and shriveling. I'd say it would probably help to keep them out of the oven until you put the garlic in. Roots!!

ALthough I used very fresh veggies and followed directions, my veggies were shriveled and a little dry. My version made a very unattractive presentation - maybe it was just me. My family loves roasted vegetables, but this was a major disappointment. Thank goodness I decided not to make this dish for T-giving!

Delicious. Absolutely will make again. Suggest using only 1/3 cup of oil. The veggies seemed to "swim" in the 1/2 cup.

We had our family, 17, over for the English Menu dinner, and this was one of the favorite parts. I actually made it on the night prior, and warmed it through after taking the roast out while cooking the Herbed Yorkshire Puddings. The co-ordination is a little tricky, but it all worked. The family loves root vegies, so this was a no brainer, and the rosemary worked well. Nothing remained after.

Rating: 3
Really delicious. The rosemary is a must (ignore those who said to cut it) and not at all overwhelming. The real flavor comes from the different vegetables.

Rating: 4
This is one veggie dish I keep making over and ovre again and no one EVER gets tired of it. I cut the rosemary portion in 1/2 and add a bit dried oregano and some shitake and white button mushrooms during the last 15 minutes of cooking time. I also add a couple sliced yams to the dish. Yum, yum!

Rating: 2
I think the rosemary needs to be cut from this recipe. I love all sorts of roasted vegetables and this combo was good (except leeks tend to burn). I think next time I'll try it with whole cumin seed instead.
