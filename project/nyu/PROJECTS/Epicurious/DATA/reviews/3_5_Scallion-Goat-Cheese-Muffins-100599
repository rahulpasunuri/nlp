Great base recipe for savory muffins. I changed it around a bit to add some zing that was missing. I diced up a jalapeno pepper, used about 3/4 of the whole pepper. Added my diced jalapeno to the scallions but used less scallions than it asks for in this recipe (about 3/4 of a cup). I also substituted sharp cheddar instead of goat cheese and used about 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 6tbsp. Didn't bother adding the sugar that the recipe asks for. I mixed everything together--didn't layer as the recipe instructs, spooned the mixture onto 6 ramekins and baked them until golden brown about 30 minutes. The muffins were great. Nice cheesy, savory, with a bite due to the jalapenos and not too greasy. They're great the next day too. Just wrap one in parchment paper when you throw it in the microwave for about 27 seconds and it's steaming hot. Cut it in half with a top and a bottom. Put a poached egg and half of a bacon slice and you have yourself a nice breakfast sandwich.

These muffins are insane. They are so good, you can't stop eating them!!! I have to disagree with previous reviews that they lack "zing". They are quite "zingy" actually! They are very quick and easy to make, and so good. Also, I just wanted to comment about another review from a cook in Amsterdam: your mother is right; European butter, or even domestic European-style butter, do indeed have a higher butterfat content than traditional American butter. If you are using either, you need to adjust the amount of butter. I used Lurpak, which is Danish, and I cut the amount to 4 Tbsp. and the muffins were perfect. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Totally easy to make and very impressive to others. This is a great recipe for a grab and go breakfast!

This is my favorite thing to cook (and then devour) in the whole wide world. I make it exactly as written, and make sure the tops get golden before I take them out of the oven. The toothpick test obviously won't work here, since they are a filled with gooey goat cheese goodness!

This recipe works but I agree that these muffins lacked zing. I may try this recipe again with added dill and chives.

These mufins are very easy to make, and the smell... Yum!! Used dried scallion, it was all I had, but they taste very good... Made 9 muffins, I'll just have to make some more often!!

Overall the muffins came out perfect and none of it was swimming butter, but I found that the recipe really didn't have the certain zing that makes you want to keep or make it again.

I thought these were very good and addictive. I kept coming back to the kitchen to eat them. I served them with soup--it's a nice savory accompaniment.

I can't believe what a great response these muffins got... quite frankly I thought they were just horrible. I followed the recipe to the 'T'... and they were swimming in fat. Butter even pooled at the bottom of the muffin tray. You know, I live in Europe and my mother tried to explain that butter here is more fatty than in North America.... come on!!!! My rating... one star

These muffins were delicious. They were a great hit at my Sunday brunch. I think they would make a wonderful accompaniment to soup.

This is my favorite recipe I've found off epicurious so far, because scallions and goat cheese are two of my most favorite ingredients. While these are best right out of the oven, when reheated they also are a delicious alternative to bagels for breakfast.

My customers love these muffins. I add dill weed, garlic powder to taste and a dash of green food coloring to the cheese mixture and bake them off in mini-muffins cups. I pipe the batter [about 1-1/2 tsp.]and filling [1 tsp.] then fill with batter again to the top of the paper. Bake about 10 min. The job goes fast. Makes about 100 mini-muffins that freeze and reheat very well. Perfect Hors d'oeuvres.

These were quite good and we think they could be used at a variety of meals, not just for breakfast. We made them in a muffin top pan but probably would uses the traditional pan next time.

An excellent alternative to sweet muffins -- and an opportunity to use up leftover goat cheese! I wouldn't mix the cheese in as one reviewer did; it's nice to find the soft little cheese surprise in the center. In some, air pockets had formed. Anyway, very yummy, and no, you can't eat just one!

This was a delicious and different kind of muffin. The flavors are out of this world and you just cannot eat one. A must try.
