Always a favorite when I make it. A note on the tapioca: I don't use the quick-cooking, just small pearl tapioca, soaked in water for 1/2 hour or so.

Excellent blueberry pie. Made this on a vacation in Maine after a surprising haul picking wild blueberries. I don't like a watery pie, so I used 6 Tbs of Minute tapioca. It was not overly thick, so I'm glad I increased it per some reviewers. Taste was excellent, but that is up to the blueberries. I tried to weed out the less than fully ripe ones so it would not be too tart. Will make this again at Thanksgiving.

I got rave reviews on this pie. Perfect sweet/tart balance and FINALLY a blueberry pie that is not runny. The dough is flaky, but I did find it a little less flavorful than some of my other doughs. Still, a great pie! I'll be making this for the 4th of July.

This is excellent! The perfect balance of sweet and tart. After the first bite, I knew I would be making this again. The crust was light and flaky. So good.

Wonderful! I made it by the original recipe and then the next time changed it up a bit. I used 2T fresh squeezed lime juice and increased the Tapioca by 1T ... made it a little more firm and just a bit more tart.

This is a delicious pie. We substituted Splenda Brown Sugar Blend because my dad has high blood sugar, and used just 3/4 cup. It was perfectly sweet and everyone loved it. This will definitely be added into our favorite five fruit desserts!

I LOVED this pie especially with vanilla icecream. I used a whole lemon's juice instesad of just a tablespoon, and I used 4 tablespoons of tapioca instead of 5, with good results.

This is a really great blueberry pie recipe. I upped the amount of blueberries to 40 ounces and added a bit more sugar and tapioca and made two regular 9" pies. Highly recommend it.

It tasted great! It was a bit soppy with regular blueberries. Irecommend the wild.

Delicious! I used 5 1/2 T tapioca per the recipe suggestion for a thicker filling. Also reduced brown sugar to 1 c since my berries were sweet. Came out beautiful and tasted great.

I used frozen blueberries that had been picked recently from a local blueberry field. I made a smaller pie, halving the filling recipe. The pie flavor is sweet and really delicious. Maybe almost too sweet, but intense! No need for ice cream. Next time I'll add a bit more tapioca to thicken and slightly less sugar. It's really good though and I love that beautiful color.

This overflowed but it was very yummy and so easy to make!

To Elliott from Amsterdam - if you click on "Pastry Dough" in the above recipe, you will find the amounts. The is almost the exact recipe I have been using for 30 years. Wild berries are much more tasty than the large ones.

You forgot to mention how much flour for the crust. I would llike to try it with your recipe first.

Our wild Montana huckleberries are currently in season and I substituted them for the blueberries. The huckleberry is a distant cousin to the blueberry but with a much more tangy flavor. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup (almost always decrease the amount of sugar when I bake) and the result was great. I also used more tapioca because we prefer the texture of the berries to be more solid and it worked well. It was simple to put together and will be a repeat dessert for our summer huckleberries.

I think I will review the first reviewer's comments since I too have not made the recipe. Thinking that the recipe sounded good, I decided to take a look at it. I usually find the reviewers comments very helpful in either proceeding with making a recipe or not. Imagine my disappointment at reading the first review. I think it's time to re-commit to not writing reviews without trying a recipe.

Use 1/2 the sugar and this pie is beyond compare. I have many recipes for blueberry pies, grunts and other desserts, but this one compares with the best of them.

This pie is fair to midland. I personally do not care for wild Blueberries. I prefer the big plump juicy ones I pick in a near by field every August. You can make a delicious Blueberry pie from your usual blueberries :) It's all a matter of taste :)

I swore I would never do this, but... I have not tried this recipe, but I can tell from the amount of sugar listed that this will be way too sweet. The wild blueberry pie recipe I have (thank you Regan Daley and 'In the Sweet Kitchen') has the same quantity of fruit and only a half cup of granulated sugar, and it's delectable. Don't bother to make blueberry pie unless the blueberries are wild ones - the difference in flavour is immense. Giving a three-fork rating as some people like very sweet pie, and I don't want to skew the rating. Plus, it's virtually impossible to spoil good berries.
