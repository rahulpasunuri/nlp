I made only the tuna part, so I won't rate this. Despite my attempt to remove the tuna while still somewhat pink (less than 3 minutes), the fish was overcooked. I guess I could have removed it even sooner. However, that's an awful lot of olive oil to use and discard. I think searing the tuna in a little bit of oil would yield better results and less waste. I'd like to try the entire recipe with a few tweaks.

I made only the escarole mixture (not the tuna) and made several substitutions (onion for green onion and white beans for the lima beans) so I'm not rating the recipe. But wanted to post a comment because this made a delicious dish. Served it over wheat berries for a complete meal.

This was a difficult recipe to make.. I would like to try it again, to see if I get a better hang of poaching. The escarole/bean mixture was fabulous. I served this with a homemade risotto and that made a complete meal.

The oil-poaching works really well on fresh albacore tuna. My fishmonger had cut a 4 pound tuna into small filets for me, so I just used them with lime slices. Easy! I agree with the other poster that you should slightly undercook your tuna. The fish will continue to cook as it sits, and it is better if a little pink. I used it in a Nicoise salad. I won't rate the above recipe, since I didn't do the whole thing, but this is a great, easy way to cook fish.

I really liked the flavor. This was my first time poaching and I would make it again to have the practice. I wouldn't cook it as long as I did, and would leave it very pink in the middle. I like tuna more raw than cooked. Also, I used canned spinach and would use fresh next time. I think the overall dish was great and would make it again. It was a very filling meal, yet very light!!!
