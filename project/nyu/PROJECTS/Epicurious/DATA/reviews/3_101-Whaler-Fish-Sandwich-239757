Yummy as written. BUT, if ya want to jack it up a bit try adding some Old Bay to the cornmeal. Or use some hot sauce with the milk, or use buttermilk with hot sauce! The possibilities are endless. This is one great basic recipe. Use flounder, grouper or cod. BTW I think tilapia is yuk.

I am a novice cook and this was my first attempt at an epicurious.com recipe. It turned out quite well using talapia, but it was a bit bland. I look forward to future reviews of this recipe so I can perhaps learn some better spicing techniques.
