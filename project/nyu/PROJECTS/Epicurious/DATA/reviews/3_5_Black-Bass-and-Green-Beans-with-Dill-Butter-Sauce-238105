Yummers! This is ridiculously easy to make and oh-so delish! Like the other reviewer, I also used halibut (fillet). I used half the butter (more healthy) and I added a little bouillion to the sauce to richen. Tasty.....

I was pleasantly suprised at how good this was. Such simple ingredients, classic really. I used a fresh wild halibut steak (no black sea bass to be found) and egads, all I had on hand was a dry rose wine. No hint of sweetness in this bottle. It lent a beautiful color to the finished sauce...very faintly pink, beautiful with the dill and green beans. I will make this a regular dish.
