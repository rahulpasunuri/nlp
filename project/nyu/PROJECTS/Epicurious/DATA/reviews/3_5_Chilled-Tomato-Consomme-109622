This was divine,but labor intensive. I'd never used the raft technique before. I actually saved the raft and ate it for breakfast the next morning. (Sounds disgusting, but it was actually good and I didn't feel as if I had wasted so many of the ingredients involved with this soup.)

Somewhat labor intensive, but nonetheless delicious, and impressive to serve. There is a huge "oops" in the directions concerning the clarifying process. The consomme should be COLD when starting the raft, otherwise it will cook the instant it hits the hot broth, and nulify the clarification. Start broth cold, pour the raft mixture on top, bring to a boil slowly, then simmer until clear. You'll yield what is pictured on the recipe.

Okay - I was the first to review this recipe and tried it again. At this point in summer tomatoes are abundant and this recipe lets them shine. While labor intensive, the outcome is fantastic. Try it - you LOVE it!

Absolutely Delicious!!! Don't be afraid of the raft, it's fairly straightforward.

I was a little nervous about the raft part - but it turned out to be fairly simple. We skipped the "tomato salad" at the end and just ate the consomme as is and it was FANTASTIC! It would be good with chilled shrimp or maybe some fresh mozzarella...pretty versatile. We will most definitely make again!

While somewhat labor intensive, this recipe yields a delicious, lighter alternative to gazpacho in summer. I used 4 lbs of vine plum tomatoes, yielding 2 nicely sized portions. With larger tomatoes and smaller portions the yield might be closer to the recipe. Don't tear off the fennel fronds too early from the stalks, othewise they wither and don't float as nicely in the soup. Overall, delicious!
