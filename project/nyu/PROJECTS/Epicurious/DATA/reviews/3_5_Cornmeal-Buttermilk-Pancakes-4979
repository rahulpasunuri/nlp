Awesome! Not as heavy a corn flavor as our favorite corn cakes but a truly delicious pancake none-the-less. In fact, I prefer it to "regular" buttermilk pancake recipes I've used before. It's my new go-to recipe every time I find myself lucky enough to have buttermilk in the house! (added 1 tp vanilla and reduce the sugar to 1 Tbs)

Love making these easy pancakes for my daughter. I used about 1/3 cup cornmeal to make them less grainy, and 1/4 cup of the flour was whole wheat. Sometimes I'll sub skim milk for some of the buttermilk to make thinner cakes. I also have used stevia and brown sugar in place of some white sugar. They are still delicious.

Very good recipe. Less cornmeal-ey than I thought it would be, but still nice. Added in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and topped with some blueberries when cooking. Found it made 12 pancakes, not 10, even though I was measuring out .25 cup dollops.

these are awesome!!! i made one minor change: took away about half a tablespoon of sugar and added 1/2-1 tsp of molasses. next time i plan to fry up some bacon and add the bits to the batter. i think that will just take it over the top.

These were excellent. I added blueberries and ate them with a little lemon curd. I had to add about another 3/4 cup of buttermilk. This could be because I shook-up the buttermilk which creates a lot of air bubbles. I'm not normally a fan of buttermilk pancakes, but I like these.

These are just okay. They look pretty and taste okay, but you can't taste the crunch of the cornmeal at all so they just taste like weird regular pancakes. Needs a little more interesting whole grain blend with the white and the cornmeal.

These are the definition of comfort food! Try them with some sliced apples sauteed in butter and maple syrup.

These are the best cormeal pancakes ever! I have been searching for the right recipe for years. These have a fantastic texture and full flavor in contrast to many bland/thin recipes I have tried previously. They are wonderful with blueberries for breakfast and with a good cheddar cheese as a more savory treat (think South American arepas). I made two minor changes. I substituted one tablesppon brown sugar for one of the tablespoons of white sugar because I like the extra flavor. And the first time I made these I only had a cup of buttermilk so I used it and added 1/4 c lowfat plain yogurt. Since it worked so well (perhaps helping the thickness of the batter) I stuck with the combination when I made them again.

I substitute non-fat plain yogurt for buttermilk, and these come out just fine. I love the slightly sweet taste and crunchy texture. These are even better with bacon or berries (especially blueberries or blackberries). If you like corn and pancakes, this is a really good recipe!

I was looking for a good pancake recipe but didn't want to spend a great deal of time making them. Boy, did I find just what I needed! I read all the reviews before I got started, and with a few minor changes, these pancakes were delicious. 1/4 of the flour was whole wheat, I used only 1/2 cup of cornmeal (because 3/4 cup sounded so, well, corny). Also, I cooked them on medium-low heat to prevent burning. The result: This is my new favorite pancake recipe. Thank you!

This was great. Very quick to mix up and just unusual enough to be a nice change from regular buttermilk pancakes.

These turned out very well, despite a measuring mishap on my part. I accidentally added 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk, and had to ballpark additional quantities of the dry ingredients in order to make up for the mistake. I used stone-ground cornmeal and cake-and-pastry flour (was out of all- purpose) with good results. The batter kept well in the fridge for use the next day (it just needed a good stir). Yummy with maple syrup, absolutely decadent with some leftover cherry compote that I had in the fridge.

I actually made this recipe a couple of months ago when I still had time to cook in the mornings, and simply forgot to post a review. I made them the first time for my boyfriend who came to visit and they turned out delicious. They were fluffy, yet with a delectable crunch and texture. However, my siblings also decided to drop by (all 4 of them, all quite big eaters) so I had to whip up a second batch. This time I forgot to mix in the eggs with the wet ingredients, and had to add it at the end, which turned out to be a disaster. The dough was too watery and even though I added additional flour, they did not rise as well as the first batch and were not as fluffy. Still tasty though, just a bit brick-like. So I suggest following the recipe to the letter!

this was quite tasty, especially with added blueberries. makes a LOT too.

These were OK, but nothing special. The corn flavor was nice, but the texture wasn't anything to write home about. I guess for corn pancakes, I expected a somewhat more substantial texture. I might actually prefer these (sans sugar)to use for serving under a la king, a curry, gumbo or another such dinner-type meal rather than as a breakfast food.

Great recipe, although I had some problems with the pancakes burning before they cooked through, even on relatively low heat. It might just be my less-than-perfect stove, though. I followed a reader's suggestion and added some fresh grated ginger to the melted butter and syrup, and it gave a subtly interesting flavor that I would definitely repeat.

Just finished having these pancakes, which were absolutely delicious. We are pancake fans, and these are terrific if you're looking for a slightly different pancake experience. They're a cross between pancakes and corn muffins. We added blueberries, which made them even better. We'll DEFINITELY make this recipe again.

Simple and delicious. The cornmeal gives it a crunchy texture, but the pancake is still light and tender. Powdered buttermilk works well, so I always have the ingredients on hand. Highly recommended.

Yummy! These were a nice change of pace from normal pancakes; the cornmeal added a nice crispness. I added blueberries. I'd definitely make these again, maybe just plain next time or with a different fruit. :)

Man, are these great pancakes! I let the batter sit for 15 minutes before cooking and the cakes came out fluffy and golden brown. These would be great with some raspberries or blueberries.

I added rasperries to the batter, and it turned out well. They are very good bland as well.

These pancakes have a great texture -- a cross between pancakes and a corn muffin. I added blueberries into the batter and they were delicious. I think that any type of fruit would be wonderful with these pancakes. At first, I used all of the oil in the pan -- the cakes were too greasy so I poured our the excess oil and the cakes were still crisp and tasty. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe rocks! These are the lightest pancakes I've made in ages and everyone raved about them. Don't doctor this recipe up...it's perfect just the way it is.

Right up my alley. I soaked some dried blueberries in water and bourbon overnight and added them along with some chopped pecans to the pancakes as they cooked. We all loved them.

These were wonderful. I used Arrowhead Mills cornmeal, so they had a little bit of a "grain" taste to them. I also used butter instead of oil in the pan. Next time I'll try putting in some blueberries as well.

Wow, i've finally found a good cornmeal pancake recipe. The one in Joy Of Cooking is horrible...these were substantial without being mini-cornbreads. Darn easy to throw together, too. would be great with raspberries inside.

What I really missed with these pancakes was the cake-y mouth feel of regular buttermilk pancakes. The syrup did not soak into these pancakes. They were a bit dry and not fluffy.

Amazing! We L-O-V-E-D these pancakes. Special thanks to the cook who suggested lemon in milk because I also didn't have buttermilk on hand.

Ok! This one is to die for! I had no buttermilk so I took half and half and added about 1-2 tablespoons white vinegar to thicken it. Stellar! Easy peasy! Oh and its best with maple syrup heated in melted butter. Awesome. An afterthought. I would add a touch of grated fresh ginger to the syrup/butter. Gosh this is awesome. The best!

These are very good. I've made them twice in one weekend: once with butter, once substituting plain applesauce for the butter. Both were crunchy & light, a nice change from the usual. Good with syrup, divine with Trader Joe's organic raspberry spread. I bet they'd be amazing w/blueberries too.

Every weekend I make pancakes. I decided to try something new. These cornmeal pancakes were delicious. They had a pleasant sweetness just like cornbread but, lighter and fluffier. I would recommend these to anyone who likes to eat!!

I took Katie's advice and whipped up a batch in about 10 minutes. Definitely very easy to make, and yummy. For whatever reason, mine didn't get crispy on the edges, even though my skillet was plenty hot and I greased it. Any thoughts?

WOW! This was really fast, easy, and tasted great. Go make these now!

These were fantastic and so easy to make, especially on those lazy weekend days when you maybe sleep in late and need something fool proof. My husband said these were "awesome". I ate mine plain, but my husband had syrup with his. I love these. Will definitely make these often. The cornmeal added a great texture and crunch and they were light and didn't leaving us feeling bloated and nasty like some pancakes do. The cornmeal also added a nice color to the hot cakes. Awesome!

My family liked these pancakes, but said they like regular buttermilk pancakes better. I doubled the recipe, then added frozen corn, chopped green onion and cajin spices to the batter and made the pancakes to go with dinner tonight. Tonight I'll make some salmon and red pepper relish to serve layered on each plate. Red/yellow pepper relish recipe you can get if you go to search and type in: Herb and garlic crusted beef tenderlion with red + yellow pepper relish. ( that recipe is also delicios ). ENJOY!

GREAT RECIPE!!!!! I made it for football sunday and got rave reviews----and I made this recipe as waffles. I doubled the batch and made one half according to the recipe, and then with the other half I added crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese, and chopped anaheim chile pepper----AMAZING!!!! I couldn't stop getting compliments!

Very nice. Made them quickly for lunch for my family on the weekend and everyone really enjoyed them. There were several left and our grand children ate them throughout the day for a snack without anything on them. They were light and tasted wonderful. We will make them lots.

These were wonderfully light and slightly crunchy because of the cornmeal. I LOVE these pancakes, and have made them a zillion times. A favorite--kind of reminds me of the old Aunt Jemima pancake mix of my childhood (before they re-did it and made it into the thin, pasty mix that it is now).

Excellent. Might suggest adding 3/4 cup of canned corn kernels, drained

Wow!! I just threw away my bisquick. These were very good. The cornmeal gave it a very homey texture instead of the commercialized boxed mixes. I will definatly make these often on the weekends. I mixed some melted peanut butter in the syrup before serving. Yumm Yumm

I will never make another type of pancake again! These are wonderful. Not only are they full of flavor, but texture as well. Another thing I really liked about these was that I found them to be much lighter than your regular pancake, much less doughy which I liked. My husband, who is not a big fan of sweet breakfasts, loved these. The cornmeal really tastes wonderful. I was scared that it would make the cakes dry, like cornbread can sometimes get, but that wasn't the case at all. This will be a permanent part our breakfast recipes.

This recipe has become my signature dish, my husband and I love them. When my family comes to visit on weekends, I am always asked to make these pancakes. You need to have a good hot pan and avoid overmixing the batter. Enjoy!
