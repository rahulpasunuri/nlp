My husband who said he despises fruitcake said this cake is "out of this world"! I've had this recipe for a few years and was hesitant to make it because of the olives. I read the reviews and decided to try it this year. I did increase the sugar to one cup and added an additional egg, per previous reviewer comments. I also poked holes in the cake and brushed it with more Frangelico when I took it out of the pan, per another reviewer's advice. This cake is absolutely delicious - it's moist, tasty and has depth of flavor - a definite every year recipe from now on!

I always was a fruitcake-phobe... until this one. I loved the addition of the olives, and while it is a bit crumbly, it is still delicious! I made a number of loaves in November last year and wrapped and froze them. It's the end of April now, and I ate the last slice of the last loaf today, Just as delicious as fresh! I am sad that it's gone...

After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments to prevent the cakes from crumbling. I added one additional egg and increased the sugar to 1 cup. About 10 mins after taking the cakes out of the oven, I brushed them with an additional 1/3 cup of frangelico. Cakes turned out wonderful!

Like a previous reviewer, I also had a problem with the crumbly texture. However, people to whom I served the cake liked it, so I guess it is worth doing again.

Tastes really good, bit is crumbling when sliced. Have tried putting it in fridge. Maybe I need to chop the pistachios?

This is a wonderful recipe, although I rechristened it because most of the people I know hate fruitcake of any sort; the oil-cured olives are a brilliant touch. The bucheron cheese is an inspired pairing.
