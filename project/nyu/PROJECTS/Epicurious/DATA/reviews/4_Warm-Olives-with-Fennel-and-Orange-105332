Delicious. Even tentative olive-eaters loved these and everyone asked me for the recipe.

I just made this for a small party of four and everyon enjoyed it very much. My only critique of the recipe is that I would cut the olives in half before heating as they become difficult to place on a cracker or chip otherwise. It was very easy and literally takes about 5 miuntes to prepare start to finish. The flavors are very nice and the orange and fennel are a wonderful touch.

Absolutely yummy and incredibly easy. My guests loved them. I'm wondering if if I can prepare the olive mix in advance and nuke them to warm them up, especially if I need to bring an appetizer to a party? Would it matter if the olives were pitted or not?

Took this to the Gourmet Dinner Club finale. BIG HIT. The flavor is subtle but lovely. I soaked olives twice so they weren't not overly briney. Quick to make & delicious.

Oh for crying out loud! I just read my previous review and I spelled genius wrong. Great. At least I can cook well.

I am 'known' for my olives. If asked, I will admit that I got the recipe from Epicurious, but if no one asks, they just assume I am a culinary genious. Ha!

A delious alternative for olive lovers. Even my husband(a staunch olive avoider) liked it.

This recipe is very different. Anyone who likes olives will love this recipe. It has become a fairly regular appetizer offering when I'm entertaining.
