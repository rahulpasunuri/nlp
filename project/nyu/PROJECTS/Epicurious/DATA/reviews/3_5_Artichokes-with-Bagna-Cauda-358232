This was a delicious appetizer! I love artichokes and the bagna cauda was fabulous, A few small changes I made: I only used 1 large artichoke (which I steamed for ~30-35 minutes instead of boiling), and I made 1/3 of the bagna cauda- I thought it was a good amount. Also, I used anchovy paste instead of canned anchovies, since I had some in the fridge. I kind of guestimated the amount and tasted until I thought it was salty/fishy enough. Will definately make again.

Very tasty! It seemed to get better as the eating of the artichokes progressed. Delicious with the hearts!

Delicious but go easy on the anchovies to avoid a fishy taste. I used 1.5 oz of anchovies and thought that was too much.

Awful! The flavor of the Bagna Cauda alone was not bad, it was that it did not go together well at all.

Always was intrigued with a Bagna Cauda, but never been a big anchovy fan. Tried it, loved it. The flavor is amazing. With the artichokes this is a decadent, easy appetizer.

This is a keeper! Served with steamed artichoke for a starter this week and my husband threatened to drink what was left. Beautiful consistency and the flavors are truly beautiful together. I highly recommend this one!
