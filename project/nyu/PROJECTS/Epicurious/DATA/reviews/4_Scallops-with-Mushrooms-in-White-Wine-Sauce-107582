Delicious, if you dont want to use a ton of salt just for balancing you can put your scallop shell resting omm top of muffin tray openings and it keeps the balanced for broiling. I added a tiny bit of chopped pancetta to dish as well

OMG, this recipe is so easy and soooooo good!! I just happen to have all the ingredients after the holidays and thought I'll give it a try. To my surprise, this is one of the best dishes I have ever made and I plan on making it for one of my dinner parties as I know it will be a sure hit. I didn't use the scallop shells and opted for the ramekins and also I used panko bread crumbs instead of fresh and it still was wonderful.

This recipe brought me back to France. Every second of prep time was worth it! I followed the suggestions of earlier reviews, such as using vegetable stock instead of the water, and of adding a clove of garlic and 2 TBL of lemon juice to the wine reduction, to letting the roux cook longer to allow a nice, nutty browning and also allowing a bit more time for the reduction to make the thick sauce that is the hallmark of Coquilles St. Jacques. I also made everything in one pan until I poured the contents onto creme brûlée cups for broiling - this only added to the layers of flavor in the sauce. This is a keeper!

I host the typical Sicilian Christmas Eve feast every year, complete with the "seven fishes". About 5 years ago I added this recipe to my routine. It is outstanding. It is always greated with rave reviews and guests always request copies of the recipe. I highly recommend! You will not be dissapointed!

Having every thing chopped and ready is key to making this dish. Very rich. I left out the whole toasted bread but garnished the dish at the end w/parm regg at the end. Did not use ramkens or shells, I plated this over brown rice & diced tomatoes.

I would call this recipe pretty far from "Quick and Easy" however, the end result was delicious. Our scallops were too large for the ramekins we have, so I just plated them, spooned the sauce over, sprinkled the bread crumb/cheese mix on top and broiled them that way. Worked lovely.

Very tasty...I used evaporated milk instead of 1/2 cup heavy cream to reduce calories and also 1 Tab. lobster base - sause was creamy so I served over angel hair pasta. loved it!

My high expectations were dashed when I made this recipe. Perhaps I need to lower them a bit. I substituted chicken broth for water. I also added some garlic and lemon juice as per some suggestions that were previously written. Maybe I was a bit ambititous with the chicken broth. Anyway I wouldn't repeat making it the same way the second time around if I decide to do it again. It definitely does take much longer to prepare than was written. My wife liked this( rating it 3 forks ) but I think I may well try a different recipe next time. Procuring those 2 ounce ramekins was no easy feat. I failed to cut out the muscle tissue of the scallops.

Used dried porcini (including the water from the hydration) and it came out very good. everything else as described.

A bit too rich even without using cream (used 1% milk)or the butter on top in the broiler...would probably just serve the sauce and scallops plain over rice omitting the bread crumb parmesan topping. As others suggested I used clam juice instead of water. I might make it again differently.

Served this as a first course. It was fantastic with crusty bread. I added a clove of garlic along with the onion, which I actually replaced with a shallot. I used vegetable stock instead of water. I also pre-made everything in the afternoon and set up the ramekins, and then at serving time baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes before topping with breadcrumb mixture and broiling.

Awesome recipe.I didn't have ramekins so I cut the center out of artesan multigrain bread slices(oval)and toasted them in the oven.These made terrific containers for the scallop mixture.My family loved that the bread soaked up the extra sauce..mmm!

Great! But, not a 30 minute recipe! Lots of dirty pots and pans, made as instucted, wipes out your kitchen and took me over an hour, but flavor was wonderful. I think it could be simplified and still be as good. Would make again, with modifications.

This was not hard, but tedious to make and dirtied lots of dishes in the process. Tasted good, but I cooked it longer than directions and my sauce was still thin. Too much trouble for dissapointing results. Would not try again as written. Because of thin sauce I may try again over pasta as was suggested. Good creamy flavor.

These were amazing...and I used 2% milk instead of cream, cooked the mushrooms in pan spray, and didn't add the additional butter over the scallops. I served this over angel hair pasta with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the top.

Used the helpful tips from other reviews:Panko bread crumbs (did not bother pre-toasting them) , clam broth instead of plain water, kept the scallops in 1" chunks, why waste the impact of lovely large scallops. Agree - used 2 pots, 2 bowls, and the ramekins on a cookie sheet for broiling - lots of clean up! But...it's truly the sauce (butter, mushrooms, cream), scallops and the broiled crumbs/cheese topping combined which make this an elegant appetizer or entree. This is a weekend dish, when I have time to wash all the dishes!

First and foremost, this recipe and the resulting product was outstanding. However, I found the directions poorly written. Instead of saying cook roux for 2 minutes, how about, "cook roux until tanned and giving off a nutty aroma, about 2 to 3 minutes." In that way, there would be less misunderstanding. I took another writer's suggestion and added one garlic clove in the white wine reduction. I cooked the scallops whole for 2 minutes. Then removed, cut into fourths. I then strained the liquid and found it to be over 1 cup. So I added the scallops to the strained liquid and finished cooking them. That avoided overcooking the scallops, which is important. I placed the final product into shallow dishes and finished off in the broiler (under low setting so that the whole product was re-warmed). Excellant result. I made this for my wife on Valentine's Day and it was a real hit.

Rating: 4
Loved this dish. I added a teaspoon of "better than bouillon" chicken stock paste and a TB of lemon juice to the broth and that gave it a nice flavor. I also tried panko bread crumbs for the first time and omitted the dotting of butter before broiling. Served with basiled rice and glazed carrots for an easy but elegant Friday night dinner, but would be great for company as you could prep all but the broiling ahead of time.

Rating: 4
This recipe really was exceptional. I omitted the bread crumbs and added organic chicken broth in place of water. When you add water to a sauce, you are missing an opportunity to add flavor. I also added some shrimp poached in the same liquid. I too found that it took longer, about 20 minutes, for the sauce to reduce. I will make this recipe many times. It will surely become one of my signature dishes!

This turned out really well for us. The only adjustments I made were to use homemade chicken stock in lieu of the water, added half a lime (was out of lemons) and baked it all off in a large gratin dish for about 20 minutes, then broiled for 2-3 to brown. Oh, and I skipped the bread crumbs. I also probably reduced a little too much, but the ending sauce was really exquisite over pasta. If you want to simplify the whole process, you can poach and reduce in the same pot, strain into your measuring cup (4 cup was ample), then whisk up the egg/cream in the same cup, and finish the sauce in the original pot. I used one pot, one pan and a large measuring cup. Also, I made the whole thing in advance, put it in the dish and refrigerated. This would make good party fare if you don't have anything going on the day before company comes. I spent an hour assembling the dish and about a half an hour making sides/pasta/salad. Not to bad. I'd highly recommend!

I have made this twice now, and think it is good. I added lemon to the cooking liquid the second time, and do think it improved the dish.This second time I also served it over angel hair pasta, and my husband really liked it.I will make it again. I agree that the preparation time is more than an hour, but none of the steps are difficult.

This is very rich, bit very bland. the only thing I did not add was the bay leaf, subbed dill for it, and taste was still very very bland. added lemon juice when simmering also. Would not make again. mOnly good thing was garlic spinach and the tasted crumb topping.

I rated this 3 forks; it was okay, but extremely rich (too much so, in my opinion), and I used less butter than the recipe called for. I added lemon to the sauce for cooking the scallops, and I could tell that the lemon added a lot. Also, I used a shallot instead of an onion (again, I think it improved the taste). We won't make again-- it tasted all right, but was certainly too much effort for the end result.

This was great! It does take longer than an hour to make. Easily double that time. Also, I added garlic to the onions and did not strain the sauce. It was wonderful with everything left in. I put this in an 8 x 8 pan and baked it at 350 for about 15 min and served over pasta. Another note, it took 30 minutes to reduce the sauce, not 8-10 min. Excellent.

I added a sprig of tarragon and 1/2 lemon to the broth. Removed the broth from the heat, and let it sit a minute or two before adding the scallops so they would barely poach in the liquid to prevent over cooking. I made the entire sauce recipe but only used 12 ounces of scallops, and it seemed like a good ratio.

Maybe we're spoiled. I dunno...I am an experienced cook, and this dish disappointed us. My husband and I rate new recipes on a 1-5 scale, and we only gave this one a 3. I followed this recipe prescisely. Following the mise en place method, every ingredient, pot and whisk was ready before the first burner was ignited; however, although the scallops were moist and tender, the overall result was unattractive and semi- pastey.

4 forks with a caveat- Do add Lemon Juice to the white wine/onion sauce before reducing. I added about 2 tablespoons. Save youself some dishwashing by using the same pan that you used to sautee the mushrooms-to also make the cream sauce. I did use non-fat 1/2 and 1/2-I found it to be good. Do use a casserole dish-add all ingredients and bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Next time- I plan on using phyllo dough instead of the bread crumb/romano cheese mixture. All in All, a very tasty dish. I served it with Coconut Milk Jasmine Rice and boiled asparagus, with lemon. As well as a good crusty bread (part of which I used to make the breadcrumbs).

Served it with roasted sliced rosemary potatoes, asparagus sprinkled with romano cheese, and fresh greens with walnuts and Pink Lady apple chunks. It got rave reviews!

I sneakily ate several of them myself and the sauce is wonderful..brings out the sweetness in the scallops and is so creamy and decadent.

This was my first attempt at such a sophisticated recipe and it was a smash/everyone was raving like I was Wolfgang Puck or something. Although being the boozehound that I am I added some sherry cream a little more flour and topped it with puff pastry after I broiled it w/ the bread crumbs and cheese, I cooked the pastry with and egg white mixture solo and placed it on top. I garnished with huge lilies, it was beautiful and delicious to the last drop.

The very tastiest dish I have ever made! This was my first attempt at a complicated sauce - and it was worth every step and dirty dish. Simply divine. Served as a main course, in 1-cup ramekins. The sauce was ample enough to have served the scooped-out ramekins over pasta - but I'm afraid that would have watered down the amazing rich flavor.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent dish! I have made it many times -- as appetizers served on the shell as well as an entree served in ramekins. Most recently I doubled the recipe and served in 5 inch ramekins. Then instead of topping with bread crumbs, I placed a square of puff pastry over the top before placing in the oven. (I just used the Pepperidge Farm frozen stuff.) It was magnificient! Definitely one of the best recipes I've encountered. Many steps, many dishes... but worth every one!

Rating: 4
This was excellent- no complaints at all. It made 4 x 1 cup ramekins. I also made angel hair pasta and spinach and it was a good match. Personally I would dbl the recipe and give indiv. servings for 4 of the pasta with the scallop recipe poured on top as a main meal (as we're bigger eaters) with a side of spinach (or asparagus). Will definitely keep this receipe

Home Run! My fiance and I have had a running battle over scallops. They are my favorite. But seafood, especially scallops, are not high on his list. I have tried a good 6 recipes from this site: I loved them, he was so-so. I made this pretty much as written--did add a touch of white wine vinegar for an edge. I did stack the deck a bit by adding more mushrooms and making parsleyed buttered noodles on the side. I'm a hard sell, but...Yum--I'll do this again!

I made this for my husband for Valentines Day. Because I like scallops to have that little bit of yummy browning on them, I quickly sauteed them over fairly high heat in 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil. Everything else was pretty much per the directions, and it was scrumptious, especially the sauce! Because it was taking longer than expected, I did cheat a bit and used pre-made breadcrumbs. Still good, but I will make my own next time. And there will be a next time! Served with some creamy polenta and fresh green beans.

I made this for Valentine's Day last night as a main course. Both my boyfriend and I thought it was the best scallop dish we had ever had. It took longer than 30 minutes to prepare, though. I made it in an 8x8 casserole dish, and used the vinegar. My sauce was a bit thick, I think I reduced the liquid too much, but it was still wonderful, and the breadcrumb topping made it scrumptious! A keeper for special occasions!

I went with the previous recommendation of adding 2T white vinegar, taking out 4T of the butter and also baking in 8X8 pan for 10 minutes at 350. Yum, yum. This is definitely "restaurant quality" food and is not that messy if you plan everything out ahead of time. We served it over angel hair pasta with a side of garlic sauteed spinach. WOW! What a dinner. We are freezing the leftovers as suggested. Hopefully it will be as good the second time.

My very picky, spoiled husband said that this recipe was over the top! And I agree. Can't wait to serve it to guests.

Excellent! Restaurant caliber! Takes some time and fills up the dishwasher, but well worth it. Don't cut corners on the sauce steps--I was tempted but restrained myself and the end result was wonderful. Timing on steps is perfect.

This is similar to my Coquilles St. Jacques, but in my recipe I make a rich heart-deadly gruyere cheese sauce and two pounds of bay scallops. The wine, the bread crumbs, the seasonings are similar.

Excellent dish. I doubled the quantities for a main course. Tip is to add the flour to the mushrooms (gives a lovely pungent flavor) omitting the egg yolk completely - reducing the liquid (with the mushrooms), roux, and cream even further (the longer you leave it the deeper the flavor). Cooking ahead is the best way to make this dish.

We used wild Alaskan scallops and cooked it in a casserole dish and it was GREAT! While others fretted about the triple by-pass sauce, we Alaskans have to "bulk up for the winter" so I would double it (perhaps bathe in it). It reminded me of a rich stroganoff. Will definately make this again.

This is one of the best recipes I've come across in a long time. I used romano instead of parm -- I like its bite. I also cooked it in a casserole dish as another reviewer previously wrote and it was wonderful. I didn't use small mushrooms sliced that much -- I love the taste of mushrooms so I used regular white button mushrooms sliced in the good old egg slicer. I also cut down a little on the salt -- this recipe tells you to season and/or add salt all over the place. I used the suggested amt with the mushrooms but cut back in other places. I guess "to each his own" ... MMMmmmmmmmmm this was so good, I'm just kicking myself that I munched on bread while preparing it and was full rather quickly. But now I have leftovers for dinner tonight.

In the past month, we have made this recipe twice as a main course. The second time, the phone rang right before putting the dish into the broiler, and it sat for 45 minutes.

Over the years I've collected many recipes calling for sea scallops or for a version of Coquilles St.-Jacques. When I served this version tonight, my husband and I were astounded. It's really THE BEST. I think to obtain the very best results you should use the best ingredients called for--especially the Parmigiano-Reggiano. I also used Turning Leaf Chardonnay from a new bottle I had on hand. The only change I made to this recipe was to turn it into an entree--we don't entertain with "first courses" any more--and placed everything in a one-quart Corning Casserole dish to broil in the oven. As a main course, I served it with a green salad, the rest of the baguette, and a garlic-oil spaghetti dish. The scallops were rich and wonderful. I have no idea how the end results would change by making everything ahead of time as an indicated option, but I think I'll try it next time. This recipe is a real winner.

This has become part of my permanent file. I look forward to trying some variations, including adding crab as another cook suggested. I did use shells to bake/serve it in, but they were too shallow for the amount of sauce and I had some spillage. Next time I will either thicken the sauce slightly (more like the roux in The Joy) or use deeper serving dishes.

Wowsers! A real "Golden Oldie"! I haven't had or made Coquilles St. Jacques for many years and I had forgotten how delicious this dish really is. As I recall, this was often presented with mashed potatoes prettily piped around the rim of the shell dish, then dusted with paprika - also prevented the sauce from bubbling over the edge. It used to be a staple in fine restaurants, along with Lobster Newburg and Lobster Thermidor. Alas, we rarely see those dishes on menus anymore. Managed to find my scallop dishes (exactly like the photo) packed away along with my fondue pots, deep fryer and escargot dishes/tongs (haven't used any of them for years!), so I just had to make this for "old time's sake". A truly excellent scallop dish - rich, flavourful, pretty to look at and laden with calories! A guilty pleasure indeed! Thanks for the memories Epicurious!

This recipe is FABULOUS! I couldn't find scallop shells, so used ramekins. It makes a lot of sauce and my guests were dipping their french bread in it to get every last drop! An absolute hit at my dinner party. I, too, used Vermouth, but I always do. . .never white wine. . .an old Julia Child recommendation.

It was pretty simple and very rich. I used vermouth because the white wine I had was too fruity and added about 1/4 lb of crab.
