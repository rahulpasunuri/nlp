Very flavorful and delicious for how simple it is. Instead of boiling the tomatillos, I cooked them in a cast iron skillet until blistered and soft.

Definitely plan to make this again - and again! Easy, delicious, adds just the right amount of punch to the squash enchilada dish. I plan to try on other dishes as well.

Delightful!! I used no-salt veggie broth, and it was marvelous. Put it on the squash enchiladas from this site and they made my day!

Add sour cream (enough to thicken to your taste) and it tastes awesome on pulled pork, bean and cheese, shredded chicken, or beef burritos.

Having never cooked with tomatillos before, this was an easy demystifyer. This is a great sauce; so easy and so delicious. I have been using it for about a week on everything: chicken, ground beef, and it's not too hot for kids - very flavorful. For some reason the jalapeno loses its ferocious bite, but infuses the flavor. Fab!

I have made this recipe several times. My husband is a big fan of tomatillo sauce and thinks this is better than what we've had out on the town. If you don't like squash, try it with chicken and green onions.

try this with roasted tomatillos for a deeper, more complex flavor. also: this is uncanny, but if you have an authentic mexican mocajete (large mortar & pestle) and if you grind your chile and onion in it separately, then crush your tomatillos in it, (don't wash in between) the flavor is awesome. A well-seasoned mocajete helps.
