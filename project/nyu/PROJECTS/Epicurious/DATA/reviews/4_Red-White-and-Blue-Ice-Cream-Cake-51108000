Forgot to mention that premium ice cream is a must. I used Ben & Jerry's.

This is a fabulous recipe especially when the fruit is in season. I would definitely follow the recipe as written--you do not want to add the cornstarch after the raspberries are put through the sieve. It will thicken up beautifully in the fridge. I would also recommend chilling the cake before cutting the layers--much easier that way. Use the toothpicks as a guide. Made this for a party and it was a big hit! Could really make this with a variety of fruit and it would turn out great.

OK! I was a little scared to try a recipe that no one else reviewed but decided I'd go for it! OK: The cake--just moved and the baking power didn't make the trip so I used all baking soda but reduced the quantity. My three layers definitely didn't look as thick as the picture so I figure that's why. The blueberry layer: was worried about lumps of whole blueberries but it turned out fine. May use imersion blender next time to get one even layer. The raspberry layer: was concerned about adding the cornstarch before forcing through the sieve and next time I would definitely add the cornstarch AFTER straining. Felt like I threw so much of it away with the seeds! Assembly is a bit putsy but did the cake and assembly of layers one day and the frosting the next. The whipped cream was nice, might add a little lemon zest or some liquor next time. The fresh berries on top were SO good. This cake is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.
