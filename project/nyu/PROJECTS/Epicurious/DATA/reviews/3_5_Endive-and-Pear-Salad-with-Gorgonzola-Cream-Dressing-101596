I thought this was pretty tasty. I prefer a similar recipe from this site "Romaine wiht roasted beets and roquefort dressing" that is much better. To me, it needed more honey. I will probably make this again at some point.

Delicieaux!I had to substitute baby lettuces for the endive (store was out) and candied almonds for the hazelnuts (personal preference). Then added diced granny smith apples and dried cranberries for a bit more texture. It was a huge hit, the plates were practically licked clean. I made it for Christmas dinner and will be making it again on NY eve for a different crowd.

Fantastic! I modified this and served as an appy on my Chirstmas Cocktail Party Buffet table. I prepared the pears with some endive in a small dice, added red grapes (quartered) and spooned in to endive leaves and topped with cream, nuts and chives. Made dressing and cream in am, prepared balance right before serving

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I too add mesclun mix to the endive and after making a trial run of the dressing, I did not add the yogurt the second time. I did add a little pomegranate balsamic and either way it was delicious.

Substituted mesclun mix greens since endive was not available and also added dried cranberries for additional flavor and color. The result was wonderful! The two dressings work beautifully together, though I do think it's important to note that the Gorgonzola dressing was extremely bland when I first made it (early in the day, several hours before serving). It clearly needed some time for the flavors to meld, so I'd definitely recommend making it ahead of time. I also added to it a teaspoon or two of good quality balsamic vinegar, which gave it quite a bit more depth. Very vesatile recipe that would be great with other additions, substitutions, etc.

This is a great fall salad. We served it with a barbequed beef brisket and some roasted veggies.

Great and very elegant [although a bit 'pale']-- substituted apples and walnuts for pears and hazlenuts and it still worked out nicely.

I made this dish for my annual holiday party and it was gone in a flash! I placed a slice of pear in each endive leaf and then added the dressing so it had a "finger food" look (though a bit messy). My mother, an excellent cook herself, raved about this for MONTHS afterward.

Too much work for a salad that is nice, but not great.

LIked the salad, loved the dressing. I made the dressing hours in advance so that it could sit and teh flavors could blend. The cream dressing is even better days later if you are a blue cheese fan.

This needed something else, not sure what. Perhaps more "substance" to the salad, maybe more fruits and vegetables. Part of my problem though is that I like to make "main dish" salads and this definitely wasn't one!

I never got to taste this dish because I served it stuffed into endive leaves for a party, and it disappeard as soon as I brought it out. People really loved this - it looks and sounds decadent. I would definitely make this again, based on the reaction I got alone.

Easy and delicious! I used only 3/4 cup gorgonzola and a little extra vinegar for the dressing. Also, I used candied walnuts instead of hazelnuts and everyone raved about them. This recipe served only 4 people and I'd double the amount of greens for 6 or 8 guests. This recipe is a keeper!

We really wanted to give this recipe 3.5 forks. It was an excellant salad. Not many salads are this good. However, my husband decided that he would get tired of it if he had to eat it all the time. Therefore we did not want to give it the highest rating of 4 forks. We save that for dishes truely beyod compare. Definitely a great salad for a special meal.

This recipe turned out fantastic! It was thee favorite at a recent dinner party. I used packaged greens rather than what the recipe called for. I served it with breast of duck and steamed baby potates and pinot noir. What a hit! I will definately make again!

Sorry, but I didn't care for the recipe. I found the endive too bitter, it needed to be cut with another type of green. I've had better.

My family enjoyed this salad at our Easter dinner. I doubled the pears it called for as they add a lot of flavour. I also cut back a bit on the cheeze so the dressing wasn't as strong as the recipe called for. It was still very flavourful.

We made this salad for a potluck and it was the hit of the party. We've made it three times now in the last month for different groups of friends and family and it has always been very popular. Note: Make sure to use BELGIAN endive.

We made this salad for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I used a mix of endive and field greens.

Great recipe! Substitutions: I used non-fat yogurt and sour cream, pistachios and green onions because I had them. I also allowed the endive and pear to sit in the oil, vinegar, & honey until we were ready to serve.

The alternate sweet-sour and creamy tastes of this salad give it a high rating. The pears and blue cheese are so yummy together! I especially liked how the belgian endive still stays crisp after being in the marinade. I would use the recipe for the blue cheese dressing elsewhere -- so simple, yet so yummy! This recipe is a definite keeper!
