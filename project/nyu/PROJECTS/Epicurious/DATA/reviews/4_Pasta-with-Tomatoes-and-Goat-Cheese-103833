This was a great dish for a weeknight. Very good flavors. Like others, I used olive oil and garlic. I had pasta water at the ready, but did not really need it. I liked the consistency with just the tomato juices and the goat cheese. I would use even more cheese! I disagree with the recipe writer - I think a tangier cheese would be even better. And I only used about a pound and a quarter of tomatoes. That was plenty. But you can add just about anything to this pasta and it would be good.

There are just too many truly wonderful pasta recipes out there to give this one 4 forks. The goat cheese, even with reserved pasta water added, does not make a "sauce", but sort of coats everything. Tasty enough, and easy to make, but not a recipe I will come back to again and again.

Other reviews were helpful, especially the suggestions of red pepper flakes and crushed garlic. I also added crumbled bacon and omitted the basil since I didn't have that on hand.

This was delish! I did save a little of the pasta water, which I'm glad I did. It was a little dry with just the cheese, so about a quarter cup helped lighten it up a bit. But it was fresh, fast, easy and a lovely summer dinner. I'll definitely be making this regularly.

Very tasty! I let the tomatoes soften in extra virgin olive oil and garlic as suggested so I would have a bit more liquid. A nice, light quick dinner for summer weekdays.

I warmed the tomatoes and some crushed garlic in olive oil, then added the hot pasta, olives, and arugula. I then added the goat cheese to some reserved pasta water and stirred until a creamy sauce developed. I added this sauce to the pasta and tomatoes along with freshly ground pepper and crushed pepper flakes. Yummy!

Pretty good, but not really more than the sum of its parts. Used very tasty organic cherry tomatoes. The basil I used was a little bland -- organic probably would make a big difference. Originally I forgot the olives and the first serving was very blah; I added them to the remaining dish -- made a huge difference. Don't forget the olives!

I made this recipe almost as written, but used other reviewers suggestions of adding garlic and red pepper flakes. Instead of just salting the tomatoes, I also added 2 cloves of garlic, pepper flakes and the kalamatas. I also needed about a 1/4 cup of the reserved cooking liquid to get a nice sauce consistency. This recipe was so simple and delicious - perfect for weeknight cooking!

This dish was exceptional, especially considering how little time it took to prepare. Like another user recommended, we used about cup of the pasta water to allow the goat cheese to melt before adding it to the pasta. We also sauteed some garlic and sliced portobello mushrooms for some added flavor (which was a nice flavor, but certainly not necessary)

Really loved this! I also added arugula and a bit of olive oil. It was simple, tasty and pretty. Teens loved it.

Good easy recipe and nice way to use garden tomatoes if you are lucky enough to have them. I didn't have olives, but I added 2 cloves of garlic, a few handfuls of arugula, chopped toasted walnuts and red pepper flakes as previously suggested by others. You could also add some chicken for a very complete meal.

I love this recipe and have made it quite a few times. Always a hit! Really easy and quick. I used diced, canned tomatoes this time around because fresh tomatoes are not in season, and it was still delicious. I put in some (but not all) of the juice from the tomatoes to thin out the goat cheese sauce a bit.

Fresh,colorful and easy but not amazing. Given the cost of the ingredients, I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Delicious and easy. I recommend Kalamata olives stuffed with garlic if your grocery store has them.

Couldn't be easier and so, so tasty. I added 2-3 handfuls of arugula to the mix at the end which added nice color and flavor then like others red pepper flakes, one minced clove of garlic, and an olive oil drizzle.

On the tail end of a cold/flu and in need of a quick, easy, satisfying meal, I whipped this up with ingredients in the fridge, minus the fresh basil. It was delightful and I'll make it again in a few days when my sense of taste returns and I'll have a nice glass of wine with it.

Delicious and fast. I have switched the cherry tomatoes for orange and yellow peppers, due to some kids not liking tomatoes, and it was great!

This is a great recipe. I used orzo pasta, and added cream, olive oil, and a clove of garlic to the goat cheese. I'll use orzo again -- its smaller size is a good contrast to the tomatoes and olives.

I have been making this dish for years without this recipe - I strongly recommend it. Throw in a few tablespoons of minced garlic, heavy cream, and olive oil for a meal that you will make over and over again.

I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. It is very tasty and easy. I used goat cheese that was already rolled in herbs which gave it a nice bit of extra flavor. This one is going to be in our regular rotation for sure!

Really good. You can add asparagus or a bag of frozen spinach to the boiling water in the last minute of pasta cooking and drain together with the pasta - a nice way of upping the vegetable quotient. A little heavy cream extends the creaminess of the goat cheese, and black pepper and grated parmesan or romano are good additions at the table. Easy, adaptable to what you have in the fridge, and delicious.

Very good, quick and easy! I didn't have enough as many tomatoes as recommended but still came out extremely well.

Brilliant. I absolutely loved this dish. It was quick and tasted wonderful. My husband wants to try it again this week with prosciutto.

I was skeptical as I only had a very strong goat cheese and was worried it would overwhelm. I ended up using a just a small amount and added it after the pasta cooled slightly. It didn't really melt but crumbled instead. I then added the rest of the ingredients (the juice from the tomatoes was all it needed for liquid) including some toasted walnuts, warmed it up again before adding the basil. It turned out fabulous! Wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe is delicious and simple to make. It was a big hit with my family and now I'll make it for my daughter's graduation party. Can hardly wait...I think everyone will be crazy for it.

Tasty and quick. A very fresh and Mediteranean flavor. I increased the amount of goat cheese by half and added some pasta water to get the goat cheese spread over all the pasta.

This was good, but needs a bit of doctoring. I encountered the problem of the goat cheese becoming thick and gluey. I reserved some pasta water and added it back in, and that seemed to do the trick. This also could use a kick - I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes, a few splashes of balsamic vinegar and a very light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. That seemed to fix it to my tastes; next time I'll also try adding artichoke hearts.

I happened to have goat cheese and basil in the fridge, so I dedicded to make this dish. I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used vine-ripened, and I didn't have olives either. I added 1/8 cup olive oil and 1 tsp red wine vinegar to the tomato mixture and then put it in the microwave while the pasta was cooking. It's a good thing I added some more liquid to the recipe, because when I mixed in the goat cheese with the pasta, it became very dry and gluey, and all the pasta started to stick together; the oil and vinegar made it more like a sauce. However, I think next time I'll use a strong goat cheese, because this tasted more like a cream sauce than a goat cheese sauce.

I made this dish as an appetizer, and not one single bit was left - they were scraping the dish!I had at least 3 friends ask for the recipe and they still rave about it.

This went over ok at my house, but it didn't get the rave reviews that some of the other recipes garnered from this site received. That may be because I used substitutions for nearly everything! No cherry tomatoes at the grocery store, so I used vine-ripened tomatoes. The goat cheese was outrageously expensive, so I used good old feta instead. My husband despises olives, so I left them out all together. Everyone enjoyed it, but nobody said, "wow!" I found it way, way too bland. Because it was so incredibly easy to make, I'll probably make it again, but with some added spice (and olives when my hubby's out of town!).

The dish was great. I carmelized some Vidalia onions with a touch of balsamic vinegar and added them in with the goat cheese.

Great Recipe! I substituted sheep milk feta for the chevre, and it was fantastic. Highly recommended

Quick, easy and tasty are three words that go well with this dish. I made it for a gang of friends and they gobbled it up--great suggestion about warming the cheese.

This was a great recipe. Very easy to make, and looks great with multi-colored tomatoes. Be careful about the quality of your olives. The last batch I used weren't cured so well, and it made for an odd flavor in the dish. As well, if you're from NYC, I recommend the goat cheese from Ronnybrook Farms (I know you can get it in Chelsea Market). It's very soft and very mild. Enjoy!!

I just tried this one last week and am making it again tomorrow night. It's a great easy, quick and delicious recipe. And I agree that warming the goat cheese before is important (while I'm warming the serving bowl in the oven, I put the cheese in as well. It works just right). And, since the recipe is so simple, it works best when you have really good ingredients. My husband loved it too.

The recipe was extremely easy to make. The short prep time and few ingredients needed make it a great quick afterwork dinner. However, next time I would either warm the goat cheese first or mix it with a bit of the pasta cooking liquid. Adding cold goat cheese cooled the pasta too much. Otherwise, it had great flavor. My husband loved it.
