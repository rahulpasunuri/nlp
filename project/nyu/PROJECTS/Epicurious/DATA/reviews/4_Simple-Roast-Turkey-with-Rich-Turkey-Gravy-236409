I've used this basic recipe twice and both times the turkey cooked in less than 2 hours...if the bird is truly at room temp when you start, check for doneness early.

This worked out very well, although after reviewing comments. I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees for 3 hours as was recommended by butterball for a 14 lb bird. I roasted the bird upside down in an open roasting pan unstuffed the first hour. After turning the bird I rubbed a stick of butter on the breast an legs every 45min or so. After two hours, the breast was browning so I covered the breast with foil. At this time the thermometer read about 140 degrees so I figured I was right on track. The only other thing I changed was the water. I started with one cup but with evaporation, I added another, then two more. It worked great. I used no seasoning except in the stockpot with the hart, gizzard etc. The butter stick I used was not salt free. I was a little short on the liquid for the gravy so I added one can of Campbells condensed chicken broth with one can of water. At the end of three hours, the thermometer read 180 degrees it came out perfect. Yippy!

The best moist turkey I ever made. The breast was a little pale. so I increased the Heat to 450 for 30 min. The breast and legs exceptional good.

I made my first roasted turkey this year using this recipe. It worked out exceptionally well, but I made some changes: I used my convection oven to "convect roast" a 14 lb turkey, it took just shy of 3 hours to reach 170 degrees in the thigh. I added extra stock (about 1.5 cups) to the pan to counter any extra evaporation from the convection. I cooked the bird breast-side down for most of the time (flipped it for the last hour) to keep the breast meat moist. I used wooden skews instead of metal. And I stuffed the bird with a sliced peeled orange, a sliced onion, and a bunch of fresh sage sprigs. I kept the bird covered with foil for most of the time for fear of over-browning, but I think it could have let the bird get much darker and it would have been OK. I winged it on the gravy but I wish I would have followed the recipe as mine turned out bland.

Something we have done for the past few years is roast the turkey in a countertop roaster, upside down, then transfer it to the oven for the last half hour for browning. It keeps the oven free for all the sides, and gives us a moister bird because it's cooking in a smaller space. Brining or dry brining (see Alton Brown) is mandatory.

We made our very first turkey using this recipe. It was a 35 pound bird for a large family gathering. It came out great in just over 3.5 hours. Everybody loved the gravy too.

Excellent and straightforward recipe. Our turkey has required less cooking two years in a row, though. This year, a 16 pound turkey was done in 1 1/2 hours.

Certainly, this is very straightforward - and a good beginner's turkey. I'm a pretty competent cook, but I hadn't hosted Thanksgiving before yesterday, so it was a good starting place. BUT - my turkey was overcooked at 2 1/4hrs - it was just over 14lbs. Right away, the thermometer measured 190 in the thigh, close to 180 in the breast. I hadn't used a thermometer before -- should I have tested earlier? I didn't want to be opening the oven constantly - though it did look to me at about 2hrs, or a little less, that the skin on the thigh was getting overly taut & dry. I'll check my oven temp to see if it's running too hot - but any other tips?

This really is a fail-safe way to cook a turkey. It's quick and our bird was very tender. Taking the turkey out of the oven when it reaches 170 is brilliant. I always cook poultry at a high temp and always get the same juicy, delicious result.

Haven't roasted a turkey for awhile since we were deep frying, but didn't have a fryer this year. This was great -- moist and even on the inside, crispy and well colored on the outside. Cooked an 11lb turkey for ~1 1/4hr. Did put 2 halved oranges and some rosemary sprigs on the inside, and rested on carrots. Added 1c water in the beginning and did not have to add any more. Didn't make the specified gravy, but gravy from pan drippings and "stock" made from the neck and organ meats was tasty.

The turkey was not moist enough for my taste and the gravy, not rich. It was a good recipe but not flavorful enough for me. I did use reduced sodium chicken broth instead of turkey stock, which was probably the biggest error. The gravy did not have enough flavor.

The turkey was really moist and the gravey was delicious!! And it was complimented many times by the 22 people at my thanksgiving feast. Very true recipe. Basic and true!! I loved it!!

Okay, so I'm the one who said it was like a religion and we followed it to a T. Well, following it to a T was my belief, but I scientifically observed myself this Thanksgiving and found that in real life, I would change one line of the turkey baking instructions to be: "Add 2 cups water to pan and roast without basting, rotating pan halfway through roasting and adding 2 more cups water"

Note that the 1 hour cook time was with a convection oven...

Turkey made this way turned out super moist! Both the drumsticks and the breast meat were perfectly cooked (needed about an hour for a 10 lb turkey). I added some herbes de provence along with the salt and pepper. I did need to refill the water halfway through, and skipped the vinegar in the gravy.

This was my 1st time making a turkey by myself and I thought I picked an easy recipe with no bells and whistles. I ended up checking the turkey after the 1st 1/2 hr. to rotate it and it already almost looked like it was burning and drying out. I added more water and broth at the bottom, rubbed butter over outside and then tented it with foil. I ended up just bagging this recipe, adding fruit and veggies around and in the cavity and lowered the temp. to prevent drying out and hopefully my turkey isn't ruined. I might just not be good at reading instructions, but I feel like overall this recipe didn't give enough information and from the sounds of it, there is too much variations of how the outcome is with no explanation of why. I am still new, so maybe others can make this recipe work, for me- not so much.

This recipe is like a religion at our house. We follow it to the T and its perfect every time. No kidding. I don't follow their gravy recipe. I just do my own thing with that.

I used a 30-lb (!) turkey, at prescribed temperature. Checked it at 3.5 hours - overcooked! The outside was nice and crisp and brown, not burned, but the inside was beyond proper temp and very dry. So, be careful! Will make this again, but will do a better job watching the thermometer.

I used a fresh 19 lb.turkey for this recipe. Two issues: 1.)the turkey will brown very quickly but did not burn and 2.)I needed to add water throughout the cooking process as the pan drippings would start to burn. I continued to cook according to recipe and the turkey was cooked perfectly in about 3 hours.

I also basted and injected with this recipe. I used melted butter, smoked paprika, and parsley. The turkey turned out beautiful and tasty!!

I have not make the turkey, (I always use an Alton Brown recipe from Bon Appetit) but I made the stock and gravy. Both were classic and delicious.

To Connecticut: Although I have not tried this recipe yet (I am just looking for a recipe to try with my culinary students) I wanted to comment. When you use the convection setting on your oven you need to decrease the cooking time by 25%, or decrease the temperature by 25%. Also, it is a good idea to calibrate your oven every so often. You can do this by placing an oven proof thermometer inside, preheat the oven to 350, and then read the thermometer to test your oven for accuracy. Hope this helps.

I've heard that this recipe works as written, Connecticut, but I modified the recipe. I used a fresh turkey, and added some herbs and veggies to the breast cavity, then laced it shut and roasted at 450. When it looked as if the turkey was cooking too quickly, I basted it with a butter-herb mixture using an injector/baster. I kept adding water the the pan and basted several times, but kept the heat up high. The skin split (due to the high heat, no doubt), so using skewers and lacing the breast cavity shut ended up being a waste of time. The end result: the turkey was done quickly and was very flavorful and moist, probably because of the injector basting.

I'm confused! Can a turkey really be roasted at 450 for 2 1/2 hours?? I prepped the turkey as directed, preheated the oven to 450 convection roast, and put the turkey in a Calphalon roasting pan in the oven. Went off to shower. Came back to a kitchen full of smoke (yes, there was water in the bottom of the pan when it went in) and the turkey seemed to be cooking WAY too fast! I finished roasting at 325, but the damage was done--the turkey was dry and the legs overcooked and practically inedible. Any comments??

I started my turkey breast-side down for the first hour, then turned it over for the second hour. That way it got beautifully browned an crisp all over. I got a fresh bird from Whole Foods and it was wonderfully tender and flavorful. I was skeptical about the lack of stuffing (usually I put onion and celery inside the body cavity) but need not have worried - it tasted great. The gravy was also delicious. And all very easy!

I used a regular supermarket turkey but added about three times the amount of carrots and celery. I also added to the roaster the green tops of some leeks that I had, as well as all the giblets, including the liver. After the turkey was done, I strained the grease from the juices and pureed the carrots, celery and onions (but not the leeks) in my blender and added the pureed vegetables to the gravy to thicken it up. Delicious!
