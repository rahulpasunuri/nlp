My guests thought this was wonderful. I thought it was good. I think I added too much cayenne, but I may have been in the minority there. I used whole milk instead of the cream and it was very rich and creamy.

I thought it was a great recipe, especially for someone who's never made this before. I applied some of the previous suggestions - mushrooms, peppers, italian seasoning. My store had no scallops, so I opted for crab meat and the required shrimp. I changed up the sauce a bit. It calls for dry white wine, but I know Rose wine pairs well with seafood, so I used 1/4 cup with the whipping cream. Great to have a chilled glass with dinner too as it picks up the flavour already in the meal. The only thing I would change the next time I make it, is the amount of whipping cream. To me it's so heavy that it almost drowned out the flavour of everything else. I had to use a LOT of seasoning and way more salt than I normally do. Probably substitte 1/2 with a bit of lite cream. I'm not a super chef, but does anyone know if half-and-half or table cream would be better?

This dish was very tasty. I made it for Valentine's Day, and my fiance loved it! I agree with other reviewers... the sauce needs a little something to give it some more flavor. I added lots of garlic salt, which complemented the garlic bread I made to go with this dish. I also added more onions and garlic cloves. One other critique: I like lots of sauce on my pasta. If you're like me, you may want to double the sauce ingredients so you have the desired "soupy" amount. Otherwise, great recipe! :-)

very good base for a sauce. i used butter instead of olive oil and added fresh sage, thyme and rosemary. the cayenne pepper was a great suggestion as it gave it a little zing. i also sauteed red peepers and red onions and added them at the very end. the final touch was a small blnd of emental, edam and parmesan cheeses with green onions to garnish. it was a huge hit and will make it again. the company loved it!!!

I'm a very decent cook and I could not save this mess even with all of the review suggestions. Bland, bland, bland. Even with the cayenne, extra garlic and a few veggies added. So sad, too bad.

I followed a lot of the advice other reviewers had such as adding chile powder, extra garlic, and added a little nutmeg and mixed fresh basil with the parsley. Enjoy!

I enjoyed this a lot, but I did change it a bit. I doubled the recipe and added some lobster; instead of doubling the cream I made a quick stock with the shrimp and lobster shells, and that added more seafood flavour to the sauce. I added a pinch of cayenne and a tablespoon of pesto to finish it off, and everyone enjoyed it. I'd only make it again for another special occasion, but it was well worth it.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have shrimp, so doubled the scallops. I added the cayenne, as mentioned before. I also added 1 1/2 cups of chopped broccoli flowerettes, 1 cup of chopped bella mushrooms and 1/2 red pepper, chopped, for color. I used 2 tbls. of chopped fresh cilantro, instead of the ground coriander. Sauted these with the onion and garlic. Delicious!!!

Rating: 3
This was pretty good. I overcooked the pasta, which made it hard to see past my own mistake. I used spaghetti and a pound and a half of fresh from the farmers market sea scallops (no shrimp). It definitely needed salt, and I agree with previous reviewers that Parmesan cheese helps. I added additional onions and more white wine, which I was glad of. I still couldn't help but feel that it needed something more. I would probably try it again just to see.

Rating: 3
Taking a big risk, I tried this for the first time at a family gathering. It was a HUGE hit!! Thanks to the suggestions out there- I added a little more than a 1/2 tsp of Cayenne Pepper, as well as 1/2 cup or so of parmesan, asiago, romano cheese & a touch more white wine. Also, I used 2 lbs of shrimp & 1/2 a lb of fresh salmon instead of bay scallops. Everyone loved it & asked to take hom left overs! I'll definitely make this again!

I thought that this would be a yummy and I was a little disappointed. The sauce was sweet and needed something to add a kick. Wish I had added some cayenne as mentioned by another reviewer. Will try again with modifications.

Wow! Very good. Would make again but would save for "special" occasssions --- dish was very creamy & rich.

forgot to mention that I prefer this with gemelli or cavatelli (holds more of the sauce!) and, don't forget a salad and bread! don't try any fancy veggies... a good salad, a piece of bread, and a glass of wine are all you need! if you insist upon dessert.... lemon ice with fresh raspberries is the only thing i would recommend.

Rating: 0
Good, but not great... As others have said, use 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream... And sub in seafood stock (or even a squeeze of lemon juice) for the wine if you don't have a really, really dry wine!!! (Otherwise it will have a funny 'sweet' taste to it) I added more garlic and a good teaspoon (or two) of Old Bay instead of coriander (I'm a MD girl!)... About half of a red pepper, finely chopped, stirred into the linguine (with a dash of garlic infused olive oil) after draining is a flavor booster. And a good pinch of kosher sea salt (instead of regular salt) works wonders.

I loved this and it was so easy to make. I took the advice of others who found it bland and added more garlic, a touch more black pepper and some paprika--we added cayenne afterwards to our own plates since my 16 month old was eating with us and i think that would have been too spicy for her. I also subbed chicken broth for the wine since I had none on hand (I'm sure the wine would have made it perfect) I also ran out of 1/2 & 1/2 and had to use a bit of whole milk too and it worked out great. My daughter loved it and so did my husband. will definitely make this again.

This recipe was ok, but I have had better seafood pasta recipes. The sauce was too bland. Probably won't make it again.

Of course, I'm reviewing a *version* of this recipe b/c I just used it as a jumping off point, using what I had on hand. I used shrimp and cut-up tilapia, 1/2 & 1/2, and added mushrooms, celery and various spices, as mentioned by several other reviewers. It was pretty yummy, but I wasn't wow'ed. I'll may make it again, but, then again, I may search for another seafood recipe when the time comes.

I just made this recipe last night, with following changes: I added about 1/4 C. finely grated paramesano reggiano, I used 1/4C. reg onion and 1/4 C chopped chives, I also added 1C sliced fresh mushrooms and about 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper because sauce was a little bland. This recipe is TO DIE FOR and I would proudly serve it to any guests in our home. Also, I used 1 pound of fresh shrimp only due to the fact my husband won't eat scallops. It was simply fantastic. The cheese and the cayenne are essential.

Made this for my boyfriend's daughter's 16th birthday and got high praise for this dish. Added some diced red pepper and a dash of red pepper flakes for zing. Omitted the corriander. Used light (5%) half and half to make this dish much less guilty. Served over penne. Awesome!

Made twice with modifications and got rave reviews. I used half and half instead of cream and dry parsley instead of fresh. I upped the onion and added a pinch of crushed bay leaves, oregano, some mushrooms and red chili and sweet pepper slices. Dish turned out heavenly, and it's definitely a keeper.

I always use a low fat alternative when I can, so I used fat free evaporated milk instead of cream. I added a good dash of cajun spice, 2 Tabs of seafood base (Knorr) and passed grated Parmesan. Very simple and excellent. The pasta we used was fettuccini, nice broad noodles. Might try it next time with a bit of tomato paste. Where it says 'pour over linguine' I suggest you add a little of the drained pasta to the sauce, a bit at a time, to ensure proper coating. Save a bit of sauce to top with at the end.

Made the recipe as is, and thought it was great. Will try the suggestions though, especially the 1/2 and 1/2 (it was very rich with the cream) and the cayenne.

Loved this dish. Made it for Father's Day dinner with a few changes as perviously mentionned, I added the red pepper, mushrooms and used Old Bay instead of cumin. It was delicious! I also cut back the fat and used half & half instead of cream. Will make again and will experiment with other vegetables. Also, I will use another type of pasta instead of linguine, something bite size perhaps.

I loved every bite of this dish. This is a good solid recipe, great as a starting block but I never stay true to the book. To the cook from Auckland, New Zealand, sauvignon blanc may be too bland, I suggest a more fragrant variety. I used 4 tablespoons olive oil instead of 3, 1/4 cup white wine and less cream. Also, a hint of basil or oregano might help, but personally I love the aroma of celery, garlic and shrimp sauteed well in extra virgin olive oil.

Okay....you've been lucky enough to come across this recipe - now MAKE IT! It is excellent (as long as you use quality seafood). I ended up using about 1/3 cup of wine and used 10 % cream and it was delicious. Needs no other adjustments but be sure to season with salt and pepper at the end.

This was a nice change from the standard shrimp scampi I usually serve...I made it as written but added a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper to the spices. It was very very good. The whipping cream thickened quickly so I added some milk to thin the mixture. Salt was also necessary at the end. Worth trying.

This was delicious! Big hit with the family. Did not have coriander, so I used dill, basil and tarragon. Also added mushrooms, fresh parmesan and used dry vermouth instead of wine. Great taste, but I wish I had added some cajun seasoning as suggested by others as it could use a little something. Definitely needed the mushrooms. I also used gemelli because I don't like linguine and found it to be perfect with this recipe. Looking forward to trying it as a casserole as suggested by other reviewer. Great comfort food.

My boyfriend and I both love this dish. It's a little rich for a weekly meal, but we both can't get enought of it. We like using penne noodles with a little extra cayenne. Any seafood lover would enjoy this as part of their recipe collection. Yum, yum.

Here's a yummy variation: After preparing the recipe mostly to the letter (using cajun spice instead of corriander) and not completely cooking the scallops (didn't use shrimp), mix sauce with pasta, pour into casserole dish, top with bread crumb/parmesean mixture, and bake at 350 until bubbly (10-12 mins). Use a little extra cream - I used half and half - so it doesn't get too dry. Delicious!

I hope my fellow searchers will appreciate my wholesale changes to this (fine) recipe, and find them helpful. I wanted seafood pasta with a cajun twist, and wanted to use up ingredients on hand. I wanted to save time by finding a recipe (this one) that gave me a solid-to-liquid ratio and had a roux-type component. Substitutions: 1 t. cajun spice for the coriander (plus some, & some cayenne); some half & half instead of all cream; crab instead of scallops. Additions: the greens of some scallions, some baby portabello mushrooms, about 2 oz. andouille sausage (diced) and 1/2 a yellow (or red) pepper. I needed more half & half, as the crab thickened it (plus the extra solids). VERY tasty -- hubby loved it and will make again this weekend for my Lousiana friends!

Added mushrooms to the sauce. Also recommend adding lobster and mussels. Put in the mussels whole. Steam and shell the lobster in advance and add last. Also, beware shrimp usually take a few minutes longer to cook than scallops (depending on size). Stupendous!

I, too, made adjustments. I didn't have coriander, so used some dill and basil. I used half & half (calories) and used lots of pepper.

We'll make this again!

I made this recipe for some very special company. Well it was a real hit, but I was somewhat embarassed later on as I thought about how I ranted and raved how delicous it was.

Great recipe and prep not so bad. I added 4 extra ounces of both meets, some chopped green onions, and 2 ounces of vermouth to the regular recipe - served over fetuccini and added grated parmesan-romano combination on top. It was excellent! Oh yes, I added some milk to the sauce to thin it a bit and get the consistency I prefer - white sauces always seem to thicken up on contact with pasta!
