Excellent combination of ingredients, although there's no way I'd use store bought salsa. The delicate flavor of the clams really calls for something fresher. I have a garden salsa recipe that's a fave at my house and it worked beautifully. Will definitely make again (actually, I've already made it twice in one weekend!!).

As other reviewers have said - go with fresh for the salsa if possible. I simply used diced fresh tomatoes, diced red onion, fresh basil, a bit of olive oil and a splash of white wine vinegar (S&P to taste). Really good.

lover of seafood from Maine.6/2/00 Great idea with the clams topped with salsa.But, try chopped tomato,red onion,3 bell pepper,and all the heat of a variety of hot peppers;along with fresh mint leaves,cillantro,an fresh ground black pepper salsa!And you could substitute the clams for fresh Maine mussels.Tastes great for a frac- -tion of the cost!!

Followed the advice from an earlier reviewer and used my own chopped tomatoes, garlic & basil w/a little tabasco instead of purchased salsa. Forgot to tell my husband about taking off the tops, but it was still delicious. I'm going to keep trying this recipe with adaptations.

I was interested to try this as I had never grilled shellfish in the shell before. I wasn't disappointed in that aspect, but the accompanying salsa was a big let down. I find most store bought salsas to be full of sodium and not very fresh tasting and simply adding basil didn't do much. I liked the grilled clams enough, however, that I plan to experiment with homemade salsas.
