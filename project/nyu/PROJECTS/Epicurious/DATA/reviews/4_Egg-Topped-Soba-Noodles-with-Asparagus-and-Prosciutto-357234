So easy and so good.

We love this recipe in our family, it's a favorite and so easy to prepare. I add sliced mushrooms to provide a little extra texture, otherwise, I follow the recipe as listed.

Delicious!!! Extra garlic, per usual - and for hearty one course dinner/main dish we made this volume (our package of noodles was 8 ounce but stated for 3 servings) for 3 people - 2 poached eggs/person which was perfect. I would have starved with one egg and half the noodles...

Have made this many times and it is as absolute keeper. Friends will be impressed with the complexity of flavors, yet the dish has a relatively sparse list of ingredients. Do it!

In my last review I said I cut down on the olive used - I meant olive oil!

I made this dish last night for myself and my boyfriend, and we both agreed it was so yummy! I cut down on the olive used - I didn't toss the noodles in olive oil at the end and it was just right. Not greasy, just savory and delicious. Next time I make this dish, I may use something other than Prosciutto though. I found it to be overwhelmingly salty (although still delicious), so I'll have to think on what I could replace it with. It was really easy to make and took no time at all. I will definitely make it again!

I liked this a lot! Be careful not to overcook the noodles. I would probably just put the asparagus in with the noodles from the beginning and cook al dente. I poached the eggs after I combined the noodles with the prosciutto. Unless you want your eggs cooked harder this is the way to go, I like my yolk runny. I would also add some truffle oil next time.

I cooked the soba for the exact time in the recipe, but it came out mushy. Adding the parmesan just made the whole thing into a gummy lump. So needless to say it wasn't that appetizing.

This was awesome, however, did anybody else think that there's no way it was 8 servings? I don't think I eat a ridiculous amount but I found it was more like 3-4 servings.

This is a family favorite! When the cost of asparagus is too high at my local market I will use arugula as a substitution along with pancetta in place of the prosciutto and added green onion. No matter what you use as a substitute it is hard to mess this recipe up.

It was good, but not ridiculously delicious like some other reviewers said. Pros: easy, quick, good change up from the usual dinner grind, tasty Cons: Not something I would rave about extensively.

You definitely overcooked the noodles. Soba cooks quite quickly!

This was not very good. There was too much of a chalky taste. Maybe I overcooked the noodles? Also, I used HALF the amount of noodles the recipe called for and they expanded so much that I ended up with a huge sticky, starchy mess of blandness. Not delicious at all, and I was so excited from the reviews!

Wow, what a quick and easy dinner, with wonderful flavor. But then how can you miss with parmesan and prosciutto and soba? We really liked this. Skipped the egg.

I had high hopes after viewing all these reviews but unfortunately I can't agree with all the favorable reviews. It wasn't a bad recipe just didn't think it deserved four forks. The prosciutto I thought was hardly enough. I must say though that I did use a 12 ounce bag of soba noodles.

This was a rather unusual mix of ingredients -- very Japanese in style but topped with Parmesan! It was easy, delicious and satisfying. Since I halved the recipe, I sauteed the garlic and prosciutto, set them aside, and then cooked the eggs in the same pan. Cooked the soba and asparagus in a pot. Mixed drained noodles and everything else together in individual bowls, topped with eggs & cheese and served. I, therefore, used only two cooking vessels so the dish not only hit the spot with taste and ease but with cleanup as well. Very nice supper!

This was a great recipe that turned out very well--the only reason that I'm rating three forks instead of four is because of how much I substituted haha. I didn't have any soba, so I used whole wheat spaghettit; no asparagus, so I chopped up a bell pepper and some green onions; only a little prosciutto, so I added some thickly cut bacon; and, because I thought it might turn out a little bland toward the end, I dumped in a little fresh thyme. But I have to say i was impressed with the end-product, especially the fried egg on top: I'm a big fan of loco moco, so the runny yolk over the noodles hit my taste buds perfectly. Overall, good essential recipe, and even with heavy swapping-of-ingredients it turns out delicious.

Loved the egg on top! It was very Japanese (the Japanese philosophy to cooking: when in doubt, put an egg on top :D). All the flavors worked really well together. Will try this again!

This is exceptional but do need to include the asparagus, in my opionion. I have made this several times now, and have tried without the asparagus (grocery budget), and the taste just isn't as sublime. It is a playful recipe, and there is room to substitute, but love the combo of flavors with that green stalk! My family freaked the first time they saw poached eggs as part of a dinner, but now when they see me poaching eggs in the evening, they are thinking of this dish! (Seriously .... it's that yummy.)

This is a ridiculously delicious dish! It's sort of Asia meets Italy meets breakfast. The combination of textures and flavors is amazing. I overcooked the eggs which was my fault as I didn't trust that they could possibly be done after covering them at the 2-minute mark. Next time I will!

What a great spring time dish. We have asparagus growing right now and lots of eggs from our ckickens. This makes a great fast dinner. Very yummy.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! Soba noodles are better for you than regular pasta as well! This will be added to my weeknight meals menu.

This turned into a sad, gloppy mess -- but an extremely tasty one. I won't rate the recipe, because this was likely due to my own ineptitude; I probably slightly overcooked the noodles, and in stirring them with the prosciutto mixture, the whole mass turned to mush. Nonetheless, the flavor was great. I might give this one another try and keep a more vigilant eye on the noodles.

There was an unexpected combination of salty and savory flavors in this dish, and it was easy to make. At first I was suspicious of the egg, but I found I liked it more and more as I proceeded to eat it!

Loved this recipe. Easy to make and delicious. My 2 y.o. loved it as well (tho' I admit she picked out the asparagus - oh, well)

I thought this was excellent. I did not expect this to be as good as it was and it was so easy to prepare.

I thought this was a really good weeknight meal. I love main dishes with eggs but my hubby didn't think this needed the egg. I did think it was a little salty with the Parmesan and the prosciutto. Plan to make it again soon!

so so so easy and even without the asparagus, this was gobbled down fast!

The balance of flavors was terrific. My kids don't like asparagus and I expected a fuss over the noodles, too, but they inhaled the entire dish and had seconds. Disappointed Mom who was counting on leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Really good. This is going on our regular rotation.
