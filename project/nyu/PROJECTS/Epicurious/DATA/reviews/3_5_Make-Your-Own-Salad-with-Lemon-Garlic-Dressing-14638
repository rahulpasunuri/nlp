I've made this dressing 3 times now, and I think it's "fantabulous"! I agree that by itself, it does taste a little like furniture polish, but over romaine with feta cheese, its delicious!

I used this dressing for a quinoa salad with green/red peppers, grape tomatoes and chickpeas, and it was very good. I made it as written and then decided I would like just a tad more lemon so I added another tablespoon of lemon juice. It complemented the quinoa and the veggies nicely. This is a keeper.

This is the only salad dressing I make now. I double the salt, but other than that, it's perfect. Very refreshing from the lemon.

Yuk, greasy furniture polish!

Typically for Epicurous reviewers, I did not follow the recipie exactly. I halved the dressing, but used the whole garlic segment, and added about 2/3 of an anchovy fillet, minced in with the garlic. This was served on a mixed green salad. My wife loved it, as did I. Note to anybody making this... you simply must use the lemon zest. I'm sure it made all the difference.

I have made this dressing many times. It is light and fresh tasting. To give a bit more flavor I often add a bit of dijon mustard and a tiny pinch of cayenne.

I thought the dressing was on the bland side. I doubled the garlic and used less oil but it still seemed pretty oily and flavorless.

Great as a marinade for chicken or salmon. Reminds me of Houston's eggless caesar.

Well I'm out of the norm I guess but I didn't like this one at all. It reminded me of furniture polish. I guess it's the lemon and oil combination. Maybe my oil quality wasn't up to snuff or something since everyone else seemed to love it?

I now make this dressing 2-3 times a week. Because of this dressing I eat a huge salad everyday and never tire of it. Lately, I've used less oil, just pouring it in instead of measuring; but I measure everything else, well, except the zest, I just zest the whole lemon. I haven't gotten myself out to buy white wine vinegar so I've used apple cider vinegar. My favorite salad combo so far is mixed romaine, green and red leaf lettuces with grated parmesan and quartered artichoke hearts (canned in water from Trader Joe's). I'm always very sad when my bowl is empty. This dressing is easy and refreshing and oh-so-tasty.

I love this salad dressing. I double the garlic and halve the oil, and it is delicious! I poured it over a salad of field greens, tomatoes and avocadoes tonight, and it was yummy!

I have only made the dressing - again and again. It is very easy and VERY good. Our favorite use so far is on arugula. Don't hesitate.

1 tsp. of salt seems like it might be too much for some tastes: try the same amount of kosher salt instead. Haven't tried this recipe, but the dressing is similar to one of my regulars: garlic and kosher salt mashed to a paste; add fresh lemon juice and whisk in olive oil. Sometimes I add pepper, if I feel like it.

This dressing was amazing - even my dad who refuses to try new things loved it. I love garlic so I didn't 'mash it up' too much, but left some pieces and roasted the black peppers -- OH MY GOD! Absolutley loved it and will always have some in my kitchen.

Used champagne vinegar with two cloves of garlic with the rest of the recipe and came out a.o.k.

I used this recipe as a marinade for chicken shish kabobs instead. It was really easy and delicious. I increased the amount of garlic and also added in some fresh basil. It was so good I used it again for a roasted chicken meal with roasted mushrooms and red peppers. Yum!

This was a simple but flavorful dressing. I tossed a green salad using cucumbers, grape tomatoes and fresh grated parmesan on a bed of red leaf lettuce. I think next time though I will reduce salt to 1/2 a teaspoon.

Like the original reviewer I was looking for a recipe for a salad dressing and brought this recipe up on my screen. The dressing worked great and the salad was a hit. I did not want to rate the recipe until I also prepared this salad which I did last night. Again the recipe performed very well even though I violated the concept of the recipe by preparing a smaller amount of each ingrediant and mixing it all together for my wife and myself. I did not see the need to spread all of the ingrediants out for just the two of us. I will make this again as the "make your own salad" concept works very well with guests and this recipe would provide a great presentation. I should add that this is a very easy to prepare dish.

I made just the dressing for a green salad but, did not use the garlic, added champagne vinegar instead of the white & lemon pepper for the black pepper to give it more of a lemony taste. I served it on a green salad with honey/spiced glazed walnuts, feta cheese & crab stuffed portobello mushrooms for the first coarse, really turned out nicely.
