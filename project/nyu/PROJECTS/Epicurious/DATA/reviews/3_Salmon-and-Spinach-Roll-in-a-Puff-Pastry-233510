This recipe was great and easy to do for 10 people because it can be prepared the morning of and then cooked that night. I used only one sheet of puff pastry per roll and it turned out fine. I added feta cheese to the filling and cooked it about 50 minutes.

We enjoyed this--nice change from baked fish we usually make. I read the reviews for tips, then used 1 pastry sheet and made sure to brush off extra flour as I rolled it up. I used 3/4 lb salmon; 1 box frozen spinach plus 1 fresh bunch--but it was a bit too much, so next time I'll use the box plus 1/2 bunch spinach (about 1 1/2 cups). I rolled it in nonstick parchment paper, didn't need string or more butter. My oven runs hot, so I baked for 35 min, let it rest for 5 min, then sliced. It was great!

After reading the reviews, I too used only one sheet and pricked it lightly before adding the other ingredients. I did not have a problem with it coming out too doughy. I would would make this again.

Wonderful dish but had the 'too doughy' problem even with only one sheet of puff pastry. I doubled the spinach and otherwise followed recipe. The puff pastry was GREAT on the outside: golden and crispy but even with extra cooking time, the middle was awful. If that problem could be solved, this would be excellent. Anyone have any suggestions? Maybe less rolling and do more of a fold

I would cut back considerably on the butter. I used fresh dill and dried thyme in the roll-up and skipped the sauce. I rolled the pastry out very flat (just one sheet), and I rolled it so most of the spinach / salmon was in the center, which caused a dough lump. Could have browned more. I also used fresh spinach. All this said, it was very good and will be even better next time with further modifications. I recommend (the spirit of) it!

This recipe was easy and turned out nicely. I followed others' advice and used only one sheet. I can't imagine using two sheets, as the recipe suggests. With that modification, this was something I could throw together with what was in my freezer, and DBF and I both found it very tasty.

I was looking for recipes to use up prepacked salmon that come in the 3-5 oz range. The following changes were made: I used the one sheet of puff pastry, eliminated the salt, added 1/4 cup chopped salted pistachios as an additional layer, used one package frozen spinach, substituted onions for shallots, and used two, 4oz prepacked smoked salmon. Turned out delicious! I will make this again.

I tried this recipe last night. Taking the recommendation of others, I used only 1 sheet of pastry dough. I still found this way too doughy.

Excellent recipe. I used phyllo pastry as opposed to puff pastry. This was not doughy at all. Great flavours!

I used two sheets of puff pastry and it was really far to doughy. I would not make this again

I tried the recipe using two sheets of puff pastry and the pastry did not cook in the middle. Even after I baked it for another 15 minutes, it still doughy in the middle. I would not recommend this recipe.

So amazing! Made this for New Years eve and everyone commented on it. I don't have much experience working with puff pastry, and ended up buying and using only one sheet. I would do it again, I think with two sheets this would have turned out too doughy. I would also be heavy-handed with the flour during prep, I was too light on it and the dough stuck to my work surface. Such a quality recipe that's simple!
