Made it yesterday only because my daughter loves chocolate and eats extremely healthy. Her husband, 16 year old daughter and she loved it. Seved with SO Delicious non-dairy ice cream. Sent brownies home with her and it is all gone today. I don't like coffee, but followed directions exactly but I might try it with less coffee and, as she suggested, get the instant expresso. I ground this at the store and it was strong. She is going to make this with more chocolate also and seve to her "healthy food" group that meets and exchanges recipes. She is a gourmet cook, so that says a lot. Better like chocolate!
