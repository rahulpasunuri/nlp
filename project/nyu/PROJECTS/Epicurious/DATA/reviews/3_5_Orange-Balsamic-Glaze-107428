Tonight we grilled some rubbed beef ribs so I used black raspberry jelly with the OJ concentrate, left out the orange preserves (and reduced the salt as always). Nice consistancy, great full bodied and complex flavors with a fresh orange kick, added a beautiful shine to the meat. Note that this is a sweet glaze as you would expect. Very nice, will definitely make again.

After reading the reviews I decided to make just half the recipe. I didn't have the orange preserves so, I used three fruit marmalade...No shallots either so I used sweet onion. Now, my question is who has orange zest with out having oranges. I used orange juice and even threw in some of the pulp. I of course had the zest. We loved the glaze over pork roast and I will surely make it again. I should also mention that I used white balsamic vinegar. It seems to be just a bit sweeter than the red.

I made this glaze to go with roast duck. I did not have OJ concentrate so I used regular OJ and I also let it reduce longer. It was very good,everyone loved it, but I don't think I would like with other meats.

The instructions are confusing or there must be a typo here. It implies that you take 8 oz of orange juice concentrate and disolve it in 1/2 cup water. The result is that the glaze tastes like oniony, orange juice concentrate - overpowering. I had to throw out the first batch and cut the orange juice by 4 just to make it palatable. Still not very good. There's better glaze recipes out there.

Superb, excellent glaze! Will use on any roasted or grilled meat, or poultry. I did reduce the salt to 1t. instead of 1T.. Could it have been a typo?

I made this glaze last night to go with a rib roast--and it was very, very good. Wouldn't change a thing. Passed on the buffalo recipe it was meant to go with at the request of my family.
