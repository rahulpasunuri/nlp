This is my go-to holiday pie, though I make adjustments to up the filling and decrease sugar. I have found the perfect proportions for a deep-dish pie to be 24oz blueberries and 18oz cranberries. If you like your fruit pies more tart than sweet, tweak the other measurements- I use about 1/2c white sugar, heaping 1/2c brown sugar, 1tsp lemon zest, 2T lemon juice. Regardless, I suggest substituting some brown sugar, adding a dash of vanilla, and going with fresh cranberries and frozen blueberries.

I am a fan of this recipe, but thought that the cranberry was just a bit too tart and not enough balance. I would suggest cutting the cranberry and increasing the blueberry. Additionally, if you are making a deep dish there will not be enough filling. I used a half portion more of blueberries and could have taken a bit more. Right proportion of corn starch and lemon.

Pie is my family's favorite dessert. Made this for Thanksgiving and had to make it again at XMAS. The balance between the blueberries and cranberries is fantastic. Easy and amazing. The first time I had blues from Maine but ran out for the second pie so used some frozen ones from Trader Joes. Amazing pie!

I am not generally a pie person but this recipe won me over. I've made it with the wild organic blueberries and with regular blueberries and I must say I prefer the regular berries. I make this exactly as written and the tart cranberries balance the sweet blueberries, the cinnamon perks it up and the lemon gives it just the right fresh note. It is absolutely my 'go to' winter pie recipe.

Very tasty. It will be repeated in our home...even if it calls for wild blueberries...

I'll make this pie again and again--and I love the piecrust recipe that came with it in the November Bon Appetit. Beats my family recipe by a mile. At our Thanksgiving table, which was comprised of contributions from four excellent cooks, it was the hit of the evening. We loved the combination of flavors. I would not change a thing.

Amazing!! We had a potluck thanksgiving and I passed this recipe on to a friend of mine who never cooks. She was really intimidated at making a pie, and even apologized for how it looked when she brought it to the party. Im telling you it was the best berry pie I ever ate. I will never again have blueberries alone in a pie. I ate two slices, and my friend was so proud of herself Im sure she will make it again.

Everyone enjoyed this at our Thanksgiving dinner. The tartness was a welcome change from other desserts, especially with whipped cream. I did add more blueberries. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added extra cinnamon, vanilla, and the zest/juice of an entire lemon. I don't know how much of a difference it made in the final pie, but adding a bit of brandy also gave the filling a note of complexity.

I read all of these reviews before making this for my family Thanksgiving and I decided to, hestitantly, bc the reviews were not so good. However, I eliminated the cranberries bc I think that's what made it too tart and instead of using cinnamon sticks, I used ground cinnamon and about 1.5tsp of vanilla. This was SO good! Just a blueberry pie with a different flavor with the cinnamon and lemon. I strongly recommend people to make this without the cranberries.

I discovered this pie to be an excellent dessert for any holiday meal in the future. the flavor is prefectly balanced sweet and tart,while remaining light.

Delicious and tart -- the blueberries balance out the cranberries very nicely, and the pie looked beautiful with the dark red filling and lattice crust. My family gobbled it up! I added 1 tsp of vanilla based on other reviews. I could not taste even a hint of cinnamon, so next time I will probably omit the cinnamon sticks and just use powdered cinnamon instead.

Delicious and the filling is very easy to make

well... I wish i'd read these reviews before I made the filling... it was bland.. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1.5 tsp of vanilla and the zest and juice of the entire lemon. tastes much better.. so will bake it off and finish the review

I'm in South Africa, where it is summer-the wrong season for the traditional wintry foods we eat on Thanksgiving. I never liked pumpkin pie anyway, but I needed another dessert besides apple crumble. Blueberries are everywhere now, and this looked like an interesting recipe. I just made the filling, and it is delicious. I used fresh blueberries, reduced the cranberries by about half a cup, and will add a few more uncooked fresh berries before baking. The 3 stars are premature, but I'm confident this tasty filling will be great when it's crusted.

This was really beautiful and festive but only two forks worth of tasty, unfortunately. I might make it again, but the tartness of the cranberries was a bit much.

This turned out okay, but the flavours just didn't seem to work together. I'd stick with cranberry and apple next time or a regular blueberry pie.

This recipe was good - certainly different. I made the filling with Splenda and added about 1/2 cup of water as the sugar gives moisture that you don't get from the Splenda. Some of the group thought it was too tart, but that was resolved with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! I also added a touch of cardamom as the filling seemed a little bland to me after it was made. The nutmeg on top did improve that, however...I used a refrigerated pie crust and I think a homemade crust would be a big improvement, as would regular sugar.

I used frozen blueberries (not wild but I purchase yearly from a local organic farm) and fresh cranberries, my own pie crust recipe and the zest of the whole lemon. On a scale to 1-5 I received 4 fives and 1 four. It's going into my recipe file.

Fantastic.

No matter how you doctor this recipe, the pie is a failure. Sour, too much cornstarch, needless steps, and a waste of wild blueberries are among its flaws.I rate this negative forks.

I made this recipe with wonderfully fresh cranberries and frozen blueberries; two of my favorite flavors. While it turned out alright, I would not make it again because the fruit lost its texture between the two times it was cooked. It ended up like a thick jelly that held it's shape. The crust wasn't anything special either.

Very good, very tart. Highly recommend.
