The pralines make this dish, providing a nice combination of sweet and heat. The dish took a while to make, but it would be worth making again for company. My only modification was to wilt the spinach because I prefer wilted to raw.

This recipe is super. We added some clementine segments, as had been suggested by other reviewers.

I thought this would have been great as a salad without the scallops. With them, it was kind of an odd combination. The praline was fantastic though - spicy and sweet. Will definitely make it again just to eat on its own.

I'm crazy about this recipe!It's one of my favorites. For a prettier presentation I tossed the greens, then added the scallops and sprinkled the pralines over the top. I served in on a platter...It looked great.

Served this as a first course for 6. Love it! The salad dressing makes the dish... although I admit it was initially a little too tart for my taste and I did add a little bit of sugar. The spicy pralines are great and so easy. Next time I'll make extras for snacking.

This was wonderful. I had a salad similar to this at Pappagallos in the Cayman Islands. Awesome!!!I made it with huge prawns instead of the scallops and doubled the praline mixture because my family usually eats a lot of it before the meal. I used mixed greens because Salt Lake City isn't the culinary capital of the world and no one here has heard of tatsoi. Fabulous!

gee, i was expecting something really great with all these reviews. the components were all nice, but they weren't very compatible. tasty, but the combination was distracting. the praline didn't belong, although it was delicious. i just ate my pecans after the salad. pick your highlight- scallops OR pecans. the dressing was superb, though!

Rarely does a recipe merit four forks, but this one does. Followed the recipe exactly and the result was outstanding. Like many other reviewers, I also used baby spinach. An impressive collection of tastes and textures.

Whom do you need to impress tonight? :) When I finished making this dish, it looked so beautiful, as if it had come right out of a restaurant. Plump, warm, browned scallops sat nestled among greens coated lightly with a creamy avocado-based dressing, and a sophisticated-looking crunchy nut topping "finished" the dish. Wonderful textures as well. It tasted good too, though I personally would prefer a lot less cumin and just a tad less cayenne. (I used arugula instead of tatsoi because that's what I had on hand, and because I'm an arugula fanatic.)

We rate this dish a delicious,permanent addition to our culinary repertoire. We served it with a cold cumuber, almond, yogurt soup (store-boughten, I admit); the dessert was fresh, sambucco-marinated figs with fresh ricotta and pine nuts, whose recipe also appears in Epicurious. Our guests raved! But . . . The praline clumped when I added the pecans. Is there a way to avoid this?

Loved the praline idea in a salad. I used fresh New Caldonian shrimp rather than the scallops and everyone really enjoyed the dish.

It was a wonderful combination of flavors and texture. I had fresh, organic orange slices on the side to add color to the plate and for a complementary taste. I caution others to melt sugar completely before adding the pecans with the cayenne pepper. I forgot, and the air became quite acrid, giving me quite a coughing fit.

I made this recipe for a birthday dinner I gave for my best friend from high school days. One of the women is allergic to scallops so I made the recipe twice, once with scallops and once with shrimp. I used 1/2 spinach and 1/2 baby spinach. I substituted mineola orange wedges for the avacado. It was fantastic! I loved the shrimp. From now on I will use both scallops and shrimp. I will definately make this recipe again!

This is one of the most fabulous recipes around!! The praline is sooo unusual and delicous even just by itself. My husband makes this one and usually sticks to the recipe. We've made this one over and over and everyone raves about the flavors and textures!

I followed the recipe to a tee and it was fabulous - I never repeat recipes but this one will be seen on my table again - beautiful meld of flavor and texture.

I have made this salad many times for guests and they are always impressed. I usually use more scallops and I can never seem to find the tatsoi but will keep looking.

My husband made this for me one night as a suprise. My only complaint is that there was not enough of it! He used the small oranges instead of avocado, which made everything come together so wonderfully! I tell everyone about this dish and now my husband is a hero in the kitchen!!!

Unbelievable!! The flavor combinations were wonderful. My husband said it was the best salad I've ever made and I'm quite a good cook.

One of the best dishes I've ever made! Preparation time was about 45 mins. We really like seafood, so I doubled everything except the spinach & avocado (otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written). This, served along with rice, made a delicious dinner for 4. The praline itself was so good I will probably make it as a snack by itself!

What a great recipe. I had purchased a head of baby tatsoi at the local farmers market and found this recipe to use it in. I needed some additional greens, so I added some leaf spinach and spring greens that I had growing on the deck. I reduced the greens to a total of four cups and doubled the cayenne pepper in both areas of the recipe. This was the only changes to the recipe and it was perfect for both my wife and I. Can't imagine that the two more cups of green would sufficiently satisfy six people for a dinner. All of that aside, this is a truly great and easy recipe. Make the praline and dressing ahead of time. Prepare the greens a couple of hours before the meal and store them in the fridge. Put your plates in the freezer to bring out and serve this recipe on, right after you mix it all together. The recipe really is much easier than your first impressions after reading through it.

This one sounds like a lot of work but its not. I substitute avocado with sliced oranges to cut down on the fat. And I use arugula,radicchio and endive because I can't find tatsoi. Makes an excellent summer supper or serve two scallops on greens as a dinner party appetizer. Your guests will be impressed with this one!

Use meyer lemons for the juice if you can find them and if baby tatsoi is available in your area, it makes a nice arrangement. Sometimes i have substituted bitter greens like dandelion or arugula with the tatsoi - the bitterness goes nicely with the sweet/hot of the praline and scallops. I would also grill the dredged scallops to save fat and add interesting flavor.
