Made this as part of a New Year's Eve buffet, served on a platter w/green and red grapes - a great success. Browns beautifully and smells amazing while baking.

I served this recipe for a Christmas Party. I found the flavors excellent and would love to make this special treat again.

Relatively easy to make, yet so good! I always use English Stilton instead of Roquefort. The presentation is gorgeous if served on top of grape leaves and sorounded with red and green grapes.
