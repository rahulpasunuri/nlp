I followed the recipe exactly as it is written here (except for the KB) and it was delicious. I might add croutons or something to make it heavier or an entree - but it was dinner last night and lunch today! Great! - I did use a little more sweet potatoes, only because it's what I cut.

Just looked at the date of this recipe -- 1957. Great to see it's easy to update for modern tastes.

Definitely has potential, but I found it to be much too salty using the recipe. Next time I would cut the salt by at least half.

I am giving this 3 spoons because although delicious, it wouldn't have been without all the alterations provided by the various reviews. (4 forks reviews!) In addition to the sautéed onions and black beans - I added cilantro instead of kitchen bouquet (which I had never heard of)and half a teaspoon of pimenton (Spanish smoked paprika)which gave it a slightly smoky taste.Next time I am also going to try cayenne pepper.

After reading the reviews (and finding a can of black beans in my pantry), I decided to doctor this recipe to play with the sweet/salt aspect and it came out PHENOMENAL. Tweaks: I sauteed 1 small onion and 2 cloves of garlic in the bottom of the pot, then added a can of black beans (rinsed, of course). In a seperate bowl I pureed the sweet potato, flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, broth & milk, plus I added herbs de provence in lieu of kitchen bouquet. I then added that to the onion/bean mixture and let it simmer for a while. 10 mins before serving I added some leftover spicy sausage from the night before (chopped up) which made it even better. It was a full meal and we licked our bowls when it was over!

Loved this, but only gave 3 forks because I used the suggested adaptations.........Deleted the sugar, had no kitchen bouquet, added a tad of cayenne.The sauteed onions are a must! I have made this 2 times now, once with hardly any milk. Both times were raved.

Made as directed, it was very easy. It was very yummy, but a little sweet for our tastes, it not being a dessert. I doubt I'll make it again.

This recipe is more like 3-1/2 forks, but in addition to being delicious, it's so easy that I rated it 4 forks. I've made it 3 times now, and I always saute 1/2-3/4 cup diced onion until at least translucent, more toward carmelized if possible, and then add to the blender. To me, the onion is key to making this more savory, less pie-like. I use freshly grated nutmeg, and like most reviewers, I also don't have/use Kitchen Bouquet. As for the potatoes, I baked 2 smallish sweet potatoes, probably about 1/2 cup more than recipe calls for, but I love sweet potatoes and want the flavor more prominent in the soup. Baking the potatoes is so easy and a great technique to carmelize the natural sugars. Next time I may try and add a bit of cayenne, and then serve with a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt as a counterpoint to the spice. Although maybe not, as husband says the soup is just perfect the way it is.

Delicious and extremely easy. I just microwaved the yams and tossed 'em into the blender with the spices. As a child of the '80s, I wasn't familiar with Kitchen Bouquet, so I used dashes of cardamom, curry powder, white pepper and thyme along with the others.

Delicious! I made some modifications after reading previous reviews: added about 3/4 c. of sauteed onion (pre-saute measurement); reduced milk to 3/4 cup; omitted ginger; halved the cinnamon. I also did not have the Kitchen Bouquet. It was truly delicious. Next time, I'll use olive oil instead of butter and skim or soy milk instead of whole-- it was so good, I ate the whole batch (toddler wasn't keen on it). Also, just for reference, I used three small-to-medium size sweet potatoes.

Really tasty! I didn't have the Kitchen Bouquet and it was still great. I think I may have had it on the stove too long, though, because it turned out thick. Next time, I will cook for less or just add a little extra stock. One last thing - it didn't really make much. I served it with grilled cheese and got about three servings.

This has long been one of my favorite soup recipes. I roast the sweet potatoes which I think gives them extra depth of flavor. And I don't worry about not having Kitchen Bouquet. It's a big hit. I will have to try it with cardamom which is a great suggestions

Changes I made:No kitchen bouquet or nutmeg on hand. I used cardamom, allspice, fresh garlic,and fresh ginger. I think my sweet potatoes came out to be more than one and a half cups, so I juiced a granny smith apple and pear and put the juice in the sauce pan to thin out the mixture some. So delicious!

Everyone who tried this loved it. Subbed bisto for K.B. as I didn't have it on hand. Very easy. Topped with Greek yogurt. Mmm.

I would not make this recipe again as printed, but would make it with a few modifications. I thought this was much too sweet (think eating hot pumpkin pie filling that's been watered down) and too salty. I would omit the sugar and salt, halve the amount of spices and add 1/8 tsp of cayenne. I would also use less milk, as 1 cup makes it too thin for my liking. I did not have Kitchen Bouquet, so I made a roux with the flour and butter, which worked well. I also added some diced, sauteed shallots and onions (approx. 1/2 cup) before pureeing, which I would definitely do again. I think I was just hoping the soup would be more savory and instead it was more desert-like.

Took only around 15 minutes to whip up and was great. Didn't use milk -- extra broth instead as recommended by another fan. Added red chile flakes, cinnamon bark, and a small hunk of ginger which all blended in the blender. Superb!

WOW. This is the first dish I made with my new immersion blender and all I can say is I love both the dish and the blender SO MUCH :-) I sauteed some onions in bacon fat and garnished the soup with bacon bits. I also added some cayenne pepper as others suggested. It was really really good, really hearty, and really different.

P.S. Kitchen Bouquet is a staple where I live therefore I could not leave it out! Here are the changes I made:Sweet Potato Soup Changes: Use 2 small BAKED sweet potatoes, NO salt, 1/8 teaspoon of ginger, less than 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg, NO sugar, ADD 1 teaspoon of onion flakes, Use REDUCED SALT chicken broth, Use SKIM milk, Try sauteed sausage or bacon or ham added in with the milk but NOT in the blender! Parsley and bacon Garnish. YUM!

I made this soup for friends and they loved it. Since I did not have Kitchen Bouquet (A browning and seasoning sauce for meats, gravies, and stews. It's ingredients include caramel coloring, mixed vegetable stock, salt and parsley), I browned the flour in the butter first before blending it in with the rest of the ingredients. I also topped each bowl with buttered pecans(from a prior recipe on epicurious). I also did not use the milk (more stock instead) and poured about a tablespoon of cream decoratively on the surface of each bowl. It looked good and tasted great!

So quick and easy! I read some other sweet potato soup recipes calling for maple syrup in them. I boiled my sweet potatoes in a maple vanilla tea mixed with the chicken broth and it was amazing! It tasted like pumpkin pie filling in soup form... and it's healthy! I went out and bought two more sweet potatoes and made it again. I can't handle spicy, but after reading the other reviews I added just the smallest bit of cayenne pepper and it helped enormously with flavor.

Very nice. Very easy. Sauteed shallots, ginger, garlic and apples (as suggested by a previous reviewer) in olive oil. Added baked sweet potatoes and spices. Didn't have Kitchen Bouquet (just brown sugar and water from what I can find on Internet), didn't make a difference. Pureed it all with chicken broth and added milk. Is good without milk too. Crusty bread, small salad, and fresh ground pepper. So nice.

This is a good recipe but you may want to make this without the salt and add it to suit your taste afterwards. I made the recipe as written, except I used low sodium chicken broth and it was still very salty. I threw it away and made it again without using the salt and it was much better. Since I was making modifications, I added a diced cooked apple, a grind or two of sea salt, a little splash of brandy, and a small pinch of cayenne just to give it a little kick. It was delicious. I didn't see the point of the kitchen bouquet so I left it out. I used 1 large sweet potato which when diced was about 2 cups. I steamed the sweet potato and the apple in my pressure cooker about 8 minutes.

Absolutely delicious!! I also added the sauteed onion and allspice, but I substituted tofu to thicken instead of flour and veggie broth instead of chicken. I cannot wait to make it again!

Last night I ordered a sweet potato soup at the local 4 star restaraunt and was unimpressed. This evening I made this one, and added one sliced and sauteed onion as well as a splash of cream and it was better than excellent. I didn't puree the whole thing, leaving some nice potato chunks and highly reccommend it.

Very Good! I left out the Kitchen Bouquet (because I didn't have it) but sauteed an bit of onion and added it to the mixture before blending. Not sure if it really changed anything.

A great soup, the spices are perfect (even without the Kitchen Bouquet).

Very easy to prepare, but would rather have sweet potatoes listed by weight or number and size of sweet potatoes rather than number of cups cooked. I used raw potatoes and estimated. Came out very well, but I too would use less cream that I substituted for the milk. Spices were perfect. I skipped the Kitchen Bouquet. My yield was about 3 gallons. Prepared for the staff cafeteria of the Woodstock Inn.

Delicious. I didn't have Kitchen Bouquet and substituted cardomom. Also, I used canned yams, I prepared the dish while my guests were watching. It was a grand hit.

This soup is FABU! Not only did I make it at least twice per month during last Fall/Winter, I've made it a few times this Summer. I omitted the Kitchen Bouquet. Firstly, I don't know what it is. Secondly, a work colleague (who is a great cook) says its akin to a "flavoring" agent and it's very strong. I also use Skim Plus milk instead of whole milk. It's more "substance" than skim, but not as fattening as whole. I just came in from the market where I bought some chicken broth -- I'm making more tomorrow!

I would never have tried this if not for the piles of sweet potatoes left over from a yam craze. I didn't use quite as much milk as it called for and skipped the ginger and "Kitchen Bouquet" all together. (I'm in college, can you tell?!) It was surprisingly nice. I can understand how my boyfriend felt when he said, while crushing fist fulls of Ritz into the soup bowl, "It needs more substance." I thought it was great, and it only took 15 minutes to make, start to finish! Now that's incredible!!
