This has been my "go to" recipe, hands down, for several years. Any time I use a new recipe, I follow it to the letter, then make my own adjustments. This is great as written. My adjustments (to suit my taste,convenience, etc.) are 1/2 tube of anchovy paste instead of the fillets, dijon Mustard instead of the dry mustard and that is it!!!! Love this dressing, a staple in our refrigerator.

I have made many caesar dressings looking for the perfect one and I finally found it!! Caesar is my husband's favorite and I did not want to make a caesar with raw egg since I cant stand the idea of it. This recipe did the trick. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the garlic. I only use one clove because when I made it with 4 it was enough to kill you ( and I love garlic).I also substitued 2 Tbs. of anchovy paste like other reviewers. I also sprinkle grated parmesan over the romaine for I toss it with the dressing. It is a keeper!!

This dressing is great. More garlicky than most Caesar dressings, but if that's a problem for anyone, you can always use less garlic. The suggestion of using anchovy paste instead of anchovies was a good one - it makes this even easier!

I chose this recipe because there were no eggs in it. The croutons were excellent-golden brown and so crispy. Maybe a little more garlic flavor would be nice. I put the dressing ingredients into the food processer. The dressing was very good.

This is one of the best Caesar dressings I've made in a long time. A keeper for me. Made it exactly as the recipe called for. The curls of Parmesano-Reggiano cheese made the salad perfect. I squeeze a bit of lemon juice over all.

This recipe is nothing less than wonderful and a must-have addition for any cook that needs or desires an EGGLESS recipe. I am hosting a graduation party for my step- daughter and the thought of serving a raw egg recipe to 40 people(even though I use organic free-range eggs) was entirely less than appealing. In fact this recipe is so good, that I think it will replace my current recipe. I just tested it on my son and husband and they couldnt agree more. This one is a keeper. PS- I hadnt added the croutons yet. So I am not rating those but may end up buying some gourmet ones at our version of Whole Foods.

This is a good recipe for those chefs that don't want to use raw egg. Use spicey dry mustard or add a dash of tabasco.

Very nice. I'd make the croutons smaller. Gives your jaw quite a workout.

Whole family loved the salad. Held back a little on the oil and added a dash of Tabasco.

I was disappointed after all the great reviews. Everyone in my family loves garlic but we found the garlic in the dressing overpowering. Maybe the cloves were too big? There was no anchovy taste at all - it was basically a nice (albeit strong) garlic dressing but nothing special. There are definitely better Caesar dressings out there.

Nice and easy-I agree that the Sherry vinegar made a difference. I left out the egg and it was still wonderful. A quick recipe for a weeknight caesar salad.

I recommend holding off on the oil and grated cheese til the end to adjust for desired thickness and intensity of taste. Personally I think the fillets have more flavor than the paste and I use the olive oil in the tin. Also, a coddled egg improves the richness and color. So in the end I use less oil and sometimes quite a bit of grated cheese so that it clings to the lettuce more. Use any leftover instead of mayo on sandwiches. Wonderful!

Easy, easy, easy. My 9 year old son -- the resident Caesar salad aficionado -- has given this recipe a 9 out of 10. Will definitely make this again.

I've made several caesar dressings from these pages and this one is my favorite, hands down. Perhaps it is the sherry vinegar in it, not sure but the overall taste is sublime. I too use anchovy paste, cut down on the oil and sometimes add an egg, depending upon who is dining with us. I don't like to add cheese to the dressing as it tends to become too thick. And of course, the croutons are divine!

Absolutely delicious. As per another reviewer, I didn't add quite as much oil as the recipe called for; I just kept pouring until it looked about right. Very easy and very very tasty.

Made this for a family get-together...I had doubled the recipe and it was ALL gobbled up. Like others, I used 1 Tbsp of anchovy paste (instead of the filets) and added 1 egg to the basic recipe. Fabulous!

I like this recipe but I didn't think it was as good as others expressed. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but it tasted too oily for me. I even added parmesan into the dressing as others suggested and I also added more anchovie paste because it still did not seem to have enough flavor.

Wow. This is an addictive recipe. I also added parmesan cheese right into the dressing recipe pureed the whole thing in a cuisinart. Very creamy. Also used anchovy paste, about 1 tbsp. AMAZING!!

Very good, but I doubled the garlic.

I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies (about 1 tbl). I also added in some cheese right into the mixture before I blended it all together. It was very tangy, but delicious! Rave reviews.

With a few additions, I found this to be an excellent ceasar salad dressing. I made the recipe as written, except that I added a coddled egg, added about 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese, and c) used a food processor to blend the ingredients to a creamy consistency. A few comments: 1) the garlic is strong (as it should be), 2) definitely has a "bite" to it between the garlic and the dry mustard, and 3) two anchovy filets is almost unnoticeable... so consider, adding 3 or 4.

I thought it was a good overall Caesar salad recipe. Not to complicated, and better than the kits you can buy at the supermarket. Well worth making for a casual dinner or family get-together.

This was a real winner in my household! I made it for a dinner party we hosted and everyone raved. When one of the guests asked if he could have the last bit of it, several people spoke up and said that he'd have to share! It was the first time I'd tried to make Ceasar dressing and I was very impressed with how easy it was to make!

Really liked this one--but my husband thought too much garlic (is there such a thing?)

Rating: 4
I like to add twice the amount of anchovies and find a coddled egg helps to hold the dressing together.

I used more anchovy fillets, added more garlic and some more worcestershire sauce & a raw egg. This salad was easy to make and all my guests loved it. The only hard thing was making the croutons, my bread was so soft that it was hard to cut into the cubes.

This was a great Caesar salad, and not that difficult to make.

Why not use anchovy paste in the dressing. It's already mashed and the tube keeps forever in the fridge. What do you do with a half-used can of salted fish? Measuring garlic by the clove can be dicy; we all know they come in vastly different sizes. Not everyone subscribes to the idea that "too much garlic" is an oxymoron.

The croutons were excellent. I added chopped fresh rosemary which added a real good flavor to the croutons.

The croutons were great - I had always made them using just olive oil and garlic, but the addition of butter really made a difference. Had to make double the amount though because my kids ate the entire first batch.

I can safely say that this is one of the best Caesar salads I've ever made. And yes, you can leave out the anchovies...but, why would you ever want to? A great many recipes use anchovies whose taste is completely undetectable to the tongue, but never-the-less imparts that certain something that makes a really great recipe!

If you mash the anchovies well with the garlic, you have no idea that they are in the final dressing. Yummy, and we couldn't get enough of the breadcrumbs!

could this recepie be made without the anchovies?
