This was a nice salad, a departure from the norm. I liked the peas and cucumbers together but the dressing flavors were a bit muddled. I would have preferred a more distinct flavor and texture from the walnuts. I might not use the dill next time, maybe substitute parsley instead.

Haven't tried it yet, just printed it. As too the lack of salt as an ingredient. It's right there, second paragraph. "Season with salt and pepper."

The big problem with the recipe is they forgot the salt, but don't add until right before serving so it doesn't draw water out of the cukes. I skipped the cayenne and used 5 spice and a little extra ginger, and toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts and some shallots. The dressing seemed too oily, so I added white wine vinegar. My brother in law loved it; my sister said there was a flavor she didn't care for, which I think was probably the anise in the 5 spice. Good dish if you just use the recipe here as a starting point.

This recipe was a bland. I used more dill and lemon zest to liven up the flavor, but I like the combo of cucumbers, dill, snap peas.

Cayenne? Salt? Lemon? Pick at least one of those and add more! This salad was blander than bland and a waste of otherwise great ingredients!

I used chili powder instead of cayenne, and it worked fine. I had to add more of everything for the dressing to really get it to coat the pound of peas and the cucumber well. great if you add lettuce to it as well, if you want more of a traditional salad.

I substituted white wine for the chicken broth. I made the dressing in the Cuissinart, and it turned an ugly grey color, possibly a reaction of the walnuts to the metal blade. It tasted great!

Excellent! I did not mash the walnuts into a paste.. It's a bright, springy, different salad. Also there was one serving left which I ate the next evening and it didn't taste as good.

Wonderful, fresh, bright flavor. A great alternative to a basic green salad. I especially like serving it with spicy food.

A great salad with spicy food. I used an extra teaspoon of walnut oil.

Although the dressing does have a nice nutty flavour, it lacks oumph. Even with the cayene pepper, the dressing doesn't have that tangy edge that would add so much to the delicious taste of the sugar snap peas.
