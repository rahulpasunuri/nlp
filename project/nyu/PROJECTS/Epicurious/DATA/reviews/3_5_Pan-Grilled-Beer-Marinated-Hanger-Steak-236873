This is a very good simple marinade. I added 1/2 teaspoon of chopped fresh ginger which I feel made the dish. Also used regular lager beer (as opposed to porter) and did not use the mustard didn't miss either one... Making it again tonight.

meh. I followed the recipe to the letter. The marinade tastes okay, but it overwhelms the meat.

Hanger steak with this recipe has become my absolute favorite meat dish; since it was published Ive made it more than a dozen times  usually on the grill. The flavor of hanger steak is so rich and beefy and is very nicely complimented by the flavors of this marinade which also makes it wonderfully tender. At less than $3 per pound, hanger is usually among the least expensive cuts, and given its strong beef flavor and tenderness makes this a winning combination.

excellant marinade but I add 1/4 cup honey to this recipe and it is to die for.

Great marinade. I like it best with a good porter. I've had really good luck with the Anchor Porter. And the best part is, the left over 11 bottles don't go to waste. Oh, and charcoal grill it. This nice piece of beef deserves a real flame.

I don't know if it is fair to rate this but I did follow the recipe ingredients. I was only able to marinate the steak 4 hours and had to use flank steak since the butcher had never heard of hanger steak. Result: way too much rosemary and getting beyond the rosemary the flavor was okay and the meat was tender.

I have made this many times and it is always a hit. Very easy. Best if marinated overnight. We always grill outside.

Wonderful! Used Guinness and the steaks turned out beautifully. I used some of the marinade on Portabello mushrooms and grilled those too. Fantastic!

I followed to the letter, and let the meat marinate for about sixteenhours and was still dissapointed. Wasn't any better that a jarred marinade from the local grocer. Bummer man.

I was very excited about trying this recipe, but was let down after I made it. It just didn't have a great flavor like I thought it would, and did not make the steak tender.

Loved this marinade!!! I used flank steak, Heineken, and grilled it on my gas grill. This marinade made an inexpensive piece of meat fantastic. I will definitely be making this again.

My grocery store didn't have hanger steak so I opted for a two inch thick ribeye. We had it for dinner and then breakfast the next day. This marinade is definitely a keeper.

I love this marinade! We have non-steak eaters in our house, so I use it on boneless Turkey Thigh & it is really great. My husband says it helps with his "meat fix" and the non cow people enjoy it as well. we make this over & over!

Wow was this good! Really easy marinade. I let it sit overnight and grilled it on my stovetop griddle and everyone loved it. The flavors are wonderful.

Reviewed in my home as "the best steak (they) have ever had." Easy marinade, easy to grill, and best of all, easy to finish the six pack of Sam Adams along with the meal. I will make this again, over and over.

This marinade was incredibly easy and absolutely delicious. I used a cheaper cut of steak, and it made it tender and moist. Also, I didn't have time to marinate overnight, so it was about 8 hours. Incredible...you can't go wrong with this one!

We ended up using NY Strip, as the butcher said he'd never heard of the term hanger steak (no comment). We also used the marinade for portobello mushrooms (the steak of vegetarians) and they tasted great! A very good marinade.

I made this using some cheap-ass old steaks I had in the freezer and it was still delicious! It is an excellent marinade, and I can't wait to make it with some worthy meat!

I used flank steak, followed the recipe exactly as written with one exception...we grilled it, rather than pan-fried, for 5 minutes per side. Made EXCELLENT Fajitas.

Each steer has only one hanger steak (AKA hanger steak, hanging tender, butcher's steak and in French restaurants, onglet) and it has an incredible beefy taste. This is the best hanger steak recipe that I have ever had and would highly recommend it to anyone who can find this steak or one similar such as skirt or flank steak.

The marinade is fantastic. I used top sirloin as no one had hangar steak. I also cooked it on the grill! Fantastic!

You could substitute skirt or flank steak for the hanger steak.

what might be a good substitute for the hangar steak?

The Hanger Steak ( a U.S. term) is a thick strip of meat from the underside of the beef cow. It hangs (hence the name) between the rib and the loin. It is part of the diaphragm and, like a skirt steak is full of flavor but can be tough if not prepared correctly. The hanger steak has a grainy texture which is great for many dishes like fajitas or bulgogi. While you can use most any method to prepare the hanger steak it does have a tendency to dry out and get tough when exposed to dry heat. When grilling or broiling you need to use a marinade first to keep it moist. This is a very tasty steak and you will really enjoy it as long as you prepare it correctly.

I'm from Canada and I don't know what a hanger steak is either. Does anyone know what that cut is called in Canada or what is similar?
