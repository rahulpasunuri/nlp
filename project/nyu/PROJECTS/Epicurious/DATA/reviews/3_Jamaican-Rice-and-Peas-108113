This is a very good start to a recipe. I took already mixed jamaican spice and mixed it into melted butter then chilled it. I put a small slice into each bowl at serving time. Gave it a much dmore istinctive "Jamaican" flavor.

I'm giving four forks for authenticity's sake. Married to a Jamaican and living in Jamaica, I can say that this dish is definitely authentic. However, we often use canned coconut milk at home. Also, my husband's aunt cooks the rice with hamhock or pigstails (I'm not a big fan of any sort of tail, but I hear it adds flavor). The hamhock is wonderful. I agree with the other cooks that using pigeon peas ("gungo peas") is well worth it.

This recipe is just missing a few key ingredients to kick it up a notch. Use pidgeon peas reather than kidney beans for more traditional Caribbean flavor, they are a very rich and meaty small bean. My Grandma, who is from Kingston Jamaica used the onion, but in addition you boil in smoked turkey parts (2), a sliced tomato, and some shredded carrot (1). The smoked meat with the coconut milk is an awesome blend of flavor. I do add some garlic to the pot as well. Cheers!

I wonder exactly what "jbscanlan" expected of this recipe, perhaps they did not realise that rice & peas is normally served *with* something that has a kick. The rice & peas is supposed to be a foil to the rich spicy flavours it is served with, much as most rice dishes are. I used less salt than suggested (which seems an awful lot to me!) and chopped the scallion into the dish rather than fishing it out at the end. I also used tinned coconut milk & an ordinary green chilli as that was what I had to hand. Turned out pretty nice, very similar to other rice & peas recipes I've used before. I served it with ackee & callaloo, with hot pepper sauce for the grown ups!

Very disappointed in this - bland, bland, bland. I used the canned milk as many recommended, but I had hoped for more spice and richness.

This is a great idea for an exotic variation on rice and beans. However, it's too complicated. Most of the recipe is for making coconut milk, which folks can now find in cans at the supermarket.

I have been making this dish since I was a young girl. Its traditionally made on Sundays in Jamaica and normally served with Stewed Chicken. The receipe is pretty good with the .Very Tasty I will keep making this. Its also good if you make a large batch and then freeze the leftovers. Add about two tbsps of water when reheating approx two cups.I also prefer the org way it taste so much better

I really didnt care for the kidney beans in this recipe. Will stick to my more traditional version made with Pidgeon peas and coconut milk!

This dish was very tasty but I would ease up on the salt a bit. I also used 4 cans of kidney beans lightly drained and heated them up in a pot and added 2-3 crushed cloves of garlic and simmered for about 10 minutes. I also substituted the whole coconut with a can of light coconut milk and added enough water to make 2 cups. Serve it with West Indian Chicken Curry and it's awesome!

nice side dish. If you want to make it spicier, puncture the walls of your pepper so more oil can get out. Be careful though as that'll make it MUCH spicier. (I've done it on accident a few times and woohoo...spicy)

I loved this recipe--the fresh coconut thing was ARDUOUS, but definitely worth it. The flavors in this dish are subtle yet interesting. The recipe makes a TON, and I look forward to the leftovers!

I made this to recipe and found it too oily...a little too mushy. I think I'll try it next time with dried unsweetend coconut flakes instead of coconut milk and try serving it topped with fresh cut tomatoes,fresh cut green onions istead of cooking the scallions, parsley instead of cilantro and fresh cut lime wedges.

Tasty side dish - goes nice with fish or a Carribbean entree. It reminded me of risotto with beans since the rice is creamy. Couldn't really taste the habanero chile, scallion or thyme. I wanted to follow the other reviewer's suggestions to use canned kidney beans and canned coconut milk - but was unsure of what quantities to use (I also wanted to reduce the number of side-dish servings made). Ultimately, I used 1-15.5 oz can red kidney beans, 2-14 oz cans coconut milk, 2+ cups water, 1 scallion, 2 thyme sprigs, 1 chile and 2 cups rice. These quantities seemed to work out - although next time I might (1) increase the amount of red kidney beans, and (2) chop up the chile to make it spicier. Does anyone know if the leftovers reheat well after being frozen?

This recipes is a pretty good one, however, I would add a few strips of bacon or salted "Pigs Tail" if you want more of a "kick"

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I did the laborious, ho-hum coconut method. I also left in some of the pulp, followed the recipe precisely and the results were delicious. However, because the kitchen smelled so great my family ran in with bowls and spoons the moment I said it was ready. However, the taste is soooo greatly improved when you let the rice 'sit' in the bowl with the beans and sauce. I didn't realize this was a given - probably the only person who didn't. Also, the canned coconut milk version was also good but not as much as the labor-intensive way.

With the substitutions recommended below (can of (lite) coconut milk, canned kidney beans), this is an incredibly EASY and quick dish - perfect for a mid-week dinner! We served this alongside grilled blackened tuna and grilled pineapple rings and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Definatly, agree with the other reviewers - coconut cream or milk is an adequete subsitute. That's how my Mom makes it, and I can remember as a boy having to squeeze the cocunut - never again! Having said that it's a great dish.

Just a suggestion for those who don't like making their own coconut milk-I can actually extract up to six cups of milk from one coconut. So do two or three coconuts at once, and put the milk in the freezer in one or two cup containers, so that when you're ready, you can just take some out. The canned milk is fine, however the homemade milk lends more flavor since it hasn't been pasteurized. This dish is so tasty we make it once a week at least.

It is a great tasting dish but asa a Jamaican I know that many things can be substituted. Firstly I prefer to use Maggi coconut milk instead of going through the whole extraction process.Instead of cooking the beans which is again another long process, a cook may use two options: 1. Put the beans in a pressure cooker with pimento (allspice seeds), a little salt, a sprig of thyme, 2 cloves of garlic and a bit of scoth bonnet, pressure for half the time, make sure you use the stock from the beans as it is flavorful and has a rich red color or 2. In 15 minutes you may use the canned dark red kidney beans, utilise the juice again for the dark red color. This recipe can be done in 35-45 mins. using these alternative. As we say in Jamaica- Eat good, eat yu belly full.

Simple & delicious. For simplicities sake, I used canned coconut milk. No need to worry about adding a whole chili. I prefer more flavour & normally add several whole chilies/jalapenos in most of the dishes I prepare. Depending on how long you simmer, the chili mostly stays intact & adds quite a flare to the dish.

Wow, how refreshing it would be to get a review from SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY MADE THE RECIPE AS WRITTEN.

You absolutley don't need to go through the whole coconut production bit in this recipe. Canned or frozen, creamed coconut added to the water to simmer along with the peas (kidney beans)- with a crushed clove of garlic and a dash of salt - substitues nicely. By introducing the coconut during the inital cooking stage, you infuse the beans with a fuller coconut flavor. Also, rather than adding a whole chile, carefully remove the seeds and chop the chile before addding it to the mixture. This removes the risk of the entire dish being ruined if the very hot Scotch Bonnet or habanero pepper were to burst during cooking.

I didn't even try to make the original recipe. After reading the previous reviews, I used a couple of cans of coconut milk and pidgeon peas, which I can get in the Caribbean market and it was very tasty.

A whole coconut? get real, Waste of time and effort. If you really need - not cream. l,

I didn't want to bother making my own coconut "extract", so I used lite canned coconut milk instead. The recipe made a ton of rice, and was tasty, but I would never have guessed coconut milk was in there, and there was no spiceiness from the habenero. There was a subtle flavor. Next time I will cut the amount of rice down considerably, and keep the other ingredients the same. I will be eating frozen leftovers for quite a while.
