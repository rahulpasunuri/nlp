Out of this world good. I make this every year and my guests are always asking for more. I use a jumbo egg, and a nonstick skillet is a must. As another reviewer has said, be patient before turning. Also, I use black whitefish caviar with great results.

Make sure the pan and oil are hot enough, finely chop the green onion and be patient before flipping the cakes and they'll crisp up just like potato pancakes! The whitefish roe is wonderfully sweet and mild so pile it on! The wild rice provides a unique nutty flavor and texture under the sour cream.

It was just by chance that I was going through old Gourmet Thanksgiving issues to come up with appetizers. These turned out terrific because they were elegant warm appetizers that I didn't have to use the oven to make. I topped the cakes with smoked salmon and chives. Very nice.

I have made this recipe several times and find that the pancakes, though delicious, do not hold together very well. They certainly did not hold together with one egg and when I added additional eggs, they held together, but became rather heavy.
