This recipe is good, but it is slightly bland. With a few tweeks however, it becomes really delicious. I followed the suggestions of two other reviewers and added a Tbsp of fresh thyme and doubled the mushrooms. Don't used bagged corn. The fresh corn is really nice in this dish. I also added a jar of sun-dried tomatoes for more flavor. Finally, I used veggie broth instead of chicken for my wonderful vegan Mother-in-law. It turned out fantastic. For the non-vegans I had garlic and thyme sauteed shrimp and grated Parmesan cheese to go on top. It was a huge success all the way around and was even better the next day.

I made a few major changes to this recipe: firstly, I added way more mushrooms than the recipe called for. Secondly-and I think this was the most significant change-I used wild mushrooms. I do NOT recommend doing this unless you are 100% sure what you're picking is edible. Since the mushrooms I used had a more delicate flavor than store bought mushrooms, I did not use tomatoes because I think it would overpower the subtle mushroom flavor. Instead I added fresh sage, some parmesan, and cooked the polenta in broth and water to add more depth to the dish. Made a delicious, comforting weeknight meal.

I thought this was great! I did make several changes. As a previous reviewer recommended, I added more mushrooms (about 8oz.) and I let everything simmer together for much longer than the recipe states. This made it all perfectly flavorful. I also added some slices of a mild Italian sausage that I cooked up and threw in at the end. It was a fun easy dinner:)

While this is a light and tasty vegetarian dish, I thought it lacked depth of flavor on its own. More mushrooms might help, but in the end I added some reduced porcini broth and topped it with shaved parmesan. I served it with a simple roasted chicken breast that I sprinkled with fresh thyme, salt and pepper.
