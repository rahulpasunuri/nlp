So easy! I was skeptical that it would work, but everything came together without a hitch. The key is to serve it as soon after combining the ingredients as possible. A great hit with the fussy eaters of the house.

I must have done something wrong. Maybe there is a special technique for getting this creamy as other people stated but this just tasted like buttered noodles with a light parmesan taste. I am all for as original as possible recipes but I will not make this one again. If it hadn't been for my garlic chicken, our dinner would have been a flop.

this was very good though i used a little less cheese and only 4 table spoons of butter as well as adding 1/4 cups half and half added some creaminess as well as a little bit of lemon juice to jazz it up

Great Authentic recipe! So easy and quick. Much better than the one with heavy cream! I am going to make one again tonight...

At Alfredo's in Rome, I believe they added a little gruyere to the alfredo. Delish!

This is just pasta with butter and cheese. It can be very good, but it isn't Fettucine Alfredo.

I expected this to not be creamy and on the dry side, but it wasn't at all, it was some of the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had. I mixed it with some lemon-dill salmon and it came out to be one of the single best meals I've had. Highly recommended.

I made fresh egg fettuccine using this recipe (more or less): http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/107835 and prepared it as described herein. When done, I added a goodly amount of grilled chicken thigh cut into strips. I thought the flavor to be just right. The only criticism my diners proffered was that the quantity was insufficient. Using fresh pasta was definitely key. I recommend it to those who have the time, patience, and equipment...although a rolling pin and a knife can substitute for a pasta machine when making fettuccine...

I have made this, and it is OK in a pinch, but I would not call it fettucine alfredo. That is made precisely as Carolina describes, actually I also add an egg sometimes, but I do not cook the sauce, I add the hot fettucine noodles to the sauce to cook it...(as a good Italian should ;-) )

Excuse me; did rl1856 from SC (below) use a recipe for 2 that calls for a whole stick of butter and 8 ounces of parmesan cheese? Plus cream? I don't doubt that this tastes great -- I could put butter, cream and cheese on shredded cardboard and it would taste terrific.

Quick and easy side dish, not sure if it would hold as a main course. But tasty and light; I liked it much better than the kind of fettuccine alfredo you get at say an Olive Garden.

This sauce just uses too much butter for me, and I can't bring myself to use heavy cream (since I want to watch fat etc.) to add flavor. I prefer doctoring up the WHITE SAUCE OR BECHAMEL SAUCE from this site with parmesan substituted for cheddar in the cheese sauce version. I even use 1% milk and it comes out rich and creamy.

This is one dish where the Americanized version is better. I have prepared the authentic recipe (which this one is) at home and have eaten it in several Italian restaurants- this recipe as prepared is good as a side dish, but does not stand up as main course. American version for 2: 12oz fresh egg fettucine 1/4 lb fresh sweet butter 6oz heavy cream 8oz grated parmesan (di parma) crushed black pepper Cook fettucine to al dente in salted boiling water. While fettucine is cooking, melt butter in a pan large enough to hold the fettucine after it has cooked. After the butter has melted add cream and stir in completely. Heat until bubbles form around edges of the pan. Add 6 oz grated parmesan and stir to incorporate and melt evenly, then add cracked pepper to taste. Add cooked fettucine, and toss to coat and incorporate all of the sauce. Divide among 2 plates and sprinkle remaining parmeson over the to. Serve immediately !

Good, but just not as flavorful as needed for a main-couse pasta dish. I like to jazz mine up with sliced mushrooms, garlic, and of couse, heavy cream. Options include chopped pasley and fresh ground nutmeg spinked on top in place of garlic. Grilled or marinated chicken strips make this a hearty dish. It's perfect served with a dry white like Pinot Grigio.

Well It was easy to make but I think the reason they made alfredo sauce was for dishes like these. It was pretty tasteless and I felt like it was a waste of money for all that fresh parmesean for this recipe. I added the measured amounts and everyone complained it was either too "oily, too cheesy or just didn't taste right. I think I will pass on this one for the future.

Very simple, very quick... delicious!

I found that this was rather ordinary and bland. As others have said, the cheese just didnt give it enough flavor for a main course pasta. I would probably make it again as some sort of side dish but with lots of changes.

This was a perfect mid-week meal. I added diced tomatoes that I sauted in a little more butter to the finished recipe and it was fantastic. I also used pecorino romano for more flavor.

I was rather surprised after reading all the reviews of this recipe to find that it turned out rather bland. The parmesan (the real kind) I used was just not flavorful enough to carry this as a main course. I even added extra cheese, but to no avail. The recipe is simple enough, so if/when I try it again it will be with a stronger cheese, perhaps pecorino. And regardless of authenticity, I still like the creamy variety better.

Great recipe. My mother got this same recipe on her visit to Italy, and we have been using this same version ever since (needless to say it is a really rich meal and not recommended for those watching weight or cholesterol etc.)

This recipe was great...I added crushed garlic into the boiling water to give it a hint of that flavor...and also grilled chicken in it is very good...this recipe is also very easy and i would make it often.

Wow, it looked too easy and I wasn't sure, but sure is good. I used egg noodles (couldn't find egg fettuccini). We didn't miss the milk a bit, and it is so much lighter than traditional alfredo. This is such a fast week night meal too. I had some leftover grilled tuna which was really terrific with the pasta. I would think grilled chicken would be good too.

This is an awesome and easy receipe! The great thing about it is that it takes only minutes, but is a good quality dinner. I use spinach fettuccine, and then grill chicken breasts with italian seasonings to make it interesting.

I like this recipe alot and have made it 4 times already since my husband keeps requesting it! The technique is what makes it better than it might appear in print with just butter and parmesan as ingredients -- mixing in the water makes it creamy-like. It's a very satisfying quick dinnner and though I love alredo w/ cream this is not as heavy. It takes my oven about 10 mins. to melt the butter.

Well the Romans may not use heavy cream when making fettuccine alfredo, but we certainly missed it. I found the egg pasta needs more then just butter and cheese(and I used fresh grated Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano) to give it good flavor. The family agreed that plain spaghetti with Parmigiano-Reggiano and butter is much better.

Now you say this recipe was produced in March 2003, I read it on 27 February 2003. Still great web page in my book. Just love ALL OF IT. Derry from Adelaide Australia.
