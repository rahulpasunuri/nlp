Not to get all technical and whatnot... but this recipe is misleading. The "Madame" in a Croque Madame means "with an egg on top". Otherwise it is a Croque Monsieur. This recipe is a Croque Monsieur with chicken instead of ham. Unless I am missing something - to me it seems Jacques has taken liberty with the classics in naming this recipe. Swapping the ham for chicken seems immaterial - it's the poached EGG that is the whole point to a "Madame" - and is the 'pièce de résistance' that elevates it from the banal 'grilled ham & cheese' into something far more sublime.

Good, but doesn't a Croque Madame have a fried egg on top? Otherwise, it's just a Croque Monsieur (even though that means ham & cheese in traditional french cooking)

Learn to read, Seattle. It has chicken in it - not in your usual dinner grilled cheese. It's those little differences that distinguish OK from great! Suppose instead of chicken, it had said chocolate?

Delicious, fattening, and buttery. A worthwhile treat of a french grilled cheese sandwich served up by a master of french cooking. And your point is, Seattle???

It's a grilled cheese sandwich with a French name!

"Can we have it again for dinner?" my husband asked. What could be wrong with a grilled cheese and poultry sandwich? Made it because I was once jealous when my friend's kid was eating grilled turkey and cheddar on wheat berry when we had a "fancy, adult" meal. (My friends and enemies both agree that I'm a Gourmande, and yet sometimes I just want simple food.) Used what I had on hand: oat bread, leftover roast goose, goose fat, edam cheese, green part of green onions, and the best hot sauce, tuong ot sriracha (Vietnamese-style hot sauce, used by all the sushi restaurants, made in USA, with rooster on the bottle, bottle says www.huyfong.com if that helps you find it, I have no financial interest in this hot sauce). Would have been even better to spread (instead of drip) the hot sauce very, very thinly over the layer of cheese or goosefat on the inside. This brand is just thick enough to spread. Would make it again the same way or with cheddar and turkey...If you hate the fatty crispness of grilled cheese sandwiches and Reubens, you could omit the fat on the outside of the bread, because it doesn't matter how thinly you spread it, you get that effect.

Delicious... and how can't it be with all tht butter! Not a healthy dish by any stretch of the imagination but it looks mouth-wateringly beautiful and tastes delicious. It won't disappoint -- as long as you're ready to work out afterwards.
