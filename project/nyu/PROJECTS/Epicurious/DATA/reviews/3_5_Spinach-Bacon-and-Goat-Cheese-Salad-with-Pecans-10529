We made this for a Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone raved about it. My boyfriend's stepmom later asked me for the recipe for "the best salad she's ever eaten". We cut back a little on the bacon fat, threw in some dried cherries, but otherwise followed this exactly.

I made this salad for my cousin who hates salads but loves bacon. I only used one tablesppon of the bacon fat for the dressing. It was a yummy and hearty salad. I will make it again to accompany a veg soup supper.

YUM! I used only 2 rashers of bacon - partly bc that's all I had on hand, partly so that this salad could fall within my parameters for a fairly healthy but tasty lunch - it was perfect! It was a bit more spinach, too - I get it loose rather than bagged, and like BIG salads :) Not at all too heavy. Toasted the pecans in bacon fat rather than oil, leaving just enough to make the dressing. I also added a little dollop of maple syrup to the dressing to help emulsify and balance the tart-on-tart.

Loved it! Didn't have goat cheese so I used blue cheese crumbles. Excellent!

I agree with the folks who find the bacon fat a little too much. Go easy on the fatty dressing, a little goes a long way. Sharp and crumbly cheese balances the richness better than a mild cheese, but watch out for anything too salty. This is a pretty rich mix- it begs some acidity. Lots of options to make it a more complex and balanced salad.

This was a darn good salad. To simplify I used pre cooked bacon; and for dressing i used vegetable oil, xtra cidar vinegar and added sugar. I also added tomatoes for some color.

Who wouldn't love a salad that tastes like bacon? This salad is amazing! I love salads with goat cheese anyway, and bacon is a good addition to anything, but the bacon fat actually gives the dressing a nice hearty texture, and mixed with the cider vinegar it's great. I have added dried cranberries and pine nuts and roasted tomatoes at various times, it's always good. And the salad really holds up the next day - the bacon fat makes it nice and stiff.

I have made this salad quite a few times. I use balsamic vinegar and add dried cherries. I've had to give out the recipe every time!

Yummy salad - everyone loved it. The idea of putting bacon grease in your dressing is kind of gross, but what can I say, it's tasty!

Make this all the time. I don't really use the bacon fat in the dressing - I find it too heavy. I just drain the fat as much as possible then add the olive oil until its warmed and add the vinegar. I spice my pecans, add sliced red onion and sometimes thin slices of apple. Yummy.

I really liked this salad, my husband thought it was good but not the best ever. This is a great winter salad as it is served warm and the cheese melts a little. Delicious!

Not as great as it sounds. The dressing needs something else. The bacon grease did not add that much flavor for us.

The bacon really adds a nice flavor. Very good salad; excellent with a meat main course.

This recipe was just missing sonething. The pecans were good with the cheese, but it just seemed that it needed more. It was only okay.

This is now THE salad in our house. I make it as written and have occasionally substituted fresh mozzerella for the goat cheese with fine results.

I recently had a salad like this at a restaurant and I loved it so much that I wanted to recreate it myself. This recipe turned out wonderfully! I used walnuts instead of pecans, and I did not use bacon grease in the dressing. This really was a very quick and simple salad that makes a great light meal. The goat cheese and the toasted nuts are essential!

Rating: 3
This was really, really good. The pecans tasted very sweet and, served warm, they were divine! I just used regular lettuce as it was all that I had, and it worked fine. If you only use a little bit of the bacon fat it gives that extra richness to the salad but certainly doesn't overwhelm it with grease. Yumm!

I made this for dinner last night and it was fabulous!!! It is important to toast the peacans to bring out their flavour - dont' skip this step. I did the dressing as said, but used 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 cider vinegar - delicious! Also threw in a hard boiled egg per plate and that worked well. Used herbed goat's cheese (log style) and it was lovely. Am having the leftovers today for lunch (yes, leftover salad!) and added some blanched asparagus with truly wonderful results. A keeper for sure. Good side, great main!

I used a bag of organic baby spinach and excellent bacon from Harrington's of Vermont. The bacon grease is no problem really, if you follow the directions carefully. Your cider vinegar should be first rate. Not the supermarket variety..save that for washing the windows. The combination of the pecans toasted in olive oil and the cheese is divine. A great salad. My family really loved it.

Very tasty but possibly a little more trouble than it was worth...

Loved the combination but did have to change the dressing a bit. Used both the drippings and olive oil but substituted Sherry wine vinegar for the cider vinegar and added about 1-1/2 teaspoons of brown sugar. Just needed pepper. Really a winner.

Fairly quick dish and is extremely tasty. Didn't have the cider vinegar, so substituted Basalmic Vinegar and loved it. Will make this dish quite often!

In a haste made the recipe with just the spinach, bacon, goats cheese and pecans. I let all my guests choose from store bought dressings. EVERYONE enjoyed. It was easier, faster and less messy to use the pre-cooked microwave bacon. And, for my vegetarian guests, simply served them without the bacon. (Blue Cheese was my choice of dressing which gave it an incredible flavor!) Would make every holiday and ocassion!

I made this recipe exactly as directed. It had a lot of potential, but the bacon drippings in the dressing were TERRIBLE. I may make it again, just substituting olive oil for bacon drippings. There is a reason that you do not see drippings used as oil in salad dressings frequently - it does not belong there. But the rest was great!

This salad is a hit whenever I make it for friends or family. It is a quick and easy pleasure that I would recommend to anyone.

This is one of the best salads I ever ate and also the least healthiest. I make it whenever I am going to go all out for a meal. It is a great starter for any kind of meal.

I made this the first time for a dinner party - the guest enjoyed it and I got more comments on the salad instead of the main dish.

I substituted turkey bacon, so there was no fat leftover to make the dressing with, which was fine with me. It was still delicious with olive oil, garlic wine vinegar, and salt and pepper. Awesome!

This recipe should be nicknamed "Salute to the Pig". I love bacon but it called for too much and putting bacon grease in the dressing was beyond overkill. It was enough to make me want to start keeping kosher and I'm not even Jewish!

This salad is the living example of the adage that you can add bacon (and in this case bacon fat) to anything and it will taste good. In a futile attempt to cut down on fat, I only used two slices of bacon (also only used about 3 cups of spinach) and 1 1/2 T of olive oil. Almonds were the only nut in my cupboard. They were fantastic. To further bastardize the recipe, I had no cider vinegar and selected white wine vinegar instead. Again, I felt the final product was stellar. My goat cheese was less the crumbled variety and more the very soft creamy kind which melts a beautiful goat cheese liquid all over everything. Simply and utterly divine.

I worried that the dressing wouldn't have enough flavor, but the cider vinegar makes it delicious. An easy and delicious salad that is hearty enough for a light dinner if served with bread.

Delicious! I love this salad. Next time I will cut down on the amount of bacon though--as much as I love bacon, it was too much.

I agree with all the previous positive reviews. We had this on a new spring night on the porch for a light dinner, and it was DELICIOUS. I was a little worried about all the bacon grease, but you use very little dressing--we had quite a bit leftover. Highly recommended.

I made this last night and I want more NOW! It was the tastiest salad ever. I was a little worried about the dressing lacking flavor but it was the goat cheese that made it all come together in the end. If you do make this salad, make plenty extra because you will eat all of it and want more!

I made it with walnuts (that's what I had in the pantry), but stuck to the recipe on everything else. Wasn't sure whether the spinach was supposed to wilt or not (it didn't), so I tossed it with the dressing first then added the bacon, cheese, and nuts. My guests loved this salad and had multiple helpings. I thought it was just okay. I did have the leftovers the next day, though, and I liked it better then.

I didn't toast the nuts with oil and used gorgonzola. Jihong really liked the salad as did the rest of the guests. It is a little fatty (even without bacon juice) and you should use the bacon fat instead for seasoning mashed potatoes, which also turned out great.

We just finished making this recipe, and we both like it. We used walnuts instead of pecans, and added tomatoes and a cucumbers.

I had made a pork roast and garlic roasted potatoes along with this salad. I'd just seen it prepared on your show and had to try it. After one bite of the salad, I decided the rest of the family could have all the roast and potatoes they wanted; the salad would be a great dinner for me. I am eating it as I write. Thanks!

The goat cheese melted and coated the spinach leaves after sitting for about 10-15 minutes, which seemed to really overwhelm all the other flavors in this salad. It still tasted good, but my recommendation is to eat this immediately after adding the dressing.

This salad is a bit all-encompasing, but it's definately worth it! My holiday guests all loved the goat cheese and bacon combination. I would definately recommend this salad to anyone because it is so tasty!!

OK, so I changed several things in this recipe :) but it was quite tasty. I used crumbled blue cheese and an inexpensive balsalmic vinegar. I also used that partcially cooked bacon so it didn't produce quite enough grease. All in all we thought it had great flavor and is a good addition to our salad rotation.

As you can see I rated this one a 4. I made it the same day as the broadcast and am planning to make it tonight for the 4th time. Super easy and very, very good. I have used different nut each time. Tonight it's to be a mixed bag of nuts. Also, I added some mandarin orange slices and artichoke hearts just for a variety.

OH WOW! I saw this today on the TV show and had to make it for dinner! I literally went to the store when Epicrious Tv ended. This salad was delicious. I really liked Chef Lomonaco's technique of using the skillet to make the dressing. will definitely keep for the future. YUM!
