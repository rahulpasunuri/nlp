These were really terrific and very easily to do. A welcome change and idea from simply making baked parsnips. 1st batch the oil was too cool so they didn't do very well, but after that, they were really excellent as I had the temperature correct. I didn't end up using any salt because thought they were fine as they were, nicely sweet with a soft crunch. Paired them with grilled steaks and sliced tomato, and nothing was left over.

Can I write that these are freaking amazing here???? I used 2 parsnips for 2 people and they were gone. YUM.

Very very easy with great pizzazz for a result. Good taste. Kept well, even until the next day. Served with a variation of the venison w/green peppercorn sauce. A big hit at our house! Will do again, even tho frying is not really our style. I would also recommend one root per person. They shrink when fried.

Delicious and simple. While it was a little bit painstaking to peel the parsnips; they fried up quickly and were a tasty side dish. I found that I could only peel the meaty part of the vegetable, not the core itself.

I made this for the accompanying venison with demi-glace but they were so good I ended up making double. I fried them in olive oil instead of veg oil. Mine did keep and stay crisp the next day. I had the rest on top of a bowl of chestnut soup. Parsnip chips will be a recurring garnish at my house.

I would plan one parsnip per person. I also do not think that they can be made a day ahead as the recipe says.

I served these heaped in a pile over a steak pie. They looked really good and tasted great too. Think next time I will cut into thicker ribbons and serve with some tarragon mayo.

Really easy! Great snack by itself or as a topping(garnish) for almost any dish. Made them for my girl on Valentines as a topping to Venison with demi glace. She couldn't wait for me to make more the next night. Be ware the temperature of the oil. My first batch turned black in 10 seconds.
