Superb. Anchos give the sweet potatoes a nice balance, and a very slight kick. I've been making this for about seven years, and it is ALWAYS a hit.

Just okay for my taste. I thought the concept was better than the final product.

The sweet potato and ancho flavors compliment each other surprisingly well! I probably add more chili than the recipe calls for because we like things spicy. My husband also prefers it in a chunkier, mashed potato style than as a puree, but it's a favorite recipe of ours.

I LOVE this! I made it for the boyfriend on Valentine's Day -- along with cornish game hens, roasted veggies in a balsamic vinegar reduction, and raspberry-chocolate molten cakes. Let me just tell you -- I wolfed down the vast majority of the sweet potato puree -- fighting off the boyfriend as I went. Snuck some extra chiles in there, too - yummmm yummmm yummmm!

This recipe is DIVINE. So So So good. I boiled the sweet potatoes with a little salt and sugar instead of baking, which made it super creamy and less like mashed potatoes (which is what I was avoiding, so that was good). My guests devoured it!

Just the right amount of kick for the potatoes. Taste great, less filling.

Easy to make and tasty! Not too spicy - just enough kick. We made this to go as a side dish with smoked pork chops and it turned out to be a great combination. We're making it again today (Thanksgiving!) to go with turkey and fixings.

Never ever put starchy things like sweet potato in a food processor - they turn to glue! I know better, but in my Thanksgiving rush I decided to chance it. So flavor was good, a nice change from the sweet sticky traditional things - but major complaints from my crew on the texture. No sweet potato leftovers on my table. Will repeat after they have forgotten and use a hand masher or ricer instead of my trusty Cuisinart.

Dish was delicious but I would add 2-3 tbsps of sugar or other sweetener to give the potatoes a more complex taste.

Great side dish. The chili-cream sauce part of the recipe would be great in other recipes (a substitute for enchilada sauce, maybe?). Too bad my hubby and son weren't impressed - too unusual for them!
