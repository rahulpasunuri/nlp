We happen to like this a lot and have made it for my daughter and her family and usually give the extra sauce to my aunt and her husband and all think it's great. My daughter asked for the recipe. I usually serve it with pasta (penne or spaghetti).

EVO is extra-virgin olive oil. My sauce from scratch with fresh ingredients beats this hands down!

What, for the benefit of those in the antipodes, is EVO?

"Old-fashioned meat sauce?" Bolognese sauce has ground meat. Traditional meat sauce does not, nor does it rely on beef (except sometimes in combination with pork and/or veal), which does not provide adequate flavorings for the sauce. I'm amazed at the total lack of authentic sauce recipes on this site. The original thing isn't hard to make--unless you use all the wrong ingredients.

Added more herbs and EVO. Served with freshly prepared ravioli.

Basil and oregano are a definate must for this recipe. overall the recipe is good but the almost required spices are absent. I also added onion and some celery to add some very plesant taste to the recipe. 1 tsp of basil and oregano work well then add to taste.

There are many much better meat sauce recipes than this! I agree it is bland and needs much more olive oil, as well as herbs, garlic, etc. Disappointing.

PURCHASED cheese ravioli!! Why is this on this site?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The sauce was to bland. The garlic should have been minced to provide some extra zest. The sauce did not cook long enough to let the flavors marry.There should, in my humble opinion, have a little more extra virgin olive oil added.

I think that this is an excellent recipe for people who like cheese and pasta. I happen to love cheese myself. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.
