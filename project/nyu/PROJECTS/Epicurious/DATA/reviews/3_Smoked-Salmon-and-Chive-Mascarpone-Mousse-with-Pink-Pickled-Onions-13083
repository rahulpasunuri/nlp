I made this for company and it was GREAT!! As suggested, I omitted the onions and they weren't missed. I used light sour cream and it didn't compromise the flavor at all. I don't know why the rating is so low.

Very very good, but omit the onions, they just don't go with it.

Very delicious inspite of the error of 3 lines that seem to have strayed in from some other recipe.

This recipe seems to have an ERROR under "To prepare the salmon:" Paragraphs 5 and 6 and 7 seem to be UNRELATED to this recipe with NO mention of MUSHROOMS anywhere in the ingredients. Que pasa?
