This basic recipe was amazing but I actually made many changes. I used fig instead of lingonberry preserves and used a 1:1 ratio of broth to wine for the sauce and it thickened up nicely. I make fingerling potatoes instead of polenta and added some of the duck fat. Indulgent but delicious!

I've made this a couple of times now. Wasn't stuck on the polenta. I found it "conflicts" with the duck and sauce. Now I substitute a side of pasta sauteed with musnrooms and herbs which works much better. The Lingonberries are also known as Partridgeberries in case you have trouble finding them.

After the rae reviews, we were disappointed - especially after chasing down the ligonberry preserves. It was kind of bland. We have several other duck recipies that rank well ahead of this one.

I've never made duck before, but this was NEARLY foolproof. You do have to watch the searing, as differences in the size of the duck breasts led me to nearly burn one. the sauce also never really thickens, as many have noted, but it is excellent. I had to use "preiselbeeren" since I couldn't find Lingonberries in Germany, but it was still excellent. The polenta is OUTSTANDING. All in all, a great and pretty easy meal for company, as you can make the sauce and the polenta ahead of time.

Fantastic and surprisingly fool proof. We made the duck breasts for dinner with friends. The duck and sauce were delicious, and the low-labor recipe was perfect for the situation. Instead of messing with the multi-step polenta, we served the duck with parboiled potatoes that we crisped in a hot oven with olive oil and garlic and then tossed with parsely, and some brocolli rabe sauteed with garlic, olive oil, and hot pepper. A few notes: Like another reviewer, I wondered about the thinness of the sauce after reducing it for almost an hour, and added more lingonberries, which boosted the fruit if not the thickness. The sauce, I've concluded, is not meant to be the ooey-gooey sludge I expected after so much reducing, but rather the glossy rich liquid we ended up with. Novice duck-breast cookers (and with a few glasses of wine already in us), we didn't render as much fat from the breasts as the recipe directed. I ended up not eating the skin and its centimeter of fat. My husband ate his and called it luscious.

This is just awesome. I scaled it down to make just for myself - a decadent weeknight meal while my boyfriend is out of town - and it's just fabulous. I wouldn't change a thing, except that I also made the polenta soft. Used a drizzle of black truffle oil instead of white because I wanted a bit more truffle flavor. I am eating it right now and drinking the same California Zin I used in the sauce. Perfect.

For anyone who's having trouble finding lingonberry (and other hard to find) preserves, try the food shop in IKEA.

although my husband and i liked this dinner, i found that the sauce didn't reduce as directed- i kept it boiling for double the time specified and still had way more than 1 cup. the duck itself came out well (my first time cooking duck) as did the polenta, but i was disappointed in the sauce. i will try again, using less liquid to start with.

I have made this recipe twice. It's fabulous. I added more lingonberry jam (1 cup) which I think added more flavor. This sauce would be great on chicken as well. I highly recommend it.

I forgot to check the Yes I would make this again box and it brought the percentage down. It should be 100%.

I made this recipe last night for a dinner party of 8. As my guests were leaving, I heard one comment that it was the best duck they'd ever had! I used 8 Moulard breasts and had 4 left over (guess what's for dinner tonight!). I scored the skin in a diamond pattern and seared them skin side down on top of the stove for 8 minutes or so until very brown, then popped them in a 425 oven for about 10 minutes. They were very pink and tender. . . and delicious. I rendered about 2 cups of fat (and removed from pan) before putting the duck in the oven. For the sauce, I sauteed shallots, then added approx. 3 cups red wine and reduced, then added one 32.oz. box of Swanson's organic beef broth, one can chicken broth, double the thyme and bay leaves and reduced that down then added a 10 oz. jar of Lingonberry preserves. Just before serving I swirled in several pats of unsalted butter. Delicious. I served the polenta soft and added lots more truffle oil and 4 oz. cream cheese. Next time I might even add a little cream. The truffle oil is divine and I will make this polenta lots. I served this with broccolini with melted butter & olive oil with Meyer lemon zest and juice and garlic.

Absolutely delicious. Served with sautéed asparagus and baby broccoli. Add a full bodied red wine and you're good to go! I served "CREME BRULEE WITH BERRIES" from Bon Appétit September 2003 for dessert and everyone at the table continues to remember the meal lustfully. Great recipe!!

This recipe is relatively easy for how wonderful it tastes. I actually made several changes- I marinated tri tip in port, soy sauce and thyme, then grilled it alongside the polenta. The sauce I substituted apricot preserves and brown sugar for ligonberry, and it was great with the tri tip. Try this- you won't regret it!

Fantastic!!! Made this for a fun weeknight dinner. Did not make Polenta into cakes, but still excellent. Try this!!

The four people at dinner the night I made this all agreed it was the best duck they'd ever had. Amazing recipe. I served the polenta soft, and it made a nice cushion for extra sauce. I also pulled the crispy skin off when I flipped the breasts over (before I put them in the oven). I drained the fat at that point as well. The resulting duck was amazingly tender, not greasy and simply delicious. Serve this with a Syrah from Walla Walla and it'll be hard to get them to leave!

WOW! I have had duck breast with various sauces, but this was truly special. The Lingonberry preserves were hard to find, but well worth the effort. The sauce was rich and complex; perfect with the meat. I slightly altered the cooking method (and time) here based on other recipes I read. I placed the breasts into a cold (not preheated)Iron skillet (this is supposed to render more of the fat from the skin). I then browned the skin on medium heat, which took about 7-8 minutes. It took 4-5 minutes in the oven to get to medium-rare. (I did not use Muscovy duck breasts.) This was my first time cooking duck breast, and it was easy to do! I broiled the polenta instead of grilling it, and I used White Truffle Oil in the recipe. The polenta was delicious. This meal was truly a Valentine's Day keeper, and was better than I could have expected from most restaurants. I paired this with a pink bubbly, and followed it with Chocolate Panna Cotta in Port-Balsamic-Cherry Sauce, also on this website. YUM!!
