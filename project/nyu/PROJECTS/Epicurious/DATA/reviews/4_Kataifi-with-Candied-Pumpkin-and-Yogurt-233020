I made this for a group of friends & everybody asked for the recipe. Wonderful dessert & well balanced flavors.

Perfect for the fall, and much more interesting that the usual use of pumpkin. Easy to prepare and a very nice contrast of textures. I would definitely make this over again and again.

My family thought this was absolutely amazing. Once you make the syrup, it's very easy to assemble. We'll make it again for guests.
