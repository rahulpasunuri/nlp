Tried this cake both ways and liked it better without the chocolate ganache,also added a bit more marzipan and a little heavy cream into the batter, my husband LOVED IT BOTH WAYS!!! I've made many a cheese cake, but this one takes the cake!!! thank you!!

Marzipan has always been my favorite candy and this cake is always a big hit with everyone. I never have any leftover. Just too yummy!

This is an incredible cheesecake - probably the best I've ever had. But I've found I like it a lot better without the chocolate topping. To me the topping is what masks the beautiful almond flavor (one chief complaint of those below). On its own the cheesecake is sublime, with the topping it packs a punch -- totally a mater of preference.

I haven't made this yet, but one of the comments said that the marzipan flavor was too subtle. When I make this, I will try using almond extract instead of vanilla.

This cheesecake was excellent!! I took the posted advice and used more almond paste than what it called for (about 3 tbsp. more or 3/4 of a bar that you'd buy in the store). I also used zweiback crackers for the crust (something that I use for most cheesecakes) and it was great!! It was a huge hit with everyone who ate it, and we're all big marzipan fans! I plan on making this recipe again soon. Next time I might try almond extract instead of vanilla for an even stronger almond flavor!

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was divine! I made a chocolate crust instead of the plain graham cracker and used a little more marzipan than called for, since I am a big marzipan fan. I may serve it with a little choclate on the plate next time. Definitely a keeper!

This cheesecake came out nicely and looks very pretty. My guests really enjoyed it. I, on the other hand, have made better cheesecakes, so I don't plan to make this one again. The marzipan flavor was so subtle that I was a bit disappointed.

I haven't made this version, but if you want an OUTSTANDING marzipan cheesecake go to thatsmyhome.com and try the marzipan cheesecake with raspberry sauce - it's perfection.

This cheesecake is by far the best I have ever had. I also used 8 oz of marzipan instead of almond paste and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added a dash of almond extract to the cheesecake and a dash of vanilla to the chocolate topping and a dash of cinnamon to the crust. I used ghirardelli dark chocolate and lite cream cheese. I made it for my husbands birthday, and he's already asking for it again next year!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever had!!!!!!!!! I used 8.8 oz of imported marzipan from Italy and only 1/2 cup of sugar. I also used imported Belgian chocolate on top.

This cheesecake is by far the best I have ever had. I make it at least every 3 months and then give one or two away. The teachers at my childrens' school can't wait for me to make it and the family fights over the last piece. I have found that even people who don't usually like cheesecake love this one.

Not enough almond flavor - next time I would add a dab of almond extract to bring it out. Also, I cooked mine in an 8" pan, cut the temp down 25 degrees, and cooked it an extra 25 minutes. It came out fine and gives you a thicker, more presentable cheesecake. I have a thing against "thin" cheesecakes...so there's my beef!

Very good, but not nearly marzipan-y enough. Next time I'll try replacing most of the sugar with marzipan. I also would cut down on the chcocolate topping... in fact, a drizzle of chocolate sauce would probably be better than the thick chocolate shell recommended here.

This is my 12 year old daughter's favorite recipe and she requests it often. It is very easy and tastes great!

This was a GREAT cheesecake! I often find the flavor of cream cheese in a cheesecake too overpowering, but the almond flavor really cut the sourness of the cream cheese. It was easy to make and delicious!

I'm not much for sweets, but this cheesecake is so rich and so pleasing to everyone, it's hard to beat. It's the perfect accompaniment to a festive meal.

This was the first homemade cheesecake that I ever made and it turned out wonderfully! I made it for four picky teenage boys who devoured the whole thing in less than an hour. I highly recommend expending the time and energy needed to complete this recipe.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious. My husband and I have a weekly dinner with friends and I decided to make it as a simple dessert. Everyone loved it and couldn't get enough. I was asked to make it again for our friend's birthday.
