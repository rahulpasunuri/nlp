It was great! Worked fine with halibut steaks instead of filets. I added a bit of dry mustard powder and used canned diced tomatoes to save time. I topped it all with fresh chopped parseley for color and flavor. Yum!

This makes an awful lot of mediocre sauce. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, and there are certainly better ways to prepare fresh fish. The title is misleading, as well--it should be called "Sea Bass with Tomato and Cumin Sauce." The tomatoes overwhelm the dish visually and don't add much flavor-wise.

This is a good dish, especially if you are looking for a different way to cook sea bass or halibut. I often add a little wine into the dish and have tried variations on the spicing to make the dish more north african or indian depending on my mood. It's worth a try.

As suggested, I added 1/2 t coriander, and the flavor was wonderful. I also used diced canned tomatoes, and they were fine, but I bet fresh tomatoes would be scrumptious.

This is a nice, easy way to prepare fish. The sauce was very cumin-heavy, and a little one-dimensional, though. I'm going to try it again, reducing the cumin and adding ground coriander. I used ling cod and canned tomatoes as good tomatoes are hard to find this time of year. Would definitely be better with fresh, if they're nice and flavorful.
