I agree 100% with atmeh from Birmingham's review. This gravy is definitely different from traditional and it's really tasty. One guest at our dinner said he didn't like regular gravy but he loved this! Would definitely recommend it to go along with the Tea-Brined turkey recipe.

I see that some reviewers didn't like this gravy because it's not a typical gravy. Well, that's one of the things I liked about it! It had a nice (slightly tart) lemony-ness, and the tea/broth gave it a good overall depth of flavor. I enjoy traditional brown gravy too, but this is a tasty new option

We had 23 people over for Thanksgiving, and not one of them liked this gravy. The taste wasn't bad, it just wasn't what we wanted. Everyone preferred the Roasted Onion & Shallot gravy that we made with a second turkey.

Amazing gravy, went wonderfully with the bird and was actually quite easy to prepare during the time that the turkey was resting. Can't wait to make this again next year.

Made almost this recipe for both Thanksgiving and Christmas 2004. I liked it because it wasn't the same old pan gravy that my hubby goes ape for. That said, he prefers old reliable and says this is too sweet. Here's what I did to customize to my family's tastes: no carrots. Cooked the neck meat in the broth but did not use the neck meat, heart, or gizzard in the ultimate product. Cooked a few hours ahead and reheated, which saved a lot of last-minute effort.

Just finished the gravy, will be grilling the turkey tomorrow. The gravy is delicious! I didn't use low-salt chicken broth,as recommended, and wish that I had. It's a bit too salty, so if you plan to make it, use the low-sodium broth. That way you can control the final flavor.
