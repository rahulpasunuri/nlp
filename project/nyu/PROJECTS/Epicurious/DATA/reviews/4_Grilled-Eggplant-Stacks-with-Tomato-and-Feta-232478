Delicious. I actually used grape tomatoes that I had sauteed until soft. (Not ideal but still good) I chose a creamy french feta that was perfect for the dish. The basil gave the dish a unique twist to the eggplant. Overall, I will definitely make this again - probably in the summer when heirloom tomatoes can make this over the top.

Delicious! I didn't bother separating the basil from the oil. I brushed the eggplant with the basil olive oil, and then used the rest as directed. Don't worry if you don't follow the recipe to a T, it will still be good! For example, my stacks were eggplant, tomato, feta, eggplant. Some of my stack had another layer of tomato and feta, some didn't. No stack had more than 2 slices of eggplant. I also used the whole eggplant and whole tomato and didn't worry if the stacks didn't look perfect. Mine looked darn good regardless!

A friend fondly reminded me of this recipe which I made for her 2 years ago! I did make it easier for myself. Every year I make my own pesto to freeze, which I used with added olive oil. I prefer my tomatoes fresh, so I added thick sliced feta to the eggplant during grilling, and then stacked with the tomato, without added heating time. 4 forks for taste and presentation.

Phenomenal Recipe. I highly recommend it. We used a grill pan over wood briquettes...mmmm...

I have prepared this twice. It's a great meatless main course with a tossed salad. My husband loves it!

Beautiful presentation and lovely flavour. A great side dish for company!

I'll make this again, but leave off the final tomato/eggplant layer of the stack. The stacks as made were beautiful, but unwieldy. I actually think that increasing the surface area ratio would improve flavor, too.

This recipe took a lot longer to make than I expected. I do think that it was worth the time. It came out much better than I expected and is a beautiful side dish.

Excellent side dish with grilled lamb chops!! This is delicious and impressive. Fresh basil is key, of course. This is our new summer grill favorite.

I absolutely loved this recipe. It is easy to make.

I've made this countless times, exactly to the recipe's directions. It's colorful, has great presentation, and is DEEElicious. It's very filling, and is all the veggie needed for a side dish. You must make it!

This recipe was simple to make & delicious to eat. A friend who doesn't even care for eggplant raved! I didn't bother firing up the grill, but instead broiled the eggplant in the oven.

Great recipe, great presentation, great tastes. The recipe sounds fussier than it is. I grilled the eggplant/basil oil several hours before dinner, assembled the stacks, baked them in a 450? oven. We used fresh mozzarella because we had no feta on hand. I'll make it often.

Excellent. I didn't have a grill or grill pan so I broiled the eggplant, created the stacks as described and then baked for almost 20 minutes. Rave reviews as a first course. Used heirloom tomatoes too!

Yummy. I used the red wine vinegar/ rosemary vinegrette. Next time I will add a little garlic to it. This can be a basic recipe and you can alter the cheese, the dressing....I will make this as as app for my next dinner party.

Very good, but try this easier and more delicious variation instead of the basil oil: brush both the eggplant and the tomatoes with a viniagrette made with olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced rosemary, salt & pepper. Grill the tomatoes as well, on the coolest part of the grill, for 1 minute per side, then stack & grill as directed. The rosemary and vinegar are key - I've had this both ways in the past week (inundation of eggplants & tomatoes from my garden), and the rosemary version is far superior. Four forks!

Quick, easy, delicious! I agree with the people who said not to bother separating the basil solids from the oil.

Mixed a clove of chopped garlic with basil into olive oil and brushed eggplant and tomato slices. Grilled eggplant on one side and added the tomatoes and feta slices on top after flipping and grilled til done. Spread panini with basil/garlic oil and served sandwich style. Excellent!

Delicious! I will definitely make this again!

Wow! This was really really easy and delicious. I had some pesto on hand so I just whisked in a bit of extra virgin and used that in replace of the homeade basil oil. Great summer side or light veggie main - my boyfriend (meat-eater) and I (veg) loved it!

Absolutely excellent. I could live on it. I made it exactly as written and would not change a thing. I sliced my feta rather than crumbling. Why crumble when you can slice? And I finished it in my toaster oven, since baking in a gas grill adds nothing to the flavor of a dish. Yum yum. I would definitely make this for company.

I used to make a dish very similar to this, using goat cheese instead of feta. I found that a lightly seasoned red pepper puree drizzled on top added a nice finishing touch. Try it!

If you like eggplants you will love this recipe. I made it for a dinner party i had, and my guest were raving about it. I used it as one of my appetizers

I've made this dish a few times. I've used both traditional eggplant and the asian variety (smaller stacks). This is a fabulous recipe even if your not a fan of eggplant and/or basil.

Wonderful. A huge hit with my vegetarian as well as meat-eating guests. It's also delicious the next day.

I've made this three times now, and this last time I didn't have feta on hand so I used cream cheese with equally great results. I'm a lazy cook and don't mind the basil/oil process at all. It really makes the dish.

We are eggplant lovers in our house so this was right up our alley. We loved it and could not believe how filling. This is a meal all in its own. Great recipe with fantastic flavors

I'm so glad I made this! I hesitated but it was very easy and yummy! I used some leftover basil oil I had made from the French Laundry cookbook. Lovely to look at too!

I made this for a barbecue for guests -it was great! Very flavourful. I made it again using zucchini instead of eggplant which was also great.

This was delish. It was such a nice and easy side dish. I did skip the basil oil procedure. I just let some olive oil sit for 20minutes with some dried basil and a crushed garlic clove before making the dish. It turned out very well this way. The dish got yumms from my husband who rated it by saying it was a 'wow'. So this will be in my keeper file. I highly recommend this dish.

We tried this last night for dinner guests and it was a delicious side to tenderloin steaks. Everyone raved about them. Will certainly be a repeat.

Outstanding!! This is a GREAT way to showcase eggplant. My wife doesn't eat anything with feet (only seafood). In contrast if I can catch it I'll eat it. We both LOVED this one. Definitly will make again!!

We had this first at a relative's home, and made it two days later ourselves. Excellent. Didn't mind the basil-oil mess, but appreciate the suggestions about skipping it. Will skip it too next time. There will be a next time for this one. Terrific.

Made with fresh eggplant and tomatoes just picked from the garden, made this dish. The basil and oil was messy. Next time I'll pass the draining step,too. The basil solids were great smeared on bread and grilled.

I agree that the basil oil was messy and a hassle. Loved the flavor, especially with the feta. Did the whole thing indoors (grill pan, oven, etc.), no problem.

Hey this is an easy one and nice to look at too. I just added the basil to the oil and slapped it on the layers. I'm a bit lazy that way. Everyone loved it, including my eggplant hating husband, and I could prepare it ahead of time and finish it when the meat came off the grill. So that always works for me!

Rating: 4
This was quite easy to make and absolutely delicious. Also surprisingly filling. I have to agree that draining and separating the basil oil was a bit of a mess and felt like a waste--in the future I probably won't worry about it. A commercial basil oil might work well too (maybe with a leaf of fresh basil in the stack layers?) Will definitely do this again!

This was wonderful- cooked eggplant on bbq, finished the dish in the oven. Fantastic flavor, and beautiful presentation. I used both red and yellow tomato for more color-our company loved this dish- and we did too! No need really to drain basil oil from solid- it seperates on it's own, without the mess-
