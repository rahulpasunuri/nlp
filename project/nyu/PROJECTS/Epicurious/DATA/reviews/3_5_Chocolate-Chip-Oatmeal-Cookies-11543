This is our favorite cookie recipe without a doubt. I now make a few slight changes. I use Ghiradelli 60% cacao chocolate chips which are large and not as sweet. I only use 1 cup of brown sugar and also add a tablespoon of Chia seed for extra texture and fiber. I took 2 batches (with my changes) to a family gathering at the shore with very picky children. They were gone in 2 1/2 hours. A great cookie recipe!

So tasty! Definitely more cake-like than crispy. A reviewer said to leave out the baking soda to make more crisp. Good foundation recipe to add whatever you want--as most of the reviewers have done.

Unbelievable! These were great! Wonderful texture because of the oatmeal, soft, chewy, I couldn't get enough, nor could the group that I made them for. I will make this recipe from now on!

This recipe is great! I added toasted coconut, about a quarter cup more oats than it asked for, orange zest, cinnamon, a teaspoon of honey and used raisins instead of chocolate chips...I guess I made a totally different cookie with the same base, but they were DELICIOUS!

This is the PERFECT cookie recipe. I've been making these for years, and they are always a hit. However, we slightly changed the ratio of oats and chocolate chips. We do only 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cup oats.

I increased the oats, omitted the white sugar, added some sliced brazil nuts, cinnamon and fresh ginger. (Ok... I altered it quite a bit). But it turned out so well! I love how easy this recipe is to alter.

I loved these cookies. Like the other reviewers, I also used 2:1 oat to flour ratio instead, withheld the baking powder, and no white sugar. Instead of chocolate chips I chopped figs and stirred them in. So delish! The figs really added an extra earthy dimensions to them.

Made these tonight! I made a few changes - Added 1 cup toasted pecan chips and 1 cup unsweetened coconut. I also used 6 oz of semisweet chocolate chunks instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips. Delicious!

So good! I made a batch tonight and have to try to stop myself from eating them all at once. I made some changes as well, following the advice of other reviewers: cut the granulated sugar and baking powder. Added about 1 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. Switched the amounts of oats and flour (2 cups oats, 1 cup flour). I added about 1/2 tsp salt, but next time I might not add any. Baked for 10 minutes. They are excellent! Soft and chewy and really good.

this recipe was amazing, althought i made a few changes. Instead of 2 cups of all-purpose flour i put 1 cup, and instead of 1 cup of the rolled oats, i put 2. i made these twice once using butter as written, and once using becel (ran out of butter). the ones made with becel turned out extremely light and fluffy but equally flavourfull and chewy. i would definately reccomend using becel.

I've made these several times -- I usually leave out the granulated sugar, and add cinnamon to taste. Turns out well. I also have added additional oats, and cut down a little on the flour.

Rating: 2
They are decent enough cookies, but they weren't what I wanted. I was hoping for a more oatie cookie with a bit of a crisp. They were too fluffy for me. There was too much flour to oat in the mixture.

Rating: 3
I was pleasantly surprised after all the criticism. I did follow some of the recommended changes and made a few of my own. I put the dough in the fridge for a while before baking and had no spreading problems. I used less salt, in my case just a pinch of Kosher. I did use the baking powder, but not quite as much as the recipe called for. I also put the oats through the food processor for a few pulses so the oats were not as coarse. The cookies have good flavor and texture.

Rating: 3
So many people have negative things to say about this recipe, but I loved it. I definitely made a couple pretty significant changes though: *Take out the baking powder- it gives the cookies a bread/cake like consistency. I also used 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 cup brown sugar instead of the amounts they recommend. I agree with everyone else about cutting the salt in half too. My friends said these were the best ever, and the 3 of us went through the entire batch in a weekend. I'm already making more.

To be honest, they're not bad cookies. They're just nothing special. I'm going to continue looking for the perfect oatmeal chocolate chip cookie!

These cookies are good, not great. Made to the recipe, the oatmeal feels like an accidental ingredient. So I upped the oatmeal by another 1/2 cup and threw in some chopped dried cherries (yummy addition!). For me, 11 minutes at 375 worked best for a "crisp on the outside, soft on the in" cookiee. And I'd reduce the salt as many have sugggested too.

If you're looking for oatmeal cookies with chocolate chips, use the recipe under the lid of Quaker oats and just add the choolate chips. These cookies are good, but they aren't very oatmeal-ee. I was disappointed.

Rating: 3
Easy, tasty recipe. The cookies were crispy on the outside and slightly soft inside. I followed other reviewers' tips and halved the salt, doubled the oats, while using 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of shortening (instead of 2 sticks of butter). Also, to counteract any spreading, I stuck the dough in the refrigerator for about 1/2 hour before baking. There was no spreading anywhere.

My wife and I plan to make these again. We used 3 egg whites, light butter and whole wheat flour and they turned out great!

I decreased the salt as many suggested and added a dash of cinnamon. These cookies were not that great....initially cake like and then crunchy when cool. I was hoping for a chewier cookie. I thought the butter on the baking sheet was unnecessary since all it did was make the bottom of the cookie a dark brown. I would also suggest adding some chopped walnuts.

these cookies were medium-bad. not oatmeally enough!! if you must make them, triple the recommended salt and vanille. it was a huge effort to make these - you really let us down, Gormet!

We made these for a 4th of July picnic and since I was busy with another dish, my husband was in charge of the cookies. Since he is not the creative type, gastronomically speaking, he followed the recipe to the T. They came out great; chewy, crispy, sweet with plenty of melty chocolaty bits. They disappeared faster than any other dessert there. A shame since I was looking forward to leftovers. Now I'm making them again with my son who is four and we should hopefully have a good batch this time as well.

Advice responding to suggestions in countless reviews below: Salt: I cut back to 3/4 t & suspect the 1 t wasn't too much. Sugar: try eliminating the 1/4 white sugar. I chopped up around 10 oz. good bittersweet chocolate in chunks (excellent) : perfect amount. DECREASE SPOONFUL-SIZE. Dough really spreads. 2 sheets in my oven took longer than 15 mins. 375 degrees? Burnt! 1 sheet at 350 w/ smaller cookies: 10-12 mins.: perfect. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
These are really simple and great. I refridgerated the batter overnight before baking them and they didn't spread at all. They were cute little drop cookies and came out perfectly in about 12 minutes. I also made a vegan (non-dairy/non-eggs) version using margarine and egg replacer and they were perfect.

THEY ARE SO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My whole family tries to get my mom's attention away so they can snag some dough. Also really good without chocolate chips. My favorite cookies in the world!

These came out ultra thin (which I loved) and nice and crispy along the edges. The color was nice and golden. I used parchment paper instead of a butttered sheet. Be sure to allow room for the cookies to spread. Overall- excellent and a recipe worth holding on to.

Check it out: I used dark brown sugar instead of light; I used 1 cup white choclate chips and only 3/4 cup semisweet choclate chips; and I threw in 1 cup of chopped walnuts. My yield was different, too: about three dozen, but I like 'em a little large. These are the bomb, folks!

My husband said these are the best cookies he's ever had. They WERE to die for right out of the oven (soft inside and the perfect crispness outside), but I thought they were just OK the next day however. I took the advice of past reviewers and used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening, I doubled the oats and cut the salt in half. Twelve minutes in the oven seemed perfect, however next time I will underbake them to see if they are softer/chewier the next day...

Rating: 3
I think this recipe made for a pretty good cookie. I followed some of the advice and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and also added 3/4 c of oats. I also used chunk chocolate chips. The recipe says it makes 72 cookies - this batch certainly did not make 72 cookies - I only got 36 cookies out of it so double it up if you are looking for quantity!

I have made these three times, and normally halve the amount of salt. They are delicious.

Rating: 2
I thought this was a good base for a recipe, but it needed quite a bit of doctoring. I took others' advice and used half margarine, half vegetable shortening. I also added an extra 3/4 cup of oatmeal, and will probably add more next time. I left the chocolate chips as is and didn't think there was too much of those. The cookies baked up perfectly. I took them to work and they were gone - got lots of compliments too. I only gave it two forks because it needed this much help, but I will make it again.

Rating: 3
Definitely sweet enough despite what some reviewes say. As for the texture (crisp vs. fluffy) I found that the cookie sheet influences it. For the same batch, I used a regular non-stick cookie sheet and a thicker enameled pan with tinfoil so I could do prep one sheet as the other bakes. The thicker pan produced a thinner crisper cookie while the thin sheet was fluffier... I am assuming the thinner cookie sheet cooked the bottom of the cookies faster so it didn't spread as much. Good cookies!

These cookies were fantastic. They disappeared faster than anything I've ever made.

We loved these cookies because they came out so crunchy. The only changes I made was to grind up the oatmeal and use 8oz instead of 12oz of chocolate chips. I also froze a bunch of uncooked cookies which I made another time --325 degrees for 15 minutes. They came out great.

This was a very good, solid recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I am a chocolate lover and even I would reduce the amount of chips to 8-10 ounces. It was chocolate overload. The cookies had a really nice shape. Not too flat.. they had some height to them and baked into delicious looking mounds. Watch them carefully. Mine cooked in just over half the time but I also suspect my oven runs a little hot. I skipped adding any nuts and might add sunflower and walnuts next time for fun, and to balance out the sweetness. I would disregard the gooseliver comment as it seems the comment was either false and gratuitous, or the butter used was rancid, and having been served cookies made with rancid butter by my grandmother once, sadly, I know they do not taste like goose liver.

I agree with the review describing the cookies as "chocolate chip with oatmeal". I too added an extra 1/2 cup of oats, I also used Giardelli double dark chips mixed in with semi sweet and melted half of the butter. My result was delicous. True there is more chocolate than oat but who cares? Also there was no "sugary after taste" that so many cookies have.

A great basic chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. That said...I don't like a crisp cookie so i made it half butter(taste)half shortening(chewy). It was great.

This did NOT yield a crisp cookie! I'm not sure that's a complaint--the cookies were thick and chewy, which is fine. But they didn't have an oatmeal flavor or texture to them, and I didn't think they were as good as either regular chocolate chip cookies or regular oatmeal raisin cookies.

These cookies are good, but you must be in the mood for a crispy treat! I used 1 3/4 c. chips and substituted some gourmet milk chocolate chips for semi-sweet. Also, I was out of light brown sugar so I used dark brown and they still tasted great.

These are delicious cookies, the very kind that cause me to hardly ever buy cookies even from the "best" bakeries. I can think of only one place within miles of here at which the cookies are worth buying. Stick to homemades like these which will be on their way tomorrow to folks on the WTC cleanup detail. From a cook's point of view, I made only two alterations: half butter, half shortening and about 3/4 of the bag of chocolate chips. They were perfect with 12 minutes of baking. I'd make these again in a minute! Wonderful recipe!

Good but not perfect. Needs modification. Baking at 12 mins. as suggested by some is good advice. Also needs more salt and think I will use light brown sugar next time because the strong molasses flavor detracts attention from pecans. Will also keep pecans whole or at least roughly chopped and increase amount. Try flattening with fork before baking and the effect of the nuts will be more pronounced.

I used the 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips, decided that didn't look like enough chocolate, and so I cut up 8 ounces of semi-seet chocolate and added that along with about 6 ounces of raisens. They lasted 2 days and I'm making them again now.

Yummy cookies! I halved the salt and I will go a little easy on the sugar next time. I used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 Hersey's chocolate covered carmels. Well, forget the chocolate carmels and stick with the chips. Chill the dough - it does spread out pretty good!

I've been making C.C. cookies about 8 years now and these are truely Fabulous!!!! I've tried many recipies and this one tops them all. I've finally mastered a chewy and crunchy on the outside cookie.
