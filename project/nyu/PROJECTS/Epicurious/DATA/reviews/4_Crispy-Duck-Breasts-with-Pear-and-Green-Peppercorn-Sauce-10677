I made this last night for dinner using 1 Magret duck breast (good for 2 people). First off, the 20 minute cooking time in the hot pan just seemed crazy-long to me! I ended up cooking it my usual way - 6 to 7 minutes fat side down in a hot pan over medium heat, and then another 6-10 minutes in a 400 degree oven meat side down. Let it rest for 5 minutes - perfectly medium-rare and the skin gets nicely crisped. // I used unpasteurized apple cider and Calvados and *did* use the peppercorns, crushed very well with a mortar and pestle. I liked the bite and brininess they added, but only when crushed well...if they remained whole, it was a bit much. Would use cracked mixed peppercorns next time. // Oh - and 1 pear is good for 2 servings - if making this for 4 people, use 2 pears (which I diced instead of slicing as others suggested).

I agree with other reviewers that it needs something extra in the sauce. Specifically, an acid like vinegar. I doubled the sauce, tasted, and couldn't get the balance right without a tablespoon of white wine vinegar. This really improved the overall flaver. My husband thought we should leave out the peppercorns next time, they got picked around and were not worth it. maybe some fresh ground pepper would work just as well. It was o.k., but I wouldn't rave over this recipe. But then I'll try it again with a few changes.

I used veal demiglace and spinach as the side dish. I also added the rice as one reviewer suggested. I l enjoy pairing spinach with duck and it proved to be a big hit with my Valentine. Great recipe!

This was a delicious dish. I very rarely rate things at 4 but this was exemplary. I did make some adjustments. First, since there's only two of us, I only made one split duck breast. Second, I substituted Courvoisier (it was all that was available at my local liquor store) for the Armagnac, and added green beans to the pear mixture. As another cook suggested, instead of dicing the pears I sliced them thinly. And I left the green peppercorns out entirely in favor of fresh ground pink peppercorns and a small amount of black peppercorns as well. Salt was entirely left out and I used a good slug of vegetable broth instead of the bullion cube. The duck turned out beautifully browned and perfectly delicious - I should note that I reduced the cooking time by about 3-4 minutes on the stovetop for it. It was quite easy - honestly, I was expecting company and managed to make a game hen at the same time. The rice sounds like a perfect side but I also imagine that some cornmeal crusted oven-roasted brussel sprouts marinated in sherry vinegar would be a delightful side as well.

This turned out to be a great alternative Thanksgiving dish. I incorporated many of the suggestions above: marinated the duck breasts in red wine and garlic before cooking, left off the peppercorns, sliced the pears instead of dicing them, doubled the sauce, reduced the cooking time, used brandy instead of Calvados, and added a splash of Balsamic vinegar at the end. The sauce came out perfectly. I didn't want it too sweet, and this cut through the richness of the duck perfectly. On the side, wild rice with shallots, garlic, shitake mushrooms and toasted pecans. I'm eating the leftovers as I type!

We loved this recipe! The sauce is really wonderful - subtle and delicate. Next time I wouldn't bother with the green peppercorns. A slug of chicken broth with the apple juice (reduced until thickened) worked very well.

I used Muscovy duck for this recipe and it was delicious. Next time, I might use a bit less thyme than the recipe calls for. Be careful not to overcook; 20 minutes seemed too long so I reduced to 17 minutes on one side. And score the skin to render more fat from the duck breast. Terrific!

Vegetarians, please note: the recipe calls for vegetarian bullion as an alternative ingredient. Hence, a search using the keyword 'vegetarian' will come up with this recipe. Now please quit whining, you babies.

I don't care for duck, but my client was CRAZY about this dish. It was so easy to make, looked lovely and was a hit. I served it with roasted rainbow carrots and baby eggplants.

Wow. This is a really, really good recipe. I've tried it twice, once with D'artagnan magret duck breasts, and once with Long Island type cut from the whole duck, and either way is delicious, though I'd have to give a nod to the magret. The store bought demiglace or bouillion cube isn't really necessary in that you can simply add a cup of homemade duck or brown chicken sauce and cook it down to a couple of tablespoons. Either way, this dish rocks.

Absolutely fabulous. I couldn't find veal or duck stock, so used vegetable stock, which made for a lightly flavored pear gravy. Delicious! Also opted to slice the pear instead of cubing...

Last night was the first time I have ever cooked duck and it turned out great! Mine took 18 minutes on the skin side and just 2 minutes on the other side to be perfect medium rare. The only complaint I have is the big mess it created, oil was splattered everywhere. I saved the duck grease because I'm attempting to make duck confit tomorrow with some duck legs that I bought at the same time. Thanks for the recipe and I will definitely make this again!

Fabulous! I have made this several times, each time my guests rave about how wonderful it is. Nothing is ever left on the plates. I followed the advise of a previous reviewer, soaked the duck in red wine and garlic. Added more real apple juice and used brandy / cognac rather than the expensive liquor. Very simple and easy to make. I use 8oz duck breasts and only cooked 16 minutes + 3 minutes on other side. Perfect!!!

I made this sauce to go with roast duck and it was excellent. Our guests loved it and I will absolutely make this again.

My husband is an avid duck hunter and I have struggled through years of gagging down duck. I went back for seconds after following this recipe. I agree with the shortened cooking time and I would leave out the peppercorns next time. The guests seem to be picking around the peppercorns as well. Overall, a bit hit with our family and friends. The demi-glace seemed to be the necessary ingredient.

Ho-hum. I thought the sauce was uninteresting. I used the cooking times and the breast was medium inside.

This dish was very good! It was the first time I had attempted to cook Duck breasts and it worked out well. I added the Balsamic vinegar and doubled the sauce and both suggestions were on point. The next time I make this, I won't be shy about the pears. The recipe calls for one, but if you like pairs, you could easily throw in two. I used Gran Marnier instead of the Calvados and pear nectar instead of the apple juice and thought it worked well. Oh, I also marinated the duck breasts in Chianti overnight and I think that definitely made for a more flavorful breast. I can't wait to make this one again!

I tested this dish on a couple of very particular palates, the-best-is-only-good-enough types. It received rave reviews. The duck breasts were wonderful gems from Lac Brome in Quebec, Canada. The 20 minutes cooking time was fine on a gas stove. Did add a dash of balsamic vinegar as suggested in one of the other reviews. Can't wait to try the recipe on friends and family. The technique lends itself experimenting with other sauces.

Three of the 10 guests were still raving about it two days after the dinner. There is no question that this is the best duck I have ever prepared and to my memory, the best I have eaten anywhere. Probably equally important, it was very easy to prepare. A difference in available supplies and in personal taste, caused us to modify the recipe slightly. Because we served this buffet style and because the duck went over so well, we used about 6.5 oz/guest as opposed to the approximate 6 oz/guest that the recipe calls for. There was a lot of other food and very little duck was left over. Next time we will probably increase the portions to 7 oz/guest. For our 10 guests we used 5 frozen Muscovy Duck Breasts. Each weigh about .8 lbs and are available at Trader Joes Markets. In the past, we have experienced some toughness with these duck breasts, so this time we marinated the thawed breasts in the refridgerator in a light Chianti generously laced with crushed garlic for 24 hours prior to cooking. I don't know if the garlic added much to the taste, but the finished rare duck was very tender and I credit the Chianti. We pretty much doubled the size of all the ingredients (2 Bose Pears, etc).That gave us a gravy boat full of the pear/green peppercorn sauce. We substituted "Organic Pear Nectar" for the apple juice. We got that at Trader Joe's also. This is composed of pear juice and apple juice. It is sugar free. We substituted Grand Marnier for the Calvados. we could not find Armagnac and at those prices, we opted for something we like -- Grand Marnier. Our 8 to 9 oz duck breasts were much larger than the 6 oz duck breasts called for in the recipe. There was no fat to trim. Forwarned by others about the cooking time we were prepared to turn the breasts prior to the 20 minutes set forth in the recipe. A cooking time of 16 minutes skin side down and 3 minutes skin side up gave us letter perfect medium-rare duck. We sliced these down and served immediately.

this was a good way to cook duck, although 20 minutes was too long. the sauce was just so so. not rich or strong enough for the duck.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely spectacular and delicious. The only thing I changed is the cooking time (yes, 20 minutes is far too long) and I used pear nectar in place of the apple juice. Oh--and I whisked in a tablespoon of butter at the end. This was the main course of a 6-course meal, and it really knocked our socks off.

We thought the sauce tasted a little "flat." The addition of one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar fixed it right up! It was delicious.

We did this for the first time last night and believe me it will not be the last. Who thought of putting pear with green peppercorns!!?. The guy who questioned how to get the duck skin crispy without over cooking the duck may have a point but perhaps his duck breasts were just not thick enough, just a thought. I'm passing this one over to many of our friends.

I've recently been experimenting with cooking duck (to get more experience), and have a general question concerning this recipe. If you cook the four 6 ounce breasts for 20 minutes, I agree you should get crispy skin, but how could you possibly get other than well done meat??

excellent,green peppercorns gave the dish a nice pungency.
