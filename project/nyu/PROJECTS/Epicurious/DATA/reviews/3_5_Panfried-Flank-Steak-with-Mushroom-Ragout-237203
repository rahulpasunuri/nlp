I'm giving 3 forks only because my guys were really happy with this. However I found it quite bland. It was decided that this should be added to the recipe box as a base recipe to which the following changes should be made: Add about twice as many mushrooms focusing on heartier, more flavorful varieties. Add a LOT more garlic, maybe some onion, a bit of red wine and a few dashes of Maggi.

I had mushrooms to use up and my husband said he had a taste for flank steak. Epicurious iPad app to the rescue. When making beef at home I always choose organic grass fed. I was unable to find organic GF flank steak so I substituted with sirloin tip steak which was 1/2" thin - I seared it about 2 minutes per side. Perfectly medium. Maybe it's the season, or that I have it fresh from my garden, but I substituted basil for the rosemary, putting it in at the end and topping with some fresh. Matched beautifully. I used Mammarella Crushed Red Pepper Flakes, available online. Those puppies are HOT. I was coughing while they cooked with the garlic, and even after the tomatoes went in, but man, that heat made the dish. I served over simple mashed potatoes, then the sliced steak topped with the ragout. Yummy. Very hearty and satisfying. This one's a keeper.

Fantastic! So easy to make on a week night and tastes great. Simple ingredients, looks great on the plate. Served with salad and a hard-crusted bread.

So yummy, it didn't make it to the table before I started to devour it.

Easy and delicious - I made one change to the ragout, adding balsamic vinegar and fresh tomatoes, rather than canned tomatoes...it reduced nicely and added a great sweet flavor to the dish. My husband loved it!

I really liked this recipe. However for my family's taste I added extra red pepper because we like things really spicy. Additionally I also used grass fed beef instead of more common grain fed beef. I work with La Cense Beef and they are a great source for 100 percent grass fed beef. For Steak Recipes like this it not only makes a huge difference in taste but also in the nutritional value of the meal as grass fed beef is lower in fat and calories.

This was great! I also deglazed the pan with some red wine and it really seemed to make a difference. I paired it with fingerling potatoes (Roasted Fingerlings with Red and Yellow Pipérade), which made for somewhat of a heavy meal, but I would try it again!

My family and I LOVED this recipe! As someone else mentioned, it took longer to cook the meat than the recipe stated. But it was well worth the wait!! I'm not a big meat eater, but this is so flavorful that it is now one of my favorite dishes. I will definitely be making it again.

This was pretty good. I also used a bit of red wine to deglaze the pan and omitted the sugar. Squeezed some lemon juice in and subbed olives for mushrooms because no one would even try it with them in there. I think the main reason it didn't get three forks is it took MUCH longer to cook than stated (I guess my steak was a bit thicker) and I had to throw it in again with the sauce, which toughened it up. Will definitely try this again.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time, I had no tomatoes and it turned out great. I made it again last night with fire roasted tomatoes and baby bellas, and it was fantastic! I deglazed the pan with red wine before the rest of the sauce ingredients went in (and I forgot the sugar, but we didn't miss it one bit). Served with sliced new potatoes seasoned with olive oil, rosemary and thyme, baked with grated parmesan between the layers. Also sauteed up some chiffonade of collard greens with garlic and salt. Fantastic! Will be making this again for sure!

I just made this for my husband and we loved it. It was super easy to make espically for a weeknite dinner. Next time I will use less salt, but all in all it was great and wouldn't change a thing provided you like hot food.

I made this twice; the first time for my wife and myself. Was incredibly tasty. Made it a second time for friends. They raved on and on. I had the steak run through a tenderizer and pan seared for 3 min per side. I did a red wine reduction and added tomato paste prior to finishing sauce. Delicious.

I loved it - family not so much. I used way less red pepper flakes than called for and it was still pretty spicy. But I'll probably try it again with a variation. Nice alternative to marinated grilled flank steak (a big family favorite)

This was super good and SUPER easy and fast for a weeknight dinner. I used portabello and white mushrooms. This came together so quickly and tasted great. I made it with Broccoli with Toasted Garlic Crumbs and it was a good pairing!

We have always broiled or grilled marinated flank steak. This is a terrific way to cook it fast. I fried it 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other side and it came out perfectly medium rare. Of course, it depends on the thickness of the steak. I do not care for the combination of tomatoes with mushrooms so I did not enjoy the ragout. Next time I will use some chicken broth and some half and half for the sauce maybe with capers/

yikes, was 3/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes a typo? This came out so over-spiced that I couldn't eat it. Definitely has potential, but I'll have to tweak the ingredients

Ragout was especially flavorful, and a very quick way to prepare steak. My steak came out too well-done for my taste, perhaps from spending too much time in the oven.

Excellent flavor and very quick to make. I made a simple romaine/tomato salad with red wine vinaigrette, oven roasted fingerling potatoes, sautéd peas w/herb butter and topped off the meal with berries topped with crème anglaise. My clients were thrilled with the meal.

Four forks because it's very tasty and even easier to prepare. I only added a little more pepper and that's it. It pairs well with a biere de garde like Jenlain or Heavyweight's Biere d'Art (if you can still find it) or Einbecker Ur Bock Dunkel.

Quick and excellent. I had this dihs on the table an hour after walking into the house. Aside from using more salt and pepper than the recipe called for, it came out very well and was a hit with my wife. It's good for low-carb diets, and we'll be going back to this recipe again.

Very flavorful. I am a student and occasionally skimp on fresh spices due to cost, but don't substitute the fresh rosemary -- the flavor is very subtle in the finished dish but really makes it stand out. It might be lost with dried rosemary. Very quick and easy to prepare.

I do not like mushrooms, but I still enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. I would make this dish again.

Rating: 2
Well i think the tomatoes overwhelm the steak.It was ok .But I think I like it with a red wine mushroom sauce I made which enhances the meat instead of hiding the taste.I would use the tomatoe sauce with meatballs or hamburger patties.

Because when you rate a recipe, there's one category asking how you would rate the dish, and another asking would you make it again. I made this with the changes suggested by the first reviewer and it was pretty good.

I'm puzzled as to why it says 100% would make this again, when no one gave it more than 3 forks. I find this happens quite often.

Very tasty, altho I'll admit that we did not pan-fry the flank steak; instead I marinated it in a favorite mustard-red wine marinade and broiled it. The mushroom ragout was more delicious than I'd expected, altho I agree with the first reviewer about the sugar -- I added it as per recipe but it wasn't quite right, so I added a good splash of red wine vinegar and that was great. Served it all over garlic-thyme mashed root vegetables (mmm).

This was a nice change from grilled flank steak especially since it was 15 degrees tonight! used 1/4 teaspoon less of red pepper and it was perfect for our tastes.

Rating: 2
The steak was excellent, and the mushrooms were meaty, but the tomato was unnecessary. I used Glen Muir tomatoes, so I know my dislike isn't based on quality. The tomatoes, unfortunately, tasted canned. Next I make this, I won't add the tomatoes. The steak and mushrooms are perfect together.

This was very good, quick, and easy. My husband is not a big fan of tomatoes so I'm always trying something to change his mind. He really liked this. The sauce would be good for other applications as well.

This is a very solid and quick dish, though it does depend on quality ingredients. Definitely go for shiitake or porcini mushrooms if available, and get a good cut of meat. The sugar in the tomatoes seems the wrong way to go here. Indeed, a splash of wine and/or a touch of lemon juice/vinegar will really give this a brighter flavor and cut more against the oil in the dish. Be careful not to get the pan too hot for this dish. Wisps of smoke and not a cloud will produce a nice crust. And don't cook to more than medium rare if you don't want to be chewing all night. I spooned the tomatoes out of the can and left a good bit of the liquid. This made reducing the sauce quick, but I let it simmer a good while to concentrate the flavors. Easy to experiment with flavoring here (e.g. a touch of minced ginger, smoked paprika, capers, etc.).
