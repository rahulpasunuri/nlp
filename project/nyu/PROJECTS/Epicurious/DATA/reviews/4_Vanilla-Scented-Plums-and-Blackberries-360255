I made it with plums, peaches, and strawberries and served it with mascarpone cream (250gr of mascarpone, 125 ml of heavy cream, 60 ml of sugar). Almost like cheesecake. Delicious.

A perfect summer dessert. I served with both the angel food cake and sorbet. Yummy. I would have liked there to be more vanilla flavour, so will add a couple of drops of vanilla extract next time.

I mixed this in just a few minutes tonight while getting dinner on the table. My daughter was begging for bites while I was mixing in the vanilla bean. Great scent and great flavor - I think I will make this for the next summer cookout we are invited to!
