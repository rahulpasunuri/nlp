I was looking for a refreshing summer recipe, and this one wowed all 6 people dining with me.

This was very nice. There was plenty of syrup left over as others described. I poached for 4 minutes and the apricots were practically falling apart--I'll watch this more closely next time.

Light and tasty dessert - refreshingly aromatic and different. Served with yoghurt rather than creme fraiche to further lighten the fat! I have loads of syrup left over - I'm considering trying it as a sticky marinade/basting sauce for pork!

simple to make, fast, soooo good. because vanilla beans are expensive, i tried it with vanilla powder it was good, but can't beat that vanilla bean .
