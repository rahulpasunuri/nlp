I was making peppermint ice cream and wanted to pair it with something chocolatey and thought brownies would do the trick. These brownies exceeded any and all expectations I had. So deliciously chocolatey, moist and decadent is what they were. As the party I was at was breaking up, a friend leaned over to me and whispered 'I come from a brownie family, these are the best I have ever had.' Win!

These are dangerous. I wish I had made half the recipe because I can't stop eating them, despite the knowledge that they contain 3 sticks of butter. Chewy and delicious!

Rating: 4
Not much to add except that if you are making these for a party, as I did, definitely make them 48 hours in advance. It sounds weird, but the texture becomes far more fudgy and satisfying - and less overtly greasy - with the extra time. Other than, I recommend premium chocolate if you can afford it. I splurged and it was worth it!

These brownies get rave reviews but you really do need to pay attention to the recipe. It isn't forgiving when it comes to glass versus metal pans or uneven ovens, likewise, if you alter the amount of an ingredient, you've changed the recipe. It's not fair to then ding the brownies for your change.

i was a little worried reading the reviews - touch and go. i followed the recipe exactly and the brownies smelled great in the oven. there was a layer of butter bubbling on top which made me a little concerned, but they were perfect once they cooled. after a night in the fridge they were easy to cut and were a BIG success. so rich and fudgey with a nice crust.

These Brownies are very fudge-like. I made them 24 hours before serving and should have followed the advice of others and warmed them in the microwave before serving. They looked like big squares of fudge on the plate. I followed the recipe to a "T" including using unsalted butter and cake flour but they were definitely not the "chewy" Brownies that I like. While certainly edible I don't think the end result really didn't warranted the special and additional ingredient (i.e. cake flour and chocolate PLUS cocoa).

very easy to follow and the brownies came out perfect. They were very rich and chewy. They taste better if left in the fridge for 2 days and microwave for 10 secs before eating. Next time, I would half the sugar amount as they were too sweet for me.

These brownies are the best I've ever made. I used only 2 sticks of butter, and ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate, and they were amazing - very rich even with less butter.

Awesome and simple. I did make a few changes though. I added 8 oz of dried sour cherries that had been macerated in brandy for about 30 minutes. I also added an extra 8 oz of premium 70% chocolate chopped for a decidely wicked and adult treat. I cut them into 1 inch squares as they are very rich.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were the best brownies we have ever eaten. They are reminiscent of Sara Lee Brownies (which are no longer available) without the frosting, very fudgy and melt in your mouth! I refrigerated these overnight and they were a dream to cut the next morning. Then I wraped each brownie individually in plastic wrap, put them in a ziplock freezer bag, and froze them for a dinner party a week later. After the dinner, I placed the unwrapped, frozen brownies on a plate in the microwave for 15 seconds or so, then served them with ice cream and whipped cream (their choice), and a raspberry sauce on the side. Our guests loved them. These brownies are great fresh or after they had been frozen. We had the last frozen ones four weeks later and they were still wonderful. If you like flourless cakes or fudgy not chewy brownies, this recipe is worth trying and keeping!

I thought these were marginal. The sugar seemed gritty in the brownies. They were soft and mushy and not chewy at all. Not my favorite and I would not make them again.

Rating: 2
Well, they smelled great while cooking. But I found the taste to be nothing exceptional - and really not worth the price of the chocolate. I cut the recipe in 2/3 and used a 9x9 pan, followed the instructions exactly but cutting the butter by a few TBSPs due to the other reviewers recommendations. Now, I am a fanatic about chocolate, fudge AND butter, and these really seemed too chocolatey, too fudgy, and too buttery to me! My friend agreed - dense, with a too-thick [almost burnt!] crust, lacking taste: they were unremarkable. I don't think I'd make it again - all that butter and chocolate and for what? Less-than-store-bought-quality brownies?

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and it is ABSOLUTELY FULLPROOF and turned out crispy on top and chewy on inside!!!!! I used Sharffin Berger hard bittersweet choc along with Sharffin Berger cocoa.(expensive at 24.30 per batch - special occasion brownies) I don't understand the problems some people have had. Suggestions: "follow the recipe"!! Use unsalted butter, use metal bowl, use a wire whisk (not electric mixer for a short cut), use a spoon to mix in final ingredients and use a metal pan in which to cook. My guests were into this dessert prior to my serving dinner and I finally had to hide it. Hope this helps

Like some of the other reviews, I had some issues with the texture of the brownies. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I used ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate and organic butter. The only thing I can imagine is that the pan and position in the oven made a difference. I used a glass pan (buttered and floured) and cooked in the middle. It took 45 minutes, but should have probably taken out at 40 minutes. The edges and bottom were hard after cooling and nearly impossible to cut into squares. When i took them out of the oven, it was a brown gooey mess swimming in butter. The butter absorbed into the brownies as it cooled. 3 hours later, they were stuck to the pan and looked unappetizing. Absolutely loved the flavor and richness, but would prefer something that was easier to work with and more attractive - also thought these were too sweet. Wonder if 2 sticks of butter and 1/2 cup or so less sugar would do the trick?

Most fabulous brownies I have ever tasted, like the Ann Sathers brownies except better! I made them exactly as the recipe said and I used Lindt bittersweet chocolate along with Nestle toll house cocoa powder. Simply irresistible. Like other reviewers suggested, WAIT the full 24 hours before serving these. You will be amazed at how different the results will be. Also, use the full amount of UNSALTED butter. You're worth it ;)

This is by far the best brownie recipe. I make this all of the time because my friends and family are disappointed when I don't make them for parties. They are not hard to make and you can even sub all purpose flour and they're fine. I can't imagine anyone not liking these.

Rating: 3
I listened to other reviewers' advice and only used about 1 1/2 sticks of butter. However, the brownies ended up a bit dryer than I expected them to. They turned out more chewey than moist. The Farm of Beverly Hills' famous brownies have more of a thin, crust at the top, but are very moist and fudge-like in the brownie part. I would probably use at least 2 sticks next time. I also added some toasted walnuts since I love that comob. I would recommend making these, but using 2 sticks of butter. They were very tasty when topped off with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

Forgot to mention - I make the recipe exactly as written, let cool for 2 hrs, then wrap tightly and stick in the fridge overnight. Simple to cut the next day into very small squares. Heaven!

I just had to respond to try and counter that last review - this brownie recipe is amazing! I've made it numerous times and people want to die on the spot from happiness when they eat these things! I usually use Plegra butter and a combo of fine chocolates (Valhrona, Lindt, Perugina, Sharfen Berger, etc.). To die for!

Rating: 1
Please do not make this recipe! It is absolutely disgusting and a waste of good chocolate. The brownies were too sweet, had too much chocolate and were definitely not enjoyable. I can't see anyone eating these brownies without following them with a BIG glass of cold water just to get rid of the sickening aftertaste. I'll give it one fork out of four, just 'cause there isn't a ZERO fork option.

Rating: 4
Excellent brownies - I used Plugra butter and I think that helped with the absorbtion in the batter. Still, I'm sure you could cut the amount down to 2 1/2 or just 2 sticks. My batch turned out wonderful, not the fudgiest brownies like everyone else said, but still the best I've ever had. Definitely for the chocolate fan!

These brownies are perfect as long as you cut the butter in half and follow the rest of the recipe as written. You will not miss any of the butter, as following the recipe as is will result in a big oily mess. Trust me, I have been begged for the recipe countless times since.

Rating: 1
I was very disapointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe precisely, but the brownies turned out to be one big, oily glob. I was planning to take them to a picnic, but ended up buying store-bought brownies instead. Maybe I needed to adjust the baking time for my oven or to add more flour. I will not be attempting them to make them again, as the ingredients are too expensive to experiment with.

Perfect brownies! Cutting them into bite sized squared was a bit of a challenge but I put them on a dessert buffet and they were gone in a flash. Nice crust and great chewy center. No need to look for another recipe. Don't be too concerned about the quantity of butter and sugar. It is the correct measurement for the quality and texture of these great brownies. No one says you have to eat the entire batch alone!

I used a glass pan so reduced oven temp to 325. Cut butter to 2 sticks and baked for 44 min. Beautiful fudgy brownies. No refridgerator time required. (added a teaspoon of cinnamon and cup of toasted chopped walnuts) Best I ever made.

Rating: 1
I usually never have the kind of problems that other users seem to have with recipes, until today. I cut the butter from 3 sticks to 2 1/2, just to split the difference. And I baked them 50 minutes, but still the toothpick was coming out gooey. Didn't want to overbake so I took them out. Cooled for 2 hours and chilled for 1 hour. I just cut the middle pieces and I really think these are undercooked. Then again, what's the difference between gooey and undercooked?? Maybe this is what everyone else is calling fudgy and gooey? They are also very stuck to the paper. I used wax paper with crisco and flour. My kids like them, but unless these miraculously get less gooey over night, I don't think I'd make these again. BTW, they are nothing like Duncan Hines.

Overall, I liked this recipe. But next time I will make it with milk chocolate or a sweeter chocolate. I did take the other reviewers advice about the butter.

I took the advice of another cook and I baked the brownies in mini-muffin tins and they came out perfectly! The brownies were for my girlfriend's birthday party, so I spurlged on fancy chocolate from the organic grocery store. The brownies came out very dense and chocolately and everybody loved how they were the perfect bite-sized morsels.

Taking the advice of other reviewers I used only 2 sticks of butter and the brownies came out perfect! Initially, I was worried this was a mistake because the batter was very thick, and the brownies looked a little cake-like when I pulled them from the oven. However, I cut into them, took one bite and realized this was a winner! I used a 12-oz. bag of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips which worked great - delicious brownies! I am sure to make these again!

This is a very hardy recipe. I misread " a tester inserted into center comes out with crumbs adhering" and cooked it nearly 55 minutes trying to get a tester to come out without crumbs. I had to disgard the outer inch (burnt to a crisp) but the rest is still yummy. I used salted butter b/c it's what I had in the pantry and omitted the salt.

Rating: 4
This is my all-time favorite, fail-proof brownie recipe. Rich, decadent, and incredibly chocolately. My only suggestion is to cut back on one whole stick of butter...two works just fine and sometimes the butter doesn't want to incorporate into the batter if you use 3 sticks. The batter isn't that sweet so I add 1 cup of choc. chips. Print this recipe and SAVE it - they've given me a good baking reputation!

These are the only brownies I will make. I have made countless brownies, and none have ever received such rave reviews from *everyone* who has tasted them. I have given them to dozens upon dozens of people and no one has anything but compliments. I don't melt the chocolate over simmering water, though, I melt it carefully on low heat with the butter, stirring all the time. It still comes out wonderfully. They are best, in my opinion, served right out of the refrigerator, so they are more firm but still fudgy. Otherwise, they tend to melt a bit. (Maybe it's because of how I melt the chocolate/butter?) Anyway, I call them Instant Heart Attack brownies, because for the cholesterol-impaired, they are deadly. Enjoy!! *I wanted to add a secret that I have - make them in disposable Reynold's aluminum foil pans (they're like $4 for 2 with lids). They don't affect the baking at all, and because these brownies are really that tough to remove and cut, after refrigerating them, cut them with a sharp knife (wash it in hot water in between cuts for neater edges) and then you can peel out the aluminum foil pan. I serve them in tiny rectangles or squares in cupcake liners so I can put them on a plate where they won't touch one another. I make them every time we have an election (which in this town is every 3 months) and they dissapear in less than an hour, usually.

I made these again for a bake sale yesterday and they were fabulous. A couple notes: I buttered and floured the pan, then added a sheet of parchment that had an overhang on two sides. My chef friend Tony suggested mounding the batter a little higher in the center so it doesn't sink so much in the middle--that worked great. It was done after 35 minutes. I let it cool overnight, then refrigerated it for an hour or so before removing from the pan and cutting. Very easy to cut ( I trimmed the edges). I used Scharffenberger 70% bittersweet and it was just sweet enough, though I'll probably use a 60-something Valrhona next time. The chocolate is really important in this recipe, use the best you can find.

These brownies were delicious, but they weren't really brownies. They were a lot more like fudge.

Great idea for chocoholics! These are very chocolatey and gooey and are wonderful reheated. Be sure you use very good chocolate though, it makes a big difference. Also, if you use the parchment or wax paper to line the pan, make sure you adequately butter and flour that as well -- I had some issues with the paper sticking and it was difficult to get off.

How to review? Yes, these were the most moist, the most chocolate-y, the most fudgey brownies I have ever made. But they were TOO rich. I can't believe I am saying that! But I felt like I was eating a huge truffle (there was NO crumb!), and the buttery film left on my fingers made my stomach turn. I couldn't enjoy them. I think I will stick with Ina Garten's recipe. Incidentally, my husband loved them. So split review in our house.

There's not much more to say--an incomparable brownie. I used Schokinag chocolate, the texture of which was sublime, and Plugra butter for its density. I cheated by melting them in the microwave on the lowest setting, watching carefully, whisking continually, and removing when just melted. I also added vanilla extract. Apart from that, I followed the recipe to the letter. The result was extraordinary. Thanks to all who suggested cutting the next day--I had no crumbling or cracking at all, and everyone agrees this is the best brownie--for adult taste.

I'm an avid baker and had been dying to make these brownies ever since I came upon the recipe. I could tell just by looking at it that they were gonna be amazing. And boy was I right. These brownies are insanely good. I happen to love rich fudgy brownies and that's exactly how they are. I let them cool for about 4 hours and had no problem cutting and removing them from the pan. I suggest either serving them at room temp or heating them up a bit and topping with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge for a decadent and delicious brownie sundae. If you are a brownie fan you should definetely make these brownies, you won't be disappointed.

These were very good and very rich, but not the ultimate brownie I am looking for. They are not a bit cakey as some people said...merely fudgey. If you like fudgey brownies, you will love these. Parchment made them easy to remove from the pan, and chilling made them easy to cut. Used Lindt bittersweet (as I do in all my recipes that call for bittersweet...it's wonderful chocolate), made 1 day ahead, served room temperature.

I tried this recipe because I wanted a simple, unadulterated brownie recipe, and it had gotten rave reviews. Well, I agree with everyone who loved it. The brownies have that perfect consistency that everyone loves about Duncan Hines, (somewhere between fudgy and cakey)except extra special and rich because you use better chocolate. I used Scharfenberger (sp?). For those who had trouble getting them out of the pan, I used parchment paper big enough to extend above the pan, and simply lifted the brownies (uncut) out when they were cool. I wrapped them in plastic wrap overnight and cut them the next day when they were going to be served. These were easy, easy, easy.

Excellent brownies -- very elegant cut into small squares, particularly dusted with powdered sugar. Much easier to handle if you bake them well in advance of serving. My first attempt at this recipe ended in disaster, as I pryed them out of the pan the day after baking and wound up with a bit of a crumbly (though delicious) mess. This time I baked them three days ahead of time and cut the entire pan into one-inch squares just before serving. The brownies that had been cut and then sat for a few more days actually improved with age. Go figure. Be sure to use the best chocolate you can find: I used Ghirardelli semisweet the first time and Valrhona bittersweet the second, and the difference was astounding.

Though I don't like the amount of butter and sugar in these, it is well worth it to make them just to see the looks on people's faces as they take a bite!! I took them somewhere and the comment I heard was, "These are beyond brownies." The texture and strong chocolate flavor are awesome. Plus, there's no nuts to muddle things up. Try em today! This ranks at the top of my brownie recipe list. It really rocks!! UPDATE: The first time I made these (& wrote the review) I used Guittard semisweet chips. The second time, I used Callebaut bittersweet. I definantly like them better with the semisweet. The chocolate flavor seemed more pronounced with the semisweet. Though I didn't change the baking time or temp, this batch seems too well done. It lacks the gooy-ness and the tops and edges are too crunchy.

I have been looking for the right brownie recipe for weeks and when I read everyone's reviews for these brownies I had to make them. They are everything the reviews promised: moist, gooey, very rich, very fudgy, nice crusty top, great texture inside, excellent flavor, but a tiny bit bitter for my taste. I followed the recipe exactly. Definitely let them settle overnight, because they are still hard to cut into perfect squares even the next day (still a little crumbly and moist). I was afraid to add all 3 cups of sugar, it seemed like too much, but you need it for all that bittersweet chocolate and unsweetened cocoa. Next time, I will add chopped walnuts, and use all semi-sweet chocolate instead, I like a sweeter brownie. Overall, best brownie recipe I've ever found!! Make them, it's worth the looks on your friend's and family's faces when they first eat them!

I just made this recipe for the first time, and everybody LOVED it. I couldn't get cake flour, so I wound up substituting regular all-purpose flour, and it worked out really well. I think it may have even prevented some of the crumbling problems other people seemed to have had. I also waited a full day to cut them, which may have helped. They are seriously some of the best brownies I've ever tasted, and SO easy to make. Throw out your old recipe, these set a new standard!

I love the look on people's faces when they first bite in to one of these brownies. They really are just ridiculously fudgy and delicious. On the first day they are pretty much just goo (never heard any complaints about that though) but by the second day they have settled a bit. Maybe it's because I've been baking a little bit more ambitiously lately, but I think these are still a very quick and easy way to make a lot of people very happy.

The recipe name may seem redundant, until you try this dessert. It really is closer to a baked fudge, absolutely incredible. Works fine with all-purpose flour and Ghiardelli chocolate. The edges may be too hard to serve normally (they carmelize a bit), but ice cream softens them or they can be trimmed before serving.

Holy Cow! These were incredibly rich and decadent. Worth every giant hunk of butter, sugar and chocolate (the good stuff makes all the difference so don't skimp). I'd be hard-pressed to find a better brownie recipie.

These brownies are sinfully delicious! Couldn't resist cutting a tiny piece from a corner straight out of the oven. The crunchy crust and fudgy center make up to one great brownie! Didn't have enough cake flour so I substituted with all purpose. Used bittersweet chocolate from Trader Joe's. Added 1 cup of walnuts for texture. My oven is convection so it baked for 35 minutes at 325F. Will try next time with cake flour. Received raves from the family. A must try for die hard chocoholics!

if you added a little more chocolate it would be better. I also think a lot more people would like it. And a little bit more sugar wouldn't hurt.

This was definitely a very chocolaty brownie. It is very dense and did take me a little longer to bake so that the toothpick came out clean. I think that there are good brownies that don't use the bittersweet chocolate (which I don't always have on hand.) These would be good for a special dessert ala mode to break up the fudgy taste a little.

There are lots of brownie recipes out there, but these are truly splendid. They are moist but the tops are slightly chewy with a marvelous texture. I used Callebaut chocolate, and they turned out beautifully.

These are hands down, the best brownies in the world. Everyone who has tried them agrees. I did alter the recipe slightly, substitutingilk chocolate for about 1/3 of the bittersweet called for, and I added about a cup of whole walnuts. Absolutely perfect.

Incredible recipe for REAL brownie lovers. I didn`t have enough chocolate on hand, so I did half a batch in an 8x8 pan. Cooked at 325 degrees for about 40 minutes and they were perfect. My suggestion: Cut them into small pieces -- the 8x8 pan made about 28 -- because this way, those who want just a little taste are satisfied, and you feel indulgent have 3 or 4 small ones, rather than over-indulgent having 1 very big one. This was a huge hit!

I call these orgasmic brownies because every time I eat them I go "ah...ooh"...of my 28 brownie recipes these are the best...worth every calorie

These were some of the richest brownies I have ever tasted...well worth the effort. I have always made my brownies from scratch, and will probably use my standby recipe for most events, but these will be for very special times!

I am a Los Angelenos and presently live in Nigeria, The farm is the first restaurant I run to when I arrive in L.A. every June, my usual order is Ahi three ways and this chocolate brownie. I was thrilled to see the brownie recipe and would love to have the Ponzu sauce recipe used over the Ahi. Now miles away my family and I are thrilled with the brownies. Thanks!

I made these for friends for valentines day. I let them cool and then cut them into heart shapes with cookie cutters. Then I sifted cocoa on top. The day I made them, I thought they were greasy and too rich. The next day, however, they were perfect!

If you are willing to put in the time and effort for from-scratch brownies, these are the way to go. I served them warm with ice cream and cherries. Very decadent.

Good recipe but expensive and time consuming. I actually tweaked the recipe a little. I love cheesecake brownies and so I used the recipe for "three step cheesecake" (which you can get on the back of a box of philly creamcheese) to make a cheesecake filling. I spooned in brownie mixture and cheesecake mixture, alternating in a checkerboard fashion and swirled them together. Made two large pans of brownies. The results were wonderful, but it was certainly a project that took a good portion of the evening. I may just use brownie mix next time.

I'm known for making great desserts, and these didn't let anyone down! Sure, they were more time consuming than opening a box of Duncan HInes, but they were ten times better. I made them for a party, and they were gone by the end of the night. Great recipe!!!

Our family has made these brownies several times. We think they are a real treat. For company, we serve them topped with small scoops of Hagen Daz vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream. A chocolate ganache topping is also great.

Yummy! I made these for Father's Day - what a hit. One person commented that these "actually melt in your mouth." The inside was a little soft. However, I think it's just the fudgy part of the brownie. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet and Ghirardelli cocoa powder. This recipe is a keeper!

I'm not sure what I did wrong when I made them. I think my batch is they only batch which turned out dry, at least according to the other reviews, even though I baked them for only 45 miniutes. I did use regular flour instead of cake flour, which might explain the dryness. Good chocolate flavor though, and I also used chocolate from Trader Joe's. I'll make again, but use cake flour next time.

Thought these brownies tasted good, but were way to mushy, I think you either need to reduce the butter by at least one stick(thats what seemed to make it like that) or bake it for 15 minutes longer like the first review said.

We loved this recipe. I found that it needed to be baked for about another 15-20 minutes.

And I thought I made the quintessential brownie until I made this one! It's my latest best brownie!

This is probably the richest brownie I have ever baked. The only change I would make for my next time is to reduce the sugar by 25%. Also, these brownies are wonderful when they are frozen.

I made this recipe to take to my cousins house. We loved it! It reminded us of my Mothers homemade fudge in it's taste. A little time intensive to make but worth it.

I made these brownies as an "add on dessert" for my mother's birthday party. The family expert on brownies says these are the best he's ever had. I used semi sweet chocolate, will try bittersweet next time.

My husband and I loved the fudgy center and crisp outer edges of this brownie-definitely a keeper! I used my "Pampered Chef" Stoneware pan to bake these brownies and had no problems with cutting these into squares (they were even a little warm). Very rich brownies!

Good brownie recipe--I used semi-sweet chocolate but plan to try the bittersweet next time

A chocoholic's dream brownie. Very fudgy. They cut easier the day after. Because they are very rich, I cut them much smaller and froze them individually wrapped in plastic wrap and then in a plastic freezer bag. My teenage daughter loves them from the freezer. She microwaves them first for 10 seconds just to soften it slightly.

Excellent! The best brownies I've ever made. I've tried the recipe 3 times: 1st time by the book, the other two times I substituted extra cocoa for half of the chocolate (my husband had been nibbling my stores!) -- they were less gooey, but still decadent. I used dutch process cocoa which worked fine. Highly recommended -- big hit at my Superbowl party.

Rating: 1
1) baked them 50 minutes and I still don't think they were done in the middle. 2) when warm, they have a disappointingly cakey texture and aren't fudgy at all. 3) when left covered to cool overnight, they are still nearly impossible to cut at all, and absolutely impossible to cut neatly into small pieces, as the knife keeps getting gooey. 4) more expensive to make and more trouble to cut than Baker's One-Bowl brownies, for about the same taste; at their best, these are just brownies, decent and chocolatey (almost bitterly so). I wouldn't make them again.

Loved these brownies. They are gooey but oh so delicious. I added 1 1/2 t. vanilla just for fun. My guest raved about them and I will make them again.

This is the best brownie recipe ever. The brownies taste like fudge. I'm going to make them for my daughter (a chocohaulic)when she visits. The batter had a grainy sugar consistency, that I was concerened about, but disappeared with baking.

These are "IT"!!! The perfect brownie recipe that has a true "gourmet" flavor and texture!! Truly decadent and it could easily sell on the menu for $4.95 a square or $6.95 with vanilla ice cream and fudge sauce and would be worth every penny!!!!

These were definitely the best brownies I've ever made!!! All of my friends agree, esp. when accompanied with homemade vanilla ice cream! =9

Yep, they are rich. I only had a half cup of cocoa in the house so I added more flour to make up the difference and they turned out great. Also wait untill they completely cool before cutting because they will fall apart if you try and eat them when they are still warm. I felt like they were tastier the next day and everyone loved them at work. I had to cook mine about an hour because the toothpick kept coming out with chocolate on it, so finally after an hour I took them out despite what the toothpick had on it and they were ok. I think they are really meant to be "fudgy".

These brownies are absolutely great but you really, really have to love chocolate! I thought that they were wonderful but after a few tastes the rest of my family said "too much". I guess that just means more for me the next time that I make them.

These brownies are out of this world. I've ditched the local bakery's brownies - and I thought those were the best. I'm sticking to making my own with this recipe! My husband flipped!

These are very rich and fudgey and delicious IF you use high-quality cooking chocolate when making them. They are as good as the chocolate you use. They are sticky so serve them in silver mini-muffin or candy papers if you are going to use them on a dessrte tray. I thought they were best cut into small, bite-size pieces.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I inadvertently baked them on the lower rack of the oven. While they were not "fudgy", they certainly were not overly cooked. However, my husband, a best friend who loves chocolate, and I felt they were too intensely chocolate. The second time I used 6 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate and 6 oz. of milk chocolate and baked them on the middle shelf of the oven. More fudgy and, in our opinion, a much better flavor.

I agree with bot of the previous reviewers. THer are just brownies, but at the same time they are awesome. They have a lot more butter and chocolate that regular brownies, which makes them soooo fugey. I feel like I am eating raw brownie dough. IT's the reactions that made me give these four forks. I have made this recipe four times. Each time people have flipped over them. Use this recipe when you want something special but don't have the time to make a cake. I served them with ice cream and fudge sauce and they were a huge hit.
