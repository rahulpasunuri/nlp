Speck is a ham product that is cured, cold smoked and then air dried--similar to prosciutto--from the Tyrol area which is northern Italy and southern Austria.

I, as well, have eaten my share of rosti when visiting Switzerland, and this dish is delicious! Of course it is rich as butter and cheese are rich, and has loads of flavor if one seasons it generously with loads of pepper and a good amount of salt. We will be making this dish again, but since there are only two of us, I will half the ingredients and use an 8" skillet. Can't wait!

Terrible, just terrible! It was all I could do not to spit it out when I tried the finished product. I have had my fair share of rosti, and this is a pathetic imitation. The texture is chewy and the flavor utterly absent.

Put this on top of your head and watch your tongue beat your brains out trying to get to it.

The cheaters version of this recipe can be made by buying the potato patties you find in the freezer at Albertson's, frying them in butter, adding a slice of canadian bacon and some cheese then topping the whole thing off with a fried egg. Believe it or not, we've even tried hollandaise sauce on it. It's not bad.

I've been making something similar for years. I usually add the eggs right to the potatoes (make a small hole and just put the egg into it - cover and poach. But .... The recipe as written has a whole days worth of fat for 4 people. Just be aware.

If you top the Roesti after flipping, with a slice of ham, then the cheese, and then the egg, it makes what is known as "Farmer's Roesti" and will make a bulldog break his chain.

love the recipe.I lived in Switzerland for over 12 years. This was a staple for the winter. Rosti mit speigelei always a hit. However,until now I never had measurements.This worked perfectly. It will now be permanently saved in my recipe box!

When I lived outside of Chicago, we used to drive 4 hours to New Glarus Wisconsin on a Sunday afternoon just to go the Glarner Stube for their Sauerbraten with a side of Rosti & steam vegetables. I've never tasted anything like what they made until I came across THIS recipe. If I close my eyes when I'm eating this, I can almost hear the Swiss cow bells!!
