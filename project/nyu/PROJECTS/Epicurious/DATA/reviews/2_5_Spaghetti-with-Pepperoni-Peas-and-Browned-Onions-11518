this was a pretty decent weeknight pasta dinner. i had been looking for a way to get rid of leftover pepperoni from pizza. i used red onion and chicken broth instead of the pasta water (because i forgot to save some before draining). my boyfriend loved it.

This was a little dry, but the flavors were good, and it was so easy to make that I can't really fault it. A good, quick weeknight supper.

When I was in highschool, a teacher of Italian heritage from Hamburg, NY, taught me to make "peas and macaroni"-which looks very much like this recipe, except for two important things: First, in his, you need to add a large can of tomato puree, and you must use canned peas, with the juice from the can. We always used LeSueur brand baby peas. It is delicious this way, and I have made it as comfort food since 1972 when I learned it.

The combination of flavours worked well but the finished product was still a bit dry. We moistened the pasta with a little olive oil.Nonetheless there were no leftovers!

This recipe was fast and easy to prepare and had great flavor. I used a 6-oz package of sliced pepperoni distributed by our local grocery store labeled "Tangy with a Hint of Red Pepper" and cut the slices into pieces with scizzors. I'll make this again soon.
