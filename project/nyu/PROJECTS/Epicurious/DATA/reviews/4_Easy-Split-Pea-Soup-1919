I've made this many times, and it's always great! Like others, I use 2c of split peas, and I probably double the amount of carrots and celery. Wanting to cut down on the fat from the ham hocks, I just recently used two big smoked turkey legs, and my lady and I think it may have turned out even better! There was a bit more meat, and it was a easier to work with than the ham hocks.

I like split pea soup and was intrigued with the idea of using marjoram. I made the recipe as is, and was disappointed. Not a lot of flavor; I think using stock rather than water might have helped, and using bacon rather than smoked ham hocks would have been a lot easier and contributed better flavor.

Basic! I use proscuitto ends (free from my deli), add a parmesan rind, mess with the spices (wife likes cumin and more garlic..), sherry's good.Bon Appetit!

An easy recipe, made even easier! I made this after Christmas with our leftover Honeybaked ham, and it was terrific, but since we're trying to eat less meat, I decided to make it again without. Of course, with my kids circling the dinner table, I forgot that this needs to simmer for over an hour! So I hustled to get everything in the pot, and then prayed for a miracle. Much to my delight, it was perfect after 45 min.! I used 3 bay leaves instead of the majoram, no pork at all, 4 c. veg broth + 4 c. water for the liquid, and zapped with my immersion blender in the pot. My only note would be to *generously* season your veggies before adding your peas and liquid, and again at the end, since you lose a bit of flavoring without the pork. Also, last time I followed reviewers' advice to increase the peas to 2 c., but after a few days, I found the leftover soup too thick. So this time I went with the 1.5 c. of peas as written, and it was perfect. This soup is awesome, even without the meat! Oh, and it goes GREAT with the Irish Soda Bread with Raisins & Caraway Seeds from this site. Made that with my 3 & 6 year-old and it was a home run.

Like many I changed more than a few ingredients, but it was still delicious. Added garlic, had no celery, used leeks, used half chicken broth, half water and used French lentils instead of split peas. Followed one reviewer's suggestion to add frozen green peas at the end to brighten the colour. Used the immersion blender right in the pot, then added the chopped meat from 2 ham hocks. A recipe that can take a lot of abuse. Its a keeper.

Easy is right! Had a leftover hambone from Xmas party for the base. I used 2 lbs of dried split peas and 10 cups of liquid--6 broth, 3 water and 1 white wine. Used both marjoram and bay leaves. Also, used a stick blender in the pot. Had to add more liquid, was so thick. This was a tasty and hearty soup to cap off a day in the sleet waiting for the new puppy to pee. Warmed us all.

Rating: 4
I took all y'alls advice and added garlic, bay leaves, and salt and pepper. It still needed something, so I did what my mother taught me-- add some sherry. That really helped a lot. Finally, I gave it a light dusting of cracked red pepper and woo hoo. I used ham hocks for the first hour or so, then removed the ham hocks and mixed everything and finally added some ham chunks (and one more splash of sherry).

Rating: 4
The base recipe is excellent. I made a few minor tweaks and it turned out very well: -- I hit the soup with an immersion blender for about a minute instead of transferring some to a blender; and -- I added 1.5 cups of frozen peas after it was blended to bring the texture back up and brighten the colour.

Great basic recipe. I used 8oz ham steak, vegetable stock (all I had on hand) and added 2 bay leaves, 2 large cloves of garlic and maybe 3/4 t hot curry powder. Tastes fantastic! I really enjoy the addition of curry powder. Try it! I probably used 2.5 c split peas and 6.5c liquid (4c stock).

Loved this recipe. Dried bean and dried pea soups are usually a little bland for my taste so I added 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of curry power, and freshly ground pepper to taste. I really liked the addition of the curry powder. Like other reviewers I used only 6 cups of liquid and I used chicken stock.

I added 3 large garlic cloves, 1 sm/med bay leaf, chicken bouillion and the extra 1/2 cup of peas (2 total). I cut my vegetables very small so there was no need to puree the soup when it was done. I used the bone from our New Year's Honeybaked Ham and it was divine!

Added 3 bay leaves and 3 cloves of garlic, used a leftover ham bone instead of hocks. I used some Toor Dal (yellow split peas) I already had instead of green split peas. Ended up cooking the soup all day to get the dal to soften, but it was worth it - the flavor was incredible!

I loved this recipe! Like others, I used a ham bone from a honey baked ham. I didn't have celery, so I just added a bit more carrot. I also used 3 bay leaves instead of marjoram and olive oil instead of butter. I used an emersion blender to mix. SO EASY!!! As others noted, I initially found that the soup was a little thinner than previous split pea soups I made. I used the amount of split peas and water indicated in the recipe. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised that the consistency was MUCH better the next day. It was smooth and silky, not watery or too thick--perfect! I'd recommend making it a day ahead to allow it to firm up a bit. I'll definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe! I was a little wary before making this because it is looked very easy. However I am glad that I decided to try it out. The changes that I made are as follows: I added about an extra 1/2 a cup of carrots and celery to the original amount because I like chunkier soup and therefore increased the unsalted butter by 1 tablespoon; I did not use pork hocks but instead got about a pound of a half of ham that I sauteed with butter and brown sugar while the soup was cooking, I added it towards the end and there still was a distinct flavor in the soup itself from the meat; and lastly I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water to give the flavor more body. It was amazing for such a simple recipe to have so much complexity, I will definitely be making this again.

Rating: 4
Extremely easy! Followed advice of other reviewers and cut the water down to 6 cups with one cube of chicken stock and puree half the the soup (wanted it a tiny bit chunky). The soup was a perfect consistency. I served it with homemade sourdough rye bread. Very filling meal. So delicious. Everyone absolutely loved it and I plan on making this again, as it was a huge hit!

Rating: 4
I made this with just a few changes/additions and it was amazing! I added several parsnips while sauteing the other vegetables, added three chicken bouillon cubes to the water, used a whole bag of split peas (16 oz.) and (as other reviewers), put in the bone leftover from a spiral sliced ham that had some ham left on it, instead of using ham hocks. After cooking it and removing the bones, I blended it, then added back in the cut up bits of ham. It was the best split pea soup I have ever tasted!

Rating: 4
Recently, early in the morning during a busy week, I popped all the ingredients into my slow cooker without sauteeing the vegetables. (I use water, not stock, because I find it too salty otherwise, especially when using meaty pork hocks.) Six hours later, I discovered that, in my early morning fog, I had put in lentils instead of split peas. I didn't process it and we ate it as it was. Delicious! And even better days later when split pea soup would have started to become too mushy and would have needed thinning. I will definitely make this "mistake" again.

Usually I watch what goes in and how it works, or doesn't work, with the recipe. Ham hocks are kinda gross so I sub either ham itself after a little caramelizing or good old bacon. To finish I'll add cream, a couple Tbs at a time. (This also helps if you find it on the thin side.) My clients love this soup and sometimes we change it up with some yellow split peas.

Rating: 3
I didn't have marjoram, so used bay leaf (3), parsley and thyme. I read all the reviews saying that it came out too watery, but didn't listen to them...unfortunately. I only used 1 lb of split peas, and the soup came out too watery... So I cooked the other 1/2 package (another lb) and then added it into the soup. Added a little more salt and it came out excellent! My suggestion would be to dump the whole bag of split peas in it (2 lb bag).

Rating: 3
Great flavor with smoked ham shanks. I thought there was too much water for the peas. I put in over 2 cups of peas and it was a bit thin for my liking. Next time will do the full bag (2+ cups) of peas with 6-cups water. Wife was scared of it, but after tasting, loved it.

Per prior reviewers, used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water, increased carrots and celery, added chopped garlic ( i used 2 cloves), added about 1c chopped leek - white part only,added thyme and bay leaf . Results were outstanding! I used the bones/meat from a Costco spiral ham. I thought it was thin at first but after pureeing about 5 cups, it was perfect. I used quite a bit of pepper because I like it but was careful wih the salt. My family members who claim to "hate" pea soup ate this with gusto.

Rating: 2
Not sure what went wrong here. 8 cups of liquid was way too much, the soup was thin. 1-1/2 lbs of smoke ham hocks was also way too much, it totally overpowered the soup. I added a TBL of sherry to cut the ham flavor a bit. In theory, this is a great recipe. In my translation, not so much. I didn't change the recipe at all, but will if I make again.

Absolutely delicious. I used the ham bone from a sweet, wonderful baked ham we served at our holiday party and added some cut up leftover ham after blending the soup. Kosher salt to taste. My husband and I ate this for dinner with rosemary bread on a cold, rainy evening, so filling, so tasty.

I'm still working on this recipe but have a few thoughts. I added chicken broth too and a Parmesan rind. In addition, I added white pepper and will also probably add cayenne for a bit of a kick. I used a smoked ham shank instead of a ham hock (agree that there's too much fat and not enough meat). I added 2 bay leafs too and expect this to be yummy! I don't think I'll puree it though b/c I like it chunky.

I liked this. I followed the recipe exactly. It's my first encounter with homemade pea soup. I've always hated pea soup but was surprised to find I actually liked this. My 2 fork rating is because I thought it was "good". I think I will make it again, although I may experiment with other recipes before "marrying' this one. BTW, I was shocked to actually find pork hocks in my Massachusetts' grocery store in the white suburbs. This is my first encounter with pork hocks. I was even more surprised to find so little meat on the bone. (Was I supposed to remove the skin? I did.) My husband has just gone back to the pot to "reload" -- I think I'll follow.

my supermarket didn't have pork hocks, nor could i get marjoram (hard to find where i am in s america) but the beauty of this recipe is that you can replace the pork with ham, the marjoram with other spices and it is still v tasty. and people adore it. pureeing is not absolutely necessary if you cook long enough, the texture is nice

Made this twice now. First time was best. Used bay leaf in first batch. Used more than recommended amount of all veggies in both batches. Used entire bag of dried peas both times. Two large ham hocks produce better results than one. Added ham steak for meat in the soup - discarded ham hocks both times. Hard enough getting husband to eat soup 'flavored' with hocks.... All in all we love this soup and it gets eagerly eaten up. Great simple, quick, easy yummy recipe! I think the secret is the Marjoram!

Rating: 4
Tastes like my mum's split pea soup! I followed the recipe religiously except I subbed 2 bay leaves for the marjoram, as that was all I had on hand. Also, I skipped the puree bit, as my husband prefers it a bit chunky. This will be my staple pea soup recipe.

I am a seasoned, gourmet cook. And/despite decades of gathering/experimenting with recipes, this is my go-to recipe for split pea soup. As a recipe it reads so simple, but the flavor is spot on! I added boxed, organic chicken broth. Also, instead of the pork hocks, I dice lean leftover ham from the holidays.

This is the pea soup recipe I will make every time. I used a half of a hamsteak because it keeps in the freezer and I think it is so much less greasy and fatty. I defrosted what I needed then kinda shredded it. Everything else was by the book. I told my husband I was making pea soup today, he curled his lip. After he had a serving, he said how good it was. This is a delicious and easy recipe.

This is good, basic comfort split pea soup. Blending it is essential in my opinion. I did not have ham hocks so I cooked 12 oz. bacon to crisp. I then used 2T bacon drippings in place of butter to saute veggies. Cook the soup completely and THEN add in the crisped, crumbled bacon at the end.

12/31/09 What I was/am trying to find is a good, basic yellow split pea soup recipe which my Mother used to make, who has been long deceased. In her recipe, her ingredients were: butter, onion, celery, left-over ham w/bone-in, yellow split peas, AND 10 whole cloves, 5-7 whole, black pepper corns, and either 2 small bay leaves, OR 1 large bay leaf. Once all cooked together, and, at the "straining" part of the recipe (all would be strained, naturally), all of these "secret ingredients," would be removed! These 3 "secret" ingredients, for our family and our friends, was/is totally, absolutely sensational!! My Mother and Grandmother were THE BEST COOKS EVER!!!! So, I would use the basics from this recipe as I need them to get the proportions correct between # of lbs of beans, to # of lbs of ham hock/bone-in left-over ham, to amounts of onion, and celery, and, of course the correct amount of WATER to ALL of this! Also the correct cooking procedures, and the cooking times!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used dry split peas...I was assuming that's what they meant by green split peas, however, they were not cooked after the hour of suggested cooking time. I think I cooked it for about 2 hours. I also used 4 cups of chicken broth as suggested by previous reviewers. I also used a ham bone with big chunks of ham attached from Christmas Eve Dinner. I then threw the whole pot in the frige to "marry" overnite. I then re-heated, cut off the ham in small chunks and here's my special secret. I peeled and cooked a large potato till soft. I mashed the potato and put it in the soup. The peas were very cooked and I didn't even have to blend the soup. I like the chunks of carrots, celery and onions. But if you prefer a smoother soup, blend away. I do the same potato trick for bean soup, but in the bean soup I also throw is a "slosh" of apple cider vinegar..yum yum. P.S. My hubby who hates "regular" pea soup had seconds!

This was a perfect and simple split pea soup recipe. I didn't have the ham hock, just several thick slices that I chopped up and threw in. I also did not puree as I like my split pea with a bit extra texture. And like many reviewers, I used 4 cups chicken broth in place of 1/2 of the water.

What a simple preparation for such great results. I've tried four different split pea soup recipes with varied degrees of complexity (i.e., make ham hock stock separately, puree half of peas) but this recipe makes the most delicious velvety soup. I did do 4 cups chicken stock & 4 cups water for extra layered flavors. My kids LOVED it. Now a added to the tried and true recipe collection.

This was excellent, even though I had pre-diced ham instead of the pork hocks, and didn't have celery on hand. I sweated the onions and carrots the night before and stuck them in the fridge overnight. Tonight I just added the rest of the ingredients (substituted 10 cups of chicken broth + 2 cups of water for the 8 cups water- I thought it needed much more liquid than it called for, as it kept getting pasty and thick before the peas were done).I also had some leftover country potatoes that I chopped up and added, so that could account for the pastiness, but it turned out great in the end. My husband loved it! Will definitely make again and again.

This recipe is exceptional: exceptionally easy and exceptionally good. I upped the split peas to a pound, used mostly chicken stock instead of water, and had my butcher cut my hock so that the marrow would flavor the soup more effectively. I didn't bother blending it. Peas and veggies were well incorporated after about an hour and 20 or 30 minutes. Turned out delicious, flavorful, comforting. Definite keeper and a great, cheap week night meal.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written, didnt subsitute anything and cooked it for 1 hr 10 min and it came out absolutely perfect and delicious! I know some reviews suggested longer cooking time but Im not sure why, the flavor of the pork was perfect, the consistency just right. I think keeing the lid on half way during cooking is key!Just enough to evaporate some liquid but not all and yet keep most of the heat in to meld the flavors together. I give this recipe an A+!

Rating: 0
I'm sure other cooks made this variation, as I had a few thick slices of bacon, and the end of the slab. I cooked the bacon, adjusted the bacon drippings to the proper amount, then cooked the vegetables in the drippings. I also used about 2/3rds chicken stock, 1/3rd water. The unblended soup has a nicer color than the blended soup.

I originally found this recipe in 2005 while flipping through a mag at my Dr's office. I ripped the recipe out and proceeded to make it. It is the best recipe for split pea soup, Ever!!! I moved and lost the recipe. For 2 years I have been looking for this specific recipe, to no avail. I have made other split pea recipes, but they were not quite as good as this one. I had a craving for split pea soup and decided to look one last time for the first recipe I made. And I have found it!!!!!

Hello, all of you cooks who substituted things without bones, especially feet, lower legs, or with marrow are missing out on what gelatin adds to this soup. After some thought, I find it hard to describe what the hocks add to this recipe - but it is an important ingredient - just as the flavors of Marjoram are. I do not have any fresh marjoram and am looking for substitutes in the garden. To the vegetarian or vegan I submit you not only need to add a flavorful ingredient to replace the pork, but, or, and, a coagulating one. Try heavily grilled pineapple dusted with a good quality pimenton - not burnt but with good grill marks for the flavor and agar-agar for the coagulation for lack of a better word. I agree with all of those reviewers that said this needs more time on the stove - I am at 2 hours and still going strong. ps. I added parsnips for their sweetness.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I used 8 bouillon cubes with the water (6 would have been better) and used the whole pound of peas as suggested by others. I didn't have marjoram but put in a little thyme and a couple of bay leaves. I used ham left over from a spiral sliced ham instead of a ham hock (I've never bought a ham hock). I also cooked for about 2 hrs. Needed a little more water at the end (because of so many peas). A speck salty but I love salt so it was okay. Also had crusty bread and it was divine. Yum o rama!

Rating: 4
This is exactly how split pea soup should taste! I make this every time I have leftover ham. You can do it with a hock or with slices from a boneless ham, and either way works well. I agree with other reviews--I cook the soup for way longer than what the recipe says, 2+ hours.

My husband was skeptical about using our leftover Easter Ham for this recipe. I think all he ever had was canned split pea soup and the bad rap this soups gets from the movie 'The Exercist'. (split pea soup was used to make the vomit for the possessed girl). This was excellent. I used a smaller amount of ground marjoram since this is what I had on hand, added a bay leaf and also a little bit of dried tarragon. When it was finished, I added a little fresh parsley and dill. This was so easy to make and yummy! This is a keeper for next Easter!

I omitted the carrots (none on hand) and cooked for much longer than the recommended time. After pureeing, it was too thin for my liking so I cooked it down. I would do the same next time or add more peas. Made for St. Patrick's Day first course and it was a hit.

Whether it be in art or in life, "simplify" is always a good path to follow. This "easy" split pea soup is as good or better than any I have ever eaten or made. I would agree with one of the other reviewers, however, that the 1 hour 10 minute simmering time is not enough to get the maximun flavor and consistency from the ham hocks. I would suggest at least an hour and a half and preferrably 2 hours. Also a little thyme, used sparingly, would not be a bad idea. Otherwise, keep it simple and easy!

After the great reviews I was disappointed. Here are the changes I would make. The ham hocks needed more time to get tender enough to break up into the soup. I would cook them first in water to create a broth. Then the soup can be layered by adding the sauteed vegetables and the split peas.

This is a great easy recipe. We followed the recipe exactly except that we also added a bit of thyme. Next time, we plan to use the entire bag of split peas so that the soup is heartier -- it was slightly watery for our taste.

I add one peeled and cubed russet potato when I add the bacon and peas and finally, I puree with a stick blender. It's outstanding. Let me also say that I never use marjoram much, but it gives the soup that quintessential "split pea soup" flavor. Great recipe!!!

I used this basic recipe as inspiration and here's what I did: Sweated in olive oil: 1 diced onion, 2 diced carrots, 2 diced celery stalks, 1 diced parsnip, 3 diced garlic cloves. Threw in 1 bag (1 pound) split peas, 8 cups water, one big ham bone, 2 bay leaves, a box of frozen peas, 3/4 tspn Penzey's ham base, and some dried thyme. Simmered it for a good 45 mins, removed bone and bay leaves. Immersion blender ground up about half. Add back diced ham from bone and black pepper. Absolutely delicious the next day.

I followed this recipe *almost* exactly - I subbed dried thyme leaves for the marjoram since it turns out, I had none of the latter. Soup came out lovely - perfect for a chilly fall day. I'd definitely make this again. The hardest part was getting all of the meat off the ham hock - but it was well worth it.

MY first time making this and it was amazing! I used 1 cube of vegetable broth instead of the meat, and subbed one leek for the celery. I also added a turnip. I ended up blending half of the soup so it was creamy but not watery. Tastes great with crusty bread!

With some doctoring, this tastes just like my mom's from childhood. I eliminated the marjarom and celery. I also did not add any salt. I added a whole bag of split peas which is about twice as much as the receipe calls for, 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth instead of 4 of the cups of water, 2 bay leaves, fresh garlic, fresh ground black pepper and thyme. I also found smoked ham from a ham hock that did not have bones and looked leaner than a ham hock. I did not puree the soup because I like it with lots of heartiness. I cut the butter in half and next time I would consider using olive oil instead of butter.

Ok, I realize that I totally cheated in this recipe, but I was thwarted by my local grocer who had no ham hocks or smoked turkey legs or anything that others suggested.

This recipe came out DELICIOUS! I am so proud, the taste was perfect. I followed the instructions of the other reviewers and added a little crushed red pepper, white/black pepper, leeks, green onions, cayenne, bay leaves. I also used smoked turkey. Very good, will try again.

I made a number of changes and LOVED it - replaced carrots w/ parsnips, left out celery, used ham w/ bone, replaced half of water w/ vegetable stock. played around w/ the spices-left out marjoram but added white and black pepper, thyme, bay leaves, cayanne, and a dash of paprika. yum.

I agree with most of the others. A great BASE for a fantastic split pea soup, but it needs more seasoning. I added a leek and some chopped garlic to the veggies and some parsley and a dash of crushed red pepper. I also used about 1/3 chicken stock.

I come from a long line of pea soup lovers. They all thought this was the best. I used an entire package of split peas. It wasn't too thick or too thin.

Really delicious!Very easy and a big hit with the whole family. Be careful when seasoning as the ham is very salty to begin with.

Loved it. Very easy and simple. I used a pound of split peas, 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water. My guests loved it, too. Definitely a recipe I'll keep.

I've used a similar recipe for years, using leftover ham hock along with all the veggies and peas. I also include the meat that falls off the bone in the puree. Then I add finely diced ham back into the soup before serving it. Friends and family all love it!

to Helenwl from Vancouver I had the same problem as you did. I went from slight simmer to "simmer/boil" until it thickened and it turned out great! good luck I hope this works for you.

Honestly - I'm looking at all the fabulous ratings for this soup, then looking back at the recipe to see where I went wrong, but no I can't see anything. 8 cups of liquid to 1 1/2 cups of split peas makes for a watery bland mess. I even ended up sifting the peas/carrots/onions/celery out to put in the blender with about a quarter of the liquid then poured the rest away which was quite a waste of some really good stock. I then had to season the heck out of it to produce a passable taste. I was imagining a lovely thick smokey split pea soup, and this wasn't even close. I will give it another go, just so as not to be defeated but will halve the liquid and double the split peas next time.

Excellent. I used four bacon strips in place of the ham hocks and then just took them out at the end. It was a fantastic soup to eat on a cold winter night.

Rating: 4
I have been making this for years. My family just loves it. I usually add some garlic with the veggies, and a teaspoon or so of thyme while cooking. I also use bay leaves and a mix of water and chicken stock. For serving I set out little bowls of chopped green onions, crispy fried bacon, grated cheddar cheese and sour cream. I let everyone add a little of what they want to their soup and it makes a very nice dinner indeed!

This is an incredibly easy and delicious recipe! I use a thick piece of smoked turkey instead of the pork hock, and it is still wonderful and a little healthier. Otherwise I sollow it as written. It has become a weekly dinner in our home.

Rating: 4
I abslutely love this recipe and have made many times. It's fabulous that you can make it without soaking the beans overnight. This recipe is also easy to modify when needed. I used a great big left over Easter ham and bone last night rather than pork hocks. It increases the ham to soup ratio. Whenever I make it I add fresh cracked black pepper and a little bit a sherry. Marvelous, quick, easy, soul satisfying comfort food.

I used two pieces of pork tenderloin instad of ham hocks. I tossed them in when it said to toss in the hocks and fried them up for a minute, then boiled them with the soup. After the soup was cooked, I took them out, cut them up, and tossed them back in with the blended soup. I didn't find it quite salty enough, so I sprinkled in some powdered chicken stock to give it a bit more flavor, probably about 1/4 c. Much nicer. Let's see what my honey thinks of it!

Rating: 4
This was an amazingly easy and flavorful soup to make. I doubled the recipe and still had to make it again three days later! Family and friends (some of whom are very picky eaters) loved it. It is now one of my "staples" and even quick enough to do on a week night after working!

Rating: 4
This was wonderful and easy to make. I too did not use pork hocks, but the ham bone from our Christmas ham. Gave it much more meat. I substituted the marjoram for 2 bay leaves and used half/half chicken broth and water. Delicious!

Delicious soup for a cold day eaten by a roaring fireplace.

this was better than my mother's and is my go-to split pea soup recipe. for you vegetarians: add a chipotle pepper (or two if you like things really spicy). the adobo sauce and the pepper compensate nicely for the missing smokiness of the ham without having to add synthetic smoke flavoring

Rating: 4
I love this recipte and make it often in during cold Michigan winters. I up the veggies, use bay leaves instead of marjoram, and add a few whole cloves during the simmering part. I also like to throw in some extra sausage at the end.

Rating: 3
Since I'm a lifelong vegetarian, I made a few changes and the result was fantastic. Took other reader suggestions and added dried mushrooms with the water, substituted garlic and bay leaves for the marjoram, and used some veggie broth. I pulled out the mushrooms and bay leaves before pureeing. Finally, I added about 4 drops of liquid smoke to make up for the smoky meat taste missing. It was super-super-delicious.

I have been making soup for almost a year now and it always turns out nicely. Since we don't eat red meat, I have made it with smoked turkey once and rest of the time without any meat. When I use no meat, I add dried shiitake mushrooms when you add water for extra flavor and 2 Tbs miso at the end before you salt and pepper to bring out the smoky flavor. I also often add sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter in the end. Another nice addition is a sprinkle of croutons (toss cubed old french bread with olive oil and dried herb of your choice and pop them into the oven for 10 min at 400F).

Rating: 4
I can't help tinkering. It was late and I did not have the time to simmer. After cooking as directed and adding all ingredients, I put them in my pressure cooker for 5 minutes (let out steam). Then added 2 or 3 jiggers of dry sherry, juice from 1/2 lemon, kosher salt, pepper and additional chicken stock to taste and consistency .Ham hocks had not fallen apart so I added diced ham at the end as I brought to heat before serving.The bacon sprinkles on the top were a great touch. Everyone came back for seconds!

Rating: 3
Comfort food deluxe. I always add a bay leaf and some parsley (makes it greener). The marjoram isn't necessary, nor is the celery (I don't like it either). Tip on the "meat" issue: I prefer smoked turkey leg or wing because it's leaner and some guests won't eat pork. Either way, I boil the smoked meat on the bone separately, cut the meat off & save it, and save a cup or so of the broth (if there is time, I chill it so the fat can be removed). THEN I make the soup with the bones, reserved broth, water, and (if I have any) some fat-free low-sodium chicken broth. Fish the bones and bay leaf out, and then puree, mash or not. Add meat and simmer on very low until the meat is hot. This cuts the fat and the salt. Thinly sliced spicy smoked sausage added at the end with the meat sounds good -- I'll try it next time.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent soup that is easy to make. I was planning on adding some cream and half and half but it didn't need it. I used half the onion instead of a whole onion. I also used half water and half chicken broth. I only added a few pieces - maybe 1/3 cup - of diced meat. The smoked meat flavor comes through nicely in the soup so I didn't want to over-do it with the meat. Hearty and delicious with some good bread and a tossed salad.

Rating: 4
On the pork hock issue- get a ham bone instead. They have much more meat on them. Ask at the Honeybaked Ham store. They sometimes have them. Very meaty.

Rating: 3
To the cook from OC: I am telling you - My husband wont eat pork at all so I use smoked turkey legs! Most grocery stores should have them and they usually come two to a package. (Almost always near the ground turkey section) The smoked flavor is wonderful and you can use the meat! I toss the legs into the soup and let it simmer for 1 1/2 hours - I remove the legs and place them on a cookie sheet and use a fork to just pull the meat from the bone and then toss it back in. Anyone who has tasted my soup raves. This is a GREAT recipe!

Rating: 3
Could someone help me understand a pork hock (aka a "ham hock")? The smoked pork hock that I bought seemed like a fatty gristly glob even after 1-1/2 hours of simmering -- yuck. I can't even imagine wanting to cut it up and put any part of it in the soup. Once I got rid of it and added more seasonings the soup was delicious. I'd love some guidance here... Thanks.

This is almost exactly like my Mom's split pea soup (so I can't rate it a dish beyond compare). But it brought back memories. Used a smoked, cured ham shank and potatoes instead of celery (can't stand celery in soup), 5 cloves of minced garlic, freshly ground black pepper, and replaced 2 cups of the water with 2 cups of chicken stock). Also added about 1/2 cup of fresh chives that were left over from another dinner. Great comfort food for a rainy day.

Delicious soup! I omitted the marjoram (simply because I didn't have it) and it was still fantastic. Highly recommend this one.

I am a split pea snob and this was nothing short of mouth watering. I substituted smoked turkey legs for the pork. I actually just tossed them into the soup and pulled them out at the end, took the meat off the legs and added it back into the soup. I only lightly hand mash the soup as I like it chunky. Freezing? YES. Defrosts terrific and tasty!

Rating: 4
Recipe is fantastic and easy, everyone loved it. I doubled recipe so I could freeze some - defrosts great. Used 1/2 water and 1/2 low sodium chicken broth, and used entire bag of peas; added some yukon gold potatoes diced small after running everything else thru cuisinart. Also about 1/4 cup cream at end.

I've made this twice. The second time I doubled the recipe. Only change I made was I used half chicken broth and half water. I always serve with a LOT of tabasco. This is the perfect, traditional split pea soup recipe.

I made this recipe as is and thought it was delish. Next time I might take the previous reviewers' suggestions of doing 1/2 broth 1/2 water and adding more split peas for a thicker texture, but I don't think that would necessarily "improve" it.

I added a potato and bay leaf. It was a fantastic soup and so easy!

So easy, yet so very good. I always use the best hocks available to start with. I did add a bay leaf, and substituted 1/2 the water with chicken stock! A fresh baguette, and my teenager and I had a cheap, healthy, easy, dinner. Neighbor even liked the bowl I brought up too.

Rating: 4
So yummy! I cooked this up for a baby shower and it got rave reviews. I used the entire bag of peas instead of just a cup and a half...came out nice and thick. And I tried it with smoked turkey legs (grocery store was out of ham hocks), but the ham hocks make it taste much better in my opinion. Perfect for a cold day!

Rating: 2
I prefer a thicker pea soup, and next time will try less water, more peas, and/or flour, heavy cream etc. It was so salty that I can't imagine using chicken broth in place of water. On the up side, it was flavorful and my husband (the picky one) enjoyed it. It is definitely a good recipe for leftover Christmas ham!

This soup was much better than I expected. I made it and the family was impressed, too. I used half chicken broth and a rosted pork hock. Next time I'll make a huge batch to freeze some for later- delicious with some crusty bread.

I used this recipe as a guide as I normally do with recipes and it came out great! My dad's mouth was watering even before I gave him a taste. Changes I made as follows: Instead of Smoked Pork Hocks I used the leftover Thanksgiving Ham- which BTW was a Brown Sugar Ham similar to a HoneyBaked, also used about 25 oz Low-sodium chick broth - the rest water, +2 bay leaves, and 1 1/2 c to 2c each of celery, carrots, & onions. I only gave it 3 stars since this is my first split pea recipe and i have none to comopare it to!

This is the quintessential split pea soup - just perfect. Taking other reviewers' advice, I used a 50/50 ratio of broth and water. I brought this to a dinner party and everyone RAVED about it. It's a keeper.

I cooked the ham hocks with celery, carrots, onion, parsley and water the day before, making an incredible broth. Then I was able to skim all the fat off the next day. Follow the recipe exactly the same only substitute the ham hock broth for the water. And Yes, substitute garlic for marjoram.

So easy and so good! A great use of the bone from the spiral ham we had for Easter. I've never made split pea soup before because I've never really cared for commercial versions that are so thick and flavorless. This is a wonderful version! I used chicken broth and didn't bother to puree the soup. I did take a quick whisk to it when it was done cooking and that did a great job of breaking down some of the peas while leaving the soup chunky. Yum!

Out of this world! Like other reviewers, I improvized with bacon (grease drained), fresh rosemary/thyme instead of marjoram, and half chicken broth. Additionally, upon my boyfriend's suggestion, threw in rind from gruyere I had in the fridge. Fabulous!

This is an easy soup to make and goes a long way for an easy supper. The ham hock I bought was hugh so I split it and would recommend you have the buther do this to avoid making it to greasy. I used one slice of ctr. cut bacon instead of butter and fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden. I also had chix broth in the freezer mixed with water. We like our soups thin so if you like it thick use less liquid.

A great and easy recipe for a classic comfort food. I threw in a clove of garlic for extra flavor and for a chunkier soup, skipped the blender by simmering for a longer time. Garnish with parsley.

The first time I made this it was incredible. I thought I would make it again today and leave out the ham. The result was a very watery soup and now I have to figure out a way to salvage it. So, perhaps the ham absorbs water as it cooks? At any rate, I will leave the ham in next time.

This soup was delicious, and so easy. I also used a bone from a spiral ham, and used both chicken broth and water. A definite keeper.

I didn't have pork, so I substituted with pearl barley instead for that extra texture. I agree with those who recommended using 4 cups of broth and 4 cups of water. I also used vegetable broth, just to see how "vegetarian" this soup can become -- and it worked out just fine. I used dried marjoram and added an extra half teaspoon just for that extra kick. The only thing I would do differently next time is reduce cooking time and also not open up so much of the lid to reduce evaporation. Have some extra broth handy just to make sure it doesn't get too dry - that's split pea's soup biggest enemy :-)

Rating: 3
I love this recipe, but I make a few refinements. First, I use a smoked ham shank instead of hock. I think the shank has more meat and delivers just as much flavor. Second, I use three cups of low sodium stock and three cups of water instead of eight cups of water (sometimes I add a little more stock at the end depending on the consistency). When the soup is done, I give it a shot of heavy cream and a couple of very brief pulses with a stick blender.

This is the split-pea soup recipe you want. I probably doubled the recipe because I wanted to use up the whole bag of peas. I substituted 1/2 the water for canned chicken broth. And I used a ham bone left over from a spiral-cut ham in place of the hocks. Also, cooked it much longer than suggested, probably 2-2.5 hours.
