This was super. Followed recipe, but used food processor. Served over chicken prosciutto borsetti (filled pasta). Using 2 9-oz pkgs of fresh pasta, it was the perfect amount of sauce.

bland and boring.

My family loves this. My goofy son doesn't like traditonal tomato sauce with pasta so I tried this and he loved it. I agree with a previous review....double the sauce.

Absolutely delicious and one of our favorites! Double the sauce and use frozen chopped spinach instead of peas and you will have a dinner to die for.

Delicious! Definitely need to double the sauce. I substituted balsamic vinegar for sherry vinegar and chopped frozen spinach for peas.

This was absolutely delicious - rich and creamy without being heavy. I only used about 3/4 lb of pasta (and 1 c. of peas instead of 2), which turned out well, and I found I didn't have to thin the sauce. I used unsalted slivered almonds that I roasted quickly on the stove, which seemed to turn out fine. So fast and easy, I will definitely be repeating this one!

Hands down the saunce needs to be doubled. I made this last night and thought the sauce had an interesting flavor, especially for a late worknight type of meal. The peppers were not completely pureed, and I thought they gave a nice texture together with the almonds. The color was great too. But the flavor of the sauce was lost once it was mixed with the pasta. I froze the leftovers last night and went out this AM to get ingredients to make more sauce which I will put on the leftovers. I used plain sliced almonds and salted to taste, and that was fine. I will add this to my list of weeknight meals to make again, again, with double the sauce.

I purposely did not use a food processor 'cause I wanted the sauce to have some nice texture to it. Guests loved it, but I agree with another reviewer that there is not enough sauce for a pound of pasta (this from someone who militantly undersauces compared to most). I would double the recipe next time.

Great recipe, but note that it does NOT freeze well.

Delicious! I did add a 1/2 tsp more vinegar (cuz I used jarred, not fresh roasted peppers) and have decided that this sauce is just too good to be added to the pasta. The pasta just sucks the life..errr..taste out of the sauce. Though it does taste great for the first few bites, the brightness of this sauce dies in to what becomes fairly bland pasta after those first few bites. I'm going to save it as a baste for grilling chicken/steak skewers, veggies & seafood.

This version of romesco is pretty bland...and for my taste, there was not enough sauce to coat one pound of pasta. In a restaurant where I used to work, we used canned piquillo peppers, which made the flavor bright and intense. I will look for these peppers before making this again!

This was a great way for me to use up the jarred roasted red peppers I had in the fridge and a convenient leftover lunch for a few days at work. I wasn't wowed but I'm glad I tried it. It was my first introduction to Romesco sauce.

Who needs a "speedy" Romesco sauce when the real one is really not "complex"? I've made the real thing & all you need is some good dried sweet red peppers for the real flavor. You can find a recipe - similar to the one here, but w/better peppers & no broth (not needed for flavor!) - in any tapas cookbook. Delicious with scallops!

I used straight Sherry rather than Sherry vinegar and also added a little lemon juice to balance the salt. I simmered the sauce over a filet of haddock - so yummy!

Good taste, easy to make. I substituted Balsamic vinegar for Sherry vinegar and roasted the almonds myself. Since the red peppers give so much flavour to the dish it's significant what brand of canned peppars one gets, the taste is different. A very healthy pasta, veg+nuts+olive oil. A good everyday dish, nothing fancy.

I was going to give this four stars, but my husband said to give it three because it was just "really good" and not "the top of the top." It's super-easy, though. I substituted fresh lemon juice for the sherry vinegar because it's not exactly the kind of thing I keep on hand.
