This was yummy but I wasn't convinced it was all that special.

This was really easy and presented beautifully. I used frozen raspberries instead of strawberries and served it in margarita glasses. A really good company dessert when you're busy worrying about the entree.

Easy, refreshing and delicious. What more could you want in a light summer dessert?

This was a huge success! We made it for Father's Day and even though everyone claimed they needed no dessert, they all gobbled this up. We skipped the part about adding sugar: with all the fruit, it was sweet enough and delicious!

This was an easy receipe. I couldn't find lemon sorbet, so I used 2pints of coconut and 1/2 of strawberry along with Champagne. Nice light and very tasty. Everyone loved it and it was the perfect end to our meal.

This has become one of the offical desserts of the annual "Chick Weekend". It is just enough to end a perfect meal and one can never have enough bubbles!
