This recipe was unbelievably good and very simple, left lots of time to set the table. I marinated over night and would suggest setting the grill to low/medium and grilling longer then finish higher in order to get medium done and a nice crust.

This recipe was very good. My husband, who loves lamb, said it was the best meal we'd had in a while. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I had to use dried. I did use fresh oregano and added some fresh mint leaves to the marinade and as a garnish. I probably used twice the garlic than the recipe calls for and I didn't think it was overpowering at all. I didn't have green peppercorns, so I used freshly ground black pepper. I had never cooked lamb before and wasn't sure as to the wine to use for the marinade. I used a petit sirah (from suggestions on other sites) and think it worked well. I rubbed extra pepper and brown sugar on the outside just before grilling, and I believe that helped to give it a nice crust. Serving suggestion: The Clementine, Olive and Endive Salad also on this site. It sounds strange, but it really works.

This was absolutely delicious. I used more garlic than it called for because I love garlic. I marinated for 12 hours which was definitely adequate. And then grilled it on the gas grill. I paired it with a lemon parsley orzo and asparagus. Yum!

Outstanding exactly as written. We grilled to internal temp 135 and let it rest 10 min before carving. It was wonderful for a company meal.

Lamb was good. Not sure about the reference to ice cream and cookies, however.

Excellent and easy recipe, with a great marinade. I marinated the lamb more time (18 hours) and it was very good.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it turned out delicous with no left overs.

This was excellent! It made a tasty Easter dinner and was quick. The marinade made the whole house smell delicious, and we couldn't wait to eat. I'd definitely make this again.

I don't usually like lamb, but this was the by FAR the best I've ever tasted. If anyone is even slightly inclined to grill lamb (which doesn't happen often for me), this is the one to make. You won't be dissapointed!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is very good, but not very appealing in looks. The red wine and mustard gives the meat a greyish colour. If you can live with that...then the recipe is wonderful with great flavour. I also increased the garlic to 6 cloves (I am a garlicholic) and used lots freshly cracked salt. As for the person who asked about green peppercorns....they are pickled green peppercorns found in speciality shops or condiment section....capers are a pickled flower bud. The two are not related.

We made this recipe for people who didn't really like lamb. Needless to say they loved it. We marinated the lamb for 24 hours and our Easter company thought it was so mild and flavorful. Thank for the help.

What in the world are green peppercorns in brine, and where do you get them? Are they the same thing as capers???? HELP! I would love to make this recipe!

A Very tasty recipe! I let the lamb marinate for about 24 hours then rolled it and put it on a rotisserie on my grill. Unfortunately, I overcooked it. Fortunately, it was delicious anyway. I'd never used a rotisserie before and I cranked the heat a little too high!

This lamb was phenominal. I actually made it for a weekend away with friend and their small children. Each family was responsible for one meal, and mine was dinner. There was some concern if the kids were going to like the lamb (as if I cared) but they ate it up. Young and old loved this recipe, and I probably turned some kids on to something they never had before! I have made this a few times and each time I get raves.

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the amount of garlic and marinated for 1 1/2 days. Definitely a winner.

I've made this dish many times since it first appeared in the magazine. And every time it has been met with rave reviews. I also serve it with the potato, feta and olive recipe which appeared with it when it was first published. It's the best lamb dish I've tried.

It was excellent! I was cautious with the rosemary since it can overpower the flavor of the lamb. I would definitely serve it again to guests.

I doubled (at least) the garlic and marinated it in the refrigerator for 2 days. I barbequed it and served it to our "gourmet" group. Everyone said it was the "best" lamb they have ever tasted.

I made this for my family for Easter dinner, with grilled asparagus and warm red potatoes tossed with feta and olive oil, and they gave it rave reviews. Don't overcook the lamb, and make sure to let the meat rest before you slice it.
