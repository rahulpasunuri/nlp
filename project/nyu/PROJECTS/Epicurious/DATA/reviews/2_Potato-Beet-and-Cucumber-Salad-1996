I would make this salad again, but only with modifications. I didn't like the cukes in the mix! I feel like diced celery would've been less jarring (and more traditional, of course). The dressing is wonderful, even without the herbs. I really did like the beets in that dressing. They pick up the sugar and really fly. Half and half beets and potatoes might be good.
