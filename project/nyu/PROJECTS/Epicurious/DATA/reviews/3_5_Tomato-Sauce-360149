I have made this twice now (half batch each time). It is terrific!! I use quite a bit less garlic and a bit more red pepper- it is a delicious sauce with a good amount of "kick".

I found this sauce to be good basic sauce. Given the reviews, I expected something sensational so I was a bit surprised. I think there are other better sauces out there!

Easy and great results. After 3 hours I did drain some fat and used a hand held mixer for just a bit, to make it more like a sauce. Really great recipe!
