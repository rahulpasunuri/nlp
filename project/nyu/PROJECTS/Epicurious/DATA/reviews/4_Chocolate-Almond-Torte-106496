This was a great torte, but what it really needed was a nice big dollop of freshly made whipped cream. Alone, it was really rich, but the whipped cream balanced everything out.

So easy, so delicious!

To keep the torte from sticking to the pan; butter the bottom of the pan, cut a round of parchment, place it in the pan, butter the parchment and the sides then flour the whole pan. It is now ready for the batter. Do not over cook this torte, if your oven temperature is correct 40 minutes is plenty of cooking time.

I expected a little more out of this recipe because of all the positive reviews. It was good, but to be honest it was little more than a decadent brownie (not a fudge-like brownie but like a crumbly brownie because of the ground almonds.) There was nothing wrong with the way it tasted and people liked it, but it's a lot easier to make a brownie. Anyway, I have to stress that the torte really sticks to the pan. I knew it was an issue so I buttered the pan well but that wasn't good enough. I know Williams-Sonoma makes an expensive spray-on product that is supposedly stellar at preventing this. Maybe that's the thing to use. Also, instead of making 1 big torte I used small springform pans instead. I used 3 pans because I knew this dessert was dense and I didn't think it would rise that much. I was wrong. Next time I will probably use 4 pans. 3 pans will give you that muffin top effect (unattractive with this dessert), and it makes it difficult to get the dessert out.

This was easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly. I sprinkled a few fresh raspberries on top for decoration. It was good, but very chocolately. Almost too chocolately.

Rating: 3
This was good, but quite time- consuming. Also, I didn't butter the springform pan well enough because it didn't come out cleanly at all. I was still able to salvage it and serve it to guests, but make sure you butter your pan VERY VERY well. If I make it again, I will probably try to use a regular 10 in round cake pan. In any case, the cake itself was delicious, especially if you love almond flavor.

Moist and rich with a delicious flavor. I love the taste of roasted almonds as opposed to raw and so used a bit of the butter to brown the almonds slightly before processing them (after letting them cool). I think it really helped bring out the flavor.

Delicious and not too much work involved. I substituted the extract for one tablespoon of ground coffee and it turned out looking and tasting great.

Quick, easy, very tasty & moist. Also freezes well, as I found out.

It was rich and delicious. I brought it into a class at school and everyone raved about it. I had to cook it for about 20 more minutes than the recipe said because the middle was gloppy when i first pulled it out. It wasn't a firm cake, but the taste was exceptional.

Great recipe, impresses dinner guests without too much work. I do recommend using high- quality chocolate and cutting the richness by serving with ice cream or whipped cream.

Really decadent. I didnt have almond extract, so I used vanilla. In the future, Ill probably use almond extract, because my version did not have enough of an almond taste. I recommend serving this with cream or vanilla ice cream.

This is a simple (if you have all the required equipment) recipe that pleases all chocolate lovers. I followed the recipe to the tee. It really doesn't need any embellishment, the Sharfenberger chocolate and almond paste really comes through. The port we served with it was a nice substitution for fruit!

Served at a dinner party to reviews. I thought that the almond taste was a little to strong but I must have been the only one. I wish I could have given this recipe 3 1/2 forks.

Elegant and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. I topped mine with whipped cream and fresh raspberries. Delicious!

Simple. Elegant. Delicious. I served this for New Year's. I made this substitution: I used orange peel (similar to Spanish version) rather than lemon. Make it the day ahead. I used Valrhona chocolate. I garnished with cara cara orange slices (I found these oranges at Costco, and they are divine. The fruit looks like ruby red grapefruit. Sweet and seedless) and topped with slightly sweetened whipped cream spiked with Grand Marnier. My guests loved it.

This is an awesome recipe. One of the most amazing things is that it uses no flour, and no flour is required. I did not use lemon peel. I used 70% Schaffer Berger chocolate for the chocolate, and the taste of the torte is exceptional. Nick Malgeri makes the same torte using walnuts, and just a touch of flour. Next time, I might add a touch of flour. Without the flour, this is a perfect desert recipe for Passover, and Schaffer Berger chocolate (top rated with Santender by Gourmet Magazine) is kosher.

Seriously delicious, elegant and easy. I used pre-ground almonds and only 2/3 cup sugar. I replaced the lemon with a teaspoon of vanilla, and didn't bother to make the crust, just sprayed the pan with cooking spray. I circled the tart with strawberry halves for a beautiful presentation. It was perfect.

This torte is delicious. I do add a bit more almond extract (just a little as it can overpower all the other flavors) but overall it is just divine.

Rating: 4
This was divine ! It is flourless but not as rich tasting as the traditional flourless chocolate cakes. I made it early for Passover, froze it, and defrosted the night before in the wrappings in the refrigerator. I used the equivalent weight of preground almonds from Trader Joes. (Comes in 1 lb packages). I also took the advice of an earlier reviewer and baked it in a 9" pan. I will definitely make this again and again throughout the year.

The torte was easy to make. It's a solid chocolate torte -- but it lacks the wow factor. Good but not great.

Made it with mostly brown sugar and unsweetened and semi-sweet chocolate and it still turned out great. Served it with real whipping cream (NOT from a can) and a rasberry sauce made with frozen rasberries and honey. It was delicious and it looked great!!! Just like in Italy. Try topping it with a mint leaf.

i made this cake last year for Passover and it was devine. I'm not a baker but it was easy enough to follow and creat a success. As a matter of fact, it was so successful that I had to make it a few more times just to hear my husbands' mmmmmm. Needless to say it's going to be on the dessert menu this passover as well.

I made this for an Italian-themed dinner party. Everyone loved it, even a person who doesn't really like sweets. It looked just like the picture, which NEVER happens for me!! It's an intense slice of cake, and I am a major chocolate lover. I cut 16 slices instead of 12, and that was just right. Great w/ coffee. Next time I make it, I think I will add more almonds and reduce the sugar and/or chocolate. I used semi sweet chocolate chips in my cake, and it turned out well enough, but maybe a little sweeter than I would prefer. Next time I will compensate by reducing sugar. I have a real cheapie, thin cake pan and overbaked by a few minutes, so probably start checking at about 33 minutes or so. Overall, though, fantastic. Pretty easy, looks great, tastes fancy.

FABULOUS! I couldn't believe that something this easy to make could be so decadent. I made it for a family dessert and 5 of us had polished it off by breakfast the next morning! I don't even LIKE baked goods with nuts in them! Did I mention how FABULOUS this was???!!!

I made this recipe for a big Italian dinner and it got rave reviews. I served it with fresh whipped cream that had some almond extract added to it. I also took some additional slivered almonds, candied them, then used them as a garnish. Delicioso!

This was a big hit at a recent dinner party. Everyone loved it. I thought it wasn't quite enough chocolate flavor, but still very good. I served it with a raspberry sauce which was a nice addition. I used a lot of powdered sugar and some garden roses/petals for presentation as it definatly needs something to make it prettier.

Maybe I blanched the almonds too long, but I didn't think the almond flavor came through very well. Next time I will add extra almond extract. Other than that, I thought it was delicious.

A delicious alternative to a traditional chocolate cake! The prep was pretty simple (though my egg yolks never did "fall in heavy ribbons"). A big hit at our dinner club! The chocolate/almond flavor was wonderful and the texture was really moist! I'll definitely make it again!

I have made this several times and everyone asks for the recipe...I prefer a 9" pan..presents better.QUESTION...didn't anyone find the dough very difficult to handle...seemed incredible thick..the first time I was surprised how good it was given the struggle to get it together.

Wow. I can't think of a better word. I used Giradelli's double chocolate chips. This was incredible - the gooey filling of a brownie in a cloud like texture. It didn't cut cleanly. Next time I'll force myself to follow the directions and let it cool completely before slicing it.

Wonderful. This torte is a cross between a decadent brownie and a candy bar. It is a chocolate lover's delight. Also easy to whip up and looks beautiful with the powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

Great recipe! I wasn't sure what the texture and taste would be like, it was hard to tell by the way the torte looked, but it was really good! Served it with a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt! I will make this again!

A chocoate lover's delight! Baked it for 30 minutes and the texture was beautiful. Only critiscism is the lacklustre presentation.
