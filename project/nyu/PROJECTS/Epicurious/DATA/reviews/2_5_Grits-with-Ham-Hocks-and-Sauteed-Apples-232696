I don't know where others buy their ham hocks, but mine are usually tender enough after simmering for an hour--you're just using the meat, not the skin. I wouldn't imagine a ham hock would deliver a tasty stock with just plain water--in my humble opinion, chicken stock is warranted.

A couple of things - I've never known ham hocks to become tender in only one hour of cooking time under ANY circumstances! Also, ham hocks have so much flavor on their own that it's totally unnecessary to cook them in chicken stock. It's overkill.

Sounds great - regarding the apples, you should click the words "Sauteed Apples" in the recipe- this is a link to another recipe.

nicking--the Sauteed Apples are a separate recipe-if you put your cursor over "Sauteed Apples" and click, it brings you to a separate page for that recipe--and tells you how many apples, etc.

Something is missing here!! How many apples? How long should they cook?
