I also roasted the eggplant, pepper & garlic together. I also added a roasted vidalia onion. After tasting, it was a bit bland, so I sprinkled with some sea-salt and grated parmesan cheese and that seemed to give it the lift it needed. Oh, I used Trader Joe's Organic Whole Wheat pasta. If you have a Trader Joe's near you, give it a try, very tasty!

Thanks to other reviewers' cautioning about blandness, I kicked the flavor up in this recipe with chopped red onion and chunks of feta cheese...Delicious!

It was just okay... I got good reviews, but I have very nice friends. I thought is was boring. I read the other cooks notes about it being a bit bland so I added lots of extra garlic...didn't help.

I took the advice of another reviewer and roasted the eggplant, red pepper and garlic together (it took about an hour, the last fifteen minutes at 350?). Assembled the dish several hours before serving -- it was very nice.

Very nice hot as well as cold. Slender Japanese eggplants also work.

Work intensive, but very good if it marinates overnight. The garlic was too sharp immediately and the pasta had no flavor. Attractive colors. I would roast the garlic, eggplant, and pepper together next time to simplify, or even try sauteeing.

Thought this dish was really quite tasty, even though I've never been a big eggplant fan. The roasting just really makes it. It was a little too oily for me, so I'd probably use a Tbsp. less oil in the dressing.

I thought this recipe was a lot of work for minimal payoff. It doesn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.

Wonderful dish! One of our favorites when fresh vegetables are plentiful. Try it with small white eggplant--You won't need to salt and drain this sweet variety. Also, I roast the peppers ahead of time and freeze them in individual bags.

One of my summer favorites (always dig out that back issue; today I found it online!)
