I used this for the ice cream recipie and really loved it. I did use low fat milk instead of whole given the amount of cream that was already in there and it is heavenly.

Excellent recipe; the ice cream is rich and delicious (I would make a half-recipe next time because the whole recipe is too large for my Krups ice cream freezer and you only need half for the amount of cookies the recipe produces.) I made one inch mounds which spread to two inch cookies and it made 36 cookies. These cookies stay chewy when frozen, unlike some, which become very hard.
