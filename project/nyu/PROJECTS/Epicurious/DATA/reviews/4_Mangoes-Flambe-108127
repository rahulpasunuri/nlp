I wasn't thrilled with this dish - didn't enjoy the consistency of the cooked mango. I ended up ditching the mango and enjoyed the sauce with some sauted bananas. It was good in the end, but I hate to waste a good mango!!!

My rum must not have been high enough proof, because it would not light. Nevertheless, this was still quick and delicious.

Great presentation! Very quick and easy, too. Perfect for my first BBQ of the summer! I doubled the rum sauce, so there was more to pour over the mangoes. Will try it over ice cream next time.

Wow. What a perfect, tasty healthy dish. Will definitely make this a staple in my IBS diet. It's better than ice cream.

warm, caramelized mango? yummy! However, could not get the rum to flame up. Lost the cool factor, but still very delicious and healthy

With four mango trees in our yard, I am always looking for new ways to use them. I tried this one last summer with guest from Ohio. This summer it was their first request. If you like mango you will love this, if you don't, give them to someone who does.

Question: How is this dish eaten? Do you pick up the mango and take bites to peel the fruit from the skin? That doesn't seem likely if ice cream is involved. Knife and fork and spoon? I'm suffering from a limited imagination, apparently.

Fantastic recipe - as long as you have ripe mangoes! A great idea for a dinner party, because it's very easy and quick, but will impress your guests.

A wonderful, easy and fairly healthy dessert which even pleased my pastry loving husband. Will make it often and probably serve it with coconut or vanilla icecream for guests (no longer so healthy!).

Go man-goe! I love simple, elegant, dramatic, delicious recipes. This fit the bill. I didn't have raw sugar on hand, so I used brown sugar. Simply yummy!
