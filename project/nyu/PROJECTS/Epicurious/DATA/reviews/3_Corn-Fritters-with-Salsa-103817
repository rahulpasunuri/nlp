To the cook who thought the fritters were gritty, let the batter rest for about 10 minutes. The cornmeal should soften up by then. Good luck!

My family liked these A LOT, and they especially liked them with sour cream, although they deemed the salsa unnecessary (I served it as a side). I thought that the batter was not especially runny, and that the cornmeal had already made the texture rather gritty. No one else thought that they were gritty, but I certainly would not suggest adding more cornmeal. If it's too runny, do what another reviewer suggested and add more corn. I can see why people thought that these were bland, but I added lots of salt and white pepper, and some chives and basil from my garden. I can see how these would also work with syrup, or with frozen corn. Yum.

I quadrupled this recipe and made it for a big group. It was wonderful. We didn't have cornmeal so I substituted Jiffy cornbread mix for the cornmeal and flour which worked just great. It was equally tasty topped with salsa & sour cream as with maple syrup or honey. It was also very easy to make.

I had recently had "Indonesian corn fritters' in a restaurant and was looking for a recipe. I used this as my base. First I made the fritters as the recipe says -- good. Then I added minced scallion -- very good. (And I bet it would be nice with queso fresca in it at that point.) Then I tried some with Balti seasoning and some others with Rogan Josh seasoning (both from Penzey's)as well as scallions. Terrific! Would also work with regular curry powder & scallions. We topped with varying salsa, depending on the seasoning mix, plus sour cream or plain yogurt. It's a versatile recipe that can meet many uses.

This recipe is extremely close to a ricotta corn fritter recipe that appeared in Gourmet a few years ago. I think what's missing is the cup of ricotta, which is why many reviewers had watery batter. Anyway, the ricotta version is fantastic, and this works just as well with canned corn or frozen corn. I make the fritters small and serve as appetizers 9as the original called for) or over a salad.

Faced with an enviable surplus of fresh "How Sweet It Is" corn in our garden this year, I made these fritters from some left-over corn on the cob. Served with Avocado Salsa (Gourmet June 1995) and a side dish of black beans, it's a comlete meal. If your batter seems too thin, you probably need to add more CORN, not more flour. A fabulous summer treat!

I enjoined these very much. I made the salsa, and it was wonderful, with tomatoes from our garden and a dollop of sour cream... yummy. I shall make again and try with syrup. I did add a bit more corn starch and flour.

I have never made corn fritters before - only seen photos of them. Mine turned out fine and my daughter proclaimed this dish very delicious. I did not make the salsa but I am sure it is good as the recipe looks like my salsa recipe. Batter was liquidy but it did not give me any problems. People who added more flour etc probably like a denser pancake - it's really individual taste.

I followed one of the previous reviewer's suggestions and topped them with black beans. They turned out great and were really easy to make. A great meatless main course for those avoiding meat.

not worth the mess of frying. definitely needed to add more flour to keep the things from falling apart. and then... they were boring and unattractive. didn't make the salsa as already had some made.

This makes a nice, end-of-summer weeknight meal. I liked it; my husband loved it. While the batter is a bit runny, it cooks up fine--I didn't add any additional flour or cornmeal, but I was pleased with the results. The salsa was good, too. I was a little heavy-handed with the jalapenos, which I'll back off on next time.

These were a delicious with black beans, a tomato slice and a fried egg stacked on top. I added extra flour to the batter because they were a bit runny, and cooked them in some bacon drippings. Satisfying and tasty. I'll make them again.

This dish is a tasty and very quick meal. Normally I can never get my busy family to the table for dinner. I was starting to feel that my family wasn't spending enough time together. My daughter had soccer so we had to eat early and my husband had to work late so he had dinner at 9:00. When I made these DELICIOUS corn fritters my husband came home early and my daughter skipped soccer that night. Thank you SO much GOURMET for reuniting and blessing my loved ones with your wonderful recipe!!!!!

The fritters were boring. I had to keep adding flour and corn meal just to get them "pancake-ish". The salsa however was great and I WILL make that again.

Not exactly gourmet but homey comfort food. I've made them several times -- for a quick easy supper and as a side dish with ham. They turn out best when you use lots of corn -- 2 really big ears or 3 smaller ones.

These were a big disappointment.

I made two batches of mini fritters as an appetizer, but spiced them up with cayenne, garlic, minced jalapeno, and minced (dried) onion. I served them topped with a dollop of sour cream and a bit of salsa and they were all scarfed up. One of our guests was a professional chef and he couldn't stop eating them. Easy & tasty. The basic recipe would probably have been good with maple syrup but a bit on the bland side for a side dish, I think.

These were really yummy. We had them with maple syrup for breakfast. My 8 year old son thought this was the "best receipe in the world."

I made this on a whim, my mother used to make fritters all the time. These were excellent, rich and satisfying. My whole family loved them. They definitely need salt.

A great recipe! Didn't make the salsa, but served with maple syrup....they were great....

I served these as my starch for a lunch. They were good. I can only imagine what they would be like with syrup on a Sunday morning. Will try that next.

I first made this dish in the summer when corn is fresh and in season. Since it is out of season now I substitute with frozen corn and this works just as well. The salsa goes very nicely with it. Gives it a fresh taste. I have passed this on to family and friends and they all love it. Try it!

I made the fritters but not the salsa (too lazy). This is an excellent corn fritter recipe. The texture is very pleasing to the toungue and the belly. The taste is great. It costs next to othign to make and is very easy to assemble. Delish! I will make it again and again.

Great comfort food!! Very easy to make, and good with either maple syrup or salsa (I tried both in one sitting). I'm passing this recipe on to my mom !!

Followed the recipe to the letter and was disappointed! When i tried to flip the fritters, they fell apart!

I served these with a farmer's market-purchased green salsa and they were wonderful. They were also great slightly cooled right out of the pan - one of the advantages of being the cook! The cornmeal gave them a nice additional texture.

This is a must try. Had it with ham last night for a DELICIOUS, fast, easy, and beautifully presented weeknight meal. Would make it for company too.

I liked both the fritters and the salsa. Half the batter I made as in the recipe and half I added some chopped red pepper for color. After frying, you couldn't see the color. So much for that idea! I think it would be equally good with canned or frozen corn come winter. I have four left over that I plan to reheat as a test for making in advance.

Maybe I didn't make this right or something but will never make again. The fritters are heavy and tasteless. The only thing that made them palatable was the salsa and sour cream paired with them.
