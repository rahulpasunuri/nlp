I made this chile and thought it was very good for a fast recipe. I also liked the fact that it doesn't make a big, massive pot. I'm not a chili-head, but I really enjoyed it. Made it for dinner with the Super Bowl. Instead of the canned chipotles I used an envelope of Williams Chipotle Chili seasoning. And I like a dollop of sour cream on top of chili to cool down the heat. Like raita in Indian cooking.

I thought this was really really good! I was put off by the review that it was "out of a can" but when it was ready to eat all the vegetables stayed really colorful and apetizing. The spice doesn't hit you till you're about to swallow. I added canned red peppers chopped up and substituted tomato sauce for canned chopped tomatoes.

This recipe was nothing special. In fact, it tasted like something out of a can.
