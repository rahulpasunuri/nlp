Made this recipe just as written. For beans I used white kidney, black beans and garbanzos. For pasta I used 100% whole wheat corkscrews and under cooked them so they would absorb the liquids from the sauce.

I had two observations about this recipe; one, that I thought giving the sauce the full 25 minutes to cook down was an important step, allowing the flavors to blend and for a bean/bacon stew to become more like an actual pasta sauce. Also, my preference was to use cannellini and chick peas, but I think I stirred the sauce so much as it cooked that by the end the soft cannellini virtually disappeared into mush. That, too, gave the sauce a nice, thick texture but I think the next time I do it I'll cook the sauce at a lower heat and not stir it so much.

I thought it was great for an easy meal, I made it for my family. They seemed to like it!

yummy! Have made it twice. bacon, garlic and wine ... what's not to love? added extra herbs (basil, parsley) and used oyster mushrooms.

This recipe has all the ingredients i love yet i did not enjoy this dish at all. All i tasted was the wine. Maybe the one i used was too heavy but that's what i had leftover. I wish i had just drank the rest of it instead of trying this recipe. Very disappointed!

I didn't have any mushrooms so I left those out. Halved the recipe and only used cannelini beans. Added fresh thyme and basil. Very easy to make and perfect for a weeknight meal.

This dish is incredibly easy and one of the tastiest I've made in several months. I used pre-sliced crimini mushrooms from Trader Joe's which made it even easier. I loved not having to chop or cut anything yet ending up with a super-tasty, healthy dish. I've passed this recipe along to several friends and my mother, who used to work in a test kitchen at a food magazine so she has VERY discrimanating tastes!

What a great, hearty pasta dish! All of the ingredients are staples in my kitchen, so this is likely to become a standard weeknight dinner.

Have some imagination, D.C. I am not a big fan of Bon Appetit, but this is a trickle down version of a simple Italian meal. Snub your nose at bacon? Try pancetta or proscuitto. I have some lamb shank bones in the freezer for making stock/broth and a proscuitto bone I am thinking of making a soup with. The point is, this IS not low rent, though I could refer you to some recipes on this site that are, but I will keep my foodie snobery to myself.

This was very quick and easy to make. My husband and kids liked it. I halved the recipe and only used one can of cannellini beans, but it turned out very well.

A very tasty dish that's easy to make. Anyone who thinks it's "low rent" should subscribe to another magazine.

Distinctly low-rent. Only if you're desperate. And even then. . . .

Absolutely delicious, high protein meal...eveyone loved it, including the kids. This recipe can be easily doubled for larger parties. Perfect for buffets.
