The simmering apple juice and horseradish smelled like something I would use to straighten my hair but I continued with the recipe anyway. One dinner guest canceled which gave me the opportunity to taste the finished product. Can I give this recipe a negative fork? When I tasted it, I promptly threw it down the drain. I changed the recipe with good results. NO HORSERADISH! I added 2 TBL of Calvados, 2 TBL Fine Herbs, 1 TBL sugar to the apple juice and gelatin. I used a very sweet pear in the place of the apple, which gave a greater contrast to the savory fennel. I chopped the fennel and pear a bit finer. It was well received.

Vegetarian or not, this was a terrific alternative to a salad. Light and refreshing the apple and horseradish combination was wonderful. The horseradish comes off as savory, not spicy. Made as written the flavors are well balanced and subtle.

Just a quick note: this recipe isn't truly vegetarian due to the gelatin. I just think it's miscategorized under the "vegetarian" search results.

This is lovely and different. I think it would be especially nice surrounded by poached shrimp and diced avocado.
