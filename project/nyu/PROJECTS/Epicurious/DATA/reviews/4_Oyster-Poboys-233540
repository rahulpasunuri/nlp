So yummy! I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Totally hooked on deep fried oysters...

Hmm, it's easy enough to fry up oysters, but the most essential ingredient to a po-boy is the bread, and you can't get it anywhere but New Orleans. Po-boy bread is somewhat spongy with a hard but light crust and must be toasted.

I like this recipe since I can taste the oysters primarily, but they are encased in a pleasingly spicy light breading. I fried mine in a cast iron skillet on top of the stove and did not use as much oil as called for. They were not as crispy as those in New Orleans, so next time I'm going to increase the heat at the beginning or use the thermometer as suggested.

Hey folks, you need to put some tomatos on that poboy unless you want it undressed: Dressed in Southern Louisiana means: Mayonnaise Mustard Lettuce Tomoato Onions Maybe Pickles And possibly Ketchup, but not on a PoBoy http://www.dougriddle.com/recipes/The_New_Orleans_Style_Poboy.html

Take me back to Baltimore's harbor area!!! I can hear the jazz musicians playing outdoors as I type. This is the world's most perfect sandwich, and I can't wait to make this again and again! Try this, you will love it!

Oh, my goodness: I've died and gone to heaven! The only things missing are a bottle of Jax, a table at the Cafe du Monde and a plate of beignets.
