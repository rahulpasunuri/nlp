I think this should be named Cheesecake Sherbet b/c it tastes exactly like cheesecake..I'm sure this could be made much more inexpensively using cream cheese, which I will try out next time. Also, this is more like light ice cream, not sorbet--sorbet is icy like Italian ice, this is NOTHING like that. Sherbet has water and dairy in it, so this technically is more of a sherbet than sorbet. That said, if you want to save $$$, use cream cheese instead. I thought this would be overly sweet b/c of corn syrup and sugar, but the measurements were perfect...and the lemon is refreshing and delicious.

I have made this twice now for dinner parties. It is so unexpectedly delicious. It's the perfect dessert after a rich meal. My guests RAVE about it.

I was served this sorbet last night after a Persian dinner. My friend said the recipe was incredibly easy. The sorbet was creamy, tangy, and delicious. I found it not as rich as other homemade ice creams due to the preparation of the base was not a custard cooked on the stove with the addition of eggs, but my dining companions thought it seemed rich for a sorbet. All in all, everyone agreed that the dessert was tasty! We served the sorbet with a syrup made with honey, Sauternes, white cardamom and rose water, and topped with toasted pistachios. It was refreshing and memorable!
