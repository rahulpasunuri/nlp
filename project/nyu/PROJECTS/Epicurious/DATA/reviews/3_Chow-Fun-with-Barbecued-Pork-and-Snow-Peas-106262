The flavors of this dish are pretty good, I made as written with the addition of 1tsp of red chili garlic sauce (vietnamese variety). I would however say, there is simply not enough sauce to sufficiently season such a large quantity of noodles. In future I would probably double sauce and add some hoisin for sweet/savory/spicy balance.

Have made this twice now and have been somewhat underwhelmed. Followed the recipe and both times the noodles fell apart. We live close to an Asian market where I got all the necessary ingredients including fresh chow fun noodles. The sauce does not compare to the chow fun dishes we have enjoyed at various Chinese restaurants, it's lacking a smokey flavor note, not sure why? The flavors are good but I want more, think I'll look for a chow fun recipe elsewhere.

This is a good, basic recipe that needs a little help to make it a wow. My family thought it was kind of bland and so the next time I make it I'll pump it up with a little heat and seasonings. Very simple to make and adapts to other meats and noodles.

Store bought rice noodles as well as BBQ pork pieces so I just followed the directions for the rest, but my noodles stuck together quite quickly (perhaps b/c I used vegetable oil?) and the presentation wasn't quite as nice as I expected. However, the taste was good, sauce similar as in the restaurants, but a tad oily. My kids digged in and loved it, I will try again with peanut oil to see if that would make the turnout successful.

I didn't make this yet. I am going to use the Silver wrapped chicken recipe to make the pork. I have made the silver wrapped chicken many times with good results.

Yummy chow fun! I substituted beef for the pork. Marinated in chile garlic sauce, oyster sauce and sherry. I quickly stir fried the beef first, then removed it from the pan and followed the recipe, adding it back to the wok at the end. I also added sliced mushrooms, jullienned carrots, more garlic, more ginger and more chile garlic sauce. Fresh noodles from chinatown made it taste just like a restaurant! Loved it!

Great. I used packaged noodles from super mart. but did toss them with a little more oil than called for. I had roast pork from another recipe so I made the chow fun without meat this time. It came out great. Will definitely make again.

I thought the noodles came out too soggy in this dish. Maybe I should of put them in for less time, but I followed the directions and put them in first. I don't think I will be making this dish again.

This is a good recipe- make quick chasu pork like this-4 lbs pork loin roast, 1/2 c. soy sauce, 2 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp. molasses, 4 Tbsp ketchup, 1 clove garlic, chopped fine. Cut pork into 1-1/2" x 1-1/2" x 5" strips. Marinate pork in the sauce for at least 2 hrs. Bake @ 350 for l hour. Baste with sauce frequently. Let stand a few minutes be- fore slicing. Serve with hot mustard. From an old Japanese community cookbook- tis good!

This was pretty good; the noodles were sticky - (I had to use dry rice fettucine since fresh is not readily available). I have my own recipe for cha sui that is really good. I will make this again.

We loved this recipe. I used the pork recipe that Pat suggested - delicious - and since I couldn't find fresh rice noodles, just plain old linguine (cooked). The dish came out wonderful.

This was a real disappointment. The noodles would not separate and ended up as a gloppy mess. The char sui pork was ok. I cut up a pork roast and marinated it in the sauce overnight, then baked it for about 30 minutes as recommended on the sauce jar. But overall this was not very good and I will not be making it again. Too bad, I love chow fun.

I made the barbecued pork recipe Pat suggested one day, and then the chow fun another. This dish is by far some of the best Chinese I have ever eaten and it is almost as good as you-know-what (key word: almost!). My children enjoyed it too, even the finicky hot dog/hamburger/pizza/chicken nugget/mac-n-cheese boy under my roof who balks at eating anything else. This recipe's a keeper!

Has anyone used dried rice noodles? I have not seen fresh in the Chinese markets here in New Orleans.

I had never cooked Chinese food before and it was fantastic. The only problem I had was the rice noodles stuck to the wok and were a bit gummy. I might add them later next time. If you have left over cha-sui, it's delicious as an appetizer served with hot mustard! FYI-the oyster sauce has MSG in it. Not so much that it gave me the ususal headache, but for those who are sensitive...

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but plan to. In answer to how to get cha sui pork, in Los Angeles, at least, where there are Chinese barbecue take-out restaurants, one can order it already sliced and cooked by weight. It is yummy and can flavor any stir-fried vegetables you mix with it. Cooks in other cities with a population of Chinese heritage may also be able to find it this way.

Yum! As an american born chinese, chow fun is my favorite dish! You can buy char-siu sauce in many major supermarkets now. Lee Kum Kee makes a char-siu sauce and a chinese barbaque sauce that both work well. Pork tenderloin makes a nice lean BBQ pork. Rub the sauce on the pork & let it sit overnight. Then bake it at about 325. If you're wondering why it's not bright red like the kind you get in restaraunts or chinese delis, it's because they use red food coloring.
