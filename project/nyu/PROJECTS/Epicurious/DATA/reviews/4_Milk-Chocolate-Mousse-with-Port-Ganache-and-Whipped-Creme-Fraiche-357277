I made this no bake dessert also! Everyone loved it. I quickly began thinking of other flavors. I noticed that someone said they had used French vanilla. I assume for the cake part, which sounds great. I wondered if anyone had tried to make the mousse a different flavor. Everyone at my house is voting for raspberry and I discover this fantastic recipe that youll surely love, http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/raspberry-streusel-muffins! Better try it now!

This is exceptional! I made it this weekend for our annual Halloween dessert party (which was postponed due to the October snow storm in NJ!), and it was a huge hit! It's so easy to make, and the results are fantastic. This is defintely a keeper!

This was fantastic! A wonderful, rich no-bake dessert. Lots of dirty pots and pans, but it didn't take very long, and it was soooo worth it! I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips for both the mousse and the ganache, and they melted beautifully. Per other reviews, I thinned as needed with extra cream and/or port. Next time, I will wait to fold the creme fraiche into the whipped cream right before serving, so it doesn't go flat. But the tastes blended together beautifully, and that port syrup is to die for!

Absolutely delicious. I will be making this again.

Made this again, and to amend my previous review: this time, cooked the custard over very very low heat - "medium low" heat as directed is too high and will result in bits of cooked egg, unless your stove top is really wimpy. Whisked constantly over a flame just about as low as it would go without turning off, and the result was smooth and didn't need to be strained. And, the overall result was much better - less liquidy before going into the fridge to chill, and much lighter in color. Besides the difference in cooking the custard, the only other difference was the type of chocolate - used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips the first time, and Private Selection (generic) milk chocolate chips from Ralph's this time. Sooo good - the port syrup and the mousse especially are unforgettable. One guest said it was the best dessert she's ever had! Be sure to put a bowl of strawberries on the table so guests can clean their plates with them.

This is insanely good. Followed the advice of others here and made all the components; it's well worth it. To avoid the problem of the ganache turning into a leaden mass, as someone commented here, either chop your chocolate really finely, or use chips, preferably mini chips. The custard base of the mousse is a very small amount, not really enough to melt 6 oz. of chocolate, so had to add another tablespoon of cream to it, which was enough to melt everything (whisking it all over the heat for a moment helped, too). The custard base had some bits of cooked egg in it (despite whisking constantly over very low heat), and the mousse would have been silkier without those bits. Next time, will strain the custard before adding the chocolate. Tried the spoon procedure as directed here, and it just didn't look that great; it looked like the photo, in fact. Not elegant enough for such an elaborate and fabulous dish. Next time, will pour the mousse into small ramekins to chill (don't worry if the mousse is liquid at first - it sets up perfectly in the fridge), then place the ramekins on larger plates to serve and garnish with the ganache, syrup, cream and sliced strawberries, which add some needed color.

Decadent! Way too sweet for me and I used 55% chocolate bars. Not very difficult to make just alot of steps and many dirty dishes. The mousse was my favorite part-creamy and fluffy-will definately make the mousse again with a tad bit darker bar.

Individual components of this dish were exceptional (the port reduction and the chocolate ganache), and the combination of flavors was delicious. Don't even think about making this mousse on its own though- it would be too sweet and really needs the complexity of the other components. I rated this three stars because I had problems with execution of the mousse- it seemed needlessly complex to have to make a custard and I had to coax the chocolate mixture back into a form where it would blend with the other ingredients (egg whites and cream) because when I mixed the custard and chocolate it just became this hard leaden mass. I would make this again, but would probably use a different mousse recipe.

This was really fun to make and present. I made it for my parents and husband for a Valentine's dinner and everyone was licking their plates! The mix of flavors- tangy creme fraiche, sweet and sour port wine reduction, and rich, sweet mousse... it was perfect!

We made this as Valentine's Day dessert and really loved it. Port and chocolate generally go well together and this dessert is no exception. I bought ruby Porto Morgado from Trader Joe's and my husband and I both thought it went well in the dish and as a dessert drink. We used Trader Joe's chocolate as well, two 3.5 oz. milk chocolate bars and one 3.5 oz dark chocolate bar.
