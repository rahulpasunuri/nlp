Nice dish and makes a lot. Perfect for a few days lunches.

This is delicious with vegetable broth, fairly quick, and pretty healthy. It came out too dry the time I made it with fewer onions but is moist enough made (mostly) as written. Halving works well, and the leftovers taste good for a day or two.

I made this with a Lamb roast. In place of prunes I added dates. I agree that the Middle Eastern couscous is far better suited to this recipe than the grittier grain couscous. It was a hit w/guests. A sweet companion to the lamb.

Very nice dish as it is. The flavors and scents blend in a soft, pleasing way.

I've made a variation of this recipe which was great; I think the biggest contributor to whether is is moist or dry is whether one uses western couscous (the little tiny sand like grains) or eastern couscous (the bigger, almost pasta like grains that look more like orzo)...the eastern couscous is, IMHO, way better for this sort of thing.

This is extrememly dry and needs a lot more of everything other than couscous.

i havent tried this as yet. i found it while searching for a beef cous cous. i improvised one using stock, carrots, turnips, short ribs, cumin, paprika, fresh ginger, garlic, onions, summer squash, tomatoes, canned chick peas,golden raisins and minced cilantro.the broth was aromatic, the meat tender. I served the broth separately, i served the vegetables and meat with cous cous. i highly recommend it. i will try the sweet cous cous in the future.

It was OK, nothing spectacular. It makes a lot. I would recommend adding more garbanzo beans, prunes and almonds.

Sorry to be a kill-joy, but I thought that this recipe was horrible!! Like the cook from Wisconsin, I was concerned that it would be too bland. So, I followed her substitutions. Still, this just seemed like something from the Moosewood cookbook gone bad!

Just made this dish for my partner. It was wonderful. Please take the time to make the candied butternut squash - not only is it delicious on its own, but it adds a wonderful, sweet moistness to the couscous. Thought it wouldn't be spicy enough, so I added the following amounts of spices in place of the cinnamon: 1 1/2 t. cumin, 1 1/2 t. sweet paprika, 1/2 t. of tumeric, 1/2 t. ground coriander, 1/8 t. cinnamon. Again, it was wonderful!

I substituted sweetened dried cranberries for the prunes and added 1/2 tsp. cumin, also used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian - excellent.

Very good. I added cumin, garlic and scallions to the onions and used raisins instead of prunes. Terrific for mid-week side dish (but would work for company too).

Loved this one! But it does make a lot - I'd say it serves 8-10 if using as a side dish.

This recipe worked out perfect. My family requires spice so the addition of curry, cumin and crushed red pepper made it a hit. The plums are the topper.

I resisted the urge to add extra spicing, since I was serving this with a spicy chicken recipe, and was glad that I'd chosen to keep as is. It was delightful, and ended up being a nice contrast with the spicy chicken - still very flavorful, but in a different and complementary way. This recipe makes a LOT of couscous, and is easily halved.

we used toasted walnuts and made the beans from scratch they come out more tender. We also took it up a notch: garlic with the onions cumin and cilantro. Forget the mint it did not add anything. the squash was great we reduced the sugar but used 1/2 a lemon.

I had a dinner party and my guests wanted my variation of this recipe. I added garlic to the onions and did not use the prunes and almonds. I served grilled vegetables and a meatloaf from ground turkey & turkey sausage. I buy rice and grains in bulk so this recipe came in handy. Thank you

I made a quicker, easier version of this recipe which we really enjoyed. I didn't use the onion. Instead of prunes, I used craisins (dried cranberries) and a little extra cinammon.

I found this recipe a bit bland, but I enjoyed it a lot after making my own additions. I used twice the garbanzo beans, twice the cinnamon, plus about 2.5 tsp cumin, 2 tsp coriander, and a little cayenne.

Wow what a fantastic Couscous Recipe! The addition of prunes to the traditional Maghreb regional dish is superb. Care must be taken to not burn the onions. It does take about twenty minutes to do this properly. Follow the recipe and you can't go wrong.
