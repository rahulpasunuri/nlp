This was good, but I agree with the folks who found the end result too sweet and too vinegary. Between the veal demiglace, morels and veal rib chops I used, I felt this was NOT a good use of expensive ingredients. I liked it okay, but for the effort and cost I would not make it again.

I first made this dish in 1995 when the magazine first published the recipe. I've made it probably 15-20 times since. The key is getting good veal stock and using good, aged balsamic vinegar. I also soak dried morels and add a little of the mushroom liquid. Once you have prepared it a few times you can make this much faster than what seems. I also put some dried thyme and oregano on the chops. I usually serve this with thyme, leak mashed potatoes and with steamed haricot verts that I then sautee with garlic and tarragon.

This is the second time I've made this. Loved it the first time and when making it for Christmas dinner thought it was just okay! The sauce didn't seem to have a ver robust flavor and I used the same stock as the first time. I didn't like the whole mushrooms (vs chopped) for serving. It looks good but doesn't serve well. Also, the veal could using a garlic rub or spices before grilling.

Absolutely worth the effort (albeit time consuming)! I tried this for a workday evening for my husband and I, and he agreed that this is a 10! Definitely a keeper for guests or a special occasion!

I've made this 4 times now and it's awesome. Would absolutely make it again and again.

I'm an Executive Chef in California and I had made this dish for many of my clients in catering, and I must say that I had nothing but rave reviews. The sauce makes the whole dish outstanding...My hats off to the creater.

The 4 forks are for the Morel Sauce which should have simply been included with the chop preparation - oh well! This recipe is fantastic and simple to prepare. The morel mushrooms "make it" so don't substitute. Definitely company worthy. I grilled the chops and didn't do the oven step. It wasn't necessary and didn't add anything.

THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE-MY HUSBAND GRILLED THE CHOPS & I PRPARED SAUCE. A BIT TIME CONSUMING BUT RESULTS WERE GREAT. USED 1/2 OZ DRIED MORELS & 1/2 OZ OF DRIED EXOTIC MUSHROOMS TO KEP PRICE DOWN NEXT TIME i'LL GO ALL MORELS

Dear Vancouver: When you see something on the Internet that's underlined, it most likely means that it's a link to something else. Just click on it, and it will take you to the recipe. Tell us how the sauce turns out.

Where is the recipe for the Morel Sauce? I agree with the previous reviewer anyone can grill veal chops, it's the morel sauce recipe I am interested in...

I served this for New Years eve and it was elegant. I could not find the morel mushrooms so I used portobello mushrooms.

The sauce was interesting and complex, but it was too overpowering for the veal chops. Perhaps as a sauce for grilled flank steak?

What a delightful change from morels in cream sauce. We were successful hunters this year so were able to make and freeze this sauce for special occasions.

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit. One guest even took some bread to sop up the sauce! I cheated a bit when making the sauce and used the Swiss Knorr Demi-Glaze, and also used regular button mushrooms as the morels were too expensive.

This recipe was fabulous- it was so easy- the sauce was great, and I liked how you could click on the Morel Sauce Recipe (in green) and have a separate file. Thanks!!

There is no recipe for the sauce. No ingredients, no instructions, nothing! Thanks, but I can grill meat on my own. What I need is the sauce!
