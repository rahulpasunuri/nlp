Definitely a nostalgic dish! These days I use panko and it comes out great.

To reply to the cook from NY- Joan Nathan says a "clasic Scnitzel" calls for butter (ie in Germany) but that ibn Israel it has been changed to just oil.

On what planet does classic Israeli schnitzel call for butter? That would be mixing dairy and meat, not a common practice even among the majority Israelis who don't keep Kosher. My traditional version has paprika as well, and salt, pepper, and a little gralic powder depending on your mood. Italian seasoned bread crumbs work well too. The flour makes the coating stick on better, for some reason, although I agree it's not a must.

Being a native Israeli, this is one of the things I ate most growing up, and make myself today. The common ish in Israel is chicken breast, and not turkey. Paprikka in the bread crumbs is a must, and the flour can definitely be skipped.

We make schnitzel all the time at my house - definately a nostalgia dish as when I grew up we ate schnitzel a couple times a week. I usually don't bother with the initial dip in flour and it turns out fine to my taste. Also nice with some sesame seeds mixed into the breadcrumbs.
