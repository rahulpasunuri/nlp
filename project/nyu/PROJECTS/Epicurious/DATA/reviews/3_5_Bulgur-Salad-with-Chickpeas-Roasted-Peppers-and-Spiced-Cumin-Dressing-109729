Very good. My changed: I added 1 cup of quartered cherry tomatoes and 2 chopped scallions, and I doubled the dressing ingredients except for the oil, which I left at 1/4 cup. I also made my own roasted red peppers, using 2 peppers that I charred on the stove using the gas flame. I also omitted the lettuce and pitas. My dinner guest and my partner were happy and my toddler asked for seconds--what more could you want?

Quick and easy to make, more importantly it is delicious. Serve with on the Bibb/Butter lettuce or inside of a pita pocket. Keep it heathly and omit the olive oil, or greatly reduce. Jazz it up and double the amount of diced roasted red peppers and double or triple the lemon juice. This is a keeper.

The dressing is amazing! I hate the beige-ness of the original recipe, though, so I use black beans instead of chickpeas. It's really good with quinoa (instead of bulgur) as well. I've found that the parsley isn't essential.

i made this tonight, subbing pan cooked green peppers for the roasted reds, and adding shallots. i ate with a garlic greek yogurt. i also used less oil in the dressing. i thought this was great, and would recommend.

I made this recipe exactly as described, and found it just so-so. Kind of bland. I would make it again, but with some additions. I'd double the dressing (except the olive oil) and toast the chickpeas in a dry pan for a few minutes before adding them to increase their nutty flavor. I'd also add more roasted red peppers, and perhaps some feta. I ate it as pita filling, and it was definitely tastier with the addition of the pita flavor than eaten alone by the forkful.

This recipe works equally well with couscous or quinoa. I broiled a sliced bell pepper and a sliced, seeded tomato instead of the jar variety--it only takes 5-10 minutes to roast nicely and the extra freshness is certainly worth it. I also tossed a handful of slivered almonds into the broiling pan for the last two minutes. The almonds add a nice crunch to the predominately soft texture of the dish. A splash of vinegar (red or white) also brings a little additional brightness to the dressing. An instant and easy favorite at my house!

The dressing has some kick to it - elevates what otherwise might be a pedestrian combination of bulgur and chickpeas. (Because the roasted red peppers from the jar aren't enough to do it for me. Maybe home-roasted...or as someone suggested, add artichoke hearts.) Also, I didn't use the fine bulgur, which might make a difference. I used a coarser Turkish bulgur, cooked in a rice cooker to chewy perfection.

Blech! This recipe was downright soupy and way too spicy. I couldn't serve it.

This was the first recipe I've made using bulgur, and in fact my first time eating it! I was surprised by how quickly the bulgur absorbed the water and in the end, I didn't even need to strain it as all of the water was absorbed. For this recipe I roasted my own peppers, added some sweet potato as I had one on hand and tripled (if not quadrupled) the total amount of vegetables. I can't imagine all that bulgur with only one cup of peppers! I served it in pita bread with hummus and it was absolutely delicious. The meal was incredibly easy and quick to prepare and will definitely find its way to my table again!

this was my first time making anything with bulgur, and it was such a delight! it's satisfying to make and doesn't take long. I'm using it as a pita filling for bag lunches. perfect!

Lovely to look at and went down just as nice. I added some r.onion and b.olives as well as using brown rice instead of bulgar (a gluten-free choice)...will be making it again very soon.

My first time experimenting with bulgur-- I think I used the wrong (coarse) kind b/c I had to cook it for longer than the recipe suggested to acheive the desired texture. Didn't have roasted peppers on hand so threw in some toasted pine nuts for extra flavor and texture-- delicious!

Easy, delicious, light... what more can you say? I boiled 1 1/4 C. bulgur w/2 1/2 c. water for about 30-35 min. instead of soaking. Liked the texture I came up with. Roasted my own pepper. Added quartered artichoke hearts. I gave the recipe to 5 people already, thats how good it is.

This was a great salad that was both light and delicious. It tasted even better after a few days.

Maybe I used too fine-grained bulgur, because I found this to be quite mushy. I might try it again with a courser grain, because it's easy enough and a good vegetarian protein source.

This recipe went over very well with my husband, who's a big mediterranean food fan. I didn't have cumin, so I used garam marsala instead which added a hint of cinnamon to it, not too bad. The only thing I'd change is adding a bit more olive oil in the end to juice it up (which I did the second day). Or if you turn them into pita sandwiches, a spread of hummus.

Although I was concerned that this salad might be bland, because it has only a few ingredients, I was definitely wrong. The dressing has a unique taste and makes the salad something special. I added a little more roasted red peppers than the recipe called for and doubled the dressing. I also added capers and sliced quartered marinated artichoke hearts -- very good! I absolutely loved the salad after that so I'll definitely be making it again. Would be great for a pot luck, company, lunch. It's a keeper!

This is a great basis for bulgur salad. You can add feta, olives, chickpeas to the basic recipe. Jack Bishop's book also has a similar salad with roasted zucchini and onions

This was absolutely delicious--the roasted red peppers really make it. The only thing I did differently was place the filling inside a half pita with the lettuce and tomatoes, seemed easier. I will definitely make this again,yum!

Really, really, really good. My first time experimenting with bulgur, it was an easy recipe with excellent results. I plan on making this again when my family comes to visit next month.

The recipe is excellent, the presentation ingenious. I was not clear what to do with the lettuce, and ended building little boats that my guests ate like lettuce wraps. We almost did not need the pita bread, (less carbs). I found the proportions of the spices to be a bit stingy, as the bulgur really grew when it hydrated. on the same amount of olive oil I doubled the cumin,lemon juice, roasted peppers and honey. as I said, I did not use all the bulgur, but about two thirds. finally, I sliced and added about 6 pitted black olives.

I thought this was incredible, I found myself craving this later too. It was great warm, it was great cold. My vegan father-in-law loved it too. This has now become a staple in my weekly diet! I only used a fraction of the oil and increased the cumin by half in the second recipe and it seemed better to me....but I adore cumin, so if you don't keep it less. MMMM!
