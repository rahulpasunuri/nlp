I made this last night, sort of as a last hurrah for summer. So easy and so delicious. I used fresh corn from the Farmer's Market, yellow and red grape tomatoes from my garden, fresh thyme instead of dried, and scallops from the local fish market. Amazing.

This is simple and quite good. I can see some need for a bit more flavor if you don't have good corn and tomatoes. I used pancetta, and that worked quite well. I might try adding some basil or oregano instead of thyme next time.

This was an exceptionally easy and tasty recipe. I think its success success may depend on the quality of the ingredients however. I used heirloom cherry tomatoes and fresh corn and scallions from the farmers market. The only changes that I made were that I used two slices of bacon and a pound of scallops. I also deglazed the pan with white wine and added some creole seasoning (I was cooking in a home with a very slim selection of herbs and spices). Happily, the creole seasoning turned out to be a perfect addition.

Made for the 1st time tonight with leftovers from the farmer's market and it was perfect. Served on baby greens dressed with olive oil, white wine vinegar, s&p. At end, I added a spoonful of Bumbel & Bumbel spread (margarine made with yougurt). It tasted so rich. The fresh produce made the meal. Great summer dish.

I liked the idea of this dish but was disappointed with the outcome. I found it too salty and the corn and tomatoes had little flavor. It looked great however.

This was yummy. After reading the reviews, I added some Creole seasoning to the scallops, deglazed the pan with some white wine after cooking the scallops and added a tablespoon of butter at the end. We had this with the sauteed spinach from this site.

incredibly tasty and easy to prepare. fresh corn adds excellent flavor.

One of my all time favorite summertime dishes! I make this often when my cherry tomatoes are in abundance. I also like to replace the scallops with shrimp when I can't find good scallops. A keeper that can't be beat!

This dish is a great combination of flavors and very easy/quick to make. Will definitely make again and may try with other vegetables(peppers?) in with corn and tomatoes.

Yummy summer dish! Easy and fresh. Omitted bacon (I'm a vegetarian), but found just olive oil (with minced garlic sauteed and then removed wasflavorful for searing scallops. Added a bit more garlic with scallions. Served over baby greens tossed with lemon and olive oil. Would try orzo next time. Served with Tomato and Onion Tart (on epicurious), which truthfully outshone the scallops. But, they were still great.

Great flavor and a no-brainer to prepare. I-who has limited kitchen skills-made it for my wife's birthday-who is a wiz in the kitchen-and she loved it. I added an extra slice of bacon, went easier on the salt since the bacon added enough and gave the corn a minute head start before tomatoes so they would'nt overcook-I hate mush. A few of the other reviews served with couscous. This is an excellent suggestion.

A wonderful, quick and easy dish perfect for a summer's evening. For such an simple dish, it has a lot of flavor and the colors of the tomatoes and corn make if very pretty. I served with couscous and a green salad.

TIP for using frozen scallops (or any frozen seafood - COOK IT FROZEN -- do NOT thaw, and it will hold its shape and texture. Really!) I stumbled across this looking for recipes for scallops - it sounded good and tastes even better! I've used fresh and frozen scallops and corn, and it always turns out delicious! Also be sure to use the cajun spice (great suggestion!) And degalzing with white wine makes a bit more sauce - it's so easy and SO good and really impressive to serve to guests.

I used bay scallops that had been frozen and I feel this was a big mistake. Despite thawing/draining and drying, when they hit the pan they released way too much water. Sadly, my scallops never browned. I used fresh corn and cherry tomatoes. The tomatoes, also, released a bit too much moisture. Upon returning the scallops to the pan, I had a overtly mushy mixture. It tasted wonderful, but the presentation was definitely lacking. My recommendations are to use large, fresh scallops if you can get them, and to perhaps consider whole cherry tomatoes so as to reduce the chance of recreating the moisture problem I had.

Since I first found this recipe a couple of years ago, we have made it numerous times. It's the only dish my husband ever suggests we make when people are coming over and even when they're not. Nice and easy too.

I really liked this recipe. The scallops were tender and the flavors of the corn and tomatoes were complementary. A definite "do again" dish.

I'm convinced I rated this recipe 3 forks due to my inclusion of reviewers' suggestions. Those I used were: minced garlic, deglazing pan with white wine, and dusting scallops with Cajun Seasoning along with the thyme. I added no salt (the amount seemed too much) until the corn and tomatoes were cooking. I used regular tomatoes cut to the size of cherry tomatoes, and increased the bacon to 2 slices. At the end I added a knob of unsalted butter to finish it off. We enjoyed these scallops very, very much. Guess I'll admit that I used vacuum-packed niblets white corn instead of fresh or frozen. Still delicious!

Yum! I used 2 pc. bacon & reserved half the drippings, with which I made a warm balsamic vin. Then plated the salad topped with the scallop mixture, served with wedges of broiled polenta. Make sure to use the best, freshest, preferably organic tomatoes & corn & enjoy!

I used whole chopped peeled tomatoes and also deglazed with wine and added garlic and dash of cayenne. Husband said (and I agreed) that this recipe was an example of the whole not being as good as the sum of its parts. There are lots of recipes I'd rather make using scallops.

Great recipe! My husband and daughter loved this. easy and quick to prepare - it had a lovely flavor - the bacon adds a great touch. I used shallots instead of scallions - tasted good. Easy clean up just enhances this recipe. I let scallops get really golden and a little crisp on outside. The corn and tomato mixture with bacon would also taste great on pasta with the scallops.

This was great. This was easy. I also followed the "deglaze-and-add-garlic-and-a-pinch-of-cayanne" method. Otherwise followed it to the letter. Also, use big, fresh scallops. Mmmmmm.

This was really fabulous and so easy to make. It's definitely a dish you could make any time of year with the ingredients on hand. We happened to have frozen scallops on hand and fresh corn, tomatoes and herbs in our garden. I used a few suggestions from other reviews, such as deglazing the pan with wine and adding garlic (the garlic was used to cook the scallops). We also added a wiff of cayenne at the end of the cooking. Instead of dry thyme I used fresh basil, but had fresh thyme on hand as well (fresh is always best / I keep some frozen too). Definitely a repeat dish. Oh, it would make a great main course for company, or a starter too. Truly faboo.

The best thing about this recipe was the ease of preparation. The finished product was just so-so. A splash of wine white, or knob of butter at the finish might have helped. Was alittle dry for my taste. Also tarragon in place of the thyme. A good dish for the kiddies.

Very nice, easy to prepare dish. I chose this recipe from the results of a "scallop" search because it sounded "fresh" and didn't use cream. The sweet corn and scallop paired nicely. Next time I would add garlic. I also liked a previous reviewer's idea of deglazing the pan with white wine.

I saved this recipe from Gourmet almost 7 years ago and shame on me for just now trying it. It was excellent, and so quick and easy. I served it over sauteed spinach. Also - used 2 pieces of bacon for a little extra flavor. A definite keeper, easy enough for a week night, delicious and attractive enough for company.

SOOOO good! Pretty easy to prepare as well. Added a little bit of sugar to the corn and tomato mixture and topped with the scallops. Everyone loved this...

A lovely little recipe - even tho I used Hormel bacon bits to make it slightly 'healthier' - I certainly had no complaints of greasiness! (I used a scant amount of olive oil with o.o. Pam to sear the scallops.) Very rich tasting, great combination of flavors - almost missed the thyme, not reading closely enough. And I agree, there is no sense to the large amount of salt called for. Just a quick dusting with s & p before you cook is fine.

I love this recipe, but have always used 1 Tbsp duck fat in place of bacon. Duck fat adds amazing flavor to scallops! This also has great color if you're interested in presentation. Also great as a first course.

This was a great weeknight dish - easy to prep and easy to cook. I used very fresh large scallops which made the dish superb. I am surprised other reviewers haven't mentioned the salt called for in the recipe. 3/4 tsp is way too much! I would use only 1/4 tsp in the future. I loved the bacon in the dish -- the flavor goes perfectly with scallops. Like some other reviewers I also served this with couscous, which was a great combination.

Rating: 2
It was good but not great, considering how precious scallops are. The flavors just didn't seem to "marry". I used giant scallops that were very fresh and fresh corn right off the cob and very sweet grape tomatoes- in other words, didn't stray from the recipe at all. Maybe I should have!

Rating: 3
This was quite good; however, I felt it was a little greasy. Next time, I'd pour off some of the bacon fat and not add oil before sauteing the veggies. We used frozen corn - fresh would be superior. Be careful not to overcook scallops. I tossed some baby greens in lemon juice and olive oil and place in center of plate with scallops surrounding. Made a nice presentation.

This dish is fantastic! I rolled each scallop in some cajun seasoning before searing. It made a delicious spicy crust on each one. Everyone who I have made this for has given rave reviews. Simple yet wonderful.

I've made this twice and love it. First time I followed recipe exactly and loved it. Second time I used fresh thyme (because I had it on hand) frozen corn and regular tomatoes chunked to the size of cherry tomatoes and it didn't change the end result. Next time I'll add another strip of bacon, because it was a wonderful surprise texture and flavor.

Absolutely amazed at how wonderful this dish tasted. Originally cooked for a guest who preferred seafood, but didn't like spicy dishes or creamy dishes, shheessh! Added some sauted garlic and served with couscous, yum!! Will definitely use fresh corn next time though.

I have to disagree with the non-stick. I used my cast-iron pan, with minimal oil. The trick is to have the heat high enough so that they form a crust rather quickly, then they flip easily. I loved the flavors. I did omit the bacon and used basil instead of thyme. The other thing I did was to add about 1/2 cup of white wine to the pan after the onion, before the corn and tomato. I covered it and let it steam. The wine reduced, mixed with the juice from the tomato. Ahhh. Delicious. Thank you for the inspiration.

Rating: 3
A tip - You MUST use a non stick skillet. I only had a well seasoned cast iron skillet and the scallops stuck necessitating the addition of more oil which made the dish come out a bit heavy. Note to self: GO SHOPPING!

This is my second favorite recipe that I've found on epicurious! I found this very easy, incredibly tasty, relatively healthy and just generally perfect. I served the scallops in a circle around a timbale of saffron rice with the corn and tomatoes sprinkled on top. My fiance said it would be his favorite dish if he had this in a restaurant. The key is big, fresh scallops and fresh vegetables. I will make this again and again, and never tell any guests how easy it is.

We almost passed this recipe by because it sounded so ordinary. It's anything but! The flavors blend incredibly well for a delicious dish. I cut the salt to ½ teaspoon and used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. All we needed to complete the meal was some sourdough garlic toast, a green salad, and a nice chardonnay. This is a keeper, and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.

made this recipe for two people. it was easy and delicious, but i found that you could cut down on the amount of corn (only 1 cup was really needed, not two ears) and add a little zucchini for color and flavor. would definately make again.

This receipe was very easy both to prepare and to cook. I served it with a timbale of couscous in the center of the plate with the scallops around the edges. I would definatley serve this dish for a dinner party or casual get together with friends. It is sure to impress!
