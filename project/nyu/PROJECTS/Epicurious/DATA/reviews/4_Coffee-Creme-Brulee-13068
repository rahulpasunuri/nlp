It was very easy to make although I skipped the "brulee" part. It was good without it!

An excellent recipe. Easy Prep and great taste. A family favorite in our house. In answer to the reviewer who asked about preparing in a larger dish... I have done this several times for dessert buffets and it's worked fine.

A great brulee recipe that I use for the basis of most of my other falvoured brulees. I used fresh ground espresso, which doesn't dissolve as easily, but leaves a delicious coffee syrup as a nice surprise at the bottom of the ramekin. Mmmmmm!

The recipe is wonderful but for future reference has anyone tried serving it in a larger dish for a crowd? like a 9x12 ceramic pan cooked in a larger water bath???

My favorite creme brulee recipe so far. Great dessert to make ahead for dinner parties-it's easy and never fails to impress the guests.

To die for. As previous reviewers suggested, I doubled the espresso to 3 Tbsp., but otherwise made as written. My first attempt at creme brulee, but very simple to make.

This recipe is failsafe - I have made it many times and it's flawless. Perfect light finish to any meal.

Wow, this was so wonderful!! I had no idea creme brulee was so easy to make! I served it slightly warm and loved it like that! I will definitely make this again and again!

This was okay. It doesn't compare to regular creme brulee.

Absolutely sinful!!! I've made this recipe several times for parties, and it is always a hit. I add 1/4 tsp cornstarch to the Kalhua-espresso powder mixture, and it seems to thicken up the brulee just a touch. I can't recommend this recipe enough.

I never realized creme brulee was so easy to make! My company loved it. For a change sometimes I put in some pieces of Belgian chocolate right before baking. Adds a little surprise, and what goes better with coffee than chocolate?

my hubby and i found this recipe delicious and easy to make. we substituted the expresso powder for freshly grinded and brewed puertorican gourmet coffee. definitely i'll be treating our friends at our next dinner party with this dessert.

Easy and delicious - this was my first creme brulee, and it was perfect. My fiance's mother actually LICKED the ramekin. On my second try, I skipped the Kahlue and espresso powder, substituting pure maple syrup and maple extract. Also delicious!

This was my first time to make creme brulee. This recipe was very easy to make and the outcome was excellent! I served it with a couple of chocolate covered almonds and mocha coffee beans on top. I will definately be making it again!

This was the first time I ever tried making creme brulee. This was soooo good. I also went heavier on the coffee. it was our millineum dessert!

This was my first attempt at a creme brulee and it was simple and it tasted delicious! Following the advice of previous reviews, I omitted the sugar on top. I added 3 ounces of bittersweet chocolate to the warm milk mixture which added a wonderful mocha flavor.

A cross between an elegant dessert and comfort food- I served this warm, without chilling for four hours, and it was delicious. Doubling the espresso powder gave it a nice extra hit. Yum!
