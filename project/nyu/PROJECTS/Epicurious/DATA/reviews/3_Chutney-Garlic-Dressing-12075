This dressing would have got a 4 star, but I had to modify it a bit. I cut the recipe in half...added 1 more garlic...added 1/4 tsp curry powder, salt and pepper. This has the consistency as a salad dressing...not a chutney. As I make my own chutney, I will use this again and again!

This was delicious as dressing for not just a tossed green salad but also for tabbouli (sp?); to jazz it up a bit add more red chili peppers or even curry powder.

Sorry, I wasn't wild about this. It was Too runny to serve with meat. It would be better just to use straight chutney for that purpose. The consistency was right for salad but it was too bland.

I used this as a sauce for pork loin roast. Perfect!!! I should try it on a salad as expected but it was SOOOO good on the meat.

Omitted pepper flakes due to family. Used 1/2 veg. oil & 1/2 olive oil. Dressed spinach. Excellent! Had small portion leftover, and it was still very good second day, which is a bonus if saving for a snack/lunch. Will try salad with cooked chicken/turkey next as a more substantial salad (if summer gets here).
