I tripled the amount of spices used since the original recipe was pretty bland. I also substituted fresh green beans instead of zuchinni since I already had those on hand. A touch of honey for sweetness and then I let it mature overnight in the fridge to allow the potatoes to absorb the flavors. It turned out to be a pretty good dish.

I made this recipe as is to start, just omitting saffron, tumeric and raisins. I doubled the seasonings as suggested by other reviewers. It was very one note and I was very disappointed. The flavor was kinda weird. I added a shot of lemon, about 2 T of sliced green olives and its much better. The review is for the original recipe before I made the additions. with the additions its a three.

This was ok. I was expecting more depth in the flavor, but it was sort of one note. I added a bit of honey to add some sweetness, which helped the flavor, but it was still missing something. I may experiment with it if I have some free time, but otherwise I'll find another stew recipe.

I thought this recipe was a great starting point. I mixed up the ingredients a lot: parsnips and more carrots, fresh grated ginger, four cloves of garlic, and a mix of multi-colored fingerling potatoes with one very large sweet potato. I abhor zucchini, so I omitted that, and used canned, no-salt tomatoes. I also cooked this in the slow-cooker, so I increased the liquid and used a LOT more of the spices. I also increased the raisins to about 1/2 cup. I really like the unique flavor of the fennel in this dish. It definitely helps the soup to stand out among all the other crock-pot soups and roasts that I make.

Quite tasty even for a meatlover. I added lots more cumin, chili powder, and some hot sauce. When I substituted yams for the potatoes, I found it took quite a long time (1 or 2 hours) to get them super soft and not tough.

Frankly, I don't think this recipe would be worth the effort in preparation (tomatoes and potatoes- i hate peeling potatoes!) if I followed it exactly. I used whole canned potatoes, then diced them. I also used Ro-tel diced tomatoes with chilies. I added 2 tbsp rice vinegar at the end and served over Near East roasted garlic & olive oil whole wheat couscous. It was tasty, but I'm glad I didn't bother with boiling and peeling tomatoes for it!

this was a fantastic vegetarian meal. it would have been four stars except that I did have to alter the spices and the technique a bit. as noted by past reviewers, it is necessary to double the cumin, ginger and tumeric. i did not use saffron as i don't care for the flavor. i also used ground cinnamon instead of a stick. finally, the recipe needed cayenne (and salt which is not mentioned anywhere!) be careful not to overcook the potatoes

This turned out in the end but I more than doubled the recommended seasoning and added cayenne pepper and chile powder to get some real flavor. I also used sweet potatoes rather than regular and they went well. I made it earlier in the day except for the beans, zucchini and tomatoes and the liquid was absorbed leaving it dry. I had to add quite a bit more liquid so I would recommend that you make it right before serving.

This is a really lovely meal in a pot with lots of layers of flavor. I, like past reviewers, doubled the spices (omitted the saffron) and increased the amount of raisins and zucchini. I also seasoned with salt and pepper throughout which I think is critical to making this dish flavorful. Served over rice, this was the vegetarian meal my family had for Christmas eve dinner........a real winner!

For those that think the original recipe is missing something, adding 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper also helps. I also agree that it's better to cut the potatoes small and to add them earlier in the process.

A good solid vegetarian dinner. I found the original a bit bland - so I double the spices and it's great.

I'd agree with other readers that this dish needs more flavor. I'd make it again with smaller pieces of potato added earlier in the cooking process and doubling the spices.

This is a wonderful recipe. Not too hard to make and exotically delicious! I doubled the raisins and added the spices generously and ended up with a super dish. I'll be making this again often. Thank you, Epicurious, for this one!

I've made this a couple of times. I'm always on the lookout for new cooked veggie mixtures. This one is good. I do jazz it up a bit though with either a bit of lemon juice or vinegar.

We found this recipe to be rather bland. I actually ended up adding a package of Thai sweet-and-tangy spice mix to it because it was so tasteless. Not a very exciting recipe.

Easy to make and delicious vegetarian entry

I served this dish at an African theme party I had and it was the favorite of everyone. I didn't have any saffron and wasn't willing to pay for it, so I left it out. Since it was the favorite, I guess no one minded. It was a little starchy for me, with the potatoes and garbanzo beans.

A great recipe for a novice cook recently retired and previously untried in the kitchen. Very substantial and flavorful vegetarian main course.
