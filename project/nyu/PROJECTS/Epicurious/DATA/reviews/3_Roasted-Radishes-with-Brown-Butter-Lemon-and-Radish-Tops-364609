We've several times roasted radishes with duck, where they soak up that great flavor. And also used radishes in a Spanish-style omelet instead of potatoes, with and without greens (the pricklies go away). But never thought of just preparing them like this, which also turned out well. I did use rendered chicken fat instead of olive oil for the roasting and so skipped the butter, just squeezed a lemon over - probably more like 2T than 1t.

What a great way to make radishes more mild! I had too many in my CSA box and this is a great way to use them. I didn't even put the radish greens. Next time I would use less butter.

Novel way to prepare radishes and extremely easy. I do not care for fresh radishes, but have prepared this recipe twice. The first time exactly as written and the second time I sprinkled some seasoned rice wine vinegar over all and like it better. I will make these again to surprise guests.

This was great fun, and just something different. I got too much salt, but will cook again. Did not have radish tops available, but worked with plain supermarket bagged radishes.

This was excellent! I made it exactly as written and was very impressed with the subtle flavors at play. I would definitely make this again as an accompaniment to a meat dish.

Not my favorite. I generally love fresh radishes, therefore I was really looking forward to tasting them roasted. Kind of a letdown. Followed the recipe exactly.

I love radishes but I never had them roastes, my favorite combination is radish with mackerel 8/10 radishes 3 tbsp. of olive oil 5 salad tomatoes (cut in wedges) 1 tbsp. or red wine vinegar half cucumber 1 garlic clove (crushed) Plus 120g toasted bread that you can grill with the mackerel and then cut the bread in chunks. 1.Combine the olive, vinegar and garlic, whisk them. 2.In a salad bowl (quite big) put in the tomatoes and season with abundant black pepper, add the cucumber and radishes and pour over the vinaigrette. Marinate for 30 min. 3.When the fish cool down remove the skin of your grill mackerel and flake the flesh and when the marinating time is finish mix in the mackerel flesh in the bowl and add the crunchy bread. 4. Serve and enjoy! http://kitchenvoyage.blogspot.com/p/waitrose-recipes.html

Aint it pretty? That's as far as that goes. I was so looking foreward to the changeling aspect of preparing a radish this way. The result was foul, we all tried two or three pieces and no one could get their heads around to liking this. Interesting? You bet. Tasty? Not so much.

Fantastic recipe. We couldn't stop eating them. The radish tops make the dish -- bright flavors and a totally different taste than you'd expect. Amazing taste and amazingly simple. Great with roasted meat dish (I served it for Easter dinner with lamb).

Granted, I didn't have the radish greens, but still.... this recipe was boring. It does change the flavor of the radishes, but it mellows them to the point of blandness. I'd rather use all that butter for something with more complexity.

Amazing! I never would've thought of roasting radishes, let alone eating the tops. A huge hit for Easter dinner!

Nice and simple recipe, and since I have so many radishes coming in right now, I was scrambling to find a recipe to make use of them before they split in the ground. I roasted them in the oven, and then squeezed the lemon over them and sea salt. Skipped the browned butter part--there was enough oil left on my baking pan to toss them around a bit and they were plenty coated. I have to say though, that something was missing...some cumin perhaps? Don't know, but if you try this, be creative and let us know what you did to bring forth a complimenting flavor! Ah, maybe the problem was that I didn't bother with the radish tops. I just didn't think the tongue would be comfortable with those prickly leaves.

I made these exactly as written and I thought they tasted just like potatoes. Awesome recipe to make again and again.

Husband really enjoyed the roasted radishes. Need a different vegetable for our menu and this was it. No confusion in recipe. The butter is browned and then lemon added, then drizzled over roasted radishes, and then tops are sprinkled on top as you would parsley. New taste treat.

A line appears to be missing from this recipe mid-way through. Is it simply to add butter to the skillet to make the brown butter, or are you meant to saute the radish tops?
