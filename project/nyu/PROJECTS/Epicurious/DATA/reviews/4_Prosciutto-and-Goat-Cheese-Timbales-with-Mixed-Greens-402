Everyone loved this for a first course. Definitely make smaller timbales, they were huge! Also added a tablespoon of alfalfa star honey to the dressing to cut the acidity when paired with a mixed herb green. Perfect!

Everyone raved. I made 8 timbales as some reviewers said they were too big. It was perfect. I am going to add green beans to my salads from now on! I used an herb salad mix. I didn't notice the cream cheese so I guess it's just for creaminess, but I think you could do without it. As suggested I put them in the freezer to set, only for a couple of hours, rather than in the fridge overnight.

Super good. As suggested I popped them in the freezer for a couple of hours instead of in the fridge overnight to set up. Also due to some saying they were too big I made 8 instead of 6. It was perfect. The salad is very good but you could serve these timbales over many salads.

Easy, crowd pleasing, light. I too used the orange Muscat champagne vinegar from Trader Joe's--perfect.

I have been making this to rave reviews since 1995 when I saw it in my Bon Appetit magazine. I am so thrilled to see it in this year's Easter suggestions. It can be made with a smaller timbale as it is filling. It is great with a healthy amount of cracked pepper in the goat cheese mixture. I have also done the timabale the same day and popped in the freezer to set.

Fantastic! And very easy to make. I didn't have the right size ramekins so I used a muffin pan which worked fine. The only modifcation I made was to use Orange Muscat Champagne vinegar from Trader Joe's for the dressing. Worked great -- I got rave reviews.

This was the perfect lunch for Christmas Day since it was light and can be made the day before. Two notes: use thicker, rather than thinner prosciutto so it won't tear. And smaller rather than larger timbale molds seem big enough since this is so rich. Next time I might substitute a bleu cheese, like a Saga, for the goat cheese. And I used very fresh ricotta for the cream cheese, since that's what I had. It was great! The haricots really make this dish.

You really have to like goat cheese. I made these for Easter brunch 2002. I thought the timbales were great, although my partner isn't too fond of strong cheeses. After the first taste of the timbale (pungent), the rest was mellow. I've made this recipe several times since then, and I've altered the cheese to 8oz cream cheese and 4oz goat cheese. It still has the tang, but it's not so powerful.

This is a fabulous dish that always gets rave reviews from my house. The only thing I have changed is I made the timbale smaller so as not to overpower the greens with a huge mound of goat cheese...like the size of a muffin tin instead of a ramekin. Otherwise this is GREAT!

Outstanding. I've made this twice and the guests asked for the recipe. So simple and do-ahead. I guess I used about 4 oz. ramekins and these were a nice size.

I made this for Easter 2001. The presentation was impressive, and the recipe was fairly easy to make - I made the timables the day before. A tip: It seemed like the timbales were too big - like the flavor and amount of the cheese & proscuitto overwhelmed the greens & dressing...maybe smaller timbales might be better.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch as the first course. Wow!! The prentation is impressive and the taste is amazing. The hardest part is doing the ramekins. I might add a little more cream cheese next time just to make it a little more - creamy.

Terrific! Beautiful presentation, perfect for guests. My most requested recipe. Usually I don't bother with the dressing and just use red wine and oil.
