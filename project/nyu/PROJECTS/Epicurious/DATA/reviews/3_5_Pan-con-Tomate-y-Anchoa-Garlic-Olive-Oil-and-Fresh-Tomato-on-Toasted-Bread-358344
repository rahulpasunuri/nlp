Very simple, but very good. I used sourdough baguettes that I had baked just that day and toasted for a dinner party, then I toasted the remainder to take to work the next day. I came back in about an hour and they had eaten four baguettes...the receptionist described a feeding frenzy! I even used more garlic than called, as I wasn't sure if my cloves were "large" enough. Great appetizer, and grating the tomato wasn't near as intimidating as it sounds; I didn't have access to plum tomatoes, so I used small tomatoes on the vine which meant there was a "bit" more liquid, which really couldn't be poured off as it was pretty much all tomato! Simple and good; a great combination for last minute appetizers!
