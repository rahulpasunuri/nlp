As a Frenh Cook who misses "creme renversee" this a great substitute for the Holidays. I'll make it every year to come. For me this is better than pumpkin or pecan pies

Excellent...it's not "blow you away" outstanding, but it is a lovely dessert, and I got great comments on it. One thing I noticed is that this is not the first recipe that underestimates the amount of puree you can get from a sweet potato; unless you get a one pound potato you're going to be like me and have a very scant one cup, especially, if you exclude the tougher part of the potato right next to the skin. It was a fairly easy recipe, though, and it came out great. A nice variation on a quite-frequently hackneyed dessert!

this is two sweet for my palatte, but my husband loved it--he loves sweet things. Granted, it was the first time a flan turned out right for me. I want to try other flans now.

I loved this recipe! I've always loved flan, so when I saw this I thought I'd give it a shot. I use a white-skinned sweet potato instead of the red and WOW. My family loved it and I ate it for breakfast. I would totally make this again.

this was an ok dessert, my family gave it mixed reviews. i don't know if the slightly tricky recipe is worth the fairly bland flavor

I'm not that big of a custard fan, but this flan is wonderful. Perhaps because it was near Thanksgiving that I first made this, I decided to add 1/4 tsp. of allspice to the flan. I also think it would go well with a fruit compote of some sort.

I made this last week and it was delicious - definitely a recipe that I'll make again. One note on the recipe - the recipe says to bake the custard for about an hour. Mine was finished after 45 minutes so it's good to check early to make sure it doesn't get overcooked.

Excellent. Everybody liked it,

Made this for a friend's birthday. It was great, even though the sweet potato I had was a bit starchy, and I was too slow coating the pan with the caramel (i.e. it hardened before I could coat the whole bottom). Will definitely make again.
