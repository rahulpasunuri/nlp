This is quick to prepare on a week night, but was met with no enthusiasm from my family. Perhaps if it was spicier? Or made a day ahead and the flavors melded before added the rabe to the dish.

A definite hit with my family!I have made it several times, sometimes using Italian turkey or chicken sausage and substituting broccolini(a cross between asparagus and broccoli). I also saute some red or green peppers and onions with the sausage. A tasty and hardy dish!

Made this dish for the first time on a night when an ice storm was keeping us inside. Our little town's (pop. 2300)grocery store mgr.s don't know what polenta and broccoli rabe are, so I've become accustommed to making polenta myself (use it instead of grits in my "shrimp and grits" recipe) and I substituted savoy cabbage for the broccoli rabe. It was a hit! My daughter, son-in-law and 21/2 yr. old. granddaughter were with us and even my sweet Sara, who eats nothing but peanut butter sandwiches, ate the the sausges and polenta! This recipe goes into my "comfort food file" and definitely is casual company fare, too. I made enough to have leftovers tonight and will saute the polenta this time....can hardly wait!!

I used latinato kale instead of broccoli rapi, but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely (a bit more sausage, a bit more garlic) and it fed three of us very happily. Really good quick, family dinner. I'd never mashed up that polenta roll before, and it's GOOD that way!

To cut some calories I used italian turkey (hot ) sausage and used oile oil spray in nonstick skillet and only and small amout of olive oil.

To the cook in Michigan. You made a totally different recipe (and I tried yours and loved it too). That's what recipes are really for. They are simply rough guides to be altered and enhanced. Great job. Try it with grilled veggies for a vegetarian treat I am sure.

What an easy recipe! I doubled the recipe and took advice from a previous review. I grilled some spicy chicken italian sausage, a few chicken breasts, red onion & bell pepper. Sliced everything up and served it on a bed of polenta with a side of sauteed baby spinach with garlic. (10 ounce bag of spinach) I offered my guests grated parmesan cheese and marinara sauce on the side. No compliants here!

Hey cook from NY: We're talkin' Italian sausage here! If you want gourmet, go make Beef Wellington or something. It's that kind of elitist attitude that scares people away from trying cooking more. Anyway, I loved this recipe. It's easy enough to put together for a weeknight meal, even with the extra step of grilling the sausage, which makes it even better, in my opinion. I also grilled some red peppers and onions which made for an expansive (not expensive) meal that I'd normally not have on a Wednesday night. Added some fresh rosemary and lots of cracked black pepper to the finished polenta. It was my first experience with broccoli rabe and I loved it. Served the whole spread with a Rioja from Spain that was fruity and just big enough to stand up to the robust flavors. I think a nice Dolcetto would also work well if you want to keep everything Italian. Do yourself a favor and crank up some Sinatra on the patio and just take a break from the week with this dinner. The Italians have a term called "sprezzatura" which loosely translates as spontaneity, expressiveness or an easy, unselfconscious display of virtuosity. This food has it, and on a warm summer night, I'll take that over gourmet any time.

While this recipe was okay, I didn't feel it was all that extraordinary. It just seemed like something someone had thrown together, rather than a gourmet meal.

I diverged a bit from the recipe. Cooked 6 slices of bacon first. In another pan, cooked the sausage. I used 1 tbsp of the bacon grease to cook the broccoli rabe, plus added lots of garlic. Cooked the polenta in 1 tbsp of bacon grease, and added the bacon, crumbled. The entire dish was DELISH. If you decide to use bacon in this dish, do not add any salt. The bacon and bacon grease provides plenty.

The rabe definitely needs to be cut up. The sausage took about 30 minutes to cook, but all and all, the recipe was a hit!

I made this last night and it was delicious. I couldn't find broccoli rabe, so I used kale.

I enjoyed this dish. More to the point, my toddler LOVED the polenta and the sausage. Next time, I'll probably make this dish using spinach -- the rape was too bitter for tender young tastebuds.
