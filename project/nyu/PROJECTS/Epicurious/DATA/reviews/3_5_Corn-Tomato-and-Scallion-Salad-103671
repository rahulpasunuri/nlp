wonderful dish that needs to 'sit' for at least an hour for flavors to settle in. White balsamic will not dull the yellow corn, or the herbs...which are key...lots of fresh basil and flat leaf parsley. I add the tomato last or leave it out. Add a tiny bit of sugar as you saute the corn if it lacks natural sweetness.

I love this recipe just as it is. One tip is to make sure you use a heavy pan such as cast iron and get it quiet hot. Then when the balsamic is added to the corn and stirred around it quickly disappears and leaves a wonderful caramel glaze on the corn.

There are better, fresher corn/tomato salad recipes out there. This one is only so so. If I made this again, I would use white balsamic vinegar because regular balsamic made the corn a bit brown and ugly.

Extremely good with fresh corn, especially if you use a very hot cast iron pan to brown it.

Even though I didn't have any scallions on hand and I used grape tomatoes, this recipe was wonderful! I will make it again and add the scallions. The corn was so sweet and the tomatoes added a nice acid balance.

I have made this twice now and enjoyed it both times. The second time I added chopped shallots with the garlic and I liked the flavor. I can imagine adding many other things such as chopped peppers. Excellent over rice.

I've made this several times & love it. I add some cucumber, feta, & fresh lemon juice to mine.

If you want to kick this up a bit, read the recipe for the Black Bean Tart with Chili Crust. It packs a punch and is very, very similar to this.

The fresh taste of sweet corn just off the cob really makes this dish. I added a splash of red wine vinegar - the balsamic along with the corn was a bit too sweet for me and I didn't want to add more salt. Very popular picnic dish. Also served it as a plated starter next to mixed greens drizzled with homemade buttermilk dressing.

Wow, this was easy to make and smelled so good cooking. Tasted pretty good hot and warm, but it's even better cold the next day! The flavors have all blended, and the tomatoes are like bursts of sugar. Great paired with a spicy chicken mole!

This was a great way to use leftover fresh corn. My husbands' only suggestion was that he would like it "kicked up a notch".

Awesome. This recipe is fantastic. Never any left overs. It is great warm or cold or even the next day.

This is a wonderful melange of flavours to be enjoyed hot or cold, if it can last past the pan it's fried in. Terrific even without the tomatoes. I experimented with different balsamic vinegars with great success. Everybody loved it.

I really liked this recipe. Easy and it was a great hit with all of my guests. I used limes and cliantro as the ingrediants included in all my dishes. This was a great compliment to Pork Country BBQ ribs, my sweet potatoes with Cilantro/Lime dressing and the lemon slaw (all found here!). I will definitely make this for another picnic!

Followed this recipe exactly and everyone loved it. I braced myself for the "brownish hue" mentioned by previous reviewers, but found the overall color of the salad virtually unaffected by the balsamic; next time I think I'll try adding just a bit more since I'm a vinegar addict! Great flavor combination and tasted even better after cooling in the refrigerator for a few hours.

I thought this was really tasty. I read what the other cook meant about the funny brownish color due to the balsamic vinegar, but since I'm a huge balsamic vinegar fan, I decided to brave it anyway. So yes, it was a little brown, but i thought the flavor was excellent. I didn't have any scallions; I used a lot of chopped yellow onion. And i used a lot of garlic, as well. I also added fresh basil leaves which I think is a must. Served it in bibb lettuce bedded in mixed greens wih balsamic vinegar and basil garnish. Yum. The corn had a lovely, sweet flavor to counter the vinegar (which I love anyway). Will definitely make again.

This is a great summer salad. I took the advice of one comment and used white balsamic vinegar to enhance the appearance of it!

Although I like the concept, this was not as good as I thought it would be. I made for 4th of July BBQ as one of several sides. As another person noted, the use of the balsamic vinegar gave the beautiful colors of the individual elements an unattractive brown cast. I also didn't like adding the tomatoes to the hot mixture. Next time I will try another vinegar and cool the corn mixture before adding the tomatoes and green onions.

It was nice. My guests enjoyed it. It seemed however to miss something? The balsamic vinegar dulled the bright contrasting colors of the corn, tomatoes and scallions. It was different.

This recipe is so excellent, tasty, good-looking, and easy! I am already dreaming of summer corn (but not a necessity to enjoy this lovely dish!) It's fantastic hot or chilled. I've served with with fish and chicken, although it's so versatile and tasty it would be wonderful with anything!

This is a great side dish for just about any cuisine. It's really quick, especially if you use frozen corn, which tastes almost as good as fresh.

I have made this several time since the issue arrived on the scene this summer. It looks beautiful and tastes great. Make sure to add enough balsamic and slat and pepper. I highly recommend it as a side dish with Mexican food!

This was easy to make and good especially in the hot summer. I used good balsamic vinegar and i'm sure that would make a difference. I also added about 1/4 c. of chopped fresh basil which I usually add to everything! Nice with chicken.

An excellent summer dish. I served this one hot with a side or cheddar and chive scones. Also, I added dried oregano which really spiced up the dish. Salkt and pepper to taste also, of course. Overall, highly reccomended.
