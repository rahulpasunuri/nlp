This was the first time I have ever created something totally inedible in my kitchen. The odor stayed around a week after the relish hit the garbage can!

Great, my only regret is I do not have enough green tomatoes to make more relish. It is consumed too fast as a meat sauce

The recipe is easy to make and called for no exotic spices nor herbs. The flavor is mild, in fact, too mild. I suggest the recipe call for zippy onions [I used part Bermuda and part white onions. Next time I will use all white or another zippy onion, if available.] White pepper could also be added, or more cloves in the spice bag. The relish needs to be stirred frequently while cooking to keep the spice bag from floating. Use Note:If 1 tablespoon dill weed is added to 1/2 pint of relish and mixed with mayonnaise, it makes good fish sauce.
