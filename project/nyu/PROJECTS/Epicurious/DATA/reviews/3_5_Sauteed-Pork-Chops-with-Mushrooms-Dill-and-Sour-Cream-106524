Weird recipe. I had some dill to use up and my budget didn't allow for salmon this week, so I tried this. Frankly, this sauce doesn't match well with pork chops. It might be better with chicken, but it really isn't very flavorful in any event, and I say that after having taken Melissao11's suggestions in her 6/17/10 comment. I reckon that as printed, this recipe would be downright bland.

Here is the missing link...season pork w/pepper (no salt), a little garlic powder & cumin, and a very very little powdered clove. Deglaze with white wine, cook onion & mushroon, add double amnt of sour cream and fresh dill & splash with a tad more white wine, add pork back w/juices to warm. Serve with mushroom & spinach risotto w/fresh chopped parsley and a butter/basil carrot side...yummmm! :)

Used double the amount of mushrooms and chicken stock instead of water. I don't even like pork and this was AMAZING.

I switched it up a little bit with shallots for onions, a little white wine and chicken broth instead of water, and all we had was dried dill. It was so rich and delicious. I will absolutely make this again. And again.

My husband loved this and has already asked for me to make it again. I was also able to make it under 30 min. Which makes it a great meal for the work/school week.

This was excellent! I used 2 1-inch thick chops, but kept the sauce amounts the same. I'm a fiddler, so I subbed fresh shiitakes and added a bit of cognac to the onions and mushrooms. I also used Parisian Bonnes Herbes instead of dill. Served with a turnip and potato garlic mash. Awesome on a cold, rainy night--my bf was very happy.

After reading many reviews I added about 4 large cloves of garlic and shallots instead of onion. I also used chicken stock, and doubled the sauce adding sherry to it. I thought it was very good with these changed. I will make this again, and will try it with chicken. Also floured the chops.

Fast and easy - my husband makes this for our family. He pounds chops to tenderize and used shallots instead of onions. Dried dill works great. Served with garlic mashed potates and green beans. YUM!!!

Very yummy dish! I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it! I used dried dill weed to taste (as I did not have fresh on hand) and it was delicious!

I followed several of the reccomendations of others and floured the pork first, used chicken stock and doubled the sauce and this came out ok. The sauce when tasted from the pan was delicious but almost seemed to lose some of the flavor when eaten with the pork. I served over cous cous with pine nuts and I added the pork back to the sauce for about 3 minutes to heat it up again and get it nice and coated. It was good overall but my boyfriend and I both agreed that it was missing something, we just couldn't put our finger on it. I think next time I will add garlic and maybe some beaumonde seasoning and see if that helps.

As written, I thought the recipe was just ok. It was so easy that I tried it again with a few simple changes and liked it much better. Substituted chicken stock for the water, parsely for the dill, and added garlic. Sometimes I flour the chops before sauteing, and this adds a lot of flavor.

Used the suggestions to add garlic and white wine. Kinda bland, and my I know now my husband hates anything with dill in it. Only make this if you like dill.

I made this last night with Vidalia onions and bone-in center cut chops and thought it was excellent. The chops took a little longer because they were thicker. The 1/4 cup of water made the sauce a bit thinner than I'd like, perhaps because I used nonfat sour cream. It's a keeper, but the next time I will use low fat sour cream and perhaps substitute wine for the water, adding it until it reaches the desired consistency.

We loved this recipe, with a little variation. I used marsala wine (we were running low on the pinot grigio that we were drinking, LOL). I did think that it would have been perfect for a dinner party, and you can't get much easier to prepare and cook than this.

My family loved this recipe. I made some changes, I grilled the chops on my George Foreman grill, and I used the drippings from the chops and added them to the onions and canned portabella mushrooms. I also used white wine instead of the water. I used only 1 tbs. of dill and added some fresh lemon thyme and some roasted garlic. It tasted great!!!!

I tried this recipe and thought it was boring. I much preferred a cooking light recipe with mushroom whiskey and flour.

I made several changes based on what I had around the house. I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, and used dried rosemary and sage instead of dill (didn't have any). Like many others, I added a clove of garlic and used a dry white wine instead of water. Quite tasty and delightfully simple.

Yum, yum, yum! Used light sour cream, otherwise cooked as written. Served with pasta as the dish reminds me of beef stroganoff, another favorite. A tatsy, satisfying dish! Will make again.

Yum! This recipe is incredibly good! I have made this recipe with both pork and chicken (rosemary instead of dill)and both work very well. It is so good, that I always double the sauce as we cannot get enough. Have made recipe with both fresh herbs and dried and while fresh is always better, I never hesitate to make it when I do not have fresh! Also, used wine instead of water - thanks to reviewers! - and love the taste! It is beyond compare when made with wine. What more can be said - quick, easy, and incredibly delish!

It doesn't get much easier than this. I used pork chops with the bone, creme fraiche, shallots, and white wine (instead of sour cream, onion, and water). Everything worked out perfectly and the sauce was delicious. I don't know that it's an impressive dinner party recipe, but I would certainly make it for casual guests. Give it a try - it's too easy not to.

Rating: 3
I, too, suspected that the sauce might be a little bland. I prepared the recipe as is and the sauce was not bland at all. I think one of the keys is adding back in the juice from the resting meat. However, I decided to add a little more flavor and added a pinch of dried lemon peel, garlic, and chives to the dill. Delicious.

It's been a while since I'd done pork chops, and being a huge dill fan, this recipe intrigued me. It is so simple to make and delicious. The only changes that I made were using canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh at the time as well as dried dill and using low fat sour cream. It's a perfect week night meal!

Rating: 3
We aren't easily impressed, but found this to be good and simple to make. Only had canned mushrooms. The 7 oz can, mushrooms and juice went in, in lieu of the water. Used one heaping teaspoon of dried dill. This sauce went well with the red potatoes I roasted. And, why would anyone cook these chops one hour, as a previous reviewer did?????This is not meant to be pork jerky. Tricanosis (sp) is no longer a threat. Three to 4 minutes for a thin chop is plenty. Good stuff.

I like my pork cooked very well, so I let it simmer for about 1hr with the dill sprinkled over it while it simmers. I cook the onions sliced over the pork chops, which gives them more flavor. Then remove to a platter. Saute mushrooms in the butter and stir in sour cream and simmer for about a minute. Then serve over pork chops.

I tried it as written and didn't think it was anything special. There is a better dill sauce on this site that goes with Salmon.

This reminded me of all the sour cream recipes that circulated in the 60's and seventies...but the dill saved it and my family loved it. Reduced fat sour cream worked just fine..but it is quite rich and you won't need that muchof this to serve a whole family

This was easy and great! I made a few changes though...First, I used slightly thicker pork chops searing the juices by browning them first on a higher heat with just a touch of oil olive coating the skillet...then cooked them through. I removed the pork chops, saute' in butter (an increased amount) of onion and mushrooms in a separate pan. I then added all of the ingredients listed in the recipe in the skillet and cooked it on a lower heat with some white wine. Then at the end I added some fresh chives. Oh, I also decreased the amount of dill a little bit for my taste. And, as I said before it turned out great (that way anyhow)!

We enjoyed this dish last night,albeit, a few changes were made. I did not have fresh dill so substituted fresh sage and fresh thyme, which worked well. In Europe we prefer to add wine to a sauce rather than water!!!. All in all a good recipe.

This pork chop dish is easy to prepare and the results bely it's simple prep. We have dill in our garden so we are generous with it. If you follow the instructions and brown the chops at high temp the inside is juicy and the sauce goes great with the browned crust. This is a regular at our house.

We really like this recipe - I made a few adjustments. I didn't have an onion, or fresh dill so I used a shallot, and a good teaspoon on dill. I also added a generous dash of herbs de provence (my latest secret ingredient) Defiantely a keeper - would make for company with oven roasted potatoes, but might try it with reduced fat sour cream first

Rating: 2
The main advantage to this dish is that it is fast and easy to make. However, the sauce is too bland as prepared by the recipe. It lacks oomph and adds little to the natural flavor of the pork chops. I might try making it again with some variations -- add some garlic, substitute wine for the water.

I thought that this recipe was absolutely delicious and completely effortless. I always try to look for gourmet recipes that use basic ingredients, not fancy stuff that is hard to find.

An easy one-pan weeknight recipe. Such delicious results for the effort. I don't really like dill, so I substituted with a little chopped thyme. Double the onions and sauce, since I had thick chops. Used a dry white wine instead of water to deglaze the pan. Made the rice with julienned carrots recipe above, also good.

We really liked this recipe. I used fresh rosemary instead of dill, chicken stock instead of water. Since I was serving this with italian bread, I also used 50% more onions, mushrooms and sour cream so that we had more sauce for dipping. I cooked the pork on medium heat and the chops cooked just fine. This was easy and very tasty. Will DEFINITELY make this again SOON!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe last night. I was really not in the mood for another grilled pork chop and this really was a nice change and very easy to make. Everyone that had problems with the smoke you might try turning the heat down between Med to High and turning on the overhead fan. I did not experience any smoke.

This is a great way to "dress-up" pork chops for a fast and flavorful mid-week meal. Wine deepens the flavor. I used a meat mallet and made the chops quite thin and cooked them a little faster, about a minute at the most. This eliminated the smoke issue another reviewer commented on. I might try this recipe with veal sometime.

The recipe tasted fine, but was nothing special. Like others, I substituted wine for the water. I was not prepared for all the smoke caused by cooking the meat on high though! Thank goodness for the whole house fan! In the future, I'll cook the meat on medium at most.

I added a chopped clove of garlic after cooking the onions and mushrooms and used white wine in place of the water. I let the wine reduce for about one minute before adding the sour cream, and used about 1 teaspon of dried dill. A good weekday meal that is easy to prepare within 20-30 minutes.

Tastes like a dish my Lithuanian grandma used to make! Very easy to prepare and the ingredients are found in any supermarket. I used shiitake and white mushrooms and browned the pork in a cast iron pan. Next time i think i'll add a bit of white wine and reduce it before adding the sour cream to give the sauce more depth. Give this recipe a try!

Delicious!! Easy!! Quick!! The only thing I didn't have on hand was the dill, so I headed to the local organic grocer and came home with a fresh, just picked bunch.

Can't get the hang of frying thin pork chops, so I used 1-1-1/2" thick so they wouldn't be overcooked. Following Bob Adams's tip, I added a bit of white wine to the pan drippings and chops, covered them and put them in the oven to finish cooking through for about 30 minutes. I always keep yogurt cheese on hand to substitute for sour cream (drain plain yogurt to produce the "cheese"), and it was particularly delicious in this recipe, enhanced by the fresh dill. I served it with basmati and wild rice with sauteed shitake mushrooms and julienned carrot; and tomato on lettuce leaf for salad - and color. It was a complete success, and it's in my recipe box for dinner guests in future.

A good weeknight recipe. Fast and flavorful. I substituted fat free sour cream for the real stuff and it was still good. I doubled the sauce recipe for the 2 of us and has about 1/3 lefotver. I served it with brown and wild rice and a salad for a relatively healthy dinner.

Not usually a fan of pork; it's just too damn lean, however, this recipe works. Do not try to use thicker chops- the beauty of the dish is that the meat cooks quickly like veal scallopine. Particularly smart in its timing--using the pork chop/sour cream sauce/mush thing takes 45min-1hr. This takes 10 min. Try this one.

Rating: 3
With one change, I made this recipe and will make it again. The change was caused by the fact that I had very thick chops and I am wary of frying such thick chops to the point they are done. Unfortunately, the health police have convinced the pork industry to reduce the fat in our pork and it just doesn't cook or taste as well as it did 20 years ago. As a consequence, I seared the chops in some clarified butter, then added about a 1/4 cup of white wine, covered the frying pan and put it in the oven at 350 for 20-30 minutes. I sauteed the mushrooms and onion in a separate pan and held them until the pork was done. When the pork was cooked I removed them from the pan and kept them warm and boiled down the wine broth until it was thick and syrupy -- a very pretty brown color. At this point, I added the mushrooms, onion, sour cream (I used a bit more than the recipe called for), dill, and the chops. It was, as they say in the South, "good eatin."
