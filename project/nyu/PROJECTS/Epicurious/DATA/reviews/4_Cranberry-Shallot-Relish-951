I just re-found this recipe. I made it several times in the late 90's. It's definitely worth making. We will serve it with Brie and toasted baguette as an appetizer on Thanksgiving.

A friend of mine found this recipe years ago--I now make it every year. It also makes a delicious spread for turkey sandwiches!

I've made this every year since it was published. I never did get around to using the crytallized ginger however. The first year I also made a more traditional sauce since I didn't think the kids would like it. Turns out this is actually their favorite. I like it better with a little less curry powder.

I made this recipe a couple of years ago for Thanksgiving and loved it. Some of my guests did not. Be prepared, it is a savory recipe and not for unadventuous.
