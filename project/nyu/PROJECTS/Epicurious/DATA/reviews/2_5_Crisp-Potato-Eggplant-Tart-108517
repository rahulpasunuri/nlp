Like others, I found the initial filling a little bland, so added garlic and a little garam masala to the eggplant. Rather than trying to turn the tart using spatulas, I put a rimless sheet pan over the top of the skillet, flipped the skillet over onto the pan, and slid the now-turned tart back into the skillet.

How does one turn over a 9" tart halfway through cooking without having it fall apart?

While rather tasty and easy to prepare, the end result wasn't what I was expecting. I had trouble turning the tart over in the pan, and had to upend it onto a flat baking sheet. The top and bottom were nicely crisp, but the middle was a bit mushy and soggy, even though I really squished the eggplant and potatoes between multiple paper towels so that the water would drain out. There is PLENTY of salt in this recipe, but definitely too much butter as others have said. I would only use half as much butter next time.

After reading reviews of how bland it was, I made it with modifications: Used onions instead of shallots, added minced garlic, diced bell-peppers and topped with grated grana padano cheese. (Though perhaps a little mozzarella or other softer cheese might have been better. It made a great vegetarian main-course.

Good enough to make again, but I agree with adding more onions and garlic... Also, I ended up transfering it to a regular baking pan after browning both sides in a pan. It held its shape and was very satisfying.

I didn't have shallots so I used onions and garlic and only had one white potato, so I added two yams. It came out delicious.

This recipe is way more work than it's worth and is WAY too oily/buttery. It's not necessary to use that much fat. Even so, we had to use a lot of salt and pepper to get any flavor.

This recipe was pretty bland. With some other ingredients, like perhaps a meat like bacon or some eggs it might be better. I reviewed it in detail on my blog http://misschefy.wordpress.com

Just add in garlic...and this recipe is FANTASTIC. It is a bit hard to cook the potatoes, so I made a "top" and a "bottom" crusty potato first, then put back in the pan with the eggplant to bake.

Not only ugly but more work than it is worth. I do not suggest this recipe--it's not a very good use of decent ingredients.
