We loved it! Just make sure that you use the recommended bread, a fresh loaf of rounded, rustically shaped bread yielding large slices of hearty bread. Anything smaller won't do. I added a bit of chopped rosemary and a good bit of parsley and mint in chiffonade, and to bring the flavor up, a bit of lemon zest. This was the perfect accompaniment to gazpacho, and if you like to to keep things creamy, with vichyssoise. I hope this helps and is yummy, if easy! Cheers! Laurel

I made the recipe as is, without any substitutions and with my own black pepper bread. I thought this was great! Definitely too rich for anything but special occasions, but still-- excellent comfort food.

I used a lot less Boursin than 12 oz (approx 1 oz/sandwich) and made a couple other substitutions. For the cracked pepper bread I used organic pane paisano, and for the bacon I used SmartDeli meatless 3-peppercorn-style pastrami by LightLife. Certainly easy, but still a 2-fork recipe.
