This chowder was lovely, but I think that next time I will make it with bacon instead of pancetta.I wanted to stay as close to the original recipe as possible, but, to me, bacon has more flavor than pancetta. Also, in an attempt to be healthy I used half and half instead of whipping cream, but I think I will stick to the cream next time because the half and half separated just a tiny bit. No one else noticed it, but I did.

this is a really good chowder. i cut down the amount of salmon in it as well as the pancetta by about half and it was plenty! we had 2 large helpings and there is at least 4 left. can't imagine if i'd used 2 1/2 lbs of salmon!

This was a fantastic chowder. I followed the advise of other cooks by subbing half the clam juice with white wine. The recipe was quick, easy and tasty. My husband raved about it thru dinner. I definitely will make this recipe again and suggest it to all.

Really yummy. It was fine using bacon, as pancetta was too expensive. It worked fine halving it. But I still used the full amount of corn. 5 cups of clam juice is expensive at WF so I used 1/2 clam juice and half white wine. Yummers.

Great meal.... here are my changes: instead of 5 cups of clam juice, do 2 cups clam juice, 2 cups white wine, 1 cup chicken stock. I added a large yellow onion, 3 stalks of chopped celery and 1 chopped red bell pepper to the leeks... made it really hardy! I added some wine to the vegetables as well when i sauteed them. Add salt and pepper to the veggies while cooking them - don't wait until the end to season. In addition the salmon, I added 5 large sea scallops (quartered).... was the best addition!! Bravo!

I made this with leftover roasted salmon and it was delicious. Used 2 cups clam juice, 1 cup white wine and 1 cup chicken broth. I also used heavy cream. Definitely needs salt. Add a little grated Parmigiano at the end to give it a little kick! Delish.

Delicious! I used a boxed seafood stock instead of the clam juice..it gives more depth than I thought clam juice would.

My favourite kind of recipe - ready in about an hour - tastes like you worked at it all day. Because of other reviewers' comments re the clam juice, I used a little less, and made up the difference with white wine. YUM!

I haven't made this as yet, but, I would poach the salmon, strain the broth, and use this broth instead of the clam juice. Clam juice is too overpowering to use here except in clam chowder. Otherwise, just continue with the recipe as is.

I read the reviews where folks complained about it tasting too much like clam juice & took them to heart: since I had several pounds of king salmon collars, I took the bones and made a kind of court boullion (they say you shouldn't make a fish stock with salmon bones since they're so oily, but I figure for a salmon chowder, it's ok!) with the bones, celery, wine, water and parsley. I let that simmer for 30 minutes and used that stock (with more white wine to make up the 5 cup volume) in place of the clam juice. It was very good, and tasted purely of salmon! I sauteed some chopped red peppers to garnish and they made for nice color and flavor. Also used yellow corn, again for color. Quite yummy (and using the fish bones to make stock was a lot cheaper than 5 bottles of clam juice at 3 bucks a pop!).

I have made this recipe several times and always to rave reviews! In fact, with only minor changes, a local market that serves soup in the winter has added it to their menu.

I just finished making this and I don't like it. Too bad, because I was really looking forward to it. I think I would have liked it more with a different base, more onions, and red peppers sauteed with them, maybe some celery. Also, even though I followed others' advice and substituted 1 cup of wine for a cup of clam broth, the whole thing tasted of bottled clam juice. Maybe less clam juice next time, and some milk instead rather than the wine. Also, from what I understand, american bacon is an OK substitute for pancetta, but it isn't as refined a taste. I also used a mix of 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 cup cream, which separated, making the whole thing a nasty looking mess. Oh, well, better luck next time...

we made this chowder around new year's, and after all of the heavy foods that we had been consuming it was a wonderful change of pace! like most of the people who write these reviews i couldn't just follow the recipe, but i only changed the pancetta to bacon, and the clam juice to a combination of crab & clam. everything else was pretty much by the book. there was no need to tamper with perfection!

This was a good chowder but not great as published. Here are the changes I made and would make in the future. I only made half the recipe. I used pancetta but did not notice it was to be a garnish so it cooked in the chowder. I would keep it crisp the next time. I used white wine and clam broth as recommended and only added the corn at the end. For salmon, I used 8 ounces of some lovely smoked Alaskan salmon fillet. The major change I would make is to add the additional salt (the cream needs it) earlier in the process. The potatoes were very bland and would have benefitted from an earlier addition of salt. But overall it is a great fish chowder base and would work well with a variety of ingredients.

I love the recipe and so does everyone I make it for. I will try reducing the cream and adding wine this time as suggested.

I made this as part of a "soup buffet" to rave reviews. To accomodate some vegetarians at the table, I just used canola oil instead of the bacon fat to sautee the leeks. I agree with some other reviewers that the frozen corn probably doesn't need to cook for so long and I would add it at the end with the salmon next time. Used only half of the amount of cream/half-and-half called for and found it to be still quite luxurious. Needs salt. Served this with buttermilk cornbread and apple-crisp for dessert.

Good recipe, although I made some additions that made it excellent. First, I used bacon. Second, I added a yellow onion in with the leeks. Third, after sauteeing the leeks, I added some white wine, a pound of clams, covered until they opened. Once they did I removed and reserved them. Fourth, I used four cups chicken stock and only a small bottle of clam juice. Fifth, I used fresh corn and baby red potatoes. Finally, I added all the clams back in at the end with the bacon. Came out great.

DELICIOUS. Have made this twice now, and as per a previous review, used only four bottles of clam juice and the rest in white wine. Actually added more white wine at the end to increase liquid a bit. Added corn only at the end (with salmon), didn't think it needed to boil for that long. The second time I made this with only (only!) 15% cream, and results were just as great. This recipe is definitely a "keeper" and one to recommend to friends! Thank you Epicurious!

This dish is a wonderful comfort food! I was unable to find pancetta, but regular bacon was just fine. I also used fresh corn instead of frozen, and cut the salmon into smaller pieces than suggested. I served the chowder with fresh biscuits and it made a wonderful meal.

Easy,fast,good,-so will make again. Cooking from my pantry, I subbed using: BUTTER to saute & can of HORMEL REAL BACON Pieces for the bacon & fat; Knorr FISH BOUILLON cubes,EVAP MILK, HALF&HALF (fat free) for liquids; FRESH YELLOW CORN cut from cobs; diced RED PEPPER for garnish. With leftovers, we may add a bit of fresh diced jalapeno &/or tomato bits (or hot salsa) just to vary the tastes a bit. Cilantro devotees may enjoy garnishing with a bit. -Could also saute bias-cut celery and maybe carrot shreds with the onion for extra flavors and nutrition. If subbing for the high fat as we did and you want to add a "smoothing" agent, stir in a bit of fat-free sour cream at the end. A solid 2-3 forker as modified for budget and fat content. As posted, the taste would certainly be a 3-4 fork (uhh, spoon!) recipe.

I really, really, really enjoyed this recipe. I have made this dish twice already, and I am looking forward to making it again. I used twice as much corn, a little more potatoes, and lemon thyme instead of regular thyme. YUMMY!!

I made this last week. The only changes I made were to reduce the recipe by one half and add 1/2 diced red bell pepper. It was rich and very filling. My husband loved it. I thought it was pretty good. I did not care much for the flavor of thyme in the dish. One could also reduce the amount of salmon and not compromise much flavor.

FYI, people. Enjoying eating and cooking "gourmet" food doesn't require that you take yourself too seriously. Apparently, there are too many folks out there who do. BTW, what's wrong with cream of mushroom soup? One of my family's favorite meals is chicken and rice, made with C of M soup! I make homeade soup to eat, but use the canned stuff too. Get a sense of humor! And eat carp, there's too many of 'em swimming around here, anyway!

We really liked this. I'm not a huge fish person, so I used just 2 cups of clam juice and substituted broth for the rest. I think the pancetta really makes it. Also, think I will try half as much cream next time.

I'm from Australia and we are universally acknowledged to be at least 200 years behind everyone else. I haven't made this recipe but I can offer some worthwhile substitutions for those challenged by the combination of particularly gourmet and American ingredients. Try: 1. replace pancetta with one pig, defurred and hooves scrubbed and clipped 2. half and half - we don't have this here, so I would just throw in half a cow and half a goat. There's a good probability that anything they can produce is going to be at least half right 3. leeks - hmmm this was a challenge but onion week should be a tasty substitute and cheaply available for those with gardens in disrepair 4. clam juice - huh? we've got nothing much like that here and it's a bit jolly hard to even know what that's meant to taste like... ask a crab to piss in the pot and see how that goes. Bon Appetite

Being fr. WA. state, I beg pardon for the outrageous culinary tastes of my fellow Washingtonians. I actually found all the ingredients here in Seattle, though the butcher did have to go out back to fetch a pig for the pancetta (that's a feeble attempt at a joke)! Seriously, a WONDERFUL soup--rich, filling & incredibly tasty. I think there's a tad too much salmon in the recipe & I'd be careful salting the soup since the pancetta is quite salty.

Oh my! I can't remember when I've laughed so hard! Spam...bologna...tuna helper....and substituting onion powder for leeks? Well, let's give these folks credit for trying, but maybe Kraft mac and cheese would be a better solution. I've just found another reason to love epicurious.

Excellent Chowder. I made it with fresh corn and cod. Salmon would of even been better. I used half whipping cream and half 1/2 & 1/2, and thickened it with a little corn starch. Just try it you will like it!!!

Cambridge, you give Boston cooks a bad name--the person who originally mentioned tuna helper was _CLEARLY_ joking. I read his/her initial comment and laughed harder than I have in a long time. All that aside, though, I do agree with you that people should know what this website purports to provide (i.e., gourmet recipes) rather than complain. Still, the tuna helper person wasn't complaining!

LOL @ the cook from Cambridge, MA. I couldn't have said it better myself! Well put! Piggly, Wiggly, LOL!! I haven't made this chowder yet but from the looks of the ingredient list, it promises to be a great recipe! I can't wait to try it out:o)

yeesh! tuna helper? bon apetit and gourmet are magazines for people looking to cook... um... GOURMET food. if you find epicurious too high-falutin for your tastes, then DON'T READ the recipes. try allrecipes.com. half the recipes on that site call for a can of cream of mushroom soup. perhaps that's more to your taste. your snide comments are completely useless for the rest of us who actually plan on trying the recipes, even if we can't find pancetta at our local piggly-wiggly.

Bad luck at the grocery store: no fresh thyme available, no pancetta in stock, and only salmon steaks... no filets. However, the leeks were beautiful... so I substituted approx 1 tsp dried thyme, ordinary bacon, and deboned my salmon steaks. Nevertheless, it was still an easy and delicious chowder! A definite keeper. Look forward to making it with the fresh thyme and pancetta... I imagine it will be even better.

To Dishfan: Pancetta is made from pork so it's technically not red meat. That may not make you want to eat it, but it won't violate your dietary restriction.

How on earth does anyone replace fresh salmon (or anything) with "Tuna Helper?" Isn't that a box containing a bunch of ingredients like noodles and seasonings and you have to actually add the tuna part? Forgive me, I've never had Tuna Helper so maybe I'm the clueless one... Anyway, the recipe is great as is, but I made it once with less pancetta (about 1/4 lb. finely chopped) and it still worked out fine. I would not substitute anything for the leeks, though, it would change the flavor entirely. And I don't even want to get into the bologna and tuna helper bit. That's just too bizarre.

To all you Washingtonians out there, pancetta can be found at your local QFC's and/or Safeways for cripes sake. Try the deli if you can't find it packaged so someone can point it out to you. Otherwise substitute regular bacon. The taste is a bit smokier but fine for this recipe. I also substitute evaporated skim milk for the cream, healthier for our diet conscious family. It is a very tasty chowder! I garnished with a bit of chopped chives and lemon thyme. A keeper for me.

Does anyone out there actually make the recipe that is given in this magazine? Bologna? Corn starch and powdered milk? Have you gone mad? This recipe is a keeper - if you must mess with it, maybe half and half instead of heavy cream? Food is meant to be appreciated and enjoyed - everything in moderation!

Could you substitute onion powder for the leeks?

I often substitute non-fat evaporated milk in chowders that call for cream. Of course it is not as good as the real thing, but it's a healthy substitute that makes it all right to eat this on a regular basis, not just for special occasions.

I had a difficult time finding pancetta at the local Wal-Mart, so instead I used Oscar Meyer Bologna. Then I substituted Tuna Helper for the Salmon. The dish was excellent and so easy to make. All of my dinner guests were very impressed with my cuisinary prowess!

I made this recently for guests and found the kitchen smelled great during cooking, it was easy and when paired with a honey butter corn bread recipe(also available at epicurious.com) it was wonderful. Be sure you use fresh King Salmon and it will not disappoint. A tad pricy to make it into the rotation at our home. Enjoy!
