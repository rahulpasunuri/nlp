I just made this with lamb stew meat and it was delicious. I had to substitute raisins for prunes, and put in maybe 1 1/2 tbs of honey, but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it turned out really well. While the sauce was cooking down, I sauteed diced zucchini, eggplant, cippolini onion, green pepper, tomato and garlic in olive oil, tumeric, ginger and hot pepper flakes and served the vegs alongside the lamb, and I think that made the dish. Next time, I will try serving with the seven-vegetable couscous and chunky onion harissa (search on epicurious -- it's yummy!).

I really wanted to like this recipe and make it a keeper in my kitchen .. but I am sorry it didn't cut it at all .. I am really surprised at the raving reviews it's getting ... It's lacking in texture, waaaay too sweet and comes in all shades of brown ... and what's with the fine diced onion at the beginning and the fine sliced onion at the end .. just doesn't make sense ... I mean if you like a mediocre ginger beef, you'll like this one .. There are a much better recipes for Tagine and Lamb out there. I will not do this again ...

Very easy to make and a good change from the usual rosemary/garlic/salt recipes. I didn't have saffron. I didn't have prunes either but I did use chopped up dried apricots. Yummmmmmmm. The sauce was could be used as at jam on my bagel. I used only 1 1/4 tsp of honey since the apricots are already sweet and everything turned out perfect. I served it with mashed potatoes seasoned only with S&P. Naan bread on the side to sop up the sauce.

Indeed very good. I don't get how such an easy dish like this tastes so complex and tasty. A winner! I put both the apricot and prune and was excellent. Next time, I will put toasted almonds instead of sesame seeds.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I skipped the prunes and sesame seeds, and halved the honey. YUM!

The sauce that went along with this tagine was great. Savory and sweet, nice complexity. I served the lamb with the golden couscous (minus onions and veggies) that's on this site. I used lamb stew meat, to my mistake, and my lamb was way overdone because of it. Next time I'll make sure to use leg of lamb because it's much better when dealing with longer stewing times.

My gosh, this was great! I only had leftover lamb I had stored in the freezer, about 1 lb. Thawed that, chopped into bite-sized pieces and used. Sauted onions 1st until tender, then added spices (all quantities in half), prunes, lamb, chicken broth, honey and cilantro. Didn't have saffron, and didn't adjust for it. Cooked totally on stove top, covered at a bare simmer for about 25 minutes. Dish sat for a half hour, while rest of dinner cooked, and then simply warmed it up. Absolutely divine! We definitely didn't think it was too sweet, just the right mix of deep, rich, sweet,and savory flavors. Can't imagine how good the dish would be starting with uncooked lamb. (I do think I will cook all the onion initially, as I like a tender onion.)

Tasty but too sweet (tho I used half prunes, half dates as per suggestions, half the honey and cinnamon.) Couldn't taste lamb, couldn't taste any counterbalancing flavours. Wanted to love this, but didn't. My dinner companions, 2 men, were happy enough.

Wonderful recipe, great combination of spices. I used half prunes and half dried apricots and came out great. I served if over saffron couscous and my family loved it.

I wonder what would happen if I added potatoes and carrots to the mix?! I love vegetables with my tagine .. but in this case, would I need to change the amount of spice ...etc? thanks ... Marc

I am pleased that you all enjoyed the recipe from my cookbook Cooking at the Kasbah: Recipes from my Moroccan Kitchen! These are recipes gathered from family and friends in Morocco. This tagine is a classic. Bismillah, Kitty Morse www.kittymorse.com

I thought this was great. I did as several viewers recommended and did a mixture of half prunes and half dates and also chopped them up so you don't have a big bite of prune/date. I also reduced the honey by half. Served with couscous it was a very easy, very exceptional meal.

Excellent - wonderful mix of sweet-savoury. I substituted majool dates, which I halved and pitted.

Delicious! Savory and sweet, with a hint of spice.. completely well-balanced flavors! I mixed the lamb w/olive oil, turmeric, ginger, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper before browning. I used half prunes and half dates (cut into wedges), included the honey, and it wasn't too sweet for my group, although next time, I'd only use half or 3/4 tsp cinnamon bc the taste came through very strong. Served with couscous seasoned w/cumin, ginger & cayenne, and prepared w/orange zest & juice, cilantro, dried apricots, grated carrots, and sliced almonds. I'll definitely make this again!

Absolutely amazing dish! I used an unglazed tagine and cooked the meat for 1.5 hours at 350 F-- turned out really well. I think I'll also add pitted dates next time. I served it with couscous with pine nuts, which went really well with the meat.

I was a little worried that this would be too sweet so I used deglet dates instead of the prunes. It was fabulous. I didn't tie the cilantro and at the end I picked out the stems but left the leaves in and it was very good. This one is a staple now for my tagine!

I increased the recipe by 50% and everything turned out fine. The lamb was very tender after an hour and fifteen minutes of simmering. I used a mix of prunes, dates and apricots, and kept the honey and cinnamon. The sauce thickens really nicely, and while it's still sweet, the spice can cut through it. It's a good balance of complex flavors.

I feel that perhaps the people who complained that this dish was too sweet may have accidentally used sweetened prunes. I found this dish to be incredibly well-balanced in flavor. Heavenly...

I have never tried this dish, but both my husband and I thought it was delicious. Substituted chicken. I'm a hater of cilantro but added it because I knew it was a key ingredient inregards to adding a certain flavor. I'm glad that I did. I'll make this dish often.

I did like this dish - it was sweet and moist. (two forks are only because I think my personal tastes lean towards the spicy side vs. sweet). It was nice to serve over couscous.

Delicious. I also made it with chicken legs (bone-in, with the skin), because I didn't have lamb in the house. Browned the chicken as instructed, then threw that with all the other ingredients into the crock pot and let it stew for a few hours. It was fantastic! The chicken was falling off the bones and the sauce was delicious. Next time I would add lemons as other reviewers mentioned. What an easy way to make a great meal.

A great dish. Made this for my gourmet book club, and they loved it. I did not make mine in a tagine, but rather used a six-quart stockpot and that was fine. I added half the honey and mixed dates and prunes, and added cilantro and a little bit of chile pepper as someone else suggested. I used chicken thighs and legs, adding in some chicken breasts later in the cooking so they didn't dry out. (I made with chicken because two of my friends eating it the first time didn't like lamb.) Bought some organic lamb, though and it's in the freezer as I can't wait to make this with traditional lamb. I garnished with a sprinkling of finely minced cilantro to give some color to the plate, and served with golden couscous recipe also on this site. I served Moroccan Spiced carrots as a side dish, plus a simple green salad. Was a great way to serve a book club dinner for 12 people!

Pulled my tagine vessel out of storage and prepared this recipe with bone-in chicken thighs, and legs. Total cooking time for the chicken pieces was about 35 minutes. I coarsely chopped the cilantro, and left it in the sauce. Also used 1/2c. each of prunes, and dates as previously suggested, and omitted the honey. Will use all dates next time for sweet element. Only added 1/2t. of cinnamon at first, then taste tested. Decided not to add more as the taste suited me fine. Garnished with more chopped cilantro, and the sesame seeds. The sesame added the essential nuttiness to the dish. Served with a couscous to which I added toasted slivered almonds and cilantro.

A great dish. Like a few others in teh reviews, I used chickn because I have a couple of friends who don't like lamb. I bought whole chicken and cut them up and used the remnants for stock. I used chicken thighs and boneless chicken breasts and made drumettes of the wings. (I didn't use the legs, saving them for paella later.) I let the sauce simmer much longer than called for as I wanted to thicken it, about 45 minutes and it made it a bit "gooey" so I added more chicken stock. I also thought it needed a kick, so I added some cayenne at the very end. I also added in chopped cilantro before serving. I served this with golden couscous from this site and moroccan spiced carrots. Very good result. I will make with lamb next time. It seems complicated the first time but I think it's not too complicated a process once you get the hang of it.

Wow, what a great dish...I'm a Personal Chef and made this dish for a Moroccan themed dinner party tonight for 14 people...I tripled the recipe (6 lbs of lamb) and also made 3 lbs of Salmon with Charmoula....I did follow the advice of some previous reviewers, omitted the honey, used half dates, half prunes....added 2 minced serrano chiles with the onoins and once done added a generous handful of chopped cilantro.....the serving bowl came back licked clean!! I make very generous portions for my clients, and figured 9 lbs of meat for the two entrees would be more than enough for 14 people....they ate every bite!! Guests wandered into the kitchen during dinner for more wine/water etc and all commented on how great the tangine was.

Yes, far too sweet...Keeping this in mind after having read the reviews, I added quartered fresh lemons to the stew (the tajines I've had included caramelized lemons) and then squeezed some lemon juice toward the end of the cooking process, to my taste. I also added chunks of carrots.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and easy. I actually made it for 10 people, and it scaled up well. I made some modifications: The dish is very sweet without the honey- no need for it. I added dates and prunes, and used fresh chopped ginger instead of powdered. I also added two serrano chiles to give it some spice, and dried orange peel to give it scent and a slight citrus flavor. I finished it with a generous garnishing of chopped parsley. I think the cilantro, if used, should be chopped and integrated, as its flavor would not come through as an infusion.

I thought this dish was fabulous, but some people might be turned off by the idea of prunes with meat. My advice is don't worry about them, they blend right in. If you are particularly concerned you can chop them into tiny bits and then you really won't notice them, but you will still have the subtle flavor that they add to the recipe.

Delicious. I am allergic to prunes, so while I love the flavor they add to food, I substituted dates for the textural effect. I wondered if they would be too sweet, but it worked wonderfully. I used the rare left-over lamb from a roast leg.

A suggestion to those who would prefer to substitute chicken for lamb in this dish. Your results will be more succulent and flavorful if you use skinless chicken thighs, either on or off the bone, as the meat is more flavorful and stands up well during slow cooking. I've made my own version of tagine for years, but was intrigued by the cilantro and saffron in this one. We tried it tonight, cutting the cooking time down to 45 minutes, and then adding the chicken back into the sauce after reducing it. It did require a tad more honey, and a squeeze of lemon juice to suit our tastes. Otherwise, perfect. Served with a currant pilaf, sauteed mushrooms, and a green salad with pear and walnuts.

Substituted the lamb with split chicken breast (bone-in) for a low cholesterol version. Seared the chicken, cooked in the broth & tumeric as indicated for 10 min. Completed the sauce and added a last step of stewing the semi-done chicken in the sauce (cut into 2-3 pieces) in the oven for meat to absorb much of the sweetness from sauce. Very tasty.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was a not only delicious, but it was beautiful. I cannot eat lamb, so I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts for the lamb, but followed the same procedures. (Making this substitution probably also cuts down on some fat grams, I'm sure.) I served this with a fruited, nutty pilaf, flat bread and raita. I know I combined cultures, but it worked wonderfully. Loved every bite of it. I will make this again and often.

I've never tried a Tagine before, but definatly will again. Great flavors. Served it with a ratatouie and it worked great even though it's a bit of a culture clash. Also took the advice of a previous reviwer and served it with a spiced basmati. Outstanding!

I substituted some of our local fresh dates instead of the prunes and I eliminated the pepper. I served it with a Batsami rice which I cooked with toasted pine nuts, dried cranberries & apricots, scallions, an the following spices: cardamom, allspice, freshly ground nutmeg, cinnamon and a few threads of saffron.

This dish should really be called 'make this tagine.' I had never made it before; in fact I had never eaten tagine before. But I doubled the recipe to serve six, and it barely sufficed. Serve atop couscous with toasted pine nuts, and set small bowls on the table with fresh chopped cilantro and mint and some lemon wedges, and you've got a winner. (I also added two handfuls of chopped almonds to the sauce, which wanted some bulking up.) This one will be returning to my table soon...should get 3.5 forks.

A huge success, and even better as leftovers the next day. The flavors blended perfectly, and I especially like the fact that this dish uses much less oil than many Moroccan tagine recipes I've seen. I substituted lamb chops, and served the tagine with couscous enhanced with pine nuts, dried cranberries, dried apricots and chopped mint, plus baby carrots cooked and glazed in orange juice, butter and the Moroccan spice mixture Ras el Hanout. Our favorite dinner ever, and the inspiration for many more Moroccan feasts to come at our house.

I made this dish when my sister who lives in Rabat was staying with us. Accompanied by a seven vegetable couscous: turnip, courgette, tomatoes, carrots, onions, potatoes and parsley it made a delicious - and rather filling main ourse. Followed by two homemade sorbets: pink grapefruit and tangerine! this meal was a great success!

Since I didn't have lamb, I followed the lead of another reviewer and made this dish with chicken to so-so, boring results. Actually I was very disappointed and needed to tweak the recipe by adding some cumin, more honey, and a bunch of chopped cilantro just to make it worth eating. I think I'll try it again using lamb. It sounds so intriguing, I'm hoping that the lamb adds the flavor that the chicken version was lacking.

Certain recipes conjure their wonderful flavor through a cursory reading of the ingredients. Other's combine ingredients to create unimaginably symbiotic flavors that one must taste to understand. Make this dish and leave your dinner guests in complete awe... "What is in this?!"

Although I never happened to run across this particular tajine in Morocco, I thought it was as good or better than any I had there.
