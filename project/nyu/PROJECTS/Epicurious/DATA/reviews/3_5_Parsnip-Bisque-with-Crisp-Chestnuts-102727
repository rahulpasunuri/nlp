I was really looking forward to making this soup, but something went terribly wrong. I followed the recipe exactly except used dried thyme instead of sprigs. The soup had a very bitter taste. I had one bowl and had to pour the rest out.

This was a good, thick, hearty soup. But was disappointed in the flavor. Very mild and mellow...nothing special. The chestnuts were excellent on the soup, though! Kids did not like it and hubby rated as ok. Not a keeper for our family.

This is such an elegant (and EASY) soup with clean, simple flavors. Better if made a day or two ahead - the flavor develops well. Fresh thyme is a must. I served as a first course for a ladies book club luncheon followed by individual blue cheese souffles with endive,walnut and pear salad. And classic Tart Tatin with whipped creme fraiche for dessert.

Quite delicious, smooth and sweet. The chestnuts add a refreshing crispness and contrast in texture. Very easy to make. Can be made ahead and rewarmed, with chestnuts prepared and added just prior to serving.

Out of this world. And what a bonus, that it is low fat.

This soup has a very smooth texture. Great parsnip flavor even though we are at the end of the season here in NY. Very easy with great results. Used frozen chestnuts left over from Thanksgiving stuffing. YUM!

This was my first taste of parsnips, and they were very good. A cross between a carrot and a turnip, both of which I love. The soup was very rich. I could only eat a small bowl. Would be a great interesting first course for company or a dinner party.

Very good. Added one carrot for color. Chestnuts are a must!

This was the first time I ever cooked, or ate, parsnips.I tried it because I was looking for something to do with some vacuum-packed chestnuts I already had. Everyone loved the taste of the soup and the flavor and crunch added by the chestnuts. This has become a seasonal favorite in my house.

Yum! I was a little skeptical about the chestnuts, but their nuttiness complemented the parsnips perfectly. Also, I incompletely pureed the soup so that there were still chunks of parsnips and potatoes -- a more interesting texture, I think. And, I forgot fresh thyme, but found that a generous sprinkling of dried thyme worked just great.

This soup was very good. It tasted rich even though there is no fat in it. I made a rich homemade chicken broth, and the chicken flavor shone through. I did not have time to fix the chestnut garnish, but could tell that the a chestnut flavor would complement the soup.
