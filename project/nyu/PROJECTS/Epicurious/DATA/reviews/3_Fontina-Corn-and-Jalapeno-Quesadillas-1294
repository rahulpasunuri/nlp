I happened to have the ingredients, so I gave it a try. It was an okay, quick meal, but I won't be having it again. I've had much better, cheaper, and easier quesadilla recipes. Plus, I thought that the taste of the cheese was overpowered by the other ingredients, so it wasn't a great use of Fontina.

I have made these forever and served to all types with great results. These are yummy with a very nice delicate flavor. Don't change anything.

I have been making these for years. They are very easy and delicious. A nice change from the ordinary quesadilla ingredients.

As quesadillas go, these were extremely boring. Next time I'd use a different kind of cheese and a lot more spices.

Very simple to make, after I made my own flour tortillas--can't stand the store bought ones. Mild enough for the old folks and tasty enough for the younger set. I spiced it up by serving it with fresh salsa, refried black beans, sliced avocados and sour cream. Couldn't be better!

This was very good and extremely easy and quick to put together. I like a little more spice so I added red chili flakes and chopped cilantro and substituted a variety of Mexican cheeses.
