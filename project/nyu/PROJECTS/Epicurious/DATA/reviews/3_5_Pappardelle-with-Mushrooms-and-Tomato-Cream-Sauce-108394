The first few times I made this I couldn't find dried porcinis, so I used fresh shitakes and skipped adding the soaking water. Still very good. Relavtively easy to make and inexpensive, still turns out impressive.

clásico, si se le añade carne molida es la bolognesa que todos conocemos.

I must admit, I made some changes. I used dried porcini & a few dried morel mushrooms (I was short on porcinis). I used diced ham from Easter (no pancetta). I used fresh crimini mushrooms rather than plain white ones, dry sherry in place of medium-dry, and 1/2 & 1/2 in place of heavy cream. Okay, that being said, I didn't think it was all that great and rather was sort of boring. I didn't think the changes I made were much of a big deal - honestly, criminis have more flavor than plain white mushrooms. But it just didn't do it for me. I usually love Epicurous recipes and agree with most 3 & 4 forkers. Guess I have to disagree every once in a while. I will admit, it was easy, though.

I used more mushrooms, less cream, and no basil (not in season) and it was fantastic and still very rich. I would definitely make it again. I imagine the basil would make it even better.

This was delicious as the recipe is written - EXCEPT - used only 1 cup of cream. However, I think it would be improved with more mushrooms and more sherry and salt.

Great recipe. Taking direction from some of the other reviewers, I too added chicken and reduced the cream from 2 to 1 cups. When I make this again, I will use crushed tomatoes instead of whole. I think the recipe would be better if the tomatoes were not so chunky. I would also add a few red papper flakes for extra spice.

Mmmmm, this was yummy! I used less cream and it was still wonderful! I would consider adding fresh green peas in future just because I love that mix. Trust me, it is WONDERFUL as is!! Oh, and one other thing... I did not have fresh mushrooms and used extra porcini, and it did not hurt it at all!!!

This is a rich and very yummy dish. I'm glad I read the reviews and followed the advice of others--it bears repeating: no need for TWO whole CUPS of cream! I used one and even that seemed a bit much. Pappardelle was nice; I will go with penne next time and more mushrooms for sure, as they really retain the flavor of the beginning elements.

Such a good pasta dish. I really loved it, specially the sauce

This was fabulous - I have made this time and time again. It is especially tasty when I have added chicken!

I just made this dish, my husband is washing the dishes as I type. It was exceptional as written, there are a lot of variations in these reviews and I am here to say that it is one of the those exceptional restaurant dishes that translates well at home. The porcini adds lovely depth while not overwhelming the sauce and the sherry is barely detectable although without it it would not be the same. The addition of the fresh basil and parsley at the end adds a wonderful green brightness to the otherwise mellow, creamy, reduced sauce and don't skip the parm. I was luck enough to have some imported german egg pappardelle and there's leftovers, lucky me!

Wow. The flavor was excellent. My husband said it was the best pasta dish he ever had. We made it with angel hair (his preference) and it was just great. Will definately make again!

This is a great recipe that adapts well to what you have on hand. Only had dried porcini, so added a lot more than 1/4 cup (and probably more onion). Used bacon I had already cooked, and as others suggested, added a few more garlic cloves. Used a can of organic crushed tomatoes and only 1 cup of heavy cream (which was plenty). During the final thickening simmer (which did not take 45 minutes), I added sun-dried (non-oil) tomatoes. A hearty and flavorful pasta dish.

This dish is delicious and great for a dinner party. I think the full cup of cream is unecessary. A half cup worked just fine. I do think it is necessary to simmer it longer than 45 minutes. I think I simmered it close to an hour and 1/2 and the flavors really intensified. I used pappardelle from Trader Joes.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! Used bacon in place of pancetta, and added a little more garlic to taste. Will try again; I think it would be wonderful with the addition of scallops.

I thought this dish was fabulous. I used bacon and halved the cream. I would only add this to the other comments: I found it even better the next day.

Rating: 3
Pretty good- made as directed except used all organic items including a killer all-natural pancetta. Used home-grown pesto basil leaves. I found this dish to be a bit too bland. I added salt at the end which helped a little, but in general, it just didn't have enough flavor to justify the number of expensive ingrediants.

This is a fabulous recipe....I didn't make it according to plan since I don't like booze in my food....also used shitake mushrooms instead....combined with Gnocchi from this site....was wonderful.

Rating: 4
EXCELLENT SAUCE. USED A MIXTURE OF DRIED PORCINIS AND SHITAKES AND SLICED VERY LARGE MUSHROOMS. WONDERFUL TASTE. HUSBAND LOVED IT. NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD USE MILK INSTEAD OF CREAM AND HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE . MAKE ANOTHER DISH THAT DOES NOT CALL FOR CREAM.

Excellent. I substituted bacon for pancetta and used 1/2 cup half and half in lieu of the second cup of cream. Delicious and luxurious.

This dish is to die for. I made it exactly according to directions and can't imagine leaving anything out, especially the dried porcini, which gives it a distinctive, deep flavor. This is a fine restaurant-quality meal at home.

Made verbatim except used veggie bacon in place of pancetta... all in all very good, but man, with all that cream prepare for a tummy ache. Would probably use penne next time instead of pappardelle.

Rating: 2
This was good but not great. Perhaps something was lost by using whole milk instead of cream.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but I must say very rich as well, serve with a very light salad or else no app at all...I used all fresh mixed mushrooms and vegtable broth instead of soaking juice, plus no pancetta(im a veg) A great recipie for tomato based cream sauces...

Rating: 4
Skipped the porcini step as I did not have any & they are too pricey for me usually. Followed the rest almost exactly as described, though used mostly milk in lieu of cream as others suggested...maybe 5 tbs. cream, the rest 2% milk. Used a peppered pancetta, which was very good, and baby bellas instead of white mushrooms to up the 'shroom flavour - esp. since I cut out the porcinis. All in all, very good and easy to make on a weekday night.

Excellent. Doubled the garlic, but otherwise made as-is. Took longer than expected for it to thicken, but definitely worth it!

Rating: 3
This was really nice, very easy to make, and my kids ate it all, which was a good sign! Next time I will add more pepper and pancetta and put some sun-dried tomatoes in it as well. Overall, though, a very nice flavour, and one that shall be made again.

I'm in Shanghai, so it's hard to get the exact ingredients, but my roommates raved. The biggest change I made was adding some red chili flakes with the tomatoes and the wine to give it some extra zing.

I can't really rate this recipe since I didn't prepare it as written, but I can say it's a terrific starting point. I used shallots, no sherry and no mushrooms, one cup of milk in place of one of the cups of cream, more pancetta and more parmesan (added to the sauce at the end) and it was delightful.

This is really good,I did not have sheery at the moment and used Marsala instead. Terrific.Also less cream. Used the leftovers over chicken the next day it was glorious.

I have eaten at La Dolce Vita and have always had great meals so I was excited to try this recipe. However, I couldn't bear the thought of adding all of that cream for fat and lactose reasons (my husband is lactose intolerant). So, I just added about 3/4 cup of milk instead and the result was delicious, the flavors all came through instead of just being all about the cream. Otherwise I didn't change the recipe.

Rating: 4
Very good. Made half the recipe except all garlic shallots,pancetta, and a lot less cream which was still enough.

This, by far, was the best pasta dish I can remember eating. It was very easy to prepare. I can believe how well all of the flavors compliment eachother.

Wonderful just as is. Everyone had seconds and then mopped their plates with bread. Looking forward to having remaining leftovers for lunch.

It was great! Yes lots of extra fat but worth the splurge, the layers of flavor were subtle and the cream smoothed out the acidity of the tomato beautifully. Not at all hard to make after a day at work and most of all I was amazed at how much our guests raved! Everyone repeatedly insisted this recipe be "a keeper" (I rarely make the same thing twice!).

Rating: 3
Pretty easy and very good. If you want to cut down of the fat, I used evaporated milk and it was delicious. Also used ham and red wine.

This was fabulous! I loved it! The only alteration of this recipe I made was omitting the mushrooms ( i detest mushrooms!), which I know is a Cardinal sin to some... everything else was done exact to recipe and my husband and I adored it; it was like a wonderful Italian bistro meal.

Rating: 3
I used fresh shitakes rather than button, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream (and also about 50 per cent less), ham instead of pancetta. Yes this was rich, but you can serve small portions. I will definitely make this again and thought it was very tasty.

Rating: 2
Even though I would probably not take the time to make this again(it was way too rich...I could feel my arteries hardening with every bite!)I was intrigued and impressed with the fact that whipping cream was used. It cut the acidity of the tomatoes to nothing! I would recommend making this for a dinner party...my kids freaked out until they tasted the "orange sugo" and realized that it was very good! But, for me, if I want a dish of pasta, I'd be better off doing it the traditional way(sans whipping cream).

I really enjoyed it. I skipped the porcini mushrooms and used cream sherry, but found it a little bit too sweet. Next time I will use dry sherry and a bit more salt and garlic. Definitely a keeper.

Couldn't get pancetta, used a salty German ham instead. Fantastic! Goes in the top ten favorite recipes.

Just made this tonite. I doubled the recipe used imported San Marzano tomatos (had them in the pantry); used bacon (grocery was out of pancetta); used 1 1/2 times the cream not doubled; and I added 1/2 the cheese to the sauce and sprinkled the rest on. My family loved it. Said the mushrooms seemed like meat. Used a long curly pasta that looked like really narrow lasagne. The curls held onto the sauce. Yummy, would definitely make this again.

Excellent easy recipe.

Rating: 3
This was good, I made and would make further changes: 1) per other reviewer's suggestion, I used sausage (used chicken/tomato/basil, should have used italian) instead of pancetta (not in my grocer), 2) cut cream in 1/2 (unnoticable), and 3) use diced tomatoes. If making this for an easy family supper, I might consider omitting dried mushrooms and doing 1/2 crimini, 1/2 white. That's it!

Sorry -- this review is more for the restaurant than the recipe. If any reader should happen to be in Soho, you *need* to try La Dolce Vita. Simply heaven and inexpensive. Which says a lot for NYC. I would recommend the Pumpkin Ravioli w/Sausage Cream sauce and Tagaltelle (sp?) with Brandy Salmon cream sauce. YUM! Linguini and clams are excellent too!

We couldn't find pancetta down here, so I substituted bacon, and instead of chopping whole tomatoes, I used pre-diced. It came out wonderfully.

This pasta dish was great. I doubled up on the pancetta and garlic, it worked well. I used bow tie pasta as I could not find any pappardelle. Very easy and tasty. I would make this again.

A-plus quality pasta dish. My husband said "it was a keeper" so that means it was really good. I think maybe I'll add a little hot Italian sausage next time just because my husband would prefer a little more meat. Delicious and definitely company-worthy.

This was easy and delicious. I did not have the time to simmer it for as long as suggested, and it turned out just fine - I just used a hotter flame. Not an every day dish as it is rich, rich, rich...

This is a great pasta dish! I made it for a dinner party last night. The timing is great, you can have the sauce cooking when guest arrive (it smells wonderful!) and boil the noodles when people are ready to eat. Very flavorful and filling but not too heavy. Also, I used 1/2 & 1/2 rather than cream without incident.
