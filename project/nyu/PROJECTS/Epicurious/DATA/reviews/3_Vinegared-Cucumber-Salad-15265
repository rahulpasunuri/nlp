It is too sour. I had to add more sugar and sesame oil to make it tolerable.

A very nice and simple cucumber salad. I will definitely make this again!

Adding the salt is really not neccessary, and this recipe makes enough for several days. I have added a small amount of fresh minced ginger, sometimes a little fresh garlic(but ooh how un-Japanese!) and always a dash of shoyu. This has become our stock cucumber recipe. Everyone loves it.
