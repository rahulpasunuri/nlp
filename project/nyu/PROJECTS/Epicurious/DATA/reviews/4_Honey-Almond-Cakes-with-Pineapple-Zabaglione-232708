First off I should say that I didn't make this zabaglione recipe, but the one that I made had the same sugar to egg proportion so I can say that that seems to work fine. As for the cakes, I *love* them. Kind of dense, very moist, definitely not crumbly, basically almond paste cake-ified. Perfect for a girl who loves almond paste. I also liked the individual cake presentation for dolloping on the creamy light zabaglione. Served with traditional marsala zabaglione (just subbed 3 TBSP Marsala for the pineapple), and strawberries. Happy Birthday, Dad!

Made this for company and everyone loved it. I thought the cake alone was yummy and that the pineapple was a little too tart, but others thought it cut the sweet. I would think that any kind of fruit would be good.

This was okay; I love almond desserts but this cake was kind of eggy; I have other recipes that are much better! I found Dole pineapple juice concentrate at my regular grocery store. Overall, okay, but I won't be making it again.

I have not made this recipe yet, but it sounds tasty...I would also make it with Passion Fruit concentrate and perhaps Guava concentrate....

Like the other reviewers, I had a tough time finding frozen pineapple juice concentrate, so I simply reduced some fresh pineapple before making the zabaglione. It turned out great. The cakes were moist, and the zabaglione had just the right amount of pineapple flavor. Next time I might reduce the sugar (there is plenty in the juice), but my guests loved this recipe as is. I only wish I'd made more!

Stumped is a term that is used in the US regularly, but I never knew its origins. Thanks for the trivia!

From one deprived cook to another, you can try using the syrup from a can of pineapple (if too thin, simmer gently to thicken) or puree and strain a slice or two of fresh or canned pinapple (adding a little sugar water if too thick). Or better yet, given where you live, use some strained, fresh passion fruit! Hope that helps.

Sounds deliciius, but I cannot try it as frozen pineapple juice concentrate is not available in Australia. This often happens with American recipes, and I am usually able to substitute something, but tis time I am stumped.(a cricket term meaning I am out of the game.)Ant ideas?
