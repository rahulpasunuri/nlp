I'm shocked at what a disappointment this was considering the rave reviews. I followed this exactly as is - fresh artichokes and prosciutto and all great quality ingredients, and it really wasn't anything special and quite bland. It tasted like any old simple risotto, except it wasn't simple and was quite a waste of ingredients! I'll go back to my old habit of sticking to just a couple of ingredients for good risotto.

Great recipe. I normally don't like standing over a steaming pot in July, but this risotto is worth it. I think the yield is closer to eight servings, not six.

I'm looking at making this dish, and I'd love to take some suggestions - could anyone be more specific on the substitutions. For example, how many cans/jars of artichokes to use instead of the fresh ones?

Loved this recipe! We did use jarred artichoke hearts for convenience and it was fabulous!

A wonderful dish to impress dinner guests. Fabulous flavors and textures. I've made this recipe every year since it first came out in 1994.

This wasn't bad, but I found it rather salty with the prosciutto. I omitted the artichokes and used homemade stock. My fiancée loved it, but next time I'll use less prosciutto and low salt broth.

I thought this was incredible. I left out the artichokes and the green onions and added white wine before I started to add the broth. I will definitly make this dish again!

This is sooo delicious. I can't imagine using prepared artichokes - the fresh veggies make the recipe. I also used fresh peas. The artichokes are easy to prepare but be very careful to get all of the tough leaves off. This is definitely in my permanent recipe file!

Wonderful (the blissed-out face of husband tells the tale.) I always omit the artichokes, and we don't miss them a bit.

This dish is a meal in itself. I often use it as a side dish to go with simple meat or chicken recipes. I do substitute the artichokes with canned artichokes, it cuts the cooking time in half.

I've made this dish numerous times and it is excellent. I use canned artichoke hearts to make it easier. A fun dish to prepare with good friends doing the stirring.

One of my and my husband's favorite recepies, artichoke cleaning part requires some skills, though.This classic, great tasting risotto recepie has never failed me.
