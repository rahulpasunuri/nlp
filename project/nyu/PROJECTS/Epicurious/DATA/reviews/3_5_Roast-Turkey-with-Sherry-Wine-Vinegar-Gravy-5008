The wine vinegar made for a beautiful deep brown color on the bird. However, the taste was only ok and the gravy was a lot of bother for not an impressive flavor.

This was great -- I'll repeat this year. I used a mixture of cooking sherry and white wine vinegar since I can't find "sherry wine vinegar".

Fabulous describes the Turkey & Currant Pecan Stuffing. Everyone loved it. Increased measurements to accomodate 23 lb bird. Added 1 cup chicken broth to stuffing in lieu of 1 cup water plus a little extra sherry to gravy. Superb.
