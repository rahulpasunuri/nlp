Instead of Ketchup I use BBQ Sauce, and only 1/2 cup of milk. I omit the onions and/or bacon on top. SOOOOO good! When it's cooking the smell is incredible. Makes great leftovers. Amy Sedaris' book is so good when you're in a funky mood...she is hilarious.

Made this for the family last night for Halloween. It could have been very good except for the red wine which I used Black Box Merlot (on hand). The wine gave the meat loaf a wierd after taste. Used abou 1/2 specified onions. I will try the Yummy Mummy meat loaf next time.

This was delicious! I'm not big on meatloaf but the b/f wanted to make some so after looking in various cookbooks we settled on this recipe. He added in some bacon fat (he says about 3T), so perhaps that made it extra special tasty, but it got rave reviews with our friends.

Culinary school? Amy's no chef, but her meatloaf is super yummy. Yes, I'd be judicious with the amount of liquid, but this isn't so much a food snob dish.

Here is a hint, actually a huge recommendation...don't add as much ketchup as you want. This was taught to us in grade school to cover up a world of mistakes, Think about it; Tastes like ketchup! Good.Wrong,Wrong, Wrong! If you remember early lessons in culinary school extra moisture causes a world of hurt. We could spend a day & a half on how wrong it is to toss bottles of ketchup into a recipe because you want to fool your customers (or family). If you love bitter wet chunks of sloppy meat be my guest & whip up a heaping pile of this meatloaf.

so easy to make and everyone loved it, I will certainly make this again, the kids didn't even smother it in ketchup.

I'm making this dish again right now! The meatloaf was super moist and I put chutney on top because that's all I had on the refrigerator door. I just got this whole recipe book this weekend and it is unbelievably funny and fabulous and practical.
