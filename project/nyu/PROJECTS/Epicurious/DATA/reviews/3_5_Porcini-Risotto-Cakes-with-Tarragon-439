First, good news: it's a simple and a cannot-fail recipe. Just a couple of changes, however. Arborio rice or (Japanese) sticky rice works best. I doubled the mushrooms and minced them. I doubled the cheese and used the finest grate possible. Refrigerating overnight or at least 8 hours is a must. Bring them to room temperature before sauteeing. They are truly yummy with the tarragon, but I'd bet fresh sage would be good, too.

I wouldn't make again. It was bland, mushy, and visually unappealing.

Made this a while ago and found I didn't review it. This was an amazing recipe and got raves all around. I made a day before except for adding egg, added before making pattiees - just being over cautious. I had no problems keeping the patties together

This is an excellent risotto, but it's far too much trouble trying to keep the patties together in a fry pan. I'm really sorry I didn't follow other recommendations and bake in the oven - I think it's perfectly suited to baking.

Absolutely delicious! The hard part is trying to remember to make the mixture the day before! I took the advice of others and put the patties back in the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking and I also baked them in the oven (gave them a quick spray with olive oil - baked in moderate oven 30 minutes until golden). I don't think I'd even bother trying to pan fry after the comments of others. Served with pork fillet with pear & apple sauce. Will also do them as a side for a BBQ in the future. Worth the effort.

These are delicious. I made these the morning of the day before Easter. Then before going to bed I made the patties which were fairly solid by the next day. I cooked them in canola oil on higher heat as well which helped them hold together. I found the tarragon a bit overpowering, so might eliminate the next time. Served these with the marmalade-glazed ham with orange tea sauch.

This takes a while but well worth the trouble. I used grapeseed oil rather than butter to fry the cakes and the higher temp. helped to form a crispy crust which held the risotto together better.

As a side note to my previous review, if you decide to add additional pecorino to help the patties "stick" together, be careful to cut down the salt and consider using a salt free chicken broth, as this cheese adds a VERY high salt flavor, and this is coming from a major salt lover.

I have prepared this twice. First time used as a side dish in one of the cooking classes I teach along with oven roasted salmon. Last night prepared along with stuffed pork loin for a catered party. Always gets raves. The second time, after chilling overnight I formed the cakes and then chilled again for an hour or so before cooking and I think they held shape a little better. Highly recommended.

These were absolutely delicious. I made the mixture a day ahead and baked the patties on a parchment lined baking sheet vs. sauteeing them, very easy too!!

I rarely have problems with recipes from this website, but I just couldn't get these things to hold together in the pan. Ultimately, I just mixed them all together and served it as risotto, which was very, very good. Next time I'll increase the heat and hope that helps them stick together better.

I've made these twice within the past few weeks. The second batch was much better b/c I increased the heat to high. The first batch had a tendancy to fall apart. Make certain to use a non-stick pan as recommended. I also added sun dried toms. Time sensitive but worth the effort!!

YUM!!!!

This was tasty, but I was still disappointed. I served them with the roasted wild mushrooms in red wine reduction (also Epicurious), and the delicate risotto flavor was lost. Next time I would serve them alone, or with a more subtly flavored wild mushroom dish. They do get a nice golden brown color and crisp outer texture when fried in butter.

This is a great make ahead dish when you are having people over for lunch/brunch. I've already made it a few times. I just serve it with a tossed salad and cold white wine.

It's so good as regular risotto, why bother making the cakes? Great side to boeuf bourguignon.

Fantastic!!! Do make sure you cook it down as mentioned before. When you think it's enough, cook it a few minutes more. The flavors are amazing, everyone raved!!

This is a wonderful make ahead dish for a brunch buffet. I made the patties half dollar size for ease of serving, and they were delicious.

Easy, delicious and make ahead. Important to cook this down as instructed or it will be too moist to make into patties. But, this would be just as good served as typical risotto (not in patties). We served this with a grilled beef tenderloin, bordelaise sauce, etc. Great meal.
