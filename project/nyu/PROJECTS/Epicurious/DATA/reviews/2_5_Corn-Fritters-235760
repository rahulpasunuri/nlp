Was so excited about the fresh corn from the market and corn fritters with beer battered fish - but I too had exploding corn fritters - did the corn need to be cooked first?

I must have done something wrong, but I would swear I measured everything perfectly, and I'm really pretty competent in the kitchen. The batter was very liquid, and it exploded/disintegrated into bits and pieces in the oil. Maybe I had extra-wet corn?

I was looking for a breakfast corn fritter recipe to use up a big sack of corn ears, and used this one, minus the garlic. It was pretty good! I used regular oil for frying to get away from the savory towards the sweet.

I grew up eating corn fritters, one of my grandmother's favorites. If you want a "cornier" taste, replace the wheat flour with masa harina (corn flour). It's what corn tortillas and tamales are made from, and it's available in the Mexican/Latin section of many supermarkets. Also, it's easy to remove corn from the cob using a mandoline if you have one (the small chopping blade can be used for grating corn for the other recipe).

Delicious...I would use olive oil and canola oil. It would allow a higher temp. Olive oil was smoking at 300. Fresh corn from the garden and homemade maple syrup. Yum.
