Made these for a festive looking Christmas brunch as an alternative to all the sweet things we normally eat. They were great, but needed several hands to put them together which was fun. Both salsas were good, but the green salsa was really outstanding.

I cooked up some chorizo and spread on a layer on the tortillas (under the egg) to get a little protein and add some other flavor. The recipe didn't say what to do with the onion so I added half and half to the puree mixture. When done added the layers I would pop it in the micro for 40 sec. to warm it up. By the time you add everything it just warm. Also I would buy a mini torch you use for creme brulee to toast every part of veggies. Do char the veggies ahead of time, it takes too long

WOW! Made this today for brunch, and served it with a black bean and corn salad. I told my husband that others suggested serving it with refried beans and after a quiet moment of contemplation, he said, nope, the black bean and corn salad matched perfectly .

Excellent breakfast/brunch recipe. The two salas are different yet complement each other and I agree the presentation is beautiful. Perfect dish to serve to guest. You can't go wrong with this one it's a sure crowd pleasure.

We had this two weekends in a row it was so good. If you have the salsas and "well fried" beans made ahead (a required accompaniment in our house)it is fast and easy. With some sliced avacado with lemon or lime juice and salt on the side it's wonderful. My husband says it makes his tummy happy!

I also serve this dish on two tortillas seperated by frijoles refritos....by the way most of you probably know it but refritos, doesn't really mean refried, it means "well fried"

This recipe is terrific. I make huevos rancheros fairly regularly, but I think this is my new favorite. It is a simple recipe yielding big results. I did as the previous reviewer suggested and included all of the onion in the red sauce alone. I served it up with a couple of slices of ripe avocado for a great dish.

This is a surprisingly easy dish to make. The only twist is the onion that never ends up in the salsa (where does it go?). I put half of the onion in each salsa, but I think maybe all of it should go in the red. My husband was crazy about this recipe. It looks just like the picture or better. I would serve this for brunch with margaritas.

From a delightfully surprised Mexican: excellent, mexican cuisine at its best. In Mexico dishes like this one and huevos rancheros, are eaten at "almuerzo", between 11 am and noon. Try this, instead of frying the eggs togethher, fry them one at a time and serve in an oval serving platter,each on a tortilla with their sauce with refried bean as a barrier in between them. Sprinkle the beans with cheese and put totopos (fried tortilla triangles) on them
