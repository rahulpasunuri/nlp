I know I know..don't review a recipe if you change it..BUT I was in a a great hurry to get dinner ready...so I marinated the fish in the curry red wine vinegar and low fat coconut milk. I sauteed the peppers, garlic ginger and onion together and put them over the fish. I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes..Excellent flavors..the sauce was a little thin but the rice soaked it up. ALl enjoyed and I was not rushed in the kitchen...steamed spinach on the side made a very pretty plate. Started with a choice of mixed green and veggie salad or corn/tomato soup. Ended with flourless chocolate cake or fresh melon.

I've had Thai and Indian curries my entire life--because my mom made them when I was young and now I order take-out. This is the first time I've ever made a curry, and I made it mainly because I buy inexpensive frozen wild salmon from Trader Joe's that desperately needs moisture--but it was so easy and flavorful and juicy. My only modifications were to use curry powder (which has all of the spices in it, though probably not in the same proportion), substitute light coconut milk for the high-octane version, and cook quartered white mushrooms with the red peppers.

I'm not big on salmon but need to learn to enjoy it for health benefits. I can enjoy it cooked like this, it was really yummy. And it was moist and cooked thru with this cooking method. I'd say it's great the way it is, but it would be OK to add other veggies as well such as mushrooms or snow peas or zucchini.

i had an accident which my husband says really made the dish (he pretends not to like fish): to save pans, i seared the peppers, removed them, and the pan was rather black (they had REALLY seared). so when i went to sear the salmon, it really did a 'blackened' number on it. i did slightly wipe the pan before doing the sauce (which was plenty thick- buy organic coconut milk) so that any overburnt taste wouldnt interfere. it didn't! it was all good, and my only change would be more cayenne or some chili peppers, just to give it a little more bite. but it was good as it was, really.

this was an okay dish - the sauce was a little runny, not quite what I'm used to for Indian food. The flavors were nice, just not very appealing in presentation.

Ick. As written, the recipe is bland, and the sauce is thin... yuck. I might try it again, but would double the spices and simmer the sauce a lot longer. I've had lots of luck with most recipes on this site but this one was a real dud.

I have been cooking my meals for just over a year, and this was my first experience cooking salmon. I put the salmon in the center of a plate, and surrounded it with rice and mixed vegetables. Food must not only taste good, but it must also be pleasantly presented. I felt the salmon would be tasty, but it was fabulous. I followed the cooking instructions to the letter. I look foreward to cooking and enjoying it again. Thanks!

I've made this recipe repeatedly since it first appeared. We enjoy spicy, flavorful foods and have added hot pepper to this dish for additional kick. It's a great salmon variation.

I made this dish for company (2) recently and they loved it. It is rather rich, but the fat in the coconut milk also balances the heat of the peppers. I had no liquid coconut milk in the house, so I used powdered coconut milk (available at Asian groceries) with good results.

Where did I go wrong? I made this after reading all the great reviews. It was very heavy, which I wouldn't mind if it had great flavor. Instead, the flavor was bland and muddled. I'm not sure where I went wrong, but I won't be making this one again.

Tasty for the eye and the tongue. When I'm in a hurry, I cheat and just mix Madras Curry Powder (has fenugreek, cumin, etc. in it) with the vinegar for the marinade. And most markets carry "lite" coconut milk, which works and has less of that nasty fat.

This is a very rich preparation of salmon. However, it was a BIG HIT when I presented it. I found the fenugreek seeds in an Asian market. I also saw them in Penzey's Spices, Internet and catalogue.

This is good but extremely rich - I usually eat pretty light and this dish was a bit hard on my digestive tract! I couldn't find fenugreek seeds anywhere. Their absence from the marinade may explain why it just seemed something was missing - I love spicy food and this was a tad too bland.

An excellent addition to any salmon lovers recipe file. I added a chopped serrano chili to the marinade to add some heat and make it more authentically Indian. Yum!

Wow. This was really good. Not light, by any stretch of the imagination, but very tasty. My wife suggests the addition of nutmeg in the sauce and having grilled pineapple on the side. Also, I'm planning on making this on kayak trips this summer. A great one pan meal.
