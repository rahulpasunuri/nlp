The sauce I made as is. I did not use the oven part. I seared the breast fat side down on med to med high heat till the fat was crispy then turned and cooked about 6 mins till duck was med rare.Drain all of the fat but 1 tbls.Return breast to pan fat side up.Turned the heat to low and added the cherry sauce and cooked about five more mins till med done. Removed breast from sause let rest 5 to 10 mins. Pour sauce into serving bowl and keep warm. Try it this way you'll be amazed at how good it turns out.

This was great although we accidentally over cooked the duck. Nonetheless we loved it and had lots of sauce left over that we used on a homemade ravioli the next night.

Note that the amount of curious flavorings (cumin, mustard, etc.) are quite subtle and the combo of tomato and cherries works out much better than we originally thought. The use of both cooked cherries (in the glaze) and fresh cherries added at the last minute is also a good touch. One change: The method of cooking the breast skin down in a tad of water does an excellent job of rendering off some of the duck fat, but leaves the skin too chewy. So instead of roasting in the oven for the final few minutes (which can also too rapidly run up the internal temp.), broil it to crisp the skin. http:// whatholtandbarbarahadfordinner.blogspot .com

I found the dish relatively easy to make and given that this was the first time I cooked duck -- it came out perfect. I'll definitely make this again. Now onto the quail!!

Let me start by saying that my wife is the cook in the family. She even gives cooking lessons with a friend who is a trained cook. I didn't have all the ingredients for the sauce so I had to improvise. My wife is not a big duck fan but she raived about it. It was great for my ego.

This was a perfect way to prepare duck on the stove top. The sauce was perfect for bar-b-que also. It took time to make the sauce but that was fine. Used sour dried cherries and sweet raisens instead of the bing cherries. My tomato and tomato paste were both pasted so subbed can of stewed chopped tomatoes and made a thick tomatoe rue out of juice. These worked prefectly. I pour a lot more wine in because we like it. Over all very, good indeed. Will make it again for Sunday supper.

two more additions to my previous review: 25 minutes is too long to cook this...my duck ended up overcooked. perhaps my burners on "low heat" were still too high and (2) what a waste of delicious cherries. my cherries were firm and dark and sweet, perfect for eating cold, and they stayed pretty firm, so not great in a sauce, I thought. perhaps softer, riper cherries would work better if I were interested in trying this recipe again and I'm not. not worth the effort.

I made this last night and liked it but it wasn't spectacular. The tomato flavor overpowered the cherries. Next time I make it(and I will because I think it can be improved), I will use a peach or plum(peeled) instead of a tomato and maybe brandy or port instead of apple cider vinegar.

For the effort, I have other duck recipes that are much simpler and 100 times more fabulous. This was only good and for anything that requires both blending and pushing stuff through a sieve, I say it better be outrageously/unforgettably good. Not so here.

Another thing that makes duck safer than chicken is that they are more difficult to pluck, so they are dipped in boiling water to loosen the feathers and that process washed off a lot of potential contaminates

I would have to admit to cheating a bit on the recipe. A favorite dish at Vespaio's here in Austin is their Duck with Fig Sauce. This looked like very close to the recipe they used, so I did substitute fresh figs for the cherries and it was fabulous! If anything, it was even better than Vespaio's dish! I also prefer medium rare or even rare duck, and cook it to 130 degrees, then rest it to let it come to full heat of 135. Unlike domestic chickens, ducks have not been so overbreed and raised in such terrible conditions that they have lost their immunities. My understanding is that the dark meated fowl, like chicken and quail are considered much safer than chickens and turkeys for that reason. I still treat them like nuclear waste, and scrub everything down, but only a couple of incidences of food poisoning over the years have been from duck, according the USDA.
