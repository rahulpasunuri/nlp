This was okay--my husband and brother in law liked it but I didn't even finish my portion. Quiche is better tasting and worth the extra work (and calories).

What do lentils have to do with eggs anyway? The lentils in this dish add nothing. They are virtually tasteless. The flavor comes from the red peppers, cheese and herbs which should definitely be added. (I used fresh oregano and fresh basil.) Nutritionally, eggs are already high in protein, which is also what lentils comprise, so... why add them? Will not repeat this one.

This was soooo easy and really delicious. I used Spanish brown lentils, threw in some dried oregano with peppers, poured a little half and half in the eggs, and mixed a little parmesan in with the gruyere. I made it while the bf was at the gym. He came home declaring that he wasn't hungry, starting sniffing around the kitchen, then proceeded to wolf down half the frittata. o_O

I would like to know what kind of I should use... I am Indian and we have so many kinds of lentils in our diet, and also I have used the french lentils on occassion as well...

This was easy, tasty and inexpensive (and a good way to use up our eggs -- we have hens). It also did not take up much of my time in the kitchen. The next time I make this I will add more seasoning, though. Some oregano and basil would add to the flavor.

This was great! I halved it for 2 people. I rinsed and sliced bottled roasted red peppers (and melted the butter into the hot lentils) which worked perfectly and was a good time saver. I also substituted Emmenthaler cheese for the Gruyere. It's such a nice combination of flavors and textures I will make this often for weekend breakfasts!

This dish turned out beautifully! I made it for brunch with friends, and there were NO leftovers. I can't think of anything I would change about this recipe, except perhaps to use more Gruyere cheese, but that's because I love the taste. This dish would also work for a light supper, if accompanied by a light salad and good bread.

The frittata smelled and looked wonderful. I made it the day before a birthday brunch, and it worked beautifully.

This recipe was wonderful! The second time I made it I did not use as many eggs in order to have more of a lentil and pepper taste.
