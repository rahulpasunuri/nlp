Forgot to mention: I'm much too lazy to peel fresh tomatoes. I have always used canned tomatoes in this recipe and decreased the tomato paste by half.

I've made this recipe several times and it never fails to satisfy. The only thing I've done to make it even more rich and delicious is to use homemade ricotta in place of the grainy store-bought stuff. But, even with store-bought ricotta it is well worth your time and effort. Also, the crepe and tomato sauce recipes are easily doubled, cooked and frozen for a quick second batch.

This was a really lovely dish. The Marinara sauce was just right; pleasant mix of flavors. The filling darn good; I am always thinking about how to kick something up a notch; goat cheese; some other special things; mushrooms, etc. but then it's not a traditional manicotti. And the crepes were so easy to make! For my own serving I added red pepper flakes to give it a little kick but I think that is a personal choice. I will make this over and over.

I enjoyed making and eating this dish. It comes together nicely. Crepes do take some time but well worth the effort. Don't worry that they are not all perfect rounds. Doesn't matter when rolled up and covered with sauce. Added onions to the sauce and a teaspoon of sugar to cut the acidity. Also used canned diced tomatoes. For two cut the sauce and filling amounts in half and made all the crepes to freeze half and play with the filling and sauce the second time around. Enjoy!

This was very good and the prep time can be cut down by using canned tomatoes. I also added roasted garlic to the crepes to give them a bit of flavor, but I imagine that adding it to the sauce or cheese would do the same. And I added sundried tomatoes. Of course, you can play with the filling to your liking. FYI: I cut the recipe down to 2/3 for two people. We still have three servings of leftovers.

Wow, I had been looking for something that reminded me of my grandmothers recipe and this is it. All except the prosciutto. I left it out and the recipe is still wonderful.

I made these for my mother's birthday. I was a little hesitant since I had never made crepes before but they turned out to be alot of fun.

Absolutely delicious! I used homemade marinara already on hand, but filling and crepes were made to the recipe. The prosciutto gives it some interest, but will probably experiment with spinach instead, for a vegetarian option. No more store bought manicotti shells! After a couple of tries, and a smaller pan, the crepes came out fine. Leftovers the next day were even better!

I'd misplaced my crepe recipe & was very pleased to find this one. They were wonderful & the cooking instructions made them easier than ever! I used my own sauce & filling for Christmas dinner & actually heard mmmmm from several family members.

Absolutely delicious! The crepes are so soft and envelop the delicious filling perfectly. I added one small minced shallot to the cheese filling. This is definitely a repeat and a special meal I will make for holidays/birthdays/etc...

I had to give this 4 forks because the result was so creamy with the crepes - no store-bought tubes!! They really are easy to make. I added frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry and used 6 ounces prosciutto (2 3-ounce packages) based on reviews. The only thing I would do differently is less salt in the marinara sauce because the prosciutto in the filling is salty. Served with salad and garlic toast for a great dinner for guests.

I have made this many times ...starting in 1990 when it was first published...it is light and delicious...I am making it for Christmas eve...18 years later and I am still serving it! It is great!

This was fabulous. I am allergic to cow milk protein, so instead of the cheese, I used my typical tofu mixture: 10 ounces spinach, chopped + 1 pound Tofu + 1 teaspoon salt + 1/2 teaspoon black pepper + 1 teaspoon oregano, dried + 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg + 1/2 c nutritional yeast. For the cheese topping, I used buffalo mozzarella. This freezes really well also. The prosciutto gave it a unique flavor. It was delicious and healthy (with tofu instead of cheese).

Did anyone else feel that the crepes were bland? They were awful. I got my recipe for savory crepes from The Joy of Cooking and used the rest of the recipe. Yipes.

So incredibly easy and good although I'm not sure how this would feed 8. I was about to make 9 rolls. I substituted bacon lardons for prosciutto.

Absolutely fabulous! I made this dish for my family and some very picky friends-everyone loved it! the crepes are a MUST. I prepared the crepes and filling the night before and made the sauce the day of using home canned tomatoes, I also substitued the pancetta with blanched bacon. I can't wait to make this again!

I made this but used premade manicott shells instaed of making the crepes. I think that this receipe must be better with the crepes. Next time, I will take the time to make the crepes and see how it comes out. The cheese filling was very good.

I was daunted by the other reviews (too time consuming, etc.) but decided to give it a go--crepes and all. I made it for my husbands birthday lunch, he loves cannellonis. I started at ten in the morning, took a shower while the sauce simmered and the crepe dough rested, and had the dish in the oven by noon. It turned out grrrreat! It is now my husband's favorite italian dish in my repertoire. I followed the recipe exactly, and think that the prosciutto added a subtle flavor and texture that I would have missed. Also, my mother in law couldn't stop commenting on how delicious it was. I highly recommend this recipe.

Made this last night and really liked the sauce--it turned out great. I used a 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes (including juice) which I chopped, and I added white wine and hot italian pork sausage which I pre-cooked mostly through. I thought the filling was pretty good too--I skipped the proscuitto though. I would agree with another reviewer that this recipe was pretty time-consuming.

This dish was extremely time consuming. I prepared it over 3 days - made the crepes on Friday, the sauce and filling on Saturday, then assembled and ate it on Sunday for a dinner party. When no one asked me for the recipe, that told me all I needed to know. Too much trouble for a mediocre dish.

This is a pretty good recipe for manicotti. My husband and daughter absolutely loved it! Both had 3 helpings. I, being a very critical food connoisseur, thought it was only better than mediocre. The crepes do make all the difference in the world, however the flavor of the chopped prosciutto is lost. I would make this again, but would probably use sliced prosciutto layered on the crepe rather than chopped in the cheese mixture. Another alternative would be to omit it completely and save $2.50.

This was a huge hit in my house and for the two bedrest neighbors I made it for! It keeps beautifully in the freezer and believe me, once you make your own crepes you will never go back to storebought manicotti. A delicious and flavorful dish.

Made this for christmas and everyone raved saying it was the best manicotti they ever had. It is very easy, but time-consuming. I made the sauce and crepes in advance and froze them until the day before. YOU MUST MAKE THE CREPES and use any filling (I didn't add the prosciutto)or sauce you want, but the homemade crepes is what makes this dish!

My husband's favorite food is manicotti and I've been looking for the perfect manicotti recipe to make for him. I was hopeful this might be it ~ the recipe sure =sounded= good on paper. Sadly, though, I'm still searching. I expected this to be =much= better based on the reviews here. Don't get me wrong, it was okay ~ everyone in the family liked it well enough and ate it ~ but it wasn't anything to rave about and I probably won't make it again.

The crepes are so much easier to stuff than the traditional pasta, and so yummy too. I made this for my in laws and they were so impressed.

I'm mainly rating the crepes, since I substituted the ricotta and spinach from another cannelloni recipe on epicurious. The crepes were wonderful, though - much better than dried pasta sheets or shells. converted it from a weeknight dinner to a dinner party dish for me. the guests raved, and the leftovers were awesome.

This recipe is great. I didn't use the sauce suggested, instead I made my grandmother's spaghetti sauce & meatballs and let them simmer all day. WOW! It all turned out mouth- watering yummy!!!! It didn't take too long to make the crepes, and are definitely a must for this dish. DO NOT USE STORE BOUGHT SHELLS OR BOTTLED SAUCE!!! just would not make sense to cheapen such a wonderful recipe!

I had to give this two forks as in my opinion it was just so-so. Found this dish to be alot of work to prepare which I don't mind if I am pleased with the outcome but I was not thrilled with this one. On the other hand, I loved the sauce and will make that again soon to go with a different dish - maybe a beef manicotti!

This was very good. I agree that taking the time to make the crepes is a must. I also added fresh steamed spinach to the crepes before adding the ricotta filling - YUM!

This was super. I have made this dish two times; the first time I used an old family meat sauce recipe instead of the reccommended sauce. The meat overpowered the dish and it was only so so. When I used the perscribed sauce, the result was fantasic: just the right amount of acidity.

I'm 2 weeks short of delivering a baby so I cheated and didn't make the crepes. I used store bought tubes, but it was still great. I used a pastry bag to fill the tubes. That was real time saver. I made up an extra batch to freeze and bake later. I put the mozzarella on the top of the sauce instead of inside the tubes.

Really, really good. I personally used a different tomato sauce--one with red wine and soft-cooked eggplant and tomatoes and herbs--to pour over the top. I added some minced onion and omitted the egg from the filling, and I have to say, the filling was the star of this--flavorful, and very very good w/the parsley and prosciutto. I'd use the filling in a lasagna someday as well.

Great recipe. Been making our own manicotti for years. Try a package of cooked chopped spinach squeezed dry to the cheese mixture and eliminate the proscuitto. Freezes well for later use.

Listen to me, folks... take the time to make the crepes! My family has been making manicotti this way, the correct way, forever(Mother is Sicilian). You do not need to use a blender to mix the batter, and the batter does not need to sit for 30 mins... trust me. Make sure your crepes are thin... that's what a crepe is, otherwise you're working w/ pancakes! they should overlap slightly. Crepe manicotti tastes like heaven... you'll throw away your store bot pasta shells immediately. Oh, and DO NOT use egg roll wrappers... what's wrong w/ some of you?

I enjoyed this recipe. I personally enjoy some ground beef in my sauce, so I think some ground beef would have given it that extra kick I was looking for. The prosciutto didn't really do it for me in this recipe (although I LOVE the stuff). It was hidden by the other flavors. I think this would also be a great vegetarian recipe sans the prosciutto and ground beef. That said, I would definitely make this recipe again. Next time I would divide the preparation over two days though. The entire recipe took me about 3.5 hours from start to finish... and I was pretty pooped by then!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Didn't have time to make the crepes so used manicotti noodles. Want to try adding spinach to the filling next time as someone had tried before. This is a true keeper!

Wow!!! Wonderful! I used honey baked ham instead of proscuitto(just try finding that in N. Iowa), added some spinach, used egg roll wraps as someone suggested, and a great sauce from a jar to save time. It was still a pleaser. Raves!

I get 30 crepes when I make this. Everyone I have served this to, adults and children have LOVED these manicotti without meat. These also work well with 4 oz. of thawed spinach mixed in the filling. I always double the filling and sauce and prepare 2, 9 x 13 pans of crepes, rather than freeze the manicotti. I add the extra sauce just before baking. Any spaghetti sauce will do, but this is a good one offered.

Great flavor and smooth taste. All the cheese and sauce made it very filling recipe. It seemed very time consuming to make however...but worthwhile if you have the time. I would prepare the batter for the crepes first next time, since the batter has to sit for 30 min.

This was really good. Make the crepes small because if they're too big the dough overlaps when you roll them and the manicotti is a little "thick" in crepe. Loved the proscuitto and didn't use as much as the recipe listed -- next time I will use the whole amount. This looked impressive as well and re-heats well. We just made sauce using Trader Joes (CA store) marinara as a base -- adding garlic for flavor. A fun recipe to make with your date!

This is an amazing, fresh and simple recipe!!! I used store-bought shells, and because I wanted to save the expensive tomatoes I had purchased, I diced only a couple and mixed them with a huge can of crushed (for texture). Because of all the liquid in the can, I put two cans of paste instead of one, and the thickness was just perfect! I also put about eight basil leaves (I could have put more!) instead of five for a more enhanced flavour, and a few extra garlic gloves. I cannot wait to make this with homemade manicotti! Also, I substituted fresh spinach for the prosciutto and used a full tub of ricotta (because I had so many shells). I also used mozerella instead of Romano. The flavour is so fresh and wonderful~ I have found simple recipes to be best, and this one proves it!

I used the "store-bought" manicotti shells and found the dish to be delicious. I tried the crepes and found them to be too heavy

Fantastic! The second time I used canned diced tomatoes for the sauce, prepared manicotti, and substituted Italian sausage for the prosciutto. These changes were simply a time saver. The recipe is perfect as it is! Wonderfully delicious.
