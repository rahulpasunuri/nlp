Great idea. Made my potatoes and added cream cheese, sour cream & 1 beaten egg. Used black caviar for eyes. Yum.

Found this recipe from the Coquille St Jaques (scallops) recipe that you need great mashed potatoes for. I followed the recipe extremely closely, even weighed the potatoes to make sure it would turn out,and also found it to be quite 'soupy'. So the mix went into the fridge, then freezer for about 15 minutes to cool off so that I could mold it. It stayed where I wanted it to, Taste is terrific!

Just use black peppercorn for the eyes, it's much easier! Also, didn't use a rice mill and they still turned out great.

Tasty and fun. Takes some time and strength to peel, rice, etc - would have done them the day before or earlier. Easily serves 8.

We made this again this year for a spooky dinner. It looks and tastes terrific. We have never had any problems with the recipe, following it as written. BTW, we use tweezers to place the seeds as eyes - I think it took about 5-10 minutes. My husband even did it so the ghosts faced out in all directions - very cool

I made this for a Hallowe'en Party and it was gone before I had a chance to taste some. The kids loved it! (Even the picky eaters, but how could they not--it's just mashed potatoes!) Does anyone have an easier solution for the eyes? It was very time consuming and tedious to put the seeds on the eyes but they looked great. I'll definitely make it again next Halloween. I gave it top forks for presentation.

I made this recipe for Easter. Insted of ghosts I made bunny's it worked out fine. I added minced cooked bacon and minced garlic. It was a big hit.

Nice presentation, but I didn't think these ghosts tasted very nice - I made them earlier in the day, they might be better if made and cooked in one go. Still, they were good looking enough to do again at Halloween.

These ghosts were such a cute addition to our Halloween theme dinner party. I had no trouble having them stand in peaks when I piped them into the dish. They tasted great, too! I'll make them every year.

A very nice presentation -- always gets a smile from my guests. I never had trouble making the ghosts until one year I decided to double the recipe. Trust me, don't double the recipe.

This recipe should be called Duchesse Potato "patties" I followed the directions exactly and when I piped the ghosts out of the pastry bag they went flat. I tried putting more egg yolk in but that didnt seem to help. After I relized that there were not going to be any ghosts, I sent my husband to the store for some cheddar cheese and black olives. I spread some of the potatoes on the bottom of the dish and covered with grated cheddar and finely chopped black olives. Put on more potatoes and in a "black and orange" striped pattern, alternated cheese and whole ripe olives on the top. Baked in oven at 400. With all of the extra eggs that I used, the dish puffed up like a souffle. Everyone Loved it! You never can go wrong with cheese and potatoes anyway. I won't make this recipe again. However, I will use the one I ended up with. yummm!
