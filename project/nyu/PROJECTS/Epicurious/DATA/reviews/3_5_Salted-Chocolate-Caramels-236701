I cooked until temp reached 248 (per others' suggestions) and the caramels were perfectly firm and chewy. I used freshly ground sea salt because I couldn't find the other and they were still a big success.

My caramels turned out perfectly, but i did NOT cook the sugar for 10 minutes. If you do, it will probably make the candies very hard. I just judged it by color and they turned out beautifully. I did, however, put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes before cutting them. It made handling them much easier.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe to a T with one exception - I cooked the caramel 'til about 248 degrees, not 255 since many of the reviewers complained that they were too hard at that temperature. They came out at a perfect consistency at 248. My final piece of advice - when cooking the sugar/water mixture at the beginning: DO NOT STIR. If you need to push the sugar around a bit to get it to dissolve that's OK, but you really shouldn't need to stir too much. The more you move those molecules around the more likely the mixture is to crystallize and ruin the caramel. Make sure to add the butter at the end; it pulls the mixture together and the caramel just slides out of the saucepan.

Overall, an exceptional recipe. Not too sweet, and with the grown-up addition of the sea salt, it got rave reviews. However, I found that bringing the mixture up to 255 degrees F created a tooth-busting, filling-pulling, jaw-breakingly hard consistency that does not scream 'caramel' to me. I remade the recipe, this time following the 'caramel' setting on my candy thermometer: a 7 degree decrease to 248 degrees F. The outcome was awesome. Chewy, gooey and very much a caramel.

I didn't read the comments before making, and I should have. The caramels are very hard. Crispy, even. I make caramels A LOT - at least 1 batch/week. I've mastered the art, but not with this recipe. I should have stopped cooking around 245°. I will recook batch tomorrow with a cup of water and heat to only 245 to see if that works.

I followed the recipe and directions as written. I should have gone with my instinct and removed it from the heat earlier. I used two different thermometers and removed it from the heat at 247. They are quite hard. Definitely not caramel texture. I'm not sure where the problem arose, but definitely do not rely on the temperature to let you know when it is done. My normal method for candy making is to test the candy in cold water, but I didn't do that in this case. Lesson learned.

This recipe was easy and turned out very well. They're not too sweet and the salt is a nice contrast that brings out the chocolate flavor. Next time, I may try to reduce the butter slightly since the caramels seem oily. Also, they're not kidding when they say leave the stuff in the bottom of the pan. It sets up to a hard shell and will ruin your caramels. Also, I must have cut mine smaller because I got over 100 pieces in portions that seemed generous for the richness of the candy.

I almost always follow the recipe as it is written the first time I make it. However, I simply couldn't imagine boiling chocolate. So I stirred it in after removing the caramel from the heat and it worked fine. No scorching. Lovely gloss, delicious.

While these are melt in your mouth delicious, they were a bear to get off the wax paper. Really sticky, so maybe I didn't do something right. I substituted Maine maple syrup for the corn syrup.

These were great! I was nervous after reading all the reviews. I've never made caramels before so tried to consider much of the feedback previously posted. First, I used my cheap regular non-stick pot that is not particularly heavy but did not stop stirring.. EVER. This certainly added to the total amount of time it took to reach temp but I had no problems with burning or sticking at all. I followed the advice of one reviewer and got the temp to about 350 and then after adding the chocolate I got the temp back up to about 235-240ish. I also cut down on the butter by 1/2 tbls. My caramels where not overly buttery and had a very nice texture. I think I'll get the heat up even a slight bit more next time because they were just a bit softer than I really want them... but still great. Due to the constant stirring the heating process took about an hour.

I want to say right off I've only made caramels three times. Each time the caramels did not turn out the same for a variety of reasons: humidity, inaccuracy of temperature etc. Now how to fix them! My caramels. came out too hard. This apparently was due to cooking them to too high a temperature after the cream was added. It actually evaporated too much of the liquid in that batch! The fix was to put the hardened caramels back into the pan and re-heat slowly. Add a splash of water or cream. Cook to the proper temperature 248. If the caramels are too soft then I imagine you have a bit too much liquid and you can remelt and bring them up to the proper temperature a second time and re-pour. It seems that caramel may be difficult to get perfect every time but easy to fix! The 2 most common problems: too hard/too soft are fixable by re-cooking the batch. I also am getting used to using the water test for an accurate preview of how hard or soft they are so I can trouble shoot them before I pour. Good luck!

The 2 teaspoons of salt are for sprinkling on top, you are only supposed to put 1/4 tsp. of regular salt into the candy while cooking - it sounds like perhaps you put the sprinkling salt into it. Mine were delicious, I loved it! I wrapped them in wax paper and gave them as gifts to my co-workers.

Not at all impressed with this recipe. I followed all directions but the caramels for me were off in terms of consistency and taste. 2 teaspoons of salt was, in my opinion, far too much and while I love the pairing of sea salt and chocolate, I found these far too salty.

My first thought upon biting into the caramel was 'tootsie roll'. That's what it tasted like. I think I just prefer my caramels plain. Or DIPPED in chocolate. But not made with chocolate.

I have never made candy with a candy thermometer before and this recipe was relatively easy. I got distracted and let the sugar burn the first time and had to redo the sugar part, but if you pay attention the process should go smoothly. The flavor of the caramels is amazing! The salt and the sweet balance play off each other really nicely; it's like heaven in your mouth. I will definitely be using this recipe again to make candy during the Holidays.

Just some tips - don't try and melt chocolate chips or chunks, they have stabilizers that won't allow them to temper properly. Also when making caramel don't stir constantly it won't melt properly.

Rating: 4
Reading the previous reviews definitely helped making this recipe. While I did use a candy thermometer, I relied more on the cold water test and set a timer so I could check the progress every few minutes once the chocolate mixture was combined with the sugar. I was pleased w/the way it came out and will be making for holiday gifting. I just used regular old sea salt, but next time will buy a higher quality to use.

This is the first caramel recipe I have ever tried. I have made it twice now, and while the result is DELICIOUS, I haven't been able to get the texture right. I was hoping that the resulting caramel would slice easily into neat squares that could be wrapped or displayed and have a nice, clean look to them. When I cut, however, the caramel softens as I cut, and the butter seems to seep out of the caramel. I had to refrigerate the first batch to keep the squares from oozing into puddles of buttery chocolate. (temp 255) I made them again tonight, and heated them to 260, because I read online that the hotter it gets, the firmer the result. I stirred in the butter off the heat, and everything looked fine, but again, when I cut into the caramel, the butter started to ooze everywhere. What am I doing wrong???

This worked perfectly the first time. They are like Tootsie Rolls for adults. Very fun and Very easy.

I used Ghiradelli chocolate made for dipping, which resulted in caramels that set up to a consistency (and flavor) very much like Storck Chocolate Riesen. Pretty tasty, and they have held for a good three months cut and wrapped in wax paper (and stored in a glass jar).

If you're a lucky person, give this recipe a shot. My first try I followed the advice of the reviewer that stated that she made 12 batches of the caramels and I pulled them off the stove at about 228. They never solidified. Then I did some research online. I came across a culinary institute of America recipe that said to cook them until they reach 240 or soft ball. (They also recommend stirring in the butter at 230, and this worked well.) This batch of caramels did set up, but they were much softer than any caramel that I've ever eaten. I was not that happy with the texture, but I went ahead and made another batch because I needed two batches, and I did not have enough time to start over again. I cannot imagine cooking this candy much beyond 240, because at this temperature the candy started to form a burnt layer at the bottom of the pan. In the future I will try a different recipe. If you try this recipe, then I suggest that you start early and use cheap chocolate until you can get the texture that you want. And really, I got many more complements on the mixed nut spiced toffee and the coconut marshmallows from this site.

I didn't have any trouble making this fantastic recipe, as I've made different caramels throughout the years. Here are some tips: Use a Le Creuset pot or a heavy-bottomed pot if you can. These things heat evenly and slowly, so there's less of a chance of scorching or for the caramels to come to temperature too quickly. These pots are also ideal if you have an electric range. Calibrate your thermometer. Others have noted that the water test works well, but you should also make sure your candy thermometer is on target. I use a digital thermometer with little problems. I like my caramels to melt in your mouth yet have a soft chew to them. I heat the mixture to about 243 degrees, then finish with butter off of heat. This is in the "firm ball" stage. Anything higher than 250 degrees is the "hard ball" stage and that is where you start getting the hardened caramels (which some people like!). There is no right or wrong, it's just what you prefer. I believe the problems people are having with the separation of fat is because the temperature is rising too fast or is too high. Slow and steady wins the race here. Constant stirring also helps to keep things in tact.

Very disappointing. It smells great cooking but to quote my husband, "tastes like salted plastic". Pretty easy to make.

This recipe worked like a charm in Tucson, AZ, but when I moved to a higher altitude I ended up with a brick with each and every attempt! No matter the adjustments, this was a complete disaster and waste of expensive chocolate. Too bad, because when they turn out, they are excellent, just not at 5000 feet ASL!

After a few tries (alright, 4!) I think these are delicious. I prefer them somewhat softer so that you're not just sucking on salt until the thing softens up in your mouth. At 5000' and low humidity, 245F is the perfect temperature for me. As far as cleanup, this is another reason to love All-Clad! I just soaked the pan in hot soapy water and it cleaned right up. Same with the wooden spoon I used to stir. The first batch I made was really greasy because I don't think I stirred the butter in well enough. The second batch got way overcooked because my thermometer had water in it. For the third batch, I completely forgot the butter and they still were fine; for the most recent batch I used 2Tbs instead of 3 and stirred and stirred and stirred until it was all absorbed (with the heat off, of course). I haven't actually tasted that batch yet, but it looks great and is "soft to the fingernail". If you are hesitant about these, make them first with some cheaper chocolate, like Ghirardelli. Also, lay out a strip of parchment paper and once you get to 225F, put a dab of caramel on the parchment paper every 5 degrees. Then, even if they don't turn out perfectly the first time, you'll have a good idea of what temperature produces the texture you like. (I did this because I'm a scientist and because I had basically zero candy-making experience.) Good luck!

Having made this many times with raves each time, I must say that it is the flavor that saves the day. As has been previously noted the perfect texture can be elusive, but I think one major factor is being overlooked. The color/temperature of the simple syrup (sugar & water) stage has a big influence on the 'brittleness'. It seems counter intuitive but the more 'golden' the color, the softer the end result will be. The 'greasiness/butteryness' can also be an issue. Beating in the butter finish until first the gloss & then the shine disappears, should resolve that. The grind of the Sea salt is important as well. Fine grinds will offer too much by the teaspoon. Maldon comes in a much more coarse grind & should be applied in that fashion. Finally, I believe that there a different perceptions as to what texture a 'caramel' should be. I believe these treats should be savored by dissolving on the tongue as opposed to chewed & gulped. Closer to toffee than "Tootsie Rolls". This requires the high "firm ball" temp of 248F to the middle "hard ball" 255F that the original version calls for. The problem is you really don't know until it is cooled & set if what you have is what you want. Stick with it & whatever you do don't leave off the chunks of salt, the lingering saltiness that I find so refreshing as an aftertaste to the sweetness. I cook a lot & rarely return to a recipe that disappoints, but this is one that am very glad I did. CD

These are outstanding. I make them all winter long and the trick is to make sure to follow your instincts when you're cooking the final chocolate/sugar mix. I've found that when it's ready the mixture will start to hold together and pull away from the sides of the pan/fall away and not stick to a rubber scraper. This can happen anywhere between 245 and 255 depending on relative humidity, quality of chocolate, etc. so once it gets close to temperature, keep an eye on it and don't always trust your thermometer. Unfortunately not every batch I've made has been perfect but the ones that have turned out well have been amazing. Everyone I've given them to loves them.

I read all the reviews before I started. Here is what I did. I poured caramel (big pot) into ganache (smaller pot) because the smaller pot was rounded and had less surface on the heat, so hopefully less chance of burning. Plus I didn't want to chance ruining my always-in-use big Le Creuset pot. And then I stirred. But *all* the fat came out of the chocolate and I thought the texture was awful and I'd have to throw it all out. I stopped at 240 degrees, mixed a while longer and then poured out as much fat as I could. I just didn't see how all that fat would find its way back into the mass. (I had added ~1tbsp of butter, but that went out with all else.) Resulting caramels are fairly soft and chewy. I wish I had poured out *all* the fat because they are still a bit greasy, and that I had poured the mass into a smaller pan so that the caramels would be thicker. They seem to be quite good, but I think they'll improve after some refrigeration. If there is next time, I am going higher on the temp. I wonder if anyone else had this separation of fat, and whether one can take it out while still cooking, as that hot sputtering oil can be quite dangerous.

I have been looking to recreate the taste of the chocoate covered salted caramels sold at Trader Joe's only at Christmas. Trying to reduce sugar I substituted half of it with Splenda and got a creamy not hard candy. No matter, we scraped it out of the pan and loved it. Will play with temps next time.

This is a nice recipe, but I wasn't bowled over by it. I wanted to make chocolate for Valentine's day that didn't involve tempering or making fudge (which is tricky), and this fit the bill. I'm not completely sold on the idea of the salt on top -- it somehow wasn't as delicious as, say, chocolate-covered pretzels. Also, when I finally found the flaked salt it cost $7.00 for the box, which in retrospect didn't seem worth it. The recipe itself was easy enough to make and it was very good -- just not super-impressive.

These were awful. They turned out really hard (yes, I used a thermometer), and the salt is way too much if you use a regular fleur de sel (maybe 2 tsp. Maldon is much less). A waste of good chocolate and cream.

These caramels were over-the-top delicious. When I first tasted them I felt like I was in heaven! The salt really does it. I used fleur-de-sel. I did have trouble getting the temperature right, so as soon as I experienced my first difficulty I went out and got a better quality thermometer. After that I found the recipe to be perfect. I will be making these again and again.

Very good, extremely easy. I loved the crunch of salt on top of the candies, and finally had my husband hide them from me until the day I made my cookie/candy trays for gifts. Everyone else loved them, too. I find that, after the pan cools, all you need to do is fill it with cold water and let it stand for a few hours. The hardened stuff melts right off.

DELICIOUS... the salt really brings dimension to the caramels. My only blunder.. I had to make the sugar-water-corn syrup combination twice, as it goes from 'deep-golden' to burnt very quickly... other than that they are very easy to make and seem perfect at the hard-ball stage using an ice-water bath, which was about 255 F.

So it took two tries-- the first time I was paranoid about the temperature after reading everyone's reviews, and I pulled it off the stove too early. Needless to say, I ended up with goo... it was delicious goo, but not what i was hoping to have. So the second try I doubled the recipe, and heated it to 250 (maybe a little higher), pulled it off the stove, and added the butter (used the same amount the recipe called for). Worked perfectly!

Don't give up on this recipe. 1) I read a french recipe for chocolate caramels, which said that for complicated reasons, there is a wide temperature variance, starting at about 225 and going to 255 or maybe 260. Altitude and humidity really change this recipe. If you do not have the right climatology, 255 is probably way too high for you. Do the ice bath test starting as low as 225. Try it until you get the texture you like. 2) Temperature control is hard to maintain, especially if the candy is heating too fast. Your thermometer might read 255, but in a few seconds its jumped a few extra degrees. It should take between 15 and 30 minutes to get it to temperature. For me that meant "low" on the stove not "moderate." And if you have electric, you have even less control than you realize. (While I was making the caramel I answered the phone. You know the rest!) I read a site that suggested dunking the bottom of the pot in ice water to stop the temperature from rising any further. I haven't tried it yet. I also read a recipe that stated slow heating for 30 minutes or more! is absolutely essential. 3) I cut the amount of butter by a little more than half, and I am glad I did. They were plenty buttery. 4) I don't think these are intended to be what is called a "soft caramel" so if you want them that soft , watch your temperature, or find a true soft caramel recipe. 5) The salt is fantastic. The taste is very very good.

I have made these several times and have not encountered any problems. I cooked them to 243 degrees and they were just the right consistency when I cut them. In one of the batches I made, I did try and substitute a bittersweet chocolate with 70% cacao and it did not work, they came out very hard and brittle. Everyone has raved about these if they enjoy dark chocolate and savory things.

I have made this recipe for the third time recently and find each batch gets better. I do watch the time and temperature very closely but love the whole taste experience. I also stir in a rounded Tablespoon of chili pepper flakes just before pouring into the pan and love the subtle warmth after the bite of salt and chocolate.

I read the reviews about five times before I attempted these. It was my first time making candy and I used a non- stick pot. I only cooked the mixture to between 245 and 250. After they cooled to room temp they were still kind of soft so I popped them in the fridge to harden up. I then took them out and cut into pieces. They're great! Because I used non-stick (not sure if that's a no-no with candy making), I didn't have any issues with the mixture sticking on the bottom.

Boy, this was a disaster. I hate to bash any recipes on this site, because I've had so many years of wonderful success with Bon Appetit, but this burned miserably and ruined my cookware. It hardened to an inedible state - it would literally break someone's teeth if they tried to bite into it (seriously, it is like industrial glass block). I went back and read reviews AFTER the disaster and saw that quite a few others had the same experience - heating the mixture to 255 is obviously WAY wrong. Some cooks appear to have tweaked it enough to ensure success. Even so, I'm inclined to say that if the recipe is this unreliable, it should either be modified/corrected by Bon Appetit or removed. Following it as written is not only inedible, but also likely to destroy cookware. Sorry to post such a downer of a review, but it's honest, and I hope it will save someone else from having a similar experience. Too many other great caramel recipes out there to risk this one. Not to mention a waste of a whole lot of really great imported chocolate. Ugh!

Help. I just made these (they are cooling, so I can't rate them), but the residual caramel on the bottom of the pan was very thick after pouring it off and it is totally stuck to the bottom of the pot. I poured water into the pan to boil it, as usually works to remove things like this, but it just completely hardened it to the bottom of the pot and I cannot get it off! It is like 1/8" thick and solid, almost burnt onto the pan. Any idea how to remove this from one of my best pieces of cookware? It is a mess. I sure hope the caramels are good. Thanks in advance for any suggestions on this.

I read what the other reviewers said, but decided to take my chances and stay true to the recipe. First of all, these are delicious, but very hard. I cut them into small 1/2 squares so that they would be manageable. However, next time I will definitely take off the heat at 245 instead of 255. Oh, and testing your thermometer first is VERY IMPORTANT. I tested two of mine in boiling water to find that my candy thermometer was 20 degrees off! So, I used my Polder meat thermometer which required more attention as I had to hold it by hand, but it made the world of difference.

I made these for the first time this week, and they were amazing! I'm not sure why others have had problems -- I cooked them to 255 and they were the perfect texture for eating, though cutting them was a little bit of a challenge. I can't wait to make more!

I too have made this recipe three times now, and the first 2 times they were fine and I was wondering why everyone seemed to be having problems, but then I made them again this weekend and they turned out totally hard as a rock! I had to microwave them for a minute to get them soft enough to cut. the taste is still good, but i don't know why they are so hard-- i only heated the caramel to 240-245 this time based on all the reviews (can't remember what i did last time) and now i'm stumped. I guess relying on textural intuition seems better than exact temp, and maybe it's my thermometer, too. BUT I still highly recommend them and when they come out right they are incredible.

OK, so I have made this recipe three times now, all with different results. I made them last year, and like other reviewers, they were extremely hard, so I decided to take other poeple's advice and not bring them to 255. I brought them to about 240. The first batch I made, it seemed to take longer to reach that temperature. They turned out to be a really good "chewiness". The second batch I cooked to about 240, but it seemed to get there really quickly. The caramels were WAY too soft!!! Today, I made a batch, and lowered the temperature to try to cook it longer and still reach 240, and the caramels are very STICKY!!! Anyone have any clues as to why all of the different results???

the biggest problem I have with these is that I can't eat just 5 pcs... Thank goodness I give them away. The first time I made these they were very hard and chewy but still deliscious. The next time I did not trust my thermometer and did the water test. Much better. Agreed with some of the reviewers that when overcooked the taste was almost burned flavored, but I love the dark flavor of it all. the salt is an amazing touch. hmmm might try a chili powder in tomorrows batch...

I've made about 14 double batches of these in the past week. They are delicious and everyone I've given them to has raved. The only modification I've found necessary is I use only 1/4 of the amount of butter it calls for- they just end up being too greasy and messy if you use the full amount.

I have made these caramels several times since getting the recipe last year and get rave reviews at the office and everywhere else. I have never had a problem with burning or the temperature. I have to admit, that at 255 degrees, the caramels are hard, but certainly don't crack. They are just very chewey. I made them this week and, after I had all my ingredients ready to go, realized that my candy thermometer was broken. So, I tested the cooking carmel goo by using the cold water drop test. They turned out perfectly, as always, just a bit softer than usual, more like soft caramels. For those of you who are getting poor results from cooking to 255 degrees, make sure your thermometer is accurate by using a boiling water test. It should read 212 degrees in boiling water. If you want them softer, try dropping a bit of the good in ice-cold water every couple of minutes until the drops reach the desired firmness.

In the past 2.5 days I have made 12 batches of this candy for a charity event and I now consider myself somewhat of an expert. I am convinced there is a typo in the recipe. I think it should say you should boil until the caramel reaches 225, NOT 255! At about 15 minutes of boiling the caramel is at about 225 and at this temp it comes out chewy and soft. If you want it a little firmer take it to 230. I would say anything above 235 would be too hard (one of my first batches literally shattered like glass when I tried to cut it. I think I brought that batch close to 240). If your candies taste burnt you probably took the caramel too far (before you add the chocolate and cream). People LOVED these caramels and the sea salt made all the difference in the world. I will absolutely make them again, but maybe not for a little while. I am a bit carameled out right now! Try these....you will love them.

My thermometer may have been off, as I cooked them to the recommended temperature and found them to have a very slightly burnt taste. They were also VERY (as in tooth-breaking) chewy, and sweated/oozed butter as they stood, which did not make for an appetizing presentation. Since many people have given these rave reviews I will assume that the fault is mine rather than the recipe's-this was my first time making caramels.

I only made a half batch of these because of the mixed reviews I read here. I am pleasantly surprised with the results! I took the advice of many and made sure I cooked the mixture of medium heat- it went a little more slowly than it could have but I had more control over the temperature of the mixture. Also, around 240 degrees I took a little dollop of the mixture and tested its consistency and decided that it was plenty chewy for my liking. I thought htis receipe turned out great! Be sure to use a candy theramometer

These caramels are delicious! I made them for friends and neighbors for Christmas, and they keep asking for them. You do have to let the sugar caramelize into a deep amber - swirl the pot more if you think it's burning. I will definitely continue to make these!

Well add me to the list of brickmakers. This really sounded like a great flavor combination, and a nice twist on an old family favorite (my grandmother generally couldn't boil water, but made the most wonderful caramels every Christmas). Like many others, I felt the goo was verging on burning/scorching, and I did not achieve the recipe's 255F. And like Kallie(?), who gave a high rating and is befuddled by our ineptness, I used an accurate thermometer, a 5 qt Le Creuset, and followed the recipe's guidelines for time and heat. Very disappointing, though I may just try again since so many here liked it and some of the suggestions may salvage the next attempt. But again, very disappointing from Gourmet.

Wonderful. Sinful. Must haves. I did not let the temp get to 250. At 240 I took it off of the heat. Caramels were chewy and slightly stickey and good!

Really really delicious, but watch the timing before you add the chocolate and cream mixture. The recipe is somewhat vague on when to add these ingredients - it tells you to wait until the sugar is "golden". Wait longer than you think you need to, or else you will end up with hard caramels. Freezing slightly makes them easier to cut and allows you to avoid oiling the knife.

I really liked the flavor of the caramels but I think the temperature of 255 degrees was too high, they got hard. I could not cut them either and I microwaved them briefly to soften them enough to cut, they became hard again once they were cut. Most caramels cook to about 237 to 245 degrees. I will try this again at a lower temperature. They were still good but not what I call a caramel

This dish is time consuming, but not difficult and the results are great. A heavy duty pan will keep the temperature more stable, which is important to prevent the caramel from getting overheated. Agree with the prior reviewer about medium heat and a good candy thermometer. Sprinkle the salt on after about 5 minutes or it's to firm to stick. I did press some additional salt in after I cut them up. If you are going to serve them right away, they look pretty in petit four cups. Everyone who tasted them really enjoyed them. I'm on my third batch in one week. This is a keeper.

These are wonderful! Not too difficult, and really didn't take too long to prepare. They came out soft and perfectly buttery. It is important to keep the heat at moderate (which does not mean high!) in order to prevent burning the sugar and chocolate. I am amazed that so many people had trouble keeping them from burning. Make sure to cut and wrap them in a cool room to prevent them from melting. Delicious.

I have made this recipe twice and both times, these caramels turned out delicious. One of the girls at my work even calls them "crack caramels" because they are so addictive. They are wonderful

I too am a little shocked by the reviewers that ended up with a hard brick. My result was just opposite and I've received tons of requests for the recipe after giving them out as part of a Holiday goodie basket. Like the other reviewer who had good results, precision and patience are the key here. I too used an accurate candy thermometer, a MUST when making this recipe as well as using my 5 qt Le Creuset pan. (Any other heavy guage pan will work as well). With the proper equipment and patience, these caramels were worth the effort. I didn't not give 4 stars because they were a little greasy, but then again, they are caramels and not unlike other homeade caramels I've had in the past. They are also a bit time consuming with regard to making sure the temperature is spot as well as giving them enough

Yummy! Unlike other reviewers, I found this fairly easy to make, and had excellent results, although it does require patience. I am guessing that there are two primary causes of the problems that some other readers have had: 1)inaccurate thermometers and 2) pans thats are not heavy-duty, thus allowing the candy to burn. I calibrated my candy thermometer with boiling water before beginning the recipe, to ensure that accuracy. I used a 5-quart Le Creuset enamelled cast iron pot and stirred constantly over moderate heat. I did not scrape the bottom, leaving any burned bits on the bottom. I used the full amount of butter, and did not find the result greasy. My family loves these, and I am making a second batch for gifts (wrapped in wax paper suqares, along with the spoon cookies, another Gourmet recipe from Dec 2005, which I also highly recommend!)

Unfortunately, it turned out to be a hard block - can't even cut it. Perhaps it shouldn't be cooked to as high a temperature as other reviewers suggested. I'll try something else.

I ended up with a brick. I agree with the other reviews that probably the temperature was off. I kept stirring, though, to hit that 255-degree mark. I ended up cooking the caramel an extra 15 minutes because I figured it was more important to get it to the right temp. The pieces that slid off the stirring spoon tasted good, but I couldn't even cut into the final product - it was so darn hard. What a waste of good chocolate.

These did not turn out well at all. They were greasy, too hard/chewy, with a slightly burned taste. I can't imagine that tweaking the recipe would help it much.

I agree that the recipe may not require as much butter, but I made it as described and got nothing but raves; they melt in your mouth.

I tried this recipe twice and wasted a lot of time and money. I could not get the mixture to reach 255 degrees without burning. All I have left to show for my work is a ruined All Clad pot. I checked the calibration of my thermometer and it is correct.

After reading the reviews, I compared this recipe to Jacques Torres' soft chocolate caramels. After tossing my first effort in trash, I now think that this recipe is flawed in two different ways. First, to get soft caramels, only boil the caramel to 238 degrees (vs. 255). They come out with a very nice texture (this part of my effort worked nicely). Second, on the next try, I will not add the chocolate until the candy comes to temperature (per Jacques' recipe). My candies got tossed because they taste like the burned chocolate on the bottom of the pot. It took a long time to come to even 238, and the chocolate burned (despite frequent stirring), before it was finished. Also, on the next go round, I will only add 1T of butter.

I had no trouble with the recipe. I agree it came out greasy and I blotted the caramels. I would make this again for the holidays. Found it time consuming. One needs to stir and watch the pot. They were well received by my culinary group at the holiday cookie exchange.

I had no trouble with reaching the 255 degree stage and the texture and taste were great and exactly as they should be for caramels, but they're incredibly greasy from the butter. I've cut them into 1" squares and they look perfect but when you pick one up to eat it, it's so oily it practically slides out of your hand. I've blotted the oil on the exterior with brown paper, but the entire caramel is oily so it's not really a solution.

Ok........ I too made a huge mess of this! My house is full of smoke and I may have ruined my pan. I think the term "moderate heat" may be the culprit. Way before it got to 255 degrees it was smoking so much I couldn't read the thermometer. I used good, expensive chocolate too! Never this recipe again!

I tried a double batch of these today and it was a disaster! Caramelizing the sugar and making the ganache went fine but trying to get the chocolate and the sugar mixture to 255 degrees resulted in a burned mess. I used 2 thermometers and tested for firm ball stage using the old drop in water technique. Before the caramel reached 255 the fat separated out and when, in a last ditch hope of some magical kitchen chemistry, I added the butter, it became a molten grainy mass floating in fat, ugh! They sound so good, any idea where I went wrong?

I decided to make this with some trepidation after reading the first several reviews. I used a nonstick electric skillet rather than a 5-6 quart pot, which I didn't have. This made it a little difficult to get an accurate reading with the candy thermometer, as the amount of liquid was shallow, however I did cook for the approximate times mentioned at or near the temperatures mentioned. This worked well, resulting in chewy, tasty caramels. Maybe beginner's luck.

I think these are beautiful. The taste is great. I just finished making them and will see how they are tomorrow. I didn't have the flaked sea salt, just chunky sea salt, but what a great idea. I love sweet and salty together.

I was so looking forward to eat some delicious caramels. I too got a hunk of hard rock. The taste is there but what can be done to soften it. Some one will lose there teeth if they eat this-Any suggestions?

Unlike the first reviewer, I will stop at one try. I, too, made a chunk of glass and I was using two candy thermometers. It took much longer than the 15 minutes the recipe led you to believe. I ended up with pools of, I guess, butterfat after I poured it into the prepared pan that I absorbed with paper towels. After it cooled, I was able to "cut" a chunk off and, after microwaving it, it was soft, but still very chewy. I had high hopes for this one.....

This took me two tries. The first one I turned the mass of caramel into glass by apparently heating the sugar too far. I got a new thermometer and the second batch was great. Sugar is tricky stuff. The sugar/water mixture needs to be heated first to about 340 degrees before it turns brown, then after the chocolate mix is added it is heated to 255. Good stuff and makes a lovely gift when wrapped in fancy foil wrappers.
