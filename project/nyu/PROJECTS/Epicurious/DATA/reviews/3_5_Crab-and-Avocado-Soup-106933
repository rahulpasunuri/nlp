This was wonderful. Had to add a bit of salt and pepper to punch it up. It wasn't overly heavy. I think it would be good using shrimp as a s substitute for the crab.

I loved this soup. I pulsed the blender instead of blending it finely. I loved the texture of the avocados, chilis, crab meat, etc. I also wanted it a little hotter, so I may put 2 chilis in it. DO NOT USE CANNED CRAB MEAT! I made this mistake and although I loved the taste of the soup, when I came to pieces of crab, they were tasteless. If you can crack your own crabmeat, it would be divine. (I tried two different canned crabmeats and they were both tasteless-and for $4.00 a tiny can..) To summarize: This soups is delish! Canned Crabmeat is not delish. Next time, if I can't find crab, I may substitue shrimp or lobster, chopped.

GREAT!! my kids and husband loved it with crab and with chicken add the extra jalepeno it gives it a great kick. It was even better the next day after the flavor melded

Awesome!! Awesome!! I only changed the recipe in that I added a dash of dried red pepper - zipped it up and added a bit more color to the soup puree. We added croutons (from a great Emeril recipe) and we were sorry we did not double the batch. Won't make that mistake again - next time we double it!!

Love the silky avocado, sweet and plump lumps of crab, and all the other wonderful ingredients that balance this quick and easy soup.

Fabulous. And easy. Worth the effort of picking over the crab...

It's not worth making (with crab) unless you get really good crab meat. Good crab meat being rather expencive, I usually make this soup with chicken, substituting more chicken broth for the clam juice. Rotisserie chicken works best, I like it even better than crab.

This is a great warm weather soup. I used pasteurized crab instead of regular canned and it was fantastic. My friends loved it. It was suggested that it might be really good served cold. I may try that next time.

Pretty color, nice presentation with a little extra lump crab on top with the cubed avocado. Added extra jalepeno as one reviewer suggested, and used fresh MD blue crab. Excellent!

Fixed this soup last evening as first course in a "Crab Fest" and everyone loved it. I made it earlier in the afternoon up to the "add crab" and then reheated it before dinner. I used fresh dungeness crab from the Ore coast, added a little more lime juice and a couple of dashes of Tabasco to "snap it up a little". Next time I would add more jalapeno pepper. It was a beautiful color of green, looked great in my black bowls

This was so disappointing. One of the few recipes I have not cared for from epicurious.

Very good soup. I would recommend to put extra money for real crab meat as this makes the dish from good to great. Be gentle on the salt: bottled clam juice already has plenty!
