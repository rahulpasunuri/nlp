Delicious and easy. I made exactly as given and the fish was perfectly cooked, the flavor of the marinade interesting but not overbearing. A weeknight keeper.

This was so good! I made two pieces of swordfish so I could have one left over for lunch, and ended up eating it for dessert! I paired with toasted quinoa with mushrooms and sauteed garlic spinach. Amazingly easy and very tasty ~ excellent for those last minute dinner parties if you can get fresh fish.

Great flavor. My family loved it. I only marinated it for 45 minutes and it was delicious. You do not need to boil it down for a full six minutes. I checked after five an it was almost boiled down to a goo at the bottom of the pan.

good recipe but made a few adjustments. Had no time to marinate and did not have all the ingredients. Used juic of one lime, 2 tbsp of honey, 2 of soy sauce and no ginger. Marinated about 2O min. Had 3 medium filets. Heated up leftover sauce for just a couple minutes. Had to add a little water. just used a couple tsp of sauce on each filet. Everyone really liked them. I agree that the sauce is potent and a little goes a long way.

very tasty. I use my George Forman and my out door grill.

The marinade is great, but when made into a glaze i think it has too much acidity, maybe if a seperate glaze was made it would compliment the fish better. I also added some brandy to the marinade and it was great.

This was very good with the glaze served on the fish

I used Blue Marlin instead of Swordfish and I didn't marinate it. Basically, I put rice noodles in a pot of boiling water and while they cooked, I zested the peel of, then juiced, one lime. I used a thumb-sized amount of fresh ginger (which I squeezed through my garlic press). I mixed all of the ingredients together and spooned over my fish, then put it in the oven on a foil-covered cookie sheet to broil. While the fish was broiling, I took the, now cooked, rice noodles and sauteed them with the remainder of the glaze. Lovely dinner in fifteen minutes.

This was very good. Followed the recipe - marinated for about 1 1/2 hours and grilled the fish. Served the glaze on the side - glad I did because it is very intense - a little dap is all you need. Served with coconut rice and steamed spinach.

I followed the recipe exactly. While it tasted better than it smelled while cooking, the result was still pretty meh.

I think the sauce of this recipe overpowers the subtle flavors of swordfish. The marinade flavors do not go well together and are very strong. I do not recommend this recipe and was surprised by the positive reviews.

Rating: 3
This was good. I made the recipe as written ... sort of : ) At the last minute I added hot pepper flakes to the glaze to give it some needed heat. I only used a teaspoon of the glaze on each swordfish steak, any more than that and it would have been to much of a good thing.

Rating: 3
The glaze was amazing, but the swordfish was a little undercooked at the time the recipe gave. I kind of want to try the same glaze on tuna... I think it would be delicious.

Followed this recipe exactly for the marinade and glaze, but used mahi mahi and served with coconut rice. My fiance and I both thought that it was a tad bit too limey. Next time, I'll go easy on the lime juice. Also, the glaze is super strong and really overpowers the fish. Maybe with tuna or swordfish, the fish flavor would come through more. But I think maybe this would be good on chicken because the flavors are wonderful, just very strong.

Great, easy recipe. I loved it but forgot to sprinkle with salt and pepper , and marinated only for 1 hour. Still was delicious. The key is not to overcook the fish. Served with tropical fruit salsa and risotto. Marinade is a keeper and I highly recommend to use it as directed by the recipe - bring it to a boil and then pour it over the cooked fish. I saved the leftovers of the marinade, which I refrigerated in a glass jar, and used it to add to a shittakke mushroom risotto the next week. Cooked salmon the same way. Was good too.

Wild salmon was half the price of swordfish so I went with that, but there isn't much I wouldn't try this on. Great taste and so simple.

This has been my go-to recipe for swordfish and tuna steaks for years. Even without marinating the fish, the glaze adds great flavor. It is simple and delicious.

Made this with fresh Tuna steaks and then on the grill. Marinated for 4 hours, not too overpowering as another review suggested. Served with coconut rice ( Pioneer CA reviewer's version)from this site and mango salsa. My whole family loved it and that NEVER happens.

I actually made this dish with Ono fish, which is similar to swordfish but not quite as firm and much more flavorful. Served it with some good jasmine rice and steamed kale--went great, even my picky brother liked it!

This gets a split vote at our house. I prefer to taste the fish but my husband liked it so guess we'll have it again. Followed the recipe to the letter. It is simple to prepare.

I did this for dinner recently (used swordfish) and it was delicious. I did not change a thing except that I did not have fresh ginger so I used powder. They key I think, is not to overcook the fish and to really reduce the sauce so it's almost a syrop. Will definitely make again.

Excellent and so easy. How could this be BLAH if you just take a look at the ingredients. I halfed the recipe but added 4 drops of sesame oil and about 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili sauce. Taste it as you go.

I made this for sea trout and it was really very easy, very healthy, and very tasty. I would recommend for almost any firm white fish. Definitely a keeper for a fast supper.

This dish was not bad, but would need changes before I made it again. I used salmon instead of swordfish, which is an entirely different taste, but the major problem that I had was too much acidity in the sauce/glaze. Perhaps my limes were just very sour, but once it was reduced, it just tasted like a puddle of lime juice. Next time I think that I'll use half soy sauce and half lime juice, as well as a bit more honey.

Rating: 1
After marinating the fish, throw away the lime-ginger soup. Do not reduce to a glaze. I cubed the fish and grilled as kebabs over charcoal. The fish was okay, nothing to rave over. The reduction sauce was not good, and I can still taste and smell it the next morning after bacon and three cups of coffee. This one goes into the can. Definitely not a keeper.

This was very, very good. I usually steer clear of soy sauce and fish, but this has convinced me that it's a great combo. The lime/ginger flavor ratio was perfect.

One of my very favorite "dinner party" recipes. So easy and sooooo good! Always a big hit. I serve it with lime wedges and basmati rice. It's definitely worth indulging in a thick cut of fresh swordfish if you're using this recipe and can get it!

My family loved this. It's very easy. I think it would be good with other varieties of fish also. We grilled the swordfish on the Big Green Egg rather than broil it. The Big Green Egg makes everything fabulous!

This turned out great, the lime and ginger is a great compliment to the meaty swordfish steak, also great cooked on a charcole grill! Delicious!

The sauce was excellent; did not change a thing. However, I cooked the fish in a skillet, which worked just as well (though the glaze from the marinade left a hellish sticky crust in the pan, but that was a cleaning and not an eating issue). I am going to make this again as soon as possible.

fantastic and light dish. the marinade/glaze is wonderful. i didn't have lime peel on hand, so i automatically omitted it from the recipe. still turned out fantastic. tinker with it if you want to, but if you want to follow a recipe straight from what's written, you won't be disappointed with this one!

Outstanding and easy recipe. Although, I agree with cook in Los Angeles, the recipe could be enhanced by a bit of spice. I also served it with the coconut rice which complimented the swordish - thanks for the suggestion!

My kids aren't fond of lime recipes so I was hesitant to try this. But I wanted to try something different from the usual teriyaki so I went ahead with the recipe anyway. I marinated the swordfish for 3 hours and put the swordfish on the gas grill. The 3/4" steaks were cooked covered for 8 minutes. I reduced the marinade to a thinner glaze. After the 8 minutes, I turned the swordfish steaks over and coated them with the glaze and let them cook for the last 8 minutes, covered. The swordfish came out perfectly and everyone, including the kids, enjoyed it. I bet it would go great with chicken on the grill too.

Took the suggestion from below to make coconut rice. This was like a sweet & sour dish. Very good!

I completely agree with the cook from Philly. This dish is wonderful! I also served the remaining sauce over rice and the small bits of ginger give it a devine taste.

This recipe was fantastic and easy. I didn't alter the recipe at all, and found the taste to be outstanding. I marinated the swordfish for about 2 hours. The reduced marinade added delicious flavor too. I served it over coconut rice from this website. I think this recipe is perfect as it is and it doesn't need any adjustments.

Not bad, but add some cojones. Add a shot of Tequila to the marinade, and cut in a spicy pepper when reducing the remaining sauce to a glaze. I used a medium (Long Anaheim Red or Jalapeno) rather than too spicy (Serrano or Scotch Bonnet). You could also grill the fish, and you don't have to use Swordfish...just marinate it less if you're using a smaller fillet.

I have already used this recipe a number of times but with lemon juice instead of lime.

3+ forks. We think it is excellent especially when I use fresh high quality swordfish. I added a half tsp of garlic powder to the marinade and 1/4 tsp of wasabi powder to it when I reduced it. I know the folks that didn't like it are wondering, but I've made things everyone else thought were 4 forks and we didn't like it which left me wondering what I did wrong. I quess that's why there are so many different recipes.

We followed the recipe exactly and after the first bite, each of us said "not edible." There was something about the sauce mixing with the flavor of the swordfish that just did not work. I cannot explain why some cooks loved this recipe, but don't take a chance on it if you are serving for the first time to guests....we truly found it to be a waste of good fish. Ugh.

This was barely edible. Such a waste of good swordfish. I followed the recipe exactly, as I always do when trying a recipe for the first time, and the only one who liked it was my cat. Swordfish is too expensive to be cat food. I suggest you try a different recipe.

Easy, healthy and tasty. Next time I will try a little wasabi powder in the marinade, as suggested by one of the readers, to kick the recipe up a little bit.

This fish was great. The flavors mixed really well and made a great main course for an Asian dinner. Try it - you'll like it.

I first made this dish in August 1997 - when I received that issue of Bon Appetit. Since then, we've used the marinade with scallops, shrimp and just about every kind of fish you can cut into steaks (it's great on tuna, too). Make this is soon as you can!!!

I am not a big fan of swordfish but I did enjoy this recipe. I only marinated the fish for 1 hour but it was sufficient. Marinade should be used to impart flavor, not to overtake the flavor of the food. Also marinating too long can alter the texture, making it mushy because of the high citrus content. Adding 1 tablespoon of any mild tasting oil will help to not burn the honey while grilling. Use the glaze sparingly since reducing intensifies the flavor. I served this dish with a stir-fried baby bok choy and steamed white rice. Simple yet explosive flavors!

Absolutely superb! We eat a lot of fish and I am a pretty good cook. This is the best swordfish that we've ever had according to my husband. Definitely a company dish where most of the preparation is done ahead of time. We cooked it on the grill and served it with bok choy. It was great!
