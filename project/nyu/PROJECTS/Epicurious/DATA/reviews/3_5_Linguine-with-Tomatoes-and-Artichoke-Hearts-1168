I love this as a pantry staple for those nights when I haven't a clue what to make for dinner, or when I don't want to spend all night cooking.

Great recipe. I changed a couple things: added a can of tuna in olive oil (oil drained), did not add all of the artichoke marinate. I put this over fresh pasta -- AMAZING. Only gave it 3 forks because I think it could be better by adding some sort of green -- chard, kale or mustard greens. The spiciness of the mustard greens would be great.

Loved it!! Added cubed chicken breast to the tomato mixture and used diced Italin seasoned tomatoes instead. The kids loved it!!

In a word? OUTSTANDING!! Overall, I followed the recipe; however, I did follow a couple of recommendations by other reviewers: I used (2) 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes w/ all of their juice, I didn't have a big jar of the artichokes but did have the 6.5 oz size so used (3) of those, but only used the marinade from two of them. I used 1/2 of a large onion and one scallion to roughly equate to (1) med. onion. I didn't have fresh garlic so used 1 1/2 tsp. of crushed garlic. I had fresh basil, so used a 1/4 C. fresh basil julienned. I did let the tomato mixture reduce down for about 10 minutes before I added the artichokes, then let it reduce down for another 5 minutes. I added a 1/2 C. of Half & Half at the end, then added 1/2 C. of the freshly shredded parm. The Half & Half got grainy on me as soon as I added it, but I think it did that because of the vinegar in the artichoke marinade. It did not adversely affect the flavor at all, and once the cheese started melting, it was hardly noticable. I tossed the linguine in and it was perfect sauce:pasta ratio. Served with parm/garlic toast. It was, like I said before, outstanding. Definitely will be making it when I want to Wow! my guests. It was a beautiful dish. Next time I make it, I'll serve it up with a caesar salad too and a nice chianti or zin. I am not sure what was up with the few negative reviews that this recipe received. Perhaps it was the quality of ingredients or something...

Too many dried herbs. The tomato sauce really overwhelmed the taste of the artichokes. The sauce was really not something that I would make again. On a slightly more disturbing note, my boyfriend noted that the final appearance of the dish had a striking ressemblance to vomit.

Since finding this recipe in 1992 it has been my "go to" whenever I need something tasty and quick. Have served it to many friends over the years - always rave reviews. My copy from the magazine is about worn out!

I substituted feta for the parmesan. The artichoke marinade is pungent and, I think, calls for a creamier cheese as a counterpoint. This is an easy weeknight supper with garlic bread and a salad. I have made it several times - even my 2-year-old likes it!.

This was a VERY easy recipie to make AND my kids actually liked it. Although I would recommend using FRESH Parmesan cheese. Store-bought grated cheese made the sauce a bit stringy.

I am completely baffled by the good reviews. It was average. I Would never serve to guests and didn't even bother saving the leftovers. Skip it.

Took some readers' suggestions and used 2 16-oz cans of tomatoes, added (very little of) the marinade with the tomatoes, and added a can of (unmarinated) artichoke hearts. The result was quite yummy and well-received. I plan on making it again soon!

Liked this... simple and easy. Had to make some alterations to fit what was in my pantry. Didn't have chopped tomatoes, so I took some whole ones, squeezed out the juice into a bowl (over a strainer) and chopped them. Used two 14oz cans instead of one 16oz, as one can of whole doesn't equal one can of chopped. Also didn't have marinated artichokes, so used the plain canned ones and added extra seasonings and garlic. When it called for the marinade to be added, I threw in a couple cubes of homemade chicken broth. Was very good, and kept well for a fiancé who was late :)

This was a very nice, easy, week-day type recipe (although I would serve it to friends too). I also increased the tomatoes to a 28-oz. can. This is a good winter staple, as it doesn't require fresh tomatoes or basil.

I loved this recipe. I brought leftovers to work for lunch, and everyone commented how great it looked and smelled. Also, I used fresh plum tomatoes, and added black olives and a little goat cheese.

I have made this from a Silver Palate recipe, using a28oz can of tomatoes, and a 6oz. jar of artichokes, also more spices. It is pretty good.

this recipe needed extra spice so i added red pepper flakes. also, the flavors were better when the onions, tomatos and artichoke marinade were allowed to simmer before adding the artichokes. i also used penne instead of linguine.

This was easy and quick and I had all the ingredients on hand, but it was nothing special. The leftovers went into the trash rather than the fridge.

My husband & I had just recently eaten out at a pasta restaurant. I had this great meal that I wanted to try to reproduce at home. This is not exactly the same but just as tasty. A great dish for company.

This dish was quite yummy. I followed the advice of others and used 28 oz of tomatoes and not all the artichoke marinade. When adding the parmesan, I also added 4 oz crumbled feta, which added a wonderful touch.

Very, Very easy! I added more tomatoes (28 oz. total, and next time I will add even more. I also added extra artichokes--should have followed the advice of others and not used all of the marinade. It made the sauce very runny! I also added portabella mushrooms. Some spice would have been good for a perky twist, but over all a good dish. The ingrediants are always on hand at my house!

A great weekday dish-when you do not have a lot of time to spare. All the ingredients are usually kept on hand and easy to remember-whenever I'm at a loss of what to cook for dinner we have this.

This recipe was fabulous. I didn't use all of the tomato juice and I didn't add the oil from the artichokes. The cheese makes all the difference. I would definitely make it again. So cheap, so good and so easy to make!

Nice and easy... the flavors of tomato and artichoke together is succulent. I used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and added more garlic, oregano and basil than the recipe asked for. Plus, I only used about half of the water-based artichoke marinade. Next time, I'll use fresh herbs, fresh tomatoes and a spalsh of dry red or white wine - then it's truly a four-forker!!!

This recipe is good and so quick and easy. It is an impressive meal that could be served to company when you don't have much time. I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit and used a heartier pasta (rotini) and served it as a side dish to grilled sea bass! Delicious

This was a great pasta recipe. Even my three year old liked it. I plan on trying it with a little bit of shrimp in next time. Although I thought it was a great meatless meal. I made it with the blt salad you featured in the new recipe section.( which was also great!) enjoy

I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the proportions of the recipe (using canned ready-cut diced tomatoes, and artichokes AND marinade), and it came out very oily. The second time, I added the chokes without the marinade, and added some shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes, some balsamic vinegar, and some red pepper flakes for zest, and let it sit overnight before reheating and serving. Got rave reviews! Definitely a keeper!

I made this dish the other night, and I followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers such as adding shrimp, using the ready cut diced tomatoes (used two cans), and upped the amount of artichokes. It was wonderful! Definitely no complaints! Next time we have dinner guests, I'm going to use this one.

I agree with all the other cooks - very tasty and easy! My additions: fresh herbs, additional can of tomatoes, can of artichoke hearts (not marinated), red pepper flakes, and a tablespoon of capers at the end. Looking forward to making it with fresh tomatoes from the garden. I'll also use less of the artichoke marinade and omit the cheese to make it a lighter dish.

Very delicious and easy--made the whole house smell wonderful. I used 2 12-oz. cans of tomatoes, and added shrimp near the end of cooking. I will definitely make it again: when you taste it, it seems like a recipe that would take a lot more work.

I thought this was very, very easy and very quick to make. I prepared the sauce while cooking the linguine. I also substituted the Italian plum tomotoes with Ready Cut Peeled Diced Tomatoes. I served this dish for company and everyone raved about it and thought I had spent hours preparing.

We really loved this pasta dish. There isn't really lots of tomato sauce so it is just flavored by herbs and the marinated artichokes which have a vinegar flavor. So this is a good tangy italian dish that resembles the flavor of italian dressing cooked in it. My husband said this dish would be good with italian sausage also. Enjoy!!
