I grew up in Virginia and always heard that the recipe for Brunswick stew was 3 meats (rabbit, squirrel, & chicken), 3 vegetables from above the ground (corn, tomatoes, and lima beans), and 3 vegetables from under the ground (onion, potatoes, and carrots). This ones tastes the closest to what my mom made (she used chicken) of several recipes I've tried (minus the green pepper).

I made this recipe almost as written (added fresh garlic to veggie saute, and a couple tbls Worcester Sauce for 'brightness' to the liquid). Great, simple recipe - I used 6 skinned chicken thighs, and the bones slipped out easily after about 90 mins of low simmer. Good on Day 1, great on Day 2. Would work well in a Crock Pot after the meat/veggies are browned/sauteed.

Waiting while my own recipe for Brunswick stew simmered, I looked in Epicurious for a recipe -- just for fun! I guess there really are a million recipes for Brunswick stew -- and they all boil (or simmer!) down to the same thing -- some chicken -- legs and thighs are best, a couple of pork chops and squirrel if you have some.(Mine are romping in the attic as I write!) Brown the meat. Simmer with sauted onions, garlic, canned tomatoes and water (add or don't add the bay leaf) until the meat is falls off the bone when stirred. Cool. Remove bones. Chill over night for best flavor, or add canned corn (not frozen) and frozen limas. The proportions in the recipe work. But simmer, simmer simmer before removing the bones. Use the Gourmet recipe for proportions. Vary the meat to what you have in the freezer! This recipe is so close to my family recipe that I feel safe in rating it.

lima beans and bell peppers must be regional, but not in Brunswick stew I've seen-meat +corn+ tomatoes +onions=B.S.

This wasn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off. Basically it just gave me some ideas for my own stews when I'm just using whatever is in the house. I liked the lima beans and the corn - made for a bit of a change from carrots. I wouldn't make this exact recipe again - nothing about it stood out.

I substituted the baby limas with edame but this stew is a bit strange. I don't know what it is. I like it the more I eat it but something is keeping me from liking it as much as I should. I think it needs more seasoning maybe some sage or oregano. I used chicken instead of rabbit and that might have been better with a more gamey taste.

Brunswick stew, barbecue sauce,currry are really styles of cooking that cannot be con..tained in a recipe. In Georgia, frozen lima beans are a no-no from long ago and I'm not sure my ancestors knew about bay leaves. The only thing we ever did with bell pepper was stuff them with ground beef. This all being said,Punjabi curry is a very different dish from Thai curry. People in South Carolina put mustard in their BBQ sauce. A SIMPLE BRUNSWICK STEW- boil one lb. of beef, chicken, pork in a quart of chicken broth-break up chunks add 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes add 2 cups chopped onions add 1 lb. frozen corn 1 cup ketchsup,1/2 cup worchestershire lots of black pepper TAKES ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES

Great recipe, I couldn't find frozen lima beans, so I substituted frozen black eye peas. Was easy to make.

This recipe is great. I used olive oil instead of corn oil and omitted the flour. I also used edamame as another person suggested. For tomatoes I used Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes and that makes a great flavor! Also, I added potatoes... I love this recipe and have now made it twice.

Pretty darn tasty, I have to say. I would have liked a bit more "heat" to it, but this was easily remedied with a dash or two of Tabasco sauce. I added two Idaho potatoes and used chicken thighs only, as one reviewed suggested. Before adding the corn and limas I took the chicken off the bone and shredded it. I served it with Jiffy brand cornbread, a true guilty pleasure, considering I'm from the South and generally favor non-sweet cornbread!

This recipe was very good, very tasty. I used chicken and I served it over rice. I did add the bullion cube to the chicken broth as suggested. I would definitely make it again.

I used edamame instead of lima beans and skipped the flour. At the end I thickened with a bit of butter and potato starch. Delicious.

For a girl born and raised in California, this was really good. No squirrel meat as noted by a VA chef....ugh... I did add a bit more chicken flavoring at the end...

This was really good and easy to make. I added a bit more chicken flavor (Better than Bouillon) at the end as I thought it was a bit plain.

Hey, I think the modifications make perfect sense. There is no "one" recipe for Brunswick stew. I would never add green pepper or flour, but corn, pulled pork, and potatoes are a must in our recipe. I live in Va. and have a friend from Ga whose recipe isn't even close to what we find locally. Chicken thighs don't dry out like chicken breasts, and yes, remove the bones after you stew the chicken in broth and add the rest of the ingredients. And I doubt anyone from Va or Ga would care where the bay leaves come from so don't waste your time looking for Turkish bay!

Wow! What a flashback! I grew up in Hopewell, Virginia, in the 50s. The Knights of Columbus made Brunswich stew in big black iron pots for the church picnic. They used as much squirrel as local hunters could provide, also veal shin bones donated by the butcher, with chicken as filler, as IronWill1 noted below. But the key was simmering over a very low fire, 24 hours or more. Those were the days!

I am now 64 years old, but I grew up in Mecklenburg County, Virginia just next door to Brunswick County, and I ate Brunswick stew all my life from '45 to '61 when I went away to college, as well as every time I went home when I was in college. People usually made it in BIG black pots outside over an open wood fire. It cooked almost all day. It rarely included rabbit or squirrel, but usually had beef, chicken and pork along with the onions, potatoes, tomatoes, corn and lima beans. It was superb. They usually made 30 to 50 gallons, sometimes more, and sold it in pint or quart Mason jars as a fundraiser for causes, clubs or churches. There were several well- known and celebrated Brunswick Stew makers in each community. They each had their own seasonings which they did not reveal. People are right about the fact that all you need to make a meal is bread, whatever kind you choose (back then we often used plain white loaf bread which we dipped into the stew) and a salad. Finish it off with a Lemon chess or brown sugar pie, if anyone still makes them. Take the time to make the stew and enjoy it, you'll be glad you did! If I can answer any questions for anyone about this, I will be glad to try. I do have a recipe, if any one would like me to post it. It's from back then.

This may be a silly question, but do you debone the rabbit or chicken. Reading the recipe it says to cut rabbit through the bones into 2" pieces. Any ideas?

I think A Cook meant the best reviews come when someone has made the recipe as written, then comments on the modifications made subsequently. Let me be up front: I have not made this recipe. There's Brunswick, VA and Brunswick, GA. And like barbecue, Brunswick Stew is regional. I've eaten this wonderful stuff all my life - my mother made it, I've made it, but the NW GA method is different. Brunswick Stew here is made with beef, pork, and chicken. The meat is simmered individually, then shredded, saving the stock. The meat is then combined, and simmered with the stock and tomatoes and seasonings until the stew combines into a savory, rich melange. Lemon slices and Worcestershire sauce are added to enrich the stew. Baby limas or butterpeas are added, depending on preference. Diced potatoes added if desired; some families do this, some skip it. Corn is added last, as it tends to stick to the pot.

The meat for a proper Brunswick stew ought to be squirrel, although chicken would serve in a pinch. I typically simmer the meat in water to cover until it's very tender, and pull it off the bones. The meat and its accompanying stock goes into the pot with onion, diced carrot & potatoes, white corn, baby lima beans, a can of tomatoes crushed by hand with the juice. Add additional chicken stock if needed, and season with salt & pepper. The cayenne suggested in this recipe would be a nice touch, although I'd leave out the green pepper (too overpowering for the delicate meat), andf the flour isn't really necessary.

My first review! Good base for a brunswick stew recipe. My boyfriend, who grew up near Brunswick, VA loved my stew, as modified. Here are my modifications: +couple pieces smoked ham hock +2 ribs celery, used only breast chicken (bone-in) then removed bones after boiling and chopped fine. After boiling, added 1/3c ketchup, dash of worsterhire, chili sauce, cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper to taste, 2 tbs vineagar.

The first reviewer! The recipe made for an OK base, but with my modifications, inspired by the Virginia Cookbook, this recipe became a four star keeper. My boyfriend who grew up near Brunswick, VA says the stew, as modified, is his new favorite dish! I used breast meat with bones and took out the bones, plus added some smoked ham hock + 2 ribs celery in the end add: 1/3 cup ketchup 1 dash worstershire sauce chili sauce/cayene pepper/crushed pepper to taste Its such a rich stew, leaving it overnight does make it taste better!
