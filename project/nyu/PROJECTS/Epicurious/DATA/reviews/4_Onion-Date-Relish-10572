This is a keeper! Easy to make and delicious served with roast lamb for Easter dinner. I didn't have dried red peppers, so I used 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes. I also used red onion, which made the relish red. My family loved it. This recipe is from Gourmet, which I miss so much. What a poor substitute Bon Appetit is!
