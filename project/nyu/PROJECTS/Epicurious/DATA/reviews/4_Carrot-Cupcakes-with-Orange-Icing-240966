I made these for my co-workers birthday. I took the recommendation of finely grating an apple to substitute for part of the oil to healthy it up a little bit. One small apple was almost half a cup, and for the other 1/4 cup-ish I used butter because I didn't have vegetable oil. The cupcakes were fantastic! Moist, dense, more like banana bread than a cake. I substituted a no-powdered-sugar cream cheese frosting for the orange glaze, because cream cheese frosting is so, so, so good; and I didn't bother with the candied carrots since they seemed like a giant pain. But the cupcakes... so good.

Very tasty indeed. I made them healthier: used white whole wheat flour, only 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and 2/3 cup of sugar, added raisins, no frosting. Very delicious and only 170 calories each. For special occasions I'll follow the recipe as is.

These got scarfed up quickly. I used butter instead of veg oil & candied orange peel for garnish. Yum!

This recipe is delicious. I used 1/4 C. vegetable oil and 1/2 C. butter I also added 1 C. raisins. I soaked the raisins in water, dumped the water before adding it to the recipe. I used more powdered sugar in the frosting to make it easier to frost the cupcakes.

Fabulous cupcakes!!! Served to guests last night to rave reviews!!! I did make cream cheese frosting with the orange zest instead & then added more zest to decorate instead of the carrot curl. YUM!!!!

Yum! I made these with the orange icing for a birthday party, and they were a big hit. Per suggestions by other reviewers, I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup applesauce. I also upped all the spices slightly. Instead of garnishing with the candied carrot curls (which seemed like an awful lot of work) I toasted some chopped walnuts and sprinkled them on top after icing.

Easy and delicious, my favorite combination. After reading reviews, I decided to make a cream cheese frosting and didn't bother with the carrot garnish. I'm intrigued by the orange icing though, and may try that next time. Also as mentioned in other reviews, they were just a little oily, so I think I might use less oil next time. But I made them an hour ago and they're almost gone - and there's only 3 people eating, so that should tell you how good they were.

These were delicious! I did not make the carrot curls as these were not being served to guests. I really like the orange glaze - it was a nice complement to the moist carrot cake. I have also made the carrot cupcakes with cream cheese frosting and they were a hit. As with most things I bake I used scant measurements for the sugar and oil and I don't think the cupcakes suffered. I may reduce the oil even further next time.

Yum! Great and got rave reviews. I juiced the carrots so they were finer than the recipe and I used only a 1/2 c of oil and added carrot juice for the last qtr cup. I'm going to try a honey and citrus glaze next time too.

These are yummy but the 3/4-C of oil makes it a bit of a deal breaker. As delicious as they are, can't make them too often.

Wow! I enjoyed making these, the house smelled like the holidays. I used 1/2 cup of veg oil and 1/4 of unsweetened apple sauce. I also added 1 tablespoon of fresh grated ginger and uped the spices a bit. Oh yeah, and adding walnuts just gave it that crunch. Yum!

The best carrot cake I have ever had by far. Astounding simple to make, the most time consuming step is grating the carrots! No mixer needed! The cake is moist and light but packed with flavor. The icing is perfect. Definitely a new standard in my house.

I cannot describe how wonderful these are. I also have tried with cream cheese frosting. Like it both ways. It just depends on how sweet you want them. The favor of the cake comes through much better just glazed. It contains no white sugar and I used unbleached flour and canola oil.

I tried these because I was looking for a completely dairy-free baked desert for guests, and they are out of this world. I'd make them for anyone - rich, moist, flavorful, and the glaze is just right.

Just made these for my daughter's Halloween party at preschool - they asked that the treats be somewhat healthier than the average candy bar, so I thought carrot cupcakes! They are moist and delicious - even my husband who does not like carrot cake ate all of his. I substituted 1/2 cup of sugar free applesauce and only used 1/4 cup of oil, and upped the spices a bit per others' suggestions. Made with a basic cream cheese frosting. Yummy!

This came out wonderfully. The spices really show their flavour the day after they are baked; the only problem is there is usually nothing left at the end of the second day!

I made these with cream cheese frosting for July 4th and everyone claimed that they were the best carrot cupcakes they had ever had.

Really nice recipe. Very easy to follow and hard to mess up. The icing turned out a bit too watery, but that wasn't that big a deal. I topped the icing with some whipped cream and colorful sprinkle that my goddaughter helped decorate. Very tasty. I baked with an electric oven at 180C for 25 minutes. The result was excellent but a touch dry. If I were to do it again, I would bake it for 180C for 20 minutes. A hoot with the children!

These are tasty treats!!! I just ate one while it is still warm and I was in heaven (especially since I had some left over cream cheese icing!). I used cake/pastry flour which I think creates a more delicate crumb. Not too oily with the full oil amount. Could use a bit more spice next time but I just love cinnamon! Mine were done after about 18 minutes too. Delicious!

Yum! I took the advice of previous reviews and cut the oil down to 1/2 cup and added homemade applesauce (grated a whole granny smith apple). Although this resulted in very tasty carrot cupcakes, next time I will squeeze out the juice from the homemade applesauce since the cupcakes turned out to be a bit too moist. I will also cut back on the sugar, since the applesauce added to the sweetness.

These are getting a rating of 3 and not 4, but only because I doubled the recipe and I think they didn't come out quite the same as a single recipe would have. I forgot that when you double a recipe, the levels of salt/baking powder/baking soda can't necessarily just be doubled. They came out really good as far as I'm concerned - the batter was salty to taste so I was worried, but the cupcakes themselves weren't. They weren't too sweet either (a little muffin-like, perhaps), which worked really well when I added a glob of cream cheese frosting :) They were moist and delicious!

I made this with butter rather than oil, and did half the cakes with gluten free flour. All looked and smelled the same, though the texture of those with GF flour wasn't so good, and the taste of the soda and BP was a bit too strong - I should have adjusted these down. I did the icing as suggested though without the carrot curls. Overall the flavour was very good - but not outstanding. The texture was definitely too dry, so perhaps oil is better than butter for this. The icing was easy - I just added juice til the consistency seemed right, so they only needed one coat. I used ordinary sized muffin tins rather than jumbo ones - with these, the recipe made 15 cupcakes. Again, I wonder whether a larger muffin tin would result in a moister texture?

I really liked these cupcakes. the icing required about two times the amount of sugar. i took the advice of another reviewer and double dipped the cupcakes in the icing. i didn't prepare the candied carrots based on previous reviewers warnings. Also, note that the icing is very messy when drying. Put a paper towel under the rack upon which you are resting the cupcakes. Don't use a plate or the papers will be crusted in icing as well.

I made some changes to make it a little more healthy. I used just over 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 eggs plus a "flax egg," and 1/2 cup oil plus 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. I also added some chopped walnuts as per another reviewer's suggestion. They came out very moist and flavorful. I made the icing according to the recipe, and it complements the carrot cupcake very well. These are truly, dangerously delicious! :)

Cupcakes turned out wonderful, I substituted cream cheese frosting from another recipe on this site (Cream Cheese Frosting: Bon Appétit | June 1998 ) instead of the orange icing. Brought them to work and all were gone the same day.

completely LOVED these cupcakes! I reduced the oil but they were still perfectly moist. The orange icing was a great touch, but they would be good with a cream cheese frosting as well.

The cake, with a little of the oil reduced, was fantastic. I didn't have golden brown sugar, so I used 1/2 white and 1/2 dark brown sugars instead. The carrot curls were a bit of work, but they turned out fine. I don't think I'll use that garnish again for the cupcakes. The glaze was okay, but many of my colleagues said they would have preferred a more traditional cream cheese frosting.

These cupcakes are marvelous!! They taste like carrot cake at first and then after a second it's an orange sensation! They are perfect texture too. (BONUS!!) I made a few changes though. One viewer said that they were a bit too oily. So instead of measuring the full 3/4 cup of the oil, I measured 1/3 cup, and then the rest of the way with applesauce. This complimented the "holiday spice taste" in them and cut down the fat. Also, instead of using orange juice for the icing, I used tangerine juice. This was great, because I thought the confectioners sugar would be too sweet, so I used the tangerine juice to add a tiny bit of bitterness. Also, if you like lots of icing, something my mom did was dip the cupcakes in the icing once, let them dry, and then dip them again. This created a nice thick layer of icing. I would say one layer of icing is prettier though if you're bringing these to a party. I definitely recommend this recipe!

I just started baking this year and I never thought my baking will end up looking like the picture. This cake is sooo good, very moist and keeps really well. Had mine out on the kitchen counter for 3 days and it still tasted the same. I'm making more today :) Highly recommended, A+++++

Made these with melted butter instead of oil (a little less than called for as per Johnson City, TN's review) -- they were delicious, although not super carrotty-tasting. Nice spices, great icing. My only complaint: they came out a little flat. Overall, great recipe; flavorful and a lighter icing than cream cheese - will make them again next time carrot cake is called for!

I was hesitant about whether the orange icing would compliment the carrot cupcake but the results were outstanding. The orange icing was a nice change from your classic cheesecake frosting. Cupcakes were moist and flavorful. For some texture, I added a cup of chopped walnuts.
