Plums have a lot of pectin in them. If the juice is bakeed to the point of boiling, the tart should set nicely after several hours of rest.

I did not blind bake the pastry but it ended up the best part of the pie, short and tasty, anyway. Using a 10" pie tin there was not enough room for the plums layed out in an overlaping spiral so I made two layers. That was fine--it came out very pretty. I sprinkled some arrowroot over the plums and basted the pie a few times because I could tell it would be too liquidy since the pie contains no thickeners (the breadcrumbs are insufficient to do the trick). Still, when serving, the pie didn't hold together and it was impossible to get intact, pretty pieces. My guests didn't mind but I don't like to serve an unasthetic piece of pie. The flavour wasn't great enough to justify making this one again. Unfortunately, this is the 2nd Joan Nathan recipe to strike out for me.

Wow, this was excellent. The interaction of the plum with the apricot preserves was delicious.

You don't have to be Jewish to know that this is it. With perhaps slight variations in the crust contents, this IS Zwetschgenkucken. My Leipzig grandmother's recipe matches my Bavarian godmother's recipe matches my Hungarian-American mother's. Yes, it's runny. No, no thickener is used. Invite friends. Make some good, strong coffee. Eat it while it's fresh. This dessert signals fall for me.

I thought the flavor of the plum portion was sensational. I would like the flavor of a slightly lighter crust but I'm not sure one would hold up to the topping which got a little watery during baking. It was so easy to do and looked very pretty when done. I baked it in a quiche plate instead of a pie plate which looked great. My family enjoyed it also.

Fantastic tasting and looking tart. My only question is did you forget the thickening agent as it was very juicy and soupy. Other than that it was wonderful!
