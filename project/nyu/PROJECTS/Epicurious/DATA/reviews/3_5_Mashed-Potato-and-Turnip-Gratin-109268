perfect for thanksgiving! we added one carrot which offered sweetness and great color. very creamy without any cream, must be all that butter. Very quick to make, we cut the vegetables up which reduced the boiling time, then drained the water and used an immersion blender in the same pot. We baked it, but could have served it just after adding the cheese (we had parmigiano). We will make it again!

I thought this was delicious. Great turnip flavor and a way to use white turnips from my CSA share. Gave an added flavor to mashed potatoes and could be done ahead and baked. My husband loved it, too. I did use the food processor....might not next time..it came out very smooth and creamy...but not gluey. (That would happen if you used red potatoes.

I used idaho potatoes since that's what I had. I also only used half the butter. It was really a nice side dish. It wasn't off the charts delicious, but it was just plain good. Something you can make over and over and over again. That's why I gave it 4 stars.

Served this last night with Coq au Zin. Really easy to make, I actually peeled and chopped the potatoes and turnips before boiling, then just mashed in the same pot, added the butter and cheese. Added more than the suggested pinch of nutmeg and salt and pepper. The texture was perfect, kind of bland on its own, but nice. It was a perfect match with the intense flavors of the Coq au Zin. If it had a strong flavor on its own, might have been too many strong flavors on one plate. OVerall, really nice, i would do it again, maybe experiment with a stronger cheese.

I'm not a huge fan of turnips, but this was absolutely delicious. And as a college student, I definitely appreciate the few ingredients required. It was quick and easy!

Mashed potatoes & turnips by hand, since food processor would make a gluey mess of this. Added a little cream for richness plus the cheese - delicious!

I have yet to get good results when using the food processor and potatoes and this recipe was no exception. The flavor was good but the consistency was gluey. Next time I'd use a ricer or just mash coarsely with a fork.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I didn't have any problems. Great as leftovers too!

This is a delicious dish and a great use for the turnips we have growing in the garden. I have made it twice now, everyone loved the dish, making it again tonight. Excellent reheated. Really jazzes up the potatoes.

This is divine! Served it with the wine braised lamb, as suggested. Didn't like the lamb much but these potatoes saved the day. My Connecticut grandmother used to make turnip mashed potatoes. These were like a luxury version of her best comfort food! If you use the correct turnip potato ratio and use the Yukon Gold potatoes, they will not be gummy....

I was surprised to read the directions to process the potatoes in the food processor since I had always heard that would make them gummy. However, I wanted a "different" potato recipe that I could make in advance, so I decided to try it anyway. Bad idea. The potatoes came out of the food processor gummy, sticky, gluey, and gross. Hopefully, when I bake them tomorrow, they will taste better than they look. I dumped lots of extra cheese on top, hoping that would make up for the yucky pototoes and turnips. I'll update this message once I bake them tomorrow and taste them. No matter what, I'll just smile and pretend to my guests that they are exactly as they should be! Note, after I baked this, the texture of the potatoes improved. They were not as gummy, and my guests seemed to like them, but I have a zillion other recipes that would do the venerable potato justice, much more so than this one. I wouldn't make it again
