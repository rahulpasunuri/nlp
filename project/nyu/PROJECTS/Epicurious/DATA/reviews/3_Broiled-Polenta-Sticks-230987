This is excellent topped with a simple lamb stew (lamb, garlic, maybe some anchovies, diced tomatoes and stock.)

I love polenta and I liked this recipe. I added more salt than called for, and I put lots of cheese into the pot before I took it off the stove. I think next time I will turn it over to broil both sides. Other than that, a keeper.

I love polenta, and the instant polenta is much easier, but this was bland. I like mine still hot, soft and loaded with parmesan and used as a base for osso bucco, stew, etc. I just cant get into the solid stuff.

Not sure what all the fuss is about here. I agree they were a nice foil for the broccolini and squash and mushrooms recipes above (I made both, and learned how delicious delicata squash is!), however, the polenta sticks themselves I found somewhat flavorless. If I tried it again, which I probably won't, I'd use a LOT more parmesan cheese on top. And some more salt and pepper too.

It's hard to mess up polenta. Mine were under the broiler for 3 times as long, but they didn't burn. However, don't go to the trouble with topping the sticks with the other stuff, expect maybe the gravy & squash. The mushrooms & onions are too expensive and too much hassle.
