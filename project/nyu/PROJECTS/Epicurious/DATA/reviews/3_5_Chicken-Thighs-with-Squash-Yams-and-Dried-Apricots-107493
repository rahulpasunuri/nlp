Loved this recipe....WAY fall and great flavors and fairly simple

I used about 2 Tbsp butter instead of oil, and as most others did doubled the spices. Very satisfying, but not a dish I'd make to show off. Just cheap and healthy home dinner.

Loved this just as is!!! Way easy and VERY Fall like dish. The sauce is light/flavorful and should be served on a bed of rice.

This is one of my favourite Bon Appetit recipes. It's my go to one in the fall and winter--it's hearty, satisfying and people think you slaved over it. You can count on it at my house when boneless, skinless chicken thighs are on sale. Was dismayed by some of the comments about lack of taste--thought back to the first couple times I made it. I no longer use whole cloves or cardamom pods--I don't always have them. I like the ground versions and I am probably pretty liberal with both. I also use tomatoes from my garden--frozen from the summer. The variety I grow is sweet and you can tell in the end flavour of the dish. This time round I used date syrup--I had it from making the roasted cauliflower in one of the fall issues of Bon Appetit--it gave a sweet and tangy flavour. As others have said, apricots or raisins are good...top with some chopped pistachios!

This recipe is terrible as written. Wish I would have read the reviews beforehand, but in the end I still think there is way too much tomato and that's all you taste.

I doubled all of the spices as suggested by the reviewers. it was good and was not bland. But it feeds 8 people easily. Especially when served over a starch.

As other reviewers I doubled up on spices and added chicken broth. I also used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 apricots; very good, especially over quinoa.

Rating: 3
I only gave 3 forks due to the need to double up on the spices (some would like it a bit blander maybe) I also used chicken breast instead of thighs and added a bit of chicken stock to make up for flavor. I made it twice and the second time I cut up the apricots a bit more and served over couscous (flavord the cous cous with some of the spices and some dried crimini mushrooms and some veggie stock) It was a wonderful hearty dish that will enter the winter rotation with some frequency I think.

I followed some tips of fellow reviewers and thought this came out wonderfully! My husband even rated it top 5! I coated the chicken additionally in cinnamon which really brought out flavor. I also added chicken stock to simmer and served over rice.

Rating: 3
Based on other reviews, I increased the herbs and spices by about 50%. I didn't have enough apricots, so I used prunes, too; they were great. I slipped a whole cinnamon stock into the pot and simmered the whole dish for nearly an hour. I also subbed other kinds of squash because that's what I had. It was delicious. The family really enjoyed it.

Rating: 4
Yum. Super easy, entire family including Grandma and Grandpa and 4 teenage boys loved it. I used thighs with bones and took the meat off the bones right before serving.

This was tasty, but I only gave it 3 forks because I found, like other reviewers did, it needed a lot more flavor. I doubled the cumin and thyme and added about 2 tsp ground cinnamon to coat the chicken before browning. Also added more cinnamon, ground cardamom, ground ginger, black pepper, and salt while cooking. I wanted it a bit more saucy, so I added about 1.5 cups of chicken stock. Simmered for a total of 45 minutes. Sauce came out very rich and nicely flavored.

We don't make this often, but will bust it out on a cold winter evening when guests call. Beautiful colours, fantastic textures and multi-layered tastes. Try subbing dried pears or golden raisins in a pinch (all are delicious!)

This is a great dish. Deep, complex flavors, and it's easy. Once everything's prep'd, it comes together quickly. It's awesome over basmati rice. I don't know how you make this and have it come out flavorless. Use all the ingredients! Yes, season your onions & garlic when frying them (like you always should). And double-up on the cardamom & clove. Our only question: do you split the cardamom pods first, or put 'em in whole. We did it whole but will split 'em open and extract the seeds next time.

This was wonderful-I've too often ordered dishes with cardamom and cloves that are overwhelming to the point of being disgusting and bitter, but with the cumin and thyme these flavors were well-balanced and I really appreciated those flavors. Really easy too, and it had lots of healthy squash and sweet potatoes. I made a substitution-I didn't have butternut squash and had a zucchini I needed to use, so I used that with a diced carrot to make up for the sweetness. The butternut squash might be a little better, but this was great too. I served it with brown basmati rice and loved the sauce. Lots of complex flavors. I also cooked it an hour instead of 30 minutes because I think I had more liquid from using a zucchini.

I like the one pot dish, easy to clean up but the sauce did have not complex taste I was hope for. All I can tasted was the tomatos but I also did not have the apricot so I substite with raisins.

Love this recipe! I don't cook very often, so the amount of time it takes to prepare this is annoying to me, but the end result could not be better! Absolutely wonderful!

I made this for my sister and I one night when my parents were out. I drove all the way to the store and back only to have forgotten the canned tomatoes. I was able to scrounge up one can at the back of a cabinet, but there wasn't enough juice, luckily my mom had some V8 cans in the fridge and it worked out perfectly! It tasted just as good, I loved the textures of the squash/yams. It's a keeper.

This was really fabulous! I upped all the spices as suggested,and used a Sweet Dumpling Squash. Instead of reducing the sauce, I just mashed up some of the squash to make the sauce thicker. Its going to be a regular around our house.

Very tasty and filling. Used twice as much tomatoes and served over couscous. Next time will chop the apricots more. Good dish for company as once it's in the pan, no more work and it can stay there for a long time.

Easy dish with great flavor. Substituted chicken leg for boneless thigh and added a bit more salt. Will definitely make this again.

Just made this today. Definitely a keeper. I was in a rush and actually forgot the cumin and thyme but added a few more cloves and ground cardamom instead of pods. I added a dash of kosher salt at every stage and I think the flavor is great. Beautiful colors and smell. Husband loved it!

This recipe is great for a large gathering: Its affordable, easy, and it will make your house smell awesome. There's a lot of starch in this dish...if you only add salt to the chicken, the dish will be bland. The trick is to add salt at every step: when you are sauteing the onions, to the chopped vegetables before you add them. Also, I put way more cardamom in...its the best part.

This recipe turned out fine- it was tasty but I wasn't bowled over by it. A nice warming meal though. I used bone-in, skin-on thighs, since I think they're more flavorful.

I increased the cardamom and cloves by one pod/clove, added a small can of fire roasted tomatoes, half tsp cayenne pepper, half cup of water and baked @ 350 covered for 1 hour, very good!!

I'm allergic to tomatoes, so I just omit those, substituting chicken broth instead. It works great every time! A new favorite. Amazing flavours.

Despite the spices, this recipe was a tad bland. I found the squash and yam a little too much and didn't like the combination with tomatoes. It was quite healthy, and that was the only upside for me. It also took longer than 30 mins for the vegetables to cook through.

This dish was just okay. I chose it for all the healthy veggies, but it was bland despite all the garlic, herbs and spices.

We really liked this recipe. It is very healthy, as we all know that sweet potatoes, squash and apricots are all high in vitamins and antioxidants. It is reasonably low fat, even when using the chicken thighs as opposed to chicken breasts (too dry). I cut the chicken into large cubes and used a seasoning called Vindaloo (from Penzey's spices - go to Penzeys.com), which is basically a mixture of cumin, cinnamon, tumeric, etc., and added red pepper flakes and served it with couscous. It was an easy mid-week meal that I would definitely make again. I agree that 3 1/2 stars would be about right, maybe 4 ("A dish beyond compare") is a stretch, but it is at least "delicious" (and healthy at the same time.)

I wish there was a rating of three and a half forks, because this dish was delicious! I was a bit leary when adding the cloves, but they lent the dish a fantastic smell without overpowering the taste. The tomatoes and apricots were a nice balance and the chicken was tender. Squash and yams rounded out the texture and made this dish a perfect finish to a chilly autumn day. I would definitely make this dish again.

Rating: 2
I made it without any substitutions...It was just OK-a little bland, I thought the ingredients would make this more flavorful, but the tomatoes overpowered the delicate squash & yams. If I make this again, I will add less tomato, more cloves & cardamom, as well as some indian curry and a few raisins. It definitly needs alot of tweaking.

Really easy + really good. Even better the next day. I did thin the sauce a bit to serve over couscous.

This was fantastically good, especially if you salt it properly. And we even had leftover veggies which smelled really heavenly. I was very impressed.

no flavor. i didn't like it one bit! neither did my two kids (granted they are a little picky) or my husband. he just kept adding salt and pepper to make it taste like something.

I'm a personal chef in Scottsdale, AZ. This is one of my clients favorite dishes. I always make a double batch so that we can have it at home too!

It looked beautiful on the plate, vibrant cubes of orange, red, and yellow atop dark green spinach, but I was diappointed in the flavor. The spices didn't meld with the chicken or the vegetables, and the chicken was tough. It had that low-fat feeling about it. I didn't have cardomon pods so I used powerdered (and too much of it), my mistake. I'm going to give this dish one more chance, and next time cook it for much much longer.

I nice weeknight supper dish. I agree it needs a little pep, so I added preserved lemon and some fresh chillies. I think your thigh fillets must be much larger than ours - need more than 2 per person.

I originally made this dish for an African family that belongs to our church and was undergoing a health crisis with the mother of the family. When I returned home after dropping the meal off, the smell in my house was heavenly. The family from Africa told me that they thought it was wonderful. I have since cooked it for dinner parties and everybody has loved it.

Made this for my husband who likes Morrocan food and he liked it. I didn't have any caradom, squash or yams on hand, so just went with what I had. Still came out great. Served it over couscous. Think some slivered almonds may be a nice addition the next time I make it.

Rating: 3
I'm not one to follow recipes exactly, but this came out very good using the recipe as guidance to use roasted sweet potatoes and shredded roasted chicken. I didn't have any squash on hand but did add some Thai sweet chili sauce and some vinegar to give it a bit more punch and chicken broth to make it creamy. Put it in my low-tech slow cooker for an hour to let the flavors mingle. Very interesting and definitely something I'll play with some more. Might try adding some garbanzos next time.

This was a marvelously yummy one-dish meal. I served this over brown rice. I made some changes to the recipe...8 cloves of garlic, a bit more squash and sweet potato, and I tripled the cardamom pods and cloves. I also added spinach in near the end.

A good place to find cardamom pods and whole cloves is Indian grocery stores. They are much much cheaper there and come in good sized quantities.

I didn't mind this, but the bizarre combination of flavors left the rest of the family pushing their plates away in horror. When the hubbie asked where I got the recipe, my eldest volunteered "makeyourkidsthrowup.com" as an answer. Comedians. They may never let me in the kitchen again...

I made this as a way to use up boneless, skinless chicken thighs from the freezer. It came out very good. It was a wonderful blend of flavors. The cardamom and clove added a subtle sweetness. And I just love sweet potatoes and butternut squash. At this time of year, they are plentiful, inexpensive, and very healthy. I left more liquid than recomended and served it like a stew over couscous. Yum!

nice combination of ingredients; I enjoyed it and would give it another try in the future, I like another reviewers idea of using prunes.

I had this dish at a friend's house and it was awesome. The mixed textures of yams, apricots and chicken was terrific. I'm trying this recipe out myself next week. Very fresh and different.

Okay, not great. I didn't add whole cardamon pods ($12.00 for a small bottle at the only grocery I could find them) which I suppose could have made a difference -- or maybe not. I like the one-dish dinner idea. May make again, may not -- not impressed, overall.

Rating: 2
A little on the bland side, I'd say. Nice final texture in the vegetables and apricots, but the chicken loses some of its character, and the reduction yields little punch. I'd recommend the similar Moroccan chicken with prunes, much more intense.

Rating: 3
I cut the recipe in half to make it for 2 and eliminated the squash but I found that 1 lb of yams is a LOT! If I made it again I would decrease the amount of yams. It was surprisingly good -- 1/2 way through I wasn't sure if this was gonna work. But I love thighs and there is great flavor.

Rating: 3
just made this for a second time using a couple of shortcuts: pre-peeled butternut squash, and i added the thyme and cumin with the garlic and therefore had no need to remove the chicken. It does have better flavour with the spice rub step, but made my way it's still tasty and becomes a quick and easy meal.

Great family friendly recipe! My toddler loved it! I served it with egg noodles on the side and it seemed to be a good match.

Much better recipe than it might sound. The apricots add a sweet/sour note, and the chicken has delicious cardamom flavor. One of my top ten!

My family really liked this recipe. One could even do this one with chicken breast, I don't think it would affect the taste of the dish. Next time I think I will add some spinach near the end. Will make this one again!

This is great. I decided to try this recipe because I like all of the ingredients individually ... and they're fantastic together! Simple, quick unusual and very colorful.
