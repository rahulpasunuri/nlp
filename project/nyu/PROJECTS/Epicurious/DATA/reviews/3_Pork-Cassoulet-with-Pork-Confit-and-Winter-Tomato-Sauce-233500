Next time I recommend using more pork and less sausage. Delicious even the second time around.

Very good recipe made just as instructed. Next time, I'd substitute pork tenderloin for the ribs- less fat to deal with. Also, you may want to keep an eye on the beans when on the stove. I cooked them just as described, and found them a tad bit mushy.

I made this for a holiday party. If making it again, I would reduce the sausage and add more pork. I'd also slice the sausage more thinly. The sausage I bought was rated mild, but was quite spicy. The leftovers were even better.

This was my first time making cassoulet. While not authentic, this was a very nice rendition. I particularly like the Winter Tomato Sauce.
