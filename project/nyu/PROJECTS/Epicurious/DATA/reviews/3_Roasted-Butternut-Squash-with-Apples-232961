Made this with apple cider vinegar and honey instead of red wine vinegar and maple syrup. It was a bit sweet for a side dish. The granny smith apples complemented the flavors very well. One person commented that it tasted like cold pumpkin pie.

I enjoyed this recipe. I did not have red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar and tasted great. Sweet side dish.

I agree with the oddity of serving this cold, I preferred it hot. However, I actually pureed this down with some chicken stock and made a soup out of it. Absolutely delicious. I used about 2 cans of broth, but it can easily remain vegetarian with a vegetable stock as well!

I'd actually give this dish 2 1/2 forks ... it was odd that it was served cooled but it was actually quite good.
