This was my first time making crabcakes and they turned out great. The tomato ginger jam adds nice flavor to the cakes. The mixture is extremely moist almost soupy before baking, however they held together when cooked.

The cornflakes were too crunchy for my liking, and the jam was just okay. They all got eaten, but the response was just okay.

Nice turn on the traditional crab cake. Our dinner party devoured every one! Served with a Groth 2004 Sauvignon Blanc.

This is a great appetizer which can be served in any season. I was a little hesitant at the mention of corn flakes thinking it might ruin the crab, but I was pleasantly surprised. Also, make sure you get very ripe tomatoes. It will make all the difference in the jam. My only complaint is that I used tomatoes that were not the tastiest and this hurt the jam a bit.

I used Dungeness crab and these were really good. They all disappeared, so I wasn't the only one who thought so. I used another review's idea to put some Old Bay in the corn flakes - this was good. I didn't find the corn flakes sweet or that they cheapened the crabcake at all. The mixture is very wet when you dredge, but I just kept one hand "wet" and one "dry".

I just love this recipe--and so have my guests. The jam is an unexpected and pleasing change from traditional cocktail sauce. I adjust the wet ingredients slightly if the mixture seems to wet, but I think the convenience of corn flakes can't be beaten! Elegant, tasty, terrific.

Great Recipe - I've used it successfully as both an appetizer & as a main course. On the second time around, I decided to increase the ginger content of the tomato/ginger jam 2X to give it a little more zip.

Outstanding - the hit of the party!

I found the texture to be off and the flavor unimpressive. The mix did not firm up in the oven as I had hoped. I just hosted a cocktail party with ~10 appetizers and this was the disappointment of the bunch - plenty left over. They did look pretty on the plate though.

This is my first crab cake recipe, and I found it easy and very tasty. I always serve it with the tomato jam, it really enhances the crab. A couple of suggestions: I agree with the cook who couldn't fathom using sugary corn flakes, so I always use unsweetened corn flakes, which are readily available at Fresh Fields/Whole Foods. I put more Old Bay in the corn flakes before coating. Also, while it helps to chill the crab in the mayonaise mixture, which allows the flavors to be absorbed and for them to be molded more easily, I don't chill it again after coating with the corn flakes. They would only get soggy and it would seem the point of the corn flakes is their crunchiness. I have made both the minature and regular size crabcakes. The recipe makes 4 nice size cakes which need to bake a few minutes longer.

A perfect recipie to bring to parties or potlucks. I used processed "Krab" meat, ordinarily something that many would not buy, but shredded fine in the Cuisinart, and with the addition of about four stalks of celery and an onion chopped very fine, it works. The result is an inexpensive delightful appetizer. Bring copies of the recipie with you, people will want them!

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I served this at a party in the Loire Valley and it was a big hit! As for the Tomato Ginger Jam, it was very good. I did add a little spice to it, but that is part of cooking...taste it. If it needs something, add it. It was very savory. If you use breadcrumbs, you have to saute them. The cornflakes had a nice golden color from baking and yes, they are bland, but this offsets the savory jam. A perfect combination. I will use this recipe for many parties to come.

I loved this recipe!!!! I have made it as an apetizer, but also as a main dish with a side of caesar salad. The is definately a winner, and very easy. Make the jam the day before.

The crabcakes were pretty good. I used panko breadcrumbs. I just couldn't bring myself to dunk $40 of crabmeat into sweetened breakfast cereal. Anyway, the crabcakes didn't brown very well, despite putting them on a buttered sheetpan. I had to turn them once, but they were still pretty pale. I understand the need to bake, rather than saute, because there are so many. I might recommend tossing the breadcrumbs in melted butter first, then coating the crabcakes, then baking in a pretty hot oven. If you're making them entree size, simply add a couple tablepoons of Wondra flour to the mixture, and saute straight-away in butter, foregoing the breadcrumbs. As for the Tomato Jam? Forget it. It was awful.

I changed the recipe by substituting crawfish tails chopped to the consistancy of the crab meat and added 1/2 c. plain bread crumbs to help hold it together, not so runny. I breaded them lightly with the crumbs. Baked them for 15 minutes turned them over and baked another 5 munutes. They were a huge success. The plain crumbs keeps the flavor of the craw fish. Excellent. Thanks.

OH, these were so delicious! I'd never made crab cakes before but absolutely loved these. My husband thought they were great, too! I did substitute the saltines for the cornflakes because that suggestion appealed to me and found that 4 cups was far too much--2 is more than enough. I made them a little bigger than bite-sized and baked a little longer. Wonderful, and will definitely make again when I've saved up enough money to buy the crabmeat! :>)

Two weeks ago I was in Baltimore eating the finest crabcakes. I think these appetizer cakes stack up very nicely and the tomato ginger jam really sets them off nicely. They were a hit at the dinner party.

I am very surprised at the mixed reviews. These cakes are a nice break from the all-too-common breadcrumb mixture. The cornflake exterior provides a crunchy shell that binds these little cakes together and eliminates the need to fry. One reviewer's Maryland husband needs to broaden his taste spectrum--I have been spoiled, too, by Chesapeake Bay bluefin but still found these delicious.

This was super easy and delicious. I used claw lump crab meat and followed the recipe as written. I made them ahead for a dinner party. With the accompanying tomato jam they terrific. I loved the petite size of the cakes. I didn't mind the "non-classic" cornflakes -- gave them a nice crunch.

We made this recipe and shortened the time in the refriderator and then let them sit for an hour before baking. Using a sonvection oven we were surprised to have to increase the cooking time. The end result was fabulous! We made this with with fresh dungenous crab! A 2000 Fowler Chardonnay was the perfect wine!

Cornflakes?? I don't think so. There are 2 possible substitutes for crab: Jacque Pepin recommends surimi, the Japanese imitation in your store (Louis Rich brand, I think). See "Today's Gourmet" cookbook. I have a friend/chef who uses frozen crawfish tails with excellent results, and its much cheaper.

This is a nice enough dish especially if (a) you know what Old Bay Seasoning is (b) you have access to said OBS. Lacking both........Sigh!

All the guests raved over these easy-to-make, make-ahead crab cakes. Chilling is important. Tomato jam adds nice flavor. As long as you cut them up fine, there is no need to peel the tomatoes.

These were delicious, and really easy to make. The jam was so good my guests ended up putting it on everything. The cornflakes gave it a nice crunch that you'd associate with fried foods, but these were, happily, lower fat.

This was a very nice and easy hors d'oeuvre recipte. The mixture is wet, but the crumbs hold it together. Just a note- peel the tomatoes first.

Just a terrific opttion for Crab cakes if you don't want to fry in oil. Substitute fresh breadcrumbs for the cornflakes and be sure to chill the mixtue as called for in the recipe to help them hold thier shape. An extra dash of hot sauce and the Tomato Jam was delicious. The Jam needs to cook down really well to attain the depth of flavor and consistency. Very nice all around.

At first glance this recipe looked uncomplicated, but what they dont tell you is how "wet" the mixture is before it is put in the Corn Flakes. After baking there wasn't a lot of flavor except for the corn flakes and a subtle flavor from the jam (which really should be called a salsa). Look for other crab cake recipes and pass on this one.
