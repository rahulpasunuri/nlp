Wish I'd read the reviews before I tried this--it was all butter and hardly any flavor. So far off the mark, I'm not even going to try to tweak it.

I agree. It tastes "too buttery" ,actually tasted like butter. we ended up adding three times as much powdered sugar, and because we added the sugar, added some extra rum and zest

I'll love this with vanilla ice-cream, not an very vanilla's, a light one like haaggen daz one. maybe an apple crisp will be great with it. I'll do it for a special meal.

Too much butter! I'd like to try it again using only 1/2 cup (1 stick) but it's Thanksgiving and I dont't have time. I'll see how my family likes it on their mince pie!
