I've made this with kohlrabi and it was great.

This recipe was a huge hit! It was simple and a crowd pleaser. I reduced the amount of butter to only 2 tablespoons which was fine since the rutabagas are naturally so creamy. I also added a tablespoon of fresh dill and served it as a side to pork chops. Very delicious!

For a root vegetable and some butter, this is awesome. A little sweet and lightly peppery. A bowl of this was my dinner. I added some finely ground rosemary along with the salt and pepper to flavor. No need to food process - I added the butter to the pot and mashed it. I was not a fan of rutabaga before this. Now I will probably crave this dish.

Very Good as is, perfect side for a flavourful meat or fish, though I will try the altered suggestion, this was great on its own

Loved the Rutabaga Par Royale. The cayenne gives it quite a kick! The presentation is very lovely too. Thanks Chef Boyami.

The 4 forks are for the Parr Rutabaga Royale from chefboyami. After doing some research on his other posts, I decided that it was not a joke and gave it a try. It is delicious. I am guessing perhaps an Austro-Hungarian or more likely an Austro-Venetian origin? Warning, we found it quite zippy. I suspect from the ginger and not from the cayenne which I cut back on a little.

To Chef Boyami: your recipe sounds very intriguing and I would like to give it a try - my husband loves saurkraut and I love rutabaga. Question: how on earth do you get all those ingredients in the blender at one time??? Seems impossible to me! Perhaps you meant an extra-large, commercial-size food processor rather than a blender???

We loved this recipe.........so easy, so good. Reminds us of our Mother's wonderful mashed rutabaga.

This recipe became the base for the Parr Rutabaga Royale. If you make this dish with my variation, I believe you would rate this a "4 fork" also. Parr Rutabaga Royale 1 rutabaga peeled and cut into 1" cubes 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup drained sauerkraut 1 teaspoon ginger powder 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon red cayenne pepper 1/3 to 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives for garnish Peel and cut rutabaga into one inch pieces. Place in large 3 quart pan of boiling salted water for about 40 minutes until softened. Drain water from pan, add butter and lightly mash or crush rutabaga. Place all pan contents into blender and add sauerkraut, ginger, cayenne pepper and nutmeg to Rutabaga and puree in blender, using the pulse feature. make sure that all is combined well. Pour cream in as mixture become somewhat mashed and continue blending until smooth. Prepare yourselves for the root that no longer needs to beg to make it to the table. Serves four as a side dish. Enjoy.

Just like Grandma used to make! Sometimes she'd mix the rutabagas with potatoes if she didn't have enough of one or the other. Saving the cooking water for gravy is a WONDERFUL idea! Adding brown sugar/nutmeg would make it a whole different recipe. Just like adding garlic/blue cheese to a mashed potato recipe would.

Please do not spoil this by adding sugar or anything else if you want the unusual flavour of plain rutabaga with lots of butter, coursely grated pepper and salt as required. Along with the pork, it stands well on its own.

Is this really a recipe? I agree with previous reviewer: DO add brown sugar, a dash of nutmeg or allspice, and a dab of butter to the cooking water. A good old potato masher works just fine - add additional butter and more brown sugar if you like. Or, do not mash/puree but, when tender, drain and toss with brown sugar/butter and saute a little while until cubes are glazed and lightly caramelized. Mmmmm, so very good! Next to asparagus, rutabagas are my favourite veggie!

I HAVE NOT USED THIS RECIPE BUT RUTABAGA IS A FAVOURITE IN OUR FAMILY AND USED OFTEN. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT BROWN SUGAR AND NUTMEG BE ADDED TO THE BOILING WATER. NO NEED TO HAUL OUT A GOOD PROCESSOR JUST USE A HAND MIXER. NOW YOU WILL NOT HEAR ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT, I"I DON'T LIKE TURNIP. THE TURNIP STOCK IS A MUST FOR GRAVY SO DO NOT DISCARD IT. PUT IN CONTAINER OR BAGGIE AND FREEZE UNTIL YOUR NEXT ROAST OR TURKEY. TRUST ME YOUR GRAVY WILL BE ACCLAIMED!!
