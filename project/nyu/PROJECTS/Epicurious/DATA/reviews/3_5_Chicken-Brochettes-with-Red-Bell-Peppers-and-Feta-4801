I've made this a lot, I never get the recipe exactly the same, and it's always very good. This last time I let it marinate all day and the garlic really kicked in and improved it. I always serve it with couscous or grilled homemade pita.

I've made this a half-dozen times, always with whatever herbs are in the garden, oregano, rosemary, etc). The yogurt marinade really protects the chicken from drying out. Everybody likes it and it couldn't be faster or simpler.

Made it the first time by the book. It was very moist, but not very flavorful. Doubled the rosemary and garlic and added some cayenne pepper the next time. It was wonderful - so moist. Used strained Greek yougurt I bought at Whole Foods Market. Marinatd it all day - next time will do it over night. I found I only needed one very large red pepper and also added a vidalia onion cut into wedges. Made tzatziki sauce to go with it, but it was not needed - chicken was so moist and flavorful. Next time will serve tzatziki with pita bread before dinner. A real keeper - will be making this often.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I cheated a little but it is so delicious that my husband asked me to make it again the next weekend. I used a store brand Tuscan Herb Italian dressing, feta and 2 cloves of garlic as the marinade. Skewered the chicken, mushrooms and red pepper. This is now one of our top 3!!!

This had a decent flavor but just so bland. I doubled the garlic and rosemary and added onion to the skewers, and nothing! If I made it again, it would need some major kick. And by the way, I made 3 chicken breasts for 2 people and it wasn't enough. It definetly needs something significant on the side...

Great summertime grilling recipe. I let the chicken marinade for almost 3 hours and it was extremely flavorful and tender.

This dish was good the night we made it but the leftovers were great. As suggested by other reviewers, we doubled the amount of garlic and rosemary, and added some cayenne. The next evening, we chopped the chicken and red pepper, tossed it with some commercially prepared yogurt and cucumber dip and some extra feta cheese, added black pepper to taste and stuffed it in pita bread. Served it with grilled zucchini and salad tomatoes we picked up at the farmers market. It was an excellent hot weather weeknight meal. Next time we will add some chunks of onion to the brochettes for flavor and moisture.

I use this marinade on bone in chicken thighs as well and always receive compliments. Outdoor bbq is best!

I have made this on both indoor and outdoor grills and it always is very very good. I also marinate it longer than recommended in the recipe, sometimes all day, with great flavor.

I did not think this was the best, but my dinner guests gave it rave reviews. I agreed with them that it was very moist, but I thought it could use a little more flavor. I think next time (tomorrow) I will try it with some crushed red pepper and extra garlic. Overall I think I will become a big fan of this.

This one is a keeper! I'm always looking for summer grilling recipes, especially for chicken. My husband and I both really enjoyed this, the chicken stayed nice and moist and has a great flavor to it.

I thought this recipe was extremely bland. Can't imagine what I did wrong as I followed the recipe exactly. Too many other good chicken marinades to repeat this one.

This one is a summer favorite at our house. I do cut back on the garlic just a little, and I let the chicken marinate as long as I can. Makes a great leftover, too.

This recipe was tasty and very easy to prepare. The chicken was very tender and had a nice flavor . Make sure to use fresh rosemary. I also added zucchini and mushrooms to the skewers and marinated them in garlic and oil prior to grilling. Finally, due to the yogurt coating the chicken never actually looks done so keep track of cooking time.

The chicken was very good. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and added a little more garlic and rosemary and it was wonderful. I served it with red pepper, onion and zucchini lightly brushed with olive oil and grilled as well as rosemary toast.

Chicken was nice and tender but the flavor was too mild for my taste. I am still looking for that perfect marinade.

Very delicious,moist,flavorful and easy to make. I put some more Rosmary in the marinade. The yogurt and feta marinade tenderize the chicken. My family loved it.I'll definitely make it again.

Really delicious. Pretty easy to make and take somewhere if you need to bring a dish to a bbq. Just grill them up and unskewer everything into a serving bowl. The tang of the feta really goes well with the chicken and peppers.

Yuuuuuuuuu-MEEE!! I loved this! The marinade helps to keep the chicken good and moist, and it's so flavorful. I did find it a bit messy threading the chicken on the skewers, but certainly worth the effort. I served this with Roasted Asparagus with Lemon (from Bon Appetit June '99, I think), which was a nice accompaniment. Definitely a keeper.

This was very delicious. Based on some other comments, I tripled the amount of garlic and rosemary in the marinade, and marinated it for the entire day to give the chicken more flavor. It was moist and scrumptious. I served it with the Greek-style yogurt and cucmber dip from this site, and couscous. The marinade gets burned off, so serving it with the yogurt dip complimented the flavor of the chicken. I will definately make this again.

This is a great simple recipe, and it's just as good without the red peppers. The yogurt marinade really tenderizes the chicken.

As I am lactose intolerant, I made this dish with soy yogurt and sheep's milk feta. I was concerned because the soy yogurt is on the sweet side, but when cooked the chicken tasted GREAT. Even my toddler wolfed it down. I served it on top of olive oil and garlic couscous. Yum!

The ingredients for this marinade sound odd and the marinade itself looks odd (chunky and white), but it does taste great. Based on smell, I thought the feta taste would be stronger, but the chicken ends up moist with a more subtle, herb flavor. 30 minutes of marinating is adequate, but an hour would probably be better.

This was easy to make ahead of time and the chicken does turn out really tender. But I was surprised that it was not more flavorful. Next time, I will try fresh mint instead of rosemary. I think it will be a stronger flavor that goes well with feta and yogurt.

This recipe sounded like a crazy mix of ingredients when I first read it. I was happily surprised with how great & easy this recipe is. I have made it several times and use non-fat plain yoghurt. Be careful not to undercook the chicken.

This dish has a nice flavor and texture. I would actually give it two and a half forks because there are more exciting dishes out there but it is overall quite nice.

My family loved this dish. It is so easy to prepare and the chicken is so tender it melts in your mouth(I marinated it all day in fridge). A definite keeper!

The yogurt really makes the chicken tender and the feta gives it a nice tangy taste. Easy to make and doesn't require a lot of time. My husband and I loved it and it is definitely being added to my recipe box!

This dish is easy to prepare and very stylish to serve. Chicken remains moist and flavorful. Feta cheese and yogart give this chicken a great, almost tangy after taste.
