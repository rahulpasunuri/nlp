I agree with the last comment on the "pork chop" reveiw. Reviews are supposed to be helpful, not ridiculous. Please don't bother reveiwing a dish that you didn't even make!

How could you be reviewing a recipe you didn't even follow? Mussels are not similar to pork chops nor is coconut milk similar to almond milk - in any way.

What a great dish!! I will definitely make this again! I'm not a fan of coconut milk, so I substituted unsweetened almond milk. And I'm allergic to shellfish so I substituted the mussels with pork chops. I've never liked ginger (it's too spicy!!!), but I used it anyway, to maintain the 'ethnic' flavors of the dish. And of course I used 2 tsp lemon juice instead of that pesky lemon grass, which is so hard to prepare! Serve it on a bed of lightly buttered egg noodles and you have a dish to make the neighbors jealous!

Sorry, I found this broth downright nasty. I made as directed and thankfully tasted before I added the mussels...horrible! I tried adding some sugar, didn't make it better. Didn't bother to complete, will try another mussel recipe tomorrow. Possibly using sweetened rather than unsweetened coconut milk may help.

The recipe is missing salt. I add some salt, sugar,some corn starch, and black pepper. Replace Italian parsley with cilantro. It turns out more than I expect the I cook it the first time. It absolutely is in one of my all-time favorite dish during holidays
