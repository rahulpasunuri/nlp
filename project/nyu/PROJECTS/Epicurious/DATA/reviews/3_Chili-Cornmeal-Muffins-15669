These are an excellent variation of corn muffins. They are a more orange color due to the chili poswder for sure. We added cheddar cheese and everyone young and old loved them. Very moist. The second time we made these, I allowed the batter to sit for a while so that the courser corn meal will absorb some moisture before baking. This resulted in a softer crumb. Delish.

Great-tasting but color is off, really missed the gold of traditional cornbread. Made 18 muffins in standard muffin tins filled 2/3 but didn't rise as much as regular muffins do. Canned corn worked fine.

I think that a little extra sweetness would be better and will try these with more sugar next time. Nonetheless, they disappeared in a flash at my Thanksgiving table!

We didn't care for them much in our household. They held together nicely, but the texture was too grainy compared to other corn muffin recipes.

I was looking for a muffin recipe that would be similar to the spicy sweet corn muffins served at a lot of Southwest restaurants here. This was perfect. I will definitely make it again, whenever I am doing a southwest-type dinner.

I made these to accompany Gourmet's Vegetable and Bean Chili and it was wonderful. Such a good texture and sweet/spicy flavor. My husband devoured them. Be careful not to let them dry out--I took them out a little early. I also used the buttermilk powder and it worked fine.

a delicious accompaniment to chili...these muffins have a wonderful texture and flavour, they remind me of corn bread.

I have been asked to make this recipe three times now. I am unable to buy fresh buttermilk locally so must use the dried buttermilk powder. This works very well. I bake a batch of muffins or breads once a week from Bon Appetit and Gourmet recipes, and my efforts are greatly appreciated by friends . Needless to say, I owe it all to Bon Appetit and Gourmet. Many thanks. B.Fausold, Dorset England

I also add as much cheese as I think the recipe will bear. Then we crumble it up over the Chilli instead of crackers. Delish!!!!!! Also good with for breakfast with butter and orange marmalade
