Awful. Can't figure out why the good reviews. I used the best quality ingredients, but this is a bitter, bitter, sauce, with very little character to it other than that. One word of caution if you're going to try it anyway: don't add vinegar until you've tasted it. And it really does need anchovies...or something, to give it saltiness, and some sort of base flavor. I'm throwing away the whole batch I made.

This was fantastic. I used it with halibut steamed in parchment with lemon, olive oil, and white wine. It was divine!! I was thinking that it would also work well with steak, chicken, or shrimp. We have leftovers, which I am considering tossing with whole wheat pasta and sun dried tomatoes for a quick dinner for one later in the week.

TO FINELY CHOP CAPERS: Smash down the capers a little so that they do not fly all over the place while chopping. TO PREVENT IT FROM TURNING INTO MAYONAISE: Do not over process the ingredients. Over processing it adds too much air into the mixture, causing the mayonnaise look. Best to finely chop the items.=)

quite good, and very easy. I could use this on a wide variety of grilled meats, poultry and seafood.

This has become my staple for a quick and easy 'company is coming' dish. It is great with a simply grilled filet of beef. love it!

I made this salsa with grilled salmon for a bbq and it was a huge hit. Added mint and anchovies to give it some kick and made it the night before to ensure the flavours melded. Would definitely make it again!

This was so easy to make and tasted heavenly on grilled salmon. I did add a little mayo for a creamy texture and it was still unbelievably good. Also, adding the mayo did keep it from separating so quickly.

Turned a bland meat into something wonderful! (I made it ahead of time, in the food processor, forget to add the vinegar before serving, and it was still a hit.) I tried chopping it by hand, but the capers were all over the place: the food processor was just the ticket!

Awesome!! I followed the recommendations from previous reviews (red onion, anchovies, fine chop instead of food processor). A hint of Tabasco also added more punch. Try this sauce with grilled Mahi-Mahi or your favorite fish.

I followed the tips from the other reviewers. I also used red onion instead of shallots as that is what I had. I added cilantro and anchovies to the mix. Instead of using a food processor I finely chopped all ingrediants by hand. Very good salsa with a piquant taste.

Right ingredients; wrong method. This came out looking like green mayonaise, not what I wanted. Next time I will simply chop everything very fine, and whisk together. Perhaps and mortar and pestle would work, but I've never had great luck with them. Also agree with the previous reveiwer that a couple anchovy filets are in order, and perhaps some cilantro.

try snipping two or three anchovy fillets into the mix
