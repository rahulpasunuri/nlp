I love this recipe! It turned out really well, especially having read the reviews to double the chicken rub. I substituted lentils for the potatoes, left out the raisins, and added a few squeezes of lemon juice. I think I doubled the figs too. The chicken came out tender and delicious!

I have a fig tree and the figs are only fresh for about 2 weeks. I tried this recipe and it was wonderful.

This dish is definitely a keeper. I did use more curry, plus I added some fresh mandarin sections just before serving. Yummy I plan to serve this at our next family get-together.

How can you dislike this?! Admittedly I love sweeter Jewish food, but still! I will make this again and again! I did add a pinch of cayenne to the chicken rub, used calimyrna figs and added a bit more curry powder and worcestershire to the sauce, but oh was it good!

Liked this a lot - thanks to the input from all of the folks who came before me. Definitely needs more oomph. I would double the rub amounts - the chicken itself was moist but not that flavorful. I did substitute garbanzos for the potatoes. I think i might try the potatoes next time... Served it over couscous. I also made a side dish that rocked with it - just 1-inch chunks of eggplant tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper roasted for 20 minutes then tossed with red wine vinegar and fresh basil. Lovely savory meal.

Yummy! I added more figs, potatoes and raisins than the recipes called for. Would def. make again.

I substituted chickpeas for potatoes, used extra curry powder and spice rub and served over rice. I used boneless, skinless breasts and didn't have a problem with the meat becoming dry; it was juicy and tender. Though very good, the recipe as written is quite sweet. Next time I make this I'll try to add a bit more depth of flavor and some kick. I'll marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight, use lots more figs and a bit of cayenne, and saute the onions first, then brown the chicken and deglaze with some wine before adding the sauce.

My husband loved this dish and normally he wouldn't go near a fig. I also eliminated the potatoes and served it over couscous. I sauted the onion in a dutch oven before adding the rubbed chicken and added most of the spices that leahprichep recommended below. used boneless skinless chicken breasts and it cooked in a third of the time but would try bone-in breasts and thighs next time for juicier meat.

This is amazing, definitely let it sit until the next day or following day. The sweet flavors mellow with the spices and is ultra delish. I did add a large shake of crushed chili flakes as other reviews note. I think next time I will not use potatoes but add chickpeas and serve over cous cous, seems more authentic and attractive than potato/rice which was too starchy.

I made this dish with chicken breast tenders. Was careful not to overcook. The sauce was runny and I made it a day ahead, as suggested; I would prefer a thicker sauce. I measured the black figs after I had cut them in half; I would double the figs. Overall, it was easy and good, but not great.

I also had some trouble with the recipe. It had no kick. So I changed it in the following manner. Double the spice rub, used 6 chicken breasts, saute the onion, deglaze the pan with some wine (Melbec). The most important change was adding some lemon juice(2-3tbl),1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to the sauce. I also added some chick peas and served the chicken over cous cous.

Very yum. I used dried cranberries rather than raisins for something a little sour, added more curry than called for and fresh minced garlic rather than powder. I also used red potatoes with skins on. For those who didn't use figs--you must. They tasted wonderful. A great fall dish

Oh so good! I also bought the cookbook because I was so impressed with this dish--I clicked on the link to the book and knew I had to have it. My advice? Get the book. It's full of amazing recipes. I made this without the onions because my little boy thinks he doesn't like them. Next time, I'll add them in. I didn't have any garlic powder on hand, so left that out. I squeezed the oranges myself. I also left out the potatoes for the same reaons mentioned by others--too much starch. The chicken was very, very moist, and the entire dish was outstanding. We really enjoyed it. I'll definitely add the onions next time. I think I'll also try boneless, skinless chicken breasts, perhaps add some chile for spice. I think I'd also like to try this in the crock pot. The sauce was fantastic served over rice (I used brown basmati, becuase that's what I had on hand, and I love it--I don't care for white rice). The raisins were delicious and my one-year-old gobbled them up. Defintely a keeper, but needs some fine tuning. I'm looking forward to experimenting with this one.

My mother used to make Orange Chicken when I was a child. It was my favorite dish, always requested for my Birthday dinner. I looked to the recipe to re-create the dish. I omitted the potatoes & figs, and added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. It was exactly like mom used to make! Excellent.

Good flavor balance. Improvised on the syrian rice (just made something up for lack of the actual recipe). A keeper.

Made this delicious recipe for a friend who had just given birth with a few changes due to dietary restrictions, and because I didn't have the ingredients handy. Instead of potatoes, I cubed up the oranges and I omitted the onions (at their request -- I would have definitely left them in if I was making for myself.)

I loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again!! I did not add potatoes because I served the dish with rice and that seemed like too many carbs :) The flavors were delicious and the figs just melted--incredible! I made the spiced rice on this site which was flavored with saffron, cinnamon, & cloves--YUM!

I made this without onions, but liked it non-the-less. Althought, I did find it a bit sweet (maybe a a result of no onion) and wondered if the addition of something spicy might be interesting.

Great idea - I LOVE dinners with fruits roasted into them. Especially of this variety - only changes I made were adding dates and a little honey. The sauce was good but lacked punch. I even bought the curry powder on India Row and bought the Med-hot curry. Still no punch. So next time, more seasoning. Less OJ. But still good and E-A-S-Y.

To the person who wondered what could be used in lieu of the processed ingredients: (soy sauce, worcestshire sauce, etc...) - I imagine the author didn't list the spices because they were trying to simplify the recipe? At any rate, I'm going to try using a "curry" mixture of cumin, coriander, cardamom (pods) and just a little bit of cinnamon - usually I throw it in the pot as a half-stick and take it out when done. Fresh chiles add heat, turmeric adds the yellowish color. Try tamarind pulp (soak first in H2O) for the worcestshire; perhaps just salt (to taste) for soy sauce? Good luck! :)

didnt have figs, so left them out. didnt have golden raisins, so used currants. served. WOW. so delicious for such little effort. let simmer for recommended time so potatoes cook through.

okay well wochestershire sauce, curry powder and soy sauce are all prepared products which have no business in Syrien cooking. My question is can anybody tell me what are the original ingredients for this dish. I HATE wochestershire sauce(sp?) I like the fruit/figs. There must be a way to fix up this recipe with original ingredients. Does anybody have an idea?

Good and unusual. However, found it not a "guy" dish (at least my guys), so probably will not make again. Also, chicken finished cooking before the potatoes (not sure how to fix that). And figs disintegrated in the pot.

Served it for company last night, they loved it! I also used skinless, boneless breasts. Served with rice and salad ,should have gone with the buttered green beans instead of the rice. Made it two days ahead and the chicken was moist and super tender. P.S I agree with the Alberta reader, stop putting adds in the printer ready recipe!

While the chicken was tender and moist, there was enough flavour to make it outstanding. More of all spices, perhaps, or a kick with chile flakes would make this better.

We adored this dish. I made it for company and as the recipe states it is even better reheated, I made it the day before and reheated it which cuts down on the work. The only thing that I did differently was I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were just fine, incredibly moist, tender and falling apart. I did not serve it over rice as I felt that with the potatoes, there would be too much starch so I served it with a green salad, crusty rolls and steamed buttered green beans. It was delightful and so flavorful. This is definitely a keeper and a great company recipe. We also decided that it probably would be good served over rice but we didn't miss it.
