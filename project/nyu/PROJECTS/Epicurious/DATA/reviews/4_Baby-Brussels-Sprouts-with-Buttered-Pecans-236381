brussel sprouts

Rating: 4
When I ran across some tiny baby Brussels Sprouts in the grocery store, I snatched them up and then went hunting for a recipe worthy of their splendor. This recipe is it: Simple, easy, delightfully flavorful -- and even (surprisingly) makes good leftovers. I.e., the perfect Thanksgiving side dish! I pretty much followed the recipe as is, except forgot to salt the pecans after roasting but found nothing suffered for it. Highly recommend. 

I made a few alterations to the recipe that added a little more flavor. When making brussels sprouts I cut them in half unless they are really tiny. I place cut side down on the pan and let them get nicely browned and then I give the pan a shake and let them finish cooking. I also added red pepper flakes to the recipe to give the brussels a little kick which is a nice balance to the buttered pecans. In addition I used a splash of olive oil when sautéing for additional flavor.

When I try a recipe for the first time I stick to the original. I altered my technique in preparation slightly. I normally toast nuts in a pan to monitor their progress. I steamed the sprouts as I do all my vegetables. I removed them from the steam and removed the lid to cool down. In the final prep, I used a cast iron skillet to brown the vegetable in the butter. I then added the garlic to keep it from burning and giving a bitter taste. I finished the dish with the lemon juice and fresh ground pepper. I probably didn't have the best testing audience since they all like Brussels Sprouts.

My advice is to not follow the directions that tell you that you can parboil these a day ahead. Even though I thoroughly drained them and stored them with a paper towel, they ended up being both underdone and waterlogged, as if they'd been frozen. Though I used baby sprouts, I will halve them next time I try this recipe and also leave the pecan halves intact.

I am not a sprouts lover but find new appreciation for this veggie. This recipe is awesome and perfect for Thanksgiving. We have now eaten it 4-5 years in a row. I think the big brussel sprouts are fine if cut in half. The babies had no advantage for me. buttered and salted pecans are key! Yum, yum!

I am a definite brussels sprout lover, so this recipe was perfect for the holidays. Brussels sprouts are in season this time of year, making them easy to find and a way better alternative to the standard green bean casserole. I couldn't find Baby Brussels, so I use their full-sized counterparts with no complaints. Candied nuts are one of my favorite sweet additions, so the buttered ones here definitely hit the spot. But then again, how can you go wrong with butter? Perfectly rich and satisfying for a holiday meal!

Really good. Really easy. I didn't alter the recipe on purpose; I mistakenly added more butter. It was delicious. I steam my brussels instead of boiling, and I didn't put them in cold water, just right from the steamer to the hot pan of butter and garlic.

These were excellent, though I admit I ate most of them off my husband's plate after he said he could only eat a few (he's not a lover Brussels sprouts). I used regular Brussels sprouts and cut them in half. I also added a touch of white wine to the garlic and lemon juice mix. Next time I will add a tiny bit of maple syrup to the sprouts to help the caramelization.

Very good recipe. I would suggest not boiling the sprouts too long so that they don't become mushy. I did not add butter to the pecans but toasted them directly in the skillet which I then used to saute the sprouts. The lemon definitely adds to the taste and we liked seasoning with a bit of spicy salt. Will definitely do again.

I had high hopes for this dish, and it just didn't meet my expectations. I did two things that I would recommend against. First, I had already bought full-sized brussel sprouts at our farmer's market, and I think I should have waited until I had "baby" sprouts for this recipe (or perhaps I should have cut them in half). I also added more butter than the recipe called for based on others; reviews, which did add flavor but made the dish too rich much for my taste. Though I love brussel sprouts, I probably won't make this again.

I liked it, am already a brussels sprouts lover. Thinking next time I make this, I want to use more nuts, and perhaps in place of some the butter, sautee the sprouts in bacon fat. I think it would take it from great to phenomenal.

These were excellent and the pecans added a great crunch. When I make it again though I will increase the time I boil the brussels sprouts by a couple minutes.

Best brussel sprouts I've ever had!

Aside from reducing the salt and adding more lemon juice, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! My childhood memories are of mushy, smelly brussels sprouts and for decades that kept me from buying them, until I found some of the fabulous Brussels sprout recipes on Epicurious. Skeptics, take the plunge, you won't be disappointed!

Reliable recipe for brussel sprouts. Tried it because I had some pecans on hand. I would stick to the sautee method and finish with a good balsamic vs. tossing in the pecans. Good but not amazing.

Made this during T-Day. Everybody loved it even those who hate brussel sprouts. I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.

Very good! This was my first time making brussels sprouts, and it came out great. I made the sprouts and pecans a day and ahead and it worked out nicely. I roasted the pecans in a skillet and liked this method because it allowed me to keep a close eye and nose on them. I also added some brown sugar to the pecans (about 2 tbsp total). I liked the flavor, but had problems with little bits of sugar lumping together in the butter. I had to be careful to get these sugar lumps out before combining with the sprouts. Adding a little sugar at a time didn't help. Next time I would try honey, as I think it would mix in more smoothly and evenly. Thanks to other reviewers for the great suggestions.

A real Hit! Got a compliment with this recipe when my family usually makes negative comments about brussel sprouts.

I've made this recipe several times and it's a total home-run. Tasty and delicious! I've always used walnuts and quartered regular-brussel sprouts instead since that's what I've had and it's the bomb diggity.

Fabulous, quick and easy. I left out the garlic and pepper. Used juice from 1/2 lemon. Excellent. Can't wait to buy more brussels sprouts.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Easy and delicious. I made a few changes to simplify. I toasted the nuts (I used pine nuts) on a cast iron pan over medium (w/o oil). Transferred nuts to a bowl and followed rest of recipe. Saves cleaning an extra pan and heating up the oven. :)

Very good. I used quartered regular Brussels sprouts. Seems like it could use way more nuts, and more of everything else, too, puny proportions as written, so add more of everything at will!

I'm not a fan of brussell sprouts, and am always looking for new ways to prepare. This was very good! Next time I might add some orange juice & zest just to brighten it up a bit.

sooo good!! perfect recipe for a first-time brussel sprout taster! I had never had brussel sprouts but my husband loves them, so I figured it was time to try them. This recipe was great... with and without the nuts! We will be having this dish again and again! Oh and I loved how the nuts stepped up the look of the dish... perfect to impress company!

Cooked this for T'giving and everyone loved it, even those who don't normally like sprouts. Like another reviewer, I chose small sprouts and cut them in half...also decreased salt to a dash and increased garlic slightly and lemon lots. Watch out, pecans brown quickly once they get started. Highly recommended!

Used regular size sprouts, cardamon seeds rather that garlic and hazelnuts rather than pecans. Excellent with Thanksgiving dinner!

Wow, this recipe is delicious. Now I will never understand how brussel sprouts have earned a reputation for unpleasantness. I toasted my pecans in a skillet (the same I use to brown the brussel sprouts) to save on dishes, and I have made this recipe without the garlic and lemon juice - it is still tasty.

My husband loved this dish, and I ate my portion with gusto even though I don't particularly like brussel sprouts! I appreciated the make ahead feature as I tend to prepare complicated menus even on a busy weeknight. This was straightforward and delicious, will definitely do again.

I am a new brussels spouts lover. I melt 1 T butter on the baking sheet while the oven preheats and I trim the sprouts. Then I toss the sprouts with olive oil, S & P, with the pecans then toss them onto the pan. In the oven for about 10 minutes. Great! Roasting takes away that funky brussels spouts taste that I think everyone dislikes. I've tried these with almonds, but pecans are better. All brussels sprouts lovers rave about this.

This was pretty good. It was an interesting assortment of flavors, especially the bite of fresh lemon juice and garlic. I prepped the pecans and sprouts the night before as the receipe suggested, for what that's worth. A few tips: Watch out when toasting the pecans. They can go from almost done to burnt in a flash. I think the 10 minutes the recipe suggests is about two minutes too long. I'd do eight minutes next time. They weren't burnt, but they were smokey. Alone, they tasted odd, but when combined with everything, the smokiness worked well. Still, be careful. But don't be worried if they come out tasting smokey at first. I'd also add more butter to the sprouts. I used frozen sprouts b/c I couldn't find fresh babies. They were still a bit big. Halving them would have taken forever as I was cooking for eighteen and nearly doubled this recipe. Still wound up with plenty leftover, so I think the recipe as written serves more like 12 if it is one of many Thanksgiving sides. Lastly, I would consider adding a little sweetener to the pecans like some other reviewers mentioned. You could also save some time by substituting ready-made honey roaster pecans if you can find them.

This was a great way to make Brussels. I used olive oil instead of butter to make it non-dairy for a guest. I definitely felt it was best eaten when ready (although it's fine to prep the pecans ahead of time). Re-warming leftovers significantly lowered the taste a notch.

I made this dish for a fall harvest themed potluck and it was so easy to make. It looked lovely and was the only dish that was completly devored! So Yummy!!! My only warning is if you buy organic which I do be prepared for a surprise! I paid 14$ for 2 lbs!!!!

I enjoyed this side dish with a pork tenderloin. The nuts were yummy, almost predominated the brussel sprouts but overall it was yummy. I generally don't like brussel sprouts but this recipe is worth keeping.

The dish was tasty enough. It was just too complicated. I had to dirty three pans to complete this dish. Why not just roasted the brussel sprouts garlic and nuts in the oven (see frisee salad with brussel sprouts and pecans).

After making these sprouts at Thanksgiving, they have been added to my arsenal of side dishes that are sure to impress. Made them the night before and had all I could do not to devour them right then. Deelish!

I've made this with both baby and regular brussel sprouts and have been pleased on each occasion. The buttered pecans really make this dish delicious.

Rating: 1
I made these for Thanksgiving and nobody was impressed. I would say maybe it could be improved with about 3 times the amount of butter, but probably not. The pecans just fell off the sprouts into the bottom of the bowl. They needed something like a thick sauce to stay with the sprouts. I did like the browned sprouts, and may cook them that way again, however.

Absolutely delicious! These were so easy to make that even I - the person my friends describe as having a culinary handicap - was able to make them. We've had them many times when guests were over and everyone loves them.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. I thought it was good, but not great. Given the choice between frozen baby brussels sprouts and fresh regular brussels sprouts, I opted to use the frozen. I've never cooked brussels sprouts before -- I may not have boiled or sauteed them long enough.

Well received for Thanksgiving. I found smaller conventional brussels sprouts and halved them. I added a little brown sugar with the butter and salt to the toasted pecans, which added a candied/sweet element to it. Season the dish well!

Fresh Brussel sprouts are not to be missed. These are very similar to ones I regularly make, except I regularly use toasted hazel nuts, instead of pecans. Now, for a mind-blowing excercize in 'good', omit the garlic and add about 1/2 teaspoon of crushed cardamom seed, (not cardamom powder), at the end. Fresh brussel sprouts with cardamom will turn most every sprout- hater into a brussel sprout lover!!

my friend doesn't like brussel sprouts, but she had some of her boyfriend's, and then her own bowl! it was pretty easy to make and tasty. I added honey to the nuts.

I had to go pick up our dinner guests while my husband made this recipe. He'd never had brussell sprouts before, but it turned out absolutely delicious. We had the regular "mature" brussells, and my only regret is that we didn't make more because it blew out everyone's superstitions of this vegetable. We'll be making this more often. (We served on the side of a flakey white fish and chestnut soup, and it was perfect!)

I served these at Christmas dinner. I candied the pecans with some honey and butter. I also added some honey to the sprouts just before serving. My non Brussels sprout eating children, now adults loved them. I is a do over.

I dislike brussel sprouts, but my boyfriend loves them. So, when I saw this recipe, I decided to give them a try. Loved them. I even had seconds! Made twice and the 2nd was not as good because I bought bagged - it's really key to hand pick the smallest out of the bunch and bag them yourself. I also added a teaspoon of sugar to the butter, which I really liked. Really a turn around dish for me.

I just served this for Thanksgiving - delicious. Even those who aren't fans of brussel sprouts really liked them. Next time, I'll add a bit more garlic.
