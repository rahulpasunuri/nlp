This chili was excellent! However, I did make some modifications to the original recipe. Instead of using any water, I took the advice of some of the other reviewers, and I used 1 bottle of beer and beef broth. I also added 1 28oz can of peeled, unsalted tomatoes and 2 fresh jalapenos. We will definitely make this recipe again!

This is about my 7th time making this recipe and I think it is the best chili recipe out there!! I follow the directions almost exactly but I cook it in a crock pot for about 12 hours, it is so tender and you dont have to worry about how small you cut the meat because it breaks apart anyway. I have made it in the recommended time of 2 1/2 hours and its not nearly as good. I also double or even triple the recipe and freeze lunches for my husband, I serve with cilantro, chopped onions, sour cream, cheese and sometimes baked potatoes!!! Definatly use the crockpot makes all the difference!!!

Excellent chili. We followed the advice of other reviewers and used two cans of beer rather than water. We also added two cups of canned chopped tomatoes and some beans. It's not authentic but it tastes good. We added a slurry made with masa flour in lieu of the cornmeal at the end of the cooking. Would suggest splurging on good quality pure ground chili powder rather than using the commercial stuff. It adds just the right amount of spice. Would also suggest cutting the meat into smaller pieces. Freezes well.

Very good, but be careful with the liquid amounts. I followed the recipe exactly (but used half beer for the liquid), but it turned out too watery. The key is the "just barely cover the beef" part, not the five cup direction. It was good enough even so that I will try it again.

Very easy and yummy. The only change I made was using olive oil instead of bacon. My BF, who lived in Texas for years and is not easy to please chili-wise, LOVED this, which surprised me, especially since it's not spicy at all. I actually used this chili to make the chili-cornmeal pie on this site.

this is a wonderful reipe. simple and to the point. this is the way chili is supposed to be. If you don't like spicy foods you shouldn't be allowed to make or eat chili.

Ha ha ha! I laugh at the Canadian's sensitivity to spicy food! Gee, I wonder what Canadian chili (if there is such a thing) would taste like. This is a really good basic recipe but I grew up with tomatoes in my chili so I put in a big can of tomatoes and use beef broth or beer instead of some of the water. Sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese and some chopped onions on this, grab some saltines and a cold beer, kick back and think of the Lone Star State!

this recipe is FAR TOO hot (spicy). I was extremely disappointed.

I'd rather give it 2.5 stars. Better than two, but not the best. Of course, there were some changes. I couldn't find a good, pure ground chili powder (used to be able to get them easily when I lived in DC) so I went to a Salvadoran market that sells whole dried peppers, bought a range of them, soaked them in some hot canned low-salt beef stock (which is still a tad salty, so I reduced the salt in the recipe), and ground the peppers with some of the liquid in my food processor to make a paste. I used considerably more than 1/3 cup, but the balance of chilis I used wasn't THAT hot, so I figured a bit more would be good. I also found it a tad bitter, so a hit of honey and a hit of balsamic balanced the flavors. It was good, and I'll make it again, but I think I'll substitute beer for some of the water and use more cumin and some mexican oregano.

I thought this chili was very good. I would definetly make this again. I used dried peppers instead of powder peppers that was mentioned in the recipe. I soaked dried mexican peppers. Cutting off the stem and taking out the seeds. Reserved the juice and put peppers in a food processor. Poured the juice from peppers over the peppers in a strainer. I didn't use the peppers because they had skin on them. Also, I used beer instead of water. I served it with cilantro on top, and cut up green onions with a splash of lime juice. The meat came out very tender. This would be great for a large crowd just make ahead and enjoy your company.

After reading some of the negative reviews, I found myself wondering if the chili and cumin powder used didn't have something to do with the negative outcomes. Since the recipe is for "basic, real chili" (no tomato, no beans or other "extras"), I think that not so good (or not so fresh) spices would make a big difference. I used top quality, freshly ground Chipotle powder(5 or 6 on a heat scale of 10) along with freshly ground cumin, and the result was terrific. I substitued beer for about half the water and thickened with a minimal cornstarch slurry at the last minute. Preparation hint: use a parchment lid while braising this or any dish for several hours stovetop. It allows adequate evaporation, but doesn't require additional liquid that would throw off the balance.

This recipe was okay - it is actually really hard to make bad chili. I recommend making sure that you use a wide enough pan when browning the meat. If the meat releases a lot of liquid, make sure you cook it long enough until the juices evaporate -- otherwise you do get an odd taste. As for the cook from Missouri - it seems everything seems to make your family sick (as you reviewed a guacamole recipe) and I don't see why you'd blame epicurious for not remembering how much chili powder you put in.

Great recipe! I'm fond of old home recipes, gourmet foods, and 5 star cuicines as much as the next person. For those who prefer the latter of the 3, should stay away from these recipes in the first place. I once had a bowl of chili in a very nice Seattle restaurant that when served struck me as too much sugar and not enough spice. I asked for hot sauce and that, was nowhere near Tabasco. None the less, I was hungry and made the best of thier "Gourmet Chili". We should remember those that paved the way; our ancestors that roughed it by living on the very recipes that today people change and claim their ethnicity. Recipes are butchered by people that seem to believe they must lead a busy lifestyle, always in a hurry, but have plenty of time to correct mistakes. I say; slow down (fewer corrections)smell the roses, enjoy the view and most important, savour the meal that you or someone spent their time preparing. You never know, it may be your last. Credit to those that at least try any recipe. BTW, In 1902 William Gebhardt, a German Immigrant in New Braunfels, Texas, created a "chili powder" which helped popularize chili throughout the Southwest. His brand is still one of the most popular, and specified in many recipes. Source for Gebhardt's Chili Powder. I grew up where jalapenos or serano peppers create the "Chili" in chili. And as for beans, sometimes we do use beans but only 1 part to 3 parts beef. The mexican peasants would use beans as a filler to help feed their family. And today the poor still do. That's a history lesson for this book. To everyone, enjoy your every meal or as they say Bon Appetit!

I am not sure why everyone thinks this chili is so great. It isn't exactly bad but I thought it needed a lot of extras. I added a bottle of beer and a can of tomato puree in place of all the water-although I did add one cup of water. I also added a Tbl. spoon of cayenne and a Tbl. spoon of paprika. I also added a can of green chilies and a lot more cumin then it wanted. I found the taste rather bitter so I added a little balalmic vinegar and a teaspoon of sugar. It came out well but I thought it tasted more like the chili that you put on a hot dog or chili cheese fries. I enjoyed it but it was a little too basic for me as I like more gourmet type chili. This recipe is very much like Texas style RED chili which in my opinion is pretty bland. However, I do think this is a good starter recipe and you really can spice it up.

This recipe is unbelievably basic and easy to accomplish. Tell your kids it's cowboy food because this is the way they made it on the range! I served over long grain white rice and topped with a dollop of sour cream, fresh chopped cilantro, and shredded cheddar. Divine!

This is the way my dear mother has always made chili. I'm ashamed to say I never made it before because it always seemed like too much work, but after making this, I realized that she just didn't serve it the first day, as it's so much better the second! I believe she also used less water, as her version was always a little dryer. Needless to say, I'll be making this again (and again, and again).

Welll....actually despite Mexican myths about the origins of chili...the fact is that chili was invented in TEXAS by a GERMAN. Go figure... But I guess those funny origins make it uniquely American. Enjoy, y'all!

A perfect dish for a potluck. I took it last night and it was the only dish to be completely devoured with people asking for the recipe. I made some of the previous reviewers alterations: one can of beef stock, one 14 oz. can diced tomtatoes and 2 Tbsp. good quality sweet Hungarian paprika, omit the salt, cool it overnight & skim the fat. I used mild Mexican chili because some folks don't like the heat, but provided a bottle of chipotle chili sauce. I also had a side dish of chopped green onions, cilantro and sour cream for toppers. The green and deep red contrast richly dressed it up. One woman said she'd make this for her kids to roll up in warm tortilas. An excellent idea I will try.

I'am going to try this recipe of chili sauce. But this is not chili because it has no beans. Because anyone who knows anything about the history of chili, knows that it can not be chili if it has no beans, unless they think that texas invented chili which it did not. it was a mexican dish invented by poor people of mexico who had no meat for protene so they used beans which have protene. So it follows if you leave out beans it is no longer chili its if anything chili sauce. Hey add beans you got chili!!!

Variations to make it perfect: cut the beef, onions, and garlic in half; as an earlier reviewer noted, substitute 1 12-oz. bottle good beer and 1 14-oz. can diced tomatoes for the water; and leave all other ingredients at full volume. Spicy, flavourful and RICH.

This chili was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. It is on the mild side, so next time I might add some cayenne pepper. It's probably best made a day in advance so the grease can congeal in the fridge overnight for easy removal. We loved it.

Yum! definitely one of the best chilis I've ever had. I added crushed tomatoes instead of cornmeal to thicken the sauce, and added some ground red pepper to make it hotter.

Very good! I needed to add some hot sauce and extra cornmeal. I plan on making it again, soon. MarieB

A true Texas Chili. Very hard to find a decent recipe that isn't sullied with beans. If you want bean soup go ahead and add some beans. But if you want chili, make this recipe! I did replace the water with beer and a can of stewed tomatoes. Chili has to be RED!

as we say in Texas - "people who know beans about chili know there are no beans in chili"! A fairly good recipe but not as good as great-gran's circa 1890 recipe (sans lard)

I have said it before and I will say it again, chili isn't chili without the beans! LOL I did like adding the bacon, it gave it a smokey flavor

Very good chili and easy to make. I added a little more bacon then called for, (12oz, diced)and cut back 2cups of water and replaced with 2 cups of beef broth and a small can of tomato sauce. The extra amount of smoked bacon really gave this chili a nice taste.

I substituted 2 bottles of beer, (I used chili-beer) for some of the water, and a light beef broth for the rest, which made it richer.

I give it a 3 for having most of the elements of honest to God Texas chili. However, it is way too mild. Add at least 3 tsp. Cayenne pepper. Also 3Tbs. paprika for color & balance. 1 or 2 chipotles minced, would also be good.
