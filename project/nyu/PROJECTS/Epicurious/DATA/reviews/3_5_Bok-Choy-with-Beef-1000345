Followed directions exactly except stir fried the beef rather than "deep" frying. We all thought it was bland. Maybe the extra balsamic and garlic that others had as suggestions would help. The red pepper suggested would work well here,too. Better stir fry recipes out there.

Made one-half of this recipe tonight, and it was WONDERFUL, served with plain old sticky rice!!! Used light soy sauce and subbed charcoal steak for the tenderloin. Also, used regular (not baby) bok choy, so I blanched the pieces a tad longer. Stir-fried the beef in only a couple Tbs. of oil. Next time I would eliminate the step of draining the oil soaked meat by stir-frying the garlic and ginger first in the reduced amount of oil, then add the beef to stir fry it, and then add in the soy mixture and blanched bok choy. Do try this. VERY, VERY YUMMY.

Good dish! Like others, I stir fried the meat, and used pre-cut strips.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Like others before, I skipped the deep-fat frying stage and stir fried the beef. I used peanut oil, which enhaces the oriental flavours and, of course, added extra garlic. I frequently blanch vegetables before cooking to enhance the colour, so I did not skip that step. This is a keeper for a regular mid- week meal.

Excellent recipe but I, too, took advice from other reviewers and stir-fried rather than fry the beef beforehand, Added a bit of crushed red pepper, and didn't blanch the bok choy. An omission which yielded a good result was forgetting the additional soy mixture - just added the "un-authentic" balsamic to the marinade (in which I used a tsp of honey to sub for the sugar), and there was more than enough sauce. Definitely a dish to be made again!!

I took the reviewers' advice and stir-fried the beef rather than frying it and added more garlic. Also, rather than tenderloin, I bought beef already sliced thin for carne asada and simply cut it in strips. My family loved it and took multiple helpings.

As is, this was a lot of work. If I made it again, I don't think I would fry the beef in advance, I'd just stir fry it. My family thought it had an odd taste. The bok choy came out good, though.

This is a great dish of greens, the fried beef isn't bad either. I added some chilli sauce to the marinade and doubled the greens, which I substituted with Yu-Choy.

Made this recipe with a pork tenderloin I had on hand and it was very good. Used a tad more balsamic than recipe called for to "beef up" the flavor

This was very good. I would not use a cheaper cut of beef. The tenderloin was wonderful. I did not deep fry it first; I just stir fried it. I added the meat a little before the veggies. I would make it again for sure.

Good flavor, but if you're looking for authentic Chinese dishes, this isn't one of them.

Oh my gosh - we loved this recipe! We changed a few things using 1 tbsp of sugar as previously suggested, a less expensive thinly sliced sirloin tip - which worked beautifully - plus carrots,endive and italian parsley. Yummie!

Great recipe. I substituted chicken with this and it came out great!! I also left out the Vinegar and Sugar, I also added a couple dashes of teriyaki sauce to the marinade and Bok Choy. This is too good to pass up!! I think rice wine is a bit to salty for my taste so I used a Light Merlot. The key is to not over cook the bok choy. Keep it quick and don't turn the heat up too high or it will wilt to fast.

I agree with the cook from Los Angeles. Never deep fry the meat first. I cut the sugar to 1 Tab. which was plenty. Just skip the deep fried section and continue with receipe.

Quite simply this was one of the best stir fry dishes we have ever made or eaten in a restaurant It may not be authentic Chinese but the flavor and texture of the deep fried beef was just luscious. We will certainly make it again. I can imagine that additional ingredients as suggested (carrot, asparagus, red pepper) may be quite nice, but we enjoyed the simplicity of the published recipe

Obviously this is a Westernized stir-fry ie. balsamic vinegar. Also, real stir-fry is not deep fried and definately does not have that much sugar--maybe at the most 1 teaspoon of sugar. I am biased and tend to like more authentic provincial style Chinese food. This is too sweet and not refined tasting.

This recipe is terrific. I rarely follow a recipe to the letter but did so here, using filet mignon and baby bok choy from the farmer's market. The beef was soft on the inside but seared on the outside and took on a smoky flavor that was fantastic. I served it with basamati rice. I cannot wait to make it again.

Here's to the recipe that got my young sons to eat bok choy ! (Well, actually i had to substitute totchoy because the shop was out of bok choy.) Excellent, quick and easy family meal.

Overall a pretty likable dish. I did, however, substitute beef for chicken, added some sliced carrots and dried shitake mushrooms, and left out the sherry (didn't have any). I also added some fresh green onions and used some of the water used to rehydrate the mushrooms. I would add a bit more ginger and hot chili sauce next time to increase the zing factor. I only used one chicken breast but the dish goes a long way--three huge servings!

This was excellent!! I did add 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper as we prefer a little bite to our food. Second time around, I used asparagus, carrots and a small onion sliced in thin rings. That was good too.

Absolutely delicious. I loved this. I just made it and tasted it and couldn't wait to say how good it is. Haven't gotten my husbands vote yet but I don't care because I think it's quite sensational.

Very yummy. I was pleasantly surprised that so little meat went so far. I only had 0.9lb og beef and just over 1lb of bok choy. I served this with lemon cilantro rice... 2 nights running and my husband and I loved it. Reheated well too. The beef is very tender. A keeper.
