This was lovely! I had home made meat sauce in the freezer, that was key, made it extra hearty for my husband. I ended up using 28 shells because I used an entire cup of cheese, had received some fresh goat's milk ricotta and couldn't help myself! Also used crimini and oyster mushrooms. Everything else I followed to a T and it was fab.

I made ravioli with the filler for a dinner party. Homemade ravioli. Worth the effort and my crushed thumbnail!! The pasta was as smooth as silk. I also used oyster mushrooms along with buttons. Simple and yummy. Can't go wrong!

Fantastic recipe! I made my own marinara sauce which I think made it even better. Fancy enough for guests.

This is a terrific recipe. Definitely chop the shallots, prosciutto and mushrooms in a food processor if you can, as you want the texture to be fine, not chunky. I used 2 Tb of butter, which was fine. I also added less basil and put in some thyme, which is so good with mushrooms. And I made my own tomato sauce--can't imagine using the jarred stuff. Mario Batali's Basic Tomato Sauce on this site is great--and you can always add other flavors to change it up, and a big batch freezes well.

This is a great recipe. Very tasty and a great hit for company.

Maybe homemade marinara would help this recipe. My husband thought it was "bitter." I thought is was "blah."

This is a good weeknight meal...

Exceptionally good! I did double the amount of cheese and still only filled 10 shells. Next time I will chop the proscuitto as small I can get it. Used Trader Joe's low-fat marinara sauce (Ran out of time to make my own).

I never knew shells and ricotta were this easy to make! This dish is great for weeknights and for entertaining as it can be made ahead and looks impressive. I could not find pancetta, but used an organic nitrate free bacon. Worked great and tasted fantastic.

A family favorite. Does take a bit of time to pull together.

Family enjoyed them,children preferred the Feta and herb stuffed shell recipe. They're both better the next day. Needs a good sauce.

For an easy-to-prepare dinner, this is pretty darn tasty. The only thing I changed was switching out the proscuitto for some fake bacon. A good, homey dish.

This dish was really good, had it for a big family dinner and everyone loved it. I added a few cloves of minced garlic in with the shallots and made homemade marinara. Will make again.

My husband and I enjoyed these very much. I used a combination of button & shitake mushrooms and added some chopped walnuts to the marinara sauce.

This recipe was fantastic! I served it as a main dish at a dinner party along with a big salad and good garlic bread and it was so well received. I added about one cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and two cloves of minced garlic to the mixture and used my own homemade marinara sauce. Be sure that all of the ingredients are finely chopped. Next time I may add a little more prosciutto. I will definitely keep this in my "dinner party rotation!"

I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderfully! Served for 5 as a side dish to Chicken Parmesan.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he is still raving about it.

This was very good, and very easy. Definitely use a food processor for shallots, mushrooms, prosciutto, and whatever else. I agree it needs a good marinara sauce - does anybody have a good recipe for that?? I can't find one that I like.

We loved the flavor of the stuffing. However, we think that this recipes calls for a very good marinara sauce and not just a canned sauce found on the shelf of a regular grocery store. We have not yet found one we like. So, next time I will invest the time and effort in making my own sauce. Other than that, this is a great dish.

Great recipe! The filling is quick and easy to make, but the flavor is so much richer than that of traditional cheese stuffed shells. Appealed to both the kids and adults that I served.

I made these for a ladies potluck and received rave reviews. I made them the night before and refrigerated them. I found they were a little cool inside even after heating them for 40 minutes.

Delicious! The flavors in this dish were really different and we enjoyed it thoroughly. I stuffed my shells pretty full so there was only enough stuffing for 10 shells, but that was fine. Next time I might make a bit more filling. I used the diced prosciutto that's available at Trader Joe's which made it so easy too. Definitely use the best marinara sauce you can find, it makes a big difference.

Nice dish,,The grocery store now carries chopped proscuitto which was great, I doubled the recipe and added chopped grilled chicken breast(2). I used a mushroom sauce instead of a red sauce.. and thought pine nuts would be fun to use next time. It was well received.

My friend made this recipe for a dinner party & everyone loved it, so she recommended it for my next dinner party. She was right, everyone LOVED it. I've made it several times since then for company and continue to get the same results. Two who even hate mushrooms have even given it very high ratings. It's very rich, so I serve it as a side - For more casual entertaining, it goes great w/ Italian Beef Sandwiches. I highly recommend this recipe - hint - I chop the scallions, prosciutto & mushrooms in the food processor - turns out great & saves a lot of time.

This recipe was delicious! I followed it pretty much word for word but also added green peas to the mushroom mixture and it was awesome. Definitely try it!

Great recipe, everyone loved it! I also used some garlic and added mozzarella. Simply wonderful and I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful! I made a few adjustmets and additions, but the base of this recipe rocks. I added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 cup ricotta mixed with some mozzerella. Delicioso!

I made this substituting some chopped zucchini for the mushrooms (I don't care for them) and we thought it was delicious. My husband thought it was very tasty. Also used lite ricotta and light margarine to lower the fat.

This was an easy and filling dish that refrigerated well for later use. I would make it again but maybe with a different sauce either store bought or homemade (which would significantly decrease the ease of making the dish.). With the sauce I made it with it was slightly above aveage.

I thought this was really good and easy! I too added garlic, a little extra ricotta (low-fat) and some cheddar. Next time I'll try adding some mozerella instead of cheddar. I used a fresh (Contadina) marina sauce and it seemed to work fine. Great winter dish.

i enjoyed this as well as many others in your collection but.... this as many of your others call for sauce in a jar convient yes taste well... using that SHORT_CUT theory i could put alpo dog food on crackers call it a short cut pate and i think jar sause lovers will not no that difference either

Delicious! I added 2 cloves minced garlic to the saute process, and 3/4 cup shreded mozzarella to the filling. Got three marriage proposals out of this recipe...

The filling in this recipe is really good! This was not very difficult, especially if using pre-made tomato sauce (quality of the sauce matters). I used low fat ricotta with no noticeable difference.
