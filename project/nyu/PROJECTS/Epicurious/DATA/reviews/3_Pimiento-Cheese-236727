There's something amusing about serving pimiento cheese to Yankees--for some reason people born north of the Mason-Dixon line seem to find the stuff discomfiting--while most Southerners view it as comfort food. As with anything, the quality of the pimiento cheese you get from this recipe comes down to the quality of the ingredients--great cheese begats great pimiento cheese.

I make a similar version of this every year for our family holiday party. I've been adding minced Peppadew peppers to it for the past 3-4 years and it's an excellent addition. Don't cut back on the pimientos - just add about 1/4 cup minced peppadews and taste! It adds just a little bit of fire to it. I always serve with celery sticks and Mini Stone Wheat Thins.
