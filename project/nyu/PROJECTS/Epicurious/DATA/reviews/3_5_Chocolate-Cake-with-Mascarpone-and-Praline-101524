The cake was fine, though not exciting. The mascarpone plus praline topping really made it work. But the recipe is badly written. It tells you to preheat the oven and prepare the cake pan first, which seems reasonable enough, except the next thing you do is bring the butter, chocolate, etc. to a boil which then needs to cool down completely before proceeding. You really don't need to have your oven preheating for an hour while the chocolate mixture cools down, and there's plenty of time to prepare the pan while you wait. Pay attention, recipe writers!

I rarealy leave a comment although I use epicurious almost daily, but I had to say how wonderful that cake was. It was moist, the flavous was intense, the mascarpone and praline made for a beautiful presentation. I made it last night for Christmas and it was a winner, everybody was raving about it, in a family that doesn't like desserts... I will DEFINITELY make it again.

I think it's a terrible shame that this cake has gotten only 3 forks because people who don't know what they're doing review it with 1 fork. I make this regularly and it's awesome. I'm making it again for Christmas, adding 1 t peppermint extract and topping the mascarpone with peppermint bark. The original recipe is a family favorite because of it's intense chocolate flavor and moist texture.

This cake is moist but doesn't have enough chocolate flavor to it. I was so disappointed that I didn't bother doing the topping anymore.

The cake recipe is amazing! It is delicious on its own. Stays moist when refrigerated and is melt-in-your mouth good at room temperature.

This is my all time favorite chocolate cake recipe. It's like eating a cloud, dolloped with the smoothest frosting, and sprinkled with a delicious hazelnut crunch to top it all off. The mascarpone is a must!!!

I always bake a chocolate cake for a friend when he returns. He loved it as did my family - It is a keeper!

This cake was delicious!! My cake came a little fudgy and dense. I did not have the mascarpone so I used homemade chocolate icing and strawberry jelly as layers between the cake. I poked holes into the cake and poured Grand Marnier into it and then covered the whole cake with the chocolate icing. It was DELICIOUS!! I saw that many folks had issues with the praline. The trick is to keep the sugar and water mix on the stove until it turns dark orange. If you remove it too soon, the praline will not set, if you keep it too long, it will burn. If you think you are done, dip a spoon into it and raise so you get a string of the sugar mix trailing in the air. If it hardens, you are DONE. Take the mixture off the stove quick. If not, keep going. Agree with the other person who said that the praline should be added just before serving else it gets soft. I have made this cake 3 times already and will def make it again. You can make extra praline and use for later cakes

I haven't made this recipe, but to the previous reviewer who had a problem with sticky praline not setting - if you put toffee/praline in the fridge it reacts with the moisture, making it sticky. You need to cool it in a dry place (not fridge/freezer) and it will end up crispy and hard.

I must have done something wrong because my praline never hardened. It just stayed sticky, even after 10 hours in the fridge. I never stirred it, and it turned dark golden before I put the nuts in, but it's still too moist.

I made this for a family gathering and my dad said it was good enough to sell. I didn't have time to make the praline, so topped with chopped toffee bars. We LOVED it. And SO easy.

I got mixed reviews on this cake. The topping is delicious but the cake itself is not sweet enough to make it scrumptious.

easy and delicious, very chocolatey

the cake was awesome, frosting was beautiful, praline was tasty...the key to this one is to put the praline on top when serving...or it will lose its crunch! i, my co workers, and my patrons love it!!

I though the cake was great, but others did not. A friend watched me make it and thought the rewards to do so were not commensurate with the efforts. My husband did not like the parline, although he liked the mascarpone and the cake itself. I doubt I will make the cake again, although it was moist with a delicious buttermilk texture.

My wife and I made it and brought it to my in-laws for Easter. I thought it was just ok, but it got good reviews from everyone else. The pralines with mascapone was the hot topic of conversation.
