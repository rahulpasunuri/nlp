Great, easy, tasty ice cream recipe. To lighten it up a bit I used 1/2 cup sugar, reduced fat cream cheese and 1 1/2 cups skim milk (for milk and cream). Strawberries are in season and are perfectly sweet here. Even with all the changes the ice cream comes out creamy and very, very simple!

I would give this 4 stars, but only the way I made it. With the strawberries and the amount of juice they hold, the texture does become icy and the strawberry simply mixes in. Make the recipe without strawberry, but add crushed oreos at the end of mixing with the machine. Very rich and tasty this way!

Excellent results and the easiest ice cream to prepare. The lemon juice, strawberries, cream cheese, salt - everything - tasted wonderful together. I will make this recipe again and again.

I love home made ice cream; there isn't any flavor or method I wouldn't try. This recipe is definitely a favorite now. It was the easiest to mix up, the texture was rich and the flavor.... right on target. I was surprised to see no eggs in an ice cream mix but you don't notice the absense. I was hesitant to add the lemon juice at first considering milk and lemon so I just eyeballed it after it was all mixed in. The lemon adds that tartness that I like about cheesecake. I used frozen mixed berries instead of fresh strawberries and pureed everything together. It made the mix freeze faster in my maker. I put some in fancy little molds and at serving time, inverted the molds, drizzled some of the thawed berries around, added a dollop of whipped cream and enjoyed a very easy decadent dessert. I can gauge my husband's taste buds by his enthusiasm while I'm cooking. He offered to clean up for me armed with a spoon! He was just shy of licking everything! Do-over, may even try other flavors.

I thought this ice cream recipe was easy and absolutely delicious! I also used crumbled digestive biscuits, and I omited the salt. The ice cream came out superb. My husband who is not a big sweets person loved it, and our friends raved. I will definitely make this again and again.

This ice cream is delicious! I would never request strawberry ice cream at an ice cream parlour but this is different. The strawberry flavour is very intense!

Really easy to make, though this was my first time doing ice cream. I liked the texture and color a lot. I did add 2 digestive biscuits and leave out the the lemon juice and the flavour was very cheescakey, not tart at all. Maybe the sweetness of (or lack of) strawberries affects the taste?

I'd make this recipe again, even if it's not totally perfect, if only because it doesn't require cooking a custard. We used a pound of ripe berries and low-fat cream cheese. We accidentally left out the lemon juice which I think might have brightened the flavor a little, despite other complaints of tartness. Beautiful color.

I omit the lemon juice (too sharp) and churn the mix in my icecream maker for a smoother texture. I usually add one or two roughly broken up digestive biscuits (graham crackers) to the churned mix before freezing which gives some of the flavour and texture of the classic cheescake base.

I've done w/strawberries & lemon and without. If doing without-classic cream cheese ice cream...I added Hershey's chocolate syrup and chocolate covered pretzles-delicious!

Awesome and Easy!

Not so crazy about this one. Texture was more icy and grainy than creamy. Way too tarte. Probably because I didn't add enough sugar. I used fresh strawberries and added an extra 1/4 cup. Should have added another cup!

We really like this ice cream....I took it to a neighbors barbaque and everyone raved about it....I used low fat cream cheese and low fat milk and it was still great.
