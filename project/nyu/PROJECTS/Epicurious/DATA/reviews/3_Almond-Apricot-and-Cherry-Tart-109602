The final result was pretty good but the recipe needed some assembly-tweaking. To make the crust you were supposed to grind the toasted whole almonds with the flour but I had trouble getting a fine grind with that much flour. I finally scooped out most of the flour and ground the almonds with just a little. Then, in making the filling, you were supposed to use a mixer to create a fine blend of almond paste and sugar. This was impossible with my mixer and even using the food processor instead- I still had small chunks of almond paste- not the fine meal I was supposed to have. However, it wound up tasting and looking OK

Not sweet enough and the crust came out too cakey

The best part about this dessert is the crust and filling. The almond flavor was great. However, I thought the apricots were a little plain in this dish, not sweet enough, but I did enjoy the cherries. Next time I will try peaches or nectarines.

Very disappointing. The crust was way too doughy, there wasn't enough fruit. I've been a subscriber of Bon Appetit since the 80s and have never been disappointed in a recipe, until now. This dish should never have made it out of the test kitchen.

Very yummy, although I'm not sure that the cherries add much beyond color. Cooked bing cherries don't really have much flavor.

I used canned fruits instead of fresh and it came out very well. Just drain the fruits well

I've made this three times in the past week, and it is the first to disappear at every event. Not too sweet! I can hardly wait to start experimenting with different fruits and nuts.

Wonderful tart! I didn't use cherries as I had an abundance of apricots and it turned out great. I also used a 9-inch round tart pan and it worked out fine. I may even try a 10 or 11-inch round next time as there was plenty of excess dough. It was also very easy to make. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it!
