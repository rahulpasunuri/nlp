I got this recipe from the Fast,Easy,Fresh cookbook from Bon Appetit. In the cookbook, it specifically says not to use the pre- cooked variety of lasagna noodles. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with very hard noodles. It was a lot of ingredients to salvage out of an inedible lasagna. Next time, I'm using the precooked noodles. The flavor was good, nothing mind-blowing. It was easy to make.

This was my first attempt at a lasagna made from scratch (excluding the sauce of course). I did add a can of diced tomatoes and some basil to the jar of sauce. It was great! It probably could have used just a little more sauce overall f.y.i. I also used the Barilla no-boil noodles and they worked out perfectly!

I hope all of you who have made this lasagne realise that when you don't precook or blanch your noodles all the excess starch they contain ends up in the final dish. Yuk.

This was so easy to make and absolutely wonderful! I brought it to a dinner with friends. It's a new staple in my home! I adapted the recipe just a bit. I took some basil leaves and Parmesan cheese and processed them together and sprinked it on top of the cheese layers. It came out really good.

This is great. I don't use the water, and use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce. It is rich and saucy. You can even make this a day ahead, refrigirate it, then bake the next day.

Followed directions and ended up with a giant tray of lasagna with uncooked noodles. I will never try this technique again.

I thought this was very good, especially considering the ease of preparation. I just used all ground beef, but next time I would use both types of meat instead.

I have made it several times and my family loves it. It is so much easier than any other lasagna recipe I have tried.

Use Spicy Italian sausage or spicy sauce, it was kind of bland. Needed an extra half hour in oven to get noodles to cook. I'd make it again because it was very easy to assemble (about 30 min.)

Yummy and very easy to prepare. Needs more pasta sauce when reheated as leftovers. Would be terrific if it had fresh spinach and some veggies in it, too.

I really liked it. I mixed one jar of tomato sauce with a can of crushed tomatoes, garlic and oil, etc. I used more meat too. My husband loved it, and I will make it again soon.

I made this for my parents and my dad is still raving about it a year later. I love that you don't have to cook the noodles and they come out al dente. I've tried it with less basil and less sausage, to make it slightly less rich, both successfully. Definitely a keeper.

Fabulous! I'm not one to get creative with recipes, but I did so after reading the comments from other cooks. I used almost 2 28 oz. cans of roasted crushed tomatoes, about 1/2 pound of lasagna noodles, sauteed onions and garlic and twice the cheeses and meat, all of it spicy sausage. I would've kept going with more layers, but I ran out of room in my pan! It turned out beautifully, and I definitely plan to make this again. Thanks for all the great advice!

Usually I am too lazy to make lasagna, but this one was fast and my family loved it. We'll definitely have this again. I used all italian sausage. Use a deep pan!

Excellent dish and very easy to make. I used 1 1/2 lbs of italian sausage instead of mixing with beef. Fresh basil is a wonderful touch. Boyfriend was very impressed. Can't wait to make it again.

My family and friends love this dish. I usually just use the Italian sausage. I also add crushed fennel seeds, fresh garlic and a little sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. This can be prep time is under 20 minutes. It's a satisfying no hassle meal.

I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR A COUPLE OF DINNER PARTIES, BUT I DOUBLED MEAT AND CHEESE, ADDED FRESH GARLIC. NOW, PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ME TO MAKE IT. BEST LASAGNA RECIPE EVER. (OR, MY "TWEAKED ONE", I THINK). THANKS!

This dish has turned out wonderfully every time I've made it. I just use 1.25 lbs of Italian sausage instead of a sausage-beef combo, though. For the noodles, I use the oven-ready ones and put the whole thing in the fridge for a couple of hours before it goes in the oven.

I have made this recipe but always make my lasagna with the technique and it comes out perfectly. I use the regular noodles (not the no-boil kind). You have to have the tin foil on tight and I remove for the last 10 minutes. I don't use water but mix a top quality jar of sauce with a can of chopped tomatoes with basil. That usually cuts the "jarred sauce" taste without diluting flavor. I add first cook up some onions and garlic for the sauce before adding the sauteed sausage. Important to taste sauce for sweetness/acidity depending on your preference. You can then add either sugar or balsamic vinegar to adjust. I prefer less sweetness.

My ten year old son read a Garfield comic book and asked, "What is Lasagna?" I found this recipe for him to make. I rate this four forks because it was a hit with him and my husband, it was very easy, and we had a great time doing it.

This is an absolute staple -- super easy, super tasty lasagna. I've made this over and over again and given it to friends of newborns. It's a hit! Try baking and freezing it. After it's cooled down I divide it into thirds and freeze it; it's easy to reheat either in the microwave or in a conventional oven. Next time I'm going to try vary the core recipe and make a vegetarian version with mushrooms and spinach.

This was a great dish and I would make it again with only a few changes. Next time I will add less meat and combine the ground beef/sausage with the sauce to give it more flavor.

Rating: 4
The only thing I would do differently would be to save some sauce for pouring over portions prior to serving. The dish was a success that came with many praises and compliments; however, I personally found it a bit dry. DO NOT PRE-COOK NOODLES! When I took the dish our of the oven the pasta was a perfect "Eldente". I will definately make this again.

FIRST TIME I COOKED IT FOR MY FAMILY AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. EASY AND DELIGHTFUL. SECOND TIME I ADDED A BELL PEPPER TO THE SPAGETTI SAUCE. ALSO, SUBSTITUTED FETA FOR RICCOTTA CHEESE AND ADDED A LITTLE SOUR CREAM TO THE MIXTURE WHICH MADE IT A BIT TICKER AND MUCH MUCH MORE DELICIOUS. DELICIOUS!!!!

This is the first recipe I've given four forks. Terrific stuff. Pretty easy to prepare. The Italian sausage is key! I also used no-cook noodles and it worked out just fine. Really good re-heated, too, so it's great for leftovers.

I am 50 years young and my mother used to make lasagna all the time for her family of 5. I love to cook and this was the very first time i attemped to cook this recipe. I called my sister first to see if she had ever tried to duplacate my moms recipe,she said yes,but it was not the same and i told her i had found one on the web and i was gonna try it. I gotta tell you,this might even be better than my moms.I e-mailed your web address to my sister and told her to check it out. Even my wife said it was awsume.even though i made a big mess in the kitchen. Again a big Thank You for a great recipe.

This recipe is great! I used Barilla no cook lasagna noodles and it worked just fine. I think it would also be good, and even easier, with just the cheese. But don't make the mistake I made and forget to put a cookie sheet under the baking dish. I forgot and now I'll have to clean the stove.

This was a disaster for me. The noodles never cooked and eventually the ones on top lifted off the casserole and curled up, hard as if they were right out of the box. We spent the mealtime trying to scrape the sauce, meat, etc. off the lasagna to eat at least part of the meal. What a disappointment.

Rating: 3
This recipe is so easy and delicious! It's definitely a keeper! I also found it a little dry, so the next time added 1/2 cup more water. I also cut some fat calories by using fat free ricotta cheese and part-skim mozzarella cheese. Easily serves 12.

i loved this recipe. really easy to make and delicious. i used the lasagna noodles that don't need to be cooked in advanced. my one critique is that the top layer of pasta was a little tough. anybody have any suggestions? i seemed to have plenty of sauce on top but it was still a bit dried out.

This is a fast and easy way to make lasagna. It was so nice not to have to cook the noodles. I used turkey sausage to cut the fat and it tasted great. I will definately make again.

Made this a dozen or so times. It always turns out great! Not a big fan of basil, so I omit it. After reading other less than great reviews, I suggest: Making it ahead and chilling gives noodles a chance to absorb water. Saltiness depends on your jarred sauce. (that new pasta bake sauce is horribly salty!) Cover with foil when baking, making sure top layer is covered completly with sauce. When this works well for you, you will wonder why you ever fumbled with those icky, sticky boiled noodles !!!!! (really!)

Rating: 2
I followed other people's suggestions and reduced the water and used oven-ready noodles, but it was still too soggy and wet. The noodles I used turned out rather thin and limp. Does anyone have suggestions of which pasta brand to use? Other than the noodles, the lasagna was pretty good. I added a few cloves of garlic, chopped tomatoes, and spinach. I will make this again because of the ease of preparation, but with some experimentation with different noodles. I also will not add any water next time.

Rating: 3
A helpful hint for this recipe is to assemble the lasagna, but allow it to sit for 1/2 hour before you bake it. The noodles have a chance to absorb the extra liquid and are much more tender.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to cook the pasta first. Good move. The rest of it worked very well, indeed. I also only used sausage, but it was not missed. Great recipie and fun to make.

This dish was problematic. My noodles were dry and chewy, the sauce was too runny, and it was very salty. I am sure these things could be fixed with some experimentation, as other reviewers have noted, but frankly the dish was not special enough to try again.

This was great. I used the oven ready noodles and all turkey sausage. Next time I would add a layer of fresh spinach too. It really was easy and the leftovers froze well too.

I have made this several times. The first time I found what everyone else did, that the noodles came out dry and there was not enough flavor. I came back to it because it was DEAD EASY compared to some of the other lasagna recipes on this site!!! More sauce overall, but less water, some additional seasoning, and whatever I have on hand that I feel like dumping in it, mushrooms, olives, sun dried tomatoe, are all good. The fresh basil makes a big difference.

I found that the lasagna noodles on top came out a bit dry, and as a whole, all the noodles had a doughy, uncooked texture. I'd recommend using the non-boil or oven-ready noodles, which I didn't do.

Simply Superb! My teenage daughter wanted to try her hand at lasagna for the first time and I must say, this was a delicious confidence booster. We incorporated everyone's suggestions, less water, more sauce, chooped tomatoes, plenty of basil, garlic and onions, sauce under the last layer of noodles and on top and the dish was magnificent. Even my one-year old cleaned her plate.

I loved this dish! First I traded spicy italian sausage instead of beef and sauteed lots of mushrooms with onions and plenty of garlic. I added an extra can of chopped tomatoes and a couple of handfuls of sun-dried tomatoes. I also put extra ricotta and some provolone cheese. It was so good:-)

I love this recipe! I had no problems with it at all, and it was the first lasagna i ever made. My family finished it the same night i made it. :-) The changes i made was that i used a 28oz jar of sauce, and more cheese, and peperoi instead of ground meat. Yum!

I took the comments posted into consideration before I made this dish, and it turned out pretty well. I used two large (28-oz?) cans of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and water (first sauteed with garlic and onion). Also (key to well cooked top) make sure you always have a layer of **sauce under the noodles** -- the recipe leaves out a layer under the top noodles and instead puts the rest all on top. The noodles cooked well, but I only used about half the package (no overlapping noodles). Also, I left out the beef but it was still plenty tasty with the chicken sausage I tried.

Rating: 3
It's delicious if you use additional liquids like 3 small cans of tomato sauce & reduce the water to 1 cup. I also added a regular size can of diced tomatoes for texture and taste, and a bag of italian seasoned cheese spinkled on the top. Very easy recipe!

Too much for my oversize 13+ x 9+ x2+ lasagne dish and not enough flavor to make it again. Good decent food, but uninteresting.

Using this recipie for my first attempt at lasagne was easy, and the results were fab! I agree with other cooks that more sauce is needed, so I added a can of crushed tomatoes, which added enough moisture to cook the noodles without making the top layer dry. I am excited to continue experimenting with other recipies on this site!

There were a few problems with this recipe. First, the noodles has a strange, doughy texture. Also, the lasagna was too watery. Next time I will use oven-ready noodles and marinara sauce only - no water added. I agree with others who said the top too dry. Plan on using more marinara sauce than called for in the recipe.

Wonderful easy lasagna; my roomie and I make it all the time. I'm lactose intolerant though, so we only use the mozzarella cheese to reduce the amount of dairy products, and also the amount of fat. We use reduced fat cheese and turkey sausage and it's still really good. The fresh basil is important though.
