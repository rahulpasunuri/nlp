Love this. So easy and simple. I make it all summer long, but now is the perfect time for late summer tomatoes. I don't change a thing. Terrific choice for the beach/picnic main meal or side.

Yum! Really, really good, especially with the fresh homemade ricotta. I added a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (yes, just a teaspoon!) and didn't put the whole pound of pasta into the sauce, so the dish was a little saucier; other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe. The homemade ricotta was easy and delicious. It's also salt-free, so if you're making it, you may not want to reduce the amount of salt in the salsa cruda.

Just ok. I agree with the others that this was a little bland and really like the idea of adding some balsamic.

This recipe was delicious despite the fact that I realized I had run out of olive oil. I didn't use any olive oil and I threw in way more pepper than it called for because I'm a spice addict. I will definitely make this recipe again. It was light and filling.

Delicious and easy to make. I halved the salt and added capers as some others suggested. The ricotta is what really makes this though, so I suggest going to the extra effort for the fresh ricotta if you really want to make something amazing.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The tomatoes really made the dish, and the ricotta cheese did too. Many thanks to to Ucratbo from Boston for the link to the NY Times "fresh ricotta" recipe. I halved that recipe and used it for this dish.

Delicious in early September but WAY TOO SALTY. Half the salt

This was a great and easy dish! I mostly kept to the original recipe (different shaped pasta - I don't think rotelli really makes a huge difference) and it turned out fantastic. And it used up the last of the huge bag of tomatoes my father gave me from his yard.

This was a great late summer meal that took exceptional advantage of tomato season. I wouldn't bother making it at any other time of the year in Minnesota as it's the just picked tomatoes and basil that make this such a winner. I used chevre instead of ricotta, and added a dash of balsamic to the salsa.

thanks ucratbo from Boston for the fresh ricotta recipe tip. I made it and it is unbelievable and easy! Made the salad a homerun.

I agree with a previous post -- this was a bit bland. However, I definitely see the potential in it. Maybe some diced sun-dried tomatoes or capers would give it the extra kick it needs. I will try it again with some addition like that. Also, I let my pasta cool for quite a while before tossing with the sauce, but when I added my ricotta it melted. This was not a bad thing at all -- just pointing out how my experience differed from the photo.

This is lovely dish with fresh, subtle flavors. I was very faithful to the recipe. I couldn't find orecchiette, so I used campanelle. I stirred some of the ricotta in with the pasta and sauce, before putting the dollops on top. And I sprinkled the plate with a little parsley. This is a great summer meal! I had no clue what "fresh" ricotta was. Turns out it is very simple to make and delicious. See recipe on nytimes dot com. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/dining/281rrex.html

OMG - this was sooooooo good. I made the orecchiette and the firmness of the pasta with the juicy tomatoes, and shallots and the creaminess of the ricotta made a dish that was heaven. Wished I'd made more! In fact husband was *really* wishing I'd made more. Can't wait till our tomatoes are ripe and we can use them.

I don't know if the shallots at my local grocery store are just too acidic, but the one shallot completely overpowered this dish, making it bitter, acidic, and altogether unpleasant. If I were to make it again, I would only use a quarter or so of shallot.

We didn't put the ricotta on it and we loved it

Thought this recipe was a little bland. Had to add crushed red pepper and some balsamic, then it was OK. Not a keeper.

Just fantastic! Never having experienced fresh ricotta before, I can see how other reviewers might not have had the same experience. What a difference! Anytime I can get it AND good tomatoes I will be making this for my husband and I, for friends, family, dinner parties...

This was a great base recipe... We used feta instead of ricotta, just because we couldn't find any fresh ricotta (and that makes ALL the difference). Add extra basil, and you won't be disappointed.

This dish is easy to prepare and it didn't heat up the kitchen. From reading the reviews I decided to use ricotta salata. It is a firm and salty Italian cheese. It's texture is like feta but not as strong (tangy) tasting. I think it worked well for this dish. Just before serving I also drizzled it with a balsamic reduction. (reduce 1cup of balsamic vinegar to 1/2c on the stove in a small saucepan over low heat.

I thought this recipe was so bland as did my boyfriend. He normally raves about my food but not this time. Just a little too boring. I would take suggestions from the other reviewers and add a stronger cheese and perhaps some toasted pine nuts.

Simply delicious. I have used ricotta, smoked mozzarella and parmesan, and each iteration was terrific. I plan to add toasted pine nuts to the next batch - glad that worked out for someone else.

So quick and so delicious! I love fresh tomatoes with ricotta - the simplicity is what makes the dish. I doubled the garlic, added toasted pine nuts and topped each plate with fresh parmesan. Perfect weeknight meal!

Loved this. I used feta instead of ricotta, and a thin slice of sweet red onion instead of shallots. I wouldn't change a thing about the sauce. This was a perfect marriage of flavors. The only problem was the pasta, which needed more oil in the water than I allowed. It stuck together badly and probably needs gentle stirring as it cooks, as well. I might try shells or rotini next time.

This was EXCELLENT!!! I made less than 1/3 of the original recipe to make 2 "salad" servings. (Did not want it to be a whole meal for 2.) Subbed rotini pasta for the required kind because I wanted to use it up. Since we do not like ricotta cheese, I mashed up 1/4 cup of 2% cottage cheese with a bit of feta. It didn't look like the picture, but my multi-colored rotini was very pretty too!!! DELICIOUS!!!

I do something very similar to that recipe, except that I skip the shallots. I am from Bulgaria, so I use our local white cheese (feta comes close, although ours is a bit denser and tougher) and it works great! Only difference is I run the whole thing, including the cheese, through a hand blender, and it takes away a bit of the sourness of the tomatoes.

Rating: 3
I agree with those who say that this could use a different cheese. The ricotta is just sooo bland. I even blended the ricotta into the tomato mixture an hour ahead of time and let it sit at room temperature. I was hoping the cheese would pick up the flavor of the other ingredients. Still it was too bland. The blue cheese sounds good. Or perhaps a tangy Bulgarian feta?

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any shallots on hand so I left them out of the recipe and had to use minced garlic since I didn't have any cloves (recovering college student). Mixed together it tasted great but felt like it was missing someting so I added a splash of balsamic vinegar. It was excellent!! Definitely will make again.

Elegant and delicious! Makes the most of fresh tomatoes from the garden!

I prefer to enjoy the natural flavors in combination rather than adding salt. I used a meager 1/4 tsp instead of the 3/4 recommended. Also, if you can't find orecchiette, just use medium shells.

Very nice pasta salad, summer on the deck with a nice wine.

This was very nice, despite using non-fresh lowfat ricotta and decent but not great tomatoes. It's very easy and feels summery and light yet satisfying. However, I would not make this for company unless I had excellent ricotta and tomatoes.

Really a simple, great dish. I used blue cheese and it seemed to mix well with the shallots. The GF loved it as well.

Thought it was ok, nothing spectacular. I thought it was missing a little something extra. Would try again but with maybe blue cheese as someone else suggested.

Delicious. Halved the recipe to serve two, it was maybe a little garlicky for our taste, this could be solved by poaching the garlic in boiling water for a minute before mincing. I think this would also be good with bleu cheese instead of ricotta, but with our wonderful fresh ricotta this was a perfect summer dish!

Delicious! Made as directed and thought it was the perfect summer dinner. An added bonus was that I served this at room temperature.

This dish was really good. During the summer, I'm always on the lookout for ways to use tomatoes and basil from the garden and I appreciate the fact that the tomatoes are not cooked in the sauce. I'll definitely use this recipe often. Very tasty.
