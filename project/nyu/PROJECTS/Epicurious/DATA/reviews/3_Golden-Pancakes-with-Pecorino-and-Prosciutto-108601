As I do with another crepe recipe, I added I tablespoon of melted, sweet butter and that helps to prevent sticking. And i definitely added about an extra quarter cup of water.

Lovely and delicious recipe. The "crepes" are perfect for a variety of fillings. Have made this several times many different ways and get raves each time. The pancakes get easier to make with each attempt. Highly recommend!

The pancakes were difficult (used Caphalon-not a non-stick). Pancakes were just so-so. (the wine recommendation was perfect!!)

I made this dish for my clients and they loved it. You could easily substitute other fillings. Fine and easy dish.
