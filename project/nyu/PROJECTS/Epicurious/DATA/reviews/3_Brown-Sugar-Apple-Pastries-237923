Made this for friends last night one of whom said she was "just too full..why did I give her so much?" She practically licked her plate clean. Yummy and easy. I had some OLD dried cherries around..I revived them in hot orange juice and threw them in too.

This is quite easy and oh so delicious! In my rush to get this on the table, I forgot to peel the apples and used granulated sugar instead of brown sugar. But oh my, was it still tasty. The sugar and butter gave the delightfully flaky puff pastry a nice sweetness, which complemented the apples nicely.

We didn't have puff pastry, but this is a fast, easy, fabulous way to cook apples - just use *all* of the sugar, butter and cinnamon called for in the apple mixture...we did add a bit of lemon juice. Serve over vanilla ice cream and top with toasted walnuts.
