Why would you leave the shells intact on the shrimp? I would peel them and use olive oil when roasting, and definitely add garlic and some herbs for more flavor. I would also use a little olive oil in the spinach.

i agree with Hawkster1 - I've made this twice now in that manner. I've also added garlic and halved grape tomatoes with the scallions and cilantro with the ginger. The great thing is that you're cooking the shrimp, etc in the same broth that the shrimp was cooked in, so there's a great cohesiveness there.

It seems to me that this recipe is a good idea in search of more flavor and easier technique. Here's how I did it: Double (at least) the chili powder and salt. In a large saucepan or skillet, saute 1/2lb shrimp, the chili powder, salt, 1t fresh lime juice, some hot sauce, and 2t peanut oil. When the shrimp turns pink, remove from pan with slotted spoon and keep warm. Add 3 scallions, cut into 1/2" lengths with most of the green, to pan. Saute 2 minutes. Add 1T fresh ginger and 2T water. Simmer 2 minutes. Add 1/2 to 1 t sesame oil, salt and pepper, and spinach. Cover. Simmer 30 seconds. Remove lid. Return shrimp to pan. Heat through. Serve.

The secret to this dish is GOOD quality really fresh chili powder-- if you have that, you can make dish as is (although I admit I added a little extra because I like the extra kick!) A little ginger on the shrimp also adds to this dish if you need to compensate for mediocre chili powder, and if f you dont have lime, lemon works nicely as well. Can make w/ rice and drizzle sauce from shrimp over it if you want more filling dish. Really really simple, great dish that leave plenty of room for creativity. enjoy.

Having read the other reviewers caveats, I added the hot sauce and increased the amount of chili powder. I also used a lemon/garlic/olive oil sauce that I keep around for tabouli instead of lime juice. This was made as a main course with a pound of medium shrimp, which I did butterfly, and fresh-from-the-farmer's-market spinach. It was delicious, and even more so cold the next day, but is it even the same recipe anymore?

This recipe a real disappointment at first--too bland, considering the interesting mix of spices. What we did, though, was pound a couple of glugs of Louisiana Hot Sauce on the shrimp, and it really came together. (We made the recipe with a pound of peeled deveined shrimp 45-60 that we didn't butterfly) Excellent results with the mid course correction!!

After reading the prior review, I decided to grill the shrimp instead with the same spices plus olive oil;and added some goat cheese to the wilted spinach. It was delicious and very easy. We will use this again.

This did nothing for me. The ingredients seemed like they had potential, but once it was all put together it was not very good.
