Very disappointing. Under-spiced and sad. I had to add curry powder and lots of extra cumin, etc., and halved the amount of potato. I like the idea of Indian latkes, but this recipe is not the one for it.

Most disappointing! After reading the other reviews, I increased the amount of spices to no avail. These were very bland and I found the texture kind of off-putting. Definitely not worth the effort.

I had to quadruple the spices, but after doing so this was very, very good, alone and with the curry-lime yogurt. The first time I made them I only had a frozen peas and carrots mixture on hand, but that worked nicely.

This was delicious. I increased all of the quantities of spices. I toasted and ground the spices first, and added black mustard seeds and 2 red chiles. This was delicious with the yogurt dipping sauce. Will definitely make again. Went very well with our Oaxacan brisket.

These potato pancakes had no flavor until I tripled the spices and seasoning. Then they were very good. I didn't have any problems cooking them--in fact they tasted best when lighter in color. Will probably make again.

These are great. Definitely use twice as much spice as called for (or half or fewer potatoes). Be patient in heating the oil and let the pancakes crisp before flipping. If it's bland, consider that maybe your spices (in most kitchens, infrequently used) are stale. The yogurt sauce is fantastic and super versatile. Will be making these again for sure!

This was actually pretty good, but only after modifications. I think it would have been VERY bland as is. I weighed out my potatos, but ended up throwing out about a third because one had gone bad and gotten on the rest. I doubled the spices, and would still call it subtly flavored. Also added 2 shallots. I can't imagine how it would taste with so few spices. Think about how much cumin you use just to season a pound of meat for tacos, are you really going to use 1/4 a teas for 3.5 lbs of potatos? So glad I added more. Also, made a manjo-jalepeno relish to serve along with the curry yogurt. Ended up really enjoying it. Try it - and make the pancakes small and flat so there are more crispy edges.

I made this dish as a side for some gemfish and it didn't disappoint. Though I didn't fry the cakes in oil and butter as the recipe suggested, they still came out crisp and delicious. The dipping sauce didn't really add that much, although it would probably be nice on a hot night.

Holy Moses - what the heck went wrong? I followed this recipe to a T, but the end result was not worth the effort. First, the amount of potato is out of whack - way too much. Second, the seasoning is far too subtle - follow the other reviewers' warnings, and cut back on the potatoes while upping the spices. Even with the flattest of pancakes, the cooking time per side was too long to make the dish worth it. The curry lime yoghurt dressing is pretty good, however. But it doesn't make up for the drab pancakes!

I was very pleased with how these pancakes came out and the whole family loved them. I would definitely make these again and maybe make them a little bit smaller and serve them as appetizers at my next party. I also added a little bit more of the lime juice to the dipping sauce.

Very tasty pancakes

these pancakes were very simple to make and delicious. i halved the recipe but kept the same amount of spices, and thought it was just about right. the trick with the potatoes is keeping the heat low enough so they cook through but don't get burnt on the outsides. for my stove, it took about 6 minutes per side. delicious and easy!

I subed sweet potato and it was wonderful. Squeeze as much water out of the potatoes as possible and do not undercook. Also, don't skip the curry lime yogurt. Also fantastic. I served it for breakfast.

This is an excellent recipe. Everybody in my family loved it. I made so many the second time, I actually had some leftovers, so I took them to work as my lunch. My co-workers smelled them heating up and went crazy! I ended up sharing my leftovers and the recipe with everyone at work. Note: I follow the recipe pretty closely, but I do add more of everything except potato, and add an extra egg which makes them lighter. This is truly a great recipe and you'll be surprised how well it turns out!

I made these to go with my mother's broccoli rabe saag paneer. They were delicious and very easy. The curry-lime yogurt went perfectly.

I made these for a Hannukah party yesterday, and they were a huge hit. The curry-lime yoghurt dip was great too, after I added a lot more curry and lime juice than the recipe called for, and a fair bit of salt and pepper.
