I've made flourless tortes before, but this one takes the cake! It is simple and elegant. The texture is absolutely divine! I garnished it with roughly chopped hazlenuts - it really added to the presentation.

This recipe is absolutely rich and elegant, especially if you use a good quality swiss bittersweet chocolate. I always make it for very special occasions and it is always a hit !

We had a dinner party in our neighborhood this weekend it was my turn to make dessert, and it was an Italian theme meal. This was as big hit, easy to prepare, and I will definitely make it again. I have to agree with a previous reviewer, you can't really go wrong with a recipe that has a pound of chocolate in it! :o) Also, with the left over egg whites, I made a layered chocolate mousse torte.

Followed directions but only cooked for 35 minutes yet it was dry. It had nice flavor and the glaze was excellent but I won't make it again.

Not only was this simple to make, it was extraordinarily delicious. A must for chocolate lovers -- it's rich, dense and there's a whole pound of chocolate in it! Will definitely impress the guests.
