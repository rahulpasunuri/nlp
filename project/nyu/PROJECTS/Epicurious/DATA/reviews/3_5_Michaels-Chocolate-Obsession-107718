The first time I made this recipe, the bottom fell out of the springform pan as I was carrying it to the oven. Wow, what an unbelievable mess. The second time I made it, I rushed it too much and incorporated the chocolate into the eggs before they'd cooled. I knew better, but took the chance anyway. I ended up with a chocolate Frisbee. It was delicious crumbled over vanilla ice cream and raspberries (what wouldn't be?). I'll try this again, hopefully the third time's a charm.

This was great b/c it was very tasty and so easy to whip up. I couldn't find the aluminum pan that met the specs in the recipe, so I used an 8" or so round aluminum pan and cooked it for about 11 min. or so. Used Callebaut semisweet chocolate. Made a raspberry sauce to drizzle on the plate and served with mini scoops of vanilla ice cream. Tasted great!

I looked up all of the recipes from last years Valentines Day Menu Planner and thought I should comment. I planned for my husband and I to prepare the entire dinner throughout the evening. It was outstanding!! Each course took such a short time to prepare and in between, candlelight and wine seemed to add just the right amount of romance. This just seemed to make this dessert the perfect ending. It was just the right amount of chocolate. I did, however just use a small springform pan lined with buttered parchment paper for easy removal and clean up.

Did anyone find that this didn't have strong chocolate taste? I did half semi-sweet and half bittersweet chocolate, and wasn't blown away. I want to like this, and it's so easy to make; I'm just not sure why it wasn't as chocolate-y as I thought it would be. Could I add more baking chocolate (like another 4 ounces) and still have it bake properly?

Very easy and very good. This is one of the few recipes I have memorized how to make without having to dig it up and read through all the instructions again and again. Must be served with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream and a slice of orange (California Navel does the trick) in my humble opinion anyway.

Yum! I made this for my boyfriend, Michael, and it was very easy to make and oh-so-decadent. The only thing I would change would be to omit the orange peel because I thought it took away from the wonderful chocolate taste. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was excellent. What a wonderful dessert!

This is great!!! I have made other flourless cakes before that have been good but this one is delicous. It could be made a day ahead too. I reheated in the microwave and it tasted just as decadent

This is soooo easy. You can make this in 5 minutes prior to sitting down to eat and then have it cook in the oven while you eat dinner. Just be careful to not overcook it...even an extra 1/2 minute will make it a bit darker than desired.

So easy and so delicious! A perfect treat for valentine's day. Next time I'll add some raspberries or vanilla icecream.
