I did not have enough potatoes (used russet instead of Yukon Gold) or parsnips, so I added a large turnip & a couple of kohlrabi to make up the difference. Also used chicken stock instead of veg stock. YUM!

this chowder is a good jumping off point. I made lots of changes based on previous reviews and will make more changes next time. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, and chicken stock instead of vegetable. I used onions instead of leeks. next time I would use more bacon and leave out the olive oil, LEAVE OUT THE DRIED THYME or use a sprig of fresh, use more garlic. my kids even ate this, but I really disliked the heavy taste of the dried thyme and I didnt even use as much as it called for.

Excellent recipe, although I altered it significantly. Used 3 pounds total mixed roots: purple top parsnip, celeriac,rutabaga, parsnip, red and yellow carrots, Yukon potato, and a small sweet potato. I'm not really one for low-fat, so I used 3 bacon slices, 2 tablespoons butter in place of the olive oil, and instead of 3 cups 2% milk/3 cups broth I used 5 cups broth and 3/4 cup whole cream. This definitely added richness and flavor to the recipe. To thicken the chowder, I blended some of the potatoes and reincorporated them back into the soup. It was flavorful and not too sweet. I'll definitely make this again.

The retrospective thought of this soup makes me shudder. It is henceforth banished from my recipe bex.

I wish that I could write a rave review like everyone else, but I was rather disappointed with this soup. I found it too be too sweet (even though I used chicken broth as other people suggested), and it was rather one-dimensional flavor-wise. The parsnips, carrots and leeks are all rather mild and sweet, an the parsnips lent the soup and almost licorice-like flavor. Perhaps the soup would have been netter if I had used onions instead of leeks.

I made this before I discovered this soup is lowfat/low cal. Guess I could have told from the ingredients, but I didn't notice and the taste didn't give it away (as it usually does.) This was really hearty, filling and just plain good. It's a great cold weather soup. The only thing I did different is I pureed about 1/2 of it, and I think that made it even better.

Well, I mistakenly bought turnips instead of parsnips at the store, and this was fantastic anyway! used chicken broth as other reviewers have suggested, and this soup wasn't sweet at all.

Delicious. I added some celery and onion too. Beware, it does make a LOT of chowder.

This was awesome. Husband and I both stuffed ourselves. I followed previous advice and mashed it up some before serving.It really gives it a nice thick consistancy. I used chicken broth, and it was still quite sweet. Between the carrots and the parsnips, there's not much to ballance the sweetness. I served with sourdough garlic bread. On thing, I'm not sure what constituteds "a main serving" here. This made WAY more than 6 main dish servings. It will probably settle out at 10-12 servings. (we're still eating it!)

What a great chowder! I agree-mash up some of the potatoes and parsnips. I used home made chicken broth, and that worked just fine. I'll definitely make this again! I froze some of the leftovers, so I'll see how that goes...

For low fat, this soup is really hearty and satisfying. It tastes like full-on chowder. However, I think the earlier post about how commercial vegetable broth can be too sweet is right on the money. I think next time I'll use chicken broth.

Made this chowder yesterday, which was a bitterly cold January day. It was just the perfect thing to warm a body up. I substitued low sodium chicken broth for the vegetable broth, as commercial vegetable broths can sometimes taste weird or too sweet. I thought it came out perfect. I also took my potato masher and mashed the vegetables up slightly when they were tender. Made the chowder a bit thicker, which is the way my husband likes it. All in all, a wonderful cold night supper. Served it with homemade biscuits. Very comforting.
