I use this recipe with either chicken or turkey carcasses. If you want to use less freezer space when storing this recipe, then after you skim off any remaining fat, take note of the volume of stock and reduce it, simmering long enough to make a thick syrup. Then you can simply pour that syrup into an ice cube tray and have condensed stock at hand. I normally end up having to reconstitute my stock by using one cup of water for each cube.

I don't know why someone would rate it three forks, not comment and sayt they'd not make it again! This is a Thanksgiving tradition. It makes fabulous sopa de lima, garlic soup, tortilla soup, and you can use the stock in anything that calls for chicken broth with delicious results. (Also, if you go half and half with canned chicken broth, it tastes like homemade chicken broth--- the turkey takes a back seat.) You have the turkey leftover anyway! I add more celery, any leftover gravy, and a couple fresh sage leaves, but that's just my preference.
