I made 1/2 this recipe and it was still a huge amount. It was worth the trouble of peeling all the fruit!

This was a delicious and easy dessert perfect for fall. The cheddar adds a subtle savory taste which is a nice balance to all the sweet. I cut the recipe in half and still have enough to feed an army.

My family loves this cobbler. We make it every year with apples and pears from our trees. I do cut the butter down some and use buttermilk in the topping. I prefer a tart apple in it so we use a gravenstien or something similar and our tree has bartlett pears but it has never turned out badly using them.

I just used the filling and it was excellent! I used a regular pie crust recipie for the top becuase I like pie crust toppings better than the biscuit style toppings.

Really very good. Made it 4 times and everybody loved it, will probably make it for Thanksgiving. Just use 1 teaspoon of baking powder instead of 1 tablespoon.

I agree with previous reviewers, the filling is amazing, but there are better crusts out there. I'll make the filling again, maybe just serve it warm by itself with some vanilla ice cream? This is very easy and inexpensive to make.

Everyone liked this a lot. Shredded the cheese using a food processor, and since the bowl was already dirty, mixed dry ingreds. in processor then cut the butter and shredded cheese in. Made it very easy and the topping was extremely tender. Didn't have apple juice but I strained the flavored cooked fruit mixture (without cream) and reduced it in a hot skillet, it concentrated the flavors. I then added the cream.

This was wonderful, lots of raves for Thanksgiving. The favor of the apples and pears together...delicious!!! However, I was not pleased with the crust..to much like a buscuit. I would change to a crispier/crunchier topping and use the filling again and again. Thank you, it was a pleasure to have something else for dessert.

Looking for something different, I made this for a Thanksgiving dessert. What a hit - beat out the pumpkin and pecan pies by miles. The cheddar (used 75% fat free) in the crust is subtle adds a nice flavor. Guests really liked the pear and apple combination. There was a bit too much filling for the pan size and it overflowed in the oven. When I make this again, I will cut down to 3 lbs each of the fruit and leave out the whipping cream.
