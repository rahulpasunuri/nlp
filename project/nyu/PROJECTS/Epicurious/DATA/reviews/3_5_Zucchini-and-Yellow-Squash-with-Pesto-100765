Very good - I had never considered eating zucchini this way. I cut thin slices, rounds instead of lengths, and not paper thin. I marinated 2 hours, and it was perfect, not too soft or wet at all. I did use my own pesto recipe, but this was a great idea!

Superb recipe, especially when served with salmon cakes and ripe tomatoes, thinly sliced with salt and pepper.

I thought this would be great and marinated the zucchini over night. All it did was weap and make the dish look very unappatizing.

I make this a few times in summer and we find this a marvelous way to use zucchini and yellow squash--the plate looks very pretty--I add small mint leaves, which enhances looks and taste.

Great simple way to serve fresh veggies.

We really like this recipe. Part of the reason that we find it so appealing is its suggested presentation - take a look at Gourment's photo on page 180 of their September,1997 issue. It's a great dish to prepare 24 hours ahead.

This looks great! It just doesn't taste very good.
