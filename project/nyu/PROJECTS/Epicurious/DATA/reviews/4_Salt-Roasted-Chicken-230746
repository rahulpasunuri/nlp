Easy and very moist. Highly recommend. This will be added to my 'frequent flier' list. I added fresh herbs and a dusting of garlic powder. Yum.

My chicken came out moist and delicious with a wonderful crispy skin. The hardest part is remembering to brine it (in that case you can always make the Thomas Keller Roast chicken from this site).

I was skeptical at first as to whether a dry brine would result in a dry chicken, but I was proven wrong and am now converted! This recipe is extremely simple. I brined my 3.5lb chicken for 48 hours, and the meat was very tender and juicy. I reserved the pan juices and mixed with flour, chicken broth and lemon juice to make chicken gravy. I roasted it in the oven for 1hr and 15 minutes, but I think I will roast it for 1hr and 30 minutes to give it more depth in colour. Fabulous recipe! I ended up adding thyme to the butter mixture prior to slathering and stuffed the inside with onions and garlic in addition to the lemon. Delish!

I was happy to find a simple dry brined chicken recipe. This was very simple and tasty. I made it exactly as directed. I used the lemon, although I don't think it's necessary or could be substituted with garlic and/or onions. My chicken was 6 lbs, though, and took 30 minutes longer to cook. As with all high-heat roast chicken recipes, a lot of grease splattered in the oven.

This is the roast chicken preparation I've been looking for all my life. I use a free-range chicken and sea salt and let it sit overnight. Amazing flavor.

Simple to make - just hands on. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours and it came out quite tender and juicy.

This is an excellent prep.method for a perfectly wonderful roasted chicken! Nice and moist and a crispy skin. Any herbs you prefer could be used with the butter and garlic ,I used rosemary [and pepper]and the "Beer Butt"method of cooking{in the oven}at same temps. as called for in recipe,It was GREAT! My Husband Loved It and So Did I!!! I Agree with the reviewer who said the toughest part is remembering to "BRINE" the Chicken!

Another simple supper for the collection: I even forgot the butter rub, the meat was still succulent. I cut a whole lemon in big chunks for the cavity, the breast meat especially was subtly lemon-infused. Enjoy ...

The salt treatment of the chicken prior to roasting -- what I think of as a "dry brine" -- results in a juicy, succulent, tasty chicken without any water log. Very easy to make -- the most difficult thing would be to remember to "dry brine" the chicken a day or so before roasting. (I dry-brined my chicken 48 hours.)
