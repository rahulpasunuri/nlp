Light and flavorful. Loved the fennel oil. I also cut the salt in half and was pleased. Used arugula, romaine and radicchio.

Very light and flavorful. Used arugula, romaine and radicchio which worked just fine. I also cut the salt in half and was pleased.

I confess: I didn't follow the recipe to the letter. Actually, I was simply looking for a dressing for arugula (my favorite salad green), and this seemed to fit the bill. I found the dressing recipe a bit salty, so tossed the first batch and tried it again with about 1/4 teaspoon of salt. It turned out perfect. For greens I used about 4 cups arugula, 3 cups mixed wild greens, 4 green onions (white parts only), and 3/4 of a red pear. Everyone loved it.
