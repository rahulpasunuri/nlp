Made this as part of a larger experimental dinner. The guest of honor does not like trout, so I substituted Orange Roughy. I did not make the slaw. Upon completion, I was the least confident of this dish, but my guests loved it. In fact, two people who don't eat fish, tried it, and loved it.

We love the delicate flavor of trout and have several recipes, some from this site, that enhance its subtle flavor. This one totally overwhelmed the trout.

This is one of the best recipes I have made in a long time. It was so simple to make and the ingredience were not had to find. Instead of whole trout I used trout fillets and they worked very nicely. I did not find the chili power to be overpowering infact I would add a litte bit more next time along with a little salt. The cabbage-cilantro salad complimented the trout beautifuly. The trout looked very impressive, I would make this for company.

I love all the ingredients in this fish recipe, separately, but together they didn't impress. Way too much chili powder flavor or, perhaps, the quality of the chili powder I used was not good enough. We couldn't taste the good trout. I can't comment on the cabbage salad, as I didn't have those ingredients on hand.

I thought this dish was excellent overall. I followed the recipe exactly, but I substitued Tilapia for the trout. I must add, I preferred the salad on the side (or encircling the fish), in small quantity, as an accent. With the salad on top, the temptation is to combine the two tastes in one bite, and I felt that so eaten, the cabbage detracted somewhat from the fish.

This was very easy to prepare and the taste was magnificant!! A real winner.

This was super, easy to make and very fast. I happen to love cilantro but not everyone does. I think you could use parsley and it would also taste great.
