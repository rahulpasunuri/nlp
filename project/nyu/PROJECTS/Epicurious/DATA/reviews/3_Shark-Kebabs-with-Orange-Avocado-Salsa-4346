First time preparing and eating shark. Prepared as steaks as I did not have tome to make them as Kebabs. Very moist and delicious!

This was a hit with my husband. Like others, I added cumin, lime juice and a little olive oil to the salsa. I thought it needed to be sweeter, so also added a little sugar. I cooked the shark in a grill pan on the stove - only took 5 or 6 minutes. As others, served over flavored sticky rice. Next time, I will lightly salt the shark and let stand for a few minutes before cubing; will double the marinade saving half and pouring it over the cooked fish and rice before topping with the salsa; will add the avocado to the salsa right before serving vs letting it stand with the other ingredients.

I made this and served it on the skewers over top sticky rice I had flavored with a little mirin and rice wine vinegar. OMG!! So unbelievably good. Shark was extremely tender and lovely... granted, I think you could put anything with the salsa and have it taste amazing, but regardless, I will definitely keep my eye out for shark at the local market to make this again!

Prepared steaks rather than kebobs. Though it was very tender and tasty, next time I'll prepare as a kebob so it can absorb more of the marinade. For the salsa, I used what I had on hand - cuke, scallions, jalapeno and cilantro - plus a simple dressing. Yum!

I made this with chicken for Mothers' Day and it was a hit! Left the oil out of the marinade and added cumin to the salsa, also followed others' suggestions of adding lime juice and 1/2-ing the onion and would do all that again.

I love the salsa in this dish. I think next time I will cut the onion in half. The red onion is really strong.

this turned out excellent.. however, i used tuna steaks in place of the shark and didnt make kebobs. i marinated the tuna in a ziploc bag for maximum coverage and then grilled them.. might i say i was impressed. for a little touch i added some lime juice to the salsa, but thats just me. overall a very refreshing dish and i will definatly make it again.

This was my maiden voyage, so to speak! Never having cooked shark before, I was very surprised to find it in the case at my fish market. I decided to give it a whirl even though my husband is NOT a fish lover.This is a great recipe, very quick and easy to prepare. The Shark was wonderfully flavourful and tender.I loved the Salsa and added Mango just becuse I happened to have some on hand.

This salsa is great with both grilled chicken and fish. I copied this November 1997 recipe and intitally commented on December 1996's entry - they are one and the same recipe. I'm not always exact with measurements because the intensity of the ingredients often changes - adjust ingredient quantities in the salsa to suit your taste buds.

I sauteed the shark in the marinade adding extra olive oil, I also doubled everything in the salsa except for the onion, avocado and garlic. Although I did add extra of each. My roommate took what was left over to her father and he loved it. This is a great recipe.

Salsa was uninspiring, shark came out chewy. I have had much better shark kebabs before from store-marinated shark meat. Disappointed.

This was OK - I served the salsa over grilled sea bass. The salsa combo was not right - too much onion, garlic, etc. not enough orange and avocado. There are much better fish recipes out there.

An easy, satisfying way to cook shark.

The shark turned out tender, with a wonderful texture.
