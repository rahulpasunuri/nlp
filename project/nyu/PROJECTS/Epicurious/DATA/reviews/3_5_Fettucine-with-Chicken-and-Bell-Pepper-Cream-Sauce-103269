This is one of my old reliable favorites. It's simple to make and comes out great every time. If you are serving to anyone a little sensitive to heat you may want to start with less crushed red pepper but to me it's perfect! I've also used cayenne if out of crushed red pepper.

Just tried this recipe. Sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked even though I used half of the broth after reading other people's comments. I will make this again and work on the sauce. Also, I found that quantity of red pepper flakes to be TOO spicy for me. So, I'll use about half next go around. Overall, delicious!

Very good for a quick dinner. After reading the comments about runny sauce, I used less chicken broth. It was delicious.

Rather bland. Nothing that I would be proud of serving. The sauce was watery and nothing else outstanding to say about it. Looks like our golden retriever will be having a special treat as my husband only eats left overs if the dish is spectacular.

Sorry to say I thought this was just ok. I agree that it is on the bland side. In fact way over on the bland side. It's crossed the line! As followed it is just too boring. I ended up adding lots of butter and lots of parm cheese to give it flavor. Still, it certainly isn't bad and is a good base for making your own version

I made this with 1 cup cream (all I had left in the carton) and double the red pepper flakes (my husband and I love spice!). Really liked it. Easy and full of flavor. Used red and yellow bell peppers - green doesn't seem right for this. I will definitely make it again.

Decent, not spectacular. Fairly straightforward prep, easy for weeknight, but for that much cream I want something spectacular! Frankly, sauteed chicken with onions, peppers, mushrooms and garlic over pasta would be just as good (which I have made many times).

Have been making this for years (husband's favorite) with shrimp. Had it two nights ago and there was leftover sauce in the fridge and found a whole new use for it! Took fresh tilapia filets, dredged them in seasoned flour and pan fried them in butter and a touch of bacon fat. Simply warmed the sauce and poured over the fish--it was incredible! I recommend using U- 50 or smaller shrimp (ours were a bit large at U- 20). Also do the trick of reducing the chicken stock by half prior to adding the cream. Was absolutely amazing over the fish...

This was somewhat satisfying but I was disappointed at the lack of favor. Overall it was a pretty bland dish.

Perhaps it is not entirely fair for me to review this rec. since I altered the chicken prep. (I breaded it w/Panko and various seasonings..garlic, dried basil, salt, pepper, etc then baked it and chopped into chunks which I served on top of the pasta). While it was a family friendly dinner, I found myself very disappointed. I know a lot of other fabulous pasta recipes to use if I want to indulge in that much fat and carbs. I guess it was fine for what it was but I will not be making it again!

With so many prior reviewers, I don't know how much I will add to the discussion. I've made this about 5 times, and it is quite delicious. I substitute yellow, red or orange peppers because, like many have said, the green peppers are bitter. I made this last week for friends, and instead of cooking chicken breast, I used leftover chicken from a store bought rotisserie bird. It was great! The meat was tender and flavorful, and fell apart in the sauce which I liked. I don't like biting into a big hunk of chicken meat. I also left out fresh basil because I didn't have any. I substituted a little fresh rosemary instead. I also added some mixed herb seasoning. Definitely a great recipe that everyone will enjoy!

Great recipe. I use fat free half and half. To thicken, stir a couple of tbs. of flour into the veggies before adding the broth.

Rating: 0
Some reviewers have found the sauce here too thin. The amount of liquid specified strikes me as too great even if the cook turns the pasta into the sauce (not the sauce into the pasta) and heats it for a couple of minutes to let the pasta absorb sauce and get well- coated. There is a similar recipe on this site, "Linguine with Chicken and Walnut Sauce." Both recipes call for bell pepper (though the linguine recipe has 1/2 cup peas instead of a second pepper) , and both suggest 8 oz. pasta. The linguine recipe, however, calls for approximately half the amount of liquid and for a larger amount of chicken. The directions also call for the the ingredients to be mixed into the sauce and heated through.

Wonderful recipe! Have been using this for the past 4 years and everytime it gets better and better. Thighs are good because they're really flavorful and don't dry out as easily as breasts do. Also, juice of 1 lemon gives it an extra kick! I don't use green bell peppers, because it gives this dish somewhat of a bitter taste. Instead I use red, orange and yellow bell peppers for color and taste - looks great! Have made this for almost everyone I know and they never tire of it - they love it!

Rating: 3
I agree that as written the sauce is a bit thin, but I fudged and used a bag of shredded parmesan (actually the parm/romano blend) and it whisked it until it thickened. Perfect thickness and it clung to my bowtie pasta better. I'll also say that I don't like green bell pepper all that much and used only red bell pepper. The dried red chile pepper is a mark of genius for this dish.

Rating: 4
The sauce is a bit too thin if you follow the recipe, or at least it needs to be simmered much longer. If you use the equivalent amount of condensed chicken broth, it helps a lot. Also, mixing together a tbsp. of butter and a tbsp. of flour, as mentioned earlier, helps the sauce thicken a lot. This is an excellent, easy recipe and I make it all the time.

Rating: 4
This recipe is excellent. Normally I do not like green peppers, but once the sauce was fried/warmed, I put everything into the blender to make it smooth and spicy. I then put it back into the frying pan to thicken and added the cooked chicken. Delicious!

Rating: 3
This would be a four-fork recipe if the sauce was thicker. To achieve this end, increase the volume of butter to 3 tablespoons, and when you add the broth and cream cook it down until the cup volume from the broth is gone (just put it on higher heat). Add (one at a time) two egg yolks, stirring furiously with a fork after each addition. Also add 1/2-3/4 cup of cheese instead of the measly quarter cup. Salt and pepper as usual, everything else as usual. This will prevent you from swimming in a pool of thin sauce!

Rating: 4
This is one of those simple, flavorful recipes the whole family will eat. I used saute'd chicken breast, and cut the onion down to half of a small yellow onion. I also thickened sauce by cutting the chicken stock to 3/4 cup, and then adding a tablespoon each of butter and flour, mashed together. The next time I make this, I might add a few more red pepper flakes, just for some extra kick!

I have made this many times and it is a family favorite. I usually use chicken breasts and sambal oelek instead of crushed red pepper. I even use lower fat cream for cooking and compensate with some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Fresh basil is definitely a must.

) But I had my teeth whitened today and have to eat only whiteish things for 48 hours, and had chicken thighs out on the counter and basil and cream in the fridge needing to be used, so I figured it must be serendipity. Guess what? It IS a little Olive Gardeny, but so much better! A little more crushed red pepper gives a nice kick, and you can sub some of the heavy cream (but not all) for half n half without hurting it. My boy and I ate the whole thing!

After a few adaptations this recipe is great. I also had trouble with the thickening of the sauce, as I have had with many recipes due to the altitude I live at. A guide on how to addapt times with respect with altitude would be useful.

We made the recipe exactly as written except we substituted a yellow onion for a red one. While we were scarfing it down for dinner, we realized sweet and hot italian sausage would be wonderful in this dish - making it a creamy sausage and peppers with pasta. Will definitely use italian sausage next time!

If prep time isn't an issue, use a bechemel based cream sauce instead of just adding whipping cream to the pan. Makes the sauce richer. If the finished sauce isn't thick enough after simmering, try adding about 1 Tbls of beurre manie (mash equal parts of soft butter and flour together in a dish making a paste) to the sauce.

I have made this dish several time and it is excellent. Sauce thickens even more after you plate it and it has a few minutes to soak into the noodles. Excellent

Great recipe. After browning the chicken, I put the pieces on a plate with a paper towel underneath. Covered them in foil and kept them in a warm oven until they went back into the sauce. I had some bechamel sauce on the stove at the time and added 1/2 cup or so to the cream sauce. Made for a rich flavor and thickened the sauce nicely in only a few minutes. I upped the cheese to 1/2 cup.

I made this for Sunday dinner yesterday -- yum! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and was forced to substitute shredded medium cheddar for the parmesan, and dried basil for fresh. Result was delicious just the same. The cream sauce thickened perfectly, but as others have commented, it took a bit longer than the recipe says. I've done a similar recipe with chicken, cheese and green chiles in a cream sauce that is baked altogether in the oven. It also is outstanding and goes great with a Mexican or Spanish rice dish.

My husband said, "Great dinner, hon". My 4 year old and 2 year old also ate a lot of it. I was in a pinch so improvised. I like peppers so I actually used a whole red pepper and a whole green pepper and I reduced the liquid by half. Thus I used 1/2 c broth and only 3/4c cream. So I didn't have a problem with the thickness. I didn't have red onion so I used shallot and white onion. And I didn't have fresh basil so I was forced to use dried. But it was still delicious with all of my changes. I can't wait to make it exactly how the recipe reads to see if it is even better. Don't be afraid to improvise.

Absbolutely loved this dish! I do not like green bell peppers so I left it out.

Ok either 1/50 people have a refined palate or I am an awful cook (both very possible). I did not think this recipe was extraodinary in any way. The sauce did not thicken well when simmered down and I was left with a lot of chicken and very little oily, bland sauce that tasted strongly of basil. Also, never add chicken to a sauce and cook them together. No matter how you time it your chicken will be overcooked and rubbery. Cook the chicken seperately and add to sauce right before serving.

This is a delicious and simple pasta dish that my friends loved! I love the touch of spice that the red pepper flakes added to the sauce. It just takes it up that extra notch.

This is my current favorite pasta recipe, and I will use it again and again.

Very good simple pasta dish. I used thin skinless chicken breasts and they worked great. I also simmered about a 1/2 c. of sherry with the broth for 2-3 mins before adding half and half to enrich the flavor. For color and variety plan to add peas next time I make it.

One of my favourite recipes on this site. I agree that it takes a little longer to thicken than the recipe calls for; because of this, I remove the peppers when they are tender-crisp, and add them back in with the chicken at the end. As well, fresh pasta is a must for this dish.

Wonderful Recipe! Although I don't care for chicken or cream sauce. Instead I ommitted the chicken and replaced the cream sause with tomato sauce. I also thought the pasta should have been wider noodles in long sheets. I didn't think there was enough cheese so I added some ricotta, mozzeralla and eggs to the parmesan. Then it was easy, I just layered the sauce, noodles, cheese, etc and it made a great casserole!!! Yummm!

I'm amused by so many reviewers that offer helpful low-fat, no sodium, wheat-free, low-carb, vegan ways to make the more popular Epicurious recipes "healthier".

I doubled the recipe since I had nearly 2 lbs of chicken thighs. I ended up adding more garlic salt to taste at the end as the sauce was rather bland.

Great recipe. I needed to use up two chicken breasts leftover from the Cajun Chicken Salad recipe from this website. I reduced a whole can of chicken broth (don't like to waste the leftover broth), then added the whipped cream and simmered some more.

A very good and tasty recipe that is easy to follow. Do not wait until the end to make the pasta or you'll be waiting too long. I too added mushrooms and sauteed them along with the peppers.

A lot of times what I am looking for on this site is a good way to use up leftovers. With only the two of us left home, leftovers can prove to be a bit of a problem. The reviewer listed below is correct, deli chicken is excellent used in this dish and a time saver for the working couple. I made this dish a day ahead and reheated it with no problem, adding a little more cheese and fresh basil to brighten the mellowed flavors, brought up to temp on a low heat. The flavors are subtle, not intense, and light, despite the cream. Very, very good, easily halved for two. Can't wait to try this sauce with scallops!

Rating: 4
We are CRAZY for this dish! Have made it multiple times, for family and for guests and it never disappoints. I only half or less of each type of bell pepper and it suffices nicely. Be sure to thicken the sauce adequately - I find it takes quite a bit longer than 8 minutes but it's worth it for the sauce to be thick enough to cling to the pasta (you'll be tempted to lick your plate!!) WORKING MOM TIME SAVERS: I now use only the pre-cooked, pre-sliced grilled chicken and it's as delicious and presents as beautifully as ever. I also use the jarred minced garlic and dried basil to save on prep time and can't tell the difference. I have learned to keep cream and good, fresh parmesan in the house just for this recipe!

I had to modify this dish based on what I had on hand, and it was still marvelous. I used bone-in chicken thighs (took the skin off) and started off by cooking them in the butter in the pan until they were totally cooked through (probably took 30-40 minutes). I also used yellow and red peppers and yellow onion instead of the red. Just before the sauce was done, I added some fresh spinach which added lovely color with the red and yellow peppers. Delicious.

I'm making this *again* for a dinner party this weekend; a good salad, and bread. Make more sauce than you think you need! I have three kids so next time I would cut the spicy pepper flakes in half, though. Didn't use the green pepper, just more of the red, green is too bitter.

Well! This was really good! I made a full recipe for 2 of us. Appetizer portions can vary. I have enough left over for another meal. A salad, good chewy bread, this recipe & you have a really good dinner for 4 adults. Next time? If I have mushrooms, will add. Don't see the necessity for red onions. They lose their color. Yellow/white would be just fine. I also made this up ahead of time & slowly reheated while cooking the pasta. Just checking options. As for "thickening". I believe it is in the eye of the beholder--or taster. After adding the cheese, sauce seemed thicker. But not as thick as I thought it should be. After re-heating, I added about 1/4 cup of pasta water. Could have used a tad more sauce. But all in all--it was gooood!

Very yummy! We used light cream instead of whipping cream and it turned out nicely. It cooks pretty fast, so I would put the water to boil right when you start cooking so you won't be waiting too long for the pasta.

Skip the green bell peppers, and try adding half a chicken bouillon cube for extra flavor. Fantastic!

Fantastic! Tried this for a quick Sunday night dinner and it was so easy to make. I, too, added sliced mushrooms as per previous recommendation and a little extra garlic. Fiance commented that it was yummy yet light-tasting (unlike some heavier cream sauces).

I made this dish a few times and WOW. Its very delicious...However...I made a few changes before I was satisfied with it. The major change is that I cut and marinate the chicken breasts in lemon juice and a small spoon of Dijon mustard before I cooke it, you would not believe how much difference this makes. I also added a lot more garlic and instead of whipping cream I used heavy whipping cream (you can get it from the same place as the whipping cream). Finally, I found that using something besides regular fettuccine, like herb fettuccine adds extra flavor and works great. THIS IS A WINNER, you just have to be a bit creative with it. =)

This was a sensual delight. A perfect late-autmun pasta meal, complemented by a glass of pinot grigio. Per other reviewers' suggestions we doubled the garlic and used white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the garlic and hot pepper. We did use cream (instead of our usual half and half), and added a little yellow bell pepper for extra color, as well as some thinly-sliced mushrooms. The sauce did take a bit longer to thicken. When it was at a point where we were thinking "It's still a litttle too thin," we added the cheese, tossed in the pasta, cooked for another minute... perfect! Please eat this! You will make the world a happier place.

Loved it! A nice departure from what I usually serve my family. I added mushrooms and broccoli florets and accidentally put in way too much chicken breast but it turned out fine. Tasted very refined, and it begged for white wine!!! I also modified by adding paprika to get a nice color, plus a dash of white pepper (my favorite secret ingredient for just about anything from mac-n-cheese to mashed potatoes)- this added a little warmth. A touch more paprika as garnish on each plate made it as impressive to look at as it was to taste! Thanks for this recipe! I am not really much of a cook, and I pulled this one off!!!

It was so good! I added cornstarch at the end, and it came out wonderful. I would definitely make this again.

Excellent. I also added mushrooms. More garlic (you can never have too much garlic) and extra parmesan on top. The kids loved it too...although I did put in a bit more red pepper than I should have...they got a little "spiced out" after half a plate.

very very good. I followed the advice of another reveiwer and after sauting pepers added white wine and chicken broth then reduced to 2 tbsps. I used breast rather then thighs, added the cream then reduced for 20 mins. The idea of adding cornstarch is(to me)revolting just reduce more. Very good,I served ; spring greens with soppressate and grapefruit salad found on this website and hot homemade bread. Wil make again

We make this dish in Little Italy too. Here's how to improve it. Use 6 lg. breast instead, cook for 7 min w/ 2 tbsp butter. Use 2 minced shallot and saute. Add 1 tsp red pepper w/garlic, saute 5 min. Simmer stock and 2 cups cream for 10-12 min. Use 12 oz.'s fettucine. Sauce is a compliment. Never overwhelm the PASTA.

This recipe was good. The cheese in it was good, but it could have had a little more flavor. Next time I might add some sun dried tomatoes, and a few more spices. It is definitly something that you could experiment with. All my guests loved it though, and I would definitly make it again

I would definitely make this dish again. My boyfriend and I are not fond of peppers so I removed them before adding the chicken. The cream sauce reminded both of us of a coconut thai soup we both love. I think next time I will try using 1/2 coconut milk instead of just whipping cream and add shrimp.

Rating: 3
Made this with boneless chicken breasts and it is delicious. However, as many have said, the sauce does not thicken in 8 minutes. Next time I'm going to cook the sauce longer, after removing the peppers so they don't turn to mush. Also, I think I'll add mushrooms to the pepper and onion mix.

My husband is not a pasta lover. He refuses to order this "waste of time" in any restaurant. However, I am making this recipe this week and probably every week from now on. It was SOOOOOO good. I agree with some of the other comments, "allow more time for the cream sauce to thicken" and don't expect the sauce to be as thick as an alfredo sauce. I had to used dry basil instead of fresh, still very good.

I am getting ready to make this dish for the third time. First time I followed exactly with awesome results. The pepper flavor was outrageous!! Second time used half and half and it didn't turn out as flavorful. My husband is so tired of chicken but I know this is a recipe I can get away with!!

Absolutely delicious...and very reasonable in price and easy to get the ingredients in most of all foreign countries as well...due to fattening problems I skipped the cheese, used 1/2 cup cream but 2 cups stock instead, still great tasting, very light and versatile ... might try next time with more veggies and mushrooms.

It definitely took longer than 8 minutes for the sauce to thicken once I'd added the cream and broth, and the 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper seemed a bit too spicy for me, although my husband loved it! The end result was wonderful and I will definitely make this dish again.

This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever maden or eaten!!! I added frozen Italian vegetables and cream of chicken soup to mine. The cream of chicken soup helped to make it thicker. This is now a favorite that will be made quite often at our house!!! THANK YOU!!!

Very good - I made several changes, but not so as to affect the overall flavor. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1/2 whipping and 1/2 half and half, and addded parboiled carrots, brocolli, cauliflower. Also, when sauteing peppers (1/2 red, 1/2 yellow) I added chopped zucchini and portabello mushrooms. It did take a while to thicken and never did get to the consistency I had pictured, next time I will add some thickener to the broth before adding. Anyways - with all those additions it amde for a complete meal with some calabrese bread - delicious!

Very good combination of the heavy cream and spicy red pepper. I doubled the red pepper, and while i didn't have any chicken, the (vegetarian) dish turned out well. A very versatile and quick cream sauce -- use a variety of crisp vegetables, and chicken, scallops, shrimp, or even pork would probably work well.

I used shrimp instead of chicken and it was fabulous! I also halved the quantity of peppers and onion and it was perfect. This isn't going to be a regular because the of fat content, but I would use it for a dinner party or something special!

This is wonderful - I didn't add any parmesan because the sauce tasted so good without it. It thickened nicely after leaving it at a good simmer for about 10 minutes. For the chicken I used leftover marinated grilled chicken shredded into large chunks, this made it very easy to prepare and extra flavorful.

I have made this dish several times and my family loves it. It's very versatile.

This recipe is one of our favorite "cream style" sauces. It is very tasty and fairly easy to make. We use chicken breasts instead of thighs and because we use chicken bouillon instead of the prepared broth (as they don't seem to sell that here) we add a tablespoon of flour into the bouillon mixture to make sure it thickens. It thickens very nicely and tastes great! We also use a bell pepper fettucine when we can get it. Tres Bon!!

This recipe has great ingredients, however it does not work as suggested. Cooking down the sauce reduces such delightful strips of peppers to mush. Remove the peppers and cook down the sauce, what you get after you return the sautéed peppers to the right sauce is really good.

My entire family loved this dish (including 2 kids)! I am on a "diet", and made some adjustments:fat free evaporated milk + cornstarch instead of cream, only used 3T. asiago cheese instead of 4T., cooked the chicken by spraying the pan with Pam, also sprayed the veggies with Pam and used 2t. of olive oil before sauteeing. That cut the fat way down, but not the taste. I used poblano pepper instead of green and that added more spice. Yum. Sorry purists, sometimes health must come first. My kids added additional asiago but husband thought it was creamy and delicious without it.

My husband and I love this recipe. I make some omissions/changes - sometimes we add shrimp instead of chicken, sometimes we use no meat. I always omit the green and red peppers just because I can't stand them. Sometimes, I use cayenne instead of crushed, dried red pepper. I like linguine with it better than fettucine. This is great for dinner guests; however, my sauce always seems to thin out a good bit when I double the recipe.

I have been looking at this recipe for some time and I finally had a chance to make it. It was delicious, quick and very easy. I added Portobella Mushrooms, Yellow Peppers and corn starch at the end to thicken. Marinating the chicken before as an earlier review suggested would be a plus. I also found the need for alot more garlic and more pepper flakes. Even though I am not a spicy food eater.

This was good but can be made even better using a similar recipe I've stumbled on. Use chicken breasts and marinate over night in olive oil, basil, lemon, juice, crushed red pepper, and garlic. For sauce, after sauteeing vegetables, add 1/2 cup each dry white wine and chicken broth and reduce to 2 tbsp. (This process really makes the flavor intense and wonderful!) Then add cream and reduce by half; add parmesan and basil. Grill chicken and cut in strips. Arrange chicken over fettucine and pour sauce over. Enjoy!

With modifications, tasty and not too high in fat: I used 1 large can of low-fat evaporated milk + 1 bouillion cube for the sauce, added 1 other green pepper, and let the peppers and onions cook longer as we like them really well-done; I seasoned the chicken with ancho chilli powder and cayenne pepper before cooking it, for some extra spice, and my sauce thickened nicely while I cooked the pasta (I used spaghetti).
