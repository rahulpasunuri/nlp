This cake was just wonderful! So easy and a huge hit at my young son's class birthday party! The teachers requested a cake without creme or frosting, so I found this-- using homemade applesauce and adding a simple powdered sugar glaze were the only changes. I have had 3 requests for the recipe! A keeper!

Execellent when you are trying to lower cholesterol. Tasted quite good. Mine was very light...I used 2 tspns baking powder and no baking soda, 1 cup of maple syrup instead of 1/2 and 1 tspn of cinnamon instead of 1/2 tspn. I used one stick of melted butter...I would have put two in a regular recipe...and I added some chocolate chips and baked it in a heart shaped pan. Looked and tasted lovely and is supporting my reduction of bad cholesterol while still having my cake. Thanks

Yummy, quick, simple - drizzled some room-temperature maple cream over the top, added raisins, increased the syrup - yes, yes, I made many modifications, but the base recipe was also fab. as is.

Very good for winter afternoon tea or to cheer up winter-sad office staff. I prefer to cook less the cake to keep very moist inside. It is wonderfull with a hot spiced wine.

An easy and unassuming cake for a delicious breakfast on a non-special occasion. It has a fluffy, light, moist texture, is low fat, and with the following modifications I would definately make it again. I had no applesauce so I substituted buttermilk, which worked great. Taking other reviewer's advice, I substituted maple syrup for 1/2 the brown sugar, and doubled the cinnamon. Everyone had only compliments.

I just made this cake and it is light and delicious. I can definitely taste the maple, but if you prefer a deeper maple taste, try using Grade B maple syrup. I also used homemade applesauce that already had cinnamon in it. The house smells great while it's baking -- a very nice autumn dessert.

I used walnut oil instead of vegetable and added a 1/2 cup dark raisins. Quite yummy and my husband liked it a lot, too.

I was dissapointed w/ this repice. It was nothing special and it wasn't worth wasting the maple syrup the recipe required. Actually, you couldn't even taste the maple syrup in the cake! Kind of bland tasting w/ a dry texture. Definately wouldn't make it again.

Wonderful taste and just enough spice to be a November treat. I used homemade applesauce which already had sugar, so I cut the brown sugar in half. I can't wait to have another slice of the cake!
