The family loved this meals it was a nice change from the regular BBQ and marinades. For my kids who are not big fruit fans, they enjoyed the peaches. I like the fact that the prep time is quick. Nothing needs to sit over night or for multiple hours.

The peach sauce/dressing was amazing. I was a bit more generous with the chipolte and the cilantro/corriander and then added a bit of orange juice to up the pucker a bit. Given the comments from the other reviewers I was sceptical to relying on it alone as the chicken marinade. I marinated with fresh garlic, salt and pepper first then added the peach dressing. Definitely marinate the chicken the night before like the other reviewers said. I think I will try this with salmon too...yummy.

I rate this 2 and one half forks. It was "good" but not fabulous. The sauce turned out a bit ordinary; however the peaches were delicious. I view this recipe as a weeknight dinner.

I have made this twice for dinner parties and everyone raves about it (even those who don't care for chicken).

I marinated the chicken in the dressing for about 4 hours and thought it really lacked flavor. It needed more peach and more heat. I like the idea of this dish, it just didn't come out with the flavor punch I was hoping for.

This is a perfect summer grilling recipe. It's spicy and just sweet enough without being overbearing. I make the recipe as is and it works great, although I always belieeve you have to know your grill, so cooking times will vary. I serve it with grilled corn and a fresh mexican chopped salad with honey lime.

Grilled peaches are what made the dish. I marinated the chicken for 6hrs and the peachy flavor really didn't show up that much after the chicken was grilled.

This recipe is great. I used boneless chicken breast and rather than grilling I baked the chicken in the oven. About 10 minutes before the chicken was done I added in the sauce and peaches. I saved some of the dressing to add right before serving. Great summer meal.

We just had chicken so I made this with pork tenderloin and it was very good. The peaches are great with pork as well as chickien. I didn't have any problem with flare ups due to oil in the marinade--there was only 2 teaspoons.

We had to alter this a little bit because it's 110+ in Las Vegas and impossible to stand by the grill. First, I marinated the chicken in a mixture of plain yogurt, peach perserves, and a dry spice rub for a couple hours. Also, marinated the peach wedges in some EVOO and salt and pepper Then I breaded the chicken and baked it at 350. Sauteed the peaches in some more EVOO for a couple minutes. For the sauce, I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, and it turned out phenomenal. The chicken was so juicy, the peaches turned out great, and the sauce was the perfect compliment. It was a great alternative to the grilling. Hope this helps anyone that is not that great on the grill.

This recipe was amazing! Grilling the peaches really made the flavor intense and a good companion to the chicken. Marinating the chicken overnight is a must, and even with marinating it, the chicken's flavor was very low key and mild. The sauce was excellent. I served this with sauteed zucchini, yellow squash, onions and mushrooms. This side dish was excellent with the peach chipotle sauce! This recipe is definitely a favorite.

This was a great dish - the grilled peaches really are the show stopper. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and brined them the night before (which I think is a must); but next time I will use bone-in, skin-on. The sauce is very tasty and not too spicy - although it could have been a bit thicker (maybe leave out a little of the nectar). I recommend getting the grill smokin' hot before putting the peaches on so you can get some nice grill marks before they get soggy.

Very nice flavor combination! Thought the sauce with the chipotle might be a little too spicy but once it was on the chicken it was delicious. Used skin on, bone-in chicken breasts instead of boneless and peach/apricot preserves because that's what I could find. Next time I will double the sauce and marinate boneless, skinless chicken breasts. My husband and son loved this. The grilled peaches were great. If your chicken burns move it to a cooler part of the grill and adjust cooking time accordingly.

This was a really easy, and really good recipe. Its very healthy too! I made it almost identical to written. The only change I did was marinate the chicken in some of the sauce for about an hour before grilling. Grilling the peaches and adding them to the dish before serving makes a great presentation. A definite keeper!

I tried this recipe as it's written. Bad idea. First off the sauce that you put on the chicken before grilling has oil in it, so when that drips onto a burner or coals you'll get lots of flames, resulting in charred skin and surfaces. Second, DON'T follow the times if you are going to use the boneless chicken halves. The times are more for breast fillets. You try to grill at medium high heat on both sides for only 7 minutes on a breast half you'll end up with raw chicken. My recommendation is to use breast fillets and to use the sauce sparingly before grilling. Maybe put the sauce on towards the end, or cut the oil. If you are going to use actual breast halves, which are anywhere from 1.5 inches to 2 inches thick as cut, I'd recommend placing them on in- direct heat for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees, and then grill as the recipe calls for.

My wife and I loved this recipe. I brined the chicken first to make sure it would stay moist. I served the chicken with grilled vegetables with a harrisa sauce. When the two sauces mingled on the plate it created a very tasty surprise.

I liked the sweet-spicy/smoky dressing on this chicken, although I wasn't overwhelmed by it. It is basically grilled chicken with a sauce on top. The grilled peaches were yummy. I wish the chicken were marinated so that it had more taste.I might try to marinate the chicken in the sauce for several hours to add to the taste-not sure if that will work-might dry it out. It was so easy to make and the peaches make it a summery recipe. I liked it but was not as enthusiastic as others.

I made this last night, though I didn't have any peach nectar or peach preserves. I used apricot preserves and it turned out great. Not too sweet and definitely smokey.

This is a really, really good recipe that didn't need any adjustments (for our palette.) My fiance and I aren't easily impressed, but we both loved the flavors and ease of this dish. We served it with a little fresh guac and grilled corn on the cob with honey butter- awesome combo. This may become our summer staple.

This dish is amazing. Just the right amount of spicy and sweet. Note that the recipe has a small mistake in that it completely omits describing when to add the adobe sauce. I believe where it says "mix the next 3 ingredients" it should be "mix the next 4 ingredients". Thats what I did anyway and it turned out wonderfully.

I love Bon Apetit recipes and this certainly doesn't fail to deliver. The sweetness of the jam and peaches pair exceptionally with the adobo. I love grilled fruit paired with the chicken. Fabulous!! And easy too

This recipe was easy and delicious. A perfect way to use fresh summer peaches. The sauce was a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and served it with rice and arugula topped with the peach dressing. Yum!

Made this for a family cook-out. Wow! Was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and smoky with the chipotle.
