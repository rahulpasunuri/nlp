This was not a hit for my family and I. None of us could put our finger on what we didn't like, but a common remark was that it was just a little too busy. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a LOT of work for such a small amount of soup (serves four modestly). I won't make it again.

Excellent! The shrimp stock makes this soup rich and delicious. I used red lentils, red wine, and skipped the 5- spice. I will definitely make this soup again.

I followed the previous reviewer's advice and cut back on some of the seasonings. I left out the 5 spice powder, fennel and brandy and it was plenty tasty! I love, love this dish and was very proud of myself...this will be a dish I make for guests.

This was excellent on a chilly Autumn evening when we needed something warm and satisfying. Next time I make it I will double the broth. That is the only change I will make.

Too many herbs fighting for attention, Keep it simple, tarragon would do fine or equal quantities of basil 7 coriander would suffice
