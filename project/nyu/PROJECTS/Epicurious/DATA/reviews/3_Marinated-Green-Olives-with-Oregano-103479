I couldn't find the molasses so I thought I'd replace the regular olive oil with Blood Orange olive oil. Delicious!

I thought this was really excellent. One huge hint: use pitted olives -- the marinade gets in them and the flavor is incomparable. Otherwise the flavor only coats the olives and you don't get the true beauty of it. Served as part of a Thanksgiving appetizer buffet (a few hours before the meal) with whole wheat pita triangles to dip in the leftover marinade. It looks beautiful as well with the lemon slices and I would put in nice containers and give as Christmas gifts. Excellent!

I made these olives for my bookclub and people could not stop eating them! If you love olives, this is delicious and different.
