I made this tonight- no lemons in the house, so I used cider vinegar and a shot of tabasco. Also used dried oregano, since my herb garden is under a few feet of snow. I will definately make this again and again. It was wonderful on the side with bbq pork sandwiches.

This is a light, healthy, and refreshing summer salad, so easy to make with ingredients I had on hand. The fresh oregano was a nice touch that blended well with the cumin. Will make this again and again.

This dish was a nice addition to a tapas party. It was light, perfect for hot weather, and my guests loved it. I plan to make it again.

This recipie is extremely simple and forgiving (quantities are flexible). When you get sick of carrot sticks, this is a fantastic change of pace.

i make a similar salad, but it's a bit simpler: no oregano, no zest, more lemon juice, more cumin. so it's just shredded carrots, olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, salt and pepper. my mom's been making this salad all my life, sans olive oil -- it's a very traditional (and refreshing) middle eastern/south asian salad. mmm!

I tried this after looking for a easy carrot salad recipe.It looked a little strange but went ahead hoping it would be one of those recipe's that sounded weird but was fantastic. Nope..... it's just weird tasting!!!!

Hmmm....a bit too much cumin...somewhat overbearing. I would halve the amount.
