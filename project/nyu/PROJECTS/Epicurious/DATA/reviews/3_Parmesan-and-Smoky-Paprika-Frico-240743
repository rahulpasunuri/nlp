the recipe as written is a time- consuming mess, but the flavor is so good I had to find a better way of making these. After fooling around with the skillet method for a couple of turns, i gave up and lined a few cookie sheets with non-stick foil, spread the mixture in 1/8 cup rounds and stuck them in a 350 degree oven for a minute or two. Watched them closely and took out as they're completely melted and bubbly. Once they're cool enough to touch, you can shape them into just about anything - flutes, tubes, mini cups, etc. Mine will be a great holder for bloody mary infused shrimp hors d'oeuvres tomorrow. YUM!

Tried this using shredded Asiago cheese and they were just great. Very easy to make and quite impressive. Definitely will make again and try adding various herb or blends.

I actually wasn't that impressed with the outcome of these. It was dificiult to get the texture really crispy, some of mine were fairly crisp, but others were more on the chewy side. They were also pretty finicky to make as they could only be flipped when they had cooled a bit, but if they cooled too much, they came out really dull and flat looking on that side.

Amazingly delicious and extremely simple. Can be made with many different spices.
