This is by far the best potato salad recipe I've ever tried. Excellent taste! No other recipe gets the compliments that this one does when I make it.

This is a classic, old fashioned potato salad that is excellent. I would definitely make it again.

One of the best potato salads I ever made. Used Yukon Gold potatoes, yogurt instead of sour cream, and scallions as the onions. Still delicious, savory, crunchy, creamy, low fat.

i reduced the mayo and sour cream to 1/2 cup each (still PLENTY of dressing) and used "light" versions of both. i also tried a horseradish/dill mustard in addition to the dijon...delish!

I cannot believe anyone considers this a "great recipe." All that mayo and sour cream...I feel nauseous just thinking about it. For anyone who actually cares about their health (and weight) try German potato salad - a much tastier alternative, and you can actually taste the potatoes!

This has been "my" potato salad recipe since I tried it. I too use a little less mayo and cream, and add an extra egg (or garnish it with deviled eggs), and I like lots of mustard. For even better texture and flavor, I recommend Julia Child's foolproof system: Scoop out some potato-cooking water before draining the potatoes. Drain the water out of the pan, cover and let the potatoes firm up in the hot pan for 3-4 minutes. Turn out into a bowl and toss with the vinegar and a few spoonfuls of the cooking water. The potatoes will absorb the liquid as they cool and with the extra moistness they won't soak up so much dressing.

Have made this for two family occasions this summer. My husband hates potato salad but sampled this one and came back for more. I followed earlier reviewers' suggestions to decrease the amount of sour cream, double the eggs and add a tsp. of horseradish. Even my picky-eater teenaged grandson liked it.........a lot. This is now my potato salad recipe.

for all the rich (and caloric!) dressing, this was fine but not fabulous. one could easily reduce the amounts of mayo and sour cream to 1/2c. each and still have plenty to coat the potatoes. i'll be trying something else next time.

This one got rave reviews from the guests and is very good. Would make it again.

I used low fat mayo and low fat sour cream, which I don't believe affected the taste, which was good...however, it must have had a negative effect on the emulsion. I made it the night before and not only was it runny in the am, as another review noted, it actually separated before I served it. I wound up draining it! Never again.

I will probably make it again, but am still hunting for that great basic potato salad recipe. This was a little too basic for my tastes (i.e. nothing wrong with it, but not terribly tasty either)

Make this for friends at a bar-b-que (along with Triple-Bean Bake. I boiled the potatoes first with skins, then cut into 1" pieces, saving as much skin as possible. I followed advice of others and also used reduced fat mayo, and reduced the sour cream amt to 1/2 c. I also added about 1/2 c. or so of diced red bell pepper for color. That addition was perfect for color and mild flavor. I increased the eggs from 2 to 4---a must! The suggestion to add crisp, crumbled bacon just before serving is a real plus for both presentation and flavor! I made this dish up the day before but would not do it quite that soon next time. I would, instead, make it the night before. It got just a little bit watery at the bottom for me. I will definitely make it again. Everyone asked for the recipe.

Have made this SO many times - always to rave reviews. It's a slightly updated version of grandma's - always welcome at any BBQ or picnic. Don't peel the potatoes, double the eggs and throw in a tspn of horseradish. Best made the day before. Excellent!

I made this last weekend for a BBQ and am making it again for the 4th. Everybody loved it and many asked for the recipe. I followed other suggestions and doubled the eggs and reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup. This is now my only potato salad recipe!

This was great. Has the tartness that I remember from Grandmother's recipe. Added crumbled bacon.

This brought positive reviews at a Father's Day BBQ. It is a tasty and healthy basic recipe from which I expanded and experimented - both modifying and adding a few ingredients. My modifications: - leave the skins on the potatoes (adds interest, nutrients and convenience) - use 4 eggs instead of 2 - use 1/2 cup fat-free sour cream - use low-fat mayo My extra yummies added for crunch and flavor: - crisp snow peas - radishes - mustard powder - horseradish - orange cherry tomatoes - carrots - sunflower seed sprouts - celery seed Bon appetit!

This is a creamy, mild salad good for gatherings where there'll be people who don't like more mustard-intensive potato salads. Omitted the eggs and used cider vinegar and green onions, and it tasted great.

I have always made potato salad without a recipe but had an occasion to make potqto salad for 50 and really need a recipe. This was perfect times 4. Added extra eggs, doubled the amount of celery and used cilantro instead of celery. Otherwise followed the recipe. It is wonderful and will be my standby from now on. Try this one.

Thought this recipe was top rate. I also decreased the sour cream and added more mayo. I'm not crazy about the quanity of onions and may cut it down next time. I still haven't found a recipe for deli style potatoe salad, like the type found here in NY.

I tried this recipe out for a b-day celebration. Thought it was pretty good. Took into consideration the other cooks recommendations, i.e., less sour cream and the substitution of cilantro for the Italian parsley. I doubled the eggs, from two to four, and added some garlic. I also added more celery - we like lots of CRUNCH! Pretty tasty. We'll make this again, I'm sure.

This would be a "2 forks" without significant modifications... I eliminated the white wine vinegar altogher (didn't have any), but I might add it to the dressing and only use about 1.5 tsp. I also decreased the mayo to 1/2 cup, replaced onion w/shallots, and, most importantly, used a mix of GRAINY + HONEY Dijon. If I didn't have the Honey Dijon, I would have added regular honey to offset Dijon's inherent bitterness, without sacrificing its pungent flavor. The Grainy Dijon adds a nice texture and looks more interesting for serving. Maybe using green onions, or adding radishes, etc. to this average potato salad will make it a winner!

I think the vinegar amount is fine - I wonder if those who found it too strong did not use a good white wine vinegar, just regular white. I did cut down on the sour cream also. I made it with low-fat mayonnaise and sour cream and everyone really liked it.

For 25 years I have been looking for the ultimate potato salad recipe and I have finally found it in this recipe. I used 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream. Added more hard boiled eggs. My husband and his friend have made me make it 4 weeks in a row.

Too vinegary for me, I had to add some sugar add the end to offset it.

Simple...and tasty...however replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt as one of our guests is lactose-intolerant and didn't want the salad to mayo tasting. Used only a portion of the dressing as we like our salad not so swimming in dressing.

Really tasty. I made this for a birthday party and was asked by several for the recipe. I added capers and kalamata olives. Also, a an extra tablespoon of vinegar.

It's very good. I think it would taste even better with yellow or Yukon gold potatoes.

This is a very good recipe that is even better the next day. I too would use less sour cream.
