3 forks only because it needs some tweaking. Its really not enough mascarpone and stock. I omitted the thyme because I didn't think I would like it with lobster. I added crispy pancetta at the end and also some basil to the other herbs. I also used the shells to make a lobster stock instead of the chicken broth. With 3/4C of lobster stock and 1.5 tubs of mascarpone, it was really lovely. My guests all came back for seconds. I used a very delicate pappardelle and served 7.

I made this recipe because I wanted to use lobster, but my guests thought it was better _without_ the seafood. It also made for generous portions -- I think I could have fed 12 with this recipe. I'll make this recipe again, but omit the lobster and save $50.

I can't seem to change my forks. I meant to give it a rating of three forks. I thought the recipe was very good, but it needed more sauce, hence three rather than 4 forks. I will make this again, but will bump the sauce up by half. It will then rate 4 forks.

Ok, so I read the reviews and adapted...made some fresh shrimp stock by boiling the shrimp shells for about 30 minutes and substitued that for the chix stock. Also used 8 oz of mascarpone to help thicken....also made the sauce richer. Added a bit of red pepper for a 'zing'...It was a great hit with my family. My 15 year old loved it...However, as a side note, not sure about your family, but one pound of pasta does not feed eight in my family..it feeds four.

Amazing. The end.

I hated giving this recipe 1 fork. Let me say that first. I thought, in preparation, that the proportions seemed a little odd and I wondered how so much pasta and lobster would sauced up by such a small amount of broth. I followed the recipe exactly, though, and made an extra, "more flavorful" pan of sauce on another burner. I held out hope but was left with a bland mouthful of fresh ingredients and nothing to bring them together. So I sauced it up and we had a lovely dinner @_@

This was very good. I didn't have mascarpone cheese on hand so I used goat cheese and the sauce was very tasty. The taste of the herbs came through well. It could have bigger flavour (maybe some lemon zest?) but it was very fresh with the spring peas and I like one reviwer's idea of ading asparagus.

This was really easy and pretty tasty. I will admit that I used shrimp and dry pasta, but I'm taking that into account with rating this... of course it would be better with those ingredients! That being said, I thought the sauce was a bit bland and very, very thin. I added a bit of flour to thicken it and that was nice. I also used a broth made from the shells of my shrimp to increase the flavor. Overall, a good, fast weekday meal but nothing too special.

I made this with cooked lobster meat and I added blanched asparagus at the end. Our guests loved it!

Yummy, pretty, and easily modifiable. I added some tomato paste to the garlic and oiled pan and left out the peas. Sprinkled a bit of red pepper flakes to give some zing to the dish. I also used Langostines instead of lobster using the juice as a way to infuse flavor into the sauce. Good stuff.

This is a fabulous and easy dish. I have gotten rave reviews when made for friends and family. I use flash frozen lobster meat from Maine. Cozy Harbor brand is THE BEST.I have also tried it with cilantro instead of the parsley and that adds a nice kick.

I thought the sauce was bland, so I added 1 bay leaf and black pepper. The taste of lobster came through nicely and my hubby wants me to make it again. Don't have lobster - use shrimp, scallops or white fish.
