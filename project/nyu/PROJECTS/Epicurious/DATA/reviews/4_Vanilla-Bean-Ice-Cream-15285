Really delicious and easy to make. I added 1/2 teas of sea salt to the recipe and cooked the mixture beyond 170 to a more custardy stage. I made it in one batch, but probably should have done two. I used organic cream, milk, sugar, and eggs - wow!

Great, simple recipe! I used 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of heavy cream to lighten (a little!), added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and only 1 cup of sugar. It was still the most delicious vanilla ice cream we've ever had. A definite keeper!

I don't even like ice cream and this is to die for! It is better than any ice cream I have had from a store, exponentially.

Easy & delicious. We'll be having it with warm brownies (him) and blackberry-pear cobbler (me) later tonight, but couldn't resist an early taste... you know, just to make sure it turned out alright. Heh heh. http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a32/EricaMmm/Yummy%20Goodness/FirstTasteSmaller.jpg?t=1227822954

This is a fantastic, easy, basic Vanilla Ice Cream! I made 1/2 a portion and it fit nicely in my maker. I used a Tahitian Vanilla Bean (simply because I love them!) and added a few drops of Tahitian Vanilla Extract. The things you could do with this are limitless!

This is simple and delicious! We have been eating this with bananas foster. Just add a bit of alcohol, vodka or rum prior to putting it in the ice cream maker.

Very rich with a vanilla/custard flavor. Delicious with fresh fruit. Although my machine has 1-1/2qt capacity, I should have prepared in two batches as suggested. After a bit of freezer time, it had a great consistancy.

Excellent recipe. Very easy and the flavor is terrific. I suggest you use Madacascar vanilla beans for the most flavor. This really makes a difference. Be sure to scrape out ALL of the little beans from the pods. I used the Krups ice-cream churn. I filled it up once and kept the balance of ice-cream in the frige and when the first batch was ready I used the rest from the frige. It really is terrific.

I would like to have this recipe to make in 6qt ice cream churn!
