This very good - especially when fried with peanut oil. For a lower fat and seasoned chip, I do this: Set oven to 400 degrees. Mince up 3- 4 cloves of garlic into a large bowl; add desired amount of pepper; add about a 1/2 cup of olive oil. Then, if you haven't already, wash your hands, take off all your rings and add sliced yams into the bowl. Separate them, and get that garlic-pepper oil on each side. I used parchment paper-lined baking sheets, and lay yam slices down in a single layer. Sprinkle kosher salt on each one. Bake for 15 minutes. Then, take out of oven, sprinkle finely grated asiago or parm on each chip and even, chopped parsley for color. Put back into oven for 5 more minutes. Some chips may end up with soft middles, but it doesn't really matter, 'cause they'll be gone in few minutes!

Excellent - just what I was looking for. 1/2 peanut oil to 1/2 veg. Served on a platter with soft shell crabs over succotash.

These were delicious and easy to make. I used peanut oil and that's it.

When I made this, I used peanut oil instead, and it added a distinct flavor to the sweet potatoes. Granted, it also added a considerable amount of fat, but I have to say that I would prefer the peanut oil to the vegetable. Served with a Yogurt-Feta dip, these make a great casual appetizer!

I top the sweet potato chips with grated Gorgonzola cheese and broil.
