Everybody loved the turkey. The recipe I found easy to follow. I made everything told, however, I mixed butter with herbs and rubbed it under the skin, and I basted the turkey every hour. My bird was ready before I anticipated. It's very important to use the thermometer even before the popper pops. I would repeat this recipe again.

This was the first turkey my wife and I have ever made and boy am I glad we picked this recipe! All of our guests said that this turkey had the most flavorful white meat. I will absolutely make this turkey again and again and again! We had a 23 lb. turkey, so I doubled everyhthing. I used Deschutes Jubleale instead of a stout. If you are looking for the malt syrup the recipe calls for, look for a local homebrew shop or any online retailer that sells homebrewing supplies, like Northern Brewer. I used light dry malt extract for both. Instead of only glazing the bird, we seperated the skin from the breast and massaged the glaze in under the skin as well as glazing it. I also cooked it for the first 4 hours breast side down, flipping it over for the last two hours. to brown. You won't be sorry if you make this recipe

We have made this recipe 2 years in a row and we're no longer allowed to make ANYTHING ELSE! So moist and delicious, it's a big hit - and easy to prepare, too!

This was so delicious that I'm making it again this year! If you are making the gramercy tavern gingerbread (delicious) also, you can just buy a six-pack of guinness.It was so well received that my husband (Mr. Particular) is asking for it again. This year, instead of driving myself crazy running around town and calling places to find malt barley syrup, I just ordered it online and it showed up at my door. A lot less hassle...

i made this turkey for my family last thanksgiving ('10). we brine our turkey every year, but this year was special because 1) it was the largest amount of people we've had for Thanksgiving (27 people!) and 2) it was a 30lb bird (thankfully i work at a grocery store and got a discount). not ONLY was this the easiest brine and cooking that i've done for the past 4 years, but it was the most flavorful turkey my family has had EVER. i received nothing but compliments. the only difference was i used Lagunita's Brown Sugga beer. but hands down, THE. BEST. BIRD.

The only modification I made was that due to travel (I transported the brining bird about 250 miles) it was brining longer than called for. I will definitely make this again. It was a little saltier than I wanted although noone else seemed to think so. Next time, I won't go over on the brining time and I'll adjust the salt/water ratio for the brine.

Made this turkey more or less to the letter- except I have a very large famiy and used a 23 pound turkey! The brine wasn't quite enough, so I just flipped the turkey over a few times throughout the night and it seemed fine. Maybe that's why mine didn't turn out as salty as everyone else's? I also used the recommended malt syrup too, and it was very sweet, not bitter. Anyway, I could have used more of the glaze, (this turkey was HUGE) but it still turned out amazing- this was a huge hit with my family and it looked almost as beautiful as the one in the magazine. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I loved the flavor the brine gave the bird, but I would skip the glaze. It was a beautiful color, but it ruined my crispy skin. To avoid bitterness, I would use the malt syrup from Whole Foods. I think it was Eden's Choice.

This recipe was an absolute hit with my family.

I am surprised to see the low reviews this turkey has gotten. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was by far the best turkey I have ever served. The brine gave the turkey the perfect taste. I did not have the syrup the recipe called for so I used maple syrup instead. I also baked the turkey breast side down. You would not believe how incredibly juicy your bird will be making it this way!! If you want some of the browing you can flip it over for the last 30 minutes or so of baking. You won't be sorry.

I did not have high expectations for this recipe, but I just wanted to make a Bon Appetit turkey recipe, having only read them in the past. I could not find malt syrup at the grocery and did not want to make a special trip, so I used ALAGA (cane) syrup. I also used O'Doul's Amber NA beer that had been left at my house and I wanted to get rid of. The smell of the turkey cooking was wonderful with all of the aromatics, and the taste was great, too. The carcass is in the stock pot today for some future good things.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was all way more trouble than it was worth. I was excited to try it but.... just a lot of money for not much taste at all. Would not recommend this one - and that's a first for my several years' worth of epicurious.com (successful) culinary adventures.

This was a surprisingly good turkey, particularly considering it was my first turkey ever. For me, the glaze was sweet and not bitter - I used Eden's, which might be part of the reason why - my DH says most other malt extracts are hopped and so are rather bitter. Also, while I agree that the brine isn't enough to cover the turkey, I added one more bottle of stout and another 2 quarts of water and it *just* covered it. The turkey gained raves over here, all around.

this was an ok turkey for the cost and amount of effort it took. the glaze and brine required 1.5 bottles of malt, and there wasn't enough brine to cover the entire turkey. the malt flavor in the brine wasn't very strong, but the glaze was bitter and left the skin very salty. for next year's turkey i will go back to brown sugar instead of malt syrup. it'll taste the same, and will be 1/10 of the cost.

I have made far better turkeys from Bon Appetit. The glaze was bitter and the gravy didn't match the turkey at all. With most brining, the turkey is nice and moist, not so with this one. Will not make this again. Maybe I should have tried the salted Turkey with the Lemon and Oregano.

I made it exactly as it was published and I was puzzled why the brine time was so short- the comments below maybe explain that. Also, I discovered that the barley malt syrup amount for the brine is about one 20 oz jar. The glaze is about half a jar. This was wonderful. We cooked it on a charcoal grill which was a bit tricky (temperature-wise) but my husband of almost 20 years said it was the best turkey he had ever had... that's saying a lot- he LOVES turkey! If you make this, don't skip the mushroom gravy- delicious!!

I have to disagree with the other comments re the brining ratio. The customary ratio is 2 cups of kosher salt per gallon. I do think the table salt ratio is a bit heavy on the salt, it should be more like 1 1/4 cups or less of table salt per gallon.

Agree with the previous reviewer on the brine ratio. As it is, the brine isn't enough to cover the turkey. The addition few quarts of water helps this as well.

WARNING - I think the brine ingredients are WRONG. Generally, it's one cup of salt to one gallon of water. This uses about half the water. I had a VERY salty brine - so salty I think it would have ruined the turkey. I increased the water in keeping with 1 cup to 1 gallon of liquid.
