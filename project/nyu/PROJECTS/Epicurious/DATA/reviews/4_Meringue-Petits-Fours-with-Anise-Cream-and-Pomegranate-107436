Very pretty, easy and different. Of course, in March there wasn't a pomegranate to be found. I put a dap of red current jelly on eash for looks but I bet the pomagranate is better.

Made these for a Christmas Tea. They were very beautiful and tasted great as well. Only negative is the meringue got a little soft on the plate.

My sister made these for Christmas eve dinner... even though she assembled them 8 hours before instead of just before and got a little soft, they were lovely to look at, and tasted like little puffs of Christmas. Totally wonderful.

Couldn't be simpler. I just made these and we love them. I wasn't able to get 48 meringues, though. I got about 30. Also, my oven's lowest temp. is 200. I just shortened the baking time and kept watch.
