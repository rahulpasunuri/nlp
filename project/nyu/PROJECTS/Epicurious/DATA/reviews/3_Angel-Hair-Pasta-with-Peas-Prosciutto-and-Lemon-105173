This is a terrific dish, full of flavor. The key is to use the best ingredients - fresh lemon, great pasta, and freshly grated cheese. We use clam juice rather than white wine for a deeper flavor - we also increase the cream to 1/2 cup, reduce the fresh lemon juice to 3 tsp and add some red pepper flakes for extra zing. But the real secret to this dish is the pasta - we use Trader Joe's Lemon Pappardelle - this is the perfect lemony pasta to go with this sauce - and being much thicker than angel hair, it absorbs the sauce and goes great with the chunks of prosciutto and the peas. This is a simple yet intense dish, appropriate for guests.

OMG....what a waste of time, effort and money! I used only the best ingredients and this "surprise dish" for my Wife was horrible!!!! No taste whatsoever save for a tinge of lemon! Neither salt nor pepper nor butter could cure this one!!! This took place within the past 15 minutes and right now the Wife is out getting take out and I just finished sending $20 worth of crap down the disposal!!!!!

This dish was, sadly, just okay. I was excited a creamy lemony sauce, but it was thin and a little too lemony - even with half of the amount of lemon juice. It wasn't a total waste of ingredients, but I'm glad that I didn't put the sauce on all of the pasta that I made, or I would be stuck eating it for a couple of meals. Not sure what would fix this recipe, but I probably won't be making it again.

Took the advice and used roughly half the listed amount of lemon juice. I also used a fraction more than the directed amount of cream to adjust for the pasta amount. the result was fabulous. It was light, not too creamy, and had a great flavor. Definitely will make again, and a nice alternative to tomato sauces.

A nice dish for a springtime dinner. I substituted fatfree half-and-half for the whipping cream. Add it last and cook just until heated through otherwise it will become stringy and clump.

It was a simple summer mid-week meal. Wasn't worth the cost of the prosciutto for the result, and might try a bulkier pasta next time. OK.

This is a light pasta dish with subtle flavors. What makes it interesting is the combination of the salty prosciutto, the sweet peas and the tangy lemon. I like to add extra whipping cream when it is served to make it a little more creamy. Very yummy.

This is better with a little cayenne or hot pepper flakes. Also better with broader pasta, such as bowties.

I doubled this and used the zest and juice of one lemon. I like lemon! Also more than doubled the cream. I suppose if you're not a big lemon fan, this might be a bit much (see other reviews). But we really liked it.

What a disappointment! This is the first Epicurious recipe we've disliked. Everything seemed to be on target: we love each of the ingredients, we eat pasta with lots of very different sauces, such quick cooking time...alas, not a winner. It wasn't too lemony for us, but the combination - probably the amounts more so than the flavors - was out of balance. If you're going to make this, I'd suggest 1. a little more cream (be careful not to get it too hot or it will curdle when you add wine or lemon juice!), 2. less lemon juice and more lemon zest 3. don't add the prosciutto to the sauce - just sprinkle it on as you're plating the dish 4. if you're using frozen peas, don't microwave them beforehand. We did 1 min. in our microwave (ready to go, but could still use a little heat) then added them as directed and cooked the sauce for two minutes - and they were overdone! Aaah, well, at least our salad turned out! :)

This is good but it's easy to overcook any of the elements. I think it's really important to have mis en place and start the pasta just a tad before the sauce. I think the lemon is perfect in it. Will make again but will be better prepared! This would also be a nice side to roasted chicken. Who has a foolproof plan for tossing angel hair?

Woah...holy lemon! I'm a big fan of anything that has lemon in it, so I didn't mind. But, I don't think I would ever serve this to guests if I didn't know if they liked lemon or not. I don't care for prosciutto, so I used crumbled bacon instead. I found the overall product a little dry. Maybe I reduced the sauce too much. At any rate, this recipe is average. I'll probably make it again because it's easy, but it certainly isn't my favorite.

Made this last night with a few modifications. I added sliced, sauteed mushrooms. I didn't have white wine on hand, so I used some of the pasta cooking liquid with the cream. However, I think I would have actually liked a bit more sauce overall. I also cut back on the amount of lemon based on other reviews. Maybe I cut back too much. I ended up squeezing a bit of lemon on top of mine before eating and that was great. Will definitely make again. My husband liked the combination of "fresh" flavors like lemon with the heartier prosciutto.

It was a bit hit with my dinner companions. A nice blend of flavors.

I love this recipe. I hope somebody would love this. My mom usually makes noodles and peas with proscuitto, but this was different. My brother and I had a candle at the table and we both had seconds (and he hates everything!). We hope there's some left for our dad!

if you don't like lemon, then, duh, you won't like this recipe. we loved it and have made it a few times, without the cream, too. I've also added nicoise olives and calamata olives, and we loved the extra saltiness against the lemon/cream.

Would anyone be willing to try this recipe with some preserved lemon....and rate it??

This is such a wonderful recipe. I used thin spaghetti instead of angel hair and substituted heavy cream for the whipping cream, I used more cream than was called for in the recipe which toned down the lemon flavor.I also used parmesan instead of pecorino romano, and it tasted wonderful. I would definitely make this again.

I have too made this dish twice. And taken the advice of previous reviews, I took it easy on the lemon juice but added a bit more zest. Also sauteed the prosciutto(must have parma, it is the only way) with a little finely chopped onion and garlic. It is quick and easy and absolutely love it. A new twist to cabanara!

I have made this dish twice now--my husband loves it. It is easy to prepare and very tasty. I followed other reviewers' suggestions of adding sauteed garlic and reducing the amount of lemon juice and had good results. I will definitely make this in the future.

This was excellent! I sauteed the prosciutto in some mined garlic and a little bit of olive oil before adding it to the sauce -- the garlic added a really nice flavor. I also used half and half and a little more wine than called for, didn't need any of the reserve liquid. Will definitely make again!

I thought the quantity of lemon juice sounded excessive, too, so I just used a squeeze with the full amount of lemon zest. This kept the flavor a little more subtle. I used also added a handful of snipped chives and whole wheat fettucini instead of angel hair. I liked this dish quite a bit because it comes together so quickly and will make it again.

I make this on a regular basis because it's so easy and tasty. I never use reserved cooking liquid, I just bump up the amounts of wine and cream at the outset. Depending on personal taste, perhaps decrease the lemon. I like lemon in main dishes, but my husband believes lemon should only appear in desserts!

I made this with fettucine, and it would have been delicious, but I ignored the warnings about too much lemon juice. It was a bit acidic, but I would make it again with half the lemon juice. The prosciutto in it was delish!

Excellent, very light and tasty. Don't know why it didn't work for others, we loved it. It would be good with bacon if no prosciutto on hand.

This was really quite terrible. A waste of good ingredients, as another reviewer said.

I liked the flavour of the sauce with the lemon peel in it, but once the juice was added the flavour was ruined for me. My family did not care for it either and we have extremely adventursome palates.

What an excellent and refreshing dish! I used pasta cooking liquid instead of the cream, added a bit a garlic, and made linguini instead of angelhair pasta. We made this dish two weeks ago - will we make it again? Yep, tonight!

I made this recently for my family. It was quick, easy, and delicious. The kids liked it, too. I added olive oil to the pasta to keep it from sticking, and that added flavor to the sauce. A great summer supper dish.

This was really good! I kept "nipping" at the sauce (pasta, that is) & thought it was going to be way to lemony. I knew for sure hubby wouldn't like it. Had peanut butter handy. By the time I put all of the components together--it was really good! And very refreshing on a hot day when you don't want to cook much & are craving pasta in something besides a salad. I think next time I would saute some garlic in a teeny bit of olive oil. Oh! Hubby cleaned his plate! :)

I loved this recipe and would make it again, possibly leaving out the cream and adding garlic. It was a hit with my guests, they all wanted the recipe.

I made some changes to the recipe which made it better. Use ziti, or spring pasta instead of ange hair, and I substituted small shrimp for the prociutto.

A good, light all-in-one dinner for a Sunday evening. Definitely reserve the cooking liquid and use prociutto!

Okay, I admit I made a few changes. First, I started off with finely chopped garlic and omitted the cream. I used crisp Turkey bacon that I added at the very end of the recipe. A dash of lemon pepper and this was great. I had a package of frozen peas, linguine and the bacon. It was a Friday evening after a long week and I wanted some comfort food. This meal worked for me.

Not good...I agree that this is a waste of great ingredients...I followed the recipe to a T.

This was not good. I followed the recipe as directed, except for using thinly sliced ham instead of prosciutto, and it just turned out awful. Very disappointing and a waste of good ingredients. I hope others had a better experience with this than I did. Otherwise, stay away.
