Other than high altitude changes, adding rum to the topping and using buttermilk I followed this recipe exactly. It was very good and everyone seemed to like it. But, no one asked me for the recipe. Maybe I should have served it with ice cream or something..

This cake was too moist... I went ahead and added three eggs instead of two (like someone else suggested) and that was a bad idea.

Changes that make this CAKE: Topping: add extra butter ( i put extra butter down as several pats of butter), brown sugar, dark rum, and a liquer like Gran gala, etc For the Cake: add an extra egg, use half and half instead of milk, and spice it up with more cinnamon, and nutmeg. Instead of using a regualr pan, use a cast iron skillet, and bake in the oven. My cake turned over perfectly with lovely caramel drippings

First time I made it just as written, and it was good. But then the seconde time around I made these few changes, and it really made a difference from Good to Fabulous and delicious!! Use 1/4 cup of Maraschino cherries Use only fresh pineapple. (must dry with paper towels very well.) In place of cinnamon use fresh ground nutmeg. Use 1 tsp of fresh grated vanilla bean. Use 3/4 cup of milk with a juice of one lemon to make buttered milk. Then at end of mixing add 2 more tablespoons of milk to thin the cake dough.

I also was disappointed. This was good, but it was more of a really thick bread than a cake. It wasn't sweet enough, and the texture was odd for cake. Thanks anyways....

It wasn't disgusting but it really wasn't good at all. I followed the recipe but took some of the advice from the reviews and added a little more sugar and put less butter on the bottom of the cake pan. The cake was pretty when it came out BUT it didnt have any flavor at all except for at the top where all the pineapple was. I was very sad that I spent time making this. :(

This was really good! Next time I will try adding some rum. Don't be scared off by complaints of too much cinnamon.... 1/2 tsp is hardly overpowering.

Rating: 3
This was good but relatively tame -- I don't know, but I like my PUDC a little fiercer than this. I also made changes that probably affected things: white sugar (yes, brown is fiercer), and nutmeg instead of cinnamon (which I couldn't locate) or cardamon (which I don't have). Next step: go to my brother-in-law, who makes a very good one.

the cake itself is very delicious. However if you're using canned pineapple do not use chunks, instead use rings. the chunks end up tearing the cake apart.

Whenever I am home (I'm a student) for the summer with my family, I bake a lot for my sweet-loving parents. I think this is the one cake I received the most praise for, and the one that disappeared the fastest. I did tweak this a little bit, reducing the sugar to 1/2 for both topping and the cake each, and adding a bit of rum (1 tbsp) to the topping which is key. I went a bit heavy handed with cinnamon and added a bit of clove since my family loves spices, and used unbleached, whole wheat flour with great results. This came out ultra fluffy and moist, and you could see the syrup traveling its way down the cake. I used very fresh, in-season pineapples.

I completely disagre with the negative review; my parents felt this was the best cake that they'd tasted from anyone in our family. The recipe is moist and not overly sweet (it is a little sweet). The cinnamon did not seem overpowering in the least. Overall this was a very tasty recipe; don't know what happened in the other case.

This cake was really easy and probably yummy but just wasn't my bag at all. Too sweet, cinnamon was overwhelming (and I even halved it!) cake was too soft and soggy. In short, YUK! The kids loved it though, which is testament to how sweet it was! The one my mom made for me as a kid has thick, dense vanilla cake with a very runny glaze over the pineapples and maraschino cherries. I need that recipe but she no long has it!

when the recipe says to dry the pineapple before placing them on the bottom, it means it. i didn;t and my pineapples where swimming in juice. tasty juice, but not acceptable.

It TASTED great. However, I have never made one of these before and the pan they tell you to use is not right. The pan was too small and the cake spilled over, A LOT. Next time I think I will try a fluted pan or a tube pan.

Nice and comforting. To the cook who had a runny cake when doubled: Lower your oven temp by 25 degrees and cook it, say, for around 20 minutes longer than directed, toothpick it and if still wet, continue on til dry.. Cover the cake with foil if it starts to look too brown. You can also use a bigger pan. Make more sugar and pineapple (which is always a bonus!) because there will be more bottom to cover. If the pan is wide, you should still lower the temp and cook longer. Good Luck!

This made an attractive cake. I used some dried apricots with the pineapples and it was flavorful. However, it was more like a breakfast cake, not too sweet. If you're looking for a rich & gooey cake, this is not it.

I tried to double recipe and the center was runny. Otherwise, it was good. I will try crushed pineapple next time.

I made this recipe using an 8" round cake pan and diced pineapples from a can and it turned out great! I baked it for 43 minutes and it came out very moist and dense. We had it with vanilla ice cream which just took it over the top! My husband loved it!

I think I'll stick to my old Better Homes and Garden red and white cookbook for this cake. Tasted greasy when warm. Will used chunks instead of rings from now on though.

I made this cake a couple of times and it was very good. I made it again today but did something different. Instead of pineapple, I used a large, drained can of fruit cocktail. It turned out to be better than using pineapple. Tryit! You'll like it!

This second time, I used a 9 x 9 square pan. It was much easier fitting the batter into it. I also added halved cherries in the glaze.

Based on what I have read in the past reviews, I made some changes. I doubled the cake recipe for the amount of topping and placed it in a 9x13 flat pan. For the topping, I put a little less butter and a little pineapple juice to cut down on the fat. The cake came out nice.

I made it last weekend for dinner party. It was a hit. Everyone loves it. I added lemon juice and rum. I also poured some rum on top of the pineapple when it's done. The only thing, I will use less brown suger and butter next time.

As I was testing cake, it slipped out of springform pan onto oven floor! Yikes, piled it back into pan, cooked mess 10 more min. What to do? Next day, I made the best trifle ever. Cut cake into bitesize pieces and lined a souffle dish, sprinkled with Grand Marnier, layered on Creme Anglaise, continued layering. Fabulous!!! My best mistake ever.

I had a request for this type of cake which I'd never made before. I was in a hurry and so I used canned pineapple slices and I skipped all the sifting on the cake ingredients. Just mixed everything together all at once. It was great and everybody loved it.

I'm not a big fan of pineapple upside-down cake but have friends who are so I've been on a quest for "the recipe". I think this is it. I substituted canned pineapple rings and put dried cranberries in the middle. I served it with Pineapple sorbet and it was a hit!

I made this cake with a yellow cake mix and added the juice from a can of pinapple chunks. I didn't dry the pinapple and I thought the topping was just right. The cake was a hit! I am making it again for a Christmas dinner. This recipe is definatly worth keeping!

I made this cake for a professed pineapple uside-down cake lover, and he claimed that it was the best one he'd ever tasted. I don't like pineapple desserts, and I gobbled up my share as well. Every one present had a second helping.

Rating: 2
Not the end product I was looking for. Agree with the other reviewers that said it was mushy and more like pineapple cobbler. The brown sugar layer was crystalline at first and then soggy the next day. Maybe it was because I baked in a springform pan (only 8 inch round pans in my cupboard) with foil on the outside to keep the butter from oozing out - but I doubt it!

my husband begged and begged for a pineapple upside down cake for his birthday--i chose this one because i had all the ingredients on hand, i'd never made this kind of cake before--we each had a piece last night, and when i woke up this morning, my husband had eaten the rest of the cake! really good--moist and tender, and i was suprised it didn't stick at all. super easy and quick with great results--highly recommend...

Sometimes simple is best. Made this for my father who LOVES pineapple upside down cake. It was gone in one day! This is a keeper.

Some people might say that this recipe wouldn't deserve much of a comment just because it's so "regular". However, it's really THE perfect pineapple upside down cake. I made it using muscovado for the brown sugar and took extra care to cut the pineapple into pretty little squares, then inverted it onto my best display platter - it's really quite beautiful. I think I'll make it again this Saturday for a July 4th potluck dinner...I'll have to make a second one because I can tell you, this one will be gone by then. :>)

WOW! What a cake! I love the way the spices in the cake played off the pineapple. It was more like a spice cake than the old standard white cake. It was by far one of the easier cakes to make. A hint though: I let the produce dept. peel and core the pineapple. It's free and saves time and mess. Yes I will make it again. In fact that's what I'm fixing to do now.

I would have never thought to use cinnamon but it was great! The whole family loved it. Had to use a 15 1/2 oz. can of pineapple chunks. We didn't completely dry the fruit but, the excess was blotted off. That can of chunks completely covered the bottom of an 8x8x3in. pan. Try this one! It was easy and incredible!

This cake was a big hit at a party I brought it to. We all really liked the cinnamon-flavored cake. To make what I think is a prettier presentation I used one whole fresh pineapple ring in the center, then half rings around it, filling in the spaces with more pieces of pineapple. I served it with a choice of vanilla or pineapple-coconut ice cream. Delicious!

we had a fresh pineapple from hawaii & this recipe was a great way to use it. i did not blot the pineapple b/c i wanted more juice, but it did make the cake a bit messy, so my presentation was a little weak. but overall, delicious!

The cake I made came out to be very average. The cake part itself tasted too much like flour and should have been sweeter. Also, more cinnamon would have been nice. I have made pineapple upside-down cake with a mix in the past and it came out so much better...just follow the recipe on the side of the box. Too bad, I was looking forwards to this!

My husband and our friend loved this dish! It was very simple and very elegant looking. I think that next time I will add some Craisins (by Ocean Spray) with the pineapple to give it a little more color! I will definately make this again!

We very much liked this recipe. I made it just as instructed and really loved the fresh pineapple (don't forget to pat dry). I like the idea of adding pecans and, especially, cherries so will try that next time around. Will add this one to the recipe box!

I've made this cake three times so far using canned pineapple. I prefer a gooey topping so I didn't pat dry the pineapple, I just drained it. I also like a denser cake, so I mixed the batter by hand. This is an easy, delicious cake.

I had not had pineapple upside down cake in many years (at least 15) so I made this, however being the short cut cook who has had more failed scratch cakes than you can imagine,I used the topping and then a yellow cake mix. I have seen much controvery over the use of mixes in other recipe comments(see the ones for the coconut cake from 4/2001 for some laughs) but I had this cake in the oven in < 10 minutes and only had one dirty bowl, 1 spatula and a pan. and very yummy.

My boyfriend loved it, Pineapple Upside Down Cake is his favorite. But when making this cake it is very important to make sure that you pat the pineapple dry.

What a hit! I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 oblong glass pan sprayed with Pam. I substituted 3 well-drained cans of crushed pinapple in exchange for the fresh pinapple called for in the recipe. Simply delicious. Next time, I will add a few pecans and maraschino cherries to the bottom before spreading batter. Worth keeping!

Pineapple Upside Down cake... one of the all time Greats of the 50's home made confections s...But you must have walnut/ pecan halves in the "topping" (really bottom) And bright red marachino in the sliced pinapple rings! That was the part I got to do as Mom's little helper...Then you had to use a CAST IRON frying pan, which I thought was a pretty odd thing...being 8 years old.. This recipe is very simple and I agree use the packaged white cake mix with adding the drained pineapple juice. Everyone loves this cake and always want more....This is great using pears,apricots and peaches, the variations are endless !!

I added fresh pineapple juice squeezed from pineapple blended in a blender. While this is a good idea for a box mix, when making the cake from scratch it curdles the milk--an oversight on my part. The bottom layer of the cake(closest to the pineapple layer) had the consistency of cheesecake. Co-workers liked it and it tasted good, but the texture was unappealing. Next time I won't mix the juice with the milk.

The cinnamon in this recipe gives the cake unexpected spice, a welcome change from the standard white sponge. A candied cherry or two would bring added pizzaz to an already delicious treat.
