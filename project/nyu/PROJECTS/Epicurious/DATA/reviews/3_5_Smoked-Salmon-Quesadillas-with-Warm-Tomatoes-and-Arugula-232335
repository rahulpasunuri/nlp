This was very, very good. Ended up using yellow tomatoes because we had a billion in the garden. The tomatoes really enhanced the dish in a way I hadn't expected. My only criticism is that using nova salmon for this recipe was pretty expensive in these tough times. Next time I will probably buy salmon from the fish counter and smoke it myself on the barbecue grill with some alder wood.

Oh, yum! I couldn't find arugula so skipped that. The only other change I made was I used vidalia onion rather than the red so I didn't have to soak it. Used a large frying pan rather than the griddle.

I made these for my family and I have to agree with some who said the salmon was way too salty. I purchased the nova salmon as well and it was unfortunatly far too salty:/ My family did althoughlove the arugula/onion/avocado/tomato topping it made the presentation very pretty and helped to balance the salty-ness. I tried it with smoked turkey and it was a lifetime better:)

Nice for a light lunch. The combination of cheeses and smoked salmon worked for me but my boyfriend thought it didn't go well as a quesadilla.

This was WAY too salty. I did use NOVA SALMON, but it was still too salty. I think I'll omit the salt on the tomatoes next time, and maybe a bit more cheese than the salmon.

This is a great appetizer or quick snack! I added capers inside the quesadillas. Yummy!

good dish...you'll want the goat cheese/cream cheese spread to the right consistency so it will spread evenly. I doubled the chives to give it a bit bolder flavor. Sauteeing the arugula/spinach with the tomatoes gave it a nice presentation.

Great entree. One quesadilla is sufficeinet per adult unless you're really hungry. We may have been able to eat 1-12.

This was incredible. Follow the recipe exactly and soak those onions. My family loved it, even my 16 year old.

I haven't tried this yet but will do so soon. I have a question as to why the onions are soaked in water. I've not heard of that before?

I've made this dish a few times. Its hard to find Arugala around here but I was lucky to once find an Arugula Spinach mix. The other times I used just spinach or another leafy green. When I make this as a breakfast/brunch item I don't make the salad. I've also topped it with a wilted spinach and tomato mixture and found it nice. Also, the goat cheese seems to be important. It doesn't taste or melt the same without it. My husband hates goat cheese but loves this dish. Its also good as a side item to eggs etc. OH and I've stopped using tortillas. I use pre-made crepes instead which is very good and maked it more elegant if you are serving company.

My husband loved this! I think on here it was made as a breakfast but I would classify it better as a light lunch. Very yummy indeed.

Fantastic summer dinner recipe - quick and easy to make and doesn't heat up the kitchen. We didn't cook the tomatoes either, and we doubled the (baby) arugula - making the topping more salad-like. We found brushing the quesadillas with oil to be unnecessary. I liked mine with an extra squeeze of lemon over the salad. We didn't have one chilled, but suspect that a rose would be nice with these. All in all, delicious!

Top Notch! Did not deviate from the recipe at all and would not suggest doing so. Good goat cheese is a must and I always use the best ingredients I can find, which seems to make a difference with any recipe. Love the salad atop the quesadilla, adds quite a bit to the presentation as well as the overall taste.

I made this for a late Saturday afternoon lunch. I used low carb tortillas and fat free cream cheese with the goat cheese and it melted just fine. I do not like warm, mushy tomatoes, so I omitted cooking the cherry tomatoes and just sliced some grape tomatoes (which are sweeter than cherry tomatoes) with the arugula, onion and avocado.
