This recipe looks wonderful in the picture and my end result looked as good. It was a fiddle to make and really tests your piping skills. I did not, however, like the cocoa in the meringues, they tasted powdery; and the cream of tartar made them too chewy, making the handles soften very quickly. I threw the cocoa meringues out and made the baskets again using a standard meringue recipe of 4 egg whites and 8oz caster sugar. 6 egg whites makes too much mixture for 8 baskets. Note that the recipe instructions are for 9 baskets and 10 handles, presumably to allow for breakages.
