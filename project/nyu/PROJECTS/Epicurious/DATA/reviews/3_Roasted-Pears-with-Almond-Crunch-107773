This was just "OK." I made the recipe exactly as is, and it was a little more labor-intensive than I would like - would have wanted to just stick the pears in the oven while my guests were eating and not think about it again. The almond crunch was tasty and actually light. I would really recommend spreading it in a thin, even layer for baking - parts where it was thicker came out chewy which just stuck to our teeth. But, the thin, crunchy parts were outstanding. What was most disappointing was the pear which really became flavorless in roasting. I served it with ice cream and think that was the only thing saving the flavor of the dish - would have preferred just the ice cream with the almond crunch! If I tried this again, I might add some vanilla and sprinkle with cinammon/nutmeg, perhaps.

Maybe I did something wrong but this was awful. Wish we'd just eaten the lovely bosc pears as is.

Easy and a perfect dessert after a heavy meal. I thought the nut crunch was just OK. Will use a different garnish next time.

Evidently there was something wrong with the ratings on my computer last night because they all said 2.5. I've seen way too many "I made it my way and it was horrible!" ratings. Apologies! :0) Made this recipe as is last night and it was delicious! It is great on its own and leaves room for your own creativity!

It drives me nuts when people completely change a recipe and then give it a "bad" rating. Which means you are rating your own recipe at that point and giving this one a bad name.

I made a modification of this recipe that simplified it a little. Instead of making the almond crunch, I just put sliced almonds on top at the end and baked for a few extra minutes. I also used vanilla essence instead of liquer and turbinado sugar (the same amount). It had just the right level of sweetness -- my guests loved it and lapped it up. Given how easy it was to make, I think it's a lovely dessert. I baked mine while we were eating dinner!

I did a much shortened version of this recipe. I skipped the ammaretto and the almond crunch and just served it with ice cream. It was simple and great. Delicious on its own.

Not worth the trouble in my book.

Not a fabulous dish, but enjoyable. The crunch topping was great though.
