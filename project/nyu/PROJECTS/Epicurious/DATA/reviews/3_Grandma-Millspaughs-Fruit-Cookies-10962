Based on the reviews here I thought this would be better. While they made a nice addition to my xmas cookie sampler, they were certainly not a stand out. They are very pretty with the currant in the center, and nice and thin, but it tastes like a raisin cookie, meh.

The recipe intro struck me as rather condescending when I read it back in 1993; I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to try it. Well, it's now a venerable family tradition at the Smith house as well. I make 10 to 15 different kinds of cookies every Christmas and ALWAYS include these.

The recipe introduction makes this cookie sound less interesting than it is! I just made it for the first time (discovered it when searching for a cookie recipe using buttermilk) and it definitely will be added to my Christmas and year-round cookie list. I love the dark color that comes from the brown sugar, ground spices and fruit. I made one change - used dried cherries instead of raisions, which added a zing to the flavor.

I have made these cookies several Christmases in a row now. They don't look too fancy but they are delicious. Kids and adults love them. A great cookie for year round.

A great thin spice cookie. Because the fruit is ground up it is very subtle for non raisin lovers. I used dried cranberries in place of currants along with the raisins and they worked out great.
