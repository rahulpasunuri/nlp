The key to this dish is the oyster mushrooms, sweet and beefy, you don't really need the shrimp. But,I first caramelized onions, then added the garlic & mushrooms+celery salt, oregano, thyme and basil. Once the mushrooms cooked down I added the shrimp to cook through, then the peppers and about 1/3 cup sweet vermouth. I finished it with a dash of worchester and served it on rice. Expect to make it again without the shrimp and serve on pasta We practically licked the pot.

I used frozen shrimp, and dried red pepper flakes instead of fresh. Also I layered it all on top of quinoa cooked with diluted vegetable broth. It was fast, easy, looked lovely and tasted delicious. I will absolutely make this again!

Just okay. The shrimp were good on their own, the peppers were good on their own, but the sum of the parts just didn't do it for us. Served at a dinner party and there was plenty left.

Made this dish in a wok, it was too hot so it robbed us of all our garlic flavor. Simple and easy to make, roasted red peppers are yum! We added some more veggies as well, don't over cook the shrimp!

After making this dish the first time as written as an appetizer and really enjoying it, I decided to try it all mixed together as an entree. Wow, it's delicious! I sauteed the mushrooms first and set them aside, then sauteed the mushrooms w/the garlic & chilis as directed, then added the mushrooms back in along with the chopped roasted peppers, heated it through and served it over rice. It makes an outstanding entree.

I made this as an appetizer at a formal dinner, based on all the rave reviews but I shall not make it again. The expensive ingredients, no matter how carefully prepared, don't blend into a well-rounded texture and taste experience. There are many other epicurious recipes that will give you more bang for your effort!

Very easy and Very elegant. I make this for an appetizer for every occasion I go to. People ask for the recipe all the time. I substitute Portabella mushrooms for the oyster one.

Very tasty and lovely presentation. The recipe doesn't suggest slicing the oyster mushrooms. I did. ??

The recipe was amazing. I cheated a little and added aromat spice to the mushrooms. But the guests were amazed and so was I.

This is a terrific way to present shrimp; we used giant ones. Had to substitute button mushrooms as that's what was on hand, but will try later with oyster mushrooms.
