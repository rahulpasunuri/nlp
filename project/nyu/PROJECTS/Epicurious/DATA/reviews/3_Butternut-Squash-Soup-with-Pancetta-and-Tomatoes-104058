I agree with other reviewers...make it as is, except maybe reduce the cornmeal by half and whisk in a little at time. I think if this was called a "country stew," people probably would not taken so many issues with it.

Omitted the cornmeal and added more tomatoes. Didn't puree but left it chunky. My family loved it!

I have made this recipe for years. The first time I made it as written and while it tasted all right, the soup appeared unappetizing and had a bad mouthy feel. I pureed the soup after that and the soup appears as bisque and tastes awesome. I have served the soup at thanksgiving and dinner parties and the majority of people loved it. I have tried many butternut squash soup recipes and this is the best so far.

I have to say that this is the worst recipe I have ever gotten from Epicurious and I've prepared many from here. This soup's flavors never blended and the odd taste and gummy consistency turned my husband and me off so much that we did NOT even eat it (and we never waste food). It actually turned my stomach (I prepared it as written with no changes). I want to save someone else from wasting good ingredients and spending so much time chopping and peeling. There are much better recipes here than this one. Avoid this awful soup!

Pretty good -- didn't quite like the taste of it. It's thick and filling -- good for winter.

I have made this soup several times. It is delicious. It is important to whisk the cornmeal in gradually so it doesn't become lumpy. I also add a little more red pepper for a little extra bite. Yummy!

This is a pretty nice soup. And contrary to the previous comments I don't think it should be "improved" by pureeing it. If you must, at least don't add cornmeal, what's the point of adding thickening agent if you are going to puree everything. Secondly, salt pork is not a good substitution. If you need to substitute pancetta, use bacon, which is smoked (and has very distinct flavor like pancetta). Even ham would be a better substitution, I think. Don't skip sautéing squash, baking it will not have the same effect. The point is to get the sweetness/sugar out thru the process. The 30 min. cooking combines the flavors that were brought out in the sauté. I added carrot and celery, because I like colors in my food. I didn't have pancetta and substituted Hungarian bacon, which in turn made me substitute hot Hungarian paprika for red pepper. Since it is winter, I added dry oregano instead of fresh. It came out very nice. No cream needed, by the way.

This soup was so-so. There have got to be better butternut squash soup recipes, though, so I wouldn't bother making it again.

I thought this dish was terrific. Leftovers (there wasn't much; I cut the recipe in half) made a great lunch the next day. A couple of co-workers, always interested in my brought-from-home lunches, sampled it and found it very much to their liking. I didn't even have any pancetta on hand and used some salt pork that was leftover from the holidays. I can't wait to try it with pancetta!

I made a batch, pureed it and gave it to friends. Served with a dollop of sour cream or yoghurt, it was delicious. Two tips -- bake the squash first and puree. Easy to make, freezes well

Why there were not instructions to puree this soup is a mystery to me---while adding the cornmeal, I determined that the chunks of squash, bacon, tomato all seemed way too unappealing in look and also "mouth feel"--so I pureed all but one cup in my Cuisinart. The results were excellent! Friends I served this to, and my husband, raved about this soup. PUREE!!

Although the flavor was very nice in this soup, the texture was unappealing because of the cornmeal -- I would possibly try it again without the cornmeal - but with so many other things to cook, I would move on!
