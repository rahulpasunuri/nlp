Just made for 3rd time. It's a great recipe and freezes well too. Freeze uncooked filled crepes. Thaw overnight in frig. Heat 400F about 10 min til hot.

This was delicious. I did find that the batter was a bit too thick, so I added more chicken broth. Also put in less than half of the chili powder (all I had was extra hot) and left the chillies out altogether, as I had a sensitive palate over for dinner; instead I added a couple teaspoons of cumin and some paprika, and upped the lime juice in the filling. YUM!

Hubs & I really liked this. The crepes were a cross between a crepe & a corn tortilla, and the filling was delicious. Made a full recipe crepes (14 crepes in a 7" pan) and a half recipe filling (filled 10 crepes). Served with salsa as suggested by other reviewers (thanks! - I rely heavily on reviews). Will definitely make again. Am going to try to freeze leftovers. Served with Mexican Rice and orange-radicchio-Vidalia onion salad.

this recipe turned out great! made it for a birthday dinner and everyone was impressed. Made a few modidications, instead of jalpapeno chillies I used green chillies. To make it a little lighter and healthier I used 1/2 sour cream the recipe called for and half yogurt.

This is an excellent recipe which I have made for years. It is attractive enough for entertaining yet easy enough for a week day meal. I highly recommend it.

I also added some frozen sweet corn to the filling and then grated some cheddar cheese on the top of the crepes. The crepes are a lot easier to make if you have an electric crepe machine.

Delicious! Definitely a keeper.

Be careful when cooking the crepes. They cook as soon as you pour the batter in the pan (I messed up a few). I shredded the chicken (v. dicing) it, and would recommend shredding it. Didn't like it well enough to make again. My husband called it very "country clubby".

These were awesome! Not too terribly hard. I halved the recipe and had just enough to make 7 crepes, which was the perfect amount for my husband and me. I had a bunch of leftover filling, though, and I think it'll make great sandwiches for lunch tomorrow!

I loved this recipe. I forgot to get scallions so I left them out, but was really pleased with the dish anyway. I agree with Jennifer from Oregon- less mayonnaise and light sour cream worked just fine. I shredded the chicken after I cooked it and added extra peppers. I will make this again and again.

A big hit among my friends. Even my baby brother can make it! I made it a second time with a little sauteed serrano peppers and some extra lime, which gave it a nice extra kick.

The crepes make it worth the 3 forks. A good weekday meal.

Made this the other nite and was a hit. I made the batter for the crepes and cooked several before deciding to try another recipe. They were more like corn tortillas and didn't care for the texture. Instead, I made a regular crepe batter and added chili powder. I made the filling the day before. Served with all the condiments and tomatillo salsa. Very fresh. Could possibly grate a Mexican cheese over the top. Very tasty

I made this for a group of friends and they loved it. *Very* tasty. I substituted light sour cream, and I think it would be safe to add less mayonnaisse too. You're supposed to let the crepe batter sit for an hour, but I only let it sit for about 35 minutes and it was fine. It made 11 crepes - not much room for error.

Very good. Made guacomole and served with store bought picante sauce
