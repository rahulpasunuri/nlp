I was interested in this recipe, because I had all the ingredients on hand, but what persuaded me to make the dish was that the reviews indicated that many additions could be added. Thus I concluded it would be a good base recipe to clean out my fridge, and it was. However, I must admit it probably no longer resembled the original dish. Since I two lbs of lamb I double the recipe. Since I only had 6 oz of shiitakes I substituted the other 6 oz of mushrooms with carrots, a little celery, and 1 oz of dried mushrooms, reconstituted. I then added only 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 cup of port instead of wine, the 1.5 cups of water used to reconstituting the dried mushrooms, and two beef bullion cube. Towards the end, I felt it was still bland, so I added some fresh thyme, a little crushed red pepper, and more garlic. I was debating about adding the kalamata olives since that would require opening a can, but I decided the dish needed more depth, so I add a 1/2 cup of Trader's Joes Olive Tapenade and it added the earthy depth it needed. My fridge is cleaned of this and that and I am a unique "lamb stew" which was tasty and flavorful.

Savory, delicious, easy to make. Sophisticated yet kid-friendly. The only disappointment was that I did not really taste the shiitake, but maybe I needed to use more. I used more lamb than the recipe calls for--make a bunch and eat it for three nights! I love braising in a clay pot. and I let the meat sit in the liquid for several hours to cool in the clay pot before refrigerating.

I thought this was DELICIOUS! I used dried mushrooms (reconstituted in boiling water) instead of fresh, and I just left the shoulder chops whole instead of bothering to bone them. I didn't have chianti or sangria, so I used a cheap supermarket Port. And I simply forgot the olives, which I would have added if I had remembered. But anyway it was DELICIOUS. The meat just fell off the bone, so I'm glad I didn't bother boning it to begin with, plus I think the bones gave it extra flavor. I made it ahead and had it, reheated, a few days later. It was DELICIOUS. I can't wait to have the leftovers!

I think this would have been better without the orange peel--it ended up a little bitter

Made it without the olives and it was great. Fed 2 with leftovers - no WAY it can feed 4. Orzo worked well.

This is a great lamb stew - even my 3 year old loves it. The favors are bold and work well together. We double the recipe so we can have a healthy amount of leftovers and serve with polenta instead of the orzo.

Any stew with wine (red or white) and tomatoes is really hard to screw up. The orange peel was a nice touch and to make this stew heartier I added some lentils which went great.

This was amazing. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated. Didn't substitute anything. I was slightly surprised that the recipe didn't call for more spices, so I chose to add chili pepper flakes, herbes de provence, and two bay leaves for added punch. Came out awesome.

This stew is currently simmering as I type this review. This is the 6th year in a row I've made this, now family favourite, dish in the week between Christmas and New Year's. It has become an annual tradition that is specifically asked for. We add more olives and cut the stew over more orzo than is called for.

This is the most amazing lamb stew I have ever had. The rich broth of the meat, onion, and the hint of orange made it very complex and at the same time very comforting. The mushroom choice was exceptional as it provided a smokey balance to the lamb. I would say this is restaurant quality of the highest degree.

I really hated this dish. It should have been wonderful -- good flavors, good lamb. The only thing I could taste was the orange peel. Really not good. My husband is trying to be constructive -- less orange, some lamb stock, more other flavors. I would just start with another recipe.

Has replaced the Spring Lamb Stew from this site as our lamb stew of choice. The flavors are super together. I also flour the lamb before browning it and serve it over polenta instead of orzo - excellent! Even our picky toddler loves it.

This dish was delicious! However, I think next time I would use a microplane to zest 2 navel oranges instead of using 2 3 x 1/2 inch strips of zest, to impart more of an orange flavor! Great for weeknights- will make it again-may try pork or chicken next time!

Incredibly rich and delicious. Super easy too. Great dish for budget conscious people trying to impress at a dinner party. I added a few veg. (carrots, celery, parsnips) for color, texture, and health.

This was delicious...and a nice break from the usual lamb stew recipes -- ie: potatoes and carrots. And I raise my own lamb, so I've been through a lot of lamb recipes. The sauce thickened a bit too much for me so I added a bit more wine. My husband was wild about it too. However, I could see that some folks could be frightened by the strong flavors.

I made this dish with a leg of lamb, (less fat)cut up by the butcher, and extra merlot (didn't have chianti) and let it cook a little longer, which probably helps with the "gamey" flavor. After fishing out the bones (great flavor), I served it over coucous with a salad and everyone loved it, kids included. 3&1/2 forks!

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavor. We loved the gentle hint of orange - a nice complement to a strong meat. This was an instant hit in our house and we won't wait for "cold" weather to make it again. Plus it's simple to make.

I love lamb and followed this recipe to the letter, but I'm afraid my review is less stellar than the others here. The dish smelled amazing during cooking, but the end product had an overwhelmingly intense (albeit nicely complex with the garlic, orange, and wine) flavor. I noticed the dish was a bit gamey-tasting, so it could have been the lamb, or maybe it was the Kalamata olives (large ones from Trader Joe's) that overwhelmed the dish. I was expecting knock-your-socks off amazing, and while it was still good, it was too strong-tasting for me and my guests to make me want to make it again (and I *never* shy away from flavorful dishes!).

This is a flavorful and hearty lamb stew. I liked the combo of olives, orange and rosemary, not overpowering at all. Wonder if the folks who thought it had too much orange maybe used more zest than called for, or included some pith? Anyway, I did add some zuchinni chunks and chopped red bell peppers in the last 15 minutes for that fresh vegetable crunch and color boost. Served it with polenta, as per another reviewer, and that was a yummy choice.

I thought this recipe was wonderful! The orange zest, rosemary and olives are a nice combination. Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! The only change I made was to use shallots instead of the onion. I loved the orange and olive flavors.

I had a butcher trim and cube the lamb shoulder for me...so that part was simple. The sauce did come out quite thin - so I might try flouring the lamb next time before browning. The stew was prepared the night before and warmed for guests the next night - which really allowed the flavors to develop.

I would rate this dish somewhere between the 2.5 and 3 stars. I made the stew for guests over the weekend useing lamb shoulder chops and doubling the ingredients. I found cleaning and trimming the meat to be somewhat time intensive, so I was happy I was making this the night before serving. Based on a couple of other reviewers comments, I dredged the meat in flour before browning. While it was good when I served it the next evening, I found the flavor brighter and more interesting when I sampled it immediately after it was first cooked. My husband and I had leftovers last night that I warmed (uncovered) in a clay casserole dish in the oven and that was an improvement. Still, my recommendation would be to do the chopping and ingredient preparation in advance, but serve it when first prepared.

This was a fabulous dish with pasta, but couldn't really stand alone for me. I like to cut my stews with a knife, to use it like a fish sauce. This had a bit too light of a taste even with extra simmering. Anyone in love with this stew should check out the Mahogany Beef Stew with Hoisen sauce on this site (and halve the hoisen!). A much meatier, deeper taste to that one, and most of the same ingredients. Still, a decent stew for a large meal.

I actually have not cooked this yet - a friend made this for us last night and I just couldn't get enough. It was really incredible. The flavor of orange subtle yet adding depth as well. It was served over polenta instead of orzo, which was a perfect combo. We liked it so much we are making it for ourselves tomorrow!

I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover leg of lamb and this was perfect! Instead of rosemary, I used Italian spices and extra garlic of course, then served it over pasta with a little parmesan cheese. It's a keeper

Rating: 4
I loved it. I added flour to the meat when I browned it so there would be a thicker sauce. I also doubled it (because of other reviews) and used "lamb stew meat" already cut into chunks. So easy and great for freezing. The orange peel and kalamata olives makes it "cheater stew" - high flavor without a million ingredients and four hours of simmering.

Don't understand how some would rate this as a dish beyond compare but it is good. Won't go the shoulder chop route next time. Way too much work! And yes, double it for four.

This is one of our favorites. I use plain mushrooms because of availability. It's also fun to finish the bottle of Chianti while preparing the stew!

Rating: 3
Don't get me wrong, this was very tasty, but based on the reviews, I thought it was going to blow me away. It didn't. I'll try it again, perhaps adding more salt or marinating the lamb a bit before. I found it a teensy bit bland.

Rating: 4
Just wonderful! Used the same amount of orange peel that the receipe calls for and no one found it overpowering. Personal taste. Added peas for some color contrast.

Rating: 3
Great - especially for a healthy dish. I would recommned only one change - to use half of the orange peel called for - the note of orange was a a tiny bit too strong. Other than that - it is one of our new favorites!

Rating: 3
This was really a great winter supper--easy to put together (one day in advance) and a great mix of flavors. Certainly agree with those who have said that the receipe portions are a little off---made this for two of us and had probably a third protion left. Would double it the next time to insure leftovers to be frozen

I agree with all of the other reviewers. This dish was so easy to make, and my husband LOVED it. I have him give every recipe a letter grade, and he gave this one an A. An instant classic which I will incorporate in the repertoire!

Absolutely delicious. We cooked this for a finicky gourmand and he ended up having thirds. Completely agree with the note on serving size below - we made a double batch as a main dish and finished it with four people. Will try the same recipe with beef tonight!

Absolutely great! Beware, it really only serves 2, 3 at the most, adults. I didn't have chianti and used another light red wine and it was still great.

This dish rocks! Absolutely delicious. I recommend making extra and freezing...you won't be disappointed the second time around.

This is delicious and quite easy to prepare. I used portabellos because the shiitakes were too costly- tasted great. I might try a different pasta next time-orzo was fine but didn't knock my socks off.

This basic recipe is so full of flavor that my partner and I couldn't get enough of it. From the smell in the kitchen to our last bites, all we could talk about was how wonderful and easy this dish was to make. It also has the potential to be altered many different ways. Different mushrooms...different meat...different olives. This dish has become a staple in our household.
