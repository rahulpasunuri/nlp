This is my go-to chicken soup recipe. I make it as written every time and it comes out great every time.

Very flavorful soup; in the future I would omit the sweet potato in the broth preparation as I found a little too sweet. But otherwise a lovely and classic interpretation of chicken soup that's highly satisfying!

This is a fantastic chicken soup!! Better than my mom's and both my kids love it. One tip - and I'm serious - put the whole onion (skin and all) into the soup. It will add more flavor and a deeper color. We make this all winter long.

Delicious for a cold winter day. I made it for company and everyone raved about it. After skimming off the fat, I added fresh sage, rosemary & thyme (tied in a cheesecloth) and reheated the broth. Avoid using more egg noodles than the recipe calls for. They'll soak up a lot of broth overnight.

This makes the best chicken stock I've ever had, which is the key to good soup. If it's "boring" to you, then chop up some additional veggies to throw in. I'll also add that I make my own egg noodles to throw in. The whole family loves it and eat it til it's gone.

Boring, not much substance to this one. I've had better.

This is a classic Jewish chicken soup recipe, and will compete with the best any Bubbe can prepare. I added parsley in the last half hour of cooking and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.
