This is so quick and easy to make! I didn't have serrano chile, so I used the normal green chillies (2 nos) and it turned out great. Delicious and healthy. I used this as a dip for nachos and it worked perfectly.

I have tried so many dip recipes and been disappointed. This one was not only super healthy (I even used nonfat Greek yogurt, with no ill effect), it was also insanely tasty. I used cumin instead of caraway, although next time I may try it as written. Warning: this is not for people who don't like hot food-- if I were going to serve it at a party, I'd probably use only half the serrano. But mmmmmmmmm... What a GREAT way to get a serving of veggies and a load of protein!

Excellent! A happy change from the usual dips - packed with spices and flavors.

This is a fantastic spicy dip that could have many uses as a sauce or topping or spread. It is decidedly spicy, but I think that's a good thing! This dip is going in my permanent collection, and for once I can't think of any modifications that would make it better.

Incredibly simple to make and packs a lot of flavor. I love cilantro so it's perfect for me and I really like that it's yogurt based. I plan to seve this at parties during the summer months.
