1 TABLESPOON oregano? Might as well change the name of this recipe to Roasted Oregano. You won't be able to taste anything else!

I once had a wonderful recipe for oven roasted root vegetables which was a real winner. I'm tyring to recover that recipe.

450 degrees is simply too hot for these veggies. My ovens are set at the correct temps, so that is not the problem. I had to throw out the potatoes and carrots as they were nearly hollow from overcooking, and BLACK! The asparagus was beyond any flavor. Charred is NOT a flavor in my cookbook. I'll look for another recipe on this site. Forget this one....

Excellent! This was very flavorful, and easy to make. However, I did pull my vegetables out of the oven after the recommended roasting time, switch my oven to high broil, and returned them under the hot broiler for five minutes to char. I have a gas oven, which heats up very quickly, however. This might be impractical with an electric oven.

colorful, easy to prepare, tasty. I also used leeks and omitted the turnips. The garlic was great with the bread that we served. I will make this recipe again.

Not sure that I would make it again. Perhaps my oven isn't hot enough but the vegetables were not done in 35 minutes and still were not completely done in one hour. Perhaps would have more flavor if I was able to get them "charred".

The idea of roasting the vegetables in the oil/vinegar/herb mixture is wonderful because you can almost use any vegetable you want (brocoli & cauliflower flowerets turn out great!). And whenever I feel like having french fries I just make roasted potatoes. The recipe is really tasty.
