Loved this recipe but like a lot of others, I made a few tweaks. I omitted the red peppers, heavy cream and water. I added 2 cups of chicken stock instead of 1; 6 cloves of garlic, garlic salt and a bit of sea salt, 1/2 Dogfish Head pumpkin beer and a dollop of sour cream. I mixed the penne into the sauce along with about 2 cups of spinach. I transferred to a baking dish, added Parmesan and baked for about 10 minutes. I sprinkled again with more Parmesan to get a nice crust on the top and popped it back into the oven for another 3 minutes or so. I will absolutely make this dish again!

I realized something tonight. Epicurious is my first choice for a recipe website. I've always thought it was because of the quality and dependability of the recipes. But I've realized tonight I rely heavily on the reviews of the excellent cooks on this site. It's the reviews that help--after all, who wants to spend a lot of money and time on a recipe that produces a dish no one in the house will eat? I read a couple of pages of reviews and got the idea that this recipe as written is pretty tasteless. I figured out I could either go spicy (peppers), savory (garlic, onions), rich (cream), or tasting like pumpkin pie (cinnamon and nutmeg). I don't tolerate tomatoes any more and we miss spaghetti sauce, so I thought I'd see if I could do this savory. We loved it! I checked out another website and decided to add chicken sausage (because I had some in the freezer). Otherwise, I followed the recipe with these changes/additions: I used an entire garlic bulb, not a few cloves; 1 cup canned pumpkin no cream, (but I added a dollop of sour cream); no nutmeg; a dash of paprika; a splash each of lemon juice and orange juice; about half a cup white wine; bay leaf; sage; we garnished with plenty of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and pumpkin seeds.

This is a great base recipe that definitely needs tweaking. I kept mine vegan by substituting veg. broth and leaving out the cheese & cream. Added cracked red pepper while softening the veggies & a pinch of good sea salt. While all ingredients were simmering I added about 1/2 tsp smoked paprika and a bay leaf. Added about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg & was out of penne so used whole wheat spaghetti instead. Didn't add the reserved pasta water. This dish came out incredible & even the skeptics were impressed.

My whole family loved this. It was the first time that I've ever tried to make a savory pumpkin dish. I was very pleased with the results.

This is a TERRIBLE recipe, even for a pumpkin-lover like me. It is completely bland, and yet also vaguely unappetizing. Just awful. Do not be tempted to try it just because it's fall, you love squash, etc. I threw it away.

Husband ate this under protest but came back for seconds. I altered the recipe somewhat. Substituted one mild jalapeno pepper for the bell pepper, used freshly roasted pumpkin rather then tinned, skipped the cream altogether, substituted a bit of fresh thyme leaves for the parsley and added plenty of freshly ground black pepper and two dried kashmiri peppers. Next time I won't add quite so much heat but otherwise I'll stick to my changes.

Blah. It tasted NOTHING like pumpkin, despite the fact that I used a lot more than was recommended. Mine was really thick and creamy (obviously due to the extra pumpkin), so it had that nice quality without the extra fat.

Rating: 3
This recipe was good, but it needed a little extra punch of flavor and thickness. I used roasted red peppers instead of fresh red bell pepper and I added chopped sage, cayenne pepper, fresh lemon juice and a little cream cheese to thicken the sauce and add flavor. I served this over whole wheat pasta with sauteed shrimp and it was delicious!

Like many out there, I made a few changes - but that's what cooking is about! Wasn't sure what a 'bell' pepper was so used capsicum peppers, which made it quite chunky, to compliment the smoothness of the pumpkin (which I cooked in 8 minutes in the microwave while everything else was cooking). I reduced the amount of liquid and changed the cream for fromage frais (fat-less) and used wholewheat pasta. Thought it a little colourless, so added 1/2 a tin of sweetcorn, and next time will use a mixture of red and green pepper. The taste was lovely, with parmesan and plenty of spiced ground pepper, served with a crispy green salad and crunchy wholewheat homemade bread. Thankyou.

I made a few changes... no water, just broth and added some parmesan... the pepper I thought was overpowering and not the earthy taste I was hoping for. Don't waste your time... there are plently of other good ones out there

I would make it again based on the modifications i had to make. I had to cook it down for a while. It was pumpkin soup at first. I add some arrowroot to thicken it. I also added some white wine while it was cooking and a hint of maple syrup---for a little more flavor. You almost have to cook it down just to make it more floavorful. Was delicious even while on the liquidy side. Serve with lots of Grated Parmesan!

I found this dish to be quite delicious though i had to make a couple of changes: Because i love garlic, i added a bunch of garlic instead, and replaced the parmesan cheese with Pecorino Romano which made a big difference with the taste. I also replaced the Penne with Pachieri pasta which i think made the dish even more delicous! This dish is best served with the canned pumpkin. I love it.

Blah! What a utterly boring dish. It was watery, tasteless, and got four thumbs down from the family. Sorry.

I dont like garlic or onions. So I didnt bother with the pepper either to save me a step. After it was cooked, we added sour cream to make it a thicker sauce. It was really good. It tastes even better the next day!

I found the overall flavor rather unusual. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. It was just strange. But what really made it a 1 fork was that I thought it looked a unappetizing with the chunks of onions and red peppers in the sauce. I receommend the other sauce using pumpkin (with mascarpone) on this site. Oh, and I also used fresh pumpkin (like Australia, solid pack is hard to find here).

I love this dish! I add extra garlic and a little orange juice. I serve is with seared sea scallops over cheese tortellini. Sounds strange, but very yummy.

This dish is very similar to one I grew up on. A family favorite in the fall. The problem is with trying to do this with a pumpkin. I think the effort would be better placed with another type of squash. I did make this recipe with fresh pumpkin. Sauted garlic and red pepper, added nutmeg and cinnamon and even a pinch of sugar. Added more chicken broth than was called for because it was so thick. Still I was dissapointed.

Very disappointing. Tried the ricotta suggestion--still very bland & bordering on yucky.

Rating: 1
I was worried that this recipe would be bland -- based on comments of others. So, I added more onion, more garlic, and a dash of ground red pepper. The dish was spicy enough, but it still wasn't very good. It still felt like something was missing. I've made delicious pumpkin soup before, and was hoping this recipe would have a similar flavor. I was very disappointed with the results.

I love this recipe!! Nobody in my house will normally eat anything unusual, but this recipe is a favorite for everyone. Even my 16 year old brother! This will be my third time making it.

I found this kind of bland, so I added 1/2 cup of ricotta and it came alive! I also substituted roasted red pepper from jar and it worked great. This dish tasted even better reheated the next day.

This is a terrific recipe.As i had never heard of solid pack pumpkin in Australia (what the hell is it?), i just chopped up normal butternut really small and cooked it with the onions. This is a really simple but effective recipe, the nutmeg shines through, maybe its the fresh pumpkin that makes it good.

I went into making this dish with the knowledge that I would probably experiment to enhance the flavor....So, I decided to add white wine (about 1/2 cup) and extra cream (about 6-8 tbsp) and reduce some of the broth. I also doubled to recipe to accomodate a full pound of pasta and added scallops. It was wonderful - with an earthy flavor. Top it off with roasted pistachios (just a sprinkle). My husband and I are going to try this again with homemade pasta. Definitely a keeper!

Interesting versatile recepie, I played around with this one a lot - used a variety of veggies in the house, but it definitely is a a great recepie to use up leftover canned pumpkin.

This recipe sounds interesting on paper, but doesn't deliver. It's just too bland.

So-so. Nice for something a touch different. My boyfriend loved it but perhaps partly because he didn't cook it! Will try again because the other reviewers seemed to do a better job. Go easy on the onion is my suggestion. Perhaps a home-made or specialty chiken broth would've made the difference.

I tried this one with an open mind. I didn't use the cream and added pumpkin pie spice. This came out much better than I would have thought. I will definitely make this again and have recommeded the recipe.

This is such an easy dish to make and it was delicious although it didn't really have any pumpkin taste even though I added extra pumpkin. Maybe because I didn't add the nutmeg. But the red peppers, onion and garlic gave it some wonderful flavor.

This dish was delicious, an absolute keeper. I added extra garlic and some Cajun spices and it turned out great....I would recommend this dish to anyone looking for something different.

The texture of the sauce was great, but we found it lacked something. I even tried the suggestions of extra nutmeg and cinnamon, but it was still bland. I probably won't make this one again.

This was fantastic! I added more garlic and skipped the nutmeg. I also used fat-free half/half with no problems. I broiled some shrimp seasoned with cajun spices and added them to the sauce right before adding the pasta. The result was rich and slightly spicy. No one guessed that it was pumpkin. A definite addition to my recipe box.

I tried this to use some canned pumpkin that I had, and found the dish rather blah. I didn't have nutmeg on hand, so perhaps that's the kicker that makes it so good for everyone else. We found it edible but weren't particularly impressed.

Loved this recipe. Substituted fresh pumpkin that has been peeled, seeded, tossed in a little oil, baked, and mashed as well as cinnamon (1/4 teaspoon) for the nutmeg. The flavors and colors blend really nicely. Recommend this recipe to anyone in search of a unique way with pasta.

Excellent, as the "pumpkin" flavor does not predominate...added 3/4 teaspoon of dried nutmeg and a dash of tarragon to the sauce, which made good accents.

Very unique. The texture of the sauce is lovely. This dish has a very earthy flavor that is not easily identifiable as pumpkin. Well worth making.

Great harvest flavors, and fairly simple to make. I used lowfat milk just because I didn't have any cream, and it turned out fine. I would make this for company with a salad of spinach or arugula with a sharp vinagrette and a creamy dessert like mousse or cheesecake.

Yum! If using fresh cooked pumpkin, puree sauce before tossing with pasta.

This was a great side dish for Fall. I served it with grilled ahi tuna (because I had some in the freezer) but it would work well with grilled turkey/apple sausage, grilled pork loin, or grilled chicken. The salt and pepper balance out the sweetness of the pumpkin.
