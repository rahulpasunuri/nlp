This was delicious! I used red lettuce and everyone ate it all up! Otherwise I made it as written.

Nice salad dressing. I used the ingredients as listed but put them all together in a mini-food processor. Resulted in a very easy-to make, tasty, creamy dressing. Good over spinach.

It's always great when something that tastes wonderful is healthy and low-cal. Made this salad two weeks ago and am making it again for guests tomorrow. Didn't change a thing....excellent.
