Just to clarify something from the "cook from San Francisco's" review - empanada dough is not the same thing as puff pastry. While puff pastry is a fine substitute if you can't find empanada wrappers, it does change the recipe. Empanada dough is a denser dough that is sometimes made with masa harina. Puff pastry is a classic french dough made with large quantities of butter using a very specific and time-intensive method. If prepared properly, it is very light,flaky, and buttery. If you can find empanada dough, use it, because it conveys the cultural aspects of the dish better.

This was a very nice change to my normal sunday morning breakfasts. We got lots of snow this weekend so this was a nice comfort food for a morning to sit in pajamas and read the papers. I used different fillings, (sauteed shallots, peppers and sausage) for variarion. Next time I will use a pastry brush to paint the outsides so that they come out a deeper golden brown. Nice recipe!

this is an amazing recipe concept! i modified the recipe a lot to make it not so heavy: instead of empanada (i.e. puff pastry) dough, i used sheets of phyllo. made these for brunch, and made each pastry quite small -- about ~0.75 egg in each one. Version one had chopped proscuitto and jarlsberg. Version two had diced tomatoes, avocados, and fresh mozarella. the next day i made a third version, just with egg and vegan [tofu] sausage. VERY easy and everyone loved them. might also be excellent picnic fare -- "pastry wrapped frittata".

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I used turnover dough and it was quite sticky so I recommend that you use flour when rolling it out. Just be careful when filling and be sure not to overfill...you should try this just one and you will love it!
