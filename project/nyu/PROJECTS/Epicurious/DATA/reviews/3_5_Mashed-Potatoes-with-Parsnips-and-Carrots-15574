It was good and I appreciated the use of more veggies, but I thought the carrots tasted too raw - the earthiness colored each bite for me, but that could be because I prefer carrots cooked. I used 2% and it was fine, but next time I will put carrots in 5-10 min. sooner and substitute the milk with either a little skim or broth.

Nice alternative to plain mashed potatoes. The parsnip gives the dish a sweet flavor and the carrots add color. I did not use as much butter the recipe called for. Chicken broth for liquid adds flavor without fat.

i've made a similar dish, with the addition of some onion and garlic, a number of times. most people love it, even the children! the parsnips impart a naturally sweet taste. it's a great way to pack a variety of nutrients into something a basic as mashed potatoes.
