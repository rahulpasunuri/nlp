This was the favorite at my recent easter gathering. Couldn't get enough of this. I did make a few changes. Instead of Balsamic, I used Fig Balsamic for the caramelized walnuts and also used raw coconut sugar. Worked out just fine and was lower in glysemic value. For the reduction, I used 1/2 regular balsamic and 1/2 fig. YUMMMMM. I'm going to make one of these just for me for a treat@

Love this combination... I did not have Manchego so I used Gouda and cut it in small matchstick pieces. I used Honeycrisp apples and also used only half the shallots. I cut down on the oil (it seemed like too much) and added a dab of Dijon mustard to the dressing. This is a keeper!!!

i made this with a seafood paella and it was absolutely the star of the meal! will make again for sure. and the more manchego the better in my book.

This salad was delicious. My husband doesn't like balsamic, but loved this salad. Arugula can often overpower in a lot of places, but this salad has really great balance. The dates were exceptional...I used Medjool. The first time I made it I didn't feel like making the balsamic walnuts so I just toasted them and it was great. I am going to make it again this weekend and the balsamic walnuts just came out of the oven and smell amazing!!! Don't pass this salad by....try it you'll love it!

This salad is amazing! By julienning the apples, the flavors really mix well together. The balsamic reduction was so rich, but not overwhelming. The candied walnuts off-set the acidity of the vinaigrette and were delicious. I used white wine vinegar (reduced the amount a bit as I don't normally like a lot of dressing as it often drowns out the tastes of the other ingredients. I also finely diced a half a shallot which I thought was plenty and I absolutely loved, loved, loved the dates in this recipe! I will most certainly be making this incredible fall salad again! Thanks!

Made this with dried figs instead of the dates and finely slicing half the amount of shallots. Everything else to the recipe and it was wonderful. Presentation tips followed, and it looked great too.

Prepared this for a casual dinner party with friends. Everyone was in agreement that this was an exceptional salad. While I thought this was delcious, I would change a few things to cater to my personal taste: Add more vinegar to the dressing to cut the sweetness of the dates OR use a more tart variety of apple. I also omitted the shallot as I find raw shallots or onion to overpower salads in general. Plated this as shown on the restaurant website, using a mould and drizzling the balsamic reduction around the salad - beautiful presentation! Will definitely keep this recipe in my repetoire for years to come!

One more thing about the plating - check out the restaurant website for a great picture of how it should look. They had one posted in May, 2010.

I've never been a fan of Arugula and use Walnut oil very sparingly, because like most nut oils such as Sesame Oil, a little goes a long way. But, this salad received such rave reviews I had to try it. My opinions: the balsamic reduction added something for very little effort; I used 2 small Fujis, cut in my Cuisinart, and next time I'll add more; initially grated the cheese (mistake it needs to be shaved); I used a 3 month aged cheese and it was delicious; the dates were a good balance to the bite of the Arugula but difficult to work with as well as to distribute evenly - I think cranberries or raisins would substitute as others have suggested; do not use "walnut bits" but whole walnuts as listed. I had bits around the house and wanted to use them up but they absorbed too much liquid and were a bit soggy; use shallot but not as much as listed. I didn't try the plating mentioned as this wasn't for company.

Made this for a dinner party and it was a great hit. Don't care for dates so I substituted dried cranberries and it worked great. The candied walnuts are easy and you can make ahead of time. Suggestions for tweaking the recipe: One, the suggested amount of arugula is excessive -- I halved it and still came up with 5-6 generous servings. Two, I will leave out the shallots next time -- my husband and I both felt the raw shallot flavor didn't go well in the salad.

Rating: 4
This is my go-to dinner party salad. Everyone loves it! I've served it with everything from beef tenderloin roast to Chicken Marbella. I like to use the prettiest wild arugula I can find. I sometimes need more manchego than the recipe calls for if I'm making a large batch, and at times leave out the dates. This salad dressing is nice and versatile, too. Fresh, simple, and well balanced!

I knew when I saw this salad on the menu at Catal that I would love it, but the balsamic reduction and an excellent brand of walnut oil (try J. LeBlanc) make it even better than I imagined. Don't change a thing! I'm making it again this Saturday, seem to have a tradition of a perfect salad with fall fruit for my daughters birthday parties. (Have to make it worth the trip for the adults!)

I have eaten the original and fell in love instantly. As soon as I read the description on the menu, I had to order it. The compressed presentation is gorgeous, the reduced balsamic is thick and delicious, and a very good walnut oil makes a big difference. Have Don't change a thing! I'll be making this again Saturday for my child's birthday party.

Absolutely love this recipe. The first time I made it, I tried the "pressed" presentation.... forget it! The salad works very well plated. To save time I sometimes just heat white sugar in a pan and throw in walnuts when it liquifies. This is a quick way to carmelize any kind of nuts.

Made this for 20 women last night, I made a quadruple batch and it evaporated. They went crazy over it. This will be a regular at diner parties. One thing I did is bought Balsamic glaze and used that to coat the walnuts before baking, saved a step and they turned out great.

This is one of the best salads I've ever had. And I'm generally not a fan of walnuts. We didn't do the balsamic reduction or pile it up, we just ate it like a regular salad. Delicious.

I've now served this salad many times - its my standard first time salad first time dinner guests. The group last night raved about my "gourmet" salad - what a great way to start a dinner. I now use purchased candied pecans to simplify and always use the best fresh dates that I can buy. Why bother to mold it when it plates up so beautifully? This recipe is an absolute winner!

Rating: 4
I did a lot differently because I like to use what I have and cut down on food costs. I've considered purchasing the expensive walnut oil for the next time I make this but after reading a few reviews might just skip it as a few people thought it wasn't worth the extra money. As the recipe called for I used the peeled and thinly sliced red delicious apples, minced shallots,and the shaved manchago especially since it is one of my favorite cheeses. I actually had a bottle of balsamic reduction in my cupboard that I made a while back, and it was an excellent gourmet addition drizzled atop. Deviating from the recipe I made the caramelized walnuts as I have made them so many times before using butter, maple syrup, and salt and they were wonderful. My dressing was made from white vinegar, red wine vinegar and olive oil, which I had on hand. I used some sliced dates and the rest raisins soaked in hot water and liquor. I didn't care for the dates and they all stuck together too. Next time I will use only raisins prepared the same way. Oh,lastly, I used mixed baby greens since my healthfood store was out of arugula today.

I made a few substitutions. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I wouldn't bother with the baking part. Just finish them off in the pot & toss them on a buttered sheet. If you're not sure when they're at the hard-crack stage, use a candy thermometer. I couldn't get Manchego, my favourite cheese so I used Asiago. Do try & find Manchego. It's a sheep's milk cheese with a nutty flavour. I was dubious about the apples as I cringe at the thought of a Waldorf salad but they were surprisingly good. Forgot the shallots. Oops. Also didn't drizzle the balsamic glaze at the end as an unexpected guest arrived so it got forgotten. Otherwise it was still exquisite!

Wow, excellent salad! I left out the dates because I didn't have any, and used vegetable oil because I didn't have walnut oil...and I'll make it just the same way next time because it turned out great. Didn't compress it and it looked beautiful on the plate especially with the drizzled balsamic syrup that added a wonderful flavor. Goes on my A list.

Family didn't like it, so won't make it again. Although I normally love fruit in salad - didn't like the dates. Walnut oil is expensive and the dressing wasn't worth the extra cost (don't know how I'll use the rest of the bottle).

First of all, I did not do the compressed presentation and it didn't matter - all dinner guests loved it. i have made this several times and it is good as written (I quartered and sliced the apples) and you can substitute a sheep's milk cheese for the manchego or dried cranberries for the dates. I used a purchased balsamic glaze called "Blaze" that comes in a squeeze bottle and makes the recipe take less time.

Rating: 3
The dates all clumped together and I had to work pretty hard to distribute them equally throughout the salad. Maybe freezing them first would help? The dressing was delicious. Drizzling the reduced balsamic vinegar around the plate felt very gourmet but be careful not to reduce it too much or it's too sticky to drizzle properly. I used part Granny Smith (green) and part Fuji (red) apples to vary the color. Also, the more tart Granny Smith helped balance the sweetness of the rest of the salad. The prep of the apples is a little unclear. After I cored the apple and sliced it, I ended up cutting the apple "rings" in half anyway. So cutting the apples in half in the first place would have made it much easier to get thin, even slices.

Excellent salad. We made this for our annual New Year's Eve family dinner and we all loved it. We served this with a tomato and lobster pasta and it was fantastic. You can skip the balsamic glaze; it didn't add much to the salad and congealed shortly after making contact with the arugula. Incidentally, get your arugula at Trader Joe's if you're fortunate enought to have one near you. You won't find a better price.

This wonderful salad got rave reviews at our dinner party. However, I experienced a minor wrinkle in preparing it for the first time. This is the first time I've used a ring mold in a salad presentation. (Used a piece of PVC pipe) The amount of vinaigrette seemed right, but it was not enough to hold the salad together upon removing the mold. If there's a "trick" to getting this to work, I didn't figure it out. This problem does not bely the fact that everyone loved the salad, and so did I. Enjoy!

In a word - YUM. This salad rocks. When I tasted the vinegarette I was a little doubtful, but when you combine it with the sweetness of the walnuts and dates and saltiness of the cheese it is divine. Will definitely make again for company.

As an "occasional" gourmet, I made this salad as a starter at a recent gathering I arranged for family and friends. I could not readily find arugula, so I used a combination of spinach, butter lettuce, and raddichio. This salad was definitely the surprise of the evening. The blend of colors and flavors was absolutely astonishing! In fact, it was so good the remainder of the meal was somewhat anticlimatic. All in all, this will definitely be a repeat performance.

Outstanding! This was delicious from start to finish. The flavors are delicious and well-balanced. Arugula is the star here, don't substitute. Make sure to get good aged manchego, its saltiness is an essential counterpoint to the sweetnes of the dates, apples and walnuts. I might use a slightly tarter apple than a Fuji next time, like a Granny Smith. But don't skip any ingredient in this recipe! And spring for the champagne vinegar, it's terrific.

This salad never fails to please. Two changes I usually make: the balalmic syrup is not so grand -- look up better recipes in nicer cookbooks. To carmelize the walnuts, I begin as suggested by recipe, but after melting the sugar and vinegar together, I transfer the mixture to a skillet, coat the walnuts, and turn the walnuts over med-hi heat until the walnuts are nicely carmelized and slightly browned. You end up with much better control of the delicious walnuts using the skillet technique.

I made this for my boyfriend's mom, sister and brother in law and they thought it was SUPER GOURMET, which made me feel great! I didn't bother with the balsamic glaze because I didn't have time, and when I served it I just slapped it on the plate (forget about the can) and it was soooo delicious! The only thing I would change is maybe cut back on the dates. I used the baby arugula blend salad in a bag and no one ever knew. I had to use white cheddar because I couldn't find the other kind. I can't wait to make this again.

Great salad recipe. However, we took short cuts. Didn't bother with the balsamic part and used various lettuces, including frisee, that we had around. We did make the walnuts though and they were tasty. Make lots and throw them in everything. Used whatever apples we had. Although the manchego was good, we didn't use an aged one. Maybe that would have made a difference. I thought the cheese wasn't as sharp as the salad needed. Nevertheless, good all around. First course for T-giving dinner and it was well liked by all.

This is one of my FAVORITE salads...but of course I have changed it since day one. I subsituted olive oil for the walnut oil (didn't have it--too late to get it) and would change the walnuts to pecans (I am from the deep South--what can I say). I also have used romaine and mixed greens with great success. Forget the mounding... just pile on the plate and serve. This is my staple fall salad this season!

This salad is excellent; fabulous presentation; very elegant on a white plate, with the balsamic vinegar glaze drizzled around the compacted salad and topped off with the Manchego cheese. I wouldn't change a thing! I've made it several times. Very easy, too. All make-ahead but slicing the apples.
