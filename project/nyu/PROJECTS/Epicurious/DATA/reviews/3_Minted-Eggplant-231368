Sherry vinegar!! interesting!! My recipe is with the white wine vinegar; usually I add breadcrumb to absorb the sauce. Here's my version: http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/calabria/eggplants-with-mint.aspx

The eggplants looked beautiful , but final dish was just a little bland for my taste.

Nice silky eggplant, a zesty vinaigrette, fresh herbs. Lovely combo. I'd let the eggplant marinate a bit longer than 2 hours. I think this dish is even better the next day, warmed ever so slightly.

I LIKED the idea of this dish but I didn't love the way it worked out. I usually have good luck with Epicurious recipes and this one wasn't a failure it just wasn't SUPER. I think the recipe needs a little tweaking but the sprit is there.

I made a speed version of this recipe. First of all, I substituted the red wine vinegar for the sherry version, and it was quite successful. Secondly, I skinned the eggplants (three is really a perfect amount, don' tmake less!) and then cut them as told. Then I salted them thoroughly and let them set for a while. Then I washed them in cold water and patted them dry with a paper towel. As a result, I could fry them in a pan with plenty of olive oil, sinec I lacked the equipment and the time for the above recipe. The dressing is amazing, really. The dressing also works well artistically ... if you do it right, you can have a nice golden dressing with swirls of red vinegar. The mint works surprisingly well ... you don't taste it as first, but it lingers during the aftertaste. I amped up the dressing with more garlic (three cloves) and more oil and vinegar ... and plenty of fresh pepper. I paired it with a box of easy rice (fried rice flavor) and some perrier in wine glasses. It was a delicious, easy, and fun recipe that took about an hour to make, start to finish.

I love this recipe. The texture of the eggplant is great. I'll often steam per the instructions, then get creative with the marinade.

I followed the recipie exactly. The marinade was good, but the eggplant came out mushy and not so good. Maybe I cooked it too long, but it wasn't very pleasant

Any ideas about another kind of vinegar that one could substitute for the sherry vinegar? Merci!

I love eggplant and I think this is one of the best preparations I've ever had. The steaming in vinegared water really kept the flavors and colors intact; the seasonings were classic and scrumptious.

This dish was great, really easy and fabulous flavour. I served it as side with roast lamb and it went down really well. This will definately be one of the eggplant dishes with I make regularly from now on.
