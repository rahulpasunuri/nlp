Wonderful recipe. I used white rum as i didnt have any spiced rum (dark). Icecream stayed white. And my friends just love it. Super fluffy!! Absolutely recommended

The instructions could be a bit better. You should add the rum raisin mixture after the custard has began to freeze not before refrigeration. Way too much rum. I decrease the amount of rum down to 1/3 cup to soak the raisins and maybe add a tablespoon back to the raisins after draining.

Half recipe fit my ice cream maker. I like this ratio of milk to cream for ice cream. I used only three egg yolks (half recipe) which I thought was fine. Ice cream still had a slightly egg-y taste. Added salt and nutmeg. Delicious!

A few items are bassackwards...#1. the recipe is WAY too "rummy" and raisiny - cut back to 1/3C rum and 2/3C raisins (use fresh ones). #2. do NOT mix sugar and the eggs...instead mix the sugar with the milk. After wisking the eggs carefully add the heated sugar/milk mix to temper the egg yolks, then return to LOW heat (med-low is too high) for 15min. Add 1/8tsp kosher salt and a pinch of nutmeg (fresh grated) to the mix before refrigerating. I also pulse the rum/raisins one or two times in a food processor to help distribute the raisins...before adding to the ice cream maker in the last 5 minutes. Wisk the mixture for a smoother ice cream.

Delicious! Two ideas: 1) Don't add the rum raisins until just before the ice cream has frozen. The alcohol slows down the freezing process while the cream is in the ice cream maker. 2) I didn't have any dark rum in the house, so I used the clear rum we did have. You can add some molasses to it to deepen the color, but it won't be as potent as dark rum. Some people might prefer this.

I just made this and it is the best ice cream I've ever made. I try different recipes all the time and this has the perfect consistency and flavor.

I love this recipe and have made it numerous times. It's strong but my guests have raved about it! I use a combination of yellow and dark raisins, and also dark rum. I marinate the raisins for several days - soaks up most of the rum. It helps to freeze the ice cream overnight prior to eating.

Thanks to a cook from Florida! I didn't throw out the custard when it cooked faster than I expected and curdled. I put the curdled mess in a blender and it smoothed out beautifully. The ice cream was delicious. Not too rummy at all - but some people are sensitive. Give them vanilla and save this for yourself!

I loved it... but no one else who ate it did. Too rummy was the general consensus. Maybe nobody likes rum raisin ice cream as much as I do. Won't make it again because it's far too rich for me to eat it all myself.

This recipe is great. This was the first recipe I used in my new ice cream maker and it turned out perfect. I let my raisins soak over night and it was strong but my friends loved it that way!

Absolutely fabulous! (Forgot about the soaking raisins, and they stood overnight ... delicious, but potent.) Better than any ice cream you could ever buy.

Oh my god. This is the best rum raisin ice cream I've ever had. My friend's favorite, I decided to make it and he said it was the best he's ever had. Most important thing is to make sure that you use good quality rum. I used Gosling's Bermuda Black. Cream came out nice and light brown. Cut the recipe in half to fit 1 quart ice cream makers.

Augh! SOOO yummy! The alcohol keeps the ice cream from freezing too hard, so it remains nice and soft (not too soft though) in the freezer. And be warned that depending on the size of your ice cream maker, you might need to make it in two batches or do a half-recipe. The recipe as is makes a large amount.

This is a GREAT recipe! Make sure to stir it while making it into the custard, and it turns out wonderful, with only a little film on the bottom of the pan. I even increased the amount of raisins and added a little more rum. Definitely a keeper.

Oh my gosh, this ice cream is so-o-o good. I made it yesterday for the first time. Rum raisin is my husbands favorite and Hagen-daz is always on my grocery list. It want be on my list any more as I think this recipe may be better (and I made it for him).

I made this ice cream with my Dad as a present for Mother's Day. We were quite concerned as 1/2 the mixture seemed to be left in the strainer. But the ice cream turned out perfectly and was the right amount to fit in the ice cream maker. I've made rum raisin and other ice cream's in the past using other recipes. None of the previous ice creams were good the second day as they formed ice crystals. This ice cream remained as creamy and tasty as the day it was made.

I received nothing but rave reviews from everyone who tasted my first batch of this ice cream (including myself)! It is a little heavy on raisins, so I plan to half the amount in my next batch.

This is a wonderful recipe; and rum raisin is my husband's favorite ice cream. It is also forgiving. I let the custard come to a boil, and of course, it curdled. I beat it over a bowl of ice water and although it was still curdled and thinnish, I decided to try to churn it. It was still wonderful, smooth and creamy with no apparent loss of texture or flavor.
