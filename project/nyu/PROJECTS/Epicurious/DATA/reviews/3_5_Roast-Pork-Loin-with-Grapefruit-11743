If you are considering making this in order to use up grapefruit, I suggest throwing the seasoned pork loin in the oven and eating three grapefruit while watching TV for an hour and a quarter. Make a five minute pan gravy when the pork comes out, and you will have 90% of the flavor without having to zest, mince, juice, chop, or broil anything.

I found the gravy to be really tart. The pork loin with the coriander seeds was delicious. Would make again but I'd add way more sugar to the gravy.

Very tasty! I admit I skipped the broth and buerre manie and used a packet of roast pork gravy mix, but it was good. Skipped the sugar on the broiled fruit segments and it was sweet enough. Wouldn't skip the broiled fruit part, as it was integral to the dish. This is a citrusy play on pork chops and apple sauce, to very nice results!

Simple and delicious! I sauteed the onions and garlic briefly and lightly seared the pork before roasting. My husband and I bothed loved it and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.

I used a bone in pork loin roast which I think makes for a more flavorful meal, but otherwise followed the complete recipe, including the fruit. It was outstanding.

Delicious! I made this for Easter dinner to rave reviews and have been telling all my friends about the recipe. The grapefruit is an inspired flavor paired with the pork. I will definitely make this again.

I am not a fan of pork, however, my whole family enjoyed this one. My 6 year old enjoyed it, even though it did not resemble a chicken nugget. I broiled the grapefruit the first time I made it, but I am skipping that step this time. It was good but time consuming.

This recipe was easy and delicious. We especially liked the broiled grapefruit. Interesting touch. I served the roast with tiny red potatoes and sauteed spinach and the meal was a big hit.

We did like the pork and sauce, but the grapefruit sections were too much.

HUGE success, even with a guest who claimed to hate "meat with fruit." The broiled grapefruit was a big hit as well. Tasty and easy!

I loved it, made it 3 times, after the first time, I skipped the grapefruit sections broiling, just used the juice, nobody realy liked the cooked fruit. Plus it was a time consuming step, and it is stil delicious without it.
