This recipe can take quite a while to make if you don't have a double broiler or bowls/pots that are conveniently sized so that they perfectly nest in one another (placing the bowl over a saucepan of water but not letting the bowl touch the water etc)...but the result was terrific and everyone loved it. For the Finnish cook that got the liquid result, I'm guessing you didn't beat the mixture long enough. It really does take six minutes or so, but that's where the transformation from liquid to fluffy happens. Anyway, if you like vanilla, you like lime, and you like desserts, then you have to make this. Big-time crowd pleaser.

This mousse was a fabulous ending to a Mexican-themed dinner. I served it with my mother-in-law's coconut crisp cookies. A very refreshing summer dessert that I would recommend to everyone.

This was a complete failure. The result was not mousse, it was liquid. As I made this I was a little worried since I thought there was not enough gelatin in the recipe, but decided to still follow it. I will make this one again, using more gelatin. The flavor was nice, but some of my guests would not try it since it looked disgusting.
