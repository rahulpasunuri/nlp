I made this last night and everyone loved it. We grilled the salmon and I cooked a small piece in the pan to get the flavor for the glaze. It is a great light summer dish that I will definitely make again.

This was wonderful! I did have to change a few things to fit my taste, but the results were pretty close to the actual recipe. I only made the salmon and glaze portion to serve over jasmine rice with a side of green beans (with glaze drizzled over). It was light and refreshing and a perfect quick weeknight meal. As written, the glaze was a little too tart for my preference, so I added some honey and a bit more soy sauce and it same out perfectly balanced. I also strained the garlic and ginger out to create more of a sauce than a glaze.

This is an amazing dish :) We loved it however, I modified it a little bit by adding more gralic and ginger. The salad was a little bland, so I added a little more salt to the vinaigrette. Excellent dish! My husband is asking me to make it again tonight!

This recipe was phenomenal! I didn't make the cabbage and spinach part since I didn't have either of those, but the salmon and the glaze were AWESOME! Definitely a keeper of a recipe. Easy and delicious!

I thought this recipe was simple and absolutely delicious! I am having it again next week!

Delicious and easy (after all the chopping). I really liked the salad and did as another reviewer suggested and wilted it a bit in the dressing after the salmon and glaze were made. I did think the ginger and garlic needed to be discarded before drizzling on as there was a lot once the glaze reduced. Otherwise, the flavors and textures were outstanding. Fresh wild salmon also helped!

This recipe was easy, delicious, and impressive. I made it for two, only 2 salmon filets but the full amount of sauce. I cooked the salmon exactly as directed and it turned out perfectly. I couldn't find napa cabbage so I used red cabbage (which looked beautiful!) and romaine lettuce, and added to the salad: avocado, pine nuts, canned peeled mandarin oranges. these worked out great but lots of other things would too--olives? artichoke hearts? cheese? whatever you like on salad.... I was worried that the salmon would be too bland; I think salmon needs a strong tangy sauce and I wasn't sure that the orange glaze would cut it. BUT the key here is that it is served over and eaten with the salad, which has a strong tangy vinagrette. All in all a wonderful, tasty, healthy, simple but fancy-looking dinner.

It was light and refreshing. The salad complimented the salmon very well. It also was very quick and easy to make, which is a big plus!

I like to cook, but I wouldnt call myself a pro or even "great". However, I made this and it was fantastic! My fiancee thought it was better than any restaurant dish she had ever had! The vegetable salad is one of the best parts.

Very easy and a wonderful, light and fresh combination of ingredients. (I didn't have Napa cabbage, so I substituted green lettuce, and it was fine. I also added sesame seeds to the skinless side, which worked as well.) We eat a lot of salmon, and I'm always trying new recipes; this one will be a regular.

Even my husband who normally doesn't like salmon had seconds. Its a wonderful light dish with lots of flavor. The orange, ginger, garlic glaze was so simple and had so much flavor. I will definatley make again!

Great recipe/one dish meal. Easy and quick. I made this for two using 2 cups each of the Napa and spinach but used 1 red pepper and 1 carrot. Much better proportions. I also made the whole glaze recipe because of the reduction.

Awesome! A huge hit at my dinner party tonight. I doubled the sauce and marinated the salmon for 1/2 hour in a mixture of 3 parts soy sauce/1 part honey with some ginger and garlic. Everyone loved it and I had a professional chef at the dinner table. Served it with Jasmine rice and french green beans. Will definately repeat. Even the 4 yr. old loved it!

This is fabulous. I doubled the glaze and marinated the fish lightly in soy and honey as recommended. I chopped the salad the night before, making the whole dinner come together in less than 10 minutes. I served it with a roasted carrot soup. I will definitely be making this again.

Made it several times and always had great feedback & success. Easy to make and with presentation. Light but full of flavor.

Made this last night for my boyfriend, and we both loved it, especially the veggies. I made them more like coleslaw (omitted the spinach). The only change to the sauce I made was to add a teaspoon of honey to cut some of the acidity. It made the reduced sauce wonderfully thick. Served with sauteed spinach and roasted new potatoes. Very easy to make--definitely will be a regular dish in my kitchen!

This was delicious. The vinaigrette for the veggies is awesome. I will definately make it again. Next time I am going to grill the salmon. I think the smokiness will blend well with the flavor of the glaze.

I am not usually the weekend cook in my family as my husband really loves to cook, so my family was amazed when I made this dish. I found it very easy to make and incredibly good for the little effort required. I have made it a couple times now and it has turned out great each time. I may even make this for a dinner party and shock my friends by cooking for once!

Fabulous recipe. We have made this a dozen times over the past few years. The only changes I made were to use olive oil and quite a bit more garlic and fresh ginger. Also, we grill the salmon on the grill. YUM!

Amazing and a favorite for anyone who tries it! Even individuals who do not particularly like salmon love this dish! One suggestion, however, always use Alaskan Wild Salmon - makes all the difference in the world!

I found the acidic notes in this dish a little too much - and I generally like tart tastes. Perhaps I reduced the glaze a bit too much. I also added a teaspoon or so of hoisin sauce to the vinaigrette which I thought enhanced it.

I FOLLOWED THIS RECIPE TO THE T.NOT LIKE ME! FOUND IT LACKING IN FLAVOR. IT WAS OK BUT I PREFER TO GRILL MY SALMON AFTER MARINATING IT IN TERIYAKI AND FRESH GINGER FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO; THEN SERVING WITH RICE,SOY SAUCE AND WASABE. THIS RECIPE HAD MANY INGREDIENTS BUT JUST DID'T COME THROUGH.

Awesome! We substitued bok choy for Napa cabbage (since that was what we had on hand) to no ill effect. We also made a third more of the raw vegetable mix and vinaigrette, so it was like the succulent salmon sat atop a wonderfully dressed salad. This one is a keeper, and probably my favorite salmon recipe yet.

This is one of my all-time favorite Epicurious recipes. It is fabulous as written, although I prefer it with the glaze doubled and cooked down a bit. It is also WONDERFUL with fresh sea scallops. Living on the coast of Maine, fresh scallops are a must in my house. I seared the scallops until slightly crispy on one side, then turned over and cooked until just done -- err on the side of caution and add the scallops back to the glaze briefly to rewarm. Fantastic!

After reading earlier reviews, I used far more citrus juice (substituting Meyer lemons and clementinas for the orange/lime in the recipe). I seared the salmon fillets over a high flame, then poured some of the juice into the pan and covered it to poach the fish till it was done. The rest of the juice (twice what the recipe recommended) was used for the glaze. Instead of the cabbage, I used the veggie dressing on a salad of field greens, sweet orange and red peppers, shredded carrots and tiny bits of broccoli. We served the glazed fish fillets right on top of each serving of salad. It was fabulous! Got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

One of those 30 or so recipes that I know by heart now-a family favorite for husband and 3 kids- no complaints ever!Very forgivable-substitute any veggie in the bin and you're good to go!

This has become one of my signature dishes. I pan-fried it the first time I made this, and my house smelled like fish for days. The next time I made it, I use an electric grill. A phone call distracted me, so I accidently overcooked one side. When I tried to remove it from the grill it fell apart. This comedy of errors actually resulted in my favorite version...searing on side of the fillet added some crunchiness to the salmon and I enjoyed crispy "chunks" of salmon sprinkled on top of the salad. I drizzled the glaze over the chunks...enjoy. I also served this with sides of jasmine rice in separate individual bowls garnished with veggies from the salad.

I have made this several times. The first time, my date said, "This is restaurant food!" I agree with another reviewer, that the glaze recipe should be doubled.

I made this for mother's day, except I used tuna instead of salmon. My mom was really impressed. I thought it was just a bit too tart, so I might cut down a bit on the lime juice next time.

Wow...if you want to get "lucky" this is it! I can't wait to try it with the Napa...I didn't have any so I matchsticked green onions. I'll keep this in the next time I make it as it adds depth. Double the glaze amount...it really needs more.

This was truly incredible -- ranks up there with anything from a top-notch restaurant. Our market didn't have salmon so we used mahi-mahi instead; I can't imagine that salmon would have been better. One warning: When boiling down the sauce, the recommended three minutes would have taken it down to almost nothing. I took it off the stove after about two minutes and still had less than 1/4 cup.

I enjoyed this dish but agree with an earlier review that it lacked depth. Try serving this salmon with glaze on a Thai Chinese-Cabbage Salad (also on this site) adding spinich, red pepper, and carrot julienne and a touch of sesame oil to the toss. YUM.

I made this last night, not expecting to like it so much as I did. However, it is really very good. I think it would be a mistake to leave out the cabbage as it gives such a satisfying crunch to the dish. The only change I made is to cook the salmon on our Weber instead of in the pan, so the glaze may have had less of a salmon flavor, but I thought it was a beautiful presentation as well delicious.

We made this recipe for our New Year's Eve dinner, and it was a smashing success! Not only is it incredibly healthy, but it was incredibly simple to prepare -- which was a good thing since we were on a sailboat, and kitchen space was limited! We marinated the salmon with soy, honey, ginger and garlic, and added shallots to the glaze. We also subbed extra virgin olive oil for the canola oil. Next time I make this, I'll probably use a little less oil. Healthy, easy and yummy -- what's not to love?

This was really delicious and looked extrememly impressive in its presentation. I will most definitely make this again; in fact, I will find it difficult to make salmon with another recipe for awhile. I did change a couple of things: I sauteed the vegetables but then let them cool, which I wouldn't do again as I think they would be best warm. I put the veggies on top of a bed of mashed potatoes with spinach, which worked really well. Next time, I'll make more glaze as I think it needed a bit more (and it's so good). Also, I put some fresh cilantro on top at the end.

My first review. This was great, prep veggies and marinade ahead and it is fast fast! I grilled the salmon and briefly sauteed the vegies, adding some finely chopped onion, with the marinade. By all means use the napa cabbage, it gave the dish character. I plated with a basmati rice made with chix stock, golden raisins & pine nuts and the meal was truly special. All my guests e-mailed me to thank me.

I wasn't expecting much - but this was really yummy! After tossing the veggies with the dressing I threw it in the pan I cooked the salmon in and let it all wilt a bit - about 5 minutes over a medium flame. Also, I marinaded the salmon with a bit of soy & honey for about an hour. Very tasty!

This recipe was good, but I felt like the flavor was missing something. It was all high notes, without any undertones to round it out. I added some toasted sesame seeds which seemed like a nice addition.

Very tasty and easy. I added a touch of Thai chile sauce to the vinagrette, which added a really nice kick. Since I only had the spinach in the house(I was about to cook dinner and was just surfing for a salmon recipe)I served the salmon and spinach over some udon noodles. Yum.

I've prepared this twice for guests and have received rave reviews. The combination of textures, flavors is great. Not at all complicated either. I served it with a side of sauteed asparagus w/lime juice, soy sauce and sesame seeds.

Good basic glaze for fish. I made this w/ tilapia which is a nice firm fleshed white fish that is slightly sweet. The sweetness of the citrus w/ crispness of ginger went together well. I would suggest straining the reduced sauce at least a little to get rid of the bits of ginger and garlic.

Glaze didn't really add anything, and the salmon came out undercooked on my electric range (I should've cooked it at high heat). The salad bed and vinaigrette was quite good, though.

My guests loved this. I cooked the salmon on the smoker, brushing with the dressing ingredients. Didn't make the glaze. I will certainly use the dressing for other things.

My husband and I (and kids!) loved this recipe. It's a delicious combination of asian flavors--you can use the dressing for the cabbage/spinach/carrot/red peppers on traditional salads or even pasta tossed with grilled veggies. For salmon "purists", you may want to save the citrus-soy glaze for dipping rather than pouring it over the fish. Delicious!
