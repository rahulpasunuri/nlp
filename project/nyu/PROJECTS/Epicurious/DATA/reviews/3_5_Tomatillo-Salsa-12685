We enjoyed this recipe but I omitted the water and added olive oil. It was very easy

This was so easy to make and very tastey. Did not use water but added about a teaspoon of olive oil and a squeeze of lime juice. Also stirred in some ground cumin which added more dimension to the flavor. Delicious!

Did not add any water, but it was still too runny for my taste. It was easy to prepare though.

I loved it and my guests loved it. Omit the water and add oil as one cook suggested. The tomatillos already have enough water. I do not puree totally. It looks much better if the tomatillos are finely diced (ie. use food processor, etc). I also add diced plum tomatoes (orange and red ones). The salsa looks and tastes absolutely wonderful!

This recipe is very tasty. I took the advice of the cooks from Little Rock and Marlborough and left out the water but added the juice of half a lime instead. Next time I would use only one jalepeno (or two smaller than the ones I used).

I just put everything in the food processor--I use NO water, and maybe about 1 tsp olive oil to keep it from separating. Great with lime doritos!

The salsa's a lovely color and has great flavor, as long as you're a fan of cilantro. I'll decrease the water next time. It's a little runny for me.
