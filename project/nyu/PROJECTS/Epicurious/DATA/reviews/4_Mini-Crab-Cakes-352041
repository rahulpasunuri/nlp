These were very good, but not a traditional crab cake if that is what you are looking for. The idea of using the muffin tins was excellent though. I'll remember that the next time I make crab cakes.

This recipe is wonderful. I also used a pound of crab meat and ran out of panko but mine made more than 48 (about 24 more!!). These are tasty right out of the oven but they are also easy to prepare in advance, and re-warm in the oven on a cookie sheet when your guests arrive. This one is definitely staying in my recipe folder!!

This recipe was great. I used a pound of crab meat and the same amount of everything else and it worked great. I did have to make a bit more Panko mixture because it made about 48! They all disapeared at my party last night.

This is definitely a 4 fork recipe, but only straight out of the oven, when they are still crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. If they sit or need to be transported and reheated, it loses something along the way, so I would rate them only a 3 at that point. A sauce on the side is a must if they are not fresh out of the oven as well...

Made these the other night after seeing them in the back of the most recent Bon Appetit magazine in conjunction with a blender hollandaise sauce by Eric Ripert. I almost chose to pan fry them in the panko and butter but decided at the last minute to make them more healthy and bake them as described in the recipe. I used a mini muffin pan (tart pan) that I normally make pecan tarts in for Christmas. This was the perfect size. I sprayed the pan with nonstick cooking spray instead of butter as I wanted to make sure they would pop out of the pan and not be caked on. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written. They browned perfectly and set up nicely and were absolutely awesome! My wife commented on how perfect they looked and tasted. I will make these again in a heartbeat and they would be great to take as an appetizer for get togethers. Using the tart pan I had I made 30 crabcakes. Delicious! The blender hollandaise sauce on the other hand was a different story. Love Eric Ripert but sauce did not taste like hollandaise to me. Something was off just not sure what.

The name of the recipe is deceiving. They are by no means crab cakes. But I must say they are fabulous "crab bites". Excellent flavour! I made them as written and wouldn't change a thing. The citrus compliments the rest of the ingredients beautifully. This reciper is keeper!

I discovered this recipe last year and have made it a staple for all our get togethers - it never fails to please and gets recipe requests every time. I purchase the fresh crab from Costco - amazing deal. This requires doubling the rest of the ingredients - makes up 6 dozen mini muffin tin cakes (3 pans). I also keep them prepared and frozen in the freezer and then pop them in the oven - works fabulously!

i LIKE this recipe! ---- After reading all the reviews here's what I did --- 1.) 16oz. crabmeat(they came in 8oz. containers) --- 2.) Greek yogurt for the sour cream --- 3.) Sprayed PAM (canola) on the pans and they came right out. --- 4.) Served with Red Pepper Jelly, Yum! ---- Here's what I'll change for next time ---- 1.) Either use only one 8oz. of crabmeat or add a little extra cream cheese or yogurt. I had a ton of filling left over, I'm going to make the rest today in a reg. muffin pan just so I don't waste the $15 crabmeat;) --- 2.) More flavor! More salt?...scallions instead of chives?...more than just a pinch of cayenne?...not sure exactly but it needed something big time! ------ All in all easy recipe, I will try it again.

these are great right out of the oven, but if they sit for any time (i.e. buffet) the cream cheese makes them heavy. love the idea of putting them in mini muffin tins - that works great.

YUM! I've been wanting to make crab cakes for years! What a great recipe to finally make! I was completely impressed and my guests devoured them. Next time I'd serve a dip alongside for those that like to have something on the side (although they definitely don't need it). I ran out of panko mixture and had to make another half batch for the second tray so I'd def double it next time around right off the bat. I also added nearly double the crab called for. Super, super good. Even my picky 3 y-o ate them!

I made these for the second time for a cocktail party. Made the recipe exactly as written , except used 16 oz crab. Served it with garam masala curry paste mixed w/ sour cream on the side for the dippers...Gone on seconds!

These are always perfect for me. I don't substitute anything. The canned crab I use is high quality and 6.5 oz. Use a non stick mini muffin pan and they pop right out! The only suggestion I have is to increase the panko crumb mixture by about 1/4 c. My guests like to use Tabasco with these. Delicious!

easy to make and they disappear from a party tray in no time flat. the citrus peel adds a nice little zip. will definitely be making these again.

I threw this recipe together for Easter brunch yesterday and they were delicious! I halved the cream cheese and sour cream according to previous reviews and this yielded a nice ratio of crabmeat to filling. Fresh crabmeat is a must! I also left out the orange because I didn't have any but didn't miss it. A rounded tablespoon of panko at the bottom is too much- I used about a teaspoon and pressed it down with the bottom of a shot glass. I had just enough panko leftover to sprinkle about a 1/2 teaspoon on top. This made exactly 24 tasty mini crabcakes!

These were good. I used a regular muffin pan and made 12. All I did was generously butter my muffin tin and the cakes came out clean and beautiful looking. Next time I make these, I'm cutting back on the lemon and using way more crab. Overall, very good.

I made these for a housewarming party and they were all gone at the end of the night. Even people who don't like seafood loved them. I did accidentally put some parmesan and panko in with the crab mixture b/c I got a little ahead of myself and didn't read the recipe carefully. This might have fixed the problem others were saying about needing to reduce the amount of sour cream and/or cream cheese. They turned out great though...I'll be making them again for Easter!

Update: I made these again for a party and was reminded that 1 rounded tablespoon is too much to start with in the mini muffin tins. 1/2 of the panko mixture works perfectly well. I also agree that these are better first out of the oven, not reheated. Everyone loved these and I got a lot of comments on how pleasant the citrus flavor was. My guests did not believe that these were homemade. They certainly benefit from a bit of sauce to compliment them. This time, I used a spicy Indian lime relish on the side.

My guests devored these crab cakes last night. I took several of the previous reviewers suggestions - 1) doubled the crab meat, served with thai red curry mayo (to die for). My group really liked the hint of citrus in the cakes. My only negative comment was that I had a difficult time getting them out of the pans and the clean-up was a bit much. Next time I think I might use Pam rather than butter on the pans and add some more seasoning to the panko bread crumbs (at least some pepper).

Rating: 4
I've made these twice now and served them with the Saffron Orange Aioli from this site. They are very tasty. However, the bread crumb mixture is only enough to make the bottom crust. I ended up mixing together more panko and parm to sprinkle on the top. Also, I used a pound of lump crab.

I made these for Easter 2009 (sorry little slow on reviewing). They were GREAT!!! I have a lot of crabcake recipes, but love this new updated version!!! I agree with other reviewers. Either double the crab or cut the sour cream and cream cheese in half.

Easy and tasty. I used regular homemade bread crumbs from a day-old baguette, not the panko because I forgot to buy some. I used Dungeness crab because that's what we've got here in the Bay Area. I also made them ahead and re-heated as directed. Delicious with champagne on New Year's Eve!

This wasnt quite what I was expecting, but still pretty tasty. The breadcrumbs beneath and below the crab, instead of mixed in with it, are supposed to form a crust. They were larger and messier than I expected, and needed a little zip to them. I think next time, I will add the breadcrumbs to the mixture, and DEFINITELY use a non-stick pan, because these were hell to get out of the pan (even though I'd buttered it!).

Has anyone tried King crab legs for the crab instead of lump? King Crab legs seem to go on sale here this time of year for really good prices.

Made this recipe following other reviewers' advice about the cream cheese/crabmeat balance (I just doubled the amount of crabmeat). These are easy to make, smell wonderful when in the oven, and get rave reviews. I actually think they are best right out of the oven rather than reheated -- the panko is a little crisper right out of the oven. I also agree that they could use a little more salt. I served these with a red thai curry mayonnaise (1 cup mayo, 1 tbsp red thai curry, fresh lemon zest and chives) which worked really well.

Absolutely delish! I have been searching for the perfect crab cake appetizer, and made these for Christmas Eve. Guests who don't even like seafood couldn't stop eating them, and I emailed the recipe to almost everyone at their request. Definitely a keeper!!

These are light and have a mild taste. I used 1 pound of lump blue crab meat and 1/4 c. sour cream and 8 oz. of cream cheese. The rest of the ingredients were doubled. It made 58 appetizers. They are tasty and citrusy. The recipe could use a bit more salt. I garnished them with chives and fresh orange and lemon zest.

This recipe has become a family favorite. It's easy, delicious and can be prepared in advance. I wouldn't change a thing, although I do garnish with a little lemon zest for parties.

I made a double batch of this recipe for a pool party with some alterations as previous reviewers suggested. I used half of the cream cheese amount since a lot of reviewers thought it was too cheesy. I more than doubled the crab. I did not use any orange peel. They came out delicious. I didn't think they were even slightly cheesy...I couldn't even tell there were any dairy products in it. Next time I might use the full amount just to see what it tastes like. Also, I ran out of the panko mixture...a generous tablespoon might be a little much. I served these with a lime aioli. They were a hit!

Alterations: doubled the panko ingredients, reduced sour cream to 1/8 cup, used Costco's 16 oz. can of lump crabmeat, used a heaping measuring tsp. of mixture when filling (a "generous Tbs." was way too much) and the results (4 dozen) were perfect and well-received. I made the crabmeat mixture the day before as noted; but filled, baked, cooled on rack, and refrigerated on parchment-lined sheet (uncovered to prevent condensation) for approximately 6 hours. They reheated well at 350 for 10 minutes. In addition, I tried an unscientific, overnight freeze-test on one...stuck it in the freezer on a plate and reheated this morning at 375 for 10 minutes. Again, perfect! With a little more tinkering, this will go on my do-ahead hors d'oeuvre list.

Despite what previous reviewers said, I decided to make the recipe as is, except that I used 2 6 oz. cans of fancy lump crabmeat. The recipe was absolutely perfect and extremely easy to prepare. My husband, who is probably one of the pickiest eaters on earth, tasted the crab cakes and surprised me by saying that I could go into business selling them. These were really great!

This recipe was fine-- nothing spectacular, but an interesting twist on the classic crab cake. Measurements are extremely off- be warned! I wish I could recount how so, but I think past reviewers took care of that for me.

Easy to make. I followed the recipe to the letter except that I used about 10 oz of crab (instead of 6). The uncooked mixture was very cheesy but they were great right out of the oven. And no one guessed that there was cream cheese in them. Great with a glass of champagne.

Thanks to all the reviewers that made these before me. I was making these for Easter and noticed before I put the crab in the bowl that there seemed to be too much liquid so I ran to the computer to read the reviews. I then took out most of the cream cheese mixture and just added it to the crab until it look "right". Luckily for me they turned out great and everyone wanted the recipe. I will make them again using the 4oz of cream cheese and such recommended by a cook from San Francisco.

These are more like Mini Crab Bites, but they are delicious. I made per the directions except used 8oz of crab. I put a dollop of red pepper jam on each one and they were delicious. Others have complained the cream cheese was overwhelming, but my diners had a hard time identifing it.

These were a huge hit on Easter and everyone asked for the recipe. Based on other reviewers' feedback I made the following changes: used 4 oz cream cheese, 1/8 cup sour cream and 8 oz. crab. I also added panko just to the bottom of the tins; I didn't use it on top -- seemed like that would be too much crunch for such a little bite. They turned out really well. The only glitch was that it made 17, not 24, due to the reduced amts of cream cheese and sour cream.

I'm kicking myself for not reading the other reviews. Pros: easy to make, can be made ahead, good one-bit cocktail food. Cons: WAY too much citrus - I would cut in half, maybe even eliminate the orange - it overpowered the crab, and I would cut back on the cream cheese - I added extra crab and it was still a little cheesy.

These were easy to make. They were a little more cheesey than I expected. I would proably cut the cream cheese by a third next time and add more crab. The presentation was nice and most people enjoyed them.

These were cute, easy, and crunchy. But the flavor was overwhelmed by the creamed cheese and sour cream, even though I used more crab than called for. Maybe ok if you are looking for more of a creamy bite, but nothing like the crab cake I was hoping for. We ended up throwing out the leftovers.

These were very tasty and fairly easy. Next time I think I'll use a little less orange zest and I'll use a tiny bit less of the breadcrumb mixture in the bottom of the muffin tins (I didn't have any left over for the tops). I used low-fat cream cheese and low-fat sour cream, and they still tasted very good.

These were faster than a traditional crab cake...go easy on the zest and on the crab crumbs. Extra filling can be used in mini-quiches or wrapped in phyllo

These are so easy (and can be mad ahead!) and so cute! Typically I like crab cakes with all crab and minimal breading but the crispiness from the panko made up for it. The light citrus from the zest is wonderful. I'm going to see if I can use light cream cheese and light sour cream to reduce a little guilt.
