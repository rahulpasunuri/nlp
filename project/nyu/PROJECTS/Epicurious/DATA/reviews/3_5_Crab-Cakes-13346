I made this recipe the other night for the second time. The first time, I remember liking it enough to bookmark, and I like it's ease of prep. But in retrospect I believe I used panko crumbs in place of the saltines; this time, following the recipe exactly, I found the cakes too salty. Yep, salt from the saltines. I have another more complex recipe (from Gourmet, Dec 2004) that I'll go to, unless I'm pressed for time. In that case, I think I'll look for another recipe. BTW, I use our delicious, local Dungeness crab.

This recipe was very nice & easily raised to an exceptional (4 fork) level. By adding some finely minced green pepper & onion, and excluding the external coating of cracker/bread crumbs, you have a nice, flavorful crab cake with less breading. Again, the dish mates perfectly with the herb vinaigrette salad from another crab cake recipe on this website, and a nice white wine.

Too much salt. I would leave out the 1/4 tsp of salt the next time. I didn't put in all the bread crumbs because I prefer my crab cakes to be very crabby! I find I do this with all crabcake recipes except the true Virginia ones.

This is a delicious crab cake recipe. I combined it with another Gourmet crabcake recipe in that I omitted the peppers and added 2T minced celery and 2T minced onion, sauteed in butter until very soft. Refrigerating the cakes for at least an hour makes them hold together during cooking. I served them with a lime-cilantro tartar sauce (Gourmet, 2001) to rave reviews.

Really liked this recipe! Was very simple and quick. Made a few substitutions, like Paul Prudhomme for Old Bay, and bread crumbs for saltines, eased off on the parsley; all worked fine. Think I needed to drain the pimentos a bit more. Contrary to other posted reviews, I didn't think the ingredients overpowered the crab. Cakes were delicious!

I have been making this recipe for years. I logged on just to check it out and see what others think and I was surprised by the negative comments. This recipe works well even if you do not have the best crabmeat. Also, use less mayo and chill the patties for awhile before cooking. They will not fall apart. Also, try making the patties a little smaller. A friend is in from out of town and specifically requested the crabcakes for a pre-event cocktail party I am having at my place.

Bill from Maryland is right - sweet crab meat is wasted when people add all these ingredients. Good crab cakes have minimal ingredients. For great crab cakes, use 1 lb of lump crabmeat, add 1 egg or 2 T of mayo, 2 slices of white bread soaked in milk, a little Worcestershire and prepared mustard, a touch of Old Bay. Refrigerate for a couple of hours. Deep fry, pan fry, or broil. You will have glorious crab cakes that are (nearly ) pure crab. Perfection!

I would add eggs and other ingredients to hold the crab cakes together. They tend to fall apart while cooking.

I made these for a dinner party and they quickly went from crab cakes to crab spread. Although it tasted fine as spread on baguettes, they were very disappointing because they completely fell apart on me. Perhaps more bread crumbs would help if I ever made them again.

Being a Marylander, I'm familiar with what we snobbishly view as a classic crab-cake. Leave out the pimiento and the Worcestershire sauce and this is perfect! These can be broiled as well. Serve with traditional accompaniments of cole slaw and french fries, with plenty of brewskis on the side, Hon.

the only changes i made to this recepie, was i used un-salted crackers & after forming & coating the crab cakes, i covered them w/ waxed paper & put them in the fridge for an hour or 2, depending on how much time i had before serving..they seemed to hold together better

i followed the directions exactely, omiting the pimentos, but I don't know what happened. They didn't stay together for me and I just wasn't impressed with them :(

Just made this recipe for a party I catered and the reviews were fabulous. It was an elegant cocktail party for 30 people. I made 5 pounds of crab and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I served them as mini-crab cakes accompanied by a horseradish lime sauce (the recipe can be found on Epicurious by typing in horseradish lime sauce). They looked and tasted great!

The recipe was perfect as it is written. Don't handle them too much and be gentle when you do. They stayed together just fine. I used our Pacific Northwest's wonderful fresh Dungeness crab and simply served them with lemon wedges. They tasted superb!

Good Stuff! Eliminated the dredging step...just put the entire bowl of cracker crumbs into the crab mixture, formed the patties, and fried them. They held together nicely, I think it helped that I made my patties small.

These are fabulous! My husband made a small variation: He omitted the pimento and did not fry the cakes. Instead he omitted the outside coating of cracker crumbs and broiled them until slightly brown on top, turning once. Since the crab is already cooked, you really only need to warm the cake completely through - the egg will be cooked. We will definately be making these again. They are predominately crab meat, without a heavy bread mixture.

Awesome! I added: 2 slices torn up bread (for holding) 1/2 cup roasted corn, 1/4 cup roasted red bell peppers. I prepared 1 day ahead & stored in fridge - they were so yummy. They rivaled my old VA family recipe, and were a little more updated. My mix made only 7.

Heavenly! I needed a whole 4 oz. freshness pack of saltines. I was worried it would stay together when I made the pattie. But it did and was great!
