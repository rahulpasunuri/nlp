Per the recipe, this is a very mildly spiced dish, if you like a bit more punch, double the spices. Very good recipe overall, will be making this often.

Everything was great. I thought it might be a bit too liquidy so I simmered the meat mixture for a while. It would have been better to have had more liquid which the topping would have soaked up. I cut down on the heat to suit my liking. My guest loved it.

This is the second recipe of tamale pie I tried. Interestingly my husband liked this recipe better, I felt like it needed a bit more spice. Next time I may try increasing the heat.

I made a vegetarian version of this dish and beefed it up a bit with the addition of canned black beans, chopped fresh tomato and jalapeño and poblano chilis. For the topping I used maseca instead of the corn meal because I didn't have any. It turned out super well. I would also try it with ground turkey instead of the pork for a little more substance than the veggie version.

My kids loved this. I used tomato puree since I didn't have any paste or sauce and used ancho chili powder. I simmered some chicken thighs in the sauce for about an hour and shredded them, added a can of beans and some agave to cut the acidity a little. Topped it with a cornbread mix for convenience. Really good, and easy.

One of our regular favorites. As commentators have previously noted, amp up the spice level. We like to add chipotle red pepper and have jalapenos in the jack cheese.

When do you add the tomato sauce?

After reading the rave reviews, I gave this a try. My husband is allergic to ground beef, so I wanted to try a new recipe with ground pork. I was disappointed. I would much rather make a great pot of chili, which this tastes like, with a pan of my favorite cornbread. This is not really a potpie and does not have a "crust". It is dry and boring.I even took the tip to top bread with butter. My advice is to keep looking.

I've made this dish twice and loved it both times! The second time I used ground turkey instead of the pork (to lighten it up a bit) and it turned out great! I also substituted a box of jiffy cornbread mix and made it as per package directions, adding the cheese and chilis at the end... turned out perfectly! I love this recipe and will use it again and again!

This is very delicious and a good use for ground pork. Actually I started making Cottage Pie and realized partway through that I had pork instead of beef so I switched to this recipe and used the mashed potato topping instead of the corn bread. It turned out just fine.

This was an easy and great meal. I made some of the changes others noted (used diced tomatoes + sauce instead of sauce and paste), doubled most of the seasonings, and used 2 eggs and jalapeno peppers in the cornmeal crust. Good spicy comfort food --and great as leftovers, too.

Amazing! very simple and really delicious. I have a bunch of ground pork in my freezer and have been trying to come up with different ways to fix it. This is definitely one of the best. I wouldn't suggest any changes, it turned out perfectly as is.

I've made this a few times, and like others, have started making some changes. I don't use sugar in the cornmeal crust, and I use the pre-cooked Trader Joe's carnitas, shredded, instead of ground pork, and I always add extra smoked paprika or ground chipotles. Sometimes I add black beans and often use canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, just because I'm more likely to have diced tomatoes on hand. Also, try putting it in individual gratins instead of a large casserole dish--this eliminates the potential of the center falling in and everyone gets the crunchy edges.

I had a good result. Omitted salt & pepper; used no salt tomato sauce 8oz plus 4oz water with a bit more tomato paste. OK to use oil instead of butter in topping. Used rectangluar 3qt. pyrex pan to ensure cornbread fully cooked. Baked 10 min @ 400, 25 min @ 350.

I made this with diced canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and paste. I liked it but my husband thought it was too bland. I will definietely make it again though and add chipotles. I didn't think there was too much cumin.

This recipe has just one critical flaw: It never tells you to add the 12 oz can of tomato sauce. I realized this too late, and the result is of course dry and bland. I am going to try this again in a few weeks adding the tomato sauce to the pork mixture and let you all know how it turns the 2nd time.

The recipe was really delicious. I also added black beans to the pork and instead of tabasco sauce I used chipotle paste. Additionally, I do not like my tamales to be sweet. I made a few modifications to the crust. I added salt, used oat cream instead of milk (due to milk allergy in my household), I added smoked paprika also to the crust batter and a little added water. My husband who does not like original tamales really liked this recipe. My 9 month old enjoyed the crust!

I made the recipe exactly as written, except I added one additional egg to the bread batter, as it seemed a little dry when I mixed it. It was a yummy change from chili. Very flavourful, very filling and hearty. Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar in the bread batter to one tablespoon - I don't like a sweet cornbread. Also, I will reduce the cumin by half and increase the chili powder a little.

ok recipe but not out of this world. Have similar recipe with better taste. I would use 1/2 of the cumin...too overpowering.

I made this 3/4lbs of ground pork and 1/4 spicy pork sausage. really good. Had a little trouble with the corn bread cooking the center, but Think I should have spread it thinner. very good. makes a lot. frozen half of it for later

This was really good. I had only about 3/4 pound of ground pork, so I added a can of kidney beans. This made it more like chili, but still very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this twice now, it turned out great each time although the second time, I made several changes. I used leftover oven barbecued pork, and added a can of black beans, a minced fresh jalapeno and some leftover sweet corn from the garden, slightly increasing the amount of cumin and adding a bit of chipotle chile powder. I especially love the cornbread crust, and have used that recipe successfully on several other dishes. It cooked up great in my grandmothers cast iron dutch oven, the cornbread had a nice cruse around the edges slightly browned from the cheese, mmmm!

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago, added a can of pinto beans, a little more corn, and almost double the seasonings. It turned out great, albeit a little too much crust for my liking. But I also froze a couple of servings, and last night I roasted and peeled 2 pasilla peppers, stuffed them with the thawed leftovers, popped it in the oven for a few minutes. Great and easy!

cornmeal and polenta are the same thing. The only difference is the price.

Pretty good recipe - the meat portion was very tasty, though I think I may have over done it with the Tabasco. I didn't have yellow cornmeal so I substituted with Polenta and it worked okay - the crust came out a little more crunchy than I would have liked. I also didn't have a can of peppers for the crust, so I put in green onions and cilantro and it came out really well. All in all, a yummy easy dish - but not something very fancy.

I'm eating leftovers as well; for those of you who haven't tried this yet - - - go for it! I substituted a can of chopped tomatoes for the sauce - very good from the start. I've always used low salr tomaoes with great results. To further reduce the sodiium this time I tried minced jalapenos instead of the canned greened chiles. Way Better! More heat, less salt, allaround BETTER! Hope everyone enjoys....this is a great recipe and worth trying over and over until it's your own.

Super. I used pork shoulder. Slow roasted in a 225 oven after rubbing with my husband's secret dry spice mixture. Shredded the pork. Made the sauce, did not thaw the corn, just tossed it in and let the sauce simmer a bit. I did add a bit more tomato sauce because it got quite thick. Added the pork and some leftover red beans. We used buttermilk instead of milk in the topping & added a sprinkling of cheese and dots of butter on top of it. Served with salsa fresca & sour cream. I'm having leftovers now. Yum.

Wonderful. It's now my boyfriend's favorite dish. Since I'm cooking for 2, I put half of the meat mixture in the freezer and then made half of the cornbread mixture and baked in a 1 1/2 quart loaf dish. Definately use more cheese. And try to spoon the cornbread around the edge. The recipe says this, but I didn't follow this direction the first time and the cornbread in the center never fully cooks, so it was wet and gooey.

Rating: 2
Very easy, tastes good. It tastes like chile; next time i would lessen the amount of cumin and maybe the chile powder (already used less tobasco)so my kids would like it better. Beans sound like a good addition. i'm sure ground meat of any kind or none would be just fine too.

Easy to shop for and prepare, even on a weeknight. I made a non-dairy version (using rice milk, pareve margarine and no cheese) for a family member with a severe dairy allergy, and it was very well received.

Wonderful recipe. I used 16 oz tomato sauce (as opposed to 12), and added a can of black beans to filling. Used granulated brown sugar in the cornbread crust, and increased the butter and cheese (used one cup of cheese). I used a combination of Monterrey Jack and Cheddar in the crust. Turned out GREAT! So easy to make.

This is a great recipe. I used hamburger instead of ground pork and it came out wonderful! Everybody had seconds en there weren't any leftovers even though I made more than enough. Will definitely make this dish again!

It was so good! Don't forget to add the tomato sauce - the recipe omits it in the directions. I found the cornbread to be a little dry, but if you put some butter on it while it's in the oven, it gets nice and moist. This is great the second and third day, too!

I've made this recipe with ground pork, ground beef, and most recently, a combination of black beans and rice in place of the meat-- each way has been delicious and I'd highly recommend the bean/rice combo for serving vegetarian. I've also tried other similar tamale pie recipes and this is by far my favorite, because of how moist and flavorful the crust turns out. Wonderful!

Excellent dish. I added a can of pinto beans also. Reheats well for lunch next day. Used hamburger instead of ground pork, because I had it on hand.

I just made the corn bread this time because it looked fairly simple and all the other recipes I saw here required buttermilk which I don't have. I didn't add cheese, I placed it in a loaf pan and cooked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Wow, it was moist and tasty. Will do the tamale part in the future...

Love the dish it gives a new twist for ground pork.

We made this dish with 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 hot sausage.I drained the excess fat before adding the tomatos and other ingredients. We used a mexican tomato sauce made from fresh tomatoes from our garden ( also found on this site ).We only needed a few shakes of Tabasco in addition. The recipe turned out fabulous. The crust was so good, my spouse suggested I should make it on its own.We loved this one.

Very good dish and fairly easy to make. You can alter the ingredients with good results. I used half the quanity of meat and halfed the cheese and butter in the topping. I found I had to add a lot of water to the meat sauce during the cooking time on the stove.

Comfort food at its best. The great thing about this dish is the make-ahead meat layer. Putting together the topping is a snap at dinner time & the pie is in the oven long enough for you to make a leisurely salad & lay the table. Easy & good.

This recipe was quick to put together and tasted great. I didn't have tomato sauce so substituted spaghetti sauce. Also added some chipotle sauce to the mix. Great! The cornbread topping does dry out on reheating leftovers -- but we doused it with sour cream and hot sauce, and kept on eating.

Delicious! This is hearty and filling - even my "meat and potatoes" husband loved it. Don't skip the Tobasco sauce...it really brings up the flavor, if fact we sprinkled more on our individual servings. Make sure the cornbread topping is done all the way before serving - mine took a little extra time. Enjoy!
