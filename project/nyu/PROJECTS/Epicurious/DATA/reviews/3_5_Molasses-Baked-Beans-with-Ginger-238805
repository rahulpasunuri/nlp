I made this for a family get together - received rave reviews from all! I typically do not like baked beans because they are soupy and salty, but this is full of rich flavor and not soupy at all. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

I've been making these beans for 4 years and my friends still ask me to bring my "crack" beans to the BBQ because they find them addictive.

Good flavor but EXTREMELY rich. Too much sugar for me. If you want some REALLY rich beans which are easy, these were great!

Delicious and loved the ginger flavor. I cooked the bacon in the microwave so it would be nice and crisp, then added the 2 T drippings to the pan and it worked well. Would definitely make these again.

I LOVE baked beans and think this is the best recipe I've found in ages. I went with the recommendation to reduce the ginger and loved the subtle flavor that remained. I'm making this for a football party today after rave reviews.

I have made this for our last 3 BBQ's and it's always a big hit. I cut the ginger in half, it's too overwhelming.

Yummy! As a southern girl living in Chicago, I don't really get good baked beans all that often. So, I have to make them myself. The thought of these make my mouth water. Definitely a winner. I served them to a guest who normally doesn't like baked beans and she asked for seconds.

I'm not a huge baked bean fan but these were terrific. Everyone enjoyed the unexpected zip of the ginger. I accidently shortcut the directions and didn't cook the bacon, onion and ginger before adding to the beans and it still came out great!

Good. Very much enjoyed. Used powdered ginger and was careful not to let it overpower the overall taste. May have been too conservative.

I could barely taste the difference between these and store-bought beans out of the can. the guests liked them, but I don't think I'd make them again.

Ginger gives a nice tang.

Easy to make! A unique twist on a common summer side dish! My family LOVED it! I can't wait to make it again. Because it was SO hot, and I couldn't stand the thought of turning on the oven. I use the crock pot and loved the way the flavors blended.

I made these for a party this past weekend to mixed reviews. The baked beans purists weren't fans of the ginger. However, the ginger lovers in the crowd loved these beans. Since DH and I are among the ginger lovers, I will definitely be making these again.

I prepared this recipe for a large party a few weeks ago, so I tripled the recipe. I also baked them a bit longer for a thicker consistancy. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and I was asked to make them again for an upcoming party to which we're invited. Even my grandmother said they were better than her own, which is an unprecidented rarity!

Used Bush's Original Beans. Loved the spicy Ginger! Fresh & Alive in the Mouth! The Best baked beans I've ever had.

I would make this again, but I would add more bacon. I couldn't quite pick it out among the other flavors and think it would have added a necessary savory balance to the sweetness of the molasses. I might also add a bit more fresh ginger, only because I like a lot of it.

This recipe was so easy and delicious, I would highly recommend it. I didn't add the fresh ginger because I didn't have any, but put a dash of dried ginger powder. I recently baked beans all day in the oven from scratch and truthfully, the amout of work involved, this recipe was just as good and sooo much easier.

My husband loves baked beans and he thought these were great. The ginger was a touch overpowering; I'd probably cut it back a bit next time.

I used vegetarian baked beans and turkey bacon. I couldn't find light molasses so I used dark molasses and reduced the amount by 1/4. I took this dish to a fourth of July picnic. Everyone raved about it.

This recipe was simple, wonderful and unique. Good marriage of flavors and not your normal baked beans.

I made the beans for a family barbeque and everyone loved them. I really liked the taste of the ginger. I will definitely make them again. I didn't leave the beans in for two hours because they were quite brown on top at the 1 1/2 hour mark.

Deicious. Very differnt and loved the ginger. Was well balanced in terms of flavor. Did make a change to the recipe. I used Vegetarian Baked Beans . I did use bacon to flavor it . Could also use turkey bacon, but it is hard to find in thick pieces,. Would just use a littke more. My husband was not nuts about the recipe and thinks I can do better.

This recipe lacks subtlety. We are big ginger fans but this is a bit much. The other flavors are muddied by the overpowering ginger and the recipe ends up just tasting "wrong", somehow. Not recommended.
