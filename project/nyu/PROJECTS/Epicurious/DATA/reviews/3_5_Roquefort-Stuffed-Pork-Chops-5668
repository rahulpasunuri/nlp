After reading several reviews, I was concerned that the chops might be a bit dry so I lowered the oven temp to 325 and brined the chops before stuffing -- didn't work; they were dry. I suggest less time. The stuffing is good thus the 2 forks.

i thought this was a very tasty recipe. instead of blue cheese or roquefort, i used a soft goat cheese. It added an amazing flavor. can't wait to make this for guests.

Kind of salty. Cheese leaks out and the cook time was way too long for my oven resulting in over cooked pork. I think there are better chop recipes out there

Not that this recipe needs another review but I was quite disappointed. The stuffing was superb but the loin chops were dry and tasteless. Tried this recipe because it was so highly rated and I had boneless chops from Omaha Steaks in the freezer. The 2 forks is for the stuffing.

Rating: 4
so good. thanks for all the great suggestions. I had thick boneless (about 2") chops. I tripled the stuffing and put the leftovers around the chops in the pan as others have suggested. I did not, however, increase the amount of blue cheese and only used the cheese to stuff the chops (my boyfriend doesn't like blue cheese, so I didn't want to push my luck - though he liked these chops!. I also deglazed the skillet with a nice malbec and some chx broth and it was divine with the chops. Thanks everyone for the tips!

WOW! I made this last night, step by step, and it was really good. I let a coworker taste what I had left today and he said "WHATS IN THIS?" I got the seal of approval. It was really easy to make, and I will be making it again. I did use Blue Cheese FYI, and I took a tip from a reviewer, I put the extra stuffing around the Chops in the oven, YUM..

Maybe I did something wrong (my french bread cubes were a little large), but I did not really enjoy this meal. I love all of the ingredients, so I thought this would be a sure winner, but ultimately found that this is not a keeper for me.

This was amazing. I substituted a lot, so I will not rate, but in the event that any one is out of a few things, I can assure that panko crumbs work great in lieu of french bread, gorgonzola is fab for the cheese, and leftover carmelized onions from pizza last week were delish. Same general taste as the recipe, I think, so I feel confident reporting that it was delicious. Followed other reviews re cooking time. I pan seared about 3 mins on each side, and then cooked 14 minutes at 350. Perfecto! I found the stuffing stayed in the chop a lot better by making a very small horizontal incision on the side of it, and then making a couple of sort of sweeping cuts inside. This made for maximum stuffing space, but minimum spillage. (I hope that made sense...it's late and I have a mild food coma).

I have a new favorite pork recipe. I brined the chops, always worthwhile. Deleted the salt in the stuffing, and deglazed with a little red wine, YUM

Rating: 0
As stated by other reviewers, make a little extra stuffing. Deglaze the pan in which you seared the chops with wine/chicken broth. Put the extra stuffing around the chops when you put them in the oven, and pour the liquid over everything. Makes the stuffing in the pan VERY tasty.

Am not sure the 194th review is worth reading, but I just loved this recipe. Yes, it takes a little time, but the rewards are many. I followed the recipe verbatim and am not sure what, if anything, I would change next time. And, yes, there definately will be a next time. This is a winner!

Rating: 4
Fabulous, fabulous flavors! Simple preparation, with extra stuffing that I also agree goes into the pan when you are ready to put the chops into the oven. Pouring wine over all only enhances the flavors of the gravy. I cheated and used a thermometer set to 155 degrees to give me leeway for carryover cooking to 160. Mine actually went to 164 and they were still moist and on the pink side - 2" chops. I set the chops on a plate and tented with foil while I added some low salt chicken broth to the pan, reduced the sauce, and thickened it. I've made this twice now and had lightly salted the mushrooms and onions the first time which was a mistake. I much prefer salting only the meat and the gravy if needed. A new family favorite that gives a WOW presentation! Great with chicken breast, too! Can't wait to try it with a butterflied pork tenderloin next!.

This is a true winner. I have made it several times and every time I am amazed at how easy and wonderful. I do deglaze the pan with wine and broth and pour over pork. Absolutely wonderful.

I've made this several times now and it's so easy and delicious that it has not only become a great entertaining go-to, but has also become part of our regular weeknight repertoire. Stuffing can be made a day in advance and chops can be stuffed a couple of hours before cooking. Served it recently with a store-bought onion & calvados confit, which was really the crowning touch.

Pork chops were on sale at my local meat market so I decided to make this recipe after reading many of the reviews written and how good it sounded. I actually used Gorgonzola cheese instead of the Roquefort as my wife does not like blue cheese or the such. I followed the advice of many of the reviewers and deglazed the pan with a cup of chicken stock and half a cup of white wine pouring it over the pork chops before baking them in the oven. I had leftover stuffing that did not fit into the pork chops so I added it to the pan and poured the deglazing sauce over it too. I chose to bake the pork chops at 325 for 30 mins and they were done perfectly and juicy and tender. My wife loved it and the stuffing was very tasty as well. Served with smashed new potatoes with cream and butter. Would definitely make again.

This was a very good recipe and I will definately put it on my list of favorite pork recipies. A great way to make pork chops. I made a red wine and chicken stock reduction while the pork was cooking. Added a rou and pan drippings at the end with a touch of red current jelly & pepper. Served with garlic mashed red potatoes(skins on) and a spinach salad. My chops were very thick, approx. 2"(Costco), so I did cook them according to the recipe. Wonderful flavors.

Really good - made according to recipe (minus the rosemary) and loved it. Made it again with shallots instead of the onion and used it as a topping for chicken - very good, too.

Rating: 4
I love this simple but rich dish. I sometimes deglaze the pan with wine, shallots and tad tomatoe paste. It doesn't need it but just for variation. I agree: add chicken broth to moisten when folding together. I cook them for 12-15 minutes.

Even though this is recommened as an "autumn" recipe I made it in April and it was delicious. I used baby bella mushrooms but don't think it would have made a difference-easy and delightful-I also served it to 2 people who claim they don't like mushrooms and they ate it up!

Rating: 4
These were easy to do, and tasted great. I did these at the last minute, so I used what I had. I used the Boursin garlic & fine herb cheese, the same amount. I only had three pork chopped, so I had extra stuffing. I put that in with the rest of the pork chops on the side, and that was almost better than what was inside. It was just a little bit crispy and was very tasty. I also just put it in a shallow baking dish rather than in the skillet. It was wonderful. I think this would be good stuffed inside a pork loin roast,

I loved it. My husband loved it.The roquefort was a great addition to the stuffing. I made a couple of small changes. I pan seared the chops before cutting them to create the pocket. Once I had seared them and stuffed them. I added a small amount of white wine to the roasting pan.

I use thick boneless chops and add prosciuto to the roquefort and bread crumbs. Then, after searing and while cooking in the oven, I add some white wine to help create a sauce. The sauce removes the dryness concern voiced by other reviewers.

Stuffing a hit, pork chops a miss! Call me a hick but nothing beats the old tried and true Shake and Bake! Always juicy with a touch of crisp. We love pork and I have tried every recipe. I even soaked these in milk for 4 hours, did the juice scaping with broth and wine only to wind up with less than tender chops! I am a trailer park trash Shake and Bake Queen forever!!!!

I made this for the family I work for and for the first time ever there were no left overs. I did add some white wine about ten minutes before pulling the pork from the oven, and a teeny bit more to deglaze the pan along with a splash of heavy cream as a sauce. All in all, it was yummy.

I love this recipe. It's an easy yet elegant weeknight dinner. To make it even easier, I add some bread crumbs to the mushroom mixture instead of the chopped bread. The chops have always come out moist and there is usually quite a bit of juice in the pan after cooking.I always get rave reviews when I make this!

Rating: 3
The recipe is good and quite elegant, but it definitely needs some sort of sauce or gravy. The pork chops although tasty tend to be a little dry with the breading. As a previous reviewer noted deglazing the pan and creating a sauce is a good idea, or I might also try a light cream and butter sauce to drizzle over the top....

So Good! Added prosciutto to the stuffing and used thyme instead of rosemary. Deglazed pan after sauteing and before putting in oven with 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken stock. After the oven, removed pork and strained pan juices. Added additional stock and reduced. Also doubled the stuffing and baked it separately with about 1/4 cup chicken broth. My husband loved it!

I've made this recipe quite a few times now and get stellar results every time. I sometimes add bacon to the stuffing to add a little extra flavor, but as is, this one's a winner. It's relatively easy to make, and smacks of meticulous preparation. Perfect for impressing someone special.

Fantastic. Proportions are exactly right. I'm just wondering how this recipe ended up in the "Too Busy to Cook" category - prep time excludes it from my quickie meal list. Anyway, pan deglazing with broth/wine mix is a must. I reduced 2 C liquid (sliced pears from a previous reviewer were a nice touch), poured over prepared chops, baked in dutch oven at 325 for 40 min. Picky eaters wanted to know if we could have dinner guests and serve these.

I've made this dish several times with great results. AFter the first time, I made a few changes one time I used Gluten free bread. Another time i used a different cheese, but the biggest change is making a pansauce with the drippings left in the pan. I simply deglaced the pan with some dry red wine, reduced it and added some butter to finish it. Delish!

Nice fall dish. Really easy! Takes no time. My complaint is that it needs a sauce. I followed the recipe to a tee and next time will probably reduce the remnants in the pan to make some sort of gravy.

Terrific complement for pork. I also added a little chicken broth to the stuffing, as well as a handful of Craisins. Since my oven wasn't available, after searing the chops, I low-simmered them in the same pan (with a lid on), in chicken broth, white wine, and thin-sliced granny smith apples. It created a marvelous, brown gravy. No deglazing necessary. My husband said it was the best pork chop he's ever had!

Easy to assemble. Next time I will cut the bread cubes very small, add more mushrooms and maybe less bleu cheese - a very strong flavor. The white wine is a must - what a nice sauce it all created with a little reduction. I recommend not seasoning the meat with salt; the cheese more than takes care of any need. After searing at a very high heat the meat was partially cooked. I covered with foil the whole baking time at 300 degrees. Instead of 25 minutes in the oven I will start checking at 15 minutes in the future. Maybe add some thinly sliced apples, as well?

Best stuffed pork chops I've made. Followed recipe using a couple of rater suggestions, cut bread in very small (3/8 ") cubes, used fresh rosemary and added a small amount of broth to the stuffing. Splashed some wine in the skillet, and loosely covered with foil for first 15 minutes. Chops were rib with bone in and had some marbling. I do not have good results with super lean pork such as Smithfield's New Generation. My advice is to avoid it.

I prepared this recipe as written, and was most pleased with the final outcome. What never ceases to amaze me are the comments from individuals that rate their attempts. The recipe, by the time numerous recipe changes and alterations have been made, does not resemble the original in the slightest. When I "try" a new recipe, I assemble all ingredients, fully prepped, in small cups, in order of their inclusion into the recipe. A recipe should be rated as written and the next time it is made, I make the necessary deletions or additions deemed necessary. I feel that rating a recipe that bears only the slightest resemblance to the original is very unfair.

It was an excellent dish. In place of the mushrooms I added finely diced zucchini and dried cranberries (drained) that I soaked in white wine. I then added that wine to the pan for the final baking stage. The pork was moist and delicious!

This was delicious. Per other reviewers' suggestion, I used about a half cup of dry white wine. Baking time was right at 25 minutes for chops that were 1 1/4 in. thick. I'd like to try this dressing to stuff veal. The suggestion to use Feta also sounds good.

Liked this a lot, but then again i LOVE roquefort.

This looked so good, but turned out a bit dry. Everyone said that it was delicious, but I really think it could have been more juicy- I did not pre cook it in the fry pan, so I don't think that was the reason. I think there are other ways to use good pork meat.

Rating: 3
I used a romano parsley french loaf, rather than plain. The additional flavor really made the difference. I also used beef broth in the roasting pan. Next time I will make a roqefort cream sauce to drizzle on top. I will also bake the extra stuffing mixture and serve it on the side.

Rating: 4
YUM - haute cuisine in the simplest form, your audience will think you're a genius. I used 2" chops, so followed the other cooks' sug to use chix stock, a definite must. If you have time, brining for 1 hr beforehand will ensure moist and delish pork. MUST REDUCE the TIME in oven - my chops came out perfectly with 20 min cooking, and I was using a double-thick cut.

Very good, very rich! Made cubes from a loaf of French bed, make sure you make the cubes very small. I made them larger and was a little hard to stuff pork chop. I really had to stuff the pork chop tight in order to cook in pan for two minutes on both sides before baking.

Rating: 3
Following tips from some other cooks, I added a bit of liquid... a nice California Port in this case. I used about a half a cup, and reduced it after the chops were done. Tasted great. Would have been better with slightly marbled pork instead of the lean stuff. Pretty good!

My boyfriend always loves my cooking, and so I was quite impressed when he told me that this was one of the best things that I had ever made him. It was almost a shame, as this was so easy! It was done in < 45 minutes. I used Roquefort and free range pork. Also, I baked the thing in a covered roasting pan where i had coasted the botton with red wine before hand. If I hadn't done this, the result might have been a bit dry. I would recommend using more marbled pork and also adding wine (perhaps mixed with a bit of stock to the bottom of the pan) in order to steam the meat during baking.

I made this recipe for dinner last night. My husband loved it - he had seconds; however, I was a little disappointed. I should have followed the suggestion of the Dutch Oven and chicken broth. The stuffing was delicious, yet the pork came out a little chewy. If there were a sauce that could be added to this recipe it would be even better.

Absolutely wonderful! I used bleu cheese instead of Roquefort. By following this receipe with only this substitution, the results were outstanding. I purchased boneless chops from our local butcher. I went just a bit thicker - about 1.5 inches rather than 1" on the chops and I had the butcher"pocket" rather than butterfly them for me. I suggest using a dutch oven to brown and bake this product.

For the holidays we recently had my family over - 14 people in all. This recipe was ubelievably easy to make for so many people. I made the stuffing ahead of time, and I double the amount that it calls for because its so delicious. We served this with a chardonnay. I also made a traditional caesar salad and garlic red-skinned mashed potatoes. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it - and for those who aren't into roquefort or bleu cheese, I skipped the cheese and added a bit of extra rosemary for more flavor. I will definitely make this again!

An all-star favourite with my friends and family. I've made it a couple of times and this last time, for Christmas, decided to follow the advice of people who'd reviewed it -- I added some chicken broth to the bread crumb mixture, I added some chicken broth to the skillet before it went into the oven, and I covered it with tin foil while in the oven, too. I also went with both shitake and portabello mushrooms for pizazz. It made ALL the difference in moisture and made me quite happy. So thank you, everyone!

I make this all the time for my husband and I. This is wonderful. Though it sounds a bit fancy, it is really tasty and simple food. My kids even like it. I use gorgonzola cheese since I can never find roquefort and I would definately never use bought bread crumbs..cube your own bread. It only takes a minute or two. Also, even if you are not a mushroom fan, PUT THEM IN THE RECIPE. I chop mine up extremely fine and never actually bite into one, but it certainly must help the flavor a lot!!

Outstanding recipe. I used the double cut loin chops from whole foods (about 2 inches thick). For the dressing I used Maytag blue. Definitely use fresh bread cubes. I sauteed the chops one at a time for about 2 minutes on each side on med-high heat. Finished them for 30 to 35 minutes @350 in a cast iron skillet. Deglazed the pan with white wine, reduced it then added a bit of heavy cream. I mixed in a teaspoon of the leftover dressing just before serving. These were great! very moist! Definitely will make this again.

Rating: 4
One of the best recipes I've tried here. I used a Bleu d'Auvergne, since Roquefort was too expensive. The milder, earthy and less salty flavor complemented the pork wonderfully. I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms, but the stuffing wasn't very fungal, but could use a little more butter and liquid to make the chops moister. I also covered the chops in the oven, so as to prevent their drying out. Could use a little more than just rosemary, but was otherwise one of the best (and cheapest) dishes I've served at a dinner party.

Rating: 3
I utilized a frenched rack of chops and found it easier to create the pouches for stuffing. I heeded the advice of other reviewers regarding the dryness of the dish. I added more mushrooms (16 oz.), about 1/3 more blue cheese and some added chicken broth following the saute of the vegetables, adding minced garlic and two tbsp of olive oil. After reducing the mixture, I continued with the stuffing of the chops. After the browning of the chops, I poured a few oz. of chicken broth into the baking dish. This was absorbed into the chops and resulted in a very moist and tender dish which drew raves from all. It was served with a spinach souffle and accompanied by a lovely pinot noir. This brought the recipe to a rating of four forks, a dish beyond compare, and will remain a meal for guests in the future.

So-so. Cooked only 18 min to 150 degrees, and still dry. Braising must be the way to go with pork chops.

I really liked the sound of this recipe and when I made it, it came out a little dry. I probably browned the chops too long. I would however make this again using a Blue Cheese instead. Next time I will make a gravy (maybe a mushroom type gravy)with it. The family did enjoy this recipe but did have ideas on making it just that much better.

this is an excellent and easy recipe! the stuffing is amazing and worth making on it's own to try with other meats. The pork dried out a little on me so next timw i may cover it for part of the roasting time but the stuffing makes this recipe worth it!! and make sure you use a high quality bread for the stuffing!

Wonderful! This was the easiest thing to make and it looks and tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen. I used boneless pork loins and they were extremely juicy and delicious and the stuffing was amazing. The extra stuffing I had left over, I baked and used as a side. Happy guests at my house! A definite keeper.

Wow! I was looking for a way to cook boring old boneless pork chops for a rainy evening. Used Maytag blue cheese. The chops came out of the oven very moist, and the mix of flavors in the stuffing was absolutely sublime. Not a whole lot of work for a really fabulous result.

I made these a long time ago for my entire family. I had forgotten about them. I asked my husband what he would like for our anniversary dinner and he wanted these, which I had forgotten all about, but he hadn't. They are reasonably easy to make and have wonderful flavor and are very tender. Some cheeses though, cause it to be a little salty- so be careful how much salt you add.

Easy and delicious, cutting the pork chop was the only hassle

Easy substitutions-any bread versus french bread any herb-I left out the rosemary and it was fine any cheese- I used danish blue. I used halved butterfly chops and the timing was perfect.

I would DEFINITELY make this dish again. Interesting combination of roquefort and rosemary, stuffing was fantastic!

Great recipe for pork chops. Very easy to make, and very tasty. Next time I will try different fillings, as others have suggested. This dish is a keeper.

Rating: 3
I've used a variety of cheeses and herbs. It is almost impossible to go wrong, just use whatever you have handy. Last time was a mix of Parmiggiano-Regianno, Fontina, pine nuts, and prosciutto. I have made this with and without bread crumbs too. It was fine either way.

Succulent! I used mild late winter garlic instead of the onion, gorgonzola cheese and did not brown the chops first. This was a big hit at my house!

I can't believe a dish as easy to make as this is so WONDERFUL! I would be afraid to ever order this in a restaurant, because they'd probably fuss with it too much and ruin it. This recipe is perfect just the way it is. (And I'm the type that usually always changes a recipe!)

Delicious! Perfect for the family (my young children loved it), but elegant enough for a dinner party. I added white wine and half and half to the pan drippings for a tasty sauce.

This was wonderful. We used gorgonzola as opposed to roquefort and fresh herbs instead of dried. We had stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and I made extra of the stuffing for a side.

Great way to prepare pork that turns out moist and delicious. Not the healthiest fare, but definately worth the indulgence!

Terrific recipe and so easy to clean up if you do it all in one skillet. I used blue cheese and fresh rosemary and had to bake for 40 minutes. Everyone I've made it for has loved it!

I made this last night using the rib chops and also used gorgonzola instead. Quick , easy recipe. Tasty. Nice enough for company.

Made this with Amish Blue Cheese crumbles, which added a lovely, slightly more salty taste and saved a little prep time. The thick-chop chops from our butcher cooked to perfection in 25 minutes on the dot. A keeper: rich, savory, and delicious.

Used 1 1/2" chops and Chevre instead of the Roquefort...was awesome. Definitely a keeper.

Great dish, will try again. Next time I will try with fresh herbs instead of dry. Even my picky son enjoyed it.

Rating: 4
To quote my husband, "Man! These are good Pork Chops!" We both hate mushrooms, so I substituted extra firm Tofu, and red pepper for them. It's really the cheese that puts these over the top for flavor. I too had about 1 1/2 - 2 inch chops, once seared and then baked, they were nice and juicy. I made a zucchini and potato side dish (also at Epcurious) to go along with this, a really nice hearty meal for 30 degree weather! I'll certainly make these again.

Rating: 3
GOOD FLAVOR, BUT I SUGGEST USING ONLY A THIRD THE AMOUNT OF BUTTER. THE BUTTER COMBINED WITH THE CHEESE MAKES IT TOO RICH.

Rating: 4
I've made this one several times now. I found that a thicker chop works better. I had my butcher cut a 1 1/2" to 2" thick boneless chop and he cut the pocket for me. I reduced the oven time to about 20 minutes too (even for the thicker chops). You'll have leftovers, but that's OK, these are great cold or reheated!

Rating: 4
This is a tasty way to prepare pork chops. The recipe left me with quite a bit of the stuffing left over, but I just served it on the side. 25 minutes was too long in the oven - 15 to 20 is more like it. My husband and son want me to make this on a regular basis.

Rating: 4
This dish was wonderful with a few modifications. I added apples and white wine when cooking up the stuffing. While the pork was baking, I cooked up the remaining apple I had with some butter, pinot grigio, and cinnamon and served it on top of the pork. The drippings from the pan made a nice "sauce." My fiance raved about it.

Rating: 4
I found that I didn't really need the 25 minutes of baking time on the pork and that the bread cubes might work better as bread crumbs but don't use as much. This is a wonderful dish!

My husband, never especially complementary about a meal that doesn't involve steak, raved about this one. Served with steamed asparagus and (I'm a cheater) Uncle Ben's wild rice, this was an elegant meal that took very little time or effort.

I have prepared this recipe three times now with a few variations, my favorite with dried cranberries. Excellent everytime!

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Did make one change. I could not throw away all of the yummy drippings in the pan after baking. Deglaze the pan with some white wine, cook that down, then add a bit of butter to add some body to the sauce. The resulting sauce is quite rich, a little goes a long way.

I love beef tenderloin stuffed with blue cheese and this looked like an interesting twist. It was wonderful. My husband loved the stuffing and wants me to save the recipe to make another day.

Very good! I looked it up again to make it for a neighbor who just had a baby - special occasion but easy to make!

I only used gorgonzola instead of roquefort. This is a great recipe! Definitely nothing bland about it and easy enough to make on a week night.

Rating: 3
I followed the suggestions of several others, using Gorgonzola instead of Roquefort, adding 1 diced apple, 1/2 tsp thyme, & 1/2 tsp marjoram. I would never describe this dish a mediocre! These pork chops were scrumptious! Next time I plan to add pears too.

Rating: 2
Terribly disappointing! I chose it based on the great reviews, but re-reading them, the good reviews come from people who didn't actually follow the recipe! I am a bit of a food snob, but pork chops stuffed with plain old cooked Stove Top stuffing rates higher in my book. Maybe I should be adding Roquefort to that instead . . . This recipe was definitely not worth the effort!

Rating: 2
Thought this was good, but it needed a kick. Very mediocre in my book. Definately save this one for winter--IT'S HEAVY.

Rating: 4
This has become one of our favorite pork chop recipes. Some changes: I use goat cheese instead of roquefort. I buy two extra thick chops but make the same amount of stuffing. After stuffing and browning the chops, I spread the extra stuffing around them in the pan, and then bake in the oven as directed. For the bread cubes, I use pain de mie, a little twist on French bread that they sell at Standard Baking here in Portland. Finally, I do the baking step on the grill, not the oven, which gives an added little smoky taste. These are great..there is never even a crumb leftover.

Rating: 3
I altered the recipe a little. Instead of roquefort cheese I used gargonzola and rosemary is not one of my favorites, so I substituted fresh thyme and majoram, also added apples. It was very tasty, even my picky husband said he liked it and told me to make it again. mmm mmm good!

Rating: 3
Made a similar dish with pesto stuffing, worked very well. Advice for the person whose chops turned out dry: (1) brine the pork chops first: immerse them in a solution of water, salt, sugar, and whatever herbs or seasonings you like for a few hours. (Ratios of water to salt and water to sugar should both be about 25:1.) The salt helps conduct moisture (and other flavors) into the meat, which then remains juicier when cooked. Make sure to dry them well before sauteing (and you can then skip the step of salting the surface). (2) Don't cook them for 25 minutes in the oven. I found a quick browning of 2-3 minutes on a side plus between 15 and 20 minutes in a 350 oven was plenty -- get a good digital instant-read meat thermometer, take the chops out when they're 145-150 in the center (trichonosis is killed at 137), let them rest, covered with foil, for 5 minutes before serving and they'll be great.

The stuffing was great! My boyfriend doesn't like blue cheese but he loved this. My pork chops were a little dry...any suggestions?

Rating: 4
This dish was great! The pork and the stuffing turned out wonderfully moist and juicy. I added a half a chopped apple and a glove of garlic, thinly sliced. The only drawback may have been that the strongly flavered stuffing overwhelmed the lighter taste of the pork. I'm wondering if the stuffing wouldn't pair better with beef somehow.....

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!! I doubled the stuffing recipe, added apple to the saute, and browned the pork (I used pork sirloin fillets, rolled, like braciola) in olive oil with a little minced garlic before baking, with a little white wine in the bottom of the baking dish. My boyfriend LOVED it, I thought it was very easy to make. Served it with mashed potatoes and spinach salad.

My husband and I loved this recipe. He usally hates stuffing but he loved this one. I love gorgonzala so I substiyuted that for the blue cheese. Very good!

What a delicious dinner! I used Stilton instead of Roquefort, green onion instead of regular onion, and a Portuguese roll instead of French bread. I think next time I'll toast the bread cubes instead of sauteing them in butter and save those precious grams of fat!

Rating: 4
Had to improvise and use chicken breasts tied with kitchen string rather than pork, gorgonzola instead of roquefort, olive oil in place of butter and doubled up on the stuffing recipe. My husband took one bite and yelled "Damn, this is tasty chicken"! He who is a stuffing snob then declared "this is the best stuffing i've ever had"! I felt it needed a sweet side dish to offset it like Epicurious' Kale sauteed with Apple and Onion which is also phenomenal. No doubt i'll be asked to make this dish again soon!

Rating: 3
Great recipe, I used thinner chops as that was all they had at market. Agree that covering is better until last 5-10 minutes. I also used more onion than recommended (1/2 onion total). I served it with garlic roasted mashed potatoes and some steamed asparagus, and everyone was very happy!

Rating: 3
Great simple do-ahead dish! I didn't have enough gorgonzola,(an Italian staple) so I added in 1/2 goat cheese. I also added some chopped flat leaf parsley(another Italian staple) to brighten up the flavor. The extra stuffing(I never measure) was great to top the chops with, and I agree that it needs to be covered with foil in the oven until the last 5 minutes. Can't wait to try this with chicken. I'd also add, next time, chopped toasted pecans or almonds for a little more texture.

Rating: 4
LOVE this recipe. We make it at least once a month and for company. In my opinion we have perfected it by using gorgonzola cheese instead of the blue cheese etc. The chops are never too dry - and sometimes I even use canned bread crumbs if in a hurry. This is a keeper.

This was very good. Looked elegant and tasted wonderful. I will definitly make this again

This is a great pork recipe. We've used pork chops as well as pork roast, cut into chop thickness & both were great. One of our guests said it's the best pork chop she's ever had!

Where did all the flavor go? Maybe I should blame the blue cheese I used instead of real roquefort, but I found this dish to be terribly disappointing. The chops were too dry even though I covered the pan with foil and reduced the cooking time to its bare minimum, and I felt that in a sense the bread in the stuffing took away some of the taste.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! My husband, who hates pork chops, said these were unbelievably great. The stuffing is so unique. I substituted the Roquefort for bleu cheese, just a personal preference. Definitely an impressive and tasty entree for guests.

Everyone loved this recipe, my husband is a little shy of strong cheese, so I substituted goat for the roquefort, and added dried cranberries and apples to the saute in the stuffing. Fantastic. I used 1/2 inch pork chops and reduced the cooking time in the pan just to sear them (hot hothot!)(30 seconds) and then transferred them to a buttered caserole dish and cooked them for 20 min under tinfoil. they came out super jucy!!

Rating: 4
Mouthwatering! Because of the rave reviews I doubled the recipe. Used twice as much onion and fresh rosemary from garden. Sauteed the chops in olive oil because butter burns at high heat. Covered with foil to bake as advised. Roasted asparagus in the same oven. Next night since all the "hard" work was done I made garlic mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and a Tarte Tatin! Thanks Epicurious for another great recipe and all reviewers for perfecting it!

Rating: 4
This was an amazing recipe like everyone has posted. I used Roquefort cheese and portabello mushrooms. I covered the pork chops with foil and they still came out a little dry but it was still so amazing. I put garlic salt on the pork chops instead of regular and made twice the stuffing which is a must. The best online recipe I've tried.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was a definite Keeper! My picky husband loved it. Very tasty! When baking the chops, definitely cover them so they stay juicy and tender. Also, a good recipe to make ahead of time and just refrigerate until your dinner guests come. (I threw the extra stuffing in the pan to bake with the chops).

We LOVED this recipe. I didn't have any French bread and so I cubed some Bavarian Rye and subbed it in with great results. I was glad I made extra stuffing because there wasn't a bit left over. My husband, himself a darn good cook, commented repeatedly that the whole dish was simply delicious. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. I'd give it more forks but I can't rate pork chops a "dish beyond compare!"

This recipe got a big thumbs-up from my very picky husband. We both agreed that the stuffing should be cooked in a seperate dish. Also, the cheese provides plenty of salty flavor, so we left the salt out.

This was very good. Did anyone cover the dish while in the oven? I wondered if it would make it a little more moist. I will definitely make it again. Made it for the second time and it's definitely a keeper if you like blue cheese. I just made this for the second time and didn't have mushrooms but it was still excellent!

I used this stuffing for chicken breasts. Excellent! This to me is more of a winter dish with its robust flavors in the stuffing. Would definitely make for company.

Oh me, Oh my! What a wonderful dish! This was just fabulous. We used two ridiculously thick (2") pork chops, and increased the baking time to 40 minutes. Used Stilton cheese, and covered the baking dish for the first 30 minutes. This kept the chops moist. "The best flavor!" was my husband's verdict. We made the whole stuffing mix but only two chops. Threw whatever wouldn't fit in the chops in the baking dish, and 5 minutes before it finished, we scooped up the juicy filling and piled it on top of the chops. The last 5 minutes uncovered crisped it up, and...HEAVEN. Make this dish. Now.

This was very good. I love blue cheese but found that this dish tasted too strongly of it. I would cut down the cheese by a 1/4. Other than that, it was absolutely delicious. My significant other isn't overly found of blue cheese but enjoyed this dish.

I had a boneless pork loin in the freezer that I sliced into 1" thick chops and butterflied. My son isn't crazy about roquefort cheese, so I saved part of the stuffing and used smoked mozzerella instead, which turned out to be delectible! We also grilled the stuffed chops over hickory chunks that had been reduced to a glow. It was a memorable meal that I'll do again.

This is a great stuffed chop recipe, with great savory flavors. We increased the amount of blue cheese (using Saga just because we had it on hand). I served horseradish mashed potatoes and green beans w/ carmelized onions along side the pork. My husband choose a rustic Chianti and a splendid Barbera; both complimented the pork, cheese and earthy flavors well. Definitely try this; it's an easy Saturday night company dish- cooks quickly and is impressive.
