I add caraway seeds and chopped cabbage to the chicken dish and it really adds a lot of flavor from the caraway and a little more healthy aspect to the dish. I also use tomato paste instead of sauce and low fat sour cream. I've served this at dinner parties and everyone loves it and no one knows it's all low fat. I also serve over whole wheat noodles.

This is delicious! I add caraway seeds and chopped cabbage to the chicken while cooking. I also use skinless thighs with the bone in , tomato paste instead of sauce and chicken broth. I finish it with low fat sour cream and serve over whole wheat noodles. Fantastic. I've served this at dinner parties and no one knows this is low fat and healthy.

This is delicious! I also used chicken stock in lieu of the water. I do recommend you stick with the cut up chicken with the skin instead of the boneless, skinless cuts. The flavor will be more intense. The cooking times provided in the recipe were right on, the chicken was cooked through and certainly not dry. If your worried about the fat, have a salad for lunch! The noodles are a good pairing with butter and parsley. I saved this to my recipe box and will enjoy on a regular basis.

I made some minor changes (boneless/skinless chicken breasts, cooked for less time to avoid overcooking, and as others suggested, low salt chicken stock in place of water). Result: delicious sauce, moist, tender chicken, family loved it. Very straightforward - From start to finish, including preparing riso "risotto" and steamed broccoli, dinner was on the table in 45 minutes. Not bad, considering it took me 70 minutes to get home from work!

Simply delicious! I made a few minor changes: I added a bit of sugar because I didn't have sweet paprika. I also put the sauce in the blender (to smooth out lumps and bumps from onion and garlic), then returned the sauce to the pan to be heated through with the cooked chicken. Then I swirled in the sour cream. We licked our plates, and it reminded me of the paprikas I ate in Budapest.

Quite delicious. I likewise used the chicken broth substitution. I also used skinless chicken, a combination of breasts, thighs, and tenders (I just don't eat chicken skin - cholesterol issue) and it works fine. Will definitely make again.

Yummers! This recipe was excellent!! My 5, 7 and 9 year old girlies LOVED it. I followed the other reviewers suggestions about using the chicken stock, and VOILA, yummy perfection. Instead of noodles or rice, I served on quinoa. Great Thursday night meal.

This was fantastic! I was caught myself licking my fingers with this one. It was also a huge hit with my boyfriend and my dad!

Tasty recipe worth adding to the rotation. Agree with other reviewers that substituting chicken stock for the water added good flavor. Used chicken breasts (with bones & skin on) and added a pinch of smoked paprika.

This is a very straight-forward and satisfying dish. I, too, used chicken broth, and extra Hungarian paprika both during the cooking and at the end before serving. I sauteed some sweet bell peppers and sliced mushrooms along with the onions and garlic. I served it over a brown rice pilaf as we did not have wide egg-noodles in the pantry. Not a drop of sauce or chicken left over for the family still prowling around the stove.

Very good basic recipe. I made a few changes to make the flavor a bit more rich. I added a can of low salt chicken stock before adding the chicken back into the pot to cook. I did cook about 45 minutes and then cooled/removed the meat from the bones while I reduced the remaining sauce. Also, when finishing the sauce with sour cream, I added about 1 Tbls. more Paprika. There's something about the flavor that's cooked in that is augmented by adding a bit more at the end. Very easy dish that the entire family enjoys.

Turned out great. Delicious dish, comparable to what my grandmother used to make... and that's saying something.

Great, simple meal. I made in a crockpot and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch. Also, I removed the chicken from the bones and added back to the sauce before the final prep with sour cream. If serving for guests, it's worth the extra time to do this.

I used only half the amount of sour cream that the recipe called for and still found it to be extremely rich and delicious

I loved this dish! I did not change a thing in the recipe. One does need to know that it is the Paprika that makes the dish, so don't skimp on buying cheap Paprika.

A perfect dish for the winter months. Not gourmet looking, but very good served family style. I will definitely be making this dish again - frequently!

Oh yeah, I also simmer it a bit longer than it calls for and use double the garlic. It would be 3 1/2 stars, if that were an option. (see previous review)

This is SO easy and yummy. I usually use either hot paprika or add a little cayenne because we like heat. I use bone-in thighs, but remove the skin (not for health reasons - we just don't like mushy thigh skin!). It's easy as can be to just rip off the skin. Once, I used boneless skinless breasts cut in half because that's all I had on hand, and it came out fine. This is a dish we make often, because we usually have all the ingredients on hand.

My husband is hard to please. He said it was delicious. He doesn't want me to cook with garlic. I didn't use garlic, but followed everything else. I thought it was excellent. I'm not much of a cook so I appreciated the times for each step.

I have been looking for a good Chicken Paprika recipe and this is it. I did drain all the grease from the pan after sauteing the chicken and replaced with a little olive oil. Next time I will let the sauce simmer a little longer for a thicker sauce.

Man oh Man! I urge you to try this very comfy, homey, everybody feels good about everybody at the table kind of dish. I mixed sweet paprika with hot paprika, used 6 boneless breast halves and 4 legs with thighs and there was still a lot of sauce to spoon over the extra wide noodles. I served this with sweet and sour cucumbers with dill from this site and crusty bread. Also, I made this on Sunday and served it to my family on Tuesday night. A great make-ahead.

My husband had chicken paprikas at a restaurant a few weeks ago and we thought we'd try it at home. This recipe was very easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce, but cooked the chicken (skinless breasts) in our pressure cooker and then added it to the sauce and let it simmer for a about 15 minutes.

I made this for dinner last night and my family loved it. They couldnt stop coming into the kitchen because of the savoury aroma's. Used 4 boneless chicken breasts and 3 legs with thighs attached. Will use one more breast and 2 or 3 legs next time as there was loads of yummy sauce. Good simple family food. Served with homemade egg noodles and crisp green salad and crusty buns. Fab!

I made it for a few coworkers and they about fainted over its creamy goodness. Using a quartered chicken with the skin on made the chicken extra moist. Simplicity at its best.

I made this last night and we really enjoyed it, not spectacular but I don't think it's trying to be anything more than a good family meal. Added 2 roasted red peppers to the onion and garlic and upped the garlic, also added 1tsp of sweet smoked paprika, served with white rice with peas tossed in. Yum Yum

This was quite good...I, too, used boneless skinless chicken breasts, but first added four pieces of bacon to my saute pot to brown the chicken, and then saute the onions, etc, for more authentic flavor. (I removed the bacon, and used it crumbled in the salad I served) Also garnished with dill. Used half and half sweet Hungarian paprika, and half sharp Hungarian paprika. Would have used a bit of smoked paprika, but didn't have any on hand. Would have used more of the spicier paprika had I not been making it for my inlaws who can only tolerate a bit of spiciness. This didn't make too much sauce...about right, I thought...plenty to sop up with egg noodles. Yum. Served my Hungarian great aunt's noodles, egg noodles cooked in chicken broth, tossed with butter, bread crumbs, and caraway. VERY tasty. More carbs than we usually eat around here, but my mother in law had just run a marathon, so what the hey! Great dinner for chilly day.

I used Hungarian sweet paprika and served the paprikas with spaetzle. The flavor was very good on a cold, winter evening. I made cucumber salad in vinegar as a side dish.

For a truer Hungarian flavor, I used bacon fat instead of oil and fresh dill instead of parsley. Also, I upped the sour cream a bit to make the sauce richer, more tangy. This was good. Not great, but good.

I liked it, however, there was a little too much oil in the sauce for my taste. I believe the next time I make it I will take the skin off of the chicken and serve it with white rice instead of noodles.

I made this dish for company and everyone really enjoyed it. I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken and added a bit more paprika. It was different and I will definitely make it again.

i really wanted to love this recipe. unfortunately, it wasn't very memorable. i used a whole chicken, cut into serving portions and increased the paprika times 2. the meat was tender and the sauce was rich, but it lacked any real distinct flavor. the paprika didn't show through the braised chicken/tomato taste, and i even threw in 3 fresh hungarian spicy peppers for good measure.

I liked the dish, although it was a little greasy, I think I would make it without the skin on the chicken next time and add less oil in the begining.

This was a good, authentic-tasting paprika chicken. I added mushrooms 10 minutes before the end of the dish and cooked the sauce 15-20 minutes to thicken the sauce. Very satisfying.

Just like Hackettstown, I spent the evening listening to the icy rain and snow hit the windows. Dinner was chicken paprikas and couldn't have been more perfect on a blistery winter night. Did not change the recipe and found it to be simple to make with great results. And as other reviewers have commented, this recipe is a fine example of basic ingredients that result in a well balanced dish.

This is simple good food that's especially perfect for a cold snowy night. I served this with a big tossed salad and crusty French bread. It's a good thing I doubled the recipe since everyone had seconds. I always get a kick out of "isn't it a small world" stories, and the fact that the creator of this recipe lives less then 15 miles from me was an added treat.

This was one of the best dishes I've tried in a long time.I used white rice instead of the noodles and it worked great. My husband really enjoyed it as well and so I will be most certainly be making this dish again.

Great recipe. We used chicken breasts with skin and bones; there was very little fat remaining in the pan to saute the onions and garlic. So for us it wasn't oily at all as a previous reviewer had commented. I also added mushrooms as suggested in a previous review. Delicious over wide egg noodles.

I LOVED this chicken! I am a hard to please foodie but this meal didn't disappoint one bit. I will make it again - maybe even for company on a family dinner style kind of night. I will definitely make this again.

If you have the ingredients, time ,and nothing better to do, this is entirely edible. More pepper, more garlic, and more onion are required (triple onion, double garlic). It's good. Edible, but not exciting.

this recipe is the perfect example of simple ingredients that blend together beautifully. I followed the directions exactly and came up with a nice creamy sauce and moist chicken. Next time i might try to get my hands on some imported paprika instead of the generic one i had at home. Great comfort food served over egg noodles. Will definitely make again.

This was a very easy and tasty meal. I would make a few minor revisions next time I make it though. It seemed a little greasy...I will try draining some of the oil after the chicken is cooked. Also maybe I would add a little less water. I had to add extra heavy cream to thicken it more...and suspected that I had put too much water in. I will also add mushrooms next time...but that's a personal taste thing.

We tried this last night for a mid-week dinner. Perfect for a rainy night.
