Found this very nice. You might want to double the amount of curry if you like a more "Indian" flavor. Additionally, I thin sliced one large sweet onion, grilled it in a basket with some olive oil and kosher salt, then added this back into the sauce.

While I am not a real fan of rib eye, this was simply delicious. The mushrooms made the meal - the flavors were subtle and yummy. I will use variations on this theme whenever I saute mushrooms in the future.

This was very good. Before I added the tomato paste or mushrooms, I used a bit of the oil mixture to coat the steaks prior to grilling. A really nice flavor combo! I also made the herbed grilled potatoes and it was a great hit. I served it with some sliced summer tomatoes. Will definitely make again!

A GREAT alternative way to present ribeye! I made only two ribeyes, but the whole recipe for the mushrooms and my husband and I ate every bite. I used all ingredients listed, but slightly increased the garlic and ginger, and doubled the cilantro. I would gladly make this again for summer company.
