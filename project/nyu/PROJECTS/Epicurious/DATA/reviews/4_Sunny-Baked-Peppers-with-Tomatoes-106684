This is so beautiful an tasty. Use the anchovies - they add just the right savory element.

I make this all the time, although I use more garlic. I poke holes in the bottom of the peppers to let some of the juices drain and use balsamic glaze to finish.

Quite tasty! I made this as the recipe is written the first time, then added feta (around halfway through the cooking time) the next - delicious!

This dish looks great, makes the house smell wonderful, and impresses our guests. We do skip the anchovies, but that's just our preference. Wish the picture from Parade magazine was on the recipe--the dish is so attractive!
