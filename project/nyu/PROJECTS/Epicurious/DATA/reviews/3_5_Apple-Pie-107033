This is the best apple pie I've tasted (and made) in years! Be sure to use a combination of apples. I used 2 granny smith, 2 fuji, and 2 honeysweet. The flavor was incredible. Also substituted tapioca as a thickener instead of flour, because I froze the pie before baking.

this recipe is simple and easy to make. Apple pie does not need to be complicated and this recipe makes a classic apple pie. I've used this recipe time and time again and it never fails to impress.

this pie was great. I usually cut the sugar recipes call for as most things end up way too sweet, but I made this one as written and it was the perfect amount. I forgot to peel the apples but it really doesn't matter (it's not as pretty if you look very closely but it tastes the same). And it got rave reviews from my family as well.

This is the worst apple pie I have ever tasted. Literally, inedible. Guests could not swallow it. I know how to bake and am not shy in the kitchen. It was so sour that it tasted like it was fermented. It's in the garbage now.

this was fabulous! Crust was easy and delicious. I used home picked apples and have no idea what they were but they cooked down a fair bit, I'd use more than the recipe calls for so the pie isn't half empty. I cut the sugar to 1/2 c and doubled the lemon zest. I'm not sure I'd go as low on the sugar as some are suggesting, it's a dessert after all. also used cinnamon sugar on the top of the pie.

I used this recipe to bake with when my sons went apple picking for school... It was DELICIOUS! The only difference was I substituted allspice with nutmeg (only b/c I didn't have allspice) ;) It was so easy, and my kids really liked helping mix up the apples and spices! ... I also made applesauce with the leftover apples...

Fantastic apple pie! Like others, I added a little extra spice & lemon. I used half Macintosh, half Gala apples & they were a great combo. The pie is also beautiful, which is always a nice bonus to great taste! The only note I would make is to significantly reduce the sugar. Maybe use 1/3 or 1/4 cup, depending on your apples. I used less than the 2/3 cup called for & it was still way too sweet. Oh, and the pastry is to die for, flaky perfection!

I made this pie for my grandfather after his heart surgery (what a wonderful granddaughter I am!) and he said it was the best he's ever tasted. The man has been known in our family for loving all things apple, so I knew for sure something was right with this. Before the apple mixture is even baked it smells and tastes wonderful. The egg and sugar on top makes the pastry top golden and crunchy.

I am a novice at cooking and this was the first time I ever made apple pie. This recipe was easy to follow, and the pie turned out great when done. I cut down the sugar from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup, as I wanted to add some raisins. I used my mother in law's recipe for the dough. Everyone thought it was great.

The crust was absolutely fabulous! So flakey! My husband thought the lemon was too much - I didn't mind it. I did think that it could have used more liquid. Next time I will add more liquid

This was a great recipe, just like my grandma's! I was working with little girls, so instead of making one pie, we used 8 little frozen pie tart crusts, cut the apples into little 1/2-inch pieces, and split the apple mixture amongst the pie tarts. Then we covered the pie tarts with the pastry dough and pinched the edges to seal them together. The girls used pieces of dough to make their initials or cut designs into their pie tops, to identify which pies were whose when they came out of the oven. The pies were delicious and they had so much fun making them themselves! We had a little apple mixture left over, so we used the remaining pastry dough to roll the apple mixture up, fold it closed on the ends, make little knife cuts in the top, brush it with the leftover beaten egg, and sprinkle sugar over the whole thing. Then we baked it with the pies until it was golden brown. They had a little streudel for breakfast the next morning!

This was a wonderful reciepe. Everything turned out great. The only thing that I could've done better was to peel the apples. I forgot to do that!! I added a bit more of the allspice and cinnamon, for personal preference, and it was delicious. Great recipe!

A delicious apple pie that is very quick and easy to make. I changed a few ingredients for personal taste using brown sugar in the apple mix, extra lemon juice (1 lemon), only 1/2tsp grated lemon peel, replaced 1 tblsp of flour with almond meal and the spicyness and texture were perfect. To finish I sprinked both brown sugar and white sugar on top with a sprinkle of cinnamon.

unfortunately i made the mistake of cutting the apples into roughly 14 wedges, rather than 10. after cooking for an hour, the inside was like applesauce. (i used granny smith apples.) highly recommend others either cook it for shorter period or ensure apple wedges are sufficiently thick.

I love this pie! I have to say, I made a couple of adjustments -- I used half dark brown sugar and half white sugar. I also put in about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. It worked very well.

I used my usual all-butter crust, so I can only rate the filling of the pie. It really liked the lemon juice, and the amount of spices and sugar was right. I used a mix of Gala and Cortland apples, and it turned out perfect.

I tried this to see how the lemon zest would work; it was too much for a mix of apples that tended to the tart side (incl some Bramleys, the standard English cooking apple). If including acidic varieties again, I would add sweet raisins or cut the lemon elements by half.

This is the best apple pie I've ever made or eaten. The genuine Grandma's old fashioned apple pie.

This recipe earned me my position as the "official pie maker" at all future family functions. I tried making the crust myself twice but both times the ingredients sunk down and the crust stayed shaped like a dome (so I had a pie that was mostly empty on the inside). What did I do wrong? I finally gave up and now I use store bought crust. Even with the freakish crust, this pie was awesome!!!

This recipie is the closest I have been able to find to my grandmother's apple pie. Along with the lemon zest and juice I add a little bit of orange zezt and juice. I also add a little bit more cinnimon than is calls for and I don't always do the egg wash on the top of the crust. It comes out delicious every time. As for the people who seriously think the crust calles for an egg...THE WORDS "PASTRY DOUGH" IS A LINK TO THE RECIPIE FOR THE PASTRY DOUGH! Sheesh. If it's that hard to figure out then you deserve a scrambled egg pie crust.

I submitted my comments on the pie dough recipe as well. I might have given this filling recipe four forks too, except this was the first pie I ever made and have nothing of mine to compare it to. My mother and sisters make great pies and I would not hesitate to serve this to them. I like the balance of sweet and tart apples. I look forward to making more pies soon.

Very easy, no frills apple pie (the best kind!). I was reading the reviews and saw the one from Pittsburgh. Being born and raised in Pittsburgh myself I am sorry to see such stupidity in print and even sorrier that this so called "cook" and "computer person" is serving on the city council and has such personal contacts that he/she is baking pies for the mayor! Next time you have to serve dessert to the mayor - get yourself to Prantl's in Shadyside and buy a pie!

As chief "pie baker" for 35 years of family Thanksgivings, I found the recommended fresh lemon zest added nice zing to my own famous apple pie. Always open to tweaking my recipes! But MY O MY, how sad & ironic that some previous irate reviewers--apparently rank beginner cooks who found it necessary to "look up" how to bake an elementary apple pie--were chastising those unfamiliar with hyperlink use. Who's the real "dummy" here?

A mother's day success, even with store bought pie crust. Used 4 granny smiths and 4 pears. Sprinkled a mix of sugar and cinnamon on the top. And did need to pop some foil over the top at the end of baking, so it wouldn't over-brown. Served with vanilla ice-cream, of course. Made a loud family very quiet for a while!

Very good pie that was simple and easy to create. My bake time was much less then indicated, so be sure to watch your pie. Good note: wrap the edge of crust with tin foil after it browns (15-20 minutes)

I made this pie without the lemon zest, and with a latticed top crust. I place several pats of butter underneath the top crust, and sprinkle sugar liberally over the beaten egg. It's incredible! This is my standby apple pie recipe now, and family keeps requesting it!

It was a rainny Sunday afternoon we couldn't work out in the gsrden so we decided to make apple pies. My friend downloaded this recipe from your site. We almost didn't make because of the crust recipe. Yikes! So I made the crust and she made the filling. We made 4 pies. They were indisribable. The crust was amazing. So flakey it was like phyllo .Her husband said "kill me now I'm in Heaven"!

This is my favorite apple pie recipe. I've tried it with Granny Smith or Winespa with Jonagold or Fuji and it's been wonderful each time. The first time I made it I thought it was a little lemony, so I've been substituting a bit of zest from a navel orange for the lemon zest with great success.

This is not so much a review, but rather a comment. I haven't tried this recipe, but based on the "so called" reviews, it looks like some people are in need of a computer class. Dare I trust these reviewers with a recipe when they don't have the first clue on how to access a web page? I will try the recipe though & comment later. And to you in Pittsburgh, try looking for a clue on the internet.

To the cook in Pitts, PA- I think most people who were making a pie would actually know what pastry dough was. If they didn't, they would surely have eaten a pie before and known that they were not eating pancakes. It is definitely not the fault of Epicurious that you were ignorant of what you were making. If you didn't know, ask. It's your fault for assuming.

This recipe is a disaster just waiting to happen. Since the good folks at Epicurious.com "conveniently" omitted the "Pastry Dough" dough recipe, I am the laughing stock of my neighborhood. I thought that using pancake batter would be a good substitute for "pastry dough," but boy oh boy was I wrong. What was supposed to be a special dessert for the Mayor of my town turned out to be a disgusting mess. The "pie" as they call it, was not pie but a burned, cement-like, non-flaky, too-sweet, wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, MESS! How DARE Epicurious publish such a so-called "recipe." I'm immediately canceling my subscription. As for the Mayor, he brought up my "pie" at a City Council meeting and now I may have to "move" due to the "shame" and "humiliation."

Even better. Go to the supermarket and buy the crust already made! I usually buy the store brand and roll it out a little more. Then you don't have to worry about going back and forth to which ever recipe!

None of us was born knowing how to use a computer, although some seem to have forgotten that. To print a recipe, click on "Printer-ready recipe" at the top of the page. When recipe appears again, click on "File" at the very top left corner of your screen. A list appears. Find and click on "Print" in the list. To return to the recipe, click on "Back" at the top of your screen (might have to do more than once). If nothing happens when you click on "Back", try clicking on the "x" in the upper right-hand corner." If you still don't get the recipe back, you might have to start over by typing in "Epicurious.com" and once there searching for "Gourmet Apple Pie".

Alan, Another great way to substitute for the sugar in this recipe (for diabetics) is something I learned from Cooking Light magazine. When I bake an apple pie, instead of using sugar I boil down two cups of apple cider into a 1/2 cup. It becomes sweet and syrupy and keeps the apples really moist in the pie. Hope that helps!

I have been making this pie (with one change) for several years and always to great response. The one thing I had to change was because most of my family is diabetic. The small amount of sugar in the crust is no problem, but I have found that the best substitute for sugar in the recipe is 3/4 of a cup of one of the no sugar added all-fruit marmelades. The best response is normally when I use All-fruits appricot, but orange works very well also, I also add 1/2 cup of currants.
