Just what a body needs when craving Spring.Made a half recipe and was amazed how delicious this concoction is with so few ingredients. Could I add leek bottoms to enrich? Certainly,were they already on hand. A swirl of dairy(creme fraiche, sour cream or heavy cream) wouldn't hurt either. Doesn't change the fact that even w/o those enrichments the soup makes one smile.

I took this recipe at face value and chopped 6 very large shallots, which made a LOT more than 1.6 cups - about 5 of them gave me close to 3 cups. I used maybe 1.5 cups and they totally overwhelmed the delicate taste of the peas. Next time I'll use one cup.

Very nice fresh pea taste. I'd stick to the recipe.

Excellent - way better than I expected. I used fennel & yellow onion as that is what I had on hand - had to make sure to blend very well - but it was delicious!

So delicious! I made it with vegetable broth and frozen peas and it was so light and tasty. The next day I ate it cold and it was possibly even better! I used the suggested amount of mint and I would say I would even use less next time, but that might be a personal thing. Very simple I can see myself making it many times again.

My husband and I enjoyed this soup (though the 3 year olds didn't). I used frozen organic peas and the color was great. Ran out of shallots so used some vidalia onions to make up the difference. I agree more mint would be better. And great soup for dipping a cheesy or herby bread.

Wonderful flavor and vibrant color makes this soup a keeper. It tastes so rich; hard to believe the simplicity of ingredients. For the person who got a dull-looking sludge, I'm not sure what happened to yours. Perhaps the quality of the peas. Mine is actually much brighter than what is shown here. I used fresh organic shelling peas and probably doubled the mint. I hope making it vegetarian doesn't alter the flavor too much. Perfect for guests.

Awesome recipe. This soup had great color, texture, with just a hint of mint. The soup is very light and everyone enjoyed it. I used frozen peas and simmered them for about 1/2 hour vs. 15 minutes.

Ugh. all that effort to shell the peas and it tasted like glug and looked even worse. Fresh pea soup is supposed to be BRIGHT green and taste very UNLIKE split pea. This recipe yields neither result so must look for another.

This was so good it just says Spring to me! I used fresh peas and the color was bring and beautiful. So light and and delicious, it made a wonderful first course. Leftovers made a great lunch with a salad.
