I found that direct heat is not a problem with this dish as long as you watch the birds closely. Fish Eye Pinot Grigio is great with this recipe.

I added the juice of 1/2 lemon to the charmoula spice mix, and used 50/50 cilantro and flat-leaf parsley as a marinade for quartered Cornish hens. Important to rub the charmoula under the skin. This was delicious (as are the charmoula lambchops from this site), and we're planning to use this on boneless chicken thighs as part of a graduation buffet menu.
