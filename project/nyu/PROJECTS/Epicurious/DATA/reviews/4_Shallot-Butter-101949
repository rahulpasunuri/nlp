So simple and delicious! I had it with steamed lobster and the combination was excellent. I'm sure it also goes well with all sorts of other seafood. Or try adding it to veggies, like summer squash or asparagus. But it works especially well with corn. Just brush the uncooked corn with the butter, wrap it in aluminum foil and bake it. Or simply eat it on bread.
