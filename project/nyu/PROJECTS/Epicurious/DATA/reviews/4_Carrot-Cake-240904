I only made a slight change. I replaced the pineapple with raisins. I prefer a more tradition cake. It was crazy good with the fresh ginger cream cheese frosting. I made cupcakes instead of a cake, and I've already had two people who said they would pay me to make them. Not a bad review.

Thought this was pretty good. Made it without the frosting and replaced the nuts with raisins so my child could take it to school. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it rose just fine and wasn't dense at all. It's a bit heavy on the allspice. I'll reduce that next time.

before i read the other reviews i noticed--you don't use the same amount of frosting for 2 different size pans! I cut it in half and it was the right amount for the 4x8. it was when the batter was extremely thick and dark that i read the other reviews. it didn't look right. I'm glad i read them! i added quite a bit more flour, 1/4 tsp more baking power and soda, 1/4 -1/2 tsp more of the spices and some of the pineapple juice and beat it until it looked like the right consistency. THEN it came out very well, but i can't give it 4 stars because i know the alterations were necessary.

I used this recipe to make a dozen cupcakes. They were a hit with entire family! I did make a few changes, such as using spelt flour, brown sugar, and sunflower oil. I also made other changes to make it dairy-free and soy-free. My modifications are at http://nomyumfree.com

Wonderful recipe. I replaced the pineapple with raisins, both because I didn't have pineapple, and because I think proper carrot cake has raisins in it. It's moist, and the spices are perfect. To those who were surprised by how little it made, I wonder what they expected from a recipe that calls for less than a cup of flour and says to use a 9x5 pan. I think it's a perfect amount for anything other than a big party, in which case double the cake recipe, but not the frosting.

Followed this recipe as is without reading through reviews. Wish I could turn back time. This cake comes out very dense and does not rise at all. Makes very little by way of cake. Frosting recipe makes more than enough. I would look for other carrot cake recipes and not recommend to make this one again.

This made one very dense, yet moist 9" circle cake. It didn't seem to rise much, but that may be due to my alterations. I didn't use any pineapple, but added extra carrot, 4 in total, used 1/3 C brown sugar, and about 1/3 C finely ground pecans. Baked for 30 minutes, which in hindsight, I should have set for 25 and then checked, but it was still good. Made a simple cream cheese (1/3 less fat version) icing but added a dash or two of cinnamon, which made it seem special, kept it in the fridge to stabilize. Yeah, I'd make it again, it was good for two people. Oh, and forget grating the carrots, used a food processor!

This was delicious! I used about double the carrots called for, subbed pumpkin pie spice in place of the cloves, nutmeg and allspice, omitted the pineapple, and threw in a few chopped slices of candied ginger, and in the frosting, I did not add butter for a lighter frosting. I then made them as cupcakes, baked for 20 minutes. They came out absolutely perfect, and I'll be making them again and again!

Moist, flavorful, and simply delicious. Everyone raved over it when I first made it. Highly recommend this one to any looking for a good carrot cake recipe!

This was the first homemade carrot cake I've made. Unfortunately, I was in a time crunch and didn't read the reviews. Made it exactly as written. It is DRY. One of my favorite things about carrot cake is how moist it always seems to be. Not this. I'll look for a different recipe next time.

good but it doesn't rise much. Also you will need to double the batter if you want a layer cake. It yields very little. No need to double the icing recipe though

Rating: 2
the yield on this cake is ridiculously small. unless you plan to bake it in your ez bake oven, you might want to double or triple the batter recipe. the frosting is plenty for a larger cake. (Tripling the cake barely made a 10 x 2)

Rating: 3
I forgot to add that the frosting recipe makes way too much as written. This makes a pretty tiny cake, so you can easily cut the frosting recipe in half.

This was really good. I am in Denver (high altitude) and it worked well with the addition of an extra egg and a little more flour. I also reduced the amount of sugar a bit. The amount of spice is perfect, and I loved the frosting. I think that I may add orange zest next time, as suggested by another reviewer.

Rating: 4
So, I made some modifications and usually don't review recipes when I change them quite so much but it turned out so incredibly well that I just have to share! I substituted orange slices for the pineapple (carefully cut into 1/2in pieces), as well as added orange zest. I also used almond slithers and almond extract and substituted honey for the sugar. AMAZING. For the frosting, I whipped cream cheese with butter, lots more orange zest, honey and almond extract. I was so happy with the results. The frosting looked beautiful filled with tiny orange speckles.

I absolutely love this recipe. The cream cheese frosting is so light and fluffy. I always use low fat cream cheese, and sometimes leave out the butter. In the cake, I substitute either apple sauce or a grated apple for the pineapple, being that I am not a huge pineapple fan. Last time, I added macadamia nuts as well and it was to die for! A simple, quick recipe that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good cake.

This is a great recipe, its exactly what you want carrot cake to taste like. I like the idea of leaving the butter out of the icing and using less sugar in the recipe in general. I really liked how the cake basically popped out of the tin after I baked it. I loved this and would definitely make it again.

I absolutely adore carrot cake, yet I've never made it until now. This is actually the first cake that I've ever baked while living in Japan. I made it for my boyfriend's mother on her birthday. Everyone loved it. My boyfriend had me make if for his birthday two weeks later! I doubled the recipe except for the sugar because the pineapple and carrots added a natural sweetness, and added shredded coconut. It made two 8 1/2" round cakes which I layered. A simple cream cheese frosting with a bit of lemon zest, minus the butter, took the cake to another level.

Rating: 4
I liked this recipe, especially because it was just as tasty and moist as others have reviewed. Instead of the loaf or cake I made it into muffins (yielded 9 muffins). Skipped the butter in the frosting and only added a fraction of the icing sugar--still very delicious. Would make again, but you definitely need to double this recipe to have a traditional amount of cake (though of course this is noted in the yield portion of the recipe).

i thought that this carrot cake was pretty good but it wasn't really what i was expecting. the cream cheese icing was very whipped. i prefer a thicker icing that is more of a spread. make sure you finely chop all the nuts and pineapples.

Delicious! Moist, dense and flavorful... I combined the individual spices with the flour with a whisk instead of sifting, this does the same job but with less mess. (just a little tip) Just took it out of the oven and it smells heavenly. I previewed a crumb and WOW!! Dad's birthday is tomorrow so the frosting will get made then... Looks amazing! I made a double and it filled a standard Bundt pan perfectly...

Most carrot cake recipe yields a 9x13 cake and uses 3-4 cups confectioners' sugar in the frosting, necessitating bigger appetite (and a visit to the confession chamber) and not just a craving for good vegetable-smuggled sweets. This one I really like because it tastes excellent and can yield a good size 8x8 cake and the frosting is not loaded with too much sugar. Almost, almost guiltless.

WOW!! I made this cake for my wife who is Gluten free...I substituted the regular flour for Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All purpose flour, and also substituted Tofutti brand cream cheese for the reg cream cheese, and is was amazingly delicious! I DOUBLED the recipe and baked it in 2 9inch cake pans for 35 minutes!! Perfect timing at sea level. The Icing was slightly on the soft side, but it was fantastic! We both loved it, and would absolutely make this again!

The frosting curdled. May have overbeaten. Used the frosting from Ultimate Recipe Book using philly cheese etc. Probably liked flavour better anyway and was more stable. Really iked the spicing of the cake. Made in two small tins that worked well.

Easy and newbie-baker friendly! I doubled the recipe and used 2 8-inch sandwich tins for a layered cake. The cake was moist and chunky and my family loved it! Successful first attempt at carrot cake. :)

Great tasting cake. I multiplied the recipe by 1 1/2 and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 50 minutes. It came out perfect - moist and light. I substituted raisins for the nuts. For the frosting I used 3 Tbs butter and 1C sugar and 8 oz low fat cream cheese. That was just the right amount of frosting for the cake. Will definately be making this again.

Amazing, made this for my boyfriends birthday! He loved it. I didn't use pineapple, just added a bit more carrot. I baked it in a 8x8 pan for 25-30min so I could ice it and then write on it by making my own organic decorating icing. I boiled a few carrots and then pureed them and added powder sugar till sweet. Put into my piping bag and went to town decorating the top.

so good! I didn't make it with the pineapple or the walnuts, and I made it in a popover tins...But it still turned out delicious and moist. I also upped the salt a little bit.

This was my first carrot cake attempt, and I must say, this is a FABULOUS and relatively easy recipe. I halved the sugar and added raisins, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I baked in a 8 inch square pan for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and made a half batch of frosting, which was the perfect amount to frost the small cake. I agree with the other reviewers that using oil makes a very moist cake even the 2nd day. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful cake. Based on the other reviews I also doubled the recipe and added about a cup raisins soaked in very warm water and drained. It was very moist cake and it got great reviews from the 12 people I served it to. Does make a LOT of delicious frosting. This is not a cake that will rise much so don't worry if you think something is wrong. This is also good for making muffins.

This is a fantastic cake! I love carrot cake and this one is moist and a bit crunchy from the nuts. I used pecans since that's what I had and it was a lovely mellow flavor. Also looks great made in a small 4-5 inch springform pan, cut in the middle with an extra layer of cream cheese! Also, because of the oil, it has maintained its moistness for 4 days in the fridge and was good till the last day. Making it again today.

The cake was very good but on the small side so I doubled it and put it in a bundt pan. I expected it to have a longer baking time but it was perfect after 50 minutes. I found the frosting to be so runny that I doublechecked the ingredients to see if I had made a mistake. I kept adding powdered sugar --at least another cup--until the consistency was thicker/stiffer.

This recipe makes a wonderful carrot cake. The frosting was tasty, but I had a lot left over. If you don't like a lot of frosting, you can probably cut the frosting recipe in half.

Great, great recipe! I followed the most of the reviews and doubled the recipe. Instead of the drained pineapple, I added one shredded apple. I baked it in a bundt the first time and as cupcakes the second. Very easy to make and very yummy.

I've made this recipe twice now and gotten great reviews both times! I substitue a zucchini or two if I have them around and substitute butter for canola oil.

delicious! the pineapple adds a good amount of moisture and tang. i wasn't a huge fan of the frosting with butter. Next time I think I'll just combine cream cheese, sugar, lemon and sugar for a simpler (and less fatty) version.

Turned out fantastic, very moist and lots of flavor. It does produce a small cake, I made two and layered them.

I made this cake last night for a birthday party. Everyone loved it and devoured it. I doubled the recipe and left out the walnuts. It was very easy to make- cooked for exactly 50 minutes, and we fantastic! I'm going to try making a healthier version for my grandfather.

Made this serveral times now, the best carrot cake recipe I've found. The cake is not huge, and there was a lot of left over frosting. I use this frosting recipe with the inside out carrot cake cookies too. All 'round great recipe!

Best Carrot Cake ever!! Amazing just a little bit small so you might want to double the recipe but not the frosting . Also try with Cupcakes :)!

I agree with others' reviews that it produces a small cake. I baked mine in an 8-inch round cake pan, used walnut oil and gave the grated carrots and pineapple a turn in the food processor. It produces a very moist, melt-in-your-mouth cake and for the two of us, just the right size.

This was a good recipe but after reading another review I did realize that this recipe produces a small cake so I doubled the ingredients as well, except for the frosting. But other than that its absolutely delicious.

Really not great, I've made better, moister carrot cakes. 50 minutes was way too much time to bake this cake in the loaf pan.

I doubled the recipe and put them in two bread tins. They came out absolutely perfect. Instead of making a frosting, I opted for a cream cheese glaze...terrific!

The batter looked pretty wet, and it did not rise as much as I expected (maybe my baking powder's too old), but my cupcakes were gobbled up the next day by my colleagues who all loved them. Definitely better the next day. The cake was not overly sweet, which is good for our less sweet European tastes. For the icing, I used less butter and added enough sugar to taste. I also added some grated fresh ginger, as in the Ginger Cream Cheese recipe on this site. It made more icing than I needed for cupcakes.

My son, who turns 5 today, has been dying to make this recipe again since January, when we made it for his dad's birthday. It was a really successful experience. This is to say, it's easy to make, even with a young child assisting, and is very yummy. I would recommend making two of the above cakes so you can layer them. This one is quite small.

Rating: 3
Cake was much better the next day, great texture and moist. It was gone before I was able to make the frosting. I have to watch fat so used eggbeaters and reduced oil and walnuts. I subbed pineapple juice for the chunks and backed it for a little longer. I will make this for my sons 3rd birthday this weekend.
