I have to agree with what was said by another. This does not resemble any Nasi Goreng I've ever had at all. That includes the some 100 Indonesian immigrants that I know or my family in Indonesia.

This recipe is better than the user rating suggests. I almost immediately discarded it because only 45% would make it again but after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. It certainly didn't "wow" me but it was decent, simple version of the dish. I do think it needs some added protein, either egg or pork or chicken.

This is not a bad version of Nasi Goreng, but it's not the best I've come across either. A couple of suggestions I'd offer would be to add shrimp paste at the beginning, to add a little sesame oil to the peanut oil and to cook the rice in stock (I like fish stock). I would also add prawns or shrimps and one very non-traditional ingredient: smoked salmon pieces. Yum!

The art of fried rice is improvisation, adapting to ingredients on hand. Here's the fried rice recipe I've been using ever since returning from Bali: -Day old rice -shredded boneless leftover roast chicken -mixture of veggies on hand, chopped bite-size (I like mushrooms, cabbage, green/red peppers, brocolli, carrots, bean sprouts) -seasonings: chopped onions, minced garlic & ginger, chopped cilantro, chopped fresh green chilis, soy sauce, or ketchup manis, oyster sauce, diced tomato, lime wedges, sricha chili-garlic sauce -garnish: deep-fried shallots, fried eggs, lettuce, cucumber slices, I like radish slices Method: Heat 1-2 tblsp oil in large pan/wok, add sliced onions, ginger, garlic and green chilies cook 30 sec. Add veggies with longer cooking time first(ie carrots) stir-fry about 4 mins, I like crisp veggies. No worries if the mushrooms give off some liquid. Splash in some oyster sauce, and soya sauce/ketchup manis. Add the chicken, and tomatos, cook til hot & tomato gives off juice(1-2 mins). Break up rice, and stir in along with beansprouts. Heat for a couple of minutes til piping hot, turn off heat and stir in cilantro til it wilts slightly. Plate and squeeze fresh lime juice over all. Serve with chili garlic sauce and veggie/egg garnishes on side. For me, this is one of the healthiest, most comforting, flavourful and fresh dishes. As for amounts, use as much soya sauce/oyster sauce/chili sauce as you like, keeping in mind saltiness levels, add less to being. Clearly, tomato and lime juice are very acidic, don't use too much. I prefer a 1 to 4 meat to veggies ratio, and about half as much rice as everything else, the more veggies the better in my opinion.

I don't know whether or not this recipe should be considered authentic, but I like it all the same. I did, however, add a few things, such as ground coriander, crushed caraway seeds, garlic and trassi, which is an Indonesian shrimp paste. I also left out the mushrooms, which in my view don't belong to this recipe. But obviously, in a staple dish like this there are all sorts of possible varieties.

Being a singaporean, I dun't understand why this is getting such negative reviews. Nasi Goreng means fried rice in malay & indonesian. Even in my country, this dish is well known & every country & region has its own speciality. You can substitute the kind of ingredients you use (for meat & veggies)& coriander is not a must. in fact, in singapore & malaysia, do not use any coriander at all. There is no standard nasi goreng recipe whereby ingredients a to z must absolutely go in. I would say it is pretty authentic dish still...quite similar to the one back home. Also, the kind of tomato ketchup back in asia tastes differently than those in western markets so perhaps you could go to your asian shop, buy a bottle & make this recipe again.

Although this is not my favourite nasi goreng (fried rice) recipe, it is absolutely authentic. I was born in Kediri on the island of Java. This recipe is the exact same as that in Sri Owen's "Indonesian Food and Cookery" cookbook given to me by my Indonesian Godmother when I was in Surabaya in 1994. It is also sold by the American Women's Club in Jakarta. You can definitely make an authentic nasi goreng with Chinese or Japanese soy sauce, although there are many other variations that specifically call for kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). That being said, this particular recipe is a "plain Jane" recipe, and doesn't give you much introduction to the delicious variety of Indonesian food. My favourite English language Indonesian cookbook is "The Indonesian Kitchen" by Copeland Marks with Mintari Soeharjo. It does call for a some esoteric ingredients, but most can be purchased from a well-equipped Asian grocery. There is also at least one on-line Indonesian grocery in the U.S. with reasonable rates and shipping. Indonesian food can be delicious and if you didn't like this particular recipe, don't give up on it.

Preparation : Cook the rice and let it cool off. Rub the meat with salt and cut in small dices.Heat the oil and fry meat till nicely brown. Add the onions and garlic and fry till the onions look glassy. Add the cut beans, mushrooms and leek and fry everything for another 3 - 4 minutes. Add ketoembar, djintan, sambal oelek and ketjap and stir the lot well. Add the cooled rice and flavour to taste with salt and pepper. While continuously turning, warm the nasi goreng up. A nice beer will do !!

in padang at my home we make nasi goreng and it is very simple, padang people do not like sweet so we do not add sweet soy sauce, but salty. but we do add lots of chili peppers, garlic, shallots, asian celery, and a little bit of cabbage & egg and little bits of dried beef. And never pork as padang people are mostly muslim. If you buy nasi goreng from a street cart it is again very diffrent depending on what area of Indonesia you are in. but in general it is not a complex dish, but very simple.made to use up what ever you have on hand.

I have not yet but do intend on making this recipe. However, I do not appreciate reading ratings/reviews (particularly unjustly poor ratings) from people who have not even tried to make the recipe! Just because the recipe is not completely "authentic" does not mean that it can't taste good.

I have a dutch mother and was brought up on indonesian food.This is a very good recipe. It is very basic. I add ham and chicken breast and shrimp to it. I also use sambal and ketchup manis in it. It is a tasty recipe that I have made many times. Its yummy. Also the trick is make your rice a day ahead and let cool in the refridgerator. Comes out the best

I think Sri Owen, the author of the Asian Kitchen tried to adjust the authentic recipe so that people can make this with stuffs they already have in their pantry. But to label this recipe as Indonesian Fried Rice is not fair. Unlike Chinese Fried Rice that require simple soy sauce, you actually need lots more exotic spices in Indonesian version. For example, paste made of corriander, galangal, garlic, shallots, srimp paste, and sweet dark soy sauce is a must. Be careful not to offend Indonesian people: they are very proud of their Nasi Goreng and satay.

It's not genuine nasi goreng without sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), which you can get at an oriental food store. The ginger isn't necessary. The red chilis are to give the dish a hot flavor; chili sauce (oriental food store again) can be substituted, or, in a pinch, cayenne pepper. If served as a main dish, it should have some sort of meat (chicken, shrinp, or pork) in it. Cucumber and/or tomato slices on the side are excellent.

Being Indonesian , i have never seen a Nasi Goreng recipe like this before! I would concur that there is no tomato ketchup in any Indonesian dishes - where is the Sambal Oelek and the Meat ??

I know for a fact that traditional Indonesian nasi goreng is not made like this. There are many different varieties of nasi goreng...but this is deffinitely not one of it. For one, no nasi goreng uses ketchup! Traditionally nasi goreng are made of sweet soysauce
