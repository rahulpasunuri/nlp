could you substitute besan (chick pea flour) for the mung bean paste?

I was quite disappointed with this recipe. I found them quite bland and crumbly. I ended up adding another egg, but it was still quite crumbly. I work at a Korean restaurant and they use more veg (i.e. spinach, onion, etc) as well as pork for non-vegetarians, and they are amazing. I also noticed that the photo seems to show more veg, like spinach or zucchini, in the pancakes. I think I will try my own version next time.

Surprisingly good. I skipped the flour and used only one carrot, which I grated. Also used half the amount of salt. Next time I may reduce the water to make the batter a bit thicker. Dipping sauce is a must!

There is a problem with the proportion of egg to flour in this recipe. Prepared as written, the batter is very thin, but recipe specifically says it should be thick? I added more flour and it was anything but "light and airy". Flavor is very bland. It needs more of everything as does the dipping sauce. I'm very disappointed.

Great recipe, but the flour is absolutely not needed, and, traditionally, is not used in my family. Mung bean pancakes: The use of only soaked mung beans makes a great gluten free dish. I make it with green onions and kim chee (squeeze the kim chee to rid of the liquid and chop). The kim chee gives color and flavor. [Flour pancakes: scallions or scallion with oyster. Flour & egg pancakes: bean sprouts]

Two things to make this recipe easier. You can buy mung bean flour at Asian food stores, health food stores and on line. And instead of making a special trip to the store for a fresh red chile, you can use red pepper flakes.

Marvelous! Very satisfying vegetarian recipe. It is a meat substitute for any meal. I soaked the peeled mung beans a long time and lacked the chili, but it was still amazing. I made them thicker. I will make this every week. Great recipe!!

I made this last night for New Years Party. Am hungry 24 hours later and am making it again. Was so pleasantly surprised with how easy and delicious it is. I think it (and mung beans) will become a staple in our house.

This recipe tasted great, but I don't know why I could not flip them without them breaking to pieces! I followed the recipe exactly. Can someone help?

Cook from North Miami. The recipe is actually correct. The beans serve as the base of the pancake as opposed to flour so the batter actually needs little or no flour. I make mine with none.

I think there is a mistake here. I think its 2 cups of flour, 2 eggs and 1 cup of water for the batter.

didn't taste as good as I thought it would....

These were fabulous! We've made them several times now. We grated the carrots on the large holes of a box grater and sliced the scallions into thin rounds (when you slice them lengthwise, they tend to stick out of the batter and burn). If you don't have time to sak the beans ahead on time, you can rinse them and cook them until soft (10 minutes or so), drain and rinse again, and they'll work fine in this recipe.

I wasn't so sure about these at first but my party guest loved them as a appetizer. It would be a great option to offer the vegetarians in the crowd if you are making Korean Barbecued beef.

These pancakes (bindaedeok) are a great Korean favorite; this recipe is a bit unorthodox in adding egg, but it actually works quite well. It lightens up the pancakes slightly, making them hold up a little better if they have to sit a bit after frying (I still recommend serving right away, though) Be sure to get Korean-style peeled yellow mung beans (nokdu); I wouldn't think chickpeas would absorb enough water to make a batter with the right consistency. I think the usual ratio is 2 parts soaked beans to 1 part water; 1:1 presoaking turned out to be about right too, as it turns out. (Always start with less water-- easy to add, impossible to take away!) Be sure to spread quite thin in the pan, or the pancake will be too thick, and starchy/pasty?

Well this turned out to be a complete disaster for me. I couldn't find mung beans, but found another recipe that said you could substitute chick peas. The pancakes always fell totally apart when I tried to flip them, even when I made them much smaller in size. My husband described them as pasty.

I have some experience of Korean cuisine, however this dish definitely fits the bill if you want to impress guests with a creative Asian appetizer/side dish. these savoury 'pancakes' are a fabulous and extremely easy (you can't burn them!! cooking them is so easy! i normally burn pancakes.) i followed the recipe exactly and served with the dipping sauce along with the spicy Thai mussels (also on this page), the idea being one could dip in either the sauce or the liquid from the mussel dish (coconut/lime/Thai red curry). my guests did both with great enjoyment. raves on this dish. i wouldn't say the recipe makes enough for 8 pancakes though, so if you have a large group, i would make 1.5 recipes. it's SO easy! delicious.
