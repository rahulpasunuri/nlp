I'm not a fan of changing recipes, then giving a review of the recipe, but here I go! I didn't think my family would like the eggy batter, as is. That said, I loved the idea of adding Parmesan cheese to the mix. Here's what I did, and it came out fantastic: 1) Make the batter recipe as written 2) Place some flour in a shallow dish 3) Place some Italian bread crumbs in a dish. Dredge the cutlets in flour, then the batter, then the bread crumbs. Pan fry exactly as directed in the recipe. The result is a tender juicy cutlet with a nice cheesy flavor, and crispy texture. Yum!

As written, this was not good. Too salty, batter does not stick to turkey, too eggy. Good concept though, and with all the suggestions by other reviewers, it's a good one to try again.

I just made this tonight, but couldn't keep the batter from sticking to the pan, so when I turned the cutlets over, the batter stayed in the pan. Could anyone tell me how to keep this from happening? Thanks much! PS: It was very tasty, nonetheless!

Yummy! Great gluten free alternative to fried poultry!

I bought turkey cutlets for another, low-fat recipe that I misplaced, so I decided to try this one. Not reading the recipe very well, I used bread crumbs and grated parmesan. Batter/crust was thick, but I think it was nice. Also added some extra seasonings, garlic salt and maybe powdered rosemary. Salt and peppered cutlets before dipping into batter as well. All and all, I'll make again.

I loved this recipe. I did make a couple of changes, though. I used grated parmesan instead of shredded and added a dash of milk to thin the egg just a little bit. It was really good! I'll be making this again.

Despite earlier disappointing reviews, I tried this after a long work day and an aging packet of Trader Joe's cutlets in the fridge. I could not bear another picatta or scaloppine or marsala -- I ended up with a delectable crispy, cheesy crust. Tossed a basket of cherry tomatoes in the pan with some balsamic to finish -- delicious!

these are good, not exceptional, but definitely worth making on a week night meal.

I made this for my EXTREMELY picky family who was visiting and they LOVED it! I'm vegetarian and prefer ethnic food while most of my family prefers meat-and-potato dishes without a lot of flavors added. So I'm always on the lookout for a meat dish that I don't mind cooking and came across this one. I got turkey breast cutlets from Trader Joe's and they were already sliced thin enough for cooking so I didn't have to pound them. The previous reviewers weren't kidding when they said you have to move fast once you put the cheese in the batter. For side dishes I made mashed garlic red potatos and asparagus. I will definitely make this again the next time my super picky family is in town.

I use this site extensively and find the recipes very dependable. This recipe (rated as 86% would make again)is the exception. My husband and daughter were both polite and ate it but requested that it be eliminated from my repertoire.

It was more like a turkey cutlet surrounded by a thin omlet that a battered cutlet. The egg was the thing you tasted.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it was delicious. I took the suggestion of flouring the turkey before dipping it in the batter. This helped the batter stick and I didn't have any problems. I also prefer substituting basil for parsley. This is an easy meal to make on a work night.

Based on reviews, added milk and lemon zest to 1 egg for batter. Second batch did stick a little. Turkey alone was great, but with all those bits in the skillet, added a little chopped tomato, extra basil and lemon juice to deglaze for sauce. Easy and great, welcome change from chicken.

We have really enjoyed this recipe. I've found that using two frying pans at once helps with the batter problems. Or I add a little more water when I'm ready to do the second batch of turkey breasts. I pat the turkey breast dry with paper towels and that also helps the batter stick - next time I'll try the flour suggestion! A very quick, easy and delicious last minute dinner for any night of the week! And the best leftovers for sandwiches and salads for the next day or two!

This was ok. Based on previous comments, I lightly dusted the cutlets with flour before dipping in the batter - I had no problems as far as the coating sticking, so this may be the solution for those who had that problem. I'm not sure whether I'd make it again, but if I did I'd probably season the cutlets with salt prior to flouring -- it was a bit bland. It made for a nice, relatively quick meal with garlic-chive mashed potatoes and steamed carrots, red pepper, red onion and red cabbage.

Yuck! This was terrible...so eggy and flavorless, even with the lemon and fresh basil. I won't be making this again.

Fast, easy and a wonderful crispy coating with no breading! Two thumbs up and I'll definitely make it again.

This was a very easy quick and tasty meal to make. One of the reviewers was right - the batter didn't stick real well to the cutlets and the batter got really thick at the end. The squirt of fresh lemon juice gives it s nice zip.

Sorry Chandler, here's another 3 star rating. Maybe not the most exciting meal, but it's got a good taste (as someone else said, a nice change from typical chicken) and takes about 6 minutes to make, start to finish. How can you go wrong? Don't forget the lemon!

My husband & I both liked this easy-to-make-on-a-weeknight dish.

I made this with chicken cutlets and they were moist and tasty. However, I found that the coating did not adhere very well to the chicken. Did anyone try dredging the cutlets in flour first?

I wish there was a 0 rating.Man, this recipe was horrible. Kind of like scrambled eggs on turkey. I can't believe this was rated 3-4 by anyone. This is the worst recipe I have ever pulled up from this site. My husband said, "You have been cooking for me for 5 years now, and this is the only thing I would want to throw out, as everything else has been real good". We are throwing it into the garbage.TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good, quick meal. It's a nice change from the usual chicken dish.

A very satisfying low-carb meal! This is a great way to fry without breadcrumbs. The turkey stayed moist.

My family went wild over this recipe! Even my 3- and 6-year-olds raved, and they are picky eaters (my daughter said it tasted just like KFC, so that's the highest compliment she can give!). So she would give it 4 forks . . . I'd rate it 3 1/2.

A Nice quick weeknight meal. I added a bit of oregano, but otherwise made as written. I served w/ steamed broccoli with fresh lemon, and decided to give the turkey a squeeze of lemon as well, and liked it better with that addition.

Rating: 3
Very nice! Don't let the batter sit too long or the parmesan absorbs all the liquid and it gets gluey. Also didn't pound the turkey, as the cutlets I get (Shady Brook Farm) are rather fragile. Still worked beautifully.

A very tasty work night meal.

Very rich and tasty. Recommend serving with a plain, steamed vegetable and the lemon slices.
