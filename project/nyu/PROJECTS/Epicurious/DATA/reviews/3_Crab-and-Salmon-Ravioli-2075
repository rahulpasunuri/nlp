I reduced the ginger to 1 tsp. I substituted lemon butter basil sauce and used home made ravioli. It was very good.

I wasn't terribly impressed with the dish as a whole, but when we browned the leftover ravioli in a pan of olive oil and ate them with potsticker dipping sauce, they were really quite tasty. I'd make them as potstickers again.

Raviolis are great. Wonderful combination of flavors. I made by own egg pasta for this. I've always found gyoza skins to be too limp--no substance to them. The dressing was also good, but I would reduce, if not eliminate the lemonjuice the next time. These beauties don't need a lot of acidity in the sauce.

This ravioli is more like won-tons. The filling is delicious, but they turned out soggy and limp. I should have realized this, but I'm a novice cook, and I had something more like baked ravioli in mind. Good luck to other people who try this recipe. :)

The ravioli was great, but the vinegrette was too sour. Next time I'll cut way back on the olive oil, vinegar and lemon. A lighter, more tomatoey sauce would serve the dish better.

Very Yummy! We made just the ravioli, leaving out the ginger, and served it with a light cream sauce. Oh so good! I enjoy making my own stuffed pasta, so this was fun for me - but not everyone is up for such work.

This is a really nice dish, but a lot of work. I've cut down on some ingredients and didn't really notice a change in flavor. We like to make alot as it tastes really good leftover cold and dipped into the vinagrette like Chinese dumplings.
