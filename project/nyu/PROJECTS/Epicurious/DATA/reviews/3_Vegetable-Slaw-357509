This turned out great but I confess that I always cut the oil in half on slaw recipes figuring that I can always add it later. The flat flavor that other reviewers describe is why I started cutting the oil. When it's flat it needs more acid and this has a lot of rice vinegar but too much safflower oil cancels it out. Leave the toasted sesame oil as is. I used cilantro instead of the parsley - it's more Asain and added the juice and zest of a lime cause I couldn't resist. Seriously delicious with these changes and I recommend calling someone on the phone while you do the peas and it will be a lot less tedious.

Made this several times, but added organic golden raisins or feta, depending on my mood..My friends loved it and always take seconds and comment on it..nice and light, not too sweet..and super fresh.. Try It!

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. It looked very pretty, but the dressing was really bland - seemed like just eating oily vegetables with very little flavor.

I found this to be incredibly disappointing, given the effort involved. Perhaps someone has a shortcut for thinly slicing sugar snap peas lengthwise? The dressing is flat and I found the whole thing watery. A shame, because I wanted to love this.

So fresh and delicious. I am a huge asian slaw fan and I find many are too sweet. This one is well balanced. I used toasted sesame oil. Make extra...I had it for lunch the next day on my sandwich with hummus and good artisan bread.
