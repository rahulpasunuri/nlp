I made this soup and added more veggies--frozen corn and peas and whatever else you would like. I also added some instant mashed potatoes which thickened the soup. It freezes very well.

Loved this. I listened to others and halved the tomatoe, put in 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes. Left out mushrooms, added celery, and a few peppers red and green. I pureed most of the big pieces of vegetables. I used fresh herbs and added a green onion and cilantro garnish on top.

This is a really good and healthy soup. However it's really a tomato vegetable soup -- Ratatouille-ish. The tomato gives it a sweet edge, where I was looking for savory. I made it to spec, but I increased the amounts of cilantro, parsley and garlic. I served it with brown rice that I mixed in to each bowl. I don't think I'd make this again because of the tomato.

Excellent. Keeps well, freezes well for quick lunches and dinners. Healthy but doesn't lack flavor. I added one can of white beans for a little more protein and fiber. Served the first time with corn bread muffins, the second time with crusty bread and the balsamic white bean dip recipe I found on this site.

I followed the recipe exactly. The soup was good on the first day, but it got watery after that. Will not make again.

This is a recipe that you can certainly take liberties with. I wanted to make it a meal and added diced chicken breast, sauteed with the onions and garlic prior to adding the remaining ingredients. I didn't add as many crushed tomatoes as called for and used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth. I am a cilantro lover and this was just the right flavor to make this an amazing dinner soup - with plenty of leftovers for healthy take-to- work lunches.

Good, but too much tomato flavor. I love tomato, but I felt it is too much.

Really nice, simple soup. I added tofu and celery, omitted the potato and mushrooms and used only 4 cups broth. I'm sure any veggie combination would work and look forward to making again and experimenting.

I really wanted to like this soup, but I just didn't. Not enough flavor, even with all the great vegetables. But I'm on a soup roll right now, and the butternut squash and pinto bean soup on this site is a real winner -- and it's low-fat.

This was the best tasting soup I have ever had. I made it for my dinner party and every single guest raved about it, even my friend who hates onions and tomatoes. This soup is a meal on its own. It really fills you up!

This is a terrific soup for those that are looking for healthy meals. Fot lunch or dinner (with salad and bread) it is very satisfying. I have made it 6-7 times now and have stopped bothering with mushrooms - they don't really add much. Be careful when blending the vegtables to not add too much liquid or you can't get it smooth and it makes the soup texture weird. I like to eat healthy during the week and this soup has been perfect! It's approximately 1 Weight Watchers pointy per cup. Enjoy!

I made this soup substituting cubes of firm tofu for the potato, adding extra protein. I also added seasonal vegetable to the soup, such as leeks and green cabbage, and used a full cup of parsley and a cup of cilantro. I also skipped the puree step; the vegetables spoke for themselves. Everyone went back for seconds, and it was so easy and stores so well, I'll definitely be making it again!

With thrice the garlic, 3 stocks of celery and some hot pepper flakes, and sauted veggies thrown in at the end, this soup still tasted like a crash diet soup, only didn't cause the gas like some others do. I'll freeze it and take it out instead of (last second) frozen veggies (for quick dinners), just because there is quite an array of nutrients, but not because I'm craving it.

LOVED this soup, so did my husband and picky son, who hates cooked tomatoes Sauteed onions, carrots & garlic in olive oil as recommended. Used dried parsley & basil, but the fresh cilantro made the dish. I added red pepper flakes for a zippier flavor and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese as a garnish. A very hearty soup, very filling, did not feel deprived at all.

I liked this very much. I added extra garlic and increased the dry herbs as well. A also sauteed the onions, garlic, carrots and some celery before adding the rest. For a low fat, low calorie dish, this tastes pretty darn good. The cilanto (I think anyway) is the key to giving this some zest.

Pretty good. Very easy. Quite quick. Tastes very much like V-8 Juice but with chunks of vegetables. Might experiment with other seasonings and vegetable combinations. Really not a "three fork" rating... more like two and half. Lacks a bit of character. Adding pasta might round it out a bit.

This was an awesome recipe. I also cooked the onions/garlic/mushrooms in 1 T olive oil. My family isn't wild about squash so I substituted 1 C lima beans and 1 C corn. I didn't bother thickening the soup since we like the veggies, but I did add the juice from two limes at the end to brighten the flavor. It's not often that you find a recipe that is quick, easy, nutrious and low-fat with such wonderful flavor. I plan to make this often.

I've lost 30 pounds on Weight Watchers and this is one of my standby foods. I cook the onions/garlic/mushrooms to a deep gold w 1 T olive oil and it still only one "point" for a cup and a half. My trick is to eat a good breakfast (3 - 4 pts), a light lunch (this w a no-point salad + cottage cheese + fruit for a 3-4 pt lunch) leaving an ample 10 points for supper. Easy!

I would definitely make this again. It was easy, tasted excellent (even if I did omit the parsley as I didn't have any), and healthy (we are both dieting at the moment). I would probably leave out the mushrooms next time - they seemed a little superfluous.

Excellent! I added some red pepper flakes--I like zing! Next time, I'll add some chopped chipotle peppers in adobo. I've added chopped poblano pepper before, also. And double cilantro & garlic. It's a great "clean out the fridge" recipe.

Wow!! This is the first time I've commented on a recipe---this is the most flavorful low-fat veg. soup I've ever made....I usually improvise off a recipe but I decided to follow it fairly strictly and it's excellent! If you're not so concerned about adding a bit of fat, try just a bit of half and half (I bet buttermilk would be good too) just to lighten the color and give it a bit of richness and softness. It's great without it too.

This soup is great. I added an extra tablespoon of cilantro and parsley and used 2 tablespoons fresh basil instead of dried. I also added two extra cloves of garlic and baby spinach. It was very tasty served with corn muffins.

I agree with the previous comments regarding the name of this soup. I started out wanting a soup that could be taken to work, easy to heat up and low in fat. Boring, right? Not at all! This soup had a wonderful taste. I ended up using left over veggies from the fridge, more garlic (there can never be enough!) 2 cans of plum tomatoes, used fresh tomatoes and chicken broth. I did puree 3 cups of the cooked veggies, which thickened up the broth nicely. This soup would be a wonderful base for anything you want to put in it, eg: meatballs, pasta, barley, etc.

Naturally I was suspicious when I read the name of this recipe. Titles that begin with "low fat" seem to say "Look, I'm not very tasty, but I AM low fat." Well, the soup was delicious! The second time I made it, I did what all cooks do: experimented a little. I doubled the parsley and cilantro, used 3 tablespoons each chopped fresh basil and oregano, and added some shredded napa cabbage and a diced turnip. I did not puree the soup. Right before serving, I added some more fresh basil and oregano.

This was a great low-fat meal. I left the cilantro out b/c my husband doesn't like it, used fat-free chicken broth instead of veggie and added a dash of Tabasco sauce. Filling and healthy.

This soup is so delicious and easy. I added some canned corn to the soup and it turned out great! A hand blender really makes this recipe alot easier. Just blend until you reach the desired consistency.

I loved this soup. I've passed it along to about 5 friends. I hate cilantro, so used more parsley. I also added baby spinach at the end. When serving, sprinkle some parmesan on top. Wonderful!

This soup hit the right spot for a winter's evening; no complaints anywhere

Delicious! More hearty than I had expected - so it'll fill you up with some bread and a salad. The recipe makes A TON, so have a huge pot ready! Also, the recipe sounds more complicated than it needs to be because of the blender step. That can be skipped - it just adds to the thickness because it makes more of a paste.

This is a great recipe to clean out the refrigerator. I had tons of vegs leftover from holiday parties that I substituted into the recipe, ie: bok choy, green, yellow and red bell peppers along with carrots, onions, potato etc. Very quick and easy to make.

This is a wonderful vegetable soup recipe (especially if you flavor with the right touch of salt & pepper)! Perfect for a nippy or foggy day, as well as when someone is feeling "under the weather". My family requests this delicious soup often & it's very easy!

This is an easy soup to make and tastes wonderful. It is also easy to vary the seasonings and spiciness to your taste without sacrificing the quality.

I also loved this recipe. My husband who thinks soup is a first course not an entree was full after two bowls. I garnished it with light sour cream and more cilatro.

Hearty!! I took a little advice from each of the other reviewers, and I'm glad I did. I did use more cilantro than prescribed since I love it so much, and I found it gave the soup a kind-of Mexican flavor (it would be good with some taco chips and maybe a dollop of sour cream on top). I also used a can of Spicy Red Pepper Stewed Tomatoes, and that gave it a LOT of flavor.

I love this soup. Easy to make and it freezes well.

This was really very, very good. I added about 2 cups of baby spinach leaves and a sliced leek (white and light green parts only) for a little bit of green which was great. Also, instead of going through the time consuming process of straining the entire soup just to puree some of the vegetables, I just took my ladle and scooped a few large portions of vegetables with just a bit of broth directly into my blender (about 2-3 cups), blended it and then returned it to the pot of soup. I served this soup with some french bread and roasted garlic. Excellent!!

This is a very good low-cal, low-fat soup. It was easy to prepare. I did add salt earlier than called for.
