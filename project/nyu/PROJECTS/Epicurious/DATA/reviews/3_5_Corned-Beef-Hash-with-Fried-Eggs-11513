I made this recipe according to the directions except I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I subed an instant steak gravy mix for the flour and broth...subbed white horseradish for pink.....subbed A1 steak sauce for the worcestershire sauce....it all worked very well....now I know what to do with leftover corned beef other than rubens.

Made this last night using leftover brisket from passover. It is very good even though when I first read the recipe it was sounding a bit odd. I made it exactly as written but poached the eggs. Big hit with the boys. It took a while to make it crispy, but that is the best part. I would definately make this again

Delicious! Took it to work event - everyone loved it. Leftovers were great panfried with butter. Great flavors - used 1# corned beef.

My husband loves corned beef hash and this one is his favorite. I use packaged potato dices which really saves time.

I was quite dubious when I decided to try this recipe, but I wanted to try something different and I had all the ingredients (plus my corned beef was about to turn on me. The broth added great flovor, as did the horseradish and worchester. I used unpeeled red potatos; worked just fine. (and the kids liked it too!). Would make this again

I received rave reviews on this. My father in law said "I think this is the best hash I have ever had in my entire life!). I doubled the recipe - it took a long time for all of the broth to absorb and for it to get crispy)

Tasty and easy. The "gravy" was absorbed as the potatoes crisped and gave the finished dish a savory taste.

Loved this. I made the corned beef & cabbage from this site and boiled my potatoes w/the cabbage at the end. I then used the leftover potatoes for this dish as well and saved on time! Besides that I prepared this recipe exactly as said (used regular horseradish)..I was a bit worried about the "gravy" effect but once I cooked the dish for the extra 15 minutes as described it was perfect. I poached the eggs for the dish (used large frying pan, 1-2 inches of water, added white vinegar and when it was a nice simmer added eggs and poached for approx 3 minutes, removed w/slotted spoon)it was more traditional and added rye toast. Husband loved it!

This is pretty tasty! My kids loved it too, they even ate it cold. I had to remove the excess liquid and then pan fry it to get the crispy edges that we like so much. Didnt add the horseradish and it was still fabulous. Also, didnt put in as much potato as suggested. Going to have to buy more corned beef just to make the hash!

Deviant that I am, I made this with leftover grilled tri tip cut in 1/2" cubes. I figured that we'd douse it in salsa and it would be edible. No salsa needed, this is terrific! The horseradish doesn't make it pungent but adds an interesting layer of flavor. I'm sure this is good with corned beef, but made with regular roast beef leftovers this is now permanent repertoire.

Beet horseradish is the same as regular "prepared" horseradish, but it has some beet juice added to make it red. If you can't find it, regular horseradish will work just fine.

This was great! It was our compromise dish for St. Patrick's Day! (I hate boiled dinner) Good flavor, the horseradish added a nice kick and the beef broth keeps the dish from being too dry.

HELP! I plan on making this tonight - but I have never heard of beet horseradish - is this a typo? Can I substitute reg horseradish? Thanks in advance for any help Kathy In Canada

We always have this w/ the leftovers from our corned beef dinners. I've even made it for my sister-in-law and husband who do not care for hash. They loved it!

This is the best corned beef hash ever. Served it 4 times for brunch - always a hit. Minor tweaks; red bell pepper and Yukon gold potatoes. Also, recipe amounts too skimpy for 4 good appetites - increase by 50%. Par poached the eggs in water with 1/2 cup vinegar - 2.5+ minutes - turning once -transfer to ice water. Back in the hot water for one minute just before serving. Yumm

Made this recipe for breakfast this morning. The recipe was made precisely as indicated with the exception of using red (bliss) potatoes instead of russets. Undoubtably, one of the better recipies I've come accross. Dan Kroeger

I thought it was kind of boring, but my husband and kids loved it. The entire dish, especially the eggs took a lot longer to cook then the recipe states. Next time I will cook the eggs on the side.

didnt care for this...i should have know better when i saw the recipe included Worcestershire sauce..the flavors just didnt seem to go together..wont make this again...i love corned beef however..and will just contiunue to serve it when we have it for breakfast..as is...sliced and with eggs

My husband liked this better than I, probably because he didn't prepare it. "Crisping" took much longer than 15 minutes (after 45 minutes on medium flame it still wasn't crisped). Next time I'll crank up the heat and watch it closely.

This is a good way to feed my college-age son's friends on the cheap, but it's not my idea of anything great. By the time it was cooked enough to start getting a nice crust, the corned beef and potatoes were becoming somewhat dried out. It needed ketchup, which to me represents failure.

Great dish--my husband's favorite corned beef hash. I added about a half a cup of heavy cream in the last few minutes of cooking which made it a special treat for Christmas breakfast.

Yummy! I left out the green peppers, only used 1/2 the horseradish (will use 2 Tbsp next time), and didn't wait for it to get "browned" since I couldn't see it happening with the "gravy" in the pan. Served an over-easy egg on top of the hash, toasted up some rye bread and it was delightful! Between this dish and a good corned beef sandwich, there is no need to eat the corned beef any other way than "leftovers."

My husband would rather skip the corn beef & cabbage and just have the hash. It is now a St.Patrick's Day tradition to fix this dish!

To cook from Los Angeles, try this. Brine for 4lb.beef (brisket,flank or plate)(or leaner if you prefer) Combine 3 qts.water,1/2 cup pickling salt, 2 tsp.saltpetre (I think this is what makes it red), 3 cloves garlic,2 tsp.pickling spice and 1/4 cup sugar. Bring to rolling boil,cool. Put meat in glass bowl,cover with brine,let stand 5-7 days (in fridge),rotating daily.weigh down so meat is always covered with brine. To cook-wash under running water. Cover with boiling water and simmer 4 hrs. or till tender.

What a fantastic finale to St. Patrick's Day! I actually omitted the horseradish (only because I didn't have only on hand)- but my famiy and I loved it just the same. This one's a keeper!

A gourmet version of a good old fashioned dish. I love the addition of horseradish, it gives it a new twist! Great with toast & some catsup on the side. Will become a favorite at my house.
