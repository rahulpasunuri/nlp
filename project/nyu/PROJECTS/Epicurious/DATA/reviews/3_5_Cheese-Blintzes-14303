Make farmer cheese very easily in about 2 h. Just follow any internet recipe. What a difference it makes in taste and texture.

I would reduce the heat after the butter melts and add butter occasionally. Baking is not the traditional method but probably much healthier. Also...the ingredients are imprecise. The butter isn't for the batter which isn't revealed until you are too deep into making it that it's too late. Doesn't make much difference.

Memories of Grandmother. Would make some changes: As previous reviewer noted, not enough wrapper batter for filling. Make two times batter for one times filling. Ricotta or farmers cheese both fine; I preferred the latter, but it is harder to find. Cinnamon optional; I like it, but not in blintzes. Didn't have a crepe pan, so used larger non-stick skillet and a scant 1/4 cup batter swirled around to get thin crepe. Serve with sour cream (low-fat okay) and apple sauce, for traditional presentation. Can freeze in portions.

Good taste but not enough batter for 10 blintzes thus ended up with more than half of the cheese filling unused.

This is a decent recipe. I didn't give it 3 forks because there are better recipes out there. I simmered 2 cups of whole blueberries with some apricot jam and served it with the blintzes. I also thawed some sliced Palisade (CO) peaches and served them as a sauce for the blintzes too. The peaches go so nicely with the cinnamon filling.

I thought this dish was sensational and so did my husband. I used 3 cups of whole milk ricotta and 1/2 cup of mascarpone (which I happened to have on hand) and served it with lingonberry jam. Like one of the other reviewers, I doubled the blintz recipe. Since it takes a long time for my oven to get up to temperature, I heated the blintzes in the microwave and will continue to do so in the future. The cinnamon is a great touch.

Just a note - I used Fresh Ricotta Cheese, if you buy the regular ricotta, use the "whole milk" but the fresh is so much better. I tried this out so I can prepare for an Easter Brunch this week. One of my sisters favorites is Cheese Blintzes and I wanted something special for her.

This was my first time making blintzes, I did not use the farmers cheese, just cottage cheese, and I made an fresh apricot compote with apricots, sugar, and lemon extract. They are So, So, So good. My Bulgarian husband wants me to make more soon.

Tasty batter & filling for these blintzes. I used the recommended 8" crepe pan and found that the recipe which claims to make 10 was only enough to turn out 5. Recommend doubling of only the batter recipe to sufficiently turn out 10 crepes.

My children and grand children love this recipe. Easy and delicious.

In response to the person who asked about a substitute cheese for farmer's cheese, I believe hoop cheese is similar. In case you can't find hoop cheese, cottage cheese is another substitute. I make a kugel using cottage cheese (instead of farmer's cheese) and it comes out great, very similar in taste and texture to the farmer's cheese.

Farmer cheese is a firm, white, domestic cheese. It has a mild, kind of salty taste. I have purchased it in the grocer's deli cheese aisle in prepackaged, 6" rounds.

Can someone please tell me what farmer cheese is? I am unable to find it. Is there a suitable substitute?

If you like blintzes, you'll like this receipe. These are pretty easy to make and yummy. We like to sautee these as opposed to bake and we add a little cream cheese (or neufchatel) to give the filling more substance. The crepe receipe is excellent.

Not to many people know about the filling being farmers cheese. My mom always makes this filling with hard farmers cheese.Very good. I've tasted all different types and this is the best.Even the House of Pancakes don't use farmers cheese.It's not as good as these. I top my blintzes with sour cream and strawberry syrup.

The recipe should include serving suggestions. I am familiar saute instead of baking; using butter and serving with sour cream &/or fruit topping(cherry or blueberries). This was a nice /spring summer dairy dish for Jewish cooks.

My grandmother, the owner of The Lakeview Hotel in Hunter, New York, many years ago, used a similar recipe. However, she fliped over the pancake and used cream cheese,not cottage cheese.

I was not sure whether or not to give this a 2 or a 3 because I did not find it all that wonderful. But I have never had (or made) blintzes before, and so for all I know it could be an atrocious recipe (or fantastic.. but somehow I don't think so). They were pretty simple to make, but they needed fruit or something to liven and enhance the taste. I used fresh blueberries, and they came out decent, but nowhere near amazing.
