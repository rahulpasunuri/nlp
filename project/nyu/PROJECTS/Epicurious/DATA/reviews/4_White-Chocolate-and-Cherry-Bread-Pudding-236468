I've made this a few times and love it! I'm not even that fond of bread puddings. We do sub the white chocolate for super dark chocolate, though. (I know, it totally changes the dessert, but it is so delicious!)

Delicious! Served for Xmas dessert and everyone really loved it. Agree that it makes for great leftovers served warm.
