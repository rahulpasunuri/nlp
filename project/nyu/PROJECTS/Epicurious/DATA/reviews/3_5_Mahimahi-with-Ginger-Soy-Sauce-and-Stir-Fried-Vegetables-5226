This has become a staple fish recipe at our house. Good with any white fish.

the coriander amount listed WAY overdoses the other subtleties of the recipe. Unless you are a coriander seed fanatic, use it sparing (or not at all -- the choice in our kitchen). This can be incredibly delicious!

This recipe was perfect! I marinated the mahimahi in the marinade for about 45 minutes, then cooked it in the skillet as directed. When I removed the fish, I poured the rest of the marindade into the hot fry pan and brought the marinade to a boil, then poured it over the fish and finished cooking in the oven. I didn't make the stir fry vegetables, but served this over brown rice and with the Green Bean Salad with Cilantro and Soy-Glazed Almonds recipe on this site. Delicious!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe. Its light, but tasty -- my husband loves Pacific Rim type dishes, and this is one of his favorites! One note: the stir-fried vegetable recipe should be doubled if you plan to feed four people!

very good. The first day, I omitted the coriander seeds and substitued cod. It was excellent. The second day, I used the seeds and substituted chicken, and again, it was delicious. An excellent marinade!

I skipped the corriander seeds and it turned out just great. We LOVED it. I used the extra marinade on some shrimp later in the week for a delicious salad feature.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! It will be a recipe I will always make. I used it on chicken because I didn't have fish on hand. It was great. If you like ginger, soy, and honey--this recipe is for you. So flavorful!

Wow, what a surprisingly delicious recipe! After reading the other reviews I realized that either you love coriander or you hate it. I didn't have the whole coriander seeds, so I substituted ground coriander which I sprinkled in with the salt and pepper. It gave that Thai accent to the dish without overpowering it.

Fast, fresh, phenomenal. The cooking times were right on.

A DISASTROUS recipe. My dinner guest actually spit out the first bite--the coriander seed totally ruins the fish, making it taste like a mouthful of soap. We rinsed the fish off under warm running water, and once free of the coriander seed, it tasted OK with the remaining ginger-soy sauce on top. Even still, the sauce was just so-so, and there are surely better fish recipes out there.

Excellent dish! I left the coriander seeds out and substituted serrano chile for the jalapeno. There were many levels of flavor to the dish, with the overall effect being that of Thai cuisine. The natural flavors of the fish held up well and were enhanced by all of the ingredients. Definitely a keeper.

This is overkill for the natural flavor of mahimahi. A bit of soy sauce and ginger, or lemon on pepper lightly patted on the fish and then baked in the oven or grilled on the barbecue is all this delicacy requires. Ten ingredients for anything is too much.

The coriander seeds ruin this recipe. The shells are too hard and the flavor and texture overwhelm the mahi mahi. I made half the recipe with sesame seeds instead and the recipe was good, not great.
