Still one of our favorites! Use this Tomato Salsa recipe not the tomatillo one they have linked it's incorrect http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/v iews/Cilantro-Tomato-Salsa-15592

Make sure you use the Jalapeño-Cilantro Salsa and Tomato Salsa recipe - the Tomatillo one was a miss print. To keep the goat cheese from melting out of the chicken, we use tooth picks about 2-3 in each one, take out before serving, we grill slow and do not turn chicken over (cheese is on the top in chicken) - comes out great every time!

I haven't made this since I have a question...the recipe says it is to be served with Tomato Salsa but the link is to a Tomatillo Salsa Recipe. Is this right?

The entire meal was delicious! It was simple to prepare and relatively quick less a little chopping and slicing. Both the salsas had way too much oil so I drained some of the oil from the salsas to coat the veggies. As a result the veggies had additional flavor. I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and cut a pocket for the goat cheese - this method held the cheese and turned out great.I served it with boiled new potatoes just like the picture. I combined the leftover salsas and will use them on French baguette slices kind of like bruschetta.

This is one of our favorites - we love the 2 salsas - combined with the goat Cheese Chicken and grilled veggies - it's the best! You have to try this one!

I don't know what exactly I did wrong, but after all the work of stuffing the cheese in the chicken, by the time the chicken was cooked, the cheese had all melted out and had totally flamed up the grill. Anyone who has tried this and been successful, please let me know how!

Our daughter rates this as one of her favorite dishes. She is 13 years old and is as fussy about her food as any I hae come across. My wife and I also list this as one of our favorite recipes for the grill.
