Oops! I used a 7-1/2" x 11" pyrex.

I took advice and didn't use lime juice. I made 1/3rd of the recipe in a 9" x 11" pyrex using 1/2 cup of 1% milk mixed with 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch. Otherwise, I added some ground cloves, cinnamon, chipotle powder and ginger with the brown sugar. I could have been more generous with the spice, but the sweet onion, yams and granny smith apple were delicious and moist. Definitely a keeper.

Perfect fall dish. I used butternut squash in place of the sweet potato and it turned out great!

Very good! Will definitely make this again. Didn't have whipping cream so I substituted fat free soy milk and it turned out yummy (and without quite so much fat). Also added a little nutmeg and ground cloves for added flavor. My husband says it's a keeper.

I made this quickly one evening with a white sweet potato, (don't remember the name) and I used a little bit of organic sugar because I didn't have brown sugar. It was amazing everyone was raving about it!! Very moist and a perfect sweetness!

I made this recipe halved using lemon juice instead of lime juice and it just wasn't that good. Adding blue cheese doesn't sound like it is going to rescue this.

I made this in May and while it may not be the most visually appealing gratin, it surely makes up for it in its uniqueness in taste. Great combination of flavors and very simple to make. I am making it to go with a ham tomorrow.

This recipe was just ok. I made it for Thanksgiving and less than half was eaten. I would try it again, but I'd cut the onions very thin, and use less of them. I'd also use more sweet potatoes.

Made this is a 9 x13, was a bit soupy (but much better than too dry). Relayered in a smaller more attractive casserole dish and added a bit of grated parmesan cheese between layers. Will reheat for Thanksgiving dinner at 250 for about 20 minutes. Flavor can only improve over night ; and if it is half as good as the bowlful I ate this afternoon this could be the hit of dinner. I think letting it stand overnight will allow for neat cutting and plating. Great addtiion to turkey day dinner for those who don't like the gooey sweet potato casserole.

Overall, this is a very pleasing dish. However, I think there are some inherent problems with the recipe. First, who has a 15x10 baking dish lying around? I used a 13x9 and it was just fine. Second, it's difficult to "layer" sweet potatoes and apples. Third, the lime juice causes the cream to curdle, not substantially, but enough that, combined with the layering, the dish just comes out sorta ugly. Next time, I will dice the sweet potatoes and apples and then mix everything all together before placing in dish. That should make the absorption and cooking rate of the contents even throughout, serving will be easier, and it simply won't be ugly!

This was a definite crowd pleaser. When very well with pork. I added some chedder cheese to the top when the foil comes off and it was FAB.

This is rich and delicious. You can make short work of all the slicing by using a processor. In my opinion, it serves twice as many as the recipe claims.
