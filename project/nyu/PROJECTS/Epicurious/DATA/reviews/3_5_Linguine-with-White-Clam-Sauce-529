I thought my own is good but...this is fabulous and perfect! Worsteshire ( regular or white) makes a huge difference - don't eliminate this if possible

This is the first time that I have prepared or even tried Linguine with Clam Sauce. I REALLY wanted to like it but this perhaps isn't the correct recipe for me. YUCK too much salt and too much cayenne. Everything included in the recipe served to mask the flavour of the clams. I should have known better about the cayenne and worcestershire. If there is a better recipe on the site someone please tell!!

Made this for my hubby, he absolutely loved it. He ate the sauce at the bottom of the bowl with a big spoon. It makes a lot of sauce. Really full of flavor and super easy. He wouldn't put any cheese on it, said it would ruin the dish!

This is a delicious, quick and easy meal to make. I have tried many varieties and this is the best yet. It's spicy but has the perfect amount of heat. Don't think of the cheese as an option; consider it a must! I used regular Worcestershire sauce like everyone else because I didn't have the white version, and it still tasted wonderful. Don't forget the bread and wine to go with this!

Only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne and regular Worcestershire and this is hands down my favorite clam sauce recipe. At Whole Foods, four cans of clams runs $18 so it's not inexpensive but easy and so good. Next time I will cut back on the cream and add some butter. For company I might throw in some clams in the shell at the end. Other than that, it's perfect as is.

Shop-Rite grocery store in NJ sells a plastic deli-sized tub of fresh chopped clams for $5.99. They are wild caught in USA. So much better than canned. Easy and delicious. I like to over cook the pasta for this recipe by letting it soak up all the liquid before serving.

Love this recipe! I wanted something that brought to mind Seattle's Old Spaghetti Factory's spaghetti with creamy clam sauce. This is SO much better! And easy, using mostly pantry staples. Sometimes I use Sherry for the wine and half and half for the cream - it's really hard to mess this one up! On the menu again tonight!

This recipe is easy and very very tasty. This has turned into one of my family's favorites recipe. When I don't feel like cooking that night I make this. I pre chop garlic and keep it in a jar with EVOO. and you do not need to use white wine Worcestire sauce the brown one works just as well..

Yummy. I was afraid the cream might make it too thick and gloppy (like a fettucine alfredo) but not at all. I used closer to 8 cans of clams since I tend to prefer it with more meat. Also added some shallots and anchovies with the garlic.

This is a very good recipe. I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and made the following adjustments: added 1 chopped shallot, used 3 cans clams instead of 4, added 3/4 cup clam juice, added 1-2 ounces of cream cheese, and tossed in a dozen fresh well scrubbed clams at the end and cooked until they opened. I believe these adjustments are what made a good recipe a GREAT recipe. WOW I loved it!!

i just made this tonight with only a few subs...i didn't have white wine...used light cream and added fresh spinach right after i added the clam juice and it wilted beautifully. to thicken it i added cornstarch at the end...everything else i follwed exactly..my husband and i LOVED it, very good flavor. will definately make again. the spinach really went well with this believe it or not!

Have made this recipe numerous times for my husband and two step-sons. Just finished another one tonight and my husband claims this is the absolute best WCS he's ever had. I use regular Worcestershire, and actually simmer the sauce down to a thicker consistency (atleast 30 minutes on simmer) before completing. I think the thickening adds to the flavor - I'd love to know for sure, but I can't eat clams!!! An absolute favorite by the men in this family!

This recipe was great! And it doubles really well. I didn't have "white wine Worcestershire," garlic salt or cayenne, but I did use regular Worcestershire and salt regular salt and it came out fine. I used a lot more olive oil too because I love the flavor (liquid sunshine!) and I like rich stuff. I used whole wheat pasta and you couldn't tell the difference... Creamier than most clam sauces which was wonderful and very, very tasty!

Very good but there's much better. Not sure @ the whipping cream bit, or why it's necessary. Also, I used about 24 REAL clams in addition to all those canned clams. Canned is sometimes like rubber. Just add the cherry stone clams (in shell of course) with the linguine. It'll take @ 5 min. for the clams to open. Don't forget to scrub the shells before adding to the pot.

OK. followed the recipe with only one exception. After reading other comments about the cayenne pepper being too hot for the recipe, I substituted Chipolte Chile Pepper - less heat and more flavor to my Texas taste. It was VERY good. Other than that, followed exactly and was pleased. Great, easy dinner.

Rating: 2
wow-too much cayenne. I like pepper but I went back and checked my measuring spoons to be sure I only used 1/4 tsp ea of white and cayenne pepper. I highly reccomend using only 1/8 tsp of the cayenne. I also used regular worstershire-it darkened the sauce a little. I recommend using a little less if using the regular kind. I only had 1 large can of clams but supplimented the juice with 1 jar clam juice. I am sure this did not affect the spiciness. Since I added a tad too much clam juice (lucky thing otherwise the cayenne would have completely overwhelmed the clam flavor,) I whisked in a scant amount of corn starch at the end to thicken. No problem. This meant I did not need to toss for 5 minutes to thicken. I added 1/8 c chopped basil at end of simmering.

Used 4# fresh littleneck clams and their cooking juices. I used the basic brown Worcestershire sauce with no ill effects. The sauce is a bit runny, but it worked just fine to place the pasta in the serving bowl using a slotted spoon. Delicious!

Everyone loved this recipe. Very rich, but made it for a special Valentine's Day and there were zero leftovers. Took a few tips from the other reviews: Left of the worcestershire sauce (couldn't find it) and used black pepper. Also added butter and extra cream for a thicker sauce and put in some fresh clams towards the end. Simply delicious for an evening where you're splurging and you don't want to spend hours in the kitchen.

I've made this recipe more than a dozen times over the past several years and it's always a hit and everyone always eats too much. I make it exactly as the recipe calls for and I toss it for five minutes with the sauce, as stated in the recipe, and it really thickens the sauce. It's perfect.

I adore Linguine with clams, and this is a notable version. It's a great fast meal on week nights but can be just as good for guests. I added a bit of Cornstarch mixed with wine to thicken it up and some fresh grated parmesan cheese. Next time I'll try the cream cheese trick.

This has become a comfort food staple in our house. I followed the recipe except that I used crushed red pepper rather than cayenne (1/4 t or more) since we like it nice and spicy, and I cut down the clams by a can. Make sure to cut the time you cook the pasta by at least 4 minutes. It will continue to cook and absorb all that sauce at the end while tossing with the sauce. Mine didn't come out runny at all.

Rating: 4
This recipe is absolutely delicious. I made a few modifications to make it low calorie because my husband and I are both on diets and it still came out fantastic. Here's what I did: I eliminated the whipping cream entirely, I reduced the olive oil to 1 tsp olive oil and 1 tsp butter, I reduced the white wine to 2 tbsp, and I reduced the amount of clams to 5 ounces (I used canned whole baby clams - yum!). The sauce came out a little thin so I mixed 1 tsp cornstarch with 2 tsp cold water and added it at the end. The sauce was still a little watery but so intensely flavorful that it hardly mattered. In my opinion, the white wine Worcestershire sauce is a must! It's worth a trip to the store if you don't have it on hand. The only thing we didn't like about this recipe is it was too hot (since when is white clam sauce supposed to be hot?). Next time I'll halve the amount of cayenne pepper, but I'll definitely be making this dish again and again.

This was extremely yummy. I had previously tried clam linguine out of the joy of cooking (my usual standby for first recipes) and it was such a bland recipe. My BF gave it an "F", but I knew there had to be some better recipe out there. I did add a little cream cheese as several reviewers suggested and i found it plenty thick, i liked it thick, but i think it would have been thick enough without the cream cheese once the pasta simmered in it.

Rating: 4
I was making a half recipe, and had about 14 littleneck clams. So I used one can (although I'm not sure it was needed) of clams along with the chopped fresh clams and their liquid. When using fresh clams, there is a great variable. The fresher the clam, the more liquor it has. So if you buy them at the store, you may have to add some bottled clam juice. Mine were fresh-dug and very juicy. I think they may be saltier too. I was worried about it so I didn't salt the pasta water, and used garlic powder. Listening to the previous reviews, I took my pasta out about 8 min before done and finished it in the sauce. I cooked it 8-10 min and the sauce was not at all thin. However, it seems that there is a lot of eyeballing the liquid in this recipe. My additions were a little bit of leftover pancetta (I sauteed in olive oil at the beginning) and a hint of nutmeg at the end.

I really liked this but my husband didn't. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have fresh parsley. I will make again probably - might try adding fresh clams. It tastes a lot like King's Fish House clam sauce. Mmmmm. I'm hungry for it just writing about it!

I made this recipe for my husband, and he loved it! He said to me that this recipe is a keeper. I would definitely make this recipe again for company, too. I agree that the sauce is a too watery, not watered-down in flavor, just physically watery. So maybe you'll want to add some cornstarch to thicken it up. The cayenne pepper and fresh parmesan at the end are great additions.

This is the best linguine in white clam sauce recipe I've tried so far. I make it often and even my young kids love it. Sometimes I substitute fresh basil (sweet or lemon) for the parsley. The sauce may seem thin, but when you add the pasta, it clings to it and works just fine...

Rating: 3
this is an excellent recipe as printed - only tweek would be in thickening sauce to your preference. The 'white wine' Worcestershire is a must - i think L&P call it 'worchester for chicken' now - still a really nice thing to have in your frige ! the worchester + garlic + hot pepper bit is really nice ! Canned clams work fine - want to get snazzy add a few real clams. This sauce rates with most i have had in nice restaurants

Rating: 3
I didn't use the cream or worchestershire but the real secret - that will add flavor and eliminate the watery consistency is to add undercooked pasta to the dish together with clam broth. I used the broth in place of the cream and finished the pasta in the pan. Just great!

Rating: 2
I made this almost exactly according to the recipe (didn't have the white wine worcestershire) and the taste was terrific, but as others have said, it was way too thin -- watery, in fact. If I make it again, it will be with cream cheese or some other thickening agent, but it's probably easier to just find another recipe. Having said that, it's cheap and easy to make, so if you don't mind the thin consistency, this is perfect for you.

I added extra wine and thickened it with cream cheese as someone suggested, but I added a little too much, so it was thick(similar to an alfredo). My husband loved it and except for it being too thick, I thought it tasted great. Very easy to make.

This was a really good version of linguine and clam sauce. We modified it a bit by omiting the worcestershire(did not have) and the peppers. We also halved the sauce since it was only 2 of us. It was so good and a great easy meal in a pinch since we started it at 8:30 pm. This one is a keeper.

The flavor of this recipe is rich, but I also found it a little too thin. I added cream cheese (4 Oz) to thicken the sauce and it worked extremely well. My 8 year old son, who won't eat anything that he can't put ketchup on, tried it and asked for seconds. You can doubt me, but don't question the flavor if my harshest critic came back for more.

I have been making this recipe since 1995, which is when the issue came out. It has been a family favorite ever since. I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce is not very thick, but if you refrigerate it,the dish is much better the next day once the sauce has had an opportunity to mesh the flavors and stick to the linguine.

Rating: 3
I thought this was very good. The only change I made was that I could not find white wine worcestershire, so could not use this ingredient. The only problem was that it was not enough sauce to my liking, so next time I will try making the same amount of sauce, but reducing the amount of pasta to 1/2-3/4 pounds. I might also play around with how it is prepared and use more wine and reduce it first before adding cream and other ingredients - I thought the wine should come through a bit more than it did. This dish serves WAY more than 4 for our family - I'd say more like 8 good-sized servings.

Rating: 3
This was a pretty good dish. I expected the sauce to be creamier and thicker (& simmering it longer did not help-- I finally just added a tablespoon of flour which I'm afraid might have compromised the taste some), but was not disappointed with the taste. Even better the next day for lunch!

Rating: 4
This is a fine recipe. Easy to prepare and quality flavor. I substituted regular worchestershire for the white wine worchestershire, black pepper for the white pepper and red pepper flakes for the cayenne. I did this becasue that is all I had in the house and the liguine turned out great. Next time I will cut the flaked red pepper in half as it was just a bit to spicey for this delicate dish. Excellent.

Rating: 4
Fantastic, and better than any restaurant. I used 1 tbsp each oil and butter to first saute 2 tbsp shallots, then I added the parsley and garlic. I was concerned about the quantity of garlic, but I chopped it coarsly and it wasn't overpowering at all. Took others advice and used 1/4 tsp crushed pepper instead of cayenne (didn't notice any heat at all). Used 3 cans of clams and added 1/4 cup of clam juice to compensate (4 cans would have been way too much). The white wine worchetsire is key in this sauce. To cut down on fat content, I used 1/4 cup fat free half & half and 1/4 cup whipping cream. After 10 minutes the sauce still seemed runny so I added a 1 tsp cornstarch/white wine slurry for perfect consistency. A final sprinkling of fresh black pepper and romano made this dish fabulous. New favorite!! Husband loved it and called today to say how great the leftovers were :)

Excellent clam sauce... not too garlicky, not too oily, not too heavy. I was skeptical about the cream addition, but it really worked.

We had linguine and clam sauce at a restaurant in Lake Placid called Jimmy D's. It was outsatanding and I looked far and wide for a recipe that was similar to the dish we enjoyed there. I tried this one and it was very close. I used half and half cream but next time would use the whipping cream to give it more richness (along with whole wheat pasts you about break even). I would reduce the cayenne in half as it was a bit warm and took away from the flavour of the clams. A definite keeper.

I also added 1 tsp of green tabasco instead of the white worcestershire and cut the cayenne in half which made it just spicey enough for our taste.

I thought it was excellent--also very quick and can be made with ingredients on hand. I didn't have the white worchestershire so left it out; substituted frozen pesto from the garden for the parsley. Definitely will be a favorite in our house.

We really liked this, but I'm deleting it in favor of Linguine with Spicy Clam Sauce--its no contest! If you liked this, you'll LOVE the other--check it out.

Definitely worth trying! My sister-in-law said it was just as good as her neighborhood mom & pop Italian restaurant. Very easy to make. Cream is a nice touch, makes it less watery than "average" white clam sauce

i made this recipe according to the directions but then added some flour/water to thicken it. it was still tasty,but next time i'll skip the flour and see how it comes out. i'll let you know...

This has become one of our regular weeknight dinners. It's quick, I usually have all the ingredients handy, and it's yummy. I've had to substitute milk or half & half occasionally for the cream with no ill effects.

An entirely adequate white clam sauce. But LINGUINE WITH SPICY CLAM SAUCE is much tastier. You can find this quickly by search for "Clams and jalapeno"

I've tried many clam recipes, and this is one of my favorites. We live on the beach & eat fresh seafood regularly. I substituted fresh clams (steamed and chopped) and bottled clam juice for the canned clams. It was awsome!

The cream gives the sauce a nice texture and consistency, without being as heavy as an Alfredo sauce.

This is an absolutely delicious dish! It is so quick & easy & you'll find most of the ingredients in your pantry. Myself I increased the parsley to 3/4 cup & the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. as we like our food with a bit of kick. Just a tip; use only the Italian flat leaf parsley; the flavor & texture make this dish.
