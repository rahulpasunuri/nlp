I used the Pepperidge farm puff pastry dough sheets and Lindt dark chocolate (made a few with goat cheese) and these tasted fine (PF dough is too greasy and only outside puffs up)... but I'm a bit baffled about the chocolate. Did no one else's chocolate melt to total liquid and run all over the bottom of the pan? I'm confused. I think next time, I will research and make a paste much closer to what pro bakers use for their pains au chocolat - perhaps cocoa powder and a *very* small amount of cream or butter.

Sorry, chocolate just not on the menu for kids breakfast! Made with asparagus and a touch of goat cheese inside and they were a big hit. I will try the almond paste and slivered almonds next.

Anything this delicious & this easy gets four forks, no question. Made these last night for a send-off on the first day of school, and there was much less whining. Ghirardelli's bittersweet chocolate, DuFour pastry, ended up with about 18 pains. Perfect.

Not quite, but with an ounce of chocolate, I can't complain. I halved the amount of chocolate used. This produces something more akin to the photo. Cut the dough into long strips so that you can wrap the chocolate at least twice. You can even taper the strips so that the pastry will be fat in the middle, and rounded on the outside (like the picture). If using Ghiradelli, use 2/3 of a square per pastry. Also, for you newbies like me, it helps to use flour or PAM on the preparation surface so that the dough doesn't stick when you are trying to roll it.

This gets 4 forks because in addition to being really good it was also extremely easy and quick and could be made with things on hand. Then my husband decided he really liked them and ate 4! I used the steam trick and my puff pastry definitely layered. Maybe not quite as pretty as in the picture but will work on that. I ground a mixture of sugar chocolate and cinnamon over them. Plan to try with almond paste and sliced almonds next time. I have had these in Paris and these weren't that far off.

I own my own bakery and had a customer request pains au chocolat. I used this recipe as the foundation, I did change a few things about it, and I made my own chocolate batons, but it was perfect! I highly recommend you don't buy cheap butter, in fact, I would avoid American butter altogether as they are either too salty or not salty enough for this recipe. I would also allow the dough to raise for 30 mins at 70F before doing the first fold. I also highly recommend trying white chocolate.

to preface: I used the pepridge farm puff pastry sheets that I use for all my puff pastry needs. If Ina Garten swears by them, I figure they are good enough for me. The resulting pains au chocolat tasted nothing like a true french pastry. If you have been to france or have a true french bakery in your town or city stay away from this recipe.

Okay, I made these for a memorial service for my father who used to eat bread and chocolate. They were awesome! I added a bit of vanilla to the eggwash. Tonight I am making them with almond paste and raspberry jam, topped with slivered almonds. Beautiful, easy, fab. Try these for the holidays!

I know I already reviewed, but I just wanted to let everyone know that these are really amazing, and another tasty variation besides the ones I mention before is diced Granny Smith apples with cinnamon, sugar, and lemon juice. For flair, sprinkle cinnamon on the pastries before you pop them in your oven. :D

Very good and very easy, although the recipe calls for far too much chocolate for pains au chocolat. I used *one* 4oz bar of Ghiradelli 60% Cacao bittersweet for all 24 puff pastry squares. The 72% works well too. tip: It is also easier to cut and handle the puff pastry when it is still mostly frozen. This recipe has a fantastic result for the effort it takes.

Nice, simple - how can you go wrong with puff pastry and chocolate! A very classy little companion for a cappuccino, a fraction of the cost of pain au chocolat from the coffee shop, and easy as falling down. If you want to make it even more like a bakery pastry, sprinkle a little coarse sugar over the tops after you glaze them. Beautiful.

You can't go wrong with these! Fabulous for those occasions where you want something simple but decadent to serve while lingering over coffee. As many have said, the DuFour's pastry is wonderful stuff if you can find it in your local stores.

To kenyee from Boston--you used filo, not puff pastry, which is an entirely different dough. This is why yours came out dry. Each sheet of filo has to be brushed with butter. It is much simpler and a lot less work to just shell out the money for the Dufour puff pastry.

The puff pastry dough used seems to directly determine how well this comes out. I found the Dufour dough at Whole Foods as some folks suggested and balked at the price, so I tried the Whole Foods brand (Filo Factory?) as well since it was $10 vs. $3. The Dufour stuff looks like a flattened piece of dough whereas the Filo Factory stuff was 20 sheets of thin dough. The Filo Factory version came out really dry and crunchy (probably need to butter or oil each sheet). The Dufour version came out fluffy and very buttery. For folks using the Trader Joe's pound plus chocolate, be sure to cut the little squares lengthwise so you don't have to try rolling around a giant squarish block of chocolate. The final taste was ok. I dusted it w/ cinnamon and powdered sugar and also tried the Trader Joe's lemon curd filling which was less messy (possibly because most of it leaked out; it's best to seal the ends of the lemon version). I might try it again just because it's so easy, but I prefer chocolate croissants...

I found this recipe to be easy and tasty. I used Dufour puff pastry. Fortunately I had two packages on hand because the 14oz package only contains one sheet. Silpat baking mats preventing sticking and allowed for easy cleanup. In addition to the chocolate (Trader Joe's Pound Plus Bittersweet), I tried lemon curd (Trader Joe's - about 1t per pastry) as a filling. I think the lemon turned out even better than the chocolate. I took these to a bookclub brunch and the leftover lemon curd pastries disappeared much faster than the chocolate.

Delicious (3 forks), but rates 4 forks for being so easy. I used Dufour puff pastry which I felt contributed to a superior product. Make sure not to enclose the ends of the rolls - this way the chocolate peeks out a bit. I used 70% cocoa Ghiradelli chocolate, but I actually think a semisweet chocolate would have worked better with this recipe.

Fabulously impressive? No, not so much. Perhaps my fellow L.A. cook was expecting something fancy and/or doesn't like a healthy amount of chocolate filling. I, however, thought they were very nice, especially considering how incredibly easy and quick they are to make. They were a hit with everyone, and I look forward to enjoying one tomorrow morning with a nice cup of coffee. Instead of squares, I sliced the pastry sheet in thirds (along the creases), then sliced each third in half lengthwise, then made one long cut-in-half the other way to form 12 rectangular strips. For those of you with a Trader Joe's nearby, if you cut the pastry that way and buy one of their Pound Plus chocolate bars (I suggest the Bittersweet bar in the brown package), you will find that one of the chocolate squares fits very neatly into each pastry strip; the pastry-to-chocolate ratio is good and you get that chocolate-peeking-out effect. The bar is easy to break with your hands, so no chopping is necessary. Of course, some chocolate will ooze out the sides of the pastry as you bake, but I've never heard anyone complain about getting to eat up extra melted chocolate, and with parchment paper clean-up is a snap. I think I might try adding some vanilla extract to the egg glaze next time in order to make them extra fragrant. A lovely, enjoyable pastry, maybe not super fancy, but certainly very presentable to guests.

These weren't very impressive. If you use good chocolate, they are edible. But my french husband turned his nose up at them. It was too much chocolate for a brunch for me. I tried it using crescent dough, which made them better, but still not great. It needs better dough.

Ubiquitous in France, I've searched for these in pastry shops all over the U-S with frustrating results. I'm happy I can make them so easily in my kitchen. For those who struggle with the shape, I cut the pastry in four inch squares and cut the chocolate into 3/4" x 4" bars. Placed on the end of the pastry, you roll it and it comes out perfect. As long as the chocolate is the same length as the pastry square, it will come out just like the photo. Oh, and I skipped the parchment paper. I just used a cookie sheet with Pam. So easy and the guests were very impressed.

I first used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate and my stitching group loved it; bought some callebaut yesterday and will try that tomorrow. Regardless of what chocolate you use, I would definitely cut down the amount by at least 1/3. Kept them warm for about 2 hours by transporting them in one of those Pyrex Portables doohickies.

Very good! Sprinkled powedered sugar on top, used Ghirardheli chocolate. There were so many, they lasted a week. Whole Foods carries Du Four pastry, but they were out, and so I had to settle for PF. I know that Du Four would make them even more fabulous.

My husband was saying how much he missed having one of these every morning during our honeymoon in Italy, and I coincidentally found this page the same day and happened to have one puff pastry left, with some dark chocolate from a previous recipe. So I whipped them up for breakfast and he said they were even better than the ones in Italy. I sprinkled cinnamon on half of them before sprinkling the sugar on top, and he said those were definitely the winners. Super easy, fast and very good. I think I will make this for the office's next pot luck Snack Day.

Good crowd food or unexpected guest treats. V. popular when still warm (caution: MUST cool few minutes before serving due to hot molten choc). Notes: 1 pastry sheet works perfectly with 1 Ghirardelli semi-sweet choc baking bar. I made this 1 wk before party and froze raw (& unglazed). Try to work with barely thawed dough if refreezing. No need to thaw before baking (took ~20 min). I didn't egg & sugar glaze (might try). Meant to serve w/ little powdered sugar on top. Turned out just as good when frozen as when I baked immediately after assembling.

Very easy. They remind me of all the pain au chocolat that I ate when I spent time in France (only those are bigger and more buttery). I wish I could find the buttery pastry the other poster mentioned. I've made these with PF pastry twice - for part of xmas breakfast and for a bake sale at work. They went fast on both occaisons.

A friend of mine brought these to our coffee hour at church and they were gobbled up in minutes. The only suggestion I have is to use Dufour puff pastry--it's made with butter, not oil and is far superior to Pepperidge Farm and other brands.

This recipe was very easy to make, and delicious. I ade half the recipe, which is a good thing. We devoured what I made, so having twice as many would have meant eating twice as much!

I'll definitely make these again, and will serve them with hot chocolate.

A friend of mine came over one Saturday morning while my husband and I were making these. She said, "Wow, you're pretty gourmet." Little did she know what a snap these are to make. I have big chunks of Ghirardelli milk and semisweet chocolates. I cut them into manageable pieces and put semisweet in some and milk in the others. These are little bites of heaven. I prefer the semisweet chocolate, but the milk is tasty, too. My husband, who's not even a big chocolate fan, actually requests these.
