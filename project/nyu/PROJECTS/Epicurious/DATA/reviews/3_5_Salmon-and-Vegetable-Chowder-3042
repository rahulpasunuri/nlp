Whole family loves this recipe. I have substituted a couple of green onions for the leeks, and canned corn. Really can't tell any difference. I crush the fennel seeds, and have used shrimp, or chicken that I had on hand. So easy and not heavy.

Very good. I used canned salmon, fresh fennel, 1 cup of reduced fat milk with 2 tbln of 1/2 and 1/2, and lots of lemon thyme. I also pureed half the corn and some potato and leek to make it thicker.

Very tasty. I was looking for something to make for lent without running to the grocery and this worked quite well. I had no smoked salmon, so I cheated and used canned salmon and a few drops of smoke flavor. I was worried that it would impart that nasty 'canned tuna-y' flavor (and that I would have wasted a glass and a half of good wine) but it was delicious. I substituted a finely diced bulb of fennel for the seeds and I served it with crusty bread and the aforementioned good white wine. I will definitely be making this again- probably next time with some good smoked salmon (to see how much difference it makes.)

Absolutely awesome, I used a bulb of fresh fennel in place of the fennel seeds and it turned out great. Also changed the heavy cream to 2%. That made it a touch thin, but the flavor was wonderful.

Was sadly disappointed. Nothing wrong with it, but certainly not up to expectations.

This is delicious, easy and freezes well. In the middle of the Blizzard of '03 here in the northeast, it hit the spot. This is in my recipe book forever.

I made this for dinner last week for my husband and I and it was delicious. I substituted a small thinly sliced fennel bulb for the seeds and could have added more. I used fat-free half and half instead of the cream to lighten it up and it was still great. After freezing the leftovers we had the chowder for dinner last night and it was still delicious and not at all fishy tasting which I was worried about.

Great tasting, and easy to make. With no zucchini or corn on hand, I substituted julienned fennel bulb, which made for intense, pleasing fennel flavor and interesting variety in texture. I also found it easier to cube the salmon when it was only partially thawed. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is really quite delicious and easy to prepare. I added a bit of finely chopped smoked salmon to perk up the flavor a bit, which worked great!

Its hard to give an accurate rating since I substituted a few of the ingredients since I didnt have everything on hand, yet seeing my 2 yr old gobble it up, I'd have to say, even my 'altered' version was really good. I'd make it again only because my husband just got back from a fishing trip to Alaska however I wouldnt buy salmon just to make this chowder.

As I usually do, I tried to create a low-fat version of this dish. Rather than a a tablespoon of oil, used 1 1/2 teaspoons and sweated the vegetables to soften them. Used whole milk rather than whipping cream and added a cup of corn pureed to thicken.
