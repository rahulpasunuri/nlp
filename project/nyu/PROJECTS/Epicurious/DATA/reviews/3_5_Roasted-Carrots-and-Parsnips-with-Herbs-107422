This is a wonderful recipe! I now make it for Thanksgiving every year. The only warning is that it is much too salty if you follow the recipe, and I am not a person who cuts salt on most recipes. I make it with 1 tsp and then add more salt if it is needed at the end.

I've made this twice, exactly as the recipie calls for. This is the first recipie that my kids will eat parsnips and wish I made more. Excellent and easy, since you put it in the oven and prepare the rest of the meal while the veggies carmelize.

This recipe was so simple to make and yet tasty. Instead of water I used 1/4 c. chicken stock to add a little richness. The seasonings are very nice the way they are but I couldn't help playing around a little. I made this a second time and tinkered with the seasonings. I substituted a little curry, cumin, ground cloves, coriander, cardamom and palm sugar with the same roasting prep. Absolutely divine.

A totally easy recipe that tastes more impressive than the effort it takes to make it because of the fresh herbs.

The next time I make this I'll reduce the pepper, a lot. But it's good and easy as a side dish. There are better parsnip/carrot recipes on this site. I'd like to give it 2.5 forks.

I didn't even know what parsnip looked like before I tried this recipe. It's a delicious, healthy and easy side dish to prepare. A good change from the usual potatoes.

the dish wasn't up to the norm in this website. i would make this dish again because i suspect the parsnips to have been the culprit, and i'd like the proof. simple roasted carrots are fine and simple enough. this was okay, but undeserving of the raves. i'll correct myself if the parsnips did me in, however.

Very nice and convenient side dish; I made it with the Daniel Boulud short ribs recipe. Both tasty and colorful, especially on a black plate. I cut up the veggies the night before, tossed 'em in a roasting pan with the olive oil and herbs and covered it about an hour before I was ready to roast them, then popped them into the oven at the last minute.

I always forget about parsnips! They are surprisingly good, I should remember them more often. The roast carrots and parsips work great with the rest of the holiday feast menu and were one of those dishes that do not take a lot of mental effort to get right.

A delicious and beautiful side dish to the Buffalo Prime Rib. The herbs were a great aromatic.
