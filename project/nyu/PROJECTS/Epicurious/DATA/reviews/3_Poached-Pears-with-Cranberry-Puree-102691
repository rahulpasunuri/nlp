I opted for this recipe for a weeknight dessert because I had all the ingredients. Following a couple of reviews, I lowered the proportion of sugar, as well as cranberries and OJ (2C berries, 3/4C sugar, 1C OJ). I also prefer the presentation of a whole poached pear, so rather than slice the pears I peeled them and cored them from the bottom, then poached them in the pureed syrup. The flavor was lovely, but there was still lots of extra syrup. A minor problem.

The visual presentation was the best part for me: the bright red cranberry puree made for a nice holiday dessert. However, I found the cranberry puree a little sweet. If I make this again, I will reduce sugar by half and serve about two tablespoon with each serving of three pear slices. My guests liked it, and commented on the pretty presentation.

Invited guests to dinner at the last minute and wanted a refreshing dessert. This was easy and quick. I served it with creme anglais and some long orange zest on top. Also added the most subtle amount of fresh ground clove to the pears as they poached, not enough to really tell exactly what the clove flavour was. This added a little something extra.

So good, and so easy! I made this for Christmas dinner, and served it alongside ham. It made for a perfect pairing & everyone had seconds. Preparation-wise, because of time, I boiled the berries etc, then let it sit for a couple of hours while I was out and about. Which meant that it was nice and cool when it came time to puree them, and the puree heated back up again in no time. So easy; I'll definitely make it again and again!

The cranberry puree was too sweet. Try the Butterscotch Pears!

DELICIOUSE! DELICIOUSE! BUT how can I make the juice thicker?

I made this for a dinner party the Friday after New Year's, and thought a lighter dessert would be the perfect end to the meal. The taste was delicious, but the poached pears were partially discolored when it was time to serve them. My husband said I should have made sure the pear slices were completely covered by the crandberry sauce when poaching them; he recommends a round of parchment on the top. I'll try this recipe once more, with his suggestions, as it tastes great. I whipped cream (slightly sweetened and with a drop of vanilla extract) and put a dollop on the top of the pears/sauce. It was great (and the cream hid the discolored pears!).

I brought this dish to a Thanksgiving dinner and the guests raved about it.

Quick & easy with extra points for presentation.
