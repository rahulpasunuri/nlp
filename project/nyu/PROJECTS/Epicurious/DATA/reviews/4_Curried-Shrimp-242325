I replaced 1/2 of the potatoes with chunks of couliflower...it was a great additions. I recommend trying the couliflower variation.

Made this for my wife the other day, because I got some really big prawns from Costco. I sliced the mango strips so thin that they almost disintegrated. I had even forgotten to buy some fish sauce, so I skipped that in the recipe, but it still turned out great. My wife took the leftovers to work the next day and called me during her lunch to remind me that she loved it. That was last Tuesday...she just requested it again for this week, so I figured that I had to write a good review. :)

This is an exceptional recipe - it comes together really fast and it is delicious!! Definitely going into the rotation. Don't skimp on the fresh basil - it is crucial. Next time, I'm going to chop the potato into proper cubes(I used a mandoline as a shortcut) and cook them in a pot of water instead of in the microwave.

Easy to make, good flavour. Will make again but next time would halve the coconut milk and add a little stock instead. A little too heavy / rich for my tastes.

Delicious and simple, I would definitely make this again as a weeknight meal.

Wow. Something really different. Tastes like it is Thai. I haven't had anything this interesting in a restaurant in years. Of course, you need to be careful with the fish sauce (because it is very salty) and with the sriracha (because it is very hot). I added both fresh basil and fresh coriander and substituted yellow squash for potatoes. Served it in a bowl since there was plenty of sauce. Forgot to add the sugar (but my mango was very sweet). It was wonderful.

This is so good! I'm eating this as I write. So tasty. I might say, add more potatoes or more shrimp and adjust for more coconut milk or pour over quinoa if you're hungry because this could easily serve two otherwise. I used green peppers I had frozen and that worked well, and what a great way to use up two mangoes that were on their way out. YUM!

We have now made this recipe twice and it was delicious both times! I can't believe how easy it is. It seems like something you would slave for hours over. We took everyone's advice and also cooked basmati rice. The second time we made it, though, I opted not to make it with the potato since we have the rice. I think that affected how the recipe cooked and was much thinner sauce, but it still tasted delicious. We are going to try it with chicken next time.

This is super easy and very refreshing. I really liked the combination of the spice of the sriracha (my all time favorite) with the sweetness of mango. I overcooked the shrimp a bit on accident, but the dish still turned out great. Don't skip the basil!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Ive been making curries for years and this was the best recipe Ive used so far. I made a few recommended adaptions. I added a teaspoon of cumin and turmeric to the curry powder. A small can of pineapple instead of mango and I used the whole can of coconut milk. loved it!

This was fast, tasty and fairly authentic. Next time I will add the shrimp in later to avoid overcooking. Otherwise, I made as written and wouldn't change a thing. Great over basmati rice. Definitely adding to the weeknight repertoire.

Made this recipe with just a few changes, no sugar added and scallop added to the shrimp. I used mango. Very good! Everybody loved it. I will make it again. Serve it over a bed of basmati rice.

I made this per the recipe except used a sweet potato in place of baking potato. It needed "something", so I toasted 1 t cumin, 1 t coriander, 1/2 t tumeric, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Really punched up the flavor. Added minced jalapeno too. Yummy-er and more like traditional curry without additional calories.

I made this for relatives and it was very good. I think the only change I made was I made it a little bit hotter and used less potatoes. oh, and no sugar. Mostly the changes were personal preference an this was easy to make and very very good

Fantastic easy healthy recipe. Ridiculously easy. I did substitute a small can of pineapple chunks including juice for the mango and sugar. Wasn't sure about the basil to start, but as the meal progressed it grew on me. Next time I make this, which I will, I would like to make some coconut rice (substitute 1/2 water for coconut milk) and serve the curry, potatoes and all on the rice. I missed the rice soaking up the sauce in this recipe. But again, couldn't ask for an easier, more satisfying, crowd pleasing curry recipe. Would also like to try it with just veggies, tofu, or chicken.

Very nice change of pace dish. Pretty easy and great flavors. My son and husband gave it a 6/7 out of 10. They both added more sriracha to their servings to increase the spice level. The potato pieces were flavorful because they absorbed the sauce.

This dish is just so easy and so good it's ridiculous! My husband wants to have it every night! I love one cooking vessle meals and this one hits the spot. I doubled the sriracha because I wanted more heat as I increased the potato. YUM

This was wonderful and easy to make and my house smelled like a London curry house after the meal - yum! I tinkered with the recipe a bit to give this a Thai-like experience: Did not use sugar - mango (or pinapple) is sweet enough Suggest adding an extra tablespoon of hot curry powder Added to recipe: About 3 tablespoons of Trader Joes red Thai curry sauce added with the coconut milk 1 bag of Trader Joes seafood medley (scallop and squid) in addition to the shrimp 1 clove garlic seasoned at beginning of cooking process Table spoon of minced fresh ginger Did not use fish sauce to reduce salt Added chopped tomatoes and black raisins before plating Garnished with chopped cilantro and graded coconut

This is a great start for curry dishes I'll make in the future. It was easy to make and yielded great results. Next time I'll add a bit more curry and sriracha and probably another potato. I served it over basmati rice and sprinkled the basil on right at the end and felt this really brought the dish together. Looking forward to leftovers today as I'm sure the flavors have melded overnight :)

Awesome dish! The mango is an essential ingredient that adds sweetness to this spicy dish. Next time I make this, I think I'm going to serve it over white rice.

We loved it! I didn't add in the potato or sugar and it was wonderful. I'm going to make it again tonight.

I forgot to mention that I didn't use sugar and the taste didn't suffer at all. The mango provides plenty of sweetness.

I love curries and didn't like this much at all; and my husband couldn't get past the first couple of bites. I found the idea of all that curry powder, which was visible in the final dish, to be really unappetizing. I would try this with curry paste instead. It also needed more flavor--more sweetness-- maybe more mango. Overall, in order to repeat this dish, I will start with the basic ingredients and experiment with curry paste and other sweet ingredients--like the pineapple that others have suggested. I agree that the potatoes also seem odd.

Forget the sugar. Nobody has mango in their house, open a can of pineapple instead and pour a little of the juice in instead. Makes a really good Thai dish.

Potato was great in this dish. Didn't have sriracha -- added minced jalapeno (had on hand) and red pepper flakes. Good and spicy! The basil is a must-do. My husband could take or leave curry dishes but he RAVED about this one! The house STILL smells great!

Yummy. Upon reading the previous reviewers disappointment in the potatos, I cut my potato in 1/4" cubes. This helped a lot with the flavor and consistency of the dish. Also, I added roughly 3 times the amount of sriracha (eye balled it). It was spicey, but that is how we like it. Before adding the basil I added salt to taste. This was an easy and tasty dish that I will make any weeknight.

I love a good curry, and this one has the "bones" to be great. I used chicken, didnt have any sriracha, minced a small Anaheim chile instead, and it was still amazing. The exotic, sexy smells and tastes that come from this dish are worth any trouble, but this recipe was simple and ready to go. Served over basmati rice and skipped the taters.

Fantastic recipe. Used chicken. Did not use potatoes, served over rice instead. Added pineapple, 1 1/2 TBSPN brown sugar and squeezed lime. Used regular coconut milk.

This was delicious. I followed the advice of previous cooks and vetoed the potatoes and served with a bit of jasmine rice, intstead. I used red bell pepper and added a full teaspoon of sriracha which added a good kick! It was very easy to make and will be a recipe I use regularly.

Rating: 3
Overall well received but if I make it again, I would double up on the spice. Not quite enough zing for my tastes. Also, I will do whole wheat penne next time in lieu of the potato just for the sake of the non potato fans in my house.

This was delicious and took less than 30 minutes to prepare. I didn't use potato, I didn't have sriracha, and I used regular coconut milk. The sauce was very thick and creamy, and exceptionally favorful-- there was also a lot of sauce (even though I followed the amounts for liquids. Perhaps the potatos?), so I served it over white rice. I plan to make this often as it was flavorful, well put together and easy.

Delicious! We made this using jumbo prawns and it was really enjoyable.

Skip the potatoes and use pineapples instead. Also, regular coconut milk makes it less bland (but not as healthy...) More sriracha!

Not my favorite curry recipe.

After reading one of the earlier comments, I boiled the potatoes (small red potatoes with the skins on) in a combination of the coconut milk and Thai yellow curry paste, then reserved the cooking liquid to make the sauce. I spiked it with a bit of lime juice and some extra brown sugar and it was delicious--definitely not bland!

Delicious. Also left out potato (was serving w/rice, so felt it wasn't needed) and added add'l sriracha for more spice. One of the better curries we've made!

Modified this to make 3 servings. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Totally forgot the basil at the end, and I don't think it needed it!!!! Will make this many times in the future.

This was a nice and easy recipe, but i thought the sauce was a little too bland. I think the potato was simply too much and the sauce took on too much of its flavor, next time I would halve the amount of potato the recipe calls for.

Easy, quick and delicious. Next time I won't use the potato as I didn't feel it added anything to the dish. Served over jasmine rice and it was a hit.

I didn't love this. While it was quick and easy, I found it a little bland. Maybe more curry and more sugar as well as more sriracha would help. It just didn't have the kick I expected. It was a very pretty dish though.

I'll say right up front that I made a few changes. I used red instead of green bell pepper and chicken instead of shrimp (it's all I had). It was really good and the flavor of the sauce was really great, I'm sure it would be equal or better with the shrimp ;-). I did really like how the red bell pepper went with everything though, I'm not sure I'd switch back to green if I made it again. I also accidentally used more coconut milk that was called for, but it still turned out really nice, just a little more saucy.

A very tasty dish. Served it over jasmin rice, and it was delicious. A few things that I think I will do next time. One, I think the potato tasted a bit bland. I think I will try to sear the shrimp, and take it out and add it back in the last few minutes. I am going to try to cook the potato in the sauce so that it absorbs some of the flavors of the curry. The recipe is quick, which is convenient if you are short on time. I will also add the bell peppers in with the onions, and let them cook a bit longer. Lastly, I seasoned the shrimp with salt. I used red bell peppers as that is what I had, but the green would make for a great contrast in colors. Great recipe.

Wow! This recipe was absolutely delicious. And with the mango and green pepper it looked beautiful as well. Just make sure that the potatoes are well cooked coming out of the microwave and that the green peppers are sliced really thin because once they go into the skillet you don't want to have to cook them very long so that the shrimp aren't overcooked. I will definitely make this again.
