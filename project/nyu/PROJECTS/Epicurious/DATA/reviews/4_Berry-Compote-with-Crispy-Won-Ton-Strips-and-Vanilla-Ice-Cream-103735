Delicious and easy. I don't like to cook the fabulous, delicate summer fruit we get so this appealed to me. It tastes fresh and lively, and it's a snap to make. The wontons add a wonderful crispness.

I think I made a similar one- but they are both great. WARNING- you will be asked to make this one again and again.. powdered sugar and a little choc drizzle make it so decadent!

Delicious, if a little intense. Men love it. It can get a little too sweet so I pull back on the sugar. Compote alone with less- sweet whipped cream or on angel food is great.

made the compote only... added more sugar and used chambord... have had better but this is ok.

I totally agree...this was so different and delicious. I did (for the sake of time and expense) use a package of frozen mixed berries, defrosted and drained. Then I did the "wine thing" and used Chambord. The wontons I fried and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Made a great addition.....this is a neat recipe for company

WOW!! Awesome dessert and soooo very easy to make! I do suggest cutting the won ton wrappers much thinner than 1/4 strips though. My clients raved over this!
