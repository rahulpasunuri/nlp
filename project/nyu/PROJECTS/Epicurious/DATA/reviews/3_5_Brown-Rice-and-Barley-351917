Am not a vegetarian, & after a long day of shoveling & spreading wood chips in a landscape feature I hope to develop, I almost went into town for a big, juicy burger. Then I realized I really had a hankering for brown rice. This recipe with pearled barley fit the bill quite nicely. Since it is just me, I halved the recipe, adulterating it with about 1/4 tsp of coarse Kosher sea salt at the start. In the last ten minutes of cooking, I violated the pan to add a can of Cream of Chicken spread with the back of a spoon over the top of the rice & barley, with just a bit of water to rinse the can. For me, this was awesome & deliciously delectable! Can hardly wait for the leftovers tomorrow, maybe with some apple slicees & a sharp cheddar. BTW: Ate this by itself: a bowlful and a half! Thank Epicurious; will remember this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and loved it! using a short or medium gran brown rice (instead of a long grain), means that the rice will get nice and sticky and will keep well in refrigerator! I made a big batch, put the leftovers in my fridge, and ate it throughout the week. Yum.

Very tasty, but so what? I could not taste the barley; no surprise since a 2 cup-to-1/2 cup ratio seems off balance. So the recipe seems just a brown rice cooking instruction. I did use 50% chicken broth instead of all water, because that is how I always cook these grains. Oh and remember one thing: Koreans eat astounding amounts of rice, so I'd say this makes 10-12 side dishes for those of other nationalities.

I used brown basmati rice and it was a bit dry-my fault! I'll try it with the regular brown rice and report back.

Couldn't be easier and loved the nuttiness of the brown rice and barley.

This has turned out to be my new BFF. My gosh, I'm the chef that thinks that if it is not complicated then it is not worthy. Not so. This is amazing. What a lovely taste. I used chicken broth but next time I think it will be beef. My kids loved it. Came back twice for the "rice". This doesn't need a thing (other than the broth substitution). OMG I will make again and again.

Very simple and easy to prepare! Has a thick, rustic taste and texture that sticks to your ribs. Very energizing. I will definitely make again, possibly using chicken or beef broth or stock instead of water, just for a kick of flavor. Also great cold! Perhaps mixing in some dried fruit like cranberries or raisins would liven it up a bit? Maybe a sprinkle of cinnamon?

I was afraid this would be bland, so I used chicken stock in place of the water. Turned out very nicely. Perfect texture.

This is a fantastic side dish - I've often found brown rice a bit dull, but the barley adds some great flavor. This goes with almost anything!

The water ratio stays the same for the rice cooker or whatever ratio you normally use.

Has anyone tried this in a regular rice cooker? I was wondering about how much water to use - should I increase and, if so, by how much?

this is delicious! The barley adds a slight nutty flavor to the brown rice. We have been making our brown rice with pearled barley since we first tried it.
