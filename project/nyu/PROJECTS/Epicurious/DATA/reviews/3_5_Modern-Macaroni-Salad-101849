The "modern" in this recipe refers to the "modern era" -- which began in the 1940s. Therefore, the word "modern" in the title doesn't mean "brand new, totally-updated spin on macaroni salad" as many reviewers seemed to believe. As it says in the subtitle, the pickles add a nice touch to an old-time favorite. This salad certainly does has a retro feel. It sings of the not-so-distant past, when canned and processed foodstuffs represented the future of home cooking.

As the others have said -- not sure what is "modern" about this recipe. My mother was making this in the 1960s. It is tasty and reminds me of my childhood. I added thawed, frozen peas -- just like Mom.

This one has been a favorite in our kitchen for years. Having made this recipe numerous times I have only two suggestions. One time I only had one 4 oz jar of pimentos (recipe calls for two). Seems to have balanced the flavor. Also, I use smaller pasta such as small shells or small elbows. Five 'Yums'.

Great recipe that delivers a crowd pleasing version of traditional macaroni salad. The slighly sweet and picante twist from the pickles and pimentos surprised my guests, in a good way. I've made this recipe 3 times, and it's always a hit.

Rating: 4
This is delicious. Seems more old school to me than modern and it's exactly what I was craving. I think it's very saucy and ended up cooking the rest of the 16 oz box of pasta and I think it's perfect.

I have only one question, what's modern about this? It's good, and I would make it again, but this is not new or unusual in my view. For those who complain it is too sweet, taste the mayo you are using, many brands are very sweet. With the bread and butter pickles I would venture that the sweetness of the mayo becomes more prominent. For a truly great high carb salad try Rosanne Cash's Potato Salad on this web site.

you know, this didn't strike me as very modern, given the use of sweet pickles and pimento, however, i think it's a lovely recipe that can, as we've seen in the comments here, be tweaked to accommodate individual tastes. like others, i used some of the pickle juice instead of sugar. i also upped the lemon juice, and added sliced green pimento-filled olives, as i didn't happen to have a jar of pimentos handy. i love the crunch of the celery, and could see adding a few other chopped vegetables to make it more of a meal. that said, i think it's a fine recipe, and i look forward to enjoying it again..

This macaroni salad is always a hit. I have made it several times and last night I used picollini (wagon wheels) pasta because that was all that I had in the pantry. It may have improved the dish. Recommend fewer pimentos but otherwise the recipe is super. Great accompaniment at cook outs. Serve chilled.

Rating: 4
Overall a great - simple recipe. Nice flavor - good crunch - good color. I added a little pickle juice (bread and butter) to thin out the dressing and make it little less creamy / thick. Also added a little brunoise carrots for extra color - and garnished with some grilled red peppers.

Great recipe! The sugar scared me, so I ommited it completely. Added chopped tomato instead, gave it some sugar and great color Based on other reviews, I cut the mustard in half. I added about a tablespoon of Sriracha hot chili sauce, and next time I'll probably do 2 tablespoons. I did not use pimentos and green scallions. Instead I did a half cup chopped red onion, and soaked them in cold water for 5 minutes. In addition, I added green pepper for some even better crunch and color. Make sure you salt and pepper thoroughly at the end. Wonderful!

YUMMY!A good basic recipe to play with. I read the reviews and followed the advice to add 2 hard boiled eggs; a small green pepper & DILL pickles. I didn't have pimientos so I substituted 10 small green olives w the pimientos inside.That turned out to be really good. Also used a small red onion instead of green since I had them fresh in my garden. Plus a bit of fresh THYME. I think the ratio of mayo to dijon is a matter of taste. I started with 2/3 cup mayo and kept adding 2 tbsp of dijon until it tasted good. For me that is 4 tbsp. Then I squeezed in the lemon. No sugar necessary. DELICIOUS!

A very tasty version of macaroni salad. My family and friends gobbled it up. I'm making it again. I tilted the balance to a bit more mayo, and 1/3 cup mustard to soften the tanginess a little.

We love this macaroni salad. Based on other reviewers, I have eliminated the sugar and use fire roasted jarred peppers instead of regular pimento. I didn't have bread and butter pickles so I chopped up Tony Packo's sweet hots pickles & peppers. I buy them on Peapod.

Rating: 3
I made this after reading all of the reviews. The recipe called for Bread & Butter pickles, which are sweet. Based on the feedback, I went with dill pickles since those are my favorite. We also substituted minced red pepper for the pimento, and it was delicious! We made it "vegan" and used Veganaise instead of regular mayo and it was great! A nice change from the same-old, same-old.

YUCK!!!!!!!! This recipe was absolutely disgustingly sweet, and I didn't even add the sugar. I was going to throw it out and my husband asked me to try my cooking wisdom and change some things. Definitely would use dill pickles instead of bread and butter pickles. It made the salad overly sweet. I added 3/4 cup of sour cream to help neutralize the sweetness and 3 TBSP of fresh cut basil. It definitely helped but I won't be using this recipe again.

I made this yesterday and it was good...I did however make some changes ...I omitted the sugar and the bread&butter's and added chopped dills...instead of pimientos I roasted a red pepper ...and instead of green onions I used a red onion...I also added dried oregano,thyme,dill& red pepper flakes...also a tad bit of relish...chopped blk. olives and a few chopped sundried tomatoes....and diced green bell pepper....So basically I used this recipe as a base ...and a good one it is...just needed a little sprucing up :)

After reading many reviews, I made my own take on this recipe, and it was TO DIE FOR!! I used Kraft low-fat mayo, 1/8 cup Dijon & 1/8 cup French's Sweet Onion mustard, omitted the sugar, decreased the sweet b & b pickles to 1 cup, added about 1/3 cup of Vlassic Stackers sweet red pepper strips (that needed to be eliminated from the fridge), and accidentally used diced pimientos. When it was fresh, it seemed too sweet, so I added a 2 oz. can of sliced black olives (drained), and a bit of salt. Tonight Hubby & I had the first of about 4 more leftover portions, and it is EVEN BETTER than the first night. CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE MORE!!! A few chopped hard-boiled eggs would be good in this too...

I lovd this recipe! I added 3 hard cooked chopped eggs and some chopped green pepper. Didn't have the dijon on hand so I used spicy brown and an extra T of sugar. Next time I may try adding some matchstick carrots? Yum!!!!!!!!

I have made it twice. The first time I used the only mustard I had on hand, which was a three-pepper mustard, and it turned out fantastic. I made it a second time with the mustard called for in the recipe. It was still good but not as good as with the three-pepper mustard. So I will make sure to use the speciality mustard when making it.

As with everything (see the comments below), this recipe should be adjusted for your taste. I used half the mustard; I think the whole amount would be too much for most people. I also think theat the amount of pickle called for would be excessive for most people.

Wouldn't even rate this one fork but I had too. Made this again and still cannot eat it. Way too pickley for me and everyone else. this was far worse than the macaroni salad that you get out of a 5-gallon bucket at the cut rate neighborhood deli. YUK! Back to the dumpster!

I made this for a holiday gathering, and the tangy flavor was liked as new for macaroni salad! I increased the mayonnaise, decreased the mustard and added juice from the pickles, for a creamier salad. I substituted slices of red onion garnish for the green onions. Solves the onions or no onions dilemma. Pimientos didn't seem to really complement this salad, so I didn't add them. I really like the bread and butter pickle taste, and I'll definitely make this again.

I cannot imagine how anyone wouldn't love this salad. As another reviewer commented, it is very creamy when first made, but once it sits overnight, the dressing is absorbed by the pasta. I followed this recipe with two exceptions: I substituted diced Roma tomatoes for the pimientos because that's what I had on hand, and I added celery seed because I have always liked it in macaroni salad. This is a vast improvement on what I have been doing in the past, and I will continue to make it this way. If you want to give it a prettier look, you could dust the top with a little paprika or cayenne pepper.

This is a great starter; but like most recipies, it should NOT be followed exactly. Some improvements to make are: use shallots instead of the onions. Use celery seed instead of celery. Nix the pimientos (maybe in favor of red peppers). Use 1/2 sweet pickles. Add a good amount of balsamic vinegar, and herb-it-up with some parsley and oregano. I made my own version and everyone loved it.

This was a good recipe. I did made it for two family events and everyone enjoyed it and a few asked for a copy of the recipe. I love creamy macaroni so I add two tablespoons of ranch salad dressing to give it a extra special taste. If I make it for my husband & I, there's always leftovers so the next day or two when we eat it again I usually have to add another teaspoon of ranch dressing as mayonnaise doesn't do the trick.

I too am not a fan of macaroni salad but my husband is. And he LOVED this. Up to now I've been making this vague bland salad with celery, chunks of cheese, and onion. This is really great. Since he is a fan of sweet I used the bread & butter pickles. It was really good. I added a little hot paprika to off set the sweetness and also used jarred red bell pepper instead of pimento. If there is a call for macaroni salad, this is it.

I'm still searching for the perfect macaroni salad recipe, but this is the best I've tried so far. I used fat-free mayonnaise. Purists will cringe, but if you are trying to get saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories out of your life, a recipe like this where the mayo serves as a bland vector for other flavors is a perfect place to go fat-free and still satisfy your craving for a forbidden food. I couldn't get pimientos and so used water-packed Italian roasted sweet red peppers. I happen to like bread-and-butter pickles and think they give just the right sweet-and-sour tang, but anyone trying this recipe should choose his/her pickle carefully and go for quality, because the pickle is the dominant flavor. I served this as a side with the spicy oven-fried chicken from this site, a nice marriage. For a nice presentation, try a tomato rose with some broad-leaved parsley.

I didn't follow the recipe precisely, adding peas, ham, and chopped hard-boiled egg, using dill pickles instead of bread-and-butter and leaving out the celery. Also, I used an herbed mustard instead of Dijon. The dressing was absolutely delicious. Add or take out whatever you like from the salad, but keep the dressing as is.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and I doubled it, which is very easy to do with this recipe. The second time, I made some modifications. Instead of bread-and-butter pickles, I used regular pickles. Much better for my tastes. I also used vadalia onions, in season now. A suggestion: if you are making this and serving it right away, cut down on the mayo and mustard. Overwhelmingly creamy. If you are making this a day ahead of time, use the amount that the recipe calls for. The pasta absorbes the mayo and mustard quite well.
