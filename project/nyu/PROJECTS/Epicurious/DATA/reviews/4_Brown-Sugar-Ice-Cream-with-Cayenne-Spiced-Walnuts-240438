This is really good and I agree with the previous reviewers that the nuts, odd as they seem, really lift this recipe to another level. I used pecans--we don't like walnuts--and they worked wonderfully. I do have a nagging desire to try salting the nuts with kosher or sea salt too in the toasting step--a mix of sweet/hot/salty is our most favorite flavor and I am missing the salt in this one...I am not sure if it would just be absorbed in the ice cream when added at the end, but I may try it next time.

delicious. perfect texture. the spiced walnuts, while they sounded odd, were the perfect way to balance out the mapley sweetness of the ice cream.

Really outstanding - we make lots of ice cream in our ice cream maker, but this was by far the sparkling standout. We would be pleased to get this served to us at the most expensive restaurants we've ever visited!

Everybody liked this. While making it, I had my doubts until I added the walntus. The spicy walnuts is what makes this ice cream.

We have made this recipe twice now, adjusting the amount of sugar the second time. It is delicious but, as written, is too sweet for our taste. I cut the brown sugar back by 1/4 cup, and it was perfect. We served it with bananas foster, and it was a wonderful match!
