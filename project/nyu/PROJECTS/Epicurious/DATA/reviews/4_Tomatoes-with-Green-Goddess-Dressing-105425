Marvelous! If you don't have chives, the white parts of three scallions will suffice.

Great as written and easy to modify as desired. This is a go-to dressing - last minute success with whatever you have on hand. Greek yogurt or sour cream can sub for mayo; whatever green herb you wish!

A tried and true winner with or without the tomatoes.

This is a refreshing dressing, but we also used it as a veggie dip. Make it just as the recipe reads! Terrific!

we had this as a sauce with our raclette last night. I accidentally froze my chives so I just used extra scallions. I think I upped the parsely and vinegar just a little bit (to make it more green and then to balance out the extra herbage). This was very tasty. Will use it as a dip with vegetables and I'll try and thin it out for a salad dressing.

This was so, so delicious! I added a bit more chives and anchovy paste.

Sorry to be the lone dissenter here. Even with the freshest best ingredients I could find I was rather disappointed. I really love tomatoes and felt that their essential taste was lost here. I brought this to a family BBQ and indeed there were leftovers. I suppose it doesn't help that we are not big mayo lovers, but I was disappointed that it didn't have a "greener" flavour on the whole.

Way too easy for such good flavors. Will be sure to make this again. Good for a dressing and also a dip. Keeps well.

I have made this twice in the last week - once for salad and tomatoes and the other as a veggie dip for a party. It was amazing both times. I did make a few adjustments such as adding about 1/3 cup of sour cream and drizzling a bit of olive oil for a creamier consistency. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect as is. I plan to try it next as a dip for artichokes, and I can't wait.

Pretty good stuff! I used 2 anchovies instead of the paste, and they added a great depth to the flavor. Next time I might cut back to 1 anchovy, though, since the flavor became more pronounced after the dressing had sat for awhile. I served it with grape tomatoes, but we ended dipping all sorts of other veggies in it, too -- carrot sticks, celery, cauliflower, crackers, etc.

Very nice and easy to prepare. Would be wonderful with any crudites, and also good as a dip for fondue meats or a shrimp "dipper". KIMBER

I didn't think I liked Green Goddess Dressing until I made this. It's awesome. Besides the tomatoes, I've been eating it on broccoli, crackers and everything else I can get my hands on. It would be delicious on fish, shrimp, lots of different vegetables, etc. It's very thick, so it makes a great dip.

This was easy and quick. And really good. I especially liked the fact that it is non dairy. I used it on tossed salad; I think it would be wonderful on poached salmon too.
