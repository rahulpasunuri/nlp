A simple and delicious recipe that can be made during the week. I made some minor changes to help clean out the fridge. I only used 1 cup of panko, chopped seeded jalapeno, bag of spinach and chopped and sauted an onion along with the mushroom stems and added to the mixture. I used feta and parm versus mozz just cause that's what I had on hand. Enjoy!

I really liked this recipe. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added zucchini. It tasted good, but it made my panko soggy so I was missing that crunch. I added the sun dried tomatoes and those are keepers. I also chopped up the stems and added them to the stuffing. I'll definitely make again and even experiment with other stuffing items. I really don't think you can go wrong with this recipe. it's a great base.

I altered the recipe a bit. I added a diced zucchini and tomato. I used regular seasoned breadcrumbs, but only 1/2 cup since I added the veggies. Baked at 400 for 8 or so minutes because it was raining badly....turned out great!

It's become one of our favorite go to recipes. I think that the panko just puts it over the top. They are still crunchy the next day when having leftovers. I didn't make any changes and didn't feel that I needed to. Perfect recipe for the grilling months.

My husband made this for me last night. He substituted provalone cheese for the mozzarella and chives for the green onions, and a little more garlic than what it called for and it was delicious! The panko bread crumbs give that crunch which makes this recipe a 4 fork.

We just loved these! I actually added ground beef to the stuffing because my fiance cannot fathom eating a meal without meat. Like others I cooked them in the oven (10min @ 350 and another 3min under the broiler) and added some crushed red pepper flakes. The flavor and texture was perfect.

These were wonderful. I scaled it down to 2 portobellos and the only change I'd make next time is use a little less panko.

These were delicious. I used fresh mozzarella and added crushed red pepper to the marinade. Also I didn't use any butter and don't think I missed out on much. I grilled first then finished under the broiler to crisp up the tops. The recipe is great as is, but I think next time I will mix some spinach or roasted red peppers into the stuffing.

I scaled this recipe down for only 2 portabellos and added some chopped sun dried tomatoes to the filling. As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for a new portabello recipe and this was fantastic. I took the advice of previous reviews and put the mushrooms under the broiler, as it's not really grilling season. I would have liked the mushrooms a little more cooked, though, so next time I may bake than at 350F and finish under the broiler.

I used fresh oregano and thyme from my garden, but had to broil them due to the time of year. Thought they were very good and will make them again during the summer. Tasty and substantial altenative to meat burgers.

Loved them as did my company! I used less than half the butter and broiled them in the oven until brown. I used fresh italian parsley and oragano. I had one left so i cut it up in my lunchtime salad the next day. I'm thinking they could be amazing with pine nuts in a pasta too!!

Fabulous! I made these for my vegetarian friend who adored them, but the real surprise was her red meat-eatin' husband who raved about them. Definitely will make again and again.

We loved this recipe! I let the mushrooms marinate at room temperature for a couple of hours and then baked in a 350 oven until the panko turned brown. I serve two per person with steamed broccoli and buttered noodles as our weekly vegetarian meal. This is great to serve for company with crab meat mixed into the stuffing.

Delish! Any easy to follow, flavorful and filling vegetarian recipe. I do not have an outdoor grill only a grill pan, so I finished it by popping it in the broiler for about 3 minutes until the top was slightly brown.

Served these to guest and everyone really liked them. I didn't do the butter step but will next time because the topping was a little too cruncy.

Fabulous!!! Made it in advance and popped in the oven when guests were arriving- they ate every last morsel.

The key to turning this dish into a 4 fork dish is to use excellent Mediterranean extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I get mine from TulasShowcase.com. They have the best oils from Greece and fantastic vinegars from Italy!

This was a simple quick meal to pull together. The topping was wonderful. As suggested by another reviewer I did change the oregano for basil and added a few dried tomatoes. Really nice flavor and texture. I did use a good quality balsamic vinegar and didn't think it was overpowering at all.

These were outstanding! The only change I made was to use basil instead of oregano/thyme. This is a great base recipe that you could play around with for a lot of flavor combinations.

THESE ARE VERY GOOD, AS OTHERS SUGGESTED, I DID THEM IN THE OVEN PRIOR TO A PARTY AND THEY TURNED OUT PERFECT. EVEN MY PICKY BROTHER IN LAW BROKE DOWN AND HAD A COUPLE AND SAID THEIR WERE GREAT. CANNOT WAIT TO TRY THEM ON THE BBQ!

Made this for a large family get together....we were all so pleasantly surprised with the flavor and outcome....the preparation was easy too which makes it a keeper for future dinners...several guests even asked for the recipe.

I had much higher hopes for this recipe after reading all the wonderful reviews, but it turned out to be very disappointing. My BF thought the taste of balsamic was a little overpowering, while I thought that the mushrooms were just bland (and maybe why the only flavor that came through for him was the vinegar). What a waste of high-quality, fresh ingredients!!

Excellent. Sub Fresh Mozz and Sundrieds for a variation. Basil. Very, very good.

We love this recipe. So easy to make and the taste and look was very good. I didn't grill though. I baked at 350 for 10-15 minutes and then broiled it at low for a little bit... can't remember. Will definately make again. Maybe for a party next time since you can prep in advance.

I have made this dish several times and love it. My guests always want the recipe. I use fresh mozzarella, which makes it quite decadent. A keeper!

Quick easy and delicious! Made the stuffing and cleaned the mushrooms early in the day, then when I came home in the evening, just marinated the mushrooms while the grill was heating, assembled and grilled. I think if your's turned out grey and flat, they were overcooked as mine held their shape well, but were hot and melted all the way through. My kids were bummed there weren't leftovers.

Fantastic, found this website yesterday in my search for a Portobello Mushroom recipe to make for a last minute dinner party. So easy and they taste so good, I even replaced the Panko breadcrumbs with just the normal ones and it still taste good!

Loved it just as it was printed and have made it a couple of times as an appetizer to a big Italian dinner.

I thought this was delicious but ugly! My portobellos became very flat so they ended up looking like grey pancakes. They also released a lot of liquid so I had to put them on a paper towel on the serving plate so they weren't swimming. Definitely did not look like the picture. Maybe over-cooked?

I've made this twice now to rave reviews. The recipe makes a lot of filling, I had a lot left over so try to buy the biggest mushroom caps you can find. Also, I used Parmagiano-Reggiano (which I always use in place of regular Parm), which added alot of flavor. Another reviewer suggested adding a little more mozzarella and parm at the end - Great idea!

I used this recipe for a dish to serve to my vegetarian friends at a barbeque, it was such a big hit, even the meat-eaters wanted some. Also very easy to make.

mea culpa........it did say medium heat

Am not sure what flavor was missing for the person who said it was tasteless! Perhaps they forgot to add something. Anyway, followed suggestion of another about adding salt and pepper. Next time I will probably just add pepper because of the salt in the butter. Recipe didn't say, but I did them on medium heat on gas grill (I love my Weber Baby Q). Didn't have any fresh Parm on hand so used pre-grated combo of Parm, Romano and Asiago which probably kicked up the flavor some. I made half the recipe using enormous mushrooms, but had quite a bit of filling left over. Made it with grilled bourbon glazed salmon (took the shrooms off, turned heat to high for a minute, put salmon on for 3 minutes, turning at halftime) and a simple salad with roquefort dressing but could see a good cole slaw (which, in my book means a dressing of mayo and a good splash of lemon) going well with it, instead.

Delicious and easy! Two changes though--the recipe didn't call for any salt and pepper, which I thought was odd, so I added some. I also didn't have fresh oregano and thyme, so I used dried and cut the amounts to 1/2 t. I served this as a side dish with grilled pork chops last night to rave reviews and I plan to serve it again this week-end as an appetizer. This one is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic! I didnt use the panko crumbs but bread crumbs instead that worked fine. Would have topped the mushrooms with some more mozza & parmesan cheese blend during the last few minutes of grilling.

I followed the recipe the first time and thought that it was pretty good, but the next time I added spicy Italian sausage and they were great! Diced pepperoni would probably work well too.

This recipe was a big disappointment! It had absolutely no flavor (way too much panko), very bland and not worth the time.

Very easy to make. Just used store bought balsamic drsg and added diced roma tomatoes. Have made it twice already & will continue to make it again.
