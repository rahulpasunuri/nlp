We love chocolate. We love peanuts. And we love coffee ice cream. To us, this recipe was an attempt to combine three great ingredients that just didn't work. Mine looked exactly like the photo. The flavors competed with the ice-y cold textures, and the peanut and chocolate flavor lost out. The richness of the ice cream was fine without the frozen chocolate. The peanuts seemed to soften with freezing, losing all of their appeal. Pretty yes, but no fun to eat.
