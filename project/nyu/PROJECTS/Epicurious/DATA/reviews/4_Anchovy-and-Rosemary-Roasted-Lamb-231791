Excellent recipe! Very easy and goes over well with everyone. Very tasty and will make it again and again.

So succulent and flavorful. The anchovy does not taste fishy, just adds depth of flavor. Don't overcook. Err on taking the lamb out on the early side and check temp with thermometer. Definitely let it rest, at least 15 - 20 minutes if not the whole 30. Temp will come up a little as it rests. Don't forget to pair it with the salsa verde! It's here on the Epicurious site, from Gourmet April 2005.

You cannot go wrong with this recipe (thumping my wooden spoon for emphasis) I have used bone in/ boneless leg of lamb and yesterday - lamb rack. I usually just blitz the marinade in a blender/chopper. Marinate half a day and into the oven! Watch the temperature. set off my smoke alarm once! For the lamb rack, I pan seared all sides then into oven over a bed of half done potatoes for about 25 mins, rest 15-20 and it was medium rare.

Very good but not great. I modified the cooking procedures somewhat - marinating the lamb for 7 hours, bringing to room temp for 1 hour, then baking 15 minutes at 425º followed by the remaining time at 350º.

Nothing but rave reviews for this Easter roast. Simple and delicious.

this was an easy recipe to make but the depth of flavor is practically michelin star restaurant quality. i only strayed from the recipe in that i had to let this marinate overnight to cut short my prep time for christmas eve dinner. this dish was so delicious. i served it with duck fat roasted potatoes and we were in heaven.

This has become my 'signature roast lamb'. Perfect roast for winter, summer, spring or fall. This time I was only making for 2 so used a lovely 375gm cut of lamb fillet marinated all day and cooked for 15 mins rested for same. Served with fennel gratin from this site, and buttery roasted potatoes. Totally yummm.

I used this recipe at Easter this year, and also add the zest of 1 lemon to the paste and it was delicious. I didn't tell anyone about the secret anchovy ingredient and it got rave reviews from even the lamb 'skeptics'. I also tried this on the BBQ (a Weber)with a butterflied boneless leg. Sear it on Direct High about 4-5 minutes per side, then change heat to Indirect for the balance of time (about 35 minutes for medium/medium rare depending on thickness of the meat). It's easy and definitely a crowd pleaser!

this is a great way to prepare leg of lamb. Did not find semiboneless, so I used the whole thing, not tied. It came out succulent and delicious. Not fishy at all, I was actually looking for the anchovy taste, since I like it. Seved with garlic roasted potatoes. Yum!

This is a wonderful Easter dinner! The anchovies don't taste "fishy" at all-in fact, the lamb is absolutely succulent. I used a probe thermometer to achieve a perfect medium rare roast. Make sure to use a rack, as the roast generates a lot of rendered fat.

I made this lamb recipe for Easter dinner to rave reviews, even from guests who would say neither lamb nor anchovies were favorites. Honestly, it is not fishy at all. This was a moist and delicious, easy roast. I was skeptical of the 140 temperature, but it worked perfectly. The varying thickness of the leg meat provided well done to rare slices to everyone's preferences. The only changes I made were to trim off some of the thick fat layer and to marinate overnight.

WOW-this is good. Whole family loved it. Didn't tell the family about the anchovies and you don't taste anything "fishy". Followed the recipe except used a rolled boneless leg of lamb and cooked on the grill. Next time I will use slightly less olive oil in the marinade.

Out of this world delicious. This is the recipe that got me into my residency, I think. I pulled it right up on my interviewer's computer and she must have been impressed! I have also made it for a new mom and her husband and they said it was the best baby present they received!

This recipe is the most fabulous recipe I have ever made for Easter. We used to grill on the Weber, but never again after this! I didn't tell the guests it was anchovy until after though, they were supprised! Will definately become a family tradition.

This was amazing. Used the paste as a marinade for lamb to be cooked as shish kabob.

Wow! The flavor here is exceptional! Just an FYI... don't worry about the flavor of the anchovies, it's the garlic that really comes on strong here. The rosemary does a fine job of toning it all down, but I wouldn't plan on being too intimate with someone after this meal unless they have it too! Mashing the anchovies into paste is fairly easy so dont sidestep it and use the anchovy paste cause it may have fillers that affect the taste. Also, take note of the weight of your roast and adjust the cooking time so you dont over cook the lamb. A smaller roast will cook much faster. Made an excellent Christmas eve dinner. Cant wait to try it again.

Managed to sneak this one by the picky eaters who "don't like" anchovies; they literally didn't know they were there. Incredibly easy to make (my definition for a great recipe), with fabulous results. Would say 3 1/2 forks if that were an option.

Tasty. My husband has changed his mind about disliking anchovies ... the rosemary complements perfectly. We grilled, rather than roasted.

The anchovy adds the salt which complements the lamb. I've made this many times and am constantly giving the unchanged recipe to friends and family.

The crust was fantastic and the lamb was delicious. For those of you worried about fishiness, it's not there. But you can always rinse the anchovies after draining them to further remove the fish oils.

It was that good! The lamb was succulent and very tasty. The marinade did not hide the flavour of the lamb, but really enhanced it. The anchovies seemed to make the lamb so savory. Mind you, we ordered the leg of lamb from a butcher. I don't know if it would taste as good with frozen leg of lamb. I made the recipe with oil packed anchovies out of a jar and pretty much made the recipe as it is written. I did however, add an extra clove of garlic and was generous with the rosemary and black pepper. I had many requests for this recipe :)

I recently made this dish for a dinner party and everyone, including myself, loved it. There were even a few guests that don't usually care for Lamb, and still it was a big hit! The only let down was that the yummy rosemary and anchovy crust falls off when slicing. Also, I used a 4.5 lb piece of lamb, and was able to feed 8 people and have scraps leftover for the dog. This recipe makes a lot. I can't wait for Christmas or Easter so I can make it again. Loved it!

i have been hesitant to try this reipe as there are only 2 of us - a leg of lamb will serve so many (and is kinda spendy) and quite frankly my extended family is not very adventurous. i was most excited when i found a butterflied, boneless leg of lamb at my meat market, at 2 1/2 lbs. i figured (YUM) sandwiches!!! i also thought thank goodnes i won't be eating lamb for a week. i did everything according to the recipe except that i grilled it on the bbq for about 7 minutes per side and let it sit 7 minutes. it was perfect. i served it with the salt-baked potatoes from this website and a simple green salad and i, all of a sudden, feel like julia frickin' childs!! my only worry is that no one wil be able to find this great recipe because you must enter "anchoveys and rosemary" along with "lamb" in order for it to appear on this website - sigh - such a tragedy!!!!

One of the unfortunate things about this dish is the amount of time you have to wait till you dig in. What happens if you DON'T let it sit for 30 minutes? I love lamb and I love anchovies. mm mm mm mm mm. Sit me down with a nice cabernet, and I'm all set for Easter!!

I would and am making this recipe again. I didn't find the lamb to carry a fish taste at all. Anchovies seemed to add salt and crunch, but no fishiness. I've made it before and am making it again for Christmas eve dinner.

added olives to the paste - unlike the other reviewers, I thought it was a bit fishy, which I didn't mind, but didn't love

I added olives to the garlic and anchovy paste and I thought it was a nice added flavor to upset fishiness of anchovies. Was not as pleased as other reviewers with result overall

I've made this one several times, the anchovies don't taste a bit fishy and they add a wonderful zippy taste, even though they are not crunchy when reheated. Also, instead of using a rack, I oil a glass baking dish, put halves of potatoes on the bottom and sit the meat on top of the potatoes. Then when it's got about 20 minutes left, I throw a few cups of sliced mushrooms into the bottom of the pan.

very easy to prepare, and tastes DELICIOUS. THe whole house was filled with the aroma of this dish, and my husband and I were dancing around the oven in anticipation. we got a very good cut of the lamb, thanks to our great butcher in Brooklyn, and the flavors complement the meat perfectly. I recommend marinating it for a few hours to get a nice balance of flavor. And don't overcook... lamb is so much more delicate and tasty when cooked medium/rare. Enjoy!

Oh My Gosh!!! I grew up eating lamb and this is (dare I say it) better than mom's! I used anchovy paste (is what I keep on hand) and was fantastic. Next time will try to make a thicker coating on top before roasting (we fought over who got those crusty bits!)

I should add to my review below that I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies--I usually substitute that where anchovies are called for (caesar salad, etc.) and the flavor is alaways great.

We thought this was wonderful! For convenience I used a butterflied leg and roasted it in the oven. The marinade was something special and made the lamb very savory. We have lamb often and this preparation will, I expect, become a solid favorite.

Excellent dish, don't be scared off by the addition of anchovies if you don't like them, I made this for two people who strongly dislike anchovies, and they loved it. No fishy taste at all. Delicious!

Easy recipe, and very good. I butterflied the roast and really rubbed in the anchovy paste. Butterflied lamb leg is great - due to its varied thickness some meat is rare, some medium rare, and some medium well so everyone's happy. Although I prefer beef rare, I've found that lamb is more flavorful when cooked a bit more.

Rating: 4
The lamb was tender, moist and the coating was just the right mix of flavors. I removed some of the fat from the surface of the lamb, in large slabs, scored the surface of the meat, coated the meat with the marinade and then placed the thin coating of fat over the top of the marinade. I won't wait until next Easter to make this dish again!

I never mince the garlic but put garlic splitters into cuts into the lamb and do this as long in advance as possible. I baste with 1/3 or marinade, cook 10mins then repeat this twice followed by a considerably reduced head (medium at most) and a longer cooking time - approx 1.5hrs for medium rare. Never cook more than medium rare - its a pity for good lamb. Gari

This was a wonderful recipe which I made with a lovely boneless New Zealand Lamb. I didn't tell my husband or son there were anchovys in the marinade until they had finished enjoying their meal. I made with oven roasted asparagus.

Also served this for Easter dinner to rave reviews. Missed the salsa verde, however. I made a gravy with the drippings that was quite flavorful. Will check out the salsa next time!

Excellent combo of flavours. If you don't like strong anchovy/too salty taste - rinse them first. I mashed all the spices - incl S&P and 1tsp mustard seed together to stuff into the slits. Salsa verde was great - substituted cilantro and reduced the anchovies. Not exactly like I've tasted in Italy - but a good compromise when you're out of parsley.

The whole family loved this dish. I also agree that the SALSA VERDE improves the dish. Thanks

Served this for Easter and was delicious, very flavorful and easy to prepare. I'll definitely make it again. I also recommend serving the lamb with the salsa verde, a mix of parsley, mint and anchovies, as suggested with this recipe as it appeared in the magazine.
