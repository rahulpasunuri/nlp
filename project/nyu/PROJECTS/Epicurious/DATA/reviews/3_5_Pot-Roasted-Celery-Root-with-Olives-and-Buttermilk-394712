Alright, so lets admit that the ingredient list seems a little odd in combination. Push through your anxiety and make this recipe anyway! The flavors come together beautifully- reminiscent of artichoke hearts. I substituted a sprinkle of instant coffee grounds for the coffee beans, and used one large root quartered and peeled (scaled down the recipe to serve 2). I couldn't stomach cooking it unpeeled as it was fairly dirty and I just kept thinking about how many grubby hands had been on them. Otherwise I prepped as directed.

Delicious combination of unexpected flavors... strong herbs... coffee!? Wow. The only celery root I could find was over a pound each - so - I simply quartered them. Turned out delish and the dinner guest raved about it! Save whatever juices you have leftover for dipping or drizzling - too many flavors in a sauce to discard! Made delicious risotto with the leftovers.
