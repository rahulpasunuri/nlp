Very tasty and easy. Made with Yukons and added fresh ground salt and pepper before serving.

I served this salad today for a brunch. It was really nice with the porto-glazed ham. For the look and to save time, I used frozen balled potatoes. They were partially cooked and I finished cooking them in the oven for 20 minutes after tossing them in 1T of the vinegar and 2T of olive oil.

A perfect warm side for a cold winter night. Served with bratwurst and red cabbage.

This is delicious. I added shallots which added a nice flavor.

I made this for our Boxing Day brunch and it was delicious. I used new Charlotte potatoes (so no peeling or chopping necessary)and added the vinegar to the bacon drippings to cook down a bit before tossing with the potatoes. Thought it would be nice with leftover ham but not a morsel was left!

This works for me too! I only have a handful of potatoes on hand, so I did not follow the recipe to its exact measurement. I used center cut bacon which did not yield too much fat (I so desired).

The cook fro Alexandria VA was absolutely right try this recipe... I made it with Ceaser salad and parm, chicken... it was an awesome accompanyment... I was sceptical... but seriously cook the bacon in the olive oil... It makes a beautiful warm vinergrette... for boiled potatoes...

I made this for dinner last night, following the recipe as written. It was just OK in my opinion, my husband didn't like it at all. The only positive comment he made was "it isn't greasy". A waste of potatoes and bacon.

After actually making this recipe, it was delicious. The e.v. olive oil added flavor, don't leave it out. The little portion of leftovers will be enjoyed later fried or with mayo/ sourcream & celery. Cook once, feed twice...

Sounds like an appealing dish, but (1) there is no need for the olive oil, given the use of the bacon grease, and (2) I question the need for 3 lb of potatoes - to serve 6 people? Few folks will eat a full 1/2 lb of potato salad as a side to their meal. Also, thinly sliced shallots would be a nice addition, perhaps in lieu of the chives.

It doesn't seem that high to me, since that works out to 2 tsp of bacon fat per serving, and that would be if all the bacon fat actually got absorbed into the food, which I would doubt (unless you not only made sure you scraped every drop out of the container in which the potato salad was tossed, AND mashed the potato into any drippings left on your plate). I think it sounds delish and plan to make it for my next gathering.
