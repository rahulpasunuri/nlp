I was looking to duplicate a recipe, Roasted Aspargus & Egg w/Bacon Vinaigrette that I enjoyed at Kensington Grill in San Diego -- this vinaigrette came very close in flavor. I served the vinaigrette over roasted aspargus, very good flavor; would definitely make again.

We use this recipe, with one addition, as a vinaigrette for fresh fish. We add chopped artichoke hearts (canned), and sautee along with the shallots. We plate the fish on a bed of fresh greens like arugula or spinach, then top with the warm vinaigrette. It is fabulous. For those concerned about the fat content--with 2 parts fat to 1 part vinegar, this is no more fattening than your average vinaigrette.

This is absolutely fabulous. Definitely going to make again. I was out of shallots, and used red onion, and it came out just fine.

Used turkey bacon and it was delicious!

Just had to let you know this recipe is awesome. I've been making it since it appeared in Bon Appetit in 1998. I serve it warm over spinach and goat cheese. After years of myself and sisters making it from memory I'm printing it. You know how recipes get distroted after years of adaptation. Give it a try. You'll use it again and again. Easy starter if you prep the pan of dressing in advance and reheat before tossing.

Excellent! (I did use less sugar than mentioned in the recipe though.) Apparently bacon in the UK is less fatty, as I did not have any drippings, but I substituted olive oil and a small amount of butter in the skillet. It turned out perfectly fine, but the drippings sound even better. I also included warm broad beans in the salad, which worked really well.

I should confess from the start that I don't care a fig for cholesterol or fat content. Superb flavors and textures, simply achieved are worth an occasional splurge on the Ole calorie meter. (From my point of view) You can't hope to get the intended impact of this recipe without doing the balsamic deglaze, and slight reduction step, though the addition of sugar makes it a bit too sweet. IF I want to reduce the fat content, maybe I'll leave out the olive oil, heh heh. The thing I've enjoyed most about this recipe is the horror with which the use of 3 little spoons full of bacon drippings seems to have been received. What did you people do with the actual bacon, toss it out? Did you not notice it had fat in it? Get a wonderful sense of sinful wickedness, make and relish this recipe with glee.

I served this over spinach for a wilted salad. It was delicious!

I mainly make dressings from scratch. I made this one without the bacon fat and without heating (no reduction). So I reduced the vinegar and garlic and added more olive oil. Still tasted great. More like a souped up basalmic dressing, but the shallots and sugar were a nice touch.

This was superb. I poured it warm over spinach to make a wilted salad. I too have issues with the amount of oil/fat so I probably won't make it very often, but it was terrific.

A little less balsamic vinaigrette next time, but still very yummy.

I made this dressing to serve over baby spinach leaves. It was a little too sweet for me, next time I will put in less brown sugar. But it got rave reviews from my guests.

This vinaigrette was hard to rate because even though it was good, I had trouble dealing with the amount of fat used. I probably won't use this recipe very often.

This dresing makes a terrific wilted salad using either boston or romaine lettuce. I serve it to my family at least once a week
