I didn't follow this exactly, and it ended up alright. Nothing cooked long enough together to have a cohesive flavor, and we may have used too much bell pepper, so it was very pepper-and-chicken-y, as opposed to a dish with a dressing. Light and simple though.

I'm not sure what other home chefs did when preparing this meal but I would say it was "over the top" good tasting. I did exactly as the recipe called for and my guests thought it was a perfect restaurant quality meal. I prepared polenta as shown in the photo. I bought polenta in a plastic tube and followed instructions to warm it. Then I took it out of the wrapper and mashed it (like potatoes). I added chopped fresh parsley and a couple scoops of low fat butter. It looked just like the photo. This is going to be a staple in our home. Easy to make and quick.

Very easy, but a little dull. Next time I'll add more lime juice and mint as those flavors disappeared. Also, maybe use a jalapeno to zip up the spice. Kind of reminded me fajitas without the tortilla and toppings.

Like other reviewers, I found this rather bland given its name. A poblano chile is not the same as a pasilla as the recipe reads. Poblanos are very mild, while pasillas have some zip. That would have made a difference.

Correction to previous review, I meant to type poblano, not serano, when describing a mild pepper.

Good solid meal when you're looking for a quick affordable mid-week supper or 2nd night for chicken breasts. I had everything in the house except the poblano, so it prep was easy. I served over polenta, as suggested, which gave the kids an opportunity to skip the peppers if desired. Next time I'll try the suggestion to stagger the veggies, since that may allow more flavor/heat of the poblano. Those who want spicier could always leave seeds during prep.

Not spicy, not very peperonata either. The peperonata accompanying a grilled sirlion here is far better and like the one I've had in Italy. Seranos are very mild. I can't figure out why they labeled this one spicy. A bore. I probably should've given this no forks. Okay now seems like more praise than its worth.

Made as described excepted substituted yellow for red onion. Served in corn tortillas with mexican cheese. Probably will not make again.

This was a big hit at our house. Substituted basil for the mint, which also was nice.

This was a nice variation on "chicken for dinner again"....used thighs, both boneless and bone-in for more flavor, plus that's what I had on hand. Added a jalapeno that needed to be used as well as the poblano, but still mild. Also used all baby peppers. Served over creamy polenta. Liked the lime/mint combination, but if I did it again, I think I would use more lime to brighten up the flavor.

Very good. The limes adds a nice flavor.

For a quick dinner, this was a very nice recipe.

Eh, pretty good, but just too bland for my taste. Not sure I got the "spicy" part of the dish that the name suggests. The mint all but disappeared in the dressing. Maybe a mixture of mint and cilantro with finely diced serrano chiles would make this dish pop.
