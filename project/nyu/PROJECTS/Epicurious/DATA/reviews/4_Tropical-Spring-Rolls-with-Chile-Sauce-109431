Very good. The sparseness of the filling is ok if you really enjoy shrimp. It also allows the flavor focus to be on the sauce. We thought the fish sauce component of the sauce was a little bit too strong. Otherwise, delicious!

Awesome spring rolls! I did add ingredients to it. I added bean sprouts and diced water chestnuts. I've made it several times and everyone raves about it! The chili sauce is the best!

I consider myself and egg roll connoisseur and these are the best egg rolls I have ever had! I've made these many times. This is the best sauce and it's addictive! Mae Ploy is the bomb!! I actually followed recipe to the letter (a rarity) except used canola oil to fry.

Good sauce! I have friends asking for more!

I should have reviewed this long ago. I make this recipe several times a year as an appetizer. Excellent! The sauce is definitely worth making and delicious as a dipping sauce for other things, like grilled shrimp, etc. The shrimp can be difficult to cook properly, so I often split the rolls open to check on doneness, and re-insert them into the oil. (You likely want them split anyway for nicer presentation.)

I made this for the chef and owner of a great restaurant as well as a bunch of friends and they all raved about it. It really does matter to get the wei-chuan spring roll skins. The only change I made was to add a little plum sauce (maybe 1/4 cup) to the sauce.

This is a delicious recipe & very easy to make! However, the filling does not hold very well so I added 1 egg white to the filling and it holds very well.

I will prepare again and so will 10 of my friends who requested the sauce recipe. Easy to make and my serving dish was empty at the end of the party. No so for the other dishes on the table. I added a tsp of fresh ginger to the shrimp and on the second batch used precooked shrimp, added 1 tsp of ginger and a bit of soy sauce. Next time I would like to try precooked shrimp and baking the rolls.

Made this multiple times. The sauce is really great, definitely the selling point. I also added finely sliced carrot sticks. The frying adds crunch, but the rolls are also good (and healthy) just fresh.

The chile sauce was a hit! It was 10 times more popular than the spring rolls!

My friend made these first, and now I'm taking them to a party. Great! I used the left over sauce for dipping sauce for chicken fingers...

Very good recipie. My only changes were adding some raw scallops to the shrimp as well and it worked perfectly. My spring rolls held together fine, but I did use the recommended brand, so perhaps it was the thinner wrapper. Also, next time I make them I'll reduce the sauce quantities by half since we really didn't eat it all and I can't think what else to use it for:)

These were terrific - but the next time we make them, we will make them as fried raviolis. The taste of the shrimp filling was fresh and light, but they did not hold together very well. But no changes to the sauce - it is excellent as is!

I've made these twice so far, and will be making them for my cousin's wedding shower this summer. All guests have absolutely died over them & my boyfriend thinks I'm a cooking goddess... So easy and delicious. I'm still working on the dipping sauce, since the recommended chile sauce wasn't availible at the local asian market...

Excellent! Very simple but tasty. The dipping sauce was a bit too spicy for my husband and me. We added a bit of prepared sweet and sour sauce to tone it down.
