I love this recipe and its very easy to make I can do it from memory. It is always a big hit.

Wish I had read the reviews prior to beginning the recipe. Fortunately, I read them while the orzo was cooking, and took the suggestion of adding garlic, lemon juice, and tomatoes.

It's odd that some reviewers gave 3 forks, yet the only similarity to the posted recipe seems to be the corn and orzo! Much better recipes out there.

Wish I had read these reviews before I made this salad. Yuck. Worse than tasteless-- it tasted downright weird.

This is one of the worst pasta salads I have ever made. It was tasteless, ugly to look at and slimy. It's not worth tinkering with.

What a complete waste of good ingredients! I tried all the tips from others and still it was tastless.... I ended up adding a bottle of italian dressing to save it whole mess!

Boring! I added lemon juice and more salt and pepper and I still thought this had very little flavor. Won't be making it again.

Great recipe but definiely needs additions. For the dressing I followed previous reviewers advice and added 2 cloves of garlic, lemon juice, coarse salt and ground pepper and left out the water. I also doubled the feta and added a few nice ripe tomoatoes. The best way to approach this recipe is taste as you go and add what you think it needs according to your tastes

I didn't think it was as bland as some people have mentioned. It's important to use fresh corn though...the frozen stuff didn't do it for me. I will try the additions that were suggested, and hopefully it will be even better!

This is a great salad to make in the summer because the flavors are light and refreshing. It's not a hearty dish that will fill you up or overwhelm you with flavors, but it really hits the spot on a warm summer day. If you like other summery foods like chilled vegetable soups, you'll probably like this as well.

Although the recipe sounding promising, this was horrible. As other reviewers warned, it was very bland.

This gets 3 forks because of the modifications I followed that other reviewers suggested -- I can't imagine how bland it must be unaltered! I made the following changes: used a flavored feta (tomato-basil and garlic-herb)and increased it to 12 ounces; added a garlic clove and juice of 1/2 a lemon to the dressing; increased the chives to 1/2 cup; added 3 plum tomatoes that I seeded and diced; added 8 oz of kalamata olives that I pitted and quartered. It was tasty and delicious - perfect for a summer day. However, it serves a lot more than 8 - more like 20.

To the cook from Kansas - hope you check back - its been a while since your post. Orzo is a small rice-shaped pasta. It looks a lot like rice, but you'll find it with the other dried pastas. Here I find a small pasta called Rosamarina(?) which I believe is very similar. It's worked for me in the past for recipies calling for Orzo.

Please tell me what orzo is? Here in the midwest, where us ignorant farmers live, we don't even know what orzo means, (let alone if we want it or not)could you please define that?

This can be a great recipe with a few additions! The reviewer who wrote that it serves more than 8 is correct -- as written it makes way too much, can easily serve 15, so halve it! I got raves for this salad with these additions to the dressing: juice of 2 lemons plus zest of 1 lemon (eliminate the water). Definitely go heavy on the chives, and be generous with the salt. Also, I recommend adding the dressing while still warm, then the cukes later so they don't get all mushy. I used the firmer english seedless cukes (although I needed 3 huge ones to get the 4.5 cups)

Agree that it definitely needs something more. Not worth the effort. And unless I read the recipe wrong, it serves a lot more than 8.

I read the previous reviews, and thought this salad had a good base, I added tomatos, green pepper, radishes, greek olives,additional chives and a little chopped red onion. The color of the salad was very attractive and a hit at the BBQ

This was a little disappointing. It needs something more. A little too bland for my taste.

Not much taste. Maybe blue chesse next time? More herbs?

This dish needed more flavoring! I added some diced tomatoes, coarse salt, and a little italian dressing and used the tomato flavored feta- it did taste pretty good after that.

Had to halve the receipe as I had only 8oz of orzo left.Used fresh picked garden cukes and chives.I increased the amount of chives-it turned out great.

I made this for my husband's dinner/birthday party. Added diced red pepper for color. It was fantastic!! A great do-ahead recipe.

This was good and easy and light, but nothing amazing. If I made it again, I might put in more of just about everything except orzo, to change the proportions.
