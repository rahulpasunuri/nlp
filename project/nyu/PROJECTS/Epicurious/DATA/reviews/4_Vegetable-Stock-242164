It's a good recipe, however, it is rather pricey considering the output. The ingredients required are more expensive (leeks, celery root) than what it used in other veggie stocks. At the end it's cheaper to buy a quart at Trader Joe's than make this so I don't know that I'll make it again.

I agree, it does need a little salt. But it's delicious! I used this recipe to make risotto and it was a success! I charred the onion in a charcoal grill... I think it has more of the "smoky" flavour. I wrapped the onion in tin foil and put it directly among the charcoals. Great recipe!

Great recipe. I'm a chicken stock fan myself, but needed an alternative for vegetarian friends. I feared that I might have been better off using the boxed stuff, but this was Super easy and super delicious. Needs a little salt
