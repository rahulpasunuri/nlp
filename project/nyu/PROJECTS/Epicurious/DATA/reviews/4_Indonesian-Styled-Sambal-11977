the proper name for this is acar (achar) and in Indonesia it does not have pineapple, but cukes, carrots and shallots. also no soy sauce, just vinegar, a small amount of sugar and a few whole chili peppers.

This should definitely be renames. A sambal is added to food to give it extra heat, not to cool it down.

This is definitely not an Indonesian sambal. Although this might taste good, you could confuse lots of people. Indonesian sambal generally consists of red chilies, shrimp paste, tomatoes, no pineapple nor cucumber.

This is a lovely recipe to cool down some of the hot foods in Indonesian cooking. However, the name Sambal is a misnomer. My father, a Dutch gourmet brings Sambal home from Holland. It is similar to a Mexican salsa only saltier, and it is very spicy. You add it sparingly to your food to heat, not cool, it.

Excellent served with an Indonesian rice table. Like a cool down dish similar to the cucumber and yogurt served with India food but much better. Difficult to find in your index maybe it should be renamed as Sambal to me is a collection of spices that is added to Indonesian food to heat it up..
