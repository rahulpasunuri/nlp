Wonderful, warming recipe with great flavors that work well together. Perfect for a Colorado winter day.

This was really good both the day of cooking and as leftovers the day after. Couldn't find currants in the shop so used golden raisins, and was surprised that the fruitiness stilldidn't overpower. I know where I used to go wrong with these recipes now - I never used enough oil. Despite the large quantities, nothing feels greasy - it's lovely!

I ramped up the anchovy a bit--by using anchovies AND a half tablespoon of anchovy paste--and instead of currants, I used dried tart cherries--the results were delectable.

I was kind of expecting this dish to have more flavor than it did. I think if I were to do it again, I'd increase the amount of anchovy and see if I couldn't caramelize the onions to give it a richer/deeper flavor. I left out the breadcrumbs, but only because I didn't have any acceptable bread around to use... and substituted half raisins & half dried cranberries (chopped) for the currants. Perhaps the vegetable-to-pasta ratio needed to be higher for me.

Excellent flavors. The anchovies, currants and fennel are a great pairing. Raisins wouldn't have been nearly as good. I didn't have Pine nuts, so I used walnuts which were fine. I also used a sprinkle of commercial bread crumbs and forgot the saffron and it was still very tasty. Can't wait to try it with the saffron though.

Yummy! It's a keeper. I too second guessed the bread crumbs but they end up "melting" right in. If you aren't happy with what the bread crumbs do to the dish try grinding them up to make them finer.

Didn't enjoy this. The flavors were fine - but they were all overwhelmed by the bread crumbs, which just made the whole dish bready and oddly textured. If I made this again, I would leave out the breadcrumbs and just toss with the oil.

Easy and so delicious! I used raisins instead of currants, two high quality plum tomatoes from a can, and anchovy paste instead of the anchovy fillets. Using the paste made the process even a bit faster. I followed the prior reviewer's advice on the bread crumbs and toasted them with a little oil, a chopped clove of garlic, and some chopped fresh parsley. This was a step well worth it, but I still think this dish would be great with plain bread crumbs. I would stick with the original currants if you can--raisins were a tad sweet.

A surprisingly delicious way to incorporate fennel into a pasta dish. I omitted the anchovies and it was very good. I cooked this dish for only two people but kept the sauce ingredient quantities as per the recipe and halved the pasta quantity. I am glad I did as I thought it needed all the vegetables.

not bad...but not as good as a variation in Gourmet sometime in the 1990s...many of the same ingredients, but the preparation was with all uncooked ingredients,if memory serves. If anyone has it...please--I'd love to have that recipe.

I thought this was very good but not "delicious" as in 3 forks. The currants, breadcrumbs, pine nuts and fennel really brought the flavors together.

I really enjoyed this - I've made several versions of it at various times and really enjoy it. One note, however: don't substitute. If you can't get fennel, or currants, or some other ingredient - simply do not make the recipe. A recipe isn't just a bunch of ingredients tossed together; it's a very specific combination of flavors and aromas that have a very specific and designed impact. Substitution is like using tom-toms for the 1812 overture instead of kettledrums. Show the food the respect it deserves by not substituting random other ingredients.

I've made this dish a few times--find myself craving it. I omit the tomatoes and saffron and used golden raisins instead of currants--really tasty and different.

Great traditional recipe. I like sardines and achovies so, no problem. I would substitute either fish and maybe add another plum tomato or two. This recipe easily lets you play with the flavors without messing it up. Easy to make and tasted great cold later that night.

This was indeed quite simple to make and was good. I made it as directed (no subs for a change) but could see that substitutions could easily be made. However, for some reason, and I'm putting this down to personal preference, I was not super excited about the dish and most likely won't make it again. I'll keep it in my recipe box though because I want to stress, it was good but perhaps I just wasn't "in the mood".

What a great, unique recipe. And so easy too. Will definitely be making again.

I used raisins instead of currants, pan-toasted dry breadcrumbs, and linguine. This is a terrific pasta dish! Very tasty and the saffron adds that appetizing golden color too. I've only prepared fennel a few times and this dish really shows how well it can be combined with different flavors and brings to perfection its own flavor as well as everything else going on in there. I hope leftovers are even better. Next time I might save the breadcrumbs separately if I plan to have leftovers.

This was great. Wish I'd seen JohnF1's comments b4 I made it, cuz his breadcrumbs sound like a great touch. cmharper, I'm sorry, but how can you substitute bland zucchini for anise-y fennel? It might have tasted ok, but it wasn't remotely this recipe.

Would use traditional Sicilian flavored pan-toasted breadcrumbs of dry breadcrumbs, minced parsley, garlic and parmagiano. Great sprinkled on many pasta dishes. Can also reserve and mince tops of the fennel and sprinkle on top for garnish. Best pasta is a thick long macaroni tube called perciatelli.

I made this recipe with zucchini instead of fennel (since fennel's hard to find around here), and increased the number of anchovies because I love them. It was delightful! Very unusual and a great mixture of sweet, salty and a little bit of heat.

Easy & Flaverful! My guests were pleased and wanted the recipe.
