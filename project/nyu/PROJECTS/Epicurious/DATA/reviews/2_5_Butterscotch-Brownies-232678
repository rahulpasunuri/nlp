*Good base recipe for Blondies, but requires more* I agree that as is, the recipe is lackluster, but I added 1/3C Butterscotch Chips, 1/3C Semi-Sweet Chips, and 1/3C Milk Chocolate Chips and received rave reviews! It is very important that you let these blondies cool completely to set, otherwise they will not cut clean, and fall apart. I lined my pan with Parchment Lining Paper, which made pulling the bars out easier to cool on a wire rack. PROS: Crazy-easy and fast, you probably have everything you need already sitting in your pantry CONS: Requires baking chips, nuts, etc, to add flavor/dimension. Allow time to completely cool. If you rush to cut/serve, you'll get ugly, crumbly bars.

I love these. They are dense and chewy and full of buttery brown sugar flavor.

Uch. Flavor, bland. Texture- dense and crumbly. The kids can help you make it, let's put it that way, and that's the only compliment I can find. I added butterscotch chips, and even those didn't help the flavor b/c that's all that made it taste better.

for denser brownies skip the milk

Not the best blondies I've had, but it did appease my craving for them. These were good as they were not too sweet, but had a fluffier consistency than I like for brownies. I'll use this recipe until I can find a better replacement.

Super Easy and Yummy! I added chopped pecans, butterscotch chips and chocolate chips.
