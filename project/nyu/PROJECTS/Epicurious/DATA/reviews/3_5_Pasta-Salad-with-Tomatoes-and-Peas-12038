REALLY LOVED this salad. Followed reviewers' suggestions and added feta cheese but it was just as delicious without. Used frozen peas but only cooked them half the time recommended on the package and they were perfect. Will make again for sure.

I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I substituted balsamic, as another cook suggested. I added chunks of mozzarella cheese. Even my 6 year old liked it.

Happen to have loads of yellow pear tomatoes overwhelming my garden. Definitely cut down on olive oil, use balsamic vinegar, skip the peas. I added thinly sliced spring onions, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, and cilantro. Delish!

Great way to use fresh tomatoes from the garden. This is a nice change from a mayo based pasta salad. Light and tasty. I used some minced garlic I had in some evoo, and some roasted garlic. Used frozen peas thawed, I agree they don't need to be cooked. Add fresh tomatoes and basil. I added about 3/4 of a cup of basil. So good so fresh. Great summer salad.

Great salad for a summer lunch or barbecue. I quadrupled (yes it's alot of salad) for a big anniversary dinner. I used farfelle (a favorite) rather than shells and I defrosted frozen baby peas at room temperature- -they don't need to be cooked--it keeps the peas at the right consistency. Also, based on other suggestions, I folded in freshly crumbled feta just before serving.

This is my favorite recipe. I made it last week for a party but decided to try something different. Instead of the the vinegar, water, sugar and the fresh herbs, I added Strawberry Balsamic Dressing and it was great. I also added salami and mozzarela. This will now be my recipe, year after year.

Absolutely love this recipe! Made this for a bunch of friends and they repeatedly ask for it. I also added in cucumber, kalamata olives, and feta cheese. The fresh basil is really delicious!

Made exactly as printed. Enjoyed very much. Will try changing it up a bit, adding chicken, red peppers, maybe some cucumber and feta as suggested by other reviewers.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I use white balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar. I've made it with garlic powder when I didn't have any garlic cloves on hand. Tasted just fine! It does taste much better with fresh basil rather than dried but dried is good too. I think it taste the best with a sweeter type of tomatoe. Highly recommend this recipe!

This dish is wonderful and light; it's perfect for a summer event. I brought it to an outdoor concert and paired it with the Artichoke, Fresh Mozzarella, and Salami Sandwiches. So fabulous and perfect together. Since I had extra fresh mozzarella left over from the sandwiches, I threw some in the salad. I highly recommend this over some mayonnaise-based pasta salad.

I have made this salad at least a dozen times and it's a winner every time. Here's how I kick it up a bit. Add some crunch by seeding and cutting up a whole cucumber & 1/2 chopped sweet onion. I also add some kalamata olives and finish by sprinkling the top with crumbled feta cheese. Don't change a thing in the dressing. It's perfect!

I've made this many times in the summer, with fresh basil and tarragon from my herb garden. I like to choose interesting pasta--small-sized. Guests love it! If you're lucky enough to have any leftover, it is good for lunch the next day!

I received a request for this salad for a 4th of July party. The hosts remembered this salad from a previous party a few years ago. The basil always turns brown so in attempt at combatting this phenomenon, I am going to blend the ingredients for the dressing and the herbs in a small mixer (kind of like a pesto sauce). I am curious on the outcome - will know later on today the results.

Took the advice of other reviewers and added fresh mozzarella. Substituted yellow and orange sweet peppers for the tomatoes, used white balsamic vinegar and added extra garlic. A crowd-pleasing summer salad.

As other reviewers noted, this is a nice and light salad. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it a bit plain.

This salad was excellent though my modified version only resembles the recipe. First, I used edamame instead of peas. I left out the tomatoes by mistake but I didn't miss them. I added cubed cooked mushrooms in garlic and oil. I used about double the amount of fresh tarragon. Finally, I halved the oil and added balsamic vinegar and rice wine vinegar. The result was fantastic.

Added extra garlic and tarragon into the dressing. Also added some sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives and artichoke hearts. I'm not usually a fan of pasta salads because of their lack of flavor but this one was great with a few changes.

Great dressing and nice light pasta salad. I added Parmesan cheese and some extra basil. It was a hit at our BBQ.

The dressing in this recipe is really nice. Very simple and clean tasting, without being bland. It's also a super duper fast recipe. But as some have noted, the salad does need just a little more variation. We added sauteed asparagus and a small amount of perlini, and it was great that way, and still extremely quick.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful, light salad. I concur, the extra oil is unecessary. I had a bunch of veggies in my freezer, so I added blanched asparagus spears, artichoke hearts, broccoli, parmesan cheese, cracked pepper, and mozzarella cubes. It was worth the extra effort!

This was a solid pasta salad, but it could definitely use a wider variety of add ins. Next time I might add sun dried tomatoes, peppers, etc.

Have made this dish many times and it continues to be a favorite in our house....and a favorite of those with whom I've shared the recipe. The only change I've made is substituting white balsamic vinegar. Another note, if you don't have green peas use a can of drained, washed (to remove salt) chick peas. Great dish!

Best pasta salad I've ever made/had. Light and fresh tasting yet very flavorful. I even ate it for breakfast!

As everyone else said, this is a nice light dressing. I did make a few changes of my own though... used tri-color shells, added a little over a cup of corn and a can of chickpeas. Also cut back the oil, added some seasoned rice vinegar and left out the garlic (my family hates raw garlic). Brought it to a family picnic - it was a hit... we had way too much food and it was one of 4 similar salads but wound up with the least left and several requests for the recipe.

The dressing in this salad is "the bomb"! I'll use it for other dishes. Only changes I made were to add more garlic (of course) and pearle mozzarella that I just happened to see in our little store. Served this salad at a Father's Day party at the beach - held up very well. Lite and fresh but absolutely delicious.

I am going to make this pasta for a baby shower and thought I should give it a practice run. I am very pleased with it. I followed the directions and I also add so parmesan cheese like others before me. What a delicious dish.

The dressing for this salad is simply exquisite. Couldn't find yellow grape tomatoes so I went with a pint of red grapes and a pint of red cherries, which I broiled with some oil and fresh thyme. I also grated a little parmesan over the whole. Just delicious, and perfect for a buffet meal.

I loved the dressing on this pasta salad! I made as written, the night before, except added the basil at the very end. I bought mozzarella cheese to add in, but in the end, thought it was perfect the way it was. Will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe as written many times since it appeared in the mag. and have enjoyed it. Last night I used what I had at home and it still came out very good using chickpeas instead of green peas, included about 2 Tbs. of balsamic vinegar, and 2 cloves of garlic. Lots of fresh herbs are a must.

This salad is lovely and simple. I simply thawed petite peas instead of cooking them. I ate some of the salad right after I made it and thought it was wonderful. Later in the day, I found that the peas had lost their bright green color. So next time, I will add the peas at the last minute. Didn't have fresh basil, and I'm sure it would taste even better, but dry is fine in a pinch. Made the dressing as written, and it was perfectly balanced...not too tangy, not too sweet, not too oily.

I thought this salad was very good. I did not give it a four because I needed to make a few changes, but other than the changes it would of been a four. I did make a change as suggested by another viewer, I added 1 tspn of sugar and decreased the oil down to 1/3 cup. I loved the tarragon in this salad, it added another layer of flavor, but was subtle. I did only add one clove of garlic to my second batch as 2(as recommended by another viewer) I found left a bitter after taste. I also added some fresh parmesean cheese, just a bit, it was perfect!! Yum Yum Yum!!!!

The first time I made this recipe was for a small wedding at my home as a side dish to CHICKEN DIVAN - it was a hugh hit. It is one of my favorite side dishes. Have made it several times - even forgot the olive oil recently - although a little dry it was still good. Of course - fresh herbs is a must.

I've now made this a number of times and everyone loves it! It is very refreshing and light. Use 1 tbs sugar instead of 1/2 stp as the recipe indicates. Definitely worth saving to the recipe box!

Great pasta salad - I reduced the oil and increased the garlic and fresh basil. Even better the next day.

Rating: 4
This is very tasty. I highly recommend making it for any picnic or just for lunch. It does make a lot of salad, and if you are going to make it the day before, hold out the basil until the last minute and don't dress it until about an hour before serving. I took it to a bbq and everyone was going back for seconds.

I really really liked this dish, but my husband didn't. He said it was "so-so", although he mentioned that he liked the peas. I suspect he didn't like the tarragon flavor. I used dried tarragon and basil instead of fresh, used 2 garlic cloves and only 1/3 cup olive oil.

Way too much vinegar for my taste and that's after I reduced it substantially. I added more garlic and tarragon. Nothing spectacular abou this pasta salad. Just sampled it after making but will probably taste better later once the flavors have a chance to develop. Easy though.

What a great pasta dish- either warm or cold! Not only is it easy to make, but the vinegar adds great flavoring. I added three cloves of garlic instead and it was wonderful.

I actually first made this last year using less olive oil and slightly more vinegar (because I like the tang). It was devoured in minutes and a friend of mine who generally hates pasta salad still talks about how much he loved this one. I added green and red bell peppers, olives, and feta. It was marvelous!
