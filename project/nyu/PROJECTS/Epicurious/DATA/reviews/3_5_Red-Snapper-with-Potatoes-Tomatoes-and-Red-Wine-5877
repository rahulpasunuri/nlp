Helpful general recipe. We omitted the red wine - didn't seem to go with snapper. Used vegetable broth and a larger can of diced tomatoes; also added some fresh grated ginger and some mushrooms to the last 5 minutes that it all cooked. It was like a lovely bouillioubaise. We poached the snapper in broth with a little olive oil and also we used small red tomatoes, sliced to 1/4 inch. Delicious. Made 4 hearty portions.

I read a lot of the reviews and found that some loved this recipe and others didn't. I had all of the ingredients and decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly and found the end result to be a boring, bland mess and I regretted wasting red snapper on this dish. There are virtually no interesting flavors in the dish. It just didn't come together and tasted like I just threw in whatever I had on hand. The potatoes seemed too heavy for the fish and the sauce just a boring canned tomato sauce. Yuck!

We enjoyed this dish very much. I thought the mauve-hued potatoes looked lovely contrasted against the white and browned fish. I followed the recipe for the most part, except that I cut quantities to make 2 servings and used fresh, quartered cherry tomatoes in place of a partial can of diced tomatoes. I probably used more kalamata olives too, because I love them. I had no problem with the potatoes overcooking, and I wonder if the folks who did used the wrong type of potatoes and/or covered the pan...

The canned tomatoes were overpowering. I would've loved to taste the onions and garlic with the wine more. I didn't have a problem with the potatoes not cooking through like other reviews mentioned. I will try this recipe again, but definitely omit the canned tomatoes.

Excellent recipe!! Skipped potatoes altogether. Also added a few chopped capers and substituted vegetable stock for chicken stock. Wonderful topping for fish. Broiled fish in olive oil and lemon skin side up in cast iron skillet.

Has potential-potatoes very tasty and a great way to cook fish, but ugly purple color so not-appealing...To fix that next time I will either use white wine, less red wine and/or more tomato. More tomato probably is good idea as recipe insinuates that you will have separate sauce and potatoes-you won't. There is not enough liquid to call it a separate "sauce". Olives essential and delicious. Love the "reviewers" who essentially make a completely different recipe after changing virtually everything!

Substituted artichoke bottoms for potatoes, and put them in the wine sauce with about 6 minutes left before finishing, and they came out great. I also added about a cup of some lightly chopped mushrooms to help absorb liquid. Because the olives go into the red wine for 12 minutes, they end up tasting the same as the mushrooms because they absorb the liquid. Need to either add olives right near the end of cooking and/or also add some capers during the last 3-4 minutes of cooking to compliment the desired result. A bit of crushed red pepper couldn't hurt to give it an extra kick! I loved it, and would make it again with the changes.

Great dish. Simple and savory. The olives added a lot. I'm adding this to my personal list of weekday dinners.

While I enjoyed the recipe, I agree with other reviewers that the potato's become too soggy. However, in terms of flavor, this dish cannot be beat. I am preparing this recipe tonight, and will adjust this time and subsitute eggplant for the potato. I believe the eggplant to be a better compliment to the stew like consistency and mediteranian vibe of the ingredients in the sauce.

It's a thick purple mash; yuk! The presentation was so bad it didn't matter that it tasted all right, if not a bit uninteresting/forgetable.

As I have a picky husband, I marinated the Snapper for several hours omitting the olives as well, then in preparation I sauteed small red onions, (as an accompaniment) followed by the Red Snapper. The meal included golden potatoes, and almond asparagus. I served it with Pinot Grigio. It was fabulous.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and we loved it. I can't say it was the most visually attractive fish dish I'd made..due to the potatoes cooked in red wine; but the flavors worked great together. I made the sauce ahead of time and warmed it up before serving. we will have it again

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I used dill instead of parsely, and capers instead of olives. I prepared the potato-tomato mixture (with a little added sugar to taste) earlier in the day. Then later I dipped the snapper in an egg mixture (egg and Italian dressing) and coated the filets with flour before sauteing them. We thought it was delicious.

This dish had too much going on. In theory it sounded good, but once it was on the plate, it just tasted like too many ingredients on top of each other instead of a blending of flavors. I wouldn't waste my time making this again.

Took the suggestions of others, added capers, cooked the fish in the broth instead of panfrying etc. Tasted OK but we agreed with the "ugly purple mush" assessment from previous reviews and would not make again. There are so many better red snapper recipes on the site!

This was a yummy, easy dish to make. The colors did all blend into a grey-brown hue, but it was still a fun presentation. Definately don't steam potatoes beforehand! We'll be adding this recipe to our heavy rotation.

Flavorful and delicious. WHITE wine and capers a must. (Thank you previous reviewers - I can just imagine the bed of purple goo. )Skipped the steaming; simmered the potatoes in sauce for 20 minutes. Used tilapia fillets, floured, seasoned, and pan fried in butter/olive oil. The crisp fish atop the saucey potato medely was superb.

It's more like a two and a half forks but I gave it a three instead of a two because it's easy to make and has good flavor. I didn't have any parsley which would have made it better. The ingredient proportions seemed a bit out of whack for me... too much red wine and that was reducing it to half a cup... It took about 10 mins. longer to cook in order to reduce the sauce to a good consistency and soften the potatoes (baby reds). Quite quick and easy. Crumbled feta on top would be a nice finishing touch.

This was a great recipe. Very filling and little cleanup. I didn't steam the potatoes as suggested but I had to let the dish cook for more than 20 minutes and even then a few slices were undercooked. Now I know to let the sauce cook longer before starting the fish. I will be making this again though.

I made this dish mindful of those reviews that had gone before, and I was not disappointed. I did not steam the potatoes, I dredged the fish in flour and fried them. I found pitted Kalamati olives at the store and added capers and oregano on the finished plates. I could not believe how flavorful this was. I am not a big Kalamati olive fan but they tasted so good warm. There were no leftovers.

I made this tonight and loved it, although I did follow some of the previous raters' suggestions, such as not steaming the potatoes, adding capers and extra oregano. I used an Australian Shiraz (Miranda High Country, 1999) and it was great. Also I cooked the fish IN the sauce which definitely added to the flavor thoughout. But I will be interested to try this with chicken as suggested. Five stars, definitely.

This is very good and has become a stand-by in our house. Tilapia is good, as are halibut fillets. I add more oregano and lay fresh sprigs of oregano over the top. I also use a little more pepper and "top-up" the wine.

My husband always said he doesn't really care for snapper BUT I think we found a keeper. The sauce is really so very tasty. I didn't steam the potatoes (I used baby reds) but wish I had for at least 5 minutes. The only thing I added was some capers (we luv capers). I will make this again.

This recipe is great with a few changes. First, don't bother to steam the potatoes, they will be too soft. I prefer to use a can of whole tomatoes that I crush with my hand. Also,I tried this recipe with chicken (boneless,skinless breasts) and liked it even better. Dredge the breasts in flour, salt, and pepper, brown them in a little olive oil, transfer to a baking dish, cover with the potatos, tomatoes, etc. and bake, covered, @375 for about 35 minutes.

I made some changes to this recipe by mistake (I should learn not to talk on the phone while cooking,...completely breaks my concentration!) But actually what I did really improved the dish. I skipped the step of letting the wine boil "until almost no liquid remains". I added the wine (cabernet), stock, and tomatoes at the same time. I steamed the potatoes like the recipe said but I found them to be too soft, so I threw them out and sliced fresh potatoes and just added them in with the wine mixture and let them cook in the sauce for about 15 minutes. The potatoes absorbed so much flavor that way. My husband really enjoyed this. We were glad to find a fish that it was okay to serve red wine with.

Yummy! I wish I had had a loaf of french bread to soak up the delicious sauce! After reading some of the posts, I decided to use white wine instead of the red and it was fine (my potatoes stayed golden).

i really enjoyed this recipe. the sauce is wonderful and would be a great sauce for other types of fish as well. the potatoes were just right. although i did take heed from the previous reviews and i added about 12 garlic cloves. DELICIOUS!

Well, the olives in the sauce are fabulous! The potatoes need something - maybe a little vinegar or maybe fresh oregano? Perhaps a little hot sauce? I would make this recipe again but I would try adding something for that extra flavor I thought it was lacking. The recipe was fairly simple to put together and it looks nice on the plate. We had it with garlic bread to soak up the extra sauce.

This dish was very good. I would like to try substituting a dry white wine for the red wine. I didn't particularly like the way the pinot noir colored the dish purple! But the taste was wonderful...my husband is still raving.

This is a delicious meal and is great for those who aren't sure they like to eat fish. You'll be sure to be asking for seconds.
