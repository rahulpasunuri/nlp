Tried this one twice so far... I learn something new each time. Risotto, I'm starting to understand, is an art. This is a funny recipe - it's so promising but not quite perfect... as evidenced by all the modifications in the comments. Here's one tip: you need a good saucepan that'll heat evenly, preferably with a rounded bottom. & prepare to do nothing but stir rice for 18 minutes. It really requires a lot of attentiveness to get good absorption and the right texture. Beyond that, play with herbs & you may just find a perfect risotto.

I quite enjoyed this recipe as it is written, with the addition of extra herbs and garlic. I might try it again with scallops instead of, or in addition to, the squid.

I follow some of the recomendations of Chefboyani. I added prosciutto, doble oregano and triple garlic. I didn't have fish stock, so i used chicken. It lacked of a little bit of fish flavor. Anyway it was a very nice dish. Recommended.

Fishy flavor overran the entire recipe. Wouldn't make again.

Very tasty! I too altered the recipe - used more garlic and added some onions before the rice. I also used dried oregano and rosemary, which worked just as well. A good fish stock does a lot for this dish.

I have been tempted to make this recipe numerous times over the past couple of years. Each time I decided not to as the recipe did not seem to have enough in it to make it a memorable meal. None the less, I kept coming back to it, and despite my policy of not changing a recipe before I make it as the original chef intended, I have changed this recipe and added it to my most favorite meal category. My changes are as follows, add 1/2 to 3/4 of diced imported Italian prosciutto to the rice in the pan before you add the wine. Double the fresh oregano and the rosemary and triple the garlic. Move the red pepper from a pinch to a teaspoon. (I might add a diced habenero pepper next time.) Replace the parsley with a cup of radicchio. I also poured the broth from the squid directly into the rice after the wine was absorbed. I knew I would have extra broth and did not want to miss any of the squid drippings. I also used a fresh fish broth and used the 12 inch frying pan to keep it warm and to also absorb the leftover flavor of garlic and herbs from the cooking of the squid. DO NOT COOK THE RICE FOR MORE THAN 18 MINUTES TOTAL!!! What a delicious dish. I should have had a loaf of Italian hard crusted bread and will next time.

it was really just OK. we were a little disappointed. if i did make again i would cut back on the parsley or leave it out. it over- powered the flavor of the dish.

Nice balanced flavors; a pleasing change of pace from fried calamari for risotto lovers. I only had 1/2 lb. squid, and it was fine even without the parsley (I had good fish stock). I skipped the rosemary too, which can be overwhelming in a somewhat delicate dish as this is. The lemon is a must. I always cook risotto for 25 minutes, and added some finely chopped onion before sauteeing the garlic and adding the rice.

I have made this so often, with variations depending on what I have to hand. Usually just use fresh rosemary and chopped chilli for flavouring. I always use chicken stock and it is just as good as fish or clam (and a lot cheaper!) I usually throw in some frozen peas and sometimes some mushrooms and perhaps chopped chorizo. I always serve this with garlic mayo (half mayo half plain yogurt which I like to think is more healthy!)

Nice range of flavours and besides i love risotto

Absolutely delicious and elegant, though somewhat time consuming. Good for entertaining--however, I don't think making ahead would produce the same tender texture of the squid balanced with the creamy smoothness of the risotto. Next time, I will double the oregano and take the time for fish stock instead of clam juice.
