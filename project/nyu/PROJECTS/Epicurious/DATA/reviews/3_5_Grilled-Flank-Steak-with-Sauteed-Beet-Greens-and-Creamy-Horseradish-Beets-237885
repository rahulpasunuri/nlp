I needed a beet recipe since we had so many from our CSA that we were bored. I really liked the sweetness of the beets with the spice of the horseradish and creaminess of the creme fraiche. I found that minimal creme fraiche really worked best - for taste.

I can only describe these creamy horseradish beets as disgusting both looking and tasting. They had an almost ammonia like flavor & smell and the pink resulting dressing was unappealing to look at, my husband agreed. It was almost a waste of beautiful beets from the farmers market until we rinsed them off, and I used them in another recipe for beets on this site to reuse them. I recommend the following beet recipe: 'Pickled Beets Gourmet December 2000'. It's my go to recipe, my dearly departed father in law who was a Czech immigrant loved them, and beets are a favorite in his region of the world. I only made the beet portion of this recipe & did not make the steak so I can't vouch for weather the steak portion of this recipe is any good or not.

As others suggested, the steak needs to marinate longer - hardly any taste of the mustard sauce. I'll add more garlic next time as well as well. I love beets - and these were very good. I used Marscapone in lieu of Creme Fraiche though as my market was out. Worked just fine. The beet greens cooked up fine - albeit very very bland. I'll add some "stuff" to it next time. But it really does cook down to very little. In fact 8 tops only served 2 of us.

Very tasty. The marinades for both the steak and the beets were very simple to throw together from ingredients I had on hand. I think the longer you let the steak marinate, the better. Definitely longer than the 2 hours suggested in the recipe. I didn't have the beet greens but served with pasta salad on the side and it was a big hit. Will make again for sure.

I agree with the cook from WA. Normally beets have a nice deep flavor which people love or hate. The sauce in this recipe changed that. It lifted the beets out of their depth and set them kind of level, if that makes any sense. They lost that beet flavor and were just pleasantly interesting but not beet like. That being said, the greens, the beets and the meat in this recipe were delicious.

I guess if you don't like beets, this is good. I like horseradish, but it obliterated the sweetness of the beets. I had hamburger out so I coated them in the flank steak marinade, then bread crumbs and fried them. They were the best part of the meal.

The horseradish adds a wonderful 'zing' to the beets. Great flavor. Sauteed beet greens in little olive oil and garlic. At the end of cooking added some raisins, squeeze of lemon juice and salt & pepper. Served with grilled rib eye steaks and nice bottle of red wine. Great meal.

Great recipe...you'll need to season with salt, obviously. I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. Very easy to prepare. The beats can be prepared with any number of recipes as suggested in other reviews

Beets! The beets were amazing! I did not make the flank steak part of this recipe, just the beets, and it was a huge success. I'm making it tonight to accompany roasted salmon.

Excellent. Actually, the flank steak recipie and the beet recipie could stand well on their own with other dishes. In fact, the beet recipie with its horseradish sauce would go very well with prime rib. I added more garlic to the meat marinade, and added the remainder of the juice in the lemon over the greens when they were finished.

The combination of flavors for this is excellent. The beets took longer to roast for me than indicated and the steak took less so don't take the timing at face value. They aren't kidding when they say greens from 8 and use only 4 beets. If you aren't sure what to do with the leftover beets there is an excellent beet risotto recipe on this site.

I did the beets with a grilled steak and served chilled. It was awesome. My wife isn't a beet fan but enjoyed them.
