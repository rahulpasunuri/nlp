I just made this to go with the Guinness Goodness recipe also on this site. I used it between the pudding and whipped cream layers of that recipe. This Anglaise is so good, easy to make too. I think it would outstanding an outstanding addition to many other desserts and would make a great sauce for simple sliced fresh bananas. Yum!

Very good! We had it over fruit- strawberries, pineapple, melon- and the combo makes your tongue tingle...kinda weird! If you keep away from the fruit, it's very good!!

On its own this barely gets two forks, but if you serve it with something chocolaty; then it tastes like malteasers candy. Or if you have an icecream maker, turn it into ice cream and serve with some chocolate sauce, and it's excellent.
