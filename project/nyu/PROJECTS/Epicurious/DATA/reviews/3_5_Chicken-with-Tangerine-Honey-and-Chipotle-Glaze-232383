It sounded like such a great recipe, especially since we have 4 tangerine trees; however, I have never eaten adobo sauce with chipotle chiles....Fortunately I tasted the sauce before I added it to the glaze. The brand I bought was La Morena, and I merely added 1 tsp of the sauce, no chile. It still is extremely hot for our palette. I will look for other recipes in order to use my wonderful tangerines!

I did this with an entire 8 lb. roaster, then grill roasted it (roaster pan lined with foil on a gas grill). As Adreienne suggested, I only needed about 2-1/2 hrs. marinate. Between that and basting with the glaze frequently, this came out great.

I already reviewed this earlier but wanted to mention if you over marinate your chicken it will be mushy. White meat probably 2-3 hours, dark meat 3-4 hours. I just love, love, love this for a bbq and if you don't want to marinate it add some of the ginger, cilantro and thyme to the sauce. Also you need a very good quality chipotle in adobo sauce (which goes for any recipe). If flour is one of the ingredients you might want to pass

cant give any forks yet because I havent made the recipe yet. I make a nearly identical marinade with lemons instead of oranges and have found that buzzing all the ingredients in a blender gives great results.

Expected the chicken itself to have more flavor, didn't get past the sauce. Can't recommend, especially since tracking down tangerines and tangerine juice was a trial in itself. Payoff just not there.

I really loved the sauce, except that everyone in my house felt that the zest was overwhelming; I might cut it down to 1 Tbs. next time. Otherwise, the sauce had a lovely combination of flavors. Sauce would seem to go well with anything from pork to scallops.

I used orange juice, not tangerine, but I found the citrus way too powerful (despite the fact that I used extra chipotle). I would cut the zest to 2 teaspoons and up the chipotle to 1 tablespoon. I'm willing to try it again, with modifications.

I prepared the glaze and used it on grilled pork tenderloins. It turned out great. The smoky sweet flavors were great with the grilled pork, and not too- too spicy.

I agree with previous reviewers, the marinade did not add much flavor to the chicken. I doubled the chipotle's since I like things hot, but still didn't get enough heat. Not worth the work it took to make the only flavor that really came through was the orange.

This is one of my absolute summer favorites. And about the chipotle...I use a whole can!! To each his own.

Excellent! I used orange juice. However a word of caution to those not familar with chipotle you might want to start with less and add until desired heat is reached. Great Summer dish.

I LOVE the glaze! Outstanding flavors. I doubled the recipe since I have a tangerine tree loaded with fruit and need great recipes - this is a keeper. In order to speed the reduction process I used a large frying pan - increasing the surface area speeds up evaporation - I reduced by half As the glaze cooled it got thicker. Then, since I wanted the glaze even thicker, I took half the reduction (as an experiment) and added a slurry of corn starch and water, brought it to a boil. Thickens beautifully.

Used orange juice instead - I agree with the other reviewers that the chicken is nothing special but the sauce is out of this world. Great as a dipping sauce for chicken fingers. I also use it as a glaze for pork roast and pour additional sauce over the sliced pork. The sauce gets 4 forks.

Delicious, I used chicken thighs - they were in the freezer. The glaze took closer to 40 min. to reduce and boiled up and over easily. Need to watch it! I will also add a smidge more chipotle chile - I thought it could use more chipotle flavor. Loved the other cooks suggestions of skewered chicken breasts strips and on the carrots! Definately make it again-yummy!

I made a variation of this with chicken wings for a party of about 40. They are bone sucking good!!!

The chicken was good, but not great. i didn't think that the marinade added much and the glaze took forever to reduce. but it was tasty! Definitely not ideal for weeknight cooking. I prefer the honey and chili recipe on this site

Love, love, love this! We used boneless, skinless chicken breasts as that's what was on hand, and it was fabulous. Every person in my family, even my toddler, gobbled this chicken up. I will be making this often!

This turned out wonderfully. Even my grandmother loved it and she's picky and barely eats! I couldn't believe she had seconds.

Really great. We did boneless skinless breasts and broiled in the oven because of weather, so we imagine it would be even better with skin on and grilled. Sauce took longer to reduce than instructions indicated, but I always expect that. Both the wife and I loved it and would make it again for sure!

I have made this recipe for my family and a gaggle of grilfriends to RAVE reviews! If you are pressed for time use Odwalla for the juice. The glaze makes this dish although my son, 13 - and not too hot for chipotle, likes the chicken straight from the grill :)

The glaze makes this dish. We made with boneless skinless breasts - the marinade was so-so. but the glaze was fabulous. Only had dried chipotles without adobo sauce so I soak one chili in hot water for several minutes, removed seeds, chopped, and put in glaze while reducing. Also added about 2tbl brown sugar. Then strained it before serving. This was also great on our carrots and would love to try on sweet potatoes this Thanksgiving. Make as christmas gifts.....too.

We used boneless skinless chicken breasts. Marinated for 2 days and then grilled them on skewers as a appetizer. We received rave reviews and would definately make again.

I made this recipe for the first time in June - and this will be the third time. I'm surprised by the reviews - we (and all our guests) found it delicious, moist, flavorful. The prep time was worth it!

The marinade took too much time to prepare to only be able to taste one flavor which was the orange. None of the other flavors came through.

Rating: 1
This was a very uneventful dish, and I'm glad I only made it for family and not guests. The marinade didn't add anything to the chicken, even though it soaked for 24 hours. The glaze should've been thicker to adhere better, and I reduced it almost in half! While my family usually loves new taste tests, they said "pass on this one"!

This chicken dish was just okay, nothing special. I also couldn't find tangerine juice, so I used an orange juice blend for the marinade and glaze. For all the time it took to reduce the glaze, I won't try the recipe again.

The glaze was outstanding, but because I doubled the recipe it took quite some time to reduce it. I also used orange juice instead of tangerine and, upon other reviewers suggestions, did not marinate the chicken. I salted and peppered it, tossed it on the grill, then glazed it and drizzled more sauce on before serving. I also used the glaze on grilled eggplant and mushrooms with good results.

I loved the tangerine-chipotle combination! My chicken came out nice & juicy with the combination of marinade & the wonderful sauce. I would caution other cooks to make sure they cut away all excess fat, and watch the chicken carefully -- check the chicken a couple of minutes before the recipe's stated cooking time.

This was a wonderful recipe. Since tangerines were not available, I used juicing oranges. I followed the recipe, the only change I would make would be to make more of the glazing sauce because it was so good for dipping and everyone wanted more on their plate. I used organic chicken breasts on the bone with skin.

The sauce is absolutely amazing, but I wouldn't bother marinating the chicken. Next time we will just grill chicken breasts and dip it in the yummy sauce! Even easier! It got rave reviews all around and we will be making this again. Thanks!
