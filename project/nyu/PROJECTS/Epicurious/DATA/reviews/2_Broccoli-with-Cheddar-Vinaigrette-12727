I found that this a little thick rather than saucy so I doubled the liquids and it was still heavier than I expected. I also added some bacon to it for a little extra oomph. I might make this again and perhaps add a little less cheese to get a saucier vinaigrette texture. It was all right

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special. I doubt I make this again.

I have used this vinaigrette with both cold and warm broccoli. I do double all the ingredients with the exception of the cheddar - and give a "hearty shake of the Tabasco!" We refrigerate the vinaigrette to use again. It's delicious and easy to make. To us, it's "a hell of a lot better" than the Velveeta version. Try it again, Joe.

Initially, I was slightly disappointed at the consistency of the vinaigrette, but once I added it to the broccoli, it was okay. Maybe a tad more water was needed. We REALLY liked it, though. Even my son, who doesn't like broccoli, ate a couple of pieces.

Very easy and simple recipe that we enjoyed a lot. I raised the heat level of the recipe by doubling the tabasco sauce and adding a couple of dried hot peppers to the blender.

This was not very good, but it wasn't absolutely awful. I used good quality white cheddar cheese, but still needed to add more salt, hot pepper sauce, and a dash of sugar for better flavor. I wouldn't bother making this again.

I used to make fun of my mother always smothering her broccoli in a "traditional" cheese sauce (i.e., a warmed-up velveeta and milk mixture), but I thought I would compromise during my Christmas dinner and at least have a cheese sauce on the side if she wanted something to put over my plain old steamed broccoli (my preference). My advice after making this cheddar vinaigrette - IF YOU LIKE CHEESE SAUCE WITH YOUR VEGETABLES, STICK WITH THE VELVEETA!!!

We really didn't care for the vinaigrette.

I've made this several times. It is one of the few recipes I don't "tweak". For me, it's perfect as written.

This wasn't a bad recipe, but my fussy teenagers didn't care for it.
