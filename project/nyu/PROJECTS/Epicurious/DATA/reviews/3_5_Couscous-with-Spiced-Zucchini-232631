Great idea for a side dish or lunch snack served cold. So delicious. Agree that spices should be doubled and I also did without the mint, which is merely personal preference. Also did not add anywhere near as much salt (do not like to cook with too much salt) and feel it made no difference as the spices, onion and garlic add plenty of flavour. My plan is now to cook a big batch on a Sunday evening and that's my lunch sorted for the next few days!

Definitely double the spices! I made chicken soup from scratch and used the extra broth and added leftover chicken. Phenomenal!

As suggested by others I doubled the spices, and omitted the mint. I also added some feta cheese to make it a little more substantial to bring to work for lunch. Very good, I will definitely make it again.

I doubled the spices on this yummy recipe and left out the mint. It is very subtle, despite a rather large quantity of spices. The onions give it a warm sweetness that is really nice. And it is very inexpensive to make with summer squash.

i dislike the flavor of cumin but this was good anyway. it tastes very woodsy and earthy.

This dish was fast & easy to make and really good to eat. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the spices. The result was a very flavorful couscous with just the right amount of spice. I used a mix of mint, parsley and cilantro instead of just mint. I topped it with grilled merguez sausages and served it as a main course.

Loved this dish! I doubled the spices as other reviews suggested and thought the flavors were perfect; however I may use a pinch less chili powder and/or pepper next time as I felt the heat was a bit much. I decided to make this a main dish, so I tossed in some BBQ chicken that was in my fridge. Since already cooked, I added the chicken at the same time as the spices. This was a wonderful meal, and super quick and easy to make. I will definitely be making this again!

Doubled the spices as some of the other reviewers suggested. Also used mint as the recipe states but felt the mint didn't really compliment the other flavors in this dish - next time I'll use a combo of cilantro & parsley. Had some of the leftovers from last night's dinner for lunch today. Served on a bed of fresh baby spinach with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar over all - thought the flavors actually improved overnight. Another keeper!

This is a great way to use zucchini. Followed others' suggestions to double spices. I also added pimenton (both sweet and picante). I skipped the mint b/c I didn't have any on hand. Actually made quinoa instead of couscous (skipped the chicken broth and just used water for the quinoa) for a little protein boost. Oh, and because I had some roma tomatoes on hand that were on their last legs, chopped those up and threw them in along with the spices & cooked for a little bit longer until they got soft. Came out great, and I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Best couscous recipe yet. Nice & spicy. Easy to substitute. Used grated carrot instead of zucchini since it's winter. Cubed squash and sweet potato would work well too. Mr. Meat-n- Taters also liked it, so 'nuff said.

Great! Easy! A nice mix of flavors.

I made this for dinner adding tofu and doubling the spices. Easy and delicious! Will certainly make again.

made this dish this afternoon after realizing i didn't have all the ingredients needed for another couscous dish i was planning. it was AMAZING. the mix of spices was great, kind of spicy, but not *spicy*. the only changes i made were to use baby zucchini and parsley instead of mint. fabuloso.

Made this for a dinner party. It tasted nice, but didn't have too much flavor. I found myself eating most of it in the days after the party.

This dish has an amazing flavor. I served it with fish and everybody loved it!

A very nice couscous dish. I doubled the amount of chili power to make it more spicy, and used cilantro instead of mint. A new favourite for sure.

Delicious side dish--I've made it twice. Great for leftovers the next day.

Goes really well with Sweet and Spicy Shrimp recipe on this site, and a great way to star zucchini in a recipe.

this is a terrific recipe for plain couscous. next time i will add a variety of vegetables - perhaps red pepper and mushrooms.

This recipe was just so-so for me. Maybe that's because I made it as a main dish instead of a side dish. It doesn't really stand out on its own very well.

The spiced zucchini was wonderful and I'll probably make that again without the couscous as a stand alone dish. One note: The recipe calls for plain couscous. They really didn't mean plain (which is the large grain moroccan version) but the smaller grained french couscous. The large grain couscous won't cook properly just by pouring the boiling broth over it while the smaller grain, french style, will.

This has become a favorite - delicious warm with a tagine or harissa chicken. Lends itself to variations and is super quick and easy.

The flavor of this recipe was very nice, but mine was a bit soggy. When I first stirred the veggies into the coucous, it seemed fine, but after setting a few minutes, the couscous seemed to soak up a lot of the water from the zucchini and the whole dish was a tad mushy as a result.

Nicely spiced, very good with smaller zucchini just slightly crisp -- excellent salad overall. Also, easy to make vegetarian (and still tasty) by substituting water for chicken broth. As stated in previous reviews, cilantro or parsley can successfully be subbed for mint. Yummy!

Everyone in my family loved this. I subbed cilantro for the mint because that's what I had. We thought the flavor and mouthfeel (very rounded/full) improved after "resting" and coming to room temperature. I'll try reducing the oil to 1 T next time, as it seemed to have more than it needed -- hopefully it won't lessen the body noticeably.

An awesome salad to bring to work and heat up with something frozen! Perfect warm, cool, or at room temp. I didn't add mint, because it was $3.99 a bundle, but the spices were perfect. Couldn't have been easier to make.

i wasn't in the mood to go to the market so i made this with crook-neck squash and i used red bell pepper instead of onions, also i didn't have any mint. this was still delicious. i don't think i will use onions next time either, the red bell pepper was pretty and tasted good in this dish. i will be making this all the time.

Delicious! I roasted the spiced-up zucchini with onions, and stirred in the mint when cooled. Served over couscous, this makes a great take-to-work lunch that tastes best at room temp. Enjoy!

Very good summer recipe. The mint is a great element which gives the recipe a fresh taste. If you regularly eat Indian or Middle Eastern food, I would suggest adding more spices, because as is, it will taste somewhat bland.

I added portabello mushrooms and ommitted the mint and thought it was quite delicious. Made good leftovers too. A very simple and quick dish, nice for summer.
