I've been making pot roast for 40 years and this is a very good one. Loved the hint of cinnamon. My changes were minor . I am gluten intolerant so I substituted gluten free flour for the matzoh. Worked perfectly. Also deglazed the pan before blending some of the liquid to intensify the flavor.

Well, this was a bit of a disappointment for me. I followed a reviewers suggestions and added some different herbs...the meat was tender but I found the "rich gravy" to be more like vegetable soup...I may have set my sights too high but I'll find another recipe next time.

I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, added some rosemary & a bit of smoked paprika for a deeper note ... and this was really welcome & good on a chilly night. Very savory.

I have made this recipe twice already, for Passover and Rosh Hashanah, and the meat was so flavorful and tender! Not only was it a quick and easy recipe, but my guests loved it!
