Everyone loved this dish! I didn't have tequila so I used vodka. The mango and avocado was great on top and made the recipe very summery...

This is absolutely delicious. The chef ought to take a bow for this one. Used all red peppers and it was just spectacular. The combination of fresh herbs and vegetables with the acid of the lime and the zip of tequila, all enriched with butter, rivals the savoriness of any of the classic sauces from LaRousse, et al. The bright taste of mango and the creamy texture of the avocado are terrific counterpoints and complements both. Followed the cooking instructions to the second and the scallops were done perfectly. We served it with a simple middle eastern couscous done in chicken stock. It was ideal, especially as it absorbed the stock from the sauce. An off-dry blend of chardonnay, muscat and chenin blanc was an outstanding accompaniment. This is a new favorite. We'll do it frequently, especially when we have guests who like seafood.

Awesome recipe! It was a bit of work but I thought the end result was perfect and delicious. Substituted half of the scallops with shrimp for more of a seafood lovers dish...Great!

This recipe was delicious! What a great way to use summers vegetables. The only thing I changed was to use 1 Tbs of butter. Otherwise, followed EVERYTHING. One of the best epicurious recipes I've had by far.

This dish had way too many conflicting flavors. We did like the avocado/mango sauce and would use it again with plain scallops.

I make this very often and the only change I make is that I add jalapeno peppers, about 4 or 5 without the seeds. I want the flavor not the heat. I give this a very high rating and the mango and avocados take it over the top. Thanks for sharing it. Betty Murphy Schenectady N.Y.

Yikes! I thought the sauce was much too tart -- I would cut down the lime juice. I combined the diced avocado and mango with chopped basil and cilantro to make a salsa which is excellent (and is really good with blackened or grilled meats and seafood). Although I love avocados and mangos, I think they are unnecessary on this dish, and add too many ingredients, masking the subtle taste of the scallops. My husband grew up on the east coast, and I love his recipe for Tequila Lime Scallops much better: Melt a little butter and olive oil in pan, sear scallops on high heat until browned, but not cooked through, and remove from pan. Deglaze pan with about 1/4 cup of tequila and ignite to burn off alcohol. Add 1 bottle of clam juice, and juice of 1/2 to 1 lime to taste. Reduce sauce over high heat. Reduce heat to low, temper some heavy cream, and add to sauce with a pinch of cayenne pepper. Add some chopped basil and slivered rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes for color and flavor. Add scallops until just heated through. Do not boil sauce, and do not overcook scallops, or they will get tough. Season to taste with salt/pepper. Serve immediately over linguini. This is delicious!!!

Great presentation and wonderful flavors. The mangos and herbs really make the dish. substituted rum for tequila and reduced the amount of butter. Great dish for special occasions and guests!

This is a great recipe. I used bay scallops which added texture more than flavor. I also used shrimp which were a better match for the substantive flavors of the sauce and other ingredients. I will make this again and try sea scallops next time. This is a wonderful dish for company. It looks beautiful and tastes great. I had leftovers and reheated them the next day which worked well.

Fantastic combination of flavors - don't leave anything out! Soaked my scallops and shrimp in Carla's Citrus Marinade (on this site) for one hour - wanted to eat all of the seafood by itself while finishing up. Doubled the liquid ingredients and reduced to about one cup to intensify the flavors. Time saving suggestion: cut up all of the peppers, toss with olive oil, add the tomatoes, and broil for 4 minutes.

Intended to make this just for the BF and I, but was surprised by both of his parents. Having never cooked for his mom before, I was quite nervous. This recipe was not only delicious, but impressive. I subbed white wine for tequila and couldn't find cilantro anywhere, so I had to do without it. Served over basmati rice.

Very good. Not hard to make. Peeling bell pepers not necessary, and I recomend replacing green peppers with other colors to sweeten the dish. Don't skimp on the mango and avocado.

Fabulous and unusual dish! Made it with only 1 lb. of sea scallops and used drained, roasted, canned red peppers, instead of the fresh. Did deglaze the pan with a bit more tequila before returning the scallops to the pan, and drizzled the plate and suggested rice, (jasmine), with a basil infused olive oil before serving. The entire dish was consummed by two of us, and my husband raved. Without the scallops this would make a lovely vegetarian meal for the vegans in my family. A keeper!

This was a total hit with our guests. We used bay scallops, so it was perfect to serve as a topping on rice. Do not leave anything out...and add the herbs at the very end so they taste fresher and more vibrant. We used white wine instead of tequila since we didn't have any and it was fine. the mango and avocado are musts!! They really round it out.

This recipe was good, with a bevy of different flavors. The presentation is beautiful with the many colors of the dish. However, I found that there was too much of a lime taste to it. Next time, I would add shrimp.

This made a very special dinner. I used garden fresh tomatoes that I peeled, and I did add a little curacao as suggested.

Fabulous entertaining dish ! I especially enjoy presenting this meal on a colourful platter on a bed of Basmati rice. The ripe cool Mango and the scallops are sensational. This meal has wowed many of our guests on a cold winter night at our ski cabin. Thanks!

My husband and I have made this several times(but always with shrimp). It really is fantastic. Next time, we will use scallops. Great flavor.

Terrific! 2nd time made it with scallops, slipper lobster tails, crab claw meat, and tiger prawns. Added 2 diced jalapenos for fun. Ay yay yay! Mas por favor.

This is definitely not comfort food! What a plethora of flavors in one dish. I served it with rice, which was a perfect accompaniment. If you want to have something very unique, this is it! However, I found it a little too tart, so I would reduce the Tequila to 3 tbsp. and add 1 tbsp. of Triple Sec. If you don't have Triple Sec, add honey (to taste) to sweeten it so it's more like a margarita than a shot with lime. To thicken the sauce, add a bit of cornstarch/flour to make the sauce more like a glaze.

The savory and sweet flavors included in this recipe were wonderful together and the combination of hot and room temperature were a good combination. I had never made a recipe that was both hot and cold. My dinner guests raved!
