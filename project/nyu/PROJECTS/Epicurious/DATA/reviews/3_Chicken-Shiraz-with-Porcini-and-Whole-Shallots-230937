I made this a few times and it was quite good, but didn't really care for the strange colour or soupiness. My modifications save time & use less ingredients. Unless you are using dried mushrooms, skip the first step (which calls for soaking and then later chopping the mushrooms). Wouldn't use chicken breasts - they tend to dry out. Thighs and legs are best - the collagen released from slow-cooking the bones is what gives the sauce body. Batch fry chicken until skin is brown, set aside. Used bacon instead of pancetta. Sauteed bacon, shallots, mushrooms (I add 1 chopped carrot) all together for about 10 minutes. Add wine (use only 1 cup of dry WHITE wine)and boil to reduce by half. Add broth. Add chicken (and any drippings) and thyme to the pot, cover, transfer all to oven. Bake for about 45 mins. Remove/set aside chicken. Dont need flour to thicken sauce - can do so by bringing sauce to boil for a few minutes. Tastes heavenly served with fluffy moist mashed potatoes.

A waste of of 2 cups of wine

I have made this several times, and after a few tweakings, my husband and I love it. I would recommend using a cabernet or merlot instead of shiraz. For some reason, the shiraz made the entire dish look purple instead of a deep red/brown. Only add the amt of bacon called for, too much makes it too smoky tasting. And lastly, don't reduce sauce at the end, it dries it out too much.

This dish was ok, not great. For the time it took to make I was expecting more. I think I could have gotten a similar result with a less time consuming recipe very easily, so I will look for another recipe like this.

My family thought it was just okay. The color of the sauce is a brownish purple and not terribly appetizing! Consensus was that no one was anxious to have it again.

I made this dish for my husband, who is a chef and he absolutely raved about it. I made some variations: I didn't use any chicken breasts, but added to the thigh and leg amounts instead. I also never put this in the oven, just let it simmer for 2 hours. I also served over mashed potatoes. It turned out perfectly! I will definitely be making this meal many more times.

I made this using a good quality bacon instead of pancetta. And a mix of bacon drippings, butter and olive oil to brown the chicken, shallots and mushrooms. My dining companion said he liked it. But I was not thrilled. Rustic and earthy are charitable words for it. A little too earthy for me. I would not make it again.

I loved this recipe. I used Morel mushrooms and it was fantastic. The only thing bad about this recipe was that it took forever to make but it was worth it. I think it would be a great sunday night meal when you have more time on your hands.

I used about 12 boneless, skinless chicken breats, as I'm really not a fan of bone-in chicken. This probably cut back the flavor of the dish, but it was still very good. I really didn't think the sauce needed to be reduced, as it was the perfect consistency for me. This was a very flavorful dish, and I really liked it. I served it over gnocchi. There was plenty left over, so I'll reheat it tonight. It will probably be even better after sitting in the fridge overnight.

We lover this and make it twice a month. My partner prefers food without bones so i make this with lots of boneless chicken breasts. We save some for leftovers and to share with friends.

Let me put it this way... My husband ate till he was late for work!!! He also took some of the chicken & sauce to the guy he was relieving. I used Black Opal Shiraz in the sauce and bought an extra bottle to serve with the meal. Very nice.

Rich and savory. I've made this several times. Do NOT substitute onions for shallots, bacon for pancetta, or merlot for shiraz. Tonight I made it with pheasants - 4 forks!!!

This took me so long to make and my husband and I thought it was boring coq au vin. Winey gravy. Shallots overpowered. Don't waste your time!

Extremely tasty. I followd this recipe but used 4 lbs cut up chicken breasts only (bone in) and didn't have any shiraz so used a cabernet, and served it over pasta. The porcini msuhrooms give the dish a great flavor along with the thyme. My family all said this is a definite keeper!

I made this recipe with boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs and substituted a tempranillo for the Shiraz. It turned out really well, especially because of the depth from the pancetta. I was worried about the chicken getting dried out, but it was very tender, getting poached in the oven I guess. I'm not sure if the sauce was supposed to be thicker, but there was a lot of it and I think this would have been great over pasta or noodles.

I would give this 5 forks if I could! No, it's not the fanciest thing on earth, but it's got a wonderful, earthy, rich flavour - the sauce is absolutely amazing. I more or less halved the recipe (used 2 breasts and 4 thighs), skipped the parsley, used high-quality bacon instead of pancetta and substituted a chopped onion for the chopped shallots because I ran out of shallots - and it was still great. Cooking times were perfect. A terrific dish for a cold and snowy winter night.

I made this almost as written, except for: substituted Merlot for the Shiraz; used half button and half cremini mushrooms; made a half recipe; used only bone-in chicken breasts. Not a pretty dish, but tasty. A garnish of parsley really does help the presentation. I served it with egg noodles, but I want to try it with couscous or polenta. Next time I'll try it with bone-in skinless chicken thighs and a Shiraz.

This one got good reviews from my parents. I used regular bacon for pancetta.

WOW!!! This one deserves a much higher rating that it has! It knocked the socks off everyone in our family. My husband kept shaking his head and saying "How do you do this? It's so amazing!" Big hit at our house!!

I think you'll find that the one fork reviewers are the oddballs of the bunch over time. I have made this now five times and each time it's outstanding. The sauce is deep, rich, and particularly flavorful with the pancetta and mushrooms (Trader Joe's carries dried mushrooms that won't break the bank.) I don't quite understand the other reviewers' complaints. Perhaps they were chintzy with quality ingredients. Try this with brisket; it's lovely.

This was really dull. _Way_ too much work for not enough bang. I thought it was just very boring. Don't bother.

Yes, this is a time-consuming recipe, but it's a nice hearty dish for fall. I saw this as a nice update on Chicken Bourginon, and the Shiraz adds a nice flavor. I agree that it's essential to use a good-quality wine for this dish. It's also essential to taste as you go (as any good cook should do) so you can adjust seasonings. Chiccken Shiraz, IMHO, is sophisticated comfort food.

I had a totally different response than that of the first reviewer. I loved this dish as did the rest of my family (including kids age 6, 8, and 10) and the friends we had over for dinner. I thought the ingredients made for a great and special tasting dish. I used a good bottle of Shiraz and probably 1 1/2 oz. porcini mushrooms and a few extra bellas and shallots. But I don't think that made a huge difference. It's a great dish to serve on a fall day and it's a great make ahead for company.

Very disappointing. I made this because it was a cool fall day and I had many of the key ingredients on hand. Any braised single pot meal takes prep-work, so I'm not complaining about the time involved per se. The time involved does not justify the result however. You end up with chicken in a red-wine mushroom sauce that is neither deep nor interesting in flavor. I've made simple pan sauces that are similar that are much better. The chicken is tender this way (but trim skin and fat). It smells great while cooking, but this is just a dressed-up crock pot recipe with fancy ingredients. Do the same recipe in any crockpot with yellow onion, bacon, simple red wine, and button mushrooms, and I think it will taste the same.
