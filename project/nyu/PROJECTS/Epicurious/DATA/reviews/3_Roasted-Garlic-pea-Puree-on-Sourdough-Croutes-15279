I was really excited to make this recipe. I thought it would be different and more interesting than a bruschetta or other dip. I was extremely disappointed though. My guests didn't hate it but I thought it lacked pizazz and just tasted like I put some frozen peas in a food processor and put them on some sourdough.

A great thing to bring to a gathering when you don't know what to bring...it has a wow factor with the bright green color, easy to make ahead and transport.

I tried this at a friend's party, then got the recipe myself. It is fun to make and so delicious. Even people who were wary of it's appearance loved it!!!
