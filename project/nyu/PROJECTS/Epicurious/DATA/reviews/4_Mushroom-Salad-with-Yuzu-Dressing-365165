Delicious! Didnt have the yuzu juice so used the recommended lime/orange mix instead. Very fresh and tasty and my guests loved it. Am looking forward to trying it now with the yuzu juice.

This was amazing! I found yuzu flavoured juice that I used but it wasn't flavourful enough so I also used some yuzu vinegar that I found at my chines grocer. Worked very well. I used half the dressing on the greens to coat all the leaves and then served the rest with the mushrooms. Worked really well and I'll do it like that again

So easy and tasty. I didn't have access to Yuzu, so I used the juices of a lime and orange. Simple, tasty and definitely worth making.

We made this as a first course for a dinner party. Simple and sensational. Will defintely make again. We like garlic so we increased that a bit but were otherwise faithful to the recipe.
