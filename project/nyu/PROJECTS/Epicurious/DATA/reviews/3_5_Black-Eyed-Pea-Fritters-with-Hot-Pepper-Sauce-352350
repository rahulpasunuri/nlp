These fritters are terrific. We usually leave the ground black-eyed peas to ferment for a day or two. This makes the fritters lighter. They come out like African hush puppies. Very nice...

I have fresh BEP in my grocery, they worked great. Used serrano chili instead of red pepper and fried in veg oil - these turned out great. It's Jan 8, and I'm making a second batch to have for snacks this weekend.

I made 6 batches of these along with the accompanying hot sauce for New Year's today and they were terrific. I made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. Do not use canned black- eyed peas - they will definitely have the wrong texture & too much moisture. Use the coconut oil if you can because it does add a nice flavor. To save on oil (because I discovered coconut oil is kind of pricey), I also made the fritters a little flatter and turned them & that worked well. Thanks to a previous reviewer for that tip. I fried 6 batches of these in a cast iron skillet using two 29-oz. jars of coconut oil, skimming the oil for crumbs between fryings and changing the oil out completely after the first 4 batches. They turned out perfectly. I'd recommend making the hot sauce along with them because as great as these fritters were, the sauce got even more compliments. My daughters asked me if this could become my standard New Year's black-eyed peas recipe, so I'll definitely be making them again.

I used canned black eyed peas and added a tiny bit of unsweetened shredded coconut because I didn't have coconut oil and instead used peanut oil for frying. The fritters just didn't stick together at all, it was a very tasty mush. The flavors were excellent, the texture yucky, not sure why my substitutions would have caused this to happen.

So after being a member on Epicurious for about 7 years I am finally compelled to write a review. THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!! The coconut oil makes all the difference. I had it with Harissa but will make the hot sauce next time. I have been vegan for about 4 years and own too many vegan and non-vegan cookbooks. However each time I saw Vegan Soul Kitchen at the book store I was dying to try the recipes but trying to resist adding to my already overstuffed cookbook cabinet. Now that I have tried this recipe I have to have the book. YUMMY!!

We loved this! Had to subsitute olive oil for the coconut oil and jalepenos for the green bell pepper, just cuz that's what I had on hand, but the fritters still turned out brilliantly. I did cheat a little to save oil and make them kinda flat. Will definitely do it again.

This recipe is quick and easy. I was nervous about frying uncooked black-eyed pea batter, but these fritters have great texture: moist and delicious inside and crunchy on the outside! I made my batter the day before and added the peppers and cornmeal the next day. I used roasted peanuts because I couldnt find raw. I also used about 1 cup of coconut oil and the rest canola. The oil bubbles up, so make sure you leave enough room in the pan. The sauce is full of flavor. Just the right blend of sweet and spicy. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

I made this recipe for a Derby party, and it was quite good. I felt the fritters were missing something, perhaps because I didn't have coconut oil and used canola oil instead. Halfway through the process I added chopped jalepenos to the fritter batter, and I liked the fritters with the jalepenos much better. My 16-month-old ate her weight in the fritters minus the hot sauce and jalepenos.
