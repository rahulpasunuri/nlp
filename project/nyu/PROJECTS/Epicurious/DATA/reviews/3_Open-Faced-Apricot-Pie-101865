A really excellent recipe. Of course, much depends on the apricots- they should be ripe, but still reasonably firm, and should hold together during baking. The berries and glaze are nice, but nonessential, touches- they can be omitted, making a really excellent plain apricot pie; also, different kinds of berries should work well- they all combine well with apricot. Makes an exceptionally attractive pie. Apricot halves are hard to measure accurately by volume- I used about 1 3/4 lbs. whole apricots, and could have used a few more- this made two layers in the shell (placing them in face up is important, both for appearance and to keep the crust crisp). I found the instructions for the crust unnecessarily fussy; if you have a method you're confident with, I'd go ahead and use it.

This pie rocked the house when I made several for a client last week. I was looking for a way to use a windfall of apricots and this was perfect. I served with lightly sweetened crème fraiche and we ran out of pie before the chocolate cake was half gone!

This turned out to be a train wreck. Don't waste your fruit. Despite the foil around the rim it burned, as did the tops of the apricots. The pie did not thicken; four tbsp of cornstarch might have taken care of that but I won't try making this again to find out.
