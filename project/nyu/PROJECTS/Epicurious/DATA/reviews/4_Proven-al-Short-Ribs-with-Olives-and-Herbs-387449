Very good dish. Easy and filled with flavor. Love cooking with this cut of meat.

This came out really great. I made it the night before and reheated in the oven before serving. The meat was falling of the bone. My guests were very impressed. I will definitely make this again for a special dinner.

Oh, my. This dish is memorable. It is not at all difficult to make. Browning the meat is the most time-intensive step. And, oh, is the aroma of the oven- roasting meat tempting! If you're concerned about presentation, I suggest you remove the meat from the sauce, as directed, then skim the sauce and simply ladle it over the meat rather than returning the meat to the pot. I have done it both ways and find the meat can be so tender that it falls off the bone if you handle it too much. I serve this over creamy polenta to the pleasure of my family and guests. The kalamatas add a savory complement to the beef and shouldn't be skipped.

This was delicious! It took a while to prepare, but was worth it. One thing I did notice is that it took three days for my family to eat it and the orange zest cause the sauce to become too fruity. So, if you plan on eating it over a couple of days I would add fresh orange zest to your own bowl instead of mixing it.

This recipe was awesome!! After reading the other reviews, I made this recipe for my fiancee and I with the following modifications: I re-hydrated porchini mushrooms for 30 minutes and I added them in with the garlic and herbs. I used the broth from the mushroom re-hydration and added it with the chicken broth for amazing flavor. I also cut back on the balsamic and used only 1/2 cup. I served it over multi-grain medium noodles and it was amazing. We ate leftovers the next day and it was much easier to remove the fat once it had been refrigerated (it comes off like a candy bar) and the flavor was more intense the second day. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is outstanding. I took the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and reduced the vinegar to 1/4 c. I ended up adding another cup of broth but feel there could have even been more liquid if serving over pasta. This was a definite repeat.

I made this last night for a dinner party, it was great to prepare ahead of time so I could get the kitchen cleaned up and even fit in a nap! The house smelled fabulous all afternoon long! I followed the recipe for braising the dish for 3-4 hours. I took the pan out at about 3 hours and noticed the sauce had reduced down to be very thick. I thought this would be a good time to take the meat out and skim off the fat. I added about 4 more cups of chicken stock to thin out this delicous sauce. I placed it back in the oven for the remaining hour when the meat became very tender! I am sorry when I went to serve it I didn't add another cup or two of stock to extend the sauce a little bit more. Because I am on a budget I think I will try it with brisket or pot roast. I portioned up each large bowl with a scoop of mashed potatoes, placing the short ribs on top with a laddle of sauce, and garnished it with the grated orange zest, chopped parsely and kalamata olives. The garnish really made all the flavours pop!! This recipe is delicious and my guests thought it was fabulous!!!! It's a KEEPER!!

Fabulous! I browned the ribs and made the sauce, put it together and refrigerated overnight. Then returned to room temperature and baked for about 5 hours. This way I got to savor the heavenly aroma twice. I almost didn't add the kalamatas and orange zest but I was very glad I did. They added another dimension of flavor that had my guests practically swooning.

Great recipe - I suggest one modification: halve the vinegar. The full amount is a bit overpowering. However... this is a great recipe!

This is really wonderful! All the best of French comfort food. I used country-style pork ribs, but one could use chicken or other meats. Can serve w/ rice and omit olives for guests who may not care for them as they can be added at the very end. You won't be sorry you made this one...great for family or company!

Oh my gosh! This is so good! I first made it while visiting my son and daughter-in-law - they kept interrupting dinner conversation to say how good it was! I served it over a creamy polenta - perfect! Tomorrow night I'll serve this for dinner for two of my husband's business associates. This dish is homey, yet the flavors are exquisite. I'm sure to impress once again!

Unbelievably tasty and well balanced and not too difficult to make. I served it on a bed of noodles, which worked really well. Make sure you have a good baguette to help sop up the delicious sauce. Would definitely make again. The perfect make ahead meat dish - serve a special wine with it!
