Quite good. Although I changed enough things that I can't exactly review it as written, I have to say that the concept is very adaptable and very good. My family aren't eggplant lovers, so I substituted sliced portabello mushrooms and red/orange/yellow bell peppers marinated in an oil and vinegar dressing. The basil-cilantro pesto was left over from the night before. We used charcoal barbeque and the end result was a restaurant-worthy dinner.

This was okay, but the Grilled Eggplant Parmigiana Heros were so much better.

I added grilled tomato after reading the reviews, and used just-made homemade pesto and fresh mozzarella cut into slices instead of cubes (just seemed like it would stay on the sandwich easier). Was happy to use up the eggplant, tomatoes and peppers in the garden. It was very, very good but seemed like it was missing something. Grilled or carmelized onion maybe? My carnivore significant other said repeatedly how good it was, and ate a double serving.

This is so quick and easy! I also grill a chicken breast for the meat eaters when making this. It goes great on the sandwich. Griled squash is also great on this.

Excellent. I am not an eggplant lover, but had some I needed to use. I used this recipe as a guide and my layers were bread, pesto, grilled eggplant, a thin slice of chicken breast then the motz cheese. SO good! Wish I would have read the other review about adding a slice of grilled tomato because that would have made it even better.

This was an excellent recipe. It was easy to throw together and went over very well with everyone in the house.

Excellent. It's healthy and easy to throw together if you already have the pesto sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

I did change this recipe quite a bit and it was Delicious! I grilled the eggplant and added hot cappicollo. Instead of the pesto I used the vegetable spread that is sold in Italian delis.I used an asaigo baked ciabatta bread cut in half horizontally.I put some spread on it then I did a layer of bocconcini, then eggplant, then cappicolli, then provolone, then roasted peppers. I cut it into about three inch slices and served it slightly warmed. SOOO GOOD!

Delicious. Would work with most vegetables.

This is such a fabulous dish. I've made it a few times now, always to raves. I add a half of a jalepeno to the pesto to spice it up a bit. Yum!

We used eggplant, green bell pepper, and sweet onion. We didn't have fresh basil leaves, but the pesto was homemade and very flavorful (we made a lot of pesto several weeks ago and froze it in ice cube trays). We will definitely use this recipe again.

Made this for my church's Men's retreat - 100 hungry guys - no one thought to ask if it was eggplant or not - they loved it! 'Making it for 45 this Sat. as well :)

My husband is not a vegetable "fan". He LOVED this sandwich. I did add some salt to the pesto. I plan to make it for a nice lunch for the "girls".

used provolone instead of mozzarella and added grilled tomato slices. My wife wouldn't let me take the extra to work - she didn't want to share it! I'll be making this again this summer.

A great vegetarian lunch entree. I confess I used my own already frozen pesto, but it looks like a fine pesto recipe, and I think it would be great with a good purchased pesto as well. When I used large eggplants, I peeled the eggplants before grilling to make them even more tender.
