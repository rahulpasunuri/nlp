Thank you so much previous poster for the recommendation! We like the Crunchy Oil-Cured Tomatoes too, so that recipe is a great combo of the two! I have 4 young boys so this is great, I can throw it together last minute for a side dish or give this as a healthy snack and it's absurdly easy to make your own all in all a great base recipe to have. And to quote a genius: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  Leonardo da Vinci. And if genius isn't your thing, then think Coco Chanel - "Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance."

If you like this flavor combination, try the Blue Cheese Crusted Tomatoes on this site. They are delicious and again so simple with so few ingredients. Although the recipe calls for grilling the tomatoes, I usually bake them at 450 for about 15 minutes.

Great recipe, but skip the dressing and add a nice balance of a bood blue cheese like Maytag. I make this all the time but go a step further and add some diced celery. It has a nice mild flavor and adds crunch. I always like to drizzle a little homemade balsamic vinegette and cracked pepper on top - voila!

We live in La Roque Gageac, France and our neighbour gave us some of the most amazing seed grown tomatoes we've ever tasted in our lives. White balsamic, olive oil, herbs de provence and Roquefort cheese... It's all about the quality of the ingredients

Nothing accompanies a detailed and skillfully prepared main course like an exquisitely simple salad such as this. The beautifully complicated flavor of a naturally ripened tomato in season is perfectly offset by the simplicity of the additional ingredients. As an accomplished cook who loves to create and conquer challenging dishes, I find this to be refreshing - and valid. Thank you Bon Appetit for posting this recipe.

Luckily there are better places to find recipes. Your average fork rating is not reliable. 4 fork for this recipe? You lost somewhere the negative ones.

A lovely combination of colors, textures and flavor. Try creating your own "dressing" by crumbling bleu cheese and adding a dab of a white balsamic vinegar. It doesn't have to be complicated. A delightful way to enjoy the season's freshest produce!

Lovely suggested combination of flavors. Thanks, Epicurious, for reminding us simplicity works -- and works rather well. Your suggestion for a simplistic salad is a good reminder to keep the spotlight on the entree by surrounding it with simple salads and sides. Sounds like the foodies needing a 15-ingredient-high, are out in droves! To each his own.

I had a subscription to Gourmet for over 40 years. This is beyond lame. If the trogs here don't know what magic happens when a seasonal fruit/vegetable is wedded to a blue cheese, then they should go back to their trailers, whip out the Bisquick and factory hot-dogs for ye ol' 'pigs in a blanket'. Hey, company's comin', get that hound off the couch!"

I've been cooking for 40 years, but this is a combination I wouldn't have thought of. A recipe doesn't have to be complicated to be good, but there are always people who feel that they're too good for something this simple. I'm getting sick of hearing from them every time there's a recipe with less than ten ingredients.

Wow.. I know this world is full of sour people...just looking for something to comment something negative,that for a moment, makes them feel superior. Really? A recipe? Get a grip folks..and a life. Epicurious sets out some really fantasic recipes, menu ideas and suggestions. When I first saw this salad.. I thought "oh, what a nice idea" I thought about the great home grown tomatoes I have and stopping by the grocers to pick up some chunky blue cheese.. I thought it would be great with the bbq chicken we are having. But some of those out there immediately zone in on anything to pick at.. kinda pathetic. This is a nice, simple idea as a side dish..thanks Epi for posting it..no harm done! sheesh...

Simple and delicious...We as a population have gotten the idea that it is good to be negative about everything.....Sorry you don't like it but Many do. We will enjoy without your review or permission.......

Okay, this is good. That's why I've been putting this "combo" together for more years than I care to admit to. I learned it from my Mom (who is now 95) and she got the idea from my grandmother. It's debatable about the title "recipe".

This is an exceptional salad, especially made with home grown tomatoes or heirlooms. I've been making it for years and the simplicity of the ingredients is fabulous. But...including a recipe for a great Bleu Cheese dressing should have been in order. Not everyone knows how to make one. And yes, anyone can look up a recipe, but why not include it?

I do love blue cheese and tomatoes, but I have to agree, this is LAME! How about a summer tomato and BC souffle or gratin or foccaccia, etc....

What is wrong with people? This is so good. I had not thought of this. I have so many tomatoes and this is one more yummy dish for them. Wine club loved them! How about the na sayers going somewhere else to whine?

Sometimes we need reminding that simplicity doesn't mean "No Good". What if a very simple salad is the perfect touch with a stronger entree? Fine choice to help us remember.

I don't understand why people are bad-mouthing this. It's quite delicious, simple and nice to look at. There are a lot of people who enjoy a simple, quick idea for a dinner salad. I also enjoy it with just a touch of chopped red onion.

I made this salad exactly to the recipe and it was delicious. It is the same recipe handed down from my grandmother. Don't know how Bon Appetit got ahold of it, but now that the secret is out, I hope everyone can enjoy it as we have, for generations to come.

Tomatoes and "your favorite home-made blue cheese dressing" - this is a recipe by the Test Kitchen? This would motivate you to buy Bon Appetit?

Up next a recipe called "water" where we take a clear liquid and pour it in a glass. Agreed with Faitheliz that this isn't a recipe.
