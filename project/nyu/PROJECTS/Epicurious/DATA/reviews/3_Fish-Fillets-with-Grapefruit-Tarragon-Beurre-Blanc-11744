This was not so hot in my opinion - there are many dishes out there that are worth this amount of fat and calories, but this is not one of them. The presentation was very nice, but the flavor just wasn't there.

This recipe was absolutely awesome! Simple and delicious. I used red snapper. No revisions necessary.
