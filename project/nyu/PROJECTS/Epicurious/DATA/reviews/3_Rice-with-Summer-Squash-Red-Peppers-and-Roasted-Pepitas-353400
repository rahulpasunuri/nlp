Be sure to add lots of salt and pepper. I put extra veggies in and is was very good. I also substituted cilantro for parsley.

This recipe is much better when you add the cut squash and peppers five minutes before the end of the rice's cooking time, and then add a handful of cheddar or jack cheese when the rice is done, at the same time you add the parsley and pepitas.

easy! Might need something extra (tomatillos?)

This was good, not great. I really liked the pumpkin seeds but didn't really notice the zucchini in the finished rice. It was a perfect compliment to the modern fiesta menu.

Very good. The zucchini wasn't overcooked, as I suspected it would be. I used both pumpkin & sunflower seeds, and did have to add a little salt and pepper. Nice side dish with enchiladas.

Sort of an interesting idea, but this clearly looks like a recipe for overcooked summer squash. I'll have to think about how I would go about making my own version of this.
