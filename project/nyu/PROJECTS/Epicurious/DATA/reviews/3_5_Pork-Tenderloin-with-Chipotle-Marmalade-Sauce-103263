I have made this recipe SO many times since it was originally published and is always a big hit. I suggest reducing the broth a little more as the sauce is a bit thin and cornstarch is needed if you like a thicker sauce. I just love the spicy, sweet, sour tang. I serve with smoked gouda mashed potatoes.

Meh. If you want a great pork sauce recipe, try the Roast Pork with Sweet and Sour Chile Cilantro sauce on this site - it's dynamite. This was dull.

I have easily made more than 100 recipes from Epicurious, and this sauce has to be among the most disappointing of all of them. It does not warrant the expense of the broth nor the time to cook it down. Just a complete waste of time and ingredients. And then it's not even reduced enough, so the recipe calls for thickening with cornstarch? I will not make again.

My husband loved this. We used pan fried pork chops instead of the tenderloin because thats what we had. The sauce was more spicy than sweet for us, I used probably 1/2 Tbs more of the chipolte than called for and an All Fruit marmalade. Delish!

this was delicious and different! I used Hero brand marmalade and it was not sweet at all. My husband, who has been a taster for many pork sauces, declared this to be the best ever.

I am a big fan of epicurious recipes, and have come to trust the ratings. This was the first recipe from the site that just didn't cut it. The sauce tasted oddly like cough syrup...I am wondering the degree to which the brand of marmalade makes the difference.

You know, I thought this would be really great, but it was just bland. This may be improved by adding more marmalade to make it a bit sweeter.

I don't understand the reviewers that think it was too spicy. The whole family agrees that the amount of peppers should be doubled next time. Excellent dish that can easily be made on a week night.

Fruity sauces with meat are not for everyone, especially if they are also spicy. We loved this, but I made a similar dish once with lamb, figs and apricots, which my parents devoured -- and made my mother-in-law vomit.

Great sauce!! When you complete the recipe, add ½ cup of heavy cream. It just makes the sauce a really big hit!!

This is a delicious dish! I serve the pork in medallions over wild rice with the sauce poured over the top - superb. We've made it several times and love it every time.

Easy and good. No problems and good heat. I did not find it too sweet- it must depend on the orange marmalade used.

Rating: 2
I also found the sauce overwhelmingly sweet. I realized that it lacks that tang I had expected due to the "orange" ingredient. I added liberal doses of line juice until the sauce had the right combination of hot, sweet and citrusy flavors. While it came out fine, I wouldn't bother to make it again as there are too many other recipes with less fuss.

I made this with what I had on hand while in Mexico: Knorr bouillon cubes, sweet onion and apricot marmalade and it was wonderful!! The pork tenderloin here is extremely good.

Delicious! Simple to make, but always a big hit. Definitely spicy, so watch that with some crowds. For those who appreciate flavorful heat, though, its tough to beat this one.

Just wanted to say, I made this, and it turned out "not quite right". I honestly think it's the marmalade -- I bought Seville orange and the sauce had a nasty bitter taste to it. But I could definitely taste the sweet, smoky, and hot flavors lurking under the bitter. I will try this again with sweet orange marmalade and see if that makes a difference!

divine! had to add more marmalade and more adobo sauce to get the sweet/hot balance where I wanted it, but the end result was just scrumptious. my husband's already asking for me to make it again.

Rating: 3
The reviews on this were so varied, I decided I had to try it for myself. After I finally found the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce...I made the recipe, using the sauce as a marinade...poured some of it over the pork and let sit for about 4 hours, then I grilled the pork, using the sauce to baste it. Delicious!

Just made this again and it turned out awful. The pork itself was dry and the sauce didn't help. The flavors didn't meld this time.

Rating: 2
As it says under two forks "Like it, don't love it." I am a BIG fan of things sweet and spicy, so I like this for that reason, but it lacks a bit in presentation and depth of flavor. And the fact that the sauce takes an hour to make, makes it a difficult weekday recipe. I prefer dishes that call for marinating the tenderloin.

Great hit! I used 3 tbsp chipotles to give it more intense flavor. Also, I didn't have orange marmalade so I used apple jelly.

Rating: 2
This sauce dissappointed me. It smelled wonderful when I made it and actually I loved the sublte flavors when i tasted it by itself. But when I served it over the pork, it seemed that all that came through was the bit of kick from the chipotles. None of the slight sweetness from the marmalade showed up...Although certainly not hard to make, it was more effort than it delivered.

I have 2 words for this dish...DEE-LISH. My husband and I both loved it. I doubled the chipotles, and it had quite a kick. Also seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and thyme. Served with brown rice and roasted brussels sprouts. It was an easy, tasty Sunday night dinner. I had a lot of leftover sauce and will try it as a glaze for salmon on the bbq.

My husband and I were quite happy with this recipe. I wanted it spicy so I doubled the chipotles - fantastic!

My family loved this. I wanted it less spicy, so I used half the recommended chipotle. the sauce was delicious, and the pork was fine by itself for people who don't like the spice.

My family (including my 3 yr old) loved this! I made a few substitutions to use what I had on hand--low-sugar apricot preserves in place of the marmalade, onions (finely chopped) in place of shallots and red pepper flakes instead of peppers. EXCELLENT -- next time I will try the sauce over shrimp, and I think it may even work with broiled salmon...thanks for a big hit!

I can't figure out why so many people disliked this dish. I made it for 12 people and every single person raved about how great it was. I made the sauce a day ahead and reheated it. It had just the right spiciness tempered by the slightly sweet taste from the marmalade. Definitely give it a chance.

I have made this dish a number of times and I always get compliments on both the meat and the gravy. I never have chipotle peppers on hand, so I use crushed red pepper instead - adds a zing to the sweetness of the marmalade.

Easy and quick to make. My picky eater children liked it alot. Had to add more of the marmalade. Would definetly use low sodium broths because it was alittle on the salty side. Put a potatoe in the sauce to eliminate some of the saltiness. Served it over rice.

Tried this with Shrimp not pork and came out fantastic. The combination of chipotle and orange is great with seafood as well as pork. Just brown the shrimp or scallops in butter and a small amount of oil. Add to the sauce and stir for 1 minute to heat through. Everyone raved!

Yuck! While the sauce was cooking, my husband commented that it smelled like wet gym socks. Unfortunately, it tasted the same way. I don't understand - I followed the recipe to the letter and still came out with something that smelled and tasted like the inside of a gym locker (I think!). Pork was wonderful, but then, roasted pork tenderloin seared before roasting is hard to screw up. We used Central Market's Charred Pineapple Bourbon sauce instead, and it was awesome.

This was excellent, and quite easy to prepare. Very good, and if you like it REALLY hot, just add extra chipotle pepper when making sauce. But don't overdue it! My family loves hot dishes, and this is now on their top ten list.

Well worth the effort! The sauce was absolutely delicious--a nice, complex blend of sweet, spicy, and salty that complemented the pork perfectly. Very tasty. I served with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes and a Radicchio Slaw with Warm Honey Vinaigrette. Clean plates and compliments to the chef all around. Thank you, epicurious!

This was fabulous -low sodium broth is definitely a good idea. my gf complained about the texture so i ran it through the cuisinart the second time -made all the difference because there were no orange chunks and the marmalade was well combined. will make again for sure

This recipe was so so. I was really looking forward to it after reading the reviews but I was a bit disappointed. It was a bit too sweet for me (and I even used low sugar marmalade). The mix of the peppers and marmalade just didn't seem natural. If I were to do it again, I'd use more peppers, less marmalade and low sodium broths.

Wow, was I unpleasantly surprised after taking the time to prepare this. I have had such great experiences with recipes on this site but this was really a poor recipe. Extra care was taken to have the exact ingredients and preparations but it was overly sweet and not rewarding for effort.

The dish was so easy to make! And it got rave reviews from all my guests. I used fruit only marmalade and added 1 T. of orange juice concentrate to punch it up a little. Also added an extra T. of chipotle peppers. It took much longer than stated for the second sauce reduction and oven cooking the roast.

I have made this twice. It is easy, delicious and impressive. (Your guests will think you slaved!) I like it spicy, so I doubled the peppers. Make sure you let the sauce thicken enough so that it sticks to the meat.

I've made this four times now. Absolutely fantastic!! Yes more than once I've subed onions for shallots. We enjoy hot, so I've modified the chipoltes to about 1/4 cup. Even after Gastric Bypass I've been able to enjoy this meal to its fullest. Two meddalions and small side I'm set. Good eating. Enjoy!!

This was fantastic! My modifications: Didn't have marmalade - used apricot preserves. Didn't have shallots - used chopped onions (a little less) and a chopped garlic clove. Rubbed the pork in some creole seasoning befor searing. Served with mashed potatoes and balsamic glazed baby carrots. Delicious!

I prepared this dish last night for 8 people and it was absolutely wonderful. We like spicey so I used 2 chipotle chilies and found the flavor to be perfect for our tastebuds. I doubled the meat requirement and served the sauce on the side in case my guests found it to be too hot. Everyone used it and commented on how much they enjoyed it. As usual I referred everyone to this site for the recipe. I think this sauce would be excellent with shrimp and will try that next.

Rating: 3
This was good, only briny. I rated it highly because I think, with low-sodium broths, the salty flavor could be a lot less overpowering. Do NOT add salt to this sauce, or the meat for that matter, because the broth just turns too salty when cooked down. Overall, very tasty flavors otherwise.

this is the second time i've made this recipe and we can't get enough of it. I probably add 1/4 cup more of the marmalade as we like it a bit sweeter. everyone loves it.

The smoky/sweet sauce makes this dish! I used no salt added chicken and beef broth for the reduction. I also spread the tenderloins with marmelade and then coated them with a mixture of cumin, sage, thyme, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. My guests raved about it. Definitely make this one again!

Rating: 4
I make this for clients all the time, and they love it! The only thing I do a little different is I use More Than Gourmet Roasted Chicken Stock Base in place of the chicken broth (about 2 tablespoons to 2 cups of water) and I use about 2 cups of beef broth. The base makes the sauce rich and thick without using the cornstarch. The sweet and smokey flavors are terrific!

Just great! We used a turkey tenderloin and doubled the marmalade and found the taste just perfect.

Awesome!!! Made the following necessary changes: Cook the pork tenderloin in a pan first then transfer to baking dish and finish in oven. Then make the sauce by cooking shallots in same pan and deglazing with a bit of wine. Instead of beef broth, used homemade venison demi-glaze and chicken stock. Strained the stock after cooking and added a touch of butter to finish. Un-frikin'-believable!

My husband and I have been making this recipe for 2 years now. It has become one of our "signature" dishes - one that we know without fail will impress our guests. I also double the marmalade... it happened by accident the first time, but was so good, I continue to prepare it that way. We accompany the pork with seared field greens (wilt in a wok with some balsamic vinegar) and parmesan grits. It makes for a simply outstanding meal.

This turned out well. I doubled the marmalade. The sauce was wonderful ! Even those who don't like hot spicy food loved the sweet/hot flavor. I also added a sprig of fresh Thyme to the the stock as it reduced. Which took twice as long as the recipe states. I served this with Corn, Zucchini and Poblano Chili saute and asparagus sauted with fresh garlic. The recipe also instructs you to usa a medium sauce pan for the 8 cups then a large pan for combining the ingredients after the stock is rediced to 2.5 cups ?? This is reversed.

Rating: 3
Served this to guests tonight and it was a big hit. The sauce was a wonderful blend of sweet and spicy. It was not at all too hot -- maybe those who thought it was too hot didn't remove the seeds from the chipotles? Served it with the Whipped Chipotle Sweet Potatoes and Swiss Chard Sauteed with Garlic -- a great winter meal! Like others, I had to cook the pork longer than called for in the recipe.

Rating: 1
BLEAH. I should really give it one more chance since I substituted the orange marmalade for pureed mandarin oranges and a little brown sugar, but the flavor was similar enough for me to get the idea and I was definitely not inspired to try again. Even though it was spicy, it was not FLAVORFUL. As one other reviewer said, there are many BETTER recipes for pork tenderloin.

I served the pork on a bed on Mashed Potatoes with Cinlantro and Roasted Chilies, another receipe available on this website. I poured th esuace on top, and passed the extra at the table. The dish was a big hit. Very nice presentation. Easy to make. Made the sauce ahead and re-warmed on the night of the dinner party.

This was a fabulous way to spice up a pork tenderloin. The Chipolte was not at our local grocery store but easy to find at a International Market. Cook the pork just to the temperature recommended and you'll have a tender and flavor filled entree. We love it!

Delicious! I made this for dinner for friends and they loved it. Even my finicky mother loved the spiciness of the sauce. I used a full 4 cups (2 cans each) of the broth; what was I going to do with those two 1/3 cups hanging around? Also used another teaspoon of cornstarch (perhaps because of the extra broth) for the sauce. I ran out of canned chipotles, so I used a teaspoon of dried ones I had on hand. It took me maybe 10 to 15 mins. longer in the oven to get the meat done; perhaps my oven is off. Oh, before I forget, I served two wines that went exceptionally well with this: Fetzer Echo Ridge Sauvignon Blanc and a new one from Kendall-Jackson: Collage, a red zin-syrah blend!

Updated review.. This has become standard fair for me. Had last minute week night guests from out of town the other evening. Stopped at a differnt store on way home from work. They did not have Chipoltes, so I bought Chipolte flavored salsa. It took a little testing to get the right heat, but was still a great sauce. I noticed two of my guest were putting the sauce on their rice pilaf as well as the pork. You must be careful with the Chipoltes if you are not used to heat. I tested this recipe for just my husband and I. It was great. I froze the sauce and used again about two weeks later and it was still great.

This is a fabulous recipe! One of the most flavorful I've ever had. I can't wait to make it again, and this time for company. It's pretty hot (which suits me just fine) so if you're not from Texas or New Mexico you might want to cut back on the peppers a little. But the combination of the peppers and the orange flavor is unbeatable!

I think that this could be really good, but we found it way too hot. The chipotle peppers overwhelmed the sauce. None of the other reviewers seemed to find it too hot, so I wonder if the peppers can vary greatly. I'll try again, but with just a tsp or less of peppers.

Since I got this recipe in my April issue, I have made it three times. Its a wonderful marriage of flavors. The amount of chipolte they suggest is right on - be careful not to allow too many seeds if you dont want lots of heat. The meat comes out very tender. The sauce makes the dish though. YUMM.

A very good recipe, a new taste for me because it is the first time I try chipotle chilies in adobo sauce. I put this with apricot jam and chicken broth. This dish has a delicious smokey flavor, the sauce is one you can get addicted to. Can't wait till I make this dish again.
