This is a lovely recipe, the sauce tastes good with eggplant too. I add a tablespoon of tomato paste to the tomatos and cook the sauce down till it's nice and thick. To the poster above who found the lemongrass too chewy you are supposed to strain them out.

This sauce recipe did not work at all! The result was bland "tomato water". What sauce?? A complete waste. I can usually count on Gourmet and Epicurious but this was a total failure. Who tested it?

If you like bland, this is the recipe for you. Forget the lemongrass (which is tough and chewy) and just use lemon juice or zest, more garlic and either cilantro or parsley.

The lemongrass tomato sauce is very disappointing. It's quite bland and uninteresting. Halibut, grilled and then drizzled w/olive oil, is wonderful on its own.

I was disappointed by this dish. The sauce came out really thin and was too tomatoey and not spicy enough. I added some garlic chili sauce and that helped a bit but the consistency was still poor. Luckily the fish tasted great just with the olive oil and salt and pepper.
