I made this in a triple batch and thought it too sweet with just one cup of honey. I added sea salt to cut the sweetness. If I make this again, I will reduce the amount of honey. I did not use brandy as most of my friends do not imbibe and I added nutmeg. Out of 6 jars of "Simply Fruit" orange marmalade (with little sweetness), I yielded 7 small jelly jars. It is a great homemade gift and it looks nice in the jelly jars.

Although this recipe does look pretty in the jars. I would have liked it to be "spicey" as the title says. It needs more of a "kick". The Brandy doesn't cut it. Any thoughts?

This marmalade was delicious, easy and looked lovely. I always hesitate when something is not made from scratch like this but it really was wonderful and worth making for gifts this Christmas.

This marmalade is very pleasant on crackers, cornbread, and baked squash/sweet potatoes, but I don't like it on toast.

The "5 minute" bit is kind of underestimating, but it really was fast. And boy is this good, I couldn't fit all of my batch into the jars so I whipped out a box of crackers...bliss!

I made two batches of this last year, one for us, and one for Christmas gifts, and have already had two requests for repeat gifts this year. It is just so very great, and so easy to make!! It's a wonderful addition to a goodie basket for the holidays or a hostess gift.
