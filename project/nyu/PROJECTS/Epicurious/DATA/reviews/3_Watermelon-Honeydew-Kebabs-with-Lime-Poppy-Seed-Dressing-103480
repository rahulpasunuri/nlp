This was so tasty, I balled all the melon and let it sit in the dressing to marinate a couple hours so I wasn't too worried about it being watery. So the melon ended up just having a lime taste with the pretty poppy seed and less a goopy dressing. I used the long cocktail toothpicks and poked them into the empty watermelon shell. It looked pretty, and was so refreshing. I used only 1/4-1/3c. oil and added some lime zest to the dressing.

This was good but I found the dressing alittle thin(watery). The taste was good. I also decided to forgo the skewers and made it more like a salad in a bowl.

Not only is this delicious but the presentation is outstanding. The contrast of the black seeds against the colors of the fruit make something so simple become very special.

I thought this was just OK, but it seemed to be a huge hit with my guests. I preferred it with just a dollop of dressing.

Good, but way too much oil. Also, I think more dressing is needed. Next time I will modify the recipe a bit.

I own a catering business. I recently prepared appetizers for 150 people at a grand opening of a new business. The weather had been extremely hot so I thought I'd prepare some things that were light, cool and refreshing. This recipe was one that I prepared! It was a big hit! I did cut back a little on the oil... overall it went over perfectly! I'm adding it to my "keeper" list of appetizers!

This recipe is great. I have some reservations about giving kids food on skewers though. I turned this dish into a fruit salad by cutting the melons in a bowl and then pouring the dressing over the fruit. I also used 1/4 cup of oil and extra lime juice to make it less fattening.

The first time I served this, I sliced the watermelon then cut out shapes with cookie cutters, threaded them on skewers and served them with the dressing. A great success. People wanted the recipe for the delicious dressing. Last night I made the dressing again but it seemed oily. Maybe the problem was that the first time I used real lime juice and let the dressing sit overnight. Yesterday, I used bottled lime juice and served it immediately.

This was only okay as is, though by omitting the entire amount of oil and by changing the sugar to honey, it was much better. A decent way to use of some of a large melon, but not worthwhile going out of your way to make. The melon actually benefits from chilling in the syrup for half an hour or so.

I loved this recipe to use as something light and cool to serve on a hot summer night. The dressing was excellent. The only negative was taking something low fat, like fruit and making it fatening with the 1/2 cup of oil in the dressing. But it was different and certainly did well serving as an appetiser for a dinner party.
