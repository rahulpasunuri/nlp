I just made this for brunch. I read the recipe online but didn't write it down, so I forgot to add the garlic and I added 2T fresh lime juice instead. It rocked! I used 6 tiny green chilis, and it was hot, but not too. I loved the complete non-fruitiness of the sake, but I could see that it would work with white wine, but you'd lose some of the asian appeal of the dish, I think. This is a great asian fusion recipe--even my 17 year old son who doesn't really like seafood loved it.

I agree that this dish was too hot as written. Although the mussels were sweet, tender and perfectly cooked I will not make this recipe again. There are too many recipes out there where the mussels (rather than the heat) are the focus of flavor.

This was easy and wonderful. I substituted a dry white wine for the sake, and it worked out just as well, i think. would be curious if anyone thinks i missed out by not using sake.

Liked it very much, but it was too hot. I used serrano chiles and will use only one or two next time. Served it over squid ink pasta and it was terrific.

Quick and delicious. I only used about 3/4 cup of onions and it was still very good.

I didn't have chiles and used cajun peper. It was still delicious.

Excellent appetizer. Recipe is short and easy to make. used only 2 serrano chiles and was spicy enough.

This was a nice change of pace. I used serano chiles and boy was it hot!

We have made these twice already. The second time we doubled everything but the mussels so that we'd have more broth to dip bread into.
