Worst recipe I have found to date on-line, you would be better off making mashed potatoes, or garlic mashed potatoes served with sausage. One word to describe this recipe: YUCK!!!!!

This was okay. I drained the sausage so it wasn't greasy. I don't see why you'd need the sausage, anyway, if you're serving it with meat. I did heat up a scoop in the micro just to see if it was "yuck". It wasn't. It was just like the 1st time. Okay.

I must admit the first time I looked at this recipe I was somewhat dubious - but made it anyway. It turned out great! I served it with roast pork covered with rosemary and garlic. A side of slow sauted asparagus and a light red wine. Watch the amount of milk as it may be a little to much.....

Mustard And sausage go so well together.

This dish wasn't bad- I certainly didn't think it deserved some of the harsher comments- it just wasn't great. I sauteed some chopped onion with the sausage and drained the mixture before proceeding, which I would recommmend.

served with chicken and bernaise sauce atop potatoes and side dish of broccoli. Excellent company dish.

Yeesh! This stuff could bloat a lead pipe! I'm not sorry I made it, though. It was very different. I can safely say there is nothing else like it. This recipie made a TON of food, and, although it's a little weird to reheat, my boyfriend (the human disposal) will probably eat the leftovers. Oh yeah, plan to nap after eating this.

Different. Best as part of a whole "theme" menu as offered in Epicurious New Batch of March 13.That's what I did. Mr. O'Shea next door liked the potatoes and everything else but the creamed spinach on that one.Tried nuking leftover spuds as a late night munchie...YUCK!

I agree w/the person that wrote "don't knock it till you've tried it". I admit it sounds strange but then when you consider the relationship of the ingredients I can see where this would work. Besides, I've been doing something similar to this for years. A great way to use leftovers for a meal or packing a lunch. Some of us imagineative, thrifty people can't throw anything away!

Don't knock it until you've tried it , folks ! I was just looking for a recipe for the insides of the potatoes I had left after making potato skins so thought I'd give this recipe a try . It's actually really good , especially with the addition of chopped onion and garlic ....
