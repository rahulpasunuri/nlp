This is a great, low fat, quick recipe. I've served it plain (as the recipe makes) as a main course, but tonight am putting it on rolls with arugula, tomato, and a little mayo. It makes an exceptional sandwich if you have leftovers, which is how I discovered tonight's dinner. I never have time for a long marinade (don't think that far ahead), so this is a fast & easy perfect summer dinner.

Tasty, easy, and fast way to get chicken on the BBQ. Nice that it doesn't leave too much muck on the grill either - I will make it again but tweak the spices a bit first - this was a touch too smoky for my taste.

Not that great...nice vinegar taste, but the chicken was so-so.

Oooh, yeah!! I just finished eating this dinner, and wanted to make sure I put this one in my "recipe box." Very, very, easy! And yummy! If you like the flavor of barbeque sauce without the heavy "ketchup" texture, this is IT! This recipe would be very easy for a large crowd--as much chicken as your grill would hold. Unfortunately, my hub and I were the only ones home tonite, but we did a job on it all. The only thing I altered was the amount of cayenne (I only used 1/2 tsp.) because we are not fans of "hot." The 1/2 tsp was just right for us. Definitely a keeper. Great for an easy meal when you have friends over on short notice.

Quick preparation and delicious. Marinade and cooking time were perfect - moist and tender with a kick!

The recipe is easy and the chicken was very moist but the pepper overpowered the vinegar and other ingredients.

Both chicken and pork chops were marinated for about 25 minutes. I think we liked it because it was not so vinegary if left longer to marinate. The flavors and tenderness were perfect. I could not find cumin in Norway so used caraway instead which was fine. We used this for a grill party and it definite was a Four Fork winner.

I like vinegar - nice variety for serving chicken. Definitely marinate for at least a couple of hours with vinegar.

Great flavor. I marinated overnight. Sauce had a strong vinegar flavor and was quite tasty. The chicken was very moist and tender. A light, flavorful dinner.

We enjoyed this, but you need to like a tangy, vinegar-y tasting sauce, a little like North Carolina barbecue, to appreciate this. High in taste, low in fat and calories.

Loved this recipe. Chicken was so tender and it couldn't be quicker or easier. Next time I'll make more, I think it would be great sliced and served cold over salad the next day.

This was very good. But be warned: it's spicy! Next time I make this, I'm going to use some of the basting sauce to make a yogurt sauce--the cooling effect of the yogurt with the spices should be very satisfying....

A different and delicious recipe for BBQ chicken. A big hit with my partner and guests. Already filed in my recipe box.

We've used this sauce on chicken breasts and pork tenderloins. It's terrific. Both the chicken and the pork grilled up nice and brown without getting blackened. We marinated the chicken for a half hour or so, and the pork for two hours. The pork was esp. tender and juicy.

This is absolutely the best chicken recipe I've ever made. I sometimes use the whole chicken and double the sauce, marinating it for several hours. It's now our favorite recipe for grilling chicken and never fails to please even the most finicky eaters (children).

This was a great dish! Put it on the grill for a dinner party, everyone loved it -- Will make this dish again.

Yes, needs to marinate; any chicken pieces works well.

Excellent flavoring to the chicken! A nice change from the tomato BBQ sauces. Vinegar gave it a tartness rather than sweetness and spices added the heat. Very simple to prepare. I substituted chicken parts and marinated for about 1 - 2 hours. Definitely a repeat in our house.

Yummy! I used half of the basting sauce to marinate chicken tenders for about 20 minutes. I added some olive oil to the other half and marinated chunked onions and summer squash. Cooked it all as shishkabab and it was delicious. The veggies had a just-right warm aftertaste. The chicken was tender and without oil in the marinade the chicken didn't char excessively. Wonderful. Everyone loved it. I had the leftovers cold on a salad this noon. Try this recipe, it's easy and very good.

This is easy easy easy and also tastes great - we made at least once a week last summer and never tired of it; served it to company on numerous occaisons. Somehow, 20 minutes in the marinade produces extremely moist, flavorful chicken. Yum, it's a staple!

Wonderful! I actually used Chicken Legs and let them marinate for 2 hours. We loved it. A welcome change from tomato based barbecue sauces. This will be a recipe I use again and again.

Used leg quarters. Needs to marinate for at least a few hours.

This dish was very quick, healthy, and tasty. Will become a definate regular on the busy week-night rotation. The sauce was very tangy and added a nice flavor and tenderness to the chicken.

We tried this with leg quarters and it was excellent, but needed a bit more time in the marinade. The heated sauce for dipping was great.

My family and I all loved this recipe, including our 9 year old daughter......the vinegar and cayenne give the chicken a great flavor and it was very quick and easy to prepare!! A definite make again dish in our house!

Easy. Looks beautiful - great colour and grill marks when done. Taste is mediocre.

This was so easy and the chicken stayed juicy and tender on the grill. I especially liked the short marinating time.

This dish is very tasty and has that little zing. My spouse is very particular about chicken and it was well excepted and liked.

very good, very easy - and if you have fussy children, you can just leave the sauce off theirs and serve plain and everyone is happy. Good weeknight standby!

i would use vinegar & soy sauce., and only one cup of vinegar instead of one and a quarter per your recipe. soy sauce 1/2 cup.
