I love, love, love everything about this recipe: it's easy, quick, healthy and delicious. I've made it as written, and also made it with substitutions when I didn't have all ingredients available. I've subbed brown sugar for maple syrup (and do so now as a rule b/c it's cheaper) and lemon juice for limes when I forgot to buy limes. All iterations are great. Does anyone have suggestions for similarly tasty, quick and easy recipes? I'd love more like this one!

Oh yes. Superb. We loved it, loved it, loved it. That said, I couldn't taste the maple syrup in the glaze (I used the real deal). I think honey or agave would have done the same job. Next time I will make it with brown rice so I can feel even more virtuous.

So easy, so good. My new favorite salmon recipe!

My husband says this one is a keeper. For my family, I would call this 3 good sized servings. We'd do better with a 5 to 6 oz piece of salmon, each. But it was quick and easy and the flavor was outstanding!

This was delicious and made us feel so healthy. Plus, it comes together really fast! We had it over brown rice instead of jasmine rice, and used regular white sesame seeds. Will definitely be making this again and again.

From all the rave reviews I just had to make this! I'm a beginner cook and look for easy recipes. This one was super easy!! I only had 2 pieces of fillets so I kinda winged the measurements and instead of cornstarch (had none!) I used flour, 2x the garlic and water, and used half of what the recipe called for of maple syrup. I also sauteed the spinach with garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes and lemon. Delicious!!!

This is one of the very best epicurious has to offer, and wonderfully low in fat also. I substituted Trader Joe's frozen brown rice for the jasmine rice and doubled the amount of spinach, and every bite was consumed. I recommend doubling the glaze recipe and keeping it on hand so that you can whip this one-bowl dinner up in under half an hour.

This recipe is one of the best recipes I've ever tried from this site because it is delicious, easy, and healthy. It is very rare that I come across a recipe that is healthy and takes me less than 30 minutes to make and that I don't have to force myself to eat because it tastes like diet food. This was wonderful. I will definitely make this many time again in the future.

Super easy to make for a weekday dinner. Everyone loved it including my six year old daughter. It's a keeper!

I love this recipe. I make it about once a week. I do not follow the recipe to the letter, but it still comes out fantastic. This is what I do: I use half a stick of butter, about 4 large cloves of garlic, juice from 1 large lemon, equal amount of soy sauce to the lemon juice, and 3 flat spoons of brown sugar. I think the recipe called for 4 fillets? If not, this is what I use for the amount of sauce I make.

I absolutely love this dish, it has become a part of my meal rotation. I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the sauce and omitted the sesame seeds. I also use brown rice instead of jasmine.

It's amazing, the lime in it was just the perfect amount and leaves this fantastic zest after the sweetness of the maple syrup. Just great and simple.

Quick and easy dinner and delish! My kids loved it - cut back on the red pepper flakes for them. Will add to the rotation of week night dinners.

This was very quick and easy - great for a weeknight. I added snow peas and green onions with the spinach, and sauted the vegetables with 1 clove of garlic and plenty of salt & pepper. The marinade is very sweet, so next time I'll reduce the amount of maple syrup. My husband added soy sauce to the finished dish.

I made this last week for my family. Based on other reviews re: the maple syrup, I substituted brown sugar. I also seasoned the fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder before putting on the glaze. I used garlic oil to wilt the spinach and seasoned with salt and pepper. We thought this dish had plenty of flavor. The only thing I would change next time is the amount of cornstarch I add; the sauce was too thick to "drizzle" so I had to add chicken broth to thin. Will definitely make this again -- a true "weeknight dinner".

I thought this was bland and subpar compared to lots of other salmon dishes, which are typically easy and tasty. I made as directed except added chili sauce to the sauce (which didn't contribute much) and cooked the spinach in peanut oil with some of the sauce, neither of which worked well in the end. The dish was too sweet for my liking; I had to sprinkle a lot of sriracha sauce when eating. My husband thought it was better- said he would use less syrup and more hot sauce when cooking.

This is so good. I made it as shown in the recipe, with the exception that I grilled the fillets on the BBQ with salt and pepper and a touch olive oil...until they were almost done, and then i brushed on some of the sauce. For the spinach situation, I sauteed some mushrooms and green onins first, and then added the spinach at the end. Flavours blended great.

This recipe was delicious! i wasnt sure about the wilted spinich but it was amazing and added so much to the dish. even my 4 year old daughter loved it. i also added some ginger to the sauce and i made my own baked rice recipe, but overall it was AMAZING!! i will definately make this again!!!

I probably shouldn't review the recipe because I had to make substitutions with what was on hand (lemons not limes, and a brown sugar syrup) but it was delicious. We even used frozen spinach and it was still terrific. My picky husband loved it. This might be a couple of times a month dinner!

The sauce is amazing. We made it with some very flavorful salmon and some that had a milder flavor. The sauce was great with both, but it really complemented the flavor of the more deeply colored and flavored salmon. The spinach and jasmine rice set off the fish nicely.

Wow this was delicious! Doubled the sauce and added some avocado and pickled ginger. Will be making this again..and again.

Very quick, easy, healthy and delicious! I couldn't find black sesame seeds so I substituted them for the regular ones. I added extra red pepper flakes because I like my food hot. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my regular rotation.

So easy, so good, so healthy! I upped the garlic and used New Mexican ground red chili instead of pepper flakes. There was very little sauce left after slathering it on the salmon, so I added a couple of tablespoons of water to the pan and wilted the spinach. Just one pot to clean up; I also sprayed the aluminum foil that lined the baking sheet.

Good and the taste is quite authentic. I decided to use wild spinach (which has a sturdier structure) and to make about 150% of the sauce. I heated the remaining sauce in a wok (with a little water) until very hot and added the spinach. Then I switched off the heat and tossed the spinach thoroughly. This way the spinach keeps it's structure without turning into a snot-like like substance. More red pepper flakes for those who like things hot should be available on the table.

I just tried this and thought it was quite good. I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the black sesame seeds. I had the regular ones. I will be making this again. It's good.

I've been making this recipe for years, it's almost exactly the same as the Javanese Roasted Salmon recipe from this site (2002), except the brown sugar in that recipe is replaced by maple syrup. I always double the spinach, and make additional sauce.

This was great. Everyone in the house loved it, even my three and five year old boys. The only thing that I would suggest is if your diabetic like me use a brown rice and use smuckers sugar free breakfast syrup to the sauce instead of the maple syrup. It lowers the overall carb count and adds more fiber. I will be making this again!

This was a good, simple meal. A solid option for a quick and healthy family dinner. My husband called it "restaurant quality." My 11-year old liked the sauce and finished his plate (he usually hates salmon.) I cooked the spinach in half canola, half sesame oil and added a clove or two of minced garlic to the oil before adding the spinach. I would bump up the quantity of the sauce just a tad... And yes, ginger, would likely be a good addition. Make it!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I would second the previous comment that the recipe could benefit from added ginger, and also suggest that you toast the sesame seeds to bring out a more nutty flavor that makes it pop.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. i didn't change a thing except used brown rice instead of white. ginger would be a nice addition.

This recipe sounds interesting but I find it odd that it appears as a top rated recipe and no one has reviewed it. Anybody out there tried this?
