Just as the other reviews, I had tons of powdered sugar and no granulated. Wonderful flavor. This cake has a wonderful crunchy outer and a soft moist inner. Make sure your pan is well greased and floured or greased and sugared as I usually do. Very nice, and I would absolutely use this recipe again!

I selected this recipe because I was out of granulated sugar (and didn't want to make a trip to the grocery!) but had plenty of powdered sugar. I thought I'd give it a try despite the mixed reviews and I'm very glad I did! It is moist with a delightful crisp crust and a nice butter and lemon flavor. What's not to like?

I made this despite only a 57% rating, as I had a lot of powdered sugar. I loved it and my friends are demanding more!!!

One fork does not mean this was a horrible recipe, it was light as a feather and had a fine flavor. But I agree with the cook from Newark, DE this was not a true pound cake recipe. I was looking for a heartier cake, with a denser crumb. The name of the recipe--"powdered sugar pound cake"--suggests at least to me a kind of old-fashioned goodness, the kind of cake that your southern grandma, if you had one, would always have baking in her kitchen. This was not such a cake. I have made many kinds of pound cakes, and powdered sugar pound cakes are my favorite ones to make. When made right, they are sweet, dense, moist and have a wonderful crusty top. I will stick to my old stand by.

I really like this recipe. I make a half-batch and use a loaf pan, and that works fine. It bakes 50 minutes to an hour. I took the cake to a party where there happened to be strawberries and whipped cream--yum! Now I bring the strawberries and whipped cream along with the cake.

I rated this only two forks, not because it's not good but not a true pound cake texture. I did like the outside crispness but the inside was too light of a crumb and not the dense, rich flavor a pound should be. Still good if that is not important.

This is a favorite at my house. I love making it with the lemon curd recipe! It's always a hit.

Very moist on the inside. Nice buttery taste with a hint of lemon. Nice with a little vanilla ice cream

Fabulous! Crisp and yummy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Doesn't have the typical "eggy" taste Ive experienced in most pound cakes. The variations on flavors you could use are endless! I'll definitly make it again. Hmmmmm.......perhaps served with fresh strawberries and champagne!
