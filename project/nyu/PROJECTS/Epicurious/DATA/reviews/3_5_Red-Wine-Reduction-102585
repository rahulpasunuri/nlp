Would agree with others that this reduction was a bit thin, so I too thickened it a bit in the end. Added fresh sprigs of rosemary, which made a fine accompaniment to rosemary grilled steak.

This was so easy to make, you only need time. I made it with a $10 bordeaux and a $7 Ruby port. The only change I made was a few sprigs of thyme and a couple of bay leaves to the veges. This needed salt and pepper but, even though it was quite sweet, I didn't add balsamic vinegar because this reduction accompanied lamb chops and roasted wild mushrooms...the sweetness was the perfect match.

I made this reduction for the first time today and agree about it being a little to thin, I reduced it down to 1 cup and added about 1tsp cornstarch slurry, the result was perfect.

The end result is a bit on the sweet side and thin. Next time, I am going to add some vinegar near the end of the reducing and thicken with a bit of flour or corn starch.

If you want a sweet-hot undertone to this reduction, crack 4 or 5 whole allspice drupes and put them in the liquid to simmer. This works very well with the port. We have some of this on hand most of the time now - it's very versatile.

Hey I used this as a part of a whole meal and got a great job. I cooked it for a try out for a catering position and got the job, everyone complmented the red wine flavor. Chef Chris, Raleigh N.C.

I made this reduction and served it first with steaks. I froze the leftover, and a month later brought it out and served it with a rack of veal. It is wonderful - my husband loved it! So many uses, and since it freezes well, the time needed to make it balances out in the long run.

This site rocks! I've always been interested in cooking. Recently my wife turned me on to Epicurious and I've been a maniac in the kitchen ever since. I got a real kick out of this recipe due to the fact I had no clue what a reduction was let alone had to make one. Thanks Epicurious
