This is a great brownie recipe! I added a bit more preserves to the cherry sauce, just to pump up the cherry flavours that I love. It makes for a beautiful presentation too.

These brownies are deeeelicious and they're easy to store (in the fridge or in the freezer). Dense and delightful. There is really little reason, however, to overdo things with chocolate sauce and cherries unless you're aiming for a chocolate coma. Me, I dusted the tops with a little cocoa and called it a day.

I love this recipe - and improvised quite a bit with great success. Instead of dried cherries - I used a jar of dark morello cherries. Instead of the chocolate chips I chopped up ghiridelli's bittersweet chocolate - The cherries were hard to taste when it was still warm - but the next day - it was super delicious - It was so rich I didn't even bother with the sauce - Got many compliments on the perfect brownie top crust - shiny, thin, golden brown!

This recipe is fabulous! It is quite rich though, so it can serve more than 8.

I didn't make this yet but I URGENTLY wanted to tell the reviewer below that chocolate is toxic to cats and dogs and can cause seizures among other scary symptoms. Lick it off your own toes please!

Unlike the reviewer on 9/19 with the cat/toe fetish, I didn't think this receipe was messy to prepare. Fort Fun had it right, it is a very rich dessert and should be eaten with caution! I softened in the microwave semisweet chocolate chips before I mixed them into the sauce. Also melted the chocolate chips and butter in the microwave rather than cooking in a saucepan for the brownie dough. Nixed the chocolate-dipped cherries, it was good enough without.

This is a very good dessert, but very rich. I would say more of a weekend dessert, rather then a weekday.

This tasted extremely good (and rich also), but the chocolate dripped on my toes when making the recipe. It can be a bit on the messy side during preparation although Sasha my cat didn't mind at all because she was able to lick the splashed chocolate from between my toes as I baked. It tickled.

I made these for Christmas dinner and my family was so impressed. These brownies are so simple to make, yet they taste complicated and downright delicious. Not to mention incredibly rich, small servings with just a touch of chocolate sauce is perfect. Enjoy!

My husband is a chocoholic so this suited him to a "T". I commented that it was very rich and he said, "Yes, but it is really good". I placed the sauce on the plate, the brownie on top, whipped cream (left over from the sauce), more sauce and topped with the dipped cherries. Impressive enough for company if you have folks who like rich desserts!
