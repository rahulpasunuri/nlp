I love panna cotta! Is very easy to prepare and is very tasty. I prefer to use the vanilla seeds instead the extract, and my prefered topping is the caramel: http://www.academiabarilla.com/italian-recipes/desserts-fruits-1/panna-cotta.aspx

If you cannot find half and half, do the half whole milk and half heavy cream. Note: Do not use the melted butter addition, as the butter will rise to the top and solidify--not very appetizing. Perhaps that equivalent works in baking, but not here; it does not stay blended.

Dear Shanghai cook, half and half is a cream substitute for coffee, which can also be used in baking. It is made up of equal parts whole milk and cream. According to food.com, 1 cup milk and 1 tablespoon melted butter may be used as a substitute.

I made this Panna Cotta as a sweet little dessert, and it was loved by my family. Definitely will make it again.

Best basic panna cotta recipe I've tried, although it could use another TB of sugar and I typically reduce the sugar called for in most recipes. But that's a matter of taste and you can adjust. For those experiencing separation issues, with a gelatin layer at the bottom, you may be boiling the cream too much. Also you can simplify how the gelatin is dissolved which can also help. Empty the gelatin into a small bowl, add the water as directed as well as the vanilla extract. Let it sit for about 10 minutes while the gelatin softens. Take the near-boiling cream mixture off the stove. Wait a couple of minutes, then stir in the gelatin. Keep stirring. It will dissolve into the heated cream. This works beautifully for me and there's no need use another pot.

So delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for the following: I put 8 star anise (after reading the reviewer who had anise panna cotta in Italy) in the cream as I heated it, and then removed and rinsed them to use as decoration. I reduced the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and added 2 teaspoons anise extract. Served with a little fig and red wine sauce I whipped up at the last minute (just a dollop on each plate). My family and guests were utterly silent as they worked on their portions with the exception of small grunts of pleasure. A winner, and so easy you could cry.

As the other reviews indicate, this is a very easy recipe that lends itself to variation. I used a vanilla bean (scraped the seeds in the mixture) rather than vanilla extract, and also added 1 tsp. almond extract. Then I served it with diced peaches sauteed with a bit of sugar, white wine and fresh rosemary. Wow!

TRY THIS!! My mom lived in Rome for a few years and we went to a small restaurant walking distance from their home. I had an anise infused panna cotta that blew my mind! I am NOT a huge licorice fan. This recipe is light and elegant and sophisticated with the anise addition. I buy the star anise and soak the cream overnight. I also leave the seed in while cooking. I add one seed per serving. Using the low creme brulee ramekins, the single anise seed 'floats' on top and it is the ultimate sophisticated, palate pleasing dining experience! Enjoy!

"Half and half" is available in American grocery stores. It's approximately half milk and half cream. You can substitute light cream.

Make no mistake, panna cotta is a delivery system for a delicious fruit sauce. I multiplied this recipe by 30 for a restaurant kitchen and was a big hit. Of course, the real star was the sauce we made of strawberries and bananas that we needed to use up. I think a tart berry sauce is best. Side note: if it separates, you're probably not cooling it fast enough.

Made this for company and did not receive any raves. I thought it was just OK and husband thought it was slightly better. It was a hit with the kids as I drizzled melted chocolate over theirs. For the adults I served it with a strawberry/balsamic vinegar compote that was excellent. I like the make ahead and ease factors but need more punch. I don't think I would make it again.

An excellent panna cotta, very light. I served it with a blackberry cassis sauce (puree 6 oz. container blackberries with 2 TB. creme de cassis and 1/4 C. sugar, then strain and discard seeds) and fresh raspberries- raves from dinner guests and can be made day ahead. It did not separate. Everyone wanted the recipe. This made 4 servings. I made exactly as written with no problems as described by others.

When I tried this recipe I found that it separated into a gelatin semi-translucent layer on the bottom (which became to the top when inverted) and an opaque layer on the top. Any suggestions on why this happened and how to prevent this? Thanks

I was inspired by the green tea panna cotta at Zipangu restaurant in Costa Mesa. But, I like my panna cotta like Goldilocks-not too soft and not too hard. I also don't unmold my panna cotta. My tweaks are as follows: used 2 cups whipping cream only, 1 1/2 tsp. gelatin, 1/4 cup sugar, and same amount of vanilla and cold water to dissolve gelatin. It was the perfect amount for four 7 oz. ramekins. It even helps them to set faster, in about 2 to 3 hours. Definitely have to make the dessert on the day it will be served, because the consistency thickens the longer it chills. This goes in my recipe file for a quick and easy dessert!

We just got back from Elba, where we'd had some amazing panna cotta at the Hotel Antares, so we were thrilled to find the recipe with such good reviews. It is a 4-fork recipe for flavour and ease, but the consistency knocked it down to 3-forks overall. As others have noted, it was way too soft to be a real panna cotta experience for us. We will try again this weekend with double the gelatin and see how that works. I did some in glasses, and some in molds -- next time we'll just do molds -- unmolding isn't really that hard (not hard at all) and it makes the dish more authentic and special. We also did some with chopped strawberries and others plain. Both were good. As others noted, when we put the fruit on the bottom, it got mixed through the panna cotta, but it was a good thing -- the strawberry flavour infused the panna cotta, sort of like an strawberries and cream at Wimbeldon, Italian style.

this is the second time i have made this recipe, and it is just a beautiful crowd pleaser. i have to say, i disagree with the recommendation on the 1.5 tbs gelatin. perhaps if you *only* have 4 hours for your panna cotta to set up, this is a good option. i uninentionally made this dessert a day ahead of time and have to say that it was a little more flan like than i like my panna cotta (love this recipe for the silky, creamy texture you should get)

Great recipe. I made this for the 4th of July and added blueberries and raspberries. I substituted 1/2 cup sour cream for 1/2 cup of the milk. I also added 1 tsp orange flower water.

Easy, fast, and never fails to impress. We add the conents of a fresh vanilla bean to the recipe, and even though all the seeds sink to the bottom (like in a Creme brulee) and it adds a lot of flavor and a bit of style points. I have cheated and used 1c of milk instead of the half/half and it only subtracts a little of the richness but also cuts the fat by a lot.

Absolutely delicious! I was thinking about making the recipe for a group of friends but decided I should try out the recipe before bring it. My parents and I devoured them! I made mine with a rasberry sauce, which I put in the bottom of martini glasses. Then I put the panna cotta on top and chilled. When ready to eat, I garmished with a few fresh whole raspberries. Beautiful presentation and tastes unbelievably good!

I made this for a Halloween party, and it was lovely. One guest licked his plate. I followed the recipe exactly, but poured them into skull-shaped muffin tins for effect. I made a blackberry sauce with some port, and put the panna cottas over this on the plates. I used raisinettes to make skull eyes and chocolate sprinkles for teeth. They looked so great! Would definitely make again because they taste very sophisticated and unexpected, but are a snap to make. I might increase the gelatin by half next time, as they were a tiny bit soft.

Still my favorite Panna Cotta recipe on Epicurious. The dessert looks impressive, because it is not something you see often, and is exceptionally easy to make, and can be made way in advance. My family likes it when I add a few fresh rasberries into the ramekins, they taste fantastic and look lovely. As a note on preparation, I have found that often the panna cotta takes a long time to set, and it is much better when you take the time to make it the day before. 4 hours is definately NOT enough time to set. Also, I sometimes use 1 1/2 - 2 times as much gelatin, again to ensure that the panna cotta is firm.

I almost didn't make this dish because the ingredients didn't look like it would amount to much taste. I was wrong. Four forks for taste, ease of preparation, and being able to make a standout dessert without turning on my oven. I also made a drizzling sauce by mixing pureed Mango Sauce (from Trader Joes), passion fruit juice to water it down and for a citrus taste, a splash of white balsamic vinegar for a little tang and sprinkle of sugar to balance the mix. The sweet-sour sauce complimented the smooth panna cotta. An easy make ahead dessert to impress guests!

This dessert sent me and my dinner guests over the edge. Deceptively simple to make yet incredibly tasty for the little effort. I layered with fresh blueberries and used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 which had no noticeable effect on the taste. Topped it off with a fresh strawberry compote. I used 4 parfait glasses which held 2 servings and this amount for each person was almost too much. I will use smaller serving glasses/bowls next time.

Yummmm! So simple and so tasty. I used agar flakes in place of gelatin (have to still perfect the use of agar). The dish still set beautifully and it was a hit with my family and friends.

This was delicious and a big hit at my dinner party. From the suggestion of other readers I served it in cocktail glasses for fab presentation and no unmoulding. I put some rasberries with sugar as a sauce in the base of the glass before pouring in the panna cotta. I learnt after the first one when the rasberries mixed in with the panna cotta to pour really slowly and carefully, like layering shots! Then after the panna cotta was set I decided I'd like to add some visual interest to the top of it and mixed some dark chocolate with heaps of cream till it was nice and smooth, poured it into a glad bag and snipped the top, then piped lines back and forth accross the glasses, like lattice, then back into the fridge to cool. It looked great and I will definitely make it again. I love that it is 100% make in advance and so stunning to look at with a few additions. I don't think I'd make it on it's own without a sauce or accompaniement though - it's not bland but it does need something. BTW I'm in Australia and for the half and half I used half full cream milk, halfthin cream, and for the heavy cream I used what is called here double thick cream.

Note to the cook in London, UK: Half and half in the US is a 50/50 mixture of whole milk and light cream. It can't be whipped but it's great in coffee (or when used to make ice cream). It sounds like your end results were wonderful, so remember what you used for the next time. Hope this was helpful.

I searched a lot of recipes and tried a few, however this is a brilliant recipe and it works out perfectly. For those of you in London. Double cream is best, you need to use cream which is so thick you have to spoon it out of the container. Also I assumed, and I think I assumed correctly, half and half means, one cup of half double cream and normal cream. I served with Rasperry Coulis and made chocolate love hearts with a piping bag. Very nice indeed!

Can we award five forks? GREAT DESSERT!!!! Light, elegant, easy to make, and can be prepared well in advance -- so it's perfect for both casual and formal entertaining. Here's what I did, some by mistake, but it turned out quite well. Afer adding the vanilla, I VERY CAREFULLY placed the pot in an ice water bath (primarily because it was 1AM and I didn't want to stay up until it came to room temperature.) The bath cooled the custard very quickly as I stirred it. I then poured the mixture into eight, footed, dessert dishes (I doubled the recipe.) I had placed raspberries and blueberries in them, planning for the fruit to be on the bottom. Didn't work; they mixed in with the panna cotta. However, it turned out for the best because the fruit was evenly mixed with the custard and alot more enjoyable. This is certainly a make again, and again, and again.

Great basic recipe. My garden is overflowing with mint. I infused the cream with mint (put about 1/2 cup chopped mint in cream, brought to boil, let sit 5 minutes, strained solids), then continued with combining my mint-cream mixture with the half-and-half and sugar. I think you could do this with any flavor you like (ginger? lemon? coffee?). Texture, taste was wonderful.

To the cook who asked about agar instead of gelatin: I haven't tried it with this recipe but I've made the buttermilk panna cotta with sweetened strawberries (also on this site) using agar and after quite a few tries, it turned out great. Check out the review I wrote for that one. Agar seems to work completely differently depending on ingredients and amounts so you'll probably have to do some experimenting to get it right for other recipes.
