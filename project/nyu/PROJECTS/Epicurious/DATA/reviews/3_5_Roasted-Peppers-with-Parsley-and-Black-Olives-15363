Roasted red peppers are a mainstay in my second-generation Italian kitchen. Roasted peppers freeze well, and thaw with only a bit of extra liquid (use it in your recipe too). Top or add to spaghetti sauce, chile, vegetables, soup, salad, eggs, baked potatoes, broiled fish, plain pasta, and my favorite Italian treat - rustic bread slices drizzled with olive oil, sandwiching sauteed vegetables and basil, with a topping of fresh spinach and roasted red bell peppers.

this dish energizes me, especially good with some fresh pane as an intermezzo
