This compote is easy to make but too sweet and not very intriguing. To give it more of an edge, maybe it would help to use more brandy and less or no apple juice.

Very easy and very good. I made this for a Christmas Eve day brunch. It was wonderful with bacon-wrapped quail and cheese grits. I will definitely make it again next time we grill pork. I doubled the recipe and used one bag of mixed dried fruit, half a bag of dried apple, then threw in some dried cranberries and figs. The figs were a hit -- I will add more next time.

Very, very good and super easy when you purchase a bag of dried fruit. Enjoy!

I absolutely love this! It is wonderful. I usually serve it with grilled pepper crusted pork tenderloin and pecan pilaf. It is very simple if you buy a bag of dried mixed fruit and just chop it up. I use 2 T. brandy and think I might try brown sugar next time I make it. You must try this!

Excellent! We used dried apples and more apricots and eliminated the prunes.
