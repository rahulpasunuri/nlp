I love Epicurious! I have been a subscriber to Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines for years as well as a big fan of the Epicurious website. I love your recipes because they are rated and usually fail-safe. I have used many of your 4 fork recipes for entertaining and family dinners, consistently to rave reviews. So when your 4 fork recipe book came out, I scooped it up right away. I have been making a few recipes from the book and I have to say that I am surprised and disappointed at some of the recipe selections. Canned pasta sauce, really Epicurious? I made the turkey jambalaya last night and had to come on the site to see if it really made the 4 fork cut. At only 3 1/2 forks with reviews all suggesting changes to improve this recipe, I don't think that it should have been featured in a 4 fork recipe book. I am feeling a bit duped and will proceed with caution before making any of the other recipes featured in the book.

This is a fairly easy dish to make and delicious! My brother and I wanted to make it healthier, so we used brown rice, and 3 lbs of sliced chicken breast. I would personally recommend adding more veggie then was the recipe calls for.

Excellent. I had a couple of extra sweet Italian sausages which I threw in, and I also upped the garlic. A good (and fairly frugal) choice for leftovers

Very good. I threw in a half teaspoon of liquid crab boil at the end. Excellent.

You've got to tweak this a bit to make it four forks... I substituted a brown/wild rice blend, fire-roasted tomatoes and sriracha, while adding a red pepper and kielbasa. Really satisfying and tasty.

Looking for a recipe for leftovers, I made this with non-smoked turkey. I cooked brown rice first since it takes longer to cook at my high elevation. With the onion mix, I added chopped carrots. I used fire-roasted tomatoes. When adding the turkey, I combined a package of Trader Joe's prepared mussels in butter sauce and about a dozen raw jumbo prawns. The cayenne I omitted on the dish but added to my plate individually.

I used smoked chipotle chicken sausage for a super easy turkey substitute. Also, I added a can of black beans, drained. It makes a really easy and healthy comfort meal.

A one-pot dinner that was a big hit in our house and a snap to put together. What more can you ask for on a Monday night? Unfortunately, I picked a grocer who did not have smoked turkey drumsticks. I substituted smoked pork chops, which was very yummy. Can't wait to try this again with smoked turkey

Oh yeah, I used more garlic too!

This was delicious! I made it for myself, my husband and my sister and we all loved it. My husband doesn't eat red meat so I am always looking for good recipes for poultry. I followed the recipe as written except I used short grain brown rice instead of white rice. Very, very tasty!

To answer the question about how much turkey, I would guess it would be the same as the smoked ham alternitive of a pound and a half. This is pretty simple to make, although we like it a bit spicy. This is a good base recipe to add what you like to.

If I could see the recipe it would be great but I cant access it or any of the others. This is the third or fourth week that this has happened

Is that 2 and 3/4 lbs. of drumsticks or two 3/4-lb. drumsticks?

Do you mean porcini mushrooms?

I find that you can make your own turkey stock. A little dried puccini mushroom will deepen the smoky flavor of the stock.
