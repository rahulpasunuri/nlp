This was very good (although I made some changes). I used 2% milk and added cornstarch and a touch of parm cheese. It still turned out creamy and rich. I love it when recipes can be adapted to low fat and still turn out great!

The was an easy, tasty and quick dinner recipe. I used tortellini instead of torteloni, as that is all that was available at the grocery store. After reading the reviews, I followed a couple of the suggestions. 1st- I used only one package of pasta for the amount of sauce called for in the recipe. That was a great suggestion. 2nd- I added the wine, brought the mixture to a boil and reduced by half, then I added the cream and simmered about 5 minutes to thicken. Again that was a great suggestion. 3rd- I added more fresh sage. This recipe was so easy and yet was so very tasty, it is now in my keeper file. I highly suggest this recipe to everyone.

Oh gosh, this was good and soo easy! I think the amount of vermouth called for is correct - you just need to boil it down a little longer. I think you need to double the amount of sage in order for the flavor to come through. I have made this a few times and think it's best with half of the pasta called for, otherwise the sauce seems a bit scant. Worked beautifully with both pumpkin ravioli and roasted squash tortelloni. I topped each serving off with a dusting of chopped candy spiced pecans...yum!

This was great. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I accidentally added more cream than called for, and it turned out really well. Really good tortelloni make a great difference.

Quite good. I added some diced cooked chicken as well. Didn't feel the vermouth amount was too much - just boiled it down.

I would have liked to have given this 4 folks but the ingredient amount for the vermouth/white wine has to be wrong. Because previous reviewers had said they decreased the vermouth/wine by half I also did that and it was still too much. Next time I would only use 1/2 cup of liquid to add to the cream. I would make this again also adding more sage.

Delicious and easy to make. I used pumpkin tortelloni which is just a little sweet and went really well with the sauce. Also, I used a lot more sage than called for and less wine (just under one cup). Fabulous!

Very good quick weeknight dinner. I cut the recipe in half, used a medley of mushrooms and added extra sage throughout the cooking process. Used a good vermouth which was worth the extra cost. Served with porcini linguine which added earthiness to it. I only sprinkled a little parmesan on top when serving.

I forgot to mention that I used less wine than called for (about 3/4 the amount)

This sauce was delicious. It was so easy, but it tasted like something I would get at a restaraunt. I used significantly more sage, a random assortment of mushrooms, and added a touch of parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce (although I may not add it next time because the flavor was better before the cheese was added). Make sure to use a high quality tortellini because it makes a difference.

This recipe worked really well with about half of the wine recommended. I used fresh spinach raviolis. The flavor was amazing. Such a delicious and lucious dish!

I could not get the sauce to thicken, so I added some grated parmesan as another reviewer suggested. When I tasted it later, I think the flavor of the cheese clashed with the other flavors. Also, the mushrooms made the sauce into a browish color that reminded me of dirt (sorry). I'm surprised by all the rave reviews. It was easy enough to throw together, but had rather ordinary taste, and wasn't very attractive on the plate.

I thought this was a great, easy recipe -- served it to several friends and everyone cleaned their plates. I doubled the sage, and used high-quality, fresh tortellini which probably made a big difference. It was a hit!

This is not bad-just nothing special.

This was delicious. I doubled the sage as suggested by other reviewers. I also accidentally used sweet vermouth, and it was delicious.

This was great--fast and tasty and warming on a cold winter night. I used baby bellas for the mushrooms and pumpkin tortelloni: the savory-ness worked well with the cream sauce. I also used a lot more sage than called for. Very nice!

I substituted diced baby bellas for the shiitake mushrooms and added some freshly grated parmesan to the sauce mix. It was excellent! I served it over homemade cheese ravioli and sprinkled shaved parm on top--my family loved it!

Excellent flavor! Plus it's simple and quick to make. I doubled the sage and it was perfect. Next time I may double the sauce recipe.

Being a die-hard meat eater, I threw some bacon in while the mushrooms and shallots were sautéing. I also threw a portabella mushroom into the mix. The pasta came out absolutely wonderful!! If you are a sage lover and decide to put any kind of meat in, be sure to add a lot of sage. I doubled the amount the recipe calls for, but even then it was heavily masked by the bacon. I will definitely make this again!

I didn't like the sauce - too much wine, too little sage. I'd try a different mushroom next time - I'm not crazy about shiitake. Overall I found the recipe so-so.

Rating: 3
I agree with the other reviewer that it wasn't "sagey" enough. I'll try it again and kick the sage up a notch. I also sauteed some chicken strips as a topper for those at my gathering who wanted something non-vegetarian.

This recipe is good, and it's very easy. The store didn't have fresh shiitake mushrooms, so I reconstituted dried shiitakes. My only complaint is that it wasn't "sagey" enough. I would maybe double the amount of fresh sage.

Great weeknight meal - easy and quick to prepare which is important if you have an infant in the house!

This is quick and yet sophisticated. We served new, thin asparagus spears alongside, and got great feedback.

This was so good!! I made mine with home made noodles and put sage in them. Then I just used white sliced mushrooms and a Chardonnay. I cooked the sauce for at least 20 minutes and it never 'thickened'. I added some garlic,Parmigano, and Parmesean chesse at the end. It tossed nicely with the pasta. Everyone loved it! Husband even ate left overs--rare!
