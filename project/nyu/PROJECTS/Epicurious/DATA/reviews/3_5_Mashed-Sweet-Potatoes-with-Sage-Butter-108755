This turned out delicious, so delicious I made it again the next day, because there weren't any leftovers to accompany the turkey. I added a bit of liquid cream to the potatoes with just a bit of the potato water (didn't use all the reserve water noted in recipe) So easy and quick to make. Will make again for sure.

Sage and sweet potatoes is a nice combo of flavors. I will say that I adjusted the recipe similar to another reviewer - first I browned the butter and then added a little chopped garlic and the sage to the butter just at the end of browning. Then I mixed the butter in with the roasted, mashed sweet potatoes and some salt and pepper. Delicious. Great alternative to regular mashed potatoes.

This was a delicious departure from the traditionally sugary sweet potato recipes! I sauteed the sage and also a minced garlic clove in the butter before adding to the potatoes. I also added a little bit of milk for creaminess. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was absolutely delicious in its simplicity. There are not many savory sweet potato recipes, and this one really highlighted the natural flavors of sweet potatoes with just a hint of sage. The butter added a creamy richness without being too heavy. We had these with goose - a perfect pairing.

Awesome. I baked the potatoes (since I had a chicken on the rotisserie) and used milk in addition to the butter to add some liquids back. I added some garlic, and let it steep in the milk / butter together with the sage for a while. Delicious! Will make it on Thanksgiving!

Very good. I served it with the dill meatloaf and it was a delicious combination.

So simple and so delicious. Who would have known - and there I was always baking, roasting, or making pies from my sweet potatoes. Instead of mashing with the water I added a dolllop of homemade creme fraiche (the Mexican-style crema). Served with a Sinaloa-style chicken marinated in a mixture of ground onion, garlic, spices, and orange juice.

EXCELLENT! Served this at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from everyone! I added in a bit extra sage.

I use half yams and half sweet potatoes. We love this, easy to make, and lots of leftovers for two! Next time, I will try omitting the mashing with potato water, and use can milk!

I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Planning on year two for this recipe in 2004.

I found this to be really good as a bed for a simple grilled halibut. I cut back on the butter and added a bit of heavy cream to make the puree extra creamy and rich.

I would give this a 3.5 if I had the choice -- it is SO good. I prefer to slowly brown the butter and whole sage leaves in a sauce pan (allowing plenty of time to infuse the aroma and flavor of the sage with the butter), remove the leaves themselves, THEN add to the potatoes. This has been a hit with everyone!

I love this recipe but find the sage a little overpowering. I've tried it with a few different herbs and have found that fresh parsley is complementary to the sweet potatoes.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner with my family. Everyone was unsure how the sweet potatoes would taste but were all pleasantly surprised at how good they were. This is probably not a side I would make for a weekday meal, but I will definitely make again for a special occasion.

This was an easy recipe with just the right amount of sweet and spice. It was refreshing to not make sweet potatos with the same brown sugar very sweet flavor as usually called for.

I found the sage in this recipe to be overpowering, it over shadowed the sweet potatoes. I toned it down with some extra potatoes but still found it unappealing.

Sorry, but this was very bland. Didn't like the sage in it. Didn't find the spices to be a very good blend for a pleasant flavour. Sweet potato fries with garlic and herbs are a much better recipe. This was worth a try though.

I'm one of those people who likes really sweet sweet potatoes. But this recipe was awesome. I missed the part about the cooking water, and just mashed them with the butter and sage. The sage complemented the sweet potato so well, i was pleasantly surprised. And it was very easy.

FYI, to cook in NY. True yams are tropical and are not usually available in the US, maybe at an international grocery store. The title of "yam" was used as a marketing tool in the past, and the practice continues today. Canned and frozen "yams" are sweet potatoes with added sugar.

Yummy, if you like sweet potatoes. I did modify the recipe, adding a bit more butter (European unsalted), plus whole milk instead of reserved potato water. I also used plenty of coarse kosher salt, which tastes much better than regular table salt for some reason. Lots of fresh ground pepper too. I do not agree with another reviewer that this recipe needs sugar - unless you are used to your sweet potatoes being really sweet. If so, skip this recipe and make candied yams.

This recipe was BLAND!! In order to make this dish my husband raved about, I sauteed diced garlic, mashed the potatoes in the same pan, added maple syrup until it tasted right, and then mashed in the butter and sage. Next time, I will try yams, b/c yams are sweeter, and may be delicious with just the addition of sage and butter.

I loved this sweet potato recipe. I never would have thought the savory sage would go so well with the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes.

I tried it the next time with normal salted table butter and all liked it more. Can we twist it some more and make it slightly more garlicy?

It was easy enough but it needed to be either sweeter or saltier. I added salt. While we didn't hate it, there are many better uses for sweet potatoes.
