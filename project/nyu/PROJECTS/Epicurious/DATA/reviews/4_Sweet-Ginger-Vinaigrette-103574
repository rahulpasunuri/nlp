Very tasty, a little goes a long way, (very strong in flavor) also BUY A LARGE PIECE OF GINGER ROOT it takes a lot to get a 1/2 cup of grated ginger.

I did not make this, but while making another ginger sauce I found An easier way to get the ginger juice. Take about a 4 inch piece, peel and put into food processor. When pulverized, put into a paper towel and squeeze out the juice. you will be amazed at how much you will get...This is also good with some soy sauce and a little sugar as an additional sauce.

This vinegarette was delicious. I modified the recipe and didn't sqeeze the ginger in order to get ginger juice; instead I just soaked a couple large hunks of ginger in the balsamic vinegar.
