it's funny that I seem to be the only person who uses epicurious who knows anyone who is completely lost in the kitchen...My husband would actually need a recipe as simple as this one. I appreciate that Epicurious recognizes the fact that it has a wide range of users. Cooks at both ends of the spectrum should be able to find recipes to suit their skill levels.

What a great recipe!! Tried it on the whole familiy and they were impressed at my new found culinary skills. No doubt, will make again. Going to try just a little less butter next time, maybe a tad more water too. Smiles :-)

Why in the world would you need a recipe for this.... What's next, toast? Boiled water?
