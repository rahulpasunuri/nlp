Have been making this for several years when we want something different for breakfast.Overnight guests ask for the recipe.Proportions are to taste.With sweet fruit,as little as 2 tsp honey per serving is enough.We prefer it with room-temperature fruit & our homemade granola.It's really the crystallized ginger that makes this a recipe worth listing.Otherwise,it's just granola with yogurt and fruit.

I needed a fruit side dish for Easter brunch, and used this as inspiration. If youre easily offended by reviewers who dont follow a recipe exactly - you know who you are! - stop reading now. I stirred honey and candied ginger into low-fat plain yogurt, so that my ginger-averse diners (they're out there) could still enjoy the fruit. I didn't really measure anything, as this is one of those forgiving, add-to-taste recipes. I put the fruit and yogurt out in separate serving bowls, and the combination was fabulously popular. We discovered it made an incredible topping for Belgian waffles! The yogurt sauce would also make a great fruit dip for appetizers or a buffet. Someday I may even add granola to the whole thing.

Excellent! The ginger makes such a difference! I served this with a sandwich for a ladies' lunch.

This is a nice low fat way to start the day. However, I think you have to enjoy ginger to really like this dish. My husband and I agreed it would be better off without the crystallized ginger.

Absolutely amazing! This dish has become a summer staple in our household. It is divine with stone fruit, especially white peaches. I'll sometimes add homemade ginger syrup to increase the ginger flavor, but it tastes fine with just the crystallized ginger. A must-try for anyone looking for something slightly different and refreshing.

Omitting the granola made for a great breakfast "starter". The crystallized ginger works very well with the fruits and adds an exotic note to breakfast.

Obviously a great food. Not every recipe has to be complex - especially for those of us new to cooking who use the site to get ideas about good things to eat and/or cook.

I've done this with various fruits for a while but the addition of the crystallized ginger really makes it sing. For me, this also makes a great breakfast. If you can't find the Greek yogurt (my favorite is Fage), you can strain regular yogurt over night.
