This was delicious! Perfect on a hot summer night when it's just too hot to cook. I didn't have pineapple or shiso leaves and it still came out tasty. I made it into summer rolls instead of a salad as I had rice wrappers in the pantry. Next time i might make a peanut sauce to go with it.

had a hankerin' for made at home vietnamese food (lots of thai basil growing in the garden) and this recipe seemed perfect ~ at first glance my husband thought it quite a lot of prep, but once finished, he couldn't stop raving about it... the "salad" turned into an actual salad as i couldn't find any butter lettuce, and we used the dipping sauce as a dressing... i didn't want this dish to end

This was just delicious. The pork was perfect. The dipping sauce was very tasty. I did replace the chiles with almost a tbsp of garlic chile sauce. I added the sugar in 1/2 tsp increments to taste and it was about 2 1/2 tsp in the end. Used mango instead of pineapple and no cilantro (family dislike) or shiso leaves (couldn't find them). Rave reviews from entire family including my Mom who is an amazing cook. I also made a peanut sauce to go with it from the Herb Salad Spring Rolls with Spicy Peanut Sauce on this site.

GREAT GREAT recipe, the only thing I changed was the dipping sauce. It was too fishy. I used the Nuoc Cham sauce in this website as well.

the flavors were out of this world! i marinated a pork loin (instead of pork chops) for 2 days and it was flavorful and juicy. i left out the bean sprouts, shiso leaves and the vermicelli noodles and substituted raw red cabbage for the cucumber for some crunch. the flavors seemed to intensify as we ate leftovers for the next couple of days.

Absolutely amazing but it made way too much!!!!! Use half of the noodles, pork, herbs, pineapple, and bean sprouts!!!!!!

Amazing flavour and pretty easy to make. Everyone raved about them. The prep is a little time consuming however it is perfect for a dinner party because you can do 95% of the work before anyone arrives. I couldn't find the shiso leaves so I didn't use them, and I substituted mango for the pinapple since a pinapple was $7, and the mangoes $0.99. Everything else I did by the book. Delicious.

Tasty and refreshing dish! Didn't make the noodles, but we didn't miss them... Great flavor combination!

Delicious! The sauce is amazing. Really complex flavors, sweet start and warm finish. One prep change - I used 1T chili-garlic in the dipping sauce instead of the chilis. My lettuce leaves were too small for good wrapping, but the sushi wrappers I happened to have (go figure!) worked perfectly.

This is delicious and the closest recipe I can find to our local Vietnamese cafe. We marinate a little longer and grill it on a high heat on the bbq - til some of the sugar caramelises.

This is a regular in my house. Just a fantastic recipe that is also pretty healthy. I use the leftovers to make a super yummy salad the next day!

This is awesome! I used shredded purple cabbage instead of the butter lettuce and tossed all the vegetables together with the sauce. Very refreshing meal, perfect for summer!

This is the second time I make this fabulous meal -- this time for company. Everyone raved. It is light, flavourful, and zesty. The pineapple gives it an interesting twist. The herbs are a must and the dipping sauce is almost addictive.

This was a great way to make pork. I only made the dipping sauce and pork marinade, not the salad and noodles. We ate it with rice and it was delicious. The sauce was really the key. The pork had flavor after marinating for 2 hours. I grilled it in the oven on broil, using a grilling pan but I did grill it a bit too long. Even though it was dry it still tasted delicious. Will definitely make it again.

The dipping sauce is great! I substituted 1 TBS Chili-Garlic Sauce (Vietnamese, Huy Fong foods) for the chili peppers and it tastes amazing!

Was quite delicious. I actually wrapped all the goodies in tapioca spring roll papers, which was yummy and held together well! Also added some shredded cabbage and daikon radish for a little spice (and to accomodate what I had o hand!) Agree with others the herbs are essential.

This was great, and a lot of fun. I'll certainly make it again for a party. As given, the recipe makes a lot of food. I served it to three people, and we ate less than half of it.

I made the pork as written and just used what else we had that sounded good--carrots, cucumbers, peanuts, rice stick noodles, basil and cilantro. We used red leaf lettuce as the wrap cuz that's what was in the fridge. It was delicious. Even my children ages 6 and 8 loved this, making their own "Vientnamese Tacos" with the ingredients they liked. The dipping sauce was also yummy. This is a keeper.

I haven't tried this yet, but my research today shows that shiso leaves are used as a substitute for sweet basil in Japanese cooking. So just use regular basil! I have grown my own Thai basil this year and it has a nice spicy bite to it. It's nearly impossible to find in any grocery store, no matter how big they are.

I usualy purchase shiso leaves at a local asian market; however, this summer I purchased shiso seeds at the same market and now have a huge crop of leaves in my garden ready to enjoy!

Perfect summer time fare! Be sure to grill your meat, the flavors and textures are a key part of this "wrap". Don't skip the fresh herbs, however the other vegetables can be substituted if you can't get what is called for (I had to use red leaf lettuce and few other minor substitutes). The whole meal is delicious, but slightly messy. Don't make this one if you are trying to impress your guests with your manners... I will make this again for sure!

You can purchase many of these exotic ingredients at the templeofthai.com; the shiso leaves may be available via mail order at katagiri.com, also shipping from NYC (making them good sources if you live anywhere on the East coast esp. for fresh items). Good quality fish sauce is the key to this recipe! The fresh herbs you can substitute as the cook from White Plains says, esp in the summer, visit the farmers markets! But shiso leaves are beautiful if you can find them.

Don't worry about Shiso leaves! Cooking is about having fun and being creative! Just use the mint and leave them out! Also, substitute Serrano or Jalepeno peppers for the Thai chilis. And use Italian basil for the Thai basil, just a little less as it is stronger than Thai basil! Have fun and good luck!

In my experience, shiso leaves are used in Sushi rolls, usually as the outside, similar to the lettuce leaf for the wrap in this recipe. They have a fresh,earthy, nearly mint flavor.

this sounds amazing, but what are shiso leaves and where do you get them?

I made a couple of changes. I am a vegetarian so I used tempeh (a soy product) and marinated it in a similar marinade, then fried it up. Also added thinly sliced red bell pepper to the veggie plate. Really good meal on a hot night. Mmmmm.

Made it exactly as written and loved it! The pineapple was a great addition.
