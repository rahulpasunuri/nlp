I made these last week for our fourth of July celebration. The process was easy, time consuming but easy. I follwed the receipe exactly(doubling it) and it was quite tasty. I do think the process of frying the eggplant made the dish too oily. In the future I will make this again but I will either roast or grill the eggplant. If you do fry the eggplant make sure to drain it very well. My guests loved it! I had some left over and it was excellent the next day too.
