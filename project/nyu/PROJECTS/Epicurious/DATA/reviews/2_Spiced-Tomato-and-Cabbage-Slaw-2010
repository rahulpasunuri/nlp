The seasonings and vinegar overpowered the tastes of the other ingredients. Ended up trying to make it edible by blotting it on paper towels. Not good!

This has been my preferred cole slaw recipe for years; I like the juicy tomatoes w/ the cruchy cabbage. You can adjust the spices to taste, but do not use purple cabbage for part of the green or else the whole thing will turn an odd pink color.
