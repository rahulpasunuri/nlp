When I went to my grocery store, the meat department employee told me that he never has 5 pounds of neck beef bones in the store. He suggested that I substitute 6 cups of low sodium beef broth. I found a brand that is 50% less sodium, so I decided to use his suggestion. I sauteed the onions for about 25 minutes then added the broth, 1 1/2 bottles of wine, ground cloves and tomato. Once it got to 2 cups (and it did take almost 4 hrs), I had to put in a peeled and sliced potato to try to reduce the salt content(probably salt from the broth). The reduced wine sauce is absolutely wonderful. It is a day's work, but it's a great accompaniment to the mushrooms.

Fabulous accompaniment to beef (for meat eaters) or polenta (for the veggie types). It was first published as part of a menu that includes a rib roast, but I like to serve it with oven roasted beef tenderloin. It is a cinch to slice and serve quickly.
