The filling for this bar was pretty tasty--like a maple flavored pecan pie. But the crust was fairly gross--I found it dry and too sugary. I would just make a normal shortbread crust with butter, flour and sugar rather than the egg. These bar cookies really only kept for about 2 days before they became totally dried out. Not worth it--easy to make and not too time-consuming but just not amazing.

Just had to add to the chorus...this is YUMMY! My husband couldn't stop eating them, er, "straightening out the sides". They're pretty much just as I'd imagined them--sticky, sweet, maple-y goodness. Delicious with a cup of coffee.

This is SOOO good. I hate to fuss around too much with recipes and this one really satisfied on all levels; it was easy, looked great (I added chopped dried cranberries to the filling for colour/flavour), was a bit different than the standard fare, and tasted delicious! Yum!!!

I cook in a retirement home in Newburry Vermont and the residents could not stop talking about how much they enjoyed these bars and want me to be sure and make them as often as possible.

The taste is exceptional. I used pecans only, (I find the taste of walnuts a bit bitter) and they married beautifully with the maple syrup and the shortbread base. The only flaw was that I couldn't serve the very center because the base was too mushy from the maple syrup. I think next time I'm going to make the base completely level, as opposed to raising the sides so I can cook it longer.

Yummy, sticky, delicious! Reminiscent of pecan pie. I used a 9" round cake pan to bake these in with no ill effects (besides strangely shaped pieces).
