Used pork loin instead of chops. After brining seasoned with Penzeys Bavarian seasoning and then browned in oil and baked. Served with Wild Rice and Jasmine Rice Pilaf, everyone went home with both of the recipes. A dinner to remember and surprised the pork recipe was from Sandy D'Amato from my home city.

This was lovely. Like others I used a small pork loin roast, pan seared the fatty top, turned it over and splashed some white wine in the pan, then finished it in a 350 degree oven until done. I also added some sliced fennel to the apple mixture. Served the pork slices on a bed of the leeks, with the apples and fennel over top, and garnished with some feathery fennel fronds. I bet you could also add a few dried cranberries to the apple and fennel mixture for some more color in the presentation.

My pork chops turned out dry, despite the brining. I was surprised and disappointed. Not sure what I did wrong.

Ever since I learned to brine pork chops there was no looking back! The cider in this brine is brilliant. The only swap was golden delicious for the Granny Smith apples - otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was a lovely balance of savory and rich, sweet and salty. Deeeelicious!

Rating: 4
Gave the apples more concentrated flavor by letting the cooking liquid reduce to a nice glaze; will probably add a little allspice next time. My bone-in pork chops were very thick and took a wee bit more time on the grill. Will definately do this one again.

I made this recipe in December and substituted the whipping cream with eggnog (what I had in the fridge) and it could not have turned out better! The eggnog complimented the pork and apples very well. Loved by all.

I've made this a bunch of times. I actually find using tenderloins, pan roasting them, cutting them into 3/4 inch medallions, placing them on the creamed leaks, and then topping them with the apples is my favorite way to serve this dish to a large group. This is an impressive and easy dish to make if you are a new to throwing a dinner party. You can make the leeks the day before and even make the apples in the crock pot if you want.

I made this using most of "A cook from Vancouvers" suggestions and tweaked it just a tad further. I started out by searing the chops in a heavy cast iron skillet, then finishing them for 20 minutes in a 350 oven. I then added a half cup dry white wine to the skillet and scraped up all the nice brown bits while boiling the wine down, added 2 tbsp of butter and did the leeks in the same skillet. I did not use the thyme on the apples, I thought it may be a bit pervasive for the delicate flavour of the leeks. Doing the chops first, then the leeks and the apples in a separate pan made it all come ready at the same time and it was fabulous, a top end restaurant quality chop. Even my two teenaged boys raved (and ate every morsel).

This is delicious! I had seen this online and saved it to my recipe box for future reference. It wasn't until I came across it again in the Bon Appetit cookbook that I actually tried the recipe. No wonder I saved it! It's fabulous. The pork is moist and tender after the overnight brining and the combination of flavors created by the leeks and apples is wonderful. It makes a beautiful presentation on the plate as well. I'm already planning the dinner party where I will serve this -- there are enough "do ahead" steps to make this perfect for entertaining. I did substitute brown sugar for white as suggested by another reviewer and thinned the creamed leeks with half and half rather than water when rewarming.

I loved this. I got it from the Bon Appetit Cookbook and just made this last Saturday after spending the day at a country fair and apple picking. Usually I end up changing a recipe quite a bit but this one I didn't and it turned out great. Just a few small exchanges because of what I had available -- paired it with butternut squash and a simple salad. And of course lots of wine!

This dish was surprising sweet but very good. The leeks helped to balance the sweetness.

Seriously good. I used spiced cider and ground allspice (all I could find) and the meat would have been great on it's own after brining from morning to dinner. I was very skeptical of the creamed leeks, but eaten all together the flavors here really standout and comliment each other. Add a nice Riesling and you've got a great meal for guests.

A cut-above pork chop dish with nice presentation and great flavours...after some tweaking. Suspecting the leeks and apples could use a little perking up, and after reading numerous reviews, I did make a few changes. Leeks: added 3 cloves minced garlic and a generous amount of salt/pepper, simmered with 2/3 cup chicken stock, stirred in 1/3 cup cream near the end of cooking...rich/creamy enough and far from bland. Apples: used Golden Delicious, sprinkled with dark brown sugar rather than white, added 1 tablespoon fresh thyme and reduced cooking time to a total of 15 minutes...yummy and held their shape. Chops: I quickly seared/browned in butter/olive oil, added a splash of cider to the skillet, covered and finished cooking in 350 degree oven...moist, tender and flavourful. With these few simple changes, this was a deliciously different and pleasing autumn entree that I will enjoy making again and again.

Rating: 2
Perhaps it is "today's lean pork" or that apple cider only comes pasteurized now, but the marinade/brine for these chops didn't do much flavor-wise. I did not make the leeks and apples because they didn't offer much nutritionally--one really can't use all that cream if you're trying to stay healthy and slim past a certain age. I've come to realize that I enjoy using dry rubs on pork chops..."marinate" them in the refrigerator overnight and the salt content has the same effect as a brine plus a fabulous crust forms giving more flavor to 'the other white meat'.

I made this in a driving snowstorm while at a tailgate party two years ago and just came back here to find the lost recipe; it was kind of surreal straining to see the pan with all the steam and snow, but no more surreal than the 'tuck' rule and avenging Ben Dreith!!

This was easy and delish!! I made it for 8 people + a side of sauerkraut and garnish of pickled egg and parsley for Octoberfest. Beautiful. we grilled the chops just before guest arrived and kept them warm in a slow oven. I had the onion and apples done in small frying pans and just heated them up. Forgot the liquor and used a sweet onion instead of expensive leeks but still good.They ate like pigs.

very good, very easy recipe, I did not have enough apple cider, so I used a little bit of the sparkling apple cider and no allspice either but still it was excellent, my kids loved the apples and the leeks, very delicate flavor!

Rating: 4
I first made this back when it (the recipe)came out, and it is a favorite with my family and friends. We really like the leeks, but the cream is so heavy, so I just caramelize some sweet onions and they go very well. I don't get the blah comments on the apples...they make the dish! I use fuji's, and regular brandy instead of calvodos, add a pinch of cayenne and they are fantastic! Also, I find that crushing the allspice berries a bit adds some depth, and making sure you "turn" the chops once in the brine is a good idea. The bone in chops are tastier by far, and make a nicer presentation. Very easy, very tasty...A HUGE HIT!

Rating: 3
We really liked this, particularly the leeks. Be sure to rinse, dry & oil the chops before cooking or the apple brine will burn onto your pan. The left overs are also really, really good!

Rating: 2
Well...I'm only rating the leeks portion of the recipe because, even though my brined chops looked and smelled lovely while they were broiling, as soon as I set the glass baking dish on a cold stove it shattered into bits. Oops. Lesson learned. From what I could tell, the chops were nice and tender beneath the shards, though. The leeks were OK. Be careful not to cook them too long at too high a temperature, or the cream thickens to the consistency of wallpaper paste. I would love to try this recipe again and hope for better luck...

Rating: 3
We thought this was very good. Did not bother with the apples. Loved the leeks... Could certainly see them with other grilled meat. Way too easy for such a nice result. I made 2 large loin chops with halved marinade, and 3 leeks with about half cup of cream for 2 hungry people and that was just right. Must now keep leeks on hand!

a tasty dish, easily prepared. Best of all it can all be pretty much assembled before hand leaving time for the cook to socialize.Used Golden delish. apples per advice from another reader and they were perfect, I cut back on the sugar as they are sweeter than Grannies. Served it with red cabbage with caraway seeds and parslied mashed potatoes. Love comment from other reviewers, they are very helpful.

I made this with a pork roast and put a dry spice rub on the outside before putting it on our grill rotisserie. Since other reviewers didn't praise the apples, I served it with homemade applesauce instead and a green bean/goat cheese salad. It was an incredible fall meal. The leeks made the dish!

I've made these pork chops twice in the last 2 weeks, & will make again. Very moist & flavorful! Loved the leeks, but thought the apples would be a little more impressive, given the ingredients & method of cooking.

This easy brining process produces some of the best pork chops ever! The leeks are yummy and creamy too! That said, don't bother with the apples. These apples are nothing special... To the cook from Pittsburgh who said their leeks turned out runny - cook 'em a little longer! The sauce will thicken up eventually, I promise.

Rating: 4
We love this dish. It's an entertaining staple. I use Thick Boneless Center Cut loin Chops to eliminate the hassle of cutting from the bone. Also, to simplify it a little, I use store bought Chunky applesauce instead of cooking the apples special (Though when I do make the apples, they are delish!)

Rating: 4
This was sooo good. The creamed leeks alone are reason enough to try this dish. My husband hates leeks but he ate this up. My only deviation was to use pork Medallions rather than chops. I served it with gewurztraminer. It was a natural paring

To the cook way back in November, who used Kosher salt and it came out too salty - that's why. Kosher salt is finer than coarse, normally, so you probably used too much salt(as I learned the hard way!).

This was a very delicious dish. I had very thick chops and the brining made them extremely tender. The combo of the creamed leeks with apples was sumptuous! I selected this for our Christmas Eve dinner and am glad I did.

Rating: 2
A good dish, but with three main detractors: (1) I found the texture of the pork chops puzzlingly inconsistent, with some pieces being tender and other pieces being tough. That didn't seem to correspond with where in the oven they were cooking, or with how thoroughly they had been brined (the sauce didn't reach some portions, since I forgot to turn them around the next morning). (2) The color of the meat came out an unappetizing gray, which I wouldn't want to serve to guests. Am I doing something wrong? (3) The flavors from the three parts of the dish didn't get the chance to meld together, which gave the feeling of eating a meat, a vegetable, and a fruit, none of which was a standout. The leeks remained runny even on the second day; would they have turned out better pureed? The apples were good but not exciting. A little spice might help. That said, I'm still planning to experiment further with this dish. It was quite simple to prepare and seems to have potential.

Rating: 3
This is a very nice, simple recipe. I simmered the leeks for a bit longer than called for to get a creamy consistancy. Golden Delicious apples do better than Granny Smiths for this, and I have added a splash of Applejack when out of Calvados with good results.

I would make this recipe again, but I would exclude the apples. The recipe tasted delicious with the leeks and sauce, but the apples didn't seem to mix well with the recipe.

This is a wonderful company recipe, and it doubles or triples. The only change I made was to simmer the leeks in chicken broth, and then finish them off at the end with a couple spooonfuls of cream. I've also made this a vegetarian dish by substituting portabella caps for the pork. I marinated the mushrooms in cider and a little bit of teriyaki for about half an hour, then panfried them gently. The mushrooms picked up the cider flavor really well, and complimented the leeks and apples.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable!!! I made this for a family gathering and it was great! The only thing I would do differently is season the leeks more than I did with salt and pepper. I thought they were great when I tasted them alone but when I put everything together they tasted a little bland. Also, the person who commented on using yellow apple instead of Granny smith was right. The granny smith fell apart during cooking. Overall, it was wonderful! My family still talks about the meal and I made it 4 months ago! Thank you Bon Apetit for bringing us this wonderful website!

This was outrageously good. I made it with egg noodles for company and they raved. The presentation is lovely and the pork was well seasoned and tender even though I had forgotten to brine it until the morning I intended to make it. It is a bit time consuming, but it's hardly complicated. Plus it can be made in steps, which keeps you out of the kitchen until it's time to cook the chops. Definitely a nice company dish.

Wow. I've made this twice in the last week. Once with pork chops and then with a tenderloin. I pan roasted the tenderloin, cut it into medalions and placed them on a platter on top of the leeks and then toped with the apples. It was a hit, even with the people who don't like "frou frou" food!

This was a big hit at dinner last night - my family loved it. I only brined the chops for four hours, but the flavor was perfect and not too salty. I also cooked the leeks in chicken stock and a bit of butter (in the microwave for three minutes). Then I added 2 T, cream and heated another 30 seconds. very easy, very quick, very good.

Well, I don't know about this brining thing that everyone's raving about. I USED kosher salt. I RINSED the chops. They were very moist -- and TOO SALTY. I thought I wanted to brine a turkey for the holiday; now I'm back to my tried 'n true method. Very frustrating. I'll definitely try this again; if anyone has other ideas about what I'm doing wrong I'd love to hear them!

We made this for a birthday dinner last weekend and really enjoyed it. Brined the chops for 24 hours and used the tip of using chicken broth and a less cream for the leeks.

Excellent recipe. It was delicious the day that I made it and the two extra chops were just as good the second day. Would definitely make this dish again. Our liquor store manager referred me to Laird's Applejack which he said would be just as good in the recipe and costs far less than Calvados.

We LOVE the flavor of braised leeks and agree that the cup of cream is not necessary. For those who think the leeks are too rich, they are really delicious if you saute in butter, add some chicken stock, cover and cook on low till really tender... then add a few tablespoons of cream to taste at the and and warm to blend flavors. They don't have to be swimming in liquid. Delicious. Instead of brining I marinate the chops overnight in cider with a little dijon and cider vinegar added (and the spices), then grill. Served with the apples and roasted butternut squash it is a great meal.

These are fabulous!!! Tender and a pleaseing blend of flavors. I served them for a dinner party of 12 with a medley of roasted potatoes (sweet, purple & yukon Gold) for a wonderful fall feast. These have been added to my permanent collection of favorites and I can't wait to make them for a different crowd and get more raves!!!

The "2" rating is for the pork. It was very good and incredibly tender. I left in the brine overnight. Like the previous reviewer, we thought the meal was okay, but would not make it again. As many reviewers noted, the leeks were too rich, although, to be fair, we don't really eat "creamed" anything. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream and also added some chicken broth as it was too thick. I didn't like the apples - too sweet or something. I'm hoping my $30 investment for the Calvados wasn't a waste and I can find something else to use it in. Obviously, we are in the minority on this and I don't think it's a reflection on the recipe. For those who like cooked apples and creamed dishes, they'd probably like this much more. P.S. We used a 2 lb pork boneless loin roast, cut into 4 (2") pieces. Lots of people from Alaska making this wintery dish. It must be the 15 degree temperatures these past few weeks. Burr..........

We had a great time making and eating this dish!! Definately a company dish! The brining was amazing on the pork chops, they grilled perfectly, we also used apple wood chips. I doagree that the leeks were a bit on the heavy side, so I cut down on the cream and added chicken stock instead. Next time, I think I would also cut the apples into 8 wedges and not just 4 just for the presentation.

Rating: 3
This was a very nice recipe overall. I would recommend making the leeks ahead of time - they definitely thicken upon cooling and are not as runny. Might also try reducing the apple cider/Calvados mixture more the next time to thicken it slightly too. The cider brine was excellent - really kept the pork chops tender & juicy. Avoid the urge to overcook the chops - they are delicious broiled for the time specified.

Rating: 4
Absolutely exquisite. The leeks are rich, beware this is for special occasions! But the pork chops are incomparably moist and flavorful. I didn't find it too much work - it all depends on your perspective. I did use an apple corer/slicer to quicken the chopping. For everyday, I may skip the leeks -- the brine is so perfect, though, it should be in every cook's repertoire!

I made this recipe both as grilled pork chops and as a 4 lb. pork loin roast, which I brined for 2 and a half days and roasted over an open camp fire on a suspended grill about 18 inches above the coals. The coals were made from oak and apple wood. I covered the roast with a stainless steel bowl to capture the heat around the roast and turned it every 20 minutes or so for 1.5 hours. Everyone loved it. We all liked the leeks and apples, too.

The directions for this recipe were very easy to follow, and we got rave reviews. The leeks were wonderful, I did them the day before like the recipe suggests, but added a little evaporated milk instead of water when I warmed them up the next day. The chops were wonderful, and the apples never tasted that good when my Mother made them, the Calvados was a genuius addition!!!

I doubled this recipe and learned a few things. There was no need to double the brining solution, as it covered all 8 pork chops; Also, when making the apples, don't double the liquids there as well -- it was just too much and turned my apples a lovely (not!) dishwater gray color. Next time I will double the apples, butter and sugar but not the other items. This is a DELICIOUS dish!! Perhaps the person below me used cider vinegar instead of sweet cider???

My wife and I were very pleased with this dish. I wanted to make a few comments based on other reviews related to the finished product being too salty. First, it is very important to rinse and dry the pork before cooking, otherwise the meat will not brown properly. Second, it is probably a good idea to not use pork labeled "garaunteed tender" or "deep marinated". These meats have already been injected with water and salt solutions by the manufacturer. Lastly, Kosher salt has the same amount of sodium as table salt. Table salt contains iodine, when table salt is used in large amounts it can contribute a metallic taste to the finished dish. The iodine also contributes to cloudy brines in pickles.

Rating: 3
The flavors in this dish work together very well, but I didn't think it was the "easiest" meal to prepare. I made it for guests, and they loved it, but I had to juggle the timing of the last steps & assembling the meal. Maybe I needed a "helper"! I'll make it again though - but probably just for my family.

I used almost all the same ingredients (didn't make the apples), but a slightly different methodolgy, and came away with excellent results. I marinaded boneless chops overnight as directed. The next day, I dried them well, dusted with flour, and browned on both sides in olive oil, then removed. Added the chopped leeks to the pan and sauted until soft. Deglazed with 1/4 cup cognac (careful, it will flame up), then added 1/2-3/4 cup cider, and reduced by half. Added 1 cup cream, stired, and added back in browned chops. Simmered, covered, 20 minutes until done, but still slightly pink inside. This turned out perfectly. I was very please with the flavors and textures. I thought this method would better incorporate the sauce with the meat. A wonderful one pan meal that was on the table in minutes. I served with Sausage and Apple stuffing and Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Perfect accompaniments.

We loved this recipe and will plan to make it for our kids when they come home from college. What a great gourmet comfort food meal! Just have to add that when I first saw this recipe, I happened to catch some of the reviews as I was copying and pasting. I had to find out what San Diego had said. Reading all those reviews late on a Friday, after a long week was a hilarious way to end the week. Thanks for the comic relief!

The meat's a bit salty, but the overall result was exquisite with the milder creamed leeks and apples. I used the Chicago short-cut, barbequed the chops and for lack of calvados used a local fruit liqueur. Will try it again A.S.A.P, n'est-ce pas San Diego?!

This review is directed to all those who can still remember their first culinary endeavor. This was my first such effort. I followed the directions to the letter, including a bottle of Merlot. My lady friend and another couple thought the meal was absolutely great. I'm not only willing to try this again (perhaps a pork loin), I can't wait to try something else

My family loved this, and I'd like to try brining other meats, but can't find recipes. Any suggestions?

In response, yes, I used coarse salt. I am aware of the uses of brining, and that salt is necessary. For my taste and that of my family, it was too salty.

Rating: 0
to the last reviewer, brining is a way to make the meat more tender, it has to be kosher salt (coarce) because table salt sodium content is higher. I have not made this recipe yet but I've brined other meats with great results and not alot of salt taste. Sounds like a good recipe to me.

Outstanding flavors that blend together beautifully. I had to cook the leeks at a higher temperature to get them as soft as I like but everything else was supreme.

My family (with two young children)loved this. The leeks were wonderful and would be great with a variety of dishes. My huband requested that we have this again soon! I did cut back the salt in the brine.

To the cook from Madison, WI who asked about broiling: I placed the rack in the middle of the oven and broiled on the high setting (sounds like we have similar GE ovens) for about five minutes per side per the recipe's instructions and got great results. By the way, I'm making this dish again this weekend and plan to roast a pork loin instead of chops; if you've had success with roasts and you're concerned about the broiler thing, maybe you might try the same thing? And thanks, Milwaukee, for filling me in about Sanford. You're right, Milwaukee is a great city.

Great recipe. I love pork and apples. I made rosti potatoes as a side dish and some blanched buttered cabbage. (My family hates sweet potatoes) As for the the cook in San Diego's rudeness, I am sure he has very friends and has to consume many meals at the local Burger King alone.

Simply Sublime!!! Next time I make it, I think I'll add some pecans to the apple/Calvados mixture! Very rich...didn't need a dessert! Served this with Sweet potato and apple cakes, topped with creme fraiche and sauteed fresh green beans....and...a Chilean Merlot.

Thus far, I have really enjoyed the recipes with brine and will try this one only cutting it in half for two. Hope it work. I think San Diego must have a miserable life.

Pork, apple and leeks - a great combination - yummy. Bravo to all of us cooks and kitchen mechanics who have fun with food :-) Poor San Diego needs a happiness booster :-(

I think this recipe sounds delightful. I too am going to try it ASAP, although I'd like to stick San Diego in some brine and refrigerate overnight, some tenderizing certainly couldn't hurt that cranky guy.

I, too, just received this recipe in the New Batch and plan on making it Friday evening. The reviews always inspire me and I just wanted to post this to also say pooh on San Diego along with everyone else. Take your negative comments to the appropriate forum.

Maybe San Diego drank the brine. Recipe sounds fabulous (with Chicago shortcut).

Made it yesterday. Will make it Sunday. 'Tis fantabulous! Think I'll try the Chicago shortcut on Sunday. As far as San Diego is concerned...I too say "Poo on you...Get a life too!"

TALK ABOUT A "USELESS COMMENT" - SAN DIEGO SHOULD GO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE. ANYWAY, I'LL BE TRYING THIS TOMORROW, AND JUDGING FROM THE OTHER REVIEWS, I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. POO ON YOU S.D.

Has anyone tried cutting this recipe down. We will be just 2 for thanksgiving and 4 ten oz chops sounds like an awful lot even for 4 people.

You can get all the flavor and skip the tedious first step by using ground allspice and ground bay leaf.(Available at www.penzeys.com) Put the ground spices in 2 Tabl. of water (Or vinegar) and microwave until hot...then add to the cider and pour over the meat. This way you don't have to wait for the cider mixture to cool down or have a whole house that smells of vinegar.

Can't wait to try this either!!!

I haven't tried the recipe yet but will, now that I've read the reviews. I'm amazed that San Diego would be so critical and unfriendly, especially these days, with everything that's happened. Sites like this are for people to talk about food and not to be mean to one another. There are plenty of other places for that, unfortunately.

What's up with the cook from San Diego? Sounds like a total sour-puss. Good thing he/she didn't post their email...I have a feeling he/she would have got a few. This recipe came in my New Batch from epicurious via email today so I had to read the reviews, and that one really cracked me up. I'll try this ASAP just to piss San Diego off!!

Great meal for entertaining. You can do the prep work ahead of time so you aren't stuck in the kitchen.

Wonderful!! The pork chops were tender and juicy and the apples were excellent on top. The leeks balanced the whole thing out perfectly! I used fat free half & half and the results were delicious. Definitely will make again. I had no Calvados so I used brandy mixed with cider. It was so good!!

Due to scheduling problems I brined the chops for about 44 hrs. They were extremely tender and moist. I used a grill pan on top of the stove. The leeks were a great addition and pairing with the apples as both are in season. I made buttercup squash oven fries and served it all with a Pinot Gris from Oregon.

I enjoyed this recipie. I made it yesterday, 9/30, and the weather was cold and rainy. It was good, Normand comfort food. I used pork tenderloin medallions instead of chops, so I cut the marinade time to about 90 minutes instead of overnight. My one complaint would be it was a little on the salty side. I would cut down the amount next time.

Why the useless input Milwaukee? Who cares if "you will try this ASAP and then post it." Incidentally, the preparation for this meal was too time-consuming with disappointing results.

The cook from california asked if the brine can be reused; NO! The meat will have "used" the salt, reducing the salinity of the brine, and leaving the solution ripe for bacterial growth.Even if you were to boil the brine, thus killing any bacteria left from the pork, you woulld still not have the proper salinity to brine another piece of meat.

I do not eat pork, but the ingredients sound very good. What other meats could work well with this type of preparation? Would lamb chops pick up the flavor as well? Thanks

Rating: 4
A truly wonderful meal to serve in the fall or winter months..very comforting and so tender the pork just melts in your mouth. The creamed leeks are fabulous along with the apples. I served it along with roasted yukon gold potatoes dipped in olive oil, garlic and rosemary and a side of freshly harvested acorn squash. My family and friends loved it..first time using this type of brine..won't be the last.

Question: Does anyone know whether you can reuse the brine for another use? If so, how long can you keep this brine refrigerated before reusing? Thanks!

This is a great recipe. The brining makes the meat very tender and juicy. The creamed leeks are a must! Although I did not make the apple dish as described, I did saute two (2) apples cut up with butter and a little sugar. I then added them to the creamed leeks at the end. It made a very good combo of textures and taste. As a variation, I brined some baby back ribs overnight and barbequed with favoite bourbon BBQ sauce. Delicious! Very tender, juicy and messy!!!! We loved it.

To add even more to an aready wonderful recipe, I served this over blue potatoes mashed with their skins. Taste, color...very nice

I made this recipe for the first time with my mom and it was excellent. She has since made it again for a dinner party with rave revues by all. Make the leeks!!!!! They complete the flavors of the entire meal.

This was truly wonderful. A innovative variation of chicken or duck normandy. Too bad the previous poster didn't try the leeks...they really made the dish. Next time I will cut down on the cream and use part milk with a reduction. Perhap searing the pork and then baking with a bit of apple cider will yield more juicy meat.

Delish. Easy to make and very tender. Didn't make the leeks, so no comment on those. The apples were great and not sweet, so no apple-pie taste, which I expected it to be like.

Rating: 4
Very good and really easy as well. We marinated it overnight. I had no Calvados so I used ApfelKorn (Apple Liquor). Even my picky English husband loved it. The apples would even be good as a dessert with ice cream. No really, they would.
