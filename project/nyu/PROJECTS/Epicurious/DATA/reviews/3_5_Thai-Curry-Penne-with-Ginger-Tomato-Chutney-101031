I was disappointed after reading rave reviews here. i found it too much apple-onion-curry flavor, and too little Thai. I did use light coconut milk, but no other changes. Will not make again. They whole thing was way too sweet for me.

What a disapointment! The sauce for the pasta was good. The chutney was interesting, but not worth making it. I made the modifications reviewers suggested as per original recipe. If I make this again, I'd serve it with rice.

This is an amazing recipe. I put it on the menu at a restaurant that I worked at and the customers loved it and came back again and again for it. We served it with shrimp on top, to keep the cost down, but at home I use crab, and like the one cook mentioned,just pile it on top. The addition of cream is a definite improvement to the consistency. This is one dish that I CRAVE, whenever I think about it!

This would get a solid 3 forks on its own, but the chutney elevates the dish. I made it the first time with chicken, since it was on hand. We may try it with crab, but while I'm sure it will be different, I expect it to rate about the same. I think the particular ingredients could make a big difference in the outcome of this dish, for instance no other apple variety will deliver the right match of tart and flavor to stand up to the chutney. I would substitute for Marsala either, and for the basil, we used a broad leaf this time, but I think I'll use a Thai basil next time.

Awesome recipe!I used to live in Seattle & Ponti is still one of my favorite restaurants. The recipe that the Chef gave to me is different than this version. Once you saute the onion & apple with the curry powder you then add the dry marsala. Simmer until reduced by half. Add broth, curry paste & fish sauce-simmer for additional 10 mins. The curry ,apple & onion mixture needs to be pureed either in food processor or blender to get the best texture. Then returned the mixture to the saucepan.Reduce the amount of coconut milk in the recipe to 1 cup & add 1 cup heavy cream. Stir & keep warm. Increase the pasta to a full pound & serve 6-8 as a side dish. You can serve this with any kind of protein. I usually make 10x the recipe & freeze the sauce for future use.The Tomato Chutney is also great but it is missing 2 tsp lemon juice. Plus the canned tomatoes need to be drained. I always make twice the amount of Chutney for each Thai Curry recipe.This can also be frozen. Yummy!!

This dish is wonderful! However, I changed it up a bit. Instead of using crab I used cut up chicken breasts which I cooked and then added to the mix just before adding the coconut milk. I also added sliced bananas which I was very pleased with. These little tweaks made a most wonderful thai curry chicken dish. Next time I think I will add a little peanut butter to sweaten it up just a touch.

This is an exceptionally good recipe for a change-of-pace meal. My husband and I enjoyed it immensley and will definitely make it again.

The Thai Curry Penne rice I will say I was very excited about. I was worried that it would be a bit too spicy and not salty enough, but it was exactly the opposite. It had just the right amount of saltiness. And the spice of the curry powder and the curry paste was smoothed out by the coconut milk. It did make a very rich entree. It would be good with the penne or some plain long grain white rice or the sticky rice. I think it was very good to the taste palette. I also omitted the crab meat for vegetarian purposes. I really don't know what the fish sauce was for either because I couldn't taste it. Now the ginger-tomato chutney was a little different. I like the consistency of all chutneys and this chutney turned out as expected. I'm glad the tomatoes and everything soaked up the vinegar and balanced out somewhat with the brown sugar. I think I could have removed the vinegar and made it more brown sugary and cinnamon-y, but I think the vinegar+tomato gave it the right sour/acidity that was necessary to counteract the 1/4 cup brown sugar. That was unique the sour and sweet and the spice of the cinnamon (I used powder cinnamon and not the cinnamon stick req'd). It didn't quite fit with the penne I didn't think. But maybe the recipe author was going for smooth salty/spice mixed with sweet/sour/spice which hits all of the taste buds sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy/savory.

This dish is unbelievable, and not all that difficult. I used homemade curry powder, and omitted the crab for vegetarian company -- a good idea since the dish is already incredibly rich. Though the tomato-ginger chutney was great, I think that next time I'd use fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, and maybe add some apples. Fabulous!

Very good dish, and I agree with the previous comments"not outstanding". Different ingredients put all together made it for something different and interesting. The tomato chutney gives it a nice edge. Will make again.

This was really good, not outstanding by any means. Mine needed a little more curry than called for...I did add what some viewers suggest (1 cup of heavy cream) if I make this again, I will not add the cream and most likely will not need more curry that way. The tomato chutney is really good, but my guests really didnt care for it....I made the asian spinach salad from this websight along side and that was the big hit of the evening!

Outstanding! We spent two weeks in Thailand diving and the cooks on the live-aboard were all Thai so we ate delicious Thai food every meal for two weeks. This recipe is equal to theirs. You can sub. white wine for the masala without any problem and the chutney is a MUST. My family devoured it. Thanx, Epicurious!

I agree with the cook from Seattle. The omission of the coconut milk and cream changes the nature of the recipe. I made this (per original recipe) for a progressive dinner as first course and everyone there wanted the recipe. I do not mix in the crab, but serve it in a pile on top of the penne pasta. Incredible recipe!

I've made the ORIGINAL chef's recipe for this as printed in a Seattle magazine. It's beyond 4 stars. I get requests for the recipe every time I make it! The original calls for 1 cup coconut milk plus 1 cup whipping cream in the sauce. It's thick, rich and soo good. I tried the B.A. recipe at a friend's dinner- it's watery, but she made it as a side dish for salmon. You'll love it with the addition of the cream!

Rating: 3
After hearing that the sauce was too watery, I took advice of others and make a roux just when done sauteing the apples/onion/garlic to ensure the sauce was thicker. I agree with an earlier review that said the sauce was bland, I was very disappointed, however to salvage it, I added much more Thai Red Curry Paste (probably about 5-6 teaspoons) and also added some sugar. That gave it the sweetness I was expecting and like. After that, it was much, much better.

Rating: 4
wonderful flavor! i do agree with some of the other posters in that the sauce was a little too watery for me--next time, i'll experiment with either adding less liquid or cooking a roux into it before adding the wine. i also used a nice riesling instead of the marsala (i believe in using the same wine to both cook and drink with the dish). a very versatile and not terribly time consuming dish.

This is truly excellent. Have made it at several dinner parties and guests always love it. The chutney is fabulous and cuts the richness of the sauce nicely, but even the pasta alone is wonderful if one is pressed for time. Loved the crab - I thought the curry would overpower it but it was great. Be sure to use "supermarket" cinnamon (bark of cassia tree) rather than "true" cinnamon which yields sweeter, less interesting results.

very disappointing - followed recipe exactly. We are very open minded diners and usually find something to like about a new recipe. My husband and I are both pretty accomplished cooks and rarely make this kind of mistake when choosing a recipe to try. Ugh - bad color - strange flavor. The Marsala is horrible in this. It may have been edible without the wine but not worth the making at that. What a total waste of ingredients.

Ok...this is one of our all time favorite recipes...the perfect combination of a little spice and sweetness. We are local Seattlites who first had this dish at the restaurant and then had to have the recipe. Our recipe came off the restaurants website www.pontiseafoodgrill.com Check out the recipe there as it does differ from the above. I realize this is reduced by half..but not all the ingredients were reduced by half and that has to change the flavor. I have made this recipe numerous times (from website) reducing it in half exactly from their measurements, and sometimes doubling it. Each time it has been perfect. I urge you to go to the website and use that recipe instead...Enjoy!

Great Recipe! I added red pepper, substituted white wine, and increased the curry. I also thickened the sauce up with a bit of corstarch. This chutney was nice, but not necessary, I would add pineapple instead. The suace would also be great over rice!

Rating: 3
Taking my cue from the other reviews, I experimented with some substitutions: chicken - marniated in soy/fish/sauce/garlic/ginger - instead of crabmeat, dry white wine in place of Marsala, more bell pepper and increased amounts of fish sauce, curry powder, red curry paste, and basil. Turned out just great!!! I confess, didn't make (or miss) the chutney, but I'll give it a whirl next time. Still, the flavors were wonderful. My husband loves pasta dishes and he thought this was awesome. So, this is definitely one for the recipe box!

I've made this recipe several times always using shrimp instead of the crab. Everyone that I've made it for loved it and thought that the chutney was fabulous. I think the chutney is a must for the dish to bring out all the wonderful spices used. It really complements the meal.

I really liked this. I used dry sherry in place of the marsala and omitted the seafood (I forgot to get it at the store). I also didn't make the chutney. I am starting to sound lazy but I still loved the results! My husband liked it as well. The level of spiciness and flavor was wonderful. I will make it again with seafood or chicken and the chutney. Thanks epicurious.

This is by far one of the best recipe's I have ever made. I frequently substitute basmati rice for the pasta, which my husband loves. The chutney is to die for! Everyone wants the recipe.

This recipe was awesome. I was forced to substitute shrimp for crab as fresh crab was not available. The chutney was excellent and was perfect with the penne pasta. I think that chicken would be great with it as others here stated. Actually, the penne is wonderful enough to stand alone with no addition of any meat. My husband gives it two thumbs up. We love spicy food, and this fits the bill. I am definitely popular at my house tonight :)

THe taste was interesting, the color not. It came out rather gray, and looked very unappetizing. I used imitation crab (kosher) which put my family off it too. My kids asked me to make it again, but without the fish. The addition of chicken sounds interesting. I liked the chutney, but agree it wasn't necessary.

Made it without the penne and served it over rice. I simmered it longer and added less liquid to make it thicker and added a lot of seafood (squid, octopi, scallops, shrimp, and mussels) The chutney is a must to give this reasonably bland dish some flavor.

Rating: 3
Really great dish. I love thai and this one tasted authentic. I served it with rice based on the reader comments. However, i would still like my sauce thicker, next time I 'll use cornstarch. Also the chutney was fabulous, but dont know if it was absolutely necessary. The dish was great on its own.

Yummy! This dish is fabulous and so easy to make. The penne absorbs well if you let the sauce simmer long enough to a thickened consistency. What really makes this dish outstanding is the ginger tomato chutney. Will definitely make again!

This dish was lovely, but I have to admit I didn't add the basil or the Thai curry paste. Next time though I will take the advice of other reviewers and spruce up the crab with other seafood (maybe shrimp and/or scallops) and serve it over rice. The penne doesn't absorb the sauce very well.

After reading the comments of others I tried a variation on this recipe which worked out spelndidly: I replaced the crab with chicken, ($) which I marinated for a few hours in rice vinegar/soy sauce/a stirfry oil combo/ginger/garlic, and opted for jasmine rice instead of pasta. I doubled both recipes, (which really didn't leave too much by way of left-overs for four hungry people,) and added some stirfried asian eggplant to the curry to increase the veggie content. To serve I poured the curry over a bed of jasmine, then lay the strips of chicken breast (which I had cooked up after finishing with the eggplant) on top and poured the chuntney over the chicken & garnished with basil. My guests raved. The spices & the apples made for a slightly unusual and delicious combination.

What a wonderful spicy dish, and so easy to make. This is one dish that I will make often.

Great results for a relativly low effort meal. I double up on the apple because it adds so much to the flavour. I also add julienned carrots and red pepper for more colour and substance and I really think that it is a waste of fresh crab as its subtle taste gets lost among the other flavours. I use chicken or prawns but it is great kept vegetarian as well.

This dish had great flavor. But unfortunately I used canned crab instead of fresh. I also think I would have enjoyed better with Jasmine rice.

My husband is a chef and we made this dish together. The odd combination left us thinking we left something out or missed a step. The finished result was very disapointing.

This dish couldn't have been more delightful to eat (or prepare). It was a little touch-and-go for awhile, though. Being in a high-elevation, the curry sauce refused to thicken, but adding a smidge of corn starch helped remedy the situation. I also used rice instead of the penne, which made for a swell variation. The amount of curry was the right amount of heat and the apples were a nice surprise. This is a great recipe to make on a date--there's so many things to chop and prepare, which can be a lot of fun. I think we both surprised ourselves that we could make something this fabulous.

Great aroma. I'm not a curry lover; however, I found this to be full of flavor and not overpowering. Next time I will try this over basmati rice. I found the penne pasta didn't allow full appreciation of the sauce. I had to add an extra tsp. of the red curry paste. The coconut milk seemed to kill the heat. Was a hit with my guests! The chutney was an excellent accompaniment.

The first time I made this recipe, it was for a dinner party and it was a smashing success. My world-traveling dinner guests were quite impressed. I wasn't able to get real crab where I live, so I substituted bay scallops sauted with some basil, and they were great.

Though I am sometimes of the opinion that fusion ingredients would have been better left asunder, this recipe is a credit to the genre. There was no fresh crab available at my local market, so I used fresh shelled crayfish tails instead. This was a great success. The chewiness and bright red-flecked crayfish tails stood up wonderfully well to the piquant sauce. I chose to add 1 tablespoon of fresh lime juice during the last minute of cooking to help balance the flavours and give the sauce extra freshness. The spiciness can be increased by using extra Thai red curry paste, but do so with caution. It is very hot.
