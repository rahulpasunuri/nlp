What a wonderful treat for my body! I feel so much better after eating this for a couple days in a row as my midday meal. I use the broccoli & beans raw also. Red, green & yellow peppers sliced in narrow slices are great also--and celery. All of the raw slices are beautiful together in a casserole dish of water in the fridge to snack on, and the potatoes & turnips add a cooked treat.
