Turned out better then expected. I used regular vinegar and added 1 tbsp grainy dijon mustard. For vegetables I used shredded cabbage (green and purple), broccoli stems, carrots, fennel and apple. Even the picky eaters finished their plates.

Not my favourite coleslaw recipe. It's a little sweeter than I expected with just 1 tbsp of honey, and the apple doesn't make an appearance at all. It was eaten and my picky husband didn't complain, but I think I'll keep looking.

I used the Cole Slaw mix and added a red delicious(because it was the oldest in the house). Nice, easy side to go with cider-braised chicken.

My husband, who LOVES mayo based coleslaw dressing, drank the leftover. Enuf said. I also used celery salt instead of plain salt. I will never buy dressing for him again!

Make this a day ahead. Don't worry about the apple turning brown, either. The tart sweetness of the apple is amazing -- I used 2 apples, which grated easily after peeling. Had rave reviews from our friends at our annual BBQ last Saturday. Very small amount of leftovers!

I am a cole slaw lover. And the last time I craved homemade, I made this recipe. Next time I will use only the green cabbage. Although the red looks nice and may add nutrients to the dish, I had no other use for the other half of the heads.

I love cole slaw, and this recipe satisfied my cravings for it. I followed this recipe to the letter except used only green cabbage so I could use up the entire head. Everyone raved about this cole slaw!

I'm not usually a cole slaw person, but this wasn't too bad. It was actually kind of refreshing. We ate it with ribs, beans and melon. We added pepper and a sprinkling of celery seeds.

I would have given this 2 forks except my wife and friends (including the one who doesn't like cabbage) really enjoyed it. It was too bland initially and took some heavy tinkering. We used a couple of handfuls of minced heirloom celery leaves, chopped onion, extra dressing, cumin, and pepper. That said, the base recipe is very good.

I added a little pineapple instead of apple and added some of the juice to the dressing. Yummy!

I made this without the apple or carrots, and it was superb. A great, straightforward, simple and easy recipe. Delish!

This cole slaw will convert cole slaw haters--it's that good. It's not too heavy on the mayonnaise and has a wonderful light flavor. Also, don't fear the apple. It adds a tart burst of flavor without added a distinctive apple- y taste. I will make this again and again!

Loved the simple way this came together! Perfect for Hot Dogs. I used applesauce with a little lemon juice the first time, then green pepper jelly which was incredible, then I tried strawberry jam, that was amazing! It is such a flexible recipe and so quick, experimenting is easy. Next I am going to use mint jelly and serve the slaw with Applewood slow smoked lamb. Leave the honey out if using jelly or jam. A touch of tarragon is nice and cumin adds a wonderful flavor that can't be identified.

I'm always looking for a good twist on this classic. This one is simple and really tasty--at least the way I made it! These are the amendments I made: 1 whole red cabbage parsnips for carrots agave nectar for honey Yum!

I can only comment on the dressing. I threw it together and just used packaged slaw! It was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty and easy. I used celery seed also. I used just green cabbage and used mac apples. Why don't we make cole slaw more often?

Easy to make. Works great with a mandoline on the cabage. Just the right sweetness.

Good stand-by dish. I like my cole slaw a little runny, which is what this dish becomes on the second day, but if you can't wait, scrunch the cabbage with the salt by hand until it becomes softer, then add the dressing and it's delicious! Definitely needs pepper and some celery seeds, as other reviewers suggested. Otherwise it's too bland.

Very good standard cole slaw, nothing mind blowing, but I would be happy to take it to a pot luck. Husband licked the bowl ;-)

Adding some grated red onion to this made it heavenly! Definitely better the next day.

Very easy but pretty bland- I think the shredded apple turned mushy -- I'll keep searching!

Simple to make and delicious. Using a tart apple makes it even better. Perfectly good the first day but terrific the second day.

Nice simple recipe, I agree with the Cook from Bethesda, MD, I also left out the apple, added 1/4 cup of sour cream, but left out the salt and added celery salt instead...also used packaged cabbage and carrots. The cole slaw was much better the second day!

Very simple to make - tastes GREAT, better the next day . Left out apple, increased the mayo a bit, used only green cabbage. Liked the idea of honey rather than sugar; more "natural".

We liked this recipe a lot but I wasn't sure about the apple so I left it out. I am making it again tonight and serving it with some Chicago Style sausages. My husband can't wait.

Still searching for that simple, delicious cole slaw recipe. I really love a good cole slaw, but I don't think this is the one.

While I recognize that cole slaw is a very personal matter, this is very close to my favorite recipe. I don't like apple in my slaw, so I leave it out. Instead, I add about 1/4 cup of sour cream, and a dash of celery seed. That gives this recipe back a little bit of the tartness and pizazz. Also, mix it up an hour or two ahead of time to give the flavors a chance to meld.

Very simply and easy to make, especially if you buy pre-packaged cabbage. We loved it.

I thought this recipe was great. We served it with fried speckeled trout we had caught. I also added about an eighth of an onion grated to it and pepper. It was really yummy and light. We had cut-up fresh garden tomatoes and jalapenos on the plate also which went well with the slaw.

This is a dressed cabbage type of slaw, not the soaking wet kind, which is nice.

Quick and easy. Make ahead and chill overnight for maximum flavor.

This was simple, easy and good. Like the other Floridian, I used pregrated cabbage and carrots and added the apple and the dressing.

I thought it was have more flavor but it was really kind of bland.

Really good and simple!! I used low fat mayonnaise to cut down on the fat and I cheated by buying a prepacked "slaw mix" and shredded carrots. The apple, yes that I did grate myself, added a nice touch. This was almost too easy and tasted great!! Will definitely make it again!!

I served this coleslaw along with BBQ baby back ribs and it was excellent! My husband said this was the best cole slaw he had ever had! The apple kicked it up a notch, as Emeril would say!

Just okay...thought it would be something special, but was disappointed.
