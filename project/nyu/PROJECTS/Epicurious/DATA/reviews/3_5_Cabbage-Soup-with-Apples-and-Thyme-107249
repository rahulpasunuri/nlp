I had a whole Napa cabbage, three good apples getting old and a small chunk of ham to use up. Used most of it (half the cabbage) plus some garlic on this, and it was terrific. My husband usually does not care for my vegetable-based soups, but he really enjoyed this one. Used some chicken stock, some homemade vegetable stock. Loved the apples.

Delicious soup. I made this to use up an abundance of apples and cabbage that I got in my CSA and I wasn't disappointed. The only alteration I made was that I added sausage with the onions at the beginning. I really liked the way that the flavours from the apple topping went together with the rest of the soup. I'll be making this one again!

I loved this soup the first time I made it (though I used quite a bit less broth), but my mum didn't like it much. So when I warmed it up the next day I started with a light roux to thicken it and served it with sour cream and she loved it. Great flavor, highly recommended.

I had a huge head of napa cabbage from my CSA that I was searching to put to good use in an autumn-inspired dish-- and this recipe definitely did the trick. I made a few alterations: added potatoes and a diced delicata squash to the cabbage to add body/ creaminess (without dairy) and ended up blending the entire soup with my immersion stick blender. i added shallots to the apples, carmelized and topped the creamed soup with this delicious mixture--it added a nice contrast in textures, and the sweet, tartness of the apples play nicely against the cabbage base. I also, topped mine with a little homemade pesto-- it added a brightness. My fiance (usually prefers meaty dishes) and I both really enjoyed this hearty and satisfying soup on a damp, New England November day!

I LOVED this... Used veggie broth instead of chicken and added some parsley I had in the fridge... I thought it was awesome.

Four forks with alterations. We had a small French cabbage, maybe 4-5 cups' worth, and two large shallots. I threw in some (cooked) slices of pork sausage while sauté-ing the cabbage, then deglazed the pan with a splash of muscadet and fished out the sausage to accompany the apples. I used dried herbes de Provence, black pepper, and vegetable bullion cubes with 3-4 cups of water; I blended the soup with a stick blender, added a splash of whole milk, and tipped in the apple/sausage combo. Yum.

Followed the recipe as written and served it at our weekly soup night. Even the college aged men who attended ate it. A keeper!!

I added cayenne and paprika. I also pureed half of it and omitted the apples and instead squeezed fresh lemon juice on it.

I like my cabbage a little sweet so I added some ingredients. After browning the onions and cabbage I deglazedd the pan with white wine. . I sauteed apples with a carrot and added raisins at the end.then combined everything to simmer together. Didn't add salt as there is enough in the chicken broth. This came out like a thick cabbage sweet stew and was delicious.

A few quick notes: Browning is key. Sautè bacon first then remove bacon (use it as a garnish at the end) and add onoin etc. fdsMake sure the apples are well carmelized. I added some diced acorn squash as well and it worked fine. Add emmenthaler cheese on top and broil for deliciousness.

i didn't like the flavors of this soup. and there wasn't much flavor to like. i have three kids that wouldn't eat it either. my husband gave it a thumbs up though!

Delicious. Be sure to saute the cabbage-onions until they're nicely browned. I added a potato, used turkey broth and simmered about 25 minutes before serving with the sauted apples as a topping. I also added a bit of grated cheese. Really good for a weeknight.

I love all the ingredients in this soup, and used a high quality chicken broth - however this soup had no substance to it at all. None of the flavors hung together. Another reviewer called it "mild". I call it bland. The best part about this soup was that it was fast, and didn't cause a lot of dishes to have to be washed. The worst part was the soup, and the waste of perfectly delicious cabbage, apples & stock. I'll never make this again.

I love this soup! I used margarine and veggie broth in place of butter and chicken broth and it turned out great. My boyfriend doesn't like cabbage and he keeps asking me to make it again. Delicious!

A delicious and creative combination of flavors. The apples and the fresh thyme add a great element. This is some of the best soup I've ever made. My husband loved it!

It's such an unlikely combination, but so good. I make it exactly as is and love it.

I poured the leftover soup in the blender and pureed it. Yum, that is what I will do next time.

I can't say enough about this recipe - it was a FANTASTIC rainy, cold fall day meal. I followed it exactly as written and my husband and I were totally impressed. The combination of flavors worked so well. This was a perfect example of a recipe that I never would have tried if I had just seen it, but after reading everyone's reviews, I gave it a shot and I'm really glad I did!

Very interesting combination of cabbage and apples. My family loves it, and i have made it a few times already.

Fabulous, simple soup. Couldn't have been easier. I added some potatos and served it with brown Irish soda bread. Everyone raved.

This was delicious on the first day but after sitting overnight it started to smell like saurkraut (YUCK!). If i make it again it will be with the intention of eating it up right away.

I had some extra cabbage left over from another recipe that I didn't know what to do with. This dish was easy to make, very tasty, and filling. My honey even went back for seconds.

I made the recipe according to directions and thought it was a very good soup, hearty yet not overly heavy or filling. I think it would be even better with chunks of bacon or ham, or better yet, served on the side of a cooked goose. It is definitely a new way to use cabbage and I'll make it again!

I had some ham left over so I added it and used the drippings from ham to make a stock for the soup. I also added some carrot. Was wonderful, everyone enjoyed very much! It is a keeper.

I will make this every New Years Day, but that's it. IT's a nice way to sneak that cabbage into a meal. I added flour to the cabbage onion mixture before the broth to give it some body and also added about 1/2 cup of half and half. Used dried thyme because I couldn't find fresh and topped with the sour cream as suggested. This needs something else, but I'm not sure what it is. Overall a good mild soup.

I had some cabbage in the refrigerator and some chicken stock in the freezer. I hoped the soup would not be a waste of good chicken stock. It was not. The sweetness of the apples played well against the cabbage flavor. I added a couple of carrots, for color, and sour cream on top. Very nice surprise.
