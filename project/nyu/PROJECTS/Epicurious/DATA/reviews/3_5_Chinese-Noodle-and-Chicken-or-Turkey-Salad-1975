I have been making this recipe for more than 10 years. To simplify I buy a roasted chicken at the grocery store and use shelled edamame instead of the peas. This speeds up the assembly and the edamame adds some crunch.

Got rave reviews from bookclub! I'd recommend making it the night before to let the flavors meld together.

I made a version of this recipe using blanched bokchoy, linguine, green onions, grilled chicken breast, and red bell pepper and served over baby spinach. Very fresh. The dressing was a huge hit. My family can't wait till I make this again!

I just made this recipe with some modifications and it was good. Whole Foods didn't have Nappa Cabbage and snap peas were expensive so I purchased a pre-cut asian slaw that included cabbage, broccoli and carrots. It worked very well. I also sauted the veggies with the scallions, cilantro, jalapeno, turkey and some of the dressing very briefly. I only used half the suggested jalapeno but I think I should have used more or left a few of the seeds in.

Excellent recipe... I did however, add the minced ginger to the dressing, & made 1.5x recipe. I used a multi- grain pasta, didn't change anything so was a little healtheir even yet. I also chopped red & yellow bell peppers and added each time I served it up, vs in the bowl so they wouldn't go wilty. Same thing with the dressing - i only did a tad of sesame oil on the pasta, but then added the dressing as I went so I could control how much I used. Regardless of these little modifications..... it was fabulous! I will make on a regular basis. Great way to use left0over turkey!

I simplified this recipe. The flavor is very bold, but salad doesn't get "dry" the next day. Use only 8-16 oz. of pasta for this amount of dressing. Add cooked chicken, cilantro, sliced green onions, shredded carrots and/or cabbage. Mix dressing, combine with salad and chill. Serve with crunchy chow mein noodles on top.

This recipe is great as a starting point but to make this salad exceptional marinate the chicken breast in a garlic soy sauce and grill. Add a red bell pepper, half a cucumber, a grated carrot and cilantro. The added colors from the vegetables and flavor of the cilantro makes this salad jump out at you. I've made this salad multiple times this way and it's always a hit.

I quartered the recipe and it made enough for my two teenage children and I to take in Gladware on a long JetBlue flight. We really enjoyed it above the clouds, but I finally figured out what was missing- the ginger! The 2nd time I made it, I added about 2 T. fresh ginger into a quarter-recipe of the dressing. Also I added 1/2 head of chopped Napa cabbage to the whole thing, which stretches it further. THEN it's perfect. I'd say a full recipe might feed 12, though, not 20 as a main course.

There seemed to be enough dressing when i tossed it, but when i pulled it out for lunch the next day it was very dry. Would definitely need to make more dressing next time.

This is a really good salad, but you either need to double the vegatibles or you need to cut the noodles by about a third. The dressing is amazing. You take a bite, enjoy it and then you can't help but take another. This recipie really does feed 20

This recipe has all of the ingredients that I love in an Asian noodle salad. The sauce seemed way too strong, and I'm not a flavor-wimp. I made the recipe as directed, but will adjust the potency of the sauce next time. I really did not understand (or appreciate) the added sesame oil to the cooked noodles BEFORE hitting it with the sauce that ALSO contains sesame oil. Yeah, I like that flavor a lot, but that's a LOT of oil. All in all, I ate it, will eat it again.

I made half the dressing and served this dish WITHOUT the noodles! (and still had extra sauce). A big favorite with friends and my teenage kids. YUMMY.

We used low-sodium soy sauce on this one. We love it and it is a regular "staple" dish in our house. We love the sauce but found that to halve the recipe (10 servings) we needed almost all of the dressing for 20 servings so that the salad was not too "dry".

Rating: 2
Way too salty! I was quite disappointed and ended up having to dilute the sauce considerably. Also using processed peanut butter resulted in almost no peanut flavor to the sauce. Keep looking, there are better peanut noodle recipes out there.

I made a quarter of this recipe for two people, and it was very good. My husband loved it; however, I agree w/the previous reviewer who thought the dressing was too salty. I was thinking next time I might use a low-sodium soy sauce, and add a little more sugar. I also liked the ideas from other reviewers about adding things like red pepper...it could use some color. But I'll definitely be making it again!!

This dish is great for potlucks. My family adds carrots, bean sprouts and red peppers. Great dish for adding what your family palate craves.

I made this for a casual meeting--a half recipe--and it was easily pared down from a quantity perpsective. It was well-received, with requests for the recipe, and the leftovers held over well until the next day. While this is not the spiciest peanut sauce chicken and pasta I've made, it is wonderful for a crowd. I am sure I will use this recipe often.

I was looking for a recipe similar to one a local restaurant serves, and this one fit the bill. Based on the comments, I had chopped peanuts, crispy noodles, and toasted sesame seeds available for garnish. I personally think it needed no more than the sesame seeds. I also added thinly sliced carrots, blanching them with the snow peas. The snow peas were actually the part I wasn't impressed with. I didn't think the thin slices with all of the loose little pea pieces was as attractive as leaving them whole would have been. In addition, they really wilt down and lose color the next day, again not very attractive. Next time I will probably leave them out and go just with the carrots. The cilantro already gives some green to the salad, so color is not lost without the snow peas. Just an opinion. Overall, this is an excellent summer dish and travels well!

This dish was very good! My husband's reaction was "yummy!" I also added mandarin oranges and chopped peanuts - I think they added a lot. Used low fat peanut butter and low sodium soy. Still had great taste. This recipe would be great without the meat also. Very light. Good warm weather meal. Might try adding some mint or thai basil to it next time to add a little more herbacious-ness to it!

My guests loved this but my husband thought it was so-so. It is a crowdpleaser, but I would serve it on the warm side of lukewarm/room temp. I had to use proportionally much more dressing than what was called for. I also had to add garlic. And it seemed a bit bland-looking so I added some roasted peanuts and blanched julienned carrots. Why bother, you ask, but I will definitely make this again and never again be intimidated by those fancy-schmancy noodle salads in the deli section.

I actually have been looking for this recipe for work. I thought I had marked the issue of Bon Appetit so it would be easy to find. It is awesome and one of my daughters favorites. I have served it at several catered functions.

In addition to the printed recipe, I have used the dressing with cooked chicken added to a mescalun salad with mandarin oranges, peanuts, and crispy noodles. I have served this for luncheons and everyone raved over the salad and requested the recipe.

So Good!!! Aside from a lot of chopping, very easy to make. Added mandarin oranges and slivered almonds. YUMMY!

Fantastic and quick to make! I was worried that my wife wouldn't like this because she doesn't eat peanut butter; she loved it. The flavors are so subtle that it's a perfect blend. So often Asian chicken salad is overwhelmed by either vinegar, soy or peanut butter flavors; not here.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for a teacher's luncheon at my children's school and it was completely wiped out. Something totally different than the usual chicken or tuna salad. I will make this again.

I've been making this dish for years and it is a consistent winner just the way it is (although it is a lot of chopping). I do recomend tasting the sauce before pouring it over the salad, though. Sometimes I seem to want to tweak up the amount of vinegar and/or peanut butter.

I used hokkien noodles in this recipe as a personal preference and I also used a store bought BBQ chicken for time and convenience. I have not used sesame oil before and found the smell rather strong so therefore cut the quantity by half. I could not find any rice vinegar at the supermarket so I had to substiture red wine vinegar after these adjustments I found this dish to be scrumptious and will be making it again. I also wondered what it would be like cooking it in a wok and serving it hot.

This is yummy! Tried it with angel hair pasta and served it over angel hair cabbage (ready pac salad)--we ate every bite. Would probably omit scallions next time: persoanl taste. But, this is a meal in itself and a fun change.

VERY rich, so a small portion goes a long way... Good for picnics or buffets where lots of different foods are offered. I substitute chili paste for the fresh peppers and get a more consistant flavor.

I too have been making this salad for years. I have never changed the original recipe and I have been asked time and again to bring this salad with me to functions. I find that it works best at home if this and a green salad, and a light pasta salad is the menu. It is a bit heavy with other fare. Great for a do ahead summer by the pool menu.

I'm very sparing with my 4-fork ratings, but this was definitely one. Use a combo of soba, udon, & somen noodles for nice color/texture. Add chopped seeded cucumbers and red peppers. Omit the jalapenos and substitute some Chinese chilli sauce for it, mixed in with the dressing; taste dressing before adding to salad, adjust w/sugar, soy sauce, water, chilli sauce to taste. Use LOTS of cilantro. A big hit among both the Americans and Asians at the picnic we went to.

This was okay, but not worth the effort as far as I'm concerned. The flavors in the dressing were somewhat too rich, so much so that I couldn't eat more than a little bit at a time. It might be okay served alongside grilled meats or something like that, but I wouldn't recommend it as a main dish salad.

outstanding dish! It also makes a great picnic dish. The flavors are just the right blend to make it one of my top favorite salads.
