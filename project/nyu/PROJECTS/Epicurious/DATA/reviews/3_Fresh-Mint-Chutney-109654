Okay recipe, but a little too tangy. I would add a lot less lime juice, and omit half the sugar.

Fresh, easy and very good. It's a very forgiving recipe - I've used mint sometimes and cilantro others. I've used scallions some times and red onions or shallots others. I serve it mainly with home-made Indian-style food - samosas, tandoori chicken, etc. Excellent.

totally yummy! made without the pepper, and the cumin still gave it a nice kick. could be good as salad dressing, too.

Served first with garlic and Garam Masala-coated lamb loin chops. Extremely good! Shocked a guest when I informed him there was no oil in this recipe. Have mixed this into scrambled eggs to great success.

Very refreshing - served fresh with bbq shrimp skewers. Served leftover mint chutney as condiment with leftover shrimp in a stir fry - nice too. Colour of day-old chutney didn't look as muddy as warned - looked fine.
