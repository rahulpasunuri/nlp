I had to make this because I'd been eyeing it since it was published. Despite the two reviews, which both seem a little imbecilic to me, this was a great dish. I'm surprised more haven't tried it, but in a way it points to the sad absence of baked Alaska in modern cooking. Adapting it for an island tropical flavor is BRILLIANT...perfect for a small dinner party on a lazy warm weekend. I opted to make the sorbet...DO THIS! It's great, and really only takes ten minutes of active time. The rest is freezing and allowing to set. Note - I made the sorbet as instructed, but used 2/3 fresh pineapple and 1/3 mango. It's what I had, and I felt it really mellowed the sorbet into an irresistible tropical medley. The cake is a very French meringue cake (albeit with coconut). I followed the recipe exactly, but when I make this again I'll try to concoct something to slightly soak the cake with...as the French like to do. Perhaps something with coconut, rum and lime undertones. It was pretty easy to make these, the real challenge being getting them formed and out of the molds (biscuit cutters would be better to freeze these in, since you can then pop them out easier). But after a little effort, BAM. Just cook them long enough so that the sorbet just begins to melt, and you'll have the perfect dessert. Cold and warm, creamy and cakey, tropical, sweet and oh-so-awesome.

Lot of work.....and the end result was not very tasty, plus it's totally frozen....not sure how to make it work.
