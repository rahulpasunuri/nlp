I love the combination of peanut butter and banana in a sandwich, so I just had to make this pie for our dinner party last night. It turned out beautifully and everybody LOVED it! I don't understand the reviewer who said that the peanut butter crust overwhelms the pie. On the contrary it complimented it wonderfully. I also don't understand the reviewers who had trouble with the vanilla pastry cream. If you follow the instructions, you end up with a VERY thick cream that actually stands up to being cut with a knife once you've assembled the pie. And the whipped cream on top adds another layer of deliciousness which a meringue topping suggested by another reviewer just could not match. I actually doubled the amount of whipped cream to make sure it covered the whole pie well. Finally, I used a slightly different recipe for the Bourbon caramel - one which calls for caramelizing the sugar with butter rather than water, much easier to do. It was outstanding! By the way, the pie can be made several hours ahead and refrigerated until serving.

I brought this to a Superbowl party last night and I had people tell me it was the best dessert they'd ever had. I followed the instructions as written and everything turned out amazing. I added an extra banana but that was the only difference. The caramel is to die for! People were digging in with spoons before the appetizers were served!

This is a pefect tart. The flavors are amazing. Note: Do not blend the custard. Once it is cooked and after adding the butter and vanilla jsut put it through a sieve. Bending it made it looser.

Okay. I've never reviewed a recipe before, but I definitely wanted to put my two cents in on this one. First off, my pastry cream set up fine, but not only do you have to chill the pastry cream a long time, but you also have to chill the pie well after it is assembled but before you put on the whipped cream topping. (Which, by the way, I did not use. More on that later.) Second, about the crust.....it TOTALLY overwhelmed the pie. As Damon Wayans used to say on his SNL skit called "Mens on Film"......HATED IT! What a way to ruin a banana cream pie! Now, what everyone failed to mention was the utterly SUBLIME salted bourbon caramel sauce. I'm not much on liquor in my desserts, but the bourbon really cuts the sweetness and adds depth. Now, for the topping. How could that pie POSSiBLY need any more whipped cream? Enough already! Now, this is what you do: Take the egg whites that you thought you didn't need, and place them in a stainless bowl. Whisk in 3/4 to 1 cup sugar (depending on how sweet you like it), and place over double boiler. Whisk constantly until the mixture is warm and sugar is dissolved ( rub it between your fingers; it should not feel grainy) Remove from heat and beat at med speed for a couple of minutes then increase speed and beat until stiff. Put on the pie, torch it (yes, you need to buy one) and you will have the most beautiful pie. Ever.

After reading the reviews, think I'll skip this one!

I will not make this recipe again. As others suggested I reduced the amount of milk and increased the cornstarch/flour to make the filling to set up. Even with the changes I still ended up with a pile of goo. Excellent tasting goo...but I expected more.

A friend brought this pie to a party and it instantly became my favorite pie of all time. I recently made it myself, and it came out reasonably well, even though i rarely bake or make desserts. However, due to the extreme amount of work involved, I won't be making it again anytime soon. I think part of the confusion is the vague instruction to cook the pastry cream "until thick." I had never made pastry cream before, and as I stirred, I realized I had no idea how much thickness I was going for. I set a timer for three minutes and considered stopping several times, as the cream gradually thickened. Eventually, it achieved a pudding-like consistency, which I decided was good enough. The person who had a liquid filling must have just not cooked it enough. My pie was very pudding-y, delicious but not very attractive once it was served. (the original pie that my friend made was the same way) Would additional cooking time make the pastry cream more solid?

Definitely did not set up. Too many steps for something with that result. I was too busy to read the reviews - my own fault. I would also let the cream warm up to room temp before adding it to the caramel. We added it straight from the fridge, and a huge glob promptly turned into a ball of hard candy. Will not be making this recipe again.

I reduced the milk and added extra corn starch as others suggested and my custard was still the consistency of cake batter after sitting in the fridge for 12 hours. Very, very delicious cake batter, but still. The real disaster came when I tried to transport the 'pie' to my family's Easter dinner. Think what it would be like to transport a pie plate filled to the brim with uncooked batter and a cloud of whipped cream on top. It was a hot mess. I'd make it again but next time I'm putting gelatin in the custard. Two days of work should yield a pie you can move more than 5 feet in any direction.

This was a nice dessert. Mine didn't set up very well either, but not a total disaster. Not sure if I'll make it again.

The other reviewers of this pie are too forgiving. It simply does not set up. I am an experienced baker who has made many banana cream pies in her day and this did not work. In the end, it was an overly sweet pile of goo.

I wish I had read all the reviews first. Because the pastry cream never set up properly I was forced to just scoop the pie into martini glasses. That said, it was hands-down the best cup of pudding I've ever eatenmy boyfriend said so, too.

Amazing and definitely a showstopper! It wasn't difficult at all and was ready to eat 3 hours after I started it (including the 2 hours for the pastry cream to chill). I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the milk by 1/3 cup, and my pastry cream was ready to use in less than 2 hours. I also used more whipped cream and could only find "lightly salted" peanuts, so I used less salt. The caramel added a perfect extra touch. Everyone really loved this pie!!

I halved this and made a few tarts instead of a pie. The crust is ridiculous. In a great way. The pastry cream wasn't the best I've had, but you wouldn't want something overpowering the bananas and the caramel anyways. I ate the leftover caramel out of bowl the next day, and I don't feel bad about it at all.

This pie was amazing. Don't be intimidate by the four separate components. I started this pie mid-afternoon and it was firm and ready to go by 9:00 PM. The pastry cream is easy and firmed up perfectly; the pie cut easily into slices. The bourbon caramel sauce is to die for. This is definately a keeper.

Thanks so much to earlier reviewers. Based on feedback about the runny filling I decreased the milk by 1/3 cup and increased the cornstarch and flour by 1/2 tablespoon each. Had no trouble with the filling. I would agree that 3/4 cup of whipping cream isn't quite enough for the top of the pie. Only other change I made was to use lightly salted peanuts for the crust and omit the salt - just happened to be what I had on hand. Made crust and filling one day in advance and the rest of it came together fairly quickly the following day. Rave reviews from my family.

Awesome dessert. The crust was phenomenal; the filling, divine. A little labor-intensive, but well worth the effort. I made this as a tart rather than a pie, and had no problem getting the pastry cream to set. my guests tucked into it like they hadn't eaten all day, and the scant leftovers disappeared at breakfast. Will definitely be adding this to my list of favorite tarts.

Made this pie for Valentines Day. It was delicious and completely worth the effort. I had the same problem with it runnning all over the place, which was kinda cool when served. I will definitely make this again, either with less milk as suggested,more cornstarch or flour,or cooking the mixture longer. Or a combination of all. If it sets up a little better tomorrow I will make the cream a day ahead next time.

Pie you can drink with a straw! Brilliant!

I used 1/2cup less milk for the custard and had no problem with it thickening but as others have mentioned, once you cut it, the contents slide everywhere which makes serving it up messy and a little tricky. Otherwise it was a lovely pie, not that sweet considering all of the sugar, but I would add more bananas as I felt it could have had more of a banana taste.

After reading everyone's reviews, I was worried about the pastry cream not setting. So, I followed this recipe but I subbed the pudding portion of this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Caramel-Pudding-Tart-with-Almond-Shortbread-Crust-236889. It never lets me down. I also made more whipped cream per other reviews and really, who doesn't want more whipped cream?!

Right. The pastry cream was not firm enough. I think it had to do with the flour and the amount of eggs and butter, though I'm not certain about that. I imagine for the recipe to work out, you would have to boil the heck out of the pastry cream to get it at the right consistency. After I realized it was too runny, I re-cooked it with about another 1 T of cornstarch and that helped a bit. This is the recipe we used in culinary school, and it works like a charm. I would make this again, but sub the pastry cream with this recipe (same technique as in the BA recipe): 1 pt milk, 4 oz sugar, 1.5 oz egg yolk, 2 oz whole eggs, 1.25 oz cornstarch, 1 oz butter, 2 t vanilla. The problem is that you will probably have leftover pastry cream (which is why I went with the BA recipe in the first place). I would also probably spike the whipped cream w/bourbon next time, and probably make mini-pies instead of one big one.

I agree with other reviewers-- custard was not firm enough, and the whipped cream amount was not enough to serve up for the whole pie. The blend of flavors was nice, less sweet than I expected. The time and steps involved in making this recipe, not to mention the amount of eggs, sugar and cream, make it doubtful that I would make this again.

Loved all the flavors but had a problem with the pastry cream as it was not solid enough to cut as a pie. Will check other recipes before I make it again as to amount of cornstarch and flour. Crust and carmel wonderful.

WOW, this is my family's new favorite pie. It's not pretty when it's done (like the picture), but the flavors are just fantastic! Try it - you'll love it.

YUM! Crust is very different for a banana cream pie - tastes like fresh peanut butter. I had lots of pastry cream left over - whipped cream was only enough to put a thin layer over the top. Not like the photo, although it was plenty as this pie is VERY rich. Will make again for sure.
