Perfectly spicy! We brined the pork chops ahead of time, so I cut the amount of salt in half. I put all ingredients in the food processor with a little bit of olive oil.

Exceptional, wonderfully tasty, and easy moist pork chops! Has been in our rotation for several years now. Doable for a weeknight yet perfect for entertaining. I use a mortar and pestle to mash onion with spices and also cut salt to 1/2-3/4 teaspoons. Press firmly into chops on both sides. Simple prep. Discovered tonight this fabulous summer recipe transitions well into autumn too with sides of season-ripe peaches w/cottage cheese and either couscous or parslied noodles. These flavors all together are just awesome!

OK-need to leave a review finally! I used this one a few times now. My husband was not a fan of pork chops UNTIL this recipe and I admit I love it too. I do cut back on the salt to 1/2 tsp. as I find it too salty with 1 tsp. You will want to "grate" the onions instead of chopping since it works better for sticking to chops. I also added a tablespoon olive oil and 1 large clove of minced garlic to paste. I let it marinate for 30 minutes at room temp before grilling. They are delish!!

Wow!Even my mom liked this and she likes old-fashioned midwest food. I have to admit I messed with seasonings. I used Chinese five spice for that sweet spice flavor. I also added a couple TBS's of olive oil to help the mix stick to whatever you're coating. Definitely make the onion like a paste it helps in the sticking. :) I also used the marinade on sweet potatoes that I then grilled. OH MY GOD YUM!

Fabulous flavor & kept the chops quite moist. Fast & Easy! Too spicy for the kids, so I gave them some apple sauce for dipping.

The jerk seasoning was so easy to prepare. I let the chops sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes before grilling. I also added a little more cayenne for that extra kick. Great way to grill chops.

This is the best pork recipe! I have been making this for the past 3 years and have all of my friends and family making them too. I add extra cayanne as I love spicy but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Easy, quick, great-tasting summer recipe! Like many other reviewers, I added a little olive oil and garlic and also a generous squeeze of fresh lime for zip. Reduced cooking time, as I was using boneless loin chops. Served with the Warm Jasmine Rice with Thai Seasonings dish from this site (minus the shrimp and shrimp paste) and a bottle of Blueberry wine from a local vineyard. Loverly.

Absolutely the best pork chop recipe in my opinion as well as my friends and family! I make this all the time, however, I add a little more pepper for some more spice. I usually grill some veggies for my side. Easy and always have the ingredients on hand.

Excellent taste! I added dark rum instead of olive oil, and also garlic along with the onion. Very authentic!

This was amazing! I used powdered onion and substituted a non-MSG meat tenderizer for the salt. Mixed in a little olive oil to make a paste, spread it on both sides of the chops and let them sit 6 hours in the fridge. Pan fried them, the spices stayed on fine. Served them with spicy black beans and Cilantro Slaw. Sorry I only made two chops! Will make this again soon.

This is delicious! Yeah, I had the problem of the paste sticking to the grill (which is why it only got 3 forks instead of 4), but the chops still tasted fantastic. I served mine with Cilantro Coconut Rice, Green Beans with Coriander and Garlic (both recipes from this site) and grilled corn, together with a pitcher of White Sangria. Rave reviews from everyone!

Rating: 4
This spice mix is amazing! I can't eat onions, so I substitute several cloves of finely minced garlic instead. Since garlic is not as moist as onions I add a little olive oil until the mixture has the consistency of thick mustard. You can rub this on the pork and refrigerate the chops/loins for a few hours before grilling. Everyone I have ever served this to has asked for the recipe. I always make extra because the pork makes a fantastic cold sandwich the next day (slice thin, spread some mayo on your favorite bread, add some mixed baby greens---delicious!!). Enjoy!

Rating: 3
This is great and easy, I have made it probably 10 times over the passed two years. Grate the onion instead of chopping it and then mix it with the spices, this gives it a wonderful paste consistancy.

Rating: 4
We processed ingredients (with the addition of garlic) in mini-prep until it had that paste consistency. Slathered on our pork tenderloins and then grilled. Whoa! Can anyone say "More, Please!" - Made with Coconut Rice (from this site) and garnished with Mango Salsa (Barefoot Contessa). Try it!

Very good, maybe not quite a four-fork. I had trouble with the spice getting charred - made it twice.

I'm vegetarian, but I made this for my meat-eating husband who said it was "one of the top three best meals" I have prepared for him! This was so quick, too! I have slaved over other, much more complicated recipes that barely got a mention from my husband!! Not fair that such a simple, quick recipe would impress him so much! :-) I sauteed it in a bit of olive oil rather than grilling, and we didn't have allspice, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Rating: 3
We all liked this including my 8 and 10 year old, although it is a bit spicy. I doubled the recipe as it only called for two chops, and my husband thought I should double the spice again, but I don't think it needed it. I did puree all the ingredients in my food processer, and it was more liquidy than dry - maybe too many onions??? Will do again. Very good, quick, and easy.

This is the only dish my husband will cook ! We love it, he follows the recipe to a T, except for he uses a heavy skillei with a little olive oil in it, get it pipin, hot and sears the heck out of 'em. Careful, it creates a pepper spray effect. Also good on chicken sliced over a salad.

The chopped onion fell off and burned in the grill pan I used. The mix of flavors was good, but what happened with the onions was a bummer. I will not make this recipe again.

The first time I made this recipe, I had very limited time, so I used onion powder instead of regular onion and omitted the allspice because I didn't have any. Rubbed the mixture on the pork chops and let them sit for about 5 minutes. I then grilled them on my George Forman grill for five minutes. Very quick and easy, and if you use onion powder instead, you can make extra to use at another time.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I used a grill pan, and didn't have a problem with the rub falling off (I lost a little, but not enough to be a problem). I used a mortar and pestle to make the paste, perhaps that's why. It makes the paste quite liquid, so it sticks well. I used inch-thick chops due to not reading the recipe carefully enough :^). The chops were pink, but still delicious. If you don't hear from me again, it means I must have succumbed to trichinosis B^D

I baked this dish in the oven. It was very tasty and very easy to make. I have made it several times since. My family likes it too.

I made this recipe for my husband twice now and he raved about it both times. I left the onions out and used the rest of the ingredients to make the rub. I would suggest broiling the chops atop some aluminum foil so that all the spices stay in tact. I'm a vegetarian but I cook for my meat eating, picky husband and he says this is an absolute keeper!

Thought this recipe was too spicy without a lot of underlying, complex flavor, and didn't love it, but hey--I had all the ingredients in my pantry, I combined them in the Cuisinart for fast mixing, and wanted to use a leftover boneless pork chop to take to lunch, so it served its purpose! I made this in a grill pan and like one of the previous reviewers, most of my coating fell off in the pan during cooking. Don't know if I'd make again or not

This was a hit at my house. I didn't have any allspice and so left it out; I also added one clove of garlic. I cut pork sirolin chops (on sale this week) into kabob-size pieces and marinated them with the paste for a couple of hours. I skewered the pork and grilled it on a non-stick grill pan. Very tasty -- I'll use the spice mix again with pork or chicken.

The coating on my pork did not stay on the meat during cooking on my grill and fell off among the ridges of the pan. The flavor was so - so with what seasoning was left on the chops. There's a better jerk/pork recipe in this web site....called Jerk Pork.

Very good! The chops (1.5 inch thick) were perfectly moist, tender and very flavorful. I rubbed the jerk seasoning on the chops and let them sit about two hours before grilling. My 8-year old and his friend, despite the spiciness (I added a little more cayenne), had seconds. Definitely a keeper!

I've been looking for a good jerk sauce ever since Helen's disappeared from the store shelf. I think this nails it! I have tried several other recipes on this site and this is by far the best (others have way too much alspice). One more thing: use a chop that is a good 1" thick, and 4 minutes a side over hot coals will leave it cooked yet juicy and tender.

Tried this for the first time and was quite impressed. This really captures the savory jerk flavors of the caribean. The only thing I might do is hit a little harder with the cayenne as it didn't have quite enough heat for my liking.

Very good! Used more onions for the jerk paste, and 1" pork chops. Was flavorful without being overwhelming. Served with onions & saffron rice with fresh green beans. Roommate loved it! The sauce will be much easier to make now that i've done it once - would be great for chicken or turkey too.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent. The smell reminded me of Jamaica while it was on the grill. I'll certainly make this often.

I gave this a 4 for ease and flavour both. I grated the onion into a bowl which made the spices blend well with the onion and its juice, and it really hung on to the pork chops. I got an "Excellent!" from my spouse when asked how they were. I served these with spiced fried plantains and yellow rice for a real carribean style dinner. I'd do it again for a dinner party with frozen Margaritas to start and a banana creme brulee' for dessert. Yum to the nth power!

This was excellent.I followed the recipe exactly for the spice mixture and rubbed it on two one inch thick butterflied pork loin chops. Both my husband and I loved the flavour. To the cook who found the nutmeg overpowering-perhaps you used pre-grated nutmeg from a bottle. It's denser because it's more packed. I grated my own which creates "fluffier" sort of flakes and probably amounts to less.I didn't notice a pronounced nutmeg flavour.

Could get four stars for the easy factor. I made this on a George Forman grill, and it came out great. I wondered how I would keep the paste on if it were a regular grill, though. Maybe mine wasn't fine enough?

I make this dish quite often, both during the week and for company. It's incredibly good with a better cut of meat. I often buy pork loin chops (1" thick) or pork tenderloin and cut it into medallions, coat both sides and cook for a few minutes each side in a non-stick skillet. I serve it with rice made with light coconut milk, water, scallions, and kidney beans. Yummy!

I'm definitely not the cook in this household, but did make it as a surprise for my boyfriend (the regular cook) and we both thought it was delicious..We both do like spicy food and I even added some red pepper to the rub ..it had a definite kick to it..but not too spicy!! We will definitely use this recipe again!!! (I broiled them instead of using the grill....still very good)

This is a great recipe that I make frequently for my family on the stove-top grill (though I do cut down on the cayenne in deference to the kids). Part of the pleasure is mixing the spices and onions and inhaling the mixture! The chops stay moist even while well browned on the outside. It does create a spectacular mess on the grill, though, as bits of the coating flake off and burn onto the grids. I'll be glad to move the process outside when spring comes.

This is a wonderful recipe for chops. We like hot and spicy food though so I increased the pepper and cayenne. The other spices are very complimentary. I have served these chops with Caribbean Rice and Black Bean salad and Sofrito bread and everyone was blown away!!

Very nice, though I seem to be in the minority when I say I didn't think this was at all spicy. I grilled 3 pork chops, and the seasonings were not enough, I don't think, so next time I'll either double the seasonings, or only make 2 chops as directed. I served these with Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Corn (B.A., July 2000) and black beans.

This is a fantastic recipe! The sugar and onions help to carmelize the chops beautifully. I followed the advice to use less red pepper, as I was cooking for a friend, and the dish was still very spicy. I don't have a grill, so I broiled the chops -- Preheat the broiler, and cook for 5 min. on each side, watching closely.

This was extremely hot. While I found it a bit too much, my husband, who otherwise isn't much of a meat fan, thought it was one of the best things he's ever tasted. Next time I am going to make two versions, one with a bit less cayenne and black pepper for me, and the original for him.

I was worried the seasoning would not "stick" when grilling and the pork chops would be very dry. This did not happen! My only complaint is that the dish was very spicy, I will probably cut down on the red and black pepper next time I make it.

Very easy to make. The spice rub adds an incredible amount of flavor to the meat in a short period of time--as opposed to pre-fab marinades that have to be left on overnight. Cut down the cayenne if you are heat-sensitive, because made according to the recipe, this is a hot one.

This was super delicious and my fiance loved it. However, I made quite a few changes. For example, my fiance hates onions, so I subsituted fresh garlic and minced ginger. Also, I do not have a grill, so I baked the pork loin chops in the oven set to 400 for 20 minutes, then put a skillet with a small pat of butter on high. From there, I rubbed the meat with the seasoning and then pressed the chops face down in the hot skillet for about sixty seconds. I of course repeated this on the opposite side. I served this on a bed of mixed greens tossed with a citrus vinaigrette and sliced mangos. For the side dishes, I whipped up red garlic mashed potatoes, fried bananas and cornbread with carribean spices. This meal was a super hit.

Liked it alot. But, I changed it somewhat. I used 1 medium onion, salt and sugar 1 teaspoon each. All other ingredients I cut in half. And there was plenty of seasonings to cover 4 pork chops. I also used a food processor to blend the seasonings, with a couple drops of water. This keeps the seasonings from sticking to the wall.
