I live in Washington State and thrive on Bing cherries grown in the Yakima Valley which are in every grocery store in my area now. The Rainier Cherry was developed in the 1960s as a pollinator and turned out to have a delicious fruit and was then named for the Cascade mountain. It is not a Queen Anne cherry.

I did not try this recipe, but I have to agree with the cook from Seattle, WA. I am a native who has called Washington state home for 21 years, and would also question the authenticity of this recipe. What were they thinking??

Living in the Northwest for many years myself, I've found the cuisine magnificent. An undiscovered gourmet region. However I cannot help question the authenticity of this recipe. Bing cherries are simply not the local specialty. Rainier Cherries (called Queen Anne Cherries in other parts) would without doubt be the authentic cherry of choice. Knowing this, makes me question the entire recipe.
