I've made this recipe many times over the years with minor changes and to consistent applause. My changes were to decrease the oil to 1/4 cup, increase the lemon by two-fold (plus zest), add extra stock to the pan as needed (make sure it's HOT), and lastly to add all of the vinaigrette to the roasting pan. Gorgeous!

Forgot to mention that I reduced the oil by ½ cup and would reduce to just ½ cup next time...

These were tasty and well received by my guests last night. However, I did alter the recipe somewhat by using tiny dutch baby potatoes cut in half, no broth and only cooked once. Served with the yogurt marinated leg of lamb and grilled zucchini with black olives and mint, both from EPI. Am smashing and sautéeing the leftovers tonight and transforming them into a fritata.

I found there was no need to bake them a second time. 45 minutes was exactly perfect, and I just poured the rest of the marinade on them as they cooled. Served them room temp with grilled branzini on a searing hot day - perfect!

These potatoes were a huge hit. I served it with the Spinach Ricotta Pie I found on epicurious (also delicious). I did need to add about 1/2 a cup more stock after about 30 minutes, but this could be due to my oven's inconsistent temperature. I was out of parsley, but didn't miss it in the end. The vinaigrette is very refreshing and would probably taste great on roasted chicken or tossed with a pasta.

This was awesome. Use the amount of oil the recipe calls for but double up on shallots, lemon zest and garlic. The rest will keep for something else if you dont want to use it all. I used half for the baking and when it was done i set the rest out in a bowl so guests could spoon some on themselves. I wish i made more of this as it was the first dish that was gone at our dinner

This turned out great. It was a very hot day and I didn't want to turn on the oven so I adapted it to the slow cooker! I made the Vinaigrette tossed the potatoes in about 1 1/2 cups and cooked them on high for about 4 hrs. I did not use the chicken stock. Served them with Grilled lamb and Greek salad. Rave reviews from my dinner guests!

Delicious dish. I've made it a couple times now, using 1/2 or less of the recommended oil. It's been a hit for both family dinners and entertaining friends.

This dish was the surprise hit of a Greek Feast I made for friends. I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone was astounded by how delicious these potatoes were. When I offered baggies for folks to take food home, my guests leaped to grab some of this dish. If there were 5 forks, this dish would earn it.

Following others' lead, I lessoned the amount of olive oil called for-and since I cut the rescipe in half, had to eye-ball the rest of ingredients as well. Serving these with Greek chicken roulades...smells good in here, and I think one will compliment the other nicely. Tried a spoonful just to taste, and they really are quite good.

Was drawn to this recipe because it is from one of my favorite restarants in SF, Kokkari. It is fabulous, so very good. Follow what others have said too about limiting the olive oil quantity - only really need about 1/3 of what the recipe calls for for the marinade. Truly an exceptional side dish.

I used 1/4 of the olive oil and left out parsley and shallots. Simple but delicious.

These were wonderful. I served them with the Pork Gyros on this site. I did cut the oil to only 1/2 cup. Also, I did not use the chicken broth. No need. I will be making these again.

My family loved this dish. I changed a few things. I used Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into cubes. I poured the olive oil over them, squeezed the juice of a lemon and then sprinkled the oregano, shallots, salt and pepper but saving the parsley for last before serving. I added black seedless whole Greek olives also--not canned though. You can buy these olives at many groceries now--fresh in oil by the lb. They are wonderful roasted. I used 350 degrees on a convection roast oven setting because I was also roasting a chicken at the same time. The cubes were a great way to roast them and crisp them at the same time and cut the cooking time and temperature. I left out the chicken stock and it was not missed. My dish was savory and I did not need to use any olive oil dressing after they were cooked. It was not needed, the potatoes were well oiled during the cooking and there was oil in the bottom of the pan. I did not use a cookie sheet because I thought they'd dry out so I used a Le Creuset oval baking dish.

For starters, I'd recommend red or gold (rather than russet) potatoes; I cut mine lengthwise into sixths. Leave out the parsley (or cilantro, which works equally well) - it will turn black in the hot oven; instead, reserve 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette and add the parsley or cilantro to the reserved vinaigrette, then drizzle this over the potatoes before serving them. Dredge the potatoes through the vinaigrette in the bowl (rather than drizzling vinaigrette over them in the pan), then place them cut-side down in the shallow baking pan, and put them in a 425 degree oven. Skip the chicken stock - there's plenty of moisture in the potatoes and vinaigrette. After about 25 minutes, take the pan from the oven and turn the potatoes so the second cut side is down (there will be enough vinaigrette in the pan to keep them from sticking) and return to the oven. Reduce the heat to 375 and cook for another 20 minutes or so (total of about 45 minutes) - they'll be nice and golden on both cut sides, and should be perfectly cooked and moist and puffy on the inside. Drizzle the reserved vinaigrette with parsley or cilantro over the potatoes before serving. (I suggest that you also use more lemon juice, depending on how many potatoes you use and how much you like lemon, of course.) These are relatively easy to prepare and cook, the recipe can be scaled for any size party, and they're tasty! Definitely added to my repertoire.

Delicious! Mind you, I don't see the reasoning behind saving 1/2 of the vinaigrette to pour over the potatoes after baking. A drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper would've been enough.

listened to the others and cut the oil in half, but next time will cut the oil even further. i used a small amount of water instead of broth (having none) and they came out great. very brown and crisp, yum! i am not a big potato person, but i went back for thirds.

I'm not sure where these potatoes have been all my life. Delicious. I followed suggestions and cut the oil by half, but I would probably cut it even futher in the future, because they were still sitting in oil after lots of stirring and an hour in the oven. Other than that, wonderful!

WAY TOO MUCH oil. I used 1/2 the oil and the rest as per the recipe. Still have quite a bit of the vinaigrette left, which won't go to waste, it's very good. The potatoes: YUMMY.

Great success, with following changes. Used about 6-7 pounds of quartered potatoes, and only about half the dressing during the baking. THe potatoes were slightly on the oily side when they came out of the oven. Did not add extra dressing.

Great recipe. I use half the oil though. I've also used fresh Rosemary instead of the oregano. Nice change.

Oh, and I just drizzled them with oil, rather than using the large amount called for in the recipe. (I forgot to add this in my review.)

I used small new potatoes, halved. I roasted them cut side down, cut the cooking time in half, and did not turn them. They crisped up nicely in the rewarming step, even with the chicken broth that other cooks had chosen to delete.

I used only about 1 cup oil, and this was the right proportion, but it produced more vinaigrette than needed at the end. I also added the grated zest from the lemon. The potatoes were delicious. My husband said they were the best potatoes I ever made.

Loved these. Made 1/2 recipe of oil and added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the oil. Also sliced the potatoes and roasted on parchment paper.

I should have read the reviews again before I made this dish. I used the amount of oil suggested since it was for a special occasion and although it was very good, I just couldn't bring myself to drizzle with the rest of the vinaigrette before serving. This is a great way to cook potatoes, but you do not have to use all the oil. I will use this method again to cook with other flavourings besides Greek. And it does work to make them ahead of time exactly as suggested.

Loved it. I cheated and used some dry Italian seasonings and increased the garlic. It was great with shrimp for a light midweek lunch.

I used 1/2 cup oil and increased the chicken broth. I also didn't reserve any vinaigrette to toss the potatoes in once cooked. It was still absolutely outstanding and just like the potatoes served at Mr. Greek (but better!). Terrific with the lamb with oregano.

I used just 1/4 cup of oil and quartered whole onions........it smell wonderful in the oven and we all oved it. I will do my potatoes this way many times!

This was a big hit. I marinated the spuds in a plastic bag, and placed them in an aluminum tray. I then placed it on the bar B.with a little of the liquid. I did however add lemon zest, and red pepper flakes to kick it up. We will do this again

Delicious recipe - Nice to be able to do the potatoes ahead of time leaving the oven free for the roast or whatever to cook. The smell as the potatoes are cooking just filled the whole kitchen. Will definitely make this again.

Although I've given this recipe only one fork I'll probably make it again as the recipe on the whole is fine. The drawbacks: it was way too oily, as the former reviewer stated, and the last step of cooling the potatoes and rewarming them for 15 minutes was in my case an absolute disaster. They were completely dried out and hardened, not fit to eat. I quickly had to make some rice instead. The thing is, in my opinion, to use a little less chicken stock and forget about the rewarming, that way they'll probably be okay. I'll try this the next time.

As I baked the potatos I added more chicken stock to the cookie sheet. This made the potatos more tasty and tender. I would probably add a bit more lemon juice to the vinegrette too. I really loved these potatos. Wonderful.

Nice flavor...I took the advice of other reviewers and left out chicken broth. Result was crispy potatoes with great flavor.

The potatoes were absolutely fabulous. I used 1/3 oil as suggested and used the specified amount of lemon in the vinaigrette, but then added more lemon juice to the potatoes while they were cooking. Also cut back on the amount of chicken stock. The potatoes were soft, browned and the perfect blend of flavours. Everyone loved them...I suggest serving them with lemon marinaded chicken in pita's! Almost as good as my favourite greek restaurant! Thanks!

So I cut the olive oil way back, and these potatoes were a mushy mess, though tasty. I usually get crisp, brown roasted potatoes with only a couple Tablespoons of oil, I think adding the stock did the damage.

I followed the advice of a previous cook and significantly reduced the oil (1/3 c. oil & 1/2 c. lemon juice with water). The potatoes were very good. Next time, I will use more lemon juice. The potatoes were great with the Rack of Lamb with carmelized shallot and thyme crust.

Been looking for this recipe for a while. Authentic tasting, in fact, very similar to the spuds served in our favourite fine Greek restaurants. I cut back the oil as recommended by others, and cooked them a little hotter and a little longer. Next time I would double the lemon juice too.

CUT DOWN ON THE OIL. That screamed, it is a wonderful dish. I perhaps cook the potatoes a tad longer to make them browner. Perks up a simple roast chicken or chops.

There's too much oil. Way too much oil. I have an excellent recipe which is cooked in the same fashion (takes about 90 min give or take, turning potatos every 20), that calls for 3lbs potatos, 1/3c olive oil, 1/2c lemon juice and 3c water, which is MUCH better. I liked the idea of adding shallots, though.

This recipe is similar to one that appeared in the January 1994 issue of Bon Appetit (and which quickly became a family favorite of ours). I'll stick with the earlier recipe--I found 1 1/2 cups of olive oil to be excessive.

It's funny how people's ovens are different temperatures. I always set mine at 25° less than the recipe calls for, but my potatoes were still too brown. I think my oven is getting hotter with age. Anyway, they were delicious - I've always adored them in Greek restaurants and now I can duplicate them - excellent!

We loved these. These would be wonderful for company because they can be made ahead. Unlike former reviewer, ours were brown and crisp in the 45 minutes. I only made half the vinagrette recipe (but used fewer potatoes) and there was more than enough.

Everybody loved them. They took longer to brown than the recipe said...an extra half hour.
