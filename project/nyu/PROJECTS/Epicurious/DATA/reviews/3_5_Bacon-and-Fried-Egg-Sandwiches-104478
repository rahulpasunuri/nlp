It is still a good sandwich after 9 years. Made it for a late breakfast the day before Mother's Day. The reviews are still great to read. New addtion would be Chipotle Ranch dressing. Yes, it is ...SO GOOD!

OK - truth in reviewing time: I haven't made this, and truly wondered why anyone needed a recipe, etc. Then, as I always do, I began reading the reviews - what a hoot! When I reached the end of then-92, I realized that I had to send the whole thing on to my best friend and my daughter. I even considered sending to my ex, who seemed to enjoy my version of this soul- satisfying bit of comfort (toasted Eng. muffins, white extra sharp Cheddar melted over the eggs fried in butter - and let some of the melted cheese brown in the cast iron pan, and mayo on both sides of the muffins; no vegetables inside the sammy, and no bacon 'cause he's vegetarian). And yes, we had them for a weeknight supper, watching the News Hour. Of course, all that was in the days before calories counted!

SO GOOD! Fried egg sammies are my go-to hang over food (egg,cheese if I'm lucky, bread and ketchup)- so this was a revelation. I didn't have arugala so I substituted red leaf lettuce and leftover beets slices thin, also added a little cheddar. A glass of white wine rounded it out for dinner. SO GOOD

This was all so much fun. It made my day to read it! I make fried/poached eggs every Saturday morning for a treat and top it off with fresh salsa. Tip for the eggs: use real butter and brown edges, then add a small glass of water, pop on lid and simmer until the eggs have a thin film over the yolks. Guaranteed runny and perfect. Better cooks than I have always requested this. A gourmet cook is only a gourmet if they look a recipe in the eye and don't flinch. And nobody should flinch from something so good.

I always read the reviews first, and these really cracked me up. True, you probably don't need a recipe since it sounds easy and everyone tends to make changes to their own tastes, but why get mad? I don't know about the recipe, but this one definately gets 4 forks for the most reviews!

Good recipe... something different. Try it when you have people over, they appreciate the variety. Take the time to read all the reviews (esp. the early ones). All the great chefs out there poking fun at the "egg sandwhich" recipe but they all clicked the link. Why? Because they thought they might learn something different. I've eaten at all of your houses (or people like you). I've got news for you, most of you can't cook. As for my counterpart below me. You aren't funny and your probably from upstate.

My grandma used to make egg sandwiches with sweet mustard. Brings back good memories of everything food should be, a vital function for us everyday janes (bravo, Epicurious!) OK, I confess -- I'm a working girl (newlywed so the internal pressure in on) with aspirations to gourmet but not a heck of a lot of time (and, like some other reviewers, can be intimidated by unpronounceable ingredients that are tough to find). It's finding the warm comfy old-slippers side -- along with the heated debate between old-slippers types like me and food snobs who've lost their perspective of what good eats is all about -- that is inspiring in the sense of really enjoying food with those around you, not just vying for the most difficult, unpronounceable, inventive or impressive dish to brag about. I'll have to try the raspberry jam version, too -- Monte Cristo is another warm memory food :)

I made this wonderful sandwich using sourdough bread for my husband and myself - it is comfort food all the way, we loved every bite. And I made the salad and hashbrowns, too!! I just didn't feel like making something with 25 ingredients and standing over the stove for two hours after painting the bedroom!! Thanks, epicurious, for reminding me of one of my favorites meals. Many years ago we used to play bridge, then at midnight, quit and make fried egg sandwiches with ketchup which we would eat along with a glass of red wine - heavenly!!

The arugula is great with the bacon. For breakfast next time I'll omit the mustard and add cheese. The mustard makes it taste like a lunch sandwich good with a glass of wine or a nice cold beer.

There's nothing wrong with this recipe. If you want a real hoot, watch "Great Chefs" on The Discovery Channel. Recently they have shown (I am not making this up) Llama medallions, Opakapaka, Ahi, Onaga, and oh yes, Antlope tenderloin with fresh Rhubarb. My Llama dealer was expecting a shipment next Wednesday.

What is up with those snobs wo turned their nose without trying? Like they don't own worn jeans/baggy sweats to wear for comfort, not looks. That's what this recipe is for, to enjoy the taste, isn't that what cooking is all about? Anyway, the sandwich is good, either with sweet mustard or plain old yellow (with dash of Tabasco). And if you don't like runny eggs like me, try them scrambled. Read the list of review if you have time for a few laughs.

The sandwich is great---The reviews are even better! I tried this recipe twice last week once with the suggested Red Raspberry jam, (YUMMY, reminds me of a Monte Christo sandwich). Also with Honey Mustard, bacon, Jarlsburg cheese, runny egg and english muffin. A easy sub for Eggs Benedict. My husband said it tasted like Brennan's in New Orleans. Don't miss reading the long list of reviews. Theyare priceless. I LOVE THIS SITE... MAY IT LIVE FOR EVER IN CYBERSPACE....

I modified the recipe by replacing the egg with a slice of fresh roast turkey. Then I added mayo. Great sandwich!!! I would (and will) make it again.

I thought the arugula was a nice addition to the sandwich, giving it a bit of kick. This breakfast sandwich was really easy to make & my husband really liked it. Would definitely make it again. The egg tastes better when it's not overcooked and the yolk still oozes out a bit.

Rating: 3
'k, after reading the reviews, I couldn't let this drop. WAY too funny. Actually, I rated it three stars instead of four, because I don't think arugula belongs on the same plate as bacon and a fried egg. And I really prefer mayo. I mean, I go for it! Carry on!

Just had to let everyone know. FoodTv has a fried egg sandwich. They use Canadian bacon. Who woulda thought? It's in the Irish recipes. We Irish steal anything.

Well Bruce may be right. Like a mountain, I had to try it because it was there. Didn't use arugula, & might have missed the point of it all. Just used leaf lettuce. On my second sandwich, I put a slice of swiss cheese. That made it really a nice sandwich.

I make on average 2 or 3 recipes a week I have never tried before (yes many gourmet), however my kids get sick of new different recipes all the time and a good old bacon / egg fried sandwich is a welcomed meal. (and I don't have to listen to the "mom is making something wierd again")

Fantastic Recipe! Really creative. For a full meal, I served this with Kool-Aid which I really spiced up by using bottled water - not water out of the tap! To make my revamped Kool-Aid mixture even more unique, I added crushed, instead of cubed, ice. What a treat! If my family ever comes home, I plan to make special meals like this for them more often. I can't wait for next month's buttered toast recipe!

My husband, who has never cooked before and has always been intimidated to try, actually picked up my cooking magazine when he saw this recipe. He went out, bought all of the ingredients and made me a really great sandwich. It's certainly not something I would have thought to make if it hadn't been for this recipe. And who knows what my husband might try now. It deserves 4 forks just for that.

All of these reviews have missed the mark. The one that got my attention was the insulting comment about Miracle Whip! We've just ended the Christmas season with all the jokes about poor harmless fruitcake (I seem to be the only one in America who truly appreciates this treat), and now I have to deal with cracks about my beloved Miracle Whip. Eggs, bacon, cheese and bread - who cares? As long as it has Miracle Whip, it has to be good. Next you'll be slamming Kraft Macaroni and cheese. Sheesh!

I've made this recipe hundreds of times and it gets better each time. Anyway I whole heartedly agree that the best was the "big yellow holiday smile". That cook should have his/her own TV show. Thank god my office is in a sound proof area - I'm sure the others would have been banging down my door wondering what the heck is going on in here. Oh the tears I shed from the laughter - it was great! And poor Paul - I feel for him.

An egg sandwich is always a good treat on a weekend morning. (Who has the time on weekdays?) Anyway, drop the arugula (which is often impossible to find at a regular grocery in my area); add a slice of Kraft Old English cheese and sprinkle with McCormick's Dried Italian herbs. And, of course, the sandwich always tastes better if someone else makes it and serves it to you in bed!

I am someone who doesn't know how to cook well and am intimidated by most of the recipes listed here and in other recipte sites. I greatly appreciate the more "basic" recipes when they do show up.

I understand that Epicurious is trying to reach a very broad range of tastes and abilities, and appreciate their efforts to accommodate us all.

Thanks everyone -- for the laughs and for bringing this interesting sounding recipe to my attention. I probably would have past right on by, but, thanks to Paul's and everyone else's comments, I noticed it. Not only did my kids stop bickering to come over to see why mom was laughing while looking at recipes, but now I've got a new spin on a bacon and egg sandwich to try. Thanks for the few moments of amusement and for reminding me how good a bacon and egg "sammich" can be!

Honest to God - the best egg sandwich ever - break 2 eggs into a frying pan sizzling with melted butter; pop the yolks and flip; lightly salt and pepper. When done, put on white bread (something really soft and white - like Wonder. Yum Yum! And if you're really adventurous, try Heinz dill pickles, sliced hard-boiled egg, and mayonaise (no light or fat-free goulash) on white. I dare you!

As not having made this cool version of a fried egg sandwich yet, and getting curious about the reviews, I read all of them. I have just come into this web site and I love it. I am a chef and am in a catering type of business, one of which I prepare meals and deliver them into the home. I change my menus weekly and am always in search of new twist and concepts. This was just another twist of an old favorite and if you love honey mustard and arugula, then you would probably like it on an egg "sanich." Now for me this used to happen at 3:00 am. Fried egg, cheese, ketchup on an english muffin or bread. The best kind of absorbing food stuff ever!!! To the person that griped about having this with salad and a dessert for breakfast was off based, becaused it was suggested for a supper, go back and read it again. I agree with all of the positive readers and food adventureres in this site. It is concepts old and new, mixed with imagination an creativity, and the desire and courage to try new ideas and share with others!! As for Paul, what is up with that email address, you just defined your character!

Rating: 3
I love fried egg sandwiches, and I am open to new ideas. I didn't much care for the arugula, but the honey mustard was nice. If anyone is looking for another variation, my family makes it with english muffins, toasted and spread with a little butter and raspberry jam, fried egg (runny yolk) with cheese and bacon. SO good, the jam adds the sweet factor to contrast with the salty bacon - an observation that another cook noted - try it!

Why not cook your bacon the English way. A thick slice of smoked bacon cooked so that it is still flexible, then a still runny egg,,broken and left to soak into the bread for a couple of minutes before eating. When in England on holiday look for a roadside caravan with lorries parked beside it and pull in and order a bacon and egg sandwich. This is GOOD English food.

Las Vegas, I think you missed the point of "A Cook"'s joke (12/22/00). And Cincinnati, you are too funny. This sandwhich is fabulous.

Reading these "reviews" sure gave me a laugh. And if Paul's last entry was actually a serious one, then it's even funnier. Chicago said it best. Why do all the "cheerleaders" feel the need to personally harangue any criticism that enters their domain? We don't all like bacon and egg sandwichs on focaccia with arugula and mustard. I like mine on a warm brioche with watercress and sun-dried tomato spread. Gee, maybe I should write for Goourmet magazine.

To the reader from "America"-- give us a break! Americans are as diverse from each other as people can be. Admonishing the B.A. staff for using "foreign influence" is ridiculously amusing. What, pray tell, is wrong with foccacia? If the recipe was created using good ol' "American" Wonder Bread, people would have griped (more than they have been) that the recipe was even less sophisticated. Because all our tastes are unique, I must say that I thought this recipe was great, honey mustard and all. I think some attitudes here are what call for the "Ecckh"!

To all those cooks who read the percentages; please ignore the 89% will make it again.

While I'm not a mustard fan, I'll try this, just because I love bacon and egg sandwiches (and breakfast food for dinner is the best!) To all you folks who consistently bash the recipes, please try to keep your criticism constructive, or don't bother!

This is fantastic. What's not to like? Still, thank you, Epicurious, for reminding ALL OF US what a wonderful treat this kind of pumped-up simple food can be.

This recipe is simple and delicious; however I'm disappointed in the reviews from some other readers. I'm sure that Epicurious has a broad range of readers; from school-trained professional chefs to newlyweds to harried college students. Not every recipe has to be an intricate production to generate rave reviews. A recipe such as this can be prepared by a college student trying to win the heart of a young maiden; a nervous bride entertaining guests on her first holiday; or the recent widower learning to cook his own meals ... Please folks, let's not be so narrow-minded, critical, and self-serving. If such a recipe is 'beneath you'; please remember that it may do wonders for someone else. For me, it's a sensational combination of an old childhood favorite and a now mature palate. Happy holidays to all...

I haven't made this yet but YIKES, what's up with some of you. Talk about critics. It's fun to try something with a little different twist. That's what recipes are all about isn't it. Most of what we make has been made many times before but with a different addition or two. We like that usually don't we? Why are you looking at Epicurious if you don't want updates of some things we've made before? As several others have said "Get a Life", don't take things sooo seriously.

I for one, had a homemade fried egg sandwich this morning, and will be brave enough to try arugula, foccacia, and honey mustard the next time! The name of this site is epiCURIOUS. Have all these members lost there inquisitiveness, inventiveness, or interest in trying something new? I have to agree with the member that said some of these posts are really shameful. What's the matter with publishing such a recipe? There are THOUSANDS of recipies published in books, posted on the web, etc., for all sorts of "comfort food with a twist". Some of you critics (that haven't even taken the time to even MAKE this recipe) probably swoon over watching star chefs prepare something as humble as mashed potatoes!

Rating: 3
Whoa, settle down there...... I don't see anything wrong with improving on old recipes, especially humble ones. Take something like a BLT, a simple things that can be terrible (powderpuff bread, cheap bacon, Miracle Whip, supermarket tomatoes and lettuce) or a marvel (great sourdough bread, home grown tomatoes and lettuce, homemade mayo, thick cut smoked bacon, a few shavings of good paremsan, etc). Why not do it well instead of just slapping something together? I think the honey mustard is a great idea, and although I'd rather use baby spinach than arugula, either would add a nice dimension.

The muffin is a good twist and I like your writer's idea of cheese, again especially if afew spinkles of blue cheese are used too...

This is a super recipe for an old basic. For years we have been making BELTS. Bacon, Egg, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwiches as a comfort food. The addition of Foccaccia or English Muffin makes it even better. We also sometimes add cheese which makes it a BELTCH... Lighten up and have a happy holiday.
