Not a lot of flavor. Though the garlic toasts were good.

Delicious. My husband loved it. I too added oregano and basil.

The recipe is basically very good, but by adding five leaves of fresh basil,coarsely chopped, and a touch of fresh oregano, also coarsely chopped; the flavor is greatly improved. A sprinkling of hot, red pepper flakes is also an asset.
