This was yummy, but I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I used three very small homegrown scallions and about 10 oz of enchilada sauce (red from Trader Joe's). I used leftover corn meal muffins with jalapenos from a Dr. Oetker box mix (the corn bread pudding was much better than the corn meal muffins by themselves). I used chicken broth. Also, after 40 minutes of cooking, the egg whites were still raw so we cooked for about an extra half hour and it was just right. We grilled some chicken and ate alongside the pudding. Husband liked it, too! Next time I would add some black beans.

This was excelent and will be a regular menu item at our house. My husband loved it and so did my Dad. I cheated and used Jiffy instant corn muffins rather than making the corn bread from corn meal. I will try it with real corn bread next time and I'm sure it will be even better. Easy to prepare, makes a lot, enjoyed by all.

This is one of those recipes that you just have to make once or twice and then you never need the recipe again. Easy and good. You can improvise or add ingredients to the basic recipe for variety. Although the recipe is like a strata, it's not as eggy. I use Bob's Red Mill medium grind cornmeal for the cornbread, and it makes a very crunchy cornbread. The texture in the final result is great. Husband loves it.

Use the previous corn bread recipe to ensure proper degree of savoryness and moisture. This is amazing, especially when you add chopped (raw) chicken to make it into a main course.

We love this recipe-- it's got a little kick to it and nicely compliments southwestern/mexican dishes. Reheats well. Very easy to prepare.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I loved it and so did my family and guests. I made it exactly how the recipe reads and wouldn't change a thing.

This was excellent and quite filling. I'll make it again when I have a crowd to feed.

Although I haven't tried this yet I have to comment about the problems some of the other reviewers had. There is actually a recipe called "Dry corn bread for Mexican corn bread pudding" that is displayed several recipes down from this one. If you use that recipe for the bread, I doubt you would have too much liquid and as I recall there is very little (if any) sugar called for.

It was a nice change of pace from the old standard cornbread. It also worked well as a side dish.

Great way to use left over corn bread. I added some shredded chicken to make it a one dish meal. Next time I'll add some onions & garlic to balance out the sweetness of the corn bread.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and it was a hit. My husband LOVED it. It was a little dry, so I added more broth and more cheese. Next time I make it I will add more diced red bell pepper and olives. It's even better the next day!

This dish was really good -- and different! I made one premixed package of cornbread and reduced all the ingredients by half. This was the perfect amount for a side dish for a party of six. I served this with chicken enchiladas and a black bean vinagrette. A big hit!!

What did I do wrong? I most certainly did not have a dryness issue - mine had too much liquid!!! I gave this recipe one fork because the texture and appearance were awful. The taste was fine - but we couldn't get over the liquid texture.

Yum! I used the El Torito sweet corn cake mix for the corn bread. Turned out great! Rave reviews.

This recipe is great! I paired it up with the chicken enchilada recipe and they were a great duo. I used canned corn and and I only dried the cornbread for a half-hour to minimize risk of the pudding being too dry as other cooks noted. This "pudding" was very moist and flavorful! This dish was very tasty, but it makes A TON, so invite many friends or be prepared for left overs for a few nights.

This was a bit dry the way it it written. The next time I made it, I substituted my homemade vegetarian green chile (pureed for consistency) because I like it better than enchilada sauce. I use plenty of garlic and peppers (I even add a few habaneros!) I also added a bit more cheese, and used Jack, Cheddar, and jalapeno cheese. I suggest tweaking this to suit your taste.

Good. Rather bland and slightly dry, but I would make it again. It's a good filler to use instead of rice.
