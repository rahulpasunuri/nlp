I was pleasantly surprised that something so easy would taste so delicious. Did find I needed to rinse off salt as duck breasts I used were smaller than called for. Wonderful on a buffet table paired with cheeses, liver mousse and edamame hummus also in the December issue.

Delicious and easy! Was unsure how this would turn out so only used one 1/2# duck breast and reduced remaining ingredients accordingly. I found that we did have to rinse when done to remove extra salt; after rinsing, place uncovered on a rack in refrigerator for a few hours to dry.

We had our doubts about this recipe since most duck prosciutto recipes call for a period time of 'hanging' the breast. But it worked perfectly!
