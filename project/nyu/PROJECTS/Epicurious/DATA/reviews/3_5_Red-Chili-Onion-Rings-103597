I made these to have before dinner. I liked the flavor and it could have used more coating. I like the idea of pairing these with steak. I'll try that next time.

This recipe was reprinted in Bon Appetit's March 06 issue using buttermilk instead (and which then led me to the fantastic buttermilk pancakes recipe to use up the leftover BM). Anyway, I'm unfortunately still looking for THE perfect onion ring; as deliciously flavored as these were to go with steak and salad, I would prefer a batter that really sticks to the onion. I was also very glad to be at the end of the oil's life in my fryer -- the seasonings on these would have been found afterwards in anything else I would have made.

I enjoyed the flavors of this recipe but I also had problems with the batter sticking to the onions, by the end of the batch barely any of the batter was on the onion ring, any suggestions on how I can fix that?

Good flavor. I used ground roasted Ancho chiles. I may experiment with other chiles.

Delicious!! Will definitely make these again.

I made these rings because I didn't have any other recipe on hand - boy were we surprised! The usual heavy batter wasn't missed at all. Commenting on one of the reviews below - I didn't think my flour was "sticking" as I was cooking, either - but the end result was just right!

These onion rings are the perfect partner for grilled sirloin steaks, blackened catfish or slow cooked cajun ribs. Perfect summertime fare or a winter treat.

We liked that these didn't have a heavy batter. Thought they were excellent!

This was a nice change as compared to the usual battered up onions. I made it along with the chili-rubbed steaks and saffron garlic potatoes and it was really wonderful. The home made chile mix is amazing and I'll be using that in other recipes.

These onion rings had a great flavor, even with using different chilis, but the coating did not stick to the onions. Halfway through I tried adding the milk to the spices to make a batter, but that didn't work either. I will use the flavor combination again, but not the technique.

What a surprise! These onion rings were delicious with a grilled steak and the garlic mashed potatoes (divine) which were also in the same menu. I had to substitute regular chili powder for the homemade in the recipe and they were still good.
