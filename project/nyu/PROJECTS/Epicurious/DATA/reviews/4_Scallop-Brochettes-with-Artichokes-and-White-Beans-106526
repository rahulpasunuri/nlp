Just made this, and I cannot believe I am the first to review. The combination of white beans, artichoke hearts, and scallops are PERFECT. While paring the chokes takes a while, the process is somewhat therapeutic and the results so worth the time. I served a puddle of beans surrounding a large choke, cradling the scallops. I added leeks to the mirepoix-ish mixture for the beans, and I ended up wrapping the scallops with prosciutto to make the dish substantial enough for supper. I used canned beans, and secretly skipped the vinaigrette and just deglazed pan with white wine for a bit of a sauce. But the directions here are sound, and I recommend other Epi readers give them a try- it's about time!
