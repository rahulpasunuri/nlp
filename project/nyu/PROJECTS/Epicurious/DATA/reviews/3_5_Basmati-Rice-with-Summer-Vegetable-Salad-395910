I just made this, tonight! I think the flavor hinges on that line in the recipe that calls for the "leafy greens, sprouts and herbs"..herbs being the operative word. I grow fresh herbs and added a mix of about 3 T of fresh parsley, cilantro, mint, melon sage and lettuce basil in equal amounts. Spectacular! The herbs add a ton of flavor and really add what you need to the salad. I did also add garlic to the dressing. It's only as good as the cooks discrimination!

I varied the recipe somewhat to go with what I had...and my grocery store did not have fresh thyme so I had to use dried. Even with some tweaks, my husband and I LOVED this...it is very delicious and something I will definitely make again. Love all the freshness of the veggies with the rice and the dressing. It was so good, and next time I'll use fresh thyme.

I made this as a side with tacos. I used regular white rice and chose the freshes veggies from the farmers market to include sweet corn, zuchini, and 3 peppers. EXCELLENT! I would definitely make it again. My "cook" book group loved it. I used all the dressing and I thought it had plenty of flavor.

Very bland. The crunchiness of the vegetables also is a little strange with the texture of the soft rice. I needed to mix the entire dressing into the dish and I still felt like it needed more flavor. I ate this because it was reasonably healthy and I had used good summer squash, arugula and tomatoes in it, but I would not make it again.

This is my CSA saver! Whenever I have extra vegetables left at the end of the week, I know I can just throw this together. I add two cloves of garlic to the puree because I love it a little garlicky. :)

i made this as written, but on the advice of a previous reviewer i added a garlic clove to the dressing. it wasstill bland. i added minced ginger and lime zest. still bland, but better. added extra salt and pepper. extra lime zest. some lime juice. it was ok. i don't think i'd make it again, there are too many other new recipes to try.

This one is added to my summer list of "go to recipes." Very light and fresh. I added tomatoes, sprouts, kale and peas, but it is nice that you can add whatever is in season. The rice recipe in prep school was great. It can definitely hold the dressing and could have used a little extra kick, so I might take the prior reviewer's recommendation next time around.

I made this to accompany flank steak & green salad. I used carrots, radishes, orange pepper, vidalla onion and the rest the same. I made the rice per the instructions at the back of the magazine- superb. It needed a little kick- I would add garlic next time and possible ginger?
