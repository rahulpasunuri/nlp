This is one of the best pizza's i have ever had....oddly. I don't know what the difference between white and black truffle oil is but i only had the black and this was the oil i used. It seemed like a lot of chees and mushrooms for the pizza....but it worked....we thought it was amazing :o)

OMG this is the best pizza I have ever had! I get requests to bring this to every potluck, serve it as an appetizer when I'm entertaining, and make it for my husband for a quick weeknight meal. This is easily his favorite dinner! I use shiitake mushrooms because they have more flavor. Do not skip the truffle oil, it makes the dish. Truffle oil is expensive (about $15 for 8 oz), but it will last you 6 months

This is my favorite pizza recipe. Don't pass on the truffle oil--it's what makes the pizza special. Truffle oil is expensive, but it's used sparingly, so it will last. It gives scrambled eggs or omelets richness. A little in mashed potatoes will take them to a new level.

Really delicious and easy. I sauteed my mushrooms ahead of time and added a little minced garlic to them. Chopped parsley is a nice finishing touch.

Delicious! Thought I had parchment paper but discovered I was out so I used an All Clad double griddle that has a very dark non-stick surface. I pre-heated the oven to 490, put the dough in for about 5 minutes, took it out, laid the mushrooms in a single layer, sprinkled TBSP of kosher salt and some pepper, laid the cheese and cooked for 10 minutes. It came out perfect. I almost sauteed the mushrooms but glad I didn't as they were well cooked from the high heat. The crust was very crisp - about 1 minute from burning. I'm indifferent on the truffle oil. I like truffle oil but I think this would be fine with or without and my wife agreed. Found the Taleggio cheese at Whole Foods and it was very tasty. Next time I might do some sweet onions and skip the truffle oil. All in all a great recipe.

This was incredible. So simple. I couldn't find Taleggio, so subbed in Fontina, per the recipe instructions. Who would have thought 4 simple ingredients could be so good. One of our new favorites! BTW, if you love pizza or flatbread try the Asparagus and fingerling potato pizza and the Cherry tomato pizza Margherita, both also on this site. To die for - all three of these!

OMG! this is so good. Simple, quick and the flavor is fabo!! I made this in my small baking sheet with refrigerated pizza dough. I usually buy the thin crust but Ralph's didn't have it. The regular, even if you spread it thin, comes out thicker than I like. I did turn the oven down to 375 to bake the pizza and didn't do the parchment step. The crust was nice and crispy not at all soggy or soft..

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe. Taleggio, truffle and mushroom. What's not to like?

This was very yummy but it didn't blow me away. I couldn't find Taleggio cheese so I used the recipe recommended Fontina. I also sauteed the mushrooms first (I used baby bellas) and I don't think I would have liked it had I put them on the pizza raw. The other diners all liked it and agreed that it's better than the average mushroom pizza but no one raved about it.

OMG!! This was so incredible!! I used dried and rehydrated porcinis. I soaked them for 30 minutes and patted them very dry using multiple paper towels, then chopped them coarsely and put them on a premade cornmeal crust from Vicolo which is made in the San Francisco area, which I had previously drizzled with Napa Valley Oil Company EVOO (a true find and staple in my kitchen). I added a little freshly ground black pepper and sea salt and then baked in the middle of a preheated oven at 475 on a cookie sheet for about 20 minutes until the taleggio and crust were golden brown. No truffle oil was available in my larder but really not necessary with the intense flavor of the porcinis melding perfectly with the equally large flavor of the telaggio. Will make it again later this weekend for my boyfriend. He will devour it!!

I think this is my favorite pizza recipe ever (second to the Three-Cheese Pizza with Pancetta and Mushrooms, on this site). I followed other reviewers' advice and sauteed the mushrooms first in oil, then set the oven temp to 450 rather than 500. I also oiled the parchment paper after one reviewer complained that the pizza stuck to it. The parchment burned horribly, but the pizza lifted off like a dream, and was a little burn-y on the bottom, which made it even more delicious. I can't wait to make this again!

I was a little scared that 500 degrees was going ot burn this dish, but it actually dried out the mushrooms perfectly in very little time. This was delicious- - I cant believe they put truffle oil as optional -- its a necessity in my book! Amazingly good.

awesome flavors, but definitely do the pizza without the parchment paper. the recipe didn't say anything about oiling parchment paper and when i followed the recipe exactly, the parchment paper was completely stuck to the pizza so we had to throw it out :( but the flavors are great - we will definitely try again, minus the parchment paper :)

Outstanding and decadent beyond belief. Can't say enough good things!

This is great! To make it 4 Forks i do the following: Substitute Truffle Cheese (from Trader Joe's)and add: Chopped cooked pancetta When finished i add a tiny bit of truffle salt - wonderful!

This is a go to recipe for any pizza lover. I like it with Quattro Formaggio and grilled as opposed to baked. See it at http://eruditeeater.blogspot.com/2009/07/grilled -pizza.html

Make sure mushrooms don't overlap otherwise the pizza can get soggy. I also didn't need to use all the cheese. Nice flavours.

Was okay, but I feel like some of the cooking specifications were a little off. The plain pizza dough got a little too golden at the 3 minute mark, so definitely keep a close eye on that. My pizza came out way too soggy, and I had even sauteed the mushrooms before that. I blame the cheese quantity. Use about half a pound. All in all, a good pizza. I'd make it again so I could improve from my mistakes. I'm thinking it could also benefit from a light pesto sauce underneath?

I need help...do you bake the pizza on the lowest rack of te oven (where the pizza pan was warming) or do you move it higher. I don't see in the recipe where it specifies...

Absolutely delicious! I must say, I did not use the truffle oil, but I'm sure it would make it even better.

excellent! sauted the mushrooms in butter first. and the truffle oil s a must. can't wait to make it again!

I made a few changes to use what I had on hand...puffed pastry in lieu of pizza dough. I sauted the mushrooms with the truffle oil and a bit of truffle salt to add some depth in flavor. The taleggio does melt like a dream and made this fantastic with a side salad. I want to try this as a breakfast pizza with a poached egg...

Easy and delicious. I used whole wheat pizza dough - which I won't use again - and I still thought this was wonderful. The taleggio melts like a dream!

I really liked this pizza. The only problem I had is that the center of the pizza crust was soggy from the moisture released by the mushrooms. I will definitely make this again, though I may be tempted to saute the mushrooms first to get rid of the excess moisture. Had the crust been drier, I would have given this 4 stars.

I made this pizza for some friends who loved it! SO easy to make and endless options to switch it up. Next time will reduce oven heat to 475. Truffle oil was great finish!

So easy! I made my own pizza dough (also, so easy) using a recipe from smittenkitchen.com, and my husband raved about this. We had to wing it in terms of not having a pizza stone and my rolling pin had somehow vanished, and it was STILL good. Very forgiving recipe, and you could easily make substitutions -- I'm going to add carmelized onions next time.

Fabulous and the truffle oil is the perfect finishing touch. A classy meal when inviting friends over to watch a movie.

I halved the recipe and rolled the dough to a round--approximately 11 1/4 inches. I followed the rest of the recipe basically to the letter, but I used a special stone that I put onto my gas grill, instead of an indoor oven. Our pizza tonight was HEAVEN! This was the first time I've made a crust that was "cracker thin"---and it was ummmazing.

This was easy and very tasty with a gourmet touch. Just what my husband likes. Watch the dough, it can burn easily. I may try 450' for the oven temp. next time. Nice flavor with the truffle oil.

I loved this. I think the truffle oil really made it special. It was easy and tasty. I served it with a nice salad of greens and beets.

I was afraid this pizza would be a little dry with just the ingredients called for - but, it wasn't at all and it's delicious!! The truffle oil sprinkled over is just heaven.
