I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with this recipe and won't make it again. It got very sticky and difficult to manage. And the flavor wasn't all that interesting.

Does it get any better than this? I can't think how. We love this recipe and all my friends call me asking for it. I may start charging ...

Made these for a dinner party and am still hearing raves about them. We didn't bother with the sour cream. I'm not a pear person myself, but if you are, you will love this.
