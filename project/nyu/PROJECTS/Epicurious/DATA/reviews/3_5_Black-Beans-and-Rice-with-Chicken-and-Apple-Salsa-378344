I would make this again because it was healthy and simple, but I wouldn't rave about it or make it for guests. Next time, I will make more of the apple slaw and add more lime to the beans before serving. I might also cook the rice with some chicken broth and something else ??? to amp up the flavor. Maybe add some hot sauce too?

This is a fabulous recipe that allows for quick prep since you can either roast your own chicken or use rotisserie chicken. I added a diced jalapeno to the salsa with some cilantro. Also, I cooked the rice in chicken broth and added some chopped cilantro and grated lime zest at the end. FABULOUS! And I've made probably 6-8 times since this came out in the January 2012 issue...

Good recipe, but of course I had to play with it... My dish looked quite different from their picture, here's why.. I used red bell pepper, diced and a mixture of Black Beans and Black Soy Beans. I still mashed and simmered, used all the same spices, adding lots of lime and cilantro to the rice and bean mixture. The only difference was that I wanted to make this ahead and needed it to keep, didn't want the chicken to dry out, so I tossed my shredded chicken in with the bean, veggie mixture after the liquid had cooked down and it was great! I would use that chicken, bean and veggie mix as a tostada topper or taco filling, or even enchiladas, maybe? So many things you could do with this! The apple salsa with all that rich bean and lime rice was a wonderful combo, Thanks!

I don't like recipes that use "rotisserie chicken". I am interested in simple meal prep, but I don't see the point of buying chicken that someone else has cooked.

Wonderful meal. FYI, "Bon Appetit" uses correct punctuation by using the en dash (a longer hyphen) in words on this recipe that already have the hyphen but it was hilarious when my friends and I realized that WHEN VIEWING ON MY IPAD that the en dash had been removed and that I didn't need 46 lime wedges or cook for 67 minutes, but rather I needed 4-6 lime wedges and cook for 6-7 minutes.

This recipe is an excellent week night staple that you can use again and again. Don't have chicken? Pan fry some tofu and it would be just as delicious. I enjoyed this recipe but it isn't fancy or elaborate, meaning I wouldn't serve it to guests if I was entertaining but great healthy meal for my hubby and me.

This is a great recipe for those of you on Weight Watchers. I was able to scale back some of the ingredients to make it very WW friendly. I cut the amount of rice in half (1/2 cup brown rice/4 servings) and to slim down the chicken I boil 1lb chicken breast and shred that. Other changes I made were to double the amount of salsa and used a red pepper instead of green. I've made this a number of times and it's such a great recipe. Left overs are almost better than fresh.

Very easy, delicious, reasonably quick and healthy weeknight meal, the Apple Salsa really made the dish! My 7 year old son loved it too!

Awsome and easy healthy dinner! My kids loved it!! Going tomake this a regular on the menu! I didn't have limes so I used lemons instead and it was great. I also put some of the bell pepper in the salsa because my family really likes bell pepper. I used a milder orange bell instead of the green that the recipe calls for. Turned out delicious!! The second time I made it I used all vegan ingredients for a vegan family that needed a meal after a baby was born. I roasted veggies instead of the chichen an ey also loved it!

This was delicious and budget friendly-I would even eat it without the chicken. The key is the apple salsa. When I make it again, I will make extra apple salsa for sure since we ate all the salsa and didn't have any left for the leftovers!

This recipe involves a lot of ingredients but doesn't take much time to make. The apple salsa is a really interesting twist and makes the dish very fresh tasting. I've also used the left over chicken and apple salsa mixed in with a little mayo for a wrap for lunch the next day.

I really loved how simple and delicious this recipe was however I did make some changes. Instead of making the apple salsa I made a spicy apple slaw using cabbage, apple, cilantro, a serrano pepper, olive oil, lime juice and salt and pepper. The cabbage and apples added nice crunch. I also did not bother adding the chicken broth to the black beans because it tasted great with out it. My boyfriend wouldn't stop talking about how good this recipe was. I will definitely make it again.

Made this as a healthy, easy weeknight dinner and we (3 adults) liked it a lot. No cilantro in this house but tasty and enjoyable none-the-less. The apple salsa was a nice contrast with it's cool crunch to the beans/rice. Will be in the menu plans again.

My family was in agreement that this dish was strange. I love apples so I liked the apple on top but not sure how it qualifies as a salsa. It was apples with cilantro; no liquid at all. The beans and rice were a little bland. If I made it again i would add some heat. The biggest comment or complaint was that the salsa seemed to have no relation to the black beans and rice and I would agree. The only unifying ingredient was the cilantro and it just wasn't enough.

A little too much lime for my taste but very good.

Easy and very very good! If you don't like heat, I skipped the chili powder. The salsa made the dish.

Just fantastic. This was a huge hit and very easy to make. Don't skip the salsa it made this dish. I would also use this as a burrito filling with greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

This was excellent. Very quick to pull together, but very satisfying. We made it with brown rice, which gave it a nice texture. Like others, I added avocado to the salsa, which was great. Adding this recipe to the regular rotation.

This was an easy and tasty dinner. I went without coriander (not a fan) and used leftover chicken from my boyfriend's breaded chicken of the night before. Great for kids and adults.

My husband and I enjoyed the sour crunch that the green apples added to this dish. Our teen sons, not so much. An easy, healthy, quick mid-week meal. Next time I'll leave the apple salsa on the side, rather than put it on top.

i halved the recipe for my single girl appetite and will have plenty for leftovers this week. these are all ingredients that i tend to have anyway, which made shopping very easy. i used a red pepper instead of green, and veggie broth, since that's what i had. the apple salsa is a nice touch.

This was a really nice variation for black beans and rice. In fact, my husband even enjoyed the apple salsa, saying it gave the dish a nice texture. It will become a regular in our home.

Used slow cookered red beans and a lot more of all the aromatics and spices plus added a couple of chipotles in adobo w/the beans. Cooked rice in turkey broth (leftover from Thanksgiving carcass) and some store bought salsa to make it "Spanish." Used chicken breast meat leftover from chicken soup but really don't think the meat is necessary at all. Reminds me of El Pollo Loco bowls  yum.

Made a half batch of this for 3 people and it was very good. Used dried black beans instead of canned, roasted red pepper instead of frying a green pepper and I mesquite smoked a chicken on the Big Green Egg. The apple added a nice contrast to all the other flavors. I like mango a lot and will try it instead of apple next time. This is a keeper recipe.

4 Forks! This dish was delicious, surprising, and simple. I will be making this a week night dinner staple the day after we have roast chicken. The Granny Smith apple really adds a nice sweet/tart tang to the dish that brightened the beans and rice.

My eight year old and ten year old asked for seconds. The beans were delicious with the cumin and coriander, and the salsa was tangy. I will definitely make it again.

Always looking for ways to jazz up beans and the canned beans make this quick and easy. Everyone, 2 young kids (8,4) and the adults, liked the beans and rice. I had poached chicken and shredded it. I enjoyed the apple salsa. Some tartness, went well with the nicely-spiced beans (I didn't have cilantro, I sprinkled a touch of ground corriander with the apples/onions). Will make again for a quick night meal. It would be equally good without the chicken for a veggie option (if you use vegetable broth of course).

My husband even liked this (and he still salts his food when I'm not looking)! I baked chicken breasts on the bone drizzled w/olive oil and used that meat. I bought rotisserie chicken today so that we could use the rest of the leftovers tonight. Would make again.

Pretty bland sounding...try mango for the apple, pecan rice, smoked chicken thighs, and most all put some heat in...Scotch Bonnet unseeded. NEVER eat anything from a can...a few cups of dried black or red beans soaked overnight in chicken stock.

A few years ago, I would've never used a "store-bought" rotisserie chicken. Now I'm always looking for ways to use one. I normally get 4 meals out of one chicken. I'll add this recipe for one of my "uses".

LOVED this. Really simple, seems healthy, and the whole family enjoyed it, including picky daughter.

Sorry...this is just not that great. The beans tasted very perfumed with all of that coriander in them, and the apples and cilantro "salsa" is just weird. I'd need to drop all of the ground coriander and cumin seeds from the beans to re-make this recipe and omit the apple salsa altogether.

This was amazing! I made it tonight, with a few substitutions: poached chicken breasts instead of rotisserie chicken, simple homemade broth, and some extra spicy chile powder. The apple salsa is genius!

Yum! Started with dry beans(used 2 cups) and used grilled chicken instead of rotisserie. Also didn't have the green pepper for the beans. Great combo. Would not have thought of using apples in a salsa. Will definitely make again and may try replacing apples with mango.

Loved the beans - very, very tasty! Wasn't a huge fan of the apple salsa - it didn't seem to pair well flavor-wise with the dish. I subbed quinoa for rice and added some fresh avocado instead. Delish!

This was a good weeknight meal. My green bell peppers turned bitter so I may have cooked the sauce too long. Next time I will use a red bell pepper. This dish doesn't have a whole lot of flavor so the cilantro and lime juice really helped.

Rating: 3
I made almost exactly as written. The apple salsa was a wonderful idea, combined with the cilantro it really balanced out a typical, somewhat plain rice-and-beans dish. It's a simplt, throw-together weeknight meal, especially if you have some leftover chicken and rice on hand.

Rating: 4
Made this last night. It was really good and had a wide range of tastes. I used olive oil rather than veggie oil. Just used half of the chicken and added some crushed red pepper to the beans. Next time I would use more slasa and more lime juice, bell pepper and onion in the beans. I didn't wash the beans--- I just drained them. Used white rice.

Extremely simple and tasty way beyond what I expected!
