This was a nice dish and very easy to prepare. the only complaint was that the internal rub was too garlicly. Next time I'll reduce the garlic.

Loved the rosemary-garlic taste but the leg was not tender. I agree that there are better lamb recipes like Mustard and Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb. If I make this again, I'll try marinating the lamb.

My husband and I thoughly enjoyed this dish all the flavors were perfect in every bite. I did not have the lamb bone but followed the recipe to the T. This recipe is a keeper.

I've got several better lamb recipes than this one. Although it's nice to cut into the meat and see the rosemary, the problems far outweigh the benefits. I found it salty, I didn't think the garlic "cooked" enough, the rosemary tasted soggy, the roast had little or no exterior crust/flavor, and all the "pan juices" burnt to the bottom of the pan.
