Awesome sauce!!!! The one thing I did to give it a little kick was to replace the chili sauce with a "Chili Garlic Sauce" and 1-1/2 tablespoons on Horseradish.

I forgot to add to my previous review that the sauce is kind of an unfortunate coral/pink colour. Next time I will add some finely chopped parsley to break up that colour a bit.

I really liked this. I gave it four forks, but with a few changes. I didn't have Heinz chili sauce or horseradish sauce, so I used cocktail sauce instead (which is basically Heinz chili sauce with horseradish anyway). I also added 2 cloves of garlic that I diced finely. Other than that, the heat/spice was perfect. If I decide to up the heat factor next time, I will add a few splashes of sriracha (garlic chili sauce). Definitely give this sauce a try.

I ran onto this recipe while reading at a dentist's office back in the 90's. I "borrowed" the magazine for the recipe and have used it yearly since then as a sauce for crab at our local "All You Can Eat" crab feed. Everyone now requests that I bring this great sauce!

It's rich, delicious and reminds me of Crab Louie dressing. bought some more shrimp for tonight and will enjoy this for the second time in two nights.

I served this sauce with cold Shrimp and crudites at a Summer Wine Tasting and everyone (36 of them) raved about the sauce.

Used this dressing for a big shrimp louie. Didn't realize it was a dipping sauce, but very good with romaine, tiny shrimp, sliced boiled eggs, pickled beets, slivered red onion & sourdough garlic croutons. Very good.

I made this just as the recipe was written and thought it was just a bit thin. I like a little thicker sauce. Next time I will try reducing the mayo and adding some sour cream. Too much mayo for me. I like remoulade better. Will try again.

I've been making this sauce since the recipe was first published. I substitute sour cream for 1/2 cup of the mayo and use lemon juice instead of lime. Make the sauce early in the day. It is the best ever sauce.

Great, easy. Add a dash of hot sauce in addition to worcestershire to finish. The Bahamians have been serving a simpler version of this (ketchup, mayo, lemon/lime and hot sauce) with conch fritters for years. I remember my father mixing ketchup and mayo as a salad dressing when we ran out of bottled as a kid.

I didn't measure; I just added things by eye. Minor modifications: lemon juice instead of lime, dijon mustard instead of dry, and a dash of worcestershire. Get everything else who you like it and add mayo last, to taste.

I understand where the cook's who say there's too much mayo taste are coming from. We happen to like the mayo taste, but I might try reducing the amount of mayo next time just to see the difference. Otherwise we found it to be a very good sauce for dipping shrimp. I added more garlic, cayenne and dry mustard and only let it set for about an hour and it was still good.

Great sauce for shrimp. We cut the mayo by a 1/3 the last time and it was even better. I think this is the same shrimp sauce served at Outback Steak House for shrimp and blooming onions.

This is the most wonderful shrimp sauce for boiled/peeled shrimp. I've made this for two parties and everyone raves about it! I'm making another batch for a 3rd party tonight! It's almost a ramoulade(sp?) sauce, but VERY good. I'm not a huge shrimp fan, but I can't get enough shrimp when it's dipped in this sauce!

Way to much mayo, tasted like 1000 island dressing.

The suace was great, very easy and quick to make. I would make it a few hours ahead of serving time for the best results. Be sure to have plenty of shrimp on hand.

Living on the Texas Gulf Coast, we get great fresh shrimp. I've tried many sauce recipes and this is the best ever. It goes well with both boiled or steamed shrimp as well as fried shrimp. Make it early in the day as it improves after a few hours in the refrigerator.

Too much mayo for our taste.

Fabulous! Made the sauce and served it with the 'Prosciutto-Wrapped Shrimp' recipe instead of the garlic dipping sauce. Go for it and make it, you will not be disapointed. This is not the same old ketchup and horseradish cocktail sauce!

At a recent summer party I made five highly-rated epicurious recipes. This is the one that my guests raved about.

Wonderful sauce! I am a shrimp fan, and therefore often create shrimp/prawn dishes for dinners/potlucks and hors d'ouevres, so I frequently call upon this sauce to update recipes for appetizers and main course. This sauce is SO adaptable and delicious. For instance, try some of it stirred into a (cocktail-size) shrimp salad for luncheon bun-wiches, or, it is a fantastic new taste to introduce when looking for a different dipping sauce for jumbo prawns..... think Thousand Island, but much more complex!

This was so good, I could just sit and eat it with a spoon. Instead of all mayo I added some sour cream.

Great shrimp sauce (although I tasted it without the shrimp). Everyone thought it was a terrific change to ordinary seafood cocktail sauce.

A pleasant change from the usual.
