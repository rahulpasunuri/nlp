I made this for my family's Easter meal last year and it was a tremendous hit! The presentation was lovely and the cake was extremely flavorful! This would be the cake to make to impress!

This one was fiercely mediocre. I followed the directions to a T. The biggest issue for me was the consistency of the filling. It just wasn't stiff enough to sustain the weight of the layers, and much of it oozed down the side leaving a big moat of pink whip surrounding the cake. After I cleaned the plate, the mess of a cake was well concealed under the plain whipped cream. The taste and texture were OK, but if I am going to make a cake from scratch, it better be AMAZING. This one wasn't. Try another recipe. The lemon blueberry cake with lemon cream cheese icing (Bon Apetite, circa early 2000s) is my go-to cake and well worth the effort.

I made this cake for my son's birthday, and we all loved it. It was moist and flavorful, the lemon/raspberry combination was excellent. I made the cake almost exactly according to the recipe, except for the fact that I belatedly realized I didn't have enough sugar to make the full quantity of raspberry curd, so I made half instead. I only had enough to spread on two of the three layers, so used lemon curd on the last layer, and it actually worked out very well. I also didn't get a very thick cake but didn't find it at all difficult to cut in half surprisingly enough, though it seemed a very daunting task initially to cut such thin cakes; I just used the biggest knife I could find, and had no problem. Would definitely make this again. The only thing I might change is to put less sugar in the whipping cream, just because I prefer a less sweet tasting cream. I would actually give it three and a half forks.

What a disaster for me...I don't know what went wrong - the cake didn't rise and the whipped cream fell apart when I added the curd despite being ice cold....nothing went right for me

I made the cake layers for Easter Sunday dessert. They were delicious and I scored 3 forks as I thought the lemon flavour could have been more distinct. However, they rose beautifully and so easy to make. I did not make the raspberry curd but made it into a strawberry shortcake instead (long story there) Everyone raved about it and I can see the layers being very versatile for a birthday cake. Next on the agenda, I will try a lemon curd and a white chocolate frosting for my husband's birthday -- his request. You can see the cake here: http://flic.kr/p/9Bjsci

This is my favorite cake recipe to make. The lemon is incredibly subtle, and really is the essence of the entire cake - you need to be careful to grate in enough of the lemon zest, or else the cake tastes too much of flour. My boyfriend loves this cake - and, he doesn't like lemon desserts, a fact which I didn't know until I made him this cake for his birthday this year. This cake is incredibly quick and easy to make. I've made it several times now, and every time it's a hit. I didn't make the filling, but everytime I've made this I've topped it with vanilla buttercream frosting and coconut.

This is one of my favorite cakes. I used the recipe for my wedding (gave it to the restaurant to make this because I thought their cakes were not good). I have made it many, many times. I used to have a raspberry patch, so I used fresh raspberries, but recently used frozen and it worked just as well.

Very delicious. I made pretty much true to the recipe. I doubled the raspberries for the curd. I think I might have better luck frosting and decorating the cake if the whipped cream were stablized. Everyone loved it.

After reading the reviews for this cake, I was hesitant to make it but went ahead and gave it a go, with a couple of alterations. Since so many people complained that the cake was too dense, I used five eggs instead of four and two yolks. I also used my mixer to whip the eggs with the liquid ingredients and then to mix with the flour mixture. Both cakes turned out great! They weren't too thin or too dense, and were easy to slice in half. I wouldn't describe the cake as "light and airy, though, so don't expect that; with all those eggs, how could it be? The raspberry curd is simply delicious---it would taste good on/in almost anything. My only complaint about this cake is that it has to be stored in the refrigerator because of the whipped cream frosting. I don't like cold cake, so that's a drawback for me. But I would make it again for a party, no hesitation!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it turned out just fine. I did make the usual high-altitude adjustments for 5000 ft, but other than that the only change was I made it in tiny 6" pans, then baked the remaining batter in one 8" pan. I was able to bake 2 - 6" layers and slice them in half. It turned out great.

I have not made the cake yet but will based on the reviews. I wanted to say to those who had the issue with their curd turing gray, try making the curd in a pan that is not aluminium. That should solve your problem.

I made the cake ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE (this seems a radical idea!) and it was simply wonderful. The cake had a firm yet tender, moist consistency that holds up really well to torting, and the thin layers look absolutely beautiful contrasted with the pink filling. And to top it off, it is delicious, too! It is both rich and refreshing, and when made as directed, the flavors are perfectly balanced. The amount of lemon flavor in the cake is appropriate as is - I think those who add more lemon will find that the flavor of the raspberry curd is overpowered.

Yum! After reading other reviews, I cheated and made a boxed lemon cake mix. I did add lemon zest and substituted 1/3 cup lemon juice for part of the water in the box recipe, per other reviews. The cake turned out very lemony and delicious. I made three 9" layers. The raspberry curd was divine, and easier than I thought to make. I had no problems with the curd turning gray as other reviewers did. My cake turned out much more "homemade" looking that anticipated- I was having trouble with the raspberry/cream mix, and it was squishing and dripping everywhere. So I just put a bunch of the raspberry mix on top, and put plain whipping cream on the sides. I only used 2 cups of whipping cream and I had extra of both the raspberry mix and the plain cream. I did not pipe any cream to decorate though, instead putting raspberries around the base of the cake. This cake was even tastier than I expected, and I will certainly make this again and again!

I haven't seen the photo of what this cake looks like, but I followed the recipe and my cake turned out with a pound-cake consistency, rather than a light and fluffy cake. It was really good and I think because the cake is more dense, it prevents the curd from soaking in and turning the cake gray. I used 1/4 c. fresh lemon juice and if I made the cake again would add one or two teaspoons of lemon extract to get more lemon flavor. I also made sure the eggs and milk were at room temperature. I used a hand mixer and mixed until everything was well blended. I made the curd and cake layers the day before and put the cake together the morning of the party. I wasn't able to slice each layer exactly in the middle but it doesn't really matter - no one can see that anyway once it's covered in whipped cream. Everyone ate their serving so I think they liked it. Very good flavor.

I just love this cake slice and that is why I made this cake. As I expected this cake is wonderful. I had a problem like many other people but I find out that I made that mistake by put butter on the pan. I am sure next time I will be using a spray. Many other people complain about curd's color comes out grayish color. But I didn't had a problem. Howevcr, you need to swish right after you put on the range. Everybody who taste this cake say IT IS WONDERFUL! One person ate THREE slices. I definantly will make another one because my daughter wants me to.

I admit that I've tried this before and had problems with the texture of the cake. But, when this comes out right, it is so worth it. The things I did differently this time that may have made a difference, I made sure the eggs and milk were at room temperature, whisked the heck out of everything, and cooked for about 5 minutes less than called for. I believe, based upon my limited baking knowledge, that mixing the flour with the oil first limits the potential for gluten development so don't worry that a reasonable amount of mixing will make the cake tough; maybe. I've never had a problem with the curd. Always wonderful.

This cake is simply awful. First, as others have noted, each layer comes out about 3/4 in thick. Who wants a layer cake that is an inch and a half high?? Dissappointed, I decided to nibble a corner, thinking that I could live with an ugly cake if it tasted good. Not so. This cake was so dense as to be borderline chewy, and the overwhelming flavor was one of egg. If this was intended to be soaked in a lemon syrup, it might have been OK, but there was no way those layers were going to accommodate a whipped-cream based filling. So the nasty cake went into the trash, and I made an emergency substitution - ate the curd and whipped cream on some angel food cake picked up at Whole Foods. Not exactly the gorgeuos birthday cake I was hoping for. As for the curd, it was so-so. For my tastes, it was a bit too sweet, but perhaps that's because it was intedned to compliment the (non-existent) sour overtones of the lemon cake. We didn't touch the leftovers. If you want a nasty-tasting cake that looks like it was made by an eight year old, you've found your winner. Otherwise, steer clear of this nightmare.

I'm sorry the cook from Boston had a bad experience, but she must have made some serious errors. I baked this cake, after mixing (by hand with a whisk) as directed and it came out great. For those interested, this recipe follows the "combining" method, as opposed to the creaming method, and is a time honored way to bake cakes. It was quite thin, however, measuring only 3/4" after baking in the 9" pan. I was able to successfullly slice each layer in two after inserting toothpicks around the perimeter and using a long bread knife. The layers were quite flexible and easy to manipulate. The texture is dense and provides a nice counterpoint to the whipped cream topping and curd. As for the curd, it set up beautifully and was a lovely shade of pink. It did not soak into the cake. Guests were very impressed with this elegant cake! Give it a try as written. I was very pleased.

Boy, what a disappointment! Cake didn't rise and was eggy and heavy, raspberry curd didn't set up (even after I stabilized the whipped cream with gelatin for the frosting), so the heavy layers mushed down the runny curd, which slopped all out and down the sides, making frosting the damned thing very problematic. There it sits in all its lumpy glory in the fridge, a leaning mound of butterfat and sugar. Yum. We'll probably wind up eating it with a spoon, and it will probably taste just fine, but really, WHAT is with all these 4 fork reviews raving about this cake, when it turns out, upon closer inspection, that half of you haven't even MADE THIS RECIPE????? Luckily this is NOT the piece de resistance of our Easter dinner, or I'd be a lot more pissed off about it than I am, but when I see 3-1/2 to 4 fork ratings of a CAKE recipe, I expect the reviewers to have actually made the damned cake.

If you enjoy lemon, then this is the cake for you! This cake is very moist and tasty. I added a little more lemon zest and fresh lemon to give it more lemon flavor. After it cooled slightly, I drizzled a small amount of a sugar and fresh lemon mix over cakes for an exceptional lemon finish. Cake needs no other topping. This cake is a winner! The recipe made 2 loaves.

What a disappointment! After making what seemed like a delicious lemon cake, REALLY delicious raspberry curd, and decent whipped cream, this cake was a DUD! Ugly and not so tasty. Why ugly?

Due to other reviews about the cake, I used Gale Gand's "Perfect Yellow Cupcake" recipe from Food Network. I put the raspberry curd whipped cream between the four layers, then frosted with white chocolate whipped cream. It was beautiful and tasty.

Complaining about adding oil to the batter? Butter is 20% water, which steams inside the cake and can cause it to flatten or become soggy. That's also why cooks should not butter their baking pans; steam will cause soggy bottoms and sides. Use shortening or spray instead.

I have mixed feelings about this cake. It tastes great. I love the raspberry curd (I used frozen berries), but I think I'd like it better without being mixed with the whipped cream. It looks great until you cut it, then you see that the cake layers, instead of being yellow, look grayish from liquid seeping out of the curd. It didn't look very appetizing, even though it was delicious. Everyone said they liked it. The cake did have a strange texture and the layers were thin, but no too much so. I doubt I'd make it again, unless I fiddled around with the cake recipe to use the creaming method of mixing, and didn't mix cream into my raspberry curd.

Rating: 2
Sorry, folks, but this cake does not turn out well. The raspberry curd is fine; the cake itself is eggy, flat, and not what you expect from a recipe that asks you to cut the layers in half! Impossible--they are too thin. Two teaspoons of baking powder is already too much for two cups of flour; perhaps that is the problem. I don't know, but I won't be trying it again.

Like everyone else, I loved the raspberry curd...simply delicious! I had problems making the cake, however. It turned out flat and very rubbery. I think it was because I over-mixed the batter prior to baking. I decided to try it again since it smelled great. This time, I added another teaspoon of baking powder and mixed the batter just to incorporate the dry ingredients (I used a stand mixer). It turned out so much better with the cake being fluffier and not at all rubbery. I brought it to a baby shower and it was a big hit!

I just have to respond to Robyn from England, who was "bothered" by the inclusion of oil in this cake recipe. Coincidentally, just this morning I read in the Gourmet Cookbook about the origin of adding oil. In 1928 a California baker named Harry Baker invented a chiffon cake made with vegetable oil instead of solid fat. He sold the recipe to General Mills in 1947, and in 1948 it was introduced to the public on the Betty Crocker radio show as "the cake discovery of the century." The oil keeps the cake moist. Also, if I'm not mistaken, it is recommended for cakes made with fillings and frostings that require refrgeration, since butter cakes harden in the fridge. In any case, the mixing method of the above lemon cake recipe and the addition of oil have nothing to do with speed. Yes, some Americans certainly are interested in quick cooking, just as I am sure some Brits are. But please don't lump all Americans together.

This recipe is great-- the curd and whipped cream topping is delicous and was perfect for easter. Instead of 9 inch rounds I made cupcakes, cut them in half and put a layer of filling in the middle and a layer on top, dotted with raspberries. After reading some other reviews, I decided to use cake mix, doctored with zest and lemon juice, and it tasted great. I'll definitely make this dessert again.

Everyone really loved this recipe and it is so pretty too. I cheated and used a boxed lemon cake mix due to lack of time, but it turned out fabulous! I made it last spring for easter and I am making it again for easter. I ran into problems with straining the raspberries because I didn't have a fine enough strainer. I ended up using cheese cloth and I lost some of the juice. I am going to buy an appropriate strainer and I should be fine now.

My friend wanted a lemon cake for his birthday, and though this cake had mixed reviews, it had the best reviews out of everything that I looked at. I agree with most of the previous posters, the cake was a bit too dry and dense but the curd was divine. To combat the dry problem I made a lemon/sugar/water glaze and drizzled that over the cakes before assembling which helped a lot. The result was a moist, dense (even with an extra tsp. of baking powder!) cake with great lemon flavor. I also added more lemon juice and zest to the cake batter than the recipe called for. Maybe an extra egg would help the batter be more fluffy? All in all, I will look for another cake recipe, but keep the raspberry curd one handy, it was delish!

The curd was by far the best part of this cake. It was beautiful, tangy, and nice texture. Worth the time spent dealing with the sieve. The cake itself was a bit dense and flat (I used the 9" pans), though the flavor was nice. Overall, it is a beautiful and fairly light summer cake, and as an intermediate-level baker, I thought it was easy.

I tried the curd recipe with a different, more complex lemon cake recipe. The moral of this story is: the more difficult recipe isn't always better!

This cake was wonderful! I'm a relativly new baker so was a bit intimidated by this recipe. It ended up being very easy if you take it in steps. I made it for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday and ended up using 3 8-inch cake pans and making it a 3 layer cake. I thought the cake was missing that sour lemon flavor, so before stacking and frosting the cake, i dripped some fresh lemon juice over the cakes. The end result was fabulous. I'd make it again.

Fantastic! I served this cake today for my daughter's 4th birthday party. It got rave reviews. I searched this site for a cake that would be big and beautiful, and that I could prepare with my 3 children. I shopped on Thurs., made the cakes and curd on Fri. afternoon, assembled the cake on Sat. afternoon, and served it on Sunday. It was moist, and the whipped cream held up. I used canola oil for the recipe and the pans. I didn't have 2 9" pans, so I used 1 9" and 1 8". I should have jiggled the pans before placing them in the oven; the cakes came out a little slanted. All was fine after the curd and whipped cream was spread. Except for the raspberries and heavy cream I used organic ingredients including whole wheat pastry flour. The kids decorated with raspberries on top, and piped the stars along the bottom. It got a little stressful after I wrote Happy Birthday on the top with melted bittersweet chocolate in a pastry bag. My 10 year old son said the cake looked "professional", and the 4 year old birthday girl wanted to draw chocolate zigzags on the sides. We let her pipe some extra whipped cream stars, and a few chocolate vertical stripes. I improvised a cake dome with a wok top, and assembled the cake on a gingerbread house base (a piece of cardboard covered with decorative aluminum foil.) The cake was easy to slice, and after serving 13 people I still have half a cake left. It's sweet so a small slice is satisfying. Keep it in the fridge so the whipped cream won't melt. I had fun making this. Thank you for the recipe.

This cake was exceptional! I will confess to using the Betty Crocker Lemon Cake Mix, and following the 'cholesterol free' directions, to which I added some lemon peel. I decreased the sugar in both the curd and the whipped cream, which I feel I could have even been decreased some more, in light of the cake mix. Strawberries were much cheaper than raspberries so I used them instead. My curd was a little runny - I'm not sure how it's supposed to be, so I used what was leftover as a sauce for the cake since I wasn't very generous between the layers for fear it would seep out. Probably my best b-day cake so far, and it wasn't even chocolate!!

This is in regards to the comments from the cook in London. The technique for the recipe is not necessarily American quick-cookery. It resembles the technique that Rose Levy Beranbaum advocates in The Cake Bible. In all her cake recipes mixes the dry ingredients together with a mixer, then incorporates the fat and some of the liquid into them. She recommends using a stand mixer, and beating the fat into the dry ingredients for a good minute or two to develop the structure of the cake. Then you add the rest of the liquid (eggs, milk, etc.) and beat for a minute more to fully incorporate. Ms. Beranbaum has devised her method quite scientifically, and even co-authored a study on how mixing dry ingredients with a mixer for 30 seconds is just as good as or better than sifting at evenly distributing dry ingredients and is the first step in incorporating air into the cake batter. I have tried many of her recipes and find them light in texture and delicious. Just my two cents...might make this recipe for Easter...still deciding.

I have some time on my hands and am just sniffing around epicurious for a raspberry recipe seeing as they are everywhere at the moment. Having glanced through the recipe and the method for the cake, I was somewhat alarmed. I don't know how this method was devised but it seems to go against regular baking principles. I'll admit, I am fairly traditional when it comes to cake baking, but then I bake because the ritual soothes me, and I know that Americans are pretty big on speed cooking (I am quite concerned by all the corner-cutting I read about, but hey, I'm young free and single and I probably have more time on my hands than most!) Anyway what I wanted to say was that the flavour combination sounds fantastic, but that cooks should perhaps try a conventional recipe, ie. creaming butter and sugar, gradually adding beaten egg, then flavouring, then flour and finally milk to loosen the batter. This has always worked for me (with an electric mixer it's fairly foolproof and not too slow) to create a light, melting cake with good flavour and texture. Also I think it's crucial to sift your dry ingredients and to constantly remember to try and incorporate air into your batter at all times. If you cook in stages you have some five or six chances to bring air into your batter; the epicurious recipe has obviously been designed to be quick and easy and cuts out several of those stages. I was also a little bothered by the addition of vegetable oil - if you cream the butter with a mixer initially, till pale, then you should get the correct consistency. Also make sure your butter is at room temperature to start with, so you aren't fighting a messy battle with resistant little chunks. Good luck! I'll let you know how my own results are received...

This was one of the best lemon cake recipes I've come accross in a while. I did take note of another reviewer's suggestion on how to mix it, to avoid, denseness and it worked like a charm. I did however modify it slightly. I made a four layer cake, instead of two or three. For the raspberry curd, before I added the whipped cream to the raspberry mix, I put a layer of just the raspberry mix on the first cake layer, then I added the appropriate amount of whipped creme to the rasberry mix, and then put one layer of thhat on the second and third layer. I also made a lemon buttercreme merange frosting, insteading of using the whipped creme for the frosting, and added some of the buttercreme to the third layer, on top of the raspberry curd. I frosted the cake with the remaining lemon buttercreme merange frosting. It came out beautiful and it tasted outstanding. I made this for a suprise birthday party and everyone raved about it. You can find the receipe for the Lemon Merange Buttercreme on this website as I made this before for another cake.

In reading other reviews I noticed many people complained of flat, heaviness. My guess would be that the heaviness comes from whisking far too long in an effort to combine the ingredients fully. Using an electric mixer combines the ingredients well and without overbeating. I have made this cake three times - all three turned out gorgeous. The first I used the recipe exactly and made a raspberry curd. The second two times I made a filling of strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, and a bit of butter which I then folded with whipped cream. The strawberry version was even more delightful, in my opinion. This cake is just AWESOME. Not to mention the fact that it presents beautifully as well, with a lovely height and size.

I like dense cakes with substance, but this cake is heavy and flat. My baking powder is fresh and working fine in other recipes. I suspect the order in which ingredients are combined. Ii've used lemon juice in other cakes OK. I put it together with a lemon curd and raspberries and salavaged it somewhat by brushing each layer with a sauce of lemon sugar water boiled.

I have made this cake twice. Both times, I doubled the amount of lemon juice in the cake. The first time I made it, it came out a little on the flat side. The second time, I added an extra half teaspoon baking powder - next time I will add a full extra teaspoon. I think the lemon juice might deactivate some of the power of the baking powder. With the extra baking powder, it was a bit lighter. The cake is a little dry, but if you brush it with a little simple syrup - you can even flavor it with lemon juice - after it cools, it stays moist.

After reading the reviews, I made a couple of tiny alterations: I used an electric mixer instead of a whisk to beat in more air for a lighter cake, and compensated by replacing two tablespoons of the flour with cornstarch (to keep it from getting tough from gluten). The cake rose beautifully, even in my unreliable and uneven ancient gas oven. But hey, the baking powder was from a fresh can. I used 8 inch pans since I don't have nine inch - thus it was really easy to split the layers. I also halved the sugar in the raspberry curd (we don't like overly sweet cake, kept the curd fresh tasting) and used frozen berries with no problem. I folded in a few tablespoons of purchased lemon curd into the whipped cream frosting. By far the best cake I have ever eaten or made. Really, really moist and neither too heavy nor too light. Fantastic!! Now to get my grubby hands on some black currants to try this with a cassis curd....

Fabulous!!! My guests loved it. Since my first two cakes turned out flatter (and less lemony) than I had expected, I made 2 more. I cut the butter in half on the second batch, which made even flatter, spongier cakes. I sliced off the bottoms, and drenched the two flat cakes with a mixture of lemon juice and sugar. I sliced the first two cakes in half, and then assembled the cake as instructed just adding extra layers. Also made extra filling and whipped cream to accomodate so many layers!!! Talk about lemony!!! It was extremely moist, beautiful to present and delicious!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly and the cake layers were flat, dense and dry and really unappetizing. I seemed to have way too much filling and frosting too. Overall, it was pretty disappointing, because the picture was beautiful.

To the reviewer from Delaware: when I have made cakes that haven't risen properly, often the culprit has been old baking powder. You might want to check the date on the bottom of your baking powder can, perhaps that was a cause.

I made this for my sister's birthday and it was really fun and the presentation was beautiful. I love to cook and especially bake and I do it all the time, but rarely do I have an occasion where I can make a pretty cake for someone, so this was a blast for me. I had the same issue some others had as well - my cake layers didn't really rise at all. I cut them into layers anyway, but it was a mess and it was difficult. The "layers" were pretty ragged and uneven, but I really wanted the layered presentation. I have no idea why the cakes didn't rise for some of us. I followed the recipe exactly. Oh well. I did my best and the cake still looked stunning. My guests absolutely loved it, but I would have to agree with the other reviewers that more lemon would be great. Overall though, even with my rising difficulties, this was a gorgeous cake that tasted great and I would make this again. Have fun and happy cooking!

I made this just over the weekend for my dad's birthday party yesterday - delicious. My cake looked just like the picture! The cake wasn't as moist as I would have liked. The next time, I think I'll add a little more lemon juice - didn't have enough lemon flavor for me. My guests ooohed & aaahed about it - really is pretty. What a great recipe for the raspberry curd. I made that a day before to give it plenty of time to chill (after reading the reviews). Also, I didn't think the 1/3 cup of raspberry curd between each layers was enough. They could have used more - I had probably 3/4cup of curd leftover. I served that curd on the side of each piece of cake - so good. The curd would make a great dip for fresh fruit! I will be making this cake again & again ( definitely add a little more lemon juice to the cake). After I frosted the cake with the whipped cream, I put the rest in a pastry bag & piped stars around the bottom of the cake - very pretty!

This was heavenly. I brought it to work, and the entire cake was gone before noon! Two things: 1. Next time, I will try to add a little more lemon to the cake and possibly include a lemon curd between one of the layers (I love lemon, and this didn't provide nearly enough flavor.) 2. I will refrigerate the raspberry filling longer. It didn't get as firm as I would have liked it to.

I made this cake with two substitutions: I used skim milk rather than whole milk for the cake (it was what I had on hand) and strawberries rather than raspberries for the filling. I found the curd was too thin; it may have been because I used strawberries. I ended up adding gelatin to thicken it. When I folded in the whipped cream I found the filling was once again much too soft. I chilled it for a couple hours before filling the cake and then worked quickly. The end result was wonderful! As an added bonus, finicky filling aside, this cake was quite easy to make as far as special occasion cakes go. I'll definitely make it again.

I tried baking the cake 2 times, but I couldn't get it to raise enough in order to torte the layers. The cake was dense and rubbery. I used the raspberry curd and whipped cream on a cheesecake instead.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was fabulous! It was moist and the raspberry curd filling was delicious. My family loved the cake and I can't wait for a chance to make it again. It actually looked exactly like the photograph in Bon Appetit! I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to make a very special dessert.

I made this cake for our 10th wedding anniversary. It turned out wonderful and looked just like the picture. Rather than raspberries I used strawberries. If you liked this cake with the raspberries, try the strawberries for a variation. Both my husband and I loved it, and felt it was the perfect ending to our dinner.

We made this cake for Easter. It made a beautiful presentation, however like another rater - we found the cake very dense (but good). We felt the cake was too dense for the fully creme filling.

I made only the cake portion of this recipe for a friend's birthday cake. An usual recipe that was easy to do. It made a dense, lemony cake that everyone really loved. However, my layers didn't rise that much, so I didn't try to torte the cake. I filled it with a raspberry jelly and iced it in buttercream.

Nice presentation and good ending to a lunch or brunch. I thought the raspberry curd could have used a little more raspberry flavor, so next time I will probably make 1.5 times the raspberry curd. I had lots of whipped cream left over!

I made this for Easter dinner. It was delicious! The flavors melded together beautifully. My cake looked exactly like the picture in the magazine. My guests were impressed! I will make this again for a special event!
