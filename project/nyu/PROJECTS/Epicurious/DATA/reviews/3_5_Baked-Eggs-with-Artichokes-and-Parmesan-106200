Great and really easy. Although I used 2 more artichoke hearts per recipient and I sliced them in halves, 2 eggs and chunks of fresh tomato! Baked for 11 minutes and all done.

I made this because I'd roasted artichoke hearts the night before ~ therefore, my artichokes were a little overdone. Also, I used the herbs I had on hand ~ fresh dill and thyme, and therefore used feta to accommodate the lighter flavors. However, I believe this recipe would be excellent as written ~ as it was excellent with my mixups. But, I like eggs and artichokes any way I can get them. The eggs were creamy and delicious, and went perfectly with the tang of the artichokes.

Enjoyed the flavor and simplicity of this dish. Didn't measure, but probably used more herbs -- used 2 eggs per person. Baked 11 minutes. Served with mixture of roasted bell peppers, onions and cherry tomatoes -- nice crusty bread and glass of champagne. Easy weekday meal. Will make again.

This is delicious! I didn't think to read reviews before I made it, and I used 2 eggs (one wouldn't be enough for me) and split a can of artichokes between 6 dishes = about 6 or 7 pieces per serving with 2 eggs, and I thought it was a perfect amount of artichokes, not overpowering as someone had written, at all! I love the idea of making this with your own ingredients - bacon, smoked salmon, etc. Will definitely make this again! Oh, also with 2 eggs it took WAY longer than 9 minutes, I kept putting it back in, maybe 25?

I reduced the artichokes and added smoked salmon (and the second time, replaced that with a mix of fresh salmon and bacon ((in my case, turkey bacon))) - added some dill to the salmon mix, topped with artichoke, the fresh herbs on top of that, then followed the recipe. Wonderful!

This was delicious, but I think if I made it again I would make a few changes. I would decrease the amount of artichoke slightly as it was a little overpowering, and I would take the suggestion below of adding extra egg or egg white to each. Overall though, it was wonderful.

This is so simple yet delicious. I used freeze-dried chives along with fresh parsley and dill. I cooked my eggs a while longer since I prefer them set. Very good! Will definitely make it again (maybe for company, too)

This recipe is excellent. I tweaked it a little by adding an additional egg white to each as well as a few layers of spinach. Also, i used dired rosemary, thyme, and a little oregano and it was wonderful.

i've been making this recipe for years now and everyone i make it for loves it. it's elegant and simple. i usually mix up some thyme & basil with the oregano and it does need to cook an extra minute or two, unless you're into super runny eggs. i serve it with thick sourdough toast wedges for dunking... mmmm...

I tested this today for an upcoming brunch I am hosting. I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed by it's results. It was a beautiful presentation and it was easy to make, but the taste was terribly bland. I liked the texture of the eggs, almost like a custard once you break the egg, in cooking it the nine minutes as directed. I agree with another reviewer that this could be interesting on an english muffin like eggs benedict, but by the time you do all that, you might as well make the real thing.

Thank you to the previous cook for the suggestion of 12 minutes...makes perfect eggs. I have made this recipe a few times now; always varying ingredients...quite nice with sauteed veggies or brie added to the mix...variations are limitless! :)

I served these to a group of 14 at brunch. They were definately a hit with the guests. I used fresh basil instead of the oregano and added two eggs to the cups instead of one, but other that that stuck with the recipe exactly. We had done a practice run in the morning and found the eggs took closer to 15 minutes to get the whites set but then found the yolks a little hard. I will definately try these again, the fresh herbs and the presentation was wonderful! Next time I think I will take the suggestion of a couple of other reviewer and make more of a custard by beating the yolks and whites seperately and then folding the other ingredients into that. Even though I would like to perfect the eggs done with a soft yolk it would be no fail the other way.

Easy and very good... for the herb mix, I used fresh parsely, minced green onions, fresh thyme, and a little dried chervil. Definitely a good make-ahead brunch idea.

Yes - this dish definitely needs more time in the oven. I made this for 5 people, it looked cooked, but when we got it on the table it was cold. Will try it again with a bit more time in the oven...probably 12 or so minutes sounds right. I think chopping the artichoke hearts would be tasty

I had 16 people over for brunch and this was a big hit. Everyone wants the recipe and will make it very soon. I did find it needed more time in the oven and I would chop the artichokes up or use spinach instead. We all enjoyed this beautiful dish.

These are amazingly good, easy to make, and the 9-minute timing is spot-on. My boyfriend also loved them, and wants to make them again soon. I definitely recommend them, particularly for a special breakfast/brunch occasion.

12 minutes was perfect. This was a bit hit and beautiful presentation, alongside a potato and sausage casserole, with fruit salad on the side.

Delicious and very easy. We used marinated artichoke hearts and added a lot more herbs than called for and after putting together, sprinkled more herbs on the top which made for a better presentation. Cooked it for 18 minutes which was probably too long because yolk were cooked through. We were thinking it could probably be made ahead of time and stored in refrigerator overnight and just put into oven in the morning.

Very good breakfast in bed option. My husband immediately wanted seconds, so it's good that it comes together quickly. The oregano did seem to be a much stronger taste than I expected it would be, and we found the dish does need to be cooked longer than 9 minutes.

Delicious. A wonderful blend of flavors. I finally found an egg dish that my wife will eat. Not only does she eat it, she asks for it almost weekly.

Agree with the comments about cooking time. Can't go wrong with fresh herbs and eggs, but it was pretty bland and could probably benefit from an element of sharpness or creaminess or both. It presents nicely, but my "yes" to making it again is qualified with the idea that I'd try some different ingredients - possibly roasted red peppers or asparagus.

This is a great dish, and I will definitely make it again soon, but make a change in the baking method. After 8 minutes of baking at 400 degrees, the (fresh grated) parmesan had not even begun to brown, so I broiled it for a minute or so. The result was eggs that were more done than I wanted. Perhaps next time I will bake for less time and put under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Did anyone else have this experience?

So easy, and so delicious. And more filling than I thought it would be. I cooked the eggs for 11 minutes, which seemed a sifficant amount.

Did take longer to bake, as others have said. These would be over the top served as sort of a benedict on english muffins with hollandaise!!

I followed the recipe exactly - except had to bake for almost 14 minutes rather than 9. My oven seems to be very accurate but maybe the eggs were extra large and required a little more baking time. This is a great brunch dish and I'll definitely make it again.

Tasty and very easy to make. I served it along with salad and homemade focaccia as a quick midweek dinner.

Only two people seemed to have made this recipe as it was supposed to be made. How can someone 'rate this recipe' when the recipe was not followed and sometims changed completly? It is nice to hear other variations and I get many ideas from other people, but the recipe should not be rated if it has not been used.

Rating: 3
Actually, with all the changes I made in the recipe, it's really a different recipe altogether, and i would DEFINITELY make my version again! I also beat the yolks with a little cream and then whipped the whites and folded this together with the parmesan (i used a little more than the recipe called for...) eliminate the oregano--i thought the flavor was too intense for the delicate egg mixture (also adding ham would completely overpower the delicate artichoke flavor)... bake til it's custardy. It was DELICIOUS... everyone wanted the recipe, but I had to sit down and "remember" what I'd done before I could give it out!

I love eggs and especially artichokes and this is a good way to enjoy both at the same time.

This were a hit at my last brunch. It was party for my sister-in-law and 7 other women. I love anything that can be made in advance. I served these with a fresh fruit salad and toasted portuguese sweet bread. Add a pitcher of mimosas made with fresh squeezed OJ and something sweet for afterwards and you have a wonderful menu for for a party.

For more convenient eating and impressive presentation, butter the ramekin and line it with wilted spinach leaves or thin slices of boiled ham cut to fit neatly. Place the other ingredients inside and Bake as in the recipe and then unmold it onto a grilled buttered toast round or English muffin

I'm always looking for new recipes, and used spinach and swiss cheese instead of artichokes and parmesean, and it was excellent! (I always deviate from recipes.) I did have to cook it for a little longer however. This is a great way to make eggs a little more interesting!

This is a step above a baked egg recipe. I love artichokes, so I am always looking. I used a little more cheese and whipped the eggwhites to soft peaks, then folded in the yolks. More airy!

A step up from classic baked eggs, extremely easy to make, great breakfast-in-bed addition. The herbs add a wonderful touch, a little something extra taste-wise, but also a very pretty presentation. I assembled them the night before, then snuck into the kitchen the next morning to pop into the oven along with a couple other make-ahead dishes...a nice morning surprise for my husband.
