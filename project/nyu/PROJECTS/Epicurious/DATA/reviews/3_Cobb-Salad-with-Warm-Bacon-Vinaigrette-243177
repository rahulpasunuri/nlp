I absolutely love it. It is getting rave reviews whenever I make it at home or bring it somewhere. The vinaigrette is delicious!!!

You miss the whole point: Cobb salad is a chopped salad--egg, chicken, bacon, tomato, avocado--all are served in separate sections over chopped lettuce. The Brown Derby in Hollywood created the salad, though I don't remember the chef's name--rumor was that it was made first for a famous wit of the day, Irwin S. KCobb.

I made this last night & will again tonight--used cooked chicken I already had on hand. Easy, tasty, delicious!

Not great.

Kind of bland and too salty.

I thought the salad was great. I omitted the chicken as it was a side for steak. I was leary of the vinaigrette at first but it complimented the salad very nicely. My only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce.

Great just the way is written. I didn't change a thing. A keeper!

This is a good but unexceptional variation on the original Cobb. I prefer Cobb salads chopped, as in the original recipe.

Next time I will use my own vinaigrette. This one did not make me happy. It was very lack luster.

I liked this salad a lot, though I like lots of dressing on my salad, so I might make extra next time and add some homemade croutons.

Tasty, easy, filling!
