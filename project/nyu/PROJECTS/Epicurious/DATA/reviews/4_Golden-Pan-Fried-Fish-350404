So simple and delicious - will become my standard for breaded fish.

AWESOME but don't do what I did! I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fabulous. The second time I used egg whites from a carton, thinking I wouldn't waste so many yolks. But they just don't work - they're not sticky enough to hold the breading onto the fish, and I ended up with a gummy mess that was difficult to cook properly.

Yummy. I have made this with cod and snapper; everyone likes it. Since these are softer fish than halibut, I cut them into portion-size filets instead of sticks so they don't fall apart. They do take longer to cook that way but taste just as good. FYI, if you don't have a use for three leftover egg yolks, the recipe works just fine made with one whole egg and one egg white.

Very good as is. I like to read reviews before trying but msspicey from Atlanta reviews this recipe for PAN-FRIED FISH by substituting a recipe for BAKED SHRIMP !!! How on earth is this helpful??!

Quick, easy and very tasty. I used haddock since it was on sale and I used citrus pepper instead of lemon peel.

Awesome recipe, made it exactly as instructed except used fresh haddock from the local fish guy (in Maine) and served it with Jim N Nick's coleslaw. Great combo and no tarter sauce needed! This will be a keeper for making crispy fish from now on.

What an amazing weeknight meal this made! Crispy and well-seasoned. Used only 1/2 the cayenne for the kids. It was so tasty that I thought the tartar sauce was distracting. Huge hit with the whole family...

This is so good! I used large shrimp instead of fish. I baked these at 450 on a greased preheated sheet. I sprayed with cooking spray before cooking and turned once during baking. Lowfat version and still crunchy and delicious!

Living on the east coast for the first half of my life, I grew up on fish and chips. This recipe is far better. The batter is light, crispy and tasty. It is easy to prepare. The whole family loved it and asks for it all the time.

I served these "fish sticks" as fish tacos (in corn tortillas on a bed of slaw topped with melon salsa.) This recipe is an absolute keeper for frying up white fish for any purpose. I used true cod, and used some pre-seasoned panko that my local market makes and sells (cajun seasoned). For the beer, I used an IPA. Delicious and easy.

Wouldn't change a thing! This is a great, simple recipe. We cooked the fish longer because it was quite thick, but other than that this is a real keeper.

Absolutely delicious despite my many substitutions. I used fresh tilapia, dried parsley, sea salt, club soda (ran out of beer!) and canola oil. I'm not a fish lover, but this was very tasty. Served with fresh lemon. My husband raved about it and I will definitely make again.

Excellent and quick. Easy work night dinner. I've substituted halibut with haddock and works really well. So good, we don't bother with the tartar sauce.

Wonderful!!! As expensive as halibut is, we want to make sure it's done RIGHT. And it's not often that a fish recipe is just as good reheated as leftovers.

Panko crumbs took this fish from good to outstanding. Excellent with malt vinegar instead of tartar sauce.

Fantastic. I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out perfect. Probably the fried fish I have ever eaten. I will definitely make this again.

Try it with Black Fish, it's excellent! We make it once a week.

This was so delicious! I made the whole Fish and Chips menu - tartar sauce, roasted chips and 5 minute slaw. It was all very good.

Excellent. I had to make a couple of substitutions. Cilantro instead of parsley. Chili powder instead of cayenne. The cilantro was wonderful. However, next time I'll use the cayenne. The chili powder was ok, but I think cayenne would be better. All and all, a keeper. My DH raved.

Fast, easy and delicious. I only used a scant shake of cayenne pepper 'cos my family are not heat eaters.
