Wow! Too much work with the tortillas. Plus I thought the mousse was bland. I added scallions and capers and ditched the tarragon. Then I spread the mouse on tortillas, rolled them up, wrapped in plastic over night and cut them in spirals. A big winner and much easier to make and eat for the group of card players at my house

Just okay. The best part ended up being the tortilla rounds.

Made for a cocktail party and they dissapeared however next time I would go heavier on the herbs/spices. Was a little bit bland but still very good.

This was delicious and not very difficult to make. It doesn't have a strong flavor or so my husband says. You may want to season accordingly. My friends gave it rave reviews.

We've made this recipe a few times for catered meetings. It was so easy and so good. I would recommend this to anyone throwing a party. You can make everything in advance and people will love it.

Haven't made yet, but will this week, sounds fantastic! But, I will serve on toasted baguette. Don't you think more traditional?

Haven't made it yet, but wouldn't it be easier to brush both sides of the whole tortilla with oil BEFORE cutting out the individual rounds?
