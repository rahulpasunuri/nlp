Terrific recipe; a little time consuming when making it for a large party (20 thighs), but worth it. Everyone raved about them. Used proscuitto and chicken broth. Browned the thighs ahead and kept warm in low oven for an hour; then finished them right before eating. The browning took at least 10 minutes to get all sides. Served with vegetable paella. Great side for this recipe. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Chicken-Thighs-Stuffed-with-Plantain-and-Serrano-Ham-238286#ixzz2Motgi6DZ

I wish the coating was crunchier

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I used plantain, batata (could not find the cuban variety suggested), cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of cayenne in the mash. I used jamon serrano, however, I used think chicken breast cutlets in place of thighs - which I would also highly suggest. You just need to slightly cut back on some of the cooking times.

31/2 forks on this one. I've been wanting to make this for a while, and I'm glad I made it last night. I followed suggestions to add a pinch of cinamon, nutmeg, and cumin. I also added some chipotle chili flakes to the mash. I used proscuitto. Finished the sauce with a tb of butter for a silkier texture. Served with rice, Cuban black beans, and avocado tomato mint salad. Yum!

Excellent! The whole family loved it and I added cinnamon, nutmeg, butter, and green chiles to the mash.

Made this twice, if you can believe it -- once on a trial run here in Canada, and once in the Caribbean while visiting. Great on both occasions! The plantain/sweet potato mix is awesome in this. Now, some of you may be saying to yourself, "Big deal, who needs to go with serrano or prosciutto -- they use regular ham in Cordon Bleu, so that's what I'll use here." Those of you who are thinking that, ask someone in the room to slap you upside of the head. The genius of this recipe is the interplay of the spicy ham with the calming vegetable mash. Wicked awesome all round, and major presentation points. Go for it!

Easy to make, I liked the idea of using chicken thighs, they were very juicy and not as dry (compared to chicken breasts). I added a little bit of soy milk (vanilla flavor), 2 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon, to the plantain-sweet potato mix and the result was excellent!!! The saltiness of the serrano ham and the sweetness of the (plantain-sweet potato) together was an explosion of flavors.

Elegant and very tasty dish. Good for company, as you can make it ahead of time and keep warm in the oven. I also added a little cinnamon and a pinch of cumin to the mash.

I thought this entree was great! I spiced up the "mash" with some chipotle powder, sweet paprika, and cinnamon. I also chopped up some green chilis, not too many, just enough to add a little spice. Served with gold potatoes in a mexican cream sauce, and a salad to add a little color!

Tasty, fairly easy meal. Good for a weeknight, but unusual enough to serve to guests. Looked nice when it came out of the pan. The ham got good and crispy around the edges. The salty of the ham goes nice with the sweet filling. I agree you could experiment with adding some different spices.

Excellent meal! I used regular sweet potato and some leftover deli ham - still turned out very yummy! My three year old enjoyed it as well.

Nice recipe, but needs a little finessing. The log of sweet potato and plantain would be better if the mixture was spread over the ham and then rolled. The log gets a little too dry with this recipe and giving the ham a chance to add flavor to the mix would be good. On the next go around I'd probably add a bit of achiote to the meat and maybe just a bit of poblano to the starch mixture. Also the added achiote would intensify the flavor of the sauce.

Alot of flavor and easy to make. How can you beat that. I'll be making for friends this weekend.

I made this for a weeknight dinner and was amazed with the flavor packed into this dish. The whole house smelled great! I will definately make this one again.
