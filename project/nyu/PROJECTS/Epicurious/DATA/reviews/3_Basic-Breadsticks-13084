Made these with my 20 month old daughter and two of her friends. She helped me to make the dough yesterday - particularly good at oiling the bowl. Then today we cut the dough and the three of them rolled out the breadsticks. We added an egg wash and the kids got to sprinkle seeds all over. They had a whale of a time, and we all got to eat the breadsticks with hummous for lunch! They were delicious. An easy, fun and tasty baking activity with the littl'uns that didn't involve any sugar, artificial food colourings or other nasties. Fabulous.

Plenty of great recipes that require much less work! Added rosemary and oregano to the dough to get a nice flavor out. Also, mixed in whole wheat in 1:1 ratio.

This is a huge favorite with friends and family. I cannot make enough; kids love them. I usually make a number of batches around the holidays. They are a great hostess gift. I roll them out long and thin and they make a beautiful centerpiece as well as being delicious. I have talked to folks for whom I have made the sticks and have not seen for a few years. One of the things they always ask when we see each other again is if I am still making the breadsticks.

I tried this recipe on a whim when I was looking for a fun alternative to dinner rolls. It has now become a staple of my weekly baking. They make a great hostess gift and I find they keep well in an airtight container for a week or so.

This recipe is quite good if you give it some kick (plain breadsticks are quite plain indeed!). I added parmesan cheese to the dough and then basted the sticks in egg and rolled them in more cheese and herbs (my personal favorite is oregano, but rosemary also worked well). Yummy yummy, to accompany meals or as a snack!

Tasted these hot from the oven and thought they were rather bland.I then dipped them in melted butter and they tasted better,but then anything dipped in butter tastes good.These were easy to make,but the amount of time involved wasn't worth the result.I I made the Parmesan breadsticks with the egg wash and parmesan cheese in the dough and on top of the breadstick.

It is a shame that this recipe does not include the variations that were presented in the original magazine article. The Parmesan Breadsticks (a variation) are the best I have ever made. To make them use olive oil as your fat. Add 1/4 cup grated Parmesan to the flour and salt. Continue as directed in the recipe. After forming the breadsticks brush with an egg wash and roll in grated Parmesan before baking. I've been making these for years and they are always well received.

Halfed the recipe but thought that they either tasted too yeasty or the olive oil was overpowering. Would probably not make again...too much work for something not that good!!!

I enjoy baking bread and rolls. However, this recipe was a disappointment for the amount of time spent. The breadsticks were pale in color and rather dry and flavorless.

Very easy to prepare and even easier to eat.

Excellent recipe. The only problem with it is that I can't make them fast enough to keep up with the demand. Works very well adapted to bread machine dough setting, too.
