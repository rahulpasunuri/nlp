Much better lemon chicken recipes on this site. If you use, cook on very low as sugar in recipe will burn. Desperately needs salt.

I used all the ingredients in the amounts listed, but made the following changes: I used boneless chicken breasts and since I don't have a grill, I sauteed the chicken in a pan. Also, I froze the chicken with the marinade since I could not cook it on the night that I had originally planned. Not sure if it was in the marinade too long, but my husband and I both thought that it was overwhelmingly "lemony". I might try it again, but I'll add more garlic and not marinate for so long.

Loved it -- used boneless chicken breasts instead of the suggested pieces. Also didn't include the cayenne pepper. As we were short on time, we let it marinade for approximately 1 hour before cooking and found the flavor to be about as strong as we would like.

The warm, spring weather (finally!) called for grilling out. Used the suggestion to add 1 tbsp. soy sauce instead of salt. Marinated for only a couple of hours. The flavor needed more depth. Might make it again, but would marinate over night. We enjoyed it, but it wasn't a showstopper.

I made this with skinless chicken breasts instead of legs. I was really tangy. I might decrease the amount of zest a tiny bit. I would definitely make it again.

Just another boring chicken recipe, in my opinion. Not much flavor or interest.. and chicken is not exciting to begin with - really need something more.

I was running a little short on time, but didn't want to miss out on any flavor, so I made this recipe with the exact ingredients, in the exact amounts, but a slightly different methodology. I put the lemon and lime zest in a bowl with the chopped garlic and a nice big pinch of kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper. I then rubbed this mixture all over the chicken leg quarters that I had both poked with a fork and scored slightly with a sharp knife on the top and the bottom. I then whisked the remaining ingredients together and poured it over. Let this sit for two hours, turning once, the grilled 30 minutes on a gas Weber set on low-low-low, basting both sides half way through. Perfect! I think an even longer marinade would be better, and next time I might double the marinade so that I could brush some non-raw chicken tainted marinade over the finished product.

I made this for a family cookout this summer and we also made our family favorite BBQ Chicken, and this was the first thing to be eaten!! NO LEFTOVERS, we all loved it.

This was a wonderful recipe especially for summer. I made several extra pieces and chilled for the following day. The chicken was wonderful and extra juicy served cold as a chicken sandwich or in a chicken salad. Even my two year old would eat this dish.

Much better than the average chicken dish. It was perfect for a summer evening dinner with a light, fresh citrus taste. Excellent!

Very good chicken recipe. My family gets sick of the same old chicken all the time and found this to be a nice surprise. Very flavorful and moist! I also added soy sauce, but no extra garlic. I will definitely be making this again...

Followed the suggestions to add soy sauce and more garlic -- delicious grilling recipe!

Great find. My kids are so tired of chicken that I had to bribe them to try one more recipe. This dish won great praise from all of them. I had no limes so used double the lemon and extra garlic.

An excellent grilled chicken dish for those hot & sultry days of summer. We embellished the marinade by substituting soy sauce for the salt and tossed in about 1/4 tsp of grated fresh ginger. Serve with a cool cucumber salad and pan-roasted fingerling potatoes. Soothing & delicious.

One of the best, most unique grilled chikcen recipes I've seen. The marinade will NOT taste good by itself; it's very bitter. But let the flavor sink into the chicken. I let it sit overnight. The grilling burns away the bitterness, but keeps the nice, mellow flavor.

I made this with a couple of additions and it turned out great. Even my husband liked it! I used a bit more garlic and added a tablespoon or so of soy sauce. I also marinated it for about six hours because I had to work late.

I have made this a few times and it is a good dish, but not necessarily a great dish. The lemon lime mixture doesn't impregnate the meat as much as I thought it would. I would make it again, but there are chicken dishes that I like much better.

Outstanding recipe for grilled chicken . . . tangy, moist and delicious. Used thighs and half-breasts instead of legs and they were done perfectly. Marinated for 1 1/2 hours. Three hours might be even better.
