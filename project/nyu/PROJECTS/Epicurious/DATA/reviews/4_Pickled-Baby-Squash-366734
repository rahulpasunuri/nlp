This is an easy crowd pleaser! I have served it four times already (although I halved the sugar -- I didn't like it quite that sweet) and it has been a hit with 3-year-olds to 80+. We've eaten them as a snack, as a side dish and (my personal favorite) on burgers! Really refreshing on warm days. Yummm!

I was looking for a recipe for quick pickled summer squash, and this was right on the money. It came out a little too sweet for my taste, but I think I may have accidentally put in more than 1 tsp of sugar, so that's probably my fault. My husband, who normally has to have his arm twisted to eat vegetables, helped himself to seconds. Score!!
