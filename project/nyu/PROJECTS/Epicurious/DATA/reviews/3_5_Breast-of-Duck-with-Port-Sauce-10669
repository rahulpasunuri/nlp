The marinated duck was absolutely delicious. Really nice flavors. I know what a drag it is when reviewers change the recipe, but I'll do it anyway. Strapped for time, I decided to forgo the sauce and just reduced the marinade (I added a big splash of port and a spoonful of golden syrup before reducing). I would do this again next time. It was really easy and very good. I also made the cherry/shallot confit, but we thought it was too strong and that it overpowered the delicious flavors in the marinated duck. I will definitely use the marinade recipe for making duck in the future.

Absolutely the BEST duck recipe I have ever used. We did not marinade the duck and it was still fantastic. The sauce is unbelievable.

This sauce is fabulous. A lot of trouble, but worth it! I am not sure the marination is really needed. I have made it with and without, just seasoning the duck well. I love it either way!

This is one of the fussiest recipe I have ever seen for adding very little extra flavor. Way too many steps and the marinate is un-neccessary. Way too much time spendt on a duck breast that has great flavor to begin with that by the time you are done with marinating and adding sauce and then.....adding confit? Way too much.

This is an exceptional recipe. It requires attention to detail while preparing the sauce but it is sooo worth the effort. Amazing flavors with great depth....don't cheat on the time to marinate...if anything, leave the breasts in a little longer. I had reservations about the Cherry Shallot Confit while preparing it but it was a delightful addition to a fantastic dish.

If I didn't make this dish for Christmas dinner, I would have to face major grief from my husband! I've been making this for Christmas dinner for at least 5 years and it has become a tradition. It is fairly labour intensive, but well worth the effort. If one can perform steps ahead of time, it does aid in prep time. Absolutely delicious with the accompanying Cherry Shallot Confit and garlic mashed potatoes.

This sauce just doesn't complement the duck well, it masks rather than enhances the natural flavors. It might go better with a leg of lamb. I over thickened it, so be judicious when adding the butter/flour mixture. For the person who asked about making the sauce ahead, just trim some fat from the breasts prior to cooking.

I have made this twice for company with rave reviews! I did a lot of the preparation prior to my guests arrival by searing the duck and completing the most labour intensive part of the sauce. When we were almost ready for the main course I popped the duck in the oven to complete cooking and put the finishing touches to the sauce. If I had started the sauce while the duck was in the oven, the duck would have been seriously overdone. The sauce took me about 25 minutes! Well worth the effort!

This was an incredible recipe! The duck turned out fabulous and the sauce is such a nice complement to the duck. I did use shallots instead of onion in the sauce. Turned out wonderful. I cannot wait to make it again. My hsuband rated this recipe a definite 4 stars!

Making it for the 2nd time today and it is FABULOUS!! The sauce is great - piquant and luscious - beware not to overdo the port - makes it too sweet. Also, a white pungent onion (not sweet) is necessary for the right flavor. Never having cooked duck before, I didn't know what to do with the pan to saute so I put a very thin film of oil in it - not necessary. They will not stick and will brown perfectly. Also, to get the skin crispy, I think you need to be in command of the heat. I've got an industrial stove and it's unsurpassed for heat. Probably the key. FYI - been buying Maple Leaf Farms' prepackaged duck breasts (4 in a pack) and they're fine.

Short on time, I followed a previous suggestion; we grilled the breasts and used the reduced marinade for the sauce. It was exceptional!! I will try the original version when I have more time just to see what the fuss is about. Do try this recipe.

One of the best recipes I've ever made - my family agrees too! It is LOTS of trouble but worth it. I agree that the cooking time on the duck is too much - I only put mine in the oven for a few minutes. It makes way too much sauce for just one meal, but that's great because I save the extra sauce and then use as gravy with rotisserie chicken the following night. For those wondering if it's good with chicken - I say definitely - and is also good spooned over mashed potatoes!

This recipe is not for the novice! Careful planning and execution (i.e. concentration required) is key to making this work. The result is well worth the cumbersome execution. I found that the meat was too well done though. After 10 minutes, skin side down, in the pan and 2 minutes on the other side - it was more than done. No need to put it in the oven. The batch size on the marinade and sauce is disproportionatly large. I would halve both those parts of the recipe next time. To the person questioning whether this would work with chicken I would have to say no. Duck breast is more like beef than chicken so the flavors won't work well. Try it with a nice piece of beef instead.

Question: How do you make the sauce ahead of time without the fat from the duck breast? Comment: I would imagine this won't work with chicken as there isn't enough fat.

I made a number of small duck breasts, and the suggested dried cherry recipe, and together they were just great. Wild rice and brussel sprouts, then a great Devil's food cake from Bon App 3/04 and there were a lot of smiles. Plan to use the duck at a family holiday.

Question: Anyone know how this would be like if I used chicken instead of duck? I'd be very greatfull. cheers!

This has become my signature gourmet dish. I always prepare the sauce the day before when I begin to marinate the duck. Then the day of prep is a breeze and you can spend time with your guests. I like to serve this with potatoes Anna that I make w/ duck fat instead of clarified butter. I auction a gourmet dinner for six at my son's school and always use this recipe to rave reviews.

Cheating on my response here b/c my mother made this dish for my birthday dinner. VERY INVOLVED but worth the effort. This is one of the few recipes on this site I have given 4 forks. Splurge and try it! p.s. we roasted the whole duck on a spit over the bbq.

While this took a bit of prep work, my husband and I were able to whip this up without mishap. It is now his favorite way to eat duck. I made it with only one duck breast, so we would have extra sauce. The spouse liked the sauce so much, he ended up using it as a base for a dressing for spinach salad the next night. Me, I thought the suace was ok, but it made me think of the sauce served with moo shu. But it was good!

This recipe was terrific if you have the 2+ hours it takes to make. It was not a good choice for entertaining guests, because the sauce was very labor-intensive. I think you could make everything ahead for the sauce, and reheat it with the addition of the duck juices and it would taste the same. Also, I would reduce the amt of beurre marnie called for in the sauce, probably in half.

Thanks for the short cut to the reviewer from Ontario! Grilled the breast, instead -- phenom! 10 mins skin side down; 4 mins on other side. Let rest 10 mins before slicing. Served with reduced marinade. Incredibly impressive and delicious.

I followed the advise of the others and my duck and sauce came out great. Watch the cooking time. My duck was a bit smaller but was done almost 30 minutes sooner than the recipe calls for. My husband raved and I who don't even liked duck look forward to eating this again

Very good. I made it with 8 duckling breasts as opposed to 2. (Same overall weight) and served one breast a person (carved). Prepped up to adding the cream in the sauce about 3 hrs before guests arrived. And reheated sauce slowly &baked breasts. Great recipe!!

I prepared this for our gourmet club and while it was somewhat complicated to prepare it was perhaps one of the best dishes I have ever prepared. The port sauce was punctuated by the vinegars, port wine, and red wine as well and the pan drippings.. The dried Cherry Confit completed the meal and enhanced the overall POW of flavor.

If you ever find yourself, like me, with a couple of duck breasts in the fridge on a Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock and not enough time to make this delicious looking recipe, you may want to try my shortcut... Most important: my husband liked it so much that he nearly licked his plate! I marinated the duck breasts for a few hours at room temperature. I roasted them as indicated in the recipe but I used the marinade to make the gravy. I removed the garlic, reduced the marinade to approximately half, used the beurre manie to thicken the gravy and added some table cream. The result was absolutely delicious. I made the confit with dried cranberries instead of cherries and it was excellent with the duck breasts. A Passionate Cook from Oakville, Ontario, Canada

We made this for Valentine's Day, and it's definitely a keeper! It's not a "day of" recipe, but well worth it! The sauce was incredible! I felt like Julia Child. :)

I can't understand why the reviews were so back and forth on this recipe. Although it sounds daunting, its really very easy to prepare if you have any confidence in the kitchen. The meat was juicy and full-flavored. The confit was just the perfect touch of sour and savory. The sauce finished it with truly complex, palatable flavors. I made it for Valentine's Day starting with oysters, served with pureed root vegetables and the confit, and ending with a very, rich chocolate dessert. It is a stellar special occassion dish. I did halve it and marinated the duck for 20 hours...

Definitely not a "spur of the moment" recipe, but a successful one none the less. The port, cream, balsamic vinegar and reductions make a rich, complex sauce. I prefer to serve over wild rice cooked in 1/2 duck stock and 1/2 water. Since I had it, I also used a rich duck stock in place of beef for a more focused flavor.

Our Christmas dinner. This was delicious. And so easy. My husband brought home mushroom broth, which we substituted for beef broth, with excellent results. The portions and the cooking times are perfect. The marinade fantastic. Tender, juicy, rich. We had it with carmelized onion mashed potatoes.

Have now made this three times and it was a hit each time. It is a bit involved but worth it. I used dried cranberries instead of cherries in the confit and they were great. Wonderful flavour, great sauce, tender duck.

This has become my signature dish. But only b/c of the following modifications: marinate it for 40 hours use veal/duck demiglace instead of broth serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and your guests will love it!

Made this recipe with wild duck and should have marinated it for much longer than the 2-6 hours recommended. Not a strong enough cherry flavor - the port really overpowers it. I wouldn't make this again.

My friend hunted for mallard duck breasts and asked me to prepare them. I used this recipe and marinated them for 48 hours, knowing the wild game would be especially tough. We made a dinner party for four out of this, what a success! Next time I will use a more domestic version and will probably give it 4 forks! I used red wine instead of port to make the sauce a little less pungent, and prepared the sauce ahead of time; adding the buerre manie upon reheating to thicken.

Served at a dinner party, all conversation ceased as guests began to eat. The oohs and ahhs were well worth the effort. As one reviewer suggested, we prepped up to the final stage of sauce, and finished duck in oven then. Confit is excellent with it. YUMMM!

The sauce holds up very well if you make it a day ahead just slowly reheat it. Also, the marinade is great on other game birds.

have made it many times. great for a dinner party, as you can do sauce and saute duck ahead and finish duch in oven while heating sauce. Fabulous-always gets raves!
