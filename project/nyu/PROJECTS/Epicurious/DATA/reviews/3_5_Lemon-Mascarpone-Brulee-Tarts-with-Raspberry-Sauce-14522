A crowd pleaser. I would reduce the sugar in the future. I used a large tart pan instead of the individual ones, which made it difficult to cut into because the filling is creamy after the sugar on top is burned. Still it was a lovely, tasty dessert.

This is my all-time favorite dessert for my birthday! My husband made it several years ago and it always receives rave reviews from the guests. Great for breakfast the next morning if there are any leftovers.

I have made this a couple of times and each time to rave reviews. It is delicious but I find it very time consuming. It is worth it though if you want an impressive dessert.

Cutting down on the sugar definitely made a difference; was an appropriately sweet filling with less sugar. I made one large tart instead of the eight individual and recipe worked fine. The only difference is you don't need all the dough for the crust. Other than that, the dessert was EXCELLENT! My guests loved it. The raspberry puree was a nice complement and I loved the texture and taste of the filling.

This was an outstanding compliment to my dinner menu. The tarts were full of flavor and easy to make. The crust was especially tasty - and simple.

I've made this recipe twice. It looked and tasted great. I do recommend cutting down on the sugar in the filling to 1 cup. Also if you can't fing fine granulated sugar for the Brulee, I put regular sugar through a clean coffee grinder for a few seconds, it worked well.

This is a very rich wonderful dessert! I had a little trouble with torching or broiling the superfine sugar; I believe it would help to sift it over to get an even amount over the top so it carmelizes evenly!

Too sweet! Presentation is great but the filling was a little runny when you cut into it.
