This was awful. Absolutely dreadful. Sorry. I tossed the chutney and made a simple mango chutney instead because I didn't have the heart to throw out all the chicken. The chutney is inedible. My husband and I could not believe how gross it was. The chicken is below average and tastes a bit like dirt and was a huge waste of spices. Do not make this please!!

This recipe definitely benefitted from the addition of fresh pressed garlic and lemon juice. I also substituted a homemade chutney based on apples and piri-piri. A delicious, healthy meal.

I often wonder if the people who say a recipe has no flavor are heavy smokers. Cigarettes and cigars kill the taste buds (if not the whole person. Maybe the reviewers should identify themselves as smokers or non-smokers!!!! Hey, epicurious could add a check box to the reviewer screen for "smoker" or "non-smoker". Just think of the wicked comments we could sling at one another by knowing this information!

Good call on the personal choice of adding salt,garlic and lemon juice, it only takes a little imagination and initiative to make this great recepie into a keeper !!

The tandoori marinade needs real pressed garlic and the juice of 1/2 a lemon to perk it up. Worked well on chicken breast with bone, rubbing the marinade both over and under the skin. I broiled in pan on center rack, skin side down for 10 minutes, then skin side up for 10, then reduced heat to 425 for final 10 minutes, again skin side down - a technique from Pierre Franey that's worked for me with many chicken breast recipes. The leftovers make a great chicken salad. Shred the chicken and toss in a bowl with sliced celery, minced scallion & cilantro, and dress with a miixture of non-fat plain yogurt, low-fat mayo, lemon juice, s&p, and a bit of mustard seed.

I thought this was okay, but not great -- although I'll admit that I skipped the cardomon, and may have overcooked the chicken a little. And I didn't make the chutney. Also, I broiled it -- would probably be better over charcoil grill.

This chicken got rave reviews from my picky friends from SF. I will make it again in a heart beat. I found that yogurt on the plate with the chutney adds a cool texture and flavor.

Like several of the others, I am very surprised at the negative reviews on this recipe. I'll admit that the chutney was just OK, but the flavor of the resulting chicken was terrific. A real keeper.

Great flavor for chicken. One tip - if (like me) you couldn't get fresh mint, don't use mint extract! It killed the chutney and I had to throw it away uneaten. I will have to do it again when I can find the mint fresh. No matter, the in-laws (Thai) loved it!!

I'm with the last couple of reviewers, Austin and Atlanta. I halved the marinade and used it on 4 large bone in chicken breasts which I 1/4" slashed before marinating. I baked them with the marinade left on, in the oven at 375 degrees for 40 minutes on a foil lined shallow pan. They were delicious with the really good tomato chutney which I made verbatim.

I was skeptical as I put the marinade together and even while I cooked it, but it was excellent. Mild in flavor but really tender. I would make this chicken again and maybe add it to a salad

I've made this recipe several times to rave reviews. I marinate it longer than specified and substitute a coriander chutney for the one mentioned here. Not sure what planet the rest of these folks are on.

I only made the chutney (chicken is chicken). Although I didn't love it, I think it did serve it's purpose as a chutney - which is to add contrast to the dish with which it's served. Beyond that, folks, it's only personal preference. Dana Wherever California person is lucky enough to be "the one" who is able to determine what is good and bad for EVERYONE! Moreover, s/he has the power to cast shame upon a publication for printing this recipe! What pressure! Is that an elected position or by appointment?

Everyone's taste buds are different. One person may be able to eat a scotch bonnet pepper without blinking an eye, but another may start crying just by looking at it. It's rude to assume that the cook did something wrong because they thought it was bland. Judging, however, from many of the reviews, it sounds as though the chicken IS bland for those who like it spicier.

I wish I'd read the reviews about the relish being so awful. I'm of the same opinion; it simply is not worth making. I didn't love the chicken; perhaps it could've used a squeeze of lemon, fresh garlic, and salt?? My guests didn't rave as they usually do when I make something they love. Luckilly, my reputation was saved by dessert-- try the blueberry tart (Aug.2002, B.A).

The chutney was "ghastly"? LOL!! Couldn't agree more-- it was much too heavy on the ginger, to the point of being ridiculous. The chicken was fair, not great by any means. Doubtful that I'd make again.

Loved the chicken as did our guests. The chutney was only ho-hum however. We did the grilled eggplant w/yogurt-mint sauce (same issue) and I used that sauce on the chicken instead of the chutney. I'd do the chicken again but probably not the chutney

Those of us who didn't like this recipe should not be made to feel as though our cooking skills lack. Dana Point may very well have not done something "wrong"-- she/he just didn't care for the chicken. For that matter, neither did I. To me, it WAS bland. How is a half-teaspoon of cardamom, cinnamon, etc. supposed to make an impression on all that meat, while at the same time drowned in yogurt? The chutney was ghastly. As someone else mentioned, the ginger was overpowering. So I guess as far as seasoning goes (for this recipe at least) Bon Appetit either hits us over the head with a flavor, or else completely masks it. Obviously, I'd never make this again, even if my family hadn't begged me not to.

Four forks for the chicken, two for the chutney. If I make it again I'll use half the ginger, as it was overpowering. The chicken didn't necessarily need the chutney anyway. Dana Point, if your marindae was tasteless, you did something wrong. Maybe your spices are too old and have lost their flavor.

Having grown up in an Indian household with a very similar grilled chicken recipe that always gets raves, I can't imagine how the last reviewer found this "tasteless." Agree with another reviewer that it improves a lot if you substitute fresh garlic and ginger and onion, pureed together, to the marinade. And it MUST be allowed to marinate overnight.

This was disgusting. The marinade was tasteless, and the chutney was so bad I threw it out before I had the chance to humiliate myself and serve it to my guests. I whipped up a tangy yogurt sauce instead which helped mask the taste (or lack thereof) of the meat. Won't ever make again, and urge you not to, either. Shame on Bon Appetit.

I ended up baking the chicken in the oven because my grill had run out of propane, but it was still very tasty!

Delicious... I have made this twice already. The second time I used cut-up chicken pieces with skins, which was tasty on the grill, too.

I thought this chicken turned out great. I used fresh ginger and garlic instead of dried, which I feel added to the flavor. I also serves it with a mint yogurt sauces and folded it all up inside pitas. It was so easy I plan on making again soon.

We used the leftover chutney on broiled fish and it was delicious!

I generally use the rule "double all spices" when making Bon Appetit recipes-- though usually tasty, I almost never find their marinades flavorful enough. I did that, but still found the chicken bland. It was also in desperate need of a good shake of salt. I was disappointed, and, by the amount leftovers sitting in the fridge, my guests felt the same way. The chutney also failed to impress. If you're looking for an Indian style dish, I suggest trying Tandoor-Style Grilled Chicken (Bon Appetit, July 2001) for a much yummier recipe.

This was very good, and make sure you make the chutney also. very easy and good!

The chicken was delicious as long as you're careful not to overcook it. The chutney, however, was too strong for our taste. I had some pineapple salsa in my refrigerator from a dinner party the previous night, and I added it to the chutney to soothe the bite. I would recommnend the chutney only for adventurous palates.

I marinated this chicken for about 40 hours and it was moist and flavorful. I thought the chutney was just OK, but my husband liked it a lot. I would have preferred a cucumber raita or something like it instead of the chutney. The chicken itself was very good and I will make again.
