Double the recipe and triple the spices.

This was good, but even with more vegetables than the recipe called for (green beans, yellow squash, extra zucchini), it definitely wasn't enough to feed four. Next time I'm going to add more tomatoes and give it 30 minutes in the oven to meld the flavors a bit more.

This recipe was good. I used more eggplant and substituted a can of fire-roasted, crushed tomatoes. I also used only 1 T oil (to make it healthier) doubled the spices and added some veggie broth. I would make it again but would probably pre salt my eggplant so that it doesn't end up bitter.

Perfect simple great rat. Over polenta or Israeli couscous sounds interesting.I used 2 zuchinni and I add some hot Italian sausage sometimes when I want some meat with it. Fennel was an inspiration though also like the fennel bulb idea. Of course more garlic and a little wine or balsamic vinegar.

LOVED THIS. I've never made or had ratatouille before, and going into it I think I was a bit skeptical of a one pot dinner with no meat/carbs. I'm a believer now. The flavors are bursting---love the fennel. Also love that this recipe didn't require cooking each vegetable separately or layering the veggies. Easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe. The leftovers are great.

I used less oil (2 T to start and 1 T when I added the zucchini) and less basil (1/4 c). Otherwise, I would make this exactly as written next time. (This time I didn't have enough red pepper, used yellow zucchini, and subbed some canned crushed tomatoes because of what I had in the kitchen.) This recipe is a definite winner, and I suspect it's also very forgiving in terms of what vegetables you use.

This is very good and very easy. Add 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up. For a meatless entree, serve over quinoa cooked in vegetable broth; sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.

I couldn't believe how delicious this was. It takes almost no time to make and uses only a few spices and herbs but has so much flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

This is by far the best ratatouille I have ever eaten and my family, not the best eggplant eaters, gobbles it up. When I took some to work and shared it with colleagues, they all agreed the fennel in particular makes it outstanding. Also like how the vegetables become tender but not soupy. I use yellow squash instead of zucchini. Otherwise exactly as written. Really spectacular.

This recipe is a regular feature in our house! With the zucchini and red bell pepper step, I also add quartered rimini mushrooms, an 8 oz box or more -- they add an 'al dente' texture, and mild flavor. I also add 1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper spice at the end. (Sometimes I add 1-2 T of apple cider vinegar at the end.) I ALWAYS use fresh tomatoes, somehow they seem to make a real difference for me. And we serve it with a hot crusty bread with unsalted butter. Yummm...!!

This is by far the best ratatouille I have made. I added 3 Tbsp of good quality balsamic vinegar and raw pine nuts at the end. As others have commented, it may be the cooking at a fairly high temperature that makes a difference.

Everything a ratatouille should be. I just made this and I agree with all of you - great recipe! I am asking myself why this one is so good? The medium high heat is perfect to carmelize the onions and the eggplant. Each step takes as long to cook as it does to slice the next step. I used canned tomatoes. If you do this, you need to drain them. (I did and saved the juice in case I needed it) I made a double recipe and it fills a small wok - 10-12 cups. The spices are nice too. I made it just as specified except for the canned tomatoes.

Best Ratatouille recipe ever. agree whole heartedly. This was just enough for 2 people - trust me, make double if you want more than that. It is lighter and more fresh tasting than any other recipe. tastes like summer.

Fantastic. Added fresh oregano, a little wine, served over polenta which I made during the last ten minutes of simmering. Whole family loved!

Definitely worth doubling. This is a really lovely ratatouille recipe, my only complaint is that it was a relatively paltry amount. I used lovely summer vegetables from the farmers market, making it both economical and delicious.

This is THE ratatouille recipe! Don't leave out the fennel seeds and coriander- they give depth without overwhelming. This is just like I learned in culinary school back in the day. My kids got to help with the chopping, and we gobbled up a double recipe with almost no leftovers!

This turned out really nice, it was my first try at Ratatouille. I wanted to use up some beautiful eggplant and a bunch of veggies I recently picked up at the farmers market. I used several small eggplants in stead of one large. I used green curly Italian peppers instead of a red pepper because I didn't have one. I used herbs de provence instead of the other herbs out of convenience. I served it over smashed potatoes. The creaminess of the potatoes made it a good accompaniment. I would make this again.

Rating: 4
This is really the gold standard of ratatouille. I have had friends over who had only ever had soupy, tomato-saucy ratatouille and they couldn't believe get over how fabulous this is. You can really taste all of the vegetables and herbs. This is a summertime classic and is frequently requested by friends and family alike (and is the entire reason I grow several eggplants in my garden). The only change I make is not to add the fennel because I can't stand the taste.

Rating: 4
This was just fabulous! I chopped all veggies, though, and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Seasoning was delish; highly recommend.

Rating: 4
Very nice dish. I didn't have a problem with it being too wet, maybe because my skillet was very hot? It has a really nice roasted flavor, and the taste of the caramelized onions is great! loved the idea of a ratatouille pizza a reviewer suggested. I am going to serve it tonight over spaghetti squash with some goat cheese on top! I think it would be nice atop quinoa as well.

Very good but a bit labor intensive. Substituted fresh thyme. Loved the ground coriander!

Hands down, the best ratatouille recipe ever. The seasoning blend is balanced, and the fennel seed just makes it. I made it with organic veggies from our CSA, and served it over red-skinned potatoes that I'd mashed and flavored with Greek yogurt. A fantastic vegetarian meal.

I have an add to my previous review...add a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar. You won't really taste it, but it adds a Je ne sais quoi factor that I can't define.

this recipe is yummy and easy. I added 1/2 teaspoon of herbes de provence. we served over spaghetti squash for a great vegetarian meal. Plan to simmer for just under an hour so it is mellow and not so watery.

This recipe seemed really wet to me when I finished. I ended up scooping out all the vegetables and reducing the juices on a high heat until it seemed more like a sauce and less like water. Not sure why it was so juicy.

We've tried a lot of Ratatouille recipes, and this is our favorite by far. To our way of tasting the eggplant and the herbs make the difference. I have used green peppers when I don't have red ones, and I use green tomatoes along with red ones as well. I also add a tablespoon of red wine vinegar from a previous recipe - it adds just a little extra zip. We have served this cold, at room temperature, and war - all with equally good results. It's a great "Make Ahead Dish."

I've made several versions of ratatouille, but this is the best to date. Maybe it's my homegrown eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and herbs, but my husband is so crazy about this, that I've made it twice and have promised him that I will make again later this week. Eggplant is by far the star of this and it cooks down to perfection. If there's any left next time, I'm thinking of trying grilled ratatouille pizza with fresh mozzarella, possibly topped with Italian sausage.

In regular rotation in our house. We serve with Israeli couscous, very good. I do add extra garlic and highly suggest simmering at low for an hour to allow the veggies to break down a bit and meld together.

I thought this was great. My boyfriend, amazingly, didn't care for it...he's not into vegetables. I made it exactly as written. The only thing I would do differently is add an extra clove of garlic and reduce the fennel seeds by half. I wouldn't omit the fennel, because as another reviewer said, it adds depth to the flavor. I just think it needs only a tiny bit to add the flavor without being overpowering. I will definitely make this again - a good, healthy, satisfying meal.

Yum! This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have fennel seed but it was still wonderful. My kids loved it too. I served it with grilled chicken and angel hair whole wheat pasta with garlic/olive oil. it was even better on its own the next day for lunch.

Have made this recipe over and over, the only things I do differently is adding mushrooms (fancy or plain) and substituting Herbs de Provence for the individual ones. I think the leftovers are even better the next day. A good crusty French baguette is a must for soaking up all the great juices.

Love this recipe! We had a farmshare box this summer and nearly all the ingredients came into season at the same time. This was the first time we had ever cooked with eggplant and it was delicious. Like another reviewer, we use green bell pepper when we don't have red, and use zucchini or summer squash depending which we have on hand. The texture works well with bow-tie pasta.

Amazingly easy, although there is a bit of chopping. It's delicious and freezes well. I've substituted green bell, when I don't have red. Super tasty.

"Serves 4."  HA! I knew my husband and I could easily finish this amount as a main course in one sitting, so I doubled it from the get-go. This was extremely delicious, all by itself. Other reviewers mentioned eating it over pasta but I thought that kind of diluted the flavors which were excellent all alone. Looking at the recipe I would have thought it would need parmesan or romano cheese on top, but honestly I didn't think it needed it - still tried it with a sprinkling of cheese though, and thought it was even better without it. Probably because the flavor of eggplant has always kind of reminded me of cheese. I actually used fresh rosemary instead of basil and it worked great. One thing is, I love my salt, but I thought this was a little too much. Doubling would have called for 1 ½ tsp, but I used at least ¼ tsp less.

This recipe is really yummy pretty much as is. I doubled it and added about 2 cups fresh green beans 'cause I had them on hand. Served it over rigatoni pasta with some grated parmesan cheese. It's delicious and healthy comfort food.

Visually delicious and oh so yummy! I took the advice of the cook from Menlo Park, the fennel seeds are key. To finish, I served over penne and topped with toasted pignoli nuts, some basil and oregano from my garden, and a sprinkle of parmigiano-reggiano.

Delicious! My family loved the eggplants the most... I didn't cut them into really thin slices but left them as thick strips. After cooking, the texture was wonderfully soft, not mushy and yet melted in our mouths! Apart from the fennel seeds, I also added 1 freshly sliced fennel bulbs, it made the dish really good without the strong licorice taste! My kids loved it! Can be eaten alone combined with fish, pasta or even ground meat!

Very, very good indeed. Specially if made a day ahead. I added yellow summer squash and used all fresh herbs from my garden. I also added a green bell pepper but didn't bother layering the ingredients. It turned out really tasty!

Easy, healthy, and delicious. Don't skimp on the fennel seeds---they add the touch that pulls it all together. The flavors are better blended the day after you make it. Use leftovers in burritos, as dip, etc. (Try a burrito w/ leftover ratatouille, roast pork, and black beans.)

Served at a friend's house where we watched ratatouille. It was great served over penne.

I've made this recipe several times, always trying a tweak here and there. Unless I have exceptional tomatoes, I use canned crushed tomatoes (28 oz) I also add thick sliced mushrooms to my vegetables, about half way into the zucchini/pepper cooking time. I use Herbes de Provence instead of the separate herbs listed (just for convenience) and just a minute or so before done, add about 1 TB of balsamic vinegar. You won't taste it, but it does add a dimension to the dish that we find very pleasing.

I let it simmer for a little longer than recommended because it seemed very wet. I made it ahead and put it in a caserole dish and topped with parmesan reggiano and broiled it at the end. There was not a single bite left. Great recipe.

What a delicious and easy ratatouille. If you want you (in winter) you can use canned tomatoes (I did a combination). I also added shredded gruyere at end and stuck under broiler for about 5 minutes.

So delicious. The ultimate comfort food. This recipe tastes rich without much time or effort. It tastes as if it took a lot of work and yet it's so easy! It also reheats very well. Don't let the eggplant scare you off. My husband doesn't care for eggplant, but in this recipe he eats every bite.

This was my first attempt at ratatouille and it was pretty good. One can tell that the flavors will meld better after a day. The only adjustments I made were adding an extra clove of garlic and using grey sea salt with lavender. It will be worth trying again later when the different varieties of tomatoes are ripe; I would have liked a stronger tomato presence.

Yum! I made this for my kids after seeing Ratatouille and they ate every bite. I made it with all fresh herbs from my garden and heirloom tomatoes--It was like eating a flavor burst. To round out the meal we had a crusty loaf of French bread and some really good French cheeses.

a great uncomplicated ratatouille. Versatile and very tasty. I've added other vegetables, even chunks of sausage. Tastes better each day and provides a guilt free indulgence for those of us on diets. Only modifications for my taste was extra garlic and a good sprinkling of parmesan. Why oh why do people complicate this dish?

This recipe turned out DELICIOUS. It was also very easy to make. I served it to company and they loved it. I made a few minor adjustments which were to add 2 teaspoons of Herb De Provence instead of all the other spices that were called for seperately, I put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled with mozzarella cheese and baked in 350 degree oven until cheese melted. My teenage sons loved it and it's very healthy for us! I will make this dish often.

This is a wonderful ratatouille recipe-- I can't get enough! I made a couple slight variations to the recipe. I added summer squash, and I am a huge spicy food fan so I added 2 fresh, finely chopped cayenne peppers. The spice gave this dish a wonderful kick! I highly recommend it!

Love ratatouille, but this was not my favorite recipe. I prefer the kind that is more of a stewy consistancy, while retaining the texture of the veggies. This one is a more chunky version. Nice flavor though.

Excellent, really love the effect of the combination of herbs and spices used. I added 1/4 cup of pitted kalamata olives, torn in half, when I added the zucchini, etc. Nicoise olives would work, too, and be even more authentic. If using olives, wait to salt until near the end, when you can better guage the effect of the olives on the saltiness of the dish.

Rating: 4
This ratatouille is really excellent as it stands, but here are a few suggestions: 1) Don't chop the bell peppers. Leave them in 3/4 inch strips. Also, skin them with a vegetable peeler before sauteeing. 2) For the tomatoes, a good brand of Italian "pelati" is fine. If using fresh tomatoes, take the skin off by blanching before adding to the mixture. (Don't skin the eggplant or the zucchini.)

Rating: 4
Loved it. I was surprised by how easy it really was. I have been searching for a good ratatouille recipe for a while and here it is. I have tried the Betty Crocker recipe, and this is far better, more flavor. My husband hates eggplant and ate this without question. Serve over polenta, yum!

Outstanding! My husband raved about this dish. Thanks for the hint regarding where to add the tomatoes. I also added 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar for a zesty touch. I served this recipe over chicken strips marinated in Zesty Italian dressing (about 15 minutes) and sauteed. I topped it with a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Delicious!

I've tried a lot of Ratatouille recipes, but this is our favorite - the herbs made the difference. I use green peppers when I don't have the red ones and green tomatoes along with the red when I have extra in the garden. Also, I add tablespoons red wine vinegar, as suggested in Ratatouille on the Run (Bon Appetit, February 1995) - it adds just a little extra zip. I have served this recipe cold, at room temperature, and hot - all with equally good results. It's a fabulous "Make Ahead Dish." In answer to the question about when to add the tomatoes, I add them when I add the zucchini and the peppers - works perfectly!
