Very good weeknight dinner. White wine can be substituted but I would highly recommend sticking with the vermouth and maybe add a bit more than listed. Also, I prefer this recipe with shrimp instead of chicken.

This was very good. While I had to deviate from the recipe a little, it was still very close and I would definitely do it again. I had boneless thighs, added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to the saute and sliced them into serving piece slices when cooked. I used only 1tbsp butter with the chicken pan reserve oil for the leeks & garlic. Did not have vermouth but used sherry and I did not drain the tomatoes. I also added one can of drained artichokes (plain, not marinated). Other reviewers helped me make these changes. Lastly, I did not use an entire cup of Parmesan, probably 1/3 to 1/2. I mixed some cheese into the cooked/drained pasta, divided into pasta bowls and topped with the chicken/tomato/leek mixture and sprinkled more cheese. All in all, this was GOOD, a nice mid-week meal as it was done in about 30 min and my son loved it as well. Had it today as a left over and still quite good. Go ahead, Enjoy!

This was pretty good, and with a baby in the house I loved how fast & easy it was. I halved the recipe but still used all the garlic. Used evoo instead of butter. Included some of the green from the leeks, which boosted the flavor a bit. Added red pepper flakes too. As you can see we like stronger flavors at our house!

Made half of the recipe for two, skipped the butter and used olive oil, reduced the time on cooking the leeks by about 3 minutes, used flax seed linguine and had an incredible meal.

Very good. Next time I would try shrimp instead of chicken and decrease the amount of pasta.

This was very tasty I thought. I halved the recipe but still used 2 leeks and only 6 ounces of pasta. I took advice from other reviewers and did not drain tomatoes and added a touch of cream at the end. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

My family and I have been making this recipe for years, and it is one of our all time favorites. The dish is easy to make and the flavors are fresh and balanced. The leeks are the foundation of the dish, so don't use any substitutes. Dry white wine works when you don't have vermouth handy. If you're not used to cooking with leeks, make certain you wash them well. I cut off the dark green top and the root section, then deeply slice (about half way through) the remaining onion from bottom to top. You can then fold open the onion and easily rinse out the flattened leaves.

I used regular onion, chopped fresh tomatoes, 1/4 c vermouth, 1/2 c chicken broth, artichoke hearts, and red pepper flakes, mini penne and diced the chicken. This will be a staple on my regular rotation.

I only used Grape Tomatoes cut in half. I thought it added a nice textural element to this recepie. I personaly could have use a little more vermouth as I was very pleased with how much that added to the flavor

Delicious family weeknight dinner,I did not drain tomatoes, and added some pasta water and heavy cream to sauce and simmered it some.

Pretty good; certainly fast and easy. I made several substitutions/omissions. No chicken, as I was chickened out the past week. Substituted soy pasta for real linguine (gluten-free diet)--nothing measures up to real pasta. Added artichokes which were good. Good enough I'd make it once in a while, but there's better to be had.

This is an excellent recipe! It's light, easy to prepare, and very tasty. It's makes a great summer dish.

Too many ingredients to give this a distinctive taste. Also leeks and tomatoes just don't go well together in my opinion as they don't complement each other. Still, my kids like it alot, and it certainly was not bad

Awesome pasta dish! I used several small shallots instead of regular onion. I like their milder flavor. I also heated up the plum tomatoes (including juice) separately and added some dliced red bell pepper and shitake mushrooms to it.

Rating: 3
Yum! I agree with the reviewers who suggested not draining the tomatoes. Easy and elegant--if you use Muir Glen organic tomatoes (so much better than traditional canned brands), fresh basil, and a good Pecorino romano, you're more than set for a dinner party. Can't wait to make this again.

When I first made this dish the leeks were a little gritty - unpleasant to say the least. I've since learned the trick to cleaning them: just put sliced leeks in a bowl of ice water, stirring to remove the dirt. After about 5 minutes, gently scoop out onto paper towels to dry. I haven't had a problem since. I like to use penne pasta and add a little whipping cream at the end to thicken the sauce. Delicious!

I started making this dish when it first appeared in the magazine (1992) and it has remained one of our regulars. It's easy, foolproof, provided you follow the recipe and looks beautiful. Don't substitute for the vermouth or leeks!

A delicious, easy, comforting dish that's been added to our list of "regulars". Don't skimp on the parmesan!

Made this recipe for a last minute dinner party. Very easy. Quick to prepare. Added about 2 Tbsp Olive oil to the pasta just before stirring with the sauce and cheese, made it much easier to stir. Very nice taste. Everyone seemed to enjoy.

Sorry to be a wet noodle but I found this recipe to be very average at best. It seemed liked it needed a little zip. Next time I would try adding some roasted red peppers or artichokes.

Great easy dish. Used basil, had no vermouth so I used some red wine. I would have put in mushrooms if I had some. I also put in a touch of cream and used pecorino-romano like the other reviewer suggested but I only put in 1/4 cup. (Tried to cut the fat down somewhere.) Very good. I also didn't drain the tomatoes, didn't read that part, and the sauce came out great!

Just wonderful! This was such an easy recipe to prepare and our whole family loved it. We prepared the "plain onion" version, but will certainly try it with the leeks next time. This one's a keeper.

Fantastic, easy recipe. Definitely use leeks and basil. I used even more basil than was called for and could have even used a little more. Used pecorino romano instead of parm - delicious!

liked this alot but am wondering if it would be even better with shrimp instead of chicken.

This is an extremely quick, easy and delicious recipe that's even better on the second day. The leeks are a great way to incorporate something fresh and green into a 30-minute recipe, especially during the dead of winter!

12 out of 10! My whole office asked for the recipe when I took the leftovers for lunch. Don't drain the tomatoes.

I followed Howard's suggestions and came up with a beautiful dish that even my veggie hating daughter enjoyed. She was a little worried that the leeks were some odd seafood, once they were cooked down, and once assured that they weren't squid parts, she totally enjoyed it. Definately will include this one in my repetoire..

This is a great 30-minute meal served just with a mesclun salad, followed by some good cookies. Instead of combining the chicken with the sauce to cook at the end, I cooked it all the way through on its own first and then served it sliced in strips on a separate plate. This way, chicken-lovers can put in top of the pasta and vegetarians can omit it. Great dish!

So delicous and simple to make. The complexity of the flavor is surprising. Don't drain the tomatoes! I added 1/4 cup chardonnay in place of the vermouth. Omitted the butter and used 1 tsp. of olive oil. This is now a weekly staple in our home.

This recipe was great and easy to prepare. I will make this again and again. We topped it off with TIRAMISÙ ANGEL CAKE TORTE from this site. Excellent dinner!

I used onions rather than leeks and found the flavor too strong. I also used crushed tomatos as one reviewer suggested and found the sauce became a bit too heavy. I may try again with whole tomatoes and leeks as the original recipe for a week-night dinner, but this recipe really wasn't anything special (definitely not something I would prepare for guests).

Good recipe. I've made this recipe about 10 times over the last year and each time I worked with it the dish has become progressively better to me. I used 1 tblsp butter and 2 TBLsp GOOD olive oil (essential) to soften the leeks (15 min) and in the final 5 min I added 1 TBLsp (or more!!) of garlic. I then "splashed" a decent chardonnay (Jacobs Creek 1999) over the mix and let the alcohol boil off...I did this another 2 times. At this point I added the fresh basil and a bit of oregano and the plum tomatoes. I let this simmer and meanwhile I tossed the sliced breast fillets (coated w/ some salt and pepper) in olive oil and grilled each side for 3 min (to get grill marks)and hold juices in fillets. I used a small stove top iron grill pan. I added the grilled chicken to the simmering tomato mix and continued simmering for another 20 or so minutes (splashed some more wine to the mix!!!). Tossed with linguine and parmesan and its a keeper.

This dish turned out surprisingly well. I reduced the fat to 1 tbsp. oil and 2 tbsp. butter with no problems. I used a whole can of crushed tomatoes, letting it simmer to thicken per Michelle's advice. I also added 1 tbsp. lite cream to the sauce, with wonderful results.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I added the juice from the tomatoes and simmered it on low until the sauce thickened a little. It was easy to prepare after a long day at work.

I am a young cook, and i made this recipe for my family last night and we decided that this was a keeper. I am always going on to this site for all diffrent meals. This one was by far the best of all of them. I did not use the baisil, although i did use pasta twists rather than linguini.

The finished dish was a bit dry until I added the rest of the stick of butter. Next time I may be a bit less inclined to carefully drain the tomatoes. Otherwise, this was delicious.

Wow! Surprisingly good! I made this dish for a friend of mine who loves pasta, leeks, and chicken; personally, I don't usually care for chicken dishes, especially those made with pasta. So, imagine my surprise when I found myself thoroughly enjoying this dish. It is light, but very flavorful. I made the chicken part two days ahead, so the flavors really had a chance to meld. I was able to reduce the butter to 1 - 2 T, though I added more garlic (of course!), and I added the Parmesan cheese to the sauce the first day I made it. I was out of fresh basil, so I added some dried basil to the sauce. Very, very easy and quick to make, and reheats very well. I also served it with fresh basil linguine - YUMMMMM!!!

I made this after reading the reviews and agree with the assessments. However, I added one can of diced tomatoes to the leftovers and prefered it that way.

Excellent pasta dish! Fairly easy and quick to make, just throw it together. We sprinkled a little parmesan or feta cheese on ours to complete it.

We eat this dish once a month or more - lots of my friends have added it to their "regulars". I eliminated the butter and use just a little bit of olive oil to saute the leeks, then keep the juice for the tomatoes for added moisture. A good alternative to basil is cilantro - I do both....
