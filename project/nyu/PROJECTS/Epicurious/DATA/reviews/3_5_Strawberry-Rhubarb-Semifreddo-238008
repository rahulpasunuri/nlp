I used all butter shortbread yet needed to add butter to the crust. I made strawberry rhubarb sauce (16 oz fruit, 1 tbl lemon, 2 tlb sugar cook for six minutes) as a topping. Very good and very pretty.

Even with all butter shortbread, I still needed to add about a half-stick of melted butter to get the crust to stick. But it was delicious!

I've made this recipe twice and the only problem I had was the crust falling apart. I, like the other reviewers, didn't use all butter shortbread cookies (I couldn't find them) but the mousse part is famtastic. I did increase the marscapone to a full cup the second time and liked it better. Since I love sweetness, I wouldn't change the fruit at all.

Dinner guests liked this. If you like mousse type desserts this is very good. I used regular (not all butter) shortbread cookies and the crust disintegrated into crumbs - so you definitely need to add butter1/4 to 1/3 stick. I also would make a topping of strawberries and rhubarb - and keep it rather tart to offset the sweetness and richness of the pie.

I liked this a lot, but also made a few changes: more fruit and less sugar to keep the tartness of the Rhubarb; and the crust needed a half stick of melted butter to hold it together. For garnish, it's worth reserving a little of the chilled fruit mixture to spoon over each slice.
