As with all pizza, and this recipe, the adage, "less is more" is especially pertinent. I found this to be delicious and elegant in its simplicity. I found the dough recipe dry and stiff as written. Next time I will use one cup of water rather the three-quarters of a cup and add more flower if needed. Other additions, though not necessary, include a little garlic in the olive oil and or some bacon or procuitto sprinkled on top.

Great recipe for dough!

I was shocked at how easy and delicious this was to make. I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked the crust sans toppings first for a minute or two. I will definitely make this again! I may brush some garlic on the crust next time for a little extra flavor.

This was a very easy to make and delicious recipe! I will definitely use the dough recipe for all pizzas I make. I used a little bit of mozzarella and romano cheese, with thin slices of plum tomatoes, and a sprinkling of dried basil. Yum.

This is fantastic. The only addition we made was to pre-cooked the crust for about 10 min. in the oven, then spread it with some evoo and roasted garlic before putting on the rest of the toppings. Also added some crushed red pepper for kick. We then finished it on the grill and topped with the basil. OUTSTANDING!

I did not change a thing and it was absolutely delicious! Well, I added crushed red pepper flakes to the pizzas after taking them out of the oven. I will tell you that you really need a pizza peel. The rimless cookie sheet with cornmeal did not work for me, so I placed the cookie sheet with pizza on top on the stone. I will buy a peel for next time. Also, I made the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer. Soo easy

The roasted cherry tomatoes made the pizza sweet and tart at the same time. Really tasty. My husband likes pineapple and ham so I added those to the second pizza. He loved it! The crust is crispy but slightly chewy. This recipe is a really great base if you prefer more toppings. Make sure your pizza stone is large enough to accommodate your rolled out dough. Otherwise, consider dividing the dough into thirds and making smaller pizzas. I didn't have semolina flour so I sprinkled the peel generously with cornmeal. Worked really well.
