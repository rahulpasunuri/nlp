My sons loved this dinner. They said we need to keep this recipe for summer grilling. The onions were excellent. We will make this again. I will try Greek yogurt next time instead of sour cream. Yummy recipe!

We found this salad rather ordinary -- neither bad nor good -- and will find another recipe for our next steak salad.

I make similar salads, but keep the dressings lighter. How would 1-2% fat Greek yogurt work for the dressing rather than sour cream?

This was great! We didn't include the radishes, grilled the beef (used skirt steak) but otherwise made it exactly as written. The pickled onions were a really nice addition.

Delicious! I grilled flank steak and cut it very thin which cuts down on the toughness of the meat. I loved this dish. Easy and good!
