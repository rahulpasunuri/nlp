The ollalieberries my co-creator, Stephanie White, and I used to create this ice cream came from a grower near Pescadero, CA. In season, one might find these berries in grocery stores on the Pacific coast from Santa Cruz, CA northward. The Epicurious dictionary describes an ollalieberry as follows: "Grown mainly on the West Coast, this cross between a YOUNGBERRY and a LOGANBERRY has a distinctive, sweet flavor and resembles a large, elongated BLACKBERRY. It's delicious both fresh and cooked and makes excellent jams and jellies." I would add that they are an excellent addition to cinnamon ice cream.

Olallieberries are a cross between a blackberry and red raspberry, leaning more towards the blackberry side. That said, I have no idea where to get them, fresh or frozen. Could probably sub blackberries and be fine.

Sounds interesting and I'd like to try it, but what the heck are olallieberries?
