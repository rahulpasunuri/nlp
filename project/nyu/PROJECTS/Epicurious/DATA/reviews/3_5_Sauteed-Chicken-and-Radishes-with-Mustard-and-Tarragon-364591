I needed this recipe! I never liked radishes but, found myself gifted with many beautiful locally farmed, seasonal radishes that it would be a crime not to enjoy........So, since I had all the other ingredients, I reluctantly made it. I now love radishes! Who knew you could cook them?! Yummy

Wow this was yummy! I also added mushrooms and baby bok choy to the radish mix.

The chicken and sauce were quite nice--the radishes were just odd...like an unfortunate cross between an onion and a potato.

Okay, so maybe I shouldn't review the recipe because I changed it, however, I substituted grapes for the radishes looking for a sweeter version. It was quite good!

Amazing! I made this dish for my mom who was hesitant after looking at the recipe (she is not a fan of radishes) and even she loved it. I did substitute onion and garlic for the shallot but followed everything else.

Enjoyed this dish. Great way to use fresh radishes. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent flavor combination! I enjoy the simple set of ingredients used in this dish. I had no idea how delicious radishes could be. I did a trial run for my sister and a friend last night... I'll be repeating this dish for my lady in a few nights. I overcooked the sauce a bit which reduced the volume and increased the thickness... But it was still very tasty. I threw a lid on the saucepan when cooking the radishes in order to heat them more thoroughly.

Pretty tasty! The sauce was a bit thin, but maybe that was user error. My husband dug it. I'll definitely make it again. I also finished the chicken in the oven so it would all be ready at the same time. I cut all my rashes to be about the same size so they cooked perfectly. I also omitted the oil and used less a bit less butter then it called for. I served it over sauteed bok choy & kale with garlic (only because it was what I had on hand)

My fussy husband and I both really liked this. I would modify it a bit for two people by using breast tenderloins or cutlets and not so many radishes, simply because it was a lot of food. I made the amount of sauce called for and it was just enough for two. I also think for two servings it's easier to finish the chicken in the skillet. The suggestion to serve it over sauteed spinach is a good one.

The flavors in this recipe really worked. I took the suggestions of previous reviewers; finished the chicken in the oven, served over sauteed swiss chard, doubled the sauce and used only butter, no oil, to cook the radishes. I had no tarragon so used fresh basil. The flavors and textures are wonderful and all work together. Good for family and for company. Will definitely make again. Served with Sweet Corn & Onion Salad (Sunset Magazine) and bottle of good white wine.

Very easy, surprisingly tasty. The only alteration I made to the recipe was to finish the chicken in the oven: I started the radishes, and once the chicken had rested, everything was done at the same time. More sauce would be good, and the spinach sounds like a good idea as I do feel like the dish needs more veggies or a veggie side.

We loved it. I almost burned the radishes but I saved them. Fairly easy and loaded with flavor. I doubled the sauce for just two breasts. Believe me, you will want more sauce. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and sauteed spinach and placed under the chicken. Great addition to the flavor profile. Cannot wait to make again and share with others.

This was an easy, delicious and healthy dinner. The radishes were yummy. I didn't change the recipe at all. I made some orzo to soak up the sauce.

I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious radishes are. All of the flavors in this dish compliment each other well, and it's very light on the palate making it a perfect spring recipe. I baked the chicken instead to save time, which I believe will work better for this dish compared to pan frying.

This recipe is easy and delicious. My only recommendation would be to double the sauce recipe. The chicken breasts I used were rather large, so there wasn't enough sauce to properly lubricate all the chicken.

I used 4 large chicken thighs instead of the breasts and doubled the sauce. I served it over lightly sautéed spinach. Very flavourful dish. The radishes bite was significantly reduced by the pan roasting. Though the sauce wasn't very mustardy by my standards (it was just the right level) some people who aren't big mustard fans may not like it. Be sure to use a Dijon mustard that you like. Some are sharper than others, IMHO. Husband declared this a keeper.

I made the recipe as directed, and the sauce turned out quite bitter...not sure why? After I served the radishes, I realized that the smaller ones were perfectly cooked, but the big ones weren't done. Bleh.

This recipe was super easy and delicious. We only used one pan - cooked the chicken (used boneless thin-sliced cutlets), made the sauce, and then did the radishes. Everything was perfect! Not stirring the radishes for the first shot of cooking is key.

This recipe was so easy but extremely tasty and gourmet for the little effort. I used 2 chicken breasts and put them in a 350 degree oven to finish off/keep warm after browning while I made everything else. The sauce was just enough for 2 - would have to double recipe for more. The tarragon and dijon taste really made the dish. Served with dark green vegetable side and sourdough bread.

Well I had to improvise because there were no radishes to be found and no tarragon at the one store I stopped at. So I used cut small potatoes, I don't use wine so I used water and the meal turned out delicious! The mustard carried the flavor for me in the sauce and I will definitely cook this again. Quick, easy for a novice and not so confident cook.

We love radishes in our house, and were intrigued by this recipe. If I could give 3.5 forks I would. The best thing about it is the sauce, without question. The flavor combination is fantastic. The radishes provide a nice crunchy kick. A few comments tho: - Radishes don't need nearly that much oil/butter - ours were a bit too coated, and lost a bit of their tang. - Try to use all similarly sized radishes - we had some largish and some quite small and (duh) the smaller ones could have done with 2-3 minutes less time on the stove - Double the sauce recipe. No kidding. We served this with basil couscous and fresh bread. Any remaining sauce will be miraculous when sopped up with the bread!
