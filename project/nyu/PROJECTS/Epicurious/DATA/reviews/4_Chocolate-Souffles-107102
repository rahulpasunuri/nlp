V-E-R-Y chocolaty good! Dusted the sides of the souffle dish with sugar and then cocoa--lovely crispy choc crunch. Made roughly a quarter of the recipe for 2 people without any probs (I think the recipe is forgiving) and was the perfect amt. It's a keeper!

I've never made a souffle before so I don't have other recipes to compare to, but, this recipe was so delicious and easy that I don't feel the need to look further. I used all semisweet chocolate and may use half this and half bittersweet next time to make it a little darker. I made these for a small dinner party and it came together quickly and the ramekins were scraped clean! Very rich but the flavor is excellent.

When I've made other, non-chocolate souffles they rise above the ramekins. These did not. Did I not cook them long enough? The truth is, it didn't really matter as everyone was practically licking their dishes clean, but I'd like to try again.

Very yummy, and very easy!!! (maybe it's my oven) but 20 mins. was'nt enough, next time will add another 5 min.'s. I used semi-sweet choc. and used 4 tablespoons of sugar, and it was a tad too sweet, and I love sweet! will definetly make again with 2-3 tblsps sugar.

This recipe was a big hit! Not difficult to make. It may have just been my oven, but I recommend considering 2-3 extra minutes in the oven. Also, run your finger or thumb around top of the souffle on the inside of the ramekin after spooning in the mixture (it helps it rise). Served with powdered sugar and vanilla ice cream. Very rich, so it was nice to have something with it. Would makes this again as the recipe as is, and I think it would take well to experiments with flavors and all kinds of sauces, too.

I loved this recipe! Great rich chocolate flavor. I should have baked it a little longer, but was still really tasty. Will definitely make this again. I didn't have rum, so I used a little more vanilla extract and some almond extract. Great, easy and quick.

Definitely needed more than 15 minutes - but as I was doing this NYE, hard to know if the problem was user-related (this was after the bubbly had been poured!)

Excellent, very light. Didn't have trouble with the souffle falling. I have never made souffle before and it was a lot easier than I expected.

This souffle is a hit with adults and children! It's very rich and goes best with a light dinner, or for breakfast :). I served it in tandem with a panna cotta recipe I got off of this site for Thanksgiving and the panna cotta was preferred after the heavy meal. Usually, this recipe wins every time. It's even great tasting reheated in the microwave days later!

Love love love this recipe. I dropped a chunk of choco in the middle to get the molten effect and served it right with the ramekin on a plate with french vanilla ice cream. It's devine.

classic chocolate souffle. I used 12 half cup ramekins for the full 15 minutes bake time (convection bake), and they were awesome!

Solid - did this for a party of 20 - tripled the recipe - but really did not need to. A doubling gets you 20 -25 ramekins easy. Tried the Expresso chocolate from Ghiradelli - added an extra nice richness with the rum.

These were excellent! I halved the recipie for two people, excluded rum, and accented the souffles with a raspberry/strawberry puree and dark chocolate ice cream......"It's like an orgy in my mouth!" - my girlfriend

STOP! If you are looking for a delicious and easy souffle recipe, this is it. I did make a few changes. I replaced the rum with Grand Marnier and the morning of my dinner party I heated the cream, sugar, butter, salt and flavoring. I softened the chocolate in the microwave on 50% power for about 2 minutes and then poured the hot cream over it making a smooth ganache. I separated the eggs and put everything in the refrigerator. After dinner, I simply beat the egg whites, heated the ganache over simering water until bearly warm, added the egg yolks and folded in the whites. Instead of using the small ramekins, I baked the souffle in a 48 oz. souffle dish. It did take about double the amount of time to cook, but it was much easier. I served with a Grand Marnier sauce, whipped cream and fresh strawberries. I got rave reviews!!! You can't go wrong.

These were *wonderful*. Full, rich chocolate flavor, and a melt-in-your-mouth light as air texture. (Plus, easy!) I halved the recipe and used slightly larger ramekins to make 2 medium-sized souffles instead of 8 little ones (a perfect Valentine's Day treat for 2 -- a little too large for dessert portions, but hey, it's a holiday) and substituted cherry brandy for the rum. Just delicious.

This is a great mojo recipe. Gentlemen chefs who want to share their love of good food with a date cannot go wrong with this one. I won't fully divulge my secret ingredient, except to recommend taking license with the rum...

This was absolutely fabulous. Very chocolate-y and not too sweet. I used a combination of semi-sweet and bitter-sweet chocolates (Scharfenberger) and the results were outstanding following the recipe to the letter. I made the chocolate base in advance and added the egg yolks just before beating the whites. It was easy and my guests and myself LOVED it. I did have to cook them about 5 minutes longer than the recipe indicates and raised the temp to 375...they then puffed up beautifully and with powerdered sugar sprinkled on top were lovely. I served souffle cups on plates that had a mix of blackberries, raspberries and strawberries. Will definitely make again and again. Thank you for a great recipe.

Wonderful! I tried this recipie as my first attempt at souffle because of the ratings. Well, the reviews were right! Husband declared it was as good as what he had recently ordered at the most expensive French restaurant in our area. Didn't add rum but it was fine.

This is a great recipe. I used semi-sweet chocolate, and it came out perfectly for both the children and adults who consumed it. I served it with lightly sweetened whipped cream and garnished with some chocolate shavings on the cream and powdered sugar on the souffle. Excellent. If you use a different size set of ramekins, be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly so that it cooks through properly. If using the size named in the recipe, fifteen minutes worked perfectly for me.

This was outstanding. Made it for two for Valentine's dinner and then again for a dinner party two weeks later. A HUGE hit.

Easy and elegant. One tip, ovens vary so the cooking time may vary as well. Mine needed longer, were a little too runny in the center, but delicious overall. Try checking with a sharp knife.
