This was easy to prepare and, in part due to the use of farm fresh eggs, was a beautiful yellow. Cooling it upside down is critical to getting the tall end product. The flavor is a kiss of lemon and is a perfect ending to a heavy meal. To enhance the lemon, add a lemon glaze before serving. This is a great alternative to those of us who do not care for boring angel food cakes.

I made this recipe for two different Thanksgiving gatherings as it was written because it was the first time I ever made it. It makes a light, soft cake that is fairly lemony and sweet. (I liken it to a glass of lemonade in cake form.) I got mixed reviews. Those at one gathering loved it. They asked me to make it again for another party coming up. Those at the other gathering said it was too sweet and dry and not at all what they expected when I said I was making a lemon chiffon cake (not spongy enough?). Personally, I did think it just a little too sweet, but not much. I would definitely make it again, but not for a crowd of Chinese who do not generally like sweet desserts anyway.

This cake makes a wonderful ending to any heavy meal, for any season. Since I found it I made it four times. It goes well with fresh fruit sauce and berries. I used frozen raspberries for the sauce and served them alongside at Easter, and fresh blueberries with vanilla ice cream in summer. Even my son who is very picky about his desserts, loves this cake.

I really like this recipe, it was simple and not very time consuming. The only problem I had with it was that the flavor wasn't very strong. I added a lemon glaze to it which helped, but the cake itself didn't taste very different from an angel food cake. However, it was very well received in my house

I was looking for a special springtime cake to use in my new book and thought lemon chiffon would be perfect. Then I told my best friend and she said orange chiffon would be even better. So I read all the reviews which were extremely helpful and, based on those, made the following modifications: 1/2 cup + 2 TBS. orange juice instead of the juice and water mix. Four TBS of orange zest. Everything else I did exactly as directed and baked it for 1 hour, 5 min. We are at high altitude and a couple of years ago I decided to disregard all the special high altitude baking directions and just follow the directions and have not had any problems. In fact, things have started turning out the way they're supposed to. I wanted this cake to be very orangey, so made a glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice and Grand Marnier. WOW! It was fabulous. I can't wait to make it again.

If you follow the recipe, this cake will come out beautifully. I'm a baking novice, and I understand that chiffon cakes are a bit more challenging than the usual mix-it-up-and- pour-it-in-the-pan. Nonetheless, my first attempt came out wonderfully, and very delicious. There was plenty of lemon flavor -- I used a zester to get the best part of the peel. The cake baked up high and fluffy, too. Some cracking on the top, which I understand is undesirable, but not too much. I shared this with co-workers, and everyone loved it. My other half, who's on a diet, is the only one who wasn't happy, but that's because it was so tasty. Will be making this cake again and again!

I thought it turned out very nicely, though I forgot the cream of tartar. I also had just one lemon peel to use, so instead of the water I used use all lemon juice. Also, I used two round cake pans with parchment paper in the bottom and baked for 25 minutes.

Folks, I think that the problem comes from the definition of "10-cup tube pan." The author means an angel-food cake pan, not a Bundt pan. If you use an angel-food pan, the cooled cake should be easy to remove--run a long metal spatula or knife around the edge of the pan, then pull the cake from the bottom tube unit. DO NOT grease the pan because the batter needs a tactile surface to climb up for rising. Watch out for nonstick angel-food cake tube pans--they won't work for this recipe. That being said, I think the cake could use a little more lemon flavor, so I'd add the grated zest of 1 lemon. Note that this recipe is almost twenty years old, and I think our collective palate likes stronger flavors these days.

I had the same problem others mentioned where the cake stuck to the pan. I did get it out, but not before going around with the knife, pushing the cake away from the edge with the knife, and then a lot of banging and crumbs all over the floor! Is there a reason why you shouldn't grease the pans? Another reviewer said she would use a spray next time and hoped it wouldn't prevent the cake from rising, I believe. Is greasing a problem with chiffon cakes?

CAUTION! This cake was beautiful when I took it from the oven. I put the pan upside down over a bottle, as directed, and left it to cool. I returned to the kitchen to find that the top half of it had fallen from the pan and broken into about 8 pieces. The bottom part as still in the pan and broke into about four more pieces when I tried to remove it. The cake tasted great, but it was meant to be a birthday cake, and no amount of frosting was going to paste it back together and make it presentable. If I ever make it again, I will cool it in the pan right-side-up.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday - she is allergic to dairy and loves lemon, so the lemon chiffon was a great choice. I will definitely make this cake again, but I'd like to try increasing the lemon flavor by substituting lemon juice for the 1/4 cup water as suggested by a previous review. I served the cake with a lemon glaze, which was a nice added touch. One final note - my cake was done after just 50 min., so be sure to check for doneness earlier than the 1 1/4 hour in the recipe!

Sorry to dissent here, but first of all it was not lemony enough for what I was hoping for. Also it did stick a little on the bottom. I topped with a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze and that helped the flavour a lot. It was just so-so in my opinon; We served it with a lemon/mascarpone/whipped cream blend that helped too. My parents were given half of the cake leftover and my dutiful husband finished the balance. One piece was enough for me. And I do bake a lot, so I know I can find better recipes out there.

one additional note - like a previous reviewer, there was minor issues with cake sticking to the sides of the tube pan. no trouble removing it from the main part of the pan or taking the ring off the tube, but the pan did retain a bit of that smooth layer of the outside. personal preference i guess, but i like to have the outside that is showing looking smooth and even, especially if you aren't going to do a solid frosting. i believe the recipe called for a non-greased pan. next time i will do a very LIGHT coating of non-stick spray (i use the wilton cake non-stick spray which i love). hopefully it will not inhibit the batter's rising!

umm...fabulous! followed the ingredients exactly as the recipe called for. the only minor alteration was the baking time. on the advice of other reviewers i checked it at one hour and it was done! and the cake certainly does rise quite a bit, as it should, so this is not a cake to try with a short-sided pan. the texture was so nice and spongy, yet sturdy. the lemon was perfect - smooth and not overpowering. used a 10" tube pan, drizzled a powdered sugar frosting mixture down the sides, added some heavy whipped cream dollops on top via pastry bag and tip and garnished with thinly sliced lemons between the dollops. i am in charge of bringing the birthday cake to the office when we celebrate and this one was very well-liked. i was so pleased with it and so pleased with what other people thought of it, i am making it agian this weekend for a friend's birthday. cheers!

A huge hit at my husband's birthday party. Light, fluffy, moist and not too sweet. Not nearly as time-consuming as I feared it would be. Will definitely make it again,.

Light, lemony, just as everyone said. The only reason I didn't give it a four-fork rating was because it came out a bit dry, and I even took it out of the oven about 15 minutes early! I bake frequently, with relative success, so I don't think my oven's off. I'll try again with a slightly lower temp or check it sooner. Other than that, it's terrific! Great with a thin glaze of confectioner's sugar and lemon juice. We also had it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream (go easy on the sugar in the cream -- the cake, especially with an icing, is plenty sweet). I'll definitely be doing this one again.

This cake is light and very lemony. Served it for Easter dinner, and the guests really liked it. My only issue with it was that it stuck (and I mean STUCK) to the pan, and I was too embarrassed to display it. So I sliced and served and no one was the wiser! I also served with fresh homemade whipped cream, which was a nice complement.

I love anything lemony. I made this cake and after it cooled, divided it into three layers and spread a thin layer of lemon curd and fresh sliced strawberries between each layer and then frosted the cake with whipping cream folded in with the leftover lemon curd and it was the prettiest thing in the world. And it tasted even better. Great for a shower or anniversary party

This cake is delicious! If you love lemon, you have to make this easy to bake cake. Made it for Easter and it was a great,just-right, light dessert after our meal. I topped it with some strawberries and the taste just blended together wonderfully. To the person who made it as a sheet cake--do yourself a favor and follow the directions, you won't be disappointed. I usually tinker with recipes but followed this one exactly. You should never back a chiffon cake in anything but a tube pan. This is what makes the cake a chiffon cake--light, spongy and delicious! veryone I have shared this with wants the recipe. A+!

This angel food style lemon cake was both a hit at home and the office. It was great as written and later I made another and cut it horizontally and spread with lemon curd before making up a lemon juice and confectioner's sugar glaze to pour over the top. To the cook from Leesburg, VA, the two modifications made to the recipe are most likely the reason it did not turn out well. Cake flour is relatively low in protein and chlorinated (making it slightly acidic), meaning it will yield a more tender cake than all purpose flour and may react differently with other ingredients. Additionally, the use of a sheet pan may inhibit the rising of the cake as a tube pan provides a high side to 'climb' up and a means of keeping it inverted while cooling, both help prevent it collapsing upon itself.

I have made this cake so many times that as much as I like to tamper with recipes, this is one recipe you have to follow precisely and you will get great results. When I want a real pronounced lemon flavor, I will replace the water with fresh lemon juice. You have to be patient with letting it cool before you try and remove it from the pan and even then it can be tricky, but it is by far the best lemon cake that I make!

I won't rate this recipe as I made two changes, but I will say this: I wouldn't make it again! I used regular flour instead of cake flour, and baked it in a sheet cake instead of a tube pan. It looked beautiful, but had the consistency of a dry unsweet corn muffin, and it stuck to the pan! I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but in the future I'll try an easier recipe for lemon cake.

I LOVE Lemon! Especially FRESH LEMON! Will try this. I wonder how Cream of Tartar would do in it instead of baking powder. I don't have a lot of luck with BP. I had a delightful cake with Corn Oil in it and LOST the recipe.

This is one of my favorite cakes to make for myself! You must love lemon flavor if you are to enjoy this cake (which I do). It is also very light tasting and when I want to dress it up, I add a Grand Marnier glaze. Just delicious!
