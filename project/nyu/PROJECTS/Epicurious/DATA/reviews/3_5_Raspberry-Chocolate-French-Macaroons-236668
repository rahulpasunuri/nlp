The video that bopples referred to: http:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS4DJgFmNFM is a MUST! I followed the notes on the site and mine came out great... my first try! [ I used their recipe, all macaroon recipes are almost the same, only the fillings changed...] used the filling from this recipe though and was yummy. any macaroon recipe, substitue 3 tab. of cocoa powder for 1/2 cup of flour

I was nervous after reading all these reviews, but they turned out great! I reduced the salt based on other reviews, and added almond extract to the ganache as well as the raspberry extract (because I love almond). Reduce the baking time - I baked the cookies for 8 minutes each, but some of them were slightly browned on top, which changed the color. Bake for more like 6 or 7 minutes each time. Also the consistency of my cookies was pretty grainy with almond skin, having used sliced almonds. Next time I'll try using slivered almonds instead so there's no skin grain-iness. Really delicious and not as difficult as I thought it'd be! I'm excited to try other flavors/colors now. Made 36 small to medium cookies.

I consider myself a relatively advanced home cook, and these turned out to be an absolute disaster. I've made meringues before and I'm aware of the pitfalls of over-mixing, but that wasn't the problem here. Something is off in this recipe; either the measurements or the technique. It could be that the act of transferring the meringue to the plastic bag for piping overcombined the mixture and made it "fall." The pan was one slick and sloppy mess of batter when I tried to pipe them on the sheet. Everything started to run and I had to throw it all away. I think this recipe needs to be brought back into the test kitchen and fine tuned. Don't waste your time on it as-is.

I feel like the people who gave these bad reviews probably didn't make them properly. Macaroons are sort of tricky because you have to do everything just right so that they look right and have the right texture. If you've never made macaroons like this before, I recommend watching this: http:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS4DJgFmNFM because it shows you how to make them very well. For the filling, I added vanilla extract into about half a bag of semisweet chocolate chips and about 1/4 cup of half and half for the filling, simply melting everything in the microwave because that's easier and faster. If I make them again, I might try using a white chocolate filling instead.

These were good, but you couldn't just follow this recipe and have perfect macarons. I found a troubleshooting guide to macarons on www.foodnouveau.com and will study it further before making them again. (It talks about aging eggs, drying almond meal, and other great information.) As opposed to others' reviews, I didn't think they were too salty. I also used a larger tip - a #7, which seemed to give me a perfect two-bite size. Lastly, I didn't find raspberry extract so I used orange. The orange and chocolate is delicious! (And I colored them orange to match.)

So I tried to do everything right. I bought powdered almonds because my Mom's food processor can hold about one onion chopped and I would have been there all night grinding almonds. Then, when I discovered that my Mom had lent the kitchen scale to my sister, I used math to figure out the right amount of almonds to put in the recipe. I sifted them to make sure that there were no lumps. Then I sifted the icing sugar and combined the two of them. So far so good. I even went as far as to clean the bowl and the beaters with some white vinegar (old chef's trick) before putting the carefully separated egg whites in it. I added only a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar. Next, I beat them to the soft peak stage. So far so good. Maybe I'm just too tired from all these holiday preparations - I don't know - but I added the icing sugar and almond mixture to the egg whites next..... @#$%^&*! Of course, there was no stiff peaks to be had. They completly deflated. To make matters worse, I added the raspberries - carefully strained raspberries - and it turned into pink soup. So I went so far as to try to pour them onto the cookie sheet and bake them at 275 for 20 minutes. They were gimpy-looking pink twoonies instead of fluffy pink pillows. Maybe I'll dip them in the ganache, but I'm not serving these things on Christmas as planned. I guess we're not having Christmas cookies this year.... (My Mom's weight watchers cookies don't count) Well, I think that this recipe is going into the dumpster. You can't succeed at everything...

Delicious and fun to eat! I have a suggestion... My supermarket didn't have any raspberry extract so I bought fresh raspberries and ended up adding about 10 raspberries to the 1/3 cup cream and simmering it and letting it steep for 30min. Then I strained out the fruit and was left with a very flavorful pink cream to mix with the chocolate. I then added about 4 smashed raspberries to the final ganache just for some fresh texture. I can't comment on the taste with the extract, but it is delicious and bright with the fresh fruit, and not much more complicated. I highly recommend it. Also, next time I will try adding cream of tartar to the macaroons to give them more body.

I made exactly as written and they turned out perfectly. I was worried when I went to lick the beater after finishing the meringue, because it was super salty, but it was perfectly balanced with all the almond-sugar and chocolate filling. I made a mix of tiny kiss-sized cookies and double kiss-sized. The kiss-sized ones make perfect single-bite sized cookies. If you want traditional two-bite sized, then make larger kisses.

I realize that there are some things that need to be tweaked in this recipe, but they are simple, and if you do them, it really is actually a great recipe. Put a couple pinches of salt in, not 3/4 tsp. Pipe out the batter twice as big as it says to. Bake for a bout 7-8 minutes on each rack. I made these small adjustments and they turned out perfect, i made three batches! Also, its not essential, but I found a few other things helpful, especially if you are into presentation: If you tap the cookie sheets after you pipe out the batter, it helps get rid of any bubbles in the meringue. I let them sit for an hour before putting them in the oven, it mades the tops perfect! If you want to get really nit-picky, I would get a frosting bag liner to use for piping, rather than a ziplock, or else they come out a little oval shaped. If you pipe the ganache onto the rounds, rather than spread, you get this beautiful uniform filling that gives them that "store-bought" look!

This recipe did not turn out well at all, nor like the picture, despite following the instructions very carefully. They did not rise up, the size was completely off, and the cooking time was too long, as many other people have said. This was really a big disappointment.

Rating: 1
The recipe is off. The cookies need to be made about DOUBLE the size of a chocolate kiss (if not even a tad larger) and the cook time should be dropped. My cookies came out as small crispy pucks - not at all like a French-style Macaroon. If I had made them larger and baked less, it probably would've worked.

I am so disappointed with this recipe. There is entirely too much salt in the macarons and they are very sweet (even after reducing the powdered sugar by 1/3 - based off french recipes). These honestly taste nothing like the macarons that I have had in France. Save yourself the time and find another recipe.

Rating: 0
Sadly disappointed. Recipe calls for way too much salt. Instructions to pipe out "chocolate kiss size" is way too small. After a couple of attempts to follow step by step instructions and still failed, I concluded this recipe is inaccurate. Reducing the salt and piping proper macaron size patties, this recipe was pretty decent. However, there are better recipes out there than this one so I'm not sure why it deserves 3 1/2 forks. This part is puzzling for those searching for a recipe on Epicurious and depend on accurate ratings, especially for the insecure home baker who's hopes of baking perfect little Parisian Macarons will be shattered after they feel they've failed just because they've simply followed this recipe. And because of their search on Epicurious that rated this particular recipe so highly, and reviews were said that it was "easy" and a "keeper".... well there's their confidence straight down the drain. Or into the garbage along with their tiny, and don't forget salty, pink pellets a.k.a. "macaroons".

I never made macaroons before but I applied the advice of others; used more raspberry flavoring and food color, less salt, sifted my almond powder and confectioners sugar. I over baked my first tray because they didn't appear done and they were too crunchy. So what appeared to look undercooked to me, was moist, chewy, perfectly cooked macaroons. Next time I am going to double the recipe. They are just too good to only make one batch!

Does anyone know how long UNFILLED cookies will last? Do they get stale if kept airtight for, say, 1 week? Also, I often make Rose Levy Beranbaum's (Cake Bible)raspberry puree and am thinking that might be a better addition to the ganache since it has a very intense raspberry flavor. Will give this a try soon. Thanks for any input.

Don't do it if you have no food processor. Lol :D I gave it a try; thought it was a good idea. After two days of trying to kill almonds with a kitchen chopper, I decided that a food processor would be a good investment. Alas, when you're 18, a food processor isn't top priority on your "need" list, but I shall make these cute little pillows once I receive my long awaited friend.

These were so yummy! I couldn't find raspberry extract anywhere so I just used Chambord in the ganache. The one thing I would do differently is to increase the amount of food coloring that I used -- once I folded in the almond/sugar mixture, the pink color was almost completely lost and the macaroons came out looking like little hamburgers...really delicious little hamburgers!!

This was my first time making macarons and they were surprisingly easy and fun. Didn't have any raspberry extract, so I used peppermint, which I think worked well with the chocolate and almonds.

These should get 20 stars. I have never liked macaroons growing up but this sure changes everything! The cookies are a sweet, almond taste - which can be fragile - with a yummy raspberry flavored chocolate ganache! Mmmmmm.

Normally, I have no trouble at all with meringues of any kind, but I have tried this recipe three times - carefully weighing ingredients the third time and have not had good luck. They taste fine, but they do not look at all like the photo and they are not so incredible that I am happy to keep trying to perfect them.

LOVED it, this was so simple, when I was looking for a recipe for Luxembergerli, definitely didn't spell that correctly, but maybe I did. Anyway, Colorado is the easiest place to bake, I think humidity has a lot to do with the outcome of these macarons, pressing the tips down ( of the unbaked cookies) with a wet finger makes them look better, I absolutely agreed with more flavoring and/or extract, as there was no difference in the taste of the ganache as apposed to the very expensive chocolate I bought to make it with. super fine almonds, great , flavored ganache, and attention to detail, def make these macarons a worth- it- try and an amazing cookie for anyone who has tried Luxembergerli

I read all of the reviews and decided to see what the great Julia Child says about macaroons. I followed her lead and I had none of the problems mentioned by the others. As she instructs, I rubbed the bowl with 1 Tb of vinegar and 1 tsp of salt. I then omitted the salt in the whites. I added just shy of a 1/4 tsp creme of tartar when the whites were just beginning to foam. I also added all of the confectioners sugar to the pulsing of the almonds. I forgot to buy food coloring so I didn't have that added liquid as one reader mentioned. My whites never deflated. They are beautiful and delicious. Gluten Free as well! Makes 50 (quarter size) cookies.

Made these last night and they turned out pretty good. I only did one batch, but it was a good learning experience. First, I wisked the almond puree and sifted the powdered sugar into the almond puree as I was wisking. This cut down on the lumps. Second, I added liquid food coloring, which made them a little wet. Next time, I'm going to use gel food color to see if that helps. Third, I was having trouble with the bottoms sticking to the parchment paper, so I let the last batch cool on the cookie sheet instead of a rack, and they released perfectly! Last, Do not let the mixture sit. Pipe it all at once even if you have to let some trays rest longer than others. If not, I noticed that the dough cracked some when it was first put in the oven. Also, I made double the ganache and added more of the raspberry extract until I could distinctly taste it. It tastes AMAZING with the sweet and saltiness of the macarons! In love!

My macarons did not turn out well the first time. But, after reading some blog entries, the second batch turned out really well! Some tips: The almond measurements are a little confusing. If you're using sliced blanched almonds, use 6 oz. If you're using whole blanched almonds, use 2 cups. I'd advise using the sliced almonds. After grinding the almonds, sift the powder with the sugar. This helps keep them from clumping. Don't over-mix the meringues and almond mixture. If you're putting the mix into a baggie or pastry bag, they will mix and deflate even more during that step (and using the bag makes them easier to shape).

The cookies came out gorgeous despite the fact that I made them way too large.I take issue with the raspberry flavor as the extract did nothing for the ganache.I would love to try it with raspberry jam but does it stay piecey or does it melt with the choc? Also wanna know if anyone tried it with just raspberry jam without ganache?!!

Tasted great, but would take a couple tries to perfect. I used slivered almonds which seemed to work fine- thanks to my food processor. I took a reviewer's recommendation and also used raspberry jam. The cookies turned out flatter than what the picture shows but once I put them together in a sandwich, they looked better. I think I needed to whisk the ingredients longer.

Tasted good, but I had a few user errors. My cookies were crispy shells. There wasn't much inside except for an air pocket- is that normal? I also used raspberry jam instead of extract and omitted the heavy cream. That was delicious!! I toasted the almonds first, which tasted great, but made for a funny looking cookie. It was a pink cookie with brown spots...not as cute as the photo.

Help - just pulled out the ingredients to make this, but the almond amount is confusing. The recipe reads "6 oz. sliced blanched almonds (not slivered; 2 cups). 6 oz. doesn't equal 2 cups; it's less than one cup. Does this mean that if I use whole almonds, I use 2 cup, if already sliced, only measure 6 oz.? Please advise!

Was very pleased with the end result. I doubled the mixture and it took me several tries to get the right baking time and temp right to have these come out perfect. Used the makeshift pastry bag and tip is to cut the smallest hole so that you can regulate the size of the dough to a hershey's kiss size. I wound up turning heat to 275 for 20 minutes and they turned out perfect. Rave reviews from everyone. Worth the effort!

Dear afrodite131: I would recommend using parchment paper rather than wax paper. Parchment paper is slippery (not waxy), so cookies don't stick. A Silpat mat also works well. If you cannot find parchment paper locally, try an online website - it shouldn't be very expensive. It's a fabulous addition to your basic kitchen "utensils" if you like to bake! Try the recipe again, this time with parchment paper, and I think you'll have better success. Good luck!

Thank you Megs91581 - at least someone knows the real name for these tasty tidbits, even if Gourmet does not. I love macarons so much that I frequently have them delivered cold-packed from my favorite patisserie in NY despite the hefty shipping costs. Can't wait to try my hand at these, but considering my perpetual bad luck with meringue, I'm hopeful at best. Will report back with the results!

I've made these a few times now and they've been a huge hit every time with both kids and adults. They are a lot of work, but I think they're worth it. I usually make them without the food coloring and with the sliced almonds I always have in my freezer. They're prettier with the skinned slivered almonds, but work just fine with the sliced. Also good without any flavoring in the filling and I think they're even better the next day.

Not my favorite cookie in the world, but still SUPER yummmy. The market I went to did not have rasberry extract, so instead I just added about 5 teaspoons of rasberry jam and the filling turned out DELISIOUS! The rest of the cook probably would of tasted bad without that filling, because the outside was not very sweet and was just kind of weird tasting. Also with the food coloring, I added just enough to make the perfect pink, but when I baked them the pink on the outside kind of faded, so I would suggest adding a more vibrant color to the outside. Oh and also I would like double or triple the recipe if you are baking for a party, because even though at first it looks like a lot, really it is half of what it is.

This is a fabulous recipe. Even though I messed it up a bit by making the cookies too big, they still turned out fantastic. I would give it FOUR FORKS but I just made a few wee alterations... I added about 1/4 tsp of salt instead of 3/4 tsp (and I LOVE salt) and it worked fine. Also, I found the chocolate raspberry ganache to be lacking in raspberry flavor. I used THREE sources of raspberry flavor to get the right amount of raspberry flavor (a little extract, some framboise and some raspberry jam). Also, I ended up using slivered almonds that still had the skin on them and I actually liked it that way, even with the speckled brown top. I brought these to work and people went bonkers. So pretty!

These were adorable, and tasted as good as any french macaroon, but I didn't think they tasted like raspberry very much. I ended up putting more like 3/16 tsp of extract in and I still felt the flavor was paltry. I'll make them again but perhaps with some raspberry jelly in the filling as another reviewer suggested.

I was so happy to stumble upon this recipe since I've always wanted to take a shot at making these but thought it'd be too difficult. Me and all my co-workers have all had the famous French Macarons from Laduree in Paris, so I decided to make these to see how they would compare. I was very pleasantly surprised with the results! I took many suggestions from other reviewers and: used far less salt (about 1/4 tsp), added some vanilla to the meringue, and added a lot more raspberry extract to the ganache. I also added some Framboise liqueur. The almonds in the recipe were a bit confusing....I ended up using raw sliced almonds from Trader Joe's (still had a tiny bit of skin on them) and they worked out just fine. I used 2 drops of red food coloring but next time might add 1 or 2 more drops. Overall, I was very very happy with these but they may have been a tad too chewy ( the real French Macarons are little more crispy). a Big hit in my office for sure!

What a flop! The cookies, although beaten until fluffy in the kitchenaid, flattened like crackers immediatly. The filling came out fine, but I think it needed more raspberry extract than what the recipe called for. I doubt I'll try to make this one again, it looked nothing like the photo and didnt taste all that great either.

I have made these a few times and loved them each time. I made them without the raspberry flavor (one time with the red food color, and one time without - I prefer it with the color). I made them once with slivered almonds as directed, and once using pre-packaged ground whole almonds; the whole almonds tasted fine but gave the cookies a speckled appearance because of the dark "skin" from the whole almonds. I prefer them with slivered almonds as directed. The chocolate ganache is the crowning glory. One time I made them, my ganache did not set completely (must have used too much cream), so I drizzled the cookies with the chocolate instead of making sandwiches. Still delicious!

Rating: 3
too much salt! I would use maybe half the salt and add almond extract next time as the almond flavor was not as apparent as I had hoped. I discovered that if you cook them a little too long they lose their pink color, so don't overbake. An easy recipe though and a beatiful presentation.

Although the meringue was whipped until stiff and glossy, it deflated so much with the mix of the dry ingredients that the result was very gooey and gummy. The resulting cookies were very chewy--almost unpleasantly so. The flavor was good, though, and it will be worth making them again to try and perfect the consistency.

Rating: 3
n.b.: I only used 1/2 tsp. salt and also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla per other reviewers suggestions. The cookies came out pretty tasty, although there was a BIG difference between those baked on non-stick baking sheets and those baked on air- cushion baking sheets (I used parchment on both). The air-cushion cookies were much better; the others were too crusty on the bottom. I also could not find blanched sliced almonds, so the cookies did not have a perfectly smooth appearance (although I processed the almonds to a powder). Maybe a sifter would solve this problem? These were fun to make -- I'll try again.

living close to the french border, i would drive across just for macaroons. i really love them. when i found this recipe i had to try, but i never would have thought that they would turn out this great! they actually look perfect and taste at least as good as the ones i buy in france. and the best part: it didn´t take long. i only added a pinch of salt and used already ground almonds. i´m deffinetly making these again.

there is way too much salt in this recipe. i added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and kept everything else the same, but would probably cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. also would not switch the pans halfway thru baking as the cookies can deflate if jostled too much. overall, the recipe was only ok.

i thought these turned out pretty well. i think i prefer a slightly sweeter cookie as per other recipes. i made them a little bigger so only got enough for 10 sandwiches. i cut the salt a little. i'd probably add vanilla as indicated in another review. altho i think i added some extra raspberry extract, i didn't get a big raspberry flavor. as i learned afterwards, from at least one site, 1/16 tsp = a pinch. i used several smidges (i actually have these measuring spoons). probably should have used more. thinking about it, i would probably add a little to the cookie instead of adding vanilla. i think it gets lost in the chocolate.

when it talks about grinding the almonds to a fine consistency, think of a powdery texture. mine ended up being too coarse, and subsequently the macaroons cracked. i also live at a higher altitude (5k feet) which may have caused the cracking. while they weren't as pretty as the picture, they tasted divine.

I made these macrons because they were beautiful, even though I'd never had one before. They were delicious and very popular in our holiday treat bags. They were very tasty. The recipe was easy to follow. We are making these a holiday cookie tradition. One issue was the color - we didn't add enough food coloring even though the batter was pepto-bismol pink. you can see photos of batter/final at http://www.flickr.com/photos/blisspriss/sets/72157594459424975/

These cookies were a big hit at the New Year's party I brought them to. Unfortunately, it took two attempts at the recipe to get anything presentable - the seeming simplicity of the recipe is deceptive. My first attempt produced a relatively thin batter, and flat cookies. I remedied this by beating the meringue within an inch of its life the second time, and then giving it a quick re-beating after adding the food coloring. I also thought I had overcooked the meringues, as they were on the crispier side when they came out of the oven, but by the time I got the filled cookies to the party, they had softened to the correct texture. Anyone else have that happen?

yum, they tasted delicious. i had some difficulty in piping the macaroons because i tried to make them larger. i also added a drop too much red food coloring which rendered them looking a bit pepto bismol-ish. i told my daughter they were "tubby custards" from the teletubbies. i would like to make again but recipe requires much dilligence. my macaroons had great feet so i was very pleased since it was my first try! i've always admired the beauty of the classic french macaroon and never had the nerve to try. end result: yes, they do taste as good as they look and yes, they are as hard to make beautifully as you think they'd be

Don't believe the 2-1/2 dozen yield on these cookies- I ended up with at least double that number, even though I followed the recipe and made the meringees the size of kisses. The amount of ganache was correct though. It did take a while to fill all the meringues- maybe using a pastry bag would have been faster instead of a spoon. Everyone LOVED these cookies, and I will definitely add them to my cookie repertoire.

These were my favorite cookie this year! Getting the correct amount of egg whites is absolutely critical; I used eggology, and the container claims 1 egg white = 2T, which is incorrect; you must count each egg white as 30g (if you are using large eggs, it should be fine).
