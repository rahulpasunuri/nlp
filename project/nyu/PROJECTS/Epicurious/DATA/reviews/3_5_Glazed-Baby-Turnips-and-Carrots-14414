It was a little boring as directed, so I used maple syrup instead of sugar, and added salt & pepper to taste. So this dish became maple-glazed turnips and carrots -- much better!

This dish is simple but tasty. I added a bit more butter and sugar than called for, and it was just enough. I cooked the turnips and carrots in the butter a bit longer than it called for as well - about 10 minutes - so that they were lightly browned around the edges. As one reviewer said, not the most exciting dish, but a good side to a more elegant main course.

This was the first time we've cooked turnips. We wanted to really taste the turnip, so this was a good recipe. It was good and easy.

Good, but not very exciting. Would make again.

This was ok, but a little on the plain side.

This was a surprise! Very easy and delicious. Be careful not to over cook the turnips, they cooked faster than I expected. I served this with herb crusted pork loin and Epicurious very own Roasted Potato Wedges with Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise.

Basic but good. The sugar isn't enough to "glaze" the vegetables, but they were tender and tasty and worked well with beef tenderloin.
