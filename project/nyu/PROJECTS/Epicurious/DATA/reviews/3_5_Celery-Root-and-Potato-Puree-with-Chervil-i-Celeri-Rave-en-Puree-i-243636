We made it just as described. However, the celery root, even with ricing was not smooth. There are many better recipes if you are looking for a 'mashed' side dish--potato and parsnips as an example.

This turned out well, but only after I made a lot of adjustments. The taste was not right when I used half celeriac and half potatoes--I had to add much more celeriac. Also, it was too thick. I used plenty of light cream, and when I thought it was too rich but still needed thinning, I added milk. Served it with short ribs and they went quite well together.

Very good recipe. Next time I'll make it with fresh basil. The celery root takes longer to cook then the potatoe. This needs to be kept in mind. I used a combination of half n half, and butter to cream this. The ricer works fine as long asyou cook the "root" till soft.
