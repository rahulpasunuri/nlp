Made this on the fly at a friend's cabin, so had to change several things. First off, I used fresh clams, probably around 30 worth meat. I had no cayenne powder or fresh thyme, but did have poultry seasoning, so used that. Was short on liquid, so added a cup of white wine. Used all the rest of the ingredients tho. Was worried my Pacific NW friends wouldn't like it, but they thought it was delicious. No, it's not like canned chowder, but it's really good.

Too thin and the thyme didn't work for me. Maybe I'm eating too much of the canned stuff but it didn't taste like an clam chowder I've ever had.

It was good and pretty authentic, but I found it a lot of effort.

Being from New England, I know my clam chowder! And I have to say, this recipe is one of the best--although I did make a few changes to suit my taste. I used turkey bacon instead of real bacon and I substituted milk for the H&H. But be warned, if you choose a thinner consistency you have to cut back elsewhere too. And by that I mean use less cayenne pepper--or your mouth is going to be on fire!! Learned that the hard way!

I added some chicken boullion, which helped round out the soup. My husband and I enjoyed it throughly.

I sing this dish's praises! I have made this about 4 times, and the last time I HAD to double it, so I had more than enough. The thyme, and cayenne definitely make this dish. And...the taste is not sacrificed by the fat free half and half. Incredible!

This soup is improved immeasurably by the use of real clams instead of canned. I steam quahogs - use the juice and softer parts of the meat as well as cherrystones. Be sure to filter the broth from steaming so you can eliminate the sand. Love the use of fat free half and half.
