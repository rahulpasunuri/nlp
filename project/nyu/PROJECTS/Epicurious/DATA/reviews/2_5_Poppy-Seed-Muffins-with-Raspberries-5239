I've made these a few times - and both times I thought that the raspberries detracted from the muffin. They were too moist. In updating my recipes today I've opted not to save this one. It seems a waste of pricey products (raspberries and poppy seeds).

These came out like little angel food cakes. Tasty, but I agree with other reviews, the berries distract from a perfectly fine cake. Perhaps lemon zest would work better? Only other complaint is that muffins brown all over, resulting in an underwhelming presentation.

Initially I hesitated to try this recipe because a few of the reviewers were so 'underwhelmed' with the final product. All my coworkers thought they were absolutely delicious and a few have asked for the recipe. I used regular flour (instead of cake flour) with excellent results.

I thought these muffins were fabulous; they were so light yet moist. I used frozen blueberries and they turned out great. I loved that they were not dense and heavy like most home-made muffins seem to be.

I can't agree with a muffin recipe that calls for FIVE egg yolks. Yikes!

These did not turn out as good as I expected them to. It seemed like the muffin was so light and cakey that the strong flavor and texture of the fresh cooked berries was not balanced. I would want to try to make the muffins denser somehow.

I was very excited about this recipe but wasn't very enthused will the final product. I don't think I would make it again.

These were very good! Would definitely make them the day that you would like to serve them and make sure that you wrap leftovers on saran wrap!!!

These were wonderful fresh but not so good as leftovers
