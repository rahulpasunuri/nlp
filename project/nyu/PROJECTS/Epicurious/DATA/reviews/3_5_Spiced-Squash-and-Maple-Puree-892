This is so easy and so delicious! We loved it! Made the recipe exactly as written...especially used realy maple syrup. That's probably the key. Yummy! I cooked the sqaush in the microwave (15 minutes for one halved squash), which saves tons of time.

Delicious and quick (once you bake the squash, that is). A yummy dish for the whole family!

This dish was just okay. I've had another pureed squash recipe lately, and I like it much better. I think the primary difference between the recipes was the sauteed onions (an ingredient I normally love), but they affected the flavor of the disch too much. I would not make this again.

Quick, easy and delicious. Now an autumn dinner staple in our house. Tip: Shave off most of the prep time by using the microwaveable bags of pre-cut squash from Trader Joe's.

This was a great side dish. I used two acorn squash and one butternut squash and increased the other ingredients accordingly. It tasted great and all of my guests loved it. Nice aroma, too.

Excellent and a great substitute for mashed potato or sweet potato side dish. Not overly sweet-- the maple syrup flavor was subtle and not as overpowering as brown sugar can be.

I thought the puree to be a waste of delicious acorn squash. So, I cooked and quarted the squash . Prepared the "puree" (omitting the acorn squash). Then topped the acorn squash with the recipe for the puree. It was a very tasty change from the usual brown sugar and butter!
