I think the correct amount of buttermilk is 1-3/4 cups. Found that in an otherwise identical recipe on another website, and it worked very well. I was specifically looking for recipes with molasses, to help boost my daughter's iron intake. Used blackstrap molasses for more iron, switched the amounts of whole wheat and white flour, and added a handful of sunflower seeds. Very good, moist, and excellent texture. I plan to make it often.

Very good, dense bread. I added 2 cups of buttermilk and the dough seemed perfect. Super easy to make.

This recipe is delicious, especially toasted with cream cheese. When I make it I only start with 2 cups of flour and then add more from there. I also cook it about 10 minutes less than the recipe calls for. I have made it twice and will definitely make it again!!

I think the amount of liquid is wrong in the printed recipe: 1 1/2 cup liquid to 5 cups flour/oats does not make a moist dough. I added orange juice (acidic) to get it moist.

There is a serious flaw in the recipe. The result is so dry it will barely hold together. I compared it with other soda bread recipes in cookbooks and found this one to be way too low in both liquid and fat--and rather salty, to boot. This was one I threw away.

HAVE MADE THIS BREAD TWICE AND BOTH TIMES HAVE HAD TO ADD MORE BUTTERMILK THAN CALLED FOR TO GET THE DOUGH TO EVEN MIX MUCH LESS GET TO A STICKY STAGE. HOWEVER, AFTER DOING THAT IT MAKES A REALLY NICE BREAD.
