i'll admit i altered the recipe slightly. since we don't keep kosher, i used half and half for the custard. it came out perfectly smooth and delicious. i also used 3 bags of raspberries for extra sauce (which turned out to be the perfect amount) and made one large trifle. golly, was this a big hit! i've already had requests to make it again next year, and one guest asked if i'd cater her wedding! this is delicious and beautiful, and if you make the components a day in advance it's not that much work. very, very good.

Outstanding non-dairy dessert for Passover or any occasion. I was dubious how the custard would taste as it is made from non-dairy creamer, so I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and more lemon zest. I did not make the sponge cake (though it sounds excellent) but used a purchased one, and I made one large trifle. I also added some sliced fresh strawberries for more texture. I served it about 7 hours after first assembling (and chilling) it and it received rave reviews and requests for seconds.

I made this for Passover, but did not take the time at the last minute to prepare individual portions. I made all the components the day before and I made one large trifle the afternoon of the day I served it. It was awesome, one of the best non-chocolate Passover desserts ever.

What a fabulous Passover dessert! Although the recipe calls for a record number of eggs, the result is a light and refreshing dessert unlike any other Passover dessert I've had. I believe it was the lack of real Cream (pareve) that gave the results the lightness necessary after such a heavy meal. I used strawberries and made one large trifle. Afte 3 days, the trifle turned into one large bowl of mush, but the first day was excellent and then it got mushy after that. I also used fewer bananas since I ran out.

The sponge cake in this recipe is INCREDIBLE. I would eat it alone. I served these trifles at a Passover dinner for 20. This dessert was incredibly well received. These people were used to having only macaroons or sherbet because of the Passover kosher/paerve restrictions. It's wonderful to have great tasting gourmet desserts available at this important ceremonial meal time. I am not Jewish and was thoroughly surprised that a dessert could be this wonderful and still be kosher. WOW!!!
