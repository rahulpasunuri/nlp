This is wonderful. Such a great and unexpected combo of flavors - savory, briny, sweet. Definitely read the reviews, though! There is way too much filling. I followed others' suggestions and used 1 1/2 heads of escarole, and only 1/2 cup rice. Oh, and two fresh roasted red peppers instead of jarred. And dried currents as my local store wasn't carrying golden raisins. All in all, a major upgrade on my grandmother's stuffed cabbage recipe (sorry, Nana!).

Once again I am grateful for the wisdom of the epicurious community! This recipe is ingenious and it's fun to make, but it requires the tweaks some of the reviewers have suggested. The addition of 1/4 teaspoon (or a tad more) of red pepper flakes to the filling is a good idea. Two large heads of escarole are required, not one, and the leaves should only be boiled for two to three minutes. I made half the recipe with escarole and half with Swiss chard, and while the chard was much easier to work with, the escarole offered a more delicate flavor, more enjoyable texture, and looked prettier in the dish. The chard was tasty but slightly overwhelmed the flavors of the filling. This recipe is a keeper and I'll be making it often - it's a one- dish meal that doesn't require a side dish (except maybe a salad).

Lovely. I just kept making little packets until the rice was gone. But I also think that perhaps an Italian version of escarole might be more substantial -- like their zucchini which is less wattery than ours. The escarole leaves are difficult so I used some and then switched to Swiss Chard. Tastes Great!!!

This was easy but took a while to make. It has interesting favors, but I'd add some heat next time. Good for a different taste for your palate. I layered it since my escarole was so wilted.

Excellent! Took the advice of the previous reviewer and didn't even bother attempting the rolling, which just seemed like it would be a mess. Used about half the red pepper and capers and added some aleppo pepper flakes to the mix. Yummy~

Terrific and unique flavors. I had already cored and torn my escarole so couldn't roll it as described. We layered it in the baking dish, half on the bottom, then all the rice, then the rest of the escarole. Turned into more of a veggie lasagna. Worked out fine though and probably easier than rolling.

This is a terrific recipe, especially for a vegetarian entree, though I tweaked it a bit. I used brown rice (parboiled 25-30 mins) rather than Arborio, used about 5 ounces of roasted red peppers, added some cannellini beans for body and protein, and wrapped the mixture in blanched collard green leaves (per another reviewer's suggestion). Delish -- will definitely make again!

Yum! This was so good! I had a hard time with the escarole--it was difficult to roll up the rice, and there was a whole lot of rice left over. Next time I'm either going to use two heads of escarole or some chard instead. I don't like roasted red peppers, so I used 1 sauteed red pepper instead, and I added about 5 chopped sun-dried tomatoes. I also used romano instead of parm because that's what I had. It was totally delicious and reheated well the next day too.

Delicious and attractive dish. The escarole wasn't enough to handle all the rice mixture, so I grabbed some large collard leaves, par-boiled them, and used four of them as well. In all, I made eight bundles, four of escarole, and four of collard. In comparison, we thought the collard was the more successful wrapper, so next time we'll do all collards and no escarole! Collard leaves were much easier to wrap the rice mixture in. Very delicious and appealing dish -- great for guests.

Wish I would have reviewed the comments before making this dish. I would have cooked the escarole for less time and also cooked less stuffing. I packed the bottom of the baking dish with the extra stuffing, and lay the rolls on top of it. This would make a dynamite stuffing for chicken or pepper. We loved the pine nuts and the capers. Tasty and even filling, and great for a vegetarian meal.

Unique concept - the bright green rolls studded with toasty, melted bits of Parmegiano- Reggiano make a dramatic presentation. The flavors are good, but in my humble opinion, could be kicked up a notch. I'm thinking about how to do that because I would definitely like to make this again. Other recipes I have seen include chopped anchovies and/or black olives. I did not find the roasted red peppers to be too dominant, but make sure that you use a good quality Italian-style and rinse them as directed. After eyeing the volume of the completed stuffing, I realized that even though I had a 1 1/4 lb. head of escarole, it was not going to work due to its shape. I continued the recipe the next day after finding a head of escarole with the longest, widest leaves possible. As previous reviewers suggested, blanch the escarole for only 3 minutes - any more and it will become mushy. To make assembly easier, keep the base attached to the leaves until AFTER you have spread and overlapped them as much as possible; then trim the base and proceed.

This is a delicious dish, and not too much trouble to make. For the escarole, try this: blanch for only 3.5 minutes, then carefully separate the leaves and lay out, overlapping, to form a square shape. Spreading the leaves out really helps when stuffing. I slipped a chef's knife under the stem end to help with the first twist of rolling. With a standard sized head of escarole, I had enough rice left over for another 2-3 rolls, and just served it along side (it finished cooking in the same pan as the 4 rolls I made with the recipe). Although it says that it serves 4, I think that it serves 2 as a vegetarian main dish, and would only serve 4 as a side dish.

This is an excellent side dish. Even my mother in law says it is delicious. Makes extra rice, but it is so good, that I am going to use the rice recipe to stuff tomatoes. Can't wait.

This was a wonderful recipe! The rice filling was so delicious, and it was such a novel idea to use escarole. I love the raisins to add a bit of sweetness. I will definitely make this recipe again.

These were wonderful! The instructions for quartering and rolling these up are kinda vague so you just gotta do what works for you! Next time I will not boil the escarole for so long (only did it for 4 min) as it is difficult to spread the delicate leaves. The dish reminded me of greek dolmas. :]

This dish looks dee-lish but am struggling with how to prep the escarole to roll up the stuffing. Can someone clarify the process (from "quartering lengthwise but keeping base attached"- does that mean to not quarter the base? to "cut the base off one quarter" - what then happens with that quarter?) I guess I could just go with the flow and come up with my own way to roll these up but would love some guidance. Thanks!

Delicious! Made as directed, except: I boiled two heads of escarole (and made 8 rolls--thanks for the tip about too much stuffing from a previous reviewer), and still had a little bit of stuffing left over. Perhaps my escarole heads were smaller than what is required. I boiled the escarole for only 4 minutes (also thanks to a previous reviewer). I added slivered almonds to the pine nuts (I had less than 1/2 C of pine nuts in my cabinet), and they tasted fine, with a nice contrast of the mild crunch to the rest of the stuffing from the nut mixture. As always with broiling, watch the rolls carefully because they will burn before you know it! I needed less than 6 minutes to brown the parmesan.

This is a great one-dish veg meal - I substitute sub dried tomato for the red peppers and it's awesome!

This recipe uses a very large amount of red peppers and relies very heavily on the red peppers for flavor so if you're not a HUGE fan of red peppers, it's probably not for you. The flavors were interesting and it looks pretty when it's finished. I added sweet italian sausage to it and that complemented the other flavors well. Interesting flavors but not something I would make often due to the need to use 4 separate pans (1 for boiling cabbage, 1 for cooking rice, skillet for cooking flavor mixture and baking dish).

NOT SURE WE WOULD LIKE THIS RECIPE,BUT LOOKED INTEESTING.WOW GREAT WILL MAKE AGAIN

I liked this recipe very much -- it is delicious and easy to prepare. One caution -- the escarole cooks through in much less than 6 minutes. When I cooked it according to the directions it was way too limp to separate and roll up, so next time I will only cook it for about 4 minutes. And the rice probably only needs about 8 minutes, since it will finish cooking in the oven.

These rolls were outstanding. Awesome flavor and fairly easy to prepare. A great alternative to stuffed cabbage for vegetarians.

Healthy and delicious! I really enjoyed this one! At first I had trouble rolling up the escarole neatly -- but then got the hang of it. Was not able to fit all the stuffing, so just sprinkled it over the baking dish before putting it in the oven.

Great Vegetarian Dish! My non-vegie guests loved it too! Don't change a thing.

I made this for a dinner party sunday night and everyone loved it. Personally I love any dish that combines salty and sweet, and crunch and chewy. And the cheese is the perfect touch.
