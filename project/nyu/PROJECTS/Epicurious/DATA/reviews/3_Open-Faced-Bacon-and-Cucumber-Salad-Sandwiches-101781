Good eating!! To the cook from Tampa- do you fancy yourself an a**hole. How rude you are - just rate the recipe!

Easy to make, but nothing special. Hello, "Cook on 7/10/99"?! Did you read the last sentence telling you what to do with the cucumber salad (which includes the yogurt)? Obviously not! Do you fancy yourself a proofreader? Apparently, ignorance is bliss in your home.....
