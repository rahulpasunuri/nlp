I made this as directed in the recipe, and it won't come out like the picture if you do that. The main issue is the marinade is too thin to develop into a sauce in one hour of oven time; also, the juice from the ribs overwhelms the marinade in volume. As far as taste, it's decent but the cumin is what comes through, so if you don't like cumin, move on. (I love it!) Were I to use the marinade ingredients again, I'd probably do two things: 1) cook down the marinade on the stovetop until it is syrupy *before* applying to the meat, and 2) preheat the the baking dish and/or sear the ribs on the stove to keep the moisture from escaping. Bottom line: this recipe was not well conceived in terms of procedure, but there's a good rib recipe in there if you work on it.

I love this recipe. I've made it 4 or 5 times and it's always easy and delicious. I usually add the juice from grated ginger, and sometimes minced garlic. Have noticed that I can't actually taste the orange. Perhaps I will try using orange zest or reducing the oj first. Nonetheless, still love it.

Used pork ribs. I took a lot of the reviewer's suggestions - added minced ginger, red pepper flakes, a few drops of (Chalula) hot sauce, and lots of minced garlic. Cut the brown sugar by 1/3. Just followed the recipe and baked them. Used tin foil to line the pan. Boiled the marinade stovetop without adding anything and coated the ribs with the sauce. My family loved it. They have asked for a repeat performance. But next time, 3 ribs apiece instead of 2. I'm trying to make the meat a side instead of a main, as dictated by Michael Pollan. I served it with Heidi Swanson's recipe for sauteed greens and used red chard with garlic, toasted almonds, and a bit of parmesan tossed in.

I used twice the amount of ribs and served this as a main entree (cut portions were larger). I doubled all ingredients, added a heaping spoonful of minced garlic and about a teaspoon of ginger. IT WAS EXCELLENT!!!

Very good with some modifications. The marinade really needs some spice. I added a small amt of chipotle tabasco and red pepper flakes. I cooked the meat in a roasting bag as suggested by another reviewer. I then boiled the remaining sauce from the bottom of the bag with cornstarch to thicken it up and use as a dipping sauce. Very very tender and delicious.

This recipe is fool proof. Instead of the cumin, I add ground ginger. The ginger goes more with the savory soy. I made these ribs all of the time.

Rating: 4
I didn't have cumin so I didn't use any but instead added honey, shaoxing wine and pepper. This added an even deeper flavor to the pork and everyone really liked it! You can save the remaining sauce to cook with something else but be warned: it's rather sweet.

followed previous review and cooked them in a bag w/no marinating time. Delicious, but could have been spicier. Next time I'll add chili sauce. So easy!

the ribs were tasty,but still very tough.. would cook for much longer than recommended

This recipe did not do it for me, the marinade simply didn't impart enough flavor for my taste, if I need ribs fast, I recommend a quick boil and then on the grill with your favorite sauce/glaze, if you have the time, slow BBQing is of course the way to go.

These are so delicious!!! I add some minced garlic to the marinade.

Great recipe. I was in a hurry one evening and decided to try a short cut, skipping the marinating time and using an oven roasting bag: Mix marinade ingredients in large measuring cup until sugar dissolves. Cut racks into individual ribs and place in a large bowl. Pour marinade over ribs, stir to coat well. Prepare an oven roasting bag with recommended 1 T of flour, and place on a large roasting sheet. Pour ribs with marinade into bag. Carefully arrange ribs so they are, as much as possible, in a single layer. Be careful not to puncture the bag. Seal the bag with the provided tie, and snip a few vent holes in the top with scissors. Roast for 1 hour. Quick prep, no clean up. Delicious!

What an easy way to make ribs & great flavor in the sauce. I added a little garlic & ginger paste to the marinade. Worked like a charm, also used Beef Ribs as they were on sale - no matter, they tasted great!

I added garlic and ginger as suggested but found the cumin way too strong. Not really worth continuing to tweak.

I think this is a great quick recipe. I would add garlic and maybe tabasco. Make sure you have the oven on ROAST. It will make a difference in appearance and sticky sauce. The first time I baked it, it looked bad, then I saw roast so I continued the cooking with roast and it was perfect. Next time I think I'll add ginger, garlic and some kind of "hot" or "spicy" flavoring, simmer on stove then add to ribs in cooking dish and cook. Or let the sauce cool completely and soak for an hour then cook. I will try yet another way and add it if it comes out good.

the sauce may not be the most exciting, but they're easy to make and my 4-year old meat-hater ate them -- so that's good enough for me.

The glaze really makes this dish. Try slow cooking at 250 degrees for 3 -3 1/2 hours and it's even better. I served it with sweet potatoes and swiss chard in a honey mustard sauce (also a recipe from epicurious).

This dish was so easy and delicious! I didn't have orange juice, so I used the peach-mango flavored "V8 Fusion" juice instead. Even my three-year-old meat-hating twins liked this dish!

I doubled the marinade ingredients annd added garlic and cayenne. Depending upon what kind of ribs you have, they could cook for 2-3 hours. I left my ribs together, cooked for 2 hours, then finished on the grill. I skimed fat off marinade, and reduced in a separate pan. In my case, it never became "syrupy" on it's own. Used the reduced marinade to brush on the ribs while grilling.

Great dish. Have made it many times as an entree. Always use my grill though, low heat, for one hour. Ribs are tender & juicy - perfectly glazed.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! It's as easy as it gets, and it's not overly sweet. I had no problems at all with the glaze burning as others did. I doubled the recipe to serve 4 as a main course, and used two 9x13 pyrex dishes. After I pulled the ribs out I reduced the glaze in a pan on the stoptop and poured it over the ribs. What a hit!

Rating: 2
This was just O.K. I was expecting it to be better given the reviews. The flavor was very mild and the marinade was stuck to my pan instead of the ribs. If I was to make this again I would only do 2 lbs of ribs (I used 3 lbs) and I would line the pan with nonstick foil.

Rating: 4
Easy, tasty, a real hit with my PICKY children. They were tender, but not too sticky or saucy. I cooked them on "convection" for 40 minutes, and that was enough time. My marinade started to burn, so I would add more liquid to the dish while cooking next time. My family wants tham again tonight!

Rating: 3
Very good! Good glaze. Nice and tender. Next time I might add some zing with ginger and/or chili paste. Suggestion from experience: Line your shallow roasting pan with heavy duty aluminum foil! The baked sugar and soy sauce can make a solid, black crust that can be hard to clean up.

Rating: 2
Not sure that the sauce is thick enough to stick to the ribs and carmelize. My sauce carmelized on the bottom of the pan and hardly any on the meat. Tasty, but probably not a recipe I would keep.

Re. the comment from "Cook from brooklyn,ny" about the ribs being "grey and funky": given as much OJ, soy sauce and brown sugar as the recipe calls for, I don't how *ANYTHING* can be "grey and funky"! :-) I used wild boar ribs instead of pork ribs. (The boar ribs were actually cheaper than the pork ribs that day!!) I cheated and boiled the ribs until they're tender, then tossed them in the marinade & broiled them to get the flavor & color. (It was for a big party and I had to cut down on the oven time needed.) They were a big hit!

Brought these to a Survivor party. They were so easy to make. I did have to cook them a bit longer then an hour to get them to brown nicely.

NOt sure if my review is fair. Covered the ribs for first 40 min, on low gas, and they were grey and funky. Uncovered and cooked for another 40 min, then broiled. No taste, juice dried up, and only somewhat tender.

We've made this dish several times and found it both simple and delicious: the prep and cooking couldn't be much easier, and the sauce cooked down to a lovely, sticky mess. The ribs themselves may be a little on the dry side, but without slow-smoking, not sure that's preventable. One of those dishes where an odd combo of ingredients melds into an ineffable whole.

I used country style ribs which are far less expensive than baby back. We thought they were quite good. I don't know that I'd spend the money on baby back ribs for this recipe though.

The ultimate in recipes for these sorts of ribs can be found on this site. It's called Ribs with Orange-Ginger Glaze. A bit time-consuming but FANTASTIC!

It was ok. Not as tender as some folks mentioned (cooked 2 hours at 300F). Taste (and look) reminds me of chinese spare ribs, but slightly different in taste.

Great, easy weeknight dish! This is the second time I've made this dish and will definitely include this in my "staple" list. I marinated the ribs for 3-4 hours and added a touch of ground cloves and cayenne. The first time I served with rice pilaf the second time with a fully loaded baked potato and salad -- FABULOUS!

I took a few of the reviewers advice and added a few cloves of minced garlic to the marinade - also used Chinese 5 spice instead of cumin. Oh, one last change - also added some chinese chili sauce to the marinade. The ribs were delicious! Would definitely make them again.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare. Just added a minced glove of garlic to the mixture, and marinated a few hours.

Thought they were good, but I thought the flavour could have been stronger. Also, my marinade never reduced, stayed runny. Would add cornstarch to it as other reviewer suggested next time. Also to original marinade would add hot chil pepper flakes, and orange zest and marinate ribs for longer. Lots to say, but really an overall good recipe.

This recipe is super easy, and fast. I used five-spiced powder instead of cumin, and after baking for 1 hr, I took the ribs out, skim off the fat from the sauce before I boil it down until it's syruping, then pour it on the ribs. Although the ribs are not falling off the bones, but they are not dry, and are very delicious!

Rating: 3
These were very tasty! I reduced the temp to 300 and cooked for 2 hours. The ribs were very tender but I think it impacted the sauce. It did not thicken and caramelize quite like it should. I think this was due to cooking at a lower temp and also because I doubled the recipe which lead to a full pan and lots of liquid. Lining the pan with foil made for easy clean up. I'm already looking forward to making these again.

Incorporated suggestions of many of the other reviews.... cooked longer, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic. I made a second recipe of the marinade, combined with pan drippings, fat skimmed off, cook on stove top, thicken with cornstartch and water combination. Tossed with ribs. Delicious!

I've never made ribs at home before, but this recipe is very simple and easy to follow. I marinated the ribs over night in a covered tupperware container and roasted them on baking pan lined with foil (definitely line your pan!! It makes cleaning up so easy!). I kept them in the oven for another 1/2 hour at 350 and they turned out great! I will definitely make this dish again!!

For the simplicity of this dish, it's fantastic. I'd never made ribs at home, and these were so easy to make... not to mention so yummy. I think the quality of meat really makes a difference, though.

This recipe is really unique in that it would make a guest think that you spent gobs of time in the kitchen, when, in fact, there is virtually no labor involved!!! Used a scant pound of boneless country pork ribs that I trimmed of excess fat and cut into rib-sized strips. I made one-half of the marinate and chilled the strips in the fridge as written. Used an 8 x 8-inch glass baking dish and roasted the rib strips at 400 degrees (we live at high altitude). I checked them at 25 minutes to see if it was time to turn them, and they were done!! Thickened the juice with a bit of cornstarch mixed with water, and covered them for 5 minutes while I finished up the rest of dinner--ya, ya--to heck with "hors d'oeuvre servings". These ribs, along with "Viennese Cucumber Salad" (from this site), and plain long-grain white rice, made a delicious super easy dinner for 2 when it was 104 degrees outside (and the oven didn't need to be on for very long!). Do try this recipe!! The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Yum, Yum.

I took the advice of several readers here and the ribs turned out beautiful, deep brown with a wonderful flavor. I doubled the marinade recipe, marinated them for about 3 hours, and then cooked them at 300 for a little over 2 hours (took them out when the marinade had reduced to practically nothing and the ribs were a rich brown). The meat fell off the ribs and my husband couldn't get enough of them.

I followed the directions like the recipe said but the final result lacked the flavor I was hoping for .. The ribs (or sauce) was bland and didn't have the "kick" the I thought it would ..

Rating: 1
It seems like other people had more success with this recipe than I did. When I made this, the sauce didn't cook down to a sticky goo like implied. The ribs ended up having very little taste of the marinade and were an unpleasant color. I served these at a party and it was kind of embarassing because there were lots left over.

Great alternative to the usual BBQ'd ribs. Next time I will add a little red pepper flakes to give it a little more zig. Also thought it needed more cooking, I like my ribs fall of the bone tender. Would bake them longer at a little lower tempature.

Out here, we do a lot of grilling rain or shine. This recipe works as well on the grill as it does in the oven. I marinated the 3 entire racks of baby back ribs for about 4 hours. They were grilled over a medium-high heat, for just over 1½ hours and were moist and sweet. The crowd of 9 wanted more. Needless to say, the recipe went home with all.

I have always made my Baby Back ribs in the oven. These were absolutely delicious and I will make them for company, as dinner or for cocktail parties as appetizers although they are somewhat messy to eat. Please spray you pan with Pam before starting this dinner though and the cleanup will be so much easier. I can't wait to make them again. I did add a bit of garlic pepper and a little Seasoned Salt. I baked them about 1 1/2 hours, but I turned the heat down to about 350 after the first hour.
