This was a lot of stuff on a slice of pizza and the parts didn't create a particularly wonderful whole. I'd experiment with some other toppings.

We love it. Have made it for company and ourselves throughout the summer. Asways a hit!

Disappointing. I added chopped Roma tomatoes to one of the pizzas and wish I had done to the other because the one without had no pizzazz.

I followed the recipe exactly for making the dough and cooking the pizza. The results were excellent. It made four small pizzas which I then topped with a variety of ingredients.
