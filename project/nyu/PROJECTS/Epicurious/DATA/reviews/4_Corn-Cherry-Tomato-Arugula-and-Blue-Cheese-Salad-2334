SO GREAT!!! My guests LOVED this salad. I followed some of the other reviews and used feta instead of blue cheese - mainly because my other dishes were pretty rich, so I wanted to make this salad a bit lighter. I also used white balsamic. Finally, because it was the height of sweet corn season, I grilled 3 ears of sweet corn and used those kernels for the salad. I probably could have gone up to 4 ears, but 3 was fine.

I must have done something wrong with this salad. I suspect it was the blue cheese - it was rather strong-flavored and it was pretty much what you could taste. Also, I did not have arugula, so I substituted baby spinach for it, which may have also made the difference. I tried adding bulgur to soften the flavor, to little avail. Judging from all the favorable reviews and from the ingredient list, this must be a good salad. I will try making it with feta, or finding a less overpowering blue cheese. I'm not rating it until I make it again - as I don't think the outcome was not the recipe's fault, but before then, maybe someone would have an improvement suggestion.

Simple, easy and delicious. Used feta instead.

This is an excellent and versatile salad! I used cherry tomatoes and green beans from my garden. I would have enjoyed their flavor more with less dressing than the recipe calls for. Don't leave out the arugula. It's great with the bleu cheese.

Fabublous recipe! I made it just as directed and next time I would use white balsamic for color otherwise it was perfect. Everyone raved...

This is as good as all the reviews say. I used pre-crumbled blue cheese and had no issues with it "turning brown" from the vinegar. Added cilantro as others suggested. I usually ignore celery but it really adds to this salad. Perfectly amazing use of summer produce!

This was fantastic and so easy to make. This was the star of our dinner party. I thought it was just OK until the arugula was added. A real winner. The only change I made was to use white balsamic instead of brown. You will not be disappointed.

I never would have thought to add blue cheese to corn, but the combination of flavors is fab. After reading the other comments about the unsavory look of the balsamic vinegar, I used rice vinegar instead. Very good.

This was a big hit at an August dinner party with fresh corn and tomatoes from the garden. If you dress the salad separately, it will keep for days. Don't omit the onion and celery -- they give great crunch!

I have made this many times with great success. I use feta cheese. A summer standard at our house with the world's best summer corn from Indiana.

Excellent flavor combination. I grilled the corn and used white balsamic for the dressing and used a baby arugula salad green combo. Other than that I followed the recipe to take to a tailgate. At serving time I tossed in the greens and dressing. Loved by all.

Great recipe and very quick and easy to make. I substituted white balsamic vinegar so the salad wouldn't turn a brownish color. I originally bought arugula but it was bad so I didn't put it in. My husband liked the salad without it and thought that if I added it, it wouldn't be as good. I've made this for several barbecues and everyone loves it.

Great recipe! I have made it numerous times, but have found that replacing the arugula with crisp-tender green beans or asparagus to be the true winner; and it keeps better.

Perfect salad for a BBQ! I served this with some grilled chicken and beef kabobs. My guests gobbled up this light, refreshing and totally complimentary flavored salad. A keeper!

Like salads but don't love them. This has to be one of the better ones. Brought this to a family BBQ and received compliments but not raves as I expected from reading others' reviews. There were even leftovers. I could not find arugula so I subbed a mix of watercress, frise and a little baby spinach, which together lent the sharpness needed of the greens in this recipe. Bought a good blue cheese and it really made the salad. I love cherry tomatoes and used fresh corn and their sweetness was perfect with the peppery greens and salty cheese, a balance of acid coming from the balsalmic. Lovely.

Just made the salad for a barbeque over this past weekend and once again my guests were wowed. I too add more arugula. I also have added avocados and cilantro with sliced flank stead for an incredible mexican steak fajita salad!!!

I couldnt find arugula so I used a bag of fresh spinach. It has become a must at all family cookouts. I also eliminated the celery.

This was ok, nothing fancy. Would be excellent for tail gating or picnic. Kids however were recluctant to eat corn in their salad, but, overall not bad.

unbelievably delicious salad. we had it two nights in a row. i'm not much of a salad eater, but i ate only salad and skipped the very tasty flank steak it's served with. the only thing i did differently was add some walnuts. it was just fabulous!!!

Wonderful! The only thing I added was a handful of cilantro and the salad was the hit of the meal. I'll definitely make this one again.

This is a wonderful, tasty, crunchy salad. I have made it a few times. Once, I had no blue cheese, so I substituted a little parmesan and fresh feta - not bad ! I agree with previous reviewers that the amount of arugula should be increased a little bit.

This was good but not great. I think the dressing needs more kick,maybe some garlic and spices.

I must admit to getting tired of making this wondrous salad. I first made it about one year-ago. Ever since I am requested to bring it as my contribution to "dish-to pass dinners". I'm also told to make it when I have issued the invitations. I'm making it again for tomorrow"s Thanksgiving dinner. I am humbled by my culinary artistry. :>). Just try it! You'll love it.

This salad was a great change of pace and a great way to use some of those cherry tomatoes from my garden! I could not find the arugula at my store so I used a bag of European mix greens, it turned out great!

Just as good as the reviews promised! I hadn't had arugula before and loved it in this recipe. I ended up using about 6 oz and it seemed just right. Yum!

Excellent salad-- it's even more colorful if you put the red onions in, too. I also increased the arugula, but I can't say how much since I just threw in enough leaves to balance the other ingredients. The flavors are strong and make this an ideal first course to precede a meat main dish. I substituted grape tomatoes and didn't bother halving them, but I think it's better with more smaller tomato pieces to balance all the flavors.

Loved this salad but was confused about the arugula amount. 2 1/2 oz pkgs?? Can someone clarify, or does someone have the original recipe from 1994? I used a 7 oz pkg which worked fine, but I'd be interested to know how much it's really supposed to be.

Very tasty and very attractive. Fresh corn makes it spectacular.

Very colorful (yellow corn, red tomatoes, green arugula, white/blue cheese)! Well, except when you mix the cheese and the balsamic vinegar, which gives you brownish cheese. To take this salad to the 4-fork level, I think it would need at least double the arugula :)

I used a spring mix lettuce rather than plain arugula. I thought it turned out beautifully. I will use this salad during the holiday season. My husband ate three bowls of it. It was yummy!

This is such a great Summer salad! Its quick & easy. I have only made it with fresh Summer corn. Its a great recipe when you have left over ears cooked. It is also great to use up the cherry tomatoes from the garden. I made it once with the celery & once without. I personally don't think it made any difference and will leave it out from now on. Otherwise everything is just perfect! Oh...if the blue cheese is too strong for some then just use less.

This has been one of our favorites since the August 94 issue! Absolutely delicious, and the marinated flank steak recipe that was featured with it is also super.

Oh the tastes and textures in here! I too have been making this for years - it's perfectly wonderful on a too-hot summer's day, or brought as a picnic dish. I use the dressing on regular salads constantly. Have not tried variations yet, but suspect that swiss chard could be substituted for arugula with some success, although less bite. Yumlickshus!

Everyone was right---this is a really delicious salad! I omitted celery, since I had it in another dish and used grape tomatoes instead of cherry. Used fresh white corn. The best!

I can't believe I've been making this salad for 7 summers - time flies with 3 little boys! This is a delicious salad. For a complete meal, I add a 15oz tin of rinsed black beans.

This is a hit! I love the peppery taste of arugula. Maybe watercress or dandelion greens would be good substitutes? Spinach and romaine sound a little bland.

This recipe became one of our summer salads back in 1984. Thank goodness for this website, because we have misplaced our August 1994 issue and I never bothered to memorize it before, and I plan to fix it tonight. When our local store is out of arugula, we substitute romaine. Has anyone found a better subustitute?

This is a favorite at our house, and it's especially good when you make it with grilled corn, cut from the cob. When tomatoes are ripe and corn is sweet, this dish is really outstanding.

I made this salad for the first time about a year ago. It has was so wonderful I have made it again and again, we eat it a a summer meal with crusty french bread. I have made it for many guests and without fail they have left with the recipe. They have reported that as they have made it and served it to others the same thing has happeded as well.

A wonderful spring salad that is full of flavor. It was a big hit a an informal dinner party. Invest in good blue cheese, as it will make a difference.
