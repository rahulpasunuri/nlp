I used dry Tena figs and a $4 Cab Sauvignon, doubled recipe and simmered for about 25 minutes. The figs came out just beautifully and felt so decadent. Honestly, they didn't really need the ice cream.

Delicious! Served over vanilla ice cream for dessert... and over coconut yogurt (was out of vanilla) for breakfast the next morning! Liked it even better over the yogurt. Next time I make this I will cut back on the honey just a bit... and I also found I had to poach the figs a bit longer than the recipe recommended to get them as tender as I like. Fantastic overall!

This sauce was lovely over vanilla ice cream. The figs however remained a bit "al dente". I didn't mind them this way although I am not sure how tender they should have been. Would definitely make again, I used a merlot wine, the result was a rich, dark wonderful sauce.

I followed the recipe except I used 3/4 lbs of fresh figs, and reduced the simmering time accordingly to 15 mins. If you have the patience to reduce the sauce to 1/4 c, you will see it suddenly becomes thick and rich, and looks like a chocolate sauce! The sauce has a strong, wonderful flavor. Unfortunately, in contrast, it makes the figs taste bland, since the figs did not benefit from the longer steeping time with the cinnamon stick and cloves.

I used a pinot noir and made the recipe exactly as listed. This was sublime! I'm usually the type of person who will choose a chocolate dessert over a fruit one, but this was every bit as rich, thick, and satisfying as chocolate. I didn't even bother with ice cream.

I like this dessert, but I think the recipe needs some experiementation. The flavors were good but a little "thick." I made it just as it calls for here, but I think next time I would use a light-bodied red (I used barbera) like red zinfindel or beaujolais (sp), add another clove and cut back on the honey by a half tablespoon or more. I must say, though, given the cold October night, this recipe made my place smell wonderful! Served over Hagen-Daaz light vanilla ice cream.
