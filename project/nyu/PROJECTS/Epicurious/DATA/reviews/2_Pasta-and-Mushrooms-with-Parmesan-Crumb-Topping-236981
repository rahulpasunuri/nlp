I added portobello mushrooms to this recipe and poured some white wine in the sauce while simmering. Instead of adding parsley to the breadcrumbs, I used it fresh on top of the pasta. Came out delicious.

took people's advice and added 1/2 a can of whole tomatoes with sauce. Chopped the tomatoes and tossed it in with the porcini and chicken broth and let all of it simmer. Was really delicious.

This dish is incomplete in my opinion. Very bland and a bit dry. However, adding a bechamel or other sauce to this dish makes it more palatable.

Dish was "ok". I'll try it again with modifications - maybe a can of tomatoes to add more depth to the pasta. I found the porcini to be most pronounced. If you like that, you'll enjoy this; I prefer them more as an accent, so it was a little too 'earthy' for me.

I was looking for a vegetarian pasta dish and I thought, with a little work, this one might be good. This recipe really needs some tweeking. Very bland. I even used my dried black morels instead of crimini hoping to give it depth of flavor. I cut back on the garlic because of the previous review said the topping was way too garlicky. I was sorry I wasted my morels(they're so precious).Will delete this one from my recipe box.

edible, but boring. I thought the fresh garlic in the topping was the best part - at least it had flavor!

I'm sad to give this dish a 2 fork rating. I thought the mushroom pasta portion of the recipe was absolutely delicious on its own. The parmesan crumb topping completely overpowered all of the other flavors due to the (basically) raw garlic. I think this dish would be exceptional if the garlic in the crumb topping is briefly sauteed. I will do this next time and I'm sure it will be wonderful.
