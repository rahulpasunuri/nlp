My beet slices were too big around so I ended up cutting them into matchsticks, which worked well. Couldn't find frisee (whatever that is) and substituted watercress. Quite elegant, perfect for the holidays (all that red and green!). Will definitely make again.

I added one more garlic clove and also quite a bit more of the balsamic vinegar to give it a more vinaigrette-y flavor rather than sweet flavor. I was very happy with how it turned out!

Very good salad: lots of tang from the mustards. I used an extra clove a garlic. I also roasted the beets (400 degrees for 1 1/2 hours) and then peeled and chopped them. I didn't have the same greens but substituted others. Would definitely make again.
