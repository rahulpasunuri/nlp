This is a spectacular dessert, even though the crust was a bit recalcitrant going into the pan. I made it in my food processor, which worked just fine. None of the reviewers noted that when the white chocolate is added to the gelatin mixture, it turns an alarming shade of dryer-lint mauve. This unfortunate shade was tempered by the whipped cream. I glazed the strawberries with a bit of melted red currant jelly and cassis, to make it shiny, and drizzled dark chocolate over all.

This is an absolutely delicious and beautiful dessert! Since my creme de cassis was 20+ years old, I used chambord, which worked great. I used plastic wrap to roll out the dough. The dough seemed so dry, I didn't think it would roll out, but it did! I brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it! If you are considering making this--do!! You won't be disappointed. Don't skip the white chocolate curls; they put it over the top!

Show stopper! I drizzled some white chocolate on top. Rave reviews from everyone.

This is a winner! I have made it twice and both times it just pressed the crust into the pan. I also drizzled white chocolate over the berries. My husband said this was the best dessert I have ever made.

This was absolutely fabulous, and my husband asked for it again next week for Father's Day: his new favorite!! I cut corners though and used a Pillbury pre-made crust and folded it into the tart pan: it was great!!

Boyfriend loved it, esp the milk choco layer --said it tasted like caramel. I used Lindt for the milk choco and Ghiradelli's for the white. The only prob I had was with the crust; turned out completely foobar the first time (I probably measured the flour wrong or smthg-- too gooey) so I used epicurious's "Sweet Pastry Dough" recipe and that was much easier. I did this in a heart-shaped pan, and arranged the strawberries in a random mosaic pattern. Apparently it was v delicious! Would make a great valentine's day treat.

Wonderful desert!! I have made it twice now (once for work and once for inlaws) and everyone asked for the recipe. My husband says its a "keeper". I must confess though that I didn't make the tart, I bought small sponge cakes and put them in a tart shell, and melted the milk chocolate with some butter and Tiple Sec before brushing it over the cakes.

This recipe is beautiful, impressive, and has been a great success every time I've prepared it! I found the dough a bit difficult to work with, so I chose to press the dough into in to the pan instead of rolling it out. Leftover crème de cassis can be used to make Kir Royales, a nice accompaniment to the dessert :)

This is a fantastic dessert and was loved by all who ate it. Though the crust came out okay in the end (thanks to the wise suggestion from Terri), I feel that there must be an easier way to peel off the last layer of wax paper without all the dough peeling away from the tart pan. Would spraying Pam on the wax paper work? How about adding a little more flour to the dough? And thank goodness I had foil on the bottom of the oven, otherwise I would have had a big mess to clean up as the butter melted through the removable tart pan base. If I could get these issues resolved, then this would definitely rate 4 forks! All-in-all I will definitely make this again! It's scrumpdillyicious!

I brought this over to a friend's house for dessert. Everyone was very impressed. This is absolutely one of my favorite recipes. Sharing this dessert made me feel like a true "Culinary" Baker! Very impressive, although it can be a little spendy to make.

Great tart. I made it this weekend and got good reviews. I made two tarts one with the original recipe and one reversed - I used white chocolate on the crust and milk chocolate mousse with the strawberries and the added blueberries it was great! However, I prefer the original recipe of the white chocolate mousse. My boyfriend preferred the other.

Pretty easy to make and my guest were very impressed. Everybody who tasted it wanted the recipe and my husband - who says he doesn't like desserts - proclaimed this a definite keeper!

I substituted blueberries for the raspberries, and served this on the fourth of July--it was a big hit, although I suggest that you melt the dark chocolate yourself and brush the MELTED chocolate on the crust--that is the only way it worked for me.
