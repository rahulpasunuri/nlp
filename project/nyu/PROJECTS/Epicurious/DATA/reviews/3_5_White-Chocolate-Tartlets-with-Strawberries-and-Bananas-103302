It was a lot more time consuming than what I had anticipated but well worth it in the end. Everyone loved them. I omitted the orange liqueur, but I'm sure it would have tasted great with it as well.

This came out amazing! I made this as one of the four Easter Desserts and there was none left with leftovers of the others! However, I don't like white chocolate so i substituted it for milk chocolate and used unsweetened chocolate to line the crust, it was great! The hazelnut added a nice flavor that complemented the chocolate, strawberries, and banans.

I found the white chocolate mousse to set too stiff. I did not care for the consistency. Overall, I was disappointed in this recipe that was so time consuming.

The tartlets were brilliant, and I would definitely make them again. I did, however, have trouble with the white chocolate filling--the chocolate and the whipped cream separated, and it took several tries to get a decent consistency. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I'm willing to keep trying until I get it right.

This is a fabulous recipe. I have made it three times now and everytime it gets better. It is a time consuming recipe, so I suggest starting it the day before you plan to serve it. I have received nothing but raves. Everyone wants the recipe!!!

My exerience with the Creme Brulee French Toast encouraged me to take on this, my second, epicurian adventure. Those who liked it RAVED about it. Turns out, though, that my wife detests custard-like dishes and my son doesn't like white chocolate (go figure...). So, too, I couldn't find the (was it Hazel?)nuts, and had no idea that the small spring-form pans would be impossible to find locally (though the William Sonoma site has them: 4-for-$21). So after a false start, used Walnuts and one larger spring-form pan. I will make it again. But I suggest checking with your audience and your cupboard BEFORE going to this non-trivial effort.

I substituted walnuts for hazelnuts and made one tart instead of several tartlets. It was a big hit for brunch and was easier to prepare than I expected.

The crust for this dessert is FABULOUS! I had trouble with the white chocolate filling -- the consistency was not right at all. But I used white chocolate chips, which may have been the problem. Overall, I had many compliments.
