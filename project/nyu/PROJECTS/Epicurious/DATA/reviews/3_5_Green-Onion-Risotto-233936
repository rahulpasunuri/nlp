This was an OK side dish with store bought broth, but an OUTSTANDING delicious dinner with homemade brown chicken stock, half bacon grease, and double the mascarpone.

This was so delicious! I've decided to inch my way towards less meat and so I made this dish on it's own for myself and with a steak for my husband. I definetely think it stands on it's own just fine; it doesn't need anything else. I kept the orange peel and I truly think that it makes all the diference, otherwise, it's just a "risotto semplice".

Love Risotto and this recipe is a great base recipe. I had just come home from the farmers market with some fresh leeks, corn and gr onions..so i added those and swapped out the parm and cream for about 4-5 tbsp of goat cheese. Super creamy, and added fresh basil. The final touch was adding in some shrimp and a perfect late weekend brunch it was! Combined with the fresh peach lavender bellinis, heirloom tomato with burrata, balsamic and basil and it was beyond delish!

Oh, and adding minced garlic as the onions finish softening is a must!

This is my go-to recipe for risotto. I've never tried it with the orange peel, but this is a wonderful standard for risotto technique. One tip - try browning the rice just a touch before adding any liquid. Brown lightly until you can smell a bit of nuttiness - it adds a little extra depth. Don't worry too much about the chopping/slicing for the green onions - just add white parts first, green parts last (so they keep their color)! I often use diced yellow onion first and chopped chives from the garden last if I don't have green onions. Add anything you like with the onions - red peppers, mushrooms, finely chopped squash, etc. I've also used herbed goat cheese instead of cream and parm with wonderful results. Learn this recipe, play with it and make it your own!

I make this all the time, and it never disappoints. Personally, I think the orange zest is what makes this risotto taste like spring, but you could easily omit it. I generally use two bunches of green onions (unless I can get a really fat one from my farmer's market), because it boosts the flavor.

Yum! The creaminess of the parm and mascarpone cheeses and the crunch of the fresh green onions make this one of my new favorite dishes. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and I added garlic (about 4 cloves) and omitted the orange peel. I also used some vegetable broth with the low-salt chicken broth, and the result was SO good! And, this recipe is really easy - this was my first try at making risotto from scratch, and I had no issues. I will definitely be making this again. I think I will also try adding mushrooms next time.

This risotto is very good and we made it with the Maple soy glazed chicken. I added 1/2 cup of Parmesan, and I think I would have been better off following the recipe as it was very rich. I didn't have any wine so I added an extra 1/2 cup of broth and 2 tsp of white wine vinegar.

Yum!! I modified the heck out of this recipe, but it came out delicious & was such a lovely comfort food! I added some garlic to the onions, omitted the orange zest (although I am curious-- I may try that next time), and used fat free half & half instead of whipping cream. It was so rich & creamy, my hubby & I couldn't finish it-- but not for lack of desire! I will definitely make this again =)

This is an excellent recipie that I have made three times now. The first two times I made it, I made it exactly as directed, and I found that I did not like the orange essence imparted by the orange zest, as it tended to overwhelm the dish. This third time I omitted them, and doubled the parmagian cheese and it was excellent. I would also stress that Mascarpone cheese produces a far superior result than whipping cream. This is now on my permanent roster of things to make for my family and my guests.

Our 30 year old refrigerator finally died, so, in desperation, I entered rice/ mascarpone and got this. I had vermouth instead of wine, didn't have an orange, prayed that we wouldn't die from the mascarpone and parmasan that had been unrefrigerated for many hours, but it came out just great and we survived. Used a vidalia onion that I sauteed first with some celery and the kids were saying, "Yum, apples!" (When kids ask, "What's for dinner?" just say, "Something delicious!" and never disclose ingredients, they might not like the sound of something;) This is my favorite risotto, and it uses a lot less butter than my Naked Chef recipes. (I still love you, Jamie!)

This was good as a side dish, but I wouldn't make it for a solo risotto. I wanted a creamy companion to a grilled ribeye, and this did the trick. The orange was good, but it seems to me that lemon zest would be more complementary. Didn't need 4 cups broth.

Awesome risotto! I paired it with a pinot grigio which makes the orange really stand out. Wonderful.

This is a marvelously easy and tasty dish. I've now made it twice, once when it first appeared and today again since I had several bunches of green onions around. The first time I made it exactly with the orange peel and using marscapone. Today, I didn't have an orange around and only had whipping cream. The only real difference is orange peel's unique flavor, but otherwise, they're both great. And, if I'd had the orange, it would've gone in, as I didn't feel it was too weird at all. In fact, this is turning out to be a favorite - the subtlety of flavors - and I intend to make it often!

This was okay as a side dish (would not serve as a stand alone risotto)with the maple chicken. I also made the mistake of putting in all the green onion at the beginning. Probaly would have had a 'brighter' flavor if done correctly. And we agree with others that the orange peel is definitely not an ingredient we would repeat in this recipe.

This was pretty good... I've had better risottos, but I also did run out of broth and had to use water, so that could have contributed. It is, however, one of the easiest risottos I've ever made, so I'll probably make it again.

Nice but the mascarpone/cream made it too creamy for me, and the orange peel was just bizarre. I prefer a savoury risotto with stronger flavours so will not make this again.

This risotto was most excellent. My husband loved the flavor as well and finished all of his food. I have made many risottos in the past and they all seem to blend together...garlic, onion, then mix the risotto...etc. I used the marscapone and added only the white parts early in the dish (though I do admit it was confusing). I would not omit the orange peel, because it was critical to the unique flavor and feel of the dish. The orange peel grating made for an interesting and delicious element. I complimented the meal with Indaba Chardonnay and it was most excellent. I did make this with the Roasted Chicken with Maple-Soy Glaze.

Very good. Misunderstood the directions and cooked all of the green onions at the beginning - I guess they only wanted you to cook the white parts (I wish they'd made that clear). Used the mascarpone cheese (v. the whipping cream), which made the risotto creamier than other types of ristotto. Next time we won't add the orange peel.

This was tasty, but the wine flavor comes through a bit too intensely. I would probably add less next time.

This was so good. My husband who dislikes risotto loved it. Not as bad as I thought it would be (making it) since people say risotto takes a lot of time, etc. It took about 20 minutes. Served it with the chicken...Yumm

Very good and delicious (something different to serve instead of potatoes). A little time consuming, but worth it. I made it exactly as the recipe called and it was great. Will definitely be making it again.
