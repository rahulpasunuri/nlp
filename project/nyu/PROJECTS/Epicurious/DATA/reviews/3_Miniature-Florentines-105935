I've made this recipe for two holiday seasons now and both times the cookies melt into a flat sheet, from which I cut circles. It's quite a process, and next time I would spread the battery onto the parchment paper in a sheet, and then cut into bars while cooling. Also, I substituted orange infused semi-sweet chocolate instead of candied orange peel. Though a challenge, these are really delicious.

I have made this recipe for several years now and it has always been sensational. My family and friends love these cookies. I use mixed peel vs. orange peel at Christmas...great look for the holidays. Cook in Mississauga, Ont.

Tasted great, but impossible to remove from the parchment in one piece. Those suckers really stuck on there!

The candied orange peel was hard to find locally so I found a recipe and made my own which was fine it just added extra time. However, in 400 degree oven way before 8-10 minutes the florentines were charcoal. I lost many of the batches to figuring out how not to burn them yet make them be crisp. Overall, I was frustrated and dissapointed and didn't end up with enough to serve at my party.

I even forgot to add the cream and they still turned out delicious. Be careful not to burn them though

I made this from the magazine recipe. It was super simple to prepare, but I placed the cookies too close together on the cookie sheet. You really have to give these room because what they do is boil up on the parchment. Make sure you wait until they are golden brown, otherwise they will be too chewie. They should harden while cooling and be light and crisp, very similar to the crust of a creme brulee. Make sure to use the finest bittersweet chocolate, as it truely 'finishes' the cookie - the orange and chocolate combination is truely delicious.
