I just made this with however much rhubarb and however many strawberries I had on hand, given that it is a last-minute addition to bring to a waffles-for-dinner party that we are going to tonight. It is pretty soupy, but I know it will be great on these waffles. I, like a lot of other people, did decrease the sugar by quite a bit (I didn't really measure), but it tastes wonderful.

This is so easy and so delicious. I used 1/4 demerara sugar along with the white sugar which lent it a nice rich brown sugar flavor. This is good on plain yogurt, on waffles, or on toast with ricotta or goat cheese.

I am grateful to the person who said use only a half cup of sugar; that was plenty. It does NOT look like the picture; rhubarb cooks down and does not hold its shape, but that's fine. Try adding a small amount of grated orange peel to the cooked rhubarb. The recipe is quick, delicious, and all the ingredients are in season at the same time.

We love this recipe! I cook it longer than the recipe says to make more of a sauce. I serve it over ice cream, but my husband also likes it on toast.

Light, fresh & yummy. Best served soon after chilled because the chopped mint loses its color and turns unappetizingly flaccid.

Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with the rhubarb swimming in sugar water :-( next time will reduce the amt of water and also the amt of sugar as prefer a more sour taste. Once drained the water it was delicious though !

For some reason this came out watery??? I only added the 1/4 c. of water. I used a medium saucepan & some rhubarb came out a little mushy & some a little raw- I thought I'd been stirring, but perhaps not enough, cooked for about 7 min total. Pretty tasty though, although I'd recommend trying the recipe first before making it for guests

The grocery store ran out of rhubarb, but I still wanted to make this recipe so my boyfriend suggested nectarines. I was a little hesitant, but the texture was perfect! I simply peeled the nectarines and cut in medium chunks. I substituted splenda for sugar. The mint gives it that extra kick! Very simple and it got raves at my dinner party!

Does anyone know if this can be frozen for later use? I imagine it would be a bit mushy, but probably still taste pretty good???

A real keeper! Flavors blended extememly well after a night in the fridge ... used a little more mint than the recipe called for. Next time we'll quarter the strawberries ...

Yes, the other reviewers are correct -- this is a wonderful and refreshing dessert. I also used 1/2 cup of sugar, and just a touch of extra mint. It is great with angelfood cake and a little sweet cream. I have made it twice so far and everyone I've served this to has LOVED it!

This is the simplest and most divine recipe. Wonderful on ice cream or thin Danish pancakes and even store-bought meringues. Wonderful if you are in a hurry but want to impress.

Absolutely perfectly simple and delicious. Served it with a slice of vanilla pound cake and ice cream for those who wanted (I did not). Be careful not to overcook it...The 7 minutes was way too long for my rhubarb and it looked quite mushy, not like the recipe picture...

it's spring again and i had to come find this recipe. Oh, it is good and simple and when the rhubarb is in season, I can't get enough. I serve it on it's own, with yogurt and with ice cream. really, you can't go wrong!

I have made this four times now and it has turned out wonderful each time. I make it for company and have gotten raves. I serve it over vanilla ice cream for dessert or french toast for breakfast.

I made this easy recipe for a quick weeknight dessert. My husband loved it over vanilla ice cream, and my son had it the next morning over waffles. Will definitely make it again!

Beware, folks: I served this for dessert tonight to my husband and 19 yo stepson, and the son said he'd never leave home. (Hubby said it was "the bomb"). I cut sugar to 1/2 C and served it over vanilla frozen yogurt and dark chocolate ice cream. Awesome!

I added two slices of lemon and 1 TSP of vanilla powder to the rhubarb. After it is chilled I serve it over Farina or tapioca pudding.

This was very yummy. I lost track of time so my rhubarb was overdone but it didn't detract from the flavor. The mint was a great addition which I was surprised at how well it went with the fruit. We ate it on waffles, ice cream and by itself. I did cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Wow! This was really good.

I have been making this for years, not being fond of mint, I add a splash or so of Kirchwasser (cherry brandy) and that is YUM!

A super way to use that extra rhubarb, just when the mint is at its' best. I completely overdid the rhubard but it still made a great fruity sauce over icecream.

This was so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out beautifully. I spoon it over frozen yogurt, and sometimes add a drizzle of rose syrup.

Yum! We had this over ice cream. The idea of adding a little lemon juice is a good one.

Delicious! Had it in the evening on ice cream and the next morning over pancakes. Wish the climate here would let me grow my own!

This compote is as easy and fast as can be, and a great springtime treat. I served it with vanilla ice cream. The finely-chopped fresh mint is subtle but a very nice touch. I did find the compote to be too sweet as written -- I added some lemon juice and that helped.
