This was pretty tasty, although I made a bunch of changes. I used leftover rice that I'd made pilaf style with chicken broth and onions. I omitted the black beans and used only one red pepper, and I added chopped avocado, diced red onion, frozen corn, lime juice and lots of minced cilantro. I served it with black bean burgers (that's why I left out the black beans).

Beautiful and delicious. I made enough for 24 and tossed in a pound of spinach.

My daughter and I made this for my son's birthday. It was delicious. We added a can of Rotel tomatoes, chopped cilantro and used Balsamic vinegar. MG

I reused the vinaigrette recipe on a spinach salad, and that too was fabulous.

Been making a version of this for years. It's OK cold, but I much prefer it warm. Also, makes a great stuffing for turkey or chicken, not to mention chops!!!

This is a great weeknight side-dish. I cooked my own black beans and used brown rice. It was delicious with chicken and pineapple sala.

I made this recipe for a big afternoon party along with Jamaican Jerk Chicken from this site. It was delicious and even though I tripled the recipe it was gone by the end of the afternoon. I used red, yellow and orange peppers (3 instead of 2), added more cumin, used 1/2 the oil, added a can of corn and lots of cilantro. I also made it late the night before and let it marinate in the dressing. I think that making the rice in a rice cooker helped this dish. I was hoping for leftovers it was so good.

The recipe as written yielded a very bland salad. After a lot of tweaking it tasted much better and was a hit! Make sure to read the suggestions of other posters.

I probably used only about half of the dressing, otherwise it would have been too oily. To me it seemed a little plain, but went pretty well with the Island Pork Tenderloin Salad.

Have made this several times to great reviews. I usually cut the oil back to 1/4 cup and sometimes add a little chopped fresh cilantro. Equally good with some chopped grilled chicken tossed in.

I was asked to bring a salad to a Caribbean themed dinner party. When researching recipes I came across this salad and a recipe for an Avacado, Hearts of Palm & Red Onion Salad. I couldnn't decide between the two so I brought both. The rice salad was good and received favorable comments. People generally liked it but raved about the other. On the recommendation of previous reviewers, I cut the amount of oil to 1/4 cup which worked quite well. I think if I made it again, I would add some corn and perhaps some cilantro. Guests commented on how pretty it looked.

I made this to take to a BBQ and it was the perfect compliment to the Mexican skirt steak that was being served. I like a little bite of tartness in salads so I adjusted the ratio of apple cider vinegar and oliver oil to 50/50. Came out a winner and I am definitely making this again and again.

Made this for a tropical-themed summer party (but didn't use all the dressing), and it was a hit! A refreshing salad with a beautiful presentation.

Whenever I have to make a dish for a get together, I always wonder what to make. Not anymore!! This is my new "bring to get-together dish". I was not expecting it to be so good, but it far surpassed any expectations I may have had.

Rating: 3
What a great recipe! A perfect staple for BBQ's or potlucks. Very colorful, and it even gets better after a day of sitting in the vinaigrette. I always get asked for the recipe! I do agree that you have to scale back on the oil, though. Great idea if you want something easy and done ahead of time!

Rating: 2
I agree with some of the other reviewers that it was abit too oily. I will reduce the amount of oil next time and I will also add more cumin and garlic. I used a green pepper instead of the red and lentils instead of the black beans and it turned out quite good. I would have given it 3 forks if it wasn't so oily.

Rating: 2
Not that this dish is bad, just that so many are so good. I personally thought it was ok, but my guests did not seem to like it. I think cold rice was too much for them. It was also too acidic and probably could have sat overnight and been beter.

I paired this with the Island Pork tenderloin. It was a great combo though I spiced this salad up a bit by adding a little cayenne and some chopped hearts of palm which lightened it up and cut the oil. Next time I will use very light oil and might reduce it a bit.

Rating: 3
Super easy to make and very colorful, but like some other reviewers I feel it is missing something. It needs a little kick...maybe something hot like some minced jalepenos or other spices. I will probably experiment with it when I make it again.

I took this to my book club which had a tropical/Caribbean hit and it was a very colorful and popular dish. I made both the dressing and the rice, bean, and veggie portion the night before and refrigerated them separately. I added the dressing right before serving. I added slightly more garlic and cumin, but found the final result a little too acidic, so may cut down on the vinegar next time.

Very tasty! At the recommendation of other reviewers, reduced the olive oil to a tablespoon or so of oil, added 1 cup corn, 1/8 cup chopped cilantro. Husband gave it thumbs up last night - - said it was even better the second day. This was a hit - will be great for cookouts.

Really like it for pot-lucks/ bbq's. Have made variations with corn and grilled chicken. A hit everywhere.

Fantstic! Very easy to make. I too cut the oil in half and it was plenty. I also used half green onions and half red onions which turned out great. The red onions gave me that crunch i was looking for! And for my other veggies i used corn and a green pepper. Very nice and easy...great for a summer picnic!

Very good. Quadrupled this recipe for a party of about 50, and still have a lot of leftovers. Only used 1/2 the amount of oil, which was perfect. Very tasty, and a great accompaniment to cold chicken salad and cold shrimp salad. Very easy to make.

Rating: 3
Great salad for a crowd. It says it's for 6 but would easily feed 12 as an accompaniment. I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup, did a heaping teaspoon of cumin, doubled the garlic and added chopped cilantro as many suggested. I also took another reviewer recommendation and rinsed the cooked rice so it would stick together. Great make ahead recipe.

I really like this recipe. I have made it several times. I find that it hardly needs any oil at all. I also prefer it without the rice.

I have made this recipe many times - it is a summer staple when grilling steaks. Be careful when pouring the dressing - too much makes it a bit soggy. It is yummy the next day. Try it as a burrito filling with fatfree sour cream and cheddar cheese.

I found this anything but bland. The dressing has a nice flavor and the cold salad is very tasty. I will definitely make this again. Next time I think I'll serve it with corn muffins.

I made it for a Mexican dinner and none of my guests loved it. The dressing gave it an unappealing brownish color and the apple cider vinegar overpowered the other flavours.

My husband loves this dish, and it keeps for days. I rinse the rice after it's cooked to get the starch off. I also add one bunch chopped cilantro and a cup or so of frozen sweet corn, rinsed and thawed, a must in my book. Go a little heavy on the seasoning and then it won't be bland. This is such a great, make-ahead side dish for summer barbecues.

Rating: 2
I seem to be one of the few dissenters. While I thought this was easy and pleasant tasting, I also found it uninteresting and fairly bland. It could probably benefit from the addition of parsley or cilantro and I would prefer more beans or less rice. It's important not to overcook the rice.

Rating: 3
I used only 1/4 C. olive oil and added corn. I used lime juice instead of vinegar, which I don't recommend as it makes it a bit bland. It needs some time for the flavors to blend, then it's a very pleasing salad with colors and textures.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I made this for a party, and two people asked me for the recipe. I added canned corn and slightly more cumin and garlic. I cut the oil in half, and it was still as moist as could be. It doubles well and is just as yummy day 3 as it was on day 1. Great for advance cooking and big crowds.

I made this salad to go to 2 outdoor bar-b-q's one weekend. After reading the other reviews; I doubled the recipe; except for the dressing, to which I added about 1 1/2 tbsps honey and a little more cumin than called for. Added fresh cooked corn, orange peppers instead of yellow, basmati rice instead of long grain, and 1 bunch of cilantro leaves. Didn't have enough green onion so I diced some red onion. Wow excellent!! Great Picnic/Bar-B-Q salad. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this dish several times since it first appeared in Bon Appétit in 1997. I recommend substituting honey for olive oil, but reduce the proportion because honey is sweeter.

This recipe leaves an oily taste. I realized that I have made a better recipe. Use no oil at all and substitute fresh lime juice for the vinegar. One lime works for me. Add more cumin and garlic. Try substituting V8 juice for half the water when you cook the rice. Definitely add freshly cooked corn and plenty of cilantro.

Absolutely wonderful...I made it last nite, and it was still partially warm when I served it alongside peppercorn pork tenderloin. Very good! I substituted orange bell pepper for the yellow, and added crispy sweet corn. I also substituted a hot'n'sweet mustard for the dijon to add a bit of sweetness to it, as well as an extra clove of garlic and the dressing was excellent.

Rating: 4
I've been making this wonderful salad for a while and have made some small changes to the original recipe. Instead of yellow bell pepper, I put a can of crispy sweet corn in (tastes like fresh corn). And sometimes, instead of just a red bell pepper, I'll add roasted red bell pepper. And finally, I always use a lot of chopped fresh parsley. This is a great recipe and makes excellent leftovers.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I literally could not believe how easy this recipe was to make, especially after I took a bite! I agree with other reviewers who thought it tasted even better the next day, cold or hot. I served this salad with grilled sea bass and a peach/avocado salsa...delicious!

This was very good and a big hit at a potluck party I took it to. I used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar and added more garlic (as another reviewer had recommended), an extra clove or so. I also added two good-sized pinches of sugar. It is beautiful, healthy and delicious. Best the next day or later.

Great recipe! It has become one of my barbeque/potluck mainstays. To the recipe, however, I add one much of chopped cilantro, more cumin, and about two cups of frozen or fresh corn.

Really, really easy and incredibly tasty. I used brown rice instead of white (for added nutrition and texture). Used 2 entire large peppers (about twice as much as the recipe calls for), and there was definitely sufficient dressing. Had leftovers a week later, and the salad tasted as good as the first day, if not better.

This was lovely to look at, but it needed more zip. Adding more cumin helped as did letting the dressing infuse the rice for awhile. Next time I will try adding cilantro as another reviewer suggested.

Use as many different colored peppers for presentation pizazz. I use slightly less than the full amount of dressing. And,I like to add some chopped cilantro, too. The dish is substantial enough to be a brown-bag lunch.
