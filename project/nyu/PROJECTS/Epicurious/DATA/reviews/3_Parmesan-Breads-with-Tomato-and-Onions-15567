Would make this again only using different toppings. Thought the onion and tomato did not pair well. Will use roasted tomatoes with garlic and herbs next time.

Good recipe but is a little time consuming. I only used 1 onion.It was difficult to make a 'depression' in the bread dough so the tomato really sits on top. The oven rack should be in the top third of the oven because the bottom got nicely browned but the tomato wasn't baked enough.

What a wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing. I love Rhodes Frozen Bread Dough it is the closest to homemade. YUM!

I knew this was going to be a good, tasty and easy recipe (saved it from the issue 2 years ago!)I have always been afraid of making dough from scratch so this was super! Had only one onion and it came out fine. Used extra cheese and herbs as suggested. A keeper for picnics, etc.

Too much onion,more cheese needed. However, the Parmesan and red peppers in the dough were elemental to the taste.When I make it again, I will chop the onion finer, more herbs and cheese. Good experience for making a flatbread of sorts.
