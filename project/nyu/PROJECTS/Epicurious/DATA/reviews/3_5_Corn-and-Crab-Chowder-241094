Made this today and it was delish!! Next time I will double the recipe so I can have some left overs. I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes that gave this soup a nice kick!

Delicious and easy. I doubled it and served it with bread and salad as dinner for four. Needed to add a good bit of salt - reviewers who thought recipe was bland probably didn't add enough. None was called for (hate that!) and it needed a good bit. The fresh ginger was worth it - really gave it a crisp, fresh and unique taste.

The best corn chowder recipe I have found. I rate is a 11 on a scale of 1 to 10 - plus very easy to make.

I enjoyed this chowder very much. I did pan-fry some celery and onion alongside the crab meat, for some extra flavor and texture. This was definitely a chowder, with all the accompanying texture, and not a smooth bisque. But the flavor was very nice and balanced.

Easy, fast & filling.

If I could rate this recipe 1 1/2 forks I would. It is ok, but it's not good enough to make again. I made exactly as written, as dinner for two. We both really liked the crab garnish, but the soup base itself was lacking. There wasn't much flavor, and despite being pureed, the texture wasn't smooth enough. Maybe straining it would be better. But, all in all, just not good enough. I think we would have rather just eaten the crab plain.

This chowder made a satisfying meal with a few minor variations. I added one medium finely diced white potato and let it cook with the white parts of the green onion in the clam juice before adding the corn and milk. I also used dried ginger instead of fresh and only a teaspoon of lemon juice. I pureed only half of the pot leaving a few chunks. The chowder was served with a leafy green salad for dinner. The chowder was good enough to add to the rotation.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The lemon and ginger added a little something extra to make it just a bit different than other chowders I've had. Please everyone try it out!!

Took a couple of clues from other reviewers and sauteed corn & crab in leftover bacon fat which I also crumbled and added to toppings. I used 2%milk,fresh ginger, and more crab than called for but still felt something was missing for depth of flavor. Might try again using homemade chicken stock instead of clam juice or possibly a mix of both. Felt it is a good solid recipe but could use a little tinkering to make better.

Very tasty and easy. Some changes I will make next time are to have more corn to make it thicker so that the topping sits nicely on top of the soup. I would also add some fresh green onions to the topping. I served it with avocado and it was a lovely compliment. Everyone enjoyed this soup and I will likely make it again.

I'd been looking forward to making this recipe since I first saw it in January. It was simple and delicious, I did however mix the garnish into the soup right away.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. For additional color, I sautéd 1/4 cup of red pepper for 3 minutes before adding the corn, then garnished the soup with a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley.

Great chowder. The FRESH ginger really gives it the finishing touch and makes the chowder extra special!

My family and I loved this recipie. I had a little extra crab so I added that and would do that again next time.

This soup was amazing. I did a couple of things differently, but not sure it made any major impact. I cooked the bacon (which was phenomenal) sauted the onions and ginger , deglazed the pot with a little white wine, added the other ingredients and then used my hand blender to puree. The whole soup took no time at all...but I would double it next time.

Recipe did not make large portions and I found the price of ingredients expensive compared to the amount of chowder it actually made.

I wanted to give this 4 forks becuase it was really very good. Three forks is delicious and that's what this soup was - delicious! I did not stray from the recipe and like another reviewer, I might consider adding some heat (japalenos) next time. I used skim milk so this one is VERY healthy and good. I will defnitely make it again.

this is a quick week night recipe...I varied it by cooking crispy bacon and sauteeing in some of the bacon fat. yeah sure not as healthy but a fully taste base and then crumbled bacon into the chowder.

I didn't care for this recipe. I thought there was too much clam juice and ginger... just not how a traditional chowder tastes. Will stick with my corn, crab, and bacon chowder recipe.

I made this for some company. It was super easy and really tasty. I would definitely recommend it. Though I might get a little creative next time, I feel that it is still a good dish without deviation

I was dissappointed with this recipe. I found it very bland (and I used extra fresh ginger) so I added some chilli flakes and a stock cube. My husband loved it but I'd think twice about making this again. However in the recipe's defence, I used regular corn because I could not find white corn.

Rating: 4
Both my husband and I loved this chowder. I followed the recipe to the letter. It tastes rich and creamy without the cream - actually is lowfat if you use 1% milk. Next time I will try a little jalapeno before blending for some heat. Also, think it would be good and a bit more economical with sauteed bay scallops, in place of the crab.

I made this for my boyfriend and he did not love it. It was very simple to make, but the recipie is not great. There is one flavor that overpowers the soup; he thinks it's the lemon, I think it's the clam juice. Anyway, don't waste your time on this ho-hum recipe.

This soup is good, but not great. I will try it again in summer with fresh corn (and use whole milk). It is quick to make, though...

This was pretty good. I thought the green onion and ginger were a bit overpowering so I will reduce a bit next time. The soup did not hold well on the stove - maybe the lemon juice - it started to separate. I will make it again with some minor adjustments.

Although it's always a little irritating to read reviews that deviate from the recipe, particularly when it leads to a negative review, I had to make a change or two: jarred ground ginger paste (grocery store had no roots) and I used whole milk as I had it on hand. Also, I used an immersion blender. That said, this chowder got raves and was a true crowd pleaser on a winter night, and one recipe I will make this summer using fresh corn and serving cold. It was a perfect introduction to the crabcakes and popovers that followed. I doubled the recipe and it yielded 7 cups. Easy, elegant, great taste, texture, and presentation. A keeper.

Shopeg Corn in this recipe is also great ,One of the best chowder recipes i have seen and made 4 forks for sure!!

This one rocks! I love corn soup and I've made every recipe I can find including Ina Garten's and this is a fantastic version. It's simple to make, especially if you have an immersion blender. I was apprehensive about the clam sauce and the ginger, but what's interesting is that you don't taste them in this recipe. The onion, ginger and clam sauce all blend together to create this magnificent flavor. I used backfin crab (that's all they had). If you don't want to make the crab part, just make the soup. It's awesome all on its own.

I made this and it was simple and delicious. Instead of using crab I added raw shrimp and cooked them right in the chowder for about 4 minutes before serving. I also added some fresh chopped cilantro and a splash of sherry as I removed it from the stove.

I made this soup as a first course for Christmas dinner and it was a HIT! I was a bit afraid of the ginger as my guests aren't big ginger fans, but everyone loved it. It would be great without the crab too! Really easy to make too - especially if you have one of those hand "blender" sticks - you can just puree it in the pot you make it in. I will definitely make this again.

I hate to write a bad review but this is not a good soup. Considering crab is not cheap, I felt the need to advise others not to make this soup. I followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out like a chowder. It might be too much clam juice but something needs to be changed to make it creamier and tastier.

Very easy - we couldn't find lump crab so substituted 8 oz chopped, sauteed fresh prawns; I like a lot more lemon than my husband, so I just added an extra splash to my bowl...

I had to use canned crab, and we threw it out. Progresso's corn chowder beat this hands down...

I brought this to a party and it was perfect. Instead of clumping the crab mixture in the middle, I mixed it in with the soup. Will definitely make again.
