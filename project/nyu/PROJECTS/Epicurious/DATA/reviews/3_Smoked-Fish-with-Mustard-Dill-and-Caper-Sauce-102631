Start with 1/2 of the sugar in the sauce, and add more if you see fit. I thought it was just a little too sweet.Nice combo of all the flavors that we love with smoked fish, though.

Nice presentation,the sauce is good, fits well with a put together table fare. Holiday table perhaps.

I wasn't sure about this dip (I thought it would be too sweet), but based on the rave reviews, I decided to try it. I made this for a large party and a number of guests loved it. To serve the smoked fish, I lined a large platter with fresh dill, rolled my lox into rosettes and placed around the outside edge of the platter, arranged the smoked fish in center, and topped with giant caper berries (about two inches long, plus an inch-long stem). There was a nice visual continuity with the taste of the sauce.

My husband likes to smoke his own salmon, and I've finally found a sauce that matches perfectly. Made this for a party, and everyone said it was a "keeper". I like the fact that the sauce has a lot of sugar in it, which balances the tangy flavor of the mustard and compliments smoked salmon nicely.

The sauce is great with all kinds of smoked fish, I've served it accompanying a platter of smoked salmon, smoke trout and smoked whitefish (all store bought at my local Costco) and it's quite an impressive appetizer platter.

The sauce is extremely versatile with a nice bite that works with both smoked salmon and smoked trout. I have used it as a straight dipping sauce, and also diluted as a salad dressing for a smoked fish salad as a summer main.
