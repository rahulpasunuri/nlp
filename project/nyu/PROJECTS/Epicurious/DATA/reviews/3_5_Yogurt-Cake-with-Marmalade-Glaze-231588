I doubled lemon zest, and added 1 tablespoon of juice. It has good taste, but for next time I am going to use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of butter.

This is such a quick and easy recipe, excellent outcome for minimal effort. I've made it several times using TJs goat milk yogurt, but last night also added sliced almonds and dried cherries to the batter. This added a lovely additional texture and multiplied the flavor immensely. You could add any kind of chopped nut or dried fruit to kick this up.

I make this simple cake over and over again. I always have the ingredients on hand, and it is a fabulous go-to. Tastes very classic and traditional, everyone loves it. I skip the marmalade - it's great on its own. Quick and yummy!

I added half a lemon's yield of lemon juice to the cake batter and used kumquat marmalade for the glaze. The cake was great and I loved the moist texture, but I think 50 minutes is way too long for it to be in the oven. I checked on it after 43 minutes and it was a little over browned at that point. I think 35-40 minutes would be more suitable.

All the positive reviews made me overly optimistic and I decided to make extra for friends too. I followed the recipe exactly and while it puffed up nicely and looked very promising, the cake had a really awful gummy texture with no crumb. I guess I should have known better since it has no butter. Not recommended.

Delicious! I used non-fat Greek yogurt and reduced the amount of oil (extra virgin olive oil) to 1/4 cup and it turned out wonderfully. Next time, I'd add more lemon zest to enhance the lemon-ness of the cake.

Made this cake exactly as written- though I read reviews before hand. I think the key here is the yogurt you use. I love Greek yogurt but it is too thick and creamy for this. I used Hawthorne Valley Farm whole milk organic and it turned out terrific. If you want tangy you need to use a yogurt that is tangy.

Really tasty, I used 2% fat greek yogurt, and between 1/3 and 1/2 cup of oil. It did take a little longer than 50 mins for the tester to come out clean. Used a grapefruit marmalade that was a little bitter, next time I would use lemon glaze in place of the marmalade.

substituted two individual servings of vanilla yogurt (about 1 1/2 cups) for the amount of yogurt + the oil. turned out great, however would recommend adding a tad more flour as the very top middle had a hard time baking. otherwise, great cake to eat for breakfast with blackberry preserves and tea. would definitely make it again!

Rating: 4
As many others, I cut the oil by half, didn't have any lemon peel, so omitted that, used a marmalade of cumquat and tangerine I had on hand, and poured it on when the cake was still warm, so the glaze penetrated farther, making the first half inch even moister. The texture of this cake is wonderful -- solid, but moist. And easy!

Rating: 2
Not bad, but not great either. I thought it was too heavy and oily, and the tang of the yogurt got totally lost. I prefer a more classic version of this cake--Chocolate and Zucchini blog has a good recipe. (Very similar but uses only 2 eggs and 1/3 c oil, but 2c flour, which makes a big difference, apparently.)

I didn't have yogurt so I used creme fraiche and the cake turned out delish. I inadvertently used 1/3 cup of oil (must have remembered it from the reviews), and I have to say it turned out great. It is super easy, I just kept folding in the oil (canola) until I could no longer see it. I love that it uses things we regularly have in the house and I don't have to soften the butter. I did look like it would overflow from the 8inch loaf pan but in the end it was fine.

I've made this cake several times, badly wanting to like it, but even with a number of modifications, the texture of the cake still throws me off. It does turn out dense, given the proportion of fat to liquid in the recipe. Draining water out of the yogurt for a hour or so does improve the consistency of the final product. Also, I've never heard of "folding in" oil into a batter, Instead, beat the eggs and sugar until thick and lemon coloured, and whisk in the oil in a steady stream until incorporated.

Rating: 2
I learnt from my overflow disaster the first time and made this in a 9" pan the 2nd time round. It was the perfect size. I beat the oil in a steady stream after whisking the eggs and sugar: I'd never heard of folding in oil into batter, which may have caused it to separate, as other reviewers described. Despite this, I too found the cake a touch greasy - I may reduce the oil to 1/3 or 1/4 c next time. Also, I added the juice and zest of 2 limes, which gave it a nice tang. Overall, a simple, homey and comforting cake.

I used half olive oil and half grapeseed oil, and since I only had non-fat yogurt I substituted a couple of tbsps of yogurt with creme fraiche. It was delicious. A keeper, like every Dorie Greenspan's recipe I've tried so far.

This cake is simple and delicious. For those of you that find it greasy--you are not folding in the oil thoroughly enough. I usually whisk mine with the eggs and yogurt before adding the dry ingredients. The texture is moist and a bit spongy. It's not meant to be low-fat or a pound cake, but an easy pantry cake that is very popular in France. You can also replace 1/2 cup of the flour with ground almonds for a delicious variation. And use whole milk yogurt! Eat some fruit if low fat is your goal.

Rating: 3
This cake turned out very well. I did what other users have said and used only 1/3 cup of oil. I also used half whole fat and half low fat...may try all low fat next time just to see how it turns out. Did not even bother with the glaze as it came out great without it. I am thinking this would be lovely with fresh peaches as well.

This was a very good cake. It was very moist and dense. I cooked this in pop-over molds, so that I could have individual little cakes for my guests. It worked well. Also, with the marmalade glaze, it was too sweet. This cake is good by itself, but I did add a dollup of creme de fraise on the top of each little cake. That was really nice. I also added about two teaspoons of lemo juice.

Too dense and bland. Sure, it's healthier than butter based pound cake, but with all that sugar not enough so to bother making again.

This cake was unbelievable! It was exceptionally moist and delicious. I also used 1/3 cup of oil like other users, and instead of regular yogurt, I used low fat greek vanilla yogurt. Additionally, I had no marmalade so I used black currant preserves and it was absolutly decadent! I will make this cake again and again!

I also decreased the oil to 1/3 cup. I had no eggs handy so I substituted boxed egg replacer, which made the cake extra fluffy. The recipe proved surprisingly flexible, and also took well to my substitution of vanilla sugar for plain. The cake was very easy to make with on-hand ingredients & is an excellent way to use up leftover yogurt (especially older homemade yogurt). The cake baked nicely in two nonstick mini loaf pans in 40 minutes. I made the marmalade as this cooked, which made the glaze flavors very fresh & punchy.

Fantastic cake. I reduced the oil by half and used reduced fat greek yogurt.

Bought some fresh blackberry syrup from my local farmer's market this morning and, lacking vanilla ice cream to pour it over, dashed to my computer to find the quickest, easiest, lowest fat cake recipe possible. I tried this one. My 8 year old son and I threw it in the oven in about 5 minutes flat, using white whole-wheat pastry flour and non- fat yogurt. It baked while we dined, and it was WONDERFUL! - as well as the blackberry syrup! For vegetable oil I used canola... I'll use this recipe often!

I tried this recipe before reading any of the reviews, but made modifications similar to those made by other cooks, ie using non-fat yogurt. I also substituted spelt and whole-wheat flour for the white. Although this cake does not mimic the density and texture of a pound cake, it is a great cake. I'll probably reduce the oil next time as well, per other suggestions. Definitely a must-have basic cake recipe.

I have made this several times with a few modifications - I use nonfat yogurt, cut oil to 1/3 cup, and vary lemon and orange zest with whatever is on hand -- i find it delicious and gets better after a day or so. Haven't had any of the problems that others have had. I love it because I always have the ingredients on hand.

As a pastry chef with 30 + years experience and a big fan of Dorie Greenspan, I have to say I really am disappointed in this cake. I followed it exactly. Her recipes are always right on the mark- well tested. Maybe its a mistake? Has the magazine responded to this? I plan on writing in. It did seem odd to add that much oil but I continued on with the recipe. It was greasy and a sponge brick as others have said. What I can't understand is that there are over 52 reviews with such varied scores. No one seemed to mention that it did not look anything like the photo that accompanies the recipe.

I made this recipe with some low fat substitutions and it still turned out excellent. I used non-fat yogurt, 1/4 cup oil, 1 egg and three egg whites. Used zest of one orange and didn't have any marmalade so made a glaze with leftover orange juice and icing sugar. Really delicious. And it looks great sliced with the dark brown edges and the flecks of bright orange inside. I would love to try this recipe with any citrus fruit - lime, lemon, grapefruit, tangerine...

The first time I made this it was too greasy so I used 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil this time, which I folded in very slowly. I also used greek whole milk yogurt and the zest from one orange. It was a little taste of Crete.

taking the advice of other reviewers, i reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and i used orange zest instead of lemon, omitted the vanilla and used 0% fat greek style yogurt. i then did a simple syrup with 1 tbsp sugar and 2 tbsp orange juice instead of the marmalade. i thought it was yummy, light and very versatile. i would certainly make it again.

I have made this cake at least 8 times. When I couldn't find whole milk yogurt at my local grocer, I used sour cream instead and it came out GREAT. Even at high altitude, no adjustments were necessary. The recipe makes one nice loaf, perfect for slicing. I like that it is not overly sweet, and has a firm texture, but not exactly pound cake. It's even good without the marmalade. I used this recipe for cupcakes with a simple lemon frosting and gave to a friend for her birthday. Everyone always asks for the recipe.

It's misleading to call this a pound cake. I had the expectation that it would be a tea cake and it exceeded that expectation. I used lemon juice instead of lemon peel, lowfat organic yogurt, and lemon curd instead of the marmalade. 4 days later and it's still wonderfully moist and tasty. I'll try the 1/3 cup of oil suggestion for the next time.

I really liked the simplicity of this recipe when I first read it--the thought of being able to throw a yummy cake together when you have all the ingredients on hand on any given day sounded great to me. I read some of the reviews and decided to substitute the whole milk yogurt for non-fat plain yogurt, cut the oil in half, used an entire lemon's worth of peel and apricot-peach preserves for the glaze. The cake came out moist, even lower in fat than the recipe originally intended and absolutely delicious. I will make this recipe over and over again. What a nice addition it would make to an elegant brunch menu.

We loved this cake - it's moist and flavorful and has a nice texture. I didn't bother with the glaze, but instead served it with a strawberry-rhubarb compote, which was very pretty and the flavors were complimentary. I made two changes to the recipe - first, I combined the oil with the other wet ingredients so did not fold it in at the end (not deliberate, a result of not reading the procedure carefully) and second, baked it a bit longer than indicated. Like another reviewer, I didn't measure the lemon peel but just used the peel of one lemon. I think I'll try Meyer lemon peel in the future.

Rating: 3
This is a great cake to make when you've forgotten to take out the butter to soften, and its really quick and easy. I admit to having made a few changes-only had lowfat vanilla yogurt, which I drained of extra liquid and mixed with sour cream. Reduced sugar by 1/4 cup to compensate for sweetened yogurt, and bagged the lemon zest, substituting 1 teaspoon of vanilla. It did take a while to fold in the oil, and reducing it a little could be a good idea in the future. No glaze-served it with whipped cream and strawbs, and it was a big hit.

I'm surprised this cake has gotten such mixed reviews, because I've made it nearly every week since it was published, and think it's incredibly good, and so does everyone who has tasted it. Maybe the key is to use really top quality ingredients. I use organic plain yogurt by Erivan and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I found some great locally produced pink grapefruit marmelade for the topping! The cake is easy, moist and delicious!

I have also made this cake three times since the recipe came out. Everyone loved it. I didn't use whole milk yogurt, but it was organic (which I find tastes creamier). The last time I made the cake I used buttermilk instead of the yogurt, but I found the result to be rather rubbery. I have never added the marmalade topping. It is delicious as it is and the texture reminds me of a pound cake.

Rating: 2
Acceptable but not out-of-this world cake. I did not find it necessary to use whole-milk yogurt and a full half-cup of oil. I used low-fat yogurt and more like a third of a cup of oil, and the cake was still moist and rich. Otherwise, I skipped the zest and glaze in favor of orange flavoring. The smell and taste were good, and it was certainly easy to make, but I have other cake recipes in the pound cake family that I prefer.

I've made this three times and its come out great each time. I substituted 1tsp of almond extract for the lemon zest the last time I made it and then served it with strawberries that I soaked in amaretto and with whipped cream. yummy. I think its pretty important to use whole milk yogurt-- i used the kind that has a layer of cream on the top.

I've made this recipe three times. One time I even forgot the eggs and then it was very greasy but edible. The third time I made it I didn't have enough lemon zest because of the second time forgetting the egg debaucle so I added a tsp of almond extract. It came out perfect too. This is a great cake recipe and very easy and quick. I agree with the other comments that you must use whole milk yogurt.

This cake is one in which I make time and time again. It has turned out perfectly each and every time. The versatility of this recipe makes it very appealing. Serve it with or without the glaze, with sweetened whipped cream or fresh fruit on the side. It makes a terrific week-night dessert with left-overs being a quick breakfast or snack. The negative reviews surprise me. The whole milk yogurt could indeed be the key or maybe it's the FOLDING in of the oil. I will definitely continue to make it. It has been a very reliable dessert for me.

Thankfully, I made this cake before reading any of the reviews. Had none of the problems associated below. The taste was terrific, texture/crumb was excellent and it was perfectly moist. It also freezes very well. Perhaps whole milk yogurt (instead of low fat - which is most available) is the key.

I am truly shocked by all the tepid and negative reviews of this cake. I was pleased to make this on a weeknight as I had all the ingredients on hand. I found the cake neither greasy nor bland and I followed the instructions to a T except I too used the zest of one lemon (who bothers to measure freshly grated zest?) and nonfat yogurt. Because this came out of the oven late at night, I let it cool overnight loosely covered with wax paper. The next morning I was a bit concerned because the the sides and bottom felt dry. But I added the marmalade glaze, let it set while I got ready for work, and then I wrapped it in foil to transport, since I had no appropriately sized container. I was BLOWN AWAY by how delicious this cake is, and I rate it 4 forks because 1) it's simple yet impressive (the point of the article in the magazine) and 2) I want to counter all of these negative reviews! ;-)

Simple and easy to make. It's a nice mid-morning treat with a cup of tea. I doubled the amount of lemon peel but used less sugar and oil (about 1/2 of what was called for) and also used fat free yogurt.

I disagree with the negative reviews. This was a moist, subtly-flavored pound cake. I think the whole milk yogurt makes all the difference in the world, even though it may not always be easy to find. (Stonyfield makes a plain whole milk yogurt.) It was definitely not a child's cake - it wasn't all that sweet. And yes, when it first comes out of the oven it is ever-so-slightly greasy but it gets better as it cools and is gone by the next day.

Based on prior reviews, I used lemon yogurt (and decreased the sugar) as well as cut down the oil. My daughter says it's like eating a sponge!

A very lovely alternative to pound cake laden with butter. The whole milk yogurt gave a light, moist texture to this.

This was excellent, although this is more of a tea bread than a cake. I didn't have whole milk yogurt, but I used a container of lemon low-fat yogurt and it was wonderful. Perhaps for dessert you can top with lemon curd or soft, sweetened whip cream and rasberries. It's a keeper.
