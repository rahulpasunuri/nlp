Delicious! I'm wondering if the reason some reviewers said they barely had enough of the broth/water mixture was because of the size of the pot/pan they used. I used a 4.2 qt. Emile Henry pot, and the risotto cooked, and turned out, exactly as the recipe described - I even had leftover broth mixture just as the directions said one would. I only had large shrimp so I added an extra minute of cooking to make sure they were cooked through (I added the shrimp at the 17 minute mark). I will definitely be making this again, and again. Do try this recipe. It's so incredibly good!!

This dish was delicious! I did almost run out of the broth mixture. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. My family loved it! My children even liked the asparagus. I don't know how anyone can think this dish was bland. That isn't possible. Will continue to make.

Make sure you have a fresh lemon for the zest! First time I made this I didn't have one and cheated with a little bottled lemon juice, and it was just okay. Agree with other reviewers who cut down on the amount of butter. I ended up using a bit more broth than recipe specified. Also, I put the shrimp shells in it to simmer for added flavor (remove them of course before adding to risotto!) I also cut the shrimp into halves because I was worried about them cooking through -- this worked great and made for more bites of shrimp throughout the dish.

This is a great risotto recipe. I barely had enough stock, as others have mentioned, but the 5 cups of liquid were just enough. I also left out the 2 Tbsp butter at the end -- the risotto was plenty creamy enough without it. So good!

Warm, creamy, cheesey goodness. I went a little heavier on the lemon zest and all was well. I have made this before and I will keep making it. Nummy!

Sorry traditionalists, I just like cheese in my risotto. But I do make my own veggie stock, which helps. I precook shrimp with lots of garlic and red pepper - because we love both! If a recipe looks bland, instead of making it to a tee and disliking it, do what you know you like! Advantage of being a home cook. We like this recipe, very adaptable.

We thought this was one of the best risotto recipes we have made. For once I followed the recipe almost 100% (substituted the asparagus for minted green baby peas). I too found I needed just a bit more stock, but I think that can be expected.I really liked that the shrimps cooked in the risotto just at then end kept a really good shrimp flavour, it was an outstanding dish and can hardly wait until spring for fresh asparagus.

Rating: 1
i added red bell peppers and mushrooms, as recommended by others. i don't understand how so many delicious ingredients can go into a dish and turn out bland, but that's exactly what happened. i was very disappointed after seeing all the great reviews on this dish. mushroom risotto has a fraction of the ingredients and 10x the flavor.

I have made this many times--never with parmigiano--what a horror with shellfish. One reviewer used orzo?? Are they joking? no wonder it didn't work. poor thing! this is great dish as is minus the P-R cheese. tweaking stock/water/white wine is personal. Rose wine? ewwww

So delicious! It took longer than expected, and risotto is always touchy towards the end, but it tasted great anyway. I used chopped sauteed chicken breast seasoned with lemon and black pepper instead of shrimp, and omitted the lemon from the risotto itself. A great weeknight dinner! Didn't need to go shopping for ingredients.

Made it this weekend and it was a hit! I found it takes longer and uses more broth to get the right consistency. It was plenty rich, and you could cut the butter easily. Squeezed extra lemon at the table - yum!

I made this and it was great, although I will admit to a little modification. I didn't add the asparagus at all, and sauteed the shrimp in lots of garlic before serving it on top of the risotto.

Rating: 3
This was very good overall. It seemed to need more liquid though than the recipe called for...I had to add some extra broth towards the end to get it fully cooked. Also, I actually sauteed the shrimp in a separate pan and then just served the risotto with the shrimp on top...seemed a little tastier that way. Last, the lemon was very subtle...I might up the zest next time. Nonetheless, pretty yummy and had very few leftovers!

A great dish that I have made many times without any changes! I am making it once again tonight for dinner - yummmmmmm!

Delicious and easy to prepare. I used a shallot instead of an onion, added 3/4 cups of fresh peas, and parboiled them with the asparagus (in water, not broth). I used homemade broth and no water. Served 3 as a main course (big appetites) and will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! Prepared as written. Next time I may cut the butter in half or use half olive oil because it would be rich enough without it. I used half the amount of shrimp because that was what I had, and it was enough (though more would be wonderful!). Passed lemon to squeeze on at the table. Delicious!

Whoops..meant to say basil, not tarragon.

Worked out beautifully. Added sun-dried tomatoes as well which was a great addition.

I thought this was pretty good but I think I'll probably up the quantity of the add-ins like the parmesan and maybe the lemon zest, too. The previous reviewer mentioned the recipe's generous portions but I halved the recipe and ate it all on my own..maybe I just eat a lot.

Rating: 4
Yum! Very easy and made generous portions. I used Langostino and it turned out very well.

Rating: 4
The perfect risotto dish. I didn't have more than a 14 oz. can of chicken broth so I used an 8 oz. bottle of clam juice for the balance along with the 2 cups of water. Unlike the previous reviewer I had a small amount of broth left over at the end. Absolutely delicious and very easy. If you've never made risotto before, this is a great recipe to start with. Don't forget the lemon zest - great touch. Add a nice salad and you've got a perfect dinner.

Rating: 4
Served this with ribeye in a balsamic glaze - the whole meal was a hit. A few suggestions: You will need more than the broth recommended, even if you are diligent with keeping the lid on and simmering at very low heat. I used nearly 3 boxes of store-bought broth, which is typical for this much rice. I did not sear the shrimp, but might next time to give it is a little crispness and a different texture. Thin stalks of asparagus work better than fat ones. The ice water bath is key, otherwise they will overcook and be soggy. I think I nearly doubled the amount of parmesan cheese at the end. I finished this dish with some white truffle oil I had on hand, which I would highly recommend.

Delicious weeknight dinner recipe. Great flavors. Served five as a main course and not a bite remained for leftovers; everyone had seconds. Did not have lemon zest so splashed a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice at the end. Used cooked, frozen (thawed) shrimp. Topped with fresh grated parmesan; served with basic salad of field greens, artichokes, cukes and red peppers.

This was okay, but didn't really do it for me. It's my own fault for choosing a recipe whose flavors I questioned before even starting to make it, but c'est la vie. I found the combination of lemon, parmesan, asparagus and shrimp odd, and wouldn't make this again.

Gosh, this was good. Started the onions at the same time I put the broth on to boil; a big time-saver. Had an extra brussel sprout rattling around the fridge so I chopped that up and tossed it in. Pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to adjust the lemon/cheese proportions much. But, like virtually every recipe in my house, I dosed this up with some hot red pepper flakes. YUM.

OMG! Mouth in heaven, belly happy. This recipe is outstanding. I was really nervous about cooking orzo, since this was my first time, plus lots and lots of stirring (did it in dutch oven to be on the safe side). I think the trick to avoiding gloopy mess is adding the stock little by little (even if it looks mooshy when it's done, you might want to add extra stock to it after it sits since orzo will continue to expand even after you take it off the heat). So, yeah, it's a fussy recipe because of the nonstop stirring, but I am now in love with this dish. 4+++++ forks

I expected to love this but it was just okay. I guess I just don't love lemon in risotto and I like shrimp to always be garlic-y.

It was a big gloppy mess using expensive ingredients and very bland flavor.

I have made this a bunch of times, both with or without shrimp and it is always fantastic, and a crowd pleaser. If the constant stirring bugs you, you can use a pressure cooker. Follow the recipe exactly as written, after the wine is absorbed, add all the chicken broth and put the lid on and cook it under medium-high pressure for 10-12 minutes. After the pressure has gone, remove the lid and stir in the shrimp, parmesan and remaining ingredients. Voila!

So good so easy though lots of stirring. So it goes with risotto. I roasted the asparagus and added them warm to the mix to avoid overcooking which is key. I also used shrimp tails in the "Better than Boullion" stock. Nice midweek dinner. Didn't have wine but would have used had i had it.

This was very nice, loved the lemon. I did take the shirmp peels and ends of asparagus and boiled that up with the two cups of water, just trying to infuse more flavor. Used shallots, had no wine (just used water).

I thought this recipe was great for a weeknight dinner! Boiling the asparagus in the stock and cooking the shrimp right in the risotto really saved time. I'll admit that grilling the shrimp and roasting the asparagus might have upped the flavor, but part of the beauty of this recipe is the simplicity.

Rating: 3
With some tweaking (hence the 3 forks), this is fabulous. Inspired by previous reviewers, here's what I did: subbed 1 med. leek for the onion, added 8 oz.sliced mushrooms, added hot pepper flakes, subbed broth for water and increased wine to 3/4 cup, added juice of 1/2 lemon, increased cheese. OK, a lot of tweaks, but well worth it.

I thought this was very tasty! but I did end up using the zest of almost an entire lemon. I made it again as a side, without the shrimp, and it was still good. (Not as yummy, but only 'cause we love our shrimp!)

This recipe was just ok. I followed the recommendations by users to grill and sear the asparagus and shrimp, but we still ended up adding like 2x the parm just to get some flavor. I also substituted shallots for the onions. Ok - but not great.

This recipe feels incomplete. The flavor of the dish is completely bland, and under-seasoned! The risotto has a lemon essence but lacks any richness, and there is no cohesion with the asparagus or shrimp. Would not recommend this dish at all! The recipe on the arborro rice box for risotto was much better!!

Made it as is w/ the exception that I used lemon juice (1 1/2 Tablespoon) instead of lemon zest because I had a zested lemon in the fridge that I needed to use. Plenty of flavor and just simply delicious. I had to cook the rice a bit longer than called for until it was tender enough to eat. I wish I could have found some lobster meat like another cook suggested, but had to settled for shrimp. Definitively a do again

An unbelievably tasty conconction that takes little effort and looks scrumptious. I followed the recipe as given, adding a healthy dollop of red pepper flakes and fresh ground pepper, and parsley. Next time, I'm going to throw in some proscuitto. I nuked the leftovers for dinner the following night and it was just as good.

Kind of bland. I expected more of a kick from the lemon. Next time would add more lemon juice, the zest just doesn't zest enough.

Only had boxed chicken broth on hand and used that but substituted the 2 cups of water with home made lobster stock for added flavor. The resulting risotto was flavorful and creamy. Lobster is currently $4.99/lb here, so I added the meat of one chicken lobster to the shrimp called for. Since asparagus was only $1.99/lb this week, the recipe was actually quite economical to make. Will definitely make this one again.

This was my first time making risotto-although I frequently order it in restaruanuts-It was delicious and easy to make. I did sautee the shrimp in the butter before cooking the onions. I set the shrimp aside and then added them in at the end. It was interesting enough for me and main-stream and colorful enough to satisfy my school age children! Will definitely make again.

3.5 stars! It was fresh and spring-like with a bit of the comfort food feel. While ours did not turn out bland at all, I could imagine it doing so. In fact I am almost sure I made a similar recipe a few years ago and felt that way. Some of the things I thought might have made a difference were: 1. I used a high-quality chicken stock (not broth), not homemade alas. 2. I only had half a lemon to zest so I added lemon juice, about 2 TBSP. 3. I used my seasoned iron skillet to prepare the risotto. (I had just used it earlier to cook bacon in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rosemary, and a touch of garlic and only wiped it cleaned -- some of the residue was left on the pan. Hee hee, I can some cooks saying eeeuw, gross but this is the magic of a seasoned pan!)

Here are a couple of tips for no fail risotto if you want to make ahead. I also use about 3/4 c. Pecorino Romano for extra flavor. What I do is cook just until done, and then remove from stove top, add half the cheese. Immediately layer on a cookie sheet to stop cooking and to cool completely. When cooled you can put in a covered container in refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. When ready to serve add a little more broth and even a little wine, your remaining cheese and your fresh ingredients. I also ROAST the asparagus with olive oil and chopped garlic in oven at 450 degrees for about 10 min. I also cook shrimp in butter and olive oil with more garlic and a little lemon juice just before adding to risotto. NOTE: I chop asparagus into 1 in pieces. I also chop shrimp before adding, but you can keep whole. 4 stars with these additions!

I thought this was super duper good. My husband and I made this with halibut instead of shrimp and it was YUM! The hardest part for me is knowing when I should stop cooking the risotto/stop pouring in the broth. I think I overcooked it by 5 min or so cause it was little mushier than I would have liked but still SO good!

I agree with the "bland" comments. I think it needed more salt at the beginning (i.e. when the rice first goes in the pan) and some lemon juice at the end; maybe a bit more parmigiano too. I also thought the ratio of shrimp and asparagus to risotto was too high. A lot of work for a just OK result.

I made this with only 3/4 cup of Arborio rice and just a bit less shrimp and asparagus. I first cooked the shrimp in their shells in one cup of water, then scooped them out to peel. The juices that they left in the bowl went back into the pot with a can of chicken broth and as amsd suggested, a squeeze of lemon, then the asparagus. After I removed the asparagus, I followed the recipe. I did not have quite enough broth and added water as needed and did not find this bland at all. The flavors blended perfectly.

Alterations: Cook shrimp in 1 cup boiling water, remove with slotted spoon, set aside. Add chicken broth, bring to boil. Add juice of 1/2 lemon (or more according to taste), cook asparagus (I use a carrot pealer on them), remove with slotted spoon when aldente. proceed with recipe, then combine with parmeseam cheese and lemon zest. I did this and the lemon was just enough to make a creamy/cheesy risotto refreashing! Will make it forever...

I made this precisely as written and it was just OK given all the work involved in making risotto. The lemon flavor complemented the shrimp well but clashed with the parmesan. I will have to remember this recipe's method of blanching the asparagus, though -- the vegetables stayed nicely crisp. I love risotto but would not go to any trouble to make this again.

This combination of ingredients is AWESOME. I changed the procedure a little and made this in my rice cooker with 1 cup Arborio rice, 2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup water and 1/4 cup wine, some lemon juice, 1/2 the onion and 2 tbsp butter. I added the Parmesan once it was done. I made the shrimp and snap peas (in season here) with the onion in a skillet. My husband ate seconds and thirds.

I was dissapointed in this dish. It sounded so good and was well reviewed. My biggest problem is that it is sooo bland! Barely any lemon flavor and the addition of water to the stock made it even more tasteless. Also, cooking times are way off once the the shrimp is added. After 3 minutes the shrimp were still raw, which meant the risotto was starting to stick to the pan, which meant I had to add more stock. I am going to think about this one before I make it again....
