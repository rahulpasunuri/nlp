I agree there is a mistake in the time and temp. I used this recipe for a sirloin roast however, and it was fabulous.

whoever cooked & rated this must love beef jerky. Luckily, I knew better than to cook that long. And why ruin a good steak baking it. Sear & grill.

Was not thrilled with the marinate results (marinated 12 hrs.) Will stick to simplified sear/grill and add herbs at finish.

This recipe has a great flavor, but I think it has a major mistake. If you roast a steak for 15 to 25 minutes at 400 degrees, it will be totally ruined -- especially grass fed beef. Unless it's very thick, it should take 6 to 12 minutes depending on how long it took to sear. If I were a beginner, I would have ruined an amazing tenderloin. Go by the thermometer alone on this one.

agree completely that the temp and time instructed make for overcoked beef. cook for no more than 10, then check it. Other than that, this is a wonderful recipe and the bean salad that goes with is a winner too.

Loved this. Used regular sirloin tip. It was so simple and so tasty.
