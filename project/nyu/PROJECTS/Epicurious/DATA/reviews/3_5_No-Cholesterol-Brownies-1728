I didn't follow the recipe precisely, substituted nannyberry puree for half the oil, used 2 whole eggs (instead of egg whites). When I mixed it all together, the batter was so dry that I had to add almost a full cup of water to make it more like the brownie batter. It tasted very good before I baked it. After baking, though, the brownies came out kind of puffy and cake-like, and not chocolatie at all, though they were nice and moist. If I make this recipe again (which I doubt), I'll have to put lots of chocolate chips into the batter.

Two years later, this is my go-to recipe. I omit the walnut, use 2 eggs (instead of 4 egg whites), add a Tb of espresso or coffee, & a handful of choc chips. Sometimes, to cut the fat, I sub 1/2 applesauce for the oil, and you can't tell the difference at all! They are perfect, easy & I always have the ingredients on hand. A big hit every time I make them :)

I was actually looking for a dairy free dessert, because of allergies & stumbled across this one... it turned out to be great! I made a few small changes: used 2 eggs whites & 1 whole egg, and also added a disc of Mexican hot chocolate (the Abuelita brand doesn't contain milk products). It added a great cinnamon flavor, and a little more chocolaty richness. Also, I forgot to use nuts. Overall, it was a great brownie that didn't taste low-fat (or dairy free!) :) I will use this recipe again!

I should also add that I used Dutch-processed cocoa because it's sweeter and the the leavening is baking powder (and I don't want a "fluffy" brownie anyway). Also, I weigh cocoa powder since it's very difficult to get a consistant volume measurement. 1 cup cocoa powder = 90 grams so 67.5 grams for this recipe.

Excellent! Almost as good as my favorite high-fat brownie recipe. To make this recipe even more healthful, I substituted 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 2 tablespoons oil and 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed for the oil and egg whites and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.

Nice Brownie, good flavor, still gotta remember control and portion when you have these sitting on the counter and ice cold milk is just a step away!! Man its hard!!

I made these brownies for a last minute party and they were a HUGE hit. No one would have ever guessed they were cholesterol free. The bake time listed in the recipe is way too short though. I ended up baking them for 50 minutes and they were still a tiny bit gooey, but it was the good kind of gooey.

I changed this recipe slightly. Instead of eggs I used 2 tablespoons of flax seed meal and 6 tablespoons of water. I also used mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. It turned out beautifully! Both my husband and I enjoyed them. This recipe has definately been added to my box.

This recipe was a hit with my coworkers - sweet and chocolatey - even with 1/3 less oil than the recipe called for. I also used 1 cup organic sugar and 1/2 cup rapadura for the sugar part of the recipe. I didn't have the problems the others had with the top separating, or the brownies falling apart. Consistency was fudgey and gooey, though. Not necessarily a bad thing. They did hold together. Next time though I'll cook them a little longer.

Try adding toasted hazelnuts and chopped chocolate(good-quality)-phenomenal! I bring these to work, and they vanish everytime.

I originally made this recipe years ago when I had my parents over for dinner, who both watched their cholesterol. They are now the only brownies I ever make - dense, chocolately, and I can feel good knowing that they contain only egg whites and a little oil. by the way, I think they work very well with less oil - a little more than half that the recipe calls for. I make them for company as well as the family - they freeze great.

My husband absolutely loves these brownies. Not only because there is no cholesterol, but the taste is great. I've made these for dessert for guests and I get the same reviews.

Okay if you are absolutely positively trying to avoid all cholesterol. But if you are just trying to watch your weight or eat healthy, you are better off not making these.

I was not impressed with the flavor or texture of these brownies. I did substitute applesauce for most of the oil, so perhaps that had something to do with the poor results. In any case, next time I do "light" brownies I'll just by the "No Pudge" brand box mix. Much tastier.

My husband liked these better than I did, but I think what he really liked was the idea that they were "no-cholesterol" . We didn't have a problem with the top separating, or with the cooking temperature at 350, but the top was almost crispy. All told, this isn't anything special.

The flavor of these was wonderful--perhaps some of the best brownies I've ever tasted. However, I had two major problems. First, I baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and they were nearly raw. I wound up having to bake them much longer than that; perhaps I could have alleviated this problem by setting the temp. at 375. Secondly, the brownies sort of fell apart--oddly, the top layer separated from the rest. Did anyone else have these problems???

These were really "chocolatey" and delicious! I used dutch-processed cocoa and followed the recipe as written with one exception: Instead of mixing the walnuts in the batter, I toasted them for a few minutes and then added them to some cocoa frosting, which I spread on the brownies after baking. Yum yum yum!

I really liked this recipe. I've made the applesauce variation twice now, and I've gotten excellent reviews, even from people who didn't know that the recipe was low-fat. The walnuts make quite a difference in the rich flavour and texture.

the best thing about this recipe was the fact that it was cholesterol-free! i suggest mixing rum and raisins and adding those instead of the walnuts. the apple sauce idea was great..i was glad not to be eating those extra calories!

Not the most spectacular brownies in the world, but they're pretty good for being healthy. As far as nutrition analysis goes, my recipe software returns the following figures to me: Calories: 205.5 Fat: 10.9 g Saturated Fat: 1.5 Cholesterol: 0 (But we knew that already) Carbs: 27.1 g Protein: 2.5 g Substituting applesauce for vegetable oil brings the calories down to 124.2 per serving, and fat down to 0.7 g.

Could the nutritional breakdown be available for each recipe?
