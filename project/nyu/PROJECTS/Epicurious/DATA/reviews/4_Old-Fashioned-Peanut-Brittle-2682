Just made this peanut brittle, it turned out beautifully - but when I added the peanuts/butter, I was worried because of how thick the peanuts made the sugar... but everything turned out!

This is a great and versatile recipe. It can move pretty quick at the end so be prepared.I line the cookie sheets with parchment paper and heat to prevent the mixture from cooling to quickly and for clean up I fill the cooking pan with water and boil it to release the harden brittle from pan and utensils.

This is a great recipe. If you don't have time to read all the reviews, let me add here what others wrote that I do that works. Butter the pans. When you add the nuts and butter, put the pans in a pre-heated 250 oven. That makes spreading the stuff, easier. I've only done this with salted cashews. Turns out great. Next time, I'm going to try this with pistachios.

My husband attempted to make this recipe today while I was out in the garden. All of a sudden I smelled smoke and turned around to look at the house. Smoke was pouring out of the windows. I rushed to the door and my husband was busy playing his Xbox game. Apparently he decided that once it was boiling he could just check on it again in 30 minutes. I grabbed the smoking pan and took it outside. The good news is I'm getting some new cookware! Perhaps a new candy thermometer is a good idea as well. Always an adventure in our kitchen. Cheers

My first try at peanut brittle and reading the reviews really helped make it quite painless. I halved the recipe because I didn't have an extra set of hands and I was worried about having to pour and spread at the same time. After the first batch -- which came out great -- I decided to try another but used less dark to light corn syrup. (With half recipe, 2 oz dark to 4 oz light). Both were good. Once you get the hang of it, the recipe is really easy. As everyone says, watch the thermometer and be prepared to MOVE at the end. After having successfully tackled this recipe, I pulled out Bullock-Prado's candy cookbook (which has been intimidating me from my bookshelf) and I tried her Aunt Sis' peanut brittle recipe, which substitutes brown sugar. Very different flavor and texture; more like cracker jack flavor and much more "brittle." I'm now on a roll and I can't wait to try poemrush's beer brittle version.

Great recipe. I've been making this for several holiday seasons now to rave reviews from all family and friends. After sampling a phenomenal beer/cayenne peanut brittle, I used this recipe as a base for creating my own. In case anyone else is interested in this excellent brittle interpretation, I did the following: Instead of 2 C water, I used 1.5C dark beer and 0.5C water. You MUST boil this beer/water first prior to adding the sugar. The beer has proteins in it that need to be dealt with. If you do not, be WARNED, your pot of sugar/beer/water will BOIL OVER, no joke! (Yes, this is experience talking here). So...as I was saying, boil your beer/water until it stops foaming incessantly and settles down into a nice calm pot. Once this happens (about 5 min), take it off the stove and remeasure it. Some liquid will have boiled off. Add water as necessary to bring it back up to the 2C mark. Proceed with the recipe as it is on Epicurious. At the end, I blend my baking soda with 1.5tsp cayenne and skip the vanilla. That's it. And the result is this wonderful wonderful malty-beer, sweet, hot mess that makes you want to eat the whole pan! Oh, additionally, I'm a firm believer in a generous amount of sea salt scattered over the batch immediately after pouring, before it's had a chance to cool. I really do think it needs the salt. I also use slightly salted nuts. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe and came out very well. Made a 1/2 recipe and did add some salt even though I was using roasted, salted peanuts. The sweet/salty combo is irresistible. You do have to move fast at the end as the candy starts to seize up and harden very fast as soon as it's off the heat. My cook times were much shorter as well - but if you keep an eye on it, it should be fine.

Rating: 4
Don't you just love a great recipe? I halved the ingredients and added 1 teaspoon of salt with the sugar, water and corn syrups. My cooking times were much less, since I was making a smaller batch. Poured onto a 16x12-inch silpat. Easy. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

I have made this many times to rave reviews! I always toss a little cayenne and cinnamon in with the peanuts (and be sure to get salted roasted peanuts). Make sure to use a LARGE pot for the sugar syrup, mine always threatens to boil over!

Rating: 4
Very nice, but DEFINITELY needs salt; I added about 1 tsp to the liquids. I also added one additional tbsp of butter as I like tender brittle. I noticed my mixture was starting to amber-brown by about 275 degrees, so I took it off the heat and stirred in the soda. I suspect a cheap candy thermometer is to blame for that rather than the recipe. On a dare from my co-workers (who are obsessed with all things bacon) I made this a second time as above, substituting one pound of crisply cooked and chopped bacon for one cup of the peanuts. Smokey-sweet and weirdly good!

I halved the recipe (but kept the 2C of peanuts) and it took less than 30 minutes for my sugar/water/corn syrup to reach 260. The last part of the process also went much faster than expected, and it got so sticky and hard to stir that I had to call in a strong sous-chef (my unsuspecting boyfriend) to help stir. I improvised with other ingredients at the end, and it worked out great.

Fantastic recipe. I've never made peanut brittle before. This is definitely a more advanced recipe, but it was very doable. Made a half recipe, and I only had light corn syrup so subbed that for the dark corn syrup and added a tiny bit (maybe half a Tbsp) of molasses for color. Went MUCH faster than the recipe says when making a half batch!

I made this as part of an assortment I selected from the epicurious.com "25 days of Christmas cookies" and everyone LOVED IT! I made it with 2 cups peanuts and 2 cups cashews, and I will always make it that way from now on! The first time I made it, I did burn the peanuts by waiting until the temp hit 295F, then adding vanilla and baking soda. The second time, I mixed the vanilla and baking soda into a little ball, added it when the temp hit 293F, mixed for a second and poured into the cookie sheets; it turned out perfectly! This is definately a keeper!

This recipe is fabulous! It was my first time making brittle, but it was incredibly easy. It's so delicious that my husband and I decided to make a whole new batch, doubling the recipe this time (the original batch was intended as gifts). The final steps are a tad tricky, what with the thermometer wiggling around as you stir and trying to keep it from burning (I'm pretty sure one more second on either end would have given me scalded brittle), but beyond that it's VERY easy to throw together.

This is an amazing peanut brittle recipe! I've never really made brittle before, but I was asked to make some for a family member and it came out so much better than I expected! Easy to eat with great peanut flavor,I found that adding the baking soda very last is key to obtaining the best texture possible. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe turned out a little dark for my liking. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I will try using only light corn syrup and using only half of the peanuts.

Used many tips - thanks. Can only add: 1) easy to make 2/3 recipe, and 2) my candy got to 260 in only 20 min. I checked thermometer carefully to make sure it wasn't touching bottom; then it continued to rise to 300! I took it off the stove & stirred in the peanuts, etc. It was fine! (My burners do get extra hot - I rarely use the high setting).

Hubby gives this 4 forks! I just finished a batch, and he's already scarfed down the small piece I made him on a plate to try. He claims it's the best brittle he's ever eaten! I can't wait to try this again with almonds so I can have some. I followed the recipe almost to a T, except I used raw peanuts and roasted them myself. I can't eat peanuts so I don't know how salty pre-roasted ones are, so I salted mine lightly and then added about 1/2 a teaspoon to the caramel. After pouring it onto the prepared pans I dusted the smaller of the two with fleur de sel (should be yummy, since salted caramels are to die for!)

This is an excellent, traditional peanut brittle recipe. I have been making several batches of it around the holidays for a few years now. I currently make one slight alteration. I use unsalted peanuts, add a teaspoon of kosher salt to the base and dust the brittle with fleur de sel as it sets.

I have reviewed this recipe previously and have a suggestion for all of those cooks who want to try this on their own. I mistakenly waited for 260F with my celcius thermometer and realized my mistake too late. The result, adding the nuts, vanilla and baking soda at the very end when it is about 280F, worked out perfectly...perhaps even better than the original recipe. The added bonus is that you don't have to juggle the thermometer while stirring the nuts.

Rating: 3
Boy making peanut brittle sure isn't a one person job! I found making this recipe to be a frustrating juggling act. (Partially because I had to hold my thermometer while trying to stir in the last step and that was a disaster. In the end my peanut brittle came out a little burnt tasting. 295 degrees was too much for my batch. I'm not sure I'll try this one again unless I have a second set of hands!

Rating: 2
The first time I made this, the peanuts scorched (perhaps because I didn't stir it after I dumped them in). The second time I made it, I added the peanuts just before the candy reached 295, and it turned out fine. I think it would be more flavorful with a little salt in the base.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. I have never made any type of candy before and was a bit scared of the whole process. I found this recipe to be very straight forward. The times where a shorter than stated in the recipe, as everyone else has said keep an eye on the thermometer and youll be fine.

Rating: 4
I've made this three times. I manage to burn the second batch since it had been a year since the last time I had made it. Keep a very close eye on the thermometer. It didn't take NEARLY 40 minutes to get to the correct temperature. I would recommend turning the heat to medium for that stage to prevent burning. Worked like a charm the third time. Great recipe though.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe. Took maybe 50% longer to reach the temps stated, but I was fairly conservative with the heat. One thing--a reviewer a few pages down said that a 2 qt. pot would be better...it is absolutely NOT BIG ENOUGH!!! I used that size and it was fine for most of the recipe, but when I added the baking soda (actually, the vanilla) it foamed like a shaken Coke. Totally foamed out of that little 2qt pot and all over my stove. So I advise a slightly bigger pot :).

Rating: 4
I've made several batches over the holidays, and it's very consistent. (See my suggestions in a previous review, such as using 3 sheet pans instead of 2,and lining them with parchment). I just had to add a comment for my favorite variation: Jalapeno Peanut Brittle! Finely chop one or two jalapeno peppers (seeds and ribs removed) and add them near the end of cooking, along with about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. The result is a subtle spiciness that sneaks up on you. Great as a hostess gift at parties.

Rating: 4
This is great stuff. It is time consuming and I can't imagine doing it alone. You have to be careful to distribute the nuts evenly between the 2 cookie sheets, or else you'll end up with all the nuts on the second sheet. I didn't use peanuts, but a lightly salted blend of cashews, almonds, macadamia and pistachios from trader joes. Yum.

Rating: 4
This was suprisingly easy to make, thanks to the tips in the other reviews. I warmed the baking sheets and even kept them on the warm stove while I worked the brittle. Non-stick pans with a bit of cooking spray made for easy clean up afterward. I used salted cashews and it lent a really lovely taste, as the cashews roasted a bit as I cooked the mixture. The brittle came out perfect - not to sweet or salty with a nice crunchy texture. I found that this cooked a little quicker than the recipe, so I guess it depends on your range - keep a close eye on the thermometer.

I added a small amount of cayenne to the baking soda at the end - gave it a very subtle warmth.

Just made this, took quite a while, so expect the hour estimate and then some if you follow instructions--it takes at least the 45 mins for all the water to boil off. I had no dark corn syrup so used traditional southern cane syrup in its stead--a wonderfully complex flavor resulted. I don't recall brittle taking so long to make, but very good.

very good recipe, the dark corn syrup give a nice complex flavor. I did make a change though, I used three cups (which was fine for me) raw Spanish peanuts, added them to the sugar mixture when it hit 250 degrees. This roasts the peanuts in the sugar and flavors then entire mixture with the flavor of the peanuts. I also added 2 teaspoons of salt since I wasn't using salted peanuts. I am about to use it in the Brown Butter and Peanut Brittle Ice cream recipe on here.

I have been making this recipe for Christmas presents for a number of years. Everyone raves about it. I switched to raw peanuts and add 1 tablespoon of salt to the mix when I add the peanuts and butter. The raw peanuts impart a much richer peanut flavor. I do the final cooking over a high-medium heat but pay careful attention to the candy thermometer. Pour mix on the cookie sheets, spread with a wooden spatula. Turn the mix over and continue to spread by hand.

WOW...this is, hands down, the best peanut brittle I have ever had! I can't wait to try some of the variations that others suggested. I did notice that both times I made it (last night and this morning), although the 40 minutes was right on, once I added the peanuts it slowed it down and it took a lot longer than 15 minutes in the final cook time. But it was perfect, and I am giving a combination of this brittle and truffles as gifts in tins for guests to my Christmas eve dinner tomorrow (Crown Pork Roast wrapped with bacon and apple stuffing, also off this site)...gonna have to hit the gym after the holidays...:)

Delicious!! Went with cashews instead of peanuts and it was great. I followed other review suggestions and warmed the cookie sheets, lined with parchment and sprayed with pam...super advice!

Scrumptious & easy! I was a bit anxious since I've burnt countless candy recipes for my MIL's favorite, Angel Food Candy, & this was my first brittle. This was so easy, thanks to many readers' tips & my daughter helper! This brittle has the taste, texture & look I wanted. I used 3 c. of Trader Joe whole almonds, since I was out of peanuts, but I'll use 4 c. next time. I used a 4 qt saucepan, but a 2 qt would have been better for my instant read candy thermometer (new from Sur la Table), plus it barely foamed up after adding the baking soda. My ancient Merrit & O'Keefe stove took the entire 40 min to heat to 260. I occasionally (not constantly) stirred the nuts. Worked fine. Silicon parchment paper in 2 15x10x2" pans worked great (thanks for the heated pan tip), with my daughter spreading thin the first batch I had poured. I'll use 3 pans next, like another reader suggested. There was so much nut-less brittle that I stuck untoasted whole pecans in the edges before it cooled. Divine.

I have to admit I was apprehensive, having never made peanut brittle before. Reading the advice below was a big help, especially a) line your baking sheets with parchment - it will make everything easier b) prepare 3 baking sheets, rather than 2. This will allow you to spread the candy out thinly, which makes it more delicate. Most of all, pay close attention to the thermometer. Several writers mention that the times seemed too long, but it was pretty accurate for my stovetop. Those that complained about it heating up too fast and smoking probably had the flame up too high. The reason it takes so long to reach 260 is that all of the water must gradually boil out of the solution. So at medium-high heat, the temp will stay at about 220 for about 30-40 minutes until the water is gone, but then it will suddenly begin to rise again. Also, make sure you cook it for a few minutes at 295-300 at the end. This will ensure a good crunchy texture. If the candy sticks to your teeth, it did not fully reach 295.

I do have to say that if my mom wouldn't have been here, I would never have let the sugar fully dissolve. I was ready to move to higher heat after like two minutes. What did I learn? Sugar isn't dissolved until you can see the bottom of the pan or the candy will burn. Thank you, mom!

GREAT recipe. I made two batches - One with regular peanuts - the other with Spanish Peanuts - as advised by some wonderful person in the review section!!! I had a "taste test" with three members of my family - without telling them the difference - and they all three said that the brittle with the Spanish Peanuts was by far better! Didn't have parchment paper so I buttered two cookie sheets - put them in the oven when I started cooking, then sprayed them lightly with non-stick spray right when they came out of the oven - no mess - spread perfectly - also, I put them back in the oven for 1 minute after pouring. I think that was the key! Thin great brittle!!! I will only use this recipe in the future!!! Last but not least - I don't know what I would have done without an extra pair of hands at the end - I think this is also key! Thanks all for the GREAT info from the reviews - you saved me!!!!

I had never made peanut brittle before, and this turned out great. I went to Dean and Deluca to get a candy thermometer (which you definitely need). The times are definitely off, as many people have written, but just keep an eye on the temperature and you'll be fine. I poured half onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper and half onto wax paper that was just on the counter. I was worried that the counter may not take the heat (it's not the highest quality countertop) but it ended up just fine. The brittle is delicious! I used some expensive red skinned peanuts from Dean and Deluca, which are great, but I'm sure Planters would work just as well.

I made both this recipe and the microwave peanut brittle, to see if there was any difference. I couldn't tell a difference in taste or appearance, and neither could my co-workers. But it is a big difference in the time spent in the kitchen. If you've got better than an hour to fritter away, use this recipe. If you've got things to do and want a candy that tastes just like the old-fashion time-consuming method, use Microwave Peanut Brittle available on this site. For the cook with the sticky batch -- I've found if the candy isn't cooked long enough to a high enough temperature, the stuff sticks to the teeth. Try the microwave version.

This is really delicious. A couple of suggestions: 3 cups of peanuts is enough. The best kind to use (aesthetically as well as taste- wise) seem to be the salted spanish peanut with the red skins. Something about the oil and salt mixed with the sweet creates an amazing taste and the red skins make it look better. Also-- use buttered parchment paper-- three 2-foot sections for this recipe. With three it is thinner and crispier and clean up is a breeze. If you can, make the brittle with a partner-- the last part goes so quickly, extra hands make a difference! Dishes look a mess but not to worry, the goo dissolves after a few minutes of soaking. Enjoy!

This is the best. Look no further. To help it spread, I kept the oven @ 300, put the cookies sheets with buttered silpats in for a few minutes, and then poured the mixture onto the warm sheets. After spreading it out a little bit, I threw the sheets in the oven for a minute or two. Voila! Perfect!

I tried this recipe after failing with a different recipe earlier in the day. I've eaten a plethora of brittle in my day, and this ranks right up there with the best. There was definately too much brittle for 2 pans. It may be a good idea to grease your spreading impliments, I had some trouble with the brittle sticking to my spatula and lifting off the silpats. Since it was sticking, I preheated my cookie sheets (with a silpat on each) then just piled the brittle in the middle and tilted the pan and let it spread itself out.

Look no further, this is a great peanut brittle recipe. I read all the reviews prior to making this and totally agree with their suggestions: Keep baking pans warm in oven so batter will spread thin, have buttered parchment paper ready, use a large pan because it does foam up, it takes closer to 20 minutes for the initial cooking so keep an eye on it. I found a 56 ounce container of roasted and salted extra large Virginia peanuts (Kirkland brand) at Costco for around $5 or $6 bucks which you can't beat and they're just plain old peanuts. Keep in mind that some of the name brand peanuts in your local grocery store contain MSG and various spices which is not such a great idea for homemade brittle....not if you really care about the flavor. Also, the 56 ounce size is great if you want to make more than one batch for the holidays or to just plain munch. Bon Appetit!

Everyone one loved this peanut brittle! It was easy to make too. For some reason it didn't take nearly the 40 minutes to reach 260 degrees, or the 15 minutes to reach 295 degrees. The 4 cups of peanuts were just the right amount. Next time I'm going to try more vanilla and butter. Maybe even a touch of salt. Even if I were to make it the same as the original recipe, it would still be delicious.

I've made this twice at Christmas and it's easier to make than cookies, and just as impressive. The second time I threw in pecans to add to 2 cups of peanuts (all I had in the pantry) and it was excellent. This recipe is good for a very easy and somewhat unusual gift.

This is by far the easiest, most fool-proof and most delicious brittle recipes. I have made this with cashews and macadamia nuts too, always with great results. I can never get mine as thin as I'd like, it just won't seem to spread once it's poured out onto the pans, but it's still incredibly delicious and always appreciated.

A little extra work, but with excellent results! I cut the recipe in half, which was more manageable. I spread candy on a sheet of parchment paper on the countertop instead of a cookie sheet. Only drawback is that the underside of the candy is not shiny like the top.

Absolutely delicious! Followed recipe except I didn't bother chopping the peanuts and cooking times were a little shorter. Needed 3 cookie sheets to hold all the brittle. Next time I will probably try to spread it a little thinner. The parchment paper worked great. You must have a candy thermometer to make this!!

This peanut brittle is amazing! It's true, you can't screw up. I actually liked using all 4 cups and put them in whole without coarsely chopping.

This was a complete disaster! It is very difficult to work with. I was having trouble reading the temp when I needed it to get to 295 because it was sticking to the termometer and hardening. I would never make this again!!! I love to cook, but next time I will go out and buy it! I have no idea how I am going to clean this pot.

As others have said, the recipe was easy and successful. I had 3 cups of peanuts on hand, and it still came out VERY peanut-y. For me, the times were closer to the recipe's indications, but I noticed that the last few degrees always came as a surprize. I tried the parchment, with great results. My advice: Use a stock pot - the final mixture foams up a lot. After the soda goes in, be ready to move QUICKLY! Have a 3rd sheet ready just in case you want extremely thin brittle. Afterward, the sight of the pot nearly gave me a heart attack, but it cleaned up surprisingly easy. I look forward to making it again. (UPDATE: I changed this from 3 forks to 4. When I first wrote the review I just finished making it, and wanted to record my thoughts on technique before I forgot them. Now that I have eaten a good amount of it, I can assure you that is worthy of 4 forks! You WILL have a hard time keeping this stuff on hand. My husband is right. Make batch after batch after batch.)

My wife wrote a review already, but I think she's totally nuts (har!) not to give the recipe FOUR forks. (What were you thinkin' honey?) THIS RECIPE ROCKED MY WORLD! We used to call my mother's homemade peanut brittle "Peanut BRUTAL" (sorry Mom) so I was skeptical when she announced she was making it. Now I'm a true believer. DO follow the advice of the other reveiwers though, especially about the candy thermometer. Make lots. You'll need it.

Great recipe, but the following comments: You only need 3 cups of peanuts, not four. When you add the peanuts + butter and it says to reduce heat. Doesn't make sense because you actually have to reach 295 degrees so you end up turning up the heat at that point, not reducing it. Also, it doesn't take 40 minutes(more like 25 in total) to reach the 260 degree point. And then it only takes about 10 minutes to reach 295 and the end really sneaks up on you so you must pour the batter asap as the recipe says or else it could burn. Happy crunching...

CONFECTION PERFECTION!!!! Buttery, crisp, nutty, caramelly, and SO EASY and foolfproof. My very first time making candy so I bought the thermometer, an absolute MUST (perhaps the person who said this recipe was too chewy, did not cook it long enough). AND, get a load of this, I didn't even have enough white sugar on hand, so I used half brown and could not find dark corn syrup anywhere, so just doubled the light. Took the advice of keeping the pans in a warm oven until the absolute last second. Just used plain old wax paper to line them. YOU MUST WORK quickly though to spread it out thing. even with the warm pans, I wish I had a second person helping spread. the only drawback: If you are making this for holiday gifts, GOOD LUCK NOT EATING IT ALL YOURSELF! I think i will make another batch for me. Delicious beyond compare! I will look no further for a peanut brittle recipe.

It was easy and yummy. I made the brittle last night and gave some away to a friend leaving on a trip who was delighted to have some. I tried it and it was crunchy and sweet, just like I have imagined. The parchment paper is KEY!

This was such an easy recipe. I tried another peanut brittle recipe last night which was a failure. Tried this one today, and it was easy and delicious. Definitely will make again. Didn't cook nearly as long as the recipe says, so a thermometer is key. Also, the suggestion to use parchment is much appreciated, because it worked beautifully and easily. I'll stick to this one again and again!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! The best brittle I have ever tasted. It was a huge hit with my boyfriend and the other guys at his firehouse. A definite keeper!!

Ooops, sorry about that, I didn't double the sugar, I simply substituted the same amount of sugar that was supposed to be light corn syrup (so I deleted the corn syrup and added that amount of sugar instead). Also I did use the dark corn syrup, I think it's important to the flavor. It was great!

We used this recipe for making Xmas gifts for friends and family. The times are indeed off, especially if you make a double batch. We found it very difficult to get the brittle up to high enough heat with a double batch. And, the first time we made a double batch, it foamed over the pan and onto our stove which was quite a mess! Needless to say, we used a larger pan for the next double batch. When we made a single batch, it was very easy, surprisingly quick and resulted in the best brittle. We'd do it again--but make multiple single batches. In any case, our friends loved the results whether from a single or double batch.

This was my first time making peanut brittle and it was much easier than I thought. I wouldn't trust doing it on time alone, since it reached the max temperature sooner than I thought. In fact, I turned my back for a few minutes and it got too hot. But it still turned out great. I am going to make more of this.

As a candy-novice, I was a bit apprehensive, but this recipe was great! Easy to follow and the times worked out great for me. I think the trick to a "more brittle" product is to spread it super-thin. Overall A+!

I tried this last Christmas and it was a hit at home and the office!! It was my first time making any kind of candy, and it was a breeze to make. I'm definitely making it again this year.

Great brittle! I can't wait to give this to my friends at Christmas. They won't believe that I made it myself. I followed the recipe exactly, but used parchment to line the baking sheet(a must!). Although the saucepan looked like it would never be clean again, I was pleasantly surprised that all the hardened-goo came off easily in hot sudsy water. I will definately make this again.

First experience making brittle, and it was perfection! Did not chop nuts, and did not use dark syrup, so I doubled up on the light. Can't wait to make this again for Xmas gifts. I also spread onto parchment lined cookie sheets with no problem.

I have made this brittle twice now and agree the times are off quite a bit. Be prepared to stir continuously until your arm is numb, but this brittle is completely worth the pain. I also left the peanuts intact. My dad is a peanut brittle expert and says this is the best brittle he has ever had. I need no other judge to tell me "make it again!"

i made this recipe after reading the series of comments in the file. (i limit myself to only trying recipes that are rated 90% and higher.) i had a question about the texture, though. being a southerner from peanut country - i've encountered brittle that was more, well, brittle - not the kind here that adheres to your teeth. other recipes i've encountered have had no butter and the holes made by the baking soda were larger. any idea on how i can acheive that lighter, airy feel without having the baking soda taste dominate? any suggestions would be appreciated! (i want to add this to my stable of recipes!):0)

I have prepared this recipe twice (the first one didn't last long enough)!!!! It is great. I increased the light corn syrup to 1 cup and decreased the dark corn syrup to 1/2 cup, and used 2 cups of honey roasted peanuts with 2 cups salted roasted peanuts. Very light color, texture, and flavor!

Awesome. The recipe timing works as outlined. I did not chop the peanuts before adding, which I think makes a better brittle. This will be an annual holiday treat.

Great recipe. Like the other reviewers, the cooking time was off (thank goodness for the thermometer) it only took 20 minutes to bring it to 260 degrees and about 12 minutes to bring to 295. I didn't chop the peanuts--left them whole. This is the second year I've made this one for Christmas and I always get rave reviews.

The cook times were off (less time for the first heat up, more time needed after you add the peanuts) but the results were great. It was a good Christmas gift to give out in little bags. I will make it again next holiday season.

What an easy recipe! My first venture into candy making and it was simple -follow the directions. I used the amount of peanuts called for and while cooking I thought it looked like a lot of peanuts, but it turned out just right as is. The only variation I would make is to heat the pans that you'll dump the mixture onto. The pans I used were room temp and the brittle kind of hardened up right away in clumps and was impossible to spread, so if I had heated the pans it would have been more spreadable, thus a thinner sheet of brittle.

I enjoyed this very much - it was a quick and easy recipe to make for the holidays. I listened to others and only used two cups of peanuts. Next time I would use the full four cups - too much brittle for me.

Rating: 3
I found the same thing as a previous poster - it took exactly half the time (20 minutes) for the candy thermometer to reach 260 degrees. Other than that it was easy to follow, and the results are delicious. Broke apart beautifully, and was a great colour. It is very peanuty, which was a roaring success at my house, but you could easily half the number of peanuts if you prefer less peanut and more brittle.

Grrrrrrreat! i get compliments on it all the time.

The cooking times were off a little,it only took about 20 min. to reach 260 deg. so have everything ready to go. (I was caught off guard) Also,unless you like a LOT of peanuts in your brittle and I mean a lot,half the peanuts. Even though I messed-up the directions, it still came out great and will be easier to make next time

Not having a candy thermometer made this recipie extremely difficult to accomplish. I figured I could follow the estimates in the recipie and not use the exact method but it DOES NOT work. The brittle wouldn't harden. It ended up being a mess similar to syrup and more difficult to clean up. Take my advice and get the thermometer BEFORE attempting to try this out.

As I sit here sampling this wonderful confection. I can not help, but to think of my Grandmother. This is how I remember Peanut Brittle as a child. This recipe is a must for those who like to re-live a long time favorite.

This was a simple treat to make and my friends loved it. I used raw peanuts,which I thought had a better peanut flavor. I'll do this one again.
