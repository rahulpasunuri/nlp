I reviewed this last year about this time (see below) and am just now making it again. This time I added about 1/2 cup chopped onions and some mushrooms to the butter when making the roux, added about a cup of parmesan to the batter, and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. With those changes, it was definitely even better.

The texture of this dish is delightful, and it's a great way to get kids and adults alike to eat some cauliflower (my very picky children all liked it). I thought it needed just a touch more flavor though, next time I'd add more salt and pepper, some nutmeg, and possibly sprinkle some extra parmigiano-reggiano on top.

Totally bland. I thought this was far too much effort for something that turned out to have so little flavor. Even if it had been a quick and easy recipe I probably would not try it again.

Tried this with the brown butter and without; oddly enough, the dish is better without all that extra fat. I had extra grated Parmigiano so I dusted it over the top before putting it into the oven, and that made the top as beautifully cheesy-crusty as the sides and bottom. My partner and I got two meals out of one souffle; it was even better the second night, as the cauliflower gets more tender when you bake it the second time to reheat it.

I loved making this. It was not difficult at all, and it was my first Souffle. I cut the recipe in half, because I was making it for two, and then I cut the baking time down to 25 min. I chopped the cauliflower very small as recommended by other reviews and that worked well. I also added a handful of chopped leeks, which I cannot imagine eating it without after tasting it! Instead of cheese in the dish I used butter and flour. I put a handful of mozzarella cheese in with the cauliflower and leeks. Because I had added extra ingredients to the mix, I used one additional egg yolk, and one additional egg white. I also omitted the additional salt used in the sauce. It turned out great! It rose, and did not collapse, and it tasted really really good! I did not use the brown butter at all....calories, and I dont think it needs it. Its light and airy, and really tasty! I love this recipe.

So easy to make. I doubled the cauliflower and it still turned out light and airy. Poured the mixture into 5 separate oven-proof bowls instead of one big dish.

I've been making sweet souffle a lot but this is my first savory one, and it turned out delicious. Our guest loves it, so does my husband! The recipe is good for healthy version. But I would add a little more cheese, crushed garlic and (maybe) herb de Provence. I will try this again with all of the above suggestions and then review it again.

LOVED this souffle! Not my first either, and I found it anything but bland. Definitely really chop the cauliflower well. The white pepper adds a lot to the recipe in a little bite after you eat. Loved that addition! And, I agree with adding some of the cheese into the actual souffle. Very tasty and classy, I'll definitely make this for a dinner party sometime. Oh, and did I mention easy?

I only had a 1 qt souffle dish, so I put half in it. It looked beautiful before I took it out of the oven. Then it fell to 1/2 its size. I used a toothpick to make sure it was done, but it still fell. I made little ramekins with the remainder and they turned out better. They also had more cauliflower in them. I also skipped the browned butter to shave some calories.

Not my first souffle, so perhaps I am harder on it than the other reviewers. We found it to be bland. Wishing there were cheese in the body of the souffle vs. the sides, portions served from the center tasted only of egg and cauliflower - two very plain flavors. I will not make this again, there are too many excellent soufflé's and too little time!

It turned out beautifully - I just followed recipe exactly. Great texture and flavor, helped to chop cauliflower finely.

3 forks = delicious. This was my first souffle! My mom used to make cheese souffle for us as kids, but I was always scared of making one. I was only cooking for two, so halved the recipe and used a 1Qt souffle dish. It turned out perfectly. Next time I might add some shallots, garlic, or leeks. To encourage spring to come sooner, I served this with tossed spinach salad and steamed clams with cilantro, shallots & wine.
