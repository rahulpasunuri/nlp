I could not get this to set up or reach the correct internal temp of 165. I made it twice and both times it was sludge. Maybe I didn't reduce the syrup enough? Anyone have any suggestions? Would REALLY like to make this correctly. Followed the recipe pretty exactly. Twice. So frustrating.

I made this twice in one weekend. Both times it just would not set up or reach an internal temp of 165' no matter how long I cooked it. Any idea hat I did wrong? Maybe I didn't reduce the syrup enough? So frustrating. I REALLY want to succeed with this recipe. Suggestion welcomed.

This recipe is completely off. Maple turns into rock after reducing it and it's just waaaay too sweet!

this recipe was a lot more time consuming than expected but it came out really great. I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. Once I boiled down the maple syrup, the consistency was almost similar to brown sugar. I'm not sure if that was right or not but they turned out great so I guess it was okay.

I cooked the maple syrup on the lower end of the temperature called for just to be on the safe side. I kept the stirring to a minimum and was very gentle when I did so as I was concerned the sugar would burn and turn the mixture to rock. It worked - a lovely smooth finish and the end result was delectible. Reminded me more of Creme Brulee than cheesecake, but that certainly isn't a complaint! Very tasty and decadent.

Help - When I baked the cheesecakes as directed, the mixture appears to have curdled and overflowed. I'm not sure if there's water in the cake mixture or if it's just split due to heat. I definitely want to make it again as the overflow taste delicious - any suggestions how to improve

To cook from Canada, the recipe calls for 1/3 cup sugar be mixed with the cream cheese. Bon Apetit.

?????what is the amount of sugar that you blend with the cream cheese....all I get is...cup sugar. I love maple syrup and mascarpone cheese...so I would really like to make this. I do not think it would not be alot of sugar because of the maple syrup. I could guess but if you could help me

I had trouble with the maple syrup mixture. It turned sugary when it cooled. Had to rescue it with a little Karo syrup. Also, too sweet. Would I make it again? Hell, no!!

Definitely not very easy for unskilled cooks but absolutely delicious and refined. As good as the original at Babbo's.

I decided to go ahead and try to make this recipe despite the mixed reviews and I am glad that I did. The flavor was great - the texture creamy. However, I did have trouble getting the cheesecakes out of the pan. But I used a muffin pan and didn't allow the cheescakes to cool for 24 hours - probably only 6 hours actually. At any rate, after making this dish I have decided to go purchase the proper equipment and make it again. Guests loved it too and thought it would also be great with an accompaniment of finely chopped pecans.

I've had this dessert at Babbo and it was just divine! However, when I tried to recreate it at home the result was very gritty and granular. I would love to try this recipe again and get it to taste like it should. Babbo's version is SO SMOOTH AND SCRUMPTIOUS!! Any ideas??

I had problems with this recipe. First cooling down the maple syrup mixture too much caused it to harden and I was unable to mix it into the cheese mixture. So I heated it back up until it liquified but as soon as I added it again, it solidified again. The cheesecake would not pop out of the dish and when it did there was a soggy mess of maple syrup on top. The cheescake itself was way to sweet. I would love to know how to mix the maple syrup into the cheese.

My husband made this recipe twice, both times to rave reviews. It turned out perfectly, no problems with boiling the maple syrup. It's a keeper!

I have had this dessert many times at Babbo and absolutely love it. I was thrilled to see the recipe published in Bon Appetit. I immediately purchased all the ingredients and tried to make it at home. I even brought back a Grade A maple syrup from Vermont. In making this dessert, I would have appreciated more notes when boiling down the maple syrup. I'm not sure if I should have used a lower grade of maple syrup (perhaps Grade B), but over medium heat (as the recipe specifies), my maple syrup started to burn just after 15 minutes. It was a huge mess. Needless to say, I didn't go beyond that since I had to clean up the burnt caramel. Should the maple syrup be boiling under a very low heat? Since I really do enjoy this dessert, I will try it again.
