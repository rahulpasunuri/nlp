This is a very good dish. I made as is except left out the rice wine - didn't have any. I love the heat and the sweet of the chicken.

I love Sriracha as much as the next girl, but its face-melting spiciness cancels out any other flavors in the sauce. I'd recommend using a milder hot sauce like Frank's. The baked rice flour crust on the wings is excellent, and I agree with other reviewers that you will definitely need up to 3 times as much sauce.

I have made this for 2 dinner parties with tremendous success. One 14 yr old connosieur raved and asks for it whenever he comes by. Absolutely delish.

I followed the recipe exactly and liked the results. The skin was crisp and well flavored. The drumsticks are tasty cold as well. The recipe doesn't mention this, but I would suggest letting the meat sit for 10 minutes or so after removing it from the oven. 450 degrees for one hour plus makes the temperature of the meat too hot to eat immediately. I like hot (spicy) food, but this sauce would be too spicy for several members of my family. It could easily be modified, however, by decreasing the amount of Sriracha to a quarter or a third of a cup. The method of dredging the meat in a mixture of rice flour and cornstarch, baking the meat, and then tossing it in the sauce could be adapted for any sauce--although I would caution that you keep an eye on the meat while it is cooking after being coated with the sauce. Any marinade with sugar will burn quickly at this baking temperature. Also I suggest covering the pan with heavy aluminum foil to make clean-up easier. This cooking method and sauce would work well on spareribs or chicken thighs, with an adjustment of the baking time. The advantage of drumsticks or wings or spareribs is that one gets some of the sauce with each bite. That might be less likely with thighs, but there I would loosen the skin before baking and spoon a bit of the sauce between the skin and the meet before the initial baking to flavor more of the meat rather than just the surface.

to margeanne, i cook with shiracha and frank's hot sauce all the time and frank's is a good substitute because it also has plenty of delicious flavor and is not nearly as hot as shiracha

The methodology would be perfect for drumsticks or wings as an alternative to deep frying. However, I'll have to modify the sauce recipe to eliminate all that sweetness. It's a personal preference, but I don't like sweet stuff on meat and poultry, so I'll try it with hot sauce and soy sauce only. In answer to Margeann, Shiracha is not that hot, but it has more flavor depth than regular hot sauces, so I recommend giving it a try. It is very popular with cooks who enjoy hot and sweet combined.

Looking to make this as it looks delicious. My question: Can you use Frank's Hot Sauce as I believe it is not as spicy? I like spice but find the other spicier.

I have not prepared this yet, but why no nutrition information.

I have made this several times with drumsticks, chicken wings and most recently used the sauce with sauteed shrimp. My family love it. The only modification I made was to make it a little less hot/spicy than called for in the recipe. I will continue to make this.
