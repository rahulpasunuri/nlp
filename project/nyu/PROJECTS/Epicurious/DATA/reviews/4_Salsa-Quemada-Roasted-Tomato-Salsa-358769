I had never made Salso before and was surprised how easy and Good it was. I used 1 and a 1/2 serrano chilies. It was a bit hotter than I would have liked, so will stick to the receipe next time.

I modified the recipe and used hot house tomatoes on the vine, two small habanero peppers, a medium fresh green poblano pepper and one half of a fresh pineapple cut into rings. I brushed all ingredients with a light coating of olive oil before roasting. Roasted all the ingredients in a 550 degree convection oven for a total of 25 minutes. The garlic came out after 10 minutes of roasting and I turned the other ingredients (except tomato) as needed when the skin blistered or turned caramel brown color. Pureed the tomato, carmelized onion, garlic and peppers in food processor, added 2 tsp of ground cumin and salt to this mixture. I coarsely chopped 1/2 of a raw white onion and the cored, carmelized pineapple and added it to the mixture. I pulsed the food processor from this point forward because I wanted small chunks of pineapple and onion to be present in the finished product. Refrigerated overnight, fresh lime juice from two key limes added to the mixture and reseasoned prior to serving. It is terrific and the habanero peppers do not overpower, but add a nice level of heat that lingers a bit.

Great salsa, since Walla Walla Sweet Onions were in season, I used half of one raw and when I took the peppers and garlic out I threw the other half (sliced thick) in and browned the slices. The final product was a bit soupy, so I drained half of it in a colander and the juice is the basis for a Salsa Maria - using anejo tequilla and the juice! Great hit.

This salsa was great! Changes made: used 2 serrano peppers instead of 1, fresh ground sea salt, and broiled the veggies in the oven. Salsa came out perfect. Will make again for sure!

Good Recipie. However I roasted all veggies except onion in the broiler and added a half each of green and red pepper to the mix oven broiled of course. I also added a quarter of seeded finely diced cucumber. Along with the lime juice I added grated lime zest.

I thought the flavors were very good, although not as spicy as I prefer so I used three serranos. I did find the stove top roasting to be uneven and take much longer for the tomatoes than the recipe indicates. Using a broiler was easier and generated much less smoke.

This is a great and easy recipe. I used this as the salsa that accompanied a Costa Rican Tilapia dish with black bean & pineapple rice. Great texture and flavor.

I made this for a Christmas party at my culinary art's school and even took some to work...........everyone loved it. The only thing I did different is that I ran out of garlic so I didn't put alot in and I also added some lime juice to it too. It is an easy and great recipe!!

I love a recipe that starts with ventilating your kitchen :) This is very tasty and my favorite salsa's are the ones that go through a food processor to make them thin. Also, a great tip to reseason before use. I also make another salsa with a lot of garlic, here it is. http://www.surerecipe.com/MediumTomatoSalsa.aspx

This was fantastic. I have been looking for a recipe that was similar to the "black" salsa at Baja Fresh restaurants. This was very close! I used the flat plate on the BBQ to roast the vegies and also roasted the onion just slightly. Served with carnitas tacos but also good with just chips.
