Re: the elusive mustard greens. The recipe should read 'Leaves of 2 bunches mustard greens, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 6 cups)'. I also reduce the salt for the cabbage bath, as others have noted. Other than those missteps, this is a good basic recipe for a food that is considered one of the world's healthiest - enjoy!

I am continually amazed and disappointed to note how few times supposedly top food websites fail to respond to users who point out recipe errors - it's as if once the recipe is "published", it may no longer be edited. In a past life, I attempted to teach 7th graders language arts (apparently unsuccessfully) - I remember well how difficult it was to get them to go back, after they thought they were finished writing something, and have them "proofread" their work! For some, this was simply impossible - I think they got jobs with this website.

This recipe is wrong. I have made it verbatim and it is WAY too salty!!! Make it with 1/2 cup salt per gallon water to soak the cabbage, not 1 cup salt per 1/2 gallon water and you'll have a MUCH better kimchi!!!!

To the reviewer from Kansas City, do not add any liquid when adding cabbage in the jars. You just pack it in until it's almost full. If you overstuff the jar, once the kimchi starts to ferment, the juice that is created will overflow. I am Korean, and this kimchi recipe is pretty authentic!

This recipe looked intimidating to me at first, but then I remembered that with pickling, pretty much anything goes, and it turned out pretty well! I'll certainly make it again, and this time I'll order the right kind of chili powder online. Since I didn't have it on hand this time, I used Hungarian paprika instead. The flavor wasn't QUITE authentic, but it still tasted good. Also, don't stress about the mysterious "mustard greens". Just skip them.

We have made this several times, and it is wonderful!

I didn't actually make this recipe, but the directions don't make sense. Step three talks about mustard greens, but there aren't any mustard greens in the ingredient list! Then when you put the cabbage in the jars, is there supposed to be any kind of liquid in the jars? Or do you just pack it in super full to "remove air bubbles"? I'm not Korean and have never made anything like this before, but I'd love to try - perhaps pictures would help?

My Korean grandmother made kimchee EXACTLY this way. Remembered the process but not the proportions of ingredients. Glad to find this recipe. It's awesome and doesn't get any more delicious or authentic than this!
