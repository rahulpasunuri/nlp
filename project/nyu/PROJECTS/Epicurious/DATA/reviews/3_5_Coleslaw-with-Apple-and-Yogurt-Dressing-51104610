It was very tasty and so much fun to make. I do agree with the past comments of replacing the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar.

amazingly awesome! I would recommend cutting the white vinegar in half or substituting for apple cider vinegar. I also added diced fesh blueberries and nectarines

I don't know why chefs use white vinegar in dressings, much less in recipes. It is astringent and nasty and only suitable for cleaning windows and shower heads. A good vinegar for cole slaw is apple cider vinegar, or lacking that, white wine vinegar. I know distilled white vinegar is inexpensive, but please you are chefs. Use better ingredients and leave the rest to the cleaning crew.

We had this yesterday - made almost as written, left out carrot and used regular yogurt. I halved the recipe for 4, but still had lots left over. We all liked it - I think the yogurt made the dressing taste lighter, and everyone liked the addition of apple. Good cook out salad.

Splendidly written! Most recipes I read have such horrid prose! I particularly appreciated the eloquent alliteration of "bag broccoli" and the (almost) sensual instruction to "Toss...Whisk...Season...to taste...chill...cut core...incorporate..." It stirs me! Food is underrated as a sensual outlet, don't you think?
