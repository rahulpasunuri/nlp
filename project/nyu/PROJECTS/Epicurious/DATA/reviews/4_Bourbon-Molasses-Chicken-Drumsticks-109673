I made wings in lieu of legs - same recipe. Followed directions, used dijon in lieu of yellow mustard & added a few dashes tabasco as suggested b other reviewers. Easy & a big hit! We;re having a different set of friends over tomorrow & I'll be serving these!

Rating: 4
Excellent BBQ sauce, needs salt (used dijon rather than yellow) and a bit of heat from chili powder increase or tabasco. Don't be impatient and cook for the time as directed. Nice and thick. Not too sweet at all!

Wow - delicious! I made this about 5 times in 2 months. It's THAT GOOD!!!

Minus the bourbon, this is nearly my mothers chicken BBQ sauce I grew up on. Usually she started the sauce about 5 pm, Dad started the grill at 6 and it was dang dark by the time we ate. Theyve both been gone a while but tonight I got a taste of the old times! Today I doubled everything but the ketchup, subbing 1 can each of tomato paste and sauce, and again for old time sake left out the bourbon. I used dried minced onion and added about 1tsp of liquid smoke. Started over a medium charcoal fire with greased foil on the grill I cooked 18 thighs for about 30-40 without turning. Then I started basting on the foil covered grill without turning for another 15. Spooning worked ok but I want to find my sopping mop for next time. After about an hour of cooking I removed the foil, turned the bird and continued basting and turning another 30 till the coals were about gone. Its been over 25 years but I could hear my dad tonight just after dark saying  I think theyre just about done and they were. Next time Ill try the bourbon and if its good enough I might just add it to the sauce.

We used this as a dip for mozzarella sticks when we had unexpected company--worked really well. With chicken it is excellent. Kris

This recipe is a big hit every time I make it. Here in Texas we like things spicy so I do add some Sriracha chili sauce.

Incredible sauce. Tasty and uber easy. It definitely had a strong bourbon taste to it, but that's what makes it stand apart from other ho-hum BBQ sauces. I did add a few dashes of tabasco for some much needed heat. Great with smashed red potatoes and buttery corn.

This sauce is so good! Made as written just added extra chili powder and we baked our chicken, 375 75 min...we don't grill in the snow.

Great BBQ sauce. Definetly will make again. Used it on chicken first part of the week and the rest of the batch I used on ribs later in the week. Easy and delicious

I really enjoyed this easy-to-prepare recipe, however my family found the bourbon taste too strong. I used less bourbon the second time and it was enjoyed by all. I will continue to make this and will gently tweak the ingredients for a great result.

Everyone that I've made this for loves it--it's become a favorite to bring to barbecues as the sauce can be prepared ahead of time.

I hated to give this recipe such a low mark, but I found the sauce very unappealing. All I could taste was bourbon and I thought it was much better before that was added. The chicken, however, was very tasty and the skin crispy. I also would have preferred blending the sauce at the end for smoother result. That said, I think I will prepare the chicken with the salt and pepper under the skin again.

Very good recipe. The sauce was very good, but was a little too bourbony right when it was finished cooking, but upon cooling to room temperature, it was very good. Not the best sauce I have ever had, but it was the best sauce I have ever made.

I left out the chili powder, and substituted white wine vinegar for 1/3 of the ketchup. Delicious. Probably the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.

Rating: 4
Have made this recipe time and time again since it was first printed in 04. I usually double the chili powder to give it a little extra kick, and will try the cayenne in the next batch. Like the idea of adding the grand marnier for the orange flavor. this is always a hit--highly recommended.

This is delicious! I tried it for the first time this weekend for a family cookout and everyone loved it, even the kids. I grilled drumsticks, breasts and wings - all turned out great. I'll definitely use this recipe again. Also would be good on ribs or pork chops.

We loved it! We don't care for ketchup so I substituted some French white wine vinegar and extra Worchestershire sauce and it was really great! Very delicious!!

This sauce was wonderful. My guests raved about it! I took another reviewer's advice and used Maker's Mark, and made it the day before. I served the chicken with grilled asparagus (garlic salt, pepper and olive oil) and grilled corn on the cob (in husk) and people are still talking about it. Yay!

Lose the sugar and turn up the heat by adding cayenne. This stays in the fridge a long time, so make a big quantity. You will feel like a super cook when you whip out your own homemade bbq sauce.

I can't tell you how many times I've made this!!! The last time, just a few weeks ago, was for my nephew and his 5 friends visiting us for spring break. There wasn't a single piece of chicken left. This is absolutely the best BBQ sauce ever!

Man oh man, this is awesome bbq sauce. By far the closest thing to my favourite BBQ place's. I will absolutely be making this again...soon!

This was a really tasty dish. I omitted 1 tbsp of the sugar, cut down on the fat a bit, and added a little extra cayanne.

Excellent flavor and texture. Doubled the chili powder, and added a pinch of cayenne. No one flavor dominated. Served with unsweetened corn bread, and greens. Husband loved it.

Judging by the raves from the guests, they LOVED this barbeque sauce. I don't care for barbeque but it was worth making the sauce for those that do.

Rating: 1
I thought this sauce was too sweet. The consistency was too thick and tasted too much like ketchup. I could not tase the molasses nor the bourbon. It didn't seem to create a glaze for the chicken - it just laid there, unchanged. I would not make this again and threw out the leftover sauce.

Rating: 2
I thought the sauce was way too sweet. I think more chili powder and cayenne would help? Also, I was overpowered by the bourbon. I like the BBQ sauce recipe on this site for bourbon ribs. The sauce is more labor intensive than this one but the taste is so much better. There may be a couple- it has an ancho chili in the sauce.

We had a few guests for a casual supper--thought there'd be l.o.s, but, alas, all were eaten! One man even requested the recipe. I'm using the extra sauce for brisket in the crockpot.

We grill year-round so this recipe was an exciting twist on the usual. Being from Texas though I like things a little more spicey so I added some dashes of Tabasco and a little more chili powder to the sauce for a few of the legs and liked it better. Some fresh winter savory from the herb garden made it interesting. Next time I'll try using a hot mustard like Coleman's instead of the yellow mustard.

I agree with Cleveland. This was OK but very sweet. It was also a little greasy. I will definitely cut down on butter and brown sugar next time. I pulled all the leftover chicken off the bone and it was much much better the next day in sandwiches.

I was surprised that I didn't love this recipe after all the rave reviews; I thought the sauce was too sweet. I will make it again using one reviewers suggestion of adding hot sauce. Any other suggestions?

Yummiest barbecue sauce ever!! Followed the recipe using chicken thighs and legs. Can't wait to try it with pork on the grill.

What a wonderful combination of flavors! Easy to make. The bourbon and molasses in the barbecue sauce are a nice combination of flavors. Rubbing the chicken with the salt/pepper mixture really improved the flavor of the chicken. This recipe is defintely going in my recipe box. Yum! Yum!

I baked this dish at 350 for about an hour and it was fantastic. Even though it heats up the kitchen a bit, it makes a great company meal on a warm evening. Add potator salad, corn bread, sliced cukes and tomatoes. Add a fresh peach dessert and open a nice Viognier. Eat on the deck. My guests raved and I did the same menu twice!

GREAT GREAT GREAT! I had a barbque yesterday and these got RAVE reviews. Definately a winner. Highly recommended. I am claiming this as "my secret recipe".

Excellent sauce! Easy to make, fast and everybody loved it; even the kids. No complaints from those who don't like the taste of alcohol in their sauces. Suace became better by the minute as it cooled prior to being used. I let it stand for 4 or 5 hours and kept tasting it; I couldn't keep from tasting more and more! Very complex flavors. This is a keeper!!

Fantastic! I bought a tiny bottle of Knob Creek bourbon to try this recipe. Barbecue chicken doesn't get any better. A new summer classic.

As we are not bourbon drinkers I substituted Grand Marnier - although it is excessive for chicken on the grill, the orange flavor really was a lovely addition. Also in the interest of ease, I made the sauce, poured it into a Zip-loc bag, added the chicken and marinated overnight. Then just placed them directly onto the grill. Really quite good.

If we owned a restaurant, this dish would be on the menu ! The only change we made was adding a few squirts of Tabasco for a bit of heat, New Orleans style.

This sauce is something my wife and I can finally agree on. Not too spicy for her and not too sweet for me. Not only is it delicious, it's easy to prepare and makes the whole house smell good. I used drumsticks as the recipe recommended but I'm sure it would be great with breasts and thighs and such. Probably great with ribs too. A whole hearted recommendation.

Well........this bourbon lover would recommend that you gradually add the bourbon, to taste -- I followed the recipe exactly and felt that the bourbon overpowered the other ingredients. I did try again with rum and personally liked that better.
