This recipe is awesome! I did add one clove of garlic and one small onion sauteed in butter at the beginning. I had only parsnips and carrots for root vegetables, but the broth was sweet and delicious. I did use the zucchini and added spaetzle at the end. Marvellous!

I agree with other reviewers that this is ok, but nothing special. I always make my own homemade stock and I thought that adding the root vegetables would somehow "amp" this up, but it really didn't. It is no different than my standard chicken stock recipe without the roots.

I also threw in a few sprigs of the carrot greens. A special extra ingredient which my mother and grandmother also used to add is at least 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, which adds depth to the flavour. And I add white pepper, not black. If you can't wait until tomorrow to skim the fat off the brother, you can use a fat skimmer. Delicious.

I have made this soup more times than I can count; it is now the only way I make chicken soup. What veggies I use varies with what I have, though always parsnips! I no longer discard the vegetables. Though it is messy, I extract most of them (go easy on turnip and rutabaga, maybe not both), squeeze the onion out of the skin, and put it all in the blender with some of the broth. This mash can then be frozen for another soup. I recently combined two batches of veggie mash with 20 cloves of roasted garlic, broth and milk as necessary and made a terrific, creamy soup. Don't waste all those veggies!

I haven't made this (so I didn't rate it) but I don't understand why you would use all these veggies just to throw most of them away. I make chicken stock every week with so much less waste (and effort). Every week I buy a roast chicken and pick all the meat off to use in other recipes. I throw everything that is left over (bones, skin, etc) in a crock pot with a carrot, celery, large onion (all rough chop) bay leaves and a few peppercorns. Add cold water to cover, set on low and let it go all day (12 hours or more). No need to skim and the stock is golden and delicious. So, so easy....

Followed the recipe exactly and found the broth on the bland side. It was also heartbreaking to compost all those vegetables. Needs more flavor ... maybe add garlic? Chilies?

Great, very traditional chicken soup. I followed the recipe with few changes. No kohlrabi or rutabagas in the store so I used a bit larger turnip and added a leek. I used a small chicken and reduced the liquid. I used chicken broth instead of water. Served with matzoh balls. Really heart warming. Mu usual chicken soup has a slightly Italian spin- like my grandmothers and it was interesting to see how different herbs and vegetables give such a different feeling.

BEST chicken soup I've ever tasted. Takes a while but oh so worth it. I felt bad about throwing away the vegetables the first time I made the soup, but not any more -- the flavors of the veggies are all in the soup!! Put noodles in the soup the first time I made it, and will be putting matzah balls in tonight! I followed the recipe completely except the part about chilling it in the fridge overnight. Also put the onions in an hour into the simmering (so I could pull some chicken meat out for our dogs before I add onions). You must try this recipe!

I am about to make this soup for the second time in two weeks. The vegetables I'm using this time are slightly different this time due to availability, but it all smells great! I was crazy for this soup the last time. The vegetables make such a flavorful broth. I did, like another reviewer, add 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillion to the soup to deepen the flavor. And I'm making matzoh balls this time, too.

A super good classic. Seems like it should be made over 2 days; make the stock on day 1 and chill overnight it so you can get the fat off. After 2 hours in the cold, couldn't get the thick oil slick out and so we had to consume it (well, it tasted good!) Also, I pulled the chicken off the bone and out of the pot after 45 minutes and then threw it back in at the end. Seemed less "overcooked" that way and not much more work. Plus I left the liver in for a while instead of marrow bones; don't know if helped but certainly didn't hurt!

Really good. I put the stock veggies in the food processor with a bit of stock for a delicious roasted veggie soup. I reserve 4 forks for the exceptional, this was close, but not quite there. But will surely be one of my go to soups.

I make this soup all the time. It is pretty much "what you need" if you are sick. the broth is very flavorful! it has a fresh, chicken-y, straight-up vegetable(S)!, and not-salty-at-all broth. I could eat the broth alone and feel so much better. You can literally taste the health in this soup. You probably don't need to add every single vegi that it calls for - if you don't have or can't find it - and it will still be very good. I am starting to get sick, just started cooking it (its a wednesday), and it will be done by dinner time. totally worth the effort and delicious! try it with matzo balls! mmmm. YUM

I love, love, love this recipe! As with some other reviewers, I have also found that the broth isn't quite rich enough. To compensate, I cheat and add Better Than Bouillon. I cut up the chicken, carrots, parsnips and rutabaga and add it to the soup. We eat this for two days and then freeze the rest.

No need to chop the dill or parsley, just makes it harder to strain.

This broth did not end up being very flavorful. Still has a pleasant taste, just not as flavorful as I would have expected given the ingredients. Will probably look for a different stock recipe.

I gave this ZERO forks! I bought all the ingredients at Whole Foods yesterday and spent the afternoon preparing what I expected to be a delicious soup. The taste is just okay and the chicken fell apart into long, thin strands -- the soup looks like broth full of "chicken hair"! When I dip a spoon in the soup the chicken hair just wraps around it like seaweed around your ankles! It is inedible. I followed the recipe exactly so I don't understand what went wrong. Was the chicken old? Is two and a half hours too long to simmer? What makes chicken meat do that? So disappointing!

I was looking for a recipe to approximate the delicious dill and vegetable soup they have at Veselka's, a Ukrainian diner in the East Village, NYC, and I have to say this one hit it straight on! I added peppercorns, a whole head of garlic, some chives just cause I had them, and a bay leaf to the stock and let it go about three hours. To the soup I added the rutabaga, carrot, and zucchini, but I added cauliflower as well and cut them all up in little 1/4-inch dice instead of sliced in strips. I also added more dill (about 3 tbsp) to the final soup, and even followed one reviewer's tip to make a puree of the leftover root vegetables. I didn't think it made it as a dip, though; instead I added a few spoonfuls back to the soup to kick up the flavor. I plan to freeze the leftover puree in small batches and use as a soup base--just add chicken broth and veggies and you're set! I will definitely make again and again. My houseguests raved for days, calling me (!!) a gourmet chef.

Absolutely THE BEST CHICKEN SOUP I've ever tasted. Relatively easy to make. Just a bit time consuming. Plan ahead to make this soup and allot a full day from start to finish. I serve with fresh cheddar cheese biscuits or fresh baguette. Both friends and family rave about this soup. I, too, use klusky noodles but in the absence of those fideos or angel hair pasta work well. I've added this to my favorite recipes.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. I've made it three times, each time w/o kohlrabi because I can't find it anywhere. Don't peel the onions, the skin colors the soup beautifully. The layers of flavor are very complex, and I always freeze half. We eat the cooked veggies but I do julienne fresh carrots and zucchini and add kluski noodles. If you cook the noodles separately, and just add them to a bowl when you want to eat the soup, it keeps for much longer. Even better the next day. Well worth the effort!

I always wanted a real homemade chicken soup recipe that would live up to legend. I was dispirited at the amount of time it took to make this, and I couldn't figure out a good way to reuse the overcooked vegetables (and/or extra chicken) as reviewers recommended. At the end, though, it's a lovely soup with a flavor all its own, neither too sweet nor bland. If you make it only once a year, and freeze the leftovers for when someone is sick, maybe that's a reasonable goal in this busy world.

Great hearty soup. Lots of subtle flavors. For my version, I quartered & roasted all the root vegetables with a 2T Olive oil and Salt/Pepper for 45 Min. Then pureed 1/2 the veggies, cubed the remaining veggies and then added all to the broth. I did not add any noodles. I also cut the Chicken broth by half and substituted 1/2 Vegetable broth. Other than I followed the recipe

Excellent! Made this with a leftover roasted turkey frame instead of raw chicken. First, I boiled the just the frame for an hour, then removed the bones to pick off the meat. Added cubed veggies, herbs, and turkey meat to the broth and cooked for another hour or so. Used all listed ingredients except for kohlrabi and didn't discard any of them. Added egg noodles in the last 5 minutes of cooking, skipped the zucchini. I think the fresh dill and parsley are essential (doesn't taste dilly, just very fresh). Soup turned out slightly sweet, buttery, complex. The best soup I've ever made. Can't wait to have some tomorrow.

I've been searching for a chicken soup for a long time that wasn't bland. This is everything but bland! Very flavorful, almost sweet. Requires some time, but definitely worth it. Added 2 cup egg noodles and deleted the dill. This version is the best I've ever had!

I served this soup last night for Rosh Hashanah and everyone absolutely loved it! There were a few modifications that I made--I could not find marrow bones or kohlrabi. I used one whole cut up chicken and added 4 thighs. I did indeed peel the onions and did NOT discard all the vegetables. Instead I cut them up and added about half of them to the soup. I did discard the turnips as they didn't look worthy of serving. I also added wide egg noodles before serving. I did not add the zucchini or rutabaga at the end since I already had plenty of vegetables. The broth was absolutely rich and delicious tasting and this soup will become my new holiday staple!

Rating: 4
IMO, this is the best chicken soup I've ever had. It also seems to be pretty authentic to the Jewish version. All those root vegetables are cheap, (well, most of them are in most places) nutritious and delicious, and really are key, along with the dill, for the authentic taste. I made matzoh balls to go with from the Manischewitz box. I have to laugh at all the strange additions and subtractions others are making. You're missing out on a great soup.

Delicious, like my old Hungarian grandma makes (minus the chicken feet sticking up out of the pot!) I used celeriac instead of kohlrabi and added whole peppercorns, which are then strained out. I think you can serve the soup vegetables instead of discarding them like a previous reviewer did, I always do but this is down to personal preference. Some people may find them too mushy, although that's no bad thing when you are too sick to chew. :-)

I made this for a sick friend who loved it. I kept all the veggies in and had noodles on the side as an optional addition. Keep in mind that the soup is a bit sweet when you leave in all those root veggies.

This is well worth the effort! I left out the dill (too overpowering) and instead used sage and thyme along with the fresh parsley. The result was a rich, flavorful stock.

Yep. It's definitely excellent. But very labor intensive. Of course scratch things generally are more work than opening a can...I added lots of crushed red pepper to my serving because I have a cold, and it perked me right up!

I added 4 cloves of garlic to all the vegetables. Seemed like a waste to throw out the vegetables after simmering them. Instead I arranged them on a platter and cut them into large bite size pieces. I threw out the less attractive pieces. My guests picked out whatever vegetables they wanted in their soup. The vegetables had a stew-like texture and taste which was DELICIOUS! If you do this, you can skip the unnecessary step of boiling additional vegetables at the end. Just skim off fat with ladle-refrigeration step not necessary. Add a sprig of dill to the soup bowl for final touch. Delicious!

The whole purpose of this recipe is for the broth of the soup to be home-made. You cannot make with canned broth or it will not be the same. I followed the recipe as directed using my crockpot overnite (everything very tender.) I would not add the parsnip/turnip strips as I thought they were too bitter to add, but fine for making the broth. This is excellent to keep in the fridge when you can pull it out and heat it up as my teenagers did help themselves.

Made this beauty twice in four days-- not bad for a household of two! Thanks to Alamogordo for the tweaks, here's mine: Add one julienned Chilpotle pepper to an individual serving& swirl. I like La Morena's Chilpotle Peppers in Adobo sauce. A great recipe and a go-to- standby in my kitchen already!

The addition of the dill and parsnips are miraculous! Outstanding. The one change I made I learned from a Julia Child cookbook. Roast the chicken first, then make stock. I roasted an already cut up chicken Also, I always brine chicken, it makes a tremdous difference in flavor and tenderness.

This soup was wonderful. I made it for our family before we went out Trick-or-Treating! Even the finicky kids loved it! I did not add the kohlrabi as I did not want to spend $3.59 at our specialty store for something I'd never eaten before. Maybe next time :) Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly except I added noodles at the end. Next time, I think I might puree some of the root vegetables that I used in the stock and add it to the soup as a thickening agent. I definitely will make this soup again. Everyone loved it and asked for more, more, more!!

Absolutely the best chicken soup I've ever had come out of my own kitchen. I was looking for a way to use up the strange root vegetables from my community-supported agriculture box, and found this recipe. Made it without the marrow bones or zucchini, and could not believe the complexity of the taste of this soup. It is truly memorable. I can't wait till fall to make it again!!!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I thought the broth tasted too sweet. The second time, using 5 pounds of chicken, I omitted the rutabaga and reduced the parsnips and carrots to two each when making the broth. After the broth was made, I added half a rutabaga, one parsnip, and two carrots. I cut up the vegetables in larege "matchsticks". The rest of the vegetables (and the herbs) I kept the same. I didnt use the kohlrabi either time because our market was out of it! The soup was much better the second time.

I have made this exact recipe and it was great. I have also made a simpler version of this recipe. I used the same amount of water and added a leftover roaster chicken from the night before and let the whole thing boil in the water for about a half an hour before I added the remaining ingredients. My ingredients included: 1 onion, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 1 tsp. salt, some pepper, 2 tbsps. fresh parsley and I added potato gnocchi. It was a hit in my house.

In answer to the cook from Buffalo, NY as to why some of the vegetable are discarded. That's how the soup broth is made. The flavor of those vegetables is cooked out into the broth, but the actual vegetable itself may not be what is needed in the soup. And even if the particular vegetable may be desired for the soup it would be all mushy, so it's better to add fresh ones to the stock and then cook them till done, but not mushy.
