Excellent recipe. I did not have Arame and used some seaweed wraps instead. The rest of the recipe was followed as written. My family loved this as a summer main dish. The flavors mix well together and it has a nice crunchy texture. We will definitely make this again. My future son-in-law mixed some Greek yogurt into his portion and it added a nice creamy component.

If you like these flavors and you like couscous, you will like this dish. And so good! Very easy as well. I have some leftover in my fridge, yet I can't wait to make it again!

GREAT recipe!! My whole family LOVED it, even my 7 year old who had no clue that he was eating seaweed!!! I omitted the radish and sunflower seeds because I didn't have any, and also omitted the shoyu/tamari because of a soy allergy. Used extra sesame oil and sushi rice vinegar instead, about equal parts of each, to taste. This recipe is a keeper!!
