Made 5 times and you have to follow the directions when you cook the sugars, it is chemistry and not just melting butter. I love this but have to use an instant read thermometer

Wondering if I cooked it too long....it tasted like caramel sauce rather than butterscotch and was not smooth. I prefer the butterscotch sauce recipe included here with the fallen chocolate cake squares.

Icky? I think I could pour melted butter on just about anything and love it. Needless to say, I enjoyed this sauce and will no doubt make it again. I didn't have a lemon so I used a bit of cider vinegar instead. Delicious!!!!!

This sauce has a good consistency, but the flavour is too buttery without being sweet, reminiscent of pouring melted butter on ice cream, which is a bit icky.

Could not believe how good or easy to make this was. I will never buy butterscotch sauce again.

Amazing. I thought I hated butterscotch til I made this for an ice cream sundae party. You have to try this if you've never had "from scratch" butterscotch before.
