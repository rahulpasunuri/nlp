I would like to try this pie AND the sauce, but it seems to get such mixed reviews. Since the problem with the sauce appears to be "kick", I wonder if using "fire roasted tomatoes" well drained would solve the problem? I would like to make this for a "ladies" luncheon I do each year, but right now am a bit hesitant about using this recipe.

I find this sauce to be the perfect accompaniment to the salmon and leek pie. It isn't meant to be super spicy, but rather have a subtle kick.

I have to disagree, I find this sauce to be delicious and the perfect accompaniment to the salmon & leek pie. It has a subtle taste, and the chiles do provide a spike. It's not going to burn the roof of your mouth, if that's what you're looking for.

I have to disagree, I think this sauce is quite tasty, and a lovely accompaniment to the salmon & leek pie. It has a subtle taste, and it does have a spike from the chiles. It's not going to burn the roof of your mouth, if that's what you're looking for.

If you're expecting any zing at all out of a sauce named "sour cream - chile", forget it. I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup, used 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper and a roasted red pepper, plus tobasco, worcestershire sauce and celery salt based on suggestions from another cook -- still not much flavor. Don't bother. If you want to serve the pie (and I was disappointed in it, too), I suggest you use a different sauce.

Since I heard that this receipe was bland. I used roasted red peppers from the jar along with a green chile. It seemed that two cups of sour cream was too much and I could not seem to spice this sauce up. I guess I would search for a different sauce next time.

Not as spicy as I thought. Good quality roasted peppers in a jar can be substituted and is a time saver. It is good with salmon and leek pie.

This sauce which was features with the salmon and leek pie is delicious. I made a caviar sour cream sauce with chives and chervil to accompany the pie. SUPERB
