We have some friends we have gotten together with for some thirty years. I made this as part of our feast. It was really interesting and not bad at all. I was just expecting more wow and it wasn't there. Next time, if I make it again, I'll spice it up a bit. I think that was the problem; a little bland. Guess I wanted a spicy bloody Mary and got a V8...

Different and delicious. Not difficult to make. The sorbet froze up easily. Surprisingly, the onion oil made this dish for me...don't leave it out. We forgot the chips, and it was still good.

We made this recipe as one of the appetizers for our daughter's Graduation Party, and everyone was impressed and loved it! We enjoy trying to new reciptes, and this one caught our attention, as it is quite a creative concept. It seems to stem from two traditions: Gazpacho of Spanish Cuisine, and the Avocado and Chips of Mexican Cuisine. We loved it!

Oh my goodness, this was delicious. So unexpectedly great. I'm always looking for new nad interesting recipes stemming from old familiar foods. Made this as a first course for Cinco de Mayo with the family this year. (Along with Chicken Adobo in Parchment & Red Rice from epicurious and a green salad. Classic Flan, also from here, for dessert.) What a great treat. The kick from the tobasco in the tomato sorbet was superb. Served it alongside thick corn tortilla chips. This is actually a very easy recipe that will certainly impress company.
