This is a very tasty rich recipe. I added one potato (just because I like them) and did not use the parsnips. It freezes well.

Good flavor. It had a little more liquid in it than I wanted. Maybe next time I'll add more flour.

This recipe gets rave reviews every time I serve it. You can eliminate the cream to cut down on calories.

This was good and easy, and I'd definitely make it again. The root vegetables make this interesting and unexpected; they give the dish a little bite. To those who thought it was boring, there are two things that are important to this dish: good-quality Gruyere and salt. The root vegetables and cream/milk don't have much flavor without these ingredients, so be sure to use them. Most gratin dishes require liberal salting between layers.

Maybe it was because I doubled the recipe to bring as a Thanksgiving dish, but the milk and cream didn't thicken that well. I had to cook it almost twice as long to get it to condense. I would recommend using a Cuisinart to slice the vegetables. That saved a lot of time. I wasn't that impressed with this recipe even after it thickened up. I think it needed some additional ingredients to make it more flavorful.

While it was a very delicious dish..the preparation time was awful. Made it for 15 adults for Thanksgiving. It took two of us almost five hours to slice and dice. If I ever do it again I will purchase presliced begetables.

I think this is a fantastic way to use these vegetables and while I will make this again, I didn't fall in love with this recipe. Definitely could use a little more seasoning in my opinion.

This dish has become a Thanksgiving staple for our family. Every year we go on a hunt for the magazine we originally found it in, can't explain why, so glad to find it here.

My husband & I both enjoyed this dish. I didn't have the greyere cheese on hand so I substituted with parmesan, which was good, but I'm sure the greyere cheese adds a richer flavor. Look forward in trying again following the original recipe. (also added a little slice onion)

A real hit. We had it for Thanksgiving dinner but I think a dish this good didn't get as much attention as it deserved. Will try again when there are fewer things for it to compete with. Use the real Gruyere. I think a dash of cayenne or paprika on the top would not hurt if I try this again, more for color then flavor.

I get asked to make this so many times, I am tired of making it. Must make sure you get the water out of the vegetables. Don't try to save fat by reducing the cream. Doesn't give the full flavor

After several years of trying other dishes for Thanksgiving, I made this again this year and it was again a huge hit. I added chopped fresh thyme which worked well. This is really a favorite of everyone's.

People who "hate" rutabagas, enjoyed this recipe.

Excellent flavor, simple to prepare with a slicing blade and next time I may reduce the cholesterol. Definitely company worthy and the advanced preparation is a bonus.

Very good company dish. I used butternut squash in place of rutabaga since the store only had huge rutabagas. I used very good gruyere and then cut the fat by using fat free evaporated milk and half-and-half. I'm making for Thanksgiving and will cut veggies into cubes for ease of serving.

I found this to be great stuff!! As a maker of yukon/gruyere gratin, i fells this is great replacement. good texture and more interesting flavor. i think next time might sprinkle in some chopped scallions for a little color .. great with mixed greens and herb roasted chicken. make your grandparents proud, eat more root veggies!!

I've got a spouse who would normally turn his nose up at things like rutabagas and turnips; he devoured this.

A fantastic hit at Thanksgiving - even those who were not fans of root vegetables before.

This was wonderful! Believe it or not I cooked it on my gas grill. I had no oven room left so I put it out there on a low grill for about 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect!

I am missing a forth fork ONLY because I just can't call root veggies "beyond compare" but my guests last year thought this dish was wonderful. I made it originally as a concession to the one turnip lover in the family and it was so popular with everyone else too that it has been requested again this year.

This dish is very good but with all the calories and fat, how could it not be? For Thanksgiving, maybe you can splurge. What is nice is the combination of the vegetables so it doesn't taste like any one thing. Otherwise, this is a classic gratin, heavy and cheese-intensive. Use good ingredients to make the difference.
