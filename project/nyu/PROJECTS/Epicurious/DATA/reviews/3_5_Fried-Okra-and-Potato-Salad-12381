This was awesome! I had to hide it before dinner so I wouldn't eat it all myself.

We made it! Actually at about the same time. In fact, my husband, who is not a cook, made this recipe because he loves okra so much. I like it a lot also, and this recipe was a revelation because the okra in it is totally unlike regular fried or what you get in gumbos. It adds a crunchiness that is just great. He's going to make it again and that's why we looked up the recipe. Make it - it's great - it sounds so simple and not special but it's really good.

Too bad that in 11 years no one has ever tried this very southern dish. Colorful, unusual, tasty. We liked it quite a bit. I did add some chopped green onion because I like onion. 9-9-02 I made this dish again Saturday night. There was less than a half cup left of a double batch - but other dishes made for the same party had lots left over. This is just so good. It was even good the next morning. I prefer equal parts honey and vinegar in the mayo. Somebody besides me needs to try it! Also, toss the sliced okra in a lightly beaten egg white before tossing in the cornmeal. The coating will stick nicely. You don't need an inch of oil either, maybe 1/3 inch is fine. TIP: If your skillet is hot before you add the oil you can use less oil and the food won't stick.
