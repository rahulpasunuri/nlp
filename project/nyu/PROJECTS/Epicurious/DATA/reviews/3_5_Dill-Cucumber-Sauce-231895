very good, would serve again. Great over grilled salmon.

It's basic and good, but the cayenne us overpowering - just a pinch or white pepper instead would be better. Greek Yogurt instead of mayo/sour cream worked really well and cut the fat significantly.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it just wasn't a big hit in my house. It was OK, but we found it no better than something you could but at the market.

This sauce was fantastic paired with salmon! I also used it as a dip for fresh vegetables. I have made it with light sour cream and light mayonnaise and the flavor is still great.
