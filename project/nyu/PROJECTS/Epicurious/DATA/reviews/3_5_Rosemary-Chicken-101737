Recipes have evolved over the years, but the basics are always the same. I enjoy the old recipe books, they make you appreciate what we have now. The chicken is good and the lump of butter is whatever you think a lump is... more or less, that's cooking ;-)

I'm a seasoned chef and while I understand the recipe only because I've cooked a chicken a gazillion times, I found it unclear for anyone who is a novice or even mildly experienced. It doesn't have cooking times or what temperature to cook it. Sorry James but I can't think of a more poorly written recipe.

Still trying to connect the video of brining a turkey with the recipe for roasting the chicken.

I didn't make this recipe because I don't find it complete. As a new cook, I have no idea how much a lump is, at how many degrees to roast this chicken and for how long. All of the left over details had to be checked elsewhere.

"A lump of butter" seems to have given some reviewers fits... but I see it as carte blanche to use lots of butter! And plenty of salt, and whatever else seems like a good idea (like the cut up lime in the cavity). I used lots of rosemary, too, before it freezes... because I don't feel like bringing it in the house, weighed down as I am with butter! I may see old James any day now, and will tell him I loved his recipe.

This recipe is excellent! Obviously it's not a low-cal recipe. The people who complained about that should realize that most true chefs use butter, whole milk or cream, etc in their recipes. It's very easy to adapt to fit any diet.

Butter or no....this was wonderful. I also added a half of a lime inside, a few whole peppercorns, and 3 crushed cloves of garlic. It is sad, however, that some people feel the need to bad-mouth the dead. This is about food, not how people live. If you don't like it, don't eat it. =]

The chicken itself was very good. This chicken smells good before you even get it in the oven. The aroma of rosemary in the house was amazing. I added some of the butter/rosemary mixture under the skin as well. I also stuffed the chicken with two halves of a medium onion to close the cavity, along with the rosemary sprigs. I made a gravy from the pan juices by combining a Tbl of butter and a Tbl of flour, then increased volume with 1 and 1/2 cups of chicken stock. The gravy was out of this world. I'd definitely make this again.

FANTASTIC. James was a wonderfull chef who believed in also improvising ,of course, as any great cook knows. I see a lot of complaints about the butter content. Well...you can use less. The main thing is the use of rosemary. James Beard was a fantastic cook and who ever has nothing better to say about him then how much he weighed when he died, probably complains about everything. I would definately serve this again. THANKS JAMES!!!

A lump of butter & melted butter with rosemary. And that's a problem? So--what is a lump of butter? My guess about 1 tablespoon. Divided by 4. Four servings, that is. And the problem is----? I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil. MMMMM! He may have weighed over 300 pounds, but we can figure out how to make this healtier. Right? It's not rocket science!

Ugh!! Too much butter and not enough rosemary... About 9 Rosemary twigs would be sufficient. These twigs tied by kitchen twine under the wings and legs of the chicken. Additionally stuff the cavity with rosemary, a lime quatered, garlic, salt and pepper. Place rosemary under skin and season with garlic, salt and pepper. Instead of butter brush olive oil over chicken. Then cook. Taste the difference!!!!!!!!!!

To Cook from Kenmore,WV: James Beard is dead. He must have weighed well over 300 lbs at the time of his death. Probably died from clogged arteries...He loved fatty food. He became a prominent chef and cookbook writer at a time when fat grams did not concern most Americans.

Yee Gods! More butter? I swear that's all the man knows how to do, smother EVERYTHING with butter. I bet he eats about 50 pounds a month...

This recipe is so simple with great results. I'm sure you can add other spices to your taste but I stuck with the basic recipe and it was great. Don't forget to make gravey with the drippings very good.

This is ALWAYS a hit with the Hubby. I add a little dry white wine to my basting sauce as well as a little salt and pepper. I also roast new potatoes in the basting sauce and it is the PERFECT side dish. A small salad, warm french bread, and a glass of white wine is all you need to complete this meal and it's VERY servable to company!

Absolutely great. Also used a few sprigs of thyme and some lemon zest in the cavity. A real keeper and simple from start ot finish.
