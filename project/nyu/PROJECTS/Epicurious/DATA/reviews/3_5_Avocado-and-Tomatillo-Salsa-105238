I made this and put it over ahi tuna. My husband said it was one of the best meals I ever made in our marriage! I will definitely make again.

This was the first time I made a raw tomatillo salsa. I took the advice of another reviewer, adding a garlic clove to the blender then some chopped onion, cilantro, juice of 1/2 lime and a diced plum tomato with the avocado. Could have used another jalapeno.

Rick Bayless made this salsa on his show Mexico One Plate at A time. He roasted fresh tomillos in the broiler and roasted the jalapenos and garlic in an iron skillet. I tried and this salsa is wonderful! I would make it again.

I just returned from a vacation in Mexico, where a fantastic (Mexican) cook named Cecelia shared a variation of this recipe with me, along with tips for using the salsa in other dishes. So whether or not you liked the recipe above, I suggest trying it this way... Put 10 or 12 husked tomatillos, 1 jalapeno pepper, and 4 serrano peppers with 1 or 2 teaspoons of sugar and a few small pieces of white onion in a large pot of boiling water. Boil until the tomatillos change color, from their original bright green to an olive green. Puree the boiled tomatillos and peppers (stems removed) in a blender with 2 or 3 cloves of raw garlic (chopped), about half of a medium white onion (chopped), a bunch of cilantro (leaves and stems, to taste), a teaspoon or two of powdered chicken boullion, and salt to taste. You may wish to use more or fewer peppers, depending on how much heat you like; I find it's pretty hot with 4 serranos and 1 jalapeno. This 'salsa verde' is great on chips, but also works really well in other settings; try adding to the broth for a vegetable soup, or cook some lean ground beef with onions and garlic, adding the salsa and chopped fresh mint for the last couple minutes of cooking. Ceci, if you see this, thanks for the cooking lesson & recipes!

This is basic Tex-Mex table sauce, or taqueria sauce, but for some reason, the cooks at Gourmet never quite get Mexican food. The cook from Lynnwood, WA is much closer to the real thing. If you boil the tomatillos in water for a few minutes like the Mexicans do (you can include the jalapenos if you like) the sauce will taste much better. The boiling improves the flavor of the tomatillos and cuts down their acidity. Add a few more jalapenos. Then follow the Lynnwood recipe (I like cilantro, but not to excess since it tends to take over), add a little cominos (cumin) and que bueno, the real thing!

Somehow this was lacking something. It was ok, but has potential to be great. Will have to rethink.

this was a great dip and it only took a few minutes to make. I was nervous about the hot pepper but it really wasn't very hot at all.

My version of Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa starts off like the one listed above with the addition of 2 cloves of garlic, chopped and add to the food processor along with the peppers and tomatillos. Process and pour into serving bowl and stir in the onions (I use 1/2 C. onions), salt, 1/2 cup chopped cilantro, give or take, (depends on if you like cilantro, I try to get away with as much as I can) the juice of half a lime and on occasion, a seeded diced tomato. All who try my salsa beg for the recipe! My version IS 4 forks. Let me know if you agree.

I served this salsa at a 4th of July B-B Q and it was a huge hit. My guests polished it off , then asked for the recipe. It was delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing, unless you are making it for those that don't like it "hot ". In that case, don't add the jalapeno seeds.

We like it I added a little garlic powder and black pepper.
