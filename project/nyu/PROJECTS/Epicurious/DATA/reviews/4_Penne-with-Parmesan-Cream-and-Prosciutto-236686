Made this with multicolored fusilli. Amazing comfort food.

My kids loved this. They gobbled up every bite on their plates and then begged to have the leftovers packed for lunch at school the next day. I did change it a little bit. I didn't want to buy more than a pint of heavy cream, so I only used 2 cups and then reduced the cheese to 1 cup. I also increased the prosciutto to 4 oz. but otherwise didn't change a thing. It turned out perfectly!

Fantastic, quick & easy dish. Followed the suggestions and added additional cream. Also added some frozen peas and green beans to sneak in some veggies and some hot pepper flakes for a little spice. Best part was leftovers were even better!!

Fantastic. Super easy, tastes way better than you think it would with such few ingredients. I used a mix of Asiago and Parmesan, which worked well. Kids love this pasta. Definitely not low fat.

I read a few of the reviews & decided to bump up the recipe a bit... and I don't regret it! I increased the cheese mixture by: adding almost a 1/3more heavy cream (not milk), and the cheese by almost 2/3. I browned the prosciutto in a pan 1st (3oz not 2), removed it from the pan, than sauteed a medium shallot and three generous handfuls of cremini mushrooms in the fat from the meat browning. I also added fresh ground black pepper & red pepper flakes (Turkish Biber to be exact which is my fav red pepper to cook with. A great sweet flavor similar to Guaillio but with a hefty kick like standard red pepper flakes). I made this for friends & served with a salad, fresh warm Italian loaf, and a light Zinfandel for the premier of Lost & the lot of us we were stuffed & happy for 2 hours!

This was very simple and good... I do agree that more liquid should be considered, however. It was very nice exactly as written, but I have also made it adding an extra cup of 1% milk to the cream already called for as well as adding just a dash or two of red pepper flakes. I would serve with either peas or a salad so you can incorporate vegetables and not feel as guilty about such a carb heavy dish. Nice.

I made this again tonight for New Year's Eve and I want to say that it's an awesome recipe, but I suggest adding another cup or so of cream. The amount given is not enough. Also, I sauteed the prosciutto before adding it to the dish, which brought out its great flavor. Finally, it's all about the quality of the cheese and the prosciutto. Don't use the cheap stuff.

I've made this twice, the first time exactly as the recipe states, and it was delicious as is. The second time I added red chile pepper flakes, and it was outstanding! I will always add the chile pepper from now on. Enjoy!

Very quick and easy. I even used some soy milk that I was trying to use up and it tasted delicious. This is a good recipe because it is hard to mess up and easy to improvise with.

I really loved this dish, but it wasn't as creamy as I liked, so I doubled the amount of cream they suggest. Once I did that, I thought it was exceptional. It was easy to make and ready quickly.

I made this with 1/2 cup less parmesan and used trader joe's prosciutto from Germany and it was too salty and too smokey for my taste, and I usually like salty food. I, also added a sauted onion and green bell pepper for texture.

My family and I loved this -- even my 4-year old. I gave it the full 4 stars because it was SO EASY and YUMMY. Can't beat that on a work night!

Really, really good and easy. Made just as directed except used half and half instead of cream.

Awesome, easy dish! Used half pesto penne, which worked well. Really need a low, wide baking dish to get the crunchies on top.

I substituted about 3/4 of a cup with non fat milk, still very rich and very tasty. I also added a handful of mozzarella I had leftover. Served it with salad and it was perfect!

We sauteed four cloves of garlic and some sun dried tomatoes then added them to the sauce prior to baking with the pasta. Very good!

If you would like a little more flavor try adding some nutmeg and lemon zest.

This was good but was expecting it to be better... I made the recipe in half and don't know if that's why it came out kind of dry. I also added several cloves of minced garlic to it, which enhanced the flavor but would have liked it a little creamier.

Very simple and rich. I added a bit of fresh garlic. I agree that the amount of sauce looked excessive before baking, but it was the perfect amount. Perfect as a side dish, but a bit too rich for a main course.

Very easy and good - not great. I thought it was a tad boring. If I'm eating this much fat I want it to knock my socks off. Maybe it needs a bit of blue cheese or something for a little more punch? If I were to make this again I would not heat the parmesan with the cream, I would stire it into the pasta after I add the cream because a lot of my parmesan ended up stuck to the bottom of the cream pan and the pasta pot and it made for an annoying clean up.

I changed it up a bit... I used bowtie pasta instead of penne and bacon instead of proscuito (that is what I had at home) I cooked the bacon separately and put it aside. I then sauted the chicken in some olive oil with galic, red onions, green onions, and sun dried tomatoes (dried). Tossed it all togheter with the bacon, pastas and sauce then baked in the oven. It was so amazing. Also great as a leftover.

I made this last night as a side dish for 8 adults. It was very easy and very good. I worried at first that there was too much sauce when I first put it in the oven, but it was the perfect the amount to keep it from drying out. I broiled mine longer than what the recipe called for.
