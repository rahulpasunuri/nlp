Great marinade, inspires variation ideas. Ribs were good too. Possibly will follow lead of other reviewers and add some honey next time. I was confused about some reviews saying they wouldn't bake the ribs. Where in the recipe does a baking component occur. I didn't see one. Confused.

Nice and spicy! I made these for dinner tonight and my husband and I both really liked them. I did like some of the other reviewers suggested and skipped the baking step. I broiled them and served them with yuca. I also reduced the marinade to make a thicker sauce after taking out the ribs. Might try this on beef ribs sometime too.

Well, I ruined that large package of boneless country ribs. Did not make any changes to the ingredients and marinated overnight. I did, however, followed many of the reviewers with baking the ribs in marinade (completely covered in foil and swimming in the marinade) at 300 degrees for 1.25 hours and left them in the sealed package to cool for another 20 minutes. Dry, dry, dry. So, I did not bother to grill them to jerky level. I offered them for Super Bowl and not much of the pork was touched. Additionally, it was way too spicy for me since I'm a wimp, but others mentioned it had a nice flavor and was acceptable on the spice level. I still have another package and I may try a small amount grilled instead.

This receipe might be good, but it is not Chilean. I'm Chilean and this isn't anything I would consider traditional. Misleading.

Great ribs! The marinade is a real winner. Have used it in variety of pork dishes and it's always a hit.

I have never written a review before, but wow. This is by far my favorite marinade. It's complex and flavorful and works with anything. Loved it on the country ribs the first time (don't bake first! just grill) and have enjoyed the leftovers on chicken and fish and even as a quick sauce for steamed veggies. Yum.

An easy, festive bbq with serious flavor. Followed precisely except subbed chives for scallions and added 3 tbsp brown sugar. Cooked on the BBQ over coals. Will try again, next time will trim fat (it won't melt on the barby) and will cook to ~160 instead of 170 (oops).

Followed ingredient list with some minor changes: used 1 C. red wine vinegar and 1/2 C. apple cider vinegar; 1 heaping tablespoon dried oregano (don't care for fresh oregano for some reason), and added two tablespoons honey to balance acidity. Aroma and flavor are sublime! Used broiler (low setting) in upper third of oven, flipping twice until nicely caramelized, about 20 min. total. NOTE: to avoid dry, tough meat, do NOT bake these first!!! Country style ribs are generally cut from the blade end of the loin, and do best with quick- cook methods like grilling, broiling, sauteeing, and stir frying.

Made these last night, they were delicious, all you have to do is follow the recipe and they come out tender and juicy with plenty of flavor.

Was good and spicy. Lacked depth. Needed some sort of sweet component to even it out. Perhaps some maple syrup or catsup?

Fantastic flavor! Marinated baby back ribs for only 4 hours. Baked in a loose foil package at 350 degrees for an hour then grilled for 15 minutes on medium fire, turning several times and basting with remaining sauce. Next time, will try to marinate over night but even 4 hours turned out super-flavorful ribs.

Ok I was concerned it would be too dry but tried the 400 degree 1.25 hour baking first and it was unbelievable. Served it to real foodies who raved. Only change I made was to use the jarred jalapeños which I rinced then threw in the blender.

This is only the 2nd time I've taken the time to write a review but I loved this recipe so much that I felt compelled to do so! The recipe is perfect and very easy! Just remember to marinade the night before. I used the leftover reserved marinade for chicken the next night and loved it just as much. I'm sharing this recipe with my friends!

I used 6lbs boneless country style, increased the garlic and used the whole can. I worried about the heat but it was perfect; not too hot or spicy. The marinade makes them very tender so no need to pre-cook or use indirect grill method, just follow the recipe. I made Arepas with cheese and it was prefect with a simple Arugula salad.

I love to braise meat and do it all the time. I followed the suggestions on the board and baked the pork in the two cups of sauce at 350 degress for 1 1/2 hours and the ribs were very dry. I put them on the grill anyway, and of course that didnt do any good. Maybe it's me. Love the flavor, though.

Fabulous. I love BBQ and have travelled far and wide in search of good 'cue but the taste of this dish was unique. Of all the things I made for the Fourth of July this was the biggest hit and most people said they didn't eat pork but they were gorging themselves. A really easy dish to do and a unique taste. Remember to use indirect heat so the sauce does not become burnt and it can then infuse the meat.

Following others' recommendations I first baked these in a slow oven, then briefly grilled. Result: tender, moist and flavorful! I have tried them by grilling first: they were tougher and lacked a little of the flavor. Excellent recipe!

I rated this a 3 and said I'd make again for rating puposes, but on a leap of faith. I followed a former raters recomendations and baked the ribs (at 300 degrees) first to make them tender (using boneless pork ribs (braising) ))covered in the marinade for an 1 1/2 hours and just grilled for the barbeque effect and I created beef jerky. The result was very dry. Follow the recipe, I like the marinade. On a very high note, I made a mexican pasta dish from this site call macroni with cream and cheese. Made with pablano chiles and serrano chiles.........feta and I made with sour cream

Wow! This is by far the best bbq pork ribs I have ever had! We loved it- still talking about it this morning after gorging ourselves last night! So easy, but really outstanding-can't wait for summer weather to have a patio party and serve these! Really beyond compare to anything else bbq!Loved it!

My wife, who doesn't care for ribs or spicey dishes, loved it! I substituted shallots for the scallions, used boneless country style ribs, and pre-baked them covered in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours before throwing them on the grill.

I've been in a trying-new-recipes frenzy, particularly since I'm going low-carb & I'm tired of eating the same ol' stuff. Over the weekend, I tried 3 new marinades, with this being one. I made it exactly as written, cooking on a gas grill. It was AWESOME!!! My hubby raved about it, even though he hates mustard--he never detected it!! What he doesn't know, won't hurt him!! Will definitely make this over & over again, using different meats, too. Highly recommend--EASY!!!

through bad planning I discovered the following trick: - make the marinade. If you're using big country-style ribs you might want to cut them in half. I also made it once using a mix of country-style and cut-up baby back ribs. - heat the oven to 400, put the ribs in a roasting pan and cover them with the marinade (they should be swimming in it), cover well with foil, and bake for 1.25 hrs until the meat is very tender - take them out of the marinade and let them drain a bit for dryer ribs, or leave them in - when it's time to eat, put them on the grill and sear the outsides, then serve - keep the marinade/roasting juices in the fridge and scrape off the considerable amount of solid fat - use the remaining juices for a wonderful spicy onion/pork soup (leftover grilled onions, leftover pulled rib meat) I love this recipe.

I thought 7 oz of chipotles and adobo sauce would be too spicy, next time I'll use it all.

My husband was doing the induction phase of the Atkins diet and this dish was perfect. Although I missed the usual sweet element that ribs have, this recipe was still delicious.

If you are looking for something easy that has great flavor, give this one a shot. It got rave reviews from my fellow diners. I used canned jalapenos in a tomato sauce, and it's a good thing I did. We used the extra marinade for another meal the following day. It has just the right amount of kick and the smokey flavor of the chipotle is excellent.

really enjoyed the ribs. and had leftovers the next night, just as good, maybe better, than the first night. used boneless country ribs. pretty much followed the recipe, but using what i had available. did not add extra salt/pepper to marinade. dried oregeno, sweet onion, and jalapeno from a jar.

This is just to say something about the name, you should call them 'chili country ribs', the other name, 'chilean' is related to Chile, the country in Southamerica
