This was really good! I actually made it for a Jamaican themed dinner party to go with pork. Must admit I added a whipped egg and butter then baked for 45 minutes. Topped with toasted coconut. Really good!

so good and so easy. 1st saw this reading Gourmet @ my hairdressers in 2008. I rushed to epicurious and have been making this for Thanksgiving ever since.

The coconut flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would have been. A good side dish to pork tenderloin. Good consistency.

These are exceptionally tasty and so easy to make. I highly recommend trying this one. The texture is creamy and the flavor is slightly sweet. So good!

I made these this morning for Thanksgiving tomorrow and they are so delicious! I probably could have used just 2 Tbs of brown sugar and they'd still be delicious. Actually, I held a cup of potatoes on the side and just put in some coconut milk for my Dad who can't have a lot of sugar, and they still taste great. I found the potatoes were smooth enough for my taste without pureeing them, since we're not doing a super-fancy menu. Yum!

Delish! Bought my Gourmet, ran home and made this. Superb. I made it exactly as the recipe called for it, but when I do it for Thanksgiving, which I most certainly will, I plan to serve it like duchesse potatoes with a bit of toasted shredded coconut on the top.
