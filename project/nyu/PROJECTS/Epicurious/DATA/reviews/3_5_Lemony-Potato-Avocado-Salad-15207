This was a really big hit at the dinner table the other night. I had the family over for dinner and they really liked this one, but what's not to like it's potatoes & avocado! Really good, I'm glad I tried it.

Samples of this salad were given at the Harvard Medical School cafeteria in their periodic healthy recipe samplings. It's delicious, and simple to make. I used slightly less olive oil than called for, used scallions instead of chives, added a bit of lime juice because I didn't have enough lemon, and threw in a bit of cilantro.

Addiang cherry tomatoes to this adds color and acidity that is welcome.

I made this last night and only changed the chives for green onions. My husband took one bite and told me to buy more! He was shocked that I had made that in the little time I was home! Haha! So easy and super tastey. Will be making this again and again!

A fantastic mayo-free option for potatoes! Made it with small while potatoes instead of red, left out the olive oil (the avocado is rich enough), and used dill instead of chives. i took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and added cumin and cayenee at the end. Definitely a keeper.

A standard that I have been making for years. Always receives raves from guests and have shared the recipe many times. Creamy goodness without mayo. Excellent with grilled foods. Summer in a bowl.

this is a really good simple light potato salad that like others have said, is a great alternative to the traditional stuff. But it is light, so you have to enjoy subtle flavors. I followed the advice of some of the others and added green onions and it was great. I also added some chopped egg on top and loved it that way.

Add me to this one's fan club! Great for those who don't like mayonnaise, sour cream or yoghurt dressings. I soaked the potatoes in the dressing for 1/2 hr before adding the avocado which I sprinkled with extra lemon juice to prevent it browning. Also used the minced green onions as suggested rather than the chives, for extra bite. As noted by an earlier cook, this doesn't keep, so don't make more than you need. This will be a regular on our table!

Add me to this one's fan club! Very easy and tasty. Great for those who don't like mayonnaise, sour cream or yoghurt dressings. I let the pototoes soak in the dressing for about 1/2 hr before adding the avocado, which I sprinkled with a little extra lemon to help stop it browning. I also used finely minced green onions rather than chives for a bit more bite. Everyone loved it, but as someone else said, it doesn't keep so don't make more than you need. This will be regular on our table.

What a terrific potato salad! As suggested by another reviewer, I added minced shallots. I also pre-cut the potatoes in 1/2 pieces, and steamed them as they cook faster that way. I tossed the avocado in lemon juice first, then mixed and tossed everything. So easy and so delicious and pretty! A real keeper.........

This is a no fail dish - eveyone thus far has raved about it, and the ratios have changed ever so slightly each time I have made it. Some days I didn't have as much lemon as I would have liked, some fewer potatos than I thought I needed. No matter, this is a great basic recipe that transends extremely well and rolls with the punches, will make it again and again. Even better when allowed to sit for a good amount of time for the flavors to meld.

This was one mighty tasty potato salad and really easy to make. I've made it three times already and one of the guests I served it to has made it twice and another has made it once. My tinkerings: I added one chopped shallot for just a little more texture and taste. I also substitute Yukon gold potatoes. My ratio is one potato and half avocado per person. It's my new potato salad for the summer! One caveat, though. It doesn't keep. As good as it is the first day is as bad as it is the second day.

This is a great salad! I made it for four people by using 10 small potatoes and a full 1/2 c. of lemon juice (1 lemon). I also added 1/2 t. of cumin, which I will add EVERY time I make this. My friends loved it!

This recipe was simple and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fine --delish!!!

Tastes good, but not special. The flavor seems a little flat or one-dimensional. With the avocado and chives, and without gobs of mayo, it does look more elegant than your average potato salad.

Simple. Elegant. Fabulous. It's perfect for company.

Fresh and delicious. Perfect for the picnic-for- two that I planned. I added garlic, cilantro, and chopped up jalapenos (fresh, not canned) to the salad to give it a little kick. I agree with the other reviewer. I thought 6 small potatoes seemed like a small serving size so I cooked 12. Along with the avocado, this was way too much for two people in one sitting, but we saved it for later! Also, to the reviewer that commented on the mushiness of the recipe: How mushy the potatoes come out depend on how long you cook it -- adjust times if necessary. I test potatos out by poking a fork into them while boiling to see how starchy they are.

The taste was fine but the texture wasn't great. A bit too mushy.

Highly recommended. It knocked everyone out at my BBQ, and I received raves about it for weeks afterward. I followed the recipe and added nothing extra - the avocado makes it rich and satisfying, while the lemon balances the richness. Yum!

I made this dish to take to a neighborhood party b/c I had several avocados on hand. I added bacon, a little cayenne pepper, a bit extra lemon zest & juice--it was great! Lots of folks at the party commented on the dish and asked for the recipe. The best part...it was so simple!!

Splendid! Easy and delicious - brings out the flavor of a good potato with very little preparation. I used Yukon Golds.

This is a great salad! It took about 2 minutes to make once the potatoes were ready. If you like lemons and avocados, you would love it! I will definitely be making it for my friends.

Great summery salad. I have made this recipe six or seven times since I found it. I double the lemon and chives for a little more kick. What a great way to use avocado and potatoes! Excellent texture combination.

This potato salad is delicious. We first had it a friend's house, and now we make it ourselves.

This wasn't quite as marvelous as I expected it to be, but still good. It seems at first like 3/4 lb of potatoes won't be enough for two people, but chopped with the addition of the avocado it makes two very large servings.
