Made this as a tryout for a bigger party later in the month, and despite missteps -- first batch of praline was too done; overcooked the cookies -- these were terrific. I'm not sure overbaking the bars hurt -- they were crunchy, with, with the ice cream (homemade vanilla), was perfect. I halved the recipe but will make a full batch for a bigger group.

These were good. Chewy, creamy, salty sweet... yum. However, I agree that there is an issue with the salt. I don't know if there is too much salt, or if the problem is with distribution. I followed the directions and tossed the pecans with the salt. This doesn't work. The salt settles to the bottom, and when you mix the pecans in with the melted sugar, all the salt ends up in one place, and is difficult to mix in. I would use salted nuts in the future and omit the salt (or sprinkle the salt in the melted sugar before adding the pecans...?). Overall, it's a great recipe. It just needs a little tweaking for the salt.

These are just phenomenal. I have made them several times, and everybody always asks for the recipe. I also double the praline, which, with my kids picking at it as I make it, leaves just the right amount for the cookies. A huge hit with both adults and kids.

Delicious!! I followed Malibu's advice and doubled the praline and although it was a lot, I thought it was perfect (really, is there such a thing as too much praline?). The saltiness is part of what makes it so yummy. It was a real pain to cut though, even with a knife soaked in hot water.

This is one of my favorite recipes from Gourmet. Coarsely chopped pecans look better, but the taste is really great nonetheless. Totally worth the effort!

Oops, one more thing. I would double the praline recipe. It's not enough as is.

These were good & easy, but if you finely chop the praline, it doesn't look like the Gourmet picture. That's a medium chop, since the finely chopped praline disappears into the cookie base. A bit too salty, next time I'll try 1 tsp salt. Because my family wanted to immediately eat dessert, I didn't soften the ice cream. Instead I used a wide metal spatula to slice it.

These were very tasty and easy to make. However, they are a little too sweet and the recipe makes a lot, so make sure you have lots of people over to help finish them (although our leftovers are still good after a week in the freezer)

I was looking for an ice cream dessert recipe for a dinner party when this month's Gourmet arrived with this recipe. It was beyond delicious. My husband, who is not a big sweets eater, went back for seconds. I made half the recipe (it makes a huge amount and plus I only had one jelly roll pan) and had leftovers (not that I"m complaining) There are quite a few steps but nothing is difficult and the results are worth it.
