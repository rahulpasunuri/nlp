This was a perfect addition to a big ole Thanksgiving table because it was fresh and unique among the dishes. I used frozen mango & corn so I could quickly prepare it the day of our event. Big hit! Would be great in summer also.

We loved it just as is. Refreshing and bright flavor. I did first cut the kernels from the cob, then cooked in small amount of water only 2-3 minutes, then drained. I thought it seemed easier than cooking the whole cob then removing the kernels. I do think its better to NOT overcook the corn, though - I think you want the corn firm and crisp.

Wonderful taste and color. Add minced jalapeno, you won't regret! Serve with fish or poultry. Use leftovers to enhance a protein or top a lettuce salad. Uses are endless.

I've made this recipe many, many times and have had rave reviews. The only thing I do add, however, is fresh cracked pepper. This is a fantastic summer salad and just as wonderful as the watermelon & feta with lime that I also have served many times in the summer!!!

This was REALLY good. I made a few adjustments, as recommended by previous reviewers. I added an orange bell pepper and avocado, and I used a peach in addition to the mango because I only had one mango. I basically cut the recipe into a fourth and I had enough for 3-4 servings. I paired this with "Korean Barbecued Beef" recipe from epicurious and also made some baked tortilla chips (whole wheat tortillas cut into squares, brushed with oil and sprinkled with salt and Chinese Five-Spice, baked in the oven at 400 degrees until crispy). It made for an excellent meal! This salsa would be great for summer cookouts or potlucks.

Very good! The store didn't have enough jicama so I added some broccoli slaw and it worked perfect. I also added a little orange juice to the dressing which was a nice touch.

I think that this is a simple, healthy, tasty dish that would make a great side for spring and summer. I made it as a weeknight meal with the Crab Tostadas recipe that is on this site. The only addition I made was a bit of minced jalapeno because I already had it on hand. This entire recipe easily serves at least ten healthy portions.

Everyone I served this to loved it, and it made an enormous amount of salad so I served it over the course of about three days. I did not like the potency of the onion, myself, and would cut back on some of that next time.

Served it at a BBQ. It was a real hit.

This is a great summer salad, and unlike some othres, I found it keeps quite well. It's a giant recipe! I used slightly less-than-ripe mangoes so they would be easy to chop and would keep better. I chopped the mango and jicama using a 1/8 inch julienne blade on a mandolin, and it was a big time-saver. I also really like the look. I served drizzled with a little bit of peanut and sesame oils, and some sliced almonds.

Wonderful! Refreshing and healthy. I can't believe it tastes so good with no fat in it.

A very good recipe. I made it for a Mexican themed dinner and while it did make a lot, everyone loved it and there wasn't much left! I would add some cumin and go fairly heavy on the freshly ground pepper, but otherwise it was great. Jicama is a new favourite vegetable...

Totally worth all the manual labor that goes into preparing the ingredients for this salad. I gave some to my parents and they used it as salsa. I just ate it as a stand-alone dish and it was wonderful. I omitted the cilantro and used Italian parsley insead. This salad is heaven.

I have been making this dish for years, and it's always wonderful. Tonight I am serving it with chili, just scrumptious. The only change I make is to roast the corn before I cut it off the cobs. If I do this on the grill, the browning of some of the kernels adds visual appeal and an extra layer of flavor. Also, not separating the kernels entirely when cutting off the cob is good for presentation. You will enjoy this thoroughly, especially if you have help prepping:).

The guests at my summer BBQ loved this salad. It takes a fair bit of time to make but it's refreshing and delicious on a hot summer day. I added a little extra sugar, and red wine vinegar.

I couldn't imagine how a dish with no sauce or real preparation could be rated so highly, but I love mangos and cilantro and wanted to try jicama. This was so delicious and fresh-tasting and crisp. I'll definitely make this for bbqs and pot-lucks. Everyone raved. It was more than the sum of its parts, I thought.

Rating: 3
I made this as a side dish to fajitas. I used frozen white corn (Wholefoods brand) instead of the unavailable fresh corn and it worked great. The only thing is that I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for seven people as a side dish (two of them men). Also, I'd suggest tossing it a day earlier and letting it sit in the fridge. Tasted better as a leftover.

I have made this dish twice for parties with RAVES, RAVES, RAVES!!! One guest had to take the rest home he loved it so much. I cannot tell you how good this is you will have to try it for yourself and you will know the ecstacy of mango, corn, jicama salad.

A new family favorite. Will have it often during mango season. I could not get any good fresh jicama so used peeled, seeded, chopped cucumber instead and it was delicious. When mango season ends I may even try it using fresh pineapple.

I made this salad the day ahead, and when I got to it a lot of the juices had drained and made the salad very watery. I also thought it tasted better the day I made it; the flavor wasn't nearly as good after it had marinated that long. Very labor intensive as well.

This was a crowd-pleaser! Easy to make ahead of time and colorful (I added some red pepper for that effect) for a BBQ. 5 people emailed me for the recipe. Yummy and healthy!

I was surprised at how much I like this salad. I served it with cheese enchiladas and wild rice, and it was great. I ended up eating the leftovers as a salsa with the enchiladas - even more tasty! I only used 2 ears of corn, 2 small mangos, and 1 jicama, and it still served 4 people amply. Cutting the recipe also makes it less labor intensive!

Wonderful and easy. Cut the recipe by 1/4 and you still have plenty for eight people. I agree it can and should be made ahead.

Love it love it!! Time consuming w/ all the chopping but if you have a food processor that will help. Easy, pleasing to the eye and just delicious!

this salad gets better with extended marinating time- best to make it at least 24-36 hours before serving.

Great recipe! Very simple and quick to make and yields rave reviews. Perfect for summer, light and refreshing and delicious, and good for you too! I loved it despite the fact that I didn't use jichima because mine ended up being rotten. I used some of the review tips and added 2 avocados plus 2 jalapenos and I think it made the recipe even better. Next time I'm looking forward to trying a little bit of tequila like one reviewer had, as well as find a fresh jichima.

I was really torn between rating this a three-fork versus a four-fork recipe. Made this for a recent party and received many raves. This salad was crisp, fresh and so very colorful. It's a WINNER!

When I first made this and tasted it I thought it needed a kick. I added some finely chopped serrano chili and a dash of tequila. It really made the dish for me. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 forks. Preparation was easy and quick.

This recipe has become my most requested recipe of all time. It is great for large parties, it's colorful and very different. I made it less labor intensive by using the frozen bags of shucked corn kernels from Trader Joes. My children love it also.

I absolutly loved this salad, as did everyone I have ever made it for. I have made it many times and has become a staple for us. It really adds some to leave the salad for a few hours to let the flavors meddle.

Made this dish to accompany the tamales for Christmas...it was very yummy...I loved the melding of sweet, tart and crunchy. Would be something I'd take for lunch in the summer too, as it is very refreshing.

My mother can't stand cilantro, and because she was among the guests, I omitted it. I think it dramatically affected the quality of the dish. I will try it again, this time using all the ingredients. (I used frozen corn kernels and they worked fine). This recipe IS a lot of work and it does make a lot of salad, so prepare it for a crowd!

I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted about 1 cup of corn for black beans and added 3 chopped jalepeno peppers. I made this salad for a Cinco de Mayo party that I was going to and got rave reviews from everyone at the party. Will definitely make this light & refreshing salad again.

I served this at my mom's birthday party to 30 people, and everyone loved the salad. It was light and refreshing! I agree that next time I'll add a little of cayene pepper.

I made it a day ahead, and it still wasn't very good. I added serrano peps, diced avocado, and black beans. That made it fairly good, but the recipe alone is blah.

This is a wonderful lowfat salad. I added just a small amount of cayenne pepper to give it just a bite a spicyness. DELICIOUS.

Rating: 3
I was a little leary of making this dish since I had never used jicama. The time estimate for preparing all the ingredients is right but well worth the effort. This dish definitely needs its refrigerator time for all the flavors to blend. Everyone loved this dish. Some of the guest even took home a sample for the next day. Next time I'll probably only make half the recipe.

This dish works well with everything from grilled salmon or chicken to providing a light sweet touch with spicy Mexican or Carribean menus. I am a personal chef and find that this is a favorite with many of my guests. They love the no fat aspect of the salad as well as the interesting blend of flavors. This one is a keeper!

Even the picky eater who was my dinner guest liked this salad. Next time I think I'll try a small pinch of cayenne to sharpen the flavor, and will serve it on lettuce to make it look more attractive.

This recipe made alot. I served seven people who each had seconds, and had enough to serve fourths. It was very good, a suprising flavor combination for some. The jicama adds a nice texture contrast to the mango and the corn.

I saved time by using 4 cups frozen corn, added two diced avocadoes, 1/4 cup olive oil, and 6 cups of spring mix lettuce then topped it with pumpkin seeds! This made enough for 12-14 people who all thought it very refreshing.
