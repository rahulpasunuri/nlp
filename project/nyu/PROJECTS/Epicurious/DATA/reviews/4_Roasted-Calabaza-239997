I made this using small pumpkin meant for cooking rather than a jack lantern. I made these changes in the recipe: I used olive oil spray to coat the pan and the cut up pumpkin. I sprinkled on some powdered cumin along with the sea salt. I toasted about a half a cup of coarsely chopped walnuts in butter and stirred them in. I had one pan full of cut pumpkin and it took about 30 minutes for them to cook. They looked wonderful and tasted even better. The lime juice was a good addition.
