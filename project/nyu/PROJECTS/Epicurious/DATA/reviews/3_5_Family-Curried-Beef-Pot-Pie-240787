With all the raves, I was expecting something better than this turned out to be. It was kind of dry and a bit too sweet for my taste, even though I used hot mango chutney. There was also too much potato. My husband liked it, but he has a sweet tooth and loves carbs. If I make it again, (doubtful) I'd make more sauce and eliminate the chutney and the potatoes.

I started with a chuck roast that I trimmed and cubed, and used as the base for doubling the recipe, because it yielded roughly 5 cups of cooked meat. I browned the beef, then added the onion, garlic, and ginger; when the onions were softened, I added the broth, curry, chutney (we like hot), cinnamon, salt and pepper, plus 2 pods of cardamon, and let it simmer slowly for about 45 min. When the meat was more tender, I added the vegetables, currents (didn't have raisins), and when they were just tender, I finished with the tomato, parsley and peas. I thickened with a roux of flour, butter and the excess broth. It all went into a deep casserole I covered with pastry out of the freezer (next time, I'll make my own). The result was aromatic, tender, and delicious, and the family rating was, "Make it again." Flavor-wise, the only real departure from the original was hot chutney, a touch of cardamom, and braising the beef with the aromatics, rather than using cooked beef. It was very good. Comfort food with rich flavor.

I meant to say "coriander", not cardamom...

Made this tonight with a few (okay a lot of) alterations and it was DELICIOUS!!!! The things I changed for convenience based on what was on hand were: Used double deep dish pie crust (top and bottom) instead of puff pastry. Addedd 1/2 c chopped green bell pepper to onions. Used frozen peas, carrots, and corn mixture instead of fresh and added them with the beef when the peas were supposed to be added. Used a mixture of ground beef/venison. Substituted apricot preserves, more curry and golden raisins, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and cardamom for mango chutney. Put tiny pats of butter under the top crust before baking, brushed crust with melted butter. I tried to stay true to the flavors in the original recipe without breaking the budget... this is a show-stopper!

Exceptionally lovely! I left out the pie part. Instead I added an extra cup of stock so I could dump in the leftover cooked rice I wanted to use up. A lovely, lovely dish. And easy to put together after work on the stove top too!

I liked this. I found it a little spicy due to the amount of curry, but that is just me. I didn't use the chutney. This was a great way for me to use up most of my roast and clean out my fridge too.

Found this recipe by searching for leftover pot roast. I don't typically cook with curry, but I had all ingredients and was anxious to try something different. I rolled out my pastry twice the size of an oval baking dish, then laid it in the bottom and folded over to cover the pie filling completely; then cut slits on top. I did not brush with egg. It looked beautiful out of the oven! The pie was delicious and quite different. What a great way to use up leftover pot roast!!! My husband loved it - and he prefers good ol' home cookin'. I did cut the curry to 2 tsp., rather than 2 tbsp. I substituted peach chutney, which I had on hand, for mango chutney. You should try this recipe. You won't be disappointed :)

This was very good. I made a pot roast with potatoes and carrots one night and then later used the leftover meat and veggies to make this pot-pie. I even used the leftover gravy from the pot roast and added to it with these ingredients to equal the 3 cups broth. It was very good and a great way to cook once, eat twice.

Very yummy! We used ground beef (500g - a bit over a pound), added a drained, rinsed can of kidney beans, used 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon instead of the sticks, and made a gluten-free pastry for both a top and bottom crust. Oh, and we left out the chutney b/c it had wheat in it...It was delicious! It fell apart quite easily so it wasn't very pretty to serve - next time we'll use individual pie pans for better presentation.

I've made this dish twice in two weeks, and my husband thinks we should have it regularly. I used a pound of ground beef (because I had it), cooked with a little garam masala, and substituted ground ginger for fresh. This filled a 2.2QT casserole dish for me, which is perfect for one sheet of frozen puff pastry. It is so easy and so wonderful. Even my two year old likes it.

I made the 'guts' and decided the puff pastry was no only too many calories, but too much work for the day I had ahead of me. Made it with frozen phyllo pastry I had on hand instead - folded into fairly large size triangles like a Spanakopita. Absloutely delicious! Served with salad. Great easy Monday night dinner. Definitely will make again.

My whole family loved it. I took my time after work to cook and they said it was worth the wait. I didn't have mango chutney, I substituted orange marmalade and substituted cinnamon power for the sticks and prepared pie crust for the puff pastry. This is a keeper.

this was phenomenal... definitely something different and absolutely delicious. we had mango chutney on the side rather than mixed into the feeling, where i think the flavor would have been lost. this has made our favorites list!!

I made this pie - it smelled wonderful while cooking. Took out of oven and put on rack to cool. Went out New Year's Day to see Polar Bear Swim and ... dog ate whole pie! I will make again however, as if it smells delicious ... it is delicious. Boo hoo.

This dish was very tasty. The combination of all the ingredients really put it all together. While the recipe is quite involved it is worth the effort for a treat once in a while. I used puff pastry shells and stuffed them with the filling which helped save time.
