I thought this was delicious!!! I made a tilapia dish that accompanied it. with lime, butter, chilies and butter. Also a Epicurious recipe.

I had a tube of polenta that I wanted to put together with mushrooms in a gratin, so I chose this recipe. The sauce tasted very good in the skillet, but the finished dish just did not come together for me. Perhaps if I had made fresh polenta, it would have been better, but since I did not finish one serving and threw the remainder out, I doubt I will try this again. There was not enough sauce to polenta ratio. I might consider using the sauce for something else. Perhaps grilled fish.

This recipe was good and got good reviews from those eating it. I did not add the oil to the polenta as called for in the recipe because I just couldn't bring myself to add that much fat and that many calories to our dinner. Especially when the polenta is going to be topped by cheese and the sauce anyway. I added a couple teaspoons of of garlic powder after reducing the sauce since it was a little bland. It could have used a second tomato as well.

this dish was excellent, though it took me a very long time to prepare (i need to get faster with cutting small pieces!). i may have overdone it with the pepper, so unlike the previous reviewer, mine had a LOT of kick. i also put in a second garlic clove and about 1-2 tbsp of white wine; i didn't include celery and i substituted vegetable stock for the meat stock. to make it a little easier, i used pre-cooked polenta-in-the-tube. i'll definitely make this again, though next time, i may cut the veggies the day prior.

This was an okay dish, though I think the bolognese needed more kick -- wine, a little extra salt, something . . . Smelled more appealing than it tasted. Not something I am interested in making again. My family's response (and they're appreciative eaters): Well, at least we're not hungry anymore!

I made a vegan version of this dish as a main course for a dinner party of 20 and both my vegan and meat-eating friends thought it was delicious. The polenta was a bit soft, but the taste was great.

I used a mixture of mushrooms, porcini, oyster and white button mushrooms. It's really a good way to have polenta.

One of my favorite ways to eat polenta. Since I am from the Aldo Adige region of Italy, I enjoy my polenta.

I have to disagree with the other reviewers of this recipe. While it was good, it was also somewhat bland and lackluster. The earthy mushrooms do nothing for the similarly earthy polenta, and I still prefer the the more traditional tomato sauce recipe. I made it precisely as written with homemade polenta and I served it as a side dish to a roasted beef tenderloin. I may try it again and increase the tomatoes because it may need more acidity.

This was fantastic food. Made it with farmer's market ground corn and roasted vegetable stock and it was the hit of the night. A wonderful vegetarian main course for a party.

Yum! Good recipe; the mushroom and Parmesan flavors come together very nicely. I used tubed polenta; next time I will try it from scratch. It can only get better!

I was a bit iffy about this recipe but it is really excellent. It would be great to make for vegetarian friends. It has a very satisfying, hearty flavor and was absolutely delicious. I modified by using premade polenta (the kind in a tube), I used one can of crushed tomatoes, and I pureed the sauce at the end to "disguise" the mushrooms so my children would eat it--which they did. A keepter!

The sauce was an excellent alternative to the traditional meat bolognese! Everything was very easy to prepare, and the flavors came together quite nicely. I do think that 1/4 c. oil was a bit much to use - I would cut it in half next time (it still shouldn't stick to the dish). Wonderful weeknight meal!

PERFECT ACCOMPANIMENT TO BRAISED BEEF WITH RED WINE! A LITTLE CRUSHED RED PEPPER ZIPPED IT UP! ALL EUPHORIC, AFTER!

Very, very good. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken but that didn't matter much. The richness of the vegetable variety worked perfectly with the polenta's canvas, but it was the parmesan that took this dish to a whole new level (I only sprinkled parm on half, the other half's flavors didn't jump out at you nearly as much).

We are watching calories and cholesterol so I skipped the polenta and put the sauce over a cavatappi pasta. This was quick and easy - we would make it again.
