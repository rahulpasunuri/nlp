This was so simple and very delicious! I didn't have currants, so I used dried cranberries. I also added a tiny bit of white wine (mostly because I was drinking it and thought it might be fun), and it gave some extra yummy juice. I served it to two guys in their 20s, and they enjoyed it so much that they didn't speak the entire time they were eating! I'd definitely make this again.

My husband and daughter did not like this recipe. My husband just said that the "flavors did not seem to go together." However, it was very easy to make, and I liked it. I would not hesitate to make it again for just me by cutting the recipe.

Although I found that I needed to bake the pears longer than 5 minutes, this is a very healthy dish, a perfect end to a winter meal, particularly one featuring pork. We've never bothered to add the frozen yogurt, preferring to serve the pears very cold.

This just didn't have a very good flavor. The recipe should also call for more time baking.

I made this for my family and they loved it. It was easy and healthy. I used low fat frozen yogurt and it was wonderful.
