Delicious! I went a bit crazy with the cumin and it was still good... but I love me some cumin. This recipe is fast, easy and cheap! Also, I much prefer a good vinaigrette slaw to the creamy kind. I am making this again for the next picnic.

Not a big hit with the family. Very plain and unexciting. Needed something more, but not sure what.

Very good, fast and easy to make. A bit too sweet for my taste so I'll cut the sugar in half next time. Even though I am not a big fan of cumin I did like the final product.

This was really good but I would use 1 tsp sugar next time. A bit too sweet...

Mine was a bit carrot heavy, but delicious! Loved it

A nice change from the traditional-type slaw. Nice & light.
