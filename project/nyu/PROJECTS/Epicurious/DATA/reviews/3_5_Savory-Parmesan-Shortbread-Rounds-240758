I don't like these by themselves, but they're pretty good crumbled over soup or salad. Definitely will reduce the butter if I make them again.

I hate when people begin a recipe by changing everything but that's exactly what I did. I divided the dough into three batches. One was nearly the same as written without the fresh garlic but with lemon zest. The second was that basic dough with minced fresh rosemary and pine nuts. The third was with smoked paprika, thyme and granulated garlic. I took a page out of Carla Hall's (Top Chef) Alchemy savory shortbreads and instead of cookies, I made little cubes so they wouldn't fall apart as a round. I put the dough in the freezer for half an hour. Amazing, if I may say so myself.

I have made these about five times and they always turn out great. Chilled butter and really good parmesan (grated right before using) are important. I don't form into logs, just spoon off each and roll into ball. Don't press too thin - better if they are about 1/4 inch thick.

These were a smash!!! I doubled the recipe and served them at a couple of different functions. Everybody went crazy. Had no trouble at all with anything. Easey peasey.

I tried to make this but the dough was way too dry. In fact, it wasn't forming a dough at all, it was very crumbly and I couldn't make a ball out of it. It just fell apart. I had to add 2 eggs to make it work.

These are butter bombs for sure. Definitely best made bite-sized, as they are crumbly. I followed suggestions to shape into rolls and then freeze for a few minutes. My rolls were a little over 1 inch in diameter, and I cut to 1/2 inch slices, shaping them with my hands before placing on the baking sheets. Made one batch with bacon and black pepper. Cooked the bacon first, then chopped fine. Really delicious and very easy.

A perfect appetizer served with champagne; it also makes a great hostess gift when there are too many sweets during the holidays. I recommend using an imported aged parmesan. I am a foodie who was raised by a French mother; I love cooking, entertaining and dining. IGNORE any reviews less than 4 stars. My sister went to culinary school and thought these were a hit as well!

Sadly, this will not be on our table again. We followed this closely, and the fumes from the cooking dough actually made my daughter feel sick.

Sadly, these were a New Year's Eve Naught. Massively disappointing considering the rave reviews. Far too much butter -- as a couple other reviewers have reported, these just fall apart immediately. More importantly, I found them to be totally unpalatable (and I'm usually really generous with butter in recipes). These went straight into the compost bin. I won't give up on the idea of parmesan shortbread, but next time I'll use a more traditional shortbread ratio (seems like several other recipes call for less than one stick of butter per cup of flour).

Added just a touch of bacon to one batch...beautiful

These baked MUCH faster than 20 mins. Keep checking!

Absolutely delicious! I did take the advice of some other cooks and put the dough in the freezer before I cut it. I found the dough easy to work with. I used a star cookie cutter instead of making rounds and the recipe yielded about double the amount than it says becuase my stars were small. Perfect for Christmas Eve at my mom's! I will definitely try with fresh herbs next time.

I've made four batches of this. The first, exactly as written with the exception of wrapping it in saran and chilling it for 30 minutes prior to cutting and baking. The other three batches were for a cocktail party. I added a little minced sun dried tomato to one batch, fresh chopped rosemary to the other and and a little cracked pepper to the third. Chilled the dough and made them all bite size. They were the first appetizer to disappear at the party. Versatile, nice flavor, good texture. Perfect with dry cocktails and dry, full-bodied wine.

Everybody loved these treats when I served them at a party this summer. At least 3 people wanted the recipe. Simply delicious and rather decadent.

I found them a little salty at the start (maybe I just put in too much Parmesan) but after sitting for a few weeks, they mellowed out and are delicious.

I'm really not sure why this recipe gets such rave reviews. I found the texture too crumbly for a good dipping cracker and the taste far too buttery. I think I'll just go to Trader Joe's and get some Ok-Moks for my next New Year's party.

This is nice and savory and best accompanied with drinks because of shortbread's dryness. I added about 1/4 cup extra grated parmesan to the recipe for more flavor, and added chopped rosemary which I'm sure made a positive difference. Shortbread's crumbly dough can be a challenge to work with, so I loved another reviewer's suggestion to roll the dough up in saran wrap to chill in the fridge. Bite-size for the cocktail party was the way to go. It turned out great.

Agree with other reviewer's, chill dough. I mixed smoke paprika with the parmesan to sprinkle on top. Great flavor.

The shortbread rounds were delicious- a big hit at holiday parties and I made several batches for holiday and hostess gifts; delicious served with pepper jelly.

I made this for a christmas party and they were a HUGE hit, esp the ones I added fresh thyme to. I, too, chilled the dough. In order to get it into a log shape, I slapped the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and rolled it inside the wrap. Otherwise it didn't hold together. Important to use kosher or sea salt and not regular iodized salt. When I made this a second time, I used regular mortons salt, and even though I cut down the amount it was still WAY too salty. P.S. If you don't have a food processor, a pastry cutter works fine (and gives your arms a workout!)

I made a batch of thse for the holidays and became hopelessly addicted to them. Mine followed the recipe to a "T" -- done in an easy 30 minutes. I'm going to try another batch for my freezer. And I have a feeling they'll become a standard in my house!

Everyone loved these as Christmas dinner appetizers. I rolled the dough and used a heart shaped cookie cutter (bite sized). I thought they needed a little more cayenne and next time will try the rosemary.

Made these this morning to take to a party this afternoon. They are a little dry (per DH) but good flavor. You do have to let the food processor run not pulse to get the dough to come together. No problem making a roll and slicing into rounds or pressing with a floured glass. I agree, these should be made into one bite pieces so it doesn't crumble in the eaters hand. Will try some herbs next time.

These were delicious, although mine didn't look like the photo! I added about a tablespoon of heavy cream, otherwise followed the recipe. I had trouble flattening the balls. A floured glass and a sprayed glass didn't work either. Maybe parchment paper wouldn't stick to the tops.

My findings after reading reviews and incorporated some reviewer suggestions. You do need to run the food processor for awhile - until the crumbs turn into an actual dough. It does help if you chill the dough. I think the rounds look more appetizing when they're 1-inch across. Also, when they're bigger than a single bite, the round tends to crumble after the first chomp. Make an inch thick roll instead of the fatter log. Chill, then slice pieces off and squash them a bit onto the baking pan. It's OK to use garlic powder and no need to use the best parm.

The instructions are not clear and should be changed. Run the food processor until it forms a ball! Herbs add a lot.

Another reviewer with a first Epicurious recipe flop. The dough mixture was too much for my Cuisinart standard sized food processor. There's too much butter in the recipe, they fell apart after I baked them. Bummer, I used some really good Parmesan for this and now it's gone. Bummer also because this recipe was in the "Quick Gifts" section of the magazine and I was making them for teacher gifts.

I had no problem with the dough. It worked great in my food processor. However, next time, I would like to make them more bite size and add more cayenne. The addition of herbs does sound yummy.

These are great! Not sure why others had problems with the dough. I did not have to use any ice water, nor did I chill the dough. I did, however, let the food processor run for a while until the dough began to ball up on the knife. A few on/off turns is not enough. I learned this technique from watching a demo in the 70's when Cuisinarts were first being marketed. I pretty much always do pastry dough and shortbread recipes this way despite what the recipe says. These were light, did not fall apart, and I had no trouble handling the dough. Next time I think I will try skipping the rolling into a log, cutting, and rolling again and will just scoop out a measured amount, roll in to a ball and flatten. Like other's suggestions about adding herbs.

Wow, my first flop from Epicurious! The first batch went into the trash and the second made crumble crisps, not shortbreads. It's too bad - they smelled good, especially with the rosemary I added.

It was fine, but I find this recipe for parmesan puffs much better: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/10244 They were better without the garlic. Also, adding some chilled water helped, as did chilling the dough.

Made 2 batches of these toward the Thanksgiving appetizers. They were a huge hit. First batch made exactly as stated but did take the advice of chilling the dough for a few minutes and it was much easier to work with. Second batch I snipped some fresh rosemary for my plant gone crazy with growth, finely chopped it and added it into the flour parmesan mixture. Both were delicious. I will definitely experiment with adding more herbs in the future, maybe thyme,dill or basil. Will be making these again and again. Had multiple requests for the recipe. I often have trouble with these types of doughs but this one was super easy to work with. Make them, you won't be sorry.

I, too, had trouble getting the dough to hold together. I ended up just rolling it into a log and then slicing off rounds (without forming into little balls first). I think this was successful--the rounds hold together when you pick them up and taste appealingly tender yet crumbly. I am taking them for appetizers for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

Try adding 2 tablespoons cold water and finish mixing by hand. This won't hold together without liquid or in the food processor. Or at least it won't for me.

Doesn't recipe call for liquid? My dough does not hold together at all.

Shortbread can be crumbly because of moisture or over-handling or both or it's Crumbly Shortbread Day. I get better results by chilling the raw pieces, even freezing them when there is room in the freezer, overnight.

The shortbreads flavor is delicious, but can someone tell me what I am doing wrong because they fall apart when you pick them up.
