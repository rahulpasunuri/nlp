I enjoy the flavor profile of this easy appetizer. Several comments 1.) While I agree with the previous reviewer, I still find the taste of ripe Hachiyas more rewarding. To skirt the difficulty of slicing issue, I wrap the persimmon slices with prosciutto. The presentation won't be quite as dramatic, but guests will prefer the ease of handling. Plus, it somewhat keeps them guessing as to what is inside, which makes for a nice surprise 2.) Using a high quality prosciutto is encouraged. Enjoy

I had to make this with Fuyu persimmons - Hachiya are only ripe to eat when they are super soft (they'll feel like a water balloon when you hold them), and can't be sliced!
