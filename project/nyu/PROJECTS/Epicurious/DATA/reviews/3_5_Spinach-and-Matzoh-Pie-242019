So delicious. I live with a pair off egg allergic boys so made this as stated but just left out the eggs. I added a few tablespoons extra milk to the soak for the matzah just for extra liquid but otherwise made no attempt to sub anything for the eggs. Guests raved and it was definitely the star of the passover table.

Great tasty recipe, and super easy. I would recommend using less dill - while not bad as is, it was a bit overpowering. Maybe halve the amount of dill. I also added a bit more feta because, let's face it, why not? Extra cheese rarely hurts a recipe. :)

This is definitely one of my favorite passover recipes. It's so delicious and so easy. I often split it in half since there are just me and my husband. Just writing this review makes me want to make it again soon!

The dill in this pie is over the top! I followed the recipe but used slightly less dill than is called for and it still tasted like a dill pickle. I liked the basic concept though, but next time will cut the dill to a tablespoon and add swiss cheese instead of Feta.

Really yummy, and easy! Great middle of Passover main dish. Unfortunately, the dill was too much for the kids, but the grown ups in the house loved it! I'll keep making it, and hope that the kids grow into liking it,

Can someone please help me with this recipe? I want to make this for Passover, but I'm a little unclear on the instructions - when you soak the matzoh squares, are they really supposed to be stacked? And if so, how high? 2 stacks of 3 squares? 3 stackes of 2? I want to make sure I don't end up with half-soggy/half-hard matzoh! Thanks so much!

Great recipe. Simple, really tasty, and excellent for getting rid of lots of matzoh. So good I would make it during non-Passover times. Didn't change a thing.

Delicious!! Definitely a crowd pleaser and easy to make. It will definitely be on my list every year at Passover!

This was good. I halved the recipe and made it in a pie pan, and it worked out great. That said; four stars means it's sensational and while this is yummy, it's not that outrageous. It does taste like it could be good at room temp/picnic. It's a neat idea. Ok ok, 3.5. Do NOT omit the nutmeg!

Most of my Passover guests seemed to like it but I thought it somehow had a very acidic taste. I used fresh sheep's milk feta. I would not make this again, though it did look nice on the table. It was pretty easy to make (my 5 year old son was able to help with everything except chopping and sauteing onions) and fun to assemble.

This was great last year for Passover, and I'm looking forward to making it again this year! Make sure to soak the matzoh as instructed (one reviewer didn't and complained how bland the dish was; the matzoh must have the soaking time to absorb the flavors!!). Definitely let it set for 10 minutes or so after removing from the oven to let the pie hold together.

I made this recipe for our Passover seder last year, it was a huge hit, and I'll make it again this year. I tripled for a big crowd and everyone raved. The spinach mixture can be assembled ahead and when layered w the matzah, the whole thing seems pudding like but after cooking (longer than the recipe noted) it "set" beautifully. reheats well. Great dish!

This recipe was very good for dinners that take into consideration dietary restrictions (vegetarian, kosher, etc.); however, it wouldn't be my first pick as a dish to make/ bring to a regular dinner party. It was a bit bland and the dill didn't do much to add to the flavor. I added an extra pinch of salt into the spinach filling and the end result tasted salty enough (just not very flavorful). That being said, the pie turned out pretty much exactly as I expected when I followed the recipe as written. I did open the oven halfway through to smush down the top layer matzo squares so that they soaked up some of the spinach filling liquid beneath and didn't look so dried out. Would definitely make again for a Passover dinner but probably not for other occasions...

This was simple and delicious. The feta I used was strong and salty - I used 2 oz more feta than called for, only 1 1/4 cup milk (I ran out!), and no dill. (Not on purpose - farmer's market had zero dill and I was hungry so I forged ahead without it!) The matzohs wouldn't all fit into the soaking dish at the same time (especially with too little milk to cover them) so I soaked them just a couple at a time. This made it take a little longer prep time, but I think it may have been better than adding more liquid to cover them. It held together beautifully when cut, nice and firm. And I can only imagine how lovely this is when you have fresh dill. Initially I was worried by all the variance in the reviews about what people did or didn't like - now my impression that a lot is personal preference, how much you expect it to taste like spanakopita, and some of it is what kind of feta was used. Feta can be strong, or nearly flavorless, depending on what type you buy.

It was good, but not great. I reduced the milk to one cup and added 1 egg- based on previous reviews. Bland mess, no way- but certainly not as good as spinach pie made with phyllo, the calories you're saving makes it worth it though. Full recipe has 2777 calories- 12 servings equals 231 cals per serving.

This was really bland and also very milky tasting if you don't put enough salt in it. I wouldn't recommend it.

This is a passover staple at our house - - use plenty of dill and a good salty feta and you can't go wrong. It's a bit of trouble but worth it.

Was surprised this recipe is so highly rated. I agree with the one other poster who thought this was bland. Even adding garlic, artichoke hearts, and extra dill and feta, it was still not very favorful. We love feta and spinach dishes, but this was not one of the better ones. It was OK, but not one I would make again.

great recipe! I didn't have matzoh on hand and opted to use bisquick for the crust. I got the idea from another epicurious recipe I'd made before - it's fairly healthy (no butter added). I used a package of fresh spinach instead of frozen - always a preference to use fresh over frozen. Also there is NO need to add salt to the spinach as directed - the feta adds enough salt the way I made it. Baked and then added bisquick topping for the last 12 minutes - baked until golden. Served over a green salad with fresh dill.

I lived off of this for a week and will make it every Passover from now on. I initially worried I would have a soggy, tasteless mess on my hands but ended up with creamy veggie simu-lasagna. It was very flavorful and satisfying without leaving you about-to-burst full. I used schmura matzohs, which are surprisingly easy to work with and slice once the dish was finished. It also refrigerates, reheats, and travels well.

Rating: 4
Pretty easy and very tasty. I used a 9x13 pan and 8 matzos. Let it sit overnight which I think helped the dill and other flavors really come together. Served it for a late Easter brunch. This dish is pretty much a spanakopita with matzo, and matzo is so much easier to work with than phyllo.

Fabulous recipe! Made it for Passover, and it was a hit. Didn't change a thing, and I had no problems. Great flavor--def. go with the fresh dill. Very easy, and very tasty. I would absolutely make it beyond Passover.

Yummy dish, but way too much matzo.....would cut down to 4...even 2...add more spinach mixture and top with more feta before baking....used skim milk, lite feta...everyone enjoyed it...will be a passover staple.

Delicious! Substituted fresh thyme and a tiny bit of dried oregano (not a fan of dill) and it was a definite hit. Has the taste of spanakopita. I was unsure about soaking the matzoh (after reading the reviews here) but I did, and it turned out perfectly. A repeat for sure.

This recipe was fabulous. I was a bit nervous making it but Everyone at the sedar last night loved it. I prepared the pie the night before and I believe the matzah was so thin like phyllo dough because I prepared it the night before. I will definitely make this again!

Made this dish last year for Passover and it was HUGE hit. A non-Jewish friend of the family loved it so much that she still brings it up every time we talk about cooking. Needless to say, it was requested again this year. This time I'll try assembling a day in advance, as I will be traveling with the dish and can just pop it in the oven after arriving at my aunt and uncle's house.

Made this for a weeknight dinner. The only modification I made was to add some fairly finely chopped artichoke hearts (in water, drained) with the spinach. Also added some minced garlic with the onions. I thought this was good -- not necessarily great. I could see adding some tofu for protein and a little more nutritional heft. I also like the idea of the flavored feta.

Rating: 2
I don't mean to sound like a party pooper, but this dish was definitely lacking a little of a lot. The salt content was non existent... even if you are scared of feta-overload, up the amount the recipe calls for. I added quite a bit of salt and it was still a little bland. But overall an OK dish...not great. I didn't enjoy it, but most of everyone else did. + I also didn't soak the matzohs. I just brushed them with the mixture.

Rating: 4
This was excellent! I used 2% milk and raised the oven temperature to 425 degrees during the last ten minutes of baking time. It's essential to let this dish rest for ten minutes after baking. My husband and I had this as a vegetarian entree and I'm looking forward to making it again.

Delicious! I made it for a dinner of 12 people and it was loved by all. I made the recipe exactly as is, except for a little bit more salt and used 8oz of feta instead of 6oz. I also think this is a great dish for all year round - you don't need Passover as an excuse. Yum!

Made this for my Jewish friends substituting no fat cottage cheese, skim milk and reduced fat feta. This was the first time I ever cooked with matzoh. My friends went for 2nds and thirds; they said it was a "mitzva" that I made this for them. I made it again as a casserole without the matzos. The flavors blend so well. The chopped fresh dill is essential. One extraordinary casserole this is!

I was looking for new recipes to make for Passover this year and this was a huge hit. Not with my fiancee of course (spinach hater), but I loved it, as did our other guests. I forgot to add the remaining 2Tbsp of Dill at the end, but it was still delicious. I will definitely be making this again next year.

Great recipe! Totally what we needed after so many nights of brisket and matzoh ball soup! I didn't have everything the recipe called for, and it was still fantastic. I didn't use nutmeg or dill, or a food processor (I didn't have one kashered). I used fresh baby spinach (just chopped, no need to remove liquid). I also didn't soak the matzoh (it was plenty moist from cooking). I used skim plus b/c that's what I had in the house. Rich enough, and the matzoh tasted like pastry. One thing I will change next time: I won't add salt to the cottage cheese. The feta made it VERY salty.

I made it all Sunday put it in fridge till I cooked it on Monday night. It was delicious with sliced tomatoes. I think I would even make it not on Passover. I used fat free cottage cheese and skim milk.

All of my Passover Seder guests really enjoyed this spinach and matzo pie, which my son dubbed "Spana-matzo-ka." I followed the recipe nearly exactly, the only exception being that I used 8 instead of 6 ounces of feta. I did soak the matzo and was glad I did, as the moisture helped keep the exposed matzo parts from burning. I especially appreciated being able to assemble the pie a day in advance and refrigerate it until just before baking, which made the day of the Seder significantly less hectic. I also liked the way the pie's Mediterranean flavors complemented those of the Catalan-style Sardine Escabèche, also on this site, which I served as a first course. I don't know how well the pie will hold up after baking, because I have no leftovers to test; my guests devoured the entire panful. This will definitely be a Passover staple.

I halved this and used an 8x8 pyrex pan. Don't soak the matzoh, just run it under warm water on both sides and let sit for 5 minutes. I also used fat free milk and it was fine. Lastly, I used a bit more feta and ran it under the broiler for five minutes at the end to make sure it was nicely browned.

Rating: 3
A new Passover staple! You don't have to use whole milk (it does make it less watery, though) And I agree with the others, don't soak the matzoh in the mixture, just dampen it a bit or it will fall apart. I also recommend some of the flavored fetas...I used peppercorn, but sun-dried tomato would also be good. And the dill makes all the difference!

Wow - This recipe was terrific. I doubled it and it worked perfectly. In the future I would add a bit more feta but otherwise it was a big hit with my guests. No leftovers is always a good sign.

Great idea, it will save me from not eating for a few days this passover! My suggestions are to use more salt. some garlic and fresh spinach. Boil the spinach before pressing and frying because it will then be easier to digest. Also, much more salt, a crushed chili pepper in the olive oil for the onions and the spinach, etc. I used mint because I didn't have any dill and am a poor student. Also, don't soak the matsos, just run them under the cold tap so they don't burn...a little egg wash on top...that's it. AD

This was very good. The feta, spinach and dill create a taste similar to spanicopita. Not sure the matzos need to be soaked, as dish came out soggy in spots (overall, though, this did not detract from the dish). This is the kind of dish you can make and reheat without it tasting like leftovers. I will definitely be making it again.

This was a great recipe for a nice change from the standard Pesach fare. I have made it since with rave reviews from all who have tried it. i have succcessfully portioned and frozen for a quick meal. Goes nice with a Greek salad as a side dish. It turns out just as well with reduced-fat feta cheese, although I like using 8 versus 6 ounces. The dill gives it a great flavor and fresh makes a big difference over dried. I have substituted once with Evaporated milk when I did not have any milk at home and it has worked out just fine. I have tried it both with and without the nutmeg (served to someone who is not a nutmeg fan) and it has turned out equally good. I have also tried using some scallions and this has been a nice addition. Great for vegetarians who are looking for alternatives and remember this can be made any time of the year (especially for those of you who bought the jumbo boxes of plain matzo)

It tasted almost like the spanikopida that I buy from the local Mediterranean market. My boyfriend, always wary of anything new, devoured the entire pan (with my help, of course). I would even consider making it during the rest of the year, given the difficulty of working with philo dough. Excellent vegetarian Passover fare!
