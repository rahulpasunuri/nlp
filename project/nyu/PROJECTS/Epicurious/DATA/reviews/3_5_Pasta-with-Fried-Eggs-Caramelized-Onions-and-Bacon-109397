I didn't find this to my family's taste...very greasy with the carmelized onions which transferred to the pasta, resulting in a very slimy-textured dish. I don't think I would make this again.

love this recipe. to make it look a little nicer, I mix everything but the eggs together, dish the pasta out and then set a fried egg on top of the plated meal. looks quite nice that way, and the taste is totally fab. I use baby spinach and quality bacon and a dash of garlic in the carmelized onion. this recipe is a regular.

Any carbonara fan would love this. I made a few changes--doubled the baoon and the cheese, added 4 cloves of chopped garlic for the last few minutes of caramelizing the onions, cut the red pepper in half, and crumbled some homemade garlic croutons on top for a little added texture. This was absolutely delicious and I could have eaten another serving even though one was filling enough. I love this combination of flavors, and I'm glad I cut the red pepper back because I don't think I would have been able to distinguish the separate flavors of all the other ingredients if I had used the full amount. My mouth was left tingling from the heat with just half. This is one I'll happily do again.

! P.S. Just to clarify a mistake I noticed in my messege just behind this one, the pancetta I used was THREE INDIVIDUAL ROUND SLICES EACH 1/4" INCH THICK ONLY!! {the way I wrote it the first time it looks like I wrote 3 1/4 thick each--that would be way too thick!} Stick to 1/4' inch round slices! SORRY!!!

Soo incredibly delicious! I used left over 'angel hair' pasta which gave a great delicate texture. I used about 'double' the mount of cheese because we like things cheesy, and it gave a really nice texture! I added about 4 cloves of minced 'garlic' as recommended by other reviewers. I used the same pan for everything because our pasta was already cooked. When I fried the eggs I used extra olive oil to insure that they wouldn't stick to the bottom of my stainless steel pan which hadn't been deglazed and was still sticky from caramelizing the onions. I used 3 1/4" inch thick slices of Italian Pancetta chopped into tiny cubes instead of regular bacon. I added the eggs to the mixture last to insure that they would get mixed and not stick to the bottom of the pan. I set aside some of the pancetta to garnish the top of each plate & add some 'crunch'. Hubby & I both thought this was delectable, heavenly and an instant 'keeper'! I told Hubby that other reviewers on epi thought the meal visually looked 'ugly', he disagreed and said it looked good & kind of Reminded him of Chinese noodles in appearance. This will become a permanent recipe that I will use again & again.

I agree with everyone. This dish sure is unappealing to the eye, but taste delicious! I omitted the spinach because the person I was cooking for doesn't like it.

This gets four forks, as some other reviewers have stated, with some tweaking. The base recipe/combo is good, but I found the idea of four eggs a little much: I used two and it still seemed plenty rich. However, the big win making this in August was hybridizing this recipe with an old fav summer pasta that pairs slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, chives and Marscapone. My garden is bursting with the two latter (and I was worried about the chives but realized this is a common marriage in asian food: cooked onion AND spring onion) and they really brought something to this dish - plus I roasted the tomatoes with a couple cloves of garlic, which also got tossed in. Note: with only two eggs for viscosity, it needs quite a bit of the pasta water to not be too sticky. While i was in a lily-gilding mood, I topped it with homemade breadcrumbs along with with the Pecorino. Yuh-uum. I think this would be still be great without bacon.

I am actually giving this 3.5 stars. I thought it was quite yummy. Added some garlic to the carmelizing onions, a little more crushed red pepper and, like another user, a little more cheese. Like this because I have most of these items in my kitchen most days. Good dish to whip up when you need a pasta fix.

Delicious!! I upped the amounts a little to compensate for a full pound of pasta. A nice (and probably healthier) variation of spaghetti carbonara.

This was delicious. Ugly, but delicious. I wasn't sure if I wanted the egg, but it was well worth it. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Excellent! I added roasted cubes of butternut squash to the pasta and it was a great fall dish.

Amazing! Just made this with my huge spinach supply and whole wheat pasta. Even my picky husband liked it!

this was absolutely FABULOUS. the first time i made it, i added the spinach to the pasta directly, but the second time around, i added the spinach to the onions briefly to help it wilt a bit more and absorb the delicious onion-y and garlic-y flavors. also, i had some leftover anchovies and threw these in at the last moment--also a delicious option.

I don't know what the cook from White Bear Lake, MN did, but I just cooked this for our European trio and it was a veritably flavourful hit. The only variance I made was to add lots of garlic and double the chilli flakes and the cheese. Not dinner party fodder, but definitely returning to our table.

This was terrible. I am always looking for healthy, fast, one-dish meals for my family but this tasted too blah. I even doubled the cheese and added extra spices to pep it up. I added jarred spaghetti sauce to convince my kids to eat it. Nothing worked and I dumped it.

Forgot to add that I didn't have any spinach so left it out completely and it was still a hit. The next time I make it I will add the spinach.

This recipe was delicious. It was quick and easy and everyone loved it. I used a bit more bacon than it called for. Yum!!

actually this did rate a four forks- easy VERY tasty & not a complaint about the onions by my kids. We didn't have even a tiny morsel for leftovers....

I'm always looking for new pasta recipes for the family. The kids will eat just about anything with bacon in it, so I knew this would work. We finished it all and were disappointed that there wouldn't be any left for tomorrow's lunch. I used a whole pound of pasta though with the same amount of the other ingredients and it was fine. (I hate having just a bit of pasta left in the box.) I also added a touch of garlic at the end of the onion cooking. One last change was that I wilted the spinach in the frying pan before adding it to the pasta, because I didn't want any tough raw leaves in there.

This is one of my favorite quick and easy recipes. Nothing fancy but very tasty and perfect for a weeknight meal. Leftovers are great for lunch too!

It was just "fine". I liked it for the novelty factor, but it wasn't anything special. Maybe pancetta would make it more interesting?

This is one of the most delicious and satisfying pasta recipes I have ever had! I wanted to make it vegetarian, so I omitted the bacon and think that it was quite flavorful without it. YUM!
