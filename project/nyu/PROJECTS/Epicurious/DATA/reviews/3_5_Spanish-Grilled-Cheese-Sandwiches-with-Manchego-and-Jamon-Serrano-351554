Just made these sandwiches for the family and everyone loved them. I went with prosciutto since jamón Serrano could not be found. I found the dates really added a sweetness to keep the saltiness of the prosciutto in check. All in all a very good quick meal.

This is a good enough grilled cheese sandwich, but not quite good enough to merit the extra expense of Manchego and Serrano ham. Once melted, cheese tastes pretty much the same.The chopped dates don't bring much to the recipe, either: more like, "What's that funny taste?"

These sandwiches were outstanding! First made with a loaf of herb flat bread; the next day, used a loaf of ciabatta. Also used chopped fresh figs instead of dates - a wonderful contrast to the ham and cheese. Served with gazpacho - lunches to die for.

Sooooo delicious! We used proscuitto and manchego sandwiched between slices of thinly sliced crusty olive bread. The dates tone down the saltiness of the meat and cheese. Divine! We paired the sandwiches with Epicurious' Zucchini and Spinach soup ... a perfect combo. http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/everydaycooking/weeklydinnerplanners/040309/recipes/food/views/Zucchini-and-Spinach-Soup-107910

This makes a very good "gourmet" grilled cheese and ham sandwich. I couldn't find jamon serrano so I used prosciutto instead and it tasted fine. The manchego and prosciutto can be a bit salty so have something to balance it on the side. The dates add a nice sweetness to the sandwich.
