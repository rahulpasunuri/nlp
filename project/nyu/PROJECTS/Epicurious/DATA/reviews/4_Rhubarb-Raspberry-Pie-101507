Best Rhubarb pie ever -- the two steps make it really good instead of raspberry I added rhubarb balsamic vinegar to the cooking rhubarb.

Great as written. Picked the rhubarb from the garden this morning. I removed some of the outer rhubarb that was stringy. The cinnamon gave it a nice, subtle touch, and the raspberries put it over the top. Of course right now raspberries are on sale $2.99 a box and I used 3 boxes since I only have a larger glass pie plate. Not an inexpensive pie, but worth the way everyone licked their plates clean, and it's different from your average pie. Lattice top was beautiful.

I forgot to say that I used my standard fool proof pie dough recipe not the one given here. So maybe this recipe doesn't actually deserve four forks.

I made this with 4c. rhubarb and just a handful of strawberries. It was excellent...loved by kids, grandparents and all.

The crust was not worth the effort...there other pie crusts on this site that are better. And the filling was just average in my opinion.

What a great recipe! The crust was wonderful and worth the effort! I added extra raspberries - very delicious!

I used 4 cups of rhubarb, 2+ cups of raspberries, and 1/2 cup of strawberries in this pie. I liked the hint of strawberry flavor in this very tasty pie. I enjoyed cooking down the rhubarb with the sugar. I thought this gave it an interesting taste and texture.

I used mixed frozen berries because the fresh raspberries at the grocer didn't look great and the recipe still came out perfectly. I made the pie early in the afternoon for a late dinner party, so it had plenty of time to set. My pie was not runny at all. It was quite tart, so it needed the ice cream I served it with to sweeten things up a bit. I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I usually steer away from mixed fruit pies; my family are purists. But this got good reviews.

For the writer who said this pie was runny: pies need to "set" for at least 3 hours. Try that next time. Also, it is totally unnecessary to precook the rhubarb if you put it in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes. Keep it simple! Finally, a lattice top is a really pretty addition to this recipe. (I used store bought ... keeping it simple.)

Love it! I made this pie for the bookclub ladies last week and again for my husband over the long weekend. As always, I used my favourite Joy of Cooking pastry recipe and both times earned rave reviews - even from those who don't usually like rhubarb. I used only about 1 cup of sugar for the perfect balance between tart and sweet. A gorgeous and delicious summer dessert, especially when served a little warm with homemade vanilla ice cream.

This is a pie for people who don't like rhubarb. The raspberries overwhelm the rhubarb and they are added without extra sugar so the pie is quite tart - I would say sour. The crust is good but lots of work and very rich. I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious. I actually turned it into a more traditional strawberry-rhubarb pie, but the dough is really good. Highly recommended.

A perfect recipe--followed it to a tee, except used a different pie crust recipe from Gale Gand's "Butter Sugar Flour Eggs"...*the* best pie crust recipe. The tartness of the rhubarb and raspberries is a refreshing summer treat. Goes nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I've experimented with different recipies, and this one is by far the best. You can also substitute strawberries for the raspberries and it is still perfect.

This recipe is delicious! I substituted rhubarb from my garden for the raspberries and used a simpler crust, and everyone loved it. My father, who loves rhubarb, said it was the best he had ever tasted.

Everyone LOVES this when I make it!!! It is definitely an awesome dessert!!!!

A perfect combination! I doubled the raspberries and used frozed rhubarb and it was delicious. I served it at THanksgiving and it was the first dessert to be finished.

I don't understand the use of raw rhubarb at the end. The raw pieces were very under cooked. The cornstarch made the filling very pasty - like a commercial pie one gets at a fast food outlet. And too sweet.

Being a rhubarb fanatic, I leave out the berries altogether and add the extra in uncooked rhubarb - this really makes a nice, thick textured filling of PURE RHUBARB!!! Yum, Yum!

My first pie and it was a success (thanks to my mom!). The flavors were great -- the cinnamon was a perfect addition. I'll make it whenever rhubarb is in season.

What a terrific pie! My husband, who thinks he hates rhubarb, loved it, and told me to please make it again. I cooked the rhubarb a bit longer that called for, and it wasn't at all runny. I also cheated and used a store-bought crust. Every bite was eaten at Mother's Day, and that was by a bunch of chocoholics who think it isn't dessert if there's no chocolate in it.

I used my own trusty stand-by pie crust instead of the one this recipe called for. No getting away from it, the rhubarb raspberry filling is delicious. Unfortunately, though, it is a little runny. I was disappointed to discover that the filling wasn't solid enough when I served it to guests. A good dollop of ice cream over that runny filling hid this shortcoming and still, everyone commented on how delicious dessert was.

This was an easy pie to make that turned out absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend to anyone.

Being a novice baker, I had a rough time with the crust. I was very nervous about mushing things around. I should have been a little more aggressive. The center of my dough round was mostly flour. Nevertheless, the pies turned out beautiful. My brother-in-law even flipped the box they were in upside down and back again and barely a bit of crust broke loose. Very strong crust. Perfect moisture on the filling. I used blackberries & blueberries rather than raspberries. Yummy!

Delicious pie! I made it with blackberries instead of raspberries and everyone LOVED it! The pie crust was a pain to make, but definetly worth the effort - very buttery and great texture.

This dessert is absolutely wonderful. I used blueberries instead of raspberries, but the flavor certainly wasn't undermined. Delicious! Serve it slightly warm with the best vanilla ice cream you can find.

This is a fantastic pie. The frozen-butter crust is delicious--buttery, crisp and flaky and the rhubarb-raspberry combination has the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. I might keep a litte more of the rhubarb uncooked to mix in at the end--I like the filling to have more texture. A lovely recipe!
