Delicious! I made this as two 10-inch pizzas, using a different crust recipe (Michael Schwartz's), and it was wonderful. Creamy cheese, salty prosciutto, fresh tasty basil. It was good microwaved for lunch the next day, too!

so amazing. put everthing on before cooking. made several hours ahead of time and then just popped in the oven.

Definitely a winner. I agree with Dallas, TX, that the make-ahead option is the best part! Served before Easter dinner and they want fast fast fast! Four people scarfed them all up (so you might want to double the recipe for 6). I'd never used rolled pizza dough before. What else can we do with it?

Recipe - Pretty good for quick. But Beaumont, Texas, takes the cake, along with the fools that didn't get it - Best spoof I've seen in a while. Thanks!

Received rave reviews on this appetizer...and they went fast. The flavors were all great and I think this recipe could be used so many different ways.

Beaumont, Texas is absolutely pulling your leg. Some of you guys really need to loosen up. This recipe was good with puff pastry also; really, who's not going to snap up a bite with basil and cheese and prosciutto?

SO funny! I can't believe folks can't take a step back and laugh. Guess they just don't understand Texas humor. Or don't have a sense of humor. So sad... If the Texan were to seriously write up a Texas version of this recipe, I'm sure it would consist of something like: chipotle barbecue sauce, brisket, grilled onions and maybe a little goat cheese. The recipe itself, though, is fantastic as is. I left the prosciutto out since I'm vegetarian and added some kalamata olives to replace the saltiness. Yum! Lighten up people! :)

This pizza is so good! I used frozen basil (it's January) from our garden and the flavor was exceptional. Also it is a pretty pizza. My kids liked it and my husband and I loved it. The best part was that my budget grocery store carries all the ingredients..

a smash hit! I made it on Mother's Day but used grape tomatoes instead! YUMMY!

I made this for a party. Quick and easy preparation and the guests like it very much!

I agree with an earlier poster and substituted slices of baguette (drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and baked just until crispy) for the pizza dough. However, thats strictly based on personal preference as Im not a huge pizza dough kind-of-guy. Hey Beaumont - funny stuff. The city folks took you a little too seriously. I tried your Texas-version of this recipe and fed it to my wife, 2nd cousin, best man's sister, and good friend's ex-wife and she really enjoyed it!

Ok! I too have never written a review. But this was too good! Texas is so funny! But really I can enjoy the refined taste of the recipe while still appreciating all the past gourmet contributions that got food to where it is now! I'm a caterer and needed something new for a cocktail party and this was amazing! I will make the Texas version for my kids friends :)

I'm going to take a novel approach and actually review this recipe. These pizettes are excellent. The prep ahead of time is a time saver. I used a slice of Roma tomato instead of the cherry tomatoes, then topped with a blend of grated parmesan, asiago, and romano cheeses. These do go fast and next time I will double the recipe. BTW--a note to you arrogant, inane reviewers; I appreciate your decision to stay out of my state!!

I plan to make this for a graduationp party so Iread the reviews for any hints/tips. After reading the review from the 'texan', it only solidifies my decision to NEVER move to Texas. If he chooses to trash talk what most of us feel is a great culinary inspiration, then he should go back to his trailer trash recipes and stop wasting space here. And by the way, have you ever read what's in Velveeta??

Followed this recipe pretty closely for our recent Easter gathering although I left the prosciutto off a few pizzettes for the vegetarian in the group. These were hit and were the first appetizer to go. I wish I had made two batches as we could have used a bit more for 8 adults, but lesson learned. Definitely recommend this!

I tried the Texan chef's version with a couple of substitutions, i.e., Cheez Whiz for the Velveeta and Scrapple for the Spam. Both the recipe and the spoof are excellent.

Is the cook from Texas kidding? That whole review is just so sad.

Fantastic. We added some crushed red pepper and the second time we made them, we cut the oven temp down to 425 instead of 475 since the first time, some had near-black undersides. We did some with raw prosciutto and some went back into the oven for a bit under the broiler and both variations were great. We ate the leftovers for breakfast with a little leftover prosciutto.

I used puff pastry instead because that's what I had in the freezer. Very good, disappeared instantly!!

I haven't tried this dish yet, but I was wondering if anyone baked the pizzettes with the prosciutto on it so it was toasted?

It was very good not excellent. Think I would try on a crostini instead of pizza dough.

A big hit at a spring cocktail party. Placed on a warming tray, but they didn't even last that long. So easy and tasty.

This was amazing - make sure you use Italian Fontina. I bought pizza dough from my local pizza place instead of the refrigerated stuff. Guests loved them.
