Make these meatballs! They are our family favorite. I make them with hot Italian sausage and skip the pine nuts. The dried currants are what make these meatballs great. They also freeze well for a quick meal, if you have any left.

Amazing meatball recipe. I have made this several times and it is always fantastic. I have never made this with the currants or pine nuts, and most of the time I use soy or almond milk. (although I do enjoy it with regular milk)

I have been making this for years. Hands down one of the most popular dishes in the family. I usually use either hot Italian chicken or turkey sausage. Since dried currents are a bit hard to come by, I have replaced them with dried cranberries, and it works perfectly. Otherwise follow the recipe exactly.

Have been making these for 4 years now and everyone always loves them. I freeze the uncooked meatballs on a cookie sheet lined with self release foil. Then put the frozen meatballs in ziplock bags. I take out what I need, defrost and fry them. Perfect! I use my own sauce, often Amatriciana.

I have cooked these meatballs several times. I first tried using the sweet Italian sausage the recipe called for, then I next tried out using 2 packages of the hot Italian sausage from Costco, tripled the rest of the ingredients.I find that using the hot sausage had a more tasty, delicious flavor. YUMMY! I also used the recipe from Pasta Al Pomodoro using fresh plum tomatoes. Now, this time it is to die for.

I have been making these meatballs for years and they are always a big hit. I use about 75% sweet Italian sausage and 25% ground sirloin but otherwise make them exactly as the recipe is written. I make a double batch and freeze them. I use my own tomato sauce recipe which is based on one by Mario Batali which I also make up in a double batch and freeze separately from the meatballs.

The meatballs were very well received. Excellent! I didn't make the sauce, because there were so many bad reviews so made my own sauce.

These meatballs are amazing...the only problem I had with them was trying to keep my family from eating them long enough to simmer them in the sauce! I used half beef, half pork, and raisins instead of currents, but otherwise everything the same. Loved them, this recipe is a keeper.

Delicious meatballs (probably because they are made from all sausage)! I used panko, hot Italian sausage, and chopped the pine nuts and currents. I made a different sauce recipe, but these meatballs are fantastic. My husband and I ate many of them before they even made it into the sauce!

Have I reviewed this recipe? Can't understand why not when this is about the 150th time making them. In the realm of meatballs, this is a hands down four-forker. Sweet Italian sausages contain veal, pork and fennel. To avoid big lumps of fat or grissle, instead of sausages I buy pre-ground veal and pork and add fennel seeds myself, mix and leave overnight for the fennel to permeate. Make as instructed. Good cold with a smear of dijon and a beer.

These were delicious and everyone raved, and kept mentioning the meatballs numerous times throughout the week! This meatball recipe goes in the 'permanent' file. I modified by adding 1 pound of lean ground beef and fennel pollen. A worthwhile endeavor with a different spicy sauce!

I've made this twice. The meatballs are amazing. The currants are to die for. I use hot sausage, otherwise according to recipe. I added a couple of tablespoons each of tomato paste and sugar to the sauce, and it was also great. Fresh, bright, delicious. Quick and easy. Do it.

I made this recipe for my crew at the firehouse and it was a great success. I replaced the currants with dried cranberries and it still worked splendidly. Be sure to keep a close eye on the pinenuts when toasting, as mine weren't quite done evenly (my fault). Very, very tasty!

Great Base recipe. I had left over italian sausage, so I was looking for something that could last a few meals. Used mild sausage. Had some frozen basil cubes, so defrosted 1 and used that. Then supplemented with 1/4 cup of parsley. Had whole wheat breadcrumbs so added more milk....would probably have been fine with the suggested amount though. Meatballs were very tender, but almost too 'fall apart'. Omitted curants and pine nuts, as didn't have any on hand. Also threw in some shredded mozzarella that I wanted to get rid of (about 1/3 of a cup) into the meatballs. Also used some italian seasoning along with Johnny's Garlic Spread (YUM!). Added salt to meatballs, but shouldn't have. Also, threw in some red wine (1/3 cup) to sauce and 2 TBLspoons of sugar. Let meatballs season sauce for at least 25 minutes.

Rating: 3
Wasn't so sure about the currants, but they added a nice surprise to meatballs. I wanted the meatballs to be healthier, so I used 2# ground venison & 1# ground bison (triple recipe), added about 4T dried Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and more garlic. Be careful not to overcook, as they're so lean. I also used 3 cans tomato sauce, and 1 can diced tomatoes in sauce recipe, plus 3T dried Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, chopped Italian parsley, 1T sugar (always add sugar to a tomato sauce!!), and black pepper.

Muy delicioso! Substituted chopped raisins for currants and used dried basil in the meatballs. My kids gave it "infinity" forks

Fantastic - I am not an Italian food expert, but - my family loved the meatball recipe. I did not have sweet sausages, so I used the spicy ones and some ground pork to make a full pound. Also added about 2 tsps prepared Italian Seasoning herbs. I was a little nervous about adding the currants and the pine nuts, but not anymore. GReat recipe and I will use again for sure! As for the sauce, I kinda sorta followed that part of the recipe (next time). I agree with those that thought the meatballs could be served as an appetizer (with out the sauce).

These are the best meatballs I've ever tasted, and I used to date an Italian. My fiance and I are considering serving these at the cocktail hour at our wedding because they've become a signature dish! We've only actually served them with sauce and pasta once or twice. They are so flavorful by themselves that we prefer them simply on toothpicks. Make sure you chop everything well and don't make the balls too big! BE WARNED: they are so tasty that my Jewish friend HAD to try one, knowing they have pork and cheese! Another friend with delicate blood sugar not only tried them when she shouldn't've, but then demanded the recipe!

Great flavor. Left the currants out. Mixed half sausage and half ground beef. Also seared the meatballs on all sides for more flavor and finished them off in the sauce, simmering for 30 minutes or so. It just tastes better! Used the drippings from the frying to saute onions, etc. for the sauce base and used my own sauce recipe. Delicious!

I am rating this recipe now for the first time, but have been craving them ever since I made them about a year ago. I struggle with serving pasta after so many years of low carb diets - what a waste!

I swear that my family has no idea, even my husband with a very discriminating palate.

Rarely do I comment on recipes, but this one earned a comment or two. These meatballs are Outstanding! Couple of suggestions based on making this recipe about 10 times so far: 1) Must add the currants and even more than is called for; same with the pine nuts. Try 3T each. You will be rewarded with extra sweetness and flavor. 2) These can be made with both Italian Sausage and a Beef/Pork/Veal meatloaf mixture and both versions are excellent. I have decided to make these with the BPV mixture because it makes handling and mixing easier. 3) You can cheat by using 1/2 cup Seasoned Italian breadcrumbs. As others have said, these meatballs freeze well. I have kept them for up to a month with no apparent degradation in taste. Finally, I make my own sauce and like others didn't like this simple sauce.

My grandfather came over from Sicily and my groundmother makes some amazing Italian dishes. Her meatballs are the best! These are just as good, only different. Very spicy and delicious. Per suggestions, I used 1/2 sausage and 1/2 beef and I left out the currants. You defininately want to turn them once when they're browning in the oven. When I took one out of the oven and ate it I was really disappointed. I thought to myself "people rated these the best meatballs they ever had? - I feel sorry for these people!" I actually threw away the recipe. Then believe it or not, once I added them to the sauce (I made the tomato and garlic sauce from this site - perfect) and cooked them another 30 minutes. WOW. Both the sauce and meatballs were totally yummy and fabulous. I'll add this to my rotating Italian red sauce recipes. Loved it and so did my husband.

Rating: 3
Don't be fooled by the 3 fork rating--I only give 4 forks if I am completely overwhelmed by a dish's deliciousness. I thought that these meatballs were excellent, and I will definitely make them again. The amount of breadcrumbs does seem like a lot, but it works well since these meatballs are all sausage. If you used less breadcrumbs, you would just be eating a fatty sausage ball. I loved the pine nuts and would definitely add them next time. As for the currants, I substituted golden raisins per another reviewer's suggestion because I had tons of them in the pantry. I liked the raisins, but my boyfriend's reaction was more ambivalent for textural reasons. Next time I think that I'll probably use half the amount of raisins, and I'll maybe cut them in an even finer dice than I did this time. I added oregano, a bay leaf, and red pepper flakes to my sauce and it turned out just fine. So you could either do that or substitute your own sauce. I think that the original recipe is going for authentic simplicity, but I can see why some people thought that it was boring.

Rating: 4
I've never liked Italian sausage (the fennel is just too much for me), but these meatballs are outstanding! They are so simple and delicious. The first time I made them I used pork sausage, the second time I used turkey sausage (if you use this make sure you don't get extra lean turkey meat because it will come out way too dry) and the third time I used pork sausage with a little pancetta and they were perfect. Also, I used a different sauce since this one is just a little too bland for my liking.

These are the best meatballs I have ever made, twice now. That's the good news. The bad news is that the sauce just blows and doesn't complement the meatballs at all. There is no reason to use diced tomatoes when you can get much more flavorful canned plum tomatoes. I tried it with my own sauce with canned plum tomatoes, and the whole dish was much better. I don't understand leaving out the pine nuts and currants, but see below. These make the meatballs special. Otherwise, these are just pork sausage with some binding. It's not easy to find currants these days, but chopped golden raisins have a similar effect on the results. Golden raisins can be found almost anywhere. Also, my local butcher makes an Italian sausage with cinnamon and nutmeg, this works great with the recipe. So four stars for the meatballs, one star for the sauce.

Awesome recipe. After reading all the rave reviews, I used a lb of ground beef and a lb of sausage and froze half the meatballs for another time. I always bake my meatballs and recommend using a wire rack over the pan so that the fat can drip off. Believe me, they will get brown! To those who suggested the bread crumbs were in excess, absolutely not! I learned how to make meatballs from a great Italian cook many years ago and he advised that roughly a third of the mix should be breadcrumbs. This helps to keep them moist and firm. I was not even sure what pine nuts were, let alone how to toast them! For those who might be wondering, you toss them in a dry skillet over medium heat until browned. My husband does not like to try new things and swears that he does not like nuts (no allergy), so I chopped the pine nuts and currants finely. He loved this dish, as did I!

This recipe was exceptional. I ended up using spicy italian chicken sausage- which worked beautifully. The meat managed to stay really moist, and the flavor was awesome. I also used a premade sauce- Rao's spicy Arrabbiata sauce from whole foods, which is really good. The whole dish turned out pretty spicy, which i love. I ended up making the dish a few days later because it was so good!

Four forks for the meatballs, although the sauce would not get such a stellar review. In fact, I didn't even serve the sauce as written. It didn't taste right. I seasoned it with salt & pepper and added 1 t. dried oregano and 1 t. sugar. That did the trick. But, the meatballs were out of this world. My husband who always prefers beef to pork in recipes was bowled over and admitted that these were the best he's ever had.

Rating: 4
Absolutely the best meatballs ever!!! I made this tonight as written, tried one "test" meatball before my dinner and I knew this was a winner. I then found out that we had two additional guests, so I took some hamburger (about 1/2 pound) and stretched the recipe. I think it was even better with the ground beef mixed in. Even my boyfriend (who hates everything) kept saying how awesome the meatballs were and wanted to know what I did differently. He was convinced that it was just some spices, but LOVED the meatballs. I think I may try this as a meatloaf with more ground beef. Try it...incredible!!!

My brother asked me to make him some old fashioned meatballs and spaghetti expecting me to follow my mom's (admittedly dry) recipe. I tried this instead, and both of us were blown away!

These meatballs are great! I, too, used 1/2 sausage - 1/2 beef. I used the sauce recipe from the Classic Spagetti and Meatballs recipe on this site, leaving out the sausage and browning the meatballs instead. Then I use the drippings from that to finish the sauce and then finished cooking the meatballs by simmering them in the sauce. Everyone raved. I sent a plate home with a friend and he said they never even made it to the refrigerator! He ate them when he got home! Definitely part of the keeper files.

These would make great hearty appetizers! I used raisins instead of currants, but next time I would make that extra trip to the store and get currants, they are smaller and probably would stay inside the meatballs better - but even with that "problem", these were the best meatballs I've ever had (my husband and brother agreed wholeheartedly!)

We thought the meatballs were quite good; the pine nuts really added to the flavor. The sauce wasn't our favorite - never really cooked down and did not have a lot of flavor.

Excellent meatballs! Loved the touch of currants and pine nuts with this recipe which was something different and tasty than the usual meatball recipe. Gotta love those Sicilians! As with the previous reviewers, I used half sausage, half lean ground beef, added 1/2 tsp of kosher salt and threw in some pepper flakes into the mix. The amount of 2/3 cup fresh bread crumbs worked just fine for me. I also used another recipe for the sauce. This dish came out perfect and soooo yummmmy! This recipe is definetly a keeper!

As a full blooded Italian, I generally don't need a recipe to make meatballs-but these are awesome. I made these several times 8 years ago when the recipe came out, but then kind of forgot about them... I just returned from Sicily- and thought of this recipe and am making them tonight.... they use very typical Sicilian ingredients- currants an pine nuts. I agree that the sauce is nothing special- so I make a small quanitiy of my usual, basic tomato sauce just to let the balls "marinate" in it on the stove for a while, but make a different sauce (tonight it will be a sicilian pesto with capers) for the spaghetti, and just srve the meaballs with a little sauce as the meat course. Or I make a larger quantity of my usual sauce and put the balls in it...

Meatballs were divine, but the sauce ...not so much. It was too sweet and tart at the same time. The currants and pine nuts made the meatballs extra-delicious.

My family have never been big meatball fans until now. They loves these. I too made a few changes. I mixed the sausage with ground beef, added toasted crushed fennel seed, doubled the pine nuts and currants and of course doubled the garlic. Taking the advice of others on this site I browned them off in a skillet then baked them until just done. Although this is a bit more time consuming and messier who wants a pale meatball? Yuck. They make great meatball sandwiches and are delicious as a pizza topping. I make a double batch and they freeze beautifully. Enjoy! K.T.

Love this recipe with a few modifications. Based on other reviewers' comments, I make the "Spicy Tomato Sauce" on this site (punched up with extra spices). I also double the amount of currants and pine nuts, which are really what make these meatballs special. Also, instead of heating the meatballs in the sauce, I warm them in the oven and add them to the sauce just before serving. (The meatballs soak up way too much salt if heated up in the sauce as the recipe calls for.) The "sweetness" of the meatballs, combined with the spiciness of the tomato sauce make of a truly wonderful (and relatively easy) meal. Double the ingredients and have leftovers to freeze!

Last time I made these, our butcher was out of Italian sausage, so gave me veal sausage instead (at the lesser price!) and I highly recommend it! I've never been a huge fan of Italian sausage (the fennel, I think) so the veal took this from 3 to a solid 4 forks!

This recipe is quite simple to make and very good. Even better the next day, too!

Wonderful on a cool winter night!

Very good meatballs... although I made two crucial changes. As another reviewer pointed out, Romano cheese (preferably Locatelli) in place of parmesan is key. Also, a tsp. of sugar in the sauce is also important. That's the way Momma always did it. I love the addition of the currants and pine nuts and encourage folks not to omit them. The flavors they add are subtle but lovely.

I made these meatballs (with jarred sauce that I had jazzed up a bit) for a group of 7 and everyone scarfed it down with many cries of "this is delicious!!" Luckily I had doubled the recipe, using half sausage and half ground sirloin as some reviewers suggested. My store did not have currants, so I used cranberries instead and it worked just fine. Next time I might try raisins though, or I might cut the cranberries into smaller bits. The pine nuts are a wonderful touch, and the fresh basil seems important; I would avoid using dried if you can. A crisp tossed salad, garlic bread, and a nice bottle of red wine made for an excellent (and relatively easy) dinner party.

Awesome meatballs. They also freeze great once cooked for leftovers. Helps to let the wet ingredients in the meatballs to soak together for a bit. Seems to bring the flavor out more. Becuase of the combo of ingredients, you can still cook the meatballs on a higher temperature and maintain tenderness. Serve with a nice Chianti or Pinot Noir.

I've made these meatballs several times, and each time they've received rave reviews and requests for the recipe. One reviewer mentioned that a true Sicilian would use Pecorino Romano, and my Sicilian boss agreed. Therefore, Pecorino it is! I always double up the recipe and go with half sausage and half ground pork as recommended by earlier reviewers. Also, I have to admit that I fry these babies up in good olive oil until they're wonderfully crispy instead of baking them! Truly, the best meatball recipe I've tasted and worth the little extra effort it takes to make them.

I have to cook for 3 men so I always look for hearty dishes. This I picked for a dreary rainy day and they loved it. I had doubled the recipe and every day they asked if there was any left. The meatballs didn't brown very well- I'd raise the heat to 375 (instead of 350) next time- I baked them at the recommended 350 for an extra 15mins which I think dried them a little.

The meatballs are perfect. The currants provide a hint of sweetness and the nuts add an unexpected crunchy texture. I had to substitute finely chopped almonds for the pine nuts as the stores around here didn't carry them. The sauce is simple and chunky, and doesn't detract from the meatballs...maybe a little too chunky for some tastes.

I also used a mixture of 12 oz. of Italian sausage and 4 oz. ground sirloin. The meatballs are light and delicious. Also easy. I took the advice and used a different tomato sauce (I like Patricia Well's recipe from Trattorria"). These meatballs will be a staple around here.

The meatballs are very tasty, but the sauce was not the best. The water boils off from the tomatoes before it is done and was only chunky tomatoe at the end. I had to ad a bit of left over jarred pasta sauce to make it work. It also needed a little sugar to cut the tomato strength.

As far as spaghetti and meatballs goes, this is the great, and more elegant than the standard. I wasn't sure about the pine nuts and currants but they were great--all of you who left them out should try it with them--they aren't overpowering at all. I venture to say that your guests won't even notice except to comment on how great everything tastes. I think will serve it next time with tagliatelle in order to catch more of the sauce.

I've made this recipe many times. This time I used 1/2 ground lamb and 1/2 ground beef. I always use Italian flavored bread crumbs, it's what I'm used to. But, I've not tried the currents. One day I will. This is THE BEST MEATBALL RECIPE I've ever eaten! If my Sicilian grandma were on the Internet, I wouldn't admit that. The pine nuts give a wonderful flavor. For those that had trouble getting them off the pan, I suggest a metal spatula turned up-side-down (for more leverage) and they slide right off. Make sure you get the brown part! My three sons LOVE these. I double the recipe and freeze the extras. Later, I drop the frozen meatballs into the sauce and heat. One of my all time favorite recipes! Try it! You won't go back to your old meatball recipe. Thank you Epicurious, for a great Web site.

I made this recipe and agree that the meatballs are outstanding! After reading the other comments I decided to use a different sauce. I searched this data base and found an outstanding sauce called "Spicy Tomato Sauce; Bon Appetit March 1999". If you put that sauce with these meatballs you can't miss. The only diffence is that I added 1/4 pound of lean ground beef to the italian sausage. It gave the meatballs a little firmer consistancy, and to the sauce I added chopped peppers and mushrooms. It's wonderful!

Rating: 3
I have made these meatballs several times and they are wonderful, esp. with the addition of currants and pine nuts. The sauce is very so-so. If you have another recipe you like better, go for it. Also, I took someone's earlier suggestion of doing half ground beef and half italian sausage. Having made them both ways, I like half and half best.

Rating: 3
Ok, the sauce is unispired and basically a base in which to add other good interesting things. I used a 1lb of 94% lean sirloin and skipped the pine nuts and currants- but only because I used a more interesting sauce, and didnt want a flavor war. Otherwise the meatballs were perfect- i browned them before baking, and then simmered in sauce for an additional hour. this is a good recipie for beginners

Rating: 3
Let me suggest some "fixes," based on a nearly identical recipe handed down by my Sicilian grandmother. To the sauce, add 1 lrg can tomato paste, 1 Tbsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. dried oregano. The meatballs also can be made with 3/4 lb. ground sirloin and 1/4 lb. ground pork, rather than the sausages; and lately I've also tried ground turkey to lighten it, with success.

What is this "Sicilian thing", this contempt for the mundane, this irreverence of the commonplace paradigm? How astonishingly clever to use currants. Altogether, not a bad recipe.

This is simply the best meatball recipe I have found. Delicious and moist. And so easy to make, with no mess to clean up on the stove. However, the sauce is a total disaster. No flavor at all. In fact, because of this poor tasting sauce, I am now canning my own tomato sauce recipe.

Anyone who doesn't like this recipe probably eats nothing more interesting than baked chicken and mashed potatoes. I hate mediocre, ordinary food. I love dishes with novel touches. This is my favorite meatball recipe. My husband's favorite too. The meatballs are tender, moist, and flavorful. This is being written by someone who eats very,very little beef. The currants and the pine nuts make this dish a knockout.

Great dinner. I made it for a Soprano's premiere party last night and it was easy and delicious. I used a slow-cooker for the sauce and just sauteed the onions and garlic and then threw everything in and let it simmer all day. Some substitutions: I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and used half ground beef and half sausage for the meatballs--super moist and tender. I also used half crushed/half diced tomatoes, this was a good consistency. I also threw in some fresh oregano and just a little red pepper (gave it a little kick). Will definitely make again, great for a company (just be sure no one is allergic to pine nuts).

my boyfriend said that was the best spaghetti he's ever had. he finished 2 plateful!! i used ground beef instead of the sausage, fried it in a pan instead of baking them. i sprinkled a little of sugar to the sauce at the end. turned out wonderful. can't wait to make it again.

I give this three forks, but I am by no means a huge spaghetti fan. My italian boyfriend gave it four! The meatballs were very easy to make and were just delicious, especially the flavor of the pine nuts. I cheated on the sauce and just used Classico 4 Cheese Tomato Sauce doctored up with lots of garlic and spices. He couldn't tell the difference. I will definitely keep this on file!

Rating: 3
I would give this recipe 4 forks but since my grandparents were from Sicily, all I can say is PARMESEAN?? NO WAY!!! Sicilians use Romano Pecorino and definately not Locatelli Romano. My Mother won't eat sauce without it and truthfully, neither would I. Otherwise.. it's a good recipe!

We loved this recipe and you will, too. The combination of flavors is delightful and cooking the meatballs in the oven really takes the mess and constant stove top watching away. I made a slight alteration to the recipe. Thinking an all-sausage meatball would be heavy, I made them instead with half sausage and extra lean ground beef. They turned out light and delicious. Matter of fact, after writing this, I think I'll make them tonight! Make plenty, like most pasta, it's even teriffic reheated as lunch the day after.

This was a great, hearty recipe. I made it the night before running the Bolder Boulder 10K. I made it with turkey sausage instead, and it was really good (with less fat, too). I also added some red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it a kick. The currants and toasted pine nuts were a refreshing taste. I, too, ground up the nuts before making the meatballs. I'll definitely make this one again!

This dish has become our family's favorite pasta! The meatballs are divine, and I have found that if you chop the onions in a food processor very fine, your sauce is significantly improved. The fresh basil nakes all the difference. We're serving it for our Mother's Day weekend!

Spent a lot of time finding the ingredients and what seemed like half a day preparing this dish. Had 10 people over for dinner and this was the main course. I was definately underwhelmed.

Unfortunately it is not. Skip it.

I USED HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE AND "PROGRESSO" ITALIAN STYLE BREAD CRUMBS AND DOUBLED THE RECIPE. THE MEATBALLS NEED TO BE TURNED AFTER 15 MINUTES TO PREVENT STICKING. THIS RECIPE IS ABSOLUTELY SUPER. MY "OUTLAWS" ARE ITALIAN AND THEY LOVE IT.

These meatballs were wonderful even though I didn't have currents on hand. I am impressed by how easy they were to prepare. Baking rather than frying is a great idea because you don't have to tend to them, leaving you free to start the sauce. (Which was also very nice. Can't wait to try it with fresh tomatoes this summer!)

I thought these meatballs were ho-hum; not bad, but certainly NOT great. They tried to burn in the oven, but I caught the sneaky little buggers in time. However, they did stick to the pan. I liked the pine nuts, and will incorporate them into another meatballs recipe when I find one (not this one). I can't put my finger on what was wrong with these - just blah. Could it be that I used dried basil rather than very expensive this time of year fresh? I did double+ the dry herb. Oh well, whatever the problem, I'm still on the great meatball search. Any suggestions???

These meatballs were OK, but... Here's how to make great meatballs: mix the following in a bowl: 1 lb. ground beef (10% fat), water-soaked stale italian bread (about 3-4 one inch slices, press out excess water), 1/2 cup grated parmigianno cheese, 1/4 tsp. grated nutmeg, 2 Tbs. granulated garlic powder, fresh parsley, 1/2 cup pine nuts (pignoli), 1 large whole egg, salt/pepper (lots of pepper). Here's the real trick: before you fry them in about 1/2 inch of olive oil, roll the raw meatballs (about the size of a golf ball) around in flavored bread crumbs!(I use 4C) Then fry until golden brown and place on paper towel to drain. I guarantee they will be the best meatballs you've ever tasted!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I've made this several times and we always enjoy it. The fresh basil, pine nuts, and currents give a wonderful subtle flavor. The second time, I slightly increased the amount of currents and personally liked it better. The recipe is easy and the flavors blend even better the second day. Our local grocery store does not sweet-spice their gourmet sausage, so I experimented until I found a more flavorful blend. The type of sausage mixture can dramatically change the taste of the meatballs. For a quick meal, the Sauce alone is excellent on pasta or ready-made tortellini.

Rating: 4
Great stuff!!! I used my own home-made sauce, and substituted turkey sausage(no one noticed the difference and couldn't believe it when I let them in on my little secret) and currant jelly (couldn't find currants in my local grocery store). This really reduced the fat content and made the recipe as healthy as possible. Served it over linguine to two co-workers, and they RAVED. One even asked for the recipe so he could give it to his wife; he said he usually does not like meatballs, but these were wonderful. Sounds like a ringing endorsement to me!! I will definitely make these again.

Delicious! I made this for a Saturday night dinner with my boyfriend, and he loved it, especially the meatballs. The sauce was great; I made it about 2 hours ahead so the flavors could meld.

Oh, and the leftovers were great!

The meatballs were fantastic! My husband and I thought they were very tasty. However, my 6 year old daughter didn't care for them, and she's not usually so picky. I think it was the pine nuts that threw her off of what a "normal" meatball should look like. I'd give the meatballs 4 forks, however, the sauce wasn't the best, so I gave the overall dish 3 forks. Next time I make it, I'll probably use my own spaghetti sauce with the meatballs.

As someone who has made more meatballs than she cares to remember, I found this recipe both different and delicious. The currants and pine nuts add a wonderful flavor and texture to the meatballs.

I first made this recipe with ground turkey since I was entertaining some friends that don't like to eat pork or beef. They all simply raved about the meal and the guys didn't even realize they were eating turkey!! The second time I made them I used pork. I figured my husband would prefer it and the flavor would be so much stronger. I found that we couldn't stop eating them once they were cooked. However, once they were added to a sauce the meatballs themselves lost alot of flavor. Next time I would just add the meatballs to the sauce just before serving. The currants and pine nuts are an excellent addition. I like to go heavy on the currants now!

This is a really good recipe. The meatballs were delicious, and very unusual.

As with all Italian food, the longer the simmer the better the flavor. The red sauce should simmer at least 2 hours. Let it sit overnight and finish the meatballs the next day and add to the red sauce. AND.....don't forget the pine nuts and currants.

This makes the sauce as good as the meatballs.
