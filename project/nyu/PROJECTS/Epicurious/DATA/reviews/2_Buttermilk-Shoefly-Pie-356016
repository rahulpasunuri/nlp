I made this as written, except I used blackstrap molasses. I really liked it, as did my brother. One guest though it was "interesting" and ate his whole piece and another didn't like the molasses at all. I would make this for my family, as we all like molasses a lot, but not for guests.

I've never had a shoefly pie but, we like this unusual combo. when I made this last fall. I had NO problems making this the amount etc. worked perfectly. While not my favorite pie others liked it more then I did & it was quickly finished. I don't make pie very often but I will prob. make this again htis fall.

I had never eaten Shoofly Pie before making this. I think the intent of combining the buttermilk custard with the shoofly topping is to cut the strong flavor of the latter, but the amount of custard this recipe makes fills a regular size pie plate entirely, and its flavor is not interesting enough for that. I don't think many kids would like this recipe. If I were to ever make this again, I would cut the amount of custard by 1/3 and double the amount of shoofly topping.

I grew up eating "Shoofly" pie as a kid and loved it. I thought I would try this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. It was not well-received, and I wound up throwing half the pie away. The molasses part was overpowering and the buttermilk part was too tangy. The only thing good about this recipe was the pastry dough. I would NOT recommend making this pie, and I usually love Shoofly pie. Thank goodness we had a store-bought pumpkin pie as backup!
