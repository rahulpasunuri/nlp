based on some other Falafel reviews - I added coriander with the cumin. Husband thought dinner was good - falafel on top of lettuce with tomatoes and the sauce. Careful with the lemon in the sauce... I also left the chickpea rather chunky - and added a second egg... Next time would recommend pureeing the chickpeas longer...

I thought this recipe was generally good. Like some other reviewers, I wasn't crazy about the texture (I used canned beans) - it may have had more bite if I had skipped the food processor and mashed/chopped/mixed everything by hand and or used dried beans. I also added 3 tablespoons of cornmeal to the mixture, since it was way too gloopy to make balls/patties. Loved the yoghurt sauce, though may decrease the cayenne a little in the future. Delicious in a pita with shredded red peppers.

I am not doing the forks because i didn't actually make the falafel but I did make the yogurt sauce. I am really surprised they called for the same amount of herbs as yogurt, which I didn't use. It was PLENTY with a little over half. 5 large garlic is also a lot of garlic and I never thought I would say that. Also, from what I have read, with authentic falafel, prepared chick peas are NOT used. Of course not from a can, but also not cooked, only soaked

I know that it isn't really fair to rate a recipe when one changes the recipe, but here's my variation - a huge success at a big cocktail party of hungry people. I changed some to the ingredients because the flavors predominated elsewhere on the table. No onion, no cilantro, no cayenne. Half the garlic, add 1/2 roasted red pepper, shot of Sriracha sauce. Serve with the Sweet Potato Falafel from 101cookbooks.com

Really loved this recipe. Made it with homemade pita bread, which is surprisingly simple to make. Yummy.

Loved this recipe! Had a problem with the consistency to make the patties. Just added more flour and then added to the pan. It was wonderful. I like my food spicey so I had this with a spicey, pickled jalapeno. Fantastic!

After reading the reviews, I made some changes which seemed to solve some of the problems other cooks noted. I chopped the onion and cilantro first, then to solve the blandness issue I added ground cumin, coriander, dried garlic, a dash of sesame oil, salt, pepper, and yes, I know it's not traditional, but a small bit of chile powder. To address the texture issue, I pureed 1/2 a can of chickpeas to nearly hummus consistency, removed that, then just pulsed the remainder leaving some chunks. I also added 1/4 C of cornmeal instead of flour which contributed a nice color and added the grainy texture I find in restaurant falafel. I then combined everything including the egg and fired them according to recipe. Served with yogurt sauce, Middle Eastern flatbread from Trader Joes, and a tomato/cucumber salad dressed w/ balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper and EVOO. Even my super picky kids liked it.

I was very disappointed by this recipe. I love falafel, and it does not taste like falafel at all. It fried up okay and stayed together fine, but it just tasted like a sloppy mushy mess on the inside. If you are going to try making this recipe, I would recommend leaving the mixture as chunky as possible.

This was fantastic! Other than making small patties, I followed this recipe exactly. Served with a side of hummus, olives + small pita triangles. Delicious. Can't wait to make again.

This was delicious. It definitely was a pain to make (should not have been in the "Too Busy to Cook" section) but I will make it again because it has great flavors. I particularly loved the yogurt sauce with it. I definitely agreed with other posters that making smaller patties would be more managable, as I had a lot of trouble working with larger patties. Overall, a great recipe.

Fantastic! A bit of a pain, but worth it. I made smaller patties. The texture was wonderful, crisp on the outside and soft inside. The yoghurt sauce was also very good. This meal tasted just like it did the first time I had it, at a stand in Amsterdam (with the addition of some cucumbers).

Rating: 3
This was super good. A bit time consuming but worth it. One tip: use sweet onions. I think the onion I used was a bit overripe and overpowered the yogurt sauce. I followed other reviewer's advice and kept the falafel paste a bit chunky- good idea. I also made much smaller patties which I think is much easier to handle.

My first time making this dish and it turned out great, thanks to the other helpful tips in the reviews. I rolled into balls and used sour cream instead of yogurt. All the flavor was simply awesome! A new staple for me.

I didn't make the falafel, just the sauce and it was really easy and very good. I did think 1/4 tsp of cayenne was too much for my taste and ended up adding more yogurt to cut the burn.

These are always a hit with some hummus, pita bread, and sliced vegetables for sandwiches. Roll them in sesame seeds before frying for extra tasty crunch. A really good quality processor would make this a lot easier, but they still come out great with a cheap one.

Instead of putting it all in pita bread, I made it into a big salad. Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, falafel, a drizzle of tahini...and that delicious cilantro yogurt made for a fantastic dressing. Great flavor and easy to make/keep. Loved it!

Started out to be a total disaster. I doubled the recipe which made it way too sticky to form patties. Added flour to thicken mixture which made it too bland. Next time, will make only a single batch and completely drain garbanzo beans, which in my opinion is the most important part of the recipe! Good though, family enjoyed it. P.S. Pat them out small and thin, the cripsier the tastier!

This was awesome! THe flavors came through and the mixture came together great. I doubled the recipe, dipped them in breading meal and fried them as idividual rounds and not patties. The sauce was great too. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and it was just as tasty! This was a definite hit at the dinner table!

Does anyone have a reciipe for Baba Ghanoush? (Pureed eggplant sauce...) It tastes amazing on falafels. I also like a bit of feta in the pita.

Rating: 2
I substituted pinto beans for the chickpeas, which produced a very dry consistency that barely stayed together while frying. I also added sesame oil, parsley and lemon juice, and I left out the egg which in my opinion falafel doesn't need.

I couldn't believe how easy this was, or how tasty. We had it for dinner, with pita bread, hummus & a tabouli salad. I added more spice than listed, 3 teaspoons of "Ras el Hanout" (a north african spice mix with peppercorns, rose petals, cumin, cayenne etc.) and added 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds. I would be careful not to process it too finely, as a bit of texture is nice. I also formed it into little balls (it made 18 med size balls) instead of patties. This will become a new standby in our house.

Quite a nice delicate chickpea flavor, though a tad bland. I added some ground cloves to the yogurt and wrapped them in paratha bread (from my local Indian grocery) hot from the griddle. A simple dish that can be made when you get home from work.

Great! This was delicious (loved the yogurt/cilantro sauce)and easy. Have been trying recipes to avoid fat and meats (cholesterol reasons) so used my Misto (olive oil pump spray) to use bare minimum of oil. I formed into balls and had no problem with sticking. My husband loved it so will add to a regular rotation in our new diet.

I thought this recipe was terrific! But I didn't make patties, I made falafel balls like you get in restaurants. They didn't fall apart, maybe because I refrigerated them for a couple of hours. They were soft and delicious.

Delicious my whole family loved it. The cakes did fall apart a bit when I fried them, but I wasn't too concerned about it.

I love the flavor of these falafels. For those who say theirs fell apart. The change I make to this recipe is to puree the chickpeas then press through a sieve. the puree I make into hummus and the chunky bits I use for these. Two dishes in one and both delicious!

Excellent, I've made several times! I used chopped cukes in the falafel. I also use sour cream instead of the sour yogurt! It may not be low fat but it tastes wonderful this way!!!

I was very happy with the way this recipe came out. Very garlicky and lemony. I wasn't sure about the yogurt sauce instead of tahini but it added a nice flavor and brought it all together nicely. I bet chopped cucumber would be a nice addition to the yogurt sauce. Maybe next time.

I thought it was tasty, but I'd add much more greens next time to make the texture more grainy/less mushy. Really greasy too.. Definitely blot before serving!

This recipe has been a stand-by in my house. We love it! I have one amendment that I add...I bake an eggplant until it caves in and add the pulp to the chick peas as they are whirling in the food processor. It gives it that extra middle east flavor that I love. The dressing is perfect, too.

This recipe was very disappointing in all aspects. The texture was impossible to work with, the taste was something I can not even describe and the appearance was one I don't care to recall. We have started calling it the awful falafel in my house. I love falafel but this recipe really wasn't worth the time it took to prepare.

Rating: 3
Great flavor, but the garbanzo bean mixture came out too thin to easily make patties out of. With some extra flour I was able to barely get them to hold together enough to fry in the oil. Any suggestions for next time?

Very, very nice. I had leftover uncooked falafels, which I refrigerated. The next evening I sauteed them and they were every bit as good as the night before. I love make ahead dishes for entertaining and this is perfect for that.

Never thought that I would have falafel like I've had in NYC. This recipe is wonderful and pretty easy to make. I made smaller patties that were easier to put in pitas and added cucumber with the fixings. The cilantro yogurt added the perfect coolness to it. Absolutely fabulous! (Try with a little Tahini too.)

Rating: 3
I was quite pleased with this recipe, both because it actually tasted like falafel and because the cilantro yogurt sauce is a good alternative to the standard tahini sauce (the sesame paste is hard to find here and tends to be expensive). Other bonuses include the fact that it keeps pretty well and once the mix is made, I can just fry up a few patties anytime I get hungry. I found that the recipe made more falafel than there was sauce for, but maybe that's because I made the falafel patties a little smaller than recommended (easier to keep together and fry). All in all, great for everyday lunches.

Great recipe. I don't think I followed the all of the ingrediant measurements exactly, but it still turned our wonderful. Would definitely make this again.

Wow- 3.5 forks! I can't believe I just made these delicious falafels at home without the industrial deep fryer! I suggest putting more oil in the skillet (about an inch) so that the patties are half submerged. (I mixed regular veg. oil with the olive oil to economize.) I also substituted Lavash bread for Pita, and spread it with ¼ c hummus (store bought) before assembling.

I thought this was the best falafel recipe I have ever tried. Even my husband, who claims that I'm trying to kill him every time I prepare a meatless entree, thought it was great. The yogurt sauce is delish and the falafel is also great with tzatziki (cucumber, garlic, dill and yogurt) sauce.

Rating: 2
I like the falafel in this recipe - when I make it I tend to deep-fry though in moderately hot oil (if it's too hot the centre will not be cooked properly). If you can get hold of it, a little Spanish smoked paprika in the mix adds a great deal to the depth of flavour

Teriffic! I'm a big falafel fan and this recipe was just the right combination of flavors. Even my husband who is not a fan loved it. will surely make again.

I've been looking for a falafel recipe for a long time, ever since I first tried falafel at a Lebanese restaurant, and this one is very good. I replaced the cilantro with Italian parsley, as I'm not cilantro fan. The flavor of both the sauce and the chick pea patties was delciious. The only thing I would do differently next time is to blend the chick pea mixture a little less because I think the texture would have been better more "chunky". I added chopped cucumber in addition to the tomatoes and lettuce which is something I remembered from the Lebaneses restaurant -- a great addition.

This recipe was really good, really authentic, really easy to make. I adjusted the spice to my family's taste, but it was good prepared exactly to the recipe. Try it with some alfalfa sprouts, humus, tehina and WARM pita!

The taste of the falafel was good but it completely fell apart and i had to smoosh it into the pita. The sauce was nice.

I can't comment on the cilantro yogurt since I made a cucumber-dill sauce instead (I don't like cilantro). However, the falafel itself was delicious and a lot easier to make than I thought.
