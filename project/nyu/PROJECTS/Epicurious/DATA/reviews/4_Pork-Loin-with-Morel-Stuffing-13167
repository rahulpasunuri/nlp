Wow! What a great choice for a dinner party, even for serving those food savvy friends we all have and desperately want to impress. I took a few liberties with the stuffing by adding pistachios & seasoned croutons instead of plain breadcrumbs that I rehydrated in a little white wine as I did with the morels. Plated on roasted garlic & parmesan rustic mashed potatoes with a morel and shallot demi-glace. A truly wonderful recipe I will make again...for a different group of savvy guests, of course!

I just made this for Easter dinner and it was phenomenal. The stuffing makes the dish. I was fortunate enough to find fresh morels at the farmers' market, so I used about half fresh and half dried. I butterflied & trussed the loin to stuff it. I also rolled the pork in a mixture of flour, herbes de Provence, and salt & pepper before browning. Following others' suggestions, I didn't put lime juice in my sauce and deglazed the pan with white wine. I added a couple tablespoons of reduced apple cider, which gave a tangy/fruity note that was good in a way that went well with the pork (I feel weird about lime with pork and mushrooms.) Overall, though, it's all about the stuffing. (...and high-quality, well-cooked pork!) Absolutely delicious.

I made this in 1997 and lost the recipe. My guests and husband loved the recipe and still talk about it. I can't wait to make it!

For those complaining about the price of morels (yep they are expensive) go to the Fungus Amongst website. You can get 1/2 pound of very nice dried morels for $60 or so. A half pound is a s*** load of morels! Great prices on other dried shrooms too!

It's also good with a mix of lime and orange juice, though it utterly changed the flavor, and one can substitute dried wild mushrooms for the morels if they're hard to find.

I made this recently for guests, and I loved having a "make- ahead" dish. I didn't find it difficult to cut the whole through the pork loin, but that may have been because I had two smaller loins rather than one large one. I think I did not have the right balance of mushrooms to bread crumbs (too much of the latter) so I will add more mushrooms next time. Also, I think it needed more salt in general. Otherwise, it made for a very nice presentation and it got favorable reviews from guests of all ages.

I made this for a dinner party and it was excellent! I doubled the recipe and used two, 3- pound pork loins to feed 10 people with just a couple of slices left over. I stuffed the pork loin the day before the party and it worked perfectly. I found the easiest method for stuffing was to insert the knife from both ends to make a hole and then use your fingers to widen the hole and push the stuffing through to the middle. It was messy, but relatively easy. Total cooking time was about 55 minutes and I probably would take it out about 5 minutes earlier next time I make it. It was well done, but still very juicy and delicious. Everyone cleaned their plates!

I made this under trying conditions and it was not impressive, though I will make it again when I'm in my own kitchen. I followed the advice of one reader and wrapped the butterflied stuffed roast in cheesecloth before browning and roasting, and I did not like the results. The cheesecloth sticks to the roast and you don't get the yummy browned bits I like so much. Also, being on vacation and not having the time to make a demiglace or find a good source for it, I used the Knorr demiglace recommended by one reader and it was disgusting, full of salt, cornstarch, and MSG. So my two fork rating is probably an unfair reaction to my disappointment at turning out a mediocre meal.

After I made some modifications, this recipe turned out great. I used pork tenderloin and adjusted the roasting time. I toasted small cubes of brioche instead of plain bread crumbs, then added some of the morel stock, a little brown chicken stock and melted butter. Also, for the sauce, I sauteed bacon, added shallots and garlic, a little flour, deglazed the pan with white wine, added the reduced morel stock, then brown chicken glace (veal stock takes forever to make, so I usually sub in brown chicken stock that I make myself). I let it go for a bit to allow the flavors to meld, strained it, reduced the sauce to nappant and seasoned it (didn't need much salt because of the bacon and the glace). I don't salt my glace, but when you reduce stock to a glace it often has a nature saltiness to it. I added the reserved morels to heat through then finished it last minute with a smidge of butter. I served it with sauteed swiss chard and potato turnip gratin.

This was very good. I used Panko instead of the bread crumbs and added a small amount of chix broth to moisten the mixture. After it was seared and ready to go in the oven I patted panko and freshly grated parmesan cheese on the top and sides which gave it a nice crust. This is a keeper!

used button mushrooms and butterflied the loin then stuffed. Loved it!

This was delicious. I used what I had on hand - dried shitakes, beef broth substituted for the demiglace, and wine instead of lime juice. I reduced the sauce at the end to thicken. I'm sure it would be even better if you stick to the exact recipe, but I will make again either way.

I made this with a Pork Loin. I'm surprised more people haven't complained about how hard it is to come up with Veal Demi-glace. I wasn't about to spend a fortune on Veal bones and boil all day, so I ordered some Veal Demi-glace Armont from the web at: http://www.chefsresource.com/clasfrenroas.html It was fantastic. I also roasted some onion and root veggies with the pork which was a big hit.

I had all the ingredients on hand except the demiglace so i improvised with the mushroom stock by simmering it and adding a scoop of dijon mustard and a bit of heavy cream, reduced it and then added the reserved chopped morels. It was so delicious that i am making again for company.

This recipe was great! Followed it to a T, and even though the Morels were expensive (about 8 bucks for a .5 oz), went the whole 9. I was glad I did, because those mushrooms are truly DELICIOUS! I like the idea of bread crumbs on the exterior and will try that next time, along with some garlic in the stuffing, and some parm cheese on the outside. Highly recommended!

Sumptuous!! I had a 1/2 oz. of dried morrels and a mountain of dried (re-hydrated with the morrels) chantrelles I picked a few months ago. The only other change I made was to roll the beast in bread crumbs mixed with thyme before I roasted it. My wife took her first bite and glared at me like I won't be thrown out soon. We're eating the leftovers tonight. Life is good!!!

I thought this was good, but not as great as others. That said, it makes a beautiful presentation--just like the picture (except the very middle of the pork loin, which I didn't reach with the stuffing!). The morels were so expensive ($15.00 for 1/2 ounce), that I couldn't do the full 1.5 ounces. I just bought 1/2 ounce, and used more bread. I think porcinis would work well as a substitute, and even give more mushroom flavor to the dish. I'd make again, but this isn't one of those recipes that I can't wait to return to.

I used a pork loin. I just cut open the center. I then browned it. I stuffed it. Covered it with cheese cloth and then tied it up. Put it in a pan and put some of the juice in the pan. I check it every 20 mins and added more juice. This was delicious. My guests loved it. It is definately a remake! I had one hard to please guest at my house and she loved it.

This was excellent! I browned the pork in a cast iron skillet and baked it in the same pan. As for soaking the mushrooms, I used 1 1/2 cups of boiling water and 1 cup of white wine. I substituted 1 medium Vadalia onion and 1 clove crushed garlic for the shallot. When making the demiglace sauce, I deglazed the cast iron skillet with white wine then used a demiglace packet purchased from Harris Teeter and 1 can of beef broth and thickened it a little with corn starch. Served with wild rice, green beans almondine and Asiago Cheese Baguette. NOTE: Shallot substitutes: green onions (white part only) OR onions (1 small onion = 3 shallots) + dash crushed garlic OR red onion OR green onions OR garlic.

A very nice dish. Very appealing to the eye and equally so to the taste. Next time I will substitute the lime juice with some dry white wine and probably use half demi-glace and half stock. The sauce came out a little heavy on the demi-glace. I usually like cooking with citrus but I think a less tangy sauce would suit the meat more appropriately. BTW, as someone pointed out, buy morels on Ebay!!! You can get them for half the usual price!

Dried morels can be obtained reasonably on ebay. I'm not kidding--the ones I got were great and cheap.

This was GREAT!! My Husband raved and he is V.Picky! I strayed a bit from the recipe in that I used pork lion steaks (2inch thick) and halved the stuffing and gravy as it was only dinner for two. Also, soaked the mushrooms in 1/2 water 1/2 white wine. Agree with other reviewer "Better Than Gourmet" is the way to go there products are great and much easier than from scratch. Served over mixed wild rice and baked acorn squash on side! Perfect dreary day in front of the fire meal!

Served this to my family for my mom's birthday dinner - everyone loved it. The gravy is delicious; make sure you use a good demi-glace.

Wonderful! I made this for dinner this evening. I substituted black mushrooms for morrels...simply because I had them in the cupboard. They gave it a rich flavor. I paired the loin with butternut squash and a salad. My husband keeps repeating "This is the best meal you've every made." I'm not sure I would go that far, but this is definitely a keeper.

I made this for my mother-in-law who has cooked for me for 23+ years and wanted to impress her. I was very pleased how well this turned out. It will become an Easter tradition for the table. Now everyone in my family would like me to make this for them. Need more morels!!!

I was feeling spring-ish and made this last night for a party of 6 and it was wonderful!! Served with roasted asparagus and feta-vidalia risotto. I had a hard time finding demiglace and hesitantly used a dry mix which made only one cup but that was plenty. I used 1 oz. dried morels for the stuffing, and then used 3.5 oz. fresh morels for the sauce, which I sauteed in butter and a wee bit of garlic first. I had no idea morels were as expensive as they are and will try it again with other wild mushrooms. Also key: I stuffed the loin one day ahead and let it sit out wrapped for 2 hours to bring to room temperature, and the cooking time was exactly 1 hour (I'm betting the loin that took 2 hours below was very cold). Excellent!

In a word, fabulous. In two words really fabulous. I butterflied the loin and rolled/trussed it. Thought it would be easier, and it was althought it tended to unroll a bit when served. The demiglace was great, in fact we ran out of it; garlic mashed potatoes seem to beg for a big ladle of the gravy, so next time I will double the amount. I used my standard More Than Gourmet Demi-Glace Gold. Did a taste test and it was hard to tell from the home version. Watch the cooking time as it does continue to cook while resting, and a overdone loin is no fun to be around.

Very tasty! Great for company, holiday or just because you deserve a great meal... I made it with pork tenderloin instead of roast - otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe as-is and it was great. (baked for about 18 minutes until internal temp was 160 degrees)

I made this dish for my husband and we just fell in love with it! I am normally not a pork eater, but this I cannot pass up. I did use dried Oyster and Porcini Mushrooms instead of the Morels, which worked just as fine. I also had a hard time stuffing the pork, but with a little patience I was able to do it and it definitely was worth it. I did modify the sauce by omitting the lime juice and used red wine and beef stock with the mushroom stock. I will definitely make this dish again.

I made this for Easter dinner and purchased the specified 3.5lb Pork, I found the cooking time was quite a bit longer than recipe (closer to 2 hours) to reach desired 160 internal temperature, however, it was worth the wait. The stuffing and sauce turned out wonderfully (I used Knorr packet of Demi Glace)and the meat was tender. My family loved it and thought next time to use a tenderloin; I am e-mailing the recipe to my mom now!

Oh, this was just wonderful! It made for a beautiful Easter dinner. Spring for the demiglace if you can find it - the sauce is so rich! I used 2/3 of the dried morels called for and added about a half-cup of chopped Shiitake mushrooms. Yum, yum, yum. I, too, pulled the roast out of the oven at 140 degrees and it continued cooking while resting, up to 155 degrees. Don't overcook. TERRIFIC!

We made this for our pinocchle bunch last night and it was great! We, too, couldn't find morels so used shitakes. Very moist & tasty!

I couldn't find morel mushrooms so I used shitake and it was still great. I cooked to 160 degrees and it was moist. (My meat thermometer told me I should go to 175 for pork and poultry!) I only bought a small tub of demiglace and mixed it with beef broth. The sauce was fine - not a gravy but still very tasty.

This is a great dish that looks very impressive on the plate. It's moist and flavorful. I never cook pork to 160 though! Haven't these magazines heard....restaurants are now asking people how they want their pork cooked,(ie; med rare, med) and 140 is fine! Especially when the meat rests for 10 minutes - it keeps cooking and if you cook to 160 the meat will be dry!

For a change of pace I make a morel-green peppercorn sauce (thicken with cornstarch) to go with this; pouring some over the slices and serving the rest on the side. Great crowd pleaser!

Being that I pick and dry Morels in my area in the spring this recipe was a great surprise. It was very good and my guest enjoyed it also. The only change I made was thicken the sauce with corn starch which made it a little tastier for my taste buds.
