Excellent! Will use more sage leaves next time

This was amazing! The dough was very easy to make, and the flavors of the cheeses and red onions worked well together. I will use much more than 6 leaves of sage next time to get more of a sage taste, but otherwise a very good recipe.

good dough, we used it for regular pizza dough for other types of pizza

I'm basically just reviewing the crust here, since I used different toppings, but considering the ease and speed of this dough recipe, it's phenominally good. I topped it with a spicy tomato sauce, a touch of parmesan, near-caramelized red onions, fresh mozzarella and some anchovies, and it's the best pizza I've ever made.

I would make this again w/out the blue cheese. I should probably stop making recipes in which I hate any of the ingredients this much. On another note, I doubled the recipe and baked the pizzas on 2 baking sheets. Other than the difficulty of transferring them to the baking sheets in the first place, everything went OK. Oh -- I forgot about the tin foil stuck on the back. If I made it again, I'd use a bit more olive oil on the foil.

This is the tastiest pizza I've made so far. The combination of flavors is delicious, and you can use just about any combination of cheeses which you have available. The red onion rings, with small whole sage leaves and sliced black olives on top make for a pretty presentation.

Easy to make and very savory. It would make a better appetizer or lunch than a main course for a dinner. I will try this as an hors d'oeuvre at my next cocktail party.

This pizza was great. I use my own crust recipe, but these toppings were delicious and unusual. (We used Swiss instead of Fontina.) The fresh sage gives it a really nice flavor.
