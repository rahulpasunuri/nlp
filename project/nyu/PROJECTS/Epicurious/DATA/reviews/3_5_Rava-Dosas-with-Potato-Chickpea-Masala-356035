I liked this; I've had little luck with Indian in the past and this one came out good. I did not make the bread with it, I served over rice just to simplify the cooking involved. I'll make this again, I'll only use maybe 1/4 of the jalapeno seeds and increase the curry powder as the hot to flavor ratio seemed like it could use a bit of adjustment for my tastes.

This took me forever to make - the cooktime estimates were off for me. That said, it has a really great flavor, a nice spice level (enough to have some heat and taste Indian without lighting your mouth on fire), but we will probably increase the spice next time. The dosas are super easy to make - we will probably make them with a bunch of stuff

This recipe is so fantastic that I'm reviewing it again. Does anyone know where Melissa Roberts is now that the magazine is gone? This is still my family's favorite recipe and I've made it MANY times. My tips: Don't mess with the blender step, just mince the garlic, jalapeno and ginger fine. Saute the onions in the oil until soft and translucent and then add the spices, jalapeno, ginger, garlic, etc. Why dirty up another appliance? The blender step is unnecessary. I add a little garam masala to the potato mixture to spice it up a little and I also buy the biggest jalapeno I can find. The dosas are not hard, but just take a little time. Add more water to the batter than the recipe calls for and make sure your pan is SCREAMING hot before you pour in the batter. This recipe is revelatory. I would give it 5 stars, if I could.

Even with cutting a lot of corners and getting by with what I had in the pantry, it was delicious.

One of the few dishes that my entire family LOVES. Have made it many times to rave reviews. Daughter is vegetarian so it's hard to find meatless meals that my meat-loving son and hubby will like, but flavorful, spicy foods tend to distract them from the fact that there's no meat in a dish! I did up the water in the dosa batter a little and I did add a little more spice to the masala mixture (some garam masala) for a bit more flavor. This is not a "quick and easy" recipe, although you probably could prepare the masala a day before and reheat it and make the dosas right before serving. Very yummy. This recipe makes me miss Gourmet magazine even more, because it's from the very last (November 2009) issue.

I haven't made this recipe but from the looks it, sounds much harder than what it should be. I'm from Bangalore and dosas are to me what burgers/ sandwiches are to you guys. :) Dosa batter is a headache to make, so the easiest thing to do is head over to the nearest indian store and buy the ready-made batter. Makes life much simpler. Masala dosas are also great with sambar.

This recipe is very good to start with but I added about a can of coconut milk and more salt and cooked it at the end it for A LOT longer. I also added cauliflower because I had it in the house. The dosas recipe didn't work for me, we served it with whole wheat pita, but the naan sounds like a great idea too. I reheated leftovers the next day with brown rice....Delish!

Made it with fewer potatoes but kept everything else the same except reducing the water a bit. Increased the curry and cumin to taste at the end to adjust the flavoring. Didn't have peas or cilantro but it was very good anyway. Served on naan instead of making the dosas and had several Indian chutneys with it. Very good vegetarian dish.

This is a solid B but it's missing something to be an A, delicious, wonderful. And I don´t know what that "somthing" is. That said, I haven`t found too many vegetarian main courses that my non-veg family likes, but they did like this one, so I will make it again. I did up the spices and use more liquid,and ended up putting in even more salt at the end, which I don`t usually do. Chutney was a must. If you don`t do the rava dosas, this comes together quickly and easily, a plus. The cilantro added to the dish. Served with store-bought naan which doesn´t hold a candle to the stuff you get in restaurants. Will make the rava dosas next time.

Made this exactly according to instructions but with about 1 tsp salt added at end... delicious. However, not quick! Heat was minimal - if you like more, up the pepper and curry powder!

NOT QUICK AND EASY! This was good, but it took me a long time to cook. I don't know if I'm slow, or if there are a lot of steps, or what. I used half cauliflower and half potatoes and added 1 tsp of ground cardamom, but other than that, the recipe was unchanged. I felt like I tasted mostly curry and much less of the other spices, so I'd probably add more of them next time.

Me like a lot. I upped the jalapenos to 3 + 3 Serrano peppers - I like spicy. Definitely will become a regular in the rotation.

Wonderful filling. I used hot madras curry, and added ground cumin in addition to whole toasted cumin as well as some cauliflower.I don't think you need to add that much water when boiling the potatoes (as I did and made my potatoes a little mushy). Should've just went with instincts. I did not make dosas but I served mine in some toasted pitas that I brushed with olive oil and a dash of garlic salt although, if I had naan, I would have totally used that with fresh garlic-olive oil. This is wonderful with some garlic-cilantro-lemon yogurt

This recipe was just okay, considering how long it takes to make. The potato & chickpea combination seemed overly filling, and while the taste seemed authentic, it also seemed somewhat bland. We ended up buying a mango chutney sauce to serve with this dish and it helped the flavor. Would probably not make again.

Rava refers to the semolina flour, so a rava dosa doesn't use the urad dal. I made a urad dal masala dosa recipe and find that I preferred the rava dosa recipe as there isn't any grinding or soaking/fermenting required (much easier!). I made the filling without coconut or jalapeno (preparing for kids), but found the flavor a bit lacking. Made up for it with a little bit of chutney. Will definitely make again, but maybe modify the filling. But this is a great intro recipe for people who want to try their hand at dosa making!

I've made this twice with friends and we all loved it. I think I may have increased the spices just a bit. I didn't make the dosas b/c that was too much work for a weeknight. Serving it with naan worked just as well. I like it topped with yogurt too.

This was really good and surprisingly easy! I did need to add more water to get the rava dosa batter to the right consistency. I also used oat flour instead of the rice flour because it's what I had and the rava dosas turned out fine, though they did have a "healthier" flavor. The filling was nice and spicy, next time I'll add a little amchoor powder to round it out. This recipe is definitely a keeper, especially since it mostly uses pantry staples and the fresh ingredients (garlic, cilantro, ginger, etc.) are things I always have around.

Incredible. I am really a "foodie" at heart and I have made some great things, but this is among the best. This recipe truly deserves four forks. The flavours are exceptional in the filling; I would even go a little heavy on the spices if you know you have a high tolerance for Indian. The texture of the rava dosas is superb. The blend of the three flours gives a really unique consistancy-- I would highly recommend sticking to the recipe. The only changes I made were that I used 3/4 lb. Yukon Golds and 3/4 lb. cauliflower cut into small florets. I steamed the cauliflower in advance and added it a little before the frozen peas. I also adjusted the seasonings at the end to my taste; I prefer things a little spicier. But even if you make this dish as is, it is still a great meal, and considering the results, well worth the effort!!

Really enjoyed this. Blending the spices and other ingredients did such a great job of spreading the flavors. Mmm. My changes: no coconut, less oil, 2 cans of chickpeas, 1 chopped bell pepper (added near end) and served over brown rice. Worked just fine without the dosas, which simply seemed like that much more work.

Rating: 4
Delicious, easy, and satisfying! I made the recipe with the following modifications: I used 1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut flakes, and I thought the very subtly sweet flavor was great with the heat of the hot madras curry and the jalapeno. I also subbed 1/2 cup yellow corn meal (semolina flour isn't very easy to find in Japan) and used canola oil in the puree and to fry the dosas (a little over 1/2 tsp oil per dosa). Added maybe a touch more water to the batter, but 2 cups was basically right. The filling recipe definitely makes more than 4 servings, while the batter made enough for about 6 dosas. Hurray for leftovers! The jalapeno adds a slight kick, but I would not call this a spicy dish.

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe. Tastes about as close to authentic as one could wish for without requiring too many special ingredients. The toasted coconut was an especially nice touch. The only thing I would change is to add more water to the dosa batter. It was too thick with only 2 cups and didn't spread out and bubble like it should. I added an extra cup of water to mine and it was perfect. With this one tweak, it is a recipe I will definitely make again and again.

Loved this recipe. Have made it twice in a week. Second time I replaced the potato with cauliflower as an earlier reviewer recommended -- excellent. Pretty spicy -- which I love but could always lessen that if need be

I made this recipe for the first time last night and it was one of the best dishes I had ever made. It was just d outstanding in its flavor and taste. I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it! I had miscalculated a bit the time it took to prepare everything and we ate with a bit of a delay, but the waiting was worthwhile and I cannot wait to cook this again for our children or guests.

Rating: 4
Just excellent! The only ingredient I did not add was the coconut and I thought just as well because the dish leans on the side of being slightly sweet. I highly recommend this recipe and yes, do be sure to use a nonstick skillet and be sure it is oiled and hot before adding Dosa mix. My husband and I felt like we were in India with this one!

I made the filling, sans coconut and it was awesome. Tastes as good as any Indian takeout I've ever gotten, maybe better. Frozen peas don't take 3 minutes to cook though, I would just stir them in at the end. I didn't make the rava dosas so won't rate the recipe.

Easy and tasty dinner that my - sometimes - picky eaters liked quite a bit. Will make it again. The rava dosas were fun.

Haven't made the dosas but the filling is wonderful over rice. I leave out the coconut but otherwise followed the recipe the first time I made it and it was great. Tonight I added a couple of tablespoons of yogurt and two chopped roma tomatoes while the potatoes were simmering. When ready to serve I stirred in juice from a half lemon and sprinkled with cilantro. Great following the recipe, but if serving over rice it's nice to add the extra intgrediants to make it a little saucier.

Used saracha in place of jalapeno (was only thing we didn't have on hand). Added some garam masala (based on previous review). Also, remember to have a hot skillet

This is fun to make with kids or slightly intoxicated new years eve revelers; very interactive! You can sub cauliflower for the potatoes (beware that cauliflower is much wetter and works best if steamed and adequately drained first) for a less carb-y version. Go heavy on the spices and jalapeno, you won't regret it. Delicious. For a variation on the dosa you can use whole wheat flower. mm.

rather disapointning. a bit of lemongrass did wonders, but still the filling needs a lot of work. The dosas are indeed quite good though.

This is a bare bones indian-fusion meal. It wasn't bad-- quite healthy, good additions with the toasted coconut. The dosas were tasty-- I used garbanzo flour instead of rice flour. However, there was not the full, exciting flavor that I expect from meals like these. We added mango powder and garam masala.

Wonderful recipe. Left out the chickpeas and coconut. Added one serrano to the large jalapeno I used. Also put it in a corn tortilla instead of the dosa! Delicious. Left overs for tomorrow...

Delicious, cheap, vegan meal. I skipped the jalapeno and used half a frozen habanero. Used a tsp. of ground cumin instead of seeds, and left the seeds out of the dosas. I also had no coconut and skipped that. Still came out delectable. Make sure you have the pan really hot for the dosas and make them nice and thin.

Nice spicy vegetarian dish. Made it as written except left out the coconut and it was delicious!

Cooked as written, this recipe is extremely spicy. I loved it. The rava dosas taste a little bit sweet and for me it balanced out the spiciness of the masala. My husband thinks it will be better tomorrow- because he thinks that the spice was mostly in the sauce- and hadn't gotten into the potatoes yet. But, he really liked it too. I think that I will make the rava dosas with many other curries in the future.

Good Vegetarian meal very spicy. Looked all over for unsweetened coconut flakes but in the end you couldn't taste them. Also, I think sweet potatoes would be a healthier sub for yukon potatoes. The nan was great.

Fabulous recipe! Make sure the pan is hot when you make the dosa. It took us a couple tries to get it right. I thought it was the perfect level of spice, but some people at our table could have done without the jalapeño.

This recipe is excellent. Couldn't find cumin seeds in our rural grocery, used half the ground cumin. Substituted italian parsley for cilantro and it was quite pretty.

This is a delicious, inexpensive, super-hearty meal. My boyfriend and I eat a lot of southern Indian food and were really excited to try making it at home. It took a few tries to really get the dosas to cook up well--the trick seems to be making sure they're very thin, otherwise they get too doughy. We didn't have much trouble with sticking in our cast-iron skillet as long as we kept it well oiled. The filling was perfect. We did reduce the cumin seeds as suggested above, though. Yum. Looking forward to left-overs tomorrow!

A wonderful vegetarian meal. My only criticism is --too much cumin seed in the potato-chickpea mix. One tsp would be enough, unless you LOVE cumin. And I do. It overwhelms the other flavors. When making the rava dosas--the non-stick pan is a must. I tried it with a regular frying pan and PAM and oil and everything got stuck--and stick to the two minute "don't touch it" directions. I LOVE this recipe, and will continue to tweek it. My Texan born husband thought it was great!

dosas are made with rice and urad dal flours. Why does this recipe call for semolina and all-purpose flour?
