This is one of my favorite desserts to make. I've adapted it a bit and instead of raisins, I include diced braised pears. I then create a caramelized sauce from the braised pear juice to drizzle on top instead of the pine nut sauce. Depending on the audience, a bourbon or rum sauce is a perfect addition.

This is one of the best desserts I ever had. When I heard the main ingredient was polenta, I was a little nervous. I made it in small individual springform pans so everyone could have their own.

This cake is so easy to make, my family loved it. It is tasty and sophisticated. I used a hand mixer to get out the lumps. Knowing that it would be sweet, I used half the amount of raisins. I grinded the pine nuts and spinkled on the top. The sauce was a little much for me.

This cake was better than I expected. Interesting rich taste, a little on the sweet side. I made it in a mixer and it turned out fine. The sauce was easy, but took longer to make then expected. Make sure you make the sauce well in advance so it thickens.

This desert is diferent than any other cheese cake I have made. The sauce is so easy to make but looks very complicated. It was an instant hit.
