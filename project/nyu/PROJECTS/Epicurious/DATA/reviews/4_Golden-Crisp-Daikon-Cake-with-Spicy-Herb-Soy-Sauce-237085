This was a really good use of daikon when my CSA gave us daikon for two week straight and I'd already made kimchi. All I can say about it is: 1) my bamboo strainer wouldn't fit with my cake pan under the wok's lid, so I used a ramekin. Worked fine. 2) it says steam until "firm to the touch". But you'll find it's still a bit moist and squishy, on account of being glutinous and in a steamer. It sets up more when it cools. 3) It says to fry about 5 minutes a side. But has you cut the cake into little batons. I interpreted that as fry each of the four sides... They got a bit more Golden Crisp than they should have been... Still tasty though. Don't skip the lop chong, it gives it a certain somethin somethin that can't be replicated. Unless you're vegetarian or something, then add a bit of five spice. The sausage is easy to find at asian markets, they're small and red, and usually labeled Sweet Pork Sausage.

This was fun to make, and had a very authentic flavor, which I loved. Instead of the dipping sauce, I used Soba Noodle Sauce. Good keeper, too. Will definitely make again.

Two of my co-workers who are Chinese said this tasted really authentic, and had seconds and thirds! One note: the dried shrimp really reeked when I first added them to the mixture, and I didn't measure them carefully. I'd recommend using a bit less than called for, to reduce the "fishiness" of the final product.
