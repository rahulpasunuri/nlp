This is delicious served as a shrimp taco or burrito. I went easy on the jalapeno and shallot, and my 3-year-old twins devoured it. A favorite for sure!

I have been making this since I saw it in the magazine in 2009 - I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out amazing every time - worthy of company but it's a family staple - a 'go to' recipe during the week when I want something easy and fast.

Very good and so easy....flavors were perfect together...I too marinated the shellfish together but cooked them separately....would definately make again...my family enjoyed it too and my daughter LOVED the salsa.

I thought this was excellent and very easy to make. I didn't have scallops and just made it with the shrimp. I will definitely make this again.

while this was good, i found the mint did not blend well with the rest of the salsa ingredients and my partner thought it was *different* (partner-speak for "it could have been better") The seafood was phenomenal --the tequila added a great flavour--wished i marinaded a little longer.

LOVED this. After reading the other reviews, I decided to leave all of the ingredient amounts as is, even though I was halving the seafood amount. Also, I added ~1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro to the seafood marinade/sauce, which I think was a great addition. I didn't have tequila, so I used a little vodka and brandy. I marinaded the scallops and shrimp together, didn't seem to be a problem at all. After sauteing the seafood in the boiled marinade, and removing the seafood, I reduced the sauce a bit further, then poured it into the bowl of seafood, tossed, and served over buttery, garlicky rice pilaf. I chopped the salsa ingredients much finer than in the picture, and I think the texture was great this way. Everything was delicious!

Have made this 3 times since looking up the recipe a few weeks ago - huge hit. Had no problems with marinating the seafood, and served it on a bed of delicately flavoured garlic/butter rice - was excellent, my daughter said it was "the best thing I've ever put in my mouth", (though she has said this about several dishes). Followed the recipe exactly, and whilst I loved the salsa combined with the seafood, it seemed to have a bitter aftertaste when tasted alone - not sure if this is the jalapeno or the fresh mint - will have to experiment, but wouldn't make the salsa to go with anything else unless I can eliminate the aftertaste. Mango and Avocado is a yummy combination, but I do have to be sure to pick an avocado which is a little firmer than I would usually pick otherwise it goes a little sloppy.

Made this recipe for the first time last night exactly as suggested - salsa was delicious as was the seafood. My guests were impressed. Will definitely make this again!

This is not a Mexican recipe. Nobody in Mexico would ever do Avocado and Mango.

Good and flavorful combo, especially the salsa, BUT one caution. I noticed after about 10 minutes of marinating the shrimp (didn't use scallops)they were starting to turn pink, so quick yanked them out of the marinade--this is how one makes ceviche! As it was, I thought the shrimp were a little tough, even with quick sauté. Salsa was tasty-- needs more mint.

I agree with MCMoorman's review; the salsa was great but the seafood was good but nothing to write home about. I kept waiting for some depth of flavor, and I think MCMoorman's idea of griling the seafood would do it. The marinade boiled later to use as a sauce would be a nice compliment. The salsa is exceptional, again agreeing with MCMoorman to use a firm avocado; mine was too ripe. I did use the mint, I think that gave it a nice punch of flavor. Also served this over a long grain/wild rice mix, which I think is perfect for the dish. I'd make this again but would play with it a little more.

This was fantastic! I made the whole modern fiesta menu with the exception of the sangria and the dessert and it was a big hit. The flavors went together perfectly and I will definitely make it again. I added tilapia but didn't think it really added anything so will leave it out next time. I recommend serving with flour tortillas.

This was a HUGE hit at my dinner party. I substituted halibut for shrimp due to allergies and the halibut along side the scallops was a perfect combination. I highly recommend this dish and look forward to making it again.

This salsa was terrific, and the mint really sets it off. We put the seafood on skewers and grilled.

Truly exceptional! I halved the amount of seafood for two people, but kept the rest of the ingredients as written - the sauce was fantastic and we ended up eating these burrito-style with a little sauce over the top. Outstanding, delicious, and healthy. I'm going to use the leftover salsa today on some grilled fish.

Four fours for the Salsa. Use "firm- ripe" avocado and mango; Dice into small pieces. Added some Yellow Wax peppers, in addition to the jalapenos. Used cilantro - next time may try the mint. The seafood was good, but nothing to write home about. I did add mahi-mahi which worked well. Marinated the mahi- mahi; cooked on the grill; and then added to the saute with the scallops.

this was very yummy, the salsa especially! WE used a frozen seafood mix, I think it would be better with fresh, but it was still delicous, there were no leftovers! I am going to use the salsa a lot

I thought this was great - and so did my three young kids. They didn't eat the salsa, but gobbled up the shrimp and scallops. A nice quick weeknight dinner...

I doubled this recipie and used fresh halibut and prawns. Served it with the mango salsa and warm flour tortillas - it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, will definitely make again for the summer :)
