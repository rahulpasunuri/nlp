I have made this recipe several times in the past year and it always receives raves from guests who roll their eyes and convulse with pleasure! It's very easy to make and yields enough for several portions. Recently, I made this for my son and his friends from college -- they dubbed this the food equvilent to crack! It's that addictive! I always add a big pinch of cayenne at the end for a little kick. It's good on vanilla ice cream, but I LOVE it over coffee or maple ice cream.

I MADE THIS DESSERT FOR MY BIRTHDAY MEAL AND BOY WAS IT A HIT! IT WAS LUSH! THERE IS A LOT OF THE FUDGE SAUCE LEFT OVER THOUGH SO IT MAY BE WISE TO HAVE THE QUANTITIES AND THE COFFEE COMES THROUGH SO NEXT TIME I THINK I'LL HALF THE COFFEE TOO. BUT IT WAS SURE FANTASTIC. AN ABSOLUTE TREAT!

This recipe is the BOMB! YUM. Made it for Cinco de Mayo for about 15pp and have a container leftover. Quickly made on the bbq side burner and served immediately over ice cream, on sugar cookies, and fresh fruit. It does make alot. Forgot to serve with nuts.

I made this for a Mexican themed dinner party for 10 people. It was a huge hit! I mean, who doesn't like hot fudge sundaes? It made a lot of fudge, I could have made half as much and it still would have been more than enough.

Instead of chocolate chips and cinammon, you can just use Mexican chocolate tablets (La Abuelita or Ibarra). I added 2 small pinches of cayenne and it was a definite plus. (BTW: You can also use Mexican chocolate to make very good hot chocolate.)

Great, quick dessert. I added a bit of cayenne for some heat. Makes a LOT of fudge! I will cut the recipe in half next time.

Very nice when other courses have a lot of flavors going on. Simple but delicious and most people like hot fudge sundaes. I topped with fresh mint.

This recipe is a real crowd pleaser. I've made it three times, and each time is easy and quick. This time I made it with half and half instead of heavy whip cream because we couldn't find it (in the middle of nowhere on a retreat). Still wonderful, and everyone loves it. What an excellent dessert. Yum!

I made this last night for two chocoholics and they LOVED it! It was extremely easy and it made a LOT of chocolate sauce so I have more left over for tonight's dessert. I used a hefty amount of coffee per our personal taste, and I used crushed toasted walnuts instead of pinenuts since I dislike pinenuts. Since they were just a garnish, I feel that the recipe rating is authentic to the written recipe. I tried to serve it according to what the picture looked like, with sprigs of mint as garnish, and it was very pretty. I used Ben and Jerry's Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Definately will be making again for a splurge!

I was a bit disappointed to not see chili powder on the list of ingrdients. A teaspoon or so gives it a wonderful zing, but liberally add more as you like.

I just tried it the other day. It was easy to make and absolutely delicious. Will definitely make it again. Angelica

I'm from Western New York State. Restaurants here have a dessert called a Mexican Sundae. THIS IS THAT DESSERT WITH A DELICIOUS TWIST!

As a Girl Guide Leader, I know that our girls are going to love this wonderful ice cream treat. They study about other countries and I am sure they won't mind sampling this treat from Mexico.
