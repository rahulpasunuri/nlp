Yum! What a great mashed potato recipe! I made this as a side dish for "Peppered Pork Tenderloin with Cherry Salsa," also found on this website. Great flavors! The cheddar and chipotle are both subtle at the suggested quantities, but definitely there and play nicely together. I made one slight change...had only skim milk, so I added a heaping tablespoon of sour cream to aid the texture.

I made this dish as the bottom layer of a scrumptious Canapé for dinner last night. Topped with sautéed buttered garlic spinach and Flounder (cooked with white wine, lemon and even more butter). Huge hit, the boyfriend practically licked the plate in front of me! Joseph Daleuski New York City

This potato recipe is great - even for my husband, someone who doesn't want ANYTHING in his mashed potatoes, they were great. I used these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit. One note: I made the potatoes ahead and then reheated them in the oven right before dinner. When they came out with the turkey, the cheddar had melted and they liquified! I panicked, but once they cooled slightly, they set up again. My guests still raved.
