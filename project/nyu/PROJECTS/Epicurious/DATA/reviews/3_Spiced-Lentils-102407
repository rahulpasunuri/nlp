I liked it!! I served it on some plain yogurt. Cilantro is an absolute must, if you don't have it, don't even bother with this.

This recipe is incredibly bland. Per the other reviews, in addition to the ginger, onions and chili powder, I also added some hot peppers from my garden and some hot curry powder and a touch of cumin.

made it with 1/2 homemade veggie broth and half water, doubled the curry powder, doubled chili powder, and added a diced, seeded jalepeno and 3 sliced cloves of garlic to the onion mixture. Very good!!

Very boring! Despite all the spices, as written, this recipe is worthless. Requires an awful lot of modifications to be tasty. Why not just use another recipe?

Good base recipe to play around with. I took other users' suggestions and added carrot, tomato, cumin, tumeric, curry powder (while cooking), and garlic. I also added about 1/2 Tablespoon of butter into the lentils toward the end.

This smelled soooo good while it was cooking, but let me down when I tasted it - I found it sort of bland, and not at all what I expected from an indian dish. I plan to make it again, but experiment with increasing the amounts of spices.

Yes, I figited with it, but to wonderful results! I used Better than Boullion's vegetable base with a cinnamon stick and enough curry powder to make me happy. Oh, a half teaspoon of chile powder, too. With it, I made naan, out of The Joy of Cooking, since I was out of rice. Delish!

Well, I agree with the others who rated this recipe...needs doctoring. The base was a bit tasteless. Here's what I added...it made it full and flavorful. Cook lentils with veg or chicken broth. Sauted 3 cloves of garlic and one onion to add to the lentils. Instead of straight cinnamon, I used cin sticks and let the lentils simmer with them for about an hour. For extra flavor a Tbsp of raw honey and about 3 Tbsp of curry. Served with Naan (Indian bread) very tasty!

This was a good base for a dish, but needed doctoring up. I sautéed the onions directly in the pot so that the lentils would do all their cooking with them. I used a vegetable stock which really helped. I used a lot of cumin and put in turmeric, too. Sorry, I didn't measure. I cooked it with the curry powder in it, too. It still needed flavour, so I heated oil and cumin in a frying pan (to intensify the cumin flavour) and sautéed a bunch of chopped carrot. I added that, and, right at the end some chopped tomato. This is an excellent fool-around-and-experiment recipe, but not great for just making it as is.

Quite good, but needs some more deeper flavor, such as a bouillion base. I would also add more curry.

Very good recipe, I've done it with vegetable stock instead of water and it added some nice flavor

I think many people need help to get past the _grey_ flavor of some lentils. The trick is use is to ALWAYS add at least 1/4 c of tomato sauce toward end of cooking brown lentils. Salsa, or stewed tomatoes work great too. I use less onion, and increase garlic. Varying the Indian Spices, curry mix and type of stock can also make a big difference in flavor, especially with yellow split pea legumes.

A nice, easy, tasty recipe for lentils. I enjoyed it very much. It was a bit too spicy for my toddler though (I used cayenne pepper, not chile powder).Didn't hold up to freezing too well though so next time I will halve the recipe.

This was delicious and hit the spot on a chilly evening. Especially good over basmati rice. My only non-glowing comment is that it looks pretty drab and gloppy, so the added parsley and curry powder were musts -- for color, if nothing else.

Great autumnal fare.....ad some diced yam for extra chunk!

I used a finger of fresh ginger (about 2 1/2" by 3/4"). I also used fresh basil instead of cilantro as that is what we had. We served this dish with Basmati rice and my wife thought it was great. I plan to use the leftovers in a soup.

No taste at all! It needs a whole lot of something. I will never make this again! Be smart and look for something else to make.
