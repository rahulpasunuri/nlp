This was quite delicious - a nice combination of flavors with the herbs and the apple flavor. The sherry vinegar is a critical addition.

This was an explosion of flavor! I didn't bother to peel the delicata squash, because the peel softens enough and is edible. I actually liked it this way because it gave the dish a little structure. So if you're lazy like me, forget peeling and just dice it up. Nom nom!

Scrumptious! I made a half batch, having one Delicata squash and had to divide the cooking time. Using only one quarter cup water and three quarter cups cider, a splash of white wine vinegar and a splash of sherry (having no sherry vinegar), I simmered the squash for 20-25 minutes, turned it off, with plenty of liquid left, and covered it with a lid. Coming back to it an hour or so later, when the main course was ready, I began simmering again, and got wonderful caramelization, boiling the liquid all the way down. It was browned, glazed, deliciously herbaceous (fresh herbs!) and even my husband took seconds.

I thought this was really good. I started with some onions & olive oil because I thought carmelized onions would be good in this. I used apple juice from concentrate because that's what I had, but used more concentrate to make the juice more appley. After that I followed the recipe and it came out great.

Rating: 1
I dunno. I thought these were overwhelmingly appley. I couldn't taste the squash at all. The herbs were a nice touch, but the cider is just too much. I would make this again but tweak it quite a bit so that the squash shines.

Loved this! This was my first time eating delicata squash and it was delicious. It was easy too, which is always a bonus. I used dried rosemary, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I am going to make this again tonight using sweet dumpling squash.

I can't give this a rating because I didn't really follow the recipe, but the result was so delicious I had to write a little something. I sauteed a little bacon and used the grease to cook butternut squash and some leftover onions. I left out the spices, but simmered the squash mix with water, cider, salt, and balsamic vinegar. I think I added a tiny bit of cloves as well. Served it with "Wild Rice with French Green Lentils" recipe found on epicurious. Amazingly good meal.

Delicious! We didn't have apple cider in the house and so used apple sauce plus extra water and it was great! Maybe not as delicate as it would be with the cider, but very hardy. Also used dried spices instead of fresh ones and it still turned out delicious. I would also gander that you could use just 2 Tbs of butter and still end up with a delicious end result.

This is the best squash recipe I've found. I used 3, rather than 2 delicata (my first time trying this particular squash). With the squash peeled and cut ahead of time, it was quick & easy to prepare as the roast was "resting." The next day we sauteed the leftovers with seafood ravioli for a delicious meal. So good I've just picked up more delicata to make this again!

very nice. thanks for posting. it was my frist time cooking/eating delicata squash, and i'm glad i found this recipe. i didn't have apple cider, but i had a juice. also, in my local store i only found dried herbs. it still worked well. oh, and i didn't peel skin, because i read before that the skin is eatable. it did bother a little my boy-friend, because the skin stayed slightly harder than the flash, but I didn't really bother me...i think i will try delicata squash with lots of garlic and basil next time =)

I LOVE this recipe. My husband doesn't like the usual combo of sweet (butter and brown sugar) with winter squash. In fact, he claimed he didn't like winter squash until I tried this recipe. After a few times of trying this recipe, I've figured out that the deciding factor on how good it is: the quality of the apple cider. I've used fresh herbs, dried herbs, different vinegars, chicken broth instead of water, and it always comes out good if the cider is a fresh, tangy, strong cider. NOT juice. By the way...the recipe is fantastic with dried rosemary and sage. And a lot faster.

Taste is fine, but not impressive. Would look to other recipes to make in the future with delicata.

I had never seen these squash before, let alone knew how to cook them--Epicurious to the rescue! I followed this recipe with some changes of course (didn't have all the ingredients), and it was delicious and fast. I will use this recipe for other winter squash in the future. My changes: cut the pieces smaller (1/4 inch slices), and used some fresh home-made pesto I had for herbs, and balsamic vinegar, and I didn't use water, just cider. The result was outstanding, it cooked quickly and glazed beautifully. Thank you!

I thought this was a really nice side. The flavors are interesting. We didn't have enough sage in the garden, so we just added more rosemary and that gave the dish a really unique and almost minty flavor. We served it for Thanksgiving and I feel it was an excellent and, undoubtedly, healthier alternative to my boyfriend's beloved candied yams.

I made this tonight exactly as written. Both my husband & I thought it was pretty awful. I threw the whole batch out. It's a shame. I like all the ingrediants individually, but they just did not come together well at all. What a waste of time & good ingrediants.

Rating: 4
An amazing recipe. I found out something the hard way though. I didn't allow enough prep time and the rest of the dinner would be ready ahead of the squash. So I poured it into a microwaveable bowl, microwaved for 5 minutes, and then returned to the skillet to glaze. It was outstanding.

Rating: 4
A recipe with great potential, but I was surprised at how muted the flavor of the herbs became after cooking with the squash. Next time I may add some fresh just prior to removing from the heat. I did toss in some fresh thyme right before serving; that perked it up a bit! Another option might be to add the herb/ butter mixture about five minutes before the squash is done.

This was delicious! We served it with a roasted pork loin, and it was the perfect fall meal. We used about 1 teaspoon of rubbed (dried & crushed) sage, some pretty blah supermarket-brand bottled cider, and cider vinegar instead of sherry, but it still came out great. I'm excited to try it again with all the "right" ingredients next time.

This squash is fabulous! We used this recipe for our first try of delicata squash, and we were not disappointed. The syrupy apple cider along with the fresh herbs is a perfect glaze for this quintessentially autumn dish. I look forward to making this, or a variation, often.

Rating: 3
This was surprisingly good! We halved the recipe, and used the last of some homepressed cider we had on hand. Used cider vinegar as we didn't have sherry. We also did 1/4" slices, which cooked in the time allowed and retained some texture. Very good, and will repeat.

Mine looked like the picture, and it did what it was supposed to do, but...ick. Singularly unimpressive. Definitely a more-work-to-taste ratio, not worth it.

I liked the cider glaze on the squash (wasn't a fan of delicata, perhaps acorn would be good this recipe). I used dried herbs, sprinkled them over the squash while it was cooking and then added the butter at the end. I did need to use almost twice as much cider as the recipe called for in order to cook the squash - kept having to add more and more because it simmered out. And the cooking time for was about 40 minutes, even with very small chunks of squash.

Fabulous! I didn't have any apple juice so substituted some white grape juice, and used cider vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. Really, really tasty all by itself. Took just 20 minutes to cook for Delicata, and everything glazed perfectly. A nice balance of sweet, savory and herb-y, in my opinion. Though probably not good for someone who doesn't like the assertive flavors of sage and rosemary.

I made this as a side to porkchops, the rosemary makes it wonderfully bright and deliciious.

I would give this dish 3-1/2 forks if I could. I prepared it exactly as directed, and was amazed at how delicious it was. I agree with the cook who said good squash recipes are few and far between. This one's the best I've seen.

I was very dissapointed in this recipe. It managed to bland and overpowering at the same time. Not the easiest to prepare either.

I think the braising period was too long as I prefer more crisp tender vegetables. I removed the squash as the cider was in its' reduction time after about 15 minutes. I added some tangerine peel and juice. As the reduction got thick and syrupy, I added the squash back in. I thickened it with a touch of cornstarch and water. At serving I sprinkled cinnamon on top. I used Knudsens Spiced Apple cider. After these modifications, it was very good. Very good indeed. The tangerine was the perfect kick.

Perhaps I just don't like delicata, but this recipe just didn't work for my family. Strange combination of flavors and took much longer to cook than indicated by recipe.

Rating: 1
After looking forward to making this dish for days based on all of the wonderful reviews, I was very disappointed in the outcome. Took more than an hour to cook down; the squash wasn't very flavorful; and the glaze tasted off.

Rating: 4
This was just amazing, sweet and sour at the same time with an herby undertone. One thing to consider is to continue to let the squash saute in the pan once the sauce is reduced so that it will caramelize. It adds another depth of flavor.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely wonderful, and a fantastic use for my garden herbs. I have to admit that peeling and cutting the bumpy delicata was not my favorite part of the dish, but the outcome was well-worth-it. Don't plan on making this dish ahead of time and re-heating for holiday dinner though, the squash is too dry the next day.

Simple and really good! I used freshly pressed apple cider, and added a bunch of steamed collard greens to give some color and it was awesome! It impressed even the squash-wary neighbors. Certainly worth making again (and again and again...).

Thought this was fair. Took a lot longer to cook. Used a lot more spice for it to finally taste ok.

This is my favorite squash recipe, hands down. Perfect for a holiday meal--it makes the entire house smell, well, festive! I use slightly less apple juice, as I've found that, with the amount called for, the cook-down time is quite long and the squash gets a bit mushy. Otherwise, no changes.

I thought this was a great way to prepare Delicata squash. I was a little concerned about the amount of sage called for; I thought it would be overpowering, so I cut down on the amount I used. However, I found that the sweetness that resulted from the cider glaze really could have been balanced better by more sage... I should have used the full amount! All in all, a pretty good dish.

Have tried a bunch of squash recipes on the way to finding the one we'll stick with for Thanksgivings to come. This is the one. Not a bit leftover and the house smelled like a dream while it cooked.

One of the best squash recipes I have ever made. I used white wine vinegar which worked well. I brought the leftovers to work and microwaved them...this brought many passerbys to my office querying about what the delicious smell was. I already purchased more squash to make this again!

I would rate this higher because butter, sage & delicata? OH DEVINE! But the cider overpowers the dish! Why over power such wonderfully delicious natural flavors with overpowering sweet & sour apple cider? I think i'd use less of that stuff or none next time cause delicata is too wonderful of a squash to do such a thing to! & like I said butter & sage are god sent!

Rating: 4
This has become a staple for us. After reading the other comments, however, I have made a couple of changes. I do not add any water, and I cook the squash in the cider with a cover on for a bit until the squash has begun to soften. Then with the cover off, I cook and stir until the cider has glazed the squash and has mostly evaporated.

Rating: 4
I never want to eat squash any other way again. I thought this was so much easier than having it bake for an hour and the glaze made it delicious. However, I cut the recipe in half as I had only one delicata and found I had to add more liquid in order to make it soft enough.

Rating: 4
My husband and I loved this recipe! Because there were comments about cooking time, I measured everything just as the recipe called for and it only took 20 minutes to cook down. It was fragrant and full of flavor. There was just enough for me to have the rest for lunch the next day! I know it is supposed to serve 6, but we only had enough for 3. I'm fixing it again this Saturday for friends and I can hardly wait!

I was fairly disappointed with this recipe. I had to cook the squash for twice as long as indicated because there was so much liquid and the squash never attained a glaze as expected. The sage was a nice flavor with the squash however.
