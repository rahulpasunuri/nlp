These are awesome - much more flavor than you would expect from such simple ingredients.

I've made this numerous times since seeing the recipe a few years ago. It can be varied by adding or substituting herbs for the pepper. This definitely isn't going to appear on a list of healthy foods, but it is simple and very tasty.
