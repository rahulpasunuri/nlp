Really tasty- I made the broth pretty much as recommended, excepting the allspice (which I didn't have, but would like to try) and adding two tbs tomato paste and two tbs flour, as per Gordon Ramsey's "Fast Food" chicken stock recipe. I really like the tomato paste addition, although I suppose it makes the broth cloudier (which doesn't matter to me, I'm in it for the flavor). But I love all the extra root vegi additions to the soup in lieu of noodles. Very tasty and autumnal!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now with delicious results. I have stayed true to the recipe both times, although I think some barley would be a nice addition. The soup has a delightful balance and delicacy of flavor, while still being quite robust and satisfying. It's more time consuming than some of the others soups in my rotation, but well worth the effort.

Love this soup and I use this recipe now to create my soup stock for most soups. Highly recommend.

The recipe as it stands is extremely bland. It is highly sweet and lacking depth. I will add some homemade canned tomatoes and a few tablespoons of tomato paste to the leftovers and spice it up with some white pepper and a dash of hot sauce. If you prefer a lot of flavor, this recipe will be disappointing. You will need to add another teaspoon of salt and more garlic at minimum to make it more palatable. Having said all that, I do love the clean eating it provides!

This is a fantastic soup. We have made it 4 times so far, every time I get a cold, it always makes me feel better.

I followed the recipe with little derivation. This comes out quite good. Make sure to remove any skin on carcass parts prior to adding to the broth. Also, it takes a good hour (plus) to reduce the broth down to 7 cups after straining.

If I had more closely followed the recipe I think it would have turned out better. I added a large bunch of ribbed red kale, which was delicious, but also added a sweet potato, yam, extra celery root, brown rice and quinoa. The soup is thick, hearty and healthy, but the sweet potato created a sweetness-imbalance that is hard to correct. My friends ended up eating seconds and thirds, but I'm dissatisfied. I added apple cider vinegar, red chilli flakes and a dash of lemon juice for balance, which helped, and served it with pan grilled bread. I think a dollop of sour cream with chives would be a nice touch as garnish.

Great. I completely changed this but it was yummy. I used onion, garlic, carrots, celery, turnips, sweet potato, and finely shredded collard greens for my vegies and added a heaping teaspoon of new mexican hot green chili powder for a kick! Yum!

Forgot to mention one more tweak I made: I cooked the broth overnight in the slow cooker on high, for about 14 hours total, before reducing it to 7 cups on the stovetop.

I think this is the tastiest soup I ever made! Loves:  Incredible flavor. The homemade stock made a big difference. The roast chicken pushed it to a whole different level.  Seasonality. Feels great to cook what's readily available at the Farmers' Mart. And it works well with both Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine philosophy too, as root veggies are great for the winter.  Not wasteful. I love that I'm using the carcass of a roast chicken, instead of fresh chicken (meat, bones & all), which is what I usually do when making chicken broth. But the meat is usually so tasteless afterwards that it goes straight to the compost bin. With this approach, the chicken meat doesn't get wasted! Dislikes:  Time and effort required. This is the only dislike for me. Honestly, it took more than the 1.5 hours of active time for me! But it is one of the few effortful dishes that I feel is worth the pain. Tweaks:  Added a handful of American ginseng, a few slices of fresh ginger, and 2 dried figs during the broth-making stage. Being Southern Chinese, I like making Chinese soup (more like broth by Western standards) with Chinese herbs. But DH doesn't always like the flavors, especially American ginseng. It's great to find a soup recipe where I can tastily masquerade the herb's potent flavor!  Added some wheat pasta shells, to make it more of a hearty meal.

I have not even completed this recipe and I already love the broth! I didn't have a few of the ingredients nor did I have the carcass of a roasted chicken, (which I am sure will make this soup that much better)so I improvised with chicken parts and put everything in my crockpot for 4-5 hours. Later, I will add the additional vegies, cut up chicken and either some small pasta or matzah balls for the completion of the soup. I think it's the combination of root vegies, allspice, thyme and garlic that make the incredible flavors of this broth. This is my new chicken broth recipe.

This soup is delicious! The broth has a sweet taste and the combination of root vegetables and the roast chicken is perfect. I'll be making this throughout the winter.

What a delicious soup! I followed the recipe exactly as printed except that I couldn't find any celery root, so I left it out. It is now my all-time favorite homemade chicken soup. It is very hearty; filled with vegetables and chicken, it makes a main course. I highly recommend it!

Fantastic soup! I don't normally make any changes to a recipe without trying the original first, but in this case I had most ingredients at home already, so I just went ahead with what I had. I used 6 turkey wings that I had in the freezer and simmered with the vegetables, used red potatoes instead of yams, didn't have celery root so used chopped celery and I did not have whole allspice so that was omitted. Also while I was in the garden getting the parsley and thyme I grabbed a few stalks of sage. I also added kosher salt to the water when making the broth. I thought I made a good turkey soup before, but this was by far superior to mine. The broth was so flavorful and the absence of any pasta was not missed. I will be discarding my old Turkey soup recipe. Yum!
