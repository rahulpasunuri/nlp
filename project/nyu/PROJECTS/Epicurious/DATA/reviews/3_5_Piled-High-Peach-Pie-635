Although very delish, crust gets soggy on bottom if not precooked and ruins the texture. Cut peaches chunky or they will overcook. If peaches are all all juicy, add more flour or pie will be too watery.

Made this pie tonight and it's delicious!!! The flavors of the spices complement the peaches so well. Very very good. I didn't change anything on the recipe. Used a different crust recipe.

yummy. I changed the spices just a bit - used 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp cardamom, and just barely a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg each (I don't really like those flavors) and LOVED the filling. The flour really worked well - just enough thickening. I used a different recipe for the crust, so can't comment on that.

This is the absolute BEST piecrust ever. It is so easy to work with and so flaky when baked. I've tried many, but this is my favorite.

really an excellent peach pie! family and friends rave about it. Do NOT skip the cardamom. I do cheat and use Pillsbury refrig pie crust, can only imagine how good it will be with crust from scratch.

A great peach pie! Followed the recipe exactly, and was really happy that the spices didn't distract from my fresh peaches. When you let the peaches sit in the bowl with sugar etc., quite a lot of liquid is released. I used my hands to scoop out the solid peach pieces and left the liquid behind. I might have lost some spices and thickeners in the process, but my pie filling was plenty moist in the end. Finally, next time I make this, I'm doubling the amount of filling. I love fruit and there was plenty of room for more in the end so why not, eh?

I make this every year when peaches are in season and people have been asking about it so I guess it's time - peaches are in at the farmers market. I cheat and use pre-made pie dough but this filling is so excellent it doesn't matter, I think the cardamom gives it a unique flavor. The best peach pie!

Really Yummy! I made my own crust (I always use Melissa D'Arabian's pie crust from the Food Network-- it's the best!), but used this recipe for the filling. Sadly, my peaches weren't quite ripe (some were more like apples!), so I was worried that it wouldn't be flavorful. I doubled the spices (substituting ginger for cardamom, 'cause I didn't have any), and let the fruit sit for a bit to make it juicer. Added just a touch of cornstarch, and made a lattice work crust. It turned out beautifully, and was very flavorful! I was impressed that the recipe could salvage under-ripe peaches, but it was great!

Excellent peach pie! Made to rave reviews from my guests. Did not use this crust recipe, so the filling is what I am reviewing. The spices are just enough to add interest but still let the peach flavor be the main focus. The only change I made was to add 4 teaspoons of cornstarch to the mixture- with this change, the pie held together very well and was not runny, but was also not full of gelatin-like filling like some peach pies. I'm making another today!

blech. very bland. needed more sugar, more spice, more -something- ! i thought the peaches i used were sweet enough, but apparently not. i would either recommend adding more sugar or make sure your fruit is top notch. otherwise you'll end up with a pie not worth much.

I followed the recipe exactly except added 1 tsp. of tapioca. The pie looked good but didn't taste good at all....neither the filling nor the crust. I would not make it again.

absolutely delicious. i followed the advice to drain the peaches and place the pie on a cookie sheet and was glad i did... it definitely was piled high enough to boil over. i, too, brushed the top with egg 10 minutes before it was done for a lovely golden top.

Very delicious with a nice flaky crust. I didn't have Cardomom but didn't miss it. Also brushed the top with cream and sprinkled sugar. Will definitely make this again!

The pie and crust were delicious, and I would definitely make again, but with some precautions. In all my years of baking pies, I've had pies bubble over, but I've never had the fruit itself manage to come out of the crust. Not only were there peaches on the cookie sheet, but I had a nice little pile of peaches on the bottom of the oven. I'm sure it was because the peaches were too juicy. Next time I make this I will watch for extra juicy peaches and drain some of the juice off. As it was the filling was also runny. Not picture perfect, but it was very tasty.

My husband also said it's the best pie he's ever had! I used 8 large ripe yellow peaches. As always working with the crust is the hardest part, but the less you fool with it the flakier it is. I've made this twice so far! It's my favorite dessert now!

I did not think this pie had enough sugar and neither did my family. I used half white and half yellow Georgia peaches that were fully ripe. The filling otherwise worked well and set up nicely. Sorry, but I think my every day crust is better than this. I will go back to my tried and true peach pie in the future.

This has become my favorite peach pie recipe. My family loved it. Used the last of Colorado peaches from the farmers market. I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 tsp of cornstarch with the flour because the filling was so runny. Also took the advice of other reviewers and put a cookie sheet under the pie. The pie filling did spill out. The pie crust was yummy. Made it the day before and it turned out great. Will make again!

My husband said "That's the best pie I've ever had!" I used all butter in the crust and substituted ginger for the cardamom. Also decreased the sugar in the pie- we don't like desserts that are too sweet. I'm making it again this weekend with fresh orchard peaches.

I used this recipe as a model, but made some revisions. I had sweet, juicy peaches from the farmer's market, so I a little less than 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also added about 1-1/2 teaspoon of fresh grated ginger and around a tablespoon of lemon juice. The results were delicious.

This is the BEST pie I have ever made and the only one that wasn't runny. The only thing I would change is my peached were a bit more tart than I like, but my husband loved the pie. Will definately make it again.

Yes! This is a keeper! The dough is fun and easy to work with, and is delicious. It's not a regular flaky pastry dough; rather, it's softer and tender, like a little soft blanket for the peaches. The cardamom and the nutmeg are wonderful in this pie, even though they're a big different. I brushed my piecrust with cream then sprinkled it with plenty of cinnamon sugar before popping it into the oven. It is one beautiful, amazing pie! I used perfectly ripe white peaches for the filling. Superb! My husband fell in love with me all over again when he ate the first piece of this pie! Thanks, Epicurious!

My father had requested a peach pie for his birthday so I chose this one. The crust was delicious! However, I was disappointed with the filling. My peaches weren't perfect and maybe that was the problem. I would only make this again with peaches at the height of their season and with the addition of more spices. I did use a colander when slicing the peaches to avoid excess juices. It worked out well. Do use a cookie sheet under the pie tin just in case.

This is, hands down, the best peach pie I have ever eaten. I received the most complimentary comments from guests. It not only tasted great, it looked beautiful. Before cutting the pie, one guest commented that it should be on the cover of a magazine and even the sliced pieces were attractive. I made it exactly as written (except I didn't peel the peaches) and it was absolutely wonderful! I did cover the entire pie with aluminum foil the last 20 minutes of baking. It dripped a little so I was glad I had put a cookie sheet underneath it. Yum.

I made the mistake of using frozen peaches which gave the final filling to be more like baby food. Fresh would be best, of course. Modifications I made included using brown sugar in the peaches rather than white, adding 1/2 tsp more cinnamon and slightly more flour to compensate for the soupy frozen peaches. The Crust was outstanding and rates 4 forks. I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the crust mixture. Also, in the last 10 minutes of baking I brushed the top w/ egg white and sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar. I WILL do this again, but with fresh peaches.

I do a ton of baking, always from scratch for all the family special occasions, and was told this was the best dessert I have ever made. I'm sure part had to do with the fact that I had perfect peaches. I used the "Flaky Pie Crust" (Bon Appetite June 2000), and made a gorgeous lattice top. I added a bit extra cardamom and also some ginger to the peaches, and left in ALL the juices even though I'd let them sit for almost an hour before putting in the crust. A little boiled onto the cookie sheet I baked it on, but not much and it wasn't runny, even without added thickener. (Again, the perfect peaches I guess). Baked it the full 70 minutes and covered with foil after about 50. I followed the recipe basically exactly and it was just fabulous!

I'm making this pie two days in row during peach season. The first day I made it without the top crust and basted it with its own juices to keep it from getting dried out. It was fabulous!

was pretty good...tip for hi humidity areas-- use food processor for crust to make as quickly as possible-- carful not to overprocess tho, and try to make early in am

This pie was super! It tased delicous and was a hit. I used an entire box of Harry and David peaches, however, I cheated and used a premade crust. If you have not purchased cardemon, you are in for sticker shock. McCormick gets over $12.00 for a standard size spice botle.

This really was fabulous! I used 6 tablespoons of quick tapioca and didn't have any of the problems with spillage that some have complained about. I too increased the sugar to 1C. and flour to 1/3C. I loved the bountiful presence of peaches and look forward to next season when I can make this again. The crust was very nice as well, but I definitely had to watch it and needed foil towards the end to prevent burning.

This is the best pie I have ever made. Since peaches were not in season, I had to use canned and it still came out fabulous. I adjusted for the canned by adding a little less sugar but I should have used the full 3/4 cup. It went so fast I should have made two!

Rating: 3
While I thought this was very good, I'm not sure I would make it again. Needs too many changes. I increased sugar to 1 cup and flour to 1/3(as sugar liquifies, it is also necessary to increase flour). I let filling sit 15 minutes to draw out juices, drained and reduced liquids to a thick syrup and added back in.It was still too liquidy. A better alternative would be to use tapioca as a thickener. Also, I would prefer this in a 10-inch pan, where juices would have a chance to reduce with less chance of spillage. It's necessary to have such a large ratio of peaches when the crust is so good.

My partner and I took the pie to a casual lunch with friends. Everyone loved it. Although, I was a little critical about my crust. I used a blue glass pie tin and discovered that the bottom crust was not baked enough. The top crust was flaky and buttery. Next time I be more careful.

This peach pie received rave reviews! I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter with no lard, which made the dough easy to work with, and the crust was perfect. I also added some Amaretto, and drained the peach mixture very well before placing the contents into the pie shell. Another tip: place a cookie-sheet under the pie plate while baking, to catch any liquid that might spill over into the oven.

The crust is wonderful with a beautiful texture and taste maybe lending itself to a light sprinkling of cinnamon sugar mixture to the top for baking. I used Georgia sweet peaches but found that the filling could use a tad more cinnamon and nutmeg and bump up the sugar content another half cup. Beautiful presentation with the high mount of peaches in the center. Definitely do again!!

This is the best crust I have ever made! Incredibly flaky, easy to handle and browned beautifully. The pie kept up really well in the fridge for a few days and reheated nicely in the microwave.
