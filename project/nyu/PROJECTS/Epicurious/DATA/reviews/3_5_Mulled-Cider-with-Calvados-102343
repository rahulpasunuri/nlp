Used this for my Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big success!

I followed this recipe to a 'T' but we used Apple Jack in place of Calvados as many others who reviewed this recipe did. My husband and I had the same poor reaction to this concoction: it was so spicy that it was very BITTER despite the two tablespoons of brown sugar and sweet cider that I used.My husband described it as tasting like "toilet water". If I ever try to make this again, although I doubt it, I will cut down on the amount of spices, especially all that cinnamon. I think that nearly 2 sticks of it is overkill for only 3 cups of cider. I'm a person who loves spicy things but this was way overboard for me.

Used Applejack rather than the very expensive Calvados and decreased sugar. Was great hot and just as good chilled the next day!

I used spiced rum instead of the calvados and loved the outcome! It was the perfect fall warm-up and will definitely become a staple for fall entertaining. I didn't find it too sweet either, but I used all natural unsweetened cider.

I didn't find this recipe too sweet at all, which I think had to do with the alcohol and type of apple juice I used. I substituted 1/2 cup Cap'n Morgan's Spiced Rum for the calvados and it was pleasantly smooth, almost buttery. The spiced rum and spices in the cider really complemented each other. It also got me pleasantly buzzed without knocking me over, even after 2 cups. ;) If over-sweetness if a concern, also try using an apple juice with very little added sugar. I used Trader Joe's pure apple juice from a glass gallon jug, and it was delicious.

I used half of the sugar and all of the brandy. Stupendous!

This was so simple and delicious on a rainy winter night! I didn't add any of the sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also left the Calvados out and served it on the side so that the whole family could indulge. This is now my standard cider recipe; I'll be making it again and again...

I substituted Gran Marnier for the Calvados which worked out better than I had thought. Great recipe! and something I'll be making for the cold Chicago nights.

Made it without the alcohol and apples for garnish. This is probably why it was a bit too sweet for me... next time I would reduce the sugar a bit. This has more cinnamon than other mulled ciders I have tried---I believe that the recipe's suggestion to break up the sticks helps. This has become my standard! Can't wait to try it with the brandy!

Have made this 3 times. It is easy to prepare and tastes better than any of the premade stuff you can buy. Love the calvados in it.

I would make it again! Delicious. However, a little sweet. Cut back on the Brown Sugar to 2 Tbsps next time.

Wonderful! Leave the booze on the side so guests could dabble if (and how much) they want & kids can also enjoy. I agree with previous reviewer, you can vary the alcohol. I make this every Halloween, it makes the house smell great!

Excellent! Be careful though, it'll land you flat on your a--. I would also use hard applejack rather than Calvados. I love calvados, however the spices, sugar and cider cover the fine taste and Calvados is too expensive to drink and not be able to enjoy the flavor of Calvados. I think for something like this a cheaper apple brandy would be fine.
