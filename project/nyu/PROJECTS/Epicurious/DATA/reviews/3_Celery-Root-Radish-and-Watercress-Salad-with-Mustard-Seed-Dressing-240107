I agree - made the entire Italian Feast menu and this salad was a good foil for the other dishes, and a nice change from tossed greens with vinaigrette in that role. I also replaced the watercress w/ arugula/spinach mix, because that was all the grocery had :) Guests were exclaiming over the dressing.

After reading the other reviews I tried this recipe with caution. It was great. considering the heavy menu it goes with the lightness of the salad is perfect. I did replace the watercress with arugula (I don't like watercress) but besides that and adding a little salt and pepper to the dressing it is excellent. Even my husband who never eats a salad without blue cheese liked it.
