Best. Cake. Ever..... This was devoured at our house! Thanks to all the suggestions in the reviews - I increased the zest and added lime and lemon juice.

Very disappointing. Crumb not as dense as expected, no citrus flavour despite substituting half of the soda with lime juice. As another reviewer noted, the overwhelming taste is of butter. Icing very blah. Also this makes a HUGE cake... what a pity, since I will end up throwing away most of it.

Such a quick recipe and sooooo moist! Added at least 2 Tbsp. of lemon and lime to the mixture. Also only used half the amount of soda that the recipe calls for and used a combination of fresh lemon and lime juice to balance out the 3/4 c. Instead of vegetable spray, I used Crisco light to prepare the Bundt pan. There was no issue with sticking at all. Lastly, the icing seemed rather blah so I used lemon juice instead of the lemon-lime soda. My husband is a lemon/lime afficionado and absolutely loved this cake.

Fantastic. Plenty to share and everyone loved it. You might want to use a hand, rather than electric, grater.

Great pound cake. The unusual addition of 7-UP makes it very moist. It's my family's favorite pound cake.

My mom has been making this cake for YEARS and it has always been requested at parties. However - she uses Margerine ( the horror!) I made it with butter and the crumb was tender and moist. I did as some vanilla paste, and it gave is a nice rounded "plain" flavor. Not really that lemony - as the other reviews state. I think I will cut back on the sugar it was a bit sweet but it is perfect in the AM with a nice cup of coffee. I did not have a problem with sticking, I did as the other reviews suggested and did a thick coating of cooking spray. I used the one by Pillsbury - in the blue can.

The cake was very good, but it did stick badly even though I used a huge amount of oil spray. I did want more citrus flavor so, as others suggested, I increased the zest in the cake to 1 tablespoon of each for the lemon and lime. I also cut back on the soda and used the juice from one lemon and one lime to make up the difference in volume. I added more zest, lemon and lime juices to the glaze. Excellent flavor, but I think next time I'll cut a piece of parchment to fit the bottom of the tube pan to prevent the sticking. I had intended to take this to a bake sale and couldn't use it because of the big chunk that stuck to the pan. Lesson learned: never use a new recipe for an event of any type until it has been tried once for home use.

This cake is delicious, but I usually end up eating in pieces from the pan because it sticks and doesn't release right.

I increased the citrus peels from 1.5 tsp each to 1.5 Tbsp each, plus I added 1/4 tsp lemon oil (natural lemon extract would work too) and the citrus flavor was great.

Incredible! I followed the recipe for the cake exactly. It is moist, and delicious. I didn't use the glaze, rather served it with raspberry compote and whipped cream. I even enjoyed it on its own days later, and that's unusual for me. I didn't have any trouble with it sticking, I treated the pan like I would for any other cake. I usually let it cool for 5-10 mins before releasing from the pan, maybe that's the difference. This is a keeper!

You couldn't taste the flavor of the cake due to the over whelming butter.

Definitely, needs more natural citrus flavor.

Excellent cake. I doubled the lemon and lime zest and added an extra teaspoon of lemon juice. This is a great Summertime dessert. I made a glaze consisting of powdered sugar, vanilla extract and fresh lemon juice.

I was very impressed with this cake. I'm giving serious consideration to making this my birthday cake (replacing a seriously good chocolate fudge cake). I upped the zest in the cake to 1 tbsp of each, and replaced half the 7-Up with freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice. The citrus flavour was just right in the cake - not overly subtle but not too pronounced. I also made the icing with lemon/lime juice rather than the soda.

Yummy. Watch the baking time - mine only needed about 55 minutes (my oven cooks a little fast, though). I added the juice of half a lemon and half a lime to the batter to increase the citrus kick a bit. This drew raves from coworkers.

This was just a wonderful, true pound cake. I am not usually a great baker, but this cake came out with a gorgeous, velvety crumb and a dense, moist texture. I did increase the amount of citrus zest by about triple, and I also sustituted about half the 7UP for lemon and lime juice. I also had to bake it about 5 minutes longer than called for. I used less confectioners sugar for the icing, but increased all juices and zests to make a thinner, tangy glaze. Everyone devoured it, even though they were already stuffed to the gills from Easter dinner. I will definitely make this again, however the leaden Almond Joy Cheesecake from this site will never see the light of day again!

Was a big hit at my dinner party!! Will make again and again and again. Thanks! Spray very thickly with Pam and the cake won't stick. Let cool for a bit in the pan.

I am really new to baking and I have no problem with this cake. Very easy. It didn't stick (maybe becos I followed the suggestion and sprayed an insane amount of oil on the bundt pan. )The cake wasn't crunchy although the sides did brown. Very yummy though!

This recipe is wonderful!! I love the crunchy top. My husband loves it too. I added lemon and lime juice in addition to the 7-up to the cake and the frosting. Very yummy!! My only problem is getting it out of the pan without it sticking. I've tried vegetable spray, the spray with the flour in it, and the old fashioned butter then flour the pan, and it sticks everytime. Any suggestions?

yum! i couldn't wait, so i cut off the end piece just now. warm, crunchy on the outside, and moist, rich on the inside. i expected more citrus flavour, since i added some juice in addition to the zests, but perhaps it will be more apparent tomorrow. i was a tad short on butter so made up for it with sour cream, added a touch of vanilla and used the bread-crumb method. no problems coming out, and seemed to enhance the lovely crust! i think i will just leave the icing off, though i'm sure it would be quite decadent included...

Superb! Terrific consistency, fresh taste and so pretty, too! We enjoyed this on a hot summer night, and it hit the spot. Followed directions to a "t" and will do so again in the future. I'm just about to send this recipe to friends and family...It's that good!

A lovely, buttery, dense pound cake. Yet, it definitely needs the true citrus flavor beyond the zest...Next time I'll add lemon and lime juice to both the cake and icing. Also, much better blending of flavors on the second and third day.

Rating: 3
This is the best pound cake I've ever made because it was neither too dense nor too dry. The citrus flavors really come through and make the cake although I did add 1 tbsp each of lemon and lime juice as another reviewer suggested. For the glaze, I used both juices and 7up. This also travels well.

Delicious. It was very easy to make and quite tasty. I will make this again.

AMAZING. Simple too. And I didn't make the glaze and didn't miss it - I liked the cake itself without making it too sweet. Everyone loved it - seriously, make this one.

Like the cook from Grand Rapids, this is very similar to a family favorite. Ours has the 2 Tb lemon extract, but no vanilla, and again, the extract & soda are added right at the end and very gently folded in, to keep as much fizz as possible. Can also be made in an orange variant, which will be a little sweeter & drizzled with bittersweet chocolate.

When I saw this recipe It looked like one my mother makes so I just had to try it. This cake tastes just as good as the one my mother makes. I made this cake for some friends and they just loved it and so do I. I will continue to make this cake for a long time.

One of the best poundcakes I have ever made. Everyone loved it! The crunchy crust was excellent. I didn't use the glaze recipe --- seemed to sweet. Instead I used the following glaze: 1 c. confectioners sugar, 1 tbsp lime juice, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 3/4 tsp zest (mix of lemon and lime), pinch of salt --- mix it up and let it sit for 10 minutes before using.

Similar cake has been a favorite in our family for years, only difference is two Tablespoons Lemon Extract and 2 teaspoons Vanilla. Also just barely incorporate the flour then We always add the 7-up and extracts together at the end being careful to not overbeat. Don't want to much glutten, also makes for a cruncher crust! Rather than a glaze we sift with Confectioners Sugar. Happy Baking

I was disappointed in the overall taste...I thought it would have been more citrus-y. Maybe I should have added some lemon and/or lime juice to achieve that, because I do agree with the other reviewers that the texture and moistness were great. I made the glaze but did not use it as it was way too sugary-sweet. If anyone can suggest how much lemon and/or lime juice I should add, I'd try this recipe again.

This recipe was easy and delicious. Everyone loved it!I used squirt instead of 7-up, and it turned out great. Next time I will use for lemon and lime in the glaze, and I will wait until the cake is FULLY cooled, but it was easy and i'll definitley make it again.

A fabulous pound cake - moist inside, with a crispy brown crust. I made the glaze and it was wonderful. Although it could definitely stand alone. Everyone had seconds.

This is a good and easy recipe. However, I added more lemon and lime juice for more flavor. I'd also recommend a frosting of simply lemon or lime juice and powdered sugar.

This recipe is as simple as it is delicious!! I read other reviews and decided not to make the topping. They were right, this cake is wonderful all by itself. The top came out golden and crusty while the inside was moist and tasty. I will make this again and again.

Superb!!!! It's not even gone and I'm already plotting my one!

This is a deliciously moist pound cake! I only made two minor changes. 1) I omitted the lime peel and doubled the lemon peel, because I had no limes handy. 2) Instead of spraying the pan, I simply greased it with shortening and the cake came out perfectly, without sticking.

The ultimate pound cake! I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. It is unbelievably moist, has a nice lemon-lime flavor and the crunchy crust is supreme. I didn't make the glaze and am glad-I think it would have ruined the simplicity of the flavor & texture. I plan to make this for my mom for Mother's Day (although it'll really be for myself...).

This is a very delicious and moist recipe. I wanted more lemon flavor so I added an extra tsp of lemon zest. Also added one tsp of vanilla. I will make this often.

Great texture very moist, very pound cakey--you can taste the eggs, butter and sugar. I would probably add some lemon juice or vanilla to the cake next time for a little more flavor. I put half the batter in and then added about 1/2 cup of lemon curd thinned with a little cream in the middle for a lemon marble effect and I'm glad I did because it punced up the lemon flavor a bit. I also squeezed half a lemon into the icing and dribbled some of it over the cake while still warm and the rest when it cooled. Icing was really thin but had a better lemon flavor and was less sweet. I prefer a glaze anyway....

This was the best pound cake that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. I know you've read reviews that promise perfection and fail to live up to the hype--this is the real thing. The crust was crunchy and full of flavor and the middle was very moist, with a subtle hint of the 7up soda--perfect. Do not hesitate to make this cake, though if you want something light on calories and saturated fat this is not the cake for you!

Cake was great. Light and moist. The frosting was too sugary and thin. Great with fresh strawberries and maybe a whipped cream.

A delicious moist cake. I am currently eating it now and it's more than a week old! I love the glaze. A trick to getting cakes out of the pan is to use Baker's Joy and then follow the advice of that sage Maida Heatter by coating the pan lightly with unflavored bread crumbs. Works every time!

I've made a lot of pound cakes and this is just wonderful.I used the lemon and lime zest the first time and the juice from both in place of the zest on the second cake. Either way it's a winner!

I enjoyed the cake, which was flavorful and moist. I did have trouble getting it out of the pan, though. I'm not sure vegetable spray is as good as greasing the old fashioned way!
