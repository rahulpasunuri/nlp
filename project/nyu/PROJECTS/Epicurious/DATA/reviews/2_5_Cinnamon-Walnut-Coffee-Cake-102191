I picked this recipe because I didn't have any yogurt or sour cream in the house-- It was wonderful.. the church ladies loved it! I added a package of vanilla pudding mix, 5 fresh eggs all different sizes, a little extra butter, and half the baking powder-- I don't know if it was the pudding but it was almost too moist;-))) Will bake again!

Instructions difficult to understand when forming the ring on baking sheet. Not sure if we did it right. It looked like a blob coming out of the oven.

This was HEAVY, HARD and DRY and I followed the recipe exactly. I think using the Bisquick makes it dense like BISCUITS. I wouldn't make this again. Flavor was good..but cakey-ness was too dense and dry. UGh.

This is just about the worst recipe for coffee cake that I have ever made. I would not make this again on a bet.

Quick and easy like it is supposed to be for a basicly lazy cook.

I tried this because it looked and was so easy. My husband and son loved it. I thought it tasted like biscuits. It was good and I would make it again for them, but I've had better coffee cakes.
