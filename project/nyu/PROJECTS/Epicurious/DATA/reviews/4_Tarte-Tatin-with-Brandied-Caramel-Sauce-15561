Ah-mazing. This recipe is so simple and so perfect. I made this for Mother's Day and it was quick and easy. Did the dough the day before, popped the tarte into the oven before we ate brunch and by the time we finished it was golden brown and bubbly. Beautiful, impressive and delicious. This is definitely going into my normal dessert rotation.

This is the best tarte tatin I have found thus far! I have made multiple recipes to find the best one. The combo of apples (granny smith, pink lady, honey crisp if possible) makes an amazing tarte. A fleur de sel sprinkling on the caramel from "A cook's" suggestion adds the touch! Whipping cream or creme fraiche is a great accompaniment. no need for the sauce

after the caramel is made, sprinkle a light layer of salt over it for that salty sweet. I like someone's suggest about tossing the apples in lemon juice to combat the sweetness, too.

Have made this twice and both times no-fail. No need to serve with the suggested sauce - better with whipped cream or ice cream. So, so good, and fairly easy for an impressive special occasion dessert.

Very easy and delicious recipe - love the time saver of skillet to oven! I used Fuji apples and Applejack for the brandy sauce. Thumbs up!

I didn't make the sauce and doubled the butter and sugar by mistake but the recipe is forgiving and everyone loved it.

I've made this recipe several times, experimenting with different varieties of apples. I found that I prefer Granny Smith for their tart flavor which offsets the sweetness of the caramel. I also like the firmer texture when cooked. This is a lovely alternative to a traditional apple pie and just as easy. I serve mine with a high quality vanilla ice cream.

I made this half a year ago and am still thinking about it! Sublime. The crust is buttery, crisp perfection (and don't worry about rolling it out perfectly -- you won't see it in the end). Also, it doesn't need the brandied caramel sauce, which I didn't end up making. In fact, the only complaint I have is that the tarte was very very sweet. Next time I might add a thin layer of mildly sweet cheese filling to balance the very sweet caramel and apples. Also, would be great with pears or peaches...

My very first time making any kind of pastry - thankfully, this recipe is very forgiving! I used a mix of Pink Lady, Fuji, and one Granny Smith - I found it to be just the right sweetness. The caramel turned dark *very* quickly, and it only needed about 8 mins. Also, I made a big mess when I flipped it - I would use a bigger platter with a bigger rim next time!

I love this recipe and have made it several times without ever bothering the make the brandy sauce. It takes longer than you expect but is well worth it.

This was a real hit. I would definitely make this again, and it was really pretty easy...especially if you skip the caramel sauce and serve a good off-the-shelf version.

I used red deicious and macintosh apples that I was try to get rid of. The recipe was easy and didn't take very long. Didn't need the ice, when the sugar/butter started to carmelize I lowered heat and took off stove to cool. Will use a little lemon with the apples next time to balance out the sweetness.

For the filling use a mix of Granny Smith and Fujis. The sauce is good but so is vanilla ice cream or creme fraiche or just au naturel. This recipe makes a better Tarte Tatin than all the many we've eaten in Paris - and even at the original Hotel Tatin in La Sologne.

I found the carmel sauce is very hard to make without burning and i wasn't crazy about the brandy topping. However, the finished product has a nice appearance.

This a GREAT recipe. All my guests raved about how great it turned out. The caramel sauce adds a good kick to the pie. It was SO delicious.
