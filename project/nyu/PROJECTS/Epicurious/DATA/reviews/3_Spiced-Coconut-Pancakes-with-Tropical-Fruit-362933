Really hearty. Not sweet at all, so be warned if you like sweet pancakes. I used a different topping and these were really good. I made them mid-week because they're fast to prepare (I mixed the dry ingredients the night before). Definitely worth trying.

I know this is a vegan recipe but I'd rather eat just one decent buttermilk pancake than ten of these. My kid was spitting these out, even with syrup (first time this happened with the pancakes!). Recipe calls for too much liquid, I had to leave out about 1/4-1/3 of it. Complete waste of good vanilla extract. Naturally, fruit was good, but, as correctly pointed out already, this is supposed to be a pancake recipe and oancakes just weren't any good.

The pancakes are ok, not great. They really need the fruit salad, which is really what makes it.

While others have mentioned they were too paste-like, I found that I needed to leave out at least 1/2 cup of the liquid mixture or the batter would have been far too runny. First off, don't whisk in the ingredients as the recipe suggests - pancakes get gluey if you mix too well. Instead, pour in all of the liquid at once (note: you may want to leave out about 1/2-2/3 of a cup and add it in later if needed) and gently fold the liquid into the dry mixture. You want it mixed, but not fully incorporated. The pancakes by themselves are pretty underwhelming. Grainy texture (even when swapping half of the flour for regular flour) and not much flavor. The fruit topping, as others have mentioned, is what makes them tasty - but really, if the recipe is for the PANCAKES, that's not the best endorsement. The pistachios add crunch but not much flavor. Given how much of a pain they are to shell, and how expensive they are to buy shelled, others' suggestions to sub almonds is likely a good one. Overall, I'd say fold rather than whisk, and make double topping so you taste the pancakes less, and it'll be tasty. Adding eggs might make it taste better, but the point is that this is a vegan recipe - vegan pancake recipes are hard to come by, but this one is a good start.

Disgusting! I hated these. The texture was way off. I halved the recipe because we didn't need 20 pancakes, and maybe that had something to do with the taste. I thought the flavors were rather boring, and really the only thing that saved them was syrup. But even then I ended up throwing most of the batch away. Our cat started to eat one off of the counter- he'll eat anything- and even he wouldn't finish it!

This was AWUFUL!!! I would never make this again. It was so bland and had absolutely no flavor what so ever. I made a few of the pancakes, tried them, and threw out the rest of the batter. Out of 10 i would rate this a -10 and I really do not recommend it.

We loved these! I added toasted almonds and chocolate chunks.

I loved these pancakes!! I did use 1/2 cup of Quinoa flour instead of all whole wheat to make it lighter and give it some protein that I did not get from the eggs. Really filling and delicious.

Excellent! So yummy! I made these as a surprise for my financee because he loves coconut. He didn't make a sound the whole time he ate! I added two eggs as suggested by other cooks and it definitely worked out to the pancackes favor.I put whipped cream on top, and used almonds instead of pistachios. The almonds gave it a delicious crunch factor. And pure maple syrup is the key! And I got a combo of pre-cut fresh fruit...strawberries, blueberries, cantaloupe, honewdew and mango. Delish!! I would definitely make these again!

My daughter loved these. I only made half a recipe since there are just three of us. That way I'd have some coconut milk left over for some curry tonight!

These were fantastic! I love pancakes and I love that these are a healthy alternative to regular pancakes. I will admit that I did add one whole egg to the recipe (the batter seemed paste-like, and the idea of pancakes without eggs seemed odd to me - so that'll up the cholestrol), but it was the tropical fruit salad over it that made the whole thing divine! My boyfriend, who is not a fruit person, gobbled it up! Thank you Mark Bittman!

would add a bit more coconut milk and water next time to make them a little thinner. If they are thicker leave them longer than you would think to cook them through, but since they don't have any eggs I'm not too worried about them to be undercooked.

I made these into waffles, not pancakes. I noticed there are no eggs in the recipe. I always have containers of 5 egg yolks on hand and added 5 yolks. The guys in the house loved them!

The flavor on these is great: not too sweet, and very coconutty. The step of smoothing them out with a spoon when they're in the pan is more important than I'd thought -- they cook better when they're not as thick. It takes some experimentation with heat and thickness to get them to cook all the way through.I just ate them with a bit of maple syrup, no fruit.
