I think this is a great recipe and one can add whatever they like. I had a friend give me some homemade tomato pesto so I used that. I only had green beans and mushrooms which was fab. Super easy and no fuss.

So delicious!!! I added couscous, spinach, and used my own pesto. See my blog post http://katherinescravings.blogspot.com/2011/03/1-pot-meals-are-great-but-how-about-hot.html

The only thing good about this recipe is that it was easy to make. Otherwise it lacked something. It also tasted like something didn't go along with the fish. Idk maybe try with a different fish or no pesto.

Very good and easy! The lemon really stands out! I used cod and it was great.

Made this tonight as a quick meal - excellent! As others suggested, I put down a base of spinach with a splash of balsamic, then the fish, a good quality low-fat pesto, then thinly cut mushrooms, squash and cherry tomato's, followed by more pesto and a splash of hot sauce and lime juice. Great taste, healthy and easy!

I made this for the first time last week. I made it as written, except I left out the hot pepper sauce and used tilapia. It was so delicious! And so quick and easy to put together! I will be making this again and again, and experimenting with it. Yum!

This was an excellent and easy meal! Took many suggesstions from other cooks, including a first layer of sliced portabellos and spinach. Used more Sriracha than called for because we like it hot. Grape tomatoes on top and it was a hit with dinner guests.

Here's how I did it, and it was delish. I don't like asparagus, so that was out. I had zucchini, so subbed that for the yellow squash. When I have it, I use lemon basil to make the pesto...it adds a great flavor...but regular pesto will do. I sprayed the foil with cooking spray, then piled a large handful of raw spinach in the middle. A sprinkle of just a few drops of balsamic vinegar on the spinach for a little zing, then orange roughy went on top, along with the pesto and veggies (minus the hot sauce). Cooked as directed, it was great! This is a great go-to recipe for frozen fish fillets that otherwise don't have that much flavor. I like to serve with parsley potatoes and maybe a little bruschetta.

delicious, healthy and easy recipe. what can be better than that. added mushrooms as a previous cook recommended and thought it was a great addition. used siracha hot sauce since i'm a big fan and it tasted great.

I made this on a camping trip and needed frozen fish. Since red snapper and orange roughy were unavailable, I used perch. I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. The packets were absolutely delicious!

My family loves this recipe. I have made it several times with fresh caught rock fish. I used differnce vegies each time I made it - always very good. I don't wrap the fish in foil though - kinda a waste I think. I just place it in a baking dish and follow with the pesto mixture and vegies. Yum Yum.

Oh yea, I drizzled it with Sirachi Hot Sauce for that extra POP. Yummm

Loved, loved, loved this recipe! I had very little left in my fridge since I just came home from a trip- but would you believe, I had a few carrots, a bit of baby bok choy, a few cherry tomatoes.. I put that on the bottom of the foil, topped with some fresh orange roughy and some homemade pesto sprinkled with a bit of lemon juice and white wine, wrapped it up in foil and baked it off. Presto! simple, fun little packages of frangrant, moist and flaky deliciousness.. Can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was very easy to put togher. I used what vegies I had on hand, 2 zucchini, a tomatoe, and fresh spinach. I covered tightly with foil and baked it in a 9X9 dish. It did take a little longer to cook than stated but I am sure this is because I put it in one dish rather than the idividual pouches the recipe calls for. It turned out very well and I will be making this again. This recipe does create A LOT of liquid.

I'm not a huge pesto person, but I figured I would give this a shot. I used cherry tomatos, more hot pepper sauce and instead of squash, i cut up the heads of a couple portobello mushrooms. Wow- this was FANTASTIC. I think the mushrooms really gave it a great kick. I was pleasantly surprised as I thought this would be yet another Epicurious disappointment.

I was disappointed, pesto taste predominated. Easy dish and pretty. I will substitute white wine and garlic for the pesto the next time that I prepare this dish

loved is....but a few sugestions...use yellow squash,grape toamtoes,and add hobenyaro sause to the pesto

Rating: 4
This was beautiful and delicious. Just a few suggestions: 1) use a fish with skin on one side, and put the fish skin-side down in the foil. Makes it easy to remove after cooking (and also lets you control how much of the juice you want on the plate). 2) use a bit more hot sauce than it calls for, which will give it just a slight undernote of heat and really brightens up the pesto. 3) Use grape tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, cut in half. They're sweet and delicious in contrast to the pesto. I will make this again, and will also try it on the grill. My husband raved!!

I'd have to think twice about making it actually. I was looking for a scrod dish and this is not likely one I would try again. Unlike the Cook from Chicago, I don't think there was a strong enough pesto flavor. As for the hot sauce, what was the point? Completely lost in the dish. Also, fair warning: a TON of liquid comes out of this dish, so don't skimp on the foil and lift the fish out with a flexible spatula so as not to flood the dish nor tear the foil (thus making cleanup more difficult).

THis was a tasty dish however the fish was done much sooner than the veggies. I guess we'd just slice them thinner next time. We used mahi mahi as that's all we had and various colors of squash.

This was fresh and delicious. I didn't need to alter any of the ingredients or quantities. Having said that, you could do all sorts of different vegetables, depending on the season. To the cook who felt he/she was eating a mess. You're assembling your own meal here! It's up to you how to arrange your vegetables, and how many to use. Easy and elegant dish. I served it with the Lemony Mushroom Risotto from this site, which worked really well.

Rating: 3
Another trick to make this is to start with some partially steamed little potatos cut into pieces instead of the squash. I put the potatos down first, and build it up from there, put it on the grill and it is just a hit! With summer comming it is a really easy complete meal on the grill with out heating up the house.

This is fool-proof, elegant, and perfect for guests, because you don't have to hover over the cooking in the last few minutes. The recipe calls for one tblsp. of the mixture. Perhaps the Chicago cook overdid both the lemon and the pesto. I recommended this to a friend who added pickled artichoke hearts, which ruined it. . .the extra flavor took over. Follow it to the letter, and it will turn out perfect every time. I also made it once without the fish, to serve as a vegetable-only side dish with venison in port wine sauce--also very elegant, and easy.

I did not like this. And I like pesto. I purchased a good pesto and the fish was good. But the pesto and lemon was just too much and too much. Not to mention that the veggies were made with the same covering/sauce. I felt like I was eating a mess. I usually cook my fish in a foil packet but I am not going to use this recipe ever again. Maybe I used too much pesto...I don't know. Ugh.

I love this recipe. I served it for the first time to guests and they were equally impressed. Instead of baking it in the oven I baked it on a grill over a campfire for about 15 minutes and it was perfect. Perfect at it is-no changes required!

thought this was fresh and yummy. Only had zuchinni, yellow squash, red pepper, tomato...fantastic combo. thanks

This dish was very good and easy. I used sliced mushrooms, green beans and halfed grape tomatoes. I agree that it's very juicy, but I would have no qualms about serving it in the foil packets to guests. My husband and I ate it that way; I haven't got the patience to try to transfer it out of the foil. Good stuff.

Rating: 3
I splurged on an expensive artichoke pesto and these tasted very nice, but retrieving them from the foil packets was a little tricky. The fish was pretty delicate and the packets had filled with quite a bit of liquid. I might try piercing the foil packets with 1 or 2 small holes next time.

This was delicious! I would definitely make it for company as it was extremely easly and you can make it ahead of time. I did not have Asperagus but did use the Crookneck squash and tomatoes and also used fresh mushrooms. The presentation is beautiful. I would also like to try this same recipe with chicken as a substitute for the fish.

Yummy, fast, and fresh tasting! I used tilapia and halved cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as directed (except I halved it for two people). Next time I plan to add some sliced mushrooms. I served it with steamed brown rice. My husband and I loved it, and it will become a regular dinner item at our house.

I wowed my sister, mother and grandparents this weekend with this dish. I varied the vegetables as some were not readily available to me at the store that day. I also substituted Tabasco's new Chipotle pepper sauce for the hot sauce and it was wonderful. Served the fish and veggies over a basmati rice pilaf. I plan to do this again soon AND mom and grandma are both asking for the recipe!

My husband and I made this last night, using tilapia, and loved it. It was quick and easy to prepare, and delicious. He suggests next time adding more pesto right onto the fish, and I agree. This recipe is a keeper!

This was really great and soooo easy. I used tilapia, halved the recipe, and added some mushrooms that I happened to have. I served it with white rice. It is definitely something I will make again...maybe with different veggie combos.

I was wary of the store-bought(as opposed to homemade) pesto, but it worked fine.I have also made this recipe without the fish -- with vegetables and pesto only -- as a side dish. I don't know a better way to cook asparagus, or summer squash. It was tender but not soggy. Perfect. Easy. Beautiful to look at.

I don't like to spend a ton of time in the kitchen, so I'm a big fan of dishes where you throw the ingredients together and let your oven do the work. I've tried this foil technique with chicken and whatever I have in the fridge and call it "chicken surprise". I made this fish recipe for my boyfriend the first time I cooked for him, and he's asked for it again. We both really enjoyed it. It took 20 minutes to prepare and tasted great. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is very easy to assemble and is colorful. The lemon juice and hot sauce jazzes up store-bought pesto - we've used our own homemade pesto with the lemon juice (skipping the hot sauce) and it was good that way, too. This recipe is really good with garlic/rosemary roasted potatoes.

My husband and I love this recipe; we've made it several times, usually using tilapia, and we serve it with a crusty French bread. We've made it for guests, too, and they raved about it. I'd ruined many a fish recipe before this recipe came along and saved my cooking rep.

Here is another awesome "fish in foil" recipe (all ingredients are to taste): place salmon fillet in center of foil, top with sun-dried tomatoes, diced roasted red and/or yellow peppers (fresh or jarred); grated carrots; minced garlic; minced jalapeno; green onions; then drizzle lightly with Italian salad dressing. Seal foil and put on grill. It's always been a huge hit.

We do "fish in foil" often. I used salmon on a bed of onions, with Old Bay and Cajun spice,layered with pesto, sauted thick cut potatoes, corn and peas, topped with goat cheese and pine nuts. A splash of white wine went into the foil before I closed it and put it on the grill. Yummy.

This is a great dish! Very simple to make and very healthy. This is actually my first try in making a fish dish. I now make this everytime I see red snapper on sale. To make it more tasty, I add more lemon juice and pesto.

Rating: 3
I used catfish and made my own pesto. Red snapper would be better. The pesto mix could have used more hot sauce since with the amount given, I couldn't taste any heat. Otherwise, we really enjoyed the meal with rice and a caesar salad. I will make this again with fish or substituting green beans for the asparagus and chicken breast for fish.

For a specific review, try making the recipe sound a bit more apetizing. Didn't make me want to try it out!
