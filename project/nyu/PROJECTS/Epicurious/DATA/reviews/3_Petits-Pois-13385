This was a good addition to a Thanksgiving menu, as it's quick, simple, adds color, and can be made after the turkey is done. I always keep frozen baby peas on hand for when I don't have fresh veggies, and this is a nice variation.

I am not a big fan of peas but these were incredible. I thought that because the lemon zest was cut thick it would taste bitter, but it tasted great.
