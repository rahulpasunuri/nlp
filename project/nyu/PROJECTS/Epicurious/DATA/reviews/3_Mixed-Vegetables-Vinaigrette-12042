Didn't have squash or radishes so substituted thin red pepper slices. Delicious. Made an hour and a half before guests arrived and kept at room temp so flavours melded. Very easy but beautiful presentation. Used baby red potatoes but my husband still thought they were too big - but I think he's wrong!
