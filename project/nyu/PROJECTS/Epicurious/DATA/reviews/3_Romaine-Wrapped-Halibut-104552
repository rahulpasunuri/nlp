I think this recipe will be amazing if you do something we didn't do, which is to assemble so that the side of the fish you spread with the lemon shallot butter goes up in the pan, not down. We had the butter on top, but after wrapping, we flipped the fillets over so that the wrap would be seam side down. This meant the butter was on the bottom. If it had been on top, it would have melted down into the fish and permeated it with flavor. Instead, the bottom of the romaine wrapper was really nicely flavored, as well as the carrots and asparagus we put underneath. I think this may be the key to the difference in reviews here, as the texture of the halibut was fantastic, but I believe it would have been far more flavorful with the butter being on top. For what it's worth, ours only took 15 mins to cook--I'm sure it depends on thickness of the fillets. We didn't need to blanch the romaine--just held it under an extremely hot tap for about 30 secs per leaf. We did add a few sprigs of thyme, which can't hurt.

This a great summer fish recipe. I have made it several times and my whole family really loves it! My veggie daughter screams for it. If you think it needs more punch, just spice up it up. Be creative. Thanks epicurious

I've made this recipe probably six times. I add fresh sprigs of rosemary (few) and thyme (many) to the top of the fish before wrapping and add inch long green beans (cut) and strips of red bell pepper to the bottom of the pan. The vegies act as a grate and absorb the wonderful lemon, butter, herb run-off. I bake for about 20 minutes.

I gave this one fork because my husband really liked it. I, on the other hand, could barely get it down. I thought it completely lacked flavor or texture. Beautiful presentation, though.

Great dish!! I didn't stray from the recipe at all. It took 20 min to the tee, with 1 1/4 inch thick fillets. I told the kids it was chicken, and they want more! Next time I would definately add the fresh rosemary.

This was perfect for make ahead dinner for 10. Took Cook from Hopewell's recommendations with a few changes. Did blanch lettuce for barely 8 seconds, more than enough. Made a fresh thyme and shallot butter plus sprigs of rosemary for top of each fillet. Braised endive by cutting in half length wise and placing all around the roasting pan with small amount of thyme and shallot butter plus sprigs of thyme. 23 minutes was perfect cooking time. Served with roasted yellow beets and rosemary/garlic roasted potatoes. Cook from Hollywood Hills

I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try, but I thought it lacked flavor, maybe a sauce with a fuller texture would be better.

I usually dislike fish recipes that I make. They are either too bland,too dry, too fishy, or all of the above. I enjoyed this fish recipe when I made it and so did the rest of my family. I put a twig of fresh rosemary in the lettuce wrap with the rest of the ingredients

I followed the guidelines of cook from Hopewell, NY (below) and the results were great. I think it would have been rather bland without the spices. The presentation was great, and the fish still looks good and tastes well cold--something to keep in mind if you're looking for a dish you can make ahead.

Not only adults, but my teenage daughters thought this was the best fish dish they have ever eaten. It has been requested many times. Although I change almost all recepies somewhat, this one did not seem to need any changes.

I took other reviewers advice and jazzed it up a bit. First of all, I "boiled" the lettuce leaves for 8 seconds, any more and I think they would fall apart. Before I wrapped the fish in the lettuce, I placed a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme on top of the fish. I blanched some broccoli and carrots, mixed with julianne (raw)red peppers, and added some butter, shallots, salt & pepper - I place the veggie mix around the fish in the baking dish and put some more fresh sprigs of rosemary and thyme on top. I covered tightly and cooked for 23 minutes - perfect time. I served with plain rice that I spooned some pan juices over; what a beautiful and colorful presentation. This was excellent, I will be making it again with a few minor changes. Next time I would NOT blanch the veggies, there is plenty of cooking time for them to get tender and possibly cut down on the butter, not that it calls for too much, just to watch fat & calories. Also, I would not add potatoes, as another reviewer suggested, I think they would just get mushy.

My fish market was out of halibut, so I used nile perch. The fish was VERY moist. I think the butter /lemon/shallot mixture needed jazzing up...maybe some lemon zest and rosemary??? I'll try it again when I can find halibut!

This recipe was okay, but not spectacular. Nice flavor, but nothing special. I used cod, and garlic instead of shallots. I did not wilt the romaine, as was recommended by another reviewer, and it worked fine.

I would definitely make this recipe for again. It is easy enough to prepare for unexpected company and makes an elegant presentation. I think it also is good for preparing in advance and then popping in the oven while entertaining guests.

This is a recipe I will make again. The fish is so moist and full of flavor.

I substituted mahi mahi for the halbut, As for the time required in the oven - not 20 but 40 min! Also it not necessary to "boil" the Romaine! Forget the wax Paper- stupid , also add cut up potatoes and fresh garlic, wrap all tightly in alumin foil.

I used Chilean Sea Bass instead of Halibut. It was so moist, so tender. Incredible! I served it to company, and everyone raved. The lettuce/shallots/lemon/butter gave it a wonderful flavor, and because you're not using too much butter, no one will go into cardiac arrest. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes (made with olive oil, not milk and butter) and sauteed broccoli rabe, plus tomatoes/mozzarella/basil for a salad.
