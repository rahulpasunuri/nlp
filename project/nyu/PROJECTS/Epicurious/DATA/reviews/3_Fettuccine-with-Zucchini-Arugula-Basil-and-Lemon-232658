This was a great dish for using what I had on hand. I used gluten-free, brown rice pasta, two yellow squash, since I didn't have any zucchini, and a ripe but firm heirloom tomato, instead of the cherry tomatoes. I found the dish summery and light, as intended, though I added more basil and lemon zest/juice than suggested. However, I did not find it satisfying as a main dish--it needed protein! So I crumbled some chevre into it, which made it absolutely delicious--my family loved it.

We made this recipe using vegetables from our garden. The use of fresh aromatics (garlic, lemon, and basil) instead of dried spices made the dish taste very fresh and highlighted the vegetables quite well.

I'm ambivelent about this one. I made it as-is except for the arugula which I didn't have. I would have expected more flavor from the lemon, but it wasn't until I salted it that it had much. All fresh veggies from the local farm, too. We'll finish it, but it's not a keeper. I'll keep looking.

I really liked this as a simple dish at home for dinner, though I probably wouldn't serve it to guests. I hate arugula so I used spinach instead. It could have more punch with the arugula, I don't know. The lemon is a nice touch, and I like the combination of the essentially raw tomatoes with the cooked zucchini/squash.

I made this because I had all of the ingredients on hand. How often does that happen? The only changes I made were to include steamed asparagus in addition to the zucchini, double the lemon juice and zest, use less than the amount of pasta called for and grate a small quantity of parmesan reggiano over it. We found it quite refreshing and light, especially for a pasta dish.

This was a hit with my friends and husband! I used asparagus and zucchini. The asparagus stayed nice and crunchy to add texture. I used much more lemon juice over it, and then grated some parm cheese over everything at the end. I also prepared lemon marinated chicken with it. Very good hot or cold!

I actually thought this dish was quite good. The flavors were delicate and well-balanced. If you're looking for something with strong flavors, this isn't your dish. I made some minor substitutions: Pasta shells instead of fettucine (much easier to mix, serve and eat that way). Two yellow squash instead of one zucchini and one yellow squash. Chopped tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. My one complaint is that it was a little dry. I might add a small amount of pasta water next time. Overall, a light and refreshing dish, perfect for summer.

Loved it and made it twice already! My modifications: added 1 onion and 1 packet of fresh mashrooms, used spinach instead of arugula and used less pasta (50-50 veggies - pasta mix). Perfect!

This dish was a hit with my friends with a wide variety of tastes. I substituted brown rice fettuccine for the regular, and we all loved it.

Mine also turned out very dry. I drizzled some olive oil over the top to moisten it up, which helped somewhat. I'd also recommend using less pasta--the final product seemed like 80% pasta and 20% veggies. But I did like the flavors, a perfect combination of summer vegetables. Next time I might not use whole wheat pasta--my local produce maket makes a fresh lemon-basil fettucine that I think would complement the dish's flavors perfectly. So much for the healthiness of the dish! This is definitely the case where healthy = bland.

Despite using a mixture of fresh spinach and plain fettuccine with parmesan added at the end, this dish was very dry and bland. No doubt healthy but life's too short....
