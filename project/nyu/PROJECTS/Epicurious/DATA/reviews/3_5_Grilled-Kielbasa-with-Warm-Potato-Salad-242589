The potato salad is very good and simple. Actually quite healthy too leaving out the traditional gobs of mayonnaise.

The ease of the recipe is worth 4 forks! I used fresh cilantro & the red onion I had on hand instead of what the recipe called for. I happen to really like this kind of potato salad but this is really an individual taste.

Used balsamic vinegar since I didn't have cider vinegar. Added a bit more salt & pepper to taste in potatoes... Nice change of pace - my 12-yr old liked it!

Very dull potato salad. I like warm potato salad and was hoping the simplicity of this dish would pay off. It didn't. I followed the directions exactly. There wasn't nearly enough oil and vinegar to coat the 1.8 pounds of potatoes I used (the recipe calls for 2 pounds). I'm guessing that you need to at least double the vinagrette. Also, the salad was completely underseasoned and needed more than just salt in the boiling water. Grilled kielbasa is grilled kielbasa, and this salad is a bust. Look someplace else for dinner.

Generally, we arent fans of potato salad, but we found this one to be quite good. The recipe is really simple, affordable, and was prepared in under 30 minutes! I made a few alterations for my own convenience. We used a handful of fresh, chopped basil and a 1/2 tbsp. each of chopped chives and dill because I didnt have any parsley. I oiled, vinegar-ed, salted and peppered to taste. We also used turkey kielbasa because Ive had a rocky relationship with pork. We had a garden side salad instead of the suggested coleslaw.
