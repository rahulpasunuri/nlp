I made this with ground grassfed beef, cut the cinnamon and nutmeg in half as suggested, and loved it!! The hint of cinnamon is something new and different that I really like. Reminds me of autumn. I will be sauteeing this and adding it to my scrambled eggs in the morning.

When I started this recipe, I thought we would be making something like a breakfast sausage. While we didn't get that, we did get an excellent recipe for I know as Swedish Meatballs. The only ingredient I did skip was the cloves; and kept the rest of the spices to half the amount called for. Now, all I have to do is find a recipe for the sauce which, traditionally, accompanies Swedish Meatballs.

After reading the reviews I went easy on the nutmeg and cinnamon, which still gave it an interesting flavor without being overpowering. I cooked mine on a George Foreman grill and they turned out delicious without frying. I like this recipe because it's not too hard to make and tastes really good.

This received rave reviews at our Christmas brunch. I cut the cinnamon, nutmeg & cloves in half and slightly increasesd the herbs based on other reviews. It was perfect!

I am still something of a novice chef and was a little nervous, making these for my parents, but they were really easy and were a hit. I did cut down the cinnamon and nutmeg.

Really good! I made homemade baguettes the night before and made the bread crumbs needed in this recipe from 1/2 of a baguette! Love that! I made them for brunch with my inlaws and everyone LOVED them.

These were good, and I would make them again. However, I found the cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice not quite to my taste. I think that I would reduce the amounts used next time and increase the amount of fresh herbs used.

This was the best recipe ever never again will I buy sausages in the store. This recipe was easy to make flavorful and tender. I can't say enough about it.

These were *really* good, and very easy. I could only find lean pork, and it seemed to work fine. These will definitely be a breakfast staple for us.
