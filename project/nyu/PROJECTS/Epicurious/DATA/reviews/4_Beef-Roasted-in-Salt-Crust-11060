I had never made a standing rib roast in the 42 years I have been cooking but I splurged and made this one for Christmas dinner. It was wonderful. My family raved about it. It may have set a new standard for our traditional holiday dinner. I did roast it until 140 degrees and let it rest for 30 minutes or more. It was still medium rare which suited most of our clan.

i have cooked my Christmas rib roast/prime rib this way for 17 years - it has NEVER failed me -- i usually throw some minced garlic and rosemary under the salt and then bake--nothing better...

The salt crust did not work for me at all no matter what I tried.

Xmas dinner - everyone loved it. I did put herbs under the salt crust a day before. Roasted at 450 for 15 min, then did 2:45 at 325. My thermometer read 148, but after 30+ min. of standing, the rib roast was very rare still - bright red. The unusual look of the salt crust livens the conversation for sure.

It doesn't get easier or more delicious than this! I made 5 for a large gathering. I used a different herb combo for each one and they were all delicious.

Loved it. I made it on Christmas Eve. It's easy, fool proof. (perfect for me). my wife said, "ah, (nasally) t'is alright." which, to put things in perspective, for her to comment that way on something that I made in her kitchen is high praise.

I have used this recipe for several years now. The salt crust makes for an arresting presentation. Always a success. Why this technique works I haven't a clue but speculation about that provided for a lot of fun discussion at dinner. Sadly, there is no way that I can determine to catch usable drippings. To substitute I roast a steak in an iron skillet with several cups of suet. I also rub the steak with garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper to simulate the flavor of the roast drippings. This makes a fair imitation but not quite as good as the real deal. My favorite way to prepare prime rib remains spit roasted over wood coals. Nothing beats the salt crusted recipe for ease and reliability however.

High quality prime rib should be a 4 forker and this recipe guarantees that your expensive cut of meat will be perfect. I followed other's suggestions and herbed the roast first before packing it is salt. I used fresh thyme, sage, and garlic chopped up together with a bit of olive oil and some parmesan cheese. The salt crust guaranteed a perfectly cooked and flavored meat.

I use kosher salt. The whole thing is perfect!

I was charged with making Thanksgiving dinner for my family last year and I made two of these roasts. They were a hit. And so easy! For the second roast, I added the water to the salt a bit more slowly and got the crust to stay on better than with the first roast. But they were both delicious. I can't believe how easy it was. The meat was so tender and juicy. Next time, I will try some of the extra stuff the other reviewers have suggested (i.e. herbs under the crust).

My kids freaked when I told them the crust on the roast was salt - They thought it was going to be awful - SURPRISE!!! It was very tasty and I will be making this more in the cold months ahead

My husband and I were very worried that our beef would taste really salty, but we tried this based on the other reviews. It was amazing! The beef was really moist and tender (we used filet). One reviewer complained that the salt mixtured did not stay on well, try mixing your salt with egg whites rather than water and it stays on much more easily. However, if you use egg whites, line the bottom of your pan with baking paper so you don't spend ages scrapping the salt mixture off your pan.

This is a great way to prep a standing rib roast for Christmas or other major family event...here are some changes we've made over the years...use as a guide and I'm cooking in a hot gas oven. 1) Used a 9.5 pound Prime roast (5 ribs)from a reputable butcher for about 6 adults...plenty of left overs. Brought the roast to room temperature prior to prepping 2) Bought 4 x 3LB boxes of Morton Kosher Salt...used 3 boxes or 9 pounds. 3) Laid down a 1 inch bed of salt; My salt crust was much thicker and we've been making this recipe for years. My brother mixes one box at a time with water slowly added to get that "snowy" salt mush effect 4) Pre-heated oven to 450 for at least a 1/2 hour 5) Inserted fresh herbs: garlic slivers, thyme, basil, sage, rosemary, taragon, pepper under the butcher's string 6) Pack salt around beef, insert meet thermometers 7) Lower oven to 325 and insert into oven on middle rack 8) Set timer for 90 minutes...we cooked it for 90 minutes, but checked at the 1 hour mark...once the 90 minutes expired we cooked it for another 15 to 20 minutes then took it out...we used an instant thermometer in several spots that indicated it was at 130 to 140+ degrees 9) Let it post cook outside oven for 15 to 25 minutes after cracking it out of the salt, covered loosely with foil 10) Meat was rare to medium...probably could have gone another 15 minutes in the oven or so...but we like our prime rib rare... Mix up some Yorkshire Pudding using some bacon grease or other fat since you don't get much drippings...absolutely delicious.

This was a great way to cook beef roast. When picking the roast, look at the roast with an eye for using the salt crust. Make sure the sides of the roast don't slope down from a wide top to a narrower bottom (picture a triangle with the base on top) - or that is where the salt is going. Also, put the thermometer in and let the thing cook. If you pierce the salt crust repeatedly, it'll crack repeatedly. Overall, this was a great recipe. Not salty and very tasty (I too used the herb marinade for 24 hours). Use the Force, trust in these reviews, and enjoy a great holiday treat!

I've never before been so delighted with a recipe that I felt the need to review it. Times have changed! I made this for a friend's birthday last night - it was fabulous! I rubbed the meat with crushed garlic, rosemary and black pepper first, then added the salt crust. Served with a port-rosemary sauce. Incredibly juicy and tender. YUMMY!!! I found that it took longer than 2 hours for my 6 lb. roast , so raised the heat to 375 part way through and it came out fine.

My first roast beef. My husband threatened to call his mother! I used a 2.5 lb. roast. I made it for three adults and two children. Fabulous!!!! So simple and delicious (I'm not a red meat eater). I took the advice of former posters and added fresh ground pepper and herbs on hand. I had thyme and margoram. I also added minced garlic. I made all additions to the salt before rubbing. The key for me was to use the meat thermometer and cooked until 130 degrees. I am not used to this but found it to be a big plus. I used another recommendation and made a sauce by adding cabernet and butter...however, I added a beef broth and water to the pan (not too many juice drippings). Prior to this I prepared red bliss potatoes by soaking in salt water and peeling the middle followed by simmering in water for 20 minutes.I added potatoes to the roasting pan and baked at 425 degrees for an additional 20 minutes. Unbelievable! With addition onf carrots and asparagus...exceptional meal, will make again.

I had to make this to see what all th efuss was about, and I must tell you I was nearly pooping myself the entire time at the thought of expensive meat becoming a salty, unedible nightmare. How wrong I was! The roast turned out moist, flavourful, and PERFECTLY seasoned! I used Britany Sea Salt, which has a high mineral content, and has almost a wet and slightly oily texture, so it stuck to the meat beautifully. I will never make a roast any other way again- it's foolproof and just fabulous! A rare 4 Fork rating from me.

Living in South Africa gives me access to superb beef, and this recipe is one I use each time we entertain as it is successful each and every time! If there are any leftovers (and that is a BIG if) they make for lovely sandwiches for the next few days. I have changed it slightly by rubbing the beef with a mixture of pepper, rosemary, challots and parmesan cheese before adding the salt crust. I also, raise the temperature to 400 degrees and cook it for 20 minutes a pound; and that makes a wonderful rare to medium rare roast. It always gets raves from everyone!

This is our annual Passover main course. Prepared it as written, except I used a bigger beef roast and just multiplied the recipe. (angus beef, 7 ribs) Tender, juicy and SOOOO delicious!

I made this for my fiance and his visiting brother. I had a 10 lb roast that I used. Not only was it SUPER EASY but it was moist, flavorful, and GONE by the next morning! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe and serve it with the horseradish mashed potatoes also found on this site. By the way, although you can't use the juices for gravy, use a little boxed beef broth and make a mushroom gravy.

I have a similar recipe that calls for a 500 degree oven for two hours for the same size roast. That recipe has worked well for me in the past, but I decided to try this one. 325 for two hours? You have got to be kidding! After two hours the meat thermometer barely moved (I checked calibration with boiling water). I also checked my oven temperature--that hummer is smokin'. This is a good recipe if it is cooked correctly. I don't understand the past reviews, unless they like their meat with a lot of moo. As in, still moving.

wanted oh-so-badly to like this but found it quite average. It was good, but not anywhere near the raves other reviewers found. I did end up with it standing, salted, for about 1hour before cooking. Could this have had negative impact?

Like another user, I couldn't get the salt to stick all around...not to worry, the roast turned out AWESOME. Good thing too because I spent $80 ($11.99/lb) for the meat. I would definitely make this again. My guests loved it!

Yes Follow the Epicurious recipe "herbed rib roast" (gourmet december 2000) first. Then add 3 or 4 tablespoons of Hickory smoked salt to this one. Rub on the marinate, then do the salt thing. Place on a rack in the roasting pan and set the cover on crooked so the water can evaporate as it marinates 12 to 24 hours. I roasted per the directions of the herbed rib roast recipe. There is no equil to this combination.

Easy and totally delicious. If I ordered it in a fine steakhouse I'd be thrilled. I did the garlic/rosemary rub before, which I believe added to flavor. Definitely a repeat.

My husband loved this recipe. Very easy.If you have a problem with the salt staying on, try less water. I used Kosher salt (had on hand) which probably helped.We had leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better. I was disappointed that gravy wasn't an option. There was way too much salt in the bottom of the roasting pan. As other people have mentioned, I added fresh rosemary, ground thyme, black & white pepper to the salt mixture. Easy easy easy!

I'd like to know how people kept the salt on the roast - both before and during the baking. I couldn't get it to stay on the sides or the end and once it got in the oven half salt slid off the top leaving most of the roast uncovered. It still tasted good however but probably not how it was supposed to be.

Wonderful! I tried it once per the receipe, and then made it again mixing white & black peppers and fresh minced garlic into the salt mixture. It was even better! This is a real tatse and visual hit when it is brought to the table with the salt crust still attached. Be sure to have plenty of red wine for extra enjoyment. :)

I made this roast on Easter Sunday for a group of 19 people. I marinated it for about 24 hours using the Herbed rib roast recipe, and on the morning of roasting I used the recipe for the Beef Roasted in salt crust to coat the roast in salt. The combination of the two recipes was outstanding! Everyone loved the roast! I will definitely do this again.

This was a huge hit! I did rub it with a thyme, pepper, shallots and garlic paste first. I used some marrow bones and a couple pieces of beef shank to make a strong broth from which I made a wine-based gravy for it, since the pan juices would be too salty on their own. I took as much of the fallen pieces of crust out as possible, tasted the drippings and added a good deal of wine and beef broth to them. Fabulously moist! Oh, and I used a prime top sirloin roast from a premium butcher.

Rating: 4
I used a eye of round roast to excellent results. I look forward to trying a rib roast. I added the rosemary and thyme to the meat before the salt as suggested by previous reviewers. I didn't try the meat juices, but made a beef sauce on the side. I served it with the poblano, chedder mashed potatoes and asparagus and carrots and my family loved the meal.

Rating: 4
I've made salt encrusted chicken for years (same idea!) with wonderfully juicy results. This worked out terrific with the beef, but the salt kept flaking off in to the pan juices, making it too salty for the gravy. How did the others get the salt to stay off the pan juices?

take it one step further and bury the roast in kosher salt. you will need to break it with a hammer. you will find it not salty at all and evenly pink on the inside. I want to try this again with a buffalo roast

Totally exquisite. I had purchased a very $$$ roast and was terrified of messing it up. I started to freak out when my crust started to slightly crumble in the oven, but just kept on roasting. Best roast I've ever made/had, hands down. Its a new Christmas Day tradition! I rubbed the roast with a smidge of olive oil and cracked black pepper before applying the crust.

This roast was one of the best recipes I've ever made. So tender and flavorful, I used fresh rosemary and crushed black pepper as a rub before I put the salt on and it was fabulous. Even as we were putting the leftover pieces away (the few there were) it was still juicy.

Super, super, super! I used kosher salt and the salt "cap" lifted right off after baking. I liked the recommendation to spread some spices (rosemary, thyme and black pepper) on the roast before putting it in the oven. Everyone loved it, and no one found it salty. Good-bye turkey! I'm making this again for Thanksgiving.

I made this for my husbands birthday last night and it was to die for. Tender,done to a perfect degree of rareness and juicey, unbeliveable! The best prime rib I have ever tasted. I stuffed garlic under the fat and rubbed rosemary and tyme on it before puttinh the salt on. I did not need a hammer it salt came off in once piece. Sheer perfection will definately make this again!!!

My wife and I have made this 3 times now; it is always a crowd pleaser. We would make it more however, all that beef and salt would send us to an early grave. (may be thats why it tastes so good). We suggest that you 1st rub the beef with fresh rosemary, and thyme then add the salty goodness. This is great for holiday entertaining. It can feed an army. *warning* this stuff can be addictive.

I've used this recipe three times now and it has never failed me. I used to be nervous about ruining such a wonderful (and expensive) piece of meat, but even I haven't been able to mess this up! I'll attest to the same results as the other reviewers, it is the absolute rave of any dinner where it's served... very unique and absolutely delicious!!!

Thanks to the cook from San Diego! We made a reduction with the drippings as recommended and it was excellent! Rave reviews from all on this and it was amazingly easy! Not salty at all, in fact we had to add salt to the dripping for the reduction sauce. Highly recommend this one!

The kosher salt worked great! It made a beautiful crust however did not need to use a hammer to break it. The top portion came off in one solid piece. After cutting into the meat, I used the juices that came from the meat and added a little butter and cabernet for a nice sauce.

The rib roast was pricey at $52 for an 8 pounder. We couldn't afford to make a mistake, but somehow, we either used too much or too little water because the salt wouldn't stick to the roast very well. It didn't turn out as flavorful and juicy as we expected. Nevertheless, this was a real crowd pleaser -- our friends were really impressed upon seeing the big white mass in the oven!

I love to cook, and this is - without a doubt - everyone's #1 request (over and over). Very juicy, impressive looking: who can believe that it's only 3 ingredients (including water), and so easy to make. One of my friend's husband's called me in a panic when he thought his wife had lost the recipe. He wanted to be sure they could have it again and again...

An easy way to an elegant dish. I prepared this dish for my parents who were driving from out of town (about 9 hours away). I served the beef with sandwich bread and condiments as well as mashed potatoes and gravy. Before patting on the salt crust, I inserted cloves of garlic into the meat and sprkinkled the roast with thyme, marjoram, and basil. The roast was very flavorful and moist, a real accomplishment for me because I've never been able to cook a steak or roast. Leftovers make great sandwiches as well.
