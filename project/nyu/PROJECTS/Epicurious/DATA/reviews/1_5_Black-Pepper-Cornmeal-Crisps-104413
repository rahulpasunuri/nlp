These took lots of time to make, and aren't anything special. Mine came out very greasy, even after draining and cooling on paper towels. I don't think I'd serve them to company.

This didn't go over quite too well with my party folks, so I won't be making it again. I thought it was okay but wasn't all that thrilled with it.

skeet....hmmmm, not a bad idea. You would think after all the trouble to make them, they could serve a useful purpose.

Leaden and tasteless. My pooch wouldn't even eat them and he eats everything. Are you sure that this is a cracker recipe, not a crapper recipe?

To "Cook" from W Va: The recipe "sounds like"?... most people actually try a recipe before rating it. It is a cracker recipe. Let us know if you taste it before subjecting us to your so-called opinion.

people like to try something different, and this recipe definitely has a better taste with either a cheese dip or any vegetable dip, good for the holiday season.

This recipe sounds like it would be put to good use at the local Skeet and Trap range as targets.
