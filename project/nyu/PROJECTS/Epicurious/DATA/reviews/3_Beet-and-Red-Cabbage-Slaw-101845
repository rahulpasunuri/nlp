Time shortage and gaps in our larder forced us to make the following variations: reduce vegetables by about 1/3 (as much as our largest bowl would hold); no caraway; dried dill, about 3/4 tsp.; microwaved, not roast, beets; reduce (olive!) oil to about 1/3 to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1 tsp. Excellent!

This recipe was a hit at the barbeque we had yesterday with 25 people. I used a little less dressing than the recipe asked for to make it a little lighter. Other than that, I would not change it one bit.

We made this as a side for a summer cookout a year ago and no one liked it. It tasted like nothing and it made a LOT!! We all love beets and were excited about making them into slaw. I came across this while looking for a new beet recipe and vividly recalled the disappointment and the massive quality.

Very tasty. This recipe make a lot of slaw; I halved the recipe and it still was plenty for 4-6 people. I chopped (rather than grated) some of the beets to mix up the texture a bit. Overall very good.

Very good. Great way to use lots of "farmers market" finds. Ours has the greatest beets of all sizes and colors. Used sherry vinegar and a little less sugar. Even friends who don't care for beets liked this one.

Without a doubt, the best slaw recipe I've ever tried. Can't recall the last time I sat down with a bowl of anything healthy and ate till my tummy hurt. I ground the caraway, beefed up the mustard, substituted olive for corn oil and omitted the carrots. I used about a cup of minced parsley along with the dill--the color contrast was lovely. Next time I will use red onion and a bit less sugar...and perhaps sprinkle on some blue cheese for added contrast. Beet-ambivalent individuals will like this.

Having extra beets (red cabbage, too) from my garden, it is great to find a recipe like this that really complements the garden fresh vegetables! I recommend it!

The salad was delicious, easy to make, and able to be made 24 hours ahead, adding the fresh dill at the end. The color was absolutely fabulous - a luscious cranberry color! I used raspberry vinegar and omitted the carrots.
