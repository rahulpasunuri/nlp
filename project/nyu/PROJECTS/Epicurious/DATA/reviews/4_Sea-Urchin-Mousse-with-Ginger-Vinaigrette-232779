Does anyone have any idea where to buy sea urchin roe -uni? I want to try making this! In our local Asian market they sell something called 'Goni' is this the same thing? I asked at the Market what 'Goni' is & no one could answer me, language barrier problem. You can leave a note on my 'fridge door' if you'd like to with any info about this or post it here {fridge door is better though I'll be sure to get the note! thanks!}

I'm thinking about making this as a filling for profiteroles. Was thinking about adding ginger and lemon to the choux pastry and then piping the sea urchin mousse into them. Does anyone have any thoughts on what I might want to keep in mind when I do this? Thanks for your advice.

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it several times to rave reviews. In Chile the sea urchins have a particularly intense flavor and this recipe suits them well.

Very versatile and unusual dish. Not hard to make but read the directions carefully. Next time I'll use slightly less lemon. This amount was just a bit too much.
