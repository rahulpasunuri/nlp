Fantastic! A Top-Five-Favorite! And the sauce is great to make again and again: try it on pasta, bruchetta, sandwiches, give it as a gift! Yum!

Loved this, and made it many times. (As a matter of fact, the cheese is cooling as we speak) It's the very strength of the sauce that makes it.

The sauce is delicious, really rich and intense. We have made it many times, though usually I simply melt fresh mozzerella on top of fresh italian bread or just toast good bread and we dip it in the sauce.

I don't know if I did something wrong, or what I could do to make it better, but this was an utter disappointment. However, the sauce was excellent and I use it all the time for homemade mozzarella sticks.

Great recipe. I have been looking for years for the same recipe minus the anchovys. My family and I used to order this dish at an Italian rest. in Puerto Rico. I removed the Anchovy and it reminds me of those days. Thanks

The mozarella turned out great. The sauce was delish, next time I won't put all the anchovi in, a little to overpowering. This would still be great with regular marinara

Loved this. Made it with a bed of mixed greens and placed the cheese on top with the dressing. Everyong was in love with it.

This was a lot like cheese sticks, but in my family (which proudly admits to loving buffalo wings, chicken tenders and potato skins as well) that is not an insult. I made the sauce which was fine, but I liked it better dipped in good old fashioned marinara sauce. Will make again, sans sauce.

This recipe has been used again and again in my house. You absolutely have to use fresh large rounds of mozarella. Use the italian white anchovies in olive oil also instead of the canned variety. The sauce is great with other dishes also. It tastes in no way like cheese sticks if prepared correctly.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I thought it tasted like glorified cheese sticks.

Hate to be a voice of discontent (and I have never rated any recipe on this site so low)...but this just didn't cut it. Sauce was overpowering, and the mozza got watery after holding on a warming tray for 5 minutes.

This was well received by company. nothing leftover!!For the reviewer that had cool down issue when making batches, I put them in the oven while making more and they were fine.

My sister and I made this for a special gathering of FOABS, a small annual vacationing group of ours. It was a great hit. Loved the sauce. Keep the cheese chilled! That's the secret to getting the golden brown color before the cheese melts!

My family and friends love this recipe. I put the dressing on top of a mixed green salad with fresh tomatoes and place the cheese on top of all with a little extra dressing.

This was really good and very easy to make. One concern, though it isn't enough to keep me from making this again, is that if you fry the mozzarella in batches, your first batch is not quite hot when you serve it. But overall, yum!

Different and delicious! The sauce definitely livens up what would be a typical fried mozzerella dish. I find that it's not necessary to use fresh bread crumbs; prepared ones are fine.

a complete and utter indulgence! sinful! i used the leftover breaded mozzarella as a garnish on a simple tomoto sauce with penne; i will make again, but not too soon as this is v. rich and loaded with fat-but well worth it for a special treat every now and again!

I've made this twice now and it's really good. I made a mistake the first time by putting too many in the pan at once. The breadcrumbs didn't really get very brown before the cheese started to melt and run. The second time was great. My guests were discreetly using their fingers to get the last bit of sauce off the plates.

I could not wait to try this recipe, it was fantastic! My Husband said he could eat this dish as a main. My guests raved about it. Don't be afraid of using all the required anchovies, this dish is not at all salty tasting. I will make this again and again!
