Wow great recipe! I was afraid of doing the egg yokes, but it was relatively easy. The Truffles should however never be cooked! Add the Truffle oil to the sauce but grate the fresh Truffles onto the finished dish. They are too delicate to cook and you will loose much of the great taste and aroma by doing so.

This recipe is unbelievable. "Soft egg ravioli" sounds kind of unappealing (to me, at least) but the taste is one of the richest, most luxurious to ever come out of my kitchen (and I try my hand at a lot of 'fancy' recipes).If you've got some nice fresh eggs on hand, MAKE THIS RECIPE for a special occasion. I don't have a pasta maker and I followed directions too closely. I would recommend, if you don't have one either, leaving off right after you make the dough- leave it in 2 pieces, rather than 4, for resting. Roll them out and make life easier by simply spooning your filling directly onto a big sheet of rolled dough. Then subdivide with egg wash and lay the top blanket of dough over the whole thing, press down between raviolis, and cut. I also served these with asparagus spears underneath the ravioli as another reviewer did (no truffles at my store, but definitely don't omit the truffle oil). It was delicious. Try this!

Agreed that this dough recipe is GREAT for any ravioli, so long as you find the correct water/flour balance (I had to add more flour the second time around). Rolls out beautifully to a #2 setting using the directions given. Tweaked the preparation slightly though: I used a 1 3/4" ravioli maker (looks kind of like an ice cube tray), filled with quail egg yolks (Asian market had a bunch in from CA) and then about a 1/2 tsp ricotta. Chilled in the fridge until the last second, then tipped them in to boil in batches for 2 minutes (1m 20s if not chilled). Skipped the sliced truffle, so went heavy on the truffle oil and topped each individual ravioli with a little Tartufi brand truffle/mushroom salsa (looked like caviar, cute). Made 2 batches of dough, 1 batch of ricotta filling, yielding 70 or so ravioli. Served with asparagus and Chicken al Mattone from Bon Appetit 09 (another delicious recipe, but not on this site - go to bonappetit.com) for a nice Mother's Day dinner. Just awesome.

Fantastic. For starters, the dough for this ravioli is a keeper for all sorts of fillings. Not having real truffles available, I just used brown butter and a really good truffle oil with shaved parm on top. I also put several grilled asparagus under the ravioli for a complete meal. Although it takes time to prepare, I will definitely serve this over and over to my special guests.

This was a huge hit. I made my ravioli larger and just served one per guest. I made a brown butter sage sauce and drizzles a bit of truffle oil on top. Very easy to make in advance and an elegant pasta course!

this is the best dough recipe, hands down ... don't have a pasta machine - separated in four parts and rolled out with a pin, used a ravioli press that i picked up on the cheap, it looks like an ice tray ... makes a dozen at a time - amazing results ...

It's a pasta dish that will instantly become a point of reference for any other pasta you have in your life. You eat it and tuck away the rich, decadent flavor into the back of your mind until you're reminded of it again. They say you never forget your first time, and I guarantee that you or your guests will never forget the first time you try this dish. www.foodyi.com

Fabulous, but I used semolina for the pasta. I know that's a no-no with filled pasta, but it gives you a less gooey dough, which keeps the egg from breaking through. Use 2 cups of semolina, about 1-1/2 TBSP truffle salt and 3 whole eggs. Put the semolina and salt in a food processor, beat the eggs and pulse until you have a just-slightly-sticky dough. Roll into a ball and let sit 1/2 hour before rolling out by machine. You MUST let the dough sit so the gluten can relax. I rolled this out to setting 5 on my machine. I thought it was a wee bit thick, but my husband loved it.

This recipe was unbelievable. The silkiness of the egg yolk paired outstandingly with the rich truffle-y goodness. The only problem I ran into was the parchment paper sticking to the ravioli when I was ready to lift them up to put them in the pan of water. However, I worked around this problem, cutting the parchment paper out around each ravioli; it fell off once dropped into the saucepan. Make this! It is a beautiful an impressive dish!
