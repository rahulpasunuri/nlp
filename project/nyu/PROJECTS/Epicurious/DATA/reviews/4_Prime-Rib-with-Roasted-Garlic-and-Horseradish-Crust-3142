Absolutely wonderful. Forms a delicious & beautiful crust on prime rib. Baked at 350 for about 3 hrs and had a lovely 8 lb prime rib that really impressed. Served with yorkshire puddings, yumm. I didn't put on paste ahead of time but still turned out great.

I don't cook beef very often, but wanted to do something special for Christmas dinner...something other than the usual turkey. Well, I must say I knocked it out of the park. I made the spread yesterday and slathered it on the fatty side of our 8 lb ribeye roast and let is sit in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 24 hours. 450 for 20min, then 325 until internal temp of 130. Perfect medium rare. And flavor....this is simply the best prime rib I have ever tasted. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Followed the recipe and put on the rotisserie until rare, tented and let rest for 30 min. It was fantastic. We had it at Thanksgiving along with a cranberry brine smoked turkey, also worth a try. It is on food .com #146224 Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've always hesitated when it came to beef roasts -- getting it done right was just intimidating to me for some (now strange) reason. I made the leap with this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was an absolute hit -- gorgeous flavor and perfectly done. You'd be hard pressed to do better with a recipe that requires so little time. Followed the recipe exactly, but I think fresh rosemary would be really nice in the "crust."

I was looking for a prime rib receipe for New Year's Day and ran across this one. All of the other reviews certainly helped me make my decision and I think it was the right one! When my husband and I sat down for dinner it was very quiet...except for the m.m.m.mm.m. about the crust and the flavor of the prime rib. Absolutely perfect...definitely bake at 500 degrees for the first 15 minues...took out of the oven at 115 degrees...this is a MUST try!

This is the third year I'm making this recipe, and every year it is better than I remember it being the year before. I make a 22-23 lb roast and triple the recipe and it works flawlessly. I also do the sear at 500 for 15 minutes then slow cook for the remaining. Last year it cooked quicker than anticipated because of our convection oven, but definitely take it out early! I was nervous last year that it would come out undercooked when I pulled at 120 but it came out perfect!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe before!!! I have made it MANY times over the years and it has always been a HIT and people ASK for it!!!! I don't always puree the garlic and horseradish, but sometimes just mix it for a more "rustic" look. It's a great recipe either way, and VERY forgiving!!!

If you really read through all these reviews and got to mine congrats! You must like roasted garlic to enjoy this recipe due to the strong flavor. A nice digital read probe type thermometer is best. That said it is simply delicious and all advice is accurate. Pre-heat to 500, roast about 15 to 20 min, lower heat to 325 and finish, pull the roast between 120 and 125 degrees at center. I added about 3 tbs of fresh cracked pepper to the puree. Dont be afraid to add more horse radish, this is a very forgiving recipe, nothing needs to be exact. Next time I think I may add a good portion of Grey Poupon. If youre not used to roasting garlic, use a toothpick to test for doneness, should be very soft and come out clean, if you get the garlic too done it compromises the flavor and texture, very dark caramel color is usually too done, it should still be on the whiter side and very soft. Start watching it after about 25 minutes; check every 3 to 5mintues after that. You can roast them out of the husk but you get a better texture and flavor when you leave them in. After taking them out of the oven pull them from the oil ASAP and place in a cool spot to help stop the cooking process, they will keep cooking if you leave them in the oil to cool. I poured about 3.5 cups of beef consume in the roasting pan as it went to the oven. When it came out, I poured off some of the fat and put the drippings/bits into a sauce pan with another 2 cups consume and simmered it down about 15 minutes for wonderful au jus gravy. Served with garlic, rosemary and bacon loaded mashed potatoes, artichoke with dill mayo and green salad with fresh bacon bits A nice peppery Zinfandel wine is recommended. Bon appétit.

I make this every year for Christmas dinner and the whole family loves it. I add cracked pepper to the crust before cooking. I have done it in the oven using the method of starting out at 500 degrees and then lowering the temperature with great results. I have also used this recipe with my rotisserie, and it's even better, although a bit messy as the crust will partially melt off.

Amazing. This is my go-to recipe for prime rib. Always great; very forgiving. Make sure you pull it at 125, though, as at that point, the bulk of it is rare. Parts will already be mid-rare to medium. Also, have your butcher cut out the bones and tie them back in. I think it tastes even better, and you just untie the bones when you're ready to serve. Enjoy!

Threw in about 1t of thyme plus 1T chopped fresh rosemary, and started at 425 for 15 minutes. A group of people who rarely eat red meat gobbled it up!

This was easily the absolutely best prime rib I have ever eaten. My only variation on a theme was to barbeque the prime rib in my big green egg. So, not only was the crust garlicky and yummy, but it had a slightly smoky flavor, too. I also trimmed almost all visible fat from the outside of the roast prior to cooking. The 4.5 lb roast (which included the bones) was perfectly medium rare throughout after 1 hour and 30 minutes at 350.

If you have any bone in the roast, the bone absorbs heat, so your cooking time may be a bit longer. I prefer bone in. This recipe is absolutely fabulous. Your guests will all think you are a brilliant cook.

This recipe is so easy to make. I had a 13lbs prime rib to roast so I double the portion of ingredients. I have a convectional oven so it took about 2.5 hrs to cook. Like other say begin at 500 degree for about 15-20 minutes to roast the top then pulled the temp down to 350 degrees and stuck a thermometer probe in the side of the rib. Reading the thermometer reach 115 degree we took out the rib and let sit for about 1/2 hr. before slicing. It might look dried on the outside but very moist on the inside. Turned out perfect medium. It was so good my mother asked me for the recipe. Will definitely make it again

This is by far the best Prime Rib EVER! I peel the garlic before baking, it's much easier that way. Just toss the cloves in the microwave for about 15 seconds and the peels come off easily. I usually prep the prime rib in the morning of the same day I cook it. Turns out great every time.

Well, we just finished the fam-damly- dinner, I had never done one of these, but with all your rave reviews, I went and bought a huge (9 bone) prime rib...but then cut it in half, and roasted the two side by side, because I only had good instructions here for the regular sized ones. We had alot of wonderful rare, to medium rare, which is what most ordered...I left it in at 500 for 1/2 an hour, then down to 350 for another hour or so, waiting for the magical 115. The garlic/horseradish mush (doubled the recipe)was on for 48 hours before, great flavour...the whole room was very quiet when they were eating (unheard of behaviour)- everyone was totally enjoying this treat. I know its pricey, but sure beats family- restaurant tabs, once it was in the oven, it cooked itself. Made Yorkshire puddings and made the au jus by adding drippings to 4 cups beef broth(not the concentrated kind), and a bit of thickening with a mix of 2 Tblsp flour and 2 Tblsp worcheschire sauce. We roasted chopped root vegies on the bbq, made a strawberry/spinach salad, and had buffet banana splits for dessert...thanks for all the great feedback to encourage others to do it, its the best way dive in and try something new! will definitely do this one again.

Excellent, but then really, how can you go wrong w/ an $86 cut of meat?!? Made this for a Valentine's dinner party for 8 people and it made just enough to have left overs for a couple of sandwiches the next day, which was a bonus! I only let it marinate for 6 hrs and it seemed great to me. Don't know what another 12 hrs would have done. I did as other reviews suggested and "started in a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven for about 15 minutes and then turned down to 325 until internal temp was 115 degrees. Pulled and rested for about 3o minutes and had a beautiful rare to medium rare roast." The crust was fabulous, but truthfully, it was quite singed & ugly. Would suggest serving slices on a platter, rather than taking the whole thing to the table. Better presentation and people will have an easier time choosing the piece they would prefer. Don't bother taking time to make the horseradish relish listed w/ this recipe -- Put out nice quality horseradish, which is what everyone wants w/ this cut anyway. Will make again!

I made this recipe on the weekend and it was fabulous. The crust turned out perfectly and the beef was juicy and tender. Like a previous reveiwer I had to add beef broth to the pan because the crust kept all the juices in and I had nothing in the pan. I will definately make this again and again.

I had just a couple hours before cooking and it still turned out great. Can't wait to try it again.

For those of you feeding a crowd, we used a 17 pound bone in (7 ribs) roast which barely fit in the roasting pan. I doubled the garlic/horseradish rub but probably didn't need to, there was more than enough. We roasted it at 450 for 15 minutes then added a can of beef broth and one of water to the pan (roast was on a v-rack) otherwise the juices evaporate. I would suggest adding this when you first put it in the oven or else you'll have a smoke-filled room. We decreased the temp then to 325 for nearly 4 hours by meat thermometer. Much longer than anticipated and next time would buy two smaller roasts. That being said, this was an excellent recipe, the ends were medium, the middle perfect medium-rare. We served it with a sour cream horseradish sauce and Garlic Mashed potatoes. Rave reviews, would have fed at least 15 people (we only had 11 so plenty of leftovers!)

I made this last night for a get together and now I will never go out for prime rib again. It was so good. I used a 4 lb roast and started it at 500 degrees for 15 minutes and then down to 300 for an hour and only get the internal temp to 105. It was perfectly medium rare. Served 4 people gererously. Did anyone else have the crust turn bluish green on the inside. It was not a meat stamp. I swear there was some chemical reaction between the garlic and horseradish and it was blue. Kind of embarrassing but we all got over it once we tasted it.

This is an excellent way to prepare an expensive piece of meat. The coating kept the roast juicy and added great flavor. As suggested by others, I started it in a 500 degree oven and lowered the heat to 325 after 15 minutes.

So delicious! And soooo easy to make. I made the garlic-horseradish rub 2 days early and let it sit on the roast. I took some preious reviewers advice and baked it for 15 minutes at 500. The only complaint I have is... it came out a little too rare for me. And I even baked it until it was about 135 on my meat thermometer. So... I'd bake it a little longer. But, it was very tender, juicy and flavorful.

This is now our main dish for Christmas dinner. I added slightly more horseradish (we are big horseradish fans) and fresh rosemary to the recipe. We also slow roasted ours in the BBQ over low medium heat until the thermometer registered 115 degrees.

No matter how many times I make this roast, I am totally excited by it. The flavors are perfect together and the meat is so tender from "marinating" and the slow roasting. The house smells so good when I make this.

Definitely let the meat sit for as long as possible.

This sounded like a terrific recipe. The standing rib roast I used in this recipe came out well, nice and juicy. But the crust didn't seem to add a lot of flavor or zip to the meat, even though I let it stand in the refrigerator overnight. I think if I had used a boneless cut of meat it might have been great.

Excellent recipe. We have been making prime rib for many years for "special events/holidays." We have looked for a "better" recipe often but, usually decide that simplest is best. While sometimes that is true, this really was a great approach. The horseradish is not overpowering. We used a slightly larger roast and threw a few extra cloves of garlic in the oven. We also let it sit in the fridge the night before; a good idea. Key is letting the roast sit at least 20 minutes after it comes out of the oven. It makes a big difference. Serve with simple mashed potatoes (although we went overboard and mixed in sauteed onions).

Doesn't ANYONE dislike this recipe? Apparently not! It's GREAT! Marinate the roast 2 days! Start it roasting at 500+ degrees for 15 minutes to sear it and begin the crust. Use an instant read meat thermometer for proper "done-ness". Remember, the temp. will go up 5 to 10 degrees after removal from the oven because heat from the outer part of the roast will continue to spread into the center. Great roast. I served it to guests at a $300 a plate charity event and they swooned.

Absolutely fabulous! Made this for Christmas dinner (accompanied by the potato gratin with goat cheese and garlic, yum!!). My dad said that "like" just wasn't a strong enough word for this. It was incredibly easy (I made the crust and put it on Christmas Eve morning, and let it sit in the fridge till afternoon on Christmas Day), and is by far the best roast I've ever made. I didn't really use the time, but rather, watched the temp with my instant read (125 with a 30 minute rest was perfect rare middle, with a better done outside edge with a crispy crust.)

This was the most increadible prime rib I have ever had. The crust really sealed in the juices, and the meat was extra tender. If you love garlic, you can add one more fork to my rating. I cooked a 2-rib, 3.75 pound roast and I baked it at 350 degrees at 18 minutes per pound and the roast was a little on the rare side. To make sure the crust is not burnt, try 325 degrees at 22 to 25 minutes per pound.

This was one of the best Prime Rib recipes I have ever tasted! We cooked ours over indirect heat on the BBQ and also added Chardonnay soaked wood chips. Also, instead of putting the garlic cloves unpeeled - try this... it's actually a recipe called Bagna Cauda. Peel the 30 cloves and put them in a small oven proof dish. Pour good quality olive oil until it covers them. I also like to add some rosemary. (Bagna Cauda calls for anchovie fillets as well). Cook the garlic covered at about 375 for about 40 minutes or until the garlic starts to get a lovely golden brown. I used the garlic and some of the oil in the paste. Reserve the rest of the oil and put in your fridge and use for anything calling for olive oil or garlic butter etc. This prime rib was tender and garlicky! Our guests raved about it - No leftovers at all!

The best prime rib roast you'll ever eat. The tricks are to marinate this roast for at LEAST 24 hours, which makes all the difference, and don't mess with the recipe unless you feel a need to. It's perfect just the way it is. I use a mini-food processor which makes it a breeze, and for the roasted garlic, just roast a large or 2 small heads of garlic drizzled with the olive oil and covered, then squeeze out the garlic in one fell swoop. I've served this many times, and the leftovers make the best french dips. Put the flavor of this beef up against any other recipe and this one will win, hands down.

Excellent. Thanks for the earlier suggestions - I marinated it for over a day, and took it out of the refrigerator 1 1/2 hours before cooking.

This is a very good recipe, except that the horseradish crust wasn't as sharp as I would like. Next time instead of using creamy style horseradish, I'm going to use plain, grated horseradish, which has a sharper flavor. Otherwise, I loved the recipe and would definitely make it again.

I have made this several times. It has always brought nothing but ahh's and ooo's. A few hints I have discovered along the way; Peel the garlic before roasting (less mess). Insert slivers of garlic and jalepeno peppers into the roast before applying the paste (honestly, it will only create a mild flavor). Be generous with the course salt and fresh cracked black pepper. And last, let the roast marinate for no less than 24 hours!

I really wished I'd marinated the prime rib for longer. Three hours was totally inadequate. The next time I do this, it'll be marinating for at least a day. It still tasted very good, but don't consider doing it if you can't marinate it for the full time. I think I'll be doing it again, but the price of prime rib and my initial mistake (I'd give it a 7/10) are making me a bit apprehensive.

Superb!!! I made this for New Year's Day dinner and it turned out really well. I did not have the recommended garlic cloves so I used about 10 cloves and added a little minced garlic from a jar for the last five minutes of the "garlic roast." I also added some oregano, basil, and rosemary to the blended paste. After five hours I placed the rib roast in the Ronco Rotisserie (don't laugh, they really work) and in 90 minutes we were eating the most perfect medium roast. Excellent crust and very juicy. Highly recommend!

This recipe has spoiled my husband to this recipe for good! I put the crust on a day in advance - well worth it. The roast did take a little longer than the specified time to cook. Next time I will brown it with a kitchen torch, as the blackened crust is absolutely delicious. A definite repeat, especially for company. It goes very well with roquefort potato gratin and a good cabernet.

Delicious. I made it for Christmas dinner instead of turkey and everyone asked for the recipe. I used a sirloin tip roast instead of prime rib and put beef stock in the roaster. It was juicy and tender and great the next day for sandwiches.

My 2nd Christmas with this dish. I wouldn't think of doing Prime Rib any other way and my guests would be disappointed if I did. I think I'm stuck with a tradition.

This roast turned out to be delicious, but took almost an hour longer to cook than expected. Give yourself some extra cooking time, because this is well worth the wait!

A great recipe. The crust was yummy and the roast was enjoyed by all. Next time I'll insert a few slivers of garlic into the prime rib for a little extra flavor. Everybody raved about the smell as it roasted and the crust was a visual hit. Leftovers were positively devoured.

I made this for CHristmas last year, and plan to do so again. A taste everyone will enjoy!

This is the best Prime Rib Ever. I Baked the garlic in foil with Olive Oil instead of baking each clove in a dish then just squeezed out the finished product. also I Marinated the Crust on the roast for 24 hours. I also used a bone in roast which I find more flavorfull

Prepared this for 12 guests for our monthly dinner party. Used a 7.5# Delmonico roast so not much fat. Followed recipe except for cut back to 1/2 of the horseradish. Added salt and pepper directly on roast. Great hit...I will make it again over the holidays

Made this recipe for Passover Seder to mouthwatering raves. The bar has been raised for the meat course in the future.

Everybody loved it! Lots of flavor! It wasn't actually a "crust" though, a bit more like a paste. Is that how it should be? Still fabulous though. I think next time I will marinate it for longer than 3 hours. The leftovers make PHENOMENAL sandwiches!

Excellant rib roast! I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved. It had such a great flavor. I would make it again and again

Everyone raves when I make this dish. It is a definite keeper - great for special occasions. I opt to marinate overnight - more intense flavor this way.

This recipe works well with or without the beet relish. I had the butcher prepare a 5 rib roast for us and it turned out perfectly. There really is something about roasted garlic that really compliments the roast beef. Don't cook it too long as it will continue to cook as you let it stand at the end. I find it best served between rare and medium-rare.

This recipe was suprisingly easy to make. After two hours in the slow oven, the crust was beautiful. Our guests were overwhelmed by the full flavor of the meat with the garlic and creamed horseradish sauce. We will make this again.

I made this with a Rib Eye Roast instead of Prime Rib for Christmas. One of my guest said"This is the best piece of beef I have ever had." I guess that says it all.

The prime rib was terrific but the real standout was the beet,red onion and horseradish relish. I plan to make this again and serve it with other dishes. Do make this well in advance since the flavors soften with time. Even for non beet lovers it was a hit.

This was an outstanding recipe for Prime Rib that we served on Thanksgiving. The crust kept the Prime Rib very moist. As a matter of fact we had less than one-half cup of juice in the roasting pan from a full size Prime Rib. Guess what is on the memu for Christmas.

Iomit the horseradish and use raw garlic, olive oil, salt and worschtershire sauce in a blender to make the crust.....everyone loves it

I added 1 Tbsp crumbled dried rosemary, 1 1/2 Tbsp freshly cracked blacked pepper, and 2 tsp dried thyme to the overnight rub. Simply magnificent. The crust is outstanding and memorable to be sure. A beaujolais will wash down nicely. Or anything you like because the meat is so good, you won't care! Buen provecho!

Instead of cooking the garlic in the oil I would just put it through a press add the horseradish salt pepper and spread the mixture all over the roast and bake as desired. This way you get the true flavor of garlic troughout the roast and the smell in the home while cooking is FANTASTIC!!!!!
