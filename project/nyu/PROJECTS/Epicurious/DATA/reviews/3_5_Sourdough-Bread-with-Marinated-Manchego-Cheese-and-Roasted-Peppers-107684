This is hands down my absolute fav appetizer! Even my 8 year old son loves it!! My dad made it for a party he had a few years ago and since then I have requested it at every birthday, mothers day, etc. bash I can get away with!! Now this weekend is both his birthday and fathers day and I am making it for him for a change!! It is a perfect recipe as is!

I'd give this 3.5 forks; I made it this weekend, and am convinced the recipe is incomplete. I had some left over, and popped them into a 400 degree oven for long enough to melt the cheese (ca 5 min). With that, the cumin really popped out and the other flavors were enhanced as well. The idea is not to toast the bread but to melt or nearly melt the cheese.

My first Manchego cheese was in the Dominican Republic- and I loved it. This recipe brings back nice memories.

I made this for a cocktail party and got rave reviews. I made it "to recipe" with the manchego cheese and it is definitely something I will make again.

I have made this recipe many times and even get requests for it from the people in my office. It has great flavor and aromas - especially for a cold appetizer. I agree with others' comments that the cumin seed makes the dish. Don't leave it out or substitute ground cumin for it. One of the best things about the Manchego cheese is that it is made from sheep milk, which is easier for lactose-intolerant people to digest.

I presented it differently for my book group. I diced the manchego cheese and red peppers instead, added the remaining ingredients and served with pita chips. I've also used toasted french bread slices and let everyone pile it on. Great for a buffet when you want to present cheese differently.

I was surprised to see only 79% would make again. I have made this three times and will make again for a party this weekend - as written with sharp cheddar - I may try manchego this time. Lots of complements and its an easy make-ahead.

This is a great recipe - we make it every year for Thanksgiving. For flavor the cumin seeds are key, as is the advance prep.

I made these exactly as written and everyone loved them. They're so easy which makes them perfect for a summer evening paired with wine.

I have made this recipe several times. It is always a favorite!! I had never had manchego cheese and am glad I found it -- if you can get it -- that makes all the difference. It is a perfect cheese for this dish. I always use a little more shallot and green onion and olive oil and an extra sprinkle of the cumin seeds. It is such a great appetizer because you can make it the night before. I have found that I need a little more then an hour before serving for the olive oil to go from congealed to a liquid. One thing that I had messed up on that affected my presentation and have now rectified is with the drizzling at the end. When you assemble the cheese slices onto the bread tops, make sure they are not on a the serving platter before you drizzle. After you drizzle over all the assembled bread slices, then move each slice to your serving platter. I have also roasted my own peppers and used various colored peppers and that has added a bit of fun to the presentation of the appetizer. One of my favorite dishes!

I thought the flavors were lackluster. I find that the only ingredients that compete with the strong flavor of the peppers are garlic and parsley(plus a squirt of lemon)and olive oil. I would consider maybe trying sharp, sharp provolone.

Great "make ahead" appetizer. Wonderful flavors! Had never tried Manchego cheese...we loved it! Another "plus" is the impresive presentation!

Wow...this was REALLY good! I had no idea such simple ingredients could make for such a magnificent melding of flavors!! Didn't find the Spanish cheese, so I used a high quality sharp white cheddar (as recipe suggested). Found it to be equally good on the baguette as well as on water crackers. Deeee-lish! Only problem...presentation is tough...not a "pretty" dish, but that's quickly overlooked after the first bite.

Make these! I made for a tapas party I hosted and they were gobbled up! I only got a little taste but everyone loved them...I had my doubts while putting them together but it was EASY and a big success!

Served these on Superbowl Sunday. I personally didn't think these were that amazing, but my guests absolutely loved them. The cumin makes the dish. A very attractive appetizer.

I used sun-dried tomatoes on some of them instead of peppers and they were excellent. You can also serve the cheese without the bread, and it is perfect for those cutting their carbohydrates.

Delicious! The manchego was expensive (I tripled the recipe). My baguette was only 2" long so I could have cut the cheese into 2" slices (not 3" like the recipe says) and done just fine. It was all gone in a flash. Be sure to mince the onions and shallots well, larger pieces of onion wouldn't work as well.

I made this for a large cocktail party and did half white cheddar and half manchego to cut costs and add some variety. My guests loved it, and one of the less-sophisticated males even commented that it reminded him of pizza. Very tasty and pretty presentation.

Loved it - made for a big tapas party in May and it was the first thing to go. People really enjoyed the flavor combination, esp. the cumin. Might try white cheddar next time as Manchego is expensive, but honestly, I think it's worth it and a perfect recipe as is.

I too made this for a party and it vanished. Easy and tasty even if a touch messy. Love manchego cheese. An attractive presentation on a pretty platter.

I made this to bring to a dinner party and it was gone in seconds. I copied the recipe at least 15 times for others. FABULOUS!

An easy and delicious recipe. The Spanish Manchego cheese adds just the right flavor and is now easy to find. What a wonderful addition to the hors d'oeuvre menu!

This was a big hit at my party. I couldn't find a baguette of sour dough, so I bought hoagie style sourdough rolls and sliced them. They were soft, easy to eat, no crumbs. This recipe took a total of 20 minutes to make, excluding time to marinate. Easy and elegant!
