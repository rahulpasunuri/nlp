too much flour, not enough butter. Not classic French brioche (e.g., Julia Child, etc.).

cbadoses part two: I forgot to mention that we didn't use loaf pans. We just used caserole dishes to bake the loaves in. It worked fine. Rose and crisped just the same. Unless you want a perfect shape, then use glass caserole dishes.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed the dough making part almost exactly. I did forget to deflate in the fridge after a while, but it didn't harm the outcome of the bread. I consider this bread a two-day event. It's worth it tho. I'm a home cook and it turned out perfectly. I think once the dough is ready some people just bake it. That's not what I did. I cut the dough into thirds and my hubby and I rolled it out like you would any other dough. I placed sauted mushrooms and motz shredded cheese into mine and rolled it up into a loaf, making sure the seam was face down. My hubby used cheese and ham from our meat market. Then rolled. We baked them just like that. They were so good. We actually made more and gave them as gifts. I've read that some people make french toast or just bread. Once the dough is made it's really forgiving. Great recipe.

WOW WOW WOW!!! What an incredible recipe! I made 1/2 the batch without the overnight chilling (I was too impatient) it turned out good but definitely had better rise from the 2nd batch that that got chilled overnight. So don't skip that step! It's totally worth it. I also sprinkled sesame seeds on top since I was using it for some stuffed turkey burgers. This is everything you can want and more in a bun. THIS IS AMAZING!

Made this exactly according to the recipe. It's excellent. Made great French toast on day two!

This WAS quite easy. My mixer struggled a little. The dough was very wet. During the second rise, I didn't have time to punch it down every half hour for two hours - only one hour. I plaited it as per http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcPnB0Sgc-Q - I needed a lot of flour to roll it out because the dough was so sticky. I let it bake for 35 minutes. On the first day it was very soft and difficult to slice but became firmer by day 2.

This is a wonderful and pretty foolproof recipe. Just like cooking school. The instructions make brioche nanterre, but I made the dough into a tete and sucre (with and without chocolate chips). Delightful! I'm making it again tonight for tomorrow morning!

I would like to try making this but is it possible to braid into one loaf rather than divide up into 12 logs and put into loaf pans? Any advice would be appreciated!

This is a wonderful albeit sticky brioche recipe. This gives a perfect crumb and wonderful crisp exterior. Best Brioche I have had since Paris.

I've made this recipe many times since it was published in BA and it is versatile and foolproof if you adhere to the ingredients as outlined and allow the mixer to knead it to the right consistency. I've made it in the mini loaf pans, as rolls, and as kugelhopf, by adding craisins or chopped dried apricot and baking it in a kugelhopf pan. Always very good. It fills the house with the distinctive smell of the baking brioche that I remember as a child wathching my French grandmother painstakiingly kneading the dough after each addition of butter and then removing the golden braided bread from the oven.

In answer to the last reviewer's question, I believe it's just four log-like strips, laid diagonally across the bottom of the pan. As they cook and rise, they meld together to make one loaf that is sort of wavy on top. The one and only time I've seen brioche bread made, that's how it looked at the end. I hope to try this recipe out myself shortly and will find out if I've understood it correctly. :)

Have't tried this yet; it sounds like a good recipe. My question is, what do they mean by laying the dough strips crosswise in a loaf pan? Surely it's not lattice-style? I can't picture this. Other brioche recipes usually call for either a brioche mold or a la nanterre, usually six equal size balls placed side by side in a loaf pan (kind of like pull-apart rolls). Can anyone describe how they did this? Thanks

After reading the reviews, I so wanted to make this recipe. My one month of living at the Island Shangri-La in Hong Kong 7 years ago gave me a real taste for brioche rolls, which I used to have every morning with jam and tea. Alas, I was so disappointed with my heavy and crumb-y final product, which also tasted more salty than anything despite my using unsalted butter. I have not given up on this recipe, though, and will try again (after I invest in more butter!). Compared to other brioche recipes I've looked at, this is by far the easiest. Perhaps, I need to force the rise more with the warm oven method and cut back on the salt. The good news is instead of tossing the failed bread, I've made it into an Apple Raisin Bread Pudding.

I don't have a food processor, but would really like to make this recipe, since it really sounds great. I am willing to put it the extra time and elbow grease if need be, I just don't know if I should knead it, or... ANY help is appreciated--please email at LilacBelle17@comcast.net

WOW!!! What a lot of Butter! I guess I've never had brioche before because I expected it to be light and airy. Instead mine was dense, moist with a heavy crumb. It rose beautifully, but didn't rise more during baking - was it supposed to? I served it in bread basket with a homemade Challah and a Heavy Beef Dinner. I think breakfast with jam would have been a much better use of the brioch . I will definitely make this for my next bruch and use my Challah for the french toast:)

I am about to try this, but noted it makes 3 loaves. Has anyone frozen this, and how has it worked? I assume you've frozen the final product. Also, what is a brioche pan? I noted one reviewer was going to use that next time. Thanks for any help.

This recipe is proof that Our Creator loves us. I gave 2 loves away to friends accompanied with fresh butter, Trader Joe's cherry preserves, a stick of good butter, and a bag of good coffee. If you are feeling really generous add some champagne and OJ for a nice eyeopener

This is a wonderful recipe. I make bread every day, and generally cut the yeast down by at least half in any recipe. I live at altitude, (4000 ft) and so we don't need nearly as much yeast. I used a teaspoon of yeast (SAF Gold) and it came out beautifully. That may cut down the "yeasty" taste as commented on by a previous reviewer.

Oh. My. God. This is fabulous, and relatively easy to make. Loved the idea of making into rolls. Will do next time. Ditto comments from New Mexico--how many rolls does this produce? I assume you can make them freeform.

This is a question to some of the cooks who made this recipe as rolls. How many rolls did you make out of it, and did you use muffin tins or place a certain amout of dough on a cookie sheet? I hope someone will respond. Thank you.

Had a hard time getting it to rise to the top of the loaf pan. Decided my house was too cold at 65 degrees so I cranked up the heat and set it near a vent. Did rise then but not as high as I expected. Just checked Red Star Yeast web site and they said "Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap or foil and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free location. The oven is an ideal place for this. For an electric oven or a gas oven with electronic ignition, heat the oven at the lowest setting for one minute, then turn off. In other gas ovens, the pilot light will provide enough warmth. Place a pan of very warm water toward the back of the oven to provide moisture. Place the bowl or pan of dough on the center rack and close the door." Will try this oven rising method to see if I can get more height.

It is the easiest brioche I have made. The texture was perfect. I would have given it four forks except for the slightly yeasty taste remaining in my mouth. I would make it again and do it in the traditional brioche mold.

The recipe was a bit tricky but well worth the effort. The dough never seemed to rise very much and certainly never doubled as described. I took a chance and baked it anyways and it rose quite nicely in the oven. Tasted great! But I almost dumped it in the trash before cooking because I expected it to rise much more.

It was delicious! It makes incredible grilled cheese sandwiches and toast. The loaves have so much butter in them, there's no need to butter the outside.

The bread was easy to make and delicious. I accidently burn the bottom of one of the loaves, so we just ate the top.I think next time I will make rolls like the previous reviewer. I normally do not bake, so I'm not sure if you could stuff this dough with fruits. Any one have any suggestions?

Took the suggestion and made these as rolls. They were wonderful. Will certainly make again and again. By the way, it wasn't that long ago you could look to a recipe's reviews for suggestions on adapting the recipe, suggested improvements, etc. Nowadays the reviews have taken on more of a chat room feel. I'm sorry to see that happen.

I made this recipe and shaped it into small dinner rolls for a luncheon that I had a few weeks ago. Everyone thought that they were delicious. I am making them again this weekend for my husband's birthday party. I have not tried it as loaves but I'm sure it would be delicious also.

To cook from Boston: Sponge phase is not necessary for this bread. Added rise time will give flavor, but even that can be altered. Use sponges for doughs that don't contain eggs or fats. They need the fermentation for flavor and texture.

I think this is too much yeast. One and a half envelopes would be more than enough. I would also prefer it with about 1/4 cup sugar.
