Just wanted to add - I used Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste, as I had no green curry paste on hand. Must remember to try it with the green paste next time, though I suspect it will not taste much different. Make a trip to the Asian market and pick up the Mae Ploy brand. It's the best. Also Tiparos brand fish sauce gets my recommendation.

MAJOR WOW! I made this recipe as written. No need to change it. Pooh on the peeps that don't want to do the deep frying step. It didn't take that long, didn't make too much mess, and it was a fabulous plus to this terrific recipe! The spicy sauce on the crunch of the chicken is superb! It would be goos on stir fried chicken or broiled fish, too, but don't short change yourself! The tempura is light and delectable. Great recipe that got 4 thumbs up from my family of 4. Do it!

Nice flavor, and easy enough to prepare with a few modifications. I found the puree step unnecessary, and I like the texture and flavor of whole spinach and basil leaves. I also found it quite easy to skip the egg batter step. I marinate the sliced chicken as directed, and then cook it in the coconut sauce for 10- 12 minutes before adding the spinach and basil. Julienned carrots are also a nice addition. And finally, I found 1 Tbsp of curry paste to be plenty for flavor and a nice, medium heat.

My whole family enjoyed this a lot! I will definitely make it again. I added a can of bamboo shoots to the sauce at the last minute. The sauce would be great with shrimp too.

Not nearly spicy enough. Watered down & not flavorful enough. I was pretty disappointed with this. :( Didn't stir-fry the chicken, I just boiled it with the curry.

Rating: 3
I thought this was great, but I made some changes. I didn't do the whole frying process. I marinated the chicken as recommended, and then just stir fried it with garlic, onion and ginger. I also added some shrimp. After cooking the above, I took it out of the pan, made the sauce as they say, and then added vegetables -- I had asparagus, carrots, and mushrooms, plus a bag of frozen spinach in the house. After they were mostly cooked, I added the shrimp & chicken back in and it was terrific. I didn't have basil in the house, BTW, but it still tasted great, and I did cut the curry in half, which was perfect! I also added juice from 1 lime.

Since I changed this up substantively, I'm not giving out forks, but in my opinion this recipe gets the sauce right. It calls for brown sugar, and enough of it, and in just the right proportion to the salty fish sauce. Most recipes for curry I've tried at home aren't as sweet as Thai take out. If you're looking to replicate Thai green curry take out try this recipe!

I loved this recipe. I also just stir fried my chicken until half done, set aside. I then did the sauce, added the spinach and basil (chopped) for 2 minutes, then added the chicken and let simmer for 10-12 minutes. We loved this recipe and will repeat many many times.

I honestly would never make this again. My husband loves green curry, and he also likes spinach . . . I thought that I'd be able to use a package of spinach that I had on hand while making his favorite dish. Yes, the spinach makes a pretty green color, but it completely overpowers the flavor of the green curry. It ends up tasting not quite enough like green curry (too watered down) and not quite enough like tasty spinach to taste like much of anything. It doesn't come together at all. We ate it, once, but couldn't bear to eat the leftovers which I had to throw away. I'm still on the lookout for the perfect green curry recipe!

Good but not great. THis recipe didn't have the rich spiciness that I was looking for.

Absolutely fantastic. I realize the changes I made, mean I'm not actually reviewing *this* exact recipe, but it met with such rave reviews that I'm now queen-cook-of-the- block-party, so I wanted to share! I did NOT batter & fry the chicken...I grilled it outdoors instead. Much healthier and the combined flavors were amazing. The neighbors are still talking about this one. I'd say make extra of this amazing sauce. I had extra and used it on some grilled tilapia the next day.

Rating: 4
This is great. Everyone I have ever made this for absoli\utely raves about it. I do cook the chicken without the batter and just stir-fry it untl done (every effort to increase the health factor is great), I also have used both low fat and regular coconut milk and both are devine. as for the person that says it has too much basil flavor....have you ever had much Thai or Thai inspired dishes? This is perfcet.

Rating: 1
Very disappointed. I followed the recipe very closely, though I did prepare the chicken separately as a stir-fry. The curry itself has an overwhelming basil flavor, with little other flavor.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, but I left out the spinach, as well, and added lots of fun stuff (bamboo shoots, baby corn, etc), and pan-seared the chicken too. Next time I'll definitely add the recommended amount of curry paste- I was a bit timid this time through.

When I was living in NYC, Rain was one of my favorite restaurants. I was lucky enough to have this dish several times at the restaurant. I've been making this dish at home for special dinners since I found it published in Bon Appetit and everyone I've ever made it for loves it! The green color from the spinach and basil are vibrant and beautiful. I follow the recipe exactly and like serving it with Thai sticky rice.

Rating: 3
I didn't quite make it as written- did the stir fry method suggested by one reviewer, reduced the green chili to 1.5 T, used less coconut milk and left out the spinach. I added in veggies and garlic. It was tasty, and my family ate it up. I think I will make this again but add lemon grass, more coconut milk, maybe some lime leaves if (I can get them). I liked this because it was an easy way to make one of our favorite Thai (style) dishes.

Rating: 4
My first attempt at cooking Thai...I was sure it wouldn't taste authentic, but it did! Yum. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow! I heeded several reviewers recommendations and sauted the chicken. To reduce the greeness, I really squeezed roughly chopped cooked spinach. I added baby corn and bamboo shoots and reduced the green curry to 1-1/2 TBSP. There was still definately a kick! Next time I may add a few sliced mushrooms and scallions. My man told me that his Thai buddy would definately approve of this dish!

I have made this recipe at lease 10 times and everyone I've made it for loves it!! I do not fry the chicken, just marinade it in fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and black pepper and stir fry it with red peppers and snow peas. Also I don't use the food processor, I just chop up the spinach and basil and add it to the sauce. Food processor seems like unnecessary work to me. The recipe is VERY spicy if you use 3T of green curry so I cut it down to about 1.5T. We love spicy and it was almost inedible with 3T of curry. This is exellent served w/ brown rice, cous cous, or glass noodles. Enjoy!!

Wonderful taste!!! Dish is interesting to look at. Very green.

I would skip the breading and frying of the chicken. It was heavy and not very good. The sauce was excellent though and I made it again over cooked chicken and rice. Excellent!

Instead of using fish sauce, marinade with a white wine. I used pino grigio, and the smell when you sautee is AMAZING. The sauce was a bit thin, so I added corn starch.

If you are looking for a green curry chicken recipe like the kind you might find in a Thai restaurant, this is not it. The sauce is more the color and texture of baby food than curry and was okay in taste.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe for green chicken curry. Although unhealthy, frying the chicken really makes it that much better and unique. It's a step that should not be skipped. A couple of modifications made this great. I used two T. of green curry paste, which provided the perfect amount of heat. I used 1 can of coconut milk which is just under 2 cups. I only added 1 T. of brown sugar and added a T. of fresh lime juice. The spinach/basil puree sounded strange to me, but I followed that step, and it made the sauce all that much better. Make this dish... it's great!

Rating: 3
a really great recipe. i used the thai kitchen curry paste, and just from past experience knew that it is *really* spicy, so i only used 1tsp, not even a tablespoon. it was spicy enough for me - i dont actually think it needed to be too much spicier.... but anyway, it's a great recipe as is - and a great recipe to expand on, whether it's by adding ginger, scallions, lemongrass, or whatever else you feel like....

Rating: 3
It was a very delicious Thai Recipe. Unfortunately, I did not read the recipe carefully and didn't realize that I had to marinate the chicken breasts for an hour. I was able to recover though and made a delicious dish. I would have to say that 3 tablespoons of the curry paste is too much. It was VERY spicy. I could ate very little of the sauce b/c it was very spicy. Otherwise, it was very good.

Rating: 3
Very delicious... 3-1/2 stars. My husband and I agree that frying the chicken adds a great dimension, but it makes so many dirty dishes that it loses a 1/2 star for the clean-up! I marinated the chicken overnight, and added a little ginger to it. We LOVED the sauce (added a little extra broth for consistency). Will try making again without frying, but suspect it won't be as good.

Rating: 3
A bit unorthodox, but Thai-tasty. I minced a stalk of lemongrass to put in the marinade--in retrospect, I might have dropped some in the sauce too. Watch the curry! 3 tablespoons is five-alarm excessive! I think a little over one tbsp. is right for this size portion.

Rating: 4
I love this dish, and I've been asked for the recipe by everyone who tasted. It makes more sauce compair to the amount of chicken, so I cook twice as much chicken. Also, it is very hot, so I use a bit more than a table spoon of curry paste. I made this so many times that I've almost memorized the recipe.

Rating: 2
This tasted pretty good, but it was hard to get past how green the dish is. It is really, really green. Also, if I make this again, I will reduce the amount of fish sauce (nam plah -- forgive my spelling) which was a little overwhelming for my taste.

Not very exciting - rather on the bland side! I followed the recipe exactly and while the chicken was good, the sauce was disappointing - not much flavor or spice.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish several times and it is great every time. Beware, though, the longer the sauce sits, the spicier it becomes. I usually test it right before serving and add extra chicken broth to lessen the spice if needed. Also, make sure you coat and flour the chicken instead of just grilling or baking, it really adds to the dish.

Yum! Careful with the curry paste if you can't handle the spice. we did the full tablespoon and it kinda burned our lips a little bit. but yum yum yum- and the deep frying the chicken adds a great crunch and flavor!

Shockingly green and very, very tasty. Like other reviewers I didn't batter and fry the chicken but rather baked it for 30 minutes then sliced into pieces.

My second attempt with this recipe resulted in a restaurant-quality meal. Stirfry the marinated chicken, omitting the battering and deepfrying steps. Reduce the golden brown sugar to 2 TBS. Omit the spinach. Instead, use cubed potatoes (microwaved for 4 minutes) and carrots. Add the stirfryed chicken, cubed potatoes, and carrots to the curry sauce and simmer for 15 minutes. Add chopped sweet Thai basil to the pot, before serving. Happy cooking!

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I only made about half of the spinach/basil puree and it was still great. I also added a diced red bell pepper, snap peas and I sauteed the chicken rather than the suggested method. Next time I would cut back on the coconut milk.. it was a little bit too thick would thin it out with a little chicken broth perhaps?? Very, very good though.. must try!

Wonderful Curry! Used 2 tbsp of Taste of Thai green curry paste which was perfect heat for us. Served with Thai beer. Just sauteed chicken pieces in oil/marinade mixture instead of suggested method. Made ahead, combined all elements and re-heated beautifully in oven. Quite nice.

Wonderful sauce! I used about 1T Thai green curry paste leftover in a jar and I would have liked slightly more heat, maybe 1.5 T. Also, I messed up on frying the chicken by not using enough oil and the pieces stuck to the bottom of the pan and made a mess. But it was still delicious; and I've got some leftover sauce that i think I'll use with some steamed mussels.

Rating: 4
Amazing! I just sauteed the chicken in a little peanut oil and added some red bell peppers and carrots. I reduced the amount of curry paste to 2TBS, and it was still pretty hot. I think I'll cut back even more next time. Tasted restaurant grade!

This stuff is HOT! I've had Thai curry before a couple of times in restaurants but I always asked them to make it less spicy than standard. I used the three tbsp of curry called for in the recipe, and discovered at the last minute that I didn't have spinach, so I skipped that, the fish sauce (too expensive) and the basil. I added pineapple bits at the last moment. The flavour was great, but next time I will use less curry paste. My guests and I were crying and sniffing as we ate. We actually brought a box of tissue to the table.

i made this dish a lot of times already, but i did not follow the recipe as it is. i skipped the frying of the chicken, and also skipped the spinach and basil part (making my curry red not green) - but it's really the best i've had so far. added potatoes and carrots to make the dish more palatable.

I would definitely make this recipe over and over again! I was a little worried that my husband would question the green color, but there were no problems (I am a green curry fan). One thing, though- I let the sauce reduce more than the recipe called for, to make it a little thicker. Can't wait to make this again!

Hi everyone! I thought this recipe was great! A nice change from the ordinary. One thing I would do differently next time would be just to grill the chicken instead of deep frying. Also I would make the sauce a touch thicker by using only one can of coconut milk. But overall the sauce had a great flavour.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious! I used Mae Ploy brand green curry paste and skipped the fish sauce. Also, I poached the chicken (cut up into chunks) in the chicken broth that I later used in the sauce. This keeps the calories down. The dish was spicy, yet the brown sugar created a really enjoyable balance. I couldn't stay away from the leftovers. I took this dish to a pot luck, with white rice, and it was unofficially rated the best of the evening. I can't wait to make it again.

Rating: 3
Great dish with lots of flavour. Used less brown sugar and didn't have basil. Also added baby corn, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots for a bit of texture relief. One of our guests was a huge fan of green curry, and it worked for him, so it works for me!

We've made this recipe twice now. With a couple of minor modifications we think its terrific. We used Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste and its too spicy (and we like spicy) with the 3 T the recipe calls for if you use this curry paste. We cut down to 1.5 T and it was great. We also found the recipe too sweet if you use the full 1/4 C. of brown sugar. The second time we made it we used 2 T. A 14 oz. can of coconut milk is fine. And firm tofu works great, maybe it improves the presentation others didn't like. Also, recipe is still great if its the middle of winter and you can't add the fresh basil leaves.

They should have named this "VERY Green Curry Chicken"... the blanched spinach and basil puree makes the sauce very bright green... a different presentation, to be sure. My wife was put off by the sight of it, but it actually very tasty.

Excellent! The Basil-Spinach combination adds a delightful twist to curry; it's very well balanced. I used "Mida's" brand hot (tasted mild) curry paste and I ended up adding extra 1 Tbsp. I made extra batter & fried some carrots & brocolli along with chicken. Scrumptious!

Had a too sweet & surprisingly nondescript taste that did not win anybody over. Also, I usually don't agree when other reviewers complain about the look of a dish, but this looked foul. So much better curry dishes on this site.Try the grilled salmon with Thai curry sauce-it's great over chicken too.

Thanks for the suggestion to cut down on the curry. We love spicy food and even with 2 Tab., it was still extremely spicy. I added green and red pepper and onion, which was nice. Loved the basil/spinach puree. Don't be concerned about the bright green color. It tastes great! Also stir fried the chicken to make it a healthier dish.

This was a wonderful curry sauce - the best I've ever had! I made this as a vegetarian curry for a dinner club meeting and everyone loved it - even several children who were present. I made the following changes: omitted the fish sauce and substituted vegetable broth for the chicken stock, and cut back on the spinach a bit. Also, the amount of green curry paste called for made the dish far too spicy, though and I ended up adding more coconut milk and broth to tone it down (I used Thai Kitchen brand green curry paste). For the vegetables, I stir fried onions, green & red bell peppers, broccoli, sliced carrots, baby bok choy, and cubes of japanese eggplant. It was delicious and spicy!

This is a good recipe, but definitely needs salt. The final taste is sweet hot, but there is a brightness lacking in the flavor that salt helped a little. This recipe is a little time-consuming, but it was fun to make, and I didn't find the color off-putting at all.

Very good. Don't omit the spinach. To the cook from Tallahassee: the colour is hardly "disturbing;" perhaps it was your "canned assorted Oriental vegetables" that made the dish so yucky for you....

My best friend made this and it was the BEST dinner I have ever had. She omitted the spinach, and doubled the basil. She also added Wondra flour to the sauce to thicken it a bit, and she used whole chicken breasts instead of tenders, cooking the breasts for 15 minutes in a deep fryer. I'm going to make this again and again and again!

A delicious recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and I thought the color of the sauce was just beautiful. It was a vibrant green. The marinade for the chicken worked wonders, tender, juicy and flavorful pieces. Make sure you serve immediately after frying, to avoid any undue sogginess of the chicken.

Rating: 1
The color of this dish is so disturbing-- if you have any qualms about eating something that looks like seaweed, LEAVE OUT THE SPINACH AND BASIL PUREE! Other than the color, the basil adds an odd taste. The recipe itself is not so bad (adding canned assorted Oriental vegetables was good), but I couldn't get past the color-- could not bring myself to eat the leftovers. Overall, yuck.

I used 1 tbsp of a Tibetan fire sauce in place of the Thai curry and used 1 cup of sour cream and one cup coconut milk. My family devoured it in no time flat. Also do not omit the spinach it not only adds color and the proper texture but also soaks up the sauce to distribute the flavors more evenly.

Made this dish last night and concur with the NY cook that I should have left out the spinach. As soon as I added the spinach, I began to worry what it would do to the flavor. To our surprise, the curry was quite flavorful and HOT!. I added bamboo shoots, baby corn and carrots. Nam pla was a big hit, yet my wife and I still don't know what the spinach was for other than color. Next time, will do without the spinach and use only 1 1/2 TBs of Curry Paste. I didn't deep-fry the chicken either.
