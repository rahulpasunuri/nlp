This was delicious! Served the steak with a gyoza dipping sauce that I ha on hand and a red cabbage coriander scallion slaw - so so yummy!

I thought it was fantastic. The dipping sauce too. Though I did use brown rice vinegar rather than black.

Thought it was great - agreed forget the dipping sauce - but marinade was fantastic - cooked quickly on grill just like a regular kabob - added some onion slices and bok choy - basted with marinate mixed with sweeter coco lopez which carmelized on the grill - turned out fantastic over rice

So, yes, the dipping sauce is awful. It just tasted like liquid salt, don't even bother with it. But the marinade was delicious - I can't wait to try it on other things! The steak itself was very good, I don't think I've ever managed to get steak to absorb so much flavor. Served with jasmine rice and cucumber salad. Great easy dinner!

Do not waste your time or money. Awful. On paper it looks great. The marinade turns the meat to mush and the "low and slow" cooking method recommended by the magazine renders the meat to an almost unpalatable, sponge-like consistency. The dipping sauce was good, a little salty. If you feel like putting 2 LBS of otherwise delicious beef down the disposal, feel free to give this a shot.
