This is my favorite focaccia recipe! I don't use as much flour as the recipe calls for and I usually use half bread flour and half whole wheat flour from my grinder. I especially love this with the "Four Cheese Focaccia" toppings from this website. Excellent!

This recipe didn't turn out for me - I tried the cracked black pepper with truffle oil focaccia recipe from this site and it turned out perfectly.

I actually watched a friend make this for dinner and I can't wait to try my hand at it. It was nice and soft and had a nice spongy texture. YUM! I liked it so much, I had it for breakfast the next morning.
