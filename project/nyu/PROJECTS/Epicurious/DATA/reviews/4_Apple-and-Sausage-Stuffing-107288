This recipe has been such a huge success at home that I recently made it for our office Thanksgiving pitch-in. Through trial and error, I've come up with a few substitutions. I double the amount of fresh sage to 4 teaspoons. I use a 50/50 combination of Bob Evans 'Hot' and 'Savory Sage' Pork Sausage. I use Pepperidge Farm White Enriched Sandwich Bread instead of French bread. It comes in a one pound loaf so no measuring is necessary. I ran out of white onion this time, so I used red. And I use salted butter instead of unsalted. I highly recommend you sprinkle some salt on the vegetables as you sauté them, to sweat them down a little. Also I use a 50/50 mixture of Granny Smith and Honey Crisp apples. Granny smith gives it a nice tart flavor and they hold up well in the cooking process. Honey Crisp brings a nice sweetness, and softens and adheres to the bread. I always make the meat mixture the day before and let the flavors meld in the refrigerator overnight. One note on the mixing of the milk, broth and melted butter. You'll have better success if you gently heat them to about 200 degrees for about 15 minutes. That will bring out the sweetness in the milk reinforcing the apple even more. Also if you try to mix it cold as the recipe implies you'll find the butter instantly coagulates and forms large curds. For the final seasoning I use 1 tsp of salt and ½ tsp of pepper. I doubled the recipe for the pitch-in and it yielded exactly 7 quarts of finished product. Since management was providing the main entrees for this pitch-in, I felt this dish would just fade into the background unnoticed. Boy was I wrong. After the dinner people were asking who made it, and they were amazed that they never really liked stuffing until they tried this recipe. Several went back for seconds and thirds easily wiping out the seven quarts.

Made this two years in a row now for Thanksgiving, and it's a hit. I used very stale sourdough bread, I think it helps keep the texture light. It's a keeper.

Sooooo blah. I had high hopes based on these reviews, but I didn't care for this at all. It was so bland that I didn't even bother saving the leftovers.

This is the second thanksgiving I made this stuffing, and my family just goes crazy for it. I followed it exactly as is, and it is easy and absolutely delicious. The tartness of the apples and spicy sausage combined with the other flavors blends perfectly together. It is moist and delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

This was a hit. I brought it to a Thanksgiving potluck. Half the people in attendance were vegetarians and this stuffing was still obliterated within 15 minutes. I knew from the other reviewers that this stuffing can get a little dry, so I added a little apple cider to it before baking. Since I had that bit of extra liquid, I was able to crank up the heat to 425 after 50 min. and bake it a perfect, crisp. Yum. Next time I might break the bank and get some non-generic sausage.

This was fabu and not just for T-day. I can't wait to make it with some hearty winter meat dish. Made with no changes....it is indeed more bread pudding than stuffing which is a relief!!! Tired of stuffing. Anywho, have had requests from friends to make it special for them.

This was OK. It wasn't terribly flavorful, I thought it sounded much better than it turned out to be. Maybe the sausage we used was lacking, but it came out a little dry and the proportion of bread to other ingredients was too far tipped towards bread. I'd give it another shot upping the apples, celery, herbs and sausage and lessening the bread.

Excellent using sausage or thick-cut bacon. Easy to make while the turkey is cooking. I cube pre-packaged sliced French bread, and I love the moist, tender result. 4 years in a row now...will search no more.

So delicious! My family loved it. It would also be great as a main dish for Christmas morning. I'll make it every year for sure!!

made this just last night alongside a giant chicken from our neighbor farmers. Everyone loved it. I had started with my mother's recipe, but because we had a surplus of apples, looked up apple stuffing. I added one pound of sliced mushrooms, as per mom, and was out of broth so used apple cider for the other liquid. I can't wait for the leftovers tonight. This will be my stuffing forever (with my 2 changes).

Every Thanksgiving the family calls to make sure that we're having THE STUFFING again! I make only one change to the original recipe and that is to use Sourdough bread in place of French bread for the tang that the Sourdough brings. Well, that and I always make double what I need for the number of guests, because everyone wants "stuffing bowls" for the next few days!

Made this stuffing recipe last thanksgiving. There were several other stuffings present, including a nice cornbread stuffing. This one trumped them all. It's practically a main dish. Very filling and went perfectly with the turkey. Using some very nice italian sausage, it was absolutely savory and delicious, and the texture was really good. Try it, it'll be a hit!

This is my favorite apple and sausage stuffing recipe. It's simple, savory and delicious! I like using a more tart apple like a granny smith, but some people like a sweeter apple instead. Either way, it's always one of the celebrities on my Thanksgiving table and people request it year after year!

Delicious. I've made a similar stuffing for years without the custard. The addition of custard took it too the next level. Like other reviewers I adjusted proportions based on my tastes, adding more sage and bay, using 1% milk, and a good crusty whole grain bread.

I believe I'm on my 10th year of making this recipe (or some slight variation) for my family's Thanksgiving dinner. This year I added pecans instead of chestnuts and tripled the amount of granny smith apples that I typically use. Perfection. The apples gave it a kick to offset the spicy sausage and the pecans added texture. I also cover with foil for 1/2 the time to keep the top from burning.

This was delicious! I used skim milk instead of whole, and substituted egg whites for the eggs. I couldn't tell the difference. It was delicious, I will definitely make this again.

Great stuffing...last Thanksgiving I followed the recipe and my guests loved it. This year I used pear instead of apple and added toasted inenuts. Also used a muffin tin for stuffin muffins. Turned out wonderful!!

Wonderful recipe; made it 4 times. Used a different oven (I moved) the last time, and it was not as good; not sure why. The quality of the sausage is important.

This is a great stuffing recipe. I used it to stuff a pork loin and used sweet italian sausage instead of spicey which worked very well with the pork. Next time I would use white bread instead of french. Will make it again

I loved this recipe, so did my family. I substituted white bread toast for the french bread so it wouldn't be so heavy and added a few more apples. I will definately make it again!

My sister and I both made this recipe this past Thanksgiving and we both agree it is the best we ever made! I used half & half instead of milk, and I used a combination of french bread and sour dough bread. Fabulous!

Great dish. Easy to make and can be made ahead. Had someone who won't eat pork so made this with spicy turkey sausage and it worked fine. I added a little oil to saute the vegies.

If you're looking for the perfect stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving, this is the ONE! Have made it for the last few years, and it disappears with rave reviews. Use homemade sausage from your local butcher.

I've been reluctant to rate this because I hate the way most pigs are raised nowadays. But if you can get "cruelty free" pork sausage, I highly recommend this recipe. Really the best stuffing I've ever had.

Followed directions as stated, and it came out very nice, and very flavorful too!! My somewhat picky teen agreed with me that it was awesome. My neighbor took leftovers and liked it also! Went well with the green beans and pork chops I baked. Using ones imagination, you could really take this to new places, if you like.

I tried this (since I had sausage on hand) to jazz up my bread stuffing on Thanksgiving - to rave reviews - I will make it again because my family has already told me that I have to, they loved it!!! This was the only dish to disappear completely - no leftovers!

This stuffing lacked flavor. I was encouraged by the positive reviews but the stuffing was very disappointing. I made it as is with the addition of extra chicken stock because it was dry. Luckily, I also made the herb stuffing which we really enjoyed.

This was a hit among my Thanksgiving dinner guests; it's very flavorful. I personally found it a little heavy and dense, so it's not my favorite stuffing ever. We always make more than one kind of stuffing, however, so I would make it again to please others!

This is an absolutely delicious stuffing recipe!!! The only reason I did not give it four forks is simply because it is, after all, 'stuffing' :). My guests were asking for the recipe as they were eating it! And, my husband asked me to make some more a few days later! When I said I didn't have all the ingredients he suggested we have the items on hand at all times :) I will have to admit that I added more liquid after it had cooked. Unlike some reviewers, I did not find it pudding-like and therefore added more broth. DELICIOUS!

This stuffing recipe is destined to become a classic at my family's Thanksgiving table. My mother baked it outside of the bird and it was a perfect accompaniment to our delicious dinner.

This was the most amazing stuffing I have ever had. If you don't end of using this recipe you have to at least use the fresh french bread loaf that it recommends. I let my bread cubes sit out for about a day prior to making this. One french bread loaf makes 8 cups of bread cubes (the recipe does not clearly indicate this). The sausage and apple went quite well together. We served this with the molasses brined turkey with gingersnap gravy. This may have to be a new stuffing tradition!

I am usually not a fan of stuffing, but this recipe is delicious! I also liked the fact the sausage mixture could be made the day ahead to save time. I served it last year for Thanksgiving and will be making it again this year. Can't wait to taste it again!!

As written the recipe is good, but far more bread than anything else. My out of town relatives loved the original. However, my family prefered the revised version. I doubled the meat and seasonings and added cloves and a little nutmeg and little cayenne. It needed a little more broth for both versions and I used mild sausage. The revised version's taste, not texture, reminded my husband of the pork pie his mom served with xmas turkey dinners in Quebec. For a more stuffing texture, I'll use 1 1/2 lbs. of sausage in the future.

Like everyone else, receipe was a total success! I agree Granny Smith all the way and more broth. I actually used an extra tablespoon of sage to give it more of a "kick" I also added some poultry seasoning and some pecans..hhmmm good!

A fairly taasty stuffing. I like the sausage and spicy is a must. I might try copping the apples opposed to dicing next time. I wanted more flavor. I used golden delicious but may have had more flavor with a granny smith. Making bread cubes is a must, but was kind of a pain. Does anyone know if I can cut the cubes fresh and then let them get day old?

Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it. The spicy sausage adds a nice "kick" to it. I agree with the previous reviewer, next time I make it I would either add a bit of stock to moisten the bread a bit, or cut down on the amount of bread used.

Test drove this last week. I made it with sweet sausage (no spicy on hand). Used Granny Smith and cut small dice and some rough chunks for variety. Used own chicken stock instead of broth. Wife and I both liked it, but I feel that it was a little bland with the sweet sausage. Plan to make for Thanksgiving and have already bought the hot sausage so I think the seasoning should be great! Also bought braeburn apples this time. Try this one!
