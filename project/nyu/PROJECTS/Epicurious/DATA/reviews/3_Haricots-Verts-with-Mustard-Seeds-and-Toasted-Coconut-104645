While this dish was great, I do agree with the other reviewers with regard to the mustard seeds. I would recommend sprinkling them over the beans once cooked and perhaps increase the amount. I used toasted sweetened coconut rather than unsweetened and it offered a nice balance of sweet/savory when paired with the scallops as recommended.

This was just ok. I couldn't taste the mustard seeds at all, although I added more than the recipe calls for.

I made these for a summer party along side lamb kabobs and the lemon herbed couscous from this site. A simple a very tasty way to serve green beans. Next time I will use a bit more mustard seed.

Sweet green bean recipe! I made it with sweetened coconut to accompany the scallops in acorn squash and the whole meal got great reviews. The green beans would be a perfect vegetable for a variety of entrees.
