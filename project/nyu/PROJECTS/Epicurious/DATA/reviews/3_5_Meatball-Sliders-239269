Pretty much followed the recipe with the exceptions; used no-fat milk and 96% lean beef. Ground pork was the same. Then baked the meatballs on a parchment paper covered cookie sheet at 400 for 7min, flipped them over and baked them for another 7min. For the sauce added one diced small green pepper. Didn't have whole canned tomatoes on hand so used one can of kitchen ready and one can puree and a cup of beef stock. Simmered the sauce for 15 min before adding in the meatballs. It was delicious!!! Great recipe! Happy New Year!!!

I just made this dish for dinner tonight, and couldn't resist sneaking one ahead of time. Delicious! My kids are going to love them. I did add an extra egg to the meatballs, I had a little more meat than was called for. I halved a few of the meatballs to make smaller ones to keep separate from the sauce for my no sauce eater. I accidentally added 1 Tbsp sugar to the sauce, but it is still delicous, not too sweet. I did spice it up a bit with dried basil and oregano.

Basic recipe has too high a bread crumb to meat ratio. My grandmother, a professional chef in Italy, who never cooked from a recipe or, measured ingredients other than by sight; used 3-4 pounds of meat in about a two to one ratio of beef to pork. I also increased garlic to six cloves, and increased parsley to 3/4 to one cup. My grandmother always used lots of eggs; I used five eggs in making this recipe. She always said you cannot hurt meatballs or pasta with more eggs. She also used equal amounts of parmesan and romano. Since she was Roman, she never used oregano, which is a spice used more prominently in southern Italy and Sicily. Everyone raved about the results!

I made this for my kids' birthday party last year when they turned 2 and 4. Now they are turning 3 and 5, and they have requested this again. I followed the receipe exactly and the meatballs and sauce turned out perfectly. I'll probably be making this as their birthday dinner well into their teens!

I made the recipe without the tomato sauce. I also smashed down the meatballs so they resembled little hamburgers. It was a hit with the kid. I really enjoyed the flavor of the meatball with the Pecorino Romano.

Reduce the size of the meatballs and don't over stir while cooking. Truely "stir occaisionally" and you will get meatballs and not meat sauce.

It took way longer than 4-6 minutes to cook these through. I added them to the sauce to finish cooking, and when I was done, I had a pot of meat sauce with just a few meatballs intact. Sure would like to know how to hold them together.

These were the perfect dinner option for my three boys and their friend who was sleeping over. Served these along with onion rings. They aslo freeze well and were easily reheated in athe zip lock freezer bag and boiling water.

Very very good! My family loves meatball sandwiches and meatballs on pizza so I've been looking for a good recipe. The meatballs are good with no sauce at all but simmered in sauce they're excellent! I added more herbs and garlic to the sauce because that's the way my family likes it.
