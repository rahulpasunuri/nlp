Given my love of pumpkin I really tried to like these, but in the end they're just not that good. I tried adding cinnamon and a bit of allspice in addition to the nutmeg and I browned them in butter and sage but the end result really didn't have any pumpkin flavour and wasn't worth the calories (something I normally don't shy away from). I'm going to try a pumpkin ricotta gnocchi recipe I've seen elsewhere instead of coming back to this recipe.

I've made these twice and they're quite lovely. The trick is to give them a good shake of sea salt before serving. I also reduce the nutmeg just a pinch. They puff up quite a bit in the water, so I suggest cutting them about half the size you want them to end up.

On their own, I didn't find these outstanding, but they worked well when I made a soup of leftover Thanksgiving turkey broth, potatoes, and kale. I boiled the dumplings in the broth instead of water, so they soaked up some of the extra flavor. Served with roasted acorn squash for an autumn harvest bonanza!

Mushy consistency even though I left them sauteeing for longer than the recipe called for.

Buckie18 - I've made this recipe with semolina flour and it was INCREDIBLE. I've never tried whole wheat flour, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. The texture and taste may be slightly diffierent (think whole wheat pasta vs. regular pasta), but probably not bad...if not delicious, if you like wheat/whole grain pastas. Also, I served this with browned butter and some fried sage and it was soooooooo good. Experiment! Enjoy! Even if it doesn't work out for whatever reason, at least you'll know and maybe be inspired to try something else. That's what cooking is all about!

I roasted a huge hubbard squash for pumpkin pie- looking for any way to use it up. Two questions: would whole wheat flour be a reasonable substitue, and can the mixture be made a few hours in advance? Thanks!!

Excellent! I followed the suggestion about the sage butter, and they are wonderful. I can't think of anything that screams "AUTUMN!!!" more. Even my picky son ate them...

I used an entire cup of flour because I was nervous the dumplings wouldn't hold together. Very delicious, served with a mild gorgonzola sauce topped with toasted walnuts for Thanksgiving. Mmm!

I agree these are a bit bland when served plain, but they were delicious when topped with a mix of melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Definitely different, but very good.

Yummy, even for picky eaters. Definetly use cinnamon and clove to make the flavor just right and use an herbed butter when you fry them; I used sage. I made the mistake of not using a large enough pot and when I spooned the dumplings into the water, it bubbled over the top of the pot. Also, don't be discouraged by the dumplings being to mushing looking. When you fry them up they regain shape. But be sure not to take them out of the boiling water to early.

Followed the recipe exactly, and they disintegrated in the boiling water. Very disappointing. Anyone with any idea how to avoid this?

Definately needed more spices and tasteless without the parmesan. My family gave it the thumbs down and it was not worth the effort for me.

I followed the recipe and the dough still fell apart when boiling. Horrible results.

Fantastic, but it does take some time. 1 can of pumpkin made 3 batches for us; these were great browned in butter and served alongside chicken with rosemary.

Agree with others- needs added spice (maybe the cloves and cinnamon). I suggest making a double recipe if you're going to open a can of pumpkin anyway. And use a mini ice cream scooper to drop the dough for ease and uniform dumplings.

A lumpy, tasteless, fattening mess. Not worth the time & effort.

This is our favorite meal for Halloween. I use a sage brown butter sauce instead of the plain butter. I serve it with grilled Apple and chicken sausage and a salad. My kids even eat it!

I thought Parmesan Cheese with Pumpkin, no way! I was wrong. I served this fabulous side with a Chicken in Apple Cream sauce main dish to 4 other couples and got rave reviews and not a one was left! I did add extra spices - cinnamon and clove for more flavor. I will definitely do this one again!

Easy, quick, and tasty comfort food! Dangerous for the waistline. I agree there is too much butter. To bring this up to the 4-fork level, it needs more flavor. Maybe add more spices and sweeten just slightly.

Just when you thought you couldn't do much else with pumpkins! A tasty recipe. Only for those who eat healthy. No dieters please!

this dish looks scrummy, but i don't know what to serve it with: does anyone have any suggestions?

This recipe was okay. Although it was easy, it did take more time then I had thought it would. I served them with the black bean and pumpkin soup recipe, but I'm not sure what else I would serve them with.

This was so easy! I did add some extra spices (cinnamon, cloves) and that gave it just the right flavor.

As a chef, I look for additions to my creations. I make a roasted pumpkin soup and use these dumplings, cooked separately, as a garnish. I sweeten them with brown sugar and use cinnamon and nutmeg to season. The soup itself is sweet, so the dumplings which are not as sweet, are a nice compliment. Rave reviews on the combo and my children at home beg for it in cool weather.

I substitute cooked sweet potato for the pumpkin and use plenty of nutmeg. I then bake the dumplings with some parmesan cheese. My family can never get enough!

I have to disagree with the others. Although this recipe was simple to make, I thought the taste was incredibly bland. It did have the gnocchi like texture I was expecting, but it seemed like something was missing. More seasoning?

A very creative use of the pumpkin. An exotic and tasty dish. My family loves pasta, so this is just perfect.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I served it with a hearty, autumn meat dish. It's a "comfort food" recipe similar to kluski (and gnocchi, but note my last name).

I had some left over buttercup squash so I used that instead of pumpkin. Very easy and fast. I will make this again for dinner guests. I perfect side dish for a fall or winter meal

These are incredibly easy and have a wonderful texture. I had some leftover pureed acorn squash, so I used that instead of canned pumpkin. I also baked them instead of sauteeing them. I put them in a baking dish, dotted them with 1 tablespoon of butter, and sprinkled half a cup of parmesan cheese over. Then I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. My husband was really pleased to hear that they were so easy to make -- about 15 minutes to put the dish together and 20 to bake it.

Great and very quick. I used less butter than the recipe called for and I also tried olive oil. Butter was better. This recipe is even better when sage leaves are added to the butter, be careful not to add too many, this can make it better.

These dumplings were absolutely delicious and SO easy! I actually made them a day ahead and waited to saute them on the day I served them - worked just fine, just make sure to heat them thoroughly. You may want to reduce the amount of butter for sauteing, as it can be too much.
