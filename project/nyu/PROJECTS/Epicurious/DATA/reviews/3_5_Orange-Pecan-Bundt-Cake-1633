I have made this for the last several Passovers. Those who have had no trouble getting it out of the pan but say it is dry have obviously overbaked it. A nonstick pan is a must and even then it is tricky, but usually presentable. Quite moist, nice flavor and doesn't taste like an obvious Passover dessert.

It has become a holiday staple!

Having never heard of "mandel cuts," I followed a suggestion substituted commercial coconut macaroons, chopped and baked to dry them out. (Of course, I found mandel cuts in the store the next day.) I was very happy with the result. I used a nonstick bundt pan greased with margerine, but still had trouble getting in out. It was just barely presentable, but considering it was the dessert of affliction, it was mighty fine.

I had high expectations for this dessert based on the prior reviews. When I tasted the batter I was very impressed... it was quite yummy and I thought I finally found a really good passover dessert, however, once baked, it turned out dry and rather so-so. Rather disappointing overall. One good point - I had no trouble removing it from the bundt pan - it came right out

I made this cake for the second year in a row, once again, it was delicious. The only problem I had, again, was getting it out of the bundt pan (I used a non-stick pan buttered and floured with matzoh meal), most of the cake stuck and I had to slice it in order to serve it, as it was unpresentable otherwise.

When baked, the cake appears to be heavy, yet it's very, very light. Very tasty and it's hard to believe it is flourless. I might add some chocolate chips next time. The combination of orange and chocolate is always tasty.

The evening before the first Sedar, I made two of these cakes in a row: when the first one came out of the oven, the second one went in! The first one, made in a non-stick bundt pan looked perfect. I served it the second night and it was great. The second one, made in an old bundt pan, rose in the oven almost an inch above the pan and fell immediately after coming out of the oven. It was crumbley and didn't look professional; but I served it at the first Sedar, and it was the best tasting cake I have ever had!! It was awesome. Yes, I will make it next year!!

Did I do something wrong???? I have never had an epicurious recipe turn out this badly! YUK! My family thought maybe it was full of alcohol because the taste was so strong! I swear I followed the recipe to a T! Oh well. ....just a warning not to put all your eggs in one basket. As a side note, the recipe for "Engel's Passover Brownies" came out GREAT!!!

So funny...I made so many deserts for Seder that this one was never touched by any of my 30 guests. How happy we were when we tasted it (for the first time) because it is one of the BEST cakes I have ever made ...Passover or not! and we had it all for ourselves ...and I am a baker. This cake is #1 on my list of repeats.

This is the best Pesach cake I have ever tasted! I made a glaze of Fresh orange juice and confectioners sugur just to give it a finished look. One thing I did discover is that if you do not have a large food processer you will need to process the mandle cuts and then add the sugar and the nuts. You can not go wrong with with this cake, it is great!!!!

I made 2 versions of this...the best one was where I used macaroons and added vanilla and dried cherries and a few more spices. But both of them stuck to the bundt pan and were very crumbly when I cut them. Next time, I would use more of a cake pan, and cut out squares of cake, or use it in a triffle. Everyone said it was delicious.

I made this for passover and my family and guests liked the cake, so I would probably make it again as it is fairly easy and not full of 'substitute' ingrediants. I myself did not like it at all, but I have never had a parve passover cake I did like. I also added an ounce of grated bittersweet chocolate to the dry mixture.

A triumph! The family savored every last crumb. I know they will look forward to this every year. I used the Mandel cuts this time, but I look forward to trying the macaroon suggestion next year.

Everyone at our seder loved this- even the picky people! I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon (my mother hates cinnamom) and added 2 TBS triple sec. Yummy!

I made this cake last year and no one could believe the taste and texture. I plan to share it again this year!

I made this for Passover and was delighted with both the taste and presentation. It was easy and different from my usual holiday repertoire, and we polished it off a few days after the seder. I followed one of the other reviewer's advice and used toasted macaroons instead of mandel cuts. Will make again next year.

Absolutely the best passover sponge cake I have ever tasted. It was moist,had a wonderful texture and stayed quite a few days. My family and friends could not get over how delicious it was. This is a must for all future seders!!

This is a very easy but very delicious dessert, perfect for passover, or anyday.

This is a great addition to your collection of Passover desserts; No problem finding the mandel cuts at this time of year. Cake goes together easily, comes out looking and tasting great. Tastes remarkably chocolaty for the small amount of cocoa in the cookies.

I could not find mandel cuts so I subsituted Oberlander's macaroons. I toasted them at 250 in the oven until completely dry and then processed them into coarse crumbs. Everyone raved about this desset. Comments like "the best Passover dessert I've ever had."
