I have made this recipe a few times, the first time i used almost double the cream called for in the recipe to make the dough come together. I noticed the cream I was using was VERY thick - the biscuits were super rich and delicious but I did not like the amount of cream it took to make them. I gave it another try and this time I used slightly less cream that I had thinned with half and half - they were still rich tasting and full of flavor. The third time I watered the cream down with a little 2% milk and that did the trick also - they were delicious. This will definitely be my go to biscuit recipe.

Delicious! This was a hit but as others have reported I did have a little trouble with the dough coming together after adding only one cup cream. I didn't want to add more cream/fat so I added fat free Greek style yogurt (about 2 tablespoons) and it came together beautifully.

Easy to make. Family loved the shortcake. Hard to eat just one!

I used the white chocolate whipped cream with the May 2008 Bon Appetit shortcake. The cream is divine. I added an addtional one teaspoon vanilla to give it a more pronounced vanilla flavor.

I've made this twice now, without the white chocolate cream and love it! My only question to others is how much did your biscuits rise? I expected them to be a bit thicker to hold up to the juices in the strawberries. Other than that, wonderful flavor!

I agree with cmmuckle from Chicago... I will make this my regular shortcake recipe! And, I was looking for a shortcake recipe,only wanted to make two bisquits so I quartered the bisquit recipe, easy to do and turned out great.

Delicious - unlike others I used slightly less cream when making the biscuits, used enough to bring the dough together and they were perfect. Also, used less sugar on the strawberries, my personal preference.Recipe is easy to do and worth far more than the little effort required. Now I'm ready to watch Wimbledon, yum!

This lovely variation on strawberry shortcake went over exceptionally well with my guests, and I will definitely make it again! The white chocolate cream was wildly successful, although some of my younger guests-- my 15 year-old brother-- wasn't crazy about the mint in the strawberries. I think that maybe for the less adventurous, the biscuits and cream with plain strawberries would be just as good.

I only made the biscuits and they turned out wonderful. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and followed the rest of the recipe to a tea. Plan to make this my standby sweet biscuit recipe.

I just made this tonight and probably won't make it again. I had to use another 1/4 cup of whipping cream to make the dough come together. 3 1/4 cups of whipping cream and 9 TBSP of butter is a lot of fat! I'd want it to taste better for that many grams of fat and calories.

My biscuits came out moist and slightly dense. I'm not sure if this is how they were supposed to turn out but they were really good so it didn't really matter. Whrn paired with the white chocolate cream and macerated strawberries it was excellent! I added more cream to the biscuit mixture and omitted the mint (and/or lavender)from the strawberries.

Did anyone else have to add about 3/4 of a cup more cream to the biscuit mixture to get it come together? I haven't baked them yet but I'm worried they'll come out tough because of the extra cream. Any advice?

Awesome....I was going to make the strawberry Shortcakes with White Chocolate Mousse ....which I have made before and we all love....this was even better!!! I did add about 4 oz of chopped milk chocolate to the biscuits to sort of miror the other recipe and it was fabulouse....give it a shot!

This recipe was delightful! The flavors in the strawberries seemed to blend together more harmoniously after (a little) time. I would suggest hulling a third to half of the strawberries and letting them sit in the mint, lemon, and sugar for at least an hour. Adding half of the strawberries in larger chunks /slices 15-25 minutes before serving allows for freshness and improved texture, while also giving room for the flavors to fully develop and blend.

This was FANTASTIC! The biscuits were perfect -- soft and sweet. The berries were luscious. And the cream was incredible. Oddly, I could taste the white chocolate a lot more when I first made it -- after it chilled for a while, the chocolate flavor seemed to fade a bit. Next time I might try adding a little bit more. Other than that, I wouldn't change anything. You should try this!! It's REALLY good!
