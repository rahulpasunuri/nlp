Superb, with some modifications based on previous reviews that reflected our own personal tastes. We used a kilo of medium Sea of Cortez shrimp, put 10 times the amount of crushed red pepper (dried cayennes from our own garden - sublime), quadrupled the amount of garlic, tripled the amount of saffron, doubled the amount of tomato paste, used our own garden grown tomatoes and doubled the amount as indicated in the recipe, and omitted the whipping cream (as it was not necessary due to the choice of polenta). We plated this on some garlicky polenta. When the polenta absorbed the juices, it created a creamy consistency (again, no need for cream). Also, the orange peel totally works. (Note: you could probably sub in lemon as some reviewers did, but you would totally change the dish). My husband and son asked for third helpings.

This was heavenly! I was very apprehensive about this combination, particularly the cream/tomato combination, which I don't generally like. I went heavy on the saffron and added some orange juice. I didn't add the tomato paste and added the raw shrimp at the very end so that it wouldn't overcook. Otherwise followed the recipe. I served with a saffron/pearl couscous side rather than the pasta. Definitely

Made this dish for a lunch with the ladies and it was a huge smash. I added a little more saffron for a bolder flavor. The orange peel was the key ingredient..I served it over basmati rice instead of pasta. It presents better with sprinkled parsley over the late.

this was so easy !!! I sauteed the prawns ahead of time, took them out and finished the sauce. At meal time warmed the sauce added the prawns and served over whole wheat spagetti. Everyone loved it! I did not change the recipe and will make it many times

Delicious. I only made a couple of tiny changes: I halved the garlic, as I only had 2 cloves (just fine). I added three pinches saffron and a quarter t chili flakes. I also used lemon zest instead of orange, but added some orange juice. Essentially the recipe was as posted, and we loved it. Really easy, too. I don't agree with others on leaving out the cream or orange - then it's just a different dish. Try it as posted, it's very well balanced. Enjoy.

Very good -- however, I found the orange zest overpowering. The taste didn't seem to complement the tomato. Will definitely omit next time.

This has become a family favorite! First made it for Valentine's Day as I usually try to make something delicious but special! Has been something my picky son-in-law often requests! YUM!

The only change I made was to add double the amount of tomato paste - definately a good move...the whipping cream would be too cloying without the extra acid from the tomato paste - as a matter of fact, I think the cream was a bit too much - perhaps reducing it to 1/4 cup and adding more tomatoes or even using half and half...my first choice would be more tomatoes and less whipping cream...good recipe nonetheless...

This recipe was REALLY good and with little effort. I added a 1/8 tablespoon more tomato paste and it made the taste even better. Like another reviewer, I used this on top of basmati rice and it tasted like comfort food. A definite keeper in the recipe box!

i've never tasted anything like this recipe, i would definitely make it again. the only thing i would do differently is use a pasta other than fettucini, such as angel hair. it was delicious!

I made this for valentine's day for my fiance. It reassured me that a way to a man's heart is through his stomach. This is a fantastic recipe. I ditched the fettucine and made some saffron rice with almonds and crispy fried spinach. It made a lovely meal for 2 and tasty leftovers for the next day.

Not having shallots on hand, I substituted 1 leek - which was a good addition texture and taste wise. I also opted not to use parsley (as I thought it would overpower everything else) and instead used one whole bunch of oregano. This dish was a wonderful Valentine's dinner and will be repeated in the future.

Very quick and easy dish that tastes great! Followed recipe exactly and used organic canned tomatoes--they taste fresher. Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good but not mindblowing. I served it during the Xmas holidays and my opinion may be tainted by mad-rush distraction. I'd probably consult the recipe again because the orange peel and such were interesting in the sauce, but I wasn't crazy about it.

Tastes like thick bouillabaisse over pasta. Orange peel and saffron are essential.

The first time I made this I followed it exactly. I decided it had way to much garlic - it tasted like any old Italian tomato sauce. The 2nd time I eliminated the garlic entirely and was much happier. The other flavors came through very nicely. Also, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, which cut down on the "red sauce from a jar" flavour as well.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. The only change I made was serving it over basmati rice instead of fettuccine. Even my finicky kids loved it. A keeper.

This is a delicious recipe. A great accompaniment is fresh asparagus. The sauce is fabulous - serve fresh bread alongside so you can scrap your plate!

I made this dish simply because I had everything, (or a reasonable susbstitution thereof)in the house and I didn't know what else to make. -- I followed the procedure exactly, but I added some chopped clams and bay scallops to the shrimp. I removed all the seafood and let the sauce cook down a good bit before adding half and half. -- The result was a restaurant quality meal that was put together very quickly. -- I'll be having this on those days when when I want shrimp in a sauce, butI'm feeling bored with shrimp in green sauce or shrimp scampi. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well balanced the flavor combinations were in this dish even though I tend to enjoy the simple unadulterated taste of fresh seafood. Don't skimp on the saffron, it really makes the dish.

Delicious and easy. Great for an every day meal or company. The recipe is fine as is, just decrease the amount of oil to what's required to saute the shallots without the pan sticking.

This is one of the rare few that make it to my recipe box. Due to my inexperience with Saffron I went exactly by the recipe as far as the ingrediants go. I had to increase most of the cooking times when making the sauce to get the flavors to blend but once they did it was truly outrageous. Next time I may use a hair less orange peel, and a tad more red pepper and oregano. I'll also get a drier wine as the one I used was a cheap chardonney. But it was still magnificent. If you're inexperienced with Saffron like I was, be conservative with its use as "two generous pinches" could be interpreted in many ways. It could easily overpower the rest of the ingrediants. My spouse and I are on low-carb diets so we did substitute roasted asparagus as an accompanyment in lieu of the linguini.

The only reason I gave this dish a '3 fork'rating is because it tasted similar to another recipe I just recently prepared from this website (Shrimp with Spiced Masala and Coconut Milk). Both were delicious, I just was hoping for a different taste this time. I did substitute chicken broth for the wine, added more tomato paste and seasoned with seasoned salt instead of plain...Fabulous.

Delicious. Add the shrimp to the sauce just before serving and simmer until just cooked, otherwise the shrimp will be overcooked and tough.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. I recommend throwing the shrimp in about one minute before the cream, however, instead of cooking them first. The cream isn't really necessary (and adds fat) but the texture and colour of the sauce are so fabulous with it that it's a shame to leave it out. Don't plan a side dish besides salad, this is very rich.

Rating: 3
Very good quick meal. I followed the previous reviewers advice and left out the cream and doubled the tomatoes. Also doubled the garlic and the orange peel. Excellent casual company meal. Next time I will make it a little ahead of time and let it sit on the stove for a couple of hours to totaly blend the flavors.

Everyone loved it -- not difficult to make yet an impressive dish to serve. I agree with the other rater -- serve with a salad, baguette and a good bottle of wine.

Tried this dish for the first time for Valentine's Day and it was heavenly! I doubled the sauce and seafood, using a combination of shrimp, bay scallops, and cooked lobster. I served over fresh pasta. What a flavor treat! The sauce is very rich, so all that's needed is a simple salad, crusty bread, and a good red wine. For a lighter touch next time, I may use less cream and maybe increase the tomatoes and add some chicken stock. This is going into my recipe file for sure!

I have made this dish countless times, but I use a large can of tomatoes (28 oz) and omit the cream to make it lighter.

I have made this dish many times for a variety of people. All love it. It's relatively easy to make and can be doubled or tripled easily. Substitute lemon zest and/or drain the tomatoes a little and add lime juice for an excellent effect.

This is probably one of the best shrimp & pasta dishes I have ever tasted. The hot pepper flakes gave it just the right bite. You would need to double this dish if you were making it for four. I will definitely be having this again.

this one is great with a capital G.however to make it lower calorie I decreased oil to 1 T. shrimp to 3/4 pound, used ONE cup half n half and increased pasta to 12 oz.
