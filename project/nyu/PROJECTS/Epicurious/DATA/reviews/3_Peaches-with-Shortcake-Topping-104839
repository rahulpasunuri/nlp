This was just OK - yes it only took about 15 min to make but like anything you get out what you put in - so little effort, little to rave about. It would be good for a weekday dessert in a pinch but the topping itself is kind of disappointing. The dough is quite runny and goopy and about 1/3 of it sunk into the fruit while baking. The part that stayed above the fruit was OK and did have a nice cinnamon / sugar crust. Not sure if I would make this again.

This gets points for being quick, but I too thought the shortcakes were too buscuit-like. And it seemed that way too much cinnamon was added to a small amount of peaches, so I spinkled only a small amount of cinnamon sugar onto the tops. Gourmet's recipe for Peach Cobbler is a much better bet.

I'm confused by people saying this isn't good. I found this to be a wonderful and easy dessert! It was delicious. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was the star of my dinner party. Everyone wanted the recipe. I'd definitely make this again.

I made this with fresh Georgia peaches and high hopes, but we were very disappointed. I'd make a standard peach cobbler any day over this one...

The only reason this even gets a fork is because you can't go wrong with peaches... I used fresh and they were delicious. But the shortbread topping was way too cakey, and really did not taste good at all. Best to just stick with traditional peach cobbler.

I thought this was good but wouldn't make it again. I thought it was too "cakey" and prefer a more buttery flaky cobbler. I agree that it needs more peaches - I used fresh.

Delicious; easy to make. Overall, the perfect shortcake.

Great, great, great !!! So easy and everyone enjoyed it. Second time I made it I did use 2 bags of peaches. We also did top it with vanilla ice cream.

This was excellent and very easy to make! The only change was to use canned peaches instead of frozen ones. I will definitely be making this again!

So good and so easy! I used canned peaches (didn't feel like a trip to the store) and it turned out excellent. Had to make sure to get all the syrup off though, or I would have had peach soup! Next time I'll add some berries for contrast, but you can bet this will be a regular dessert in our house! And I couldn't resist the temptation to have some of the leftovers for breakfast this morning!

Very easy dessert! Topping was great. Next time I will us fresh fruit, I didn't care much for the frozen fruit. I agree it could use about another 1/4 to 1/4 pound of fruit. My husband suggested baking the topping alone then serving it was fresh fruit on top.

Very quick prep, I used a mix of fresh peaches and nectarines and added a little nutmeg as the previous reviewer suggested. I baked mine for about 40 minutes, which seemed sufficient. Served with whipped cream on top. One of the easiest desserts I've made, and tasty.

I added raspberries and fresh ground nutmeg to the peaches, and then added crystallized ginger to the shortcake dough. Also added fresh ground ginger to the cinn-sugar topping. Very yummy with minor adjustments.

Excellent and easy desert that takes all of 10 minutes to put together as the previous commenter said. The only thing I will do differently the next time is to add another 1/2 lb. of peaches--two full pounds still left it a bit light on fruit and heavy on topping for my taste...though the topping is yummy enough to eat alone. =)

The filling was a little runny and I did not use all of the topping but it tasted very good.

This great recipe took 10 minutes prep. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Note: it is also very good cold.

This was so easy to make and the shortcake topping is delicious! This recipe seems to invite all kinds of variations, i.e. adding rasperry sauce to the ice cream to make a peach melba of sorts. It's a great year-round dessert!
