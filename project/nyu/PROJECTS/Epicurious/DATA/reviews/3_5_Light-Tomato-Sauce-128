I just picked some tomatoes from my garden and thought this would be a nice recipe to try. I decided to double it. I peeled and seeded 9 large tomatoes (I figured that would be approx. 2 14-1/2 oz. cans.). Everything went into the blender and then I cooked it. It really needed a lot more time to thicken. I added a can of tomato sauce (didn't have paste) and simmered it for about 40 minutes. It really was a nice, light sauce. I think this would be perfect on lobster ravioli or ANYTHING else that needs a light red sauce. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great, easy sauce. I used it several times last summer and am getting ready to use it in a "light" lasagne this weekend. I've used it with raviolis as well. I always add extra garlic and plenty of fresh basil. I'm usually a fan of heavier sauces with tomato paste...now I'm a convert!
