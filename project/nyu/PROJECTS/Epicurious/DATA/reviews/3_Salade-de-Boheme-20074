Re: links in recipes--don't assume that the link will always be in blue. That depends on your settings on your own computer. Just look for the cursor changing to a hand and click away!

A little internet tip...any time you see a word or phrase underlined and in blue (you can also tell if you use your mouse arrow over the word and it turns into a hand) you can "click" on it. Just use your mouse, watch it turn into a little hand and then click!!! Bon Appetit does this with a lot of thier recipes--so be aware. I would hate for you to miss out on a fabulous recipe! Good Luck
