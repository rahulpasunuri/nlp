Easy and tasty. Used mixed dried mushrooms and leftover Christmas ham diced. Used the mushroom soaking liquid mixed with a concentrated vegetable broth to make the wine/broth reduction. Added a clove of garlic since I had no sage. Will make again with our leftover ham.

Have enjoyed this recipe, relatively easy and good instructions. I added the following after some experimentation: 3 small Zucchini squash - cubed; 3 Shallots - diced; 3 cloves of garlic - minced; 1 medium sweet red pepper - diced; large handful of Arugula - hand shredded; 1 Tsp Truffle Oil Added the veggies while reducing the mushrooms except for hte Arugula which was added just before serving. This gave it more color and added some interesting flavor. Also tried a grilled Strip steak thinly sliced over the top and my guests loved it.

I've made this a few times and I think I now have the version we like the best. Cooking for two, so I halved the recipe, but increased the liquids slightly and after reduction had a bit more than half a cup. Drained the pancetta well, so as not to have too much grease, and then at the end, added in a couple of handfuls of baby arugula, roughly chopped. I used gemelli pasta and it was really very tasty!

Made this pasta last night, and it was amazing! I can NEVER leave a recipe alone & follow it exactly... So this was my spin. First, I upped the broth & wine by 50%. I read a few reviews that said this is not a very saucy pasta. I had to have about 1 3/4 to 2 cups after reducing almost 30 minutes. Left the mushroom & pancetta as is for the most part. I did slice up a few shallots & threw them in with the second batch of mushrooms. I don't know about serving 6 people in your house with this recipe, but not in mine. Especially as a main course. So I cubed up a couple of beef tenderloin filets and flash browned them in the same pan after the pancetta. Put those aside & finished the recipe as written. Adding the beef back in only for the last minute to warm. Oh, and I served it over homemade parpadelle. Will definitely make again when I need a pasta fix.

This was absolutely fantastic. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. Like others suggested, I only used 4 tablespoons of butter, because of the olive oil and pancetta adding fat as well. Everybody in my family loved it.

Served this to eight people last night and everyone complimented me! Everyone cleaned-up their plate! The broth and wine reduction took over an hour! Maybe if I had an industrial stove things would have been better! I'm so glad I made it ahead of time. I had extra sage, so I sprinkled some on the top of the pasta when served, and it was very tasty.

Delicious recipe. Like other reviewers, I tried with 4 tbsp butter and it was great

This was good. I used less butter as several other reviewers recommended. I'll make this again, but next time I think I'll add chicken.

I have made this a few times. While I love the recipe as written, reducing the butter to 4 Tbsn, using an low salt beef broth (Kitchen Basics makes a very nice version), and adding some Andouille sausage has made this a favorite for our family. Also, I use a nice Zin for the wine. Enjoy

My best friend made this last week while I was visting her and I was excited to make it for my husband. He loved it! I reduced the salt due to the parm and pancetta. I also only used 4 tablesp of unsalted butter = perfect! The key is to reduce the wine and broth. I served over cavatapi and it was a hit! Now a fav on our household!

Best mushroom pasta I've ever made or had and I've had many different dishes. The flavor of reduced wine & broth + pancetta give it the added depth lacking in previous recipes. Excellent, thank you Geranio for sharing.

Very fresh, deep flavors. I followed another's advise and only used 4 tbs of butter and it was not lacking. I will definitely make this again!

Very good and it's quick to prepare if you reduce the wine and broth a day ahead. I used very little additional salt on the mushrooms and none at the end because the pancetta and parmigiano provided plenty. I used less butter - only 4 Tbsp, and thought it still had a good level of richness.

I made this as written and loved it. The saltiness of the pancetta was great with the sage & mushrooms. My husband would probably have rated it with fewer forks, as he prefers more 'sauce' with his pasta and this was not that way. Still, I loved it, he liked it, and we'll add it to the rotation. We both thought it'd be a great fall/winter dish, and an excellent first course.
