Since coming across this recipe 7 years ago, I have made this cranberry relish every year. I am a big fan of cranberry sauces, relishes, and compotes of all kinds, but this is hands down my favorite. I also have several friends who, after trying this, have adopted it as their own. Cardamom has a distinctive flavor; if you're a fan, you'll love this. The chewiness of the cherries is a nice complement as well. This is a simple, yet very special, cranberry dish.

I don't think I like cardamom either, and it's so expensive. What other spice would be a good alternative?

This is was just okay. We didn't care for the flavor of the cardamom. I guess that is an acquired taste.

I've made this every Thanksgiving for the last three years and it is always a huge hit. Last year, I couldn't find dried cherries so I subbed in sweet dried pineapple. That was so good that this year I used both. Amazingly good with turkey dinner, even better with mayo on a turkey sandwich the next day.

We brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved about it. Our hostess finished off the rest the next morning -- straight from the bowl -- and requested the recipe to pass on to relatives. I did tinker with the ingredients a bit to liven it up, adding a few splashes of balsamic vinegar; some extra brown sugar; chunks, juice drippings and minced zest from 2 freshly picked oranges; a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon; and 1 finely diced granny smith apple stirred in after the processing was finished, for extra crunch. The sweet-sour-bitter-crunchiness was a nice complement to the salty-earthy turkey, stuffing and gravy. Trust me -- a winner, esp. among those who don't usually like cranberry sauce.

This was so good we are having it again for Christmas. I think it is destined to be a holiday tradition.

I absolutely loved this relish, which was my favorite part of the entire Thanksgiving feast.. I didn't think there'd be much difference between the cherries & the cranberries, but, indeed, there were wonderfully subtle differences in taste as well as texture. And the cardamom...a great touch.
