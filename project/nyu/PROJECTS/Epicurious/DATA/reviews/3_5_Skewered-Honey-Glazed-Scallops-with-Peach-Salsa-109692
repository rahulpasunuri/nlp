Wonderful summer dish! I used shrimp instead of the scallops and it was just fabulous. The salsa was a tad spicy alone, but with the sweetness of the honey from the shrimp it was just perfect. The flavors blend very nicely together. I made it for father's day brunch and will definitely be making it again.

Made this tonight as written -- no changes or substitutions -- and it was ridiculously good. The salsa is just spicy enough and the scallops at two minutes per side were perfectly cooked. We bought a 2.5 pound bag of frozen sea scallops at Costco ($18) and will make this again next weekend for the neighbors and friends.

I've made this several times, as written, used the salsa for fresh caught tuna bbq, and tonight made it with halibut. All have been delicious! The halibut I cut into large chunks and skewered them onto 2 bamboo skewers for easy turning. Grilled for about 6 minutes basting 2 or 3 times. It was very moist. I make extra salsa because it is so good. This time I only had jarred ginger and pickled jalapenos, but they worked out fine! Try this when the peaches are ripe!

Made this for dinner as my husband is now on a health kick. Used Mahi Mahi instead of the scallops but it still came out delicious. The salsa was great - I didn't peel the peaches like the recipe asked. The salsa was very spicy, our mouths were on fire -- but we still loved it. The salsa was refreshing and the lime was a nice touch against the jalapeno. We will definitely be making it again.

Very flavorful, The marinade kept the scallops very moist and the salsa was a nice compliment. It really didn't take that long to put together, I took another reviewers suggestion and used mint rather than cilantro.

I was disappointed with the salsa. I was looking for something to feature some wonderful local peaches. Someone else said they thought it tasted medicinal and I'd have to agree. I used fresh peppers from the garden, they tend to have more zip than the ones in the store so maybe that messed up the balance. I wish I'd tasted it more before bringing it to the table. Something was off with the balance of the flavors. I'll look for a different salsa next time. (Didn't try the scallops - maybe the sesame oil and honey from that sauce would have made the difference?)

Wonderful,light summer recipre. Made with shrimp and scallops and came out great. Full of flavor. Salsa is worth the work. Substituted fresh mint for cilantro and it gave it a very fresh taste. A repeater!

I served this with baby leaves and turned it into a salad before serving the surf and turf kebabs.

This was a wonderful dish for a summer evening. I followed it with epicurious' watermelon and raspberry sorbet and the pairing was quite nice.

Best recipe I've made yet from Epicurious! It was my first time cooking scallops so I was nervous, but I followed this recipe to the letter and both grilled scallops and salsa came out amazing.

There is nothing nicer you can do to scallops. We made this 18 months ago and have talked about it ever since; now that we're back home, we made it a priority to repeat. Brilliant.

Amazing summer dish! Make sure the peaches are really fragrant and ripe. There is a lot of prepping but so worth it. I have used shrimp instead of scallops in the past and it was equally wonderful. Served it with saffron rice with currants.

A bit of prep required for the salsa but it really adds to the scallops - don't skip it.

We enjoyed the scallops, but the salsa was too spicy for our taste. Will make again, but will leave tha jalapenos out.

Excellent light summer dish. I skewered both shrimp and scallops. Served with Jasmine rice mixed with cilantro and green onions.

I thought this was pretty good, the salsa especially, though my husband wasn't thrilled and scallops are his favorite! He thought the scallops had a medicine-like taste to them, and I made it exactly as the recipe instructed. Will def. make the salsa again, it would be great with grilled chicken.

Great flavors, everyone loved it, only complint a fair amount of chopping, but worth it.

Even non-scallop lovers were drooling over these--they went faster than the lobster tails! Yes, it's time-intensive, but so worth it. Will try to make salsa day ahead next time to see if it keeps, to cut down on day-of prep work.

We made this in the summer with fresh ripe peaches, and everyone loved it. We decided to make it again a few days later to share with some others who missed out the first time. Delicious!!!

Very tasty. Peach salsa was a bit labor intensive. Will make again when peaches are in season.

My husband and I thought this was a winner and I would definitely make it again. I served it on brown rice. Great combination of flavors!

This is really fabulous. I made it while visiting family and it was a huge hit. I had to wing it a little with the ingredients because of what was available: I used halibut and shrimp on the skewers and nectarines instead of peaches. I'm sure you could use this as a base recipe for many variations of fish and fruit. I served this with couscous seasoned with cilantro and green onions. Really, really good! This will definetely be a staple recipe in my house. Note: be sure to clean and oil the grill racks really well as the fish can stick easily, especially after the glaze is applied.

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare scallops and this was a winner. Next time I might up the amount of peaches and decrease the amount a ginger in the salsa a little bit, but that's just personal preference. It was quite yummy, flavorful and easy

Excellent for those hot summer evenings... The only concern I have is that 16 scallops can easily be eaten by 2 people. I would do 24 for 4 people.

I made this last night and it was fabulous! The marinade, scallops and peach salsa were a delicious combination, definitely one of the best new dishes I've made. And I will definitely make it again!

Quick, easy and tasty. I've made this twice, though the second time I used the marinade and salsa on ahi steaks. Great either way. Will make again.
