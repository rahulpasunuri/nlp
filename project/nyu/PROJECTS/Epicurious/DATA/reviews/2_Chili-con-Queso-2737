I gave this recipe 3 forks because it does serve as a good base for good queso, with some modifications. I used about 2 T flour and that was plenty, only 2 T of cream cheese, and about 4 T butter. I also added some half and half to make the queso thinner and add some more creaminess. I did not add tomatoes and instead added some chipotle salsa to taste. From all of that- -this turned out delicious! Other reviewers said it's a glorified Velveeta, but I do not like the way velveeta tastes. This recipe lets you achieve the taste of your favorite cheese (Jack, chihuaua, asadero, cheddar) without the oily separation that comes with it!

Chili con tastless is more like it. This make British cooking taste flavorful!

This recipe needs a lot of help. It has way too much flour-- 1 Tablespoon would do just fine, and it's lacking in depth. Next time I'd make a roux and add some beer to the base, before addint the veggies and cream cheese. I also agree it's bland. I added chipotle salsa to mine, which helped. I think with all the suggestions of reviewers, the recipe could be rescued.

Very Bland! Save yourself the trouble and have a better dip using Velveeta and a jar of good salsa. By the way, the butter, flour, cream cheese and cheddar cheese combo is Velveeta, so if you're out, do that part, then add the jar of salsa.

1) I made half a recipe and there was still _way_ too much as an appetizer for six people (even given that 4 of them were 20-something single men). 2) this tasted like I recreated velveeta! no one complained, and indeed some of the guys kept eating it as fast as they could grab another chip, but all this is is homemade velveeta--the taste is nothing special (I even doubled the chiles and onions and added chipotle chile powder to try to give it more zing!).

This is my new stand-by for mid-week entertaining. Cut down on the flour to thin it out, and throw in a Tbs or so of diced jalapenos in lieu of the chilies if you prefer it a little spicier. It goes FAST!

Couldn't be an easier recipe... mix and serve. I would suggest keeping it warm as it tends to thicken.
