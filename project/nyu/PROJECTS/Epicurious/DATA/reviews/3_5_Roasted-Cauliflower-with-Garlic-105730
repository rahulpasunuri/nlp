Love to cook cauliflower this way. I just leave the garlic cloves whole in the peel and let them roast. When done, I squeeze out that delicious garlic paste from the cloves and spread over the cauliflower....very yummy!

Really quick and simple and quite tasty. My husband said it was the best preparation of cauliflower he's ever had.

Rating: 4
Since there are only 2 of us, I didn't get 6 lbs of cauliflower. Instead, I used 1 head, yet still chopped up 3 cloves of garlic. The key is to get the cauliflower to caramelize - so it needs to get brown. Didn't have a problem with burnt garlic, as others have mentioned...maybe because I chopped it and soaked it in oil as I was breaking apart the cauliflower? Have made too many times to count and always look forward to eating it!

I can't believe no one has mentioned that the temperature is too high, burning the minced garlic. I would not mince the garlic in future but would use whole cloves and would cook at about 375.

Excellent side dish! A few changes though, I didnt add as much oil and added a few dashes of curry powder. I will definitely be making this again.

This was great! The garlic gets nice and carmelized and nutty. I follow the South Beach diet and make mashed cauliflower often. This is a great alternative way to prepare cauliflower. I left this in for 30 minutes, it browned up nicely!

Can't believe it never occurred to me to cook cauliflower this way. We added the stalks (leaves?), cut into 1" slices, and they were delicious and caramelized on the edges. Yum.

I made a mistake when trying this recipe and had it in the oven for almost an hour. But ya know, I'm going to make it exactly the same way next time! The cauliflower was not dry but was nice and soft the way I like it, not halfway cooked as it is so often. Plus the cauliflower sort of carmelized in places and it was wonderful. No burned garlic either. Go figure.

This dish resembles one that I tried at Chez Panisse. There, garlic was omitted and I did the same with mine. I chopped the florets smaller after roasting them to improve the presentation and the result was bits that were sweet, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

One of my very few four fork ratings. Makes cauliflower taste like a snack---you just want to keep eating and eating it. I don't use nearly this amount of oil. My whole family loves this---would eat it every night if I made it. Can't say enough about this method of preparing cauliflower.

Rating: 3
The great thing about this recipe is that it tastes really good on its own, but can be varied however you want. I love it with shredded gruyere or smoked provolone/mozz on top under the broiler, or herbs/spices/curry as others suggested. If you're in a hurry, you can get a similar taste by cooking in a cast iron skillet until dark and carmelized; any way, it's one of the best for cauliflower.

I have made this three times in the past month and have learned that the garlic is best if left in whole cloves. My last version I used about 10 cloves whole (the roasted garlic element really makes this dish). I also seasoned version 2.0 with curry powder after the oil bath. EXCELLENT! This is simple and delicious way to enjoy cauliflower providing RAVE reviews from my "testers".

Rating: 4
this is so simple and really wonderful. I took the advice of using garlic powder instead of fresh, which i rarely switch-- great. I also added some cumin to give it a nutty, savory flavor and that really turned the dish into something special. highly recommended!

Used 4 cloves of garlic for one head of cauliflower and could have added more (yes, I love garlic...and the flavour really mellows when it's roasted). This recipe is so simple and delicious. I can't believe I've never tried it before - I'll definitely make it regularly now.

Used Broccoflower- this was heaven. As others suggested, used garlic powder to prevent burning, then added a head of garlic -widely slivered- the last 10 minutes of roasting. Prepared this for roasting a few hours in advance- simply placed all ingredients in a bowl then transferred to a baking sheet when I was ready to use. Easy and delicious.

This was so good! Everyone loved it, even my 2 year old. Mixed leftovers with plain brown rice for lunch 2 days later and it was great.

this was a very nice way to do cauliflower. i fretted over the others who complained that it wasn't done in the allotted time. the simple solution to that is to reduce the size of the pieces. but aside from that, the texture and taste were very nice. family members who dislike cauliflower even enjoyed it. for those who might care, the exact same technique (oil, garlic, salt pepper) works on all roastable vegetables.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. My husband who does not like cauliflower enjoyed this dish. Loved how simple it was to make. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (to avoid burning) and also turned the pieces evenly for consistent roasting. This would even make a nice appetizer.

Rating: 4
Here I thought I invented this recipe! Not really. A mother of five children gave it to me a few years ago and I have made it every which way ever since. Glad to know that my husband and I are not the only "pigs" out there and can devour the entire head at one sitting!

Rating: 4
Yum, yum, yum!!!!! This was so good that it will be our go-to cauliflower recipe. As my husband said, "How could we ever eat cauliflower any other way after this"! As another person suggested, I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic to avoid burning and it was still absolutely delicous. The best part are the yummy carmelized parts. A winner!

Rating: 3
I made this for the zillionth time tonight, it is a family favorite. Sometimes I make it with the garlic, sometimes without and it is wonderful either way. I make sure that the bottom of the cauliflower is browned before I turn it in the pan and that helps to ensure a perfect consistency in the finished dish. I also season generously with salt and pepper and sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Wonderful!!!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe and so simple to make. A few readers were concerned about the garlic burning but rest assured, it doesn't burn. The liquid from the cauliflower and the olive oil keep it moist. It's such a great addition, don't skimp on it because it changes the dish completely. I added a bit more oil and topped it with some freshly grated parmesan.

This was so simple and was a real revelation. Now that I know how good roasted cauliflower can be I want to try the roasted curried cauliflower also on this site. I served this with pan-fried trout and it was perfect.

I wanted a simple but different compliment to an Italian meal. This recipe worked amazingly well for me using a few of the changes suggested here. I left garlic cloves whole and unpeeled to roast with the caluiflower and added garlic powder to the oil, salt and pepper for the garlic flavor without concern that the garlic would burn. I used three different heads of clauliflower, regular white, green broccoflower and an orange cauliflower head. The presentation on a platter is spectacular and went well with our antipast and carbonara dinner. Absolutely will make it again.

Rating: 3
A great change from the usual cauliflower receipes. I ommitted the garlic (afraid of the burning problem) and added one onion cut into wedges, some chunks of carrots and sprinkled salt and 1/2 tsp of cumin over everything. It came out delicious and my kids loved it!

Do not mince the garlic (it will burn). The cauliflower tends to dry out, even with plenty of olive oil. Next time, I will try another reviewer's suggestion and cover with foil for half the cooking time.

I'm generally not a huge fan of cauliflower, but roasting mellowed the flavor. A good suggestion not to mince the garlic as mine burned. A great addition to the Thanksgiving table.

Who in the world would have thought cauliflower could ever be special?! Even steamed, our objection was watery and bland...(and don't EVEN get me started on the cheese and crap...) YUM. Who knew!?

Rating: 4
This was a very easy recipe and utterly delicious! I added red peppers and onion, and roasted the garlic cloves in aluminum foil rather than crushing or mincing it. The other thing I did was cover the pans with aluminum foil for about 15 or 20 minutes (425 degrees), took the foil off, and then stirred twice over the next 15 or 20 minutes. I think this may have made the cauliflower more tender.

Rating: 3
I am not sure why some people had trouble with this recipe. Roasted cauliflower is about the only way I'll eat cauliflower, and this recipe couldn't be simpler. I do suggest perhaps crusing your garlic about halfway through cooking, so it doesn't burn. And if you need to cook an extra 5-10 minutes to really carmelize the cauliflower, go for it. This way of eating cauliflower without drowning it in cheese and butter is definitely the best way.

Rating: 1
A contrasting view: this cooked and cooked (40min+) and still was raw. (Check oven temp, it was fine. Plus the meat OVERcooked.) The next morning I put them back in for 60+ min and they were STILL tough and virtually inedible. I know/love that "creaminess" cauliflower attains, I'll try again based on people's experience ...

Rating: 3
I have only ever steamed cauli's or made cauli. cheese. So was intrigued by this recipe and now I never want it ant other way. It was quite delicious. Some reviewers have said that it was not terribly good, but there is only so much you can do with cauliflower without it becoming part of a completely different dish. So as far as serving cauli as just a side dish this was yummy.

Rating: 2
Liked it - much tastier than just steaming cauliflower but it's still just cauliflower. Easy!! Will probably make it again.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. We make a couple of modifications. We add at least one head of garlic, broken up into cloves (unpeeled!) when we mix up the cauliflower and oil (less oil is fine; we probably do about 2-3 T per large cauliflower)but don't add the minced garlic at that point. About halfway through cooking (after 12-15 mins) we take the trays out, add the minced garlic, mix it all up, and put it back in the oven. The garlic won't burn this way and the roasted cloves are delicious - just pop out of skin and eat or spread on bread. My kids like some veggies but they love this one! A real winner.

Most of the garlic fell to the bottom of the pan and burned. The cauliflower took an additional 15 mins. to cook. Bottom line -- bland and tasteless.

Yum! This was the best cauliflower dish I've had in ages. I reduced the olive oil a bit(1/4-1/3c), turned the oven down half way through (to 400F), and grated fresh romano on top just before serving. One head easily fed and would probably feed 3 as well. Just remember to stir it often so it doesn't burn!

This is a fabulous recipe. I served it to guests, including a self-professed cauliflower hater, and they all loved it. It sounds like a ton of cauliflower, but it shrinks in the oven. Depending on how much else you are serving, I'd say 1 head of cauliflower would serve 2 people. Everyone just gobbles this up!

Not that there hasn't been enough written on this particular recipe already, but, I thought this addition was worth mentioning. Try adding some diced pancetta along with all the other ingredients and roast everything together as it is written. Oh My!!

This is by far the best way to cook cauliflower since most of the recipes out there for cauliflower is cream base. This recipe definitely brings out a different dimension on cauliflower. My husband usually doesn't care much for cauliflower, but we both enjoy this dish very much.

This is a lower cal version of one of my favorite middle eastern dishes where the cauliflower is deep fried,to a golden brown,drained and served with a tahini sauce. I still use the tahini sauce as a side with the roasted cauliflower. Tahini paste (sesame paste)can be found in most grocery stores usually with the calamata olives and jarred grape leaves. I usually take 2 tablespoons of the paste,try to stir the oil into the paste before doing this. I add at least 2-3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, salt & pepper to taste,with a strong shake of cayenne. Stir until the consistency is like a smooth ranch salad dressing adding more lemon juice or water to achieve the desired consistancy. This also makes a great salad dressing Yum. Sorry have to go roast some cauliflower now...

Rating: 3
Amazing - 3.5 forks! I absolutely hate cooked cauliflower, but this was excellent. I adjusted the cauliflower to 1 head, used about 1/3 cup olive oil, and 4 cloves garlic. I also threw in a few broccoli florets to get them out of the refrigerator. I think the trick is to brown the cauliflower as much as possible without burning it; stirring often helps. Will make this next time with broccoli only - the broccoli turned into crispy little bits of garlicky goodness, almost caused a fistfight in my house. Can't wait to try it with brussels sprouts as a previous review suggested.

Rating: 3
Oh, yum, yum! I think even cauli-haters might try this. I love all veggies and roast many of them, even brussels sprouts, but I thought the cauliflower sounded a tad weird. My husband, who is normally lukewarm about cauliflower, remarked about how good it was. The garlic is important, I think, but also be aware that roasting makes the pieces shrink, as it is dry heat. One medium head, roasted, made about 3, maybe 4 servings for the two of us. Definately try this, maybe kids will even like it!

Rating: 4
We LOVED this recipe. I scaled down the olive oil for one cauliflower head without decreasing the garlic. We ate the entire head of cauliflower, which never happens with steamed veggies. I will definitely do this again, and will add herbs and other veggies next time.

Rating: 3
I like this dish quite a bit and have made it successfully with brussels sprouts (sliced into 3 pieces) and eggplant (chopped); with both of those, I added a bit more olive oil and much more garlic. My only caveat: Use much less of the veggie -- otherwise, the flavor won't come through (I'd cut the cauliflower proportion by half.) This dish also works well as a leftover; the olive oil seeps into the veggies, creating a mouth-watering taste.

Rating: 3
Not bad of a recipe -- I liked the roasted flavor. It certainly adds more flavor than plain steaming. I think next time I'll follow others' advice on adding onion and baby carrots. The roasted garlic flavor can get a bit strong to my tastes, though I was scaling the recipe for one head and was using large cloves of garlic.

This was a great and easy way to prepare cauliflower. My kids love cauliflower but now only want to eat it this way. Leftovers rarely make it into the refrigerator because whoever is cleaning up tends to finish it off! I frequently toss in fresh herbs that I have on hand (tarragon is particularly good). I'm not so exact with the timing or the degrees of the oven and it always turns out great. Also really good on pasta.

We loved this! Cauliflower is the one vegetable that I am not particularly fond of, but made this way it is so delicious -- slightly crispy on the outside and buttery, creamy on the inside. We do think sprinkling it with fresh finely grated parmesan cheese definitely adds to the recipe. I have made this recipe a few times and find there is a fine line between done and overdone. When I overcooked it, it was mushy and bland; when I cooked it to the time noted on the recipe, it was delicious. That's the hub-bub!

My family is so glad that I tried this one -- it was absolutely fabulous and there was absolutely none left. The outside of cauliflower was crispy brown and the inside was buttery and creamy...it was amazing. I did lightly sprinkle it with parmesan cheese after it was roasted, which we liked. I served it alongside Chicken with Baby Onions (from this web site), which is our family favorite. Excellent, excellent, excellent.

I made this twice, and the second time reduced the temperature quite a lot (to C 175) and it turned out much better.

This recipe is a winner. Since I found it about 5 weeks ago I have made it about once a week. My husband loves it. I've given the recipe to friends and they were equally impressed.

I don't particularly like cauliflower, but had to try this recipe because of all the positive reviews. Indeed, it was tasty (nutty flavour!) and tender. Roasting is becoming my favourite way to cook veggies. (I really like the Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar recipe.)

I have made this a # of times. I use Pam olive oil spray and about 2 tsp drizzled over the top. We love it. This is a little trick I have been using-When it's not quite done, but almost-turn off your oven and let set-this way it doesn't keep browning and can get tender.

This was delicious. I tossed the cauliflower with crushed garlic and good olive oil. This way, the garlic did not burn as easily and the cauliflower had a nice overall taste. I served it alongside the Mme Lacouregges chicken which had shallots and balsamic vinegar. Great!

One of my favorite side dishes. I've served it with salmon, chicken, all combinations of menus and always received rave reviews.

Have given this recipe to 3 other people (with the proper credit, of course) and received very favorable responses from each of them. My husband whines if I even consider making them any other way!! I believe the trick is in the browning with high heat. I have used both fresh and bottled minced garlic with equally good results. Thanks Epicurious for a new and delicious side dish!

This was delicious! I took note of the burning garlic so after I tossed the cauliflower in the seasonings, I scooped the garlic off the bottom of the dish and sprinkled it over the cauliflower. It was only necessary to stir the dish once while cooking.

A great alternative to steaming veggies! The next time I make this, I'll cut the oil back a bit(was a bit greasy) and add the minced garlic the last 10 minutes (the garlic burned).

Rating: 3
I agree that this burns very quickly. This is quite tricky if you like your vegetables less crispy and more cooked. However, I will do this again and try it with other vegetables

I gave this treatment 4 forks because it is the best way I've found to prepare cauliflower! I keep the pieces on the large side, cook them in a metal roasting pan for 30 mins. at 400, turning it every 7-10 mins. and sometimes add broccoli which roasts well, too (or whole tomatoes, or zucchini and peppers...roasted veggies are the bomb). Roasted garlic fares better with the skins on, but I do throw in some minced garlic. I like eating it with cashew dipping sauce (recipe found on this site) which I always have on hand.

This was an absolute hit with my family. My husband has barely been eating cauliflower when I make it these days. He practically ate the entire head himself. I have never seen him eat so much of any vegetable before. My Sister was in town & tried the little morsels that was left over. She even fell in love with it. I know I didn't measure out the oil and just poured enough in to coat when I tossed it.

I never thought of roasting cauliflower, but this was delicious and a good change from the usual.

Rating: 4
From having read previous comments, I worried about scorching and stirring and oiliness. So I used a 400 degree oven and whole garlic cloves and big inch-thick slices of cauliflower and just enough oil to film the bottom of the pan. Wow! Three of us ate a whole large head of cauliflower the first time I made it; the second time, just two of us ate the whole head; next time, I may make it just for myself. Wonderful!

The taste was very good and reminded me of the way cauliflower is served in many middle eastern restaurants around here. It is not a dish you can leave alone. You *must* pay attention and stir or it will burn badly. Is there an easier way to do this that doesn't require standing by the oven the whole time? I was testing this for an upcoming dinner party and was hoping for a vegetable dish that didn't require a lot of attention.

Rating: 3
We love roast garlic, so I added quite a bit more finely chopped garlic to this dish. It is important to keep stirring the dish to the garlic from burning or becoming bitter. We are not that fond of cauliflower, but we loved this dish. The nutty flavors came forward in the cauliflower and that cabbage sour flavor receded to a level that was interesting (rather than overpowering the way I usually think of cauliflower).

THoughtit was fair with some changes. Afer 30min, garlic was burnt and cauliflower was still hard,so I added more pressed garlic, some stock,nutmeg and more salt and pepper. Cooked for about 30-40 min more, then sprinkled grated cheese on top and broiled for 2min.

the basis of this recipe rocks! Contrary to those who said to bland or too oily or not carmelized enough - if you use your experience - it's great - if you don't you get what they said. I only had one small head on hand but added parboiled potatoes (cut in chunks after boiling) as well as a bit of crushed red pepper. The other *very* imporatant thing is that your oven is calibrated - or you at least know it's nuances by using an oven thermometer. This dish needs every bit if the heat to carmelize and roast. It's VERY good. You have to use these recipes as guides - not the gospel! Jon

This is an acceptable cauliflower dish, my family liked it & I'll make it again. However, roasted cauliflower doesn't result in thesame sweet, rich, carmelized flavour that you get from roasting vegetable like yams, squash, carrots, parsnips, red peppers etc. It's ok.

Really good. The cauliflower gets soft, the garlic crunchy. More than the sum of its parts.

I cut this recipe down to one head of cauliflower since I was only serving two but added 4 chunky sliced portebello mushrooms. What a great vegetarian main course. My husband was late for dinner and I had a hard time saving enough for him.

time consuming breaking cauliflower bits, I found it too garlicky and I love garlic so I may cut back what the recipe says - and also cut back on the oil that combo made it to rich/garlicky for my taste- I didn't get the raves some other folks did on it- it was liked but not loved.

A great way to cook cauliflower instead of simply boiling it. I couldn't get enough of it. It even impressed my husband who did not like it just boiled and he wants me to cook cauliflower like this from now on. My 4 and 5 year old kids liked it too. You really can't beat the olive oil and garlic combination and the preparation is incredibly simple.

Rating: 4
I have been making this dish for a long time without exact measurements for the ingredients. The way I have prepared it is to slice the cauliflower head into 1/4" slices so that each slice lookls like a "tree." Doing it this way causes the cauliflower to almost caramelize in the oven and it is yummy. The next day it is also quite good tossed in a salad, that is if you have any leftovers!

Rating: 3
This is a delicious way to prepare cauliflower. I've made it several times since I initially tried the recipe in December, '01. For color and a little variety I roasted carrots along with the cauliflower and it was a nice combination. To achieve a nice "browning" on the edges, I often had to cook mine more than the prescribed time.

Its hard to imagine cauliflower tasting so good. I made this my family of four, using one cauliflower head. I added some hot paprika and white pepper to the recipe to spice it up a bit, and sliced the garlic as recommended. We were fighting over the leftovers - next time I will use two heads!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a great recipe. I made it twice - including once this past Thanksgiving. It is so easy, and brings out the delicious nutty flavor in the garlic. When I read the recipe I was concerned the cauliflower wouldn't soften up, that it would just get crunchy or something, because there's not much liquid in the recipe, but it turned out perfect. I didn't make any modifications. I think starting with a perfect head of cauliflower and very good olive oil is important here.

Rating: 3
Never occured to me to roast cauliflower and I was pleasantly surprised. But, this recipe only becomes great with additional roasting time. I left mine in at least 10 minutes longer if not 15-20. At that point the cauliflower had golden-browned enough to get a good roasted flavour. It probably could have stayed in even longer, wasn't burnt at all. In summary, a great IDEA, but the RECIPE itself needs work! Next I will try using the roasted cauli in my favourite cauliflower ginger soup recipe...

This tasted OK but I thought it was nothing special. I've never been a big cooked cauliflower fan (although I adore Alice Water's French Cream of Cauliflower soup in her Chez Panisse Vegetables cookbook). I probably won't make this again.

The cauliflower turned out limp. Maybe cut down on the olive oil next time? Don't know, but will experiment with additional vegetables. People took a bite and dumped the rest. Oh well.

We liked it but didn't love it. A friend who enjoys most vegetables but has never liked cauliflower noted his approval, saying, "If you're going to (have to) eat cauliflower, THIS is certainly the way to do it!" Great if you eat a variety of veggies, and cauliflower's turn comes around with a supermarket's "buy one, get one free" deal. Ours was rather limp, even having started with a fresh, crisp head; perhaps because our pieces were ~1" rather than the 2"called for. PS- throwing in some diced red or green bell pepper near end of roasting time would give it appealing color, (orange pepper at Thksgvg, thin diagonal slices of celery, etc); or a sprinkling of paprika or cumin, etc. PPS -If it is not a big hit, toss in blender with some cooked squash or other veggie, (fat-free) half-&-half, bit of broth, and favorite seasonings, and call it soup. Serve with toasted cheese sandwich or crusty, seasoned crouton chunks. ...Or throw in blender and use as a nutritious "paste" spread on tortillas (think 'refried beans') for veggie sandwich wraps or enchiladas/etc! I'll definitely make again, but only if cauliflower is on sale.

Outstanding flavor and easy to make. At the end of the prescribed baking time, the cauliflower was cooked but not very browned. Accordingly, I turned my oven to "broil" and let it cook for another 5 minutes or so. Next time, I might try to increase the "broiling" time even further, perhaps with a corresponding reduction in the baking time. Definitely a great way to enjoy cauliflower!

I made this as part of a roasted vegetable platter for a small Christmas party: I used one head of cauliflower, tossed it in the oil and salt and pepper and put it in the oven for 20 minutes. Minced a couple of HUGE cloves of garlic and stirred that into the cauliflower after the 20 minutes. Finished when the cauliflower began to brown and caramelize in spots. Delicious!!!! It was the second thing to disappear off the table (after the roasted asparagus that was also on my veggie platter)! And so easy to make. I'll definitely be making this again -- for myself!

This was so easy and delicious that I plan to use this recipe often. I kicked it up a notch by using seasoned pepper. Next time I will try adding the garlic at the end so it doesn't burn. My traditional recipe is to melt about 1 Tb. butter and add seasoned breadcrumbs & cook & stir a minute or two. Then toss it with steamed or microwaved cauliflower. Yummy. Also, always season with Kosher salt(like on TV) never table salt. Makes any veggie better.

This couldn't be any easier and since there's not a lot of ingredients, you really taste the cauliflower. I recommend half way through the cooking, you turn the flowerets so they don't brown too much on one side.

This is probably the best way I've found to make cauliflower. I was cooking for 2 so I used about half a large head and 1 T of olive oil. I added cherry tomatoes and plenty of salt and served it with rice and chicken curry. (By the way I highly recommend the Food and Wine recipe.) The garlic did get a little crispy but I still thought it tasted good. Could probably be amended by cutting it in larger pieces.

Perhaps I was expecting too much, based on prior reviews, but I just didn't think this was that great. I adjusted the recipe to make one head of cauliflower (we like the veggie, just don't need that much). It seemed rather bland, even with the addition of extra salt, and the garlic ended up too brown and slightly bitter before the cauliflower was done. I love roasted vegetables, and will probably roast cauliflower again, but not this way.

Roasted cauliflower is awesome! It is actually my favorite roasted veggie. Also great if you roast it with some sliced shallots or red onions and finish it off with freshly grated parmesan. I would also say don't only roast it till golden, but until slightly charred around the edges!

I make this dish often, sometimes including curry powder in the mix. Also, I find a good deal of salt is necessary to bring out all the flavors. I have the best luck when I separate all of the florets into reasonably small sizes, leaving very littly stem on each. The florets will roast quickly, so test your cauliflower after as little as 12-15 minutes for crispness.
