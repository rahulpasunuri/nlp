works great with plain old broccoli, too!

So good! We loved this. My only change was to use a cup of veg stock in place of the water and a 1/2 tsp of sriracha (garlic chili sauce) in place of the chili flakes. The sauce was delicious and the broccoflower consistency is perfect. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will add a bit more garlic. By the way, most might know this, but just in case (for those who don't): Broccoflower is the same thing as green cauliflower. It just depends on what brand your grocer carries. Try this, you'll love it.

Wow! This was delicious. I gave the recipe to my friend with a 2 yr old that hates veggies and loves this dish. Now that is something. Easy to make and tasty. Trader Joe's sells Broccoflower for $1.99, what a bargain!

Excellent! This is a great way to search broccoflower. It is even better made a day earlier so the flavors can soak in. My husband ask for this weekly ;-)

I crossed this recipe with Broccoflower with Anchovies and garlic: I cooked the broccoflower in florets for about 10-15 minutes, drained it, then stir-fried it in olive oil with pine nuts and garlic, and balsamic vinegar. I then topped it with parmesan cheese (I forgot the basil). It was good.

i used cauliflower instead of broccoflower and it was delicious. i didn't find it that spicy and next i will up the chili flakes. It is a nice change to plain ol' steamed veggies.

What a great way to spice up broccoli! I used broccoli instead of broccoflower, and it was great! We love broccoli, but it tends to be a bit boring, but not anymore! Be sure to be careful with the peppers - I used a pich more than recommended and it was HOT! Yum! Yum!
