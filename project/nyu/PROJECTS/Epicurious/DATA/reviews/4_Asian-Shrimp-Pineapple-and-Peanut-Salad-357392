I made this for a gourmet dining club, and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. When I first made this I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a bit too salty tasting. I then tweaked it by substituting half of the fish sauce with soy sauce, and used sesame oil in place of the olive oil. The flavors blended beautifully. Some said it was one of the best dishes brought in the history of the club!

We made this as a side dish to a thai chicken curry dish, so we omitted the shrimp. I'm also not crazy about fish sauce, so I left that out as well. It was a simple, tasty side dish and we will be making it again for sure! It was delicious! Best of all, the sweetness of the pineapple satisfied my sweet tooth so I wasn't craving dessert afterwards!

Unlike the other reviewers, we followed this recipe exactly and it was inedible. We made it the night before and ate it the next day - this was probably the source of the problem. The shrimp literally turned to mush- they were the same consistancy as an avocado. Weird. The flavors that were present when it was first prepared had dissipated and only the pineapple was distinguishable. I think instead of fish sauce I would have used sesame oil to add an Asian flavor, but I won't be making it again. Horrifying. I made this for a dinner party. What an embarassment!

Made this Friday night followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce recipe and served over rice noodles. It was spectacular. I will increase the jalapeño as it didn't have quite enough heat for my husband and I. Great flavors.

I eat a lot of salads and love to change up recipes for Lunch. So I tried this one today and loved it! Simple, fulfills the Asian craving, and just plain good, I highly recommended this one!

This was a huge hit when I made dinner for my friends the other night. Everyone loved the flavors. I used mix organic greens with the shrimp/avocado mixture before adding the dressing and turned out nicely!

Wonderful! Such a unique combination of flavors. I substituted soy sauce for the fish sauce as I couldn't find that and added double the amount of peanuts. Also cooked the shrimp on skewers on the grill and removed the tail from them before adding to the salad. I brought this to a barbecue to share and my husband overheard someone saying they would like to get this recipe. I will make it again and again!

Made this tonight and LOVED it! Based on the other reviews I sauteed my frozen shrimp with olive oil and garlic first, but otherwise followed the directions closely. Had them with spring rolls on the side and it was a wonderful meal!

This was an incredible flavor combination! I did alter the recipe though. I boiled the shrimp in crab boil to give it an extra kick! (we like our food spicy in Louisiana!)I didn't use any fish sauce, since the sound of that made me fear it would ruin the dish. I substituted soy sauce instead. I used Splenda instead of the sugar, and cashews instead of peanuts. I also served it over baby spinach leaves. It was delicious! Great summertime dinner salad!

We really liked this dish. I added a little soy sauce to the dressing & used 1/2 the fish sauce (although I think the next time I'll use the full 2 tbls for more flavor). Also used a 16 oz pkg of cocktail size shrimp (have a big strapping husband to feed) & cashews instead of peanuts. Served it over mixed greens.

This recipe was ok. I think if i were to make this again I would make some changes. I already had used only half of the fish sauce, per prior suggestions, which was plenty. Next time I would try using raw shrimp and sauté them w/ the shallots and s/p for added flavor. I'm hoping that this would bump up the flavor a little. Good ingredients, just not the umph I was hoping for.

I followed the other suggestions and reduced the fish sauce slightly and sauteed fresh shrimp sprinkled with salt, crushed red pepper and a little squirt of lime juice in a hot pan with some peanut oil. I also used half olive oil and half sesame oil for the recommended amount and served over Jasmine Rice... Result - DELICIOUS! This will definitely be made at my house again. Even my 4 year old and 2 year old loved it. (I only gave it 3 forks because I altered the recipe.)

This recipe was decent... but I'd say definitely cook your shrimp fresh... it'd probably be really great if you could grill the shrimp first or something. I used frozen shrimp and it's definitely missing a bit of the fresh taste I was hoping for.

This was pretty easy and very tasty! I bought the shrimp cooked already, and cut down on the fish sauce, but overall it was great. I incorporated lettuce to give it more of a salad feel and add some crunch. Very refreshing!

This recipe is great but if I make it again I'll cut back on the fish sauce, it was a little salty.

This is a really simple, super dish! I did have to add a little more sugar to get the fish sauce balanced in the dressing, but other than that it was a wonderful surprise served simply with jasmine rice. The kids even liked it more than they thought they would!

For the amount of work (hardly any!) this produces great results. Delicious & healthy. Great for week nights! I used slightly less fish sauce than recipe calls for.

Fabulous Salad ! We reduced fish sauce in half, grilled the shrimp and used cashews instead of peanuts as we had them on hand. Will try over greens next time. Enjoy!

Mmmm ... refreshing and flavourful. Try it over a bed of lettuce for presentation. One of my new fave recipes!

Wonderful salad! I added some bean sprouts because they were on hand and served over greens. May use a little less fish sauce next time. Refreshing, tasty salad.

Super quick, super tasty. I sauted raw jumbo shrimp in peanut oil, red pepper flakes, garlic for a little extra flavour and omitted the Avocado simply because I don't care for it. It took all of 10 or 15 minutes to make a yummy supper. I would have gone for 4 forks, but without the avocado, I don't feel I can rate the whole recipe.
