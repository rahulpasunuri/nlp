I have made this recipe no less than 20 times and absolutely love it. For variety, try it with tofu instead of sea bass - still fabulous, though you'll need to spice it up with red pepper or Chinese hot oil. The leftover coconut- curry sauce is fantastic over steamed vegetables and brown rice.

ugh, I don't know...I wanted to like this recipe so much based off of the ingredients and rave reviews, but I just didn't like it. The marinade was so overpowering, I couldn't even taste the naturally beautiful flavors of the fish. And I thought the coconut-curry was bleh kinda plain, even with the addition of extra thai chili paste. There are better asian seafood recipes out there.

OMG - ok, so I've made Thai food before so very familiar with making a curry sauce. The sauce here is fantastic - kind of like gravy but with curry. I did not add as much cream as I know curry doesn't need it. Was nice a thick - next time I'll add more coconut and less cream. I made this with Salmon as I needed to eat it. Amazing. Was very very beautiful. Only thing I would add is a spritz of fresh lime at the end. Otherwise, fantastic! Enjoy.

I followed the recipe adding the 1/2 c Mirin and it was great. Will make it again! Cocunt Curry was great too although I had to cook longer, like 30 min, in order to get it thick as I live at high altitude. I've made red & green curry before so I tossed in the curry with the cocunut. In fact, might suggest a quick toasting of the curry before adding as that brings out the aroma and flavor more intensly.

My husband *loved* it (with green curry sauce) and I thought it was good not great. A little too heavy (greasy?) for me.

FIRST OF ALL THIS RECIPE IS MISSING THE FIRST INGREDIENT. IT SHOULD READ: 1/2 CUP MIRIN. I happened to have the magazine and looked it up when the directions referred to the first "7" ingredients. Another rave review. I made the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing. The flavors of the marinade and the curry sauce work well together and I can't imagine doing one without the other. Served with jasmine rice and baby bok choy.

Cooked this recipe last night - WOW! It was absolutely amazing! Cook's notes: I used red miso in the marinade (didn't have yellow) and for the coconut curry sauce I used half as much cream, omitted the lemongrass and used a little more red curry. It was fantastic, my guests were sopping up the sauce with bread. I served it with jasmine rice, bok choy and shiitakes. It's definitely going in my recipe box.

SOOOO good! I had to use halibut instead of sea bass, and I got regular "white" miso (couldn't find yellow), and marinated it for about 6 hours. AMAZING! Huge hit! This is a keeper!

This dish is spectacular. It is labeled as a 'crowd pleaser' in the Bon Appetit cook book, and it was. I prepared the dish to the letter using green curry paste and served it with bok choy, jasmine rice and a Thai cucumber salad. The fish was delicious in itself and the sauce definitely had a good kick so I don't understand the "bland" comments. I did not marinate the fish overnight yet found it full of flavor after about 4 hours while not overpowering the sea bass. The sauce is rich but you don't have to use much to add wonderful flavor.

I didn't think this recipe was worth collecting all of the ingredients. It was a little bland in my opinion. There are so many better fish recipes on this site - if you're looking for something slightly different, I recommend the Summer Seafood Stew.

Add another rave review to this recipe. Marinating the fish overnight is a great suggestion. Though I loved the sauce, i could also see the merit in letting the marinade and the fish stand alone. I may try that and black cod next time. Served it with coconut rice.

We thought this dish was wonderful. The marinade is perfect as is, but I could not bring myself to add 2 cups of cream to the sauce. I reduced the cream to 1/2 cup, used 1 cup of light coconut milk, and one teaspoon of red curry ---the sauce was delicous and perfect for my family's taste. I slow roasted the sea bass at 300 degrees for about 25 - 30 minutes. Served w/couscous and steamed broccolini and green beans. Delicious!

It was alright. Not the raves like everyone said. My only substitution was mellow red miso instead of yellow. Not sure if that would make the difference. We actually liked the coconut curry sauce better than the fish.

Well, sorry to be the "odd man out". After all of the rave reviews, maybe I expected too much, but I was truly disappointed in this dish...especially at $20 a pound for sea bass! My visiting guests thought it was good, but they can't get fresh seafood in markets where they live. It just didn't float my boat. Guess it's okay once in awhile considering that everything else on Epicurious has always been wonderful. I'm only adding my review since I usually write very positive comments.

I have made this recipe several times now...first time with the coconut curry sauce, the other times without. The sauce is great, but i find that the fish with the sake marinade is just perfect. It compliments the delicious flavor of the sea bass without covering up the taste of the fish itself. I serve it on jasmine rice. I boil the remaining marinade to heat it and thicken it just slightly and spoon it over the fish and rice. My favorite recipe from this site, for sure!

This really is a good dish, incredibly rich as you've heard from previous reviewers. Much more sweet than the traditional idea of curry, and pink instead of golden.

This was fabulous....almost like something i would get at a restaurant. I tried to cut back on calories by using the low-fat coconut milk, and, though the sauce was still good, it was a bit thin for my tastes. I also marinated my fish overnight, and it was wonderful.

This was wonderful. I marinated the sea bass overnight and it was so flavorful. I served it with steamed baby bok choy with mushrooms cooked in white wine and the rice with bonito flakes. Yummy! I have to admit that I ended up dipping bread in the sauce the next day and finishing all of my leftovers.

For time constraints, I made only the marinated sea bass(without the curry sauce). It was excellent, and I thought the marinade amount was just right for 6 sea bass filets. I served it with "mashed potatoes with prosciutto and parmesan cheese", another fine recipe. My guests were very pleased. Will definitely make this one again.

Outstanding! I cut down on the red curry paste but next time will bring it closer to the amount given. We will use the remaining sauce for curried shrimp. Everything about this recipe was wonderful and we will definitely make it again and again. I would not hesitate to serve this to guests.

I readily admit that I am a finicky food snob who usually discounts the rave reviews on this site. But you can believe what you read on this one! This dish will not disappoint. I am a professionally trained cook and my husband said this was the best thing I have ever made. I used black cod instead of sea bass and marinated it for 8 hours. The fish itself is somewhat similar to Nobu's black cod. My only regret is that I used pre-made green curry; next time I will make my own. There are recipes on this site, and I think it would add another level to the dish. The curry paste was EXTREMELY spicy, so I would add less, and keep adjusting to taste. The heat is nice against the sweetness of the fish, but if you're not careful it can easily become too much. I also strained the sauce. I served this with braised baby bok choy and roasted carrots tossed in sesame oil, and garnished the plate with some cilantro oil. I highly recommend it!

This dish was excellent. Even the people who don't like fish, liked this dish.

This dish was extremely delicious, but in consideration of the cost of the ingredients, it should be. It was rather annoying to prepare a large amount of marinade, when according to the recipe, most of it goes unused. Not wanting to just throw it out I used some to baste the sea bass when it was baking, and also used it to cook an accompanying vegetable dish, to make use of the great flavour!

This is the most fabulous fish recipe I have ever made. I made this for two friends, both of whom are incredible cooks -- one called the next morning to say she was still "dreaming" about the meal! A definite keeper.

I have been trying to duplicate a fabulous sea bass dish I had in Napa Valley, and this is as close as it gets! Make sure you use a good Sake and marinate at least 24 hours for optimum results. Don't overcook the fish and make plenty of sauce because it's delicious!

After reading the reviews, I risked this for a party of ten. Tracked down every ingredient quite easily and it was well worth the effort. Added only a little red Thai chili paste to "kick it up a notch" since it is a little sweet. An amazing marinade for a fabulous fish and the spectacular coconut curry is well worth the addition. A winner without a doubt!

We had a pan-Asian-themed dinner party for 40+ and took the risk of making this dish without having tested it first (the "test kitchen" had been too busy testing all the hors d'oeuvres, a.k.a. the pu-pu platter). A HUGE hit. Normally at this party the meat entree goes first; this time the sea bass was virtually gone in no time. We followed the recipe exactly and it worked beautifully. And, with the sauce made earlier that day, making the fish during the party was pretty painless.

The marinade was perfect. The curry sauce was even better (I strained the sauce and that was a good move.) I used cod and it was good but sea bass would have been better. Served with blanched asparagus but any green vegetable would have been fine. I had to make the sauce with homemade red curry paste, substituting annatto powder for the red chilies to get the red color because my little guy can't take the heat. If you can find the fresh ingredients (galangal, lemongrass, ginger, kaffir lime leaves) it's not much more work than ready-made curry paste and smells much better. I made one batch and froze small portions in little plastic bags for many more meals.

I am a caterer and served this to a group of 60-not easy to do-but got rave reviews. Have had many requests for it since. Will agree, ingredients difficult to track down, but worth all the trouble. Delicious!! Orchid blossoms make a gorgeous garnish!

I have made this dish several times and would not substitute any ingredients. However, if lemongrass is not available, zest would be a reasonable alternative. Highly recommended!!!

Excellent! Several of my dinner guests claimed it was the best meal they had ever had. Had a tough time finding all of the ingredients in Lima, but we managed to track them all down, and well worth the time. What a wonderful blend of everything.

Heaven on a plate. Getting the ingredients is much like going on a scavenger hunt--but well worth it. For Manhattan cooks, you can get everything but the lemongrass at Fairway on B'way &74th and they often have lemongrass nextdoor at Citarella (you can always find it a the small grogery off the SW corner of B'way & 80th near Zabars).

This is an amazingly flavorul dish - a great way to cook sea bass. I have already made this twice and am making it for a third time for a dinner party this week-end.
