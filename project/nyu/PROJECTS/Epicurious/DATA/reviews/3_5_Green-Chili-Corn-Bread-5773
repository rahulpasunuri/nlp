This was delicious! I made it for New Years Eve with a Cajun shrimp dish. Any type of chilies would probably work. That's the only time consuming part of this dish. I thought this was easy to make.

If you're looking to cut back on the calories, I just accidentally made this without the butter and it still turned out great!

Very interesting and fresh-tasting recipe. Non or low fat Philadelphia works well instead of the mayo if you don't want the extra fat and calories. It's mainly only supplying creaminess.... My only suggestion is to use a more 'Southern', and indeed more Mexican, approach to cornbread. My mother and grandmother made the most fantastic cornbread and never used sugar or eggs. Combine the chopped Poblanos 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal, 1/2 cup flour, the baking powder and soda, 1 1/2 tsp sea salt, no cheese and just enough buttermilk to make a fairly thick batter. Don't stir more than necessary. Place the butter, cut into pieces onto a large oven sheet with edges. This goes into an oven that's as hot as it will go. When the butter is melted remove the sheet from the oven and spoon about 2 tbs butter into the batter. Pour the batter onto the sheet and spread out to a thin (1/2 inch) mass. Spoon the melted butter which will have pooled around the edges over the batter. Place in the over until the bread is deep brown....but not black, of course. This is truly an example of simple ingredients yielding something fantastic! The bread has a delicious thick and crunchy crust and is light and airy inside..... and tastes of corn.

I don't understand everybody using canned chilis! Almost as bad as prepared garlic out of a jar! The taste is definitely altered (for the worse). Maybe because my mother was from New Mexico, and a canned chili was tantamount to sacrilege. I'm about to make this recipe tomorrow, because I happened to have already roasted and peeled some Anaheims. I had one with some lime juice and salt as an accompaniment to chicken salad for lunch, but my favorite way is on rye bread with Velveeta (an old family favorite). Pack it in a brown bag and don't refrigerate it, and have it with Hawaiian style potato chips!

My guest loved, loved this recipe. I didn't know cornbread could bring so many compliments. I took the advice of other reviews and used 3 seeded jalapeno peppers and canned green chilies.

I don't bake very often but I wanted to make something yummy and slightly easy for the BCS game against Auburn. (I made a bunch of green and yellow food! GO DUCKS!) It was really easy to prepare and I used the poblanos which weren't too spicy and it was easy for everyone to enjoy! I would recommend this to the unexperienced baker and experienced alike. Next time I make it I will try the canned chiles.

A bit dry for my taste, but the spicy was just right. Will make it again next year

Very nice cornbread recipe. I substituted canned green chilies and a generous pinch of dried chipotle for the poblanos. It only took 30 minutes to bake and had a nice crisp crust. I found it to be pretty sweet for a savory cornbread, which I really enjoyed.

Very nice cornbread recipe. It only took 30 minutes to bake, so make sure you check on it. I substituted canned green chillies and a generous pinch of crush dried chipotle. I found that it was pretty sweet for a savory cornbread, which I enjoyed.

I've had plenty of cornbread in my life, and this is by far the best I've had or have made! I made a few slight adjustments after reading the reviews.I had no poblanos so I made it with canned green chilis (4 oz can) and added some sauteed green onions with the tops, along with a pinch of chipotle paste for additional heat. Delish! My husband raved and this is a new staple in our house! Went well with the black bean soup we had for dinner, as well as the scrambled eggs the next morning.

Excellent recipe! I baked it in a round metal cake pan for 30 minutes and substituted Hatch green chiles for the poblanos. Very moist and easy to make. No more Jiffy mix for me!

This recipe, if you check and make sure to test it as you go, is one of the most moist and flavorful cornbreads you will get. I would suggest cooking in a well-greased iron pan, though you can get good results in a loaf pan also. I use jalepenos, simply chopped with most of the seeds removed and it cooks up very nice.

This is a great recipe for a savory corn bread. I also did a variation substituting a green jalapeño, 3-4 chipotles and a tablespoon of chipotle adobo for the poblanos. That too was pretty good, in a fiery hot way. Both versions were a hit at the party I took them to.

This cornbread was delicious. I omitted the chilis and added chopped scallions instead. I also used a pre-shredded lite mexican cheese mix. I used a 9 x 13 pan which made the baking time considerably shorter than using a loaf pan. Both adults and kids really liked it.

This was the second corn bread I'd made. It was the moistest cornbread I've ever eatten. We had extra Pepperjack cheese, so I used that insteand of Sharp.

I truly loved this cornbread recipe. Instead of making it in a loaf pan, I baked it in a hot cast iron skillet to create a really delicious crust. It's not as sweet as most commercial cornbread, but I much prefer it that way. To make it a bit healthier, I've made it with whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, and 1.5 tablespoons olive oil instead of the butter. It still tasted great.

I forgot to put the cheese in (since I've never made cornbread that called for cheese) and it was fantastic. We LOVED it, and loved it without even putting the smoked chicken on it (which was also yummy).

This cornbread kind of blows, unfortunately. Whether it's the type of cheese called for or the amount, I can't be sure. I won't make this recipe again.

This was good, but I was hoping for something sweeter. Oh, well. I'll keep looking.

My husband told me to throw away all other cornbread recipes after tasting this one! Need I say more?

Made this bread for a BBQ that I hosted. It was the 1st item to run out. A major hit.

I made this for a chili party. It was pretty average, but did zip up the classic chili side.

This corn bread no only is good with the smoked chicken salad, but on its own is wonderful!! I will definately make this bread again. It was so easy and had such a beautiful flavor!! I new twist to the traditional corn bread!!
