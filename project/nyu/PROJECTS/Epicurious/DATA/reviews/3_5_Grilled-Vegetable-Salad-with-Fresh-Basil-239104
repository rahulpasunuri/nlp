Didn't have japanese eggplants or enough fresh basil, used extra zucchini and dried basil, and a bit of marjoram. The garlic clove was very large, next time I will use just a bit less. It was very good, even the family who are not big fans of any squash really enjoyed it. This is the kind of recipe that easily changes based on what you have on hand. The tomatoes are a must, I removed the skin after grilling and squeezed out a few of the seeds before chopping. Can't wait for really good summer produce to make this again. And with the japanese eggplant next time.

I found this didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked. (Must note: the friend that I cooked for really enjoyed the dish.) I think it needs more garlic, a lot of salt and pepper, and maybe some dried basil to go with the fresh.
