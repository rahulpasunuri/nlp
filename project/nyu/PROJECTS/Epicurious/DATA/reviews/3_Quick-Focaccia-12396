This recipe is horrid. I followed the ingredients, and following recommendations here I let the dough rise a full hour. What I got would serve well as crackers, but is NOT focaccia. This is neither quick, nor focaccia.

I thought this tasted quite good - I allowed a slightly longer rising time (about an hour) - mine was still pretty flat. I'm going to make it again this afternoon and allow a much longer rise to see what that does. I think it would make a decent pizza crust too.

The flavor was good, the texture not perfect. I didn't read the reviews first, otherwise I would've allowed more rising time. It is not exactly sandwich style. It was difficult to slice for a sandwich. Next time I'd allow at least an hour for rising. Add more water, and perhaps more yeast.

Delicious and easy. It did come out flatter than I would like. Does anyone know how to remedy this.

We enjoyed this. I did use close to 1 C. water and let rise for about 2x longer than time listed here. Very generouly doused the top of the wet loaf w/ olive oil before I sprinkled it very liberally with salt, pepper, and parmessan. Perfect with pasta.

Had to give this four forks...I lost my excellent flatbread recipe a while back, and after reading the reviews here, knew I'd found it, even though it's called "focaccia." If you're using "highly active" yeast, or rapid rise yeast, there's no reason whatsoever to use an entire packet or to proof it. May be the reason the OP felt it was too yeasty. Threw all ingredients, sans the last 3, in my KA mixer, kneaded a couple minutes, let it rise/rest in the bowl about 10 mins, threw it on parchment with more flour since it was sticky (BTW, MUST use at least 1 whole cup water) in the pan, mashing it out to shape of pan, let it rest/rise another 30" and baked it with some Asiago, basil & oregano on top. AWESOME! May not be focaccia, but makes a perfect flatbread for pizza dough! Made a pizza with fresh mozz., cilantro leaves, red onion, match slices of poblano pepper and more asiago, coarse salt. Gone in less than 10 mins!

not very good, hard and dry.

You HAD to add more water, there wasn't enough, I made it a full cup and used my ususal high gluten bread flour (which does wonderfully for the taste) and let it rise a bit longer than 30 mins. I liked it, though I have a more complicated focaccia recipe that I think is a little tastier.

Don't expect spongy, light focaccia; but, for the amount of time and effort that goes into the bread, it definitely gets the job done and then some. I was pretty liberal with the parmesan and rosemary. I also added some thyme.

Nope. I've never given only "one fork" before but this was very disappointing. It was too flat and hard for my taste, although it was ok and we ate it all. I put rosemary and parm on the top which is what redeemed it. Gave it 40 min to rise. This was more like a flatbread, and I prefer a softer, fluffier, chewy type foccacia myself.

I found this recipe a bit dry. Also, not sure what I did wrong but it didn't rise very well.

This was sooo good, and easy, too! I topped it with some dried Rosemary and Thyme, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion slices, and some fresh basil. Wonderful! I let it rise for 40 min, as was suggested by someone else, but it was fully baked after 20 min.

Very easy to make and very tasty. This is an easily adaptable menu. I've tried it adding sun-dried tomatoes and also black olives and it's great!

I am not sure if it was the quick acting yeast or just the recipe but we got hard tack not bread

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the bread had a strong yeasty flavor, and was kind of flat. I think I'll stick to my other focaccia recipe next time.

This is a versatile recipe that I now experiment by adding ingredients on a regular basis. It is also very good w/just course salt and lightly oiled surface sans anything else. It is fun to add things to the dough though including jalapeno, basil, thyme, whatever you have handy. I think the time for the dough to rise is probably a little short. i usually let it go 40 minutes, and cook it longer 25-30 minutes. Excellent, easy, try it!

I'd never made anything with yeast, and was a little intimidated to do so now, but my fears were unnecessary. This bread turned out to be great!
