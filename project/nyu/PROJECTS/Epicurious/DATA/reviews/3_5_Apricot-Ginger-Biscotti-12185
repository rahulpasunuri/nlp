I agree with others that this recipe is very wet; you end up working some more flour into it when it is kneaded. I usually add a tablespoon or two of melted butter - I wanted a low cal recipe but also wanted it to taste good. The result tastes great, and provides a very substantial dessert for not many calories. I've made it many times and people have always liked it. I'm going to try it this time with dried cherries and almonds instead of the apricot and ginger. If you want the very hard, dense, teeth breaking kind of biscotti, this is not the one though, it has a lighter texture than that.

As stated, this dough is certainly sticky. So sticky, that it's impossible to knead in the traditional way. I poured it on a heavily floured board and scraped it up and over until it finally assumed a manageable enough mass to transfer to the cookie sheet and form into a loaf, but not a 6 1/2 x 4 1/2 - as that width would spread out to about 8 inches wide, but about 3 inches wide. And since there is so little egg wash, why direct the baker to use only SOME of the egg wash? The final result is a tasty combination of apricot and ginger, crisp on the outside and softer on the inside. We prefer our biscotti crisp all the way through - therefore I will continue to look for the more traditional recipes .

I am a BIG fan of biscotti, and these were inedible. Though I originally made them for holiday gifts (along with ~12 other biscotti's, this one will go down the garbage disposal. Truly horrible -- and expensive -- 12 cookies?! There are plenty of terrific recipes for biscotti at this site, so don't use this one.

This recipe produced very light, soft biscotti, not the dense, well-toasted biscuits customarily served in coffee bars. The flavor was also quite mild. I would recommend chopping the fruit more finely to distribute it more evenly, because the texture of the bits of fruit clashed with the texture of the biscotti. If you like bits of fruit, chop them coarsely and consider adding more. I would have liked a stronger ginger flavor. I also had trouble working the "dough" because it was so sticky; I ended up arranging and pressing it onto the cookie sheet.

This was my first attempt @ biscotti-making -- pretty good. Per previous suggestions, I did not knead the dough, but a little more flour and air prob would have done some good.

So easy and delicious! The only modification I make (aside from not kneading, as previously mentioned) is to chop apricots coarsely, not finely -- otherwise they get completely pulverized by the electric mixture, and I prefer little bits of fruit in the end product.

I guess I am not a fan of candied ginger. They turned out well but I just did not care for the flavor. I prefer the anise biscotti instead.

This resulted in a very wet dough that simply couldn't be kneaded by hand. I simply "poured" it on the cookie sheet and shaped it into a flat loaf. The texture of these biscotti were fantastic. (The ones with butter come out too dense). I am going to use this basic recipe and use other ingredients to create other flvored biscottis (e.g. nuts, chocolate, etc.)

This recipe is great...producing biscotti that look like those at my favorite coffee bar for lots less! I sprinkled the log with sugar crystals after the egg wash for an even nicer presentation.

OK, the recipe says 'dough will be sticky'. How sticky?? There was no way I could have kneaded mine, it would have been like making mud pies! I don't have an electric mixer; would the gluten have developed more and the dough stiffened if I'd been using something other than my poor li'l arms, or is this how it's supposed to be? In the end I beat in some more flour, and they turned out OK, but I'm not sure that I did the right thing. I can imagine the texture(and taste) would have been more like shop bought if I'd omitted the extra flour, but I was scared it wouldn't stay on the baking tray! I'll definitely make them again, but I'd like others' input on the texture this dough (batter?) was supposed to have. They were definitely good, though. (Note I'm sticking to Epicurious's guidelines: ** means 'liked, not loved' rather than 'heinously disappointing' ;)

Very nice. I would suggest blending the ginger so you're not surprised don't biting into a piece, otherwise, no changes.

One night I had a craving for chocolate biscotti. I did not have butter and didn't feel like going out to get any. So I used this recipe and substitued about 1/8 c flour for cocoa powder. Delicious! Next time, I'll try the original recipe.

This is a great recipe. I make it and give in in a basket with jam , lemon curd and pear butter at Christmas. ( not to eat with the biscotti )It always wins a rave revue. Great with a cup of coffee or even tea when friends stop by. TRY IT !

I've made this twice now, both times used slivered, toasted almonds instead of ginger since I don't have crystallized ginger. My biscotti were better the second time since I cut the slices thinner (a 'scant' 1/2 inch), so they got crispier. I skipped the kneading step the 2nd time - too messy! Just spooned batter from bowl to baking sheet & spatula-d it into shape. Great recipe!

I added 3/4 cup of whole almonds with skins and substituted 1/2 cup chopped crystallized ginger instead of 2 Tb. Now it turned out great!!! My wife raved about it.

This is the best thing I've done in years. It's delicious and creative (you can use any additions that you like); it's low in fat; everytime I see biscotti for sale at about a dollar apiece, I feel like an economic genius. It makes a great gift too.

Delicious and easy, and people love the fact that they're low fat. I've subbed cranberries and pistachios for the ginger and almond, and that was great too!

Wonderful! Guests love it! You can replace the ginger and apricot with anything - I've tried chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and dried cranberries, among others, and they were all delicious.
