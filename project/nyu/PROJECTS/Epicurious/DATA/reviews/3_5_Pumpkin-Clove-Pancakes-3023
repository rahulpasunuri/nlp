Excellent. Avoiding wheat, I used white spelt flour. Also used powdered buttermilk (mixed with the dry ingredients). Water substituted for the buttermilk volume in the liquids. The batter was just a tad thin, but the pancakes (many!) were delicious. I like the simplicity of just clove.

I have made these many many times since 1996-- it's always one of my most requested breakfasts. The pumpkin makes the pancakes very moist w/out needing a ton of butter in the batter (and I vary the amount of butter depending on how tight my pants are feeling, and they are good w/out any added butter in the mix!) Sometimes I turn these into Pumpkin Souffle pancakes by separating the eggs, whipping the whites and folding them in to the batter, and that makes them fluffier.

These pancakes don't taste horrible--they are edible but the batter is WAY to thick, too eggy and not worth the trouble. I will not be making them again.

Yum! I doubled the recipe, using half whole wheat pastry flour. The cloves were a tad bit strong for me, maybe I shouldn't have quite doubled them. We had no syrup, but the flavor and sweetness of these pancakes required none, just a bit of butter and they were heavenly!

great flavor, way too eggy!

These pancakes were excellent; the family loved them. I added some finely chopped toasted pecans that were on hand; they added a nice crunch. Used 1 c. AP flour and 1c. white whole wheat flour and texture was still light. Not a big fan of cloves so made some adjustments to the spices - used vanilla,cinnamon and nutmeg and reduced the cloves. Served with sauteed apple slices and maple syrup. They could have used a dollop of whipped cream on top for color.

These are fabulous! To make them a little healthier, I used 1/2 c ap flour and 1 1/2 c white whole wheat flour and canola oil instead of the butter. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and the flavor really shone through. My husband said these should be our everyday pancake recipe!

This was a big batch so I will be eating it tomorrow for the third day in a row. I will also be making it next week and the next and the next because it is my new favorite breakfast in the world!

Pretty good but I needed to make these changes: Reduced cloves to 1/4 tsp. Added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla. I needed to use a little extra buttermilk to thin the batter. Also, I spread pancakes on the thinner side as the batter was fairly dense and needed sufficient time to cook thoroughly. Also, I think that whipped cream on top and maybe diced fruit better compliments the pumpkin flavor than serving with maple syrup, which seemed to compete with the pumpkin flavor.

I made the batter according to the recipe, tasted it before cooking, and made the following adjustments (in agreement with some of the reviewers here): doubled, yes, doubled the sugar, and added fresh ground nutmeg and cinnamon in addition to the cloves. Really tasty. Makes plenty for four; I was cooking for two, and next time I'll cut the recipe by half, though it was nice to have the leftover cakes cold with cream cheese...

These are the best pumpkin pancakes I've ever had! And I've had quite a few... I took suggestions of others and added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also used probably closer to a cup of the pumpkin. I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted milk and lemon juice. 2 Tbs lemon juice and then enough milk to make 2 cups and then scooped out 1/3 of cup. Enjoy!

Yummy. These remind me of my favorite pumpkin waffle recipe - http://pumpkinwaffles.wordpress.com/ultimate-pumpkin-waffle-recipe/

Awesome, awesome recipe. Cut down on the sugar, didn't feel it was necessary, and didn't miss it at all. Didn't use all the butter for cooking, either, that felt unnecessary too, and they sure turned out great without it. They burn very easily, though, so keep your heat low!

I loved this recipe! Like some others, I went for a little less clove and added some other spices (ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, I think), and I also added walnuts. So good!! I'm making them for brunch with friends tomorrow-can't wait!

These were very tasty and easy to make! The thing I will change next time is play with the seasonings - I decided I didn't care as much for pure clove. I'm a clove/cinnamon/vanilla/nutmeg kind of girl, so I'll make some adjustments. This recipe easily allows for adjustments, though, so I'll be making again! They are also nice thick pancakes, which I also really like.

Very good--my son wanted pumpkin pancakes after his preschool teacher made them and this recipe fit the bill. Makes a lot of pancakes, so probably won't do it again unless we have company. Didn't have cloves, so just used 1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Yummy!

My daughter exclaimed, "Mommy, these are so good - are you sure Aunt Jemima didn't make them?" I cut the cloves in half, and added more spices like other reviewers suggested. Since we ate them with syrup, I also cut down on the sugar. Didn't have buttermilk on hand, but mixed together lemon juice and milk instead, which worked fine.

DELICIOUS! Loved these pancakes! I added a little cinnamon, vanilla,and almond syrup to enhance the flavor, but they were excellent! Served with whipped cream on top, a la pumpkin pie. Not overwhelmingly pumpkin flavored- just the right balance. Will definitely be making these again next weekend!

yes, yes, YES very good - recommend a cinnamon / sugar dusting and a lightly sweetened (light) sour cream side - maple syrup etc... very good

I love the flavor of these but the texture is to moist. I will try using less pumpkin to see if this makes them fluffier. I prefer a fluffy pancake vs. one that is flat and dense. I know my baking soda and powder are fresh, so I am going to hope I need to use less pumpkin. I too added some extra spices.

Thought this could be a little sweeter. Used an egg substitute for my daughter with an egg allergy might have made a bit of a difference in outcome. Used the extra spices that were suggested. My family loved it.

It wasn't the BEST I'd ever had, but it was good. My finicky five year old even ate it without being coerced... though she did give it unenthusiastic reviews--she did say it was okay.

These are awesome. I've made them about 20 times and everyone always requests them again. I add a few more spices, but either way, they're a great treat in the fall and winter season.

This recipe is delicious! I have made it almost everyweekend for my husband over the past 6 weeks. You must follow the advice from other reviews by adding 1/2 teaspoon of both nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter. When these are added, this is one of my favorite fall breakfasts!!

I took others' advice and added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg to this recipe. The pancakes were delicious! The pumpkin flavor was there without being overwhelming. Both my husband and I liked them and will add them to our list of good breakfast ideas for fall.

These were the best pancakes we ever made - but do agree to add a few more spices to your liking. The spices help bring out the pumpkin flavor. I think everyone equates anything with the word pumpkin in it - with a pumpkin pie. If you have ever tasted pumpkin out of a can - it is not that great. The pumpkin adds moisture to these pancakes - so they take a while longer to cook. If you want them to taste like the pie - add the cinnamon and more cloves - you won't be disappointed.

Great recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg which brought out the pumpkin taste. I made it for friends at a brunch and they raved about them - asked for the recipe. Had one remaining pancake, froze it, popped it in the toaster the next morning and it was just as good as when fresh. Real maple syrup is the only way to go with these - don't try anything else.

The pancakes were good, but pumpkin wasn't a prominent flavor, which was a little disappointing.

I searched for this recipe as a way to use up leftover pumpkin. But it's so good that next time I'll buy an extra can just for the pancakes!

What a delicious fall or winter breakfast! I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg as well as cloves, and my family (including two children under five)devoured these gleefully. We will definitely be having these again.

Absolutely magic! I have difficulty getting my family up on Sunday mornings for church. All I have to do is make a batch of these and they come a running! Now if I could get them dressed as fast!

A pleasant blend of untraditional flavor to revitalize the traditional pancake. Superior to any pancake I have ever had at a restaurant.
