Made these fries to go with the crispy oven-fried cod and they were great. I reduced the amount of oil by half, and still found them a bit oily so will cut back the oil even more next time. I lined my sheet with parchment and had no problems with sticking. This is a quick, easy and healthy way to give the family a french fry fix!

These came out great. Crisp and tasty. I followed the advice offered by the cook from Bloomington, IN and preheated the pan in the oven before adding the potatoes. This is the first time I have not experienced potatoes sticking.

I had a lot of trouble with the fries sticking to the pan, but they are still worth making again. Next time I will use the suggestions given here.

Love these fries! I tried safflower oil just for fun and they were the best batch ever. We didn't even add a condiment. One large russet was actually enough for 2 adults and 1 child.

What an EXCELLENT substitute for deep fried fries. MUCH less mess and they taste great! You can spice them using a little imagination i.e. Old Bay Seasoning, seasoned salt or chili powder. Mayonnaise is our preferred dip for fries. Try it, especially with the cod.

I made this to go witht he Oven Fried Cod, and it was great. I cut the oil down to 3 tbs, and they came out perfect. I also used oive oil.

We parboil the fries for 5 minutes before baking and that adds crispness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside. Also we add a little onion or garlic powder into the oil for interest.

I put half of my fries in a glass dish and the other half on a cookie sheet. Let me tell you...the cookie sheet is definately the way to go. The fries stuck to the glass and they didn't even have any coloration like the ones on the cookie sheet. I did like them but I added my own herbs to them and they tasted great. Very easy and will make again.

We have made these for years, use potatoes unpeeled and wedged, then tossed with small amount of good olive oil, a little each of salt, pepper, paprika, onion and garlic powders. Delicious and easy. I use a non-stick cookie sheet and loosen/turn them a couple of times with a metal spatula and have no problem with sticking.

The fries definitely tasted good - but I had the same problem with them sticking to the pan and uneven browning. I will try some of the suggestions the next time.

I tried it and it was okay. I prefer Oprahs cook Rosie's version. Fat Free and spicier.

For all of you who have a problem with roasted potatoes sticking to the pan: Preheat the pan for five or ten minutes in the oven, THEN add potatoes tossed with oil, salt,spices,whatever. Never any problems with this method

A little too much oil, but still worth making again and again.

I have tried a number of oven fry recipes and they all have the same problem - the potatoes tend to stick w/o lots of oil which defeats the purpose. I spray the potatoes well on all sides with olive oil vegetable spray, then salt and pepper and bake on aluminum foil. THEY WILL NOT STICK, ARE LIGHT, CRISPY AND DELICIOUS!! Try this way - I think you'll like it.

The cook from Atlanta's right. I liked this recipe a lot but you have to be a bit vigilant. If you're not careful, you might end up with fries that are golden on one side, pale on another, and just-before-burnt on yet another side. All the fries will taste good if you use nice salt or spices and enough oil. But if ease of preparation or uniformity is paramount, maybe you should just buy a fry-daddy!

i'm slowly graduating from dishwasher to exec. chef in my own kitchen, and this recipe was exhilerating. i was overjoyed to see that it made no mention of peas. . . i love you kitten.

You must modify this recipe to make it work better: 1: coat your pan GENEROUSLY with oil so they don't stick 2: turn the fries after 10 min, not 15 min, 3 times 3: use olive oil, seasoned salt, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika...jazz it up Kind of tricky but better than frying potatoes or baking frozen fries.

These were more work than they were worth. I don't have as much time as I would like to devote to cooking, so I like to use the time I do have to making something special. In this case, I can do fun things with fish and fresh vegetables while I bake frozen commercially prepared "fries" in the oven. Several store-bought varieties come out just as good, if not better, than this recipe.

This recipe didn't work out for me either!

I agree with you, Brooke. Disappointing results. But then, this is not the first time with recipes that have had rave reviews. Generally, I am finding the recipe outcomes tend to be on the bland side. My rule of thumb has been to follow a recipe as stated the first time and if it gets raves at home, it's a keeper. It might help if recipes had disclaimers when they are light on taste so that cooks can compensate the first time round.

Very good! I substituted olive oil and seasoned salt. They were scoffed up very quickly. Much better than frozen fries.

Rating: 1
Ugh! I followed ALL the steps to the letter, as well as all the hints provided below (I used parchment to bake on, a plastic bag to coat the fries with oil, etc.) I used the full 500 degrees and I even measured(!) the first fry to be sure I was cutting 1/3 inch wide. Yes, I can be a bit compulsive. However, I ended up with "things" that were burned in places and white in others. Overall, they were just droopy, nasty-tasting things. This was a very unpleasant experience; partially 'cause I'd planned on fish and chips, and ended up with just fish and . . .

I've been making a version of these fries for YEARS! Try using olive oil instead of plain veggie oil and add a little garlic powder, onion salt and fresh ground black pepper - LOTS more flavor!

Very good (less guilt) french fries! Mine tended to stick a little to the sheet pan. Next time I'll use a little veg spray. We baked them about 30 minutes total with great results.

Delicious -- I made them with red potatoes and cooking spray, and seasoned with adobo. Enough flavor to be as satisfying as regular fries, but without that logy, fat-ified feeling afterwards.

These turned out great. They were very crispy. Easy recipe. Goes great with grilled cheeseburgers. No trouble with sticking on a regular cookie sheet.

My family loves these and we've had them several times already. Tried them in a black iron skillet in the oven last night, and they were the best yet--crisper and much easier to remove from the pan than previous attmepts in a baking pan.

My whole family loved it. Two picky boys gave it a big thumbs up. Instead of the oil, we used a cooking spray to save some calories. It was excellent.

Words of caution: Do not try to cook these fries at 425*, or even 450*. I had jotted down the recipe to make last night, and forgot to note the temperature. Guessing did not work. My "fries" were pale, limp and quite unappealing.

these turned out limp for me so my son threw them in a nonstick fry pan and finished them off - they tasted delicious. I think I would cut the slices bigger next time.

Sweet potatoes are the way to go!!! We used the handy zip-lock bag, a lot less oil, and lots of various spices. Make sure you keep an eye on them as mine started to burn after 10 minutes. Delicious!!

I've made fries this way for years, although I tend to prefer a bit less oil. For fast clean-up and to make it easier to turn the fries, I always use parchment paper. I don't know what I did before I discovered parchment--it's great for so many things.

I have made these roasted fries for many years. They are one of my family's favorites. For a little variation, I add some melted butter to the oil and top them with dried rosemary...delicious!

Put the fries in a baggy with a little olive oil and some alot of the spice "Joes Stuff" from New Orleans (a must have). Added garlic powder and aromat then shook away. Spread out on cookie sheet and cooked as directed. Delicious!!!! Husband said they were the best!

The very best way to have these fries, is with sweet potatoes. Peel and slice same way. You can also experiment with different seasonings. Our favorite is garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and sometimes a little cinnamon or allspice. Yum!

This is a wonderful substitute for the really-bad-for-you french fries that we never eat. Even my skeptical teenager thought they were delicious. I've made them twice, once as the recipe describes and once adding a little garlic salt. Both are very good. I will definately make this many more times.

Nice way to make oven frites - would suggest adding a little paprika or garlic salt if you want to add a hint of flavor. A great alternative to the typical and all too well known "Ore-ida's". Definitely more sophisticated.

another version.....Roasted Carrot Fries. I use a pound of carrots, 2 TB. olive oil, 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped,1/2 teaspoon coarse salt, and about 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Coat the carrots then bake on a foil-lined baking sheet for 25 minutes. No need to turn while baking.

These are seriously addictive fries! So quick and easy, too. I threw in a bit of Cajun seasoning for extra flavor.

We have made potatoes this way forever in my family. You can add garlic powder and paprika also. This can be made with red potatoes or even canned new potatoes if you don't want to fuss with the pealing. This is a wonderfully quick low fat recipe that my family has always loved.

Rating: 4
My version: Use red-skinned potatoes and toss in a whole head (or more) of pealed garlic cloves. (The garlic will bake up to be crispy, yet chewy and a bit sweet. I think this is the best part of the dish!) Toss in a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with any seasoned salt (even poultry or steak seasoning or Old Bay.

These were really pretty good. Lots of potential for seasonings. I poured abouta table spoon of oil onto the pan, added the seasonings & then "smeared" the potatoes on the pan. Satisfied our taste for french fries. We did NOT like the fish listed with this recipe.

Rating: 3
To use less fat and get it more evenly distributed, put sliced potatoes in a food grade plastic bag with the oil (and zesty seasonings - like garlic and whatever theme herbs like Italian, French etc) and shake a la shake 'n bake. For variety, add other root vegetables. Make lots because they disapear fast!

Try this one with sweet potatoes - awesome! For regular potatoes, add either a spoonful of taco seasoning or of onion soup mix when you add oil. Sure beats frozen fries!

This a great recipe. If you're trying to cut down on fat, you can reduce the fat to as little as one teaspoon. For added crispness, also use one teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.

Adjust the oil according to your own taste. I mix about two tablespoons of oil and the potatoes in a bowl. I put the potatoes on a rack rather than directly on the pan since the potatoes tend to stick. Tasty and easy.

To make larger, thicker "steak fries", may I suggest that a few minutes of "par-steaming" in a micro wave insures a uniformly,fully cooked,soft inside
