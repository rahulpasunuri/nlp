I agree with tweaking -- I at least tripled the seasonings but sort of lost track really! I used extra potatoes and carrots and didn't have any celery but didn't seem to matter. I like the consistency. It's really nice cozy comfort food.

I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of this soup. After reading many mixed reviews i was skeptical at first, but with the right amount of tweaking I got a great tasting, healthy, soup. I used 2 cups lite coconut milk with 1/2 cup skim milk, doubled the amounts of all the spices, used fresh thyme and ginger root as well as 1/8 tsp powdered, doubled the amount of carrots and celery, used 1 1/2 cup of leeks, used a large pototo and kept it in the broth, and used a blender instead of mashing. With these small tweaks (lol, yea right!) you get a wonderful soup! P.S. I really did sleep good!!

ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE

I gotta say this one was a hit. I made it for my partner to take to work and heat in the microwave and he called me to tell me how good it was and how well it went with the whole wheat bread I made him (King Arthur Flour rocks!).

Our family really liked this soup. My teenage daughter has been working her way through the Blue Moon Soup cookbook, trying out the recipes. It's a very comforting soup, a little sweet and very satisfying. Great with cornbread or some good whole wheat bread. The only change we made is to double the carrots and celery. Delicious. This one's on the repeat-request list for us.

Guess I'm going to buck the trend - this soup was nothing special...even with readers suggestions (coconut milk, etc.) I can't even imagine it as written. Definitely not a keeper for me!

I listened to all the reviews saying how bland it was. I added twice the suggested amounts of spices. I used 4 carrots. I tried 1 tsp each of ginger and curry, and in place of milk I used coconut milk. It really tasted fantastic. My husband who hates when I go vegetarian on dinner loved this and begs me to make it on cool fall days. He also adds grilled chicken. I serve it with flat bread toasted in oil and he won't stop talking about it for days. The coconut milk gave it a thai-like flavoring. Delicious.

The conceptwas good, but this soup needs more spices. I added about double or even triple amounts of each spice. Also, I added some rosemary, paprika, taragon, and garlic power to taste along with some garlic cloves. Also I added a bit more salt. The result was nice flavorful soup.

Was very bland tasting and a pale color...would prefer to see a 'Carrot' based soup showing at least a bit of orange color! So, I doubled the ginger, salt and carrot and used a large potato. Also, the recipe says to boil the potato chunks, drain and save the broth. I see no need to separate the broth from the potatoes since both are added to the soup at the same time. I served this soup to 6 people tonight and 5 of them liked it, 1 did not and 4 of the 6 found it much to bland. However, with the changes I listed above, I will definitely make this soup again.

A lot of chopping for this recipe. It was good, but a little bland, so I added sugar in the blender, which made it a better recipe. I'll probably make it again--it's healthy.
