Very good and I used store curd but it was hard to spread. Personally I could not taste the small amount of mascarpone in the whipped cream. Made a Limoncello bundt cake to go with it and all guests loved.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is over the photograph. Would seeing a photo of a trifle make you gag? I don't get it. The only change I made was to use Vanilla wafers, as I have an aversion to the flavor of gingersnaps in general. I made this more than seven times last summer, and have made it several already this summer. Even people who don't like lemon curd (GASP!) love this dessert. It tastes like summer to me.

This is a fantastic dessert to make ahead of time. I made 1 1/2 recipe to serve eight hungry people in a trifle bowl. Wonderful.

This is a perfect end-of-summer recipe that got rave reviews in my house. The directions were clear and easy to follow/

This was an easy, tasty dessert. I made one-and-half times the recipe for 8 parfaits. I broke up extra cookies based on what other reviewers had said and used purchased lemon curd which seemed like only a little bit of a cheat since you can get such good ones these days out of a jar. If I made this again, I'd probably some make extra blackberry compote since that was really delicious. The flavors were a nice blend of fresh, creamy, and not-too-sweet. A nice summery dessert, I would definitely make this again. BTW: I have no idea what all the fuss is about the picture in the magazine.

Not sure how a picture would deter someone from making a recipe if the ingredients all make sense. It's a great summer recipe. I made it tonight and everyone loved it! I used graham crackers instead of gingersnaps (i had them on hand) and it was a fine switch. I agree with the other poster, I was a little surprised that there was no sugar in the whipped cream, but all the other components had enough sugar to make this desert just YUMMY!

absolutely delicious. I used purchased lemon curd - there are so many good ones out there. Perfect level of sweetness. Make sure you use lots of ginger snaps in the layers. YUM.

loved this refreshing dessert because it wasn't nearly as sweet or cheesecake heavy as I expected. The kids loved it too and were super impressed with my layering to match the cover! I used Shasha Co. gingersnaps and I didn't find them overwhelming. The combination of lemon, cheese, blackberry & ginger crunch go beautifully together.

I doubled this recipe and layered it into 32 4-oz shooter glasses for our company picnic. They were the star of the potluck. I could hardly finish topping with berries before each one was grabbed from my hands. I made homemade, super spicy, gingersnaps, along with the homemade lemon curd. The flavor combination was out of this world. I would not change a single thing with this recipe and I will be making it again.

This nearly put my whole family into cardiac arrest, but we all would have died in bliss--this was lethally fantastic. Very impressive with minimal effort. But I might halve the portions...

Oh. My. Gosh. This dessert was DIVINE. And I'm not even much of a fruit girl...i prefer chocolate. The combination of tangy lemon, sweet berry and cream were heavenly and who doesn't love Ginger snaps with lemon? I used a couple tablespoons OJ instead of limoncello and used purchased lemon curd (trader joe's) and then I made and ate it 4 times in 2 days. Wonderful!

Really enjoyed this recipe. I will note I first saw and drooled over this in the latest Epi magazine and couldn't wait to make it. I love all things trifle and this did not disappoint. The lemon and gingersnap really played off each other and the richness of the blackberry compote with the creaminess of the mascarpone - heavenly. What's with all the negativity. We are talking about desserts, man!

The recipe is excellent, but more important at this point is the photo. I like it! It's a very professional, retro-vogue style from--I'm guessing-- the 1940s. Lighten up critics. Play with your food. It's meant to be enjoyed. Too many people are "playing" Hell's Kitchen.

I happened to have a jar of lemon curd in the pantry and amaretti from another dessert - this was just right for a summer dinner along with Prosecco to drink....oh and guess what - I used water goblets and added mint leaves and it looked pretty much like the photo and didn't bother my Martha-esque tendencies nor my guests.

Wonderful desert! Not too sweet, very refreshing. I made this desert because the photo was appetizing. I will be making it again and again!

Absolutely delicious! I was a little concerned about the lack of sugar in the whipped cream, but between the lemon curd and blackberries, there was more than enough. The mascarpone gave the whipped cream a wonderful texture that everyone raved about!

Fabulous and Refreshing!! My favorite combination of lemon, blackberries and ginger. Would also be excellent with amaretti cookies. Guests raved and recipe is making the rounds.
