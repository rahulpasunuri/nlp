A total waste of veggies--unattractive and the taste is interesting with the OJ but otherwise quite forgettable.

Wonderful! I used bottled OJ in my pantry. A keeper!

Yummy! My husband says 3.5 forks and that he could eat this everyday. I cut the vegetables at about 1/8 inch thick and they were quite soft so I think 1/4 inch would be better. Or perhaps I could have cooked them for less time. The flavor is wonderful. Flavor is good enough to serve to company.

After cooking the parsnips and carrots, the parsnips went mushy. For presentation the parsnips didn't look all that good, but the flavour of these two vegetables combined with the orange butter sauce was delicious. I served this with our roast dinner, certainly a different way to cook these vegetables, instead of roasting them. I will definitely be making this again SOON.
