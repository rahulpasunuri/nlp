Fantastic flavors! I actually turned this salsa into a chutney (sauteed the onions in EVOO, added some wine and chicken broth, reduced 2/3rds, added pineapple and peppers). Other fruits added just before serving. Garnished with starfruit slices and pomegranate seeds. Beautiful and healthy!

Loved this recipe... served with broiled shrimp kebobs and quinoa.

I've also used this recipe with 2 navel oranges(peeled, chopped, and throw in as much of the juice as you can retain) in place of the pineapple. Anyway you do it, I agree with the other reviews...a hit for our fam since it first appeared.

I always just made up my own recipe for fruit salsa but tried this one on Saturday night and it was amazing! This recipe makes a ton but we ate it all up within 24 hours. Try it!! Fantastic!!

Really yummy and I am not a cilantro fan. Used it over grilled chicken which had been marinated in a mango pineapple juice mixture. Also used over white fish - delicious and so healthy.

Excellent, fast, makes great use of fresh ingredients. Good with fish, probably would also be good with chicken. Will make again.

This is light and fresh, good for summer and grilled/broiled fish and chicken. I served it atop Chilean sea bass that I broiled for a few minutes and it was great. Probably even better over swordfish or chicken.

I would like to make this, but do not like cilantro. Could a mixture of parsley and a bit of fresh basil work?

Two non-cooks had to make a summer dish for a party.. We came across this recipe and have since become the "HIT" of every summer party. Its tangy, tasty... I have 2 variations.. #1 Use it with Cinnamon Chips for a Fruit Salsa (Use the Red Pepper for color)and watch your onion portions. #2 Use strawberries. Also great on fish, chicken, salmon

I've made this delicious salsa several times since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It's a summer symphony of flavors! Although I have only used it on boneless, skinless grilled chicken breasts, I can imagine it would be excellent on fish (as one of the other reviewers suggests), especially salmon or swordfish. Another reviewer finds this recipe a little labor intensive and I agree with her also. It takes time to peel and chop all the fresh fruit (you wouldn't use anything but with this recipe!!!)into uniform chunks--but other than that, even the worst cook couldn't ruin this. The serrano chili and white pepper give it just the right amount of "heat", which I like, personally. But as yet another reviewer suggests, you can make a "sweet" version by eliminating those two ingredients if you're not into spicy. This is recipe is awesome for outdoor dinners on the deck!

I've been making a variation of this for years. I also add a chopped, seeded plum tomato and a splash of olive oil. This is GREAT with grilled fish. Serve with basmati rice, steamed veggies, and tortillas.

This is my standard potluck item...and it receives nothing but rave reviews! It is a bit labor intensive, but well worth the effort.

I have made this salsa recipe many times. It is a bit "labor intensive",(all that chopping, etc.) but well worth the effort. I recently made it for a luau and it brought rave reviews.

Delicious. My guests were impressed and the Hawaiian Lavash crackers were definitely the perfect accompaniment. For some of my guests I also make a sweet version without the serrano chili and white pepper. Either way it's great.
