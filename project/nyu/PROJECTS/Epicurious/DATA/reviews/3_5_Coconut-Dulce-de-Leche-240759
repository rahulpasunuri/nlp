Loved the recipe! Must be followed exactly in order to achieve best results. Says use skillet not a pot. This distributes the sauce over a larger surface therefore cutting down the cooking time. The splattering is from the water in the coconut milk as well as the high fat content in the milk. The splattering stops about half way thru cooktime. Separation happens with overcooking. Watch the foaming action when stirring, when it doesn't foam up you're done. Has to sit overnight lids off so no condensation builts up. Sounds complicated but it's not! You'll love the end result.

I had the separation problem too. Once it cooled, I have a dark color liquid in the bottom of each jar. I also had to cook it over an hour to get it thick. Do you think I overcooked it, hence the separation? Also, did anyone else find it very messy. Mine was erupting like a little volcano as it cooked!!

This is so delicious!!! I accidentally used regular granulated sugar then put a little brown sugar so mine came out a bit sweeter but it still tasted great. I could definitely taste the coconut flavor. It thickened quite a bit when left to cool and put in the fridge. This is great for anyone who likes caramel and coconut flavors. I will make this again but try to make it into more of a sauce like consistency.

For the chef who failed to achieve the proper consistency- it is possible that you got a grain of uncooked sugar back into the dulche de leche during the cooking process, which will cause it to fall out of solution or separate- oil/fat and lumpy sugar. what you are doing here is basically candy making and it's important not to let anything get into the dulche de leches once it has started to caramelize. the only way to save it if this happens is to try putting it in a blender. it won't be perfect, but it will certainly be edible. good luck!

This is delicious. I used Chaokoh coconut milk, and the end result had great coconut and caramel flavor. I reduced it to slightly under 2 cups, and the resulting sauce was very thick and creamy.

I have already made this twice. It is so amazingly good!!! It will be a staple sauce in the refrigerator. The sauce thickens as it cools but it did take more than 20 minutes of simmering to reduce to 2.5 cups.

we had this last night over vanilla ice cream and it was heavenly. the addition of the toasted coconut sprinkled on top makes it ideal for dinner guests.

This was good, and we made it for gifts this Christmas as well. I had the problem of not quite acheiving a caramel consistency too, even when boiled down to only 2 cups. I didn't mind that it was a bit thin, but the sauce separated, with an even thinner almost watery layer that settled to the bottom of the glass jars. Did anyone else experience this problem or have any suggestions to avoid it in the future? Different batches had varying degrees of this separation!!!

This is very good and I will probably make it as gifts again. The one thing I wanted to mention is that 20 minutes was WAY off for me. I just let it boil on the stove till it was right. At 20 minutes it would have been very soupy.

Did anyone else have trouble getting a caramel consistency? My batches came out with a gel-like consistency, and I was disappointed. Perhaps it was the coconut milk I used?

Didn't seem all that coconuty to me...still tastey though.

Making this sauce made my whole house smell wonderful. I am giving it as a gift this year and taste tested it over vanilla bean ice cream. Delicious! I recommended it to a friend and he loved it too.

I find an easier method is to use 2 cans of condensed milk and one of coconut cream and bake it as in the traditional method. I'll also add 3-4 oz of Meyers Rum and use it as a topping over ice cream and pineapple for a pina colada sundae.

Easy and Yummy. Did a 'test run' last night before committing to giving as a gift and it exceeded my expectations. The coconut tasts is pretty strong so if you don't like coconut this isn't for you. I love it.

Interesting and tasty. I halved the quantity and served it warm over baked apples. A great non-dairy alternative.
