It's not often that I hear people rave about a simple salad, but it happened with this recipe. I also used pine nuts and field greens instead of all mache. Definite keeper.

Prepared the recipe as is and loved it. Small servings were dished up after the main course and my guests were impressed.

I made the salad dressing the day before Christmas dinner. Used regular mixed baby greens with some simple toasted pine nuts. Added just a pinch of fresh tarragon to dressing right before serving. It was a big hit.

I was unable to find mache, so used young field greens. Initially, I found the sauce too 'eggy' and sharp, but a couple of hours in the refrigerator mellowed it out nicely. I will definately make this again.
