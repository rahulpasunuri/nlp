I have been making this recipe for the last 4 years and it is always a HUGE HIT!!! I replace lemon juice and lemon rind for the lime. It's easy, beautiful presentation, and delicious! A must try!!!

Easy, light, summery - a great dessert that all like from the first bite. A keeper.

I tried this with fresh raspberries and seedless raspberry jam and it was very good, just not something to rave about. The crust for this recipe would be black if baked for the time stated. I baked mine for 15 minutes and checked it early and it was dark brown. The crust is definitely a keeper as it could be a versatile base for some creative fillings.

Although white chocolate is not one bit chocolate, this is my favorite tart, and I have made it over a dozen times. Guests regard it with rapture and consume it with barbarous manners, wiping the backs of their hands across their lips and demanding more. My wife regards real chocolate as a holy sacrament and white chocolate as an abomination (she's right), but everyone else loves this tart.

Delicious! Perfect summer dessert. Not too heavy with a light, refreshing flavor. Served with fresh strawberries and raspberries on the side rather than covering the top of the pie.

I thought this would have turned out better. Be careful when toasting the almonds.I toasted the almonds for 9 minutes which I think was too long. I baked the crust for less time (20 min) but it still had a burnt taste. The filling had an nice flavor. Once the strawberry topping is put on, do be sure to serve it within the 4 hours. My topping became watery.

I have made this tart every year, for all different occasions. It's always a crowd pleaser - and so beautifully presented! The only problem is, there are never any leftovers for the next day, and you will crave it!

What a gorgeous dessert to serve friends last nite! I doubled the recipe so I also had 4 tartlets. Suggestion-if you want more filling for your crust, just whip an extra 1/2C cream and fold into the lime mixture, adding a dash more lime juice. And, adding extra zest is a must. I arranged thinly sliced berries around perimeter and one large berry in middle-didnt need them mounded on top. Cant wait to make this again.

I love to make tarts and this one is at the top of my list. I made it for Easter and everyone thought it was refreshing after a big meal. I have made this many times and will make it again and again and...

Best use of strawberries in a dessert. Delightful combo of the lime flavor with white chocolate. Very easy and very showy.

OK. This is an absolutely delicious dessert! The crust is to die for, and the mousse is unbelievable. I doubled the lime juice and almost tripled the zest and thought it was perfect. Rather than top it with the strawberries, I simply served raspberries on the side. The mousse and crust were so good, I didn't want to lose them in a strawberry topping. I really highly recommend this tart recipe!

note to self: stop making this recipe. i do not like the lime-white chocolate combo. i accidently made this twice because i didn't leave a review the last time.

Wonderful recipe. I made one change. I made the tart in a rectangle shaped tart pan. Perfect amount of mousse, however to many strawberries, and to much jam. I would make one minor change...add more lime zest. Otherwise it was perfect and I would make it again!! Thank you.

Scrumptious! Used only about 14 oz strawberries, and baked crust only 20 minutes. Everyone raved.

I've made this twice and everyone always loves this tart. Plus, it looks gorgeous. The second time I doubled the mousse portion and used half in tart. I felt it needed more mousse and it presented better.

I loved this dessert. In fact, it may be the best recipe for a strawberry-topped lime tart I've ever seen! In my opinion the recipe calls for way too many strawberries, so I used about one fourth the reccomended amount and left out the strawberry jam. The crust was already brown at 20 minutes and needed no more baking, and the tart only needed around 1 hour of cooling, not 4!

The eye eats first and this tart is a beauty. I use an egg slicer to ensure a uniform size. It is delicious and refreshing; reminds me of Spring. I make this every Easter and there's never a crumb left. Sometimes I don't even get a piece!

I love this recipe. The Lime and White Chocolate offer a great refreshing taste. Some times when I am in a hurry, I just use a regular pie crust with the filling - or use a yellow cake sheet and use the mousse and berries as a toppings.

I have made this several times and it is a huge hit every time. It is such a beautiful presentation that is picked over every other dessert at the table every time!

From the reviews I thought this was going to be fabulous. NOT!. It's OK but nothing outstanding. The White Chocolate Lime Mousse Cake is 100% better. Not a nut fan so the crust didn't do much for me and there are way to many strawberries that flew everywhere when I tried to cut it. To much effert for not outstanding results.

All 10 of us agreed this was spectacular in taste and presentation. I did have to put the crust mixture in the fridge for 1/2 hour to be able to press it into the pan. Crust tasted like lovely shortbread when finished. A big hit!

I love this recipe, as do the many people to whom I have served it. The tart is easy to prepare and both the unbaked crust and lime mousse freeze well (separately and properly wrapped, of course). The crust needs to bake for 20-25 minutes only and must be watched carefully so it doesn't get too dark (or it will be too dry and crumbly). When strawberries are out of season, I decorate with red and green grapes, halved, or kiwis. All in all this tart is a winner! It looks beautiful and tastes delicious. I have made it numerous times and will continue to do so.

As soon as I mention this tart to my husband his mouth starts watering. We call this the "fighting" tart, if there's any left - people fight to get the last piece. I look forward to making this tart every year and always get rave reviews.

I've made this dish many times to the ohs and ahs of my friends. It's a beautiful dessert. I didn't find the lime flavor strong enough so I added more. Also, the recipe calls for a lot of strawberries and I didn't use anywhere near as much.

This is one of the first Epicurious recipes that I didn't love. It was fine - in fact it was pretty good but if I'm going to make a dessert (and deal with the calories) it has to blow me away. This didn't.

I thought this was pretty good, but didn't feel that it was worthy of the praise it received from others. I didn't have a food processor and the crust did not turn out real well; it crumbled everytime I cut a piece and tired to take it out of the pan. 30 minutes was too long to bake it; it was too brown at 23 minutes.

Delicious. The mousse has a nice light texture and the dessert was perfect after a Mother's Day lunch: beautiful presentation and not too rich. The crust was great and easy to make.

Wonderful. The mousse is outstanding.

Absolutely wonderful! Much simpliler to prepare than it appears-- the food processor makes the crust fool-proof. I made this dessert for Easter one year and my family still raves about it!
