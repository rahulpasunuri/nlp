I used this recipe for the steak marinade, but did not make the salad. I let the steaks marinate at room temp for 45 minutes before searing on the stovetop...5 minutes total is almost too much cook time. The steaks were delicious, my friends raved. We paired the steak with the purple potato & snow pea salad. Yum!

Nice but not too assertive marinade for flank steak -- could taste it on the meat but I wouldn't say it added tons of flavor or anything.

I used the basic ingredients but didn't grill the onions, I put them in foil on the grill instead of bothering with a basket. I also made it with Petite Filet and used the same dressing recipe for the marinate. Beautiful presentation. Highly recommend the dressing.

tetoncook, you can rate a recipe without reviewing it. I only made the steak, not the salad. It was fine, nothing to blow your skirt (steak) up.

How can this recipe have a "2 fork" rating without any reviews????
