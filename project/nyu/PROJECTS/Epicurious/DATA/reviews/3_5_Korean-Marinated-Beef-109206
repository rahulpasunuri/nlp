It gets four forks because it's so easy. Made it with leftovers and pantry staples, so I had to omit the scallions. It's a bit soy-heavy, so I added a tsp. of honey and a Tbsp. of rice vinegar, plus a dash of Sriracha for heat. I marinated it all day. Literally a ten-minute recipe if you use the tubes of minced ginger and garlic from the produce section. Served with stir-fry vegetables and rice.

I'd made the quick kimchi so this was easy and fun for my girl's nite...used a boneless NY strip frozen for about 20 min for easy slicing, marinated overnite. Didn't add toasted sesame seeds until plating the beef which looked beautiful. Also added some Trader Joes frozen cilantro cubes to my rice which smelled and tasted wonderful with the other elements. Eating this in the butter lettuce leaves was so refreshing and FUN! I skipped the garlic slices because the kimchi brings the bite. Everything was made ahead - quick nuke to reheat rice while beef sizzled on the grill pan - very doable party dish.

I have been making this FOREVER! It is a no fail recipe. I make as a whole steak or sliced on skewers for a party. Both are fantastic! I do marinate over night to assure the flavors. Wouldn't change a thing. Just be careful on the grill because of the sugar it can butn easily. Not to hot a grill or watch and move carefully.

Ever since having Korean beef at a Korean friend's house about a decade ago, I've been searching for something that came close to what she made. I still have a memory of what it tasted like...and this wasn't it. However, it wasn't bad by any means, and was rather tasty. I was expecting more *kick* to it, but didn't find any at all. With the beef sliced so thinly, it turned out amazingly tender -- like slightly spunky little beef ribbons dancing on my tongue. I paired it with the ginger-scented rice (one of my favorites) and the Korean-style romaine (never again).

This was a great recipe. Really flavorful. I added Siracha chili sauce, 2 teaspoons for heat and the juice from half a lime into the marinade. While beef grilled I boiled the marinade for under a minute. It is wonderful. After the meat was seared on both sides, I covered it with a wok cover to insure perfect medium rare. Definitely add chopped cilantro and chives to the finished meat for an amazing flavor layer.

The first time I made this recipe I thought it was a tad salty but still delicious - we ate every last bit. The second time I did 1.45 lbs of meat and upped the ginger and garlic a bit to make up for it, and it was perfect! I also added 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for extra kick. Delish!

I meant to say, too, that I made it EXACTLY as written and it turned out great.

This was SO quick and easy and GOOD! My husband had eaten dinner earlier, not knowing I was cooking, but still kept digging his fork in and, before we knew it, the whole plate of beef was gone!

I brought this to an international potluck dinner. All beef-eaters loved it. Asians came by and asked how I knew how to make this (I served it in a lettuce wrap with rice). And it was easy!

add 2 tablespoons more sugar, pinch of black pepper and some sake to dilute the saltiness of the soysauce.

This was pretty good although it did not taste exactly like the bulgogi I've had from the Korean restaurant that I like to go to. My only complaint was that it was a little salty for me and I used a low-sodium soy sauce. Next time I will buy the pre-cut beef strips to save time.

Yummy yummy yummy.... terribly easy weeknight dinner and so much flavor! I bought the steak sold in strips already for stir fry making this a snap. Definately a keeper!

I will most definately make this one again, I felt like I was in a Korean restaurant eating it!

I used round steak instead of flank this time and it was just as good but less expensive.

This is easy, quick and delicious. Definitely a repeat.

Just great. The whole flank steak went. Did not have scallions, so I diced up some red onion. Served with sauted peppers & onions and coconut rice.

I only use this recipe for the marinade. It is very similar to a recipe in one of the Bon Appetit BBQ issues (2001?) for Korean Short Ribs. Instaed of flank steak I use flanken short ribs and marinade for at least an hour before grilling them on the BBQ. I just use any asian side dish to accompany them (pan-fried noodles, stir-fry veggies, asian slaw, etc.). The meat tastes great by itself and doesn't need any sauce.

i haven't tried this recipes, i make my bulgogi in a slightly different manner. as a suggestion for something to serve it with: if you can find kochujang (korean red pepper paste) serve that along side. when i eat it i smear a bit of paste on the lettuce leaf, then goes rice and then the bulgogi, wrap and eat. i never put kimchi in the lettuce, it seems to wet the rice too much.

Very good sauce! I found it difficult to manage trying to eat it wrapped in lettuce leaves, so ended up putting it on a bed of leaves. Cucumber as a "topping" with the onion and sesame seeds makes a great addition that I'd recommend

This was absolutely delicious and very easy! I added red pepper flakes to marinade, omitted the kimchi as I couldn't find any at my store, and served a teriyaki/chili oil/hot mustard sauce on the table. Using the large shredding side of a box grater on the garlic made nice "slivers" without any knifework. As others have noted, this is great for guests; just prep first then toss it in the pan when you're ready to eat. My prim-and-proper guests practically licked the bowl! One caution: this isn't enough food for four people unless you serve a hefty side dish or first course.

Made this exactly as written. Thought it was just ok. Nothing special. Perhaps I was expecting too much.

I loved the flavors of this dish! One caveat: 5 mins for beef sliced this thin is far too long. After 2 mins in the pan with the marinade, I removed the beef, added water, and let the sauce cook a few more minutes until thickened. It was delicious served over sticky rice.

I doubled the recipe and used some leftover ribeye steaks. It was great! The meat came out very tender and flavorful, not too salty or sweet. I think it could use 1/2 tsp. or so of red pepper flakes or some chili sauce for heat, but that's the only change I'd make to it. We'll definitely make this again.

Wonderfull recipe! The simplicity of it is what amazes me. Very little prep work, short cooking time, and amazing flavor. I've made this time and time again for friends and family, they all love it. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.

good also with chicken. marinating the beef or chicken overnight makes a huge improvement in releading the flavors.

Made it with rounds steak instead of flank, cheaper but really good.

Very tasty...made as marinade for steak. Next time, will cut meat into strips first to let flavor penetrate entire dish, then make extra marinade into sauce. Guests could not get enough of sauce and were fighting over the drippings!!

Awesome. Easy. I used pickled pea pods and pickled baby corn because I couldn't find kimchi to serve with it.

This was excellent. I followed the marinade exactly, but preffered to grill the beef. Being too lazy to turn all of those little sliceson the grill, I marinated the meat whole for 30 minutes or so grilled it on high heat and THEN sliced it. I was sure I had plenty for dinner and leftovers....I was wrong....there wasn't even the tiniest piece left. My 8yr old had 3 lg. helpings! They want it again tomorrow!

Unbelievably easy and tasty. Served on a girls weekend and it took so little time, I was able to enjoy my guests and still look like a phenomenal cook.

When I make bulgogi I use a different kind of pan, you can barbeque it or you can use one of those dome like grills that go over you stove, you probably can find something in your local asian markets. Basically what this does is let the juice drip off.

I doubled this recipe and brought it to a potluck dinner last night and it was a HUGE hit! I added the juice of half a lime to add some tang, and ground up 1/3rd of the sesame seeds with a mortar and pestle to get a rich sesame flavor in the marinade. It was out of this world!

We just loved this!!! It turned out marvellously exactly as written. I do wonder if my fellow cooks could give me some insight into the mess....I used a Calphalon nonstick pan, and ended up with a baked-on black residue that took almost a week of soaking and scrubbin to remove.

I made this last night and it was SO good! My family loved it. We doubled the recipe and I added a little extra ginger and scallions, but otherwise did the recipe as written. YUM!

Recipe is generally good, though I would cut back on amount of soy sauce just a bit. I used dark soy sauce and would recommend using light soy sauce or a combination of both. I would also recommend adding some pepper or chili flakes for more taste. Overall, easy and tasty!
