This recipe was a good twist on an old favorite. I used Marie Callendars cornbread mix instead of Jiffy. I thought it was WAY too peppery. I'm wondering whether it was supposed to be green pepper or less pepper.

I love this recipe, because it is delicious and quick. That Jiffy corn muffin mix is pretty sweet, and it contrasts well with the blue cheese. I made it with a creamy, mild blue cheese and that was perfect--a good contrast between the sweet and the blue cheese. I didn't notice anything being too peppery. My advice for this recipe is make it when you want to whip up something real fast--and don't mind sweet cornbread (some people get real offended if you serve them sweet cornbread). Also, eat it right away, because it's only good right out of the oven.

I made this last T-Day with reduced fat bleu cheese - normally against my religion - out of deference to my sister-in-law who is into 2% this and unsalted that. Yuck! Use the real stuff and it's a good quick addition to an interesting bread basket.

I did like this, but, I would cut back on the pepper a bit & add a bit more cheese & onions to keep it from being too dry.

I thought this bread was a bit dry but otherwise o.k. in flavor. My dinner guest didn't care for it at all eventhough she likes blue cheese. Note the amount of pepper to be added (I cut this in half). Simple, but not worth making again.
