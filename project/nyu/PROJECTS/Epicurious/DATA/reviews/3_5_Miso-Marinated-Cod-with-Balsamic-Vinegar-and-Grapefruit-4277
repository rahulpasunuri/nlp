Thought this was a great lite meal I did not have any sake so I used dry vermouth and a little sherry Turned out great

This was a disappointment. I had good fresh cod and baby spinach from the farmers' market, and it seemed like a great, fresh, healthy combination. But the raw spinach was too rough a contrast for the fish, the cod was done before the marinade had browned, and it just didn't come together. It was fine, but not worth making again.

I used fresh haddock and it was very tasty. I will make it again.

used frozen cod and maybe that was the problem but it was tough. The spincach miso, grapefruit part was good, maybe a different fish? Salmon?

I've been making this since it first appeared in Bon Appetite in 1997. It's amazing with cod or sea bass. It's so easy, makes a beautiful presentation and always gets rave reviews...even from my kids.

I used the miso marinated sea bass recipe, but then followed the instructions here for the greens and grapefruit. Perfect blend of tastes and textures. I imagine the cod would be almost as good. Easy too.

Tastes just like the miso-marinated cod I have had at Nobu and other trendy japanese restaurants!
