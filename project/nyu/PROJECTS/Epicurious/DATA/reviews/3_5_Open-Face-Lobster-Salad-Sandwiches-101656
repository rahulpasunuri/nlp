Use fresh lobster! Living in New England and using frozen lobster would be a sin! Of all the lobster salads I've had (inlcuding all the ones I've had in ME), this has the best flavor. I didn't have chives so I added 1/2 tbsp of minced shallots. Instead of the bread, I lightly buttered and grilled hot dog rolls (another NE must). Super yummy!

Kind of a waste of good lobster. Used frozen maine lobster meat and subbed green onions for the chives (didn't have). The lobster flavor got drowned out in the lemon, mayo, and celery. Tasted like tuna salad without that tuna tang.

Simple and tasty, but I added some colorful bell peppers, for crunch and presentation. On a bed of crisp, tasty, mixed mesclun with slices of tomato make a great lunch.

Very simple and very tasty dish! I served this over a bed of baby spinach instead of on rolls and it was delicious. Great lobster taste with a hint of lemon.

This is a great recipe. I used a little less mayo and squeezed the juice from a whole lemon. This made it much less creamy and a bit more healthy. I served it on romaine lettuce with french bread on the side. Fabulous.

I liked this recipe. I preferred the salad without bread though.

I love this stuff, although I serve it on a roll instead of sliced bread. It is fantastic!

A delicious easy recipe. I also tried in on french bread which gave it a nice variety. I also chopped up some green and red peppers to taste. This made it a very colorfull and attractive appetizer for friends. One other variation is to use Ranch dressing.
