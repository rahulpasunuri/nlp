I just made this for a dinner party for 10 last night. I tripled the recipe. It was outstanding and got rave reviews. The only thing I did, was I omitted the chicken livers and instead of Parmesan cheese, I used Locatelli Percorino Romano (which is the best grating cheese for ANY pasta - period). This recipe is a WINNER!

This recipe was great. The gnocchi was tender and fluffy and easy to make. I do think nuking the potatoes in the microwave could save you an hour as another cook suggested and will try that next time. The sauce was great. I didn't have the dried porcinis and opted out of putting in the chicken livers, and it was still AWESOME. I will use this sauce for other pastas or even chicken in the future. Next time I may add the chicken livers. (Oh and I used dried parsley b/c I didn't have any fresh and it didn't affect the dish).

and gnocchi, of course. Boiled and browned in butter and herbs before adding to the afore-mentioned ingredients.

I messed with this recipe so much that I`m not going to rate it. This is just to say that the broth, vinegar and butter slight reduction for the base of the sauce was spot on and I`m happy to have come across that idea. There is a point where the reduction is a perfect base, then it becomes too concentrated. My dinner, just for the record, was bacon, onion, garlic, mushrooms, peas, lots of herbs, not a chicken liver in sight.

I made only the gnocchi and then made a separate arugula w/toasted walnut pesto, so I'll only review the gnocchi part of this recipe. It was absolutely fantastic. I used a bit extra of the lemon peel, which gave it a gorgeous hint of lemon with every bite. The gnocchi were perfectly tender, not too tough and not so soft that they lost their form. They were delicate and I had to carefully toss them with my pesto, but they tasted SO GOOD! I highly recommend them. These were even better than my favorite gnocchi from Serafina in New York.

I can't rate this recipe because I made a hurry-up, weeknight version last night. Here goes...render bacon/pancetta in butter, throw in onion/shallot to soften, along with mushrooms. Pour in sherry vinegar, boil down for a minute, then add broth (I used beef) and herbs. While cooking down, brown livers in a little butter and cook store-bought gnocchi. Toss all together and serve. It rocked!!

Cooked the sauce but served with store-bought gnocchi. The only changes I made to the sauce was to reduce the butter to 2T and sub red wine vinegar and balsamic for the sherry wine vinegar. Yum! I am a fan of livers and thought this struck just the right balance-- the pillowy- ness of the gnochi melded nicely with the livers and mushrooms. Even my 15-month-old niece gobbled it up and kept requesting more. I'll definitely make this again, though not for a regular weeknight meal-- considering the number of ingredients and time, this is definitely more of a special occasion dish

Only giving this three rather than four because I made a few changes. It was beyond delicious. I had a lot of mushrooms from my CSA so I used those rather than the porcini and crimini mushrooms. I cooked them in maybe half as much broth, removed them from the pan, and then deglazed the pan with the vinegar and a little more butter. It worked out beautifully and lighter than expected. So good on a cold winter night. Will definitely be making this again.

One small suggestion: place potato with a teaspoon of water, perforate potato and microwave for 5 minutes. Saves time and energy of an hr. oven usage.

This was really good! I was looking for a way to use up some left-over mashed potatoes. Had never made gnocchi before, and had been underwhelmed by them restaurants. But these were light, fluffy, delicious little things. I was only able to make an approximation of the sauce since I was lacking a lot of the major ingredients, but I really liked the mushrooms and liver with the gnocchi. Great idea and I will make it again!

The gnocchi is fantastic, however, I am just not a fan of chicken liver. I substituted the sauce with a lobster and sherry cream sauce. After boiling the gnocchi as directed, I transferred them to a saute pan with a little butter and garlic. Sauteed until slightly browned and served over a bed of the lobster sherry sauce and garnished with fresh Parmesan cheese. Fantastic!

Oh Yes this is goooood. I also made a veg verson for my son, Using more mushrooms and cream...he loved it

The gnocchi was terrible. The chicken livers were delicious and I don't really like liver just wanted to eat it for health benefits. I chopped some of the liver small and left some large pieces in case I wanted to pull them out but really liked the smaller pieces better. They weren't so "liver" tasting.

I made the sauce to go with store bougth gnocchi. Very good and easy too1

3.5 forks. This dish had some serious flavor going on. I took it to a party where two of us loved it, and the rest picked at it and made faces. I chopped the liver into quarters, used a mix of local mushrooms, used ventreche [a French chunky bacon], subbed 1/2 wine for the broth, and added crumbled blue cheese on top. I'd do it all again. There did seem to be far too much broth, and I dumped most of it out. Maybe this is because I used store bought gnocchi? I would reduce it by 2 1/3 or more next time. We had leftovers for days; it was so rich that you couldn't eat much at one sitting.

My husband rarely raves about food but he has repeatedly asked me to make this again. I have to say that we have always been partial to chicken livers. We really liked this recipe. A bit time consuming but economical!

This is a delicious dish - excellent for those who like chicken livers (seems like an odd choice for those who don't). I would recommend adding red (or white) wine in place of about 1/2 the broth, and garnish servings with crumbled blue cheese - classic combination that turns the dish from great to fantastic.

Agreed with other reviews -- unless you love chicken livers -- I'd put them in whole, and remove before serving. I had chopped coursely, and so couldn't pull them out. I found them to be too much, and it overwhelmed the dish. OR use foie gras (which I'm sure would be AMAZING). Outside of the liver factor, the sauce was amazing -- the mushrooms and pancetta came together nicely. It's a great winter dish. The lemon flavor in the gnocchi was a nice touch. My gnocchi were a little too firm -- but I think I mixed it too much (i had added a little more flour b/c dough seemed too gooey, so had to stir it up again). I will definitely try it again without the liver.

This was delicious, but my boyfriend and I found the texture of the chicken livers too much with the mushrooms and gnocchi. Next time may add them while cooking and remove as another reviewer suggested. LOVED the delicate lemon flavor of the gnocchi (and had good fun making them, first time, they were so cute!), and the sauce is to die for. Substituted white wine for chicken broth. Definitely will make again, maybe try the gnocchi with other sauces.

This is truly a delicious discovery of something new I can use chicken livers in, just when I ran out of ideas. I eat chicken livers a lot and the family was getting kind of bored with them until I made this and everyone loved it. I added three different kinds of dried mushrooms to this (I'm not sure which ones they were because I just chucked them in on a whim at the last moment. Yummy stuff!

I can't give this recipe enough forks. The gnocchi were easy to prepare, the perfect consistency and delicious both with and without the sauce. The lemon zest is a fabulous contribution... But the real wow of this recipe is by far the sauce. I have never been a liver lover but I thought I'd go out on a limb and try this one. This is my new I-NEED-TO-IMPRESS company dish. If you are serving to a group of people that may or may not be into liver, add the liver in whole pieces, let it simmer in the sauce and then remove it. You won't be sorry. I can't say enough about this dish!!!!

These are really good but we found that if you let them sit for a minute or two after cooking they firm up nicely, otherwise the texture can be a little gooey.

Incredible! My husband and I agreed that this is the best thing I have ever made.

Absolutely delicious! I did make one little change. I pan fried gnocchi. But I wouldn`t change anything else. Love it! Will cook it again, again and again!!!
