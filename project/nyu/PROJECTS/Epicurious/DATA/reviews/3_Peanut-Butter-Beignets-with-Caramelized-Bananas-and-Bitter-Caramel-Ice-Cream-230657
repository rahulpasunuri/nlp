We ALWAYS wanted to make these. However, I only allow frying in the house three times per year (harsh, but fair). One "fry credit" is always cashed in for Mardi Gras. Who can pass up beignets? I always serve endless plates of these with a variety of sauces...caramel rum, chocolate ganache, creme anglaise (try earl grey-infused...to die for), blueberry-cranberry compote, etc. This is always one of the favorite desserts of the year, for obvious reasons. This year, my beignet-master, Sandy, and I added these to our usual Cafe du Monde buttermilk beignets, being quite careful to read the reviews in advance and prep ourselves in order to prevent disaster. Here's the bottom line - with some work, we were able to prepare these as pictured. They were quite delicious, and our guests liked them. However, they were also VERY messy and annoying to make, and they would be regardless of technique. There were also a little dangerous, since you're trying to get little scoops of something the consistency of cake batter into boiling oil. This recipe also ruins the oil...even if you don't melt ganache in it. This was sad, since we usually salvage most of the oil used for regular beignets. If there was no way to ever create anything like this without making a mess, they might be worth it. However, the final assessment of myself, Sandy and all our guests was that it's quite easy to make a chocolate-peanut butter dipping ganache for regular beignets. So, in the future if we want this flavor combo we would fry up normal beignets and have a warm chocolate-peanut butter dipping sauce on the side. This would be just as tasty without the mess and putting one's life in peril. It goes to show you that sometimes you can improve on a classic, and then other times you should leave well enough alone.

Fabulous! Thanks to the first reviewer, who suggested coating the ganache balls in flour. It takes a little more work than Rachael Ray's 30-minute meals, but I enjoy a challenging project, especially one this delicious.

This is a very special dish. Very delicious, but lots o' work. Followed directions explicitly and boy, it was good. I tried it once to say that I did it, but wouldn't try it again. Frankly, it takes too much energy and time and a whole pot of frying oil!

The only strong flavor was the chocolate. If I were to make this again I would be sure to include more peanut butter in the recipe. I thought that the first suggestion of coating the bals in chocoalate did not help overmuch. It's a VERY messy dish.

This is a great 'guests over for dinner' type dessert. I skipped the bananas and the caramel ice cream entirely. Two beignets served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is just perfect. It was a big hit with my guests and I will make it again!

I made this recipe before reading the other reviewer's tip about dusting the chocolate balls with flour and they came out great. It's very rich and worth the effort.

The first reviewer was correct about coating the frozen balls in a little flour. I didn't check the epicurious website first, and I ended up with a pot of burnt chocolate in oil. Yuk. Luckily, I managed to get four relatively decent beignets before I became totally disgusted. I have a food alergy to bananas, so I served the four beignets with vanilla ice cream. Also, forming 1 1/4" balls from the firm ganache was such a mess that I quit forming them by hand after just two and pulled out my smallest ice cream scoop, which worked much better. Now I'm stuck with about 18 frozen ganache balls, but I'll find something else to do with them. This recipe is just way too much touble.

VERY IMPORTANT STEPS NOT IN THE RECIPE: 1. When you make the actual beignets, coat the frozen ball in a little flour, then in the batter. If you don't, the batter won't stick and you'll end up with a pot of burnt chocolate oil. 2. Make the caramelized bananas in a pot, not a pan. You need to whisk the brown sugar and butter together and it takes some force- so it's easier to mix in a pot. All in all, it's a great recipe- really impresses guests. The warm, gooey ganache in the middle is delicious and the crispy outside is fantastic. The caramel custard is great too, tastes like a dulce de leche. BE WARNED THOUGH- THIS DESSERT IS EXTREMELY RICH.
