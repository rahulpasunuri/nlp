EXCELLENT! I didn't reduce the butter recipe from 8 servings so it made a lot for the 2 of us but it is so easy to make. I used it as a sauce and didn't do the chilling/butter step.

I did it both with salmon and steelhead trout and it was great with both. The butter was such an unexpected highlight.

Who ever thought that raisins and capers together could taste so good? I soaked the raisins for 1/4 of the time and they still turned out fine blended. Fantastic dish--

I don't know how anyone can give this combination fewer than four forks. the raisins and capers set each other off beautifully, and there is not, to my knowledge, a better way to cook salmon. it comes out perfect every time, and we've adopted it as our go-to for salmon filets, even over BBQ. so simple, and yet so lovely.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day along with the Brown Soda Bread on this sight and asparagus. The butter was very good on the salmon. I grilled the salmon on the BBQ. Very nice to have a contemporary main for SPD and the normal beef guiness stew I normally make. The bread is a MUST!!!

I made the butter roll as directed except that I used currants instead of raisins. A delicious mix of flavors! Served with asparagus and roasted root vegetables. Guests seemed very happy. Will definitely make again.

This dish was extremely easy to prepare. Everyone enjoyed it. I didn't bother making the butter roll, instead just mixed it well in a bowl, refridgerated, and then doll-uped at serving time. The raisins lend a slightly sweet taste, and the capers give it a little salt. Yum.
