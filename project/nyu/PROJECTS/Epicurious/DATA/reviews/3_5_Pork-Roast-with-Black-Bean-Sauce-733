We had this for dinner tonight. I used a pork loin roast. I added the zest from all the citrus to the marinade. For the sauce, while sauteing the onions I added some poblano chiles, and also more citrus zest. I then pureed most of the beans, because the word sauce meant that to me. To finish the sauce I added some lime juice. It was delicious. I think next time, I will cook down the marinade to a syrup, to drizzle over the meat.

I added soy, ketchup and honey to the marinade to give it more body and the pork turned out wonderfully. The bean sauce recipe as written did not work at all. I simmered the beans longer than called for and the pureed, and then added more broth to thin out the sauce and added some bittersweet chocolate and some jerk seasoning and the sauce was fantastic.

I thought this a great recipe. I made a few changes though. I grilled the pork and basted with the marinade while grilling. At the same time I was grilling some beautiful poblano peppers to use instead of the plantains. In the sauce I held back the black beans while I pureed the the rest adding cumin, a jalapeno pepper and a touch of paprika. Without the bean starch I had to thicken it then add the beans at the last minute. I left the beans whole like Japanese style stew. It was fantastic and a great hit. A friend of mine grabbed some mango chutney and spooned a dollop on top of the pork. It was a nice, sweet addition.

This was a hit at dinner. Since I'm the only one in my family who doesn't eat pork, I doubled the bean portion and with more pepper and onion than the recipe calls for Ialso served it with safron rice on the side. I changed the marinade slightly by adding honey and a little extra lemon juice and orange juice.

I agree with the comments about the pork not being very good. Maybe the citrus based sauce is too thin, but the meat was not very flavorful. Disappointing. However, the bean sauce was great. I added cumin and oregano, then, after thickening, mixed in with yellow rice, and put it in the oven at low temp to increase the flavor. I would definitely make the bean sauce again.

I thought this was a great combination. The pork was okay, but the beans were SPECTACULAR!!! I also pureed about a third of the beans and added a little more tabasco than called for, and it turned out great. I will be using the bean recipe again and again...both by itself or as a compliment to meat. Wonderful!

We loved it! I did a few variations (added Chipotle and cumin to the sauce and marinade, used roasted peppers, didn't have lime juice, stewed the beans longer), but it was a great base. The pork didn't taste heavily marinated, but I only marinated for about 3 hours...can't blame the recipe.

The "sauce" was really just a variation of black beans of the balck beans & rice variety. I even pureed about 1/3 of the beans with a chipolte in adobo sauce which made the concoction good but not great. I felt like I could taste the orange zest on the pork which, depite marinating for 24 hours, did not have much flavor. Disappointing.

This was a great quick dinner recipe. I didn't have orange juice so I substituted guava and onions and it turned out surprisingly well. Decided to puree about one third of the beans per a previous review which made a nice sauce. Also, substituted a corn souffle for the plantain.

I modified this recipe and baked the pork in a lime/garlic marinade, sliced it and combined it with rice and the bean sauce in fajita roll-ups. They made an excellent lunch

This recipe was outstanding....... but.. After you've simmered the bean sauce a while, puree it and add 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. The overpowering bean taste disappears, and the sauce truly becomes a sauce..very nice

I've made this dish about half a dozen times since it is one of my wife's favorites. The meal is not only delicious, but it also lends itself to a nice presentation on the plate. I arrange slices of tenderloin in a circle around the plate and drizzle sauce on them and then pile the sliced plaintains in the center. If you like spicy food, I recommend adding a tablespoon or two of chipolte pepper sauce (available in any decent bodega) to the black bean sauce while it is cooking. I thicken the sauce by pureeing about a third it in a food processor and then mixing it back in with the remaining two-thirds. I have found it difficult to keep the plaintains moist cooking them in the oven so I usually just pan fry them in butter.

You MUST reduce the marinade, then add it to the black bean sauce. We used juice from the black bean sauce to keep the plantains moist. This was truely an incredible dish! Go light on the worcestershire!

Interesting meal, more than a dish, which lends itself well to improv. You can simplify the marinade (ground coriander, granulated garlic, bottled juices) without really losing anything, I think. I roasted the fruit (I too used pears) and some thickly sliced onions in a separate pan, since I had vegetarian guests, and sprinkled them w/salt, pepper, juice of 1 lime, 1 lemon, and some OJ to match the pork marinade in flavor. The pork was very juicy, and I absolutely loved the pears & onions made this way. The bean "sauce" I had more of a problem with--used more garlic, green pepper instead of red, and chipotle chilli powder to taste instead of hot sauce (much more flavor, in addition to heat), and ended up adding another can of drained, rinsed black beans for more body. The beans were surprisingly good (they will be my standard black beans now), but even before I added the 2nd can, they in no way could be considered a "sauce." I served this with a cucumer-tomato salad and white rice, and would definitely make this meal again.

If you like Cuban food, or have never tried it and would like to, this is the dish for you. If you can only find green plaintains, plan ahead and ripen them in a paper bag for 3 or 4 days first. It is worth it, rather than using bananas. Finicky friends raved about this when my husband and I made it (it is a great tandem-prep dish).

the pork had enough flavors without adding the black beans...they did not compliment...good, but not complimentary. I boiled the citrus marinade and added it to pork after initial l0 min. bake. this made a lovely sauce for pilaf. Plaintains not available, so used fresh pear....nice.

Quite good. The citrus really enhances the flavours!!!

Actually 3 and half forks according tot he kids. I used a pork butt and covered it during baking, took longer, but you can use plantains that aren't so ripe. Really is good.

I made this dish using pears rather than bananas and it was marvelous. I also poured the marinade into the bean sauce and allowed it to cook down. It really takes about 1-1 1/2 hours to prepare.
