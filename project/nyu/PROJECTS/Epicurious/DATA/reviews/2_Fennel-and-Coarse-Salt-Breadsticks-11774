This was my first time making breadsticks, and I am a beginner bread maker as well...that said, I followed this recipe exactly. I believe that everything was going along accordingly until I rolled out the 12 sticks and went for the second rise. I am not sure what happened, but they never did raise again. I baked them as directed, using fennel seeds on 4, poppy seeds on 4, and sesame seeds on 4. I baked them for 7 minutes and they were done...overcooked even a little bit. They tasted alright, and went with the salad meal I was serving. I mean, who doesn't like warm bread? But I will not make these again. I will try more breadstick recipes, and keep on making bread until I "get it".....say a prayer for me!
