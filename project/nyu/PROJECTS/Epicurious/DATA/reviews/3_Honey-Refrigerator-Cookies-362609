I was trying to use up some ingredients and made these with chestnut honey plus a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Like other reviewers, I baked them slightly less than recommended (9 minutes.) They are a very subtle cookie, sort of between a rich tea biscuit, shortbread and an almond thin. Very tasty, but not strong on flavour.

My girlfriend and i made these, let them sit for two days, and omitted the nut meats. This is a good cookie, the kind of cookie light enough to have for breakfast.

Absolutely nothing wrong with these as cookies, but not special enough to justify the expense of the honey, which I can't taste. The almonds disappear, too--I would suggest toasting them lightly, first.

I notice the accompanying article says these cookies would go well with cheese. Anyone have a suggested cheese to serve with this? I suspect a roquefort type would be too strong and chevre too mild. An aged cheddar perhaps?

Wonderful and delicately fragrant cookies. Made 60 cookies. I baked at 350 for 9 minutes, as opposed to 10-12 minutes as recipe instructs.

Very good cookies- they were a hit at a party! Although these DID NOT make 80 (more like 20), they were easy to put together and tasty. I substituted 1 T. cornstarch instead of egg to accomodate a dairy+egg free guest, and she loved them.

They were bland. Absolutely nothing special about this cookie at all. I won't ever make them again.

These are great, not too sweet and make your house smell SO GOOD. I also baked them for less time.

In my experience baking these cookies, the oven was too hot and I overcooked them. I preferred these cookies baked at 350 for 9 min and removing from pan promptly. I followed the recipe exactly and stored the dough in the fridge for a day and a half. Honey flavor sure comes through. They will be good with my tea!
