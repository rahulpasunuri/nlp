This recipe was totally lacking in flavor, even with ginger and garlic added. Not impressed unfortunately. For a better Thai recipe, try Thai Seafood Stew, so much better!

This is a yummy - if inauthentic - riff on a classic. It's pretty basic. To boost the flavor, I tossed in a hunk of fresh ginger that I took out when finished, and added a few TB of chili garlic sauce. I used sweet potatoes, not white and served it over Jasmine rice. A great go-to recipe for an easy weeknight dinner.

I've made this recipe numerous times....each time is different though. Absolutely use a lot of ginger (can never have too much of that), add minced garlic, i use at least 3 times more curry paste than directed as well as double the fish sauce. It's a good base recipe...but as you make it, you will figure out what you want more/less of. Certainly needs adjustment to your liking. If you don't have time for that or the patience - I would not make this.

This is a very good recipe - fast and easy, but really yummy! I add 2 cloves of minced garlic and 2 tbsp grated ginger to the onion. I also increase the Thai curry paste to 3 or 4 tsp and use all the juice from one large lime at the end. I have added sliced fresh mushrooms and a couple of handfuls of fresh baby spinach too.

this dish is perfect and easy to make. Since I like spiciness I added three habanero peppers for that extra kick.

This was OK but not something I would make again. I read the reviews and added garlic and ginger, and more curry paste, but even with addition of a good amount of salt and pepper, it was missing something. I served it with jasmine rice tossed with peanuts, which saved the whole thing.

Made this last night for a pot luck and it was a total hit. Added fresh ginger and garlic as other recommended.

Easy to make; like other reviewers, I added 1 T minced ginger, 2 minced garlic cloves-- sauteed them with the curry paste. Used only 1/2 cup coconut milk, added 1 c chicken stock and thinly sliced chicken breast, doubled the fish sauce and left off the lime juice and finished the dish with coarsely chopped roasted peanuts. The dish goes well with the Tomato and Crab Soup--- which tastes like Tom Yum Gai.

Rating: 2
This was very good, but it would have been super bland had I not followed the others' suggestions for improvement. I doubled the curry paste, added ginger and garlic, and several kinds of vegetables. Needs a good dose of salt and pepper too. When I make it again, I'll add even more ginger, garlic, and curry paste. But, it is incredibly easy to make, and it served a large crowd (I doubled the recipe).

This was a wonderful Thai recipe. Based on other reviews, I added minced garlic, grated ginger and spinach. Best Thai recipe I've ever made!

oh yeah! I've made this a few times and every time I do I change it just a bit. Tonight I took advise from a few reviews and added lots of garlic and fresh ginger (during the saute of onions and red pepper) I used a few extra large boneless chicken breasts, which I also saute, and this was really delicious! just don't breath on anyone after you finish dinner.....a four star rating

I made this last night and I must say it is very bland as written. It needs lots of garlic and ginger, and plenty more curry paste. I also used the juice of a whole lime. Would I make it again? Maybe, but I would revise it for better taste as above.

Made this when I had to use up excess colored peppers. Cooked it as instructed (using lite coconut milk) in a shallow, Le Crueset skillet. Kept it on fairly low heat and the chicken poached beautifully and the peppers and onions were tender, but not mushy. Served over brown Basmati rice and it was a hit! Best of all - easy, easy easy! Will definitely become a go-to dinner when I'm in a hurry.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a great dinner! I added more veggies, as recommended by previous users. I sauteed some baby bok choy, snow peas and carrots as well as ginger and garlic, a must! One major thing I did diferently was to sautee the chicken beforehand. I was not comfortable putting raw chicken into a veggie and milk sauce to cook withoug being browned first. Other than that, we all loved it! I served it over jasmine rice. All of the ingredients I found in my regular market, some of them in the Asian cooking aisle. But we loved this!

Rating: 4
Loved this. And, my 2 1/2 year old loved it. I had 1 1/2 lbs of chicken so upped most of the stuff by 50% -100% (2 tsp Thai curry paste, 2 Tbs fish sauce, 2 Tbs brown sugar, 3 Tbs sour orange juice, 1 1/2 onion, 1 1/2 bell pepper). Also added a bunch of other veggies since I'm trying to get my daughter to eat more veggies. Added brocoli and snow peas. Also, didn't have fresh basil, so put in about a cup of chopped fresh cilantro. I LOVED the result and my daughter ate a bowlful. Yeah!!!

Rating: 4
Really good, really easy. I went vegetarian. Used two cans Coconut milk and opted for approx. 2 T fish oil and dark brown sugar. Also, added way more red curry paste and some Turmeric and the color still was somewhat pale. De arbol chiles are necessary to give it some kick (crushed red pepper). I tossed about 6 in to simmer and then added some cayenne pepper at the end. A large clove of garlic and healthy dose of ginger, too. Be creative with veggies - I used bamboo shoots, mini corns, bell pepper, squash, carrot and broccoli. Thai basil is ideal, but regular will work fine. Not the "hands-down best curry" I've ever had, but it's darn good and I think it will get there will some playing around. Oh, and it is SO EASY!!!

This is such a good base on which to build your own curry. Like many here, I add garlic, ginger (1-2 T), triple the curry paste, and add more hot chilis. I find lite coconut milk plenty rich enough. My favorite variation is with spinach, mushrooms, and bay scallops instead of chicken.

I really liked this. It has a lot of flavor and it's easy to prepare. I think you could easily substitute other items that you have on hand. I did use canned diced tomatoes instead and I probably doubled the curry paste. Will make this frequently!

This truly is SIMPLE and TASTY. Wanted to give it 4 forks because I was so pleased with it but it is atill a fairly basic dish so I can't call it "exceptional". I used massaman curry paste because I love the massaman curry at our fav thai restaurant but got sick of paying $18 for it... it tastes just like it!! And so unbelieveably easy... pretty much fool-proof. I also used half a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and added cashews then served with avocado slices. Would recommend to any novice chef.

I made this last night with a couple of additions....fresh baby spinach (wilted beautifully in the coconut milk) and a thai chili pepper. Also omitted the red pepper and used 1/2 can of chopped tomatoes as opposed to fresh. Overall very good flavor, since I used low fat coconut milk, it wasn't as rich as it would have been but still very good. I served it with Jasmine rice. The basil was a suprisingly good complement to the dish.

Rating: 3
I agree with most of the reviewers. It needs a little kick. DO NOT USE COCONUT CREAM it's for drinks and typically sweetened. Check Trader Joes for options on coconut milk w/o preservatives. I added a thai chili pepper and a serrano, about a tsp ea of garlic and ginger, NO tomatoes (cooked tomatoes tend toward soggy and we aren't fans) and used lite coconut milk. Fabulous...my fiance' couldn't get enough...also used brown basmati rice which gives a nice nutty flavor as well. Good luck! Enjoy!

This looks simply d-lish! I have most of these ings in my house, so I will make it this week for company.But...People....do not substitute coconut cream for coconut milk!!!! The coconut cream is a whole other food material, mostly used for baking and foo foo drinks. It always cracks me up what people try to use when they cook. Anyway, basic ings for a fun new dish to make.

Definitely add garlic and Sriracha.

I've used this recipe so many times I've lost count. I skip the tomatoes though and substitute bamboo shoots, snow peas or sometimes just more red bell pepper. Also often add peanuts at the end. For added kick and flavor, I always sprinkle the chicken with Penzey's Bangkok Blend. Usually use "lite" coconut milk as well and it works out just fine.

My boyfriend and I made this the other night. Since everyone said it didnt have enough of a kick to it, we decided to add Jalapeno's in with the peppers It gave it the perfect amount of spice. It was delicious!

My boyfriend and I made this last night, with the addition of extra firm tofu, and using coconut cream (diluted with water) instead of coconut milk, because every brand I checked for the latter contained preservatives. I omitted the tomatoes and lime juice (we were in a hurry to eat), but added red bell peppers. I also used about half a small jar of the thai curry paste, which gave it good flavor, but like everyone said, it would have needed some chili sauce or something for a little bit of kick.

Rating: 4
I made this last night (for my bf also, what a weird coincidence among us epicurians). I used coconut cream and diluted it with water because the already prepared coconut milk had preservatives in it, and the cream didn't, but it turned out just fine. I didn't add any salt, as it seems the salt in the already-prepared curry paste was enough, and there were enough flavors in it so that it wasn't bland. I also added extra firm tofu and small yellow potatoes.

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious, but as other reviewers stated, I had to tweak. I added 3.5 t of red curry paste, thai chili peppers (whole) and some additional red pepper for heat--we like it hot! I served it over sushi rice (it's all I had on hand) with sriracha on the side. I left out basil as I was short, and subbed a squeeze of lemon in place of the lime, which was fine. My bf thought the sauce was too thick and preferred that I thinned it out--maybe lite coconut milk will do the trick?

Rating: 3
My boyfriend and I made this last night and it was delicious! It would have been four forks if it had more spice...we ended up adding quite a bit of chili powder and it still didn't pack the punch that we were looking for. I also put in 2.5 times the curry paste, added a garlic clove and cut down on the tomatoes. I'll definitely be making this one again!

Rating: 4
Such a good recipe that my dad is asking me to make it again just one week later. I added a little more basil than normal because we grow it in our garden, and cut back a little on onion and tomato. Also sauted the chicken in oil with a little soy sauce and some ginger to flavor it before I tossed it in with the rest of the veggies. Fantastic dish.

This can take 5 minutes to make! I saute the onions and peppers for about 5 minutes and then add the chicken tenders for a brief browning. Then I add the coconut milk, and other ingredients. I also added garlic with the onions. Just be sure to not overcook the white meat - 5 minutes in sauce at the most. Serve on rice.

This was okay. It could definitely use some added spice so we added some chili sauce afterwards to spice it up. I took others suggestions and doubled the curry as well. Because we prefer dark meat, we substituted the tenders with boneless skinless chicken thighs which worked well.

I followed most of "missbhavens from nyc, ny's" suggestions, but I also added fresh ginger. I couldn't find the Red Pepper Paste, so I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. I reduced the curry paste in half as I wanted my two-year old to eat it. I doubled the recipe and used one can of regular and one of light coconut milk and then added veggies at the end. Served with Spring Rolls.

When I get a "Wow!" from my husband, I know it's a keeper. This is superb. I tripled the curry paste as others suggested, subbed a can of diced tomatoes for fresh, and a couple of tablespoons of dried basil for fresh. I'm making this again tonight, and will use fresh basil, but that's about the only difference. Served this over black "forbidden rice" and it was marvelous. Only think I'd add would be samosas to start, Indian beer to drink with, and naan on the side.

Great recipe. It needs more hot spice though...more curry, red pepper, and salt. My friends and I added many more veggies to it too--eggplant, carrots, green onions, and green beans.

What a nice recipe! Easy. Tasty. Even adding a touch of hot red pepper couldn't deter my children from taking seconds.

This is my #1 favorite "chicken w/vegetables in sauce over rice" dish. Because packaged red curry paste is wicked hot I actually only use 1 tsp of it for heat, and the one tbsp of Roasted Red Pepper paste, which is made by the "Taste of Thai" company, available in larger supermarkets. It adds a delightful rich smokey flavor without adding heat, and also adds some color. the only change I make to the recipe is that I sautee the chicken and some chopped garlic in lemongrass oil until all sides are cooked, then add the pastes, onion and pepper (I go for yellow becuase the tomatoes are already red!) and sautee for a short spell before adding all the coconut milk at once. After that I follow along with the directions. Everything blend beautifully, and EVERYONE loves this dish! (hint: although it's healthier, don't substitute lite coconut milk.It's too thin)

I did approx. 3 times the curry paste and added chunks of pineapple, which I think added a lot. It would have been very bland without the extra curry. The salt is a must too.

I made this tonight for dinner. Everyone loved it. I changed a number of things based on what I had on hand and on other's suggestions. I: 1) substituted pasilla pepper for bell pepper, 2) substituted spicy thai chili sauce for chili paste, 3) added chopped garlic clove with onions & peppers, 4) added chopped fresh ginger with chicken and rest of coconut milk, and 5) added lemon grass with sugar and fish sauce.

This was an easy dish to make and now that I have a pantry filled with Thai ingredients I will more than likely make it again. I forgot to get fresh tomatoes but used canned diced tomatoes. It was an ok substitute in a pinch. Taste the sauce before adding more curry paste. One reviewer stated he used 2 tablespoons of the curry paste. Unless you like you like your Thai food ***** hot, two tablespoons is way too hot for the average palate. The recipe didn't specify using Thai basil, but if you can get it, it really adds a more authentic flavor to your dish.

Rating: 3
This is my favorite, and most versatile, curry recipe. I frequently replace the chicken with shrimp. Sometimes I add chopped, fresh garlic to the first sautee step. Also, be sure the fresh basil goes in at the very last few seconds of cooking or it will get mushy.

This is the best recipe for Thai curry. I did increase the fish sauce to about 3 tablespoons, and we like spicy food, so I added 2 tablespoons of curry paste. The only other change I made was to substitute lite coconut milk for regular to save fat and calories. It is wonderful, even my son loved it and asked for seconds.

This turned out great after using other reviewer's suggestions to double the curry paste (I used green) and fish sauce. I added about a tablespoon of fresh minced ginger and two kaffir lime leaves. I used one whole lime for the juice. I also used snap peas instead of bell pepper. We like it spicy so I added a jalapeno and two bird chiles, too. Very tasty. This would be great with shrimp or scallops.

Rating: 3
Curry's allure is it's exotic layers of flavors: sweet and sour and heat intensity! Double or even triple (taste after each addition) the red curry, fish sauce, lime and brown sugar. Perhaps add a bit of grated ginger (Did you know you can freeze ginger root and break off what you need to grate into a recipe? no need to peel skin!)

Rating: 3
I really liked this simple recipe because I could build on it. I did not have Thai curry paste, so I used yellow curry powder and Mexican Green Salsa. Also, I used half of the tomatoe and added fresh pinapple chunks. I marinated the chicken in the coconut milk, seared it and then cooked the sauce (adding the chicken later to simmer). I let the whole pot simmer for about an hour and served it over basmati rice. It was very yummy!

This went very well, it only takes as long as the rice takes to cook once you've prepped everything first. I doubled the curry paste and lime juice, and left the seeded tomatoes on the plate. Also squeezed the very last of the lime juice over thai fragrant rice, which I served on more fresh basil leaves. Absolutely delicious!

A wonderful restaurant-quality recipe. I made it without the fish sauce and found it just as good as with fish sauce. If you use real lime for the juice, buy an extra lime and slice it thin for a garnish on each plate. Recipe can be easily doubled or tripled for a dinner party.

Really good!!! I made this as written, except found I had no onion when I went to make it so left that out; same with the lime. It only needed a bit of extra fish sauce and sugar to be excellent. Best thai chicken recipe I've made so far (I've tried a lot, and have had some flops). Just as good as some restaurant fare I've had. Next time I'll make sure to have the onion though.

This was fine, but we have made much better thai curry. The Thai Shrimp Curry recipe from Bon Appetit February 2004 is fabulous. We've also had more better results from the recipe on the back of the jar of green curry. This recipe just seemed like it was missing something. Something delicious.

Used less than 10 ounces of coconut milk and added 1/4 cup of chicken stock. Used more curry paste (add to taste). Also added green beans with bell peppers and onions. At the end, cooked basil leaves and spinach. Also, add fish sauce, brown sugar and lime juice to taste. Omitted tomatoes. Similar to chicken green curry in most Thai restaurants -- delicious!

I trebled the chili paste, as suggested, and used green beans and orange (not red) bell pepper as veggies. I also used extra-firm tofu, first marinated in sambaal olek and fish sauce and rice wine vinegar and onions and a bit of sake for 15 mins, that I then deep-fried ~5 mins (to make extra firm), in place of chicken. With copious fresh basil from a friend's garden, the result was so spicy and warming and slightly sweet and tropical (paired it with a brown rice into which I dumped the tofu marinade and some diced pineapple and butter) and comforting and was better than most Thai restaurants here in St. Louis. I will make this one again!!

This is my favorite Thai curry recipe ~ everyone loved it. I doubled the curry paste but still found it too mild so next time I will triple it. Served over coconut rice.

3 and 1/2 Forks! A most excellent recipe and a great base for improvisation. I had a medium-sized red bell pepper and also a yellow bell. They both were added into this dish. My local Asian market had fresh lemon grass and Thai basil, so I just had to use those. My wife and I both like it hot and spicy, so I doubled the amount of the red curry paste and added 6 or 7 thinly sliced hot Thai bird peppers, plus some minced garlic and fresh ginger. I served it with steamed rice (Basmati, but Jasmine would be more authentic) and carrot salad with lime and cilantro (recipe also found here on Epicurious). Definitely a keeper recipe that will be added to my frequent favorite list. It's fast cooking, but does require a fair amount of specialized shopping and preparation time. Highly recommended!

Don't even THINK about making this dish without a trip to the Asian market. Typically in restaurants you'll see this dish made with green Thai curry (not red, yellow, or Massaman), and sweet basil, not regular. I thought the fish sauce was not really necessary and may even turn some people off. Fill the tablespoon up about halfway, though, and the fishiness will not even be detectable. I would also agree with the reviewer who suggested serving lime slices alongside the dish instead of adding the juice. Let each person add juice to taste. I added a few of the small chilies from the Asian market as well (sliced them then sauteed them along w the onion/pepper). Spiciness is *essential* in any Thai dish! This would be delicious with tofu instead of chicken- and could easily be made vegan with the elimination of the fish sauce. Next time, I may also substitute snow peas or broccoli for the tomato. Yum!

Rating: 4
This recipe was great! Everyone I've made it for LOVED it. I used more of everything (2 tablespoons curry paste, 4 tsp fish sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar) to get a more vibrant taste. But my friends and I like it spicy. Also, we saved the lime, cilantro, and tomatoes to be used as garnishes at the table. That way the red and green color is more dramatic, and people can add it to taste.

Never made a curry dish before and this was a good recipe to start with. Easy to prepare but having made it twice now I agree that you need to double the fish sauce and lime, just to give it an extra sharpness. But there again it's an easy dish to fool around with to suit your own taste.

Easy-to-make recipe that results in a flavorful dish. Still not quite restaurant quality--there's something to be said about making your own curry paste from scratch. As previously suggested, double (or more) the curry paste. Marinate the chicken before hand in a little sesame oil, curry paste, fish oil (SMALL AMT), and soy sauce. This recipe works just as well for both red and green curry.

When all was said and done, it was just as good as any Thai restaurant served along with jasmine rice. YUM!

Good - but the "note" that it is missing is Kaffir Lime Leaves (about 6 small ones, slivered). They are available fresh at Asian markets - I can even find them here in Tulsa - middle America to the nth degree. Add these and this will truly taste authentically Thai. I doubled the basil also.

Very quick easy dinner to make. Add more curry per taste. I also use more basil than recipe calls for.

You can "knock this recipe up a notch" by adding red pepper flakes and/or diced hot peppers. I also increased the amount of red pepper strips, fresh basil and used red onion - then added in some bamboo. This is so simple to make and the leftovers are excellent. It's one of my "easy" favorites.

Left out the fish sauce. Not a big fan of fish sauce. The recipe still turned out great. I serve it over Jasmine Rice.

I agree that the dish lacked a certain something. The "Curried Chicken" recipe (Bon Appetit, January 1999) is so much better, though it has Indian accents rather than Thai. It just tastes more authentic, and uses regular old curry powder (much more likely, at least for me, to be on hand, than curry paste and fish sauce). Try that recipe if this one didn't do it for you.

This was missing something... I doubled the curry paste, and I must have a spicy brand, because we could barely eat the stuff. Then I added another can of coconut milk to halve the hotness, and too bland. I can't put my finger on what this needs, something bottom layer flavor to pull it together.

So-so...I have a Chicken-Coconut Curry that surpasses this one and which my sister says is restaurant-quality. :) Here's the recipe in case some of you are open to trying other recipes: 3-4lb chicken,pieces or whole/water/1 tsp salt/1 Tbs sugar/2 bay leaves/fresh basil/1-2 cloves garlic, sliced thin/rice-amount to suit you/ 1. Boil chicken over medium heat in water with salt,sugar,bay leaves,basil,and garlic until meat comes easily off the bones. Remove chicken from stock. Save stock. 2.Cool chicken and pick meat off bones. Cut into bitesize pieces and set aside. Cook rice in stock. 6 Tbs butter or oil/2 large onions, chopped/~5 tsp curry powder/3 Tbs lemon or lime juice/cayenne pepper, black pepper and salt to taste/14-16 oz can coconut milk/ 3. Add oil (or melt butter) in a large frying pan, then add onions,curry powder, lemon or lime juice, cayenne, black pepper and salt. Stir slowly to blend flavours untl onions are translucent. 4. Add the coconut milk, then the chicken chunks. Simmer over low heat while you finish cooking the rice in the chicken stock. Serve the curry over the rice. Enjoy!

This dish was wonderful!! Just the right spice. I added green onions for color and a little salt too. I also used lite coconut milk and less fish sauce. I served it over yellow saffron rice. Delicious!!

This recipe was a hit! I doubled the amount of curry (panang) because it was pretty wimpy and used palm sugar (which is what they gave me at the Asian market when I asked for brown sugar) and served it over thai egg noodles, and had to sub in green onions because I forgot to pick up a yellow onion -- still (I'm not making this up) one of my guests actually licked her plate. A sure sign of a good meal if I've ever seen one (fill in your own West Va. joke here)

As is, the recipe needs fixing. I would halve the fish sauce and double the curry paste. The dish should be served over rice. I served it with sliced mango and a wonderful tomato chutney which counterbalanced the heat with some sweeter flavors giving the overall dish increased complexity. I garnished with basil leaves for color balance.

My husband and I are very fond of Thai food and both agreed that it is the best recipe we have found for making it at home. Thanks Bon Appetit.

Where was the spice? I followed the recipe to the letter but found this bland. So I doubled the curry paste and still found it bland. It was an okay recipe, but I won't bother making it again.

Tastes like something from a restaurant, and it only takes 11 minutes to cook!

I thought this was an excellent Thai Curry. Very simple to prepare and the taste was outstanding. I lightened the recipe by using light coconut milk but it did not alter the flavor at all. I added a bit more fish sauce and lime at the end. I served it with basmati rice and it was a good match. I will definately make this again and I too would experiment with Shrimp.

i found this to be pretty authentic, although next time i'd double up on the curry paste. i love the heat. }:) Next time i'll experiment with shrimp, scallop, and green curry paste.

This was a definite winner! I made it for guests and everyone loved it. Just like authentic Thai curry. I left out the fish sauce and served it in oversize bowls over steamed white rice. The rice is a must with the intense spice and all that sauce. Next time I would like to try it with Thai basil. We loved this one!
