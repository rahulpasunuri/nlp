This cake made people swoon last night! I couldn't find any cream of coconut for the filling so I ended up using light coconut milk which made it too soupy. I added a couple more tablespoons of cream cheese and about a tablespoon more sugar and it worked beautifully. I also used half sweetened and half unsweetened coconut for the filling because it's what I had on hand and I thought it was great. Not too sweet, but with great coconut flavor. We'll be seeing this one again soon as my husband declared thgis his new favorite cake and requested it for his birthday next month. Definite winner!

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use the coconut extract (forgot to buy it) and used coconut milk instead of regular.I really liked it but it was denser than I thought it would be--it was more like pound cake. The flavor was great, and my guests loved it.

Dense and delicious. Tastes like a Mounds bar in cake form. Definitely let the filling chill enough - mine ran a bit! Made the ganache with 2/3 bittersweet and 1/3 semisweet. Was good to have a balance because the filling is fairly sweet. Enjoy!

This is sort of like a take on a Boston creme pie. It was fairly easy to make and extremely tasty.

I made this for Easter. It's wonderful and looks terrific. Definitely make the day before. It cuts beautifully after setting up over night. One caution: When making the glaze the first time, I did not remove the hot cream from the heat before stirring in the chocolate and the mixture seized. I should know better! (Very expensive mistake.) But for a beginning cook, the directions don't tell you to remove from the heat, so I am telling you to do so.

I am "the cake lady" in my family, and i can say this was fantastic. My 3 favorite flavors together. Dense like pound cake, but with a delicate crumb. I DID use coconut milk, and it was great, very coconutty flavor. Accidentally forgot shredded coconut in batter, but did not regret. I will make again this weekend-doubling recipe and putting in bundt pan.

Awesome! I noticed no one has reviewed this recipe in awhile-I guess the time requirement makes everyone avoid it but it is by far one of the best recipes on epicurious. It takes quite awhile but can be done in stages-the filling took longer to thicken in the refrig than stated..I put all the chocolate on top as a frosting with no sauce to pass..served to several food critics and they loved it!

Question: Has anyone substituted coconut milk for whole milk in this recipe?

You foodies may put out a hit on me, but I super-simplified this cake and it turned out FAB-u-lously! :: deep breath :: I used a butter recipe cake-from-a-box mix and doctored it with a teaspoon of coconut extract and a teaspoon of almond extract. It was great and super-quick. No need for new bakers to be intimidated. I made the filling and glaze (the most important components IMHO) exactly as described in the recipe. It was such a huge hit there was a fight over the last piece. Pressed-for-time and below-average bakers unite!

I was prepared to love this cake, but found it disappointing. It was easy to make and looked gorgeous, but the cake was rather bland and there was not really enough filling. Not a really strong coconut flavor, either. The icing was good. Again, a good cake, but nothing great.

This is flat out the best cake I have ever tasted and it improves after one day in the fridge. If you like dark chocolate and coconut, like a Mounds Bar, this cake will not disappoint. Fattening, yes. Time consuming, yes. Worth every calorie and second of effort? YES! If I could have this for a wedding cake, I would. I tripled the recipe for my 40th birthday party and baked in an extra large baking pan with equally good results. Outstanding!

Incredible!!! The only thing I changed is I used milk chocolate, because that is what I like. It worked well. This does take some time. If you make the cake part the night before, it is no big deal. It just takes time to let things cool. I would even make it in a sheet pan and just use the filling for frosting. I think you would need to double the filling if doing that. Yummy!

A great cake! Not only did it taste delicious, it presented beautifully. I served it at a large dinner party and everyone raved. I only had skim milk and buttermilk, not whole milk, I used 1/4 cup of each. I cut the glaze by 1/3 and used the whole thing to glaze the cake and didn't bother with the side sauce. Wonderful!

Excellent cake!! Kind of complicated but defintely worth doing. I prefered it without the side sauce. I just put the extra sauce on the cake.

Yum!

This was pure heaven! My husband made it for my birthday and it was one of the best ever! Thankfully we didn't have anyone over this year so we could eat it all!!!

I made the cake for a party and wasn't able to serve it with the sauce, so I took the time to double glaze the cake. It was worth it!

I was a little afraid to make this after reading how difficult some people found it, but I think I psyched myself out because it wasn't bad at all. Lindt white chocolate worked great, and I used my food processor to work the almond paste into the cake batter. It was delicious! Not too sweet, and got rave reviews at my friends birthday dinner.

Has a good moist texture but it's the filling that makes this cake.

As I was wrapping up the prep of this cake at midnight last eve I would have said "never again!". However, the final product, sampled today, changes all of that.....very moist and rich! I would definitely suggest that if you want to double it, for a taller multi layered cake, that you do it in two complete separate batches. Few of us have bowls large enough to handle all of that batter and I ended up bringing my pasta pot into play. Do try it, but allow plenty of time and use a quality white chocolate. I had trouble getting the Ghiardelli to melt.

WOW!! I made this for a friend's birthday, a friend who gets rabid over chocolate & coconut. He absolutely loved it and so did everyone else who got to have some. I am generally not a cake-eater; but this is one cake that I could not get enough of. It's so moist. So yummy. It even tasted better the next day. This is a bit of a time-consuming recipe; but it's perfect, easy and I'm going to make it again this weekend just so I can have it all for myself. (Well, not really ALL to myself.)

As a novice cake baker, this was not the easiest one to start with, but definitely had great results. I wish there had been a photo so I knew what to expect with the end result, but I think my creation was close to what was intended. Cake was moist and delicious, and the filling was a coconut lovers treat. Served for dessert to an at-home Oscar's party- quite a hit. Careful when serving to guests, coconut can be a love-hate for most people. Would definitely make again.

This was a great recipe! I have actually made it 3 times within the past month and I am not against making it again. Just don't be afraid of creating a little mess with the glaze.

Rating: 4
This is I think the best cake I have ever made. It is extremely labor-intensive and tedious, and I wonder in the end if it is worth all the work. I guess I would make it again for a VERY special occasion. The finished product was beautiful, and its beauty was only surpassed by its taste.

This cake was amazing, extremely rich, but absolutly amazing. I thought that it was much better the next day after the glaze had stiffened and all of the flavors had melded. It stayed moist and delicious for a week afterwards! It tasted sort of like a really good petit-fore.

I made this cake for my birthday and it was excellent. Everyone loved it! It takes a very long time to make though and the ingredients are rather expensive. It's a great cake for special occasions. I did not have a 9 x 2 cake pan, so I made it in 2 smaller pans. That worked out really well because I did not have to bother with slicing the cake in half.

I doubled this recipe and made a 4-layer cake for my boyfriend's birthday. Everyone said it looked like a professional cake. It tasted so good. The best coconut cake I've had. I served it with vanilla ice cream, the chocolate glaze and topped with sliced almonds. A definite keeper!
