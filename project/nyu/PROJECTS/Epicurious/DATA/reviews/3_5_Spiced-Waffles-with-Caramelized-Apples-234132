This recipe made the best waffles I have ever tasted! I read the other reviews about overfilling the waffle iron and changed the amount per serving to 1/2 cup. Other than that, it was fantastic!

I used pears for the caramelized sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's one of the few instances where one waffle square seemed like enough. The sauce is amazing. The waffle tasted great. One person had ice cream with hers, and said that was fantastic.

This was a great change from my usual plain buttermilk waffles. Still, I was a bit disappointed to watch a thicker, less honeyed batter pour from the waffle iron. Also, it was heartbreaking to learn that halving the honey did nothing to prevent the waffles from sticking to the iron. The flavor was great. I want to make them again so that I may figure out how to address these problems.

Simply amazing! Everyone I serve them two says they're the best they've ever eaten. FYI: Recipe only makes 2 waffles. You really need to serve the apples with the waffles. The apples make the waffles taste even better! Follow apple recipe exactly or they won't caramelize.

I agree with the previous reviewer that this recipe would make better pancakes than waffles. Even when I used a much smaller amount of batter than I normally would, it came gushing out the sides of my waffle iron, leaving huge pools of wasted batter. They had a great flavor, by were soft and flat like pancakes.

Good flavor, but the high suger content of the batter caused the waffles to stick to my waffle iron, despite liberal use of vegetable oil. If I make it again, I'll try using it as a pancake batter.
