I made this with a different blue cheese (Sage Blue) and less heavy cream, and no basil. Delicious comfort food. Next time I will make it as per instructions and Im certain it will only be more awesome.

super easy and delicious. i used 2% milk instead of cream and it wasn't heavy at all. would definitely make again.

Agree with previous reviewer to use full cup of gorgonzola, however hold back 1/4 to sprinkle on top to really bring out the flavor of the cheese. When melted into the sauce, it loses a bit of the "tangy" flavor we love in gorgonzola. And a little extra thyme adds great flavor.

This was a huge hit! It's so rich that you can easily get 4 main course servings or 8 appetizer servings from the recipe as written. I followed the suggestion of others here and increased the gorgonzola to 1 full cup. Elegant enough for a dinner party and so easy!

It was good and dead easy. Important facts! Good use of left over gorgonzola cheese but wouldn't really go out of my way to buy ingredients to make this.

Excellent! This was really easy to make and everyone loved it. I used 3/4 cup cream and a full cup of gorgonzola and was pleased with the consistency. Would definitely make this again.

Agree with review that said there is way too much cream in this recipe! The finished product is too runny, causing the walnuts to sink to the bottom. Next time would add a bit more Gorgonzola and significantly less cream.

Served with steak and salad with blue cheese. Nice dish, not hard to make & very tasty. Creaminess nice on a cool fall day!

Tasted good, but the amount of cream turned it from sauce into soup.

This dish is awesome. The only thing I would change would be to add a bit of salt and more gorgonzola cheese. Other than that this was a home run!

This is a classic recipe - it's REALLY good if you add in a bosc or other pear, cored and thinly sliced, maybe even cut the slices in half to make them bite sized. And if you can get a pasta made with spinach, that tastes delicious in this recipe as well.
