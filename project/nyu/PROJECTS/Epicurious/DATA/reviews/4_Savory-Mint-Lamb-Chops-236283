Super delicious. This is my go-to lamb chop recipe. We're not big on fresh mint... this is absolutely outstanding without it. For us, the amounts of both salt and cayenne are perfect. It's simple to throw together, quick from start to table (I do grill these, which makes a gorgeous crust on the chops every time), and showstopper flavor. The recipe says marinate 10 minutes... most certainly, the cayenne glow will intensify if the meat marinates for hours. Don't do that. :)

Wow! I would order these in a restaurant and go back to that same restaurant just for these wonderful lamb chops. The fact that I can make them in my own home in a short amount of time is a bonus. The recipe itself: the only thing I changed was the amounts of cayenne and black pepper. I halved the amount and they were delicious. I also followed others suggestions and left them out - room temp - for an hour. My family were licking their fingers and asking when I'd be making them again. This one's a keeper!

I'm in the midst of making this dish and had to take a break to write down my thoughts. I think I would cut back the salt by half or more. I minced and chopped and put this together and then decided it would do better by being made into more of a paste. This does better in a food processor. No one wants chunks of garlic or mint -- more of a wonderful smooth flavour to go with lamb.

I liked this recipe ok, but I felt that the marinade somewhat overpowered the lamb. But then, I'm someone who really likes the flavor of lamb. I cut the salt and cayenne in half, but we still felt it was too spicy. On the other hand, I only made used 5 lamb chops, so maybe I was too heavy-handed with the marinade.

Also forgot to say, we did not include the cayenne and we seared the loin chops in a frying pan first. Finished them in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes (flipping them halfway through).

Great recipe. We will be making it again. However, we will definitely be cutting the salt...way too salty for us.

So easy and so so good! Left out the cayenne pepper as recommended by many others. We seared on top of stove and then put it in oven for about 35 minutes. This is one of my favorites and I can't wait to cook it again.

My father requested for lamb as he was recovering from being ill. I had never cooked lamb before. Ever. Facing the daunting task, I chose this recipe as the ingredients sounded good and the recipe made sense and seemed very easy. It certainly was. My family was in amazement. I felt like a celebrated chef that evening. Thanks, Epicurious. I will most certainly make this again for a mid- week dinner or for a sophisticated celebratory evening, or even for my husband's boss.

Easy and Excellent! Didn't change a thing - Great for a weeknight dinner - the kids loved it as well. This is definitely a keeper!

Very easy and delicious. I cut the cayenne by half. Great use for the fresh mint that likes to take over my garden! I look forward to trying a grilled lamb rack using this seasoning mix.

This was delicious! Like some other reviewers, I skipped the cayenne completely. It was fast, easy and everybody liked it. I could have made more sauce and cooked it separately - the sauce was so good, we wanted more. I left it on the lamb for about an hour at room temp. Will definitely make this again!

This was a great recipe. Simple but delicious. I had only 5 1-1.5 inch chops. I made the marinade with dried mint, and it turned out fine. I let them sit with marinade all day, and then grilled for 5-6 minutes per side for MR. Excellent.

Great, easy dinner. I agree with the reviewer who said it is simple and perfect. Love it.

My boyfriend absolutely loves lamb and he really enjoyed this recipe! It's so simple and quick. I'll definitely be making it again!

I have been making this recipe for the last year+ and haven't found one that I like better. It's simple and perfect. Like a previous commenter I sear on the stovetop and finish in the oven, and a few times have replace the oven step with pouring in some chicken stock and covering and finishing on the stovetop. The lamb is milder and more tender that way (I prefer it with more of a crust, but it's good to mix it up.) I'll repeated the same warning on the cayenne, it's totally dependent on how long you let it sit before cooking and 10min is just about perfect for a light glow. I think the cayenne really adds to the dish if done right.

easy and delicious. I have made it several times for guests and for just the 4 of us. I have only used dried mint with great results. Always rave reviews from the guests and even the little children love it, especially my picky 2 year old.

Delicious! I found the cayenne to be perfect for my taste. Served with sauteed carrots and fennel from this site and smashed red potatoes. A lovely meal.

Prepared as written except for omitting cayenne. Excellent. Served with Mashed Potatoes with Sage and White Cheddar Cheese.

I halved the cayenne per other reviewers, and extended the marinating time to about an hour out of the fridge. For winter, great with the shaved brussels sprouts with lemon and pine nuts from this site. I'll try them again in spring with asparagus. This is just the perfect amount of spice - they still taste like lamb, it doesn't take away from the natural flavor of the meat. I used lamb chops from the frozen section of Trader Joe's. They were good but I might try to find a little better quality next time.

This is a great recipe if you don't like the taste of lamb, because the cayenne pepper totally overwhelms it. I really like lamb, so if I was making this again, I'd leave it out. I haven't totally written this off, what I could taste of the other spices was good, and without the pepper this might be a pretty good recipe.

Wonderful, the best way to make lamb chops. The mint becomes very subtle and it looks beautiful. I don't think lamb chops need much help, they are wonderful with just a little salt and pepper, but this makes it just a bit more fancy with almost no effort.

This recipe has become a staple. It's super fast and easy, but tastes fancy. We grow fresh mint, and this is a great way to appreciate it.

Fantastic! Although, the cayenne was a little too much for my husband, I loved it! Next time we make this, we'll leave out the cayenne or use just a pinch! :)

Fantastic! I have to admit I never have time to cook, but from working in restaurants for years, this was a GREAT surprise, added to my new fav. recipies. I took out the cayenne, but they turned out great. Served with a spinach and lemon couscous and a New Zealand Sauv. Blanc. I love this website!

A lot of impact for such a simple and quick recipe. Served it with a minted yogurt (fresh mint, thick yogurt, garlic and salt) for a cool conrast to the heat of the marinade.

Wonderful! We made the marinade exactly as in the recipe. Instead of broiling, we grilled them over high heat for the same time specified in the recipe. Gave it a nice crust with a very tender, moist inside.

This dish was fabulous! I followed the advice of my fellow Canadian reviewer from Toronto, and marinated the lamb chops for one hour. I used fresh mint, a little extra garlic, pepper, olive oil, and garam marsala as I was out of ground cumin. I also only used half the salt, and no cayenne ( I wasn't going to use it in the marinade and then just forgot to add it before cooking). I broiled mine for 4 minutes on one side, and then 3 minutes on the other. I agree with the Toronto reviewer who mentioned that she/he is in restaurants often and that this dish was at least as good or better than many entrees available. I will definitely make it again. We used New Zealand lamb loin chops, and served it with asparagus, baked sweet potatoes, and an Australian Shiraz. Delicious!

I have to say this was so outstanding, both my husband and I couldn't stop talking about it. I ran out of black pepper so I used white and added and extra 1/2 tsp, Packed down the mint and marinated the lamb 1 hour (without the cayenne pepper) before I seared the meat and roasted I at 350 till meat was a bit firm. I eat at a lot of restaurants in the city and this blew (Ill be nice) most of them away.

This is an amazing and simple recipe that even people who say "I don't like lamb" will like. A few tips: the longer you leave the herb mixture to set the hotter it gets from the cayenne. I think the cayenne is just about perfect with the 10min standing period; for a big dinner party I made the mixture two hours before and it was a lot hotter. If you're going to make ahead add the cayenne at the end. We like this best with searing the lamb in a skillet on both sides and then finishing in a 400deg oven until the meat is 155.

We did not broil, just fry on olive oil a minute to form a crust, amdnthen finish them up in the oven. Amazing dish!
