The flavor of this was lovely, a very intense chocolate with the perfect amount of orange to make it interesting. I was disappointed in the texture though, mine turned out a bit heavier than I would've liked. I was hoping for a silkier texture. I followed the recipe exactly and wonder if perhaps I needed to cook it for slightly less time. Because the flavor was great and it's an easy make-ahead recipe, I'll probably try it again and start checking it at 30 minutes. I didn't want to do that this time because I was afraid of letting the steam out of the tin foil and ruining the process.

I have made this at least 10 times with perfect results every time. I did take the advise of 'mollywallace' about the water bath and cooking but otherwise followed it exactly. I, and everyone I make it for, love this recipe, even my husband who's not big on orange flavored things. I also used the cooled sugar water from the orange peel as a sweetener for the whipped cream.

Not sure what happened. I followed the recipe as written only to find this recipe boiled over into the pan of water and came out curdled. Half of the recipe was lost in the water bath. It also tasted grainy. I am a really good cook and rarely have something this bad happen to a recipe I try. The chocolate taste is intense. I may have to turn the oven temperature and not cook as long.

I just prepared it, the taste is delicious, however it doesn't look so appetizing. I definitely have to cover it up with whipped cream. the texture looks curdeled, when I taste it it is very smooth and melt in the mouth. I must have made a mistake. Bur where? I double the recipe and put i tin 3 oz glass ramekins. I also used orange aroma instead of Orange Liquer. Otherwise I followed the recipe, I filled the baking dish with hot water, was that a mistake? Can somebody give me an advice? Thanks

Lovely and silken, especially when strained through cheesecloth. I'm not sure I'd bother with the candied orange peel again, but it's a festive garnish.

These were really easy and delicious. They are also a great way to use up extra egg yolks! I increased the recipe by half and it filled four 7 oz ramekins. I will make this many more times.

First off, make extra sure the bitter white pith is completely removed - the strips should be orange on both sides. Secondly, you don't need to cook them for 45 minutes, but it does help to boil them a bit - put some cold water in a pot along with the strips and bring them to a boil and cook them for a few minutes. Then repeat this a few more times, straining the strips and using fresh water each time to remove the bitterness. Then proceed as the recipe states, cooking in the simple syrup, etc.

I tried making the candied orange peel only from this recipe, and the results were so bitter I spat it in the sink and brushed my teeth. Does it matter the kind of orange? After the poor results, I saw another recipe that calls for cooking the peel for 45 minutes--could this be the difference?

Love it! I serve it in antique egg cups - beautiful and when else do you get to use them? Only note - use chop sticks to transfer orange peel to sugar - much neater!

This is a great recipe! I doubled it and had enough to make 10 in 4 - 4.5 oz ramekins. If you do this, best to fill the pan to halfway up the ramekins with boiling water, and cook uncovered for only about 20-25 minutes. Excellent, easy and delicious!

excellent desert!!!, for an added twist, I added some nutella in the bottom of a bowl, heated in the microwave for 25 sec. then put the pudding on top with the cream and candied orange peel. My family couldn't get enough!!!

I skipped the whipped cream and candied orange peel, but the pots de creme were absolutely amazing on their own! Rich, dense, and smooth, they were everything pots de creme should be. One note: although the recipe is for two servings, I ended up with four ramikins full. Of course, I'm hardly going to complain about leftovers. I made them for my Valentine's Day; they were so rich, my BF and I couldn't finish ours.

These little pots de creme were a divine treat this past week-end. There was enough filling for 3 custard cups (I didn't measure them, so maybe they're smaller than 8 oz.). I baked the pots a bit longer than 40 minutes before they tested done with the clean knife test. Smooth, creamy and delicious! Unfortunately, I was short on time and didn't get the candied peels made. Next time, for sure....

The absolute best chocolate cream pots ever. I have tried several other recipes on epicurious.com, and none have been as creamy. A chocolate lover's dream. And the orange peeels are divine too.

Very rich, but this was a hit! Chocolate orange is yummy.

The best part of this recipe were the orange peels. I cooked the custard for 40 minutes, and while it looked fine when it came out of the oven, at "eating" time it was soupy and grainy in the middle, and much too sweet for my taste. There are much better chocolate pudding recipies out there!

This was divine!!! I made it for a dinner party of six. Note that I tripled the recipe ingredients except by mistake I only added 7 yolks because I made a mistake. To my surprise the chocolat still turned out perfect. You can't go wrong with this. Instead of dipping the orange slices into the sugar, sprinkle the sugar on the slices and it won't clump.

This is an excellent dessert, HOWEVER, cooking it in a bain marie covered with foil (as directed) resulted in curdled, overcooked pots de creme. I made it again and just eliminated the foil, and started checking on it after 30 minutes and the result was beautiful (make sure you cook it just until edges are set and center is still jiggly--it will firm up in the refrigerator). Fabulous dessert! The candied orange peel with whipped cream on top makes it look (and taste) like a professional, 4-star dessert. One more note: the recipe as written makes much more than two servings, especially since most standard custard ramekins are 6-oz size (and it's so rich you don't want too much) This is definitely on my dinner party menu rotation!

How decadent!! Had this for a special Valentine dinner with dear friends....and have made it 2 times since then. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out silky, intense and delicious every time.

I made this for our Valentine dinner dessert and my hubby loved it! Of course I did too! It was smooth, rich and had just the right amount of orange flavor to give it some interest. YUM!!!

I used cheesecloth and a metal strainer together and the results were very silky. I didn't have any orange liqueur on hand and it still was delicious. Had to guard my serving from my husband's spoon!

I made this for my Valentine last night and was very disappointed! I followed the recipe exactly and used the best ingredients. It turned out grainy, not smooth or silky. The chocolate flavor was not intense. The candied orange strips were the best part of the recipe. There are lots of recipes out there for chocolate puddings of all sorts that are infinitely better than this one!

Came out grainy and watery although I used very high quality ingredients. should I have tempered the eggs or did I cook it too long?

Being at 6500 ft, I bumped up the heavy cream to 2/3 C and used 5 lg. yolks, also incresing the coking time by about 7-8 minutes. It Came out like SILK!
