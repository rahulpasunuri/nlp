made this salad today was very delicious! The dressing started to seperate a bit, but I just mixed it again. I added orange segments to mine and tossed the chopped beet greens into the whole thing, looked very nice.

beautiful and healthy dish, but I thought lacked a little flavor. I followed the recipe except used it as a slaw and didn't put it on the greens

Love this salad. Hard to stop eating. No changes to the recipe except used soy sauce in place of miso. I did make it several hours ahead so the flavors would meld. Served it as a slaw, no need for greens. Will definitely make again -- for beet lovers it's a wonderful recipe, especially in the summer when its too hot to heat the oven to roast beets.

Quite good, but didn't care for the sesame salt.

I didn't have coriander seeds, so I toasted the ground coriander I had and it worked fine. I added 1-2 teaspoons sugar/honey to dressing and made it all in the food processor.

Really good! Personally I ate it by itself like coleslaw- I think it can stand on it's own without putting on top of greens. Could be a colorful side dish at a summer BBQ...

This is so good! I love this recipe, and its a great way to get more beets in your diet (which are crazy good for you). I made it as written, and it was exceptional. It's now part of my weekly rotation.

I have made this salad several times since I first saw it on Epicurous. It is colorful, healthy and delicious. I would not attempt it without a food processor to shred the beets and carrots but most of the work can be finished ahead of time. I also always add something to it such as raisins, or walnuts.

shredded raw beets are delicious in salads. No need to cook them--you'll miss the crunchy texture.

Do not cook the beets. Shredding makes them more than tender enough to eat and the dressing will also soften them. This salad is delicious!!

Oh no, don't cook the beets...there's nothing nicer than a freshly grated beet salad, especially fresh out of the garden! Haven't tried this yet but have eaten raw beets many times and love them....look forward to this version:)

Always cook beets. Wash, cut off greens (but not root tip) and steam. Skin should then rub off with a dry paper towel. I haven't made this dish yet, but it looks great! I plan on adding sunflower seeds, flax, and sliced almond.

I have the same question as the first reviewer. The beets look cooked in the picture but its not mentioned that the beets are precooked

Haven't made this yet and am confused over whether to cook the beets before shredding them. They look cooked in the picture and I've never eaten raw beets before. Help!! I'm in the process of making this for a dinner party tonight.

This is very tasty! tweaked a couple of things - used lime instead of orange for juice and rind, and used walnut oil for more flavour.Delicious!
