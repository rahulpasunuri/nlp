I've been making this since it first appeared, with no changes -- easy and delicious as is. Do keep stirring as you heat or it sticks to the bottom of the pot. Very filling -- just add bread, and it's dinner. My kids love it.

Although quick, just not good. I added come chili powder for some kick and it helped.

While travelling in Mexico, we tried this soup for the first time and loved it. When we came home, I wanted to try to make it and found this recipe. I substitued 1 bunch of fresh spinach chopped for frozen and 2 medium potatoes for the packaged soup. Also added a splash of white wine, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. curry. Did not use any sour cream and instead used 1/2 c. cream. Also added 1/4 c. celery chopped (including leaves). Garnished with fresh grated parmesan. My guests were very impressed and asked for the recipe. I combined a few recipes that I found and this turned out to be fantastic.

First of all i used fresh spinach (less thick texture) and it really was bland. so i added chicken broth, scallions, a bit of sharp cheddar cheese, more lemon and chardonnay. it ended up excellent!

This soup is very bland; thick and tasteless. I would recommend adding additional lemon juice and scallions to spice it up.

This recipe was wonderful! I added 1/4 cup of shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Also, I served it hot but did not blend the soup as suggested. (I just left the spinach and chunks of potatoes as is. I made the recipe for our annual church Soup & Stew Cookoff & won Second Place!

Very easy, light and good. I served it hot, but I can tell it would also be good cold - especially with a bit more lemon juice and maybe some sherry.

If spinach souflee is not available, frozen spinach couald be used as a substitute. In that case however, bring the potato cream and spinach to a boil to soften the spinach, and then work in the food processor. Drop the time, add more salt, and you can get a nice cream soup.

Yes! I would make it again! I used skim milk and that probably helped with thinning the soup a bit, but not too much. I also topped each serving off with Lemon Pepper seasoning and it was delicious. I prefer this soup cold and down here we love that! Thanks for a wonderful, quick recipe! KIMBER

I love spinach and this recipe sounded great, but it wasn't -- it was bland, very thick, and not even as good as something you can get in a can! I won't bother making it again.

We found a 12oz box of spinach souffle and used the whole thing in making this soup. However, we that the soup was to thick and a bit bland even though I added salt and additional pepper and lemon juice. Next time I will try using more milk and less spinach souffle. It definately needs salt.

Incredible! Didn't even add any thyme or salt - it just tasted so good. All I had was 2% and before I added even that it was delicious. Serve small portions, it's very rich and very flavorful. Couldn't believe how quick it was!

This dish was absolutely delicious! Guests were skeptical because some weren't spinach eaters, but this one won them over.

This soup was so easy to make--I think it took all of 5 minutes to mix the ingredients and maybe 15 minutes to boil--and it was so delicious! I highly recommend it.
