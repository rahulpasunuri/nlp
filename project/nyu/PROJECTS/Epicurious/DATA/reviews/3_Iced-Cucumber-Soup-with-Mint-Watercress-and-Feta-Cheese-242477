I live in Cyprus (greek island off the med) and its where yoghurt and feta is at its best. I made this and thought it was a bit too fresh with no depth so i added 2 tablespoons of lime and mango chutney and a teaspoon of thai curry paste to give it a kick. and the difference was amazing, try it.

I made a spinoff of this recipe with kefir instead of yogurt. It was very nice.

Nice and refreshing. The cucumber is a little overwhelmed by feta, but still a good flavor.

I like this healthy summer soup and have made it already three or four times. It is crisp and refreshing, although my partner complained about the feta. Be generous with the garlic to insure a good flavor.

This turned out terrible. My brother likened it to a dip--if it were one, I wouldn't use it. It was feeble in flavor despite using goat milk feta and sheep milk yogurt (some diners could not have cow's milk). A lot of expensive ingredients for a soup no one really wanted to eat.

This wasn't a particularly special soup. I used Persian cucumbers but regular cucumbers would do. The difference in taste is so subtle and in the finished soup, the cucumber flavor is overpowered by the feta and other ingredients anyway. My boyfriend likened the soup to a pureed greek salad.
