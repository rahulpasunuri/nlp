This was a big hit. I served it to guests and they later asked for the recipe. Great alternative to sausage gravy for those who don't eat "four leggers!"

Delicious! Genius! You won't believe what beans can do. This has wonderful flavor and is pretty simple to make. We had it with the breakfast patties also on this site. I am going to try it with Gardein chicken breast and wild rice.

Super gravy, but try adding vegetable broth instead of water. It adds a 'back' flavor that does not cover the wonderful flavor of the original recipe.

This is an easy, tasty, vegetarian gravy that is very forgiving with the ingredients. I've made it without the onion and without the thyme, and been pleased each time. Perfect with a lot of pepper and over some split biscuits. (or off of a fork if you're like me)

I blended sauted shittake mushrooms with rosemary with this recipe and it was delicious.

This comes out very much like meat based gravy. I poured it over fresh drop biscuits and couldn't be more delighted. It would probably be great on mashed potatoes too.
