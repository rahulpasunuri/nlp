This is a very good salad with excellent dressing. I don't like black eyed peas so put canned corn instead. It's a good lunchbox meal, and I can see it being a popular side dish in bbq season or for a potluck supper.

I made this bean salad for a picnic at a winery. It was terrific. Easy to assemble, stored well (even better the next day!) and a beautiful, colorful presentation. Like other reviewers, I suggest tasting the salad before tossing all the dressing with the beans--you may want less, or you may want to adjust the dressing to your own taste. I've made this recipe several times, since, and everyone seems to love it.

I really like this salad and have made it a few times. The dressing is excellent, and it's always popular.

Very tasty, summery and eye-catching salad. I made it twice the first week I got the recipe.

This was very pretty, but the texture of all the canned beans was terrible. I think this might be better with fresh beans, but it would take a long time. Neither my two guests, nor the 3 kids, nor my husband liked it. I think bean dishes are difficult.

My family really enjoyed this dish. I found it easy to prepare and the many colored beans made for a nice presentation. I caution other cooks to not add the entire recipe of Champagne Vinaigrette without taste testing along the way. You may find that you like a heavy dressing. I thought the ratio of beans to dressing was off. I will add 75% of the vinaigrette dressing when I make this dish again.

I needed a new salad for a big (~50 people) BBQ that I have each summer. This recipe looked great: delicious, easy to make, healthy, attractive, and complementary to the rest of the menu. It seemed to fit the bill, but I was a little nervous as Id never made it and it had no reviews. Fortunately, it was a huge hit, with both the guests and me! I made the salad and the champagne vinaigrette the day before, but kept separate and combined just before serving, which worked fine and helped a lot with prep. Minor dressing substitutions (white wine for champagne vinegar, 1T brown sugar for the honey).
