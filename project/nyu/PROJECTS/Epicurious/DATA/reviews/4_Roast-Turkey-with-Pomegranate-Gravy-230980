Holy doodle this was good! And the colour is really nice too. To simplify the recipe I made the pomegranate syrup the day before. I did not bother with the lets make a caramel and then add juice so we can risk boiling sugar splashes over Christmas - I just mixed the sugar and syrup cold and boiled them until thickened. This is safer and it tastes the same. The extra syrup is nice over ice cream too!

Made the gravy again, this time with the Thanksgiving Turkey. Very rich, but the pomegranate cuts through nicely.

I am only reviewing the gravy, and the gravy is outstanding! I look forward to this gravy with turkey. Comments from my guests are that bread, turkey, potatoes, become a "vehicle" to get this gravy in to your mouth! to help with time I premake the pomegranite syrup the night before. Also I just cut a pomegranate in half and juice it with a counter top run of the mill juicer. works perfectly.

The gravy was very flavourful - the fresh pomegranate juice complemented the rich taste very well. All my guests loved this 'special gravy' - it was a hit.

I made this a year or two ago but when I started thinking about turkey this year I couldn't stop thinking about this gravy.

I have to apologise, I'm only reviewing the recipe for the gravy, to accompany a large roast chicken. The gravy, made using chicken drippings and stock was fantastic. The remarkable thing about it was, despite using a chicken base, it tasted just like turkey! You could definitely pick up the sweetness of the pomegranate syrup, but it had a very prominent turkey flavour. I can only imagine what it would be like, made with turkey juices. I can highly recommend the gravy.

What makes this dish unique is the gravy, but adding butter also helps keep it juicy without it tasting buttery. After trying to get the butter into every crevice, I found it easier to leave squares of butter under the skin of each breast. The legs have more fat on them so I didn't leave too much butter there. For presentation, in addition to tieing the legs and wings in, I think it looks nicer to snip off the wing tips with a pair of strong scissors. The gravy is terrific and the two most important things are straining through a cloth to get a better consistency, and skimming as much fat as possible off the top.

This was our recipe last year, it was so good I came back to find it again. I love the idea of using the pom juice with marsala and orange juice as well - maybe I'll try that to change it upa bit this year! I can't wait! We don't typically enjoy gravy either, this is so complex and fresh!

Thank you for the recipe. It was just delicious. For the gravy I used up fructose instead of sugar and did not have the trouble of the syrop burning.

Complex flavor and beautiful color. However, it takes 4 hands to make before the turkey gets cold. There has to be a way to sweeten the pomagranate syrup without carmelizing the sugar and SLOWLY stirring in the juice.

This sounds delicious. I made something similar this thanksgiving, but instead of the gravy, I basted my turkey breast with a reduced pomegranate juice sauce to which I added about a quarter cup of marsala and a couple of tablespoons of orange peach mango juice (I didn't have just regular orange juice.) I used 2about 2 cups of POM pomegranate juice which tastes just like fresh pomegranates and is sold at most grocery stores these days. The turkey breast had a beautiful deep brown color, and it was one of the most delicious I've ever made, really juicy and succulent which isn't always easy when you're just cooking the breast. I like really seasoned skin so i had seasoned the turkey earlier and marinated it before I cooked it. I'm not a big gravy person but next time I would love to try it with this suggested gravy using the POM juice instead of doing all the work. (I'm always willing to try something easier if it doesn't undermine the taste or the quality of the food.)

Bought Knudsen's "just pomegranate", and it still tasted great. I also did the "alton brown method", by cooking at 500 degrees for first 1/2 hour. This was my first time trying it this way, and it was the juiciest turkey I've ever had. Really delicious! The gravy was a really nice, untraditional addition.

Well, pomegranates may be easy to juice, but they are a PAIN to deseed! I seeded 2 pomegranates and whizzed the seeds in the blender for just a few seconds and the juice turned out great, and really beautiful. Tasty gravy, slightly sweet. Turkey turned out really well but did 500 for 30 mins, then 325 for the rest of the time, with no basting. Juicy! Apart from the cooking instructions, followed the recipe. Yummy.

I have nade similiar sauces using "Pomegranate Molasses" from Lebanon, available widely in Middle Eastern groceries, under brand name Cortas among others. It's a thick, tart, pomegranate syrup commonly used in seasoning meat dishes.

I have also not tried this yet, but I know you can get pomegranite juice and syrup at Middle eastern specialty stores and some delicatessens.

Have not made this recipe, but read through it. One store-bought juice that might not be too sweet is R.W. Knudsen's "Just Pomegranate." It's quite tart just like the fruit. PomWonderful juice may be too sweet since there's other fruit juices added. It might be worth a try to save yourself the mess of juicing a pomegranate!
