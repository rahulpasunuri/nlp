This was superb. This tart made me look like I was a freakin' chef. Everyone commented on it. I didnt change a single thing.

I made this twice and I thought that this was really delicious. I did 2 layers of raspberries and half the butter in the crust and filling.The 2nd time I did it, it was for the fourth of July and I doubled the recipe and made in the shape of an American flag. I used blueberries for the blue part and whipped cream for the stripes and stars. It came out really cool! I really liked the way that this was tart and sweet at the same time. I recommend this recipe very much to everyone.

this was very tasty, possibly 4 forks. this is exceptional in that it's very, very tasty and is also fairly simple and feels decadent. nice for guests. couple of notes: i cut the butter in the filling by almost half and added in a little under a quarter cup of milk after the butter was mixed in. i think it tasted plenty rich and buttery this way. i used a 10" tart ceramic tart pan. the crust was a little high compared to the filling, but not bad, esp for crust lovers like myself. i also had freshly picked strawberries so i cut thin slices (~1/4") and first lined the bottom with those, then topped with raspberries. agree that the tart crust should only cook maybe 10 minutes (i think 9 would have been perfect in my oven) b/c the edges were a little too dark/dry by the end. prob b/c of the 10" tart pan, but i only cooked filling/fruit for a little under 35 minutes. check it at 30. served it with vanilla ice cream. yum!

Delicious. I bought extra raspberries as suggested elsewhere and had enough to serve fresh raspberries with the tart. Another easy and delicious raspberry recipe at Epicurious is the Raspberry Cake with Marsala, Crème Fraîche, and Raspberries http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/views/Raspberry-Cake-with-Marsala-Creme-Fraiche-and-Raspberries-106658#ixzz1oTqKm9ZF

So good, loved this recipe!! I added a layer of mini chocolate chips onto the crust before the raspberries, just a little extra touch of decadence.

An excellent, easy-to-make tart that puts raspberries in a starring role. The browned butter gives this treat extra excellent flavor. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Wow...smelled soooo good when baking with the browned butter and I love raspberries. My tart came out perfectly but I don't get what all the rave reviews are about. Decent tart, but the two flavors -the rich browned butter and the sweet/tart raspberries cancelled each other out.

I loved this recipe. Very simple and turned out great. Made it for Mother's Day and it was loved by all!

This is a really delicious dessert, its simple as well. Not very time consuming. The only notes i have to make is that if you are using the suggested pan size, you will need more raspberries than suggested.

This tart tasted wonderful, but it had WAY too much butter in it. I think next time I would make it with a drier "pate sable" but maybe with the same topping. I added chopped up apple to the fruit mix. Yum!

I have made this tart many times and it's always a hit! Great when raspberries go on sale! It's very easy and makes a great dessert to take to a party. I have also used the crust recipe as a base for a chocolate crust for a different tart by adding 3 TBSP of cocoa and about half an ounce more butter. That actually will fit a 10 inch tart pan. Great recipe.

Browning butter in the microwave isn't heretical. Substituting olive oil for butter, however, is. Highly recommend you don't do that...

Rating: 3
Googled "brown butter in microwave". Worked great. Is this heretical? Tart good but will try using olive oil instead of butter in filling.

Brown Butter for a tart. What a concept! I had to reduce the crust since I only had a 9" pie pan and was lacking a springform. I also only backed my crust for about 15 minutes and tented with tin foil toward the end of the 40 min bake time. I used blackberries and served it with a maple and cinnamon whipped cream. In a word, phenomenal.

Followed the recipe (almost) exactly; followed another reviewer's advice and only cooked my crust for 11 minutes (perfect!). Quick, easy and DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper.

Outstanding. Love the nutty brown butter flavor with the not-too-sweet raspberries. The essence of summer-- I know I will be dreaming of this in the dead of winter.

this is an excellent recipe. Made with both blackberries and rasberries. I covered loosely with foil for last 10 minutes of bake time. Came out absolutely perfect! Yumm.

I have made this several times, always to rave reviews. It's so easy! The hardest part is browning the butter. USE GOOD BUTTER. Watch your heat. My stove runs hot, so I brown it on Medium Low. Last time I made it I used blackberries. It was outstanding!

This was amazing. Not only does it have great flavor, but it also looks elegant and sophisticated when serving to guests. My crust browned quickly as well during the first baking so check it before the indicated time. Served it with whipped cream and creme fraiche. The next day had it with vanilla ice cream....all three made wonderful accompaniments!

Delicious and beautiful. Would be a great holiday recipe. I made it in a pie pan and did not build the crust all the way to the top so the filling was at the edges so it didn't burn.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it disappeared too quickly, leaving everyone wanting more. This year I made 2. One was devoured after dinner, the other disappeared as everyone took a piece of it home with them. It's slightly sweet, slightly tart, but mostly savory. Good butter is a must. I used Plurga. In order to have a crust at the outer edges, I needed to make the bottom pretty thin. This may help people who have had problems with the edges burning.

I've had this made for me before and it truly is wonderful! I was thinking of altering it for Thanksgiving by using pears and cranberries instead of rasberries. Any opinions?

This was wonderful-I tried it for a 'girl's weekend' dessert and everyone had seconds. It was fast and easy, and the combination of the brown butter and fresh raspberries was just delicious. I followed other suggestions of not cooking the crust as long, and mine was perfectly cooked after about 11 minutes. It turns out much like the picture. I had to make everyone copies of the recipe they liked it so much. I have to make it tonight for my boyfriend, who heard reviews from my girlfriend, because he is jealous! You need to try this!

Tasted wonderful, but edges of crust were very burned by the time the filling was cooked.

I thought this was delicious. We love raspberries and this was a lovely vehicle for them. I love trying new desserts, but will certainly make this again. It's an easy recipe that yields a very tasty result.

This tart is simply fabulous. Very easy to prepare. It's very rich and tasty. Even if one doesn't like raspberries they just might like this tart. It is that good. Be sure to check crust at least 5 minutes before stated time since mine baked a bit quicker. Also, since butter is a key player be sure to use a good butter. I used Lurpak. This is a real winner.

I am making this tart for the 5th time tonight to take to a book club meeting tomorrow. The 4 previous times that I made it I used fresh sweet cherries, which I halved and arranged cut side down, I cut the sugar slightly in the filling because the cherries were so sweet and I subsituted almond extract for the vanilla. The tart is wonderful and I think it's even better the second day. Be patient with the crust assembly, it looks like there won't be enough dough to cover the bottom and sides of the 9 inch pan but it does work if you take the time to evenly press the dough into the pan. The dough does puff significantly on the bottom so don't worry about it being too thin. I take my crust out at 14 mins. when golden brown. I think 18 is too long and my oven is fairly new and true to temp. The first time I made this I threw away several sticks of butter getting the brown butter just right, it goes from browned to burned in seconds if you're not careful. In tonight's tart I am using the raspberries and vanilla extract like the original recipe. I can't wait to try it. This is definitely my easy "go to" tart recipe.

I loved this - not too sweet, easy to make, flavorful. My father in law ate his slice, a second slice, and part of his son's when he failed to arrive at the table for dessert on time. : ) A hit!

Such a great & easy recipe. I made two of these in two days - perfect timing with the raspberry crop in season.

Fantastic! I made this recipe exactly as written (although I added more raspberries, cause I like them), and it was great!

Made this to take to a friend's house and it was so simple. The only ingredient I had to buy was raspberries. I baked the crust for only 12 minutes the first time. This was a delicious dessert that was not too sweet and I think it could even pass for a special breakfast treat. Will absolutely make again!

I made this today exactly as written. It is excellent! I would never have thought to put raspberries in a browned butter filling, but it works! The crust is crisp, sweet and buttery and so easy to work with. The browned butter filling was soft, smooth and rich; a nice foil for the raspberries. It reminded me of a clafoutis. It was easy to make too. I will definately make this again.

Not a favorite at my house. Perhaps I should have reduced the cooking time on the crust as others did. I found it too bland. But it is easy.

Excellent Tart. A really beautiful dessert for those, like me, who like something subtly sweet with a hint of tart. The brown butter flavor compliments the raspberries wonderfully. Also, the easiest tart or pie recipe I've ever used.

mmmm! Delicious! Will definitely make this one again.

This tart is by far the best raspberry tart I've ever made (and I've tried a lot). The brown butter infuses such a deep, nutty flavor that blends exceptionally well with the slightly tart berries. I will make this over and over.

This was very easy. I used fresh sour cherries instead of raspberries and was pleased with the results. My crust was tender...I decreased the initial baking time as well....

I've made this twice already, but not with raspberries. I first made it with cherries. I added a little almond extract to the filling and it was divine. The second time I made it with apricots and strawberries. I've found that I need at least 1.5 times the dough called for and in my oven the crust needs to bake for only 12-15 minutes. I'm making it again tomorrow!

This is a delicious and easy recipe to make. I thought the crust was too crisp by the time I had baked it and then filled it and baked it again, so I cut back on the initial baking time. Worked beautifully.

For years, I have visited a small bakery in the city to acquire a little slice of deliciousness like this. Now I don't have to. And this is so easy! I damn near ate the entire thing myself.

Ok, I just gave this 2.5 stars but find myself nibbling at the leftovers without any problem. (Crust is nice and crunchy.) And my daughter cut a piece for breakfast and thought it was "amazing." So I'm upping the forks and adding it to my recipe box.

Actually, I'd give this 2.5 -- good but not great. Certainly easy, looks good and my guests liked it. But . . . it's not quite there.

YUM YUM YUM. Very easy to make. The browing the butter is the key. Didn't have a tart pan so I used a cheesecake pan. Wonderful. Will definetly make again. A mixture of berries would also be great to.

originally, i was skeptical of how the browned butter would perhaps weigh down the berries. i was absolutely wrong, and this dessert was a knockout. i swapped blackberries for the raspberries and soaked them in cointreau for 2hrs. also, it didn't resemble the photo, but it was by far one of the best summer desserts i've had in a very long time. will definitely be making this again!

Made this yesterday for a group of 8 and it was a big hit. Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I will say that I had to make two crusts because the first one burned after 15 minutes in the oven. It may be my oven, but I recommend checking on the tart crust at 10 minutes and every minute or two thereafter.

This was pretty good. I didn't get as much of the nutty browned-butter flavor in the end, and my outer crust burned before the filling was done. But we still ate the whole thing!
