This is an amazing dessert and not difficult to make either. I made it for our friends tonight and they were impressed. We are big L' Auberge Chez Francois fans and this chocolate souffle is very comparable to what is served there. Without a doubt, I will be making this again!

These were really great - very chocolate-y but not too sweet. Served with burnt caramel ice cream.

WOW! These are delicious. I was a little hesitant making them because I had heard horror stories of souffle's, but these were really easy and DELICIOUS! I couldn't find the aluminum tins, so I made them in ramikins. Tasted amazing. Only thing was that they required a little extra time in the oven because I had refrigerated the mix ahead of time. A little too gooey on the first round, but the second round was perfect!

Wonderful dessert for Valentine's Day. Served with strawberries and vanilla ice cream and it was fabulous. Also used disposable pot pie tins (!!!) and they were fine except I think the servings could have been about half as big. I think I would try disposable muffin tins next time.

Oh Wow! When I go out to dinner, that's my favourite dessert! I would call it more of a chocolate eruption cake than a souffle, but it was absolutely DEEEEEEELICIOUS!

Has anyone used muffin tins, which are 3.5 oz, at a shorter baking time? I don't have time to hunt for anything else!

I used aluminum "pot pie pans" that came in a package of 9 for $1.89. The batter ended up only filling 6 of them however, but they still turned out amazing!

I used 8oz mini souffle dishes and served in the dish with a big strawberry on the side. Used Scharffenberger 70% and they were AMAZING.

Question: what did you use for the 6-oz aluminum tins??

OH WOW! This is amazing. I love chocolate - the darker the better - but my husband doesn't care for sweets. I made this for NYE. I did the full recipe and wound up with 8 ramekins and I think he ate 5 of them!!! (Not all that night...) I served it with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Will definitely do this again, probably for company and/or special nights.
