Absolutely fabulous taste. I make this all the time, and never get tired of it. I usually don't bother with the toasted rice powder, nor do I separate out the cucumbers from the noodles and herbs  I tend to just toss them all together, and slice the steak on top. I'll sometimes add shredded carrot. If you want to make sure your steak is at all browned/charred on the outside, scrape off the marinade: otherwise, you'll get nicely toasted lemongrass-garlic crumbs, and an unseared steak.

loved it! I made carrot ribbons with a specialty peeler and then pickled them in rice wine vinegar and sugar. I couldn't find rice powder so I just skipped it. Tasted great anyway. Definitely a keeper. It tasted better than the dish at my favorite Vietnamese restaurant.

This recipe deserves the hype. It is very variable so you can really make it your own, and it is very easy and delicious. I used the Nuac Cham recipe suggested in the reviews (it doesn't say how much carrot to use - I used about 1/2 cup of grated carrot which seemed the right proportion). I couldn't find lemongrass so I used the zest of one large lemon and a roughly equal quantity of ginger. I planned to use peanuts instead of rice powder as others had suggested but forgot to buy them - I didn't miss anything. This is definitely going in the rotation.

I have made this several times and finally got it to 4 forks. Lightly score the meat and add 1-2 tablespoons lime juice to the marinade. This will help to penetrate and tenderize the meat. It can then be left at room temperature an hour or two to hasten the marinating time. For the nuoc cham, omit or reduce the water and add some Asian Chili Garlic Paste instead of, or in addition to the Thai peppers. This adds more depth of flavor and the end result is a it a delicious and a very attractivre presentation with the cucumber garnish.

I basically echo emilylyn's comments. Wonderful recipe, refreshing, and added shredded carrots, bean sprouts and peanuts. Gets even better Day 2. If you make your own nuoc cham, don't double the chilies in the recipe. I used 5 thai green chilies for the whole thing and it was plenty!

This is a great recipe. The marinade is equally good on chicken and pork. I add a little grated ginger and rice vinegar or lime juice to the marinade as well.

After moving from Minneapolis (where there's lots of fantastic Vietnamese restaurants) to Cincinnati (where there are not), I was craving bun salad. This recipe tastes almost exactly like the ones I remember. It's a perfect dish for a hot day, nice and refreshing. The balance of flavors is just perfect. Love love love this dish. I add shredded carrots and bean sprouts when I make it. Other proteins are equally good. I also add a sprinkle of ground peanuts.

I wish I'd read about the peanut suggestion as I thought the rice powder was a bit pointless. I've lived in South East Asia for 15 years and I love South East Asian flavours....there was something about this though that didn't hit the note with me. I thought the beef was slightly saccharin and had a weird texture as a result - I would leave out the sugar in the marinade next time and leave the sweetness to the Nuoc Cham.

Marinade for steak is perfecto. Marinated overnight- yum! I made the lime sauce rec. by another reviewer and was a bit disappointed - a bit fishy/watery for me, and I do indeed like fish sauce. I think I will try a version of a thai pad thai sauce I have had before that is more unctous. Served beef with herbs with lettuce wraps and dressing on the side.

Absolutely fabulous! Used another reviewers recipe for N.M. and highly recommend it : "It yields 2+ cups but will keep refrigerated for up to a month. Start with 1-1/3c. of hot water, add 1/2c. sugar and stir or shake to dissolve. Add 1/2c. fish sauce, 4 minced cloves of garlic, 2t. asian garlic chili sauce, 4T. of lime juice, and julienned carrot. I use a screw top jar to make the sauce in that I can also store in the fridge."

Fantastic. I've made this twice so far and my husband just loves it. Very flavorful. I used the nuoc cham recipe from a previous post and marinated the cucumbers in a little of it for a few hours before serving. The second time I made it I used a top round steak and it was really great, too.I sprinkle chopped peanuts on top, as well.

Fantastic! House smelled amazing while meat was broiling. Restaurant quality. Follow recipe for homemade nuoc cham in the comment from the cook in Aptos, CA -- it's GREAT.

Amazing flavors! I picked this recipe from several similar ones on Epicurious and am so glad I did. This is a perfect summer entertaining dish. I served it to 12 guests who all raved about it. The only changes I made were omitting the rice powder (it sounded like it would be grainy) and I used thicker pad thai-style rice noodles instead of vermicelli. I will make this again and again.

Correction, the nuoc cham recipe is from a previous post - A Cook from Aptos, CA. I also loosely chopped up the herbs.

This was fabulous. I missed this salad!! I used to eat at this Vietnamese/French restaurant all the time and then I moved to a remote part of Mexico. The marinade is perfect. I added mung bean sprouts and chopped red bell pepper to the salad. I also couldn't find rice noodles so I substituted with bean thread noodles. I also used chopped peanuts instead of the rice powder. After the so-so reviews on the Nuoc Cham, I found a great recipe: 1c hot water + 1/2c sugar till dissolved. Then mix in 1/2c fish sauce, 4 minced garlic cloves, 2t of garlic chili sauce, 4T lime juice and added thin carrot pieces. The bomb!

I've been searching for this recipe for years after I lost the original magazine. It is my daughter's FAVORITE recipe and truly a loss while it was missing. I often make it without the noodles. When I'm unable to obtain lemongrass, I usually combine all of the herbs into the marinade. It is out of this world succulent & flavorful! Thanks for posting this treasure on-line for us to "rediscover"!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! The only change I made was to use peanuts instead of rice powder as recommended by others. The flavor is delicious, interesting, complex and very authentic. I got rave reviews from someone who generally is less than enthusistic with my experiments with Asian cooking. He's asked that this be put on the favored list and it is!

excellent! made with pork instead of beef because that's what I'm used to at traditional Vietnamese restaurants. also used chopped peanuts instead of rice powder. Also made the nuoc cham recipe from A Cook from Aptos, CA and it was delish! Better than 99% of the Vietnamese restaurants I've ordered this in.

Regarding the comment of one of the review, to get rid of the sandy quality of the noodles; next time for leftover, keep the noodles apart from the rest. Heat the noodles in the microwave for about 45 seconds to one minute w/ a small amount of water (one to two table spoons, depending) the noodles should soften up. Good luck!

Wonderful - especially with all the herbs & peppers fresh from the garden. We did chop up the herbs and decided that was a good idea, and used flank steak which was fine.

Rating: 4
This was very different than the things that I normally make and everyone loved it. The only (slight) change that I might consider next time might be to cut the herbs (not chop) into smaller pieces (this was a recommendation of everyone at the table). Highly recommend this and not to be scared of the fish sauce - it gives the dish an exotic taste that didn't chase the kids away.

This was really good, light, refreshing. The marinade for the flank steak was so easy and good! I grilled it a little under medium rare and it was a huge hit. Melt in your mouth. I made the dipping sauce that another reviewer said his Vietnamese girlfriend gave him the recipe . . . it was fantastic! Definitely a good nuoc cham! Only one complaint with the salad recipe--we didn't finish the salad the night we ate it, so we had it for leftovers the next night and the toasted rice powder on the noodles didn't taste right the next night. There was a "sandy" quality to the noodles. I'll just remember that for next time and adjust the amount so that there aren't leftovers.

Enjoyed everything about this recipe. The few changes that I will make for the next time would be to smash, then thinly slice the lemongrass rather then grinding it. Didn't care much for the texture of it after having been grilled. Also will either try to find a less salty fish sauce, or use low sodium soy sauce. Would also be great for boneless chicken. I also included raw bean sprouts, red leaf lettuce, and a sprinkling of chopped peanuts on top. Used a recipe given to me by my Vietnamese girlfriend for nuoc cham that is the best recipe I've come across so far. It yields 2+ cups but will keep refrigerated for up to a month. Start with 1-1/3c. of hot water, add 1/2c. sugar and stir or shake to dissolve. Add 1/2c. fish sauce, 4 minced cloves of garlic, 2t. asian garlic chili sauce, 4T. of lime juice, and julienned carrot. I use a screw top jar to make the sauce in that I can also store in the fridge.

just as good as similar plates i have had at restaurants. i used sirloin and topped everything off with plenty of chile sauce. delish and very easy. will definetly move this into the asian-dish rotation.

Very good. I marinaded the flank/skirt steak for 4 hours-I wish it could've been longer. I also followed the adivce of others w/ the Nuoc Cham & did not add water, rather I used extra lime juice & garlic (next time I'll try using less sugar as well). I also omitted the mint-I don't think it is necessary because the basil/cilanto gives a nice flavor. I served a Miso soup with this dish.

Excellent recipe - followed it exactly and would definately make it again.

Phenomenal. Accidentally overcooked the vermicelli so I used soba noodles instead. Added carrots and scallions. Next time I'll boil the left over marinade and toss with the noodles--the marinade was the best part of the recipe.

Good stuff! Like many of the other reviewers, I agree that the dressing does better with less water, less sugar, and more pepper. I also took the advice of adding lime to the marinade, which worked quite well. Finally, as I didn't have an Asian grocery handy to get thai basil, I served it on a bed of mixed lettuces, a little julienned carrot and red bell pepper, bean sprouts, and cilantro. Great!

Actually only did the marinade, but husband and I both thought it delish! Will definitely make again, and maybe even get around to trying the rest of the recipe!

This dish turned out very well. I took the advice of other reviewers: I omitted the mint leaves, made extra sauce, and toasted the rice with peanuts before grinding. I'll definitely make this again.

So far, I had not found any Vietnamese recipe to be correct. Grilled lemongrass beef does not eat with noodle or nuoc mam cham. The beef dish that eat with noodle does not grill. The person/chef is confusing between the 2 dish.

The beef was incredibly tasty, though we found the toasted rice powder kind of grainy. My husband suggested substituting chopped peanuts. The sauce was just the right blend of sweet, salty, sour and spicy.

The flank steak tasted great on its own. I added a little lime juice to the marinade to speed up the tenderizing process. I would use this marinade again for a steak by itself. The salad tasted rather bland: lots of herbs but too little dressing (nuoc cham sauce) for the amount of noodles. Half the noodles would be enough, or I'd increase the amount of dressing. (See my review of the nuoc cham sauce). Overall I expected something a little spicier.

this was a terrific recipe. it had three elements that work for me. 1) ease of preparation 2) tasty ingredients 3) interested diners. we will definitely make this dish again

Was so happy to find the recipe for the marinade and Nuoc Cham. Had been looking for it. We've eaten this grilled beef with rice, nuoc cham and the assorted herbs, cucumber on the side many times in Vietnamese restaurants. Was never able to find how to make it. Made it last night, it was deliscious.

Tastes almost as good as when I had this dish in Viet Nam.

A terrific recipe for a hot day - it's now summer here in Australia. The recipe for Nuoc Cham tastes very authenic. If you like the flavours of Vietnamese cooking you will love this.
