In my search to find the perfect crisp, slightly acidic, fresh accompaniment to my lobster pasta with truffled-mushroom cream sauce, I encountered this recipe. Overall, it was good. The fennel was delicious and offset the tangerines perfectly. I used a 50/50 baby spinach and microgreens mix and it was lovely. My only complaint was that the dressing was just "blah" for lack of a more eloquent term. I am not TOO experienced in salads, but if I were, I would have tried to doctor the dressing with something that would give it a little more flavor. Suggestions welcomed!!

Delicious salad! I love citrusy dressings and the combination with slices of tangerine (clementine in my last one) and fennel were simple and prefect. I served this at a friends birthday party and everyone loved it! I am making this for our Thanksgiving salad this year too!

I loved the flavor combinations in this salad. I have a very basic question -- having never cooked with fennel before, when it says "fronds chopped", does that mean that the fronds should be removed and discarded, or chopped and added to the salad? Thanks for the clarification!

This salad was OK.

My family and friends LOVED this salad. The ingredients balanced well. We skipped cutting the tangerines and instead used clementine slices (just peel and section) because they have no seeds and were already bite-sized.

Perfect for a hot day! Tangerines were not available so I subbed seedless Clementines. We loved it!

Very good salad. I used oranges and added avacado and slivered almonds as well. I doubled the dressing ingredients and added 1t grated orange zest, about 2T of orange juice and 1T honey. Served with grilled salmon and wild rice.

I agree that this is a nice salad. I used less than the recommended amount of fennel just because it was looking like a lot, but who knows what passes for "Medium" in the test kitchens! I didn't use all the tangerines either but would next time.

This salad was easy and delicious. I substituted almond oil for the olive oil and minneolas for the tangerines. Also, I sprinkled with sliced almonds. The tastes worked very well together.

This is an easy, fresh salad with a nice flavor. Make sure you use all the fennel

I was pleasantly surprised and really loved this salad. I did however alter it quite a bit. I used 4 tablespoons of shallots (we love shallots) and 1 teaspooon grated clementine. I also used one drained can of mandarin oranges (peeling and segmenting is way too much work). I also very finely grated one (1) medium fennel bulb. I can agree that two (2) would be too many. I also forgot to salt and pepper the dreassing, but I did kosher salt and pepper the salad itself. It waa wonderful. My kids came back for second helpings. I've made it twice and recommended it to several people that have really enjoyed it.

I really enjoyed this salad. It took me a little while to cut the supremes or tangerine segments but overall the dish was good.

This was very enjoyable and a nice way to ease into salads for the warmer seasons. The tangerines really made this work for me, and I liked the very mild fennel bulb.

I rated this 2 forks, because as is, it is unbalanced in flavor. If I make this again, I will use ONE fennel bulb and naval oranges instead of tangerines. Two fennel bulbs were way too over-powering, and I didn't use all of that amount. Tangerine sections are small and usually come with many seeds. So, when you cut free of segments and seeds, you end up with small very fragile pieces. I will try the recipe again, with one fennel bulb and naval oranges instead of the tangerines.

We eat a lot of salads so I'm always on the lookout for a new combination. This was definitely a winner. Easy to do and pleased my husband who is not that big a fan of fennel. I think the combination of fennel and tangerine works well. This is a nice crunchy and fresh tasting salad.

A nice and quick little salad. I added toasted walnuts for a bit of crunch, which worked well. My only advice is don't skimp on the fennel. I did, thinking that I didn't want it to overpower the flavors, but I regretted it. The fennel mixes in well with the fragrant greens & citrus. Next time I'll follow the recipe as is.

Quick and refreshing. A nice change, especially with all the clementines on sale now.
