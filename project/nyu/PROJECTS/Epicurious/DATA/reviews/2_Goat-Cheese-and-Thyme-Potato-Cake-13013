I make this often for friends and family, and it is always a hit. I do add Salt & Pepper.

Well, I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this. It was very dull, as others have indicated. I was surprised that the recipe didn't call for salt and pepper (I figured the cheese was the salt substitute). I think that S&P would have helped a lot. But, what I didn't like was the texture--the eggs gave this a souffle/fritatta quality that was odd because I was expecting more of a gratin. I won't make it again.

My oven doesn't heat up to 3750 degrees. I think the author of this recipe should proofread.

This was OK but not great. I almost doubled the goat cheese and still found it lacking in cheese flavour. Very bland.

I've made this several times as a side dish with different entrees and I've had many compliments on it. My husband particularly likes it AND it's easy to make, especially for company, because it can be made ahead of time.

This was awful and I was completely embarassed to serve my family and friends this dish at Easter. It may be easy but it looked terrible and didn't taste much better. I followed the recipe exactly and will never make it again.

This was an excellent side dish with herb crusted boneless leg of lamb. I will in the future use less egg and add a bit of cream cheese to improve the texture. A creamy texture would improve this dish.

It was not only easy -- but delicious!
