I made the sauce separately. It saved the meal as no-one liked the sauce but we still had nice plain fish.

Very good way to make steamed fish with a Chinese flavor. I especially like that it steams in the oven, so you don't have to worry about a)getting a big enough steamer for a whole fish, or b)watching the steamer on the stovetop the whole time. The flavors of the vegetables/black bean sauce was great, although they dried out too much in the oven. I would add some broth to the pan before putting it in the oven next time.

Very moist and tasty. Bumped up the spices a bit.

This dish was very tasty. Although we covered the dish tightly with foil, the liquid evaporated and we had to re-make the sauce on the stove. The black beans were a little difficult to find. They are sometimes sold under the name Salted Black Beans rather than fermented. Other than dealing with fish bones, fins and face the overall experience was positive.
