Not to guild the lilly, but I tend to sprinkle the chicken with a bit of sage and cover the top side of the chicken slice with a thin slice of prosciutto. Yes it makes it even richer. Oh darn

This was spectacular! I took others' advice and added mushrooms and shallots to the sauce. I used a merlot wine instead of marsala.

This was wonderful. I made it gluten free and dairy free by substituting the butter with olive oil and used chick pea flour instead of wheat flour. Excellent!

Excellent dish! I added mushrooms and shallots, as suggested by another reviewer and I'm glad I did. A word of caution: the recipe calls for low sodium chicken broth and I used regular chicken broth, which I had on hand. This made the dish a little too salty, so I'll definitely make it with the low sodium broth in the future. A great dish - will become a part of our regular rotation!

I made this exact recipe but with only 2 chicken breasts. I still halved them, but I felt the end solution needed more sauce goodness. Next time (oh yes there will be a next time) I am going to double the sauce. Very tasty.

Rating: 4
Excellent and so easy. After browning the chicken (did not cut the chicken breast in half) in butter with the sage, removed chicken and browned mushrooms and shallots. Removed mushrooms and shallots and deglazed pan with the marsala wine and broth and cooked until reduced by 1/4. Added back the chicken, mushrooms and shallots, covered and cooked/steamed chicken. Perfect!

My family loved this. My wife and 10 year-old raved. My 5 year-old was not thrilled by the sauce, but ate it anyway. I had had a surplus of sage and thawed chicken, but no marsala. I made do with a concoction of .5 cup dry white wine, .5 cup white grape juice, and 4 tsp brandy. It was great, but I bet a good marsala wine would have taken it up a few notches. I always pound the chicken down with a rolling pin to .5 inch or less before dredging for a more tender bite.

This is a good, simple recipe. Turned out well, even though I used the wrong Marsala (too sweet). Next time, I will use dry Marsala. I also added sliced mushrooms.

This was a good recipe but changed a couple of things. Instead of all purpose flour I used garlic seasoned bread crumbs and added sliced mushrooms to the sauce. Fantastic!! I make it every week

Check! This recipe is officially yummy. Added the mushrooms and shallots, doubled the sauce, and thickened it up a bit at the end with cornstarch and water. I don't need to say anymore. I will definitely be adding this to the regular dinner-in-a-hurry rotation.

I made this dish for girls night and everyone loved it. The only change I mad was I cooked the chicken, mushrooms & sauce in the same pan. I didn't see the need for 2 fry pans. I agree with everyone that if you want sauce for pasta or rice you need to AT LEAST double it. It is so delicious the next day you won't be sorry you have leftover sauce. Easy and delicious

I made this with the addition of pancetta, shallots and mushrooms and it was delicious. The sauce was definitely the best and I will likely double it next time as I reduced it a lot and wasn't left with as much as I would have liked.

This was more delicious than I was expecting! I did not have Marsala so I substituted dry vermouth and it was still wonderful. I also finished the sauce with a few small pats of butter for a little extra richness. A great way to use up garden fresh sage! Served it with Arugula Salad with Garlic Vinaigrette and some roasted potatoes. Yum- will be making again.

Easy weeknight dinner. I added onions (shallots would have been better but I didn't have them). Served with pasta. Definitely one to do again.

Very very good. Easy. Sauteed onions, a little garlic, mushrooms and pancetta first. Added to sauce at the end. Will definitely make again.

Followed reco and added diced onions and sliced mushrooms. This has made the rotation of solid go-to recipes. I also like to cut the chicken more as slices versus halves since it's easier for the chicken to soak in the sauce flavor.

Rating: 3
I added shallots and slice mushrooms. As usual I cubed the chicken which means I probably had more flour, which is good as I liked the thickness of the sauce. My fresh sage was very mild. I used about 1/3 cup and added more at the end, but it probably varies.

This has a great flavor! I added portabellos to the marsala sauce and it was fantastic! I say bring on the sage, you could definitely saute' another tablespoon or more!

This was great, fast and easy. I also added cremini mushrooms. I added them with the sage. It was a great addition. I also pounded the chicken with a meat mallet so it would cook more evenly and definitely recommend that. It was really tasty, my husband loved it, too.

Rating: 3
Taking my cue from other reviewers, I added mushrooms, baby bellas and reconstituted porcinis. Although I cooked 2 large breast halves, I made the full amount of sauce. I reduced the sauce so much it needed no thickening. I used 3/4 cup of chicken broth to which I added 1/4 cup of the porcini soaking water. This dish turned out very well, but I think next time I'll skip the mushrooms, add a shallot, and a little more fresh sage which flavor got lost in my version. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed carrots dressed with balsamic vinegar and capers. There's a small portion of chicken left for my solo dinner tonight, and I'm glad of it!

Rating: 3
A great dish overall! Easy, tasty, inexpensive and quick- what more do you need? I had some trouble getting the sauce to my desired thickness, so I added some heavy cream (borrowed the idea from other Chicken Marsala recipes) and it was excellent.

I made this for dinner as well, just my husband and I and it was simple and delicious! I added mushrooms as well just to use them up and we both enjoyed...

Three forks as is, four forks with changes: lots of mushrooms (brown, shiitake, portabello), shallots, garlic, and more sauce. I also pounded the chicken first and served over Polenta Corn Cakes (with Parmesean, not blue cheese).

Delicious recipe. Quick & easy too. But also very rich. Like others, I made a couple of changes...added diced plum tomatoes, artichokes & capers to the marsala sauce. Also thickened it with a tsp of flour. But I would definitely make this again & again. Yummy.

I used sweet marsala and it needed a little more bite, but it is definitely a keeper. Next time I may try artichoke hearts insted of mushrooms as an added ingredient.

I followed the recipe as written, but then took other reviewer's advice and added a little flour to the sauce. I liked this dish, but didn't love it. The sage flavor was a little strong for me and I couldn't taste the wine. However, my husband really enjoyed it. I think next time I will try it with a shallot added and maybe more marsala wine than the recipe called for.

Rating: 3
Like others I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms, in this case crimini, and the result was delicious. Also pounded the cutlets as necessary with a wide mallet to ensure uniform thickness. The use of imported dry marsala is essential. Serve with salad, baby broccoli and pasta in garlic olive oil for a great authentic meal.

I'm not sure what I did wrong! I doubled the sauce, added mushrooms and shallots as the previous reviews said but it came out too wine tasting. I also added flour to thicken. I will try it again as the reviews were so great the problem must have been with me. Does anybody have advice?

Made this last night. Followed recipe to the T, but took the suggestion of a previous reviewer to add mushrooms. Then put the chicken back in the sauce to reheat. Picky husband and 6 year old loved it.

I found this when looking for ways to use some extra fresh sage. Like other reviewers, I added mushrooms and placed the browned chicken back into the skillet at the end to bring it back to temperature. This tastes just like the chicken marsala at our favorite Italian restaurant. I never have used this much marsala in chicken marsala before but it is just right once the sauce has boiled down. A definite keeper as it is delicious and fast.

I tried this recipe simply because the simplicity of the ingredients sounded divine. I am glad I did! I followed the recipe exactly until the end, when I thickened the sauce slightly with a mixture of cornstarch and water. I served this with a simple green salad and crusty bread ~ it was just wonderful ~ definitely a keeper!

I made it as close to written as I could. I did not have fresh sage though I can only image the flavor it would have added. I too undercooked the chicken and added at the end.

This was delicious. I agree with doubling the sauce and adding more sage. I added fresh shitake mushrooms. Very easy. Very good.

Calgary, you probably picked up a bottle of sweet Marsala rather than dry, although this recipe doesn't specify which one to use. My preference is to use 1/2 and 1/2, but if sweet is all you have, I would suggest adding a touch more salt to the dish. AS for my review... I don't think there was enough sage; couldn't taste it enough. Next time I'll add more.

Rating: 2
Hmmm... I found the flavour of this dish very strange... almost... vanilla-ish. Can anyone fill me in on whether Marsala is SUPPOSED to have that sweet a flavor? Or did I end up with a bad bottle? This was my first time using so I am not sure. Overall the dish was okay but not terrific.

Best recipe I've taken from this website. After having tried numerous marsala recipes, I must say that this one was the best and the easiest. The only thing I did differently was double the sauce and add sauteed mushrooms.

I made this to rave reviews last night. First of all I doubled the sauce as others have suggested. I undercooked the chicken and added it to the sauce to finish off and also sauteed some crimini mushrooms with shallots that I added to the sauce at the end along with a bit of heavy cream. This is definitely a keeper!! I served it with some angel hair pasta tossed with butter and Parmesan and a green salad. Alot of bang for very little effort. I can't wait to make it again and hopefully have some leftovers.

Probably the simplest Chicken Marsala I have ever made but the best tasting. The quality of Marsala makes a huge difference so do not skip out. I took the suggestions of adding mushrooms to this dish. Wonderful.

This was easy, excellent and my guests loved it. As another poster suggested, I added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce, I also added another teaspon or two of sage to the butter before cooking the 2nd batch of chicken. I served with garlic roasted mashed potates and broccoli spears. Will definitely make again.

Whoa. Really good recipe. I sauted sliced mushrooms in separate pan in butter and a splash of basalmic vinegar and added to sauce right before serving. A chef once taught me that when you saute mushrooms, do not move them around until they are browned on one side. Moving them around or stirring while cooking will cause them to be mushy. It's true! I get the most earthy taste when I saute ordinary mushrooms that way. I served this dish over garlic mashed potatoes...can't imagine it with rice or noodles. This really is easy and fast! Perfect for last minute guests.

I used regular broth, big mistake! It was way to salty. But I know if I had the low sodium chicken broth it would be great! I probably would omit the salt altogether. I did add some mushrooms also and used dried sage.

My wife thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I did modify it by adding some rehydrated dried porcinis as I was making the sauce. Also, instead of the 1 cup of chicken broth, I used 1 cup of the strained water from the porcinis and a teaspoon of Better than Bouillon.

I made this recipe twice. Once with 1/2 cup Marsala and once with the entire cup. I found that the full cup was more flavorful and still not too sweet. I made sure that I used dry Marsala.

I LOVED this recipe! Excellent sauce! I did cut back on the Marsala wine. Only used around 1/2 cup since I didn't want the sauce too sweet. I also sauted the sage with a finely chopped shallot. The shallot gave the sauce some texture. The recipe is extremely easy which makes it a great weekday meal but elegant enough for company! I also served it with garlic mashed potatoes with fresh sage leaves as a garnish! I can't wait to make it again!

A good start, this recipe, and one which I recommended to a friend who's a novice cook - but with the advice that it absolutely needs the addition of mushrooms and shallots to achieve the four-star status so lavishly bestowed here.

I never thought I'd like a Chicken Marsala recipe as much as my family and I love the Chicken and Mushroom Marsala recipe on this same site, but this looked worth a try since I had everything on hand. It was absolutely delicious. I, too, returned the chicken to the pan to finish cooking...it was so tender and lovely. Served it with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes and sliced carrots sauteed in butter. Great.

I've made this recipe several times-once as a "gift" meal for a friend's birthday. The recipe has never failed me, and it's prejudiced me against most restaurant versions. Delicious with garlic mashed potatoes. I've also served it with a FANTASTIC Roasted Garlic Risotto with Wild Mushrooms (Stonewall Kitchen www.stonewallkitchen.com) and grilled asparagus. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

OMG, this was DELICIOUS! The chicken was so tender and juicy, and the sauce was to die for. I'd definitely double the amount, though. I used sweet Marsala and am so glad I did - the balance of flavors was perfect. Like other reviewers, I added the chicken back to the pan (I slightly undercooked the chicken so it wouldn't become tough and dry). Served on whole wheat egg noodles w/ butter, sage and parmesan, w/ a side of creamed spinach and stuffed mushrooms. Quick, easy, and incredibly tasty. Good enough for a weekend meal, simple enough for a weekday night.

Delicious! I followed previous viewers' advice of putting chicken back into the sauce to cook at the end. This recipe can easily be made with another herb of choice if you do not have any sage; I made it with rosemary the second time, and it was still fabulous. I served it over a bed of egg noodles. Double the sauce, you'll be glad you did!

I make this all the time, it is very quick and easy. I also put the chicken back in the pan for a while, and I sautee some shallots before cooking the chicken (and add those back to the mix as well). Great with mashed potatoes - you can use them to sop up the delicious sauce!

Very easy and quick to make. It's a good dish, and nice for a simple weekday meal. Make sure you cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise -- it needs a thin cut (I forgot and the breasts were too thick). You might even consider just using small breast tenderloins. You should double (or even triple) the sauce as well. Would recommend grating a bit of Parmesano Reggiano prior to serving.
