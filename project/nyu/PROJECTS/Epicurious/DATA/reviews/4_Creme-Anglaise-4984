This recipe is fabulous. I followed the instructions and it worked perfectly. It was divine with mixed berries - I put a splash of Grand Marnier on the berries before drizzling with Creme. I also made sure berries and Creme were at room temp. Mine was a touch sweet - but my fault I think for using heaped tablespoons of sugar. Yum Yum will definitely do again.

This recipe is perfect. I tripled it when I made it for a dinner party where I served it with mixed berries and Sara Lee pound cake and it got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I followed the tip to keep whisking continuously until it reached the desired thickness and it worked flawlessly!

This is a delicious, classic creme anglaise. With only 5 minutes cooking time, this will remain a sauce. For a consistency closer to a pastry cream for filling an eclair, doubling the cooking time thickens it up. The ingredient proportions are perfect.

Perfect every time. I drizzle this creme anglaise on a mixed berry compote crepe I prepare at my booth at a local farmers market. Everyone loves it. :)

I usually double this recipe if I'm making it to go with a 9" chocolate torte or with a full loaf of banana bread (it's like DIY banana bread pudding). I also do it over a double boiler for more control (also, so it doesn't get overcooked, never had lumps).

So easy and simple! Tastes absolutely delicious over berries!

Mine turned out a little too vanilla-y, but once it was served with strawberries and lightly sweetened cream, the vanilla wasn't so overpowering. Which, by the way, is a great way to serve this sauce--under a bed of quartered strawberries with lightly sweetened whipped cream on top. It's simple and delicious. Adding Grand Mariner is a good idea; maybe I'll try it next time.

This is the standard Crème Anglaise, simple and perfect every time IF you pay attention and whisk constantly. You cannot leave this unattended. Any minor lumps will be strained out at the end. This should not be very thick, the consistency is about like heavy cream. Delicious with bread pudding.

Great recipe - I served this with Orange Glow Chiffon Cake for a friend's wedding. The first batch got lumpy as I was less careful - I paid more attention and got great results the second time around! Very smooth, nice flavor.

This took 2 efforts for me. The first time it was "lumpy". The second time I followed one reviewer's suggestion and put in 1/4 2% milk and 1/4 half and half (I didn't have whole milk). Also, I strained the custard before I added to the egg and sugar mixture. My efforts were rewarded the second time. It is delicious. I'm wondering if anyone has added Grand Marnier or something similiar to give it a flavor.

This is a really nice crème anglaise. I used it as a sauce for a strawberry bavarois at New-Year's Eve and the sauce boat was emptied in no time! I will keep this one in the Best of Classics folder...

Excellent! I've made twice now and love this one. Try serving it over warm chocolate bread pudding...a fave in our house!

Excellent and easy to make. Great flavor. Takes longer than 5 minutes to thicken (approx. 10 minutes) but worth the time.

Excellent flavor and texture. I stirred in a teaspoon of vanilla extract at the end instead of using vanilla beans.

I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of this wonderful tasting sauce. Especially good drizzled over fresh berries. My three year old now asks for it by name!
