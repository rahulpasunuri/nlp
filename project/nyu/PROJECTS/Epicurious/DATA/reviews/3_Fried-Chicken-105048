I grew up near Savannah and have cooked Southern Fried Chicken for almost 50 years.No good cook uses evaporated milk and for fried chicken, only buttermilk will do. This recipe is not well-seasoned and the actual frying instructions are too vague for new cooks.

This chicken was so plain and wrong that there should be a law suit against the recipe. Make sure when fry chicken there is garlic, buttermilk and tobasco sauce around ya hear. Too plain, not impressed!

I found about 20 different fried chicken recipes to consider for my son's birthday dinner. He just wanted fried chicken he said. When I showed him the potential recipes he chose this one. It was just plain fried chicken, but it was excellent. My only problem was that there was no aprox. time for the chicken to be done so I fussed over it constantly wondering if it was cooked all the way through.That was my fault for not having experience with frying chicken, it just would have helped a bit. By the way my son just turned 16 and I cooked the Milk and White Choc. Mousse Cake (used just the mousse)and for the actual cake used the recipe for the Inside Out German Choc. Cake recipe and glaze for that cake. As a side I made the Spaghetti Carbonara from this site but modified it using thick bacon, and doubled the sauce recipe. Excellent dinner and dessert. I wanted to make a spicier fried chicken, with more seasonings but my son wanted authentic fried chicken and he got it. I'm happy.
