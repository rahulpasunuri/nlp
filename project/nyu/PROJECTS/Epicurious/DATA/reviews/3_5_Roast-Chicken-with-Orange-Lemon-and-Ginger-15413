The chicken definitely had a nice citrus flavor, but it wasn't as good as other recipes I've made. Liked it, didn't love it.

I made this with a cut-up chicken and used meyer lemons and blood oranges, and it was delicious. I also roasted some (canned) garbanzo beans with the chicken and served it with orzo with lemon and olive oil. Spinach would probably be really good served with it too. For the last 10 minutes of cooking, I raised the oven temp to 425 to crisp the skin. Next time I would probably rub the chicken with a bit of olive oil before cooking to help the skin crisp up.

I substituted a boneless turkey breast and it is wonderful- increase the amount of zest and put on underside of breast- add the citrus segments then fold breasts together creating the cavity and pin closed. Placing this side down on the roasting pan. I also removed the turkey skin and added a little zest to the baste reducing the honey a bit. It is very pretty sliced and great for a larger group

This was great! As long as you salt and pepper it there is no way it could be bland! I forgot the ginger for the baste, so I just used it for the rub...but the lemon & orange sections in the cavity made for my best, most succulent roast chicken ever, and I make a lot of roast chicken! For the baste, I did add a little cayenne pepper for just a bit of heat to go with all the sweet. I made a pan sauce from the drippings, again, a success. This is an awesome recipe! I do have to agree with other reviewers, no 350 degree oven is going to cook a 5 lb. stuffed chicken in an hour. I allowed for two hours of cook time, and it took about 1 hour, 40 minutes.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken thighs, marinated overnight and cooked in the marinade. Was definitely a hit. The meat was nice and moist. Leftovers were even better.

This made for a lovely Christmas dinner, but I took one look at the recipe and knew immediately that it needed two things: lots of butter and garlic. I added a clove of garlic to the zest mix for the cavity, and also put some cloves under the skin after prepping the chicken. I rubbed the outside of the chicken with some added butter to help carry the flavor, and wiped some of the zest mix on the outside of the bird. I used a combination of olive oil and butter for the basting mixture, and the skin browned beautifully. I have to say, though, that the cooking time of 1 hour was totally off- it took about 2.5 hours to cook, and the meat fell off the bones when it was ready. Delicious- the skin had an amazing sweet gingery flavor and the meat (which I just had leftover in a salad) has a lovely, light citrus flavor.

This is a good recipe and one that you can play with to suit your tastes. My husband thought the addition of some sort of herb would help. I am going to work on crisping the skin next time because the skin [ without fat ] with all of the citrus ginger flavor was tasty. My cook time was messed up by the fruit inside [ and trussing ] as well but I will just adapt and find a way to better roast it.

This was a big hit. I'd definitely make it again. The citrus, honey and ginger together worked really well. I cooked it at 200C for about 45 minutes, then 180C for another 15 minutes (then rested for 15m), and served with some roast vegetables and some steamed Brocolli and Bok Choy.

Rating: 2
This was good, but not worth saving because I have so many roast chicken recipes that I think are better. With all that fruit in the cavity, this took a very long time to cook and my dinner's timing was off. All the more reason not to make again!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a lovely, exotic roast. The broth-infused fruit was a delicious garnish! I cooked a 3.5 lb bird at 400 degrees for one hour and ten minutes and it was plenty. I also injected the sauce under the skin for added flavor, and added extra honey to the remainder and glazed the skin twice during cooking. The delicate ginger flavor was delicious. Soaking the chicken in saltwater for an hour gave it enough flavor; my guests enjoyed it thoroughly! I served it with the Spicy Asian-Style Pasta, which was simple but the sauce was yummy, and Wilted Asian Greens (which I am obsessed with). Mmm!

I read previous reviews and decided to use chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken. I also marinated the meat for 6 hours and added prunes and dried apricots for a festive look and added sweetness. The dish turned out well but not exciting. I will try to find a better Orange Chicken recipe.

Looked beautiful, tasted VERY so-so. It was moist but like another cook stated, all the flavor was in the skin. If you want the ULTIMATE roasted chicken recipe, check out the Garlic-Rosemary Roast Chicken recipe offered in the Feb. 04 issue of Cook's Illustrated. A little labor intensive, but TOTALLY worth it. MUCH better than this flightless bird.

For the cook from Washington try a microplane zester once you'll had one you'll never be without. Creates ribbons of zest even on old dry citrus fruit, nice for hard chesses and ginger too.

I actually have a question. I tried to make this today, and had a very difficult time getting orange zest. Lemon zest was easy, but I tried various devices and couldn't get any orange zest. I just got orange mush and gave up. Any tips?

This is a nice change from many chicken recipes - the citrus flavor is wonderful. Very easy to make. Bonus... after dinner I used the leftover chicken and some of the juice to make a great stock for chicken noodle soup.

I modified this receipe w/excellent results. I used cut up chicken and marinated it 2-3 hours. I added to the listed ingredients: the zest and juice of 1 lime and 1 additional lemon, 3 cloves of minced garlic, and 3T of herbes de provence. I roasted in the marinade along with the lemon wedges, basting frequntly. The chicken was beautily glazed and the texture was superb.

I should have listen to the negataive reviewers below. This chicken was indeed tasteless. I followed the recipe exactly but had to roast it 1 1/2 hr and it still wasn't done. The honey basting sauce almost burned the skin and the meat had no flavor. I can usually count a recipe thats 3 forks or better to be pretty good. This one disappoints.

Can't understand why others thought this was bland. Did they forget the salt and pepper? Anyway, this was fragrant, flavorful, and beautiful looking. I followed the recipe exactly as given. Leftovers were delicious too.

Very moist and flavorful with crispy skin. Like other reviewers, I added time (another 45 minutes) to get to 180 degree temperature.

I gave this 3 forks based on some pretty radical modifications I made to it. First since people were saying it was bland - and it looked like it needed a kick, I made a spice rub out of cumin, paprika, coriander, tumeric and olive oil and liberally rubbed the cavity and skin with it. Next, I added lime zest and juice along with the orange and lemon. I injected 1 cup of the liquid under the skin then I put it in a 400 deg oven with 1 cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan for 20 min and then reduced the heat to 350 for 1.5 hrs. The skin was incredible (if you like skin) and the meat was tender and tasty. I served it with couscous topped with a stew of tomatoes, red pepper and garbanzos. It was seasoned with the same spices as the chicken rub and I added some of the zest and juice to the water I cooked the couscous in. It was an excellent combo!

First the good things: it was delicious. Then the bad things: it took 2 hours at 350; so assume that there was a typo somewhere (being positive). Also, unless my 5lb chicken was way smaller than others, the cavity is not big enoug for the orange and the lemon. Of course, stuffing the bird also makes it take loger to cook... Highly recommend (as others have done) deglazing the pan and making a sauce. I just poured some chicken stock to deglaze and reduced it for a bit. Very yummy.

I marinated the chicken all day, but still found the finished dish bland and ordinary. The recipe sounded better than the finished result. I used chicken thighs and breasts, but it was a lot of work with a disappointing finale. Obviously, other cooks have had better results!

I made this dish for my mother's Italian themed birthday party, and my guests all loved it! I don't eat chicken skin, but the entire chicken had the subtle taste of citrus and ginger, not just the skin. (All my guests are skin-eaters.) Absolutely delicious, definitely a keeper!

I marinated the chicken overnight and had a FABULOUS dinner the next day. The citrus and ginger flavors soaked all the way through the meat and could be tasted with every bite. The honey helped the chicken turn golden brown. I served it on a large platter garnished with escarole, arugula, spinach, and blood oranges and served a side of wild mushroom risotto. Excellent entree!

I rated this chicken dish very highly but my rating takes into account my variations. The second time I made this recipe I followed the advice of some other readers and used a cut up chicken ( a very high quality organic chicken). I marinated the chicken parts for about 2 1/2 hours in all of the indredients (I added some chopped parsley for color) and then roasted for the allotted time in the marinade. The result was terrific!

We loved it! Seeing the great drippings from the chicken, we skimmed the fat, strained and then reduced them slightly over high heat... made a wonderful citrus au jus for the chicken!

If you don't eat the skin of the bird, don't make this dish, as that is where all the flavor was. Also I cooked a 4 lb roaster, and it took slightly over 2 hrs. to cook through.

We made this in the rotisserie. This is our main recipe for entertaining, everyone that visits gets the full treat. No matter how many chickens we make, there is nothing left but bones. The skin is fabulous when made in the rotisserie and the fat is all caught in the bottom of the drip pan. Not greasy at all. I also tried in The Pampered Chef deep dish baker/bowl lid. It wasn't as good this way, but I also didn't know that the cooking times weren't accurate.

I did a variation on this as well. My husband and I did a Shabbat dinner for 120 at our annual Symposium on Israel and I looked for recipes using Israeli ingredients - citrus, herbs, honey, etc. I used bags of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs, frozen, marinated them these ingredients, then coated lightly with a seasoned flour/fine crumb mixture. (This elimated all the bones and mess for so many people). The result was delicious. Nice flavor, but not too overpowering. I'll keep this in my "recipes for large groups" file. Along with this we served rosemary roasted potatoes, Israeli pastries, salads and desserts.

I found this chicken to be very moist with an excellent color appeal. I had to bake it an extra 25 to 30 minutes. It is well worth the trouble to prepare.

Since everyone seems to have tweaked this recipe, here is what I did: I used a turkey breast and since there wasn't much of a cavity I put the peel mixture under the skin and let it marinade for a few hours. I also strained the juice and thickened it with a teaspoon of cornstarch and a quarter cup of cream. FYI--I have read several of Ms Goldstein's books and she always underestimates cooking times so I automatically add on at least an extra half hour. One caveat: the honey makes the skin brown very quickly; tenting the skin is advisable.

It had a delicate flavor of citrus and ginger and was very tender.

I made this using a cut up chicken instead of a whole one. It worked out perfectly done that way, which hints that it needs to roast longer when a full chicken is used. Other than that, this was very easy (I keep orange and lemon zest on hand, dried, so it was even easier. I just had to reconstitute them in a little of the appropriate juice...) and very delicious. True, I expected more citrus flavor the first time, but have since learned that if I let it marinate briefly (15 minutes to an hour) in the citrus rub it brings out the flavors much more. All in all, this has become a family favorite.

Although I have not made this yet, i wanted to share a tip re: ginger after reading other reviews. If you love to use fresh grated ginger but hate the effort, just buy a good-sized root, clean all dirt off, cut into smallish pieces (you don't even have to peel if you don't want to) then put into the food processor with some sherry (either chinese or other dry sherry). It will stay fresh for months, and you can easily add by the tsp as needed for recipes. Just add more sherry if it seems to get dry over time, the liquid should just cover to preserve. Make sure that you refrigerate it.

This recipe was a great disappointment to me. After all of the grating, juice squeezing, and basting, the citrus and ginger flavors were barely discernible. Also, the cooking time of 1 hour at 350 degrees is absurd! I cooked my chicken for two hours at 350, and an additional 10 minutes in the microwave; and it was still bloody at the thigh joints!! Definitely not worth all of the effort.

The honey in the recipe produced a beautiful glaze on the bird. I used lime in place of some of the lemon, and this recipe was a keeper.

this was the hit of the holiday season with my dad. Instead of roasting the chicken, I used skinned and pounded chicken breasts (after coating them with the zests and ginger). First I lightly sauteed them in butter then added the sauce and poached them in it. I fixed it twice, and the second time added a little whipping cream to thicken the sauce. Mmmmmmmmmmmm

My wife loved absolutely this dish. I know that I will have to make it again. I thought that maybe there was a little too much honey in the sauce but I did make a very nice gravy with the pan drippings and some cornstarch. It is a good dish to make when you crave something other than the same old chicken dinner.

The time spent to prepare the dish is well dedicated to preparing one's psyche to eating it. The preparation is a ceremony. Lovely. An offering. Bon apetit.

Wonderful recipe but you must cook it longer. to simplify the recipe, I used a zester to get to the peel of the orange and lemon then I chopped it quickly with some fresh parsley than rubbed it in the chicken. Also, I used jarred ginger such as Christopher Ranch and saved oodles of time and the result was excellent!

It does need more time to cook - add about 25 minutes. Set the basting mixture aside - don't pour it on the chicken prior to cooking. The directions are unclear.

THE TIME SPENT IN THE PREPARATION OF THIS DISH IS WELL WORTH WITH IT. IT IS FLAVORFUL AND MOIST. THE SUBTLE TASTE OF THE CITRUS AND GINGER IS OUTSTANDING. CAN'T WAIT TO EAT THE LEFT OVERS. WILL DEFINITELY BE A REPEAT ON MNAY OCCASSIONS.

Yummy and easy to prepare except for grating of ginger, and citrus zests. That took time. I used olive oil, and stuffed bird with grated and juiced quarters of citrus. Used a small "natural" fryer.

Very easy to prepare and truly delicious as well. The flavors of the ginger and citrus really permeate the meat. The only drawback to the recipe is the one hour cooking time given. I found this to be totally inadequate and cooked it an additional hour with frequent basting. Orzo makes a nice accompaniment.
