We love turnips slow cooked with roasted beef and even cooked in a pan with chicken. This was ghastly. Don't bother.

These were really nothing to write home about.

BTW, 6 people wouldn't eat half of what came from only 2 lbs of turnips.

Blech! Very bitter; threw away over half of it after trying to feed it to 6 people. Too much nutmeg? RE: caramelizing the turnips-that doesn't happen when they are covered in the oven.

I've just finished preparing this dish for Thanksgiving tomorrow. It is delicious! You definitely have to cook it longer than 1hr, closer to 2hrs. I didn't so much mash it, as use a knife & fork to cut it into little pieces. I actually like the texture, it will be a nice foil against the garlic mashed potatoes, and the candied sweets. I added some fresh thyme and sauteed shallots, cribbing from other turnip recipes on this site. I found it needs a fair amount of salt, so taste a little as you season. Enjoy!

Terrific! I added slightly less nutmeg than the recipe called for. Everyone enjoyed it, especially my guests who had never tried turnips before.

Tried this dish and 325F at 1 hour is extremely optimistic. Turnips should be blanched first or else they'll get crusty and won't mash properly plus they take too long to finish.

Unexpectedly rich and delicious, thanks to the roasted flavor. Be sure to let turnips caramelize a bit and don't skimp on the butter. Keep a light touch on the nutmeg, make it a mysterious perfume and not a pumpkin pie strong note.
