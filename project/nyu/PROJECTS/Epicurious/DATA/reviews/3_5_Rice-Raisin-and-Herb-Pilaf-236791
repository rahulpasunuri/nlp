I thought it was great, and I make a LOT of different Pilaf recipes. I used wine (in lieu of some of the stock) and left out the mint. Rave reviews from company and family, inclusing one or two "best pilaf yet", which either says something great about the recipe or something really bad about my cooking...

Undecided on do-over. It would have to be for the right main dish since the raisins & onions force the rice toward the sweet side. Was great with Pork Chops w/ Ginger Soy Glaze (this site). Don't add extra liquid, since onions will release. My dish turned out on the soggy side after adding 1/4c more water. Didn't have herbs, but I don't think it made a big difference. NOTE: recipe doesn't instruct to toast pine nuts since the ingredients call for "toasted pine nuts".

Why not saute the pinenuts as well? It's almost always better that way.
