Great way to cook this fish- loved it!! I added ~1T of homemade terriaki sauce to each bundle and vwala~ Served with rice and salad.

This was TERRIBLE. No flavor at all. I used Mahi-Mahi. That and the veggies were good. But all individually...they never melded into one and the flavors didn't compliment one another. The grated lime peel didn't cook enough so it was chewy and the citrus was aberrant with the earthier flavors (not the brigtening flavor I was hoping for). It was just not good. In fact, after a couple of bites, it went in the trash:(. Oh well...at least the fish was on sale. There are MANY better recipes out there...ignore this one!

This was nice but not spectacular. Still, I like using foil as a method of cooking because no fat is necessary, and this was simple enough. Kids thought the ginger and lime were overpowering, but I thought it was a good balance.

Delicious --- I agree that the hardest thing is to julienne carrots, but I simply should have been more patient. I've been looking for a swordfish recipe that kept it moist and flavorful, and this was it.

It did take quite awhile to cut up the carrots. I would use pre-cut, as another reviewer suggested, or mandoline/food processor, if you have it. Also, I got a little frustrated grating the lime zest. So I probably only used a small portion of the lime zest that I was supposed to, but I mixed the juice of one whole lime with the butter. Also, I totally didn't measure anything. I suspect I used more ginger than others. My swordfish was frozen so I had to cook the hell out of the packet. It turned out to be quite delicious, though.

Easy to make but a little dry and lacking of flavour in the end. The swordfish needs some liquid in the foil with it or something to enhance the semi-asian flavours.

My husband and I love this recipe. Quick and tasty! We served this dish at Easter to a member of the family who doesn't eat meat, and it was a hit. Here's a tip: use matchstick carrots rather than slicing them up yourself.

This came out somewhat bland. If I make this again, I'll use a lot more ginger butter, and spike the fish with a little cayenne or paprika before putting it in the oven.

I really enjoyed this. It was easy, healthy and delicious. I'm definitely going to make this again.

This dish met my expectations. I used marlin and added cilantro to the butter mixture. This dish is easy to prepare and delicious. I am sure that I used more that one teaspoon on ginger and lime zest though.

2 forks is a like it don't love it rating but I would definitely make this again. It's a wonderful way to ensure beautifully moist swordfish. Easy and fast but it needs to be tweaked. I doubled the amount of seasoned butter and added EXTRA lime and ginger plus grated two large cloves of garlic into it. Reserved some to top the fish when cooked. Still didn't get the flavor I was looking for and it was a little too buttery. Next time I'll add slivered ginger and snow peas to the veg, drizzle some lime juice in each foil packet and top the fish with a lime slice. Maybe that will boost it to a three forker.

I made this last night and it was fantastic. I did alter the recipe because I didn't have leeks or ginger. I did however have lots of fresh cilantro - so I made the butter with cilantro, lime and garlic. I used sweet Vidalia onion sliced very thin along with the julienned carrots and a liberal amount of the butter. I saved 2 T. of the butter which I wrapped like a fat sausage in plastic wrap and froze. When the fish came out of the oven, I sliced off a medallion of the butter and placed it on top of the fish. Man it was good! I served it with a medley of fresh steamed vegies and a wild rice blend - yummo!

Good, solid dish, but I would change a few things. Firstly, ignoring any apprehensions about fat consumption, I would definitely top the fish with 50% more of the ginger butter, otherwise it barely appears in the background. Secondly, my oven must be a little hot, because the fish was slightly overdone for my tast. You may need to only cook 8 minutes.

Super easy, super good! Will try it with halibut or maybe orange roughey. I think it would work well with either, just make sure it's fresh fish. The ginger butter was a nice touch but it can stand alone without it

This is my favorite recipe for swordfish...very moist and flavorful. It is incredibly easy, but after making it a number of times I've found it is important not to undercook or overcook the fish. The temperature of the fish going into the oven seems to make a big diffence, so you may want to add a few minutes cooking time if it is still very cold.

This was good, and not difficult. Even my 11-year-old, who rejects fish, liked and ate it. The ginger flavor wa snot as strong as I expected; next time I may flake the ginger instead of grating it. Also, the ratio of vegetables to fish was very profuse -- good if you like vegetables, otherwise not. But my son even ate the vegetables, which pick up a nice flavor and texture.

I made this for a celebration dinner when I needed something easy, and my friends loved it! I added chopped fresh jalapenos and a little extra lime zest; I used a Japanese ginger grater to prep the ginger, which I think helps a lot because it grates very finely and catches the juice in the well at the end. If you don't have one, you might want to use the finest side of your grater and do it over a bowl. Delicious!

In my opinion the ginger butter didn't add much. The dish was watery and boring.

Everyone gave it rave reviews. Pretty easy to make for a group.

The flavor of the Ginger and Lime mixed with the carrots and leeks is amazing. And it's so easy to make

My husband liked the dish alot more than I did. The vegetables tasted wonderful but I didn't think the fish really assimilated much of the ginger butter flavor. Maybe if the vegetables were cooked along with the fish for a longer time at a lower temperature?

I've made this many times to rave reviews, with both swordfish and halibut. I use parchment paper instead of foil.

It's nice to know that you can cook a healthy meal that is absolutely delicious! Cooking in the foil really does wonders for the swordfish. Make it tonight!
