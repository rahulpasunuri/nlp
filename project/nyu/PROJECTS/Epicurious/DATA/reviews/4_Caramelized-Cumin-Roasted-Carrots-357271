My carrots came out dry. I'd put some chicken broth in the bottom of the roasting pan next time. The flavor with the cumin was great, and I made it with the easy chicken masala recipe.

Excellent !! I halved the sugar and cut the carrots in 1cm thickness. Took me 25-30 mins in the oven . Worked well with the cumin, but am sure it'll be fine without too !!

Turned out quite well. I decreased the salt, and if I make again I would increase the cumin seeds. Be careful not to overcook.

Great side dish for Indian dinner. Nothing left in dish. Did not bother turning carrots over during roasting, and they turned out just fine.

Very yummy and easy! Will make again. Definately accompanies indian dishes well but could be served with many other things too!

I reduced the amount of salt and carrots and added cauliflower florets. I found that I needed to roast everything for closer to 50 minutes in order for the veggies to be cooked thoroughly. I used the leftovers in an Indian curry dish. I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic! The cumin is great flavour for carrots. So easy. I could have taken them out at 35 min, but was looking for a softer texture, so I went to 45 min. My only complaint is that there was a bit too much salt for my tastes. Next time I will cut it down. I can't say it enough...SO EASY! Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Carmelized is a misleading term for this recipe...roasted would be a better term. That said, the recipe was simple and delicious. I used organic baby carrots which I think made a huge difference. Also I was skeptical of using whole cumin seeds but did and encourage others not to swap for cumin powder. The seeds mellowed with the roasting and were a true enhancement to the dish whereas the powder would have been overwhelming.

My husband and I loved these carrots. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used way less salt. I halved the carrots, but used 1 1/3 tsp. of cumin seed becaue I love it, and we thought they were great. I only roasted for about 25 minutes because my pieces were not huge, and this was perfect. They were nicely browned, with a little bit of crunch from the cumin seeds. I will make these again!

I made this with fennel instead of cumin seeds -- delish! Def half as much salt. Super easy and tasty.

Wayyyyyy to much salt. Otherwise very good. When I made it to bring with me to a meeting I only used a half tsp for a double batch.- you can always add more later. Next time I think I'll use this method with sugar and cinnamon instead of the salt and cumin.

I didn't have non-stick spray so I substituted a little canola oil. I wish I'd read the reviews suggesting to halve the salt because they were definitely too salty for my taste. I was also disappointed to find that the carrots didn't really carmelize even though I cooked them the whole 40 minutes.

delicious. For a change, mix in zucchini and onions and allowed to roast the same way. the flavors work very well together.

Easy and good! I have made this both with cut up whole carrots and baby carrots out of the bag and both have been great. If use bagged baby carrots, cut the roasting time by a few minutes.

Delish! My husband, who hasn't really outgrown his aversion to vegetables, had seconds. Used ground cumin and fleur de sel salt. YUM!

Very simple and delicious! This has become part of my normal rotation. I use ground cumin and lots of it. Sometimes I throw in fingerling potatoes, Yum!

These were great for a change and they did taste a lot like sweet potatoes.

Pretty and delicious. My entire family HATES cooked carrots, but I found myself trying to put together dinner with limited options in the produce drawer. We ate every last bite. I prepared as directed, except cut the salt in half as recommended by other reviews. Some reviewers used ground cumin instead of cumin seed, with mixed results. I used the cumin seed, which I think provides better results.

Very Tasty. They remind me of sweet potato fries.

I cooked the carrots in the oven with the Easy Chicken Masala. They were overcooked (in fact, some were burned) and they were nothing special (couldn't taste the cumin). I did substitute ground cumin for the cumin seeds. There were five of us and no leftovers.

Loved it! I didn't have cumin seeds but I used some ground cumin instead. VERY nice. I like my carrots a bit over done so I cooked for longer. This says 6 servings but there were only two of us and no leftovers!

They were good, but not the best carrots I've ever eaten. The cumin seeds did provide a nice crunch. I made them with a Moroccan chicken dish and they were a great complement. It was also great that this recipe was quick and easy.

These are amazing. I suggest cooking the full 40 minutes and them some so you get some dark "burning." Very easy to make. Served with a tri-tip steak and salad (blue cheese sprinkled on the steak and salad contrasted nicely with the cumin in the carrots).

Yum, but really...........go light on the salt!

Delicious!Toasted the cumin seeds first-great flavor. Would cut back a little on the salt. wonderful with the easy Chicken Masala

So easy and tasty. Amazing what the cumin does. I will make the carrots again, but not the Chicken Masala. The Masala will be deleted from my recipe box.

This recipe was so easy and so tasty. I especially liked the crunch from the seeds.

The best roasted carrot recipe I have ever tasted. The cumin added a nice tang and a slight crunch and was a good contrast to the sweet tender carrots. Not a single carrot was uneaten.

I accidentally "over cooked" these, and they were SOOOOO good! Tasted like candy and my housemates that claim they HATE cooked carrots gobbled them up!

I made this with the chicken masala and all my men loved them. They were tasty and cooked just right.

Pretty good. I would actually give this 3 1/5 forks. I added one sliced onion and some chopped preserved lemon to step up the flavors. Nice alternative to steamed carrots.

Can't wait to try this. I've made a similar recipe using butter and black pepper that leave people asking for the recipe.

These went extremely well with broiled lamb chops and rosemary potatoes.

Made a couple weeks ago for just the two of us. Didn't change anything except the cooking time - only cooked for about 20 minutes for a serving size of 2 people. Went well with a tofu curry that I made up.

Excellent recipe and a great accompanient to Easy Chicken Masala, with some nice broccolini and rice. I would cut back on the sale though.

this was about the best carrot recipe ever - only thing is don't cook it quite so long, 25-30 minutes is plenty unless you want the carrots to completely lose their texture.

There are more reviews for the carrots with the Chicken Masala recipe link. These are fantastic carrots, nicely spicy and interesting. They'd also be nice with grilled meats.
