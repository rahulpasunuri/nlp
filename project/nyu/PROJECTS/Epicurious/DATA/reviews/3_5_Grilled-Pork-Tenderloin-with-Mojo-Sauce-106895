This was pretty good - I'll do it again. Definitely quick & easy. I got it out of the Gourmet cookbook, so didn't think to come here & read the reviews first :). Yes, very garlicky - might cut down or use fresh roasted next time. Otherwise, pretty much did the recipe except I wanted more Orange flavor, so added some orange zest to the sauce, and rubbed some onto the pork before grilling also. What I wanted to come here & say was that the leftovers made a wonderful grilled pork wrap with sour cream sauce. Take that garlicky sauce, and pour it into some sour cream & make a sour cream sauce, then adding salt, fresh chop parsley (oregano would be nice too), and whatever else - we added cucumber to the sauce, & chopped fresh tomatoes to the wrap. Overall, very tasty.

It works with fresh minced oregano too, then you can sprinkle the dried or even powdered oregano on the pork as it's grilling. If the pork is grilled till it's crunchy, you don't even need the mojo sauce!

Made this with some modifications: Made about 1 1/2 cups of the mojo and used 1/2 cup of mojo to marinate the pork tenderloins for about two hours. Simmered remaining mojo (I have trouble with raw garlic) then served it along with pork. Turned out very tasty -- I recommend it for a quick weeknight meal. For a more complex/robust sauce, try Bobby Flay's Pork A La Rodriguez.

I've made this several times, always in the broiler as I don't have a grill. While it was always passable, this last time it was exquisite. I always overcooked before, but now I have a thermometer, so the second it hit 155" I took it out, poured ALL the sauce over it, and wrapped it up in foil. After about 30 minutes I opened up the foil and sliced it and the meat was like butter and very very tasty. I guess if you're not a fan of garlic it might not be your thing, but this is going to be a staple for me from now on!

I thought the sauce was good but a bit too garlicy. Per other reviewers, I sweetened things up a bit by adding honey, but that still didn't do enough to overcome the strength of the garlic.

This gets four forks for being both very tasty and very easy/quick. The changes I made: used fresh oregano instead of dried; blended the sauce ingredients in the food processor (easier and the sauce came out very smooth); slightly reduced the sauce by simmering it for a few minutes before serving (this made it thicker and also mellowed the garlic a bit). It was delicious!

To the marinade I added a hearty amount of lime juice and some fresh cilantro. Made a large batch of the marinade and used 2 parts marinade and 1 part water to cook some basmati rice with fresh peas. I used the Mojo to marinate pork tenderloin medallions. Cooked it all out on the grill with some summer veggies and plantains. I would do this again, and even for my dad who is a foodie.

On a cast-iron grill pan, I grilled the pork 3 mins per side, turning half way to get the cross marks. I used some really nice pork, so it didn't bother me that it was pink in the middle, but if that's a problem you might need to cook more than 12 mins. Also, to the sauce I added fresh ground ginger, red pepper flake (only about half a teaspoon), and white pepper (with ground oregano, and the white pepper, the sauce looks better). After emulsifying, cook the sauce real quickly to mellow out the raw garlic; just bring it to a boil and then take it off the heat.

OMG this is really good! I read the other reviews first (as I always do) and took the chipotle pepper suggestion. It reminded me of another recipe I had for a pork chop glaze so I knew it would work ok. I used the oil and oregano and orange juice as directed and added 1 chipotle pepper which I mashed the same way as the garlic and added a tablespoon of maple syrup for sweetness. Of course then I put it all in the processor to emulsify so you could skip that step. I cooked the pork exactly as directed and at the end used the sauce to glaze the meat. This is so good and I love finding new ways to make pork tenderloins. Will def make this again for guests as well as family dinner. A sure hit!

The recipe is good as is, but the addition of chipotle peppers recommended by the Greenville, SC cook made it outstanding! My variation includes fresh oregano, a half teaspoon of EV Olive Oil for richness and 3 finely chopped chipotle peppers with the seeds removed and sometimes a little honey if the oranges aren't sweet enough. I use the food processor to blend the garlic with the OJ so its smooth ,,, who wants chunks of garlic? I've served this to guests a dozen times and it always gets rave reviews. Recently a friend brought along a date who was a chef and HE asked for the recipe.

I added chipolte peppers w/ sauce and blended all ingredients in a food processor then rubbed and marinated the pork. YUMMY!!

I used pork tenderloin medallions rather than roasting a whole loin. Took half the time and I also doubled the sauce and reduced it so it was more intense the 2nd time I made this and it turned out much more flavorful. Will make this again but with the modifications I've done.

I added some soaked apple wood chips to the fire, kept the heat low, and doubled the cooking time. It was great.

This was in the new Gourmet cookbook. It was ok, easy enough but not sure I'd make it anytime soon.

I thought this recipe was very unexciting and bland. The mojo sauce did very little to enhance the pork.

OK if you are looking for something different for your pork using ingredients you are more than likely to have in the house, otherwise disappointing.

My husband and I made this recipe for our dinner club and the response from our guests was overwhelming... they loved it! We played around with the mojo sauce following some of the comments from other cooks, made it the night before and the flavors were fantastic. We served it with Saffron Rice and Red Pepper Pilaf (on this site), grilled asparagus and a tossed salad... we will definitely serve this meal again!

We thought this was AWFUL. I realize we are in the minority here, but really!!! I followed the recipe, tasted it, added the lemon and a pinch of sugar.....AWFUL!!!! If I could give 0 forks, I would.

Simply delicious! We will definitely make this again. Takes less planning ahead (no marinating) than our other favorite pork tenderloin recipes and was equally as flavorful. The pork by itself is tasty, as is the sauce, but the two together complement each other perfectly. We used orange-tangerine juice and also added more garlic to taste. Made the sauce a couple hours ahead to give time to develop. Grilling took more like 12-15 minutes a side. Served with a garlic-herb rice pilaf and asparagus with orange butter--the meal flowed together flawlessly. A definite keeper!

This was great. I seared the meat on the stove top in the morning then when guests arrived I put the meat on the grill and slow cooked it to 145 degrees. I would recommend making the sauce the night before because the flavors blend over night. I used the lime and orange juice mixture. It tasted great!

The sauce was very spicy due to the garlic - loved that! I seared the pork tenderloin on the stove and then finished it in the oven. Delicious.

This was absolutely mouth-watering delicious! I served it on top of some rice and grilled some portabellos in some of the mojo sauce and it was great. I will definitely make this again.

My family LOVES garlic, but the sauce is VERY garlicky, even for us. If your oranges aren't sweet enough, you might need to add a teaspoon or two of sugar to hold up to the garlic. Overall, we really enjoy this one, especially since it is so easy!

I made this for my friend who's family is from Spain and Cuba, not even realizing. He said it was even better than his mothers! I seared in on the stove, then actually roasted it in the oven, basting it and then tenting with foil to keep the juices in. I also used pre-crushed garlic and added lemon juice as the others suggested.

I too added abit of fresh lemon juice and also a pinch of sugar just to cut down on the taste of the garlic. I didn't have oranges so I used store bought orange juice instead and it turned out absolutely delicious. the garlic is a bit much so I will cut down on it next time. I didn't have dried oregano so I used half dried parsley and half dried sage which gave it a bit of a kick. This is definitely a keeper.

I thought that this turned out to be a pretty decent dish. I did take the advise of a previous poster and "soured" my orange juice with some lime and lemon. The garlic is very strong in this dish, but the citrus really reduces the impact of it. Would definitely make this one again.

My husband loved this dish. I thought it was good not great. But I would make it again. I doubled the sauce.

Very easy and yummy! Used two oranges that were not Navel but I can't remember what type they were! I didn't bother measuring the juice - just squeezed both oranges and used it all.

Good, tasty dish. It was fine using our regular Florida juice oranges. We too love the flavor combination of garlic and orange. The suggested time to cook on the grill turned out perfectly for us.

Mojo is traditionally made with Seville or sour oranges. If you do not have access to seville ornages then combine regular OJ with equal parts lime and lemon juice and you have the right ingredient. OJ and garlic together are delicious, it just has to be the correct orange juice!

Everyone loved this! Tenderloin is already a great meat, but if you like garlic, the sauce is to die for. Consider increasing the amount of paste; my pork was just barely covered. I made it with 2 1/2 pounds of pork, so I used all the juice of two oranges (10 tsps) for the sauce and put some more spices in. Simple ingredients and very very tasty. Be like Emeril and take it up a notch with more garlic. Can't go wrong with this recipe. Made it with Horseradish potatoes from this site and was very good.

This was excellent! I have made it many times. I double the mojo sauce & pour half over the meat & let it set for a few minutes after it is finished cooking..the sauce is also great on rice & it is soo easy!Enjoy!

I haven't tried this dish yet but it sounds excellent and its on my list of things to make. Just wanted to say a thing or two about the temperature suggested if I may. The Trichinosis parasite hasn't been a large issue in the United States for many years and its killed at a 137 degrees so if you cook your tenderloin to 150 degrees or "medium" you will be safe. Cooking it any more just dries it out. Hope this helps.

I didn't make this but it might be better if made with the mojo recipe from the Joy of Cooking that I use and love. Saute minced cloves of garlic in olive oil at low heat so that it is just golden. Remove from heat, then add citrus. Joy calls for lime juice, but it could be orange juice or a mixture.

We made the similar recipe from the September 2002 issue of Bon Appetit where the pork is braised and deep fried (optional). It is served with fried onions and garlic and a similar sauce.

The orange juice mixture is the mojo sauce. You drizzle it on the pork before eating.

This is incomplete. What are you to do with the orange juice mixture? Please advise. Thanks
