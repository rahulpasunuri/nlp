Super straight-foward - hey it's essentially just carrots, fat and spice. It works well for a quick week night dinner, but some simple additions would make it more complex with minimal effort.... I felt this needed a little "something extra", so I added 1/2 medium onion cut into a 1/4 inch dice and added it with the carrots. I also felt this needed some acid, so I added juice from 1/2 Meyer Lemon with the chicken broth. I'd make it again. The dish would probably also benefit from a little minced cilantro garnish - I'll do that next time

A richly spiced side dish which makes a lovely accompaniment to plainly prepared chicken. I did reduce the vegetable oil a bit, and added a bit of water to keep the carrots from scorching.
