Do not bother with this recipe! I followed the recipe as published only I shortened the baking time. Dry, dry dry! The cake was a crumbly disappointment. Choose a different recipe and don't waste your time.

This is quite a yummy treat, but more like a crispy shortbread than a cupcake. I thought the icing didn't quite work with the cake since it was a little overly sweet compared to the more savory cupcake. Highly recommended, though!

These cupcakes are very delicate, very grown up. I love them!

These cupcakes are delicious! The creamy frosting compliments the texture of the muffin, which does feel a little bit less moist than most cakes. Suits a mature palate better than a child's -- nutty, not too sweet, elegant looking. And very easy to make; the recipie is quite precise in saying that it makes twelve cupcakes.

These have a very nice flavor, but I found them to be dry. I wonder if it could have been too much ground almonds. That's actually what caught my eye. I really like almond flavor.

These are lovely cupcakes. The cake is not too sweet--that sweetness is provided by the icing, and the toasted nuts make these a real treat. The icing has a wonderful fresh taste that contrasts beautifully with the mellow taste of nuts. I substituted vanilla extract for the almond and plan to make these again. Really quite lovely.

This is really more of a muffin than a cupcake, and I think they'd be a lot better without the icing, served for breakfast or brunch, not dessert. Also, in my oven, the cooking time was quite a bit longer. More like 25 - 30 min.
