These were quick and delicious. Here are a few of my notes: I didn't have any basil, so I had to omit it, which I'm sure added to the 'fast' factor. The batter was slightly too thick, so I added more beer. I was skeptical of a creamy, rich mayo based sauce with a fried food. I was temped to make a marinara as well, concerned about the balance. But the lemon juice and the sour cream make it tangy, and a perfect match. I did a rough chop on the fennel seeds. Olive oil was fine for frying.

Overrated. It was okay. Deepfrid basil is a new delicious fun thing to try. Other than that? Dull. Recipe was average. Batter was okay. Meh. Two thumbs perfectly centred. Lacklustre. Unimpressive. Adjective.

Great recipe. After I (tediously) stuffed a quarter of the spears, I discovered that the basil was just popping back out again. So I chopped it and put it in the batter instead. That worked just fine. I used Pamela's baking mix and New Grist beer to make the recipe gluten free. And I also used Greek yogurt and lime instead of the lemon. My family loved it. Delicious. We'll have it again since our zucchini plants are producing abundantly this year. Thank you, Gourmet.

We had very small basil leaves so I stuffed two or even three down the length of the slit. Made the dipping sauce with a few tbsp of mayo and 1/4 c. greek yogurt in place of sour cream--I don't know if it's any healthier but it sure tasted good.

The only thing I would do different is make the batter thinner. Maybe a cup of beer. Also, the sauce was too heavy for a summer veg. I could have done without the mayo in the sauce. Overall, you can't beat the surprise taste of basil in these things!

I made these for a holiday party and while I really liked the taste of the zucchini, I thought stuffing the zucchini with basil was really just a big pain. I didn't make the sauce either, but anything that you would normally dip zucchini in would work.

oh dear- it looks like i am the odd one out. I thought these were ok, but i felt i have tasted batter for this kind of dish that i liked better. of course, the one big caveat is that i didn't make the dip, leading me to wonder if it was the dip that was so tasty, rather than the zucchini/basil fried together. I will make it again, but i might find a different batter and will be sure to make the dip. Note: i put in a few fat strips of eggplant with basil, also comes out ok.

This is a great combonation of basil and zuchinni. One word of advice though- do not put a lid on top to keep warm- it will turn soft and soggy from the condensation. It's great for dinner parties or bbq appetizers.

I made this recipe for my husband, and he and I both loved it! I coated the spears in flour first, then I coated in batter and fried in canola oil for a more tempura like spear. I also tried double dipping and that was delicious too! I definitely will make this dish for a group of friends as a starter.

Excellent, really enjoyed it. Very easy to make, everyone who tried it would make it again. We made with Lemon Aioli, outstanding!

Really good! We aren't typically that fond of fennel so used half the dip base for the fennel dip and put tyme in the other half. Both were good, but we preferred the tyme dip.

This recipe is sooooooo delicious. I make it as an appitizer for casual dinner parties and I get so many compliments. On warm breezy evenings, my husband and I enjoy this alone on the patio after the baby is asleep. Life doesn't get much better.

This recipe has become a summer favorite, especially late in the season when there are more zucchini than you know what to do with. Delicious and easy to prepare.

This was my first time ever actually frying anything. I was too timid with the heat and about half of my zucchini spears came out soggy - ick. But, the ones that did turn out were very good, except even they were not as crispy as I imagined they would be. So, if anyone out there is fry-shy like me, I guess we have to just turn it up and let it spatter happily all over the stove (and us)! Otherwise, the recipe is very easy and fun to make. The fennel mayonnaise is YUMMY - good for dipping just about anything.

I make a meal out of these on a late summer evening, with a tomato salad, some good bread, a yougurt and lemon dipping sauce, and good bottle of pinot gris. Add good company and a breezy porch, and you are a happy little clam

Served these as an appetizer before a light italian meal - very tasty. Another way to use fresh zucchini and basil from the garden. My guests also enjoyed the fennel dip - it was a nice compliment to the zucchini. Stuffed the zucchinis a few hours in advance and covered them with a damp towel and refrigerated.
