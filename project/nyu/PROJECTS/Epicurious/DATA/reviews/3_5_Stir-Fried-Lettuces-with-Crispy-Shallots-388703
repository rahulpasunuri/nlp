Loved this recipe. I needed a side for some carb dominant meals and this was perfect. It was quick to make and was just so delicious and flavorful. I made 2 changes. I used thin strips of sliced Genoa Salami that I had on hand for sandwiches and instead of brown rice, I used bulgur wheat with some lemon zest.

Really, Really liked this recipe! I did make some additions to the recipe which have been extremely successful - all while making it a more protein packed dish. I added in chicken breast - cook before sausage, I've also added in baby bok choy and shrimp.(cook before adding in other greens) I have requests for this weekly! Yum! Enjoy!

This was surprisingly tasty and fairly healthy. I used a salami sausage that had been soaked in cabernet and it really added tons of flavor! Surprisingly delicious!

Fantastic! I did add a pinch of ground cayenne pepper to the recipe and a dash of celery salt once plated. This was absolutely easy to make and I served it over farro...will definitely make this one again!

Amazing? Probably not, but I still enjoyed this. Maybe it's just because, as far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with anything that involves lettuce or fried shallots.

I didn't even want to give this a fork, because it was not good. I was so disappointed. I actually went back to check, becasue I figured there had to be something I had left out. It was bland beyond belief, and I couldn't believe it, because it looked amazing when I plated it. But there were so many flavors that were missing. I used a really good Salami, like it called for, and still, the flavor was not there. If you are going to make it, be prepared to substitue just about everything, to make it enjoyable.

Delicious and very quick to make.Tasted just as good as the picture made it look. Made recipe exactly as printed except used 4 cups shredded cabbage instead of watercress and lop xuong (Chinese sausage)instead of salami. Try it, you will love it!!

This was surprisingly delicious! I did make some substitutions- sweet yellow onion for shallots and red leaf lettuce for iceberg- but the flavors were fantastic! For the sausage I used the Herb Crusted Salami from the Whole Foods cold cut counter- I loved the texture it had when cooked- and all the flavor it imparted to the greens. This will be a weekly meal staple. Try this ASAP- you'll be glad you did!!!
