These pancakes are a hit...and I love keeping the banana and pecans out until they are put on the griddle satisfying my picky eaters who don't want the extras and the adults who do. Next time, I'll probably add a little more sugar and vanilla since the kids are not fans of maple syrup.

My husband and I loved these. Except that I chopped up the bananas and nuts and combined them into the batter. Thawed blueberries into maple syrup. A keeper.

I use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour.

A Sunday mornings tradition in our house. I mash the bananas and add them to the batter, double the vanilla, and add about a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda. Delicious and easy.

Wonderful! We added sliced bananas and blueberries to the mix. Had it for dinner and it was delicious. Great comfort food. This is a must save recipe.

These pancakes were fluffy and had a nice texture, but unfortunately they really tasted like cardboard. Fresh whole wheat flour is a must.

Finally, a whole wheat pancake recipe that my kids will eat! I just left out the bananas and the pecans.

I enjoyed these pancakes. I substituted 1 cup of milk with water to make them lighter. Ate them with jam instead of syrup. Yummy.

I make big batches of the dry ingredients and store it in an airtight container so I have yummy whole wheat pancakes easily on hand on weekend mornings. I do generally add bananas, blueberries or strawberries but the recipe is yummy on its own. Sometimes, I thin the batter with a little extra milk too. These are great!

I have made these a couple of times. They are delicious and feel a little healthier and lighter than regular white flour pancakes. I once added blueberries into the batter and they were YUM.

Easy, delicious. Made one batch with bananas, one with blueberries. Both great!

It always amuses me when people say "this is a great recipe! I made these changes:" That said, this is a great recipe! I made these changes: all whole wheat pastry flour, agave syrup instead of sugar, twice as much vanilla, added cinnamon, diced the bananas and included them in the batter. Yum! Will make again ; ).

Really yummy and easy. Used 2 percent milk, 2TB butter, all whole wheat pastry flour, and 2TB ground flax, and 2 teas cinnamon. Super nice and healthy and fluffy.

Tastes like banana pudding! Yummy. I used 2% milk and it was fine.

pretty good recipe. i substituted oat bran flour for the unbleached, all purpose flour which turned out fine. i also added mashed bananas to the milk mixture for a better consistency. and i used 2 tbsp oil instead of the butter. nice recipe suggestion :)

very tasty and fluffy. i halved the recipe and used all whole wheat pastry flour (it's what i had) and it came out great. i added a little cinnamon as well. i also found it easier and better to mix the bananas and nuts into the batter.

Good P-cakes - nice sneak in of the whole wheat, I even added 2 tbsp of flax and the kids still don't notice.

I did not make the topping, but used fresh berries instead. The pancakes themselves could not have been better. This is the best whole wheat pancake recipe I have tried.

Very good. Kids liked them a lot. Easy to make. Will make often.

I made this recipe for a Sunday morning breakfast for me and my husband. It was delicious; dense and custard like. He prefers more protein-based dishes (like crepes) so this was a new alternative. It was much easier and faster than traditional pancakes or crepes. I added ½ teaspoon of both vanilla and almond extract. I will definitely try this as a dessert the next time we have guest over.

These were alright. Not fantastic, not terrible. They were a little too salty and a little too bitter for me.

I love trying different pancakes and these are a definite repeat. I sauteed a few thin slices of banana to place on top the pancakes.

Good. Not deserving of outstanding reviews, but a nice change of pace from the usual pancakes.

I skipped the sugar and it was still sweet and delicious.

Made this for brunch and everyone loved them. Cut the bananas paper thin for flat pancakes. I added some chocolate chips for the kids. Fast, easy and whole wheat - we'll make these again for sure.

"These are the best pancakes I've ever eaten in my whole life!" claimed my 8 year old daughter. I have to say that I agree.
