This is one of my staple recipes. Like some of the other reviewers, I prefer to add a bit of honey for sweetness. It works well with a variety of white fish and you can also substitute tofu for the fish!

This is one of the best and easiest sauces! I have made it for both sea bass and chicken. I've found that you can speed up the process by putting cilantro, ginger, and shallot in a food processor and then mixing in the liquid ingredients. Saves tons of time in chopping and whatnot. Best thing is this doesn't need to sit in the fridge and marinate...you can literally make the sauce, cover the fish or chicken, throw it in the oven, and 10-15 minutes later have an amazing, healthy, flavourful meal. I've also found that making extras is great for sandwiches during the week. It keeps well in the fridge and just gets even more flavourful. I make this for myself as chicken on a regular basis and for guests as sea bass (very expensive). Have passed this recipe to all of my friends and they also love it!

I loved this. It had a nice clean taste and was easily made with ingredients on-hand.

So good and easy. I basted midway through and added all of the sauce while cooking. With the high oven temp ,the sauce was a bit crispy and browned. We couldn't stop saying "yummmmm" throughout the meal!

EXCELLENT!! and so easy. I only roasted the sea bass for 10 minutes.

We make this once a week and use California sea bass which is not endangered as far as I know. There is usually too much for one night so we make fish tacos with the left overs. My friend loves the sauce so much she makes quarts of it for big parties to put on salmon and other fishes. Such an easy recipe, while the oven is heating, the sauce can be made. I make it in a pyrex that just barely holds the two filets and it never dries out in 15 minutes.

I really did not find any extraordinary flavors here. The sauce was too sour and did not complement the fish. I prefer the Walnut Crusted Seabass recipe much better.

The tried this recipe last night for a dinner party. I personally thought the marinade lacked something. I don't know if it was too sour with the lime juices, but it personally was not for me. I purchased fresh white sea bass, which I thought the sea bass was great but the flavors were okay. I also took the other reviewers advice and added a dash of honey and roasted a dish or asparagus and mushooms on the side.

Made this recipe last night, adding a dash of honey. It was exceptional. In reading reviews this a.m. I see that jwelby from St. Louis, MO had already preempted us on the honey. We're from San Luis Obispo. Don't know if old Saint Looie is looking over our shoulders

Sea Bass is an endangered species ...

Personally, I prefer the Miso Glazed Sea Bass on this site. It has delicious flavor without having to mince shallots, ginger & cilantro. Also, by baking at 500 degrees the sauce on top of the fish was dry - I spooned more sauce over the top to take care of the dried-out look. The sea bass was delicious and didn't need very much.

Not bad, I roasted as directed and saw no color change of the fish. One thing I would change is grate the ginger instead of chop unless you like to bite on ginger bits.

I have made this so many times, but this is my first review. I have used various white fish, chilean sea bass, haddock & cod and they are all fantastic with this simple sauce. I serve with coconut rice and sesame snow peas for a light, quick and delicious meal.

This was a wonderful dish and I have made it twice in the past few weeks -- once for my fiance' and I and once with friends. I didn't experience the "smoking" in the house and I did turn the temperature for cooking down to 450 degrees instead. Both times, I watched the fish closly and had great success; fish was firm but still very tender and juicy. Like some other reviewers, I used halibut rather than the sea bass both times. I also roasted some asparagus in the oven at the same time as the fish and served with with rice. Excellent!

Rating: 4
Fabulous. In a separate glass dish I coated asparagus and a medley of mushrooms with the sauce and roasted both the fish and the vegetables at the same time in the oven. Plated the sea bass over a mound of brown basmati rice, with the vegetables around the fish/rice, and drizzled the sauce over everything. Doubled the sauce in order to cover the vegetables and an extra piece of fish.

Rating: 3
Made this for a dinner party and the fish was absolutely delicious. Sea bass was too rare and expensive around here, so I used halibut instead and it turned out really well. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is that it smoked like crazy in the oven. I had read the other reviews and expected some smoke, so removed the smoke detector prior to cooking, but if there was some other way to cook it with comparable results, I would be all for it. Will definitely make again though.

The sauce was amazing. It tastes like the ginger dressing in some of my favorite asian restaurants. I will make this again for sure. I'm not really good at fish but this time it turned out well! My girls even ate it!

I added about 1 teaspoon of sesame oil for more flavour; and since I had quite a bit of sauce leftover, I cut up chunks of Japanese cucumbers and left it to marinade in the sauce overnight in the fridge. Delicious!

Rating: 4
This was amazing! I served it with coconut/cinnamon rice and snow peas sauted in sesame oil like the recipe suggests and it was amazing! To make it a full Asian-inspired meal I served a before dinner drink of Lychees Martinis using Rasberry flavored vodka and Lychee juice and used two Lychees as a garnish. I also served the papaya halves with scoops of coconut and banana ice cream and my guests loved it all! The only thing I did differently is that I added a little MAE PLOY Sweet Chile Sauce to the sauce for the sea bass.

This will go into heavy rotation. It has it all: simple to prepare, easy to find ingredients, and delicious results. I used orange roughy and cooked for 10 minutes - it definitely did smoke a bit. Also, I doubled the sauce, and was happy that I had.

This was delicious and pretty easy. It does smoke and splatter a bit in the oven, but a piece of foil loosely over the top works fairly well. I made this with halibut, spinach, and couscous. Very yummmmmmy!

Fabulous! Fast and flavorful. Made it for a South Beach diet dinner with snow peas. Doubled the sauce and it even tasted great on the snow peas. Great weekday dinner.

I made the recipe exactly as given and found it perfect for my tastes. The "sauce" is actually more like a tapenade or salsa than what I typically think of as sauce. In any case, it was absolutely delicious. Either the sea bass I purchased was the best ever, or the high temperature baking worked wonders on it. Only the next time will tell...and there will definitely be a next time.

Excellent. Shop Rite did not have fresh sea bass so I used Tilipia. I tweaked the recipe and added more soy about 3 tbs and added more ginger, garlic and shallots. I also used less oil and used 2 tbs. Next time I will use 1 tbs. Otherwise it will be too oily. My husband suggested I try this on chicken and bbq.

Very simple and absolutely delicious. Reminiscent of something you can get at roy's. Nice asian-inspired flavors. I served this with snow-peas and it worked as a complete meal

This was everything you would want in a recipe - easy, quick, delicious and forgiving. I didn't use sea bass as it is not readily available in Chicagoland so I used orange roughy instead. I substituted one of the teaspoons of olive oil with sesame oil as another reviewer suggested and it was perfect. Great weekday dinner, will make again.

This was one of the easiest recipes. I actually read it wrong the first time and mixed all the ingredients together, poured it over the fish and baked it int he oven. The flavors were still wonderful. I served it over a bed of steamed spinach and pured some of the marinade over the fish and spinach. I used green onions rather than shallots since that is what was in my kitchen.

Absolutely fantastic each time! Instead of rice and snow peas, we make it with wasabi mashed potatoes and haricot verts. Plate it up in a bowl with potatoes on bottom, sea bass, top with beans, and drizzle with remaining sauce.

Wonderful! We used orange roughy instead of sea bass - I agree with other reviewers that any firm white fish would work well with this recipe. I added a few drops of toasted sesame oil to the remaining sauce before I drizzled it over the cooked fish for added aroma. So good, we wished we would have made more!

At 5:15pm last Friday, my husband said he would be up for sea bass. I frantically searched this sight and landed upon this recipe. Of course, by the time I arrived home with the sea bass, my husband informed me he'd rather have Frosted Flakes. Well, after my first bite of this, I was so glad he changed his mind. I loved this; I made it twice in 3 days and can't wait to have it again.

My inlaws were so impressed with this recipe. I used chilean sea bass and haddock. They both came out very moist and flavorful. The sauce was beyond compare. I left out the cilantro because I already had put it in the shrimp mango curry wonton cups on this website. I don't think the fish needed it and it would have dried out in the hot oven.

This was an easy recipe but I think if you steamed it, the fish would be better. I started with an entire sea bass (a small one) and maybe I should have purchased only fillets since I kind of had a tough time making the fish into fillets.

Perfect!! I omitted the cilatro, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. And thanks to all for the heads-up about disarming the smoke alarm before baking. We served the fish over rice with snow peas and mushrooms sauteed in sesame oil, along with a tomato-avocado salad to add a little bit of color to the plate. It was such a success that we'll be serving this to my sweetie's parents!!

This dish is fabulous! I made it with Sesame Jasmine Rice with Soybeans (also on Epicurious) and did the snow peas, as suggested. Everything turned out great, even though we did set off the smoke alarms. I shared the recipe with a friend who made it and also loved it. We both agreed it does not need the cilantro. (I made it with and thought it tasted a little weird and she made it without.) The leftovers were just as delicious as the first night. I can't wait to make it all again!

Tasty, tasty, tasty!! Made "as is" and loved it and we eat LOTS of sea bass. Two things I would suggest... turn off your smoke alarm as the olive oil got a bit toasty in the 500 deg. oven and double the sauce for drizzing over your starch of choice for a nice presentation. We used quinoa and wow, pretty plate with the little germ rings and the lovely fish. Will make again for sure!

Fantastic and EASY! We used halibut since we've got about 40 pounds of it in the freezer from the boyfriend's brother's fishing expedition in Alaska, but it was still lovely (I'll try it with actual bass in the summer.) The sauce was light and delicious, a welcome change from cream-based sauces that are ubiquitous these days. I tried the recommended snowpeas, but they weren't a big hit. Next time I'll serve with green beans steamed with ginger and sesame seeds.

This was one of the easiest and most delicious meals I have ever made. The marinade was so flavorful, I think it would be great on other meats and fish as well. Because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, I had to substitute lemon juice for lime juice, jarred minced garlic for the shallots, and I left out the cilantro. I even used jarred ginger instead of fresh. I will make this a regular meal and recommend it to my friends and family.

Phenonminal! One pan and so easy. Everyone loved it. I added the remaining sauce as well as a sprinkle of pine nuts during the last 5 minutes of baking. The sauce is stong on a stand alone basis, but works wonders with the delicate fish. Definitely added to our list of recipe favorites.

Good heavens, this is delicious and easy. The flavor is remarkably complex; had I not made it myself, I'd have sworn there were far more ingredients involved. Served it with braised baby bok choy and rice with bonito flakes. (Also on this site) Fantastic low-effort, high payoff dinner.

We used orange roughy in place of sea bass because the store didn't have it. Double the amount of fish for two or you'll be eating off of your guest's plate. The ginger soy sauce is so easy and so yummy! We served with rice, a nice green salad and crusty loaf. Two cold beers and you have the perfect light summer fish dish. Really an excellent and easy dish.
