Good overall and we doubled the recipe. For the broth, we made 1/2 c. broth, then added a gelatin leaf, stirred until dissolved, then cooled in the fridge for a jelly texture. For time sake, used pre-made dough from an asian shop but it was hard to 'seal' so the juices tended to run out.

Very tasty - I would have sliced the cabbage a little thinner, and I had to add quite a bit more water to the dough, but all in all these taste exactly like what I'd expect in a restaurant.

Just a note to novice cooks attempting Chinese dishes, "Shao Hsing" might be difficult to find if you are looking for a bottle with a label specifically spelled this way. Due to the dialect and conversion of characters to letters, one must be open to the sounds rather then exact spelling. The bottle I use and have seen in 99% of the stores I shop in is spelled "Shaoxing". It's the exact same thing and it's used in 90% of my recipes. Purchasing a bottle is a good idea because once you begin to substitute, it is impossible to fault the author for something they never suggested in the first place.

As I understand it, most folks like these with the vinegar, but we make our own sauce (ya really gotta try this): A nice bit of soy sauce, several shakes of sesame oil, sprinkled well with chopped cilantro leaves. Mmmm... :D My fiance is from Beijing and he lives for dumplings...I **had** to learn to make these. ;)

Ummm, it called for 8 ounces of cabbage - not 8 cups. I think I now know why you had such trouble and they weren't worth it.

The over-the-top reviews for this recipe surprise me -- I just spent a lot of time making these, and have a number of problems to report. First, there is no epicurious.com recipe or link to the first ingredient here, Homemade Chicken Broth. Author Grace Young makes it clear in her broth recipe (whose url I provide below) that canned chicken broth is NOT an acceptable substitute! (Nor is this your granny's boiled-chicken brew -- see the recipe for the broth at www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/1999/wisdom/broth.html.) If you make the broth the way the author suggests, you will add at least 4 hours preparation time to the pot sticker recipe. Secondly, exactly how much Napa cabbage is called for here? Sorry, but 4 large leaves of the stuff ain't gonna yield 8 cups. I ended up chopping all the leafy material from a huge Napa cabbage to reach my 2 quartsful. I also had to sub regular white cooking wine for the Shao Hsing, since the latter was nowhere to be found in my NYC neighborhood -- and if you only need a teaspoonful, why mount an expedition for something like this? How did these dumplings taste, finally? Not bad, but certainly not great. Both my husband and I thought they needed salt...so there we were, after this incredible amount of work, shaking salt onto these buggers after dunking them in the dipping vinegar. To me, that's not appropriate after a recipe that calls for this much work. (And you couldn't sample for salt earlier along the way -- this is raw pork we're dealing with here! )As for the reviewer from Anaheim who calls this a simple recipe, I can only speculate that she was being sarcastic. The reviewer who said she'd spent the whole day on these was more on target. Bottom line on these dumplings is that you can get the same thing, in 10 minutes or less, from any reliable Chinese restaurant. You guessed it -- I won't be going through this ordeal again.

I stuck to the recipe, making the wrappers (MUCH easier than I thought it would be) and using the chicken broth. Excellent! This is a keeper.

Although I have not made this particular recipe before I always make a double or triple batch of potstickers for my family of two and freeze the leftovers. Quite successfully - although not quite as good as fresh. I freeze them unccooked on cookie sheets and then pack them into freezer bags. When I want to use them I simmer them in water to defrost and then saute and steam them as normal. It makes for a quick (and good) dinner on hurried nights.

My best friend and I are absolute potsticker addicts and are continously disappointed in the quality of pot stickers we encounter when dining out. It seems that most places these days prefer to save time by using the store bought wrappers instead of homemade dough. Hence I've been on a quest to find the perfect recipe so we can fulfill our addiction at home. This is IT!! It was an all day project for me (I don't know if I'm just slow, or this is normal) but the results were really worth the effort. Next time I might try doubling the recipe and putting half of them in the freezer for use at a later date. I don't know how well they would hold up, but I figure it's worth the try especially considering the fact that it is a rare occasion when I have an entire day to devote to cooking. Next time I might also increase the meat to cabbage ratio as I prefer a slightly "meatier" pot sticker.

This is very similar to the way my (Cantonese) mom makes potstickers -- however, minus the jellied chicken broth. I'm so happy to finally find a recipe. She always just improvised the amounts when she made them. I've always found that the potstickers are plenty juicy without the addition of the jellied broth, as long as your pork is not overly lean. My mom sometimes adds Chinese chives (gow choi) to the mix, try it if you can find it -- a very bright fresh taste addition (sometimes called garlic chives). We always made homemade dough, I rolled plenty in my childhood years (and still do when I visit home). Well, worth the effort if you have the time!

Really, truly delicious. Well worth the effort, but actually not that much effort if all the ingredients are measured out and you have some time to let the dough rest. The family I cook for does not eat pork, so I substituted the filling with about three-fourths part ground sirloin and one-fourth part ground turkey. The results were surprisingly outstanding. I believe that the homemade dough makes these taste so special and would recommend not skipping that step if you're able. And the dipping sauce is perfect. I would actually double it just to make sure there's enough if anyone asks for more. Superior recipe.

This recipe takes time, but its worth it. My husband grew up in Japan and he says they are just as good as the gyoza he had at the local Ramen shops. I didn't bother to go through with the jellied chicken stock, but no one seemed to miss it.

Very good. For health reasons, I wouldn't mind making do with a little less oil for pan-frying, and a little less salt (either by rinsing the salted cabbage or by reducing the soy sauce). Next time, I will try a little more of the jelled broth, since I really didn't notice it. I took a shortcut and used store-bought pot sticker wrappers; I figured I helped my mom make more than enough of them from scratch as a child! P.S. Judging from the pattern I see in the reviews, I wonder if the key to improving this from 3 to 4 forks is not to use store-bought wrappers and to make them from scratch as the recipe states?

AMAZING!

I took a few liberties with this recipe in order to make it in advance and bring to a party and it worked out wonderfully. I made it with store bought won ton wrappers and used chicken instead of pork. I pan fried the pot stickers before bringing to the party. I brought my wok and bamboo steamer with me and steamed them there to rewarm. I served it with a dipping sauce which was a combination of a few dipping sauces I found on this site: soy sauce, water, sesame oil, sugar, minced ginger. A great dish!

I tried this with about 1/2 cup of shrimp in place of the pork and it was delicious. I also eliminated the vegetable oil and the chicken stock without a problem (by using non-stick cooking spray). Maybe a little too much work for most weeknights, but well worth the effort.

The only thing I would do to change this recipe is to lessen the amount of fresh ginger just a bit. I used ground chicken instead of pork with great success, and I used soy sauce with the vinegar for dipping. My children just gobbled these up as fast as I could make them. My husband said they were as good as any he had in a restaurant or better. Easier to make than the recipe looks.
