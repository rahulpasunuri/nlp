Loved this--so easy to make. It's a good winter dish for us. Grilling is a little bit difficult in a blizzard!

Not a bad dish--I pan seared sea bass in place of the Mahi-Mahi. My wife can't eat too many many onions so I added a few things in addition to the tasty Vidalia. I added a hungarian pepper, 2 very flavorful summer Jersey tomatoes and a splash of white wine to balance acidity along with the lemon juice. Served this with a side of herbed quinoa and asparagus with a Sauvignon Blanc for dinner. Would certainly make this again.

We loved this-have made this using mahi-mahi and orange roughy...this is definitely a keeper!

This dish is delicious and easy to make on a weeknight or for company. I have made it three times in the past month. I did not have capers on hand the first time and used chopped kalamata olives instead. I made the relish and pan roasted the fish on top of the relish. I don't like to dirty more pans than I need. Outstanding every time!

I grilled the fish on a grill pan rather than broiling it, but other than that followed the recipe exactly - and it turned out wonderfully! It was so quick and delicious, and my boyfriend loved it. I served it with Couscous with Herbs and Lemon (from this site) and grilled asparagus. Sublime!

I love mahi-mahi, but all we had on hand was frozen orange roughy. that said, the onion relish was very quick, very simple (you probably have all the ingredients in your fridge already!) and really quite delicious. will be more than happy to make this again for the husband and I, and it would be a great last-minute dinner for unexpected guests as well.

This is so good and so easy! I used Ohno (famous Yoko and John fish...just kidding) and it turned out really well. I made it for two instead of four. I made half the fish and all of the topping. I would do that again b/c the topping was so very yummy!

This is really excellent and very easy. It seriously only took me 30 minutes, if that. Great dish.

Couldn't find mahimahi and used Lake Victoria Red Snapper instead. It was delicious but I can only imagine how much better it would have been with the mahimahi. Next time.

The onion topping is delicious. I used red snapper fillets and baked them at 400F until done. I would definitely make this simple yet gourmet dish again.

This is an easy and quick recipe. I will definately make it again. I like capers and added a little more than the recipe called for.
