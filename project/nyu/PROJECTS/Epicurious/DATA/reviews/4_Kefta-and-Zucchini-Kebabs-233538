This is the second or thrid time making this. I absolutely love it! Easy and it's always a huge hit with the crowd. Last night, I served as part of a greek theme menu. Did not serve in skewers, and skip the zucchini (even though I love them). I used a cup of panko soaked in a little milk for the bread crumbs, and added an egg (doubled the recipe). The result were lighter, yet still meaty, meatballs. I will make it this way from now on.

Flavor was fantastic, agree with the other viewers the reduce the soaking of the bread since the mositure content makes the meatballs extremely tender and somewhat difficult to handle. Made the entire recipe and it works so well together. MMade homemade Hummus and added Whole Wheat and White pitas on the side

Served with whole wheat pitas and something like a fatoush salad. Everything was delicious. Yum. I can't wait to make these as an appetizer for our next summer party.

Delicious, tender and a great addition to middle eastern menus.I just made this twice in two days. Here are my adjustments. Added 2 or 3 cloves of chopped garlic in with onion, added fresh basil and cut out the cinnamon, which I didn't like. I did one batch in a grill pan and the other in the oven. Both turned out great but the grill pan ones had nice grill marks. I didn't do the zucchini at all but will try that later. Added chopped cucumber to the yoghurt sauce as others have suggested. Served with ratatouille with crumbled feta on top and pita bread.

I served this last night for my book club and everyone loved it. I was set to grill these on skewers, but they were so soft I didn't think they would hold together on the grill. I ended up broiling them and grilling the zucchini. I used Fage Greek yogurt and found it was too thick. I would recommend using regular yogurt and doubling the recipe. I paired with lemon herb couscous and started with the Tomato, Watermelon, & Feta salad. Thanks you Epicurious for the great recipes!

My boyfriend is STILL talking about this lamb. Made patties and grilled for Middle Eastern style sandwich. WOW. Had to sub mint for cilantro, but think it would be nice either way.

It could be the altitude, but I found I got a better meatball when I didn't soak the bread and instead added 1 beaten egg. I also ALWAYS double the yogurt sauce as it makes for great dipping with warm pita bread!

Made this tonight. Didn't put cayenne peppers and added some "kofte" spice in addition. I didn't have white sandwich bread so used about 1/2 cup of panko instead. It was really delicious. We made it into 8 small burger patties and grilled it on a George Foreman Grill. I know it sounds hokey but there was a lot of oil run off so the burger wasn't greasy at all. The whole house smelled amazing. Would totally make it again. Yum!

These are delicious! I use ground turkey instead of lamb. I also skip the skewers and make them on a ridged grill pan. Adding cucumber and red onion to the sauce gives it a bit more texture and flavor.

These were quick and easy, but broil them for about 1/2 of the time the recipe suggests.

We loved these. I have since made them twice again. So very flavorful, succulent, the lamb works well as patties or meatballs. Easy and fun!

This is a great and easy recipe to add to your collection. I made it for the first time for a party and everyone there raved about it. I substituted bread crumbs for the bread and it came out just fine.

we were blown away by the flavor and moistness of these meatballs, as well as the perfect balance of the tzatziki (used greek yoghurt and added minced cukes as well). we skipped trying to do these en brochette and just made small burger sized patties, like the Middle Eastern restaurant nearby.I strongly recommend grilling them, as the smoke added a whole 'nother dimension to the flavor. Served with greek salad and saffron rice. We believe this is this best recipe we have tried for the grill from epicurious so far, and we have tried many excellent recipes!

Followed the recipe to a tee. We ended up doing the meatballs in the oven as suggested and not on the skewers. They were the best meatballs we have ever tasted! The zucchini skewers were excellent. Rounded out the meal with some herb and lemon couscous (as did another reviewer) and it was "restaurant quality". We will definitely be using this recipe on dinner guests in the near future.

Made this last night and everyone loved it- even the pickier eaters! Served it with lemon herb couscous (I added the leftover zucchini marinade-wow), homemade baba ghannouj, hummus, pita and salad- a total middle eastern feast. I did add a few extra spices as mentioned and used half pork, half lamb.I always add some shredded english cucumber to my tzatziki to make it even more refreshing. We will definitely make again. We must be big eaters because I used two lbs of meat total and we ate every last bite and only had 7 people.

This recipe was a big hit at a dinner party. Even the guests who didn't care for lamb or zucchini enjoyed these kabobs.

Even my 2 year old daughter loved these. I skipped the cinnamon and just chopped fine instead of using the food processor, but otherwise followed the recipe to a t. A lovely dinner for company when served with rice.

Pretty good kebabs. Very moist. The spices are great. A bit too much cinnamon, but that's easy to adjust next time. Will definetely make again.

Excellent, everybody loved it. Not as hot as I expected and the meatballs require great care in turning on grill or they will fall apart.
