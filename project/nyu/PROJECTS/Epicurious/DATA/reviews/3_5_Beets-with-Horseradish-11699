This is not a dish for wimps! Sometimes I add Walla Walla onions. Can be quadrupled (or more), but I would increase the beet amount a little. I cooked up a pickle barrel's worth of beets (without the green) and not one beet cube was left by the end of our cookout. Everyone commented on the horseradish punch as they gobbled them down.

I dont like beets but my boyfriend does so I thought I'd try it. And as it turns out - I like it! Per my mom's recommendation, I sauteed the beet leaves in garlic and oil. And that was good too!

I made it for a holiday party and everyone loved it. It's easy and festive and delicious. I'll definately make it again.
