I grilled the eggplant on a panini press before grilling the sandwiches. Worked great and didn't have to coat the slices with oil. I used canned artichokes (well drained) to save calories. Also worked great. These sandwiches were intended to complement a spicy chicken soup I'd concocted and they did the job very well. I could see adding another layer like bacon, or roasted red pepper, but we loved them just as they were.

Made this twice, secord time i added cooked bacon which i felt it needed, did not help much. A lot of work for not much taste.

This was so easy to make and so very good! I did add some garlic and we put a slice of tomato on the top. Yummy and very filling.

Tried this due to left over artichoke hearts. followed the recipe exactly but used Aunt Millie's Italian bread. Made enough for 5 sandwiches. They were do again. Next time I will grill a large eggplant and add about 10 oz. of artichokes. Also, I am thinking about adding toasted pine nuts.

Very tasty. I used ciabatta bread as it would hold up better to grilling.

Followed the recipe in detail and had a great meal. This is a keeper and easy to prepare.

I made this wonderful, simple dish for my partner and a friend and it was scrumptious! I added some grilled red bell peppers to the panini which was a nice little extra. Great for some filling warm comfort food that doesn't leave your stomach feeling heavy.

I used baby eggplant and salted and drained them just in case. Cut them in half and roasted them in the oven. Used sharp provolone cheese and toasted ciabatta bread, cooked the sandwhich in a cast iron skillet with some olive oil. It was delicious

First, I want to say that I did not follow the recipe exactly...I know some people get upset by this! I used an indoor grill for my eggplant, ciabatta bread, and only had Havarti cheese. Followed the artichoke mayo exactly and it was delish. I also added some spinach and tomato, put the sandwich together and then threw it into my panini machine. Turned out pretty darned good. The only problem was my eggplant, I should have salted and drained it first...it was a little bitter. Overall, great veggie sandwich!!
