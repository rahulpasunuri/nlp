The skewers were delicious at room temp & easy to make ahead for parties. We thought the sauce was way too tart & thin plus nobody could taste the anchovies. I'd skip it next time.

The recipe IS complete. Step number 2 says to add the rest of the ingredients to the anchovies. Please read more carefully next time.

are you serious,this recipe is not complete. What to do with the creme fraiche and the parmesan cheese. Would like it better if I had all the info.
