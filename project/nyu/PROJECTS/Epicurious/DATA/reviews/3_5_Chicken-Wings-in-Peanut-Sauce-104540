We were a bit concerned about the 500 degree oven and then additional broiling. Is this a misprint? Another review stated that it was plenty crispy just baking at 500 and someone else said this recipe set off the smoke alarm. Don't think we have enough insurance.

Yummy recipe! The sauce was thick, though. Next time I would add honey instead and more soy and fish sauce to thin it out.

I don't think I would give the recipe "as is" 4 stars, but with a few modifications, it was amazing. I used chicken thighs because I prefer how they stay more moist, as compared to wings. I added more fish sauce, more soy sauce, a bit more lime juice and a bit of lemon juice. The sauce would have certainly been too thick if I hadn't added the extra liquids. I had chili garlic sauce on hand, and added about a 1/2 teaspoon extra to the sauce. Finally, I used kraft smooth peanut butter, but I think it probably would have been even better with natural peanut butter.

this was really bland and not all that good. would probably double the sauce if I did it again. But won't be making it again so....

We make this every Sunday for football! We love wings are always experimenting with different flavors and sauces. But once we found this, it is hard to steer away from it. When I first made the sauce, I found myself wanting to add garlic and ginger to it, but I realized that they were on the wings so I wanted to try the recipe as it was stated first. It was the perfect amount of flavor! We did add some spice to the sauce, as we like them super spicy!

We have three celiacs in the family who also happen to not be able to eat soy. We eliminated the soy sauce and doubled up the fish sauce then added three heaping tablespoons of honey. The result was quite gooey but very very tasty!

This was really great! I was taking to a picnic so I used the sauce (thinned with chicken broth) for dipping instead of coating so it would be a little neater to eat.

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. It was hard to toss 4 lbs of wings with only 2 T of veg.oil. Also my sauce was very thick and not tossable and I even doubled it and added extra lime juice. Maybe Jiff p.b. would have worked out better. I used natural p.b. and all the ingredients listed in the recipe. I can't believe this recipe was tested. The amount of the ingredients just didn't jive with 4 lbs of wings!!!

Delicious! I made of the recipe and used chicken broth to thin out the sauce and the amount of the sauce was just enough to coat the chicken. Next time I will definitely make more sauce.

These were great. We devoured them. I did double the sauce, for which I'm glad. A single recipe would not have been nearly enough for 4 pounds of wings. I used homemade peanut butter and honey instead of sugar, and the sauce didn't need thinning at all. We will definitely be having these again... and this peanut sauce will find a home with other dishes, it's a very simple and delicious sauce.

The sauce was like paste. It was impossible toss the wings with it. The wings were good without sauce but I'm very disappointed with the recipe. I followed the directions and the amount of ingredients exactly. I guess I could try to add water to sauce or maybe use a peanut butter like Jiff or SKippy instead of natural peanut butter.

Since I am allergic to fish sauce, I just added a little more natural soy sauce. The wings were a big hit at our New Years Eve party and it's a recipe that's been asked for by friends.

I baked my wings at 500 for close to 30 minutes. I did not need to broil them, they were plenty crispy. I thinned the sauce with some water as suggested which helped to coat the wings. Very tasty and I will make them again. My only complaint is that my oven is now an oil-splattered mess!

Very good peanut sauce. I suggest you thin the sauce with a little water because it is to thick.

this sauce was delicious! I had regular pb on hand, so after reading the reviews omitted the extra sugar. Also I did not have fish sauce so I used 2 T soy sauce and 1 T sesame oil. I used a lot of the pepper and it was scrumptious!

Sooo good--a nice change from traditional buffalo style wings. We love it!

These were great. I made them exactly as written and did use natural peanut butter. I didn't think they were very spicy so next time I will add either some sambal or more chile flakes.

It's a great receipe. I tried it with drumsticks and I omitted the sugar and added a bit more pepper because I'm diabetic. It was a great dish. Quick and easy to make. I'd definitely make it again.

Really tasty. Used natural peanut butter, splenda instead of sugar and sambal oelek instead of the red pepper flakes. I also just cut up the lime, removed the pith and threw it pulp and all into the blender. Delish!!

This dish is amazing IF you use natural peanut butter, double the fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice and red pepper flakes. I've made these wings often and everyone always raves about them. You have to use natural peanut butter- Laura Scudder's is really good. I can only imagine how awful sugary peanut butter would be in this.

the wings were just ok and the sauce was decidedly unimpressive.

Thought the idea of chicken wings and a peanut sauce is a good one for an appetizer. After making this recipe I think it's still a great idea but not with this peanut sauce. I agree with the reviewer who said it tasted like peanut butter smeared all over the chicken. I tried to spice it up with more lemon juice and hot pepper flakes, but it didn't matter. I would recommend making a peanut sauce from a Thai dish that has more kick. This sauce just didn't do it for me.

A real fingerlicker! Might try thinning the sauce a bit next time.

I just finished making this (with double the sauce - glad I did, they are perfectly saucy), and it is awesome! Unlike the previous reviewer, I DID use natural peanut butter (what? Did you think there was no difference?!) and the final product is a delicious authentic tasting peanut sauce.

The only dish that ever triggered our smoke alarm. The peanut butter pervades this dish though I admit I didn't use natural. There was no hot spice, lime, fish or ginger flavor here at all. The sauce is really more of a creamy peanut butter paste. It honestly tasted like peanut butter smeared on chicken to us.

I've made this recipe several times for my friends and family. It's a winner every time. The wings are juicy, savory, spicy and sweet all at once - with a great crispiness from the initial broiling. Better than any wings I've ever had in a restaurant OR at a party.

I brought this dish to a bar-b-que as an appetizer and within mins, it was devoured. Be careful not to place the chicken wings to close to the top of the oven in the first 20 mins of cooking as the chicken starts burning/smoking a bit.

I tried 3 of the Epicurious recipes for chicken wings at once and this was the favorite of the three. Good safe recipe for adults and children. I agree with previous reviewers that double the sauce is a good idea-it's yummy! Also thanks to another reviewer I didn't bother to turn them over during the final broil and they were just fine. Thanks for the hints! The chicken wings with Curry-Yogurt Glaze were good too but my husband is not a curry fan... These are a safer bet to please EVERYONE.

I made several dozen of these chicken wings for a buffet party and they were so popular, it was almost embarassing. I added fresh cilantro and thinly sliced onion to the final mix, and doubled the sauce recipe. Amazing! I now make this recipe all the time for my family. I use skinless, boneless chicken thighs and serve it up over rice for dinner. Delicious!

Yum. These little guys were really easy and very tasty. I would almost certainly make again.

YUM--made these and the curry yogurt wings from Epicurous for a party--they went fast, and people fought about who got to take the left overs home. This is great and easy!

I made these wings for a cocktail party and they got eaten so fast I had people begging me to make more! My husband still can't stop raving about them. They were EASY! It took me two minutes to make the sauce- I added a little more fish sauce, lime juice, and red pepper flakes than the recipe to give it more kick, and I didn't bother to turn the wings over mid-broil. Great recipe! I would definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe a few months ago and it has quickly become a family favorite. Very easy to prepare and amenable to substitutions if you don't happen to have lime juice (lemon is fine) or fish sauce (add a touch more soy). Best when fresh but reheats well in the micro. If you're not into wings, try this and be surprised. A winner that seems to have been overlooked by other online readers so I'm putting in my vote and dashing off to prepare some to bring my daughter at her army base tomorrow.
