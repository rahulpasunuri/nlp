This is the best! Use it over and over and everyone loves it. If I don't have shallots, it's just as good!

This is a delicious vinaigrette that pairs well with the arugula. Great 5 minute simple salad. My wife loved it!!

This is a very flavorful, simple salad that I have found myself quite smitten with. I require a bit more balsamic than called for, but otherwise followed the recipe. A good dressing to have (I think we all have something similar in our repertoires but this is good) and to be honest I'm really loving a rocket salad with many of my meals these days- extra peppery and flavorful more than any of the other lettuces!

Using just one garlic clove, this is my go-to salad dressing. Sometimes I add mustard, sometimes I use white balsamic vinegar, sometimes red wine vinegar. It's so versatile. I recently bought a very expensive balsamic and can't believe the difference in taste. It's has such a different flavor and color and to me, is worth the $$. mmm!

Love this vinaigrette! My husband requested a balsamic dressing to go with greens from the farmers market, and this was exceptional. I didn't have any problems with emulsification, oiliness or separation - I agree the key is to add oil in a small stream while whisking. This will be our go-to!

This is now my go-to vinaigrette. I've used it on the arugula salad and on any green salad too. Sometimes I vary it and add a little Dijon mustard. I've made it for company and for every day--it's great!

Probably the best salad I've ever had.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party! Very easy to prepare, light and full of flavor. Everyone wanted the recipe. Like some of the other cooks, I only used one large garlic clove instead of two. I also added goat cheese. This will be added to my repertoire!

very yummy as is and even better with some crumbled goat cheese

Try making it in a mini food processor. It will emulsify beautifully. That or shaking it. This is a delicious and very garlicky dressing. Yum.

This was delicious! I love arugula and raw garlic, so this was a wonderful salad! I used chopped large tomatoes becasue that's what I had on hand.

4 forks because it is so easy and very tasty. For those of you that think it is too oily---use less oil, and whisk more.... Will make again and again.

The vinaigrette is great, just make sure to follow the recipe and beat while slowly adding the oil; otherwise, it will be too oily. I make it all the time.

Absolutely wonderful!

I adore all things balsamic, so was looking forward to this vinaigrette. But it was TERRIBLY oily; all I could taste was the oil - even the garlic and shallots were overwhelmed. So I added some lemon juice - a LOT of lemon juice - to cut the oiliness and give it some zing. I'll use the basic ingredients again, but fiddle with the proportions until it comes out the way I like it - balanced and with some distinctiveness.

Tangy. I used julienned red pepper instead of tomatoes and shaved some pecorino romano into the whole thing.

I do really think this is a great basic balsamic vinaigrette recipe - I've made it twice, though the second time I added a heaping teaspoon of dijon - SO GOOD!! I also add more carrot, but that's just me.

I just made the vinaigrette part of this recipe and thew it over some mixed baby greens and it was divine! I only used one garlic clove and the balance was just perfect: all the flavors represented with none dominating (except balsamic vinegar slightly).

This dressing was terrific! (I feel compelled to add, however, that I have a "thing" for all dressings balsamic; I cannot claim a lack of bias in this review.) The amount of garlic added just the right amount of zing. Next time I will try it on a green salad and add goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes or perhaps some caramelized red onions to add some sweetness for balance.

This salad has become a staple in my house. YUMMY!

This was soooo easy and good! I had already roasted a bunch of garlic cloves, so I used these instead of the raw cloves mentioned here. I also used the oil from the roasted garlic for this instead. The result was not too garlicky at all, and perfect over ANY salad. I also used a touch of honey, like the previous poster.

This is a great vinaigrette. The only modification I've made is to add a touch of honey, for time to time, to take the edge off. I usually reduce the garlic when I do.

I only made the dressing portion of the recipe, as I was looking for a good balsamic vinaigrette. This one hit the spot. I made it about an hour ahead of time and then strained it before serving, since I didn't want the small bits of shallot and garlic in the salad. Oh, and I agree with the cook who suggests using smaller garlic cloves - two large ones are too much.

I made the dressing with 2 large garlic cloves and the result was overpowering. I will try the dressing again with 2 small garlic cloves.

I loved this recipe! Very tasty and definitly a hit. I will make this over and over. I love garlic so I used a bit more than the recipe called for and it suited our tastes perfectly. Great summer salad for bbq's too.

So simple, yet so very tasty! I made this for Xmas with some nice pre-packaged mixed greens, tomatoes and goat cheese... everyone loved it! I have now been asked to serve it again for New Years!

Love the dressing!Try it with a bag of prewashed lettuce mix and add toasted pinenuts,golden raisins, a thinly sliced apple and some blue cheese.Delicious!

Delicious salad dressing! I also skipped the tomatoes and carrot and added toasted pine nuts and shaved parmesan cheese on the arugula. Definitely a keeper.

A great basic but wonderful salad! A must for arugula lovers...the dressing is very tasty!

I found it was especially good if I made it ahead of time and let the dressing absorb the shallot and garlic flavors. Also, I decreased the amount of oil slightly. Great recipe!

This was my Christmas Eve side salad. It was very good. I only needed about 3/4 # to serve 7 people. Very easy...

My family is not fond of the bitter flavor of arugula so I substituted Romain lettuce. Everyone loved it!

I changed the recipe slightly by not using the tomatoes, instead I topped the salad off with toasted pinenuts and shaved parmesan cheese, everyone LOVED it!

I added some feta and got rave reviews. I use this dressing all the time now.

Simple to prepare. A good reason to grow fresh arugula (if you didn't already have a reason). Add toasted pine nuts and thin shavings of parmesan or crumbled feta.
