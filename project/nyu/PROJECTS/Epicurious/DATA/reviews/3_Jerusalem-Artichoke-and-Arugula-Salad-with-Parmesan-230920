I had never had jerusalem artichokes before - found that they are crispy and pleasant but do not have a strong flavor. Made for a quick easy salad that was a bit different from what I usually have so I enjoyed it. I'd make the vinaigrette again for other purposes too.

I was excited to try sunchokes in this salad, but I found them to be completely unremarkable. They are crunchy and bland like water chestnuts. I would not go out of my way to eat them again.

Simple, tasty and a delightful might of textures. The sunchokes and orange give a light, summery feel even in early spring. Did not have arugula, so I served with the greens I had on hand.

Simple, Delicious, unique. I made this at a dinner party where the entire menu was cooked by the participants (the salad was my course) and the rest of the menu was also excellent. Served with a Chablis. Use ALL the dressing (I skimped and felt the salad suffered a bit.)

Whole Foods carries Jerusalem Artichokes fairly consistently. I have made this many times, and we love it. It's great with Italian menus.

I just bought some at Wegman's in Downingtown.

I was unable to find jerusalem artichokes(sunchokes). Without them, I don't believe this recipe would be anything special. Does anyone know where to find them in PA?
