Very flavorful. The kids liked it and I will make this again (didn't use any parsley)

Very flavorful and easy. I used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian. Goes well with a lot of flavors, a keeper.

My mom's favorite rice.

Good flavors, and easy to make. Be careful when adding the olive oil at the end-my rice came out a bit more oily than I'd like. Next time I make this I will either cut the amount of oil added at the end, or omit it entirely.

I've already made this twice. I used basmati rice, and cilantro for the flat-leafed parsley, and it was wonderful! Quick, easy, and it makes a great side dish. I would not substitute for the cumin seeds, I was afraid they would taste too strong but it was great.
