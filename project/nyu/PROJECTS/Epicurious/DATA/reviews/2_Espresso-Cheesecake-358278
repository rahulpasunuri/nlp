I am not really reviewing because I haven't made this yet. Just asking someone who has made this. Is the coffee flavor really intense? That's what I am looking for. Is it sweet enough with all that espresso in it?

I completely concur with the other reviewer about the butter. I only wish I had read that review before making it...butter city. Use 1 stick to 2 cups of cookie crumbs. I actually didn't think it tasted like a real cheesecake either. Just sort of a heavy blob. Can't say I would ever make this again.

I made this for my son and daughter in law. We loved it and it was fun to make. 2 sticks of butter is way too much in the crust however. I used 2 and 1/2 cups of crumbs and the 2 sticks was still too much. I was happy I put a pan under the cheesecake while baking because I would say about a 1/4 cup of butter dripped out. I would use 1 stick next time. I baked it for 4 hours and it was perfect.
