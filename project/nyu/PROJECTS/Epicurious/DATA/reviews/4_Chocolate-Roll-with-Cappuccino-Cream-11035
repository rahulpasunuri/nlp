This roll has been my favorite since 1987. I use the same whipped cream filling to decorate the cake, eliminating the need to make a second whipped cream mixture. It works perfectly.

I have been making this every Xmas for twenty years and it is a family and friends favourite. I did have trouble with the gelatine clumping the first time I made it. I redid the filling and while adding the gelatin in an even stream, I whisked the mixture very quickly to be sure it blended. So long as the two steps are done together, there is no problem. Hope this helps anyone trying this recipe.

This cake has been our family Christmas tradition for twenty years. Takes a little time to make, but it's not difficult at all, and the results are always wonderful. One word of advice: Don't bother with the gelatin. It NEVER works (ends up as a gummy mess that you have to fish out), and the recipe doesn't need it.

This cake tastes quite nice, but I had problems with the recipe, as written. Firstly, I baked the cake as instructed for 15 minutes but later found out it was completely raw. If you have a thicker jelly roll pan, test it with a toothpick. I baked it an additional 12 minutes and it was still extremely moist. Secondly, you don't need the gelatin. I gave it a try, but leaving it to cool 5 minutes resulted in it solidifying and left gelatin clumps in the mousse. Despite these problems, the cake tasted good, but next time I'll try a different recipe.

I've been making this recipe every year since it first appeared. It's the perfect Yule log. It's beautiful and light-tasting and delicious. Don't be daunted by the many steps. I stopped adding the gelatin to the whipped cream years ago and it's fine without. Don't forget to add the 1/4 cup of water to the melting chocolate. It's not in the ingredient list.

My family has been making this recipe for around 10 years, on birthdays & occasional holidays. It is a wonderful coffee chocolate-y indulgence.

A note for Canadians: heavy cream = whipping cream. I couldn't find instant expresso powder so I put instant coffee in the grinder to make a powder. With this method, I found the coffee flavor was way too strong, especially in the garnish. I would half the amount of coffee powder if you make this substitution. I too made the mistake of not adding the gelatin gradually, and my filling got clumpy. It still tasted fine though. I made this for New Year's eve, and everyone seemed to enjoy it, but it took too long to make and the presentation was not visually pleasing enough for me to make this again. One tip, the cake is very delicate, so I used waxed dental floss to cut it into slices which worked very well. I was able to get 16 slices and served 2 slices per person. I plated it, and put the garnish rosettes on the plate.

The cake is quite good and makes for a great presentation. Even though the recipe mentioned the cake would crack, I almost threw it out because I didn't think it was perfect. Once I added the sifted cocoa it looked great. I did have one screw up. I did not gradually add the gelatin and sugar to the cream and I couldn't get it back to the peak stage. Luckly I had extras of everything and was able to start over.

Hi, Tulsa - this is a wonderful cake, one that just doesn't need flour, still has a cake-like texture, rolled up with a delicious, fluffy filling. Try it, you'll love it as much as our guests and we did!! It's worth the effort, believe me!!

Maybe it's just me, but I can't picture this recipe at all - what type of consistency does the cake have?

I've been making this dessert to rave reviews for nearly 10 years. Although it entails several steps, none are hard, and the unique end result is worth the effot. The cake works well even when made a day ahead.

This is delicious and great when you need a recipe that has no flour in it. I must have done something wrong with the gelatin, though, because I ended up with some weird brown blobs in the cream. It was great anyway, and very impressive for company.
