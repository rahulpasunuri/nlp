This is one of the best recipes ever! I make a point of making it at least twice when pomegranates are available in the supermarket here. I make it pretty much as described, except we grill the chicken and, unless I have access to good, Middle-Eastern-style pita bread, I use whole wheat wraps warmed in the oven. Standard supermarket fare pita doesn't hold up. I also use salted pistachios, which I shell for the relish, which produces a wonderful salty/sweet combination.

I used fresh mint in the Baharat Seasoning because that's what I had. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours in the fridge and let it come to room temp before cooking it on a cast iron griddle (because that's what I have). The tahini yogurt, pomegranate relish, and chicken tasted great together! Will definitely make again.

My kind of meal! Tasty and different. Will do it again for sure!

Made this for dinner for myself and hubby last night. We both liked the chicken and the Tahini a lot. The pom. salad was good, but not amazing. We'll probably make the chicken and tahini again but skip the salad.

Really great recipe- nice blend of flavor and fantastic presentation. I assigned a 9 year old to seed the pomegranate - she had a blast and I got the ingredients I needed prepped. One of my best company meals this summer

This was delicious and surprisingly simple! I used fresh mint because I couldn't find dried, and used Trader Joe's tahini "sauce" instead of paste, which had garlic and lemon already added. The Baharat seasoning really makes the difference in this recipe! Next time I will go easy under the broiler as my chicken pieces were somewhat dry, but with the moistness of the tahini yogurt and juiciness of the pomegranate, it wasn't a problem. I think it might be nice to incorporate a vegetable on the skewers alongside the chicken, maybe eggplant or zucchini?

The Tahini yogurt and Pomegranate relish were to die for, but my chicken came out bland and a little chewy. Will do something a little different to cook the chicken next time and may try the two sides with other types of meat. Delish!!

This was one of THE BEST tasting chicken dishes ever ! My husband raved about it. A keeper!

I'm lucky enough to live in Turkey at the moment, where all of the ingredients (especially the pomegranate) were very fresh and in season. The relish was delicious and the combination of the tart and sweet pomegranate, mixed with the toasted pistachios was a great balance. I baked the chiken strips, and they were very tasty. All around, really fresh, healthy, and tasty.

I made this recipe exactly as written. Trader Joe's always has packaged pomegranate seeds available. I thought the results were fantastic. The chicken was so tender. Loved the blending of the different flavors and textures of the relish and the tahini yogurt. I will make this again.....and again.

I made a few changes to the basic recipe; used turkey breast instead of chicken (I had it on hand), left out the lemon juice in the relish (wanted it to be sweet) and served with whole grain tortillas (also on hand). We gobbled this up -- pardon the pun!

The chicken was delicious! I also loved the tahini yogurt, the pomgranate relish was not really my cup of tea but hubby liked it a lot ;-)I served it with basmati white rice and some lettuce and tomato slices and olives - yummy!!!

this was very delicious overall. I really like the chicken. I up the spices a bit, and add some aleppo to the mix. My oven wasn't working so I sauteed the whole boneless, skinless chicken thighs, caramelized some onions and added some liquid to braise the chicken. The result was a very moist, tender, and tasty chicken. I wasn't crazy about the tahini yogurt, but hubby liked it. I really liked the pomegranate relish. I added some fresh mint to that, and to me was more like a salad. Served with pita, hummus, cucumber, and sliced tomatoes. Yum.

made it on the weekend to rave reviews. Personally, the relish was not worth the time and pomegranates are getting to the end of their season. I'd suggest using Pomegranate molasses to drizzle on top of the kabobs before you serve them.

This recipe sounds delicious but I don't eat chicken. Can I substitute shrimp? Thanks!

delicious and very easy. I don't think it's that hard to get the pom seeds out, but I guess I've had a lot of practice. I do think I will back off the tahini next time, just b/c it's overpowering for me. Or maybe I'll amp up the baharat mix. But that's just tinkering. As written: totally delicious wrapped all up together in a warm pita. Served some mixed greens on the side for a perfect dinner.

Great recipe all around. Fresh cilantro would be a tasty alternative to the parsley in the relish....

This was surprisingly easy for how tasty and elegant the end product was. Followed it to a tee and everyone loved it. I bet cilantro would have worked as well. POM sells the arils at my local grocery which made it 10 times easier I'm sure.

I thought this was awesome. The tahini yoghurt I will use with lots of other things. I was a little perplexed by the pomegranate seeds though. You don't swallow them do you? Do you spit them out?

These kebabs were incredible. Lots of prep with the pomegranate - but worth it with every bite. The components compliment each other so well. I could eat the relish everyday! Oleana is one of my favorite restaurants in the Boston/Cambridge area.

I used much more of the seasoning mix than the recipe called for and am glad I did. Think would be a little bland as written. Tahini yogurt very nice. Did not do pomegranate.

I made this to entertain friends for dinner and received rave reviews from all. The tastes were delicious and different -- the pomegranate relish was a great complement to the chicken, and the generous use of fresh lemon juice set just the right spark of zestiness against the sweet tartness of the pomegranate seeds. I served it with basmati rice that had baby peas stirred in. I will definitely make this again.

I really expected this recipe to knock me out of the ballpark but it was a bust. All the seasonings, the pomegranate (liked), pistachios (too hard of a crunch competing with the softer pom); the Tahini Yogurt (no thanks); some garlic, lots of lemon, lots of money - lots of disappointment.

Everything about this dish is wonderful -- the pomegranate relish, the yogurt dressing, the baharat seasoning. Fantastic!! I served this gyro-style on good pita bread. Husband loved it. Can't wait to make it again!

Sounds wonderful....what would you recommend serving with it?

Fantastic. Local spice store makes their own baharat spice blend, used that, and went with chicken thighs instead of breasts. Lastly, used frozen pomegranate seeds... bad decision. Had never used them before, and won't again for this sort of purpose. Despite that, delicious.

fantastic recipe. the spice blend is phenomenal and the relish is outstanding! save yourself a lot of time and frustration. purchase pre-picked pomegranate seeds. trader joe's and whole foods have them. tweak the relish a bit (and turn it into a salad!) by adding a can of garbanzos, lemon zest, and chopped mint. delish!

Yum! These were terrific, not difficult, out of the ordinary. Loved the pom relish, chicken was so tender!

Tasty. A trick for those of you who see 'pomegranate arils' in the recipe and picture laboriously picking them out of the pith: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyqoeB0Wlk That guy kind of bursts a few of the arils, but it's totally possible to get them out without doing so. I prepped this and served it with the 'Israeli Couscous with Asparagus, Peas and Sugar Snaps' recipe on this site rather than with pita bread. Together they were a lot of work for your average evening meal, but they were SO good. Totally delicious, and I agree with the person who said that the relish has a lot of uses -- pistachio and pomegranate are amazingly tasty together.

I have eaten at Oleana a number of times and was excited to see this recipe. Great flavors and very easy to make. I didn't make the relish because I couldn't be bothered with the pomegranate, but it was exceptional all the same. Even my Greek husband loved it.

Rating: 4
My family loved this. I made no substitutions...followed the recipe to the letter. When we ate it however, we had 6 generous servings. I also think the relish has lots of potential uses....like adding to cottage cheese or plain yogurt for a great snack, or as a topping for toasts with cream cheese.

This was amazing. I used a random seasoning mix (more smoky, i think there is a decent amount of chili powder in it) that is very different from Baharat that I got for chicken in Palestine but it worked out very very well. I also used cilantro instead of parsley which gave a great contrast to the sweet pomegranate. All in all, it was amazing.

This was very good. I didn't have any pistachios so I substituted walnuts. I would make this again. The flavors were all great together and the pomegranate relish made it all come together nicely.
