As suggested, I reduced the star anise by a third, I think that is a good suggestion. The lamb shanks, which Ive never worked with before, were delicious although the next time I make this (and I will) I will substitute beef. I love lamb but this cut is VERY greasy and even though I skimmed the fat often, the finished product was still too greasy. Great combination of flavors and I would say to go out of your way to find the black vinegar, it really adds a lot.

We made this for Chinese New Year last night for 6 adults-including two experts in Chinese cuisine. It smelled delicious, it was easy, and our guests were reminiscing about the smells of their grandmother's kitchens! Excellent, easy, and apparently quite authentic. We did reduce the star anise, but I think we will be more adventurous next time and do exactly as is! We also made the bok choy recipe that accompanies and it was considered spot-on as well.

Made exactly as written with one exception didn't have red peppers added hot sauce....I didn't watch the weight of the shanks and my 6 Whole Foods shanks weighted only 3.5 lbs. (This is so rich it was plenty for my 6 guests). Did not have too much star anise in last nights supper, but today's left overs, wow too much... I would make this again cutting star anise quantity in half. Served it over fried chinese vermicelli. The crunch was good with the rich texture of the lamb.

I made this dish for an Iron Chef party - the secret ingredient was anise. My guests seemed to like it, but I didn't love the flavors. I made several substitutions and changes which may have influenced this: 1. I substituted goat for lamb. This worked well and I don't think it made a huge difference in the taste. 2. I used slightly more anise, garlic, and chiles. I wouldn't say that the anise was overwhelming, even with adding one more star. You could taste it but it blended well with the other flavors. The reason for my two star rating is more because of the slightly sweet, pungent flavor to the meat. I am not a fan of this flavoring. I tend to like a smokier, spicier, deeper flavor to my food. But if you like this kind of asian (chinese?) food, then you would probably like it.

Sorry - in my review a minute ago I said I had followed the recipe to the letter, but that's not true - I couldn't find black vinegar anywhere, so I used balsamic.

Let me start by saying that I am not a big lamb eater. I can't stand the smell of it cooking, so I make it very rarely. That said, this recipe intrigued me, so I gave it a try. The initial boiling of the meat helps to minimize whatever that particular smell is, so that's a plus. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I forgot the scallions at the end. It was delicious. My dinner guests all said it was delicious, but no one had seconds. So I'm giving it three forks. I might make it again, and I might try the same seasoning/braising recipe with beef.

Made this for guests this past week. It was a huge hit. I did reduce the number of star anise based on a previous review and I'm glad I did because I think more would have been overwhelming (at least for us). Also made the accompanying rice recipe. Loved it.

The broth in this recipe tastes like Chinese beef noodle soup broth. I don't think that the original recipe has too much star anise. I have made this twice using leg of lamb and both times it turned out wonderfully. Even my friends who aren't crazy about lamb liked this recipe.

This made my house smell wonderful! We'll definitely be making this again soon. I served it over white rice with sauteed pea tendrils, spooning quite a bit of broth into each bowl. I can't rave enough about this dish.

This recipe with the accompaning rice and bok choy recipes were excellent and fill the room with such fragrance.

I made this for a dinner party with a bunch of gourmet cooks and got rave reviews from all of them. I did cut the number of star anise in half, since a friend on the Mainland made it and said the licorice flavor was overpowering. With the star anise reduction it was perfect. You do have to like lamb, which we all do, but I suppose you could substitute pork. I also made the baby bok choy and my own fried rice recipe. The whole dinner was a huge hit and I was intructed by all to make it again.
