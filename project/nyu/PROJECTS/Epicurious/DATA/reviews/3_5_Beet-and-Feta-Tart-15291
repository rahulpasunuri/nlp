This was very tasty. I thought it would taste a lot like feta, but I actually mostly tasted beets, which made me happy. I definitely had to bake it for 40 minutes instead of 20. Also, I recommend crumbling your feta pretty fine. I used the already crumbled feta from trader joes, but the big chunks of feta look a little awkward hanging out on top of the tart, and they didn't really melt in.

I've served this at a few luncheon's, including a teacher's lunch at the school. Everyone was asking for the recipe. Fresh thyme really adds to the flavour. Even my seven year loves this and asks for it in his lunch! I always cook extra beets and roast them with a little olive oil, salt & pepper & a few sprigs of thyme.

Very tasty and, as mentioned by others, a playground for add-ons, seasonings, and fun tinkering. First made this 5 or six years ago and has been requested every xmas dinner since. One note - have roasted the beets, boiled the beets, used canned sliced beets- always a crow pleaser! Do more than two beets though - coming up short is a big BUMMER when you're arranging a pretty concentric spiral.

Time consuming, but overall not a difficult recipe and it yields a nice result. I agree that it is ripe for add-ons as a previous reviewer said. I added fresh herbs and garlic to the cream mixture and it turned out nice. My husband suggested next time to use some shredded chicken. I'm not so sure, but we'll try it.

Good, yet I had to cook it at least twice as long as the recipe stated. I will add an extra egg next time, as well, since it seemed a bit too creamy. I used sauteed beet greens as well, as it seemed to have room. Good, but lots of room for add-ons.

This was really wonderful and so easy. I used golden beets, which were really lovely. My husband and I compete with some friends in a Iron Chef battles, and this was one of our winning recipes for Beet Battle.

Tasty. I boiled my beets instead of roasting them, this worked fine, except it took a little longer for the tart to "set." I also used skim milk instead of cream. My only suggestion would be to increase the number of eggs (maybe to 4), the current propotion of 2 eggs to 1 cup milk seems a little runny.

made this over and over again and it's my favorite tart.

I love beets, but it's absolutely ridiculous to put the oven on for an hour just to roast two small beets. Get real.

One caveat: I don't like beets. I try to like them, but it doesn't work. This tart is beautiful (I also doubled the beets - maybe that was a mistake), but unlike the reviewer who said it doesn't matter if you have a beet aversion, I insist that it does still matter. If you like beets, this will be a wonderful recipe for you. If you do not, don't expect the magical (like I did) -- they're still beets. I also used frozen puff pastry which worked very well.

This was great. Like some of the other reviewers, I would use more beet and less of the filling. You could also add another vegetable layer if you wanted.

Whether you like beets or not, you'll like this dish. I've made it three times, and it always tastes great. I've never used the pastry recipe (just use my standard) and I've become more liberal about the beets and the cheese -- a little more than the recipe calls for is ok. Some people are put off by the color (it ends up looking pinkish), but it's delicious!

The tart is BEAUTIFUL (especially when garnished with dill) for the holidays. I just used a lot more beet--twice as much. The tart could handle it easily. Otherwise, the beet is basically food coloring for a cream and butter tart. Also, I steeped a smashed garlic clove in the cream for 20 minutes to impart some flavor. Cut into wedges and its an easy advanced-prep app. that will wow your guests. Not main course material.

I made this last night and I gave it one fork because my husband who hates beets liked it. I on the other hand love beets and would not make this recipe again. It does nothing to enhance or improve or accentuate the flavor of beets -which is why my beet hating husband probably liked it - and it was really not all that interesting. It wasn't bad, but I would rather eat my beets plain than in this tart.

this was delicious and an interesting alternative to the usual ways of preparing beets. Roasting the beets really enhanced their flavor.

My husband does not like beets very much, that is until I made this tart! He had seconds and even finish the tart the next day! A great recipe! Use good feta cheese.

My sister in law had a baby and her husband asked me to cook some things useing the veggies in their fridge, so nothing would go bad. And they had beets, which I don't like at all. So I found this recipe and gave it a shot. well they asked me to make it again the next week,then asked for the recipe. My mother in law also asked for the recipe, I guess word is getting around. I used frozen puff pastry cause that's what I had in the house.
