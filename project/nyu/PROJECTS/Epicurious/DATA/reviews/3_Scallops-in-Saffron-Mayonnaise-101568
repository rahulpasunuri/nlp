Loved this recipe -- it was a hit with my guests! I don't know what others thought was bitter; perhaps the lettuce. The leftover mayonnaise lasted for weeks and I used it many times on other fish, successfully.

I made this into a cold pasta salad that was incredible! I poured the mayonnaise over cooked thin spaghetti, added the chilled scallops, chives and julliened carrots. It was even better the next day and was not as bitter, so I recommend chilling as long as possible ahead of serving.

I agree, it was really bitter, like there was too much of something. I usually like saffron so I don't think it was the problem. It did not taste fresh like I would want with fish.

I thought that that mayonnaise was the bitterest I have ever tasted. Even my dog wouldn't eat it! Thank God I tasted it before I ruined the scallops! I am not used to cooking with saffron, but if that is the flavor it lends, I can save lots of money and eschew this spice. Could I have had a bad batch of saffron? It was a brand new bottle from the store... Is saffron an acquired taste? I don't know. I'm a great cook, but this was not great mayonnaise.
