This is a delicious recipe that is "original" and yields a fabulous presentation. I followed the recipe exactly only I piped the mascarpone into the whole, cored pears just before serving. I poured some of the raspberry sauce onto a glass pedestal dish with a lip and placed the pears standing up in the sauce. I also put the mint leaves near the stem so it resembled a pear on the tree. When cut into, the mascarpone was a nice surprise to bite into. Extra raspberry sauce was served on the side. My guests loved it. Highly recommend--I've made it twice.

I made this for Valentine's Day. For two, I cut the poaching liquids and sauce in half, and used two pears. We also used carambola (a brie-gorgonzola blend) for a little "kick" instead of the sweet mascarpone. Don't add the sugar or flavoring to the carambola cheese if substituting. We liked it so much that I used the leftover poaching liquid to poach more pears the next night!

I like desserts I can make a day ahead. This worked perfectly. It's light, presents well, but you need a knife as well as a fork to eat it. The women loved it. The men would have liked something more substantial.

Wow is all I can say. My guests said far more (not enough room to write). I did it as part of a traditional turkey dinner. Perfect compliment. The pears were just right and the marscapone ran out everyone loved it so much.

Since other reviewers commented on the length of time it took to poach the pears, I cut them in half and cored them, then poached them. To plate the dish, I made lenghtwise slices in the halves and fanned them out on the plate, places a few melon-ball-sized scoops of the mascarpone (delicious!) alongside, topped with a mint sprig, and drizzled the raspberry sauce over the plate. The guests were impressed, and liked the lightness of the dessert after a heavier meal.

Excellent and sophisticated. Can be made and even set out ahead of time and is well suited for formal dinners. My crowd loved it at Easter. I piped a ring of the mascarpone cream around the pears and decorated the plates with chopped toffeed almonds.

I served this last weekend and everybody was impressed with the way it looked and tasted. Very easy to prepare and you can make one day ahead. The sauce was just excellent. YOu could use it for anything that requires raspberry sauce. I saved the poaching syrup for tonight. I think it will be excellent sauce for sauteed foie gras which I will try tonight.

We served these at a small Christmas party and everybody loved them. Very impressive presentation and absolutely delicious!! Takes a bit of time to peel and core the pears.
