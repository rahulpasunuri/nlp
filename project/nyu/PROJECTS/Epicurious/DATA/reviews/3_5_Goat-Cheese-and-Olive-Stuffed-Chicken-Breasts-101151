This was VERY good. I didn't tell my husband what the stuffing consisted of b/c he wouldn't have tried it, but... he loved it! I added some chopped walnuts and a few tablespoons of whipped cream cheese to mellow the goat cheese. Also, it was a hot day when I made this so instead of staring the oven, I finished it on the grill. The smokiness really added alot. I'll definitely make this again!

I whipped this up tonight because I happened to have goat cheese (w/ chives), chicken breasts, and olives on-hand. Delicious and so easy!

THis is so easy to make and yet yields such flavorful results! It will definitely go into my regular menu cycle at home.

This is a four-forker with the olives chopped into more or less a brunoise, the addition of the relatively pedestrian stuffed Spanish olive (adds color and saltiness, again s/b finely chopped), add some chopped (very fine) toasted pecan or toasted walnuts -combine these additions with the chevre to make a chunky paste and stuff the cavity pretty full. Could throw in some chives for cliche's sake or get the herbed goat cheese in the first place and just add the brunoised olives. The pockets should be lightly salted and peppered. Otherwise, cooking the breasts is a classic 'sear and finish in the oven' preparation. The sear has to be done well with a nice, even Maillard reaction on both sides of the breast. This dish really depends on it. It wouldn't be out of the question for the home cook to have two fry/saute pans going to get that initial hot burst of heat on both sides. The second-side searing suffers in quality on most home ranges because the burners are not strong enough the keep the pan from cycling. Cranking the heat up while the breast languishes on the second side can result in steaming instead of the necessary burst of heat when protein hits properly heated pan.

I loved this. I added a small amount of lemon zest to the cheese & olives. I couldn't find fresh thyme, so i used dried. It turned out absolutely delicious.

I made this recipe tonight. I have to say it made me join this website and give this review. I used most of the suggestions mentioned in the reviews. I added garlic, rosemary, thyme, basil, and olives to my goat cheese. I did cut the chicken differently than described by mistake, but turned out fine. This recipe was easy and awesome!

I've been making this dish for years, it is a regular at my house. Only difference is we always use skinless chicken breasts and since the ones used are on the large side, have to cook them longer. Another recipe similar on this site is Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Goat Cheese and Basil. That recipe calls to cook the chicken at 350 or 20 minutes. I do this and it turns out perfect, with the juices sealed in from the previous searing. Occasionally I go crazy with adding a lot of the stuffing and end up having to tie it with kitchen string but it still turns out great. Perfect arrangement of flavors with the katamala olives and goat cheese!

I thought this was ok, but fiance thought it was good. I had high hopes for this one, but something was missing. The only thing I did differently was pound the chicken so it was even as suggested and cooked it all the way through on the stove not the oven. I can't imagine that would have made that much of a difference in taste.

This recipe is fantstic, I breaded and unbreaded the chicken breasts both workedwell. Very flavourful, sweet cheese, and saltly olives mmm! capers are great in this dish. some garlic helps too! the stuffing keeps the bls/sknles breasts very moist, just don't over cook. Pound chicken so it is even before stuffing, this will allow for even cooking that takes less time, and prevents spillage. if chicken is uneven in size part of it will cook faster leeking out the cheese, well the other part is raw. if it's even and cheese start to melt take it out immiediately! ppl over cook chix Way too much thats why it's dry. mix up the cheeses, different kinds of olives, or even replace with shittakis, proscutto. one reciepe millions of wonderful variations.

I just love kalamata olives. I think I put a few too many in, it ended up a bit salty. I think I would eliminate any salting of any of the rest of the dish. This was fabulous! Next time I'll use small breasts so we can enjoy the cheese/olive mixture.

I made just a couple of small adjustments to this and it turned out to be a home run. I breaded the chicken breasts (bls/skls) and used some butter in the pan. I also added some fresh rosemary and basil to the mix. I always brine my chicken beforehand. This was nothing short of fantastic.

this dish is crazy good! rehydrate your dried tomatoes with red wine before using them to stuff the chicken. then use the wine that's left to deglaze the pan like "A cook from Chicago" did! that cook knows that they are talking about! skinless breasts make the meat bland. either heavily season a skinless breast or just use a breat with the skin still on it.

This was an excellent meal, very satisfying. The olives and goat cheese go great together. The only thing I did that wasnt in the recipe, was I used skinless chicken breasts and breaded them. Need to be careful not to burn the breading in that case. It worked, though.

Really easy and very tasty, used Boursin cheese instead of goat and wrapped in thin slice of prosciutto as we are not big olive fans. We tried the sauce suggestion from a review on the site and it was really an easy and very flavorful dish that we could make on a weekenight.

Whaddya mean, bland???? I make this at least once a month - it's incredibly easy, and such a crowd pleaser! Try adding sun-dried tomatoes to the mix for both color and flavor, and deglaze the pan with RED wine...the sauce goes great over couscous!

My husband and I thought this was delicious. It came out moist with alot of flavor. I used the herb flavored goat cheese and Kalamata olives. The cooks who complained there was no flavor must have used the wrong olives or something. We thought it was great and easy enough for a week night dinner.

This was good and easy. I'd definitely make again on a week night. I think some kind of Mediterranean type of side dish would go well with it, like pasta with vegetables.

Very simple to make and great taste. I was surprised by the number of "bland" and "not much flavor" comments; the filling was wonderful! I'll definitely be making this one again.

I thought this was pretty good, although I'd pound the chicken breasts to be thinner to allow the olive and cheese mixture to flavor the dish better. Not amazing, but a pretty decent dish.

I finally made this recipe for the first time last night. Both myself and my boyfriend (a meat and potatoes guy) thought it was fabulous! I also had a little leakage, but nothing too excessive, and I made too much stuffing. I used skinless chicken (all I had in the freezer), so 15 minutes was too long to bake it. Next time I'll remove it sooner or use skin-on chicken. And yes, there'll definitely be a next time!

I used tapenade in place of the olives, and skinless breasts. There just wasn't much flavor to this dish--I really think it needs the skin on to add flavor and moistness. Nothing special.

I thought it was great. The chicken breasts I bought were large so it took about 30 minutes in the oven. I also used about twice as much goast cheese as called for. I will definitely make this one again. Very Easy and fast!

Chicken was okay, the filling was not exciting at all and I love goat cheese. Not worth the trouble.

This dish was awesome. To make my life a little easier, after stuffing the chicken, I just breaded them a little and put them in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes. The chicken was moist and flavorful. And it was soooooooo easy!!! I'm definately going to make this again.

Rating: 2
Very simple to make. Tastes exactly what you'd expect it to taste like: chicken, goat cheese, olives. I found that the chicken got a bit rubbery cooking it the amount suggested here, so if I did make it again, I'd take it out of the oven much sooner. Pleasant, easy, but not terribly exciting.

I've never been so entertained reading other cooks' comments. The Chicago cook whose meat-eating husband isn't a "goat cheese kind of guy" could have been me. I'm going to try this on my husband, who has the palate of a cave man, to see if he likes it.

This dish has rich, textured and exqisite flavors. I used 3 types of goat cheese and sprinkled some blue cheese on top before baking and have received rave compliments from my guests. I suggest a "cook from New York" prepare it BEFORE the chicken turns green...this would probably eliminate the "crapola" taste. Of course, you could always stick to corn dogs.

I'm sorry. I haven't tried this recipe and I'm not rating it, but I can't stop myself from commenting on the previous comments...Having made many dishes that resembled "sauteed crapola", I think that phrase is an accurate and rather funny food description and definitely not limited to McDonalds fare. To that well-bred reviewer who scorns fast food, please remove the stick from your ass.

I have made this recipe over and over again... It is DELISH. I also use white wine to deglaze the pan. The only pain in the @ss is de-boning the chicken breasts since I cannot find skin-on boneless chicken breasts anywhere that I live...

I'm glad I tried this, though I had some spillage from the pockets. Next time I might sautee the breasts in butter rather than oil, and pour the butter over the chicken in the oven.

Since the cook from New York is so obviously well-aquainted with "sauteed crapola" we can hardly consider the review a valid one. Next time, restrict your more gourmet experiences to something within your range of appeciation, I'm sure that MacDonalds will provide you with a customer appeciation award if you do.

This was the most disgusting concoction I have ever seen; or tasted. It looked gross; smelled worse, and tasted like "sauteed crapola". YUCK!

This was awsome. The only thing I changed was that I added some of the white wine we were drinking to deglaze the pan. I served it with sun-dried tomato risotto (also found on this site) as well a sauteed french green beans.

I used basil instead of thyme, and added some grated asagio and olive oil to the goat cheese mixture. I thought it was absolutey fabulous.

Absolutely wonderful. Although, I must admit I find it impossible to follow a recipe. I added a few more olives and first sauteed the skinless chicken breasts after they were stuffed in browned butter. I then made a reduction of the pan juices and deglazed with balsamic vinegar and richened it with heavy cream. Served with basmati rice and a Greco-ceasar salad, and a light Merlot. FANTASTIC!

The olives overpowered this dish and I found it to be too dry. I LOVE greek olives and goat cheese, however, I doubt I would make this again.

I removed the skin and used it to cover the pocket & searinging it to the chicken meat, toseal in the cheese mixture. The final product was exciting, very moist meat with a very interesting filling.

I got a "You know, I'm not that crazy about goat cheese..." when we sat down, and later a "Boy, you can make that again!" from my husband, Mr. Red Meat Eater. Very easy and mighty tasty!

I like this recipe because it is fancy, fast and deee-lish. You can usually find soft goat cheese that already has herbs in it, which eliminates one more step. A great dish for last minute dinner party.

This recipe was sooooo delicious! It was easy to make and browning the breasts and then placing them in the oven made the chicken tender and juicy. This time I used goat cheese with herbs in addition to the fresh thyme and it was excellent. I think next time I may try another kind of cheese just to see what happens but I really had a great meal thanks to your recipe. Thanks!

I made this dish for a dinner I was preparing for my Grandmother and Aunt while I was visiting recently. The flavour was wonderful, and even in an unfamiliar kitchen this was easy to prepare. I would definitely make this again and my grandmother asked me to send her the recipe !
