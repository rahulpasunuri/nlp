We made this dish for an Irish Food night at our Gourmet club. I doctored it slightly by adding around 2 cloves of garlic for the amount of vegatables here. It was absolutely delicious. Most everyone had more than one helping.I was fortunate to have organic and local root vegatables, which I think was important to the flavor of the dish. Given it's minimalist approach, the quality of the veggies makes a big difference. We will definitely be making it again and it will probably become a Thanksgiving staple, replacing the less interesting mashed potatoes.

This really takes me back to Ireland. The first "dinner" we were invited to had all of the vegetable dishes mashed ... mashed potatos, mashed carrots, mashed swedes!! It is really very good, just different from what most Americans may be used to. Combinations like this are really very good, and interesting variations on the usual mashed potatos.
