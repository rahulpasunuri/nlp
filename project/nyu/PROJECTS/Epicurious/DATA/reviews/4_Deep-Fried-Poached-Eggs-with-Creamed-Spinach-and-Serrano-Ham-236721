Chose to serve this with an arugula salad (with lemon vinaigrette) and some normal bacon but fried the egg per the directions--so easy, sooo tasty! will totally make this again, sometime with the creamed spinach.

This is a fantastic dish. Although, I must say that my boyfriend and I reserve it for when we've both had 2 weeks of A+ gym attendance! I make it with bacon, for cost and ease, and serve with whole wheat toast. This way is a little more rustic, but still amazing. The eggs are definitely worth the effort!

This dish was amazing to prepare, looked amazing on the plate, and tasted fantastic. My guests were screaming, they loved it so much. As an accompaniment, rather than make home fries or something (simply not elegant enough, I served asparagus mimosa. It was a memorable brunch neither I nor my guests will soon forget.

Wow this is a special occasion dish. Once you start you realise how fiddly it is especially the coating of the eggs. Worth it though (ignore your arteries you can always make the spinach without the cream) The plated food looked great; green and honey however the best part was when you cut open the egg and the yolk was still runny (just the way I like it) what a taste AND texture combination. Wonderful. Will be making this for a very special brunch again.
