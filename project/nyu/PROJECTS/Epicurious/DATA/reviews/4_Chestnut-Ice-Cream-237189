I have made my own for 20 years using the Clement Faugion sweetened chestnut puree and candied chestnuts from Williams-Sonoma along with a dose of Planters dark rum. This looks very similar, though less sweet. It should be sensational.

This is a really good chestnut ice cream. Since I have a hard time finding chestnuts when I want to make this, I use the puree found at better stores. It's sweetened to I reduce the amount of sugar, but it comes out so wonderful. This is great served with a light sprinkle of chopped candied bacon (recipe also found on epicurious).

I've made the chestnut Ice Cream with Chocolate Grand Marnier sauce from Gourmet, November 2000. It is an excellent ice cream and I've made it with frozen chestnuts from Trader Joe's and also bottled chestnuts, both with great results. I don't think I'll try this recipe as 3 Tb os chestnut puree seems insufficient. The other recipe also uses brown sugar. The icecream is so good that I no longer bother making the sauce.
