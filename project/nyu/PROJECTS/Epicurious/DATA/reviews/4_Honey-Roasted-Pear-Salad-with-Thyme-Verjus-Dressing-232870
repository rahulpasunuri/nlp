Loved this -- I used walnut oil instead of grapeseed because that is what I had -- and I used walnuts in the salad as well. Used the grape juice/cider vinegar option. Loved it!

The real key to this recipe is using the best quality of pears. I have make this recipe many times and it is always a big hit. A beautiful presentation with supurb flavor!

I have been going through old recipes of mine, and found this one printed from years ago tucked away in my cabinet between a cold carrot soup and risotto recipe. It's funny how you remember the recipe when it is put in context of others you were making at the time. Anyway, I re- read my notes that I jotted down on the paper and here they are: this was really good, even if it required a little more prep than I like for a simple salad. I said "worth it". I remember, too, being disappointed that my pears were bruised, as their symmetry and flawlessness are somewhat integral to the presentation of the salad. No one wants to have a lovely spread of greens and bright cheese and toasted nuts next to a fan of pears that look like they were thrown around the kitchen first. Anyway - this was lovely, and I would make it for entertaining more than I would for just my boyfriend and myself. I made it early on in our "dating career" when impressing him with my culinary prowess in the kitchen was more important to me than getting something on the table quickly... Now, he'll have to settle for seeing this pretty dish if we have friends come over :)

I really wanted a fresh after Christmas meal and thought a nice pear salad would do the trick...wow! My husband and I both loved the salad! The pears were divine and I did not have the same problems as another reviewer had mentioned about the pears being mushy...ours were perfect! Gorgeous presentation! We did change the vinaigrette to what we had on hand...simply divine!

This is a very versatile recipe. I've prepared it according to the recipe and it came out great. I've also altered it by using blue agave instead of honey and sherry vinegar instead of verjus. Again...delicious.

I didn't care for the texture of the pear (they were pretty near perfectly ripe and cooking the proscribed amount of time mad them mushy). I also think it should have been served warm not at room temperature. I will not make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I couldn't find verjus so I did the substition and it was still fantastic. Made it for a group of "foodies" for Christmas Eve and everyone raved. The pears themselves would be good enough to eat alone as a light dessert.

I will not rate this recipe as I made a few changes. I do feel that this recipe is quite forgiving in that area. I could not find verjus so I used a Muscatel vinegar. The honey disappeared from the cabinet so I used blue agave sweetener (I believe honey would have added more depth)and I don't care for hazelnuts so I used pecan. All that being said, it was a delicious salad. Do not be tempted to sweeten the dressing, the honey (or in my case agave) will offset the tartness.

I made this last night for a small dinner party. At first, I thought the vinaigrette might be lacking, but it went beautifully with the pears and the sharp cheese. It went very nicely with the BC Gewurtz we had and the pork tenderloin that followed. I'd make it again, especially since the presentation was wonderful.

I made just the pears for dessert and served with vanilla ice cream. Delicious! Also, I used thyme stems to separate the pear slices so more honey would drizzle between the layers. Yum!

This has become a "go to" Elegant presentation - delicious to eat - easy to make. What more can you ask.

Awesome and easy - a big hit with my Gourmet Club - Hardest part is cutting the pears to fan out.

I made the entire dinner menu this was part of and it was fablulous, especially this salad. Elegant, easy to make ahead of time, and delicious.

It has become an entertaining go-to recipe. It's great for dinner parties as it makes for a fancy presentation but is easy to prepare and even assemble ahead of time. The dressing alone is 4 forks.

Beautiful presentation. Used the cider vinegar and frozen white grape juice concentrate (did not dilute)for a lovely light dressing. 15 minutes was just right as long as the pears are not too ripe. Used slices of maytag blue. Guests loved his dish. Cutting the pears at an angle was a great tip.

This is editted to add from my previous review... A note on cutting the pears: To get the pears to fan out beautifully, cut them on a slight angle when you are making your slits. If you cut with your knife perpendicular to the cutting board, you will not be able to fan the slices well. Good luck and enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe! I didn't have the verjus, so did the white grape juice/apple cider vinegar substitution and it was still very good. The dressing is probably not one I would use on any other salad, but it paired so nicely with the roasted pears (which were amazing) and the maytag blue cheese we used. This makes for a very delicious and elegant dish with a gorgeous presentation. I will definitely file this recipe away to my "bag of tricks" whenever I need an impressive salad course.

This was wonderful, if a bit of work. My local store was out of thyme, so I used basil to bake the pears, which was actually really good. I also didn't want to bother with the fancy oil and vinegar for the dressing, so I just did apple cider vinegar and olive oil, which was fine. Finally, I couldn't find hazelnuts, so I used walnuts, instead.

Wow! What an outstanding and unusual combination of flavors, with great visual appeal .. and easy to boot! I made this for my husband and I on a whim tonight and made several substitutions based on what I had on hand: I used Bosc pears rather than Bartlett, dried thyme rather than fresh (simply sprinkling it on the baking sheet before placing the pears on it), purple grape juice rather than white, toasted walnuts instead of toasted hazelnuts, and baby spinach rather than arugula. I used slices of Saga Blue. I also added just a smidgen of honey to the salad dressing. Obviously, the recipe is very flexible, because this was terrific!! One of the best salads I've made. I can't wait to serve it to guests! Very, very impressive. I'll be making this often.

Rave reviews--have already given this recipe to three people. Changed a bit. Market had no Barlett pears, so I used Bosc. The 15 min. cooking time was perfect. I also used goat cheese and just used a homemade sherry vinaigrette. One of my favorite salads.

Rave reviews all around. This was by far one of the best pear salad recipes I've made. I will definitely keep this as a standard. I didn't end up using the three bunches of thyme while roasting the pears, but still ended up with a very nice infusion of thyme with what I did use. Don't pass this up!

This salad is wonderful and has quickly become a favorite. The combination of greens, fruit, nut and cheese in a salad always gets my attention -- and the toasted hazelnuts are a nice "regional" touch here in Oregon. It took me a few tries to get the hang of cutting the pears just right, but the gorgeous visual presentation is worth it. I use the dressing sparingly as I personally prefer a lighter coverage, but the flavor is sublime. This salad would lend itself to some variations -- for example, I've used "cousin" cheeses with good effect, including Gorgonzola and Stilton.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit. I tried mightily but in vain to find the verjus, so used the grape juice/cider vinegar, and it worked just fine. I used a Maytag blue cheese which was perfect. I agree with the other reviewers that less roasting time would work for the pears.

Great presentation for a fairly simple dish. I have made it several times. Keep an eye on the pears, they don't need to stay in the oven as long as called for. Also, not being a blue cheese family, I substituted Cowgirl Creamery's Mt. Tam (triple cream) cheese.

I couldn't find the verjus so used the alternate. Great presentation and good combination of flavor. I liked using a slice of blue cheese instead of crumbles.

Awesome. We don't normally...hmmm...appreciate blue cheese, but, when in eaten in combination with the pear and greens, found it to be the perfect finishing flavour.

I thought this was a really great recipe. I used the grape juice and vinegar and it was wonderful. Next time I would bake the pears a little less than 15mins. They were a just a tad too soft, but tasted great. Give this a try, you won't be dissappointed.

I thought this recipe was really wonderful, and it tasted as great as I thought it looked in the magazine. I used the grape juice and vinegar and would do it again. Really great reviews from my dinner party. I will definitly make this again and again. Give it a try.
