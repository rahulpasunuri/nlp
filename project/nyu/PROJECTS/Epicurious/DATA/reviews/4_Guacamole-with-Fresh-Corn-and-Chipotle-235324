This is an excellent recipe! We grill the corn but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. Its really one of the best guacamole I have tried.

I have to agree about the whole can of chilies, next time i am going gut that way back...but the flavors are good. I will modify it ext time.

Great guacamole. A comment to cook from Santa Cruz and for anyone thinking about making this recipe. It calls for one chipotle pepper not the whole can. I believe that is why it was too hot. I see this mistake made often when I read reviewers comments about a recipe being too hot from the chipotle.

I loved the play between the sweet corn, sour cream, and spicy chipolte. very good guacamole. I like mine smooth and creamy so i mashed it a bit more. delicious.

Excellent! Liked the chunks rather than creamy texture, and the flavor of the fresh corn.

I make this recipe all the time and it's really adaptable. It's delicious as is but it lends itself well to additions and substitutions. For instance, I bought all the ingredients one time but was running really late. I never added the corn, tomato, and onion, but added finely chopped bell peppers (because they were already chopped - left over from dh's salad). I also added cilantro and garlic because I love those two ingredients :) Oh, one more important thing: I prefer to add roasted corn to this gauc as opposed to fresh. It adds a smokey flavor that compliments the chipotle. If I want a little crunch to make up for the lack of fresh corn, I'll add some finely chopped bell pepper (I finely chop it because I find it adds too much sweetness in large chunks). Roasted corn is available at trader joes, but I've often defrosted frozen corn and roasted it dry in cast iron skillet to achieve a similar taste.

This dip is awesome. I'm not a fan of corn so I left it out, but the flavors are still excellent. The only downside is that it doesn't make very much for a big party, so I doubled everything in the recipe except the sour cream, and also added two minced gloves of garlic. Perfect!

Prepared for a superbowl party. Easy and very good. I used two of the chipotle peppers and it still was not terribly spicy.

Super delish, LOVED the corn - added some great texture. Only problem - didn't make enough. I'll double next time.

Really nice flavors and certainly very easy. Next time I'll back off the sour cream a bit and will not mash the avocado but will dice instead. Used half can of shoepeg corn because that's what I had and two chipotles because we like heat. Also added some garlic salt. To callrcg from Santa Cruz: the recipe calls for ONE chipotle (that is canned), not one whole can. No wonder everyone thought it was hot with half a can - I'm sweating just thinking about that!

I made this for a party recently, but I skipped the corn and used a tablespoon of chipotle pepper powder since I already had some, in lieu of the canned peppers. It was awesome, everyone enjoyed it!

This is one of the best guacamole recipes I've ever tried. Served it at a Superbowl party and it was gone in a flash. The *one* chipotle pepper in adobo adds a great smoky spice. Can prevent the dip from turning brown by making sure the plastic wrap sticks directly to the dip.

Would never make this again. Only added half a can of chipotle and it was still too hot for anyone to eat. Also did not like the flavor added with the sour cream.

This is a fabulous guacamole recipe - best I've ever had! The corn is what makes it! I add a little fresh garlic, use serrano chiles instead of the canned stuff (canned makes it a little watery) and a little less sour cream (low fat) -- and it turns out great every time! Always a favorite at a party or cookout!

Who can get fresh corn at this time of year? Certainly not most of the country.

I'm gonna be the wet blanket on this one. I made it and there is just something horribly wrong with guacamole with corn and sour cream. Maybe I'm just too much of a purist. Signed, Avocado Grower in California.

This is one of my favorite party dips. Even people who normally dislike guacamole love it. Its best served with pita bread, chunked, and then baked to a golden chip. YUM! I should note that I used key limes to give it a more acidic tang. I also tried it with natural yogurt instead of sour cream. The yogurt was good, but gave it a thinner consistency.

Excellent guacamole! The base recipe is a bit thick so try using more sour cream and lime juice. Leave the canned chipotle on the shelf - dice in a serrano for some kick. Roasted corn adds a big boost of flavor.

Totally agree with the other reviews here. Every time I make this, people say it is the best guacamole they have ever had (and I totally agree!). I use red onion instead of green, double the tomato and use a bit more sour cream (reduced fat) and chipotle. The recipe is a great base recipe that can be tweaked for individual preferences. I always include the corn, but often put it in the broiler for 10 minutes if I'm feeling too lazy to fire up the grill. I often offer to make the apps for parties just so I can have some of this guac!

Every time I make this, someone says it's the best guacamole they've ever had, and I agree! I grill the corn directly on grate over charcoal before cutting it off the cob and adding it to recipe (I am a "smokey" flavor addict!) YUM!

Excellent. Followed the recipe as written...even better the next day. (although the color was off) Will definately make again.

One of the best guac recipes ever. I've made this several times with/without the corn. Normally add a bit more lime juice and always throw in a clove or two of minced garlic. This is the best starter recipe for guacamole ever. Every time I've made it, at least one person has said that this is the best guacamole they've ever had.

Best quacamole recipe ever. No changes to recipe, grilled corn adds fabulous flavor. Everybody raves.

this is my all time fav guac recipe - i warn you, if you make it, you might be dissatisfied with guacamole for the rest of your life bc it will never be as good as this recipe! i make the recipe as is, but don't use the sour cream, and it tastes great.

Very creamy with the sour cream added. I added garlic which I think is a must for good guacamole. I wasn't sure whether to cook the ear of corn first, but it tasted great in there raw.

Very nice guac recipe. I didn't use the sour cream and had to use powdered chipotle. Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was great. Do not even need the sour cream. I had 3 people that said they did not like guacamole but loved this. The key is really fresh Avacadosand fresh corn from cob. I will make this all summer for sure.

This is a great recipe with a few minor adjustments. I add cilantro and a clove of finely minced garlic, plus some salt and pepper to the mix. I always substitute strained greek yogurt for sour cream (less fat), no one ever notices!

I wasn't as enthralled with this particular guacamole recipe as others were. It was okay; I believe the sour cream made the flavor more bland. I recommend omitting it.

I make guacamole several times a year and this was a new recipe for me. This went over very well and everyone loved the addition of the corn and the chipotle peppers. The only chipotle peppers I could find were in adobo sauce, but that worked well because it provided a smokier and spicier flavor than if the chipotle was not in a sauce. I will use this as my default guacamole recipe from now on.

Really tasty. They only thing I changed was to use frozen corn which I roasted on an iron skillet. My guests raved!

This was the best! The addition of the corn really adds to the guac, and the chipotle gives it just enough kick. Easy to make and tastes delicious...a winning combination.

Outstanding! If our dinner guests weren't so polite, they would've fought to lick the serving bowl. I usually don't care for "novelty" guac, but this one is now in my permanent repertoire.

Loved this guacamole. Perfect for this time of year with all the yummy sweet corn in season. The fresh corn adds a nice crunch and the smoky chipotle flavor is great. Easy to make, too! Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

Tripled the recipe for a potluck BBQ and they couldn't get enough of it! It was definitely a hit and the bowl was totally empty! I added salt, pepper and about a quarter of a teaspoon of garlic powder. I also added some of the adobo sauce from the chipotle (to taste)and it gave it a great smokey flavor. I didn't have time to get fresh corn so I used a small can of shoepeg corn. This is a party pleasing recipe.

What a nice twist! Didn't taste like guac at all, but a delicious, creamy dip nonetheless.

Crazy good recipe! I have made at least a gallon of this stuff since magazine was delivered a few weeks ago!Try grilling the corn on the cob before cutting off kernels, for another level of smoky flavor. Definately needs salt, and an extra chipotle will give some serious kick! (Test it first!) When avocados are too expensive, try using black beans instead, and throw in some cumin and cilantro.
