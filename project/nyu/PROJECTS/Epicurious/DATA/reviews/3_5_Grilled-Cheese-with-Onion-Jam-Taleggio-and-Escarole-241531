Good! Had to use Fontaine, and although it didn't overwhelm the sandwich, the fig spread was a bit sweet. Would spread very thinly next time. Used baby spinach instead...well received!

Delicious! Even my 16 month couldn't get enough of this sandwich.

I have made this sandwich several times and would make it even more often if I could consistently get escarole at the farmer's market. I've made it with the fig jam, which is amazing, and have served it with soup for an easy dinner. My favorite grilled cheese ever!!

I really enjoyed the twist on a grilled cheese sandwich. The onion jam was delicious when paired with the taleggio. We substituted spinach for the escarole and added some bacon. A perfect, easy dinner for rainy evening.

This is a keeper. Easy, yummy, however it is naughty. Cheese, oil, sourdough? I used Fontina and spinach. Delicious. I'll try adding meat next time.

Very easy to make. Go as light as you can brushing on the olive oil. A little soggy if not careful. I also added sliced deli ham to make it a bit more substantial.

What a delightful "adult" grilled cheese sandwich. The Taleggio is a must..the alternative Fontina mentioned is a poor substitute. The escarole added some nice bite to compliment the onion jam. I really like the idea of using this recipe as an appitizer, thanks cook from Los Angles. As for the cook from Philadelphia..take a chill pill and quit pickin' on tmgabler..she was just following the suggestion in the recipe.

janran I think it must be a typo 2-4 oz. is decadent enough. (An average slice is 1 oz.)

Isn't 12 - 14 ounces of cheese way too much for 2 sandwiches?

We loved this sandwich! The recipe said that Fontina was an alternative to Teleggio, and Fontina is what we used. To my surprise, my grocery store had great onion jam from Boar's Head, near the deli counter. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to use soft butter instead of olive oil to coat the bread. This would also make a nice appetizer for company if you cut the bread into small squares or diamonds. Devine with a glass of wine.

I found this sandwich to be a nice balanace of flavors. Sourdough stands up well to the Teleggio. I do not understand the 2 fork rating below at all. This would be a very weak sandwich with Fontina Cheese.

We used Fontina and found it not strong enough to stand up to the rest of the sandwich. We did enjoy the addition of escarole and I will certainly use that again but might use a stronger cheese.
