easy to burn, but once you get the technique down it's DELICIOUS!

This recipe is quite good and I'd definitely make it again. However, it is a bit on the sweet side. It wouldn't hurt to cut back a little bit on the sugar.

Deliciously decadent breakfast! Because coordinating 2 skillets seemed like a bit of a chore I used my large griddle (350 degrees), 4 minutes each side. They came out slightly crispy on the outside with a warm custardy center. I used brioche I had made (Dorie Greenspan's recipe) sliced 1 inch thick and "dried out" overnight. This is not an everyday breakfast but I am looking forward to any excuse to make it again!

My girlfriend just made this for me and WOW! This has to be the best french toast I've ever had! The only deviation from the recipe was not using fresh berries for the sauce. Instead, we thawed a variety of frozen berries in a saucepan over medium-low heat with 2 T of sugar. Once this started to liquify, we added 1 T of arrowroot to thicken the sauce. It was great! Of course we're now done breakfast and sitting at the kitchen table in a sugar-induced coma! A truly wonderful way to spend a Sat morning! Just like my girlfriend, this one's a keeper.

Tasty recipe buy you can easily cut back on the butter - deep fried toast isn't necessary to enjoy this.

When making this recipe it smelled like we were making cinnamon rolls. However, when we ate the meal our expectations were far from met. Needless to say, it did not taste anywhere near as good as its smell.

Just made it for breakfast and enjoyed it! It's a tad too sweet for my taste, but then DH loved it. I used blackberries instead (had it in the fridge), so the tartness was a good offset to the sweetness. Paired it with some Aidell's turkey and chicken sausages and Ritual coffee. Yum!

Quite delicious! I used some semi-stale hawaiian bread as I needed to use it up before it was too late. Fantastic! We tried it both without Maple syrup and with. I highly recommend a super light drizzle of some Grade B (stronger maple flavor) Maple Syrup. That hint of maple flavor is very complimentary to the french toast's light cinnamon/nutmeg flavor. The crunch that the caramelized brown sugar gives it is sinful! I used an electric non-stick griddle turned to 325 degrees F. Worked perfectly. Just don't forget to keep an eye on them so the brown sugar doesn't over-cook.

Easy to prepare. Had it cooked and eaten in a half hour. Used regular white sliced bread, as I had a feeling with all that brown sugar it was gonna burn on outside and be uncooked inside. Boilded down blue-berries in Cointreau and drizzled over top with Canadian Maple Syrup over that. No whip cream. Delicious!!!

This turned out very good! It was sweet enough to skip syrup and whipped cream - we stuck with fresh berries melted down into a sauce. In an attempt to save dishes, I tried to only use one pan and cook the bread in turns. All the toasted bread cemented to each other, so I would suggest following the instructions and either use two pans or something large enough to cook every piece at the same time.

This was very tasty. The caramel coating made it crusty. It started to smell like it was burning at medium heat so I had to turn it down even further. It didn't quite take as long to cook either. Served it with fresh blueberries and whipped cream.

I was skeptical but this recipe won me over with the results. Fantastic!

The whole thing turned into a blackened bitter mess and I didn't even have the heat on as high as it says in the directions. Normally, I cut thick slices of homemade white bread (Peter Reinhart's recipe) and leave them in the egg mixture to soak it up before cooking it slowly over medium to medium-low heat. At the medium heat, they started to burn and looked way overdone before the middle even had the chance to cook. Good thing I wasn't all that hungry. I think I'll stick to my regular recipe.

Just made this for a holiday weekend treat. The carmelized crust gave it a fabulous sweetness and texture - you really don't need much maple syrup, as the recipe suggests. Definitely a permanent fixture among our breakfast favorites.
