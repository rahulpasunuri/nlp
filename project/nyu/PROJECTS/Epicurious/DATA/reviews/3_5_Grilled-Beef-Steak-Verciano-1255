My boyfriend always puts ketchup on all his steaks, and with this recipe...he didnt even ask!!! I loved the marinade becuase all of the ingredients I have on hand already and I put it together in the morning and right after work, I put them on the grill. WONDERFUL!!!

I recommend using steak that is more toward 1 1/4" thick so that it doesn't overcook too easily. The reduction should be cooked longer in order to keep it from being too watery. Best to reduce it to taste.

Simple and fresh  quality meat requires little. Cut the garlic salt, double the garlic and use fresh Rosemary.

I was unimpressed with the results. With so many flavor combinations to try I can't imagine being inspired to come back to this one.

Simple, surprising amount of flavor. A great basic and enjoyable easy dish, will definitely be making regularly.

I prepare the recipe as written and marinade angus sirloin overnight in a ziplock bag. Always good. This has become a family favorite. The marinade makes a terrific sauce; the steak is flavorful, and not overwhelmed by the sauce. I make it for the grill in the summer, and for the broiler in the winter, when we NEED a taste of summer.

I followed the suggestion of others and eliminated the garlic salt, while adding more fresh garlic and rosemary. A very nice marinade!

I made this today for a client, using a grill pan and it turned out great. On the menu for two other clients this week. Great marinade

Beautiful marinade. I agree with other cooks who suggest omitting garlic salt and simply increasing fresh garlic. I marinated a dry-aged ribeye in a vacuum-sealed bag for one hour at room temperature. I let my Weber grill do the rest.

Adds excellent flavor without overwhelming the meat. I and my family loved it.

Simplicity at it's best. Red wine was a cab since it was available. Using fresh rosemary is big. Made a paste of the chopped garlic and salt. Used rib-eye's. So flavorful that that you don't need any other sauce on the side.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in 1996, and am pulling it out again for guests tonight. Like others I skip the garlic salt, up the fresh garlic, and saute mushrooms to add to the reduced marinade. This one never fails to impress. My absolute favorite standby! (And after years of epicurious use, this is the one recipe I felt obligated to review).

I stumbled upon this recipe while trying to get a steak marinade that would benefit from a time in the frig - while my wife and I took a 10 mile walk around NYC. This is a very simple and straight forward mardinade -- and very good. My only regret is not using a nicer cut. (I used a choice cut of top lion.)

Excellent! I have made this for friends and family and everyone loves it. Even the picky ones.

This marinade is excellent, nice subtle flavoring for a good cut of steak. I cut the rosemary in 1/2 (our rosemary bush seems to overpower recipes). I placed a few spoonfulls of the marinade reduction on the plate and placed the NY stips on top, everyone was blown away.

I use this nearly every time I make steak. It takes about 30 seconds to prepare, and adds great flavor to the meat without being overwhelming. I, too, left out the garlic salt, and also found that fresh rosemary was much better than dried.

My fiancé, the quintessential meat-and-potatoes man, loved this! I'm not a huge fan of steak to begin with, but I thought this was pretty good as well. Served it with popovers and a green salad, which made for a simple Saturday night family meal.

Made this for a casual grilling night w/friends. It was delicious. Marinated about an hour and a half at room temp. Boiled and passed the extra sauce as suggested -- it was great! Lots of compliments. And I usually like just plain grilled steak!

This is an outstanding marinade for beef. We have now used this twice in the last week, once for NY strips and once for T-bones. Very easy to make and gives a superb flavor. We used this with the recipe, "Sauteed portabella and cremini mushrooms" from gormet June 1998. Outstanding combination!

I have made this recipe several times and each time it was a huge success. The flavor is out of this world. I substituted the garlic salt for another clove of garlic. I served it with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Definitely a winner!

Duh! Lih! Shus! I used a cheap bottle of Trader Joe's merlot and skipped the garlic salt (I didn't have any), and even my non-meat-eating wife gobbled it up. There was a considerable amount of leftover marinade, so I added some butter and sauted some mushrooms in it. I served it over angel hair pasta.Totally scrumptious!

This was a very good marinade. I took the other people's advice and substituted the garlic salt for an extra clove of garlic. I also used fresh garlic and added fresh ground pepper. I added mushrooms to the marinade and added a flour and water mixture to dilute it (because of the high sodium content) and to make a fantastic mushroom gravy. I served it with mashed potatoes, rice, and a variety of grilled veggies. I will definitely make this again!

Talk about easy and delicious! There is nothing better than steak on the grill. This marinade is put together in 2 minutes. Throw in the steak and you're set. I skip the garlic salt altogether. I've already made this twice and will be making it all summer long.

Rating: 4
This is a real winner! Because of the comments on saltiness, I left out the garlic salt and used low sodium soy sauce and extra fresh garlic. I like a long marinating time. With a little chopper/grinder that my husband gave me for Christmas, this is a real breeze to fix (Need to chop fresh rosemary before the garlic). This is great with Polenta Triangles with Rosemary and Walnuts---this site, ID=105645.

Used this recipe to marinate cubes of sirloin for a skewer party. The meat turned out too salty even with a substitution of garlic powder for the garlic salt, and the marinade overpowered the the beef. A couple of people liked it, though. Poured the leftover marinade over some button mushrooms and portobellas and threw those on the grill. Those turned out great! If I use this recipe again, it will be for the mushrooms. There are much better marinades out there for steak.

A very flavorful marinade. I used fresh rosemary, substituted 1/4 teaspoon salt and freshly ground black pepper for the garlic salt and marinated two one-inch thick strip steaks. These were grilled on a stove top grill and were excellent. I definitely will serve this again.

This is a wonderfull, easy to make marinade! I used Marsala wine, and boneless beef ribs at a dinner party. The ribs were a huge hit and sadly there were no leftovers. Served it with red bell pepper pesto noodles, a simple salad of mixed greens and white cheddar, and garlic bread....Higly recommend it to any one looking for a simple, flavorfull marinade for beef.

This recipe is easy and the results are excellent. It's a great idea to thicken the sauce at the end or throw in a few other goodies, but the flavor of the steak is wonderful. Serve it with a good red wine and you'll be happy campers. (I can't imagine what in this recipe could have caused gas.)

My family is from Sicily. I grew up with Italian food and with Italian tradition. I am 43 and living in Florida now, my family lives in New York. I miss a lot of the meals I used to have as a kid and I can tell you this much about this recipe, it is the real deal. It taste wonderful and brought back many memories for me. Follow the recipe just exactly as it is for authenticity. Add a small can of drained mushrooms to the juice when you boil it, if you like mushrooms.

Since I am a vegetarian, I didn't eat the results of this recipe, but tested it on my cooking group and then on my family. I received rave reviews from both. This is so easy to do - I poked holes in the steak to help the marinating process and put it in a plastic bag. I marinated 24 hours and turned the bag whenever I happened to think of it. The marinade made a great sauce too.

This is staple in our home. Have used the sirloin, london broil and tri tip. Best with fresh rosemary and more fresh garlic. I also leave out the garlic salt. The soy and Worcestershire sauces provide enough salt. Time permitting, I marinate for 24 hours. Absolutely delicious!

Wow, I thought this steak was great! And it was so easy, plus I had all the ingredients on hand. I grilled it and I used the fresh rosemary. I think the fresh really came out in the sauce, which I thought really made the dish! This will be a definite keeper in our family! Served with baked potato and sour cream and grilled asparagus. What a cinchy dinner for a week-night!

This is one of the most delicious pieces of meat I have ever had. I made this for a special night with my boyfriend and he was speechless. I marinated some quartered vine ripened tomatoes in this marinade as well and grilled them for about 30 minutes. I topped the steaks with the tomatoes and drizzled a little of the reduced marinade over it.Magnifique!

Superb!!! Very easy to prepare and makes cheaper cuts of steak melt in the mouth. Didn't have any red wine to spare, so I used balsamic vinegar. I also increased the fresh rosemary and as I didn't have any garlic salt, added an extra couple of cloves of garlic. Served with "Sauteed Portabella and Cremini Mushrooms" - very intense flavours and absolutely delicious!

I used this marinade with rib-eye steaks, and it turned out excellent. The meat was very tender. It wasn't overpowered by the garlic salt as I presumed.
