One of the best panna cottas I've made. I used merlot grapes for the top. It came out beautifully and looked just like the picture. The flavor was like brown sugar cheese cake with wild grape jelly on top. Delicious!

I was looking for a way to use my Concord grapes and I tried this recipe out. I used grapes put through my juicer so there were some solids and the gelée was not clear and I omitted the grappa. It came out great and I everyone in my family asking for more!

I love this version of panna cotta...just the right balance of richness and a bit of tanginess. I also cut the heavy cream back by 50% (from 1 cup to 1/2 cup to be a little lighter). I substitute Cointreau for the grappa....which goes well with the grape gelee, but I like it even better without the gelee and use a berry compote instead. Lovey summer desert.

I just made the panna cotta part of this recipe (and no gelee). I used skim milk and non-fat plain yogurt, it was a great still creamy non-fat version of panna cotta. (for plain panna cotta I substituted the same amount of honey for brown sugar.) Delicious!

My friend brought this to my house for dessert and it was really delicious and refreshing. This is a unique dessert that is perfect for springtime and any occassion that you want a change from chocolate. I am going to make it this week.

This was great. I made it for thanksgiving dinner and it was a perfect sweet, but light dessert to follow up all that heavy food.
