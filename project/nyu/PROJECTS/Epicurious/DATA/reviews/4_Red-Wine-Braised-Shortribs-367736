I only had boneless short ribs and they worked well. I would put in oven for less than 2 hrs with boneless - probably 1.5 hrs. Made a day ahead for a dinner party and it was delicious and no fuss. Accidentally put the entire can of tomato paste in, and I still thought it tasted great! Served over Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes and everyone raved.

I made these for our Gourmet group - EXCELLENT, everyone raved!! I made a day ahead and removed the ribs from the sauce so I could get rid of the fat after it cooled in the refrigerator. I then put the ribs back in the sauce overnight. I reduced the sauce to 6 cups (I doubled the recipe for 10) and added 1/4 cup of flour to thicken. It needed a good dose of salt and pepper. I started to reheat the ribs in a covered pot at 300º then added the sauce to the pan and finished reheating on the cooktop. I expected to serve 2/pp but most were big so I only put one on each plate and passed the remainder. A few people ate a second one. We plated the ribs over parsnip-potato mash and added a few green beans in lemon butter.

I made this for dinner last night - AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was totally worth it. I know other reviewers have suggested tossing in extra veggies and not straining them out - but I think if you take the time to remove them and reduce the sauce you will end up with a beautiful dish and not something that resembles a beef stew. I got the short ribs at my local Whole Foods and they cut them into 2 inch pieces for me!

Absolutley the very best Braised Shortribs! I have tried several shortrib recipes and they're always lacking something but not this recipe. The deep rich flavor of the sauce and tenderness of the ribs is restaurant quality. I only used 2.5 lbs of ribs so I halved the remaining ingredients. I made 2 slight changes, I floured the ribs before browning and to the wine mixture added 1 TB balsamic vinegar. To avoid dryness I baked the ribs using three different temps, first at 350 for 1 hour, then reduced oven to 325, baked another hour and finally reduced oven to 300 and baked another hour. Meat was tender and sauce was rich and had so much flavor. As other reviewers have mentioned do take the time to reduce the wine mixture so you don't shortchange yourself on flavor. This is definitely the shortrib recipe for me. Served with BA Carmelized-Shallot Mashed Potatoes and green beans.

I made this last weekend for our Supper club. I took the picture to the meat market and the butcher cut them as described. Easy and reasonable. Only $21 for 7 lbs. Since I used more meat, I also increased the wine to 1 L. and the stock to 1.5 L. Other than that,I made it as written. It was a huge success! I cooked them the day before at 350 for 30 min. and then at 300 for 2 hrs. I chilled them on the porch overnight- it was 20 degrees- and in the morning, skimmed the fat from the sauce and also trimmed the fat from the ribs, as others had recommended. Definitely do that; it's so much more appetizing. I brought the dutch oven to room temp. the day I served them and put them in a 300 oven for 1+ hrs. I made polenta to serve with them and that was also a hit. We had the braised carrots and parsnips from Ina's new cookbook. A great winter meal on a cold night. Delish!

My boyfriend and I made this and we both agree it is fabulous. It's even better the second day. We followed the instructions to the letter--we were nervous, like other reviewers, that the temperature might be too high, but the meat was tender and the sauce was perfect. We made the full amount for two people and are going to repurpose the leftovers over pasta by pulling the meat apart and simmering some diced tomatoes with the leftover gravy. I will definitely make this again and I think it's perfect fare for company.

Tasty. Only adjustment I made was to use dried herbs. The meat was extremely tender. Maybe better quality wine and some balsamic vinegar would have increased this to 4 forks

I think this recipe is definitely a keeper. I made it for a dinner party for 10 last night and was pleased with it except it was ever so slightly dry. I used boneless short ribs. So, I have several comments/questions. First, when I think of braising, I think low and slow. After being in the oven at 350 for a while, it was boiling like crazy! 350 does not seem like a "low" temp (do any of you agree with me?) so I lowered it to 250 and let it cook a little longer. (until the meat was tender) Don't know why it was a little dry maybe from the initial boiling or giving it the extra 1/2 hour? Also, I made a mistake after I took the meat out of the sauce. I figured I would just reduce it that night, then stick it in the fridge and remove the fat after that. Well, for some reason, the fat never separated after it cooled. It was all mixed in! I don't know maybe it was too thick for the fat to come to the top? Don't get me wrong, the sauce was very good, but I probably gave my guest tons more calories than they needed! Anyways,I wanted to share my mistakes and get your input so I can perfect this yummy recipe.Thanks!

This turned out really really nice. My sauce didn't look as dark red as in the picture. And after the ribs were done and I took it out of the oven, I had quite a bit of sauce still in the pot. So, I reduced it more before serving. It was very good!

Excellent and easy, loved this recipe. I served with mashed sweet potatoes and grilled corn with lim herb butter!

dee-lish! I used minced garlic instead of a whole head and added 4 oz(dried) porcini mushrooms and soaking liquid, but otherwise followed the recipe. I make this dish 3 days ahead of time so the flavors can marry while it sits in the fridge. come serving day, I reheat slowly and serve with either mashed or mashed potatoes or polenta, and green beans. there are never any leftovers.

I've never met a wine-braised short rib I didn't like. This recipe is fantastic, a great blend of depth and complexity in the sauce, and a basic list of ingredients. I made this over the course of a lounge-around Sunday and the house smelled fantastic. Served over polenta.

This was my first attempt at short ribs, and they turned out DELICIOUS! I would, however, agree with other reviewers that adding something with a little kick (e.g., red pepper flakes, balsamic) might have made the sauce even better. Looking forward to leftovers!

Absolutely delicious! I made these for a dinner party with my boyfriend's parents and they were such a hit! Great for entertaining, because once they go in the oven, they don't need much attention. They had fantastic flavor and were fall off the bone good. My first attempt at ribs, and I have to say, I'm afraid to try another recipe, because it might not be as good! Definite recommendation here!

I made this tonight and it was just OK. I cooked it for 3 hours expecting the meat to fall off the bone but it could have done with another 1h I think. Granted I think the 'short ribs' that we get here do not have as much fat so the meat tends to be drier. Hubby and son said it was OK so won't be making this again.

This is a 4-fork meal only on Day 2, when you can remove all that fat from the sauce. Day 1, not so much. Also, remove the meat from the bones and cartilage before they cool so it's easy to do.

I added 1/4 cup good quality balsamic vinegar to the braise and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, as one reviewer suggested. Also, when the cooking was done,after placing the meat on a serving platter, I strained all the liquid into a fat/gravy separator and removed the fat. Then I removed the parsley, and squeezed the roasted garlic into the remaining vegetables (mirepoix). I added the vegetables to the fat-free sauce, added one more cup of beef broth (because there was not much liquid left), and used a handheld blender to blend it all together. Then I reheated the gravy and served it to pour over the individual servings of meat. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Red-Wine-Braised-Shortribs-367736#ixzz1ip9gdR28

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday dinner and it was AMAZING! I made a few small changes due to preference or based on what I had on hand. I used boneless shortribs which I seasoned with salt and pepper then dredged in flour before searing (this made for a nice thickened sauce straight out of the oven). I added mushrooms to the veggies and put all my herbs minus the garlic into a cheesecloth bundle so they could be removed easily without needing to strain the sauce. I cut all the veggies in larger 1" pieces so they wouldn't cook down too much in the sauce and I served this with goat cheese mashed potatoes recommended by another reviewer (YUMMY) and simple sauteed green beans. Right before serving I also added about 4 tablespoons of cold butter straight into my dutch oven with the meat and veggies, incorporating each tablespoon piece before adding the next. This step was not needed but it helped make the sauce super silky and just a little bit creamier. I also never had to strain fat out of my sauce I think due to the fact that I used boneless shortribs. The prep for this meal was quite time consuming but definitely worth it. My husband said these were the best shortribs he's ever had! I served this meal with a nice cabernet sauvignon which echoed the cab used in the recipe in the most amazing way. DEFINITELY a keeper!

This was a HUGE hit with my husband & daughter. All the reviews that I read were accurate, the sauce served over mashed potatoes makes it! I ordered the beef ribs from the butcher & asked that they cut them crosswise into 2" pieces so that made it very easy. The recipe was easy to follow. The hardest part was waiting for them to be done!

I made this for dinner yesterday. It was delicious and very simple to make. I made only a few changes: I cooked mine in a roaster on 325 degrees for the first hour and then 350 for the last 45 minutes. The meat came off the bone perfectly. I would watch cooking time, I think the time the recipe called for would dry the meat out. Served with mashed potatos and red wine. A great winter meal and I live in Arizona. :)

I made this for dinner tonight, and though the prep takes roughly FOREVER, it is soooooooooooo worth it in the end--layers upon layers of flavor! I did make a few tweaks to the recipe. First, I only used four pounds of short ribs on the whole bone, cut into two-bone sections. Second, I added a half pound of sliced Baby Bella mushrooms to the mirepoix, and next time, I'd use a whole pound! Also, I added about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to the braise, plus a pinch of hot red pepper flakes. I also tied the herb sprigs into a bundle with kitchen twice and did NOT strain the veggies out of the finished sauce. I shredded the tender beef, discarded the bones and connective tissue, and stirred the meat back into the sauce and veggies. Then I served it all over homemade buttermilk, garlic, and parsley mashed potatoes. SO GOOD!

This was pretty good. We didn't have beef short ribs, so we used the pork country-style ribs we had on hand. The only changes I made were to add a bulb of fennel and 2 tbls of beef demi- glace, as the braising liquid on its own lacked depth. The liquid is not sauce-like on its own. I added a bit of flour mixed with butter to thicken it up and it helped a bit, but not much. Serve over mashed potatoes so that delicious liquid can soak in. Next time I will definitely make this with the beef short ribs it calls for.

To A Cook from Oakland: I don't think you did anything wrong. Short ribs are just fatty! One thing you might consider if you make this again is placing the pot in the fridge overnight, scraping off and tossing what will be a pretty thick layer of solidified fat, bringing the pot to a boil again on the stove, and putting it back in the oven for a while. This will eliminate some of the fat (at least in the sauce) and a second-cooking will thicken it as well. I thought this was a pretty solid, easy recipe, but agree that the bones, connective tissue, and fat factor of short ribs aren't especially appealing and it'll be a long while before I make them again.

This was my first time making short ribs, and I did not like the results. I hope some of you fine cooks can explain what might have gone wrong. I used "chuck" short ribs as that is all that was available at the store. They were cut in pieces larger than 2 inches and, without a meat cleaver, I couldn't cut them smaller at home. The ribs were tender and easily came off the bone, but there wasn't much meat and there was a long gross strip of connective tissue. The meat tasted like pot roast, but with more fat and less meat. The "sauce" was essentially just thin braising liquid, about the consistency of broth. I would like to try again, but I don't know what to do differently to ensure better results. It smelled fabulous while braising - just didn't taste anywhere near as good as I had hoped.

I rarely eat red meat and never cook it, but my husband has hinted about wanting short ribs for a long time, so I went for it. Super delicious and pretty simple. I will be making this again. I'm not a huge mashed potato fan, but this recipe MUST be served with creamy mashed potatoes and giant hunks of french bread (for sopping up all that divine braising liquid). So good super tasty.

Maybe I had a poor cut of meat, but these were not good. The meat wilted off the bone and I wasn't able to find it in the sauce, and there were chunks of fat everywhere. Again, maybe the short ribs were too fatty? Or maybe I cooked it too long (likely). But this was a waste of $20 worth of meat (and I only did 3lbs). Next outing with short ribs will be with a different preparation.

This was an exceptional dish. My husband and I were so pleased with the restaurant-like results of this flavorful dish, but the real critics were my picky-eating kids, age 2 and 6. Both of them devoured every last scrap with no complaints! I made a few modifications: -halved the recipe since I only had 2 lbs shortribs - substituted beef broth with chicken stock, some dried herbs where I didn't have fresh -used a nice merlot instead of cabernet - finished the cooking in my slow-cooker on high for 3 hours. The results were phenomenal! Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. !st effort at short ribs. Made in an All-Clad crockpot with cast iron insert so was easy to brown and cook veggies. Added slightly less broth then called for and cooked on low for 6 hrs (I am impatient and was busy that day). Turned out wonderfully. I did leave overnight and skim fat off in the am. Reheated well by just placing it on the stove. Tried to thicken sauce a bit with flour to make more of a gravy but gave up. Didn't want to ruin taste and perhaps I had taken too much fat off. Served with mashed potatoes. Would definitely do again for a dinner party!Maybe leave vegetables more chunky next time?

I made this last weekend and, as others have said, it is easy and very tasty and made the house smell great. I let it sit overnight and that may have made it even better. My only issue was that I checked on it about and hour and a half into the cooking time and saw that it was getting a little dry, so I added about 3/4 of a cup of water and ended up with just the right amount of sauce. If your dutch oven doesn't have a really tight fitting lid, you may have to do the same (or put some foil on the top under the lid to keep the moisture in).

I made with grass-fed beef, so there wasn't much fat. Also, vegetables were all cooked down, so I didn't strain, and I thought they added good flavor to the sauce. I also used a combination of (leftover) Cab Franc & Cab Sauvignon in the dish.

The ultimate in comfort food. I used dried thyme as most of my herbs died in the summer heat. Served it with mashed potatoes and crusty bread for a great after church Sunday lunch. So easy to make it and leave in the oven to braise away.

This was great. I doubled the recipe to feed 10, using 1/2 bone-in ribs and 1/2 boneless shortribs. I did not double the wine. That amount of meat did not fit into my braiser, so I put 1/2 of the meat into a crockpot on high and swapped after an hour or so so both halves of the batch had time in the cast iron in the oven. Deep, rich, complex flavor. It took a long time, but was not labor-intensive. I will definitely make again.

Just took this out of the oven. House smells great. I had made short ribs before and wasn't happy with the little amount of meat, and the large amount of fat. These seem like a better product and the recipe is great. Considering leaving the veggies in, (I added mushrooms) like other reviewers. Tied the herbs, except for the parsley, with twine so easier to remove from pot. Great Sunday night recipe.

I used 3.5 pounds of sirloin tip rather than the short ribs and cooked the dish for 2 hours in the oven. Even though I don't mind eating fat, I really prefer the taste of sirloin tip. This recipe was absolutely delicious. I will make it again and again. I served it over Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes - just devine!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. Next time I would keep it in the oven for less time so the meat would still adhere to the bones. The flavor was great and I will, certainly, make it again.
