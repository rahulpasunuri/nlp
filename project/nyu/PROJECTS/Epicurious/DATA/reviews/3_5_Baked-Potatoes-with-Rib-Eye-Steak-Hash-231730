The best I can say about this dish is that it's boring. If I had made it with leftover beef, instead of buying choice rib eyes for it, I probably wouldn't have been all that disappointed. It's missing something to give it some flavor. Between the rich ribeye and fatty cream, it's really sort of one-note. No acidic component. No zing. The onions and peppers aren't enough. Maybe top it with some horseradish creme fraiche? Maybe stir a little horseradish into the cream when it's added to the onion mixture. I don't know if I'm motivated to even try again with this one.

Start the onions and peppers when you start the potatoes. This is a fantastic recipe. I used leftover beef tenderloin from Christmas dinner. I also added grated Parmesan with the cream. Yummy!

@jmpeterson. Read the recipe, indeed. You're not asked to saute the onions, but to carmelize them. That can easily take 30 minutes.

Made this with left over prime rib. Sauteed onions and broccoli with two strips of rendered bacon drippings, reduced with a little cream (what the heck?). Mixed in the meat & topped with Swiss cheese, broiled until melted then sprinkled crumbled bacon over the whole thing. OMGosh!! this was wonderful. You could really use this recipie and go anywhere with it depending on your leftovers. My husband loved this and called it pure comfort food. Very easy to do. Pop the potatos in the oven first thing through the door and a yummy meal is ready within an hour on a busy week night with only one pan to clean...my kind of weeknight meal!

You know...I've wasted a lot of money & food in my time by not reading the recipe before hand: this recipe says to saute the peppers, onions etc, 30 minutes. 30 minutes? Come on Guys; has anyone really made this recipe before writing it down?

Excellent recipe. I didn't have a red pepper on hand, so I substituted a little celery and a couple of carrots and it was fantastic. Nothing like a little melted cheese on top, either!

We love this recipe and those we share it with enjoy it too. I typically use chicken and for an even faster dish I use ground chicken. This is a great way to cook the potato - now I won't cook them any other way. May seem strange, but this is great to take camping!

What a great way to use leftover steak! My kids devoured these.

This was great! Turned out just like the picture too. I couldn't find red jalapenos so i used one green one and it was fine. Presentation looks great but it is more involved than it seems. I'd definitely make it again.

This is unbelieveably good. Have made several times. Now when I grill steaks, I grill an extra steak to use with this hash later in the week. With a cooked steak, I follow reciepe except add the sliced cooked steak at the end to heat through in the sauce. Tremendous!

Thank you ritamk for your recommendation! I am always looking for good recipes for ground venison and this is great. We made it last night and my husband gave it an A+. Tonight we're going to put the leftover meat and vegetables into phyllo.

There are many ways to prepare a baked potato and a rib-eye steak and this is not one of them. It is a shame to desecrate a good piece of beef this way.

A bit bland for our taste, even with the jalepenos. Seemed overly rich and the cream didn't do much to add to flavor or texture.

I've made this recipe twice, it's delicious. Since my husband doesn't eat meat, I've just eliminated the steak and cook the peppers in the cream solo. I served it for company twice with great results.

Great recipe! I used half and half to make it a little less fattening. Save time by putting the potatoes in the microwave. I like to use some seasoning on the meer to make it more flavorful.

Delicious, hearty meal. The red jalapenos are milder than their green cousins, so I might add an additional one for more kick next time. We used nonfat half-and-half instead of the cream with great results.

I have made this dish a couple of times. The first time exactly as given, the second time I used ground venison, which gives it a bit different flavor and I added a poblano chile. Either way, it is a keeper!

We made this recipe this weekend; it's a fun dish for casual family dining. The flavors, textures and colors are an interesting mix, which makes this an "out of the ordinary" meal.

I have nearly always found the potato is a great foundation for many good dishes.
