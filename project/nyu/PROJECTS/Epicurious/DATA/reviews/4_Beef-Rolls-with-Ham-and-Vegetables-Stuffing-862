I made this for my family and we all loved it. I followed the recipe except added the mustard to the filling which made it stick to the meat better when rolling. No problem with tenderness or the sauce reducing. The pickles are a real bonus.

This started out well, but turned out to be disappointing. I tasted the filling once it was cooked, and it was slightly sweet, a perfect contrast to the German mustard. Things went down hill from there. After cooking for an hour, the meat was still tough; it probably could have used another hour, but my family was clamoring for dinner. The sauce was a disaster, runny and greasy, even though I held back on the butter. It was not easy to degrease, thanks to all the floating bits of onion. So, though I won't be making this again, I can see using the filling to stuff pork chops and later deglazing the pan and making a mustard-based sauce.

Loved the stuffing! I added more carrots and about a tablespoon of the mustard to the stuffing before letting it cool. This added a nice spice. Way too much butter in the sauce. Next time I will cut way down. Served slices of beef rolls over balsamic greens which added a subtle punch to the flavor and presentation. Served with smoked jack cheese flat bread triangles.

Although not a bad recipe it is not really traditional. Try rolling beaten (with a mallet) beef round with mustard, onion, parsley (minced), bacon, and homemade dill pickle. Now that is rouladen!!!!

I had this at a party and have been looking for it a LONG time! I was so excited when I found it. It was VERY good!!!

I made this recipe as part of a "German" menu and served it with sweer and sour red cabbage. It's a little fussy but worth it as a company dish. Beef sliced for Braciole worked easily.

I really loved this recipe, however....I thought that the pickle spear was a bit over powering. Next time I will dice the pickle spears in hopes of cutting down on the taste. This dish has a wonderful aray of flavors. Very Good!

This recipie is fantastic. I am used to having Rouladen (that is what we call them in German) with bacon, not real ham, but this was a very good health alternative. I wish that there was a German section in the cuisine modifiers for the search page. This is a wonderful taste that reminds me of my youth.

I followed the suggestions from the others, and asked the butcher to cut the meat (used top sirloin) for me. A butcher should know what rouladen is if you ask. I also pounded the bejeebers out of it and it was fork tender. Try using the crushed ginger snaps as a thickener -- delicious! This dish has a lot of flavor and was a hit at our dinner party.

What a great recipe. I have made beef rolls before that have turned out to be bland but these were perfect. I will be serving these at my next dinner party.

This is a fabulous recipe. I'm not German nor would I know the first thing about German cooking, but this is a winner. Great for a cold winter night. I followed all the suggestions from the cook from Seattle - do the same - definately brown these while sauteing the onions and don't reduce the sauce because you don't have enough. I used a roux to thicken. Also, forget the toothpick method - they fall apart. Use the twine and don't forget to cut it off before serving to guests - my husband almost swallowed it.

My family is from Germany (Koeln). These are authentic. Very good recipe. I would do only four things differently: 1) Tie each end if each rouladen with string instead of using toothpicks (they hold together better durring cooking) 2) don't just add the rouladen to the pan and coat with the butter. Brown them with the onion! Much more flavorful browned. 3) thicken the sauce with either ground gingersnap crumbs, a roux (butter & flour mix) or cornstarch (all 3 methods are authentic). Don't reduce it - you dont have enough sauce for the side dishes then. 4) return the rouladen to the thicken sauce and simmer another 15 minutes. Serve with potato dumplings, spaetzle or kartoffelpuree (mashed potatoes).

This is the best Rouladen recipe I've ever cooked or eaten. I used sirloin and cooked a little longer. Tender and delicious! This recipe has been added to my personal German recipe file to be used at Octoberfest gatherings.

This is a fantastic recipe. I finally found real rouladen. The recipe looks like it takes a lot of time to prep, but it's a snap. I serve this with Beets and saurcrout and a variation of mashed potatoes. Such as Roasted Garlic or Bacon, sour, cream and chives mashed (baked potatoes mashed with the all the "fixins")
