Perfect for a dinner party. The flavors of the vinaigrette are AMAZING. So easy because I bought a bag of the frozen extra large shrimp deveined with the shell on at Publix supermarket. Marinated them as directed, stuck them skewers so they were flat side down, and grilled for 4 min each side, on medium gas grill heat. They were perfect. Heat up the rest of the vinaigrette before pouring over the top for serving. There was no vinaigrette left! I would definitely make a double batch of the vinaigrette next time.

This was very good. Used oregano, parsley and rosemary from my garden rather than just oregano. Served with grilled zucchini and rice and plenty of the remaining dressing. Will make again!

Due to severe thunderstorm, I decided to cook the shrimps in the oven in the marinade. Also, I had some fresh garlic scapes and really wanted to use those instead. It turned out amazing, my husband said more than 3 times how much he was impressed with the taste and presentation! Definitely will make again but this time, on the grill!

Excellent and easy. I used 1 # of shrimp - accidentally bought only tail on shrimp and didn't miss having to shell them. Didn't bother with the blender - just whisked it. Made all of the marinade on the shrimp (cut oil to 1/2 cup) and followed another's advise by heating the leftover before pouring over the grilled shrimp. This will be added to the rotation!

Super easy. I just mixed everything with the mortar and pestle to cut down on dishes (just making 2 servings) and grilled on a grill pan. Used smaller shrimp and done in 4 minutes. Quick & tasty.

Made this last night and it was fresh and easy and most of all delicious. I served with the orzo, feta and dill salad and grilled corn with basil butter. Tasted like summer! Will make this again and again.

This recipe was very easy to make. The marinate gives the shrimp a very subtle flavor. I especially liked the flavor the oregano gave the shrimp. I broiled the shrimp instead of grilling because it was raining.

Having never been a huge fan of oregano, I was hesitant to try this recipe. But WOW, this is so very tasty and my friends are requesting it when they come over! Don't miss out on the fresh oregano- it really makes the dish. Great idea for a party if you make the marinade in advance and have the shrimp ready on skewers.

Loved it! All ingredients were on hand, except for the fresh oregano, so this made a great last minute dish. Dried oregano had to do since my oregano was under a foot of snow, however I was able to use my gas grill despite the snow. Served with a lovely rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. Could have used more marinate for sauce. Will definitely serve again.

It is the dead of winter in northern Wisconsin. I was not going to grill during the snow storm but wanted a quick appetizer dish with shrimp. I found this recipe and am anxious to try it out when the glaciers recede. In the meantime, I took the basic concept of lemon, garlic, oregano, and olive oil with shrimp. I cooked 3 cloves of garlic and a good hit of dried ground oregano with a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet for a couple of minutes. I then tossed in 8 nice shrimp and cooked them on both sides. I then removed the shrimp and put them in a bowl. I then added the juice of an entire lemon to the skillet and turned up the heat to reduce the mix. When it began to get dense, I poured it over the shrimp in the bowl.

This is way tastier than I thought it would be. Had just over 1 pound of shrimp, so made the same amount of marinade, but cut the salt back to 1/2 teaspoon and the oil back to 1/2 cup. Added one red Thai chili, and would add even more if the crowd wasn't spice-averse. Sauce was just enough to soak the shrimp in, then heated the rest on the stove top and poured it over the grilled shrimp. Complex taste, not boring, even using dried oregano because there was no fresh herbs around! (Used about 1/4 teaspoon). So good for dipping bread into, too. Probably the best recipe I've found to date for really tasty grilled shrimp using just pantry ingredients.

Definitely not worth the effort for us. It was okay, nothing really wrong with it, but not outstanding for the amount of work (and shopping) involved. Not quite sure why so many other people rave about it; lots of other seafood recipes to choose from that taste far better. Maybe it's just personal preference, but we all rate this one just mediocre.

Rating: 0
Yum, this was so delicious. The only change was the amount of fresh oregano as I only had 2T but it was still wonderful marinade/dipping sauce. Will make this again as we loved it.

Really incredible! I modified the recipe using lime & cilantro instead of lemon & oregano and it was equally delicious! A bit hit with my guests.

For some reason jumbo shrimp was hard for my husband to find when I sent him out with my shopping list. He found it after going to 4 other stores and claimed that he didn't even care that he paid top dollar by that point, and I am so glad he found them, because it was well worth it, biting into those large pieces of lobster-like shrimp meat. Great way to use our meyer lemons as well!

So easy and delicious...just a little different than my typical garlic and rosemary shrimp.

Super tasty... I haven't been able to do this on the grill yet, but both times on the stove top were great. In shells with smaller shrimp the first time--eaten with our fingers--and then jumbo with tails only--eaten with forks. Both great. Served over quinoa.

Unbelievably good! Made this for Christmas dinner -- was a huge hit! Definatly leave the shrimp unpeeled when you grill them. Easier to grill if they're on skewers.

Simply delicious! Made them for an appetizer for a dinner party. The minutes I set the platter down they were gone! Sauce is great and would be excellent on grilled chicken too! I too removed the shells for easier eating.

I used large shrimp (31-40/lb), and peeled them before grilling. Served with a side Greek salad (the shrimp marinade does double duty as the salad dressing) a seeded baguette and a bottle of Chardonnay. Great meal.

what can i say? this marinade / sauce is such a winner on almost anything. like others, i used peeled shrimp to make life easy and it is delicious. also grilled red peppers and onions which are yummy cut into triangles to dip into the sauce. have also made the sauce with fresh basil and parsley when didn't have fresh oregano and is equally delicious

We made this last night, and it was not only easy but delicious!!! Like the cook from St. Louis, I basically threw everything in the blender and went from there. I did add a wee bit of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. My shrimp were skewered and peeled, too.

A caution to A Cook from Westport, CT. Dried oregano is NOTHING like fresh. Dried will overpower the recipe. It is definitely worth the time and very little mess to chop fresh. Dried oregano will NOT improve this recipe!

I threw everything into the blender but otherwise made as directed. It was excellent and made a beautiful presentation.

Wonderful! I only used 1 lb instead of 3 and didn't have much sauce left so the 3# shrimp to the sauce size may be a bit optimistic. I threw everything except the oregano into a food processor and then emulsified with the olive oil and it came out perfect. Great flavor play with the oregano, lemon and shrimp. Like others, since the shrimp were so large I just grilled them.. about 6 mins total and they were perfect.

Pretty good,. I diod use Wild american shrimp whicjh did help the shriomp hold up to the bold flavor of the sauce.

Made this twice with very positive comments from guests. I don't get the grilling on skewers or foil. Is your grill so dirty you need to line it with foil? I avoid the skewers by ensuring the shrimp are jumbo enough to not fall through the grill. Another good recipe!

EVERYONE RAVES ABOUT THIS! I cut down on the time by not using skewers. I line my grill with foil, place the shrimp on the foil, flip them mid way and voila! THIS IS A KEEPER

I thought this was good, but not great. I skewered peeled jumbo shrimp, marinated, and then grilled. I will make it again, but definitely will try dry oregano next time; it will cut the prep time/mess down to almost nothing.

So easy and so good! We did this on the grill with fresh wild Alaskan spot prawns which taste like little lobster tails. A must try when they are in season. We made extra sauce to use with grilled baguette. Yum.

This recipe is AMAZING! Although you can have it any time of year, I look forward to having it in the summer after a few light cocktails. We generally use large shrimp and it is wonderful. Rather than doing it in steps as suggested, I just throw everything in the electric chopper, including the oregano, and blend very well. I really can't say enough about how great this is!

The lemon garlic fresh oregano sauce is SO good. I could close my eyes and imagine myself in Greece. . . It's fresh, simple and delicious. Perfect for summer bbq- ing. I also skewered cleaned shelled shrimp (tails left on) onto wooden skewers. Used fresh oregano b/c we have it in our garden. I bought 3 lbs extra large 20-26 shrimp and served it alongside grilled lamb for 8 adults & our kids.

So crazy good. Made this for my boyfriend's birthday and we loved it. I will definitely make this again soon. I wasn't nearly so fancy with the marinade, used a garlic press instead of food processor and just whisked all the ingredients together. And I used a cast-iron skillet because I'm an apartment dweller, but they were succulent and delicious. I liked the other reviewer's idea about serving with olives, greens, and feta cheese. Mmm.

My husband I really enjoyed this simple but delicious recipe. The Shrimp was tender and had a really delicate flavour. We often eat really spicy and foods with tons of flavour, but this was a nice change and really compliments the shrimps natural flavours without masking them. I will absolutely make this again!

Great recipe! This was probably the best dish out of the 4 experiments I made last night. I tested 4 recipes last night on my husband and two friends in preparation for my neighbors 75th birthday celebration (Im grilling a main dish for 20). All were huge hits and Ill mention the other recipes later. I peeled the shrimp and left the tails, and since Im not a personal seafood fan, I asked my guests if they preferred peeled or unpeeled, tails or not? Unanimous for peeled shrimps with tails on. My Montana store did not have fresh oregano and since I wasnt going all over town, I used dry oregano, of course using less. Still tasted the oregano and the sauce was fine. The other experiments last night: Chile rubbed shrimp with avocado corn cocktail, Grill roasted clam linguine, BBQ beef ribs with molasses-bourbon sauce. My guests raved about all!

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Made as part of a Greek themed BBQ. Used extra large shrimp (16-20/lb) peeled leaving tail. 2 shrimp/skewer. The marinade was delicious - just threw all the ingredients in a food processor making it really simple. Used the fresh oregano and I believe there was a huge difference. The grilled lemons looked great on the platter.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe, but used shelled shrimp. We enjoyed it. I will make it again, but will probably use extra large shrimp (20 to a pound). It's a lot less expensive that way. The huge shrimp are very impressive, though. I thought using skewers made grilling the shimp easy.

Rating: 3
Happy diners!! Slight modifications based on what I had in the 'frig & pantry: used bottled key lime juice instead of squeezing fresh lemons, and mixed Italian dried herbs instead of fresh oregano. Ate every last shrimp (started with peeled raw from frozen) and received comments on the overall flavor's nice tang! Will definitely make again - may try to skillet cook and save the hassle of threading thru skewers. Would be excellent over pasta too!

Very easy, light tasting seafood recipe for the grill-jumbo shrimp are ideal for summer grilling. I grill with the shell on, after cutting the back of the shrimps and deveining. I also find skewering 3-4 shrimp on 2 skewers at a time make flipping the shrimp much easier.

I loved this recipe and so did all my tennis players when I served this as an h'or derve during a warm afternoon. The grilled lemons (I used limes because I live in Mexico) were the key flavor for a festive platter. I am now asked to bring this other friends homes.

I'm laughing because I didn't even see the part about grilling the lemons. Oh well..obviously not the key component of the recipe! Anyway...this was a totally 100% delicious shrimp dish. Low fat/low carb/quick & easy. I served the shrimp over mixed greens with olives and feta cheese and drizzled the dressing over everything. Have a feeling we will be making this one again soon.

VERY delicious and a great summer treat! The marinate and grill flavors are a perfect mix. If you prepare a half recipe I would still use the full recipe for the marinate. I felt the grilled lemons overpowered the cooked shrimp flavor. ~ Enjoy

Very easy and tasty. Used indoor grill pan due to the weather. Can be a quick meal because marinating time is only 15 minutes. I used the 6-8 per lb shrimp and oregano from the garden and they were very tender and moist. Will make again!
