I found the flavors to be delicate and the 'bland' issue has more to do with not adding enough salt and pepper. I served it with mashed redskin potatoes (almond milk, garlic, olive oil, salt pepper), and a radish cipollini onion salad (sherry vinegar, lemon zest, parsley, kosher salt, and pepper). Awesome spring dinner - light, clean, and fresh.

Delicious, easy, healthy and didn't heat up the house. Spouse might even have gone for four forks, but agreed that "delicious" was more appropriate than "exceptional." I did add 1T mustard at the end (thanks Vancouver!), but it would be good without. Probably better with fresh tarragon, but surprisingly unnecessary. Used broccoli instead of peas.

I agree with the cook from Vancouver. This recipe was rather bland. I won't try it again though.

Really nice recipe, and I'm not all that fond of tarragon. Turkey's a bit tough, so I'm going to try it next time with chicken.

I was disappointed in this recipe, as my family found it rather bland. I'd like to try it again, but next time I'll try yo liven it up. Perhaps some dijon mustard? I don't know, but it needs something.

Excellent recipe, even for a novice in the kitchen! Delicious and easy to prepare - most of my first-time recipes have at least one thing go wrong, but not this one!

This is a delicious, low fat and quick dish to prepare. Our eight year old gave it four forks and has requested this dish be added to our weekly menu many times. It has become a standard at our home.

A nice light-tasting dish that was quick, easy and delicious. I served it with mashed potatoes and my family loved it. Definitely a keeper.
