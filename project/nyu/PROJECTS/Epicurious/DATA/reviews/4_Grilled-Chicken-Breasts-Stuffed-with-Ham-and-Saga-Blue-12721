Exceptional. Love this with the original menu which includes the Celery and Apple Salad Dijon salad (on this site) another quick and easy meal, full of flavor. Creates 2 hardy portions, any leftovers are amazing the next day too.

YUCK 100% YUCK! Made as listed exactly. Not even edible...trashed. The worst recipe I have ever made from this site!

Instead of ham and saga blue, you can use Boursin, it's delicious! To be even more creative, add Boursin and a slice of fresh peeled pear. You can bake the breasts in a casserole the oven instead of grilling. Yum!

Wonderful recipe. Have made it several times. Used smoked gouda this time and it turned out fabulous. Cooked on the grill, but not over the flame so it baked it. Definitely a keeper.

This is really good, and really easy. i couldn't find Saga, but for any readers in northern california, pt. reyes blue can't be beat.

I thought it was good, but I've had better. I used stilton and Amana ham, and I'm thinking I should make it a second time with Saga to see if that makes the difference.

I made this for Christmas dinner with great success. I used even-cook chicken breasts (from Sam's) and then layered a slice of deli ham (Hormel Cure 81) and some blue cheese crumbles. Then I rolled up and closed with toothpicks. To prevent the cheese running out the ends, I tied the rolls length-wise which worked great. Like another reviewer, I also made the basting sauce in the microwave and it was perfect. Great tastes. Very easy and quick to prepare!

Actually 2.5 forks. Tasty, easy & quick to make. Used Treasure Cove bleu cheese & black forest ham. Used 2 toothpicks to close. Microwaved the worch. sauce & lemon juice 20 seconds, then stirred in butter. Don't skip this simple basting sauce because it adds a lot of flavor. Easy to grill. Will keep this for a family meal, or casual BBQ w/old friends.

I couldn't find the Saga Blue anywhere. Tried specialty outlets as well. Very frustrating but I substituted it with a blue cheese recommended by the staff which I can't recall. Anyway, it was delicious and like most on here, I substituted ham for proscuitto.

Made this for company and it was nice change for plain chicken. I think I used swiss instead, but still good.

Very, very good! The flavors inside were excellent, but since I made it for 50 people, I prepared it in the oven. It was tender and good, but the appearance was less than perfect--just flat and white chicken. Maybe it needed a cheese topping or bread crumbs or ?? The flavors were great and I would make it again for any party or dinner to impress.

This dish is excellent! I made it last night for a dinner party of 10 people and all of them were asking what I did to make it taste so good. I used 2 slices of procuitto of which I wrapped around a 1/2" thick slice of goat cheese and sage leaf. I basted it with a good mustard and olive oil mixture and voila! I WILL make this again. It's easy!!

It was raining so I baked it for 30-40 minutes at 350, basted it every 5 minutes and used prosciuto instead of ham. It turned out excellent!

Pretty good dish and easy to make. I made it with the cheeses I had on hand (swiss for me, cheddar for my husband) and resorted to baking as recommended, as the weather wasn't conducive to grilling. Although good baked and with substitutions, I will follow the recipe exactly next time. My husband loved it more than I did; he had THREE helpings! A hint for reducing leakage: I made a very small slit in the breast and maneuvered the knife inside to make the pocket. This left just a small opening to secure with the wooden pick. Worked like a charm with no leakage.

Delicious! I cooked this dish in the oven on 350 for 30min, basting with the sauce as indicated. The lovely flavors blend well together.

Very tasty. We served it with the apple and celery salad, as recommended. We also used chicken breasts without the skins, which worked just fine.

I made this at work and got a fabulous response! I thought it would also be great using smoked mozzarella for the cheese!

This was really good. The basting sauce tasted awesome and everything was so easy to make. I would definitely make it again. I used swiss cheese instead of blue because I couldn't stand the smell of the blue cheese. Maybe next time.

This is such a simple recipe, I don't know why I didn't think of it! It is delicious and very tasty. I was in a pinch and didn't have boneless/skinless chicken breasts and used my bone-in chicken breasts and it worked just fine. There's no doubt I will make this again! THANKS!

EXCELLANT!!! Easy to do ahead and put on the grill when guests are present. Simple but more than elegant!!!!

Worcestersire sauce provides an excellent compliment to the ham and cheese. We used white cheddar & honey baked ham, baked to cook thru and then broiled for the finish.

Nice recipe, but I think I will try turkey instead of ham next time and parmesan instead of bleu cheese. I will for sure give it another try.

So easy, but so delicious! The better ingredients you use, the better the taste, so splurge on really nice ham.

There's no mystery to me why this recipe has received all its rave reviews--it's wonderful. It has everything going for it: terrific taste, easy to make, and a wonderful company dish. One of my very favorite recipes.

The recipe is very easy and wonderful. I used gorgonzola and prosciutto as substitutions.

I used blue cheese & deli ham(as someone else suggested)but sliced the breast thin, rolled it & pinned together w/ toothpicks. The cheese didn't leak out on the grill. Only about 35 people got to try this - apparently I didnt make enough! I used almost 15 lbs. of chicken! I will definetly make this again!!

Made this last night and I was amazed at the ease of preparation. The finished product was fabulous! Use more cheese than necessary (if you like a lot) because I found I lost quite a bit during the cooking process. All in all, a big hit around here!

I made this recipe for guests and used prosciutto and saga blue cheese. It was fantastic! Rave reviews and it appeared much more difficult than it really was. Loved it!

Top notch and easy. Excellent for low-carb diets. Simple ingrediants that are in the kitchen at all times. Substituted regular blue cheese for the Saga and used deli ham. Definatley use no salt butter or it will get too salty. If you have an extra burner on a gas grill, it can all be made there. I will make it again.
