Little bit on the bland side when made w/ 2% milk, so keep to whole or cream. Also, the smokiness in the salmon must add flavor. I used leftover baked salmon to only mediocre results. Points for easy and decent use of leftovers.

I love this recipe. I have been making it for years. I have served this to several friends and clients, always a hit. Sometimes less is more....

We love this dish! The simple distinct flavors work really well together. For everyday/budget dinners we use chicken sauteed with herbs instead of salmon.

This sauce was very bland despite trying the variations suggested by other cooks. I have had variations of this dish in restaurants and loved it but this sauce basically just heavy cream and a couple spices is not tasty at all.

Took others' suggestions, using sauteed fresh salmon, adding grape tomatoes, lots of ground pepper, and extra crushed red pepper flakes. We thought it was delicious, and so easy my husband prepared it on his own. Kind of nifty cooking the pasta and asparagus together. An easy and tasty new supper for the repertoire.

We made this for a dinner party and were really happy with the results. It came together in a jiffy and tasted wonderful. Next time I'll use another reviewer's suggestion of adding tomatos.

I made this dish with cut up pieces of pan seared fresh salmon, dried dill, fresh asparagus and substituted 1/2 Tbl of wasabi (what we had on hand)instead of horseradish. It turned out delicious and we would definately make it again.

This recipe just didn't come together for me. The sauce was bland and didn't thicken. I didn't add nuts or sundried tomatoes - that might have made the difference. This is the first receipe I've tried from epicurious that I would not recommend.

Made this recipe on a whim with items in the pantry. The smoked salmon I used gave the dish a bitter taste. Next time I'll try shrimp (an idea stolen from a similar Epicurious recipe. I added sundried tomatoes; I can't imagine the dish without them. Skip canned asparagus and only use fresh. I tried to substitute, but the stalks just fell apart.

My dad and I made this recipe with a smoked salmon that he had gotten for Christmas. I would definately recomend making this recipe. It was delicious and extremely quick. We added a few things to it though and it turned out really nice. We added some capers, sundried tomatoes, and pine nuts with the pasta and used the suggestion of half and half instead of heavy cream. It was wonderful. We might try it next time with a few other variations but I would definately make this again. Even my mom enjoyed it and she doesn't like fish!

It was simple and easy and fast, but I added crumbled bacon and deglazed the pan with afew talblespoons of vermouth before adding the cream mixture. Didn't have fettuccine and used angel hair pasta which was just as good.

Wanted to try something different - and here it was. I wasn't able to find fresh Dill, so I had to use dry. The smoked Salmon was quite salty and was the only drawback to the recipe. I will try it again, and use something other than smoked salmon. I don't believe this is good for 4 people either, as it would just be enough if all received a small portion. Better suited for 3, as long as nobody wanted seconds!

I thought this dish was very yummy. Definitely easy to make! The smoked salmon I used was overly salty, so I will simply use a different brand next time. My husband suggested using something other than egg noodles, as that seemed to make the dish heavier.

This recipe is great--easy and, if you use fat-free half-n-half--reasonably good for you. I would recommend that you let the whole thing "rest" for five-10 minutes. It tastes much better once the flavors meld.

Incredibly easy and quite tasty. I think this dish is really just 2 servings if you're using it as a main dish, maybe 3, but deffinitely not four. I enjoyed it very much.

My husband and I loved this. I did make a big adjustment. Since I wanted to avoid all the cream, I used 1 cup of Land 'O Lakes Fat Free Half and Half. Because if this, I added the pasta and cooked for a few extra minutes before adding the asparagus and smoked salmon. This ended up being a tasty and low fat meal.

This has become a quick and easy favorite for entertaining. I've substituted egg noodles and it works well.

Easy and very good. Suggest that one adds a little cooking liquid or some dry vermouth or white wine.

Not bad. The horseradish added a nice zing. A bit dry though, I'd reserve a half cup of pasta cooking water to add if needed.
