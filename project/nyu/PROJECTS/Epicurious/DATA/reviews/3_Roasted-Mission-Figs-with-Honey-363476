Made this last night for 6 people and a couple of boxes of California figs, one green and one black. Quite delicious and very easy. Everybody really liked it. The figs and honey combination is, of course, classic Mediterranean. I wasn't sure about the cinnamon, but that ended up being OK. Will definitely make again.
