I really like this recipe, especially to create a pasta tossed with some fresh summer veggies. I also really like garlic. I think you have to know your own palette and adjust accordingly. I love the amount of garlic, but it may be too much for some people. I think that the recipe is only as good as what you pair it with. It is not going to rescue your overdone chicken breast. But, this recipe did single-handedly changed my bf's mind about avocados. He went from hate to love and for that I am forever grateful.

i do not recommend this recipe. i had it over pasta and though it's a nice idea the flavors just don't work.

I used 2 avacados, and reduced the garlic (as per some of the suggestions). The sauce was good, but was a bit too tangy for what I was hoping for.

Yes, 1 too many cloves of garlic for me. Mix w/mayo for a veggie sandwich or a great shrimp dip. I liked the "raw" nature of it on grilled chicken but my husband disliked it.

The only thing that I changed in this recipe was the oil to grape seed oil. One could add more basil but we liked it just the way I made it. I found it light and refreshing over pasta.

Did anyone else think there was too much garlic in this?? I agree that I would add more basil. It kind of disappeared. Also, I substituted olive oil instead of vegetable, and veggie broth for chicken. I love avocados, and was really excited about this idea, but the recipe as it is didn't really work out.

The only thing I changed was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and adding about another cup of basil. I served this over linguine and it was delicious. It was creamy and tangy--a great variation on regular basil pesto which can get dry. I served it alongside balsamic chicken and the contrasting tastes complemented each other nicely. Highly recommended!

I modified this and found it perfect. Try it. AVOCADO SAUCE Pour over grilled chicken breasts or fish (I recommend halibut, salmon or monkfish) for six. Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less not including cooling of the broth. 1 medium avocado, peeled, halved 1/4 cup (or more) vegetable stock* 1tpsp parsely or 1/2 tbsp basil for chicken, omit entirely for fish 2 tbsp minced spanish onion 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil 2 pinches of natural coarse sea salt Blend all ingredients until chopped, scraping down sides as needed. With machine running, gradually add oil and blend until smooth. If too thick, gradually add more broth by tablespoons. Chill immediately after preparing until ready for plating. * Vegetable stock: Chop one celery stalk, half of a carrot, half of an onion, 1 clove of garlic, 3 pepper corns, combine in medium sauce pan and bring to boil in 2 cups of water. Simmer gently for 30 mins, remove all solids and chill. Any leftovers make incredible soup & sauce bases as well as an excellent liquid for making rice. This stock can be frozen until needed for up to a month.

This was terrific over some lightly sauteed broccoli with garlic and linguine. I thought the tanginess from the lime and the creaminess of the avocado really combined to make a very satisfying and well rounded flavor.

Make sure the oil is olive and substitute vegetable broth for the chicken. OK - so now it's a different recipe! It tastes great over chicken -over seafood? Nah - especially if you use chicken broth.

No, no, no. I thought this would be strange and wonderfull but, alas, it was not. It was wildly overpowering, but in a bad way. Perhaps I shouldn't have served it with roasted salmon as I did, but I still could not imagine it working with even a lightly grilled chicken breast. I did think it looked fantastic on the plate though.

good ingredients, but kind of a weird outcome. I tried to serve it over a simply grilled whitefish. possibly it would be better on pasta, but it wasn't my favorite blend of flavors.

I was afraid that adding crabmeat to this sauce would make it richer than it already is, but it didn't....it was wonderful!! Definitely a must for avocado lovers.

I used browned the garlic (6 cloves instead of 4) in olive oil before blending it in and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I mixed the pesto with linguine, sauteed summer squash, fresh green beans, orange and yellow peppers, and fresh halved cherry tomotaoes. I *HIGHLY* recommend this recipe :)

Tried this at the last minute due to a love of avacados and a need to use basil. Very easy to make and good on grilled chicken.
