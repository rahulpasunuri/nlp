I agree with the last reviewer--it's a ham steak, kinda hard to mess it up, even if your boyfriend takes over for you and asks, "how long has it been cooking" and you just sip your wine and shrug your shoulders and the ham steak mysteriously ends up a bit dry. It's good and always fun to set your food on fire for a bit.

Tastes great, but its nothing to bowl you over. Then again its exactly what you'd expect from a ham steak.

A ham steak is an easy and quick dinner, and this elevates it into something special. You do not necessarily have to have bourbon. You can use brandy, or without the flabe with white wine. Frankly, chicken stock will work as well to deglaze the pan. You can even take it further by sauteeing chopped shallots and then adding a small bit of flour and striiring until nutty and then slowly adding liquid. this can even be strained and then caraway can be included in the cream sauce. Or just make as shown here! I do like something like a dollop of saurekraut on the side as a condiment, or pickled onions and some good grainy mustard. Macaroni and cheese is classic to go with this. Some good warm brown bread is nice, too. Sparkling Apple cider is nice to drink with this, and the hard versions are nice for adults. for dessert, apples or peaches, fresh with sugar or sauteed over vanilla ice cream with oatmeal or pecan cookies creates a total menu.

This is a great recipe - wonderful, earthy flavors in the sauce. It's actually quite quick and easy too. I paired it with mashed yams mixed with crushed pineapple and orange juice (another very southern combo that's lowfat) and the fruity flavor combined nicely with the earthy, almost smoky flavor of the bourbon sauce on the ham. Every one loved it!

I quite enjoyed this one, very simple to make. I was nervous while tasting the sauce during cooking as I didn't like it all that much, but paired with the ham it really works... I cubed my ham steak cooked as directed and the put it back in the sauce and served it coated with the sauce. Oh and I didn't flame it just boiled it way down...

It's rare that a dish this simple tastes so uncommonly good. Do keep the pan lid handy incase you need help controlling the flame.

This was a huge disappointment... we made it exactly as directed, and it was a completely flavorless sauce. We threw it away.

We have made this several times- almost burning the house down in the process- and it's always worth it. I highly recommend this recipe.

as the head note states: booze, pigs, and fire. FIRE! get ready for it, the bourbon is exaggerated in this recipe because it adds a great amount of flavor. Eat well!

As others have noted, a huge flame flare, so be prepared for it. I was actually mistaken in thinking I had bourbon on hand and substituted a nicely aged Scotch Whiskey....very good!

Didn't bother flaming the bourbon, as it all but evaporated when added to the hot pan. Very good, complex flavor. A good, quick weeknight dinner.

Sauce is kneebuckling good! Caveat: Flame bourbon off heat (outdoors if possible) A quarter cup of Jack Daniels makes a HUGE flame.

This is a very easy, fast recipe. It's a very delicious sauce for the ham. I agree with the other reviewers - the flame was high and took some time to die down, but I will definitely make this again.

Yummy sauce, but cook from Weston is right. Scary flare-up. Maybe boil down the bourbon first?

OK flavor but way too much bourbon. This produced a HUGE flare.
