We love this breakfast. Quick and easy and leftovers to toast during the week for quick breakfasts. I use the Cuisinart Griller to make them -- and get 8 square waffles. One thing I like about this recipe is that there is no vegetable oil in it. These are also great without the bananas and topped with honey or maple syrup.

I'm not going to rate this as it was my first time making waffles -- just got the waffle plates for the Cuisinart Griller -- however they turned out great for me. Could have been a little crisper but I think that is because I should have left them cook for another minute. Taste and texture was great -- next time will do the bananas as well. Oh, and I used milk with lemon as a substitute for buttermilk in the recipe.

These were great. I only had plain soymilk on hand and used it successfully instead of buttermilk. Skipped the bananas... it's a great basic waffle recipe!

The caramelized bananas were good, but they tend to lose their integrity after cooking. And the waffles were a little more cakey and a little dry--a minus for a recipe with so much butter. And they didn't turn out as crispy as I like, though that admittedly could be from my (new) waffle iron. If I do this again, I think I will try to find some ripe plantains, and then add a little salt in with the carmelizing sugar. For the waffles, I will probably just use the recipe I've had since I was a kid and add toasted pecans and a hint of cinnamon. So I suppose I would do it again, but not with this recipe.

Have made these twice - in two weeks! - and my family loves them. Followed the recipe exactly the first time (though cut the sugar and butter down for the bananas) and made it again this morning, skipping the banana part and instead carmelizing an apple. A very fine recipe.

As it is summer and tree fruits are finally here, I tried the waffle batter only, accompanied by oj dressed white peaches, whipped cream and organic cranberry infused maple syrup, divine! As suggested by other reviewers, I added zest of one small orange, plus 2 tbsp light brown sugar and about 1/3 cup of extra buttermilk to thin the batter so it would settle into the deep cups in my belgian waffle iron. It is important to chop the pecans finely, as large chunks were distracting in the finished waffles. My two brunch guests voted this one a keeper.

My husband has asked that I make these again. SO good, better waffles than a mix and the bananas are simply awesome. I didn't have buttermilk so I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to milk and mixed it well. Very very good! We used whipped cream as a topping.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans as I didn't have enough pecans. My kids wanted to sprinkle chocolate chips on the finished waffles rather than the bananas. We also toasted the nuts before adding them to the recipe. We will definitely make again!

These waffles were incredible. For health reasons I can't use milk so I used apple sauce instead. The waffles came out perfect. The bananas were unbelievable. Will make again and again!

These are the best waffles I have ever eaten -- I made them for an office breakfast and they were fantastic! Definitely toast the pecans -- it adds a real depth of flavor. I didn't make the bananas but they were perfect with real maple syrup.

Easy, delicious dish. I added a little bit of sugar to the waffles, because that's the way we are, but it was quick enough to make for a family breakfast and different enough to make it special. Hopefully your guests won't be screaming and running around like my eaters ... we have a Mickey Mouse waffle maker, and if Mickey turns out missing an ear or something you would think THE CHILD lost a limb - oh the drama. However, the waffles & bananas TASTED great and were eaten.

My family absolutely loved this recipe and still raves about it. It made my Mother's Day Breakfast for the women in my family oh so special. It has now become one of my staples when trying to impress breakfast guests!

The bananas were great but I didn't really think the waffles were good at all. I took the advice of other reviewers and added cinnamon and vanilla but even that didn't make the waffles anything special. They were basically nothing more than a vehicle for the really yummy bananas. I would find a different waffle recipe for next time.

I am now a butter waffle convert and will never use oil again in my waffles. These are really delicious, easy and will use the standard waffle batter recipe as a staple in my collection. Coming from one of the grande dames of foodies. Bananas are excellent, added a bit of real maple syrup at the end. Yum.

Fantastic recipe. The carmelized bananas are excellent. I tripled the recipe to feed 4 people. Omitted pecans and added vanilla and cinnamon. The results were great. Everyone raved. Perhaps I'm a slow cook, but it took me over half an hour to make enough waffles and carmelized bananas to feed four people.

I used this recipie for the carmelized bananas and put them atop "overnight french toast" from this site. The bananas made the dish! Thank you.

this was my first time making waffles and it was so easy and the results were great. I added vanilla and cinnamon (thanks for the comments) and substituted milk for the buttermilk, ommited the baking powder and put in more butter. Solid recipe. I think next time i would try macadamia nuts or try it without. The bananas were beyond compare!

This is a great waffle recipe. Others that I have made in the past are too fluffy and don't hold much heat. These are hearty enough to stay nice and warm, but aren't too heavy. The pecans are delicious, even if you don't have time to toast them. I've made them twice now. I double the recipe and freeze the extra waffles. They defrost quickly and taste great out of the toaster oven !

Great recipe - easy, too. Added a little cinnamon & freshly ground nutmeg to the dry ingredients. Also sliced the bananas in smaller pieces, and sprinkled brown sugar over the melted butter before sauteeing (instead of rolling them in white sugar), and then added a touch of vanilla to finish. YUM! A great Easter morning brunch!

Excellent! I added cinnamon and vanilla to the waffles also. Would have preferred not-so-thick batter but overall good!

DELICIOUS!!! I made this for my husband and he loved it but I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, the first time, and the second time I made it I added these ingredients and a 1/2 cup of coconut and topped it with toasted coconut. They were AWESOME!!!

I have to confess: I got all set to make this recipe and then realized I'd forgotten to buy a couple of key ingredients at the grocery store, so I wound up mixing the pecans into Aunt Jemima waffle mix. Good, but probably not as good as the original. I did make the banana topping, though, which was fantastic. I agree that these don't need much honey or syrup - a little of the caramel from the banana pan goes a long way.

I don't like bananas so I didn't make that part of the recipe. I loved the pecan waffles though. They are not a fluffy as most waffle recipes I've tried but they are not dense either. They don't even need any syrup - good plain. I plan to bring my waffle iron and the recipe this winter on our ski trip.

This was very good. However, I didn't think the "waffle part" was outstanding. I will make again, but use a different recipe for the waffles. The banana topping was really good. Doesn't need much honey.

I made this dish for my husband for Father's Day. He loved it, but even though he has about the sweetest tooth I've ever encountered, he had to leave off the honey as the bananas were plenty sweet. He suggested I just slice up some uncooked bananas next time. I am not a fan of bananas so I had the pecan waffles with maple syrup. Delicious! Any suggestions for lowering the fat, though? Six tablespoons!!

Delicious!! I made these waffles for my family one Saturday morning. My mother was the first to try them. She raved about the taste. (I thought she was being kind). My sister tasted them and she loved them as well. When I tasted the waffles I whole heartedly agreed with my family's critique and I knew this recipe was a keeper. The toasted pecans really made a difference. The waffles were light and flavorful. I'm a banana lover, however after carmelizing them they were a little too soft for my taste. I give these waffles two thumbs up!
