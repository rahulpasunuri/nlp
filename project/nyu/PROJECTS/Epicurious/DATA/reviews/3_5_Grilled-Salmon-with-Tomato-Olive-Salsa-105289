I used the ingredients, but changed the recipe a lot by cooking everything. I was just in the mood for a hot sauce instead of a cold salsa. So, I started by sauteing the shallot (I substituted red onion), then added the garlic and tomatoes and simmered for 15 minutes. I then added the capers, olives and finally basil and served on top of salmon fillets. It was absolutely delicious and will definitely become a staple.

This recipe was so easy and surprising! I topped with a lemon yogurt sauce. Next time (and there WILL be a next time), I'd cut down on most of the olive oil in the salsa, as there is so much oil in the fish... With cannelloni beans (cooked with garlic, basil, and red wine) on the side, it was a perfect weeknight meal!!

Delicious. Used fresh produce from farmers' market. Substituted regular tomatoes for plum tomatoes. Chop, let rest to drain, and reduce olive oil in salsa to 2 T. Substituted 2 T sweet onion for shallots. Lemon cream a must.

I thought the salsa was awful. The flavors were unbalanced and didn't come together (to my surprise, considering the ingredients and the rave reviews). I had to move to plan B for the salmon the night I made it, but salvaged the salsa later by adding balsamic vinegar, which completely married the flavors and made it delicious.

Fabulous. Cedar smoked the salmon on grill. Didn't have basil, so used 2 frozen cubes of homemade pesto and no oil. Perhaps add more garlic and olives - needed a little more pop in salsa. Served with orzo tossed with pesto and grilled zucchini. 'Very good dear', said the husband. Will make again.

This is a great summer recipe -- quick, easy, colorful and delicious! We made it exactly as written except that we broiled the salmon -- with the temperature hovering near 100 degrees it was just too hot to grill!

OUT OF THIS WORLD. I made this exactly as the recipe called, we had our first bbq a few weeks ago with friends from out of town. Everyone raved about this. I only added extra garlic and capers as I am a fan of these.

Fabulous dish. To shortcut prep time on the sauce, I bought pico de gallo [from Baja Fresh, but Trader Joe's or any other freshly made (not canned) tomato salsa will work], and added the capers, garlic and basil. Didn't need the shallot--there were already onions in the pico.

Excellent! Simple. Salsa is a nice complement and basil permeates the tomato.

We eat a lot of grilled salmon and this is a great addition to the ways to change it up a bit especially when the garden is full of fresh tomatoes and basil. Will definitely make again and next time will try the lemon cream that other reviewers seemed to enjoy.

This recipe was fabulous. The capers kicked it up a notch, and I added some sun-dried tomatoes to the regular tomatoes. Really tasty.

I hav e tried this dish a few times and this is also easy to change up as well -some marinated green olives work well - minced sun dried tomatoes - added some roasted red peppers - all have been delicious. Also I found that salmon is not prerequisite for this - works well with chicken and other fish like tuna and swordfish.

Simple and delicious. The key is fresh summer tomatoes. For the chef that said it was too oily - 2 of the 6 T of oil were for the fish.

This is a fabulous recipe. I did it on an inclement winter day when grilling didn't seem appealing and broiled the salmon. My husband gave it his review: "You can do this again--really!"

I made this dish for a group of friends and family. The smell, the colors and flavors of this dish was incredible. It is so easy to make that anyone not willing to try it is making a big mistake. It was a definite winner!

Very nice! You definitely don't want to overdue the capers or they will take over the dish. Simple, interesting....this was great.

I'm not sure how to make this dish any better; it was that good. I will say that I cut the capers down by about a third. I love capers, but too many can over-power subtle flavors of other ingredients. I thought this recipe called for a few too many of those strange tiny balls; reducing the amount made the salsa taste just right. And that cream sauce should be considered an essential!

A delicious and creative change for salmon dishes to add for our weekly menu. I broiled the salmon instead due to weather and halved the olive oil in the salsa, just enough to coat. (The prep work for the salsa took the most time). Lots of flavor and color. The lemon cream sauce just adds to the yummy dish even more.

Salsa was too oily and combination was just not right. The fish was also kind of strong (maybe a bit old?) so that contributed to the problem. I usually like all these flavors, but somehow this just didn't work.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it for family and friends, who all requested the recipe, and have since made it for their family and friends to rave reviews. Using plum tomatoes is best, since other types may be too juicy...I took another reviewers advice and used the left over the next day in an omelet. It was wonderful!

Did not like salsa combination with salmon, the flavors did not compliment each other. The salsa would go better with beef.
