I used baby artichokes and must have had more volume because I needed more broth to cook them. So I skipped the reduction of the 2 extra cups of broth and just removed the artichokes and reduced the cooking liquid - then blended that with some of the artichokes. Only used 3 Tbsp of butter. Everyone loved it.

This took more time than I anticipated. I had never worked with fresh artichokes before so that was an experience. I served quinoa with the salmon and artichoke hearts which balanced it out nice. The over all result was fantastic and my very picky other half thought it was fabulous but getting there took about 4+ hours. Just be sure you have enough time to make this.

Simplicity is generally its own reward, and this recipe looked worrisome at first. But after studying it / cooking it, I was converted. I ran short of olive oil and used avocado (grapeseed is great as well!)oil in a 50/50 mix, and it turned out WONDERFUL. This is worth the effort!
