Nothing to write home about. There are many other cornish hen recipes which are better on this website. Very plain.

I had to switch beet greens for Swiss chard, but I was able to get juniper berries. We really liked the foresty flavor that the berries added. I'd make this again.

This is an interesting dish with unusual flavors. When I'm particularly adventurous, I foresee that I will be making it again. This is a great recipe to show off with, if you have the time and energy to locate juniper berries and quality pancetta.

i drove 20 minutes trying to locate juniper berries, only to discover they are a bit too perfumey for my taste. the combination of flavors of beet greens, pancetta and juniper berries, was overpowering and foreign. i was expecting a comfort food experience.
