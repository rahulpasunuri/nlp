I used Fuji apples and brown sugar Splenda, which has actual brown sugar plus Splenda so it cuts down on the sugar while still being OK for baking. I added a lot of extra spice, pecans, and vanilla to the apples. For the topping I used whole wheat flour plus oats and the brown sugar splenda. I used less butter than called for because 2 sticks is unnecessary. I served it with Fage greek yogurt mixed with cinnamon and molassas. A few months ago I made the Caramel Apple Crisp on this site and preferred it to this one. This is a good recipe, but 2 cups of sugar and 2 sticks of butter is a bit crazy for my health conscious household.

Best Apple Crisp ever! I added 1/2 cup apple cinnamon oatmeal and 1/2 cup walnuts to the topping. Also used Mcintosh apples instead of granny smith.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! I used about a cup of rolled oats in the topping which added a nice crunchy texture. Although butter always makes everything taste better, I definitely don't think it needs two sticks! Next time I will cut it in half. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup of white, it was still very sweet. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar as well. Overall - delicious!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to only use 1 stick of butter. I used the full amount of sugar, but decided after eating it that it is too sweet. I also added a few different spices (nutmeg and allspice), and I added rolled oats to the topping. Overall, it's a solid recipe that I will make again.

I'm glad I read the other reviews, but I changed this recipe so much that it would be hard to say how it would have tasted if I simply followed the recipe. I added 1 tbsp. lemon juice, a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice (just sounded good to me) and a sprinkle of ground giner to the apples. There was so much butter in the topping that it would have been impossible to spread without increasing the flour. I ended up using about 2.5 cups of flour and added about 0.5 cups of oats and 0.5 tsp salt to the topping. I'm making this again using the modifications, because it turned out to be delicious!

I agree with everyone that there was far too much butter. For the apples I used a mix of Fuji, Courtland, and Granny Smith, which turned out very tasty. I also added oats which helped with the butter overload. =]

Rating: 2
It was tasty out of the oven, but I agree with others who said it calls for far too much butter. I ended up with pools of melted butter (thought it was juice from the apples but not so) which caused it to reheat poorly. But fresh from the oven it is tasty, if a bit soggy.

This was a good apple crisp recipe, but I thought there was too much butter. I love to eat apple crisp cold, but there was so much butter in the topping that it congealed after it cooled and was not appealing. I will make again but cut the butter probably in half.

This is a decent recipe, and it's obscenely easy, but I just didn't think the finished product was anything to write home about. The flavors weren't very interesting. If I made it again I would add lemon juice to the filling, and a pinch of salt to the topping.

I more or less stuck to the recipe, but used Penzey's Cake Spice instead of plain ol' cinnamon - and added some extra to the apples. I also added some finely chopped crystallized ginger to the topping. All in all, it was delicious and easy to make.

Good basic recipe, but I made several changes. NO brown sugar. Sprinkle the apples with lemon juice when they are cut. Add 1 teaspoon of nutmef and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to the flour, sugar and butter topping. Great comfort food.

I have never ascertained if the weight of the apples is that of their whole self or when they are pared and cut. If it is not the whole apple, then I didn't have enough apple and it was waaay too sweet. I will cut butter and sugar almost in half next time... and weigh apples when ready to go. Added nutmeg to crisp ingredients and liked very much.

The previous review was so funny, I thought I would give it a try. I have to say, I was tempted to try her pasta recipe, but decided to stick with the apples. The only change I made was to halve the recipe because we are a small family. Next time, I'll make the whole thing because it was fabulous!

I reviewed this recipe in 2004. It's fabulous. However, people make it and don't like it because they dislike butter and sugar, and/or they add nuts and oats, many times for the same reasons. There are 100s of recipes more to your liking on this Website if the above is true. Otherwise, I'll post again: I made a few adjustments. I substituted tomatoes for apples, onions for sugar/spice, olive oil for butter, eliminated flour. Great over pasta! This is the best apple crisp I've ever had. It's unfair to make major changes and then rate it. Don't change a thing. The topping is crumbled traditional IRISH SHORTBREAD. If you don't like shortbread, butter, sugar, or cinnamon, this recipe is not for you. But, please, please, don't modify the recipe, except perhaps to mix different apples for a more complex apple flavor. Go straight back to the menu and chose from countless other recipes. If the recipe sounds good to you, don't forget the whipped cream. by A Cook from The Big Love Apple on 01/12/04 print review with recipe

I'm the only person in my family who will eat nuts (bummer for them) so to gain the extra crunch and bulk, I thew in some steel-cut oats. Pretty good, but pretty.......raw-bitz-ish (remember that bit on Prairie Home Companion?) I don't think I'll add those again, but I will make it again...

I made this recipe twice in the same week because it was so delicious and we just couldn't get enough! I used Granny Smith apples and followed the recipe as it was written although I did keep it in a warm oven for a couple of hours after it was cooked. The topping was very crisp - not gooey at all! It had a strong cinnamon flavor and my family and friends are clammoring for the recipe - which I will glady pass along! YUM!

I used half Granny Smith apples and half Fuji because that's what I had on hand, and halved the amount of butter. I also sprinkled a little ground nutmeg over the apples before adding the topping. It was the best apple crisp I've ever made. Easy, cheap and delicious, just the way we like it.

YUM! I took the advice of other reviewers and used only one stick of butter (half the amount called for). It was spectacular. The top was very crispy.

I cooked this at 475 degrees for 20 minutes, then 20 minutes at 350, and the top came out quite crispy. You can cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup if you have sweet apples. I also only used 1 2/3 sticks butter - quite good!

I was disappointed in this recipe after reading the rave reviews. The apples were fine - I used about 3/4 c. half dark brown & half raw because that is what I had in the house. I mixed the topping in my food processor - it was a gooey consistency, rather than what I would have expected - crumbly. The topping didn't cover the apples as much as I expect a crisp topping to cover. It turned out to be a very thin layer of crisp. I won't make this again, as I prefer the more traditional crisp topping with oatmeal, or a biscuit/shortbread topping with soda or baking powder. This was in between, therefore unsatisfactory IMHO.

Rating: 4
This is the best apple crisp I have ever had. When I was in college and had a large group to bake for, this was the dessert that was always requested. Quite a few requested I make this for them before they left for semesters abroad. I like to basically double the recipe, using about 5.5 lb of apples and not increasing the butter (still 2 sticks). This fits into a 13x9 inch pan very well and serves a ton of people. A little grating of nutmeg is also nice.

Rating: 3
This was quick, easy, and good. Too late to go to the store, I realized I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used a cup of organic sugar and a little extra cinnamon and it came out great. My roommate asked me to make an apple crisp, which I'd never done before, and I found this to be a pretty fool-proof recipe. Both of my roommates and I agreed that this shortbready crust is a nice departure from the oatmeal standard.

This is my go-to recipe for apple crisp. The great thing about it is, it takes to variation very well and is always great. Sub oats for some of the flour if you like. I usually cut the butter to 1 stick in this case (don't worry, this will not make it taste like health food!) Just and all around great and easy recipe for a classic.

I love apple crisp in general and this one in particular. The shortbread topping is a really interesting take on this classic dessert. I'm not sure why so many reviewers felt the need to add nuts or oatmeal to the topping. Perhaps they should have used (and reviewed) one of the thousands of recipes that include those ingredients. For me, this is perfect as presented. Crisps by their very nature, are open to interpretation, so of course this is great with the addition of cardamom, cloves, nutmeg or lemon juice. A variety of apples may be used, and the topping is great on other fruit fillings. I make the topping in a food processor and usually double or triple the recipe and store the extra in the freezer, saving myself a step the next time I prepare it.

I made this last night for my wife and me. It is fantastic, and I too added some oatmeal to the topping. As for those of you that feel you must discredit someone who modifies a recipe, would you do that to your mom or grandmother?

It's hard to mess up an apple crisp, but this was a disaster. The portions of the ingredients for what should've been a crumble topping are off (2 sticks is way too much butter!) It created a dough-like "batter" rather than a "cornmeal" consistency. I will not be using this recipe again because it was a waste of my time and money!

Rating: 4
Much better topping than the usual oatmeal mixture. Very rich but SO worth it. All depends on the quality and taste of the apples you use, but even old, mealy and too-sweet fruit comes out great. Tip: Use lots of lemon juice on the apples if they aren't perfect, and they'll taste terrific in this.

The only apple crisp recipe I ever use. I have to agree with the cook from the big love apple, the topping is a shortbread, not oatmeal.

probably not fair for me to review this recipe, since I made a half batch, with mangoes (and nutmeg and cinnamon) instead of apples, added leftover walnuts to the crust, and put in maybe 1/2 the amount of sugar called for. so I can't speak to the recipe as written, BUT the topping was lovely and the amount of time in the oven was just right. a very yummy and versatile starter recipe for those who have different kinds or amounts of fruit around the house.

I've made this a couple of times, and it has turned out great each time. I leave the recipe exactly as it is, especially the apples. Using a sweeter apple will indeed make this too sweet a dessert. Sour Granny Smiths are definitely the way to go. I also don't mess with the topping, as it is simple and a nice foil for the tang of the apples. If I was making this with a sweeter fruit [like Saskatoon berries], I would certainly use oats and perhaps pecans.

Rating: 1
I was expecting much better from all the great reviews!Since it's the first time I tried the recipe, I followed it exactly. First of all, the baking time is too long. The apples were definitely overcooked even though I took them out early.The topping was bland, although I should have expected that from the ingredients-it would benefit from chopped walnuts or pecans. It was also too sweet and this is from someone who loves desserts! I usually don't agree when people say that about some desserts, but I think the sugar could be cut back by half-you could hardly taste the apples. Some fresh lemon juice would have been a good thing in the apples before the topping is added. Overall, you can find much better crisp recipes. The only thing good about this recipe was its easy list of ingredients.

I have made alot of crisps with all types of fruits. Its one of my favorite desserts. This one was the worst. I found it to be an overly sweet and buttery mess that turned to mush. Too long cooking time or too high temp for first 20 min.I slice the apples extra thick so they have enough texture but these practically turned to apple sauce. So many unbelievable crisp recipes out there to fool with this one again. I guess I should not have given it one fork. All the other reviewers seemed to like it though. Oh,well!

WONDERFUL RECIPE--a real keeper--simple,too. Everyone loved it ala mode. I used five pounds of assorted apples instead of 3.5 (because they really tend to shrink down after baking) and I combined the butter, flour and sugar in the food processor (instead of using a pastry cutter or fingers as suggested in the recipe) This was a real time saver. Recipe cooked beautifully in the amount of time indicated in the recipe.

Very simple. Cur the brown sugar down to 1/4 or 1/2-i used gala apples and they were very sweet. Cut butter mixture to 1 1/2 sticks, add 1/2 cup oatmeal mixture to flour mixture and cut flour down by about 1/4 to 1/2 cup-perfect. The hardest part was peeling those apples. Use large apples-it's easier than small ones. I made this for my diabetic father-in-law and he loved it! Really easy

This is a good basic recipe which I modified by making a hazelnut/walnut crust first, the recipe I found here on this website. Then I tossed the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg and 1-2 T of brandy before adding them to the pan with the cooled crust. I then added crushed walnuts (or hazelnuts) to the topping for added flavor and texture. The brandy gave the apples a rich flavor without making the crust soggy; the crust was delicious and the topping turned out excellent. My friends were wildly impressed.

Rating: 3
This was pretty popular. It wasn't all that crispy, but that is because my butter wasn't cold enough. The flavors were great. I coated the apple slices with lemon juice to keep them from browning, and that made the apple slices nice and sour. I didn't reduce the sugar because of the added acid.

I gave this recipe four forks with the changes I made. I used 1/2 of the sugars as suggested by previous reviewers (especially since I was using Ginger Gold apples), substituted 1/2 the flour for oats, used 1/2 the butter, added nutmeg & clove powder to the apples and added chopped pecans to the topping.

Very good! I served this as a side dish on a buffet and got lots of favorable comments. I used a combo of Granny Smith, Gala, and Braeburn apples, cut back a bit on the sugars, used 1 stick of butter along with oats and pecans for the topping. This recipe seems to stand up to most reasonable changes depending on your taste for more or less sweetness and/or butter. I was very happy with the changes that I made, but am tempted to try it without changing anything but the combination of apples. Using all GS apples might be a bit too uninteresting for me. I will definately make this again. Enjoy!!

This is delicious crisp! I used Jonagold apples with a couple Granny Smith to add a little tartness. I made this dish twice with no sugar at all with the apples (just cinnamon) - it definitely doesn't need any, at least using mainly Jonagolds. Made the topping as the recipe says - I think it'd be a shame to change a thing. I used frozen butter and made it in the food processor. That way, it was very fast. Be prepared to eat the crisp within 24 hours or the topping will not be crisp anymore. (I made the topping, refrigerated half of it, and made two half batches so they'd be fresh.) This would be great with peaches too. I will make again & again!

I wish I'd read the reviews before making this. It was far too rich and sweet for me; should have halved butter and sugar. I had about a half cup of the stuff, but unfortunately, the rest is going down the drain. But then again, I'm not much of a desert person anyway, just thought I'd give it a try.

Very simple recipe! Thanks to the cook who recommended the cutting down of sugar and substituting oats for half the flour, I tried it and it tasted amazing. Substituted Macintosh's instead of Granny Smiths and it still turned out fine! For a first try at an Apple Crisp, I couldn't have been more pleased.

We just came back from Apple picking and I had a whole assortment of Apples to choose from. It was delicious served warm with some vanilla ice cream. I did not change a thing.

It is apple harvest here in Germany, delicious fresh apples. I used apples that are both sweet and tart at the same time. Cut the sugar and butter in half. Used cinnamon as recommended, halfed flour and added oats,raisins and nuts which definately enhanced the dish. My husband loved it and asked me to make it again the next day. It is quickly put together and for people who love that apple cinnamom flavor it is a keeper.

I made the crisp per the suggestions to decrease sugars and butter to one-half and added approx. 1/8 tsp. ground cloves and approx. 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice to the apples. I also added approx. 3/4 cup fresh (frozen, but not thawed)cranberries to the apple mixture, and approx. 1 cup of quick oatmeal to the flour mixture. I must say it was awesome--I brought it over to a friend's home and served it warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Adults and kids both loved it! Thanks all for the great suggestions for improving the recipe.

Based on other comments I reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced butter to 1 stick, and reduced flour to 1/2 cup but added 1/2 cup oats. DELICIOUS! made several times and always get rave reviews.

This recipe benefits from a few changes, such as halving the butter & sugar amounts & adding a little lemon juice to the apples. To the cook who left out the brown syrup gathered at the bottom of the apple mixture...that's the best part. JAKE

This recipe was great. I prepared the apples the way this recipe suggests and then used the topping from the "Apple Walnut Crisp" recipe. It's very sweet and gooey--which is a change from the way I usually cook. This would be a good recipe to prepare for a potluck.

A solid apple crisp recipe, popular among the party guests. I halved the brown sugar, though next time, I may try reducing it to 1/3 c. I halved the white sugar, though next time, I will try using 3/4 c sugar and maybe some oats to give the crumbs slightly more substance? There was quite a bit of brown syrup at the bottom of the pan, so to avoid that, make sure you put the apples in the pan without any of the liquid that may be sitting at the bottom of the bowl.

I did not like this recipe. I followed what one reviewer suggested, to decrease the brown sugar in the bottom-it came out sour. Even with reduced cinnamon, it is overpowering with cinnamon. The apples become unappealing when they are so brown from the cinnamonm

I've made many Apple Crisps before but this one was one of the best! It's also one of the easier recipes. I will definitely be keeping this one!

This is a simple recipe to put together. I made it as a quick dessert for last minute dinner guests and everyone loved it! I'm use to using white sugar with the apples and brown sugar in the crisp topping; so this was a a different take on apple crisp. I added 1 cup of oatmeal to the "crisp" topping and 1/2 tsp. ground cloves to the apple mixture to spice it up a bit.

Rating: 3
This is unlike any crisp I've ever had. The brown sugar bakes down into a sort of caramel. It is VERY sweet and could almost be an ice cream topping. I successfully cut the recipe down to a fourth, using a couple of Braeburns, a pie plate, and baking for about 30 minutes total. Really easy with that super-short ingredient list.

I made this with some apples from the tree in my backyard. (Don't ask me what kind they are). It was pretty simple to make, and very tasty. I brought some in to work and gave some to a friend. He now requests it every time we have a potluck.

This is an easy & excellent recipe. I've made it twice now & I've cut the butter from 2 sticks to 1 1/2. It made the top more crumbly rather than buttery. It's a great dish to prep & bring to a party. All you have to do it bake it and everyone's impressed!

Everyone raved over this recipe which I served with whipped cream. Adding walnuts may give it more crunch. A memory-maker!

Don't substitue a thing (maybe add some Macs). The short bread topping makes the dish. Best crisp ever. If you are worried about the butter and sugar content just try to eat less ;). Easy recipe. My husband wanted to omit much of the butter and sugar. I said to him why not paint it green and call it a vegetable if he did. Enjoy! (Don't forget the whipped cream.)

i used gala instead of granny smith as they are myfavorite apples to bake with. i find they havve the perfect balance of tart and sweet. the best to use are the ones that are about half yellow and half red. also added some oatmeal to the topping. was wonderful this way!!

Rating: 3
This was great! I didn't use Granny Smith, though. I used a sweeter apple - I have no idea what it's called. I baked it almost as long as called for and it was perfect. Baking it so long carmelized the sugar around the edges. Next time I will use more apples and try some oatmeal in the topping. Maybe a little Calvados, too!

This recipe is a party in your mouth. I originally made this recipe exactly as written and found that it was, while completely delicious, too buttery and sugary even for me, the butter/sugar queen. So the next time I used only 1 stick of butter and cut both sugars to just over 1/2 cup (like many of the other reviews) and it is divine. This simple recipe is my fave apple crisp yet.

Rating: 4
This crisp was absolutely fabulous. I am not a cook so it was easy.

Rating: 2
I didn't make the recipe as written... I tried the modified recipe recommended by several reviewers (granny smiths and half the sugars) and it was way too tart for my taste. I will try it again, using a less tart apple and maybe 3/4 of the brown sugar. The topping came out fine with 1/2 the butter, half the sugar and a split between quick oats and flour.

Rating: 3
I made a half-version of this that baked much, much quicker than the recipe called for, which made me curious: Is the full version really supposed to cook for 20 minutes PLUS another 30 minutes at a lower temp or 20 minutes plus another 10 minutes for 30 minutes total? Haven't tried it yet, but smells heavenly.

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. To take it over the top, sprinkle apples with 1 teaspoon each of orange peel & lemon peel. Drizzle the apples with 1 ounce of Grand Marnier & 1 ounce of Amaretto. MMM! Oh! I cut the brown sugar to just 1/4 cup & the butter to 1 stick.

I cut the sugars and cinnamon in half and used Granny Smith apples. Very good, not to sweet but will add oatmeal to the topping next time.

I read the reveiws first(as always). I cut the brown suger and white suger by half. Used Royal gala apples instead of granny smith. I used 1/2 cup of flour in topping but added 1 cup of oats. Did not have butter :0 had to use margerine, to my amazement this was the best apple crisp that I have ever made. Next time I will use butter to see if it is not even better. I never use margerine ecept in ginger snaps so am looking foreward to seeing how much better this dish will be.... DO TRY IT :)

I made this recipe for the first time last night. I read the reviews by others before preparing. I took the advise of others who have rated this recipe and decided to cut the sugar in half. Simple to prepare and not to time consuming which even made the outcome of the dish even that better. Recipe is definitely a keeper and an all around family pleaser.

Much too sweet. I had forgotten about the reader reviews when I made it. Next time I will cut the sugar in half and add oats and maybe walnuts to the topping. I added about a cup of blueberries, which was a nice touch and I'll do that again. Very easy.

Yea! This is exactly what I've been wanting all night! I cut the sugars in half and only used half a stick of butter and it's still really, really good! Used Fuji apples because that's what I had. Added 1/4 cup oats to topping mixture and baked in a 12 in cast iron skillet. Will try Granny Smiths next time and believe you me there will be a next time! Hey, where's my vanilla frozen yogurt?!

I also cut back on the butter and sugar, using demerara sugar in both the apples and the topping. Also added some oats to the topping mix and took Santa Barbara's hint and left the apples unpeeled. It was very good and made the house smell wonderful while it was baking in the oven. I'll make it again.

I think I've made this apple crisp at least five times, and each time I've used a different amount of butter...my personal opinion is that you can go as low as 1/4 cup (that's 1/4 of what's called for!) and still have a wonderful dish: the consistency of the topping will differ, but it really doesn't matter...it's just so good. Vanilla ice cream, definitely.

Rating: 4
Because I don't think anyone ever adds enough cinnamon, I way overdid the cinnamon, and it still came out really balanced. Also added oats (its the way my mom did it) and used brown sugar in the topping. I also cut the recipe in half, and cut down the on butter like the others said, and way cut back on all of the sugars. You can still taste every single flavor. I think the key to the balancced taste is cinnamon coating the apples instead of in the topping. I was shocked at how good this tasted, and again, how balanced all of the flavors were. I intend to use it as a hostess dish.

I halved this recipe for my husband & I using an 8" x 8" glass baking dish & 1 3/4 lbs of apples. Worked perfectly. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup & halved the topping ingredients, cutting the buttter down to 3/4 of a stick. This is one of the best & simplest crisp recipes I've ever used. In the past, the toppings I've made have been disappointingly thin & 'sandy' tasting. Must be the high proportion of butter in this one that makes such a rich crumb. A definite do-again.

Right; used only 3/4 c sugar. Sprinkled oats on top,too.Gave it extra crunch. And, didn't peel the apples. (Horrors) This is a homey, family sweet. Why peel the apples! I felt a bit bad serving it to a friend. But, he loved it with the apple peel; and, so did we.(And, the peel is good for you, too.)Will do, again. Very easy.

My father downloaded this recipe and made it per the instructions with the exception of adding 1 cup of oats.

I made this according to the recipe the first time (but only for 4 people) and found it far, far too sweet. The second time, however, I left out the brown sugar and just sprinkled a little cinnamon over the top of the apples before putting on the crumble topping. This was fab - the apples nicely tart and the topping all sweet and crunchy/chewy where the juice had soaked in. Very much better.

Wow! This was delicious and extremely well-received by my July Fourth guests. I used half Grannies and half Braeburns (7 total) and cut the brown sugar down to about 3/4 cup. Also used the food processor to cut the butter into the flour/sugar. If you have one of those apple-peeler contraptions this recipe is quick. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!

I have made this recipe again and again. It is the height of simplicity and good taste; quickly and easily assembled, it has never failed to please my guests nor my wife. Try a touch of cinnamon in the "crisp"; and I would agree with most readers you can easily cut back a touch on the butter without compliant. (But why bother? After all, its dessert!) Some hints: if you have a KA blender, chill your KitchenAid bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes, and blend the "crisp" in it quickly. It makes a great crust without the irritation. Also, split the apples into two groups, to make sure they are evenly coated, before combining them to bake.

Perfect for a lot of dinner guests. I served it (a la mode with vanilla ice cream) to 10 friends, all of whom loved it. Plus the aroma while it's baking is to die for. I followed the suggestions about less sugar and butter (I used all of the brown sugar and slightly more than a 1/4 of the white, and a little less butter) and I added a 1/2 C. of oatmeal. Plus I used half Granny Smith apples and half Cortland to mix up the taste a bit. I would highly recommend it. Make sure to slice the apples nice and thin!

Try this recipe but instead of apples, substitute a combination of pears and bananas. Serve with vanilla ice cream or yogurt. This recipe works as well with 1/4 of the butter. 1/4 cup of butter takes good for those health conscious dessert lovers out there.
