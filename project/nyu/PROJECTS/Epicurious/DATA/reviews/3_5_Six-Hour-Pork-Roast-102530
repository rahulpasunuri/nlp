Made it with a 3 pound boneless shoulder roast, cooking time was about 3.5 hours. I halved the rub, which was about right. I used dried herbs at the 1 tsp for 1 tbsp fresh conversion. It came out wonderful.

This is my no-fail recipe for dinner guests. Recently, some guests let me know that they were stuck in traffic and were going to be quite late. The roast had already been in the oven for 5 hours, so I turned it down to 175F, put a lid on the pan (used a large Le Creuset pan instead of a roasting pan) and just let it stay in the oven until my guests arrived, then took it out and let it stand until we were ready to it. Meltingly delicious - got rave reviews.

I'm always suspicious of dishes that have "4 forks" but reviewers have a laundry list of modifications. Not this recipe. It is perfect the way it is. Served it with mashed root vegetables alongside a kale, beet, and rutabaga salad and it was restaurant quality. And as long as you have a weekend afternoon to roast, it's easy. I did use a bone-in roast and it fell off the bone. Leftovers: pulled pork tacos!

We loved this -- there was only one slice of meat left! I used a pork loin (not a tenderloin) and it fell apart when carved it was so tender. Made scalloped potatoes and roast apples for accompaniements. Used white wine to deglaze pan and made a fantastic gravy as well. I reheated the last slice today for lunch and I think the meat flavor was more pronounced. Will definitely make again.

I was somewhat disappointed with this, after all the hype (and herbs). It was deliciously tender, with a perfect texture and lovely "crust", but the overall flavor of the meat was rather muted. Don't get me wrong, it was a lovely flavor, but it was definitely subtle. The house smelled great for hours while cooking it, but by no means was it overpowering. So if you're expecting your taste buds to explode, this may need some adjustment. If you're looking for a roast recipe that will tickle them instead, I think you've found it.

This is addicting - be careful or you'll eat the whole thing! Such great flavor from the rub. And like another reviewer suggested, leftovers make great additions to other meals - made hot soba soup with the pork and drippings, then a great pork and veggie stew (which came together in a flash). Worth all six hours!!

Rating: 4
Great stuff! Used an 8 1/2 lb shoulder and because I wanted to leave it without watching I added some white wine to pan, covered it with foil and roasted at 225 for 7 1/2 hours because that's how long I was gone: Falling off the bone, meltingly tender.

Rating: 4
This was the best pork roast ever. I left out the rosemary because my husband doesn't care for it, used vermouth instead of white wine and voila - perfection. I made gravy out of the drippings and it was quite salty for my taste. So I thickened it with a mixture of kuzu and water. Next time I'll remove 1/2 of the drippings before making the gravy. This is easy and I definitely will prepare again,

A marvelous recipe... Simple and absolutely delicious! I wondered at the amount (6 pound roast serving only six people) but trusted the recipe and bought TWO roasts for 9 people. The leftovers are marvelous too. The taste is divine and the aroma throughout the house while it is slow cooking all day was wonderful. I did slow-roasted red and sweet potatoes with a light coating of olive oil and chopped rosemary as one of the side dishes... put them in the oven 90 minutes before the roast would finish cooking and then raised the temperature to 400° to finish them off while the roast sat, covered with foil, resting. Next time, I'll try putting them in 2 hours before the roasting time is up and see if they are done by then.

This is not a roast to be taken out when it reaches a certain temperature..it's supposed to cook for hours, until it becomes meltingly tender - it's not a loin, which is lean. Follow the instructions, (Maybe a little more oil and wine) until it looks like a brown lump. So delicious!

Excellent recipe for a dinner party. You should watch the cooking times. In my convection oven, the two 6 lb. pork roasts were almost done in 3 hours, so I lowered the heat and let them cook slowly. The outside came out brown and delicious. I am told that one of my dinner guests got up in the middle of the night to snack on leftovers!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I use a mini-Cuisinart to make the rub and I add extra garlic. I've used this rub on beef and lamb and it's wonderful. Leftovers make a great stew.

4 forks not because it tastes good, but because it tastes good, is relatively cheap to make, and is EASY. Took 10 minutes to make the rub, stuck our 3.8 lb butt in the oven for ~4.5 hrs, and it was perfect. Made it while stuck in the house on a snowy Saturday (18" so far!!) and it kept the apartment nice and toasty, and smelling great. First meal was over garlicked Israeli couscous and steamed sugar snap peas. Tomorrow it will make a nice bbq sandwich. The rest will be pulled apart, sauteed with a little chicken broth, and served over rice. That's at least four meals out of a $14 piece of meat from our organic butcher. Not bad at all!

Delicious- really moist and the house smelled fantastic. Easy too- popped it into the oven then ran my errands and took it out in time for a great Sunday dinner. Definitely a recipe that I would make again and again.

This is an awesome pork roast. The aroma that filled the house as it was cooking was almost overwhelming. I only made two small changes. 1.) I added more garlic (about 15 cloves) and 2.)I rubbed the pork roast with Beau Monde prior to coating the pork with the herb paste. Lastly I sealed the herb encrusted pork in a food saver bag and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.

Really good and really easy! Followed exactly and will definitely make again. To the previous reviewer, the cook from Chicago, a rump roast is usually beef. Beef is pretty standard at Passover.

Rating: 4
This really was an excellent dish easy for busy weeknights. I was detained at work so it cooked 7.5 hours instead of 6. It was slightly overcooked in some spots but still delicious. The crusty edges were the best! Do make a pan sauce or gravy as it was outstanding. I reduced the salt to 1 T as other reviewers suggested. Will rub the pork the night before cooking it to bump up the flavor a bit.

I've been making this since it first appeared, tho I believe it was in BA, not Gourmet. Anyway, I live in rural southern Colorado where fresh herbs and many other common ingredients are hard to find. I've always used dried herbs and a bone-in butt.My family and guests love it evn with the dried herbs. And, although I have virtually every other herb/spice known to man, for some reason I've never used fennel seed. But, when I went to my pantry for the stuff to make this yesterday, I found that I had recently bought the seeds. The fennel was wonderful! Now, if I could only count on finding fresh rsmry and sage....By the by, to those who speak of using a loin-DON'T DO IT! The only reason this recipe works is b/c of the combo of fatty meat and low roasting temp. ( By the by-this is a roast and not a braise.)

To the cook from Dallas. This is an Italian dish not Cuban so you may have been expecting something else. This is as close to "porchetta" that I've come. My family loves this recipe.

Good, but I expected better after reading the reviews. I let sit for 15 minutes after removing from oven but could have used longer since the roast got juicier on later slices. This rub/paste is very similar to the one I use on a rump roast for Passover. Next time I think I'll use a rub or marinade with more Cuban flavor.

This was very easy to make and very yummy. The meat was so tender after all those hours of cooking. I didn't have fresh herbs the first time I made it and used dry (half). I'm making it now with fresh and I'm sure it's going to be even better. Definitely a keeper--and very nice for family or company. The crust on top looks really nice and appealing.

Haven't made this in 3 years. Too many good recipes to try and not enough time. Today I was looking for a barbecued pork roast done in the oven and not the grill. UP CAME ONE OF MY FAVORITES! Used this recipe for timing and temp. with a barbeque rub. Wow! another winner. Unless you are a "salt freak", always cut the salt in rubs, brining and roasts. Next time I am trying the orginal recipe. It's Great!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. THE KEY here is the salt issue. The past reviewer notes that some meats are presalted and "flavored" is the reason for the differences in good or bad reviews. This is the reason I have quit buying meat at Wal-Mart and other markets that include chemicals and salt in your meat purchases. These reviewers may have been the unwary victims of "enhanced" pork roasts, which are pre-salted. Look in the fine print for whether the roast you bought is enhanced, and if it is shop somewhere else after you speak to the meat manager.

I made this with a 7 lb bone-in shoulder roast and it was fantastic. I packed a bit of herb paste into slits every 3 inches or so all across the fat side of the meat and left that side up for roasting. I let it sit overnight in the fridge. The next day I let it come to room temp before putting it in the oven. The only adjustments I made were that I drizzled a little olive oil in the pan before putting the roast in, and I poured in enough white wine to cover the bottom of the roasting pan while cooking. I added a little more wine a couple of times during roasting to keep the pan from drying out. After about 4 1/2 hrs, the temp was 160 so I took it out to rest. I noticed that the juices were still red so I popped it back in the oven until it hit 165. Then, I let removed it, tented it with foil and let it rest. Just before serving time, I sliced it and re-heated it and its juices in the 350 oven that I was cooking my cauliflower au gratin in. Served it with porcini marsala gravy, garlic mashed potatoes and cauliflower- gorgonzola au gratin. mmmmmmmmmmmmm PS I do think the paste could be made with less salt...Some parts of the crust were just a bit too salty - The pan juices were very salty too.

Melt in your mouth yummy! Two things I would do next time I make this. Buy from a butcher (grocery store roasts are always too fatty in the middle) and check my ingredients BEFORE starting the recipe - oops. Like the cook from Juneau, I used Summer Savory instead of Rosemary (could have sworn I had some!) and didn't have any fennel. No matter, it was fabulous, my kids loved it!

I would make this again, with the following adjustments applied to my first (delicious) try: I used a 3-1/2 lb. bone-in shoulder roast, so fatless it needed no trimming. I did make the entire recipe's worth of herb crust, applying it thinly over most of the exposed meat, and it was just the right amount. I also let it sit on the meat overnight in the fridge (as my boyfirend had to pop it in the oven while I was at work). While, however, I reduced the salt from 1-1/2 Tbs. to 2 tsp., I would reduce it even lower next time to 1 tsp. max. It was *quite* salty, although by no means inedible. I also baked it at 300 degrees, using a meat thermometer. When the thermo rose to 170 degrees (in just over two hours), I popped the roast out, let it sit for ten minutes and carved. It turned out flavourful and as decently moist as I've ever seen roast pork. While it did not need gravy, the pan drippings could have made a nice (albeit salty - there's that word again) addition to the meal.

Rating: 3
Excellent flavors, and yes, I will make it again - today, in fact. But, cookies, this is NOT a roast (the person who is going to try it with a pork loin will be sorry if he/she cooks it 6 hours). This is a BRAISE - meat cooked slowly in liquid with a cover such as a pot roast, stew, etc. A true roast is dry-cooked, uncovered in the oven. Different cuts of meat from separate parts of the animal are suitable for each method. To the person who felt the meat was too fatty, the cuts suitable for braises always are well marbled and from the "hard-working" muscles which need the long, slow cooking in liquid to melt connective tissue. If you do this a day ahead, chill it overnight, the hardened fat in the sauce can be easily discarded. I usually then reduce the sauce before putting the meat in to reheat. Long, slow, gentle, liquid are the key words for a braise. It should not be tough - which usually results from cooking at too high a temperature. The liquid should only "smile", not boil furiously.

Rating: 3
Make sure your roast isn't too fatty before you buy it. I bought a boston butt pork shoulder and I cut most of the fat off the outside but more than half of it was fat. My husband and I could barely eat it. I threw half of it away. It tasted good and it was tender. I will try it again with maybe a pork loin.

Rating: 4
YES! This was really, really good. My friends were mmmming all through the meal. For reference, I made the paste with about .5 T salt which was plenty. I used dry rosemary but fresh would have made this even better. I left this in the oven for about 6 hour 15 minutes, thermometer read 185 when I took it out (yes, I was very skeptical/mortified) and I let it rest at least 15 minutes. Tender, moist and very flavorful on the plate!

Unbelievable!! Fantastic, super-moist roast! We found a 4 lb roast, so we did cook it much less - about 3.25 hours to be exact. Inserted the meat thermometer to make sure it was done. This roast was just totally amazing. I didn't easily find kitchen string in the grocery, so I asked the meat counter for some and they gave me a bunch for free. The crust was sooo great and this was my first roast ever! Definitely worth a try. Also, super-easy. My husband did jazz it up a little bit by demi-glazing it by adding some Chardonnay to the pot after we took the roast out and made a broth to put over it. Not totally necessary, but did add some extra punch with the great spices. Really great! Will definitely make it again - would be excellent for company.

This recipe is fantastic! Just made it for 10 people at Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. Many comments of "the best pork I've ever had". I used a larger 8.5lb roast and added an extra 30 minutes to the cooking time - no problem. I was concerned b/c internal temp was 200 degrees when I pulled it out, but meat was perfectly tender and moist. Hard to overcook with a cut this fatty. I thought the seasoning proportions were fine, though this is definitely a full-flavored dish. Would be easy to adapt the recipe to any other seasoning combination you wanted. p.s. The leftovers are just as good reheated!

i make this roast all the time, and my dinner guests always go home full and happy! you have to cook it slowly: you can get the meat to the proper internal temperature more quickly, but it won't be moist or tender. i also agree with previous reviewers who go a bit lit on the salt: there's enough other flavors going on that you won't lose anything by going conservative on the sodium count.

I cooked this roast yesterday for guests. It was so amazing!! The outside was brown and crisp for beautiful presentation and inside was succulent and bursting with flavor. My guest said they felt like they were at a 5 star restaurant!! I followed the directions precisely. You really miss the beautiful yummy brown if you crock pot this. It takes 6 hours anyway so why not the oven!? I served it with glazed baby carrots and steamed red potatoes with parsley and dill from the foodtv site........heavenly! I added low sodium chicken broth to this drippings for sauce and it cut the salt quite nicely. Hassle free and most impressive!

The flavor of this recipe was very good and had I not let the left-overs cool in the fridge for sandwiches the next day and found out just how much fat was in this cut of meat, I would have rated it much higher. The cooled slices looked more like slices of lard than meat. No wonder it tasted juicy after 6 hours in the oven! Also...6 servings?!? - a pound of meat per person ?!? I wouldn't serve this too often if you are at all concerned about your coronary arteries...

Lovely. I got a boned shoulder (not sure how to explain "Boston Butt" in Spanish) and put the pork on the barbecue for 6 hours. I was a bit concerned as it was getting a bit black that the flavour would be lost but it wasn't at all. The meat tasted delicious and was wonderfully tender.

One of my favorite entertaining recipes; it's very easy to prepare ahead. Experience has taught me to buy a piece of meat that has a good amount of fat, which keeps the meat moist during the long cooking process. Coarse salt and good quality coarse-ground pepper are a must. I do not poke holes in the meat, but simply rub the paste all over, including the inside portion where bone was removed.

I used a 4lb pork roast, but used the measurements of herbs for a 6lb. Don't know whether that caused a overly strong taste. Will definitely make again but adjustment measurements accordingly. As well, I cut down on the salt. Roast was sooooo tender had a hard time cutting.

This is a really nice way to cook pork roast and has the added benefit of being a low-stress recipe for entertaining. I used a smaller bone-in boston roast (4.5 lb), which reached an internal temperature of 165 F in about four hours (160 F would have been fine). I encased the entire roast in foil and double-bagged that in paper sacks. Closed up tight, was still succulent and acceptably warm an hour later. I'd be interested to know if anyone with a smaller bone-in roast like I had cooked it the full six hours, and how it turned out if they did. Ours was nice and juicy. PS There have been some reviews complaining of oversaltiness. These reviewers may have been the unwary victims of "enhanced" pork roasts, which are pre-salted. Look in the fine print for whether the roast you bought is enhanced, and if it is, scale back on the salt.

We thought this was wonderful, even the kids and they are fairly picky. I did think the herb flavor was a bit strong, maybe the fact that I used fresh herbs from my garden. It was actually much better the second day for lunch. I'm not even sure what cut of meat I used, just a cheapie pork roast, but it ended up moist and tender. I didn't even bother tying it. My husband loved soaking up the juices with his baked potato. Yum!!!

My first try roasting pork and the results were very well recieved. I was unable to find the Boston butt, so I used a picnic shoulder, and I used cumin seeds instead of the fennel...and it was delicious and tender. I cut the salt by 1/2 tblspn...no loss it seems. The only drawback was the drippings were much to salty to use for gravy, but the pork was so moist it was hardly needed.

With my first bite of this fork-tender roast, I was transported back to a hole-in-the-wall cafe called Coco Lezzone in Florence, Italy. They serve the best roasted pork I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

This was, hands down, the best pork roast I've ever had. I served it for friends, and they finished the entire roast and then picked all the crispy pieces off the serving platter and ate those too!

This was an exceptionally easy recipe. The mashed potatoes that I made to accompany the dish were actually the hard part of the meal. I didn't have the "Boston" cut called for in the recipe so I used a 6lb. pork shoulder with the bone in. Also, I didn't have six hours so I cooked it for 3 hours on 325F. It came out tender, juicy and full of flavor.

This recipe was a pleasure from beginning to end. I mistakenly added cumin instead of fennel and it was delicious. I like to make recipes as written the first time, so I made it again the next week with fennel. I loved them both, but my mistake was a happy one for I liked the cumin very much. I didn't find it too salty and particularly enjoyed the contrast between the tender, almost delicate, moist interior and the intensely flavored crust. I wonder if some of the problems reported were caused by a change in the size, weight or cut of meat which would change the meat and crust ratio. The drippings are quite salty, and to be used as a sauce need to be cut with wine and/or low or no salt broth or water.

I should have read the reviews more closely, and paid attention when others said it was too salty! I made this in my crock pot, so the salt just soaked right in. My husband thought it was OK, but I couldn't really eat it. Otherwise, it was good, and tender enough to eat with just a fork.

My husband says the meat would make good sandwiches.(Long slow cooking is the key to this fablulously moist roast)

Never succeeded in making a good pork roast like my mom's but when we had a freezer disaster this weekend, I was forced to do something with the quickly thawing meat. This recipe was terrific! Glad I read everyone's comments first though. Although I used coarse sea salt, I still cut back and used almost a tablespoon. The amount of garlic was fine and the combo of fennel seeds, rosemary and sage mellowed very nicely over the long roasting period. About halfway through, I threw in some scrubbed, chunked potatoes that had been tossed in a little olive oil, coarse salt and pepper. Turned them several times throughout the remainder of the roasting. Also served the Alsatian Dilled Cabbage from the Shepard's Garden Seeds cookbook. The whole meal was sublime!

This was my first experience with this pork cut; it was well trimmed, not too fatty and was moist after roasting; however, even though I love garlic and fennel something about this was not right; the flavors didn't meld and were too strong. (I also cut WAY back on the salt and was glad I did). I will not make this recipe again.

We invited my husband's co-worker over for dinner and he couldn't get enough. He had three huge helpings and I think he wanted a doggy bag! It's the most economical way to feed a lot of people and look like you're an experienced cook. Don't add to much salt and make the herb paste the day before because I think it enhances the flavour. Enjoy!

I could salt pepperoni pizza & I still think this dish is too salty (I only have kosher haven't used the other kind in years)! Not sure why the salt and fennel became too strong but there is some combo that brings out these two and almost ruined the meat for me. Read all of the reviews I thought I KNEW it all and was displeased following the recipe exactly. Next time will take sage (pun) advice - what was I thinking ignoring you guys.

Excellant-O! Would never have thought this cheap cut of meat could be cooked up so tender. The smell is delicious (but we do love garlic). Next day made leftover sandwiches inspired by Carolina BBQ recipe: nuked leftover pork on toasted bun drizzled with runny BBQ sauce and topped with coleslaw.

THE best pork roast, loved the flavor, texture and it was a major hit at two dinner parties. Going to have it again next week for a family dinner party. You need to like garlic....

We enjoyed this dish, however, next time I will reduce the garlic and fennel. We are trying to sell our house to someone who is nasally challenged.

This is a great, easy recipe! I have made it twice for Christmas Eve dinner and I am making it again this year. My family loves it.

I am planning to make this recipe. I have braised this cut on many occasions but was not aware that you could roast it. I made the star anise pork and it was fabulous. Also, a cut that can be used to make bbq and taco meat. I have to concur with many of the readers that if you dont follow the recipe you will not usually be pleased with the results. I cant even begin to imagine how some of these substitutions were devised(imagine cooking a boneless loin roast for 6 hours) talk about dry!!! A pork shoulder roast is VERY fatty, if this is a concern eat boneless, skinless chicken breasts. 10 cloves of garlic doesnt seem outrageous, as garlic mellows considerably when it is cooked for a prolonged period of time. Very muck looking forward to trying this and I am convinced it will turn out well. Also, a tablespoon of kosher salt is not overwhelming.

I made this with a pork picnic shoulder roast for a dinner party. I couldn't find fresh sage so I left it out. It came out great! Not dry at all and very flavorful. Instead of untying and then retying the roast I just made several random incisions around the string

In checking this recipe to decide whether or not to make it, I read the comments about too much salt. Am wondering if the "too salty" cooks might have used table salt instead of kosher salt. A tablespoon of kosher salt will be less salty than a tablespoon of table salt.

Sorry about the previous review. I meant to say -- and that's why proofreading is important -- that I take the roast out after five hours and it is done perfectly. I really do love this roast. I may have a hot oven, so test it after five hours. The aroma is really super.

I loved making this - it was so easy and tasted great!

We made three substitutions to this recipe. We cut the salt to 1/2tbsp.cut the garlic to 7 large cloves and added a little white wine and water to the pan after about 2 hours of cooking time. My husband who is a butcher never thought that this cut of meat could cook up tender. He was pleasantly surprised.We will definately make this recipe over again.

Loved it! My family can be a bit fussy when I try new things, but this one always brings them to the table. We even agreed to have this recipe instead of our usual turkey for the holidays.

Yummy! I cut the salt to about a tablespoon of my kosher salt, which would probably be equal to 2 or 2-1/2 teaspoons of regular table salt. I did all the fennel seed recommended. The 10 cloves of garlic stunk like hell during cooking, but settled down into a wonderful flavor. Only thing I think I would do differently is to cut more small slits and stuff the herbs into them. Also, I was expecting the roast to be stringy, falling apart, since it was the shoulder (which braises into a lovely mess of meat) but this held together quite well. Because of the higher fat content and striations throughout the meat, you have a roast that is much more tolerant of a range of timing. 5 hours, 6 hours, what the hell, we've got time for another drink. This roast won't mind. (Oh, I also did a bone-in since Safeway was giving them away for $1/pound this week!)

I made this dish for some close friends and all agreed it was a hit. It was moist and very flavorful. Definitely use the fennel! I used a 5 lb pork butt with the bone in and cooked it for 5 hours - it was perfect.

Rating: 4
Made it with a 6.5lb bone in pork shoulder that I brined overnight. I did reduce the salt to just under a tablespoon. When you taste the rub, it is *very* salty, but it wasn't overpowering at all once roasted for over six hours. We loved this recipe! Excellent flavor, very tender, and made great leftovers. I will certainly make this again!

Rating: 1
I can't speak to anything but the salt, because that's all we could taste. I cut it in half, because of all the other reviews bemoaning the amount of salt, and it was still much too much. Terrible waste of a big cut of meat. My advice is to use no more than a teaspoon.

Rating: 4
Have made this roast at least 6 times with different variations. This original recipe is my favorite but my friends love the "jerk" version (allspice, scotch bonnets, scallions, etc.). Also did a mexican variation with cumin and cilantro. It's all good!!!

Prepared it just as it was written, except for using a three pound roast as there is only two of us. It was tender,juicy and very tasty. I wouldn't change a thing. I roasted it about four hours and fifteen minutes.

I enjoyed this very much. I Slit open the roast like Lorraina B. and slathered the roast with the mixed condiments.Added some liquid to the pot,White wine and broth,however I used a Unboned shoulder. I feel cooking with the bone in enhances the flavor of the meat. The whole house smelled great. Made red cabbage on the side and a Green for great taste and display.I went a little less on the salt,was fine. Leftovers were delicious too. Whats up Fennel bashing? It added wonderful aroma and subtle complexity to the dish without overpowering it by any means.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so easy.Just due to prefrence, I will omit the fenell next time though.I didn't even have a food processor and it still came out great. I chopped all the ingredients for the rub with a french chief knife... It was so tender that even after two times through the microwave (leftovers) it was still tender and juicy.

Rating: 4
Outstanding!!! Don't be afraoid of the fennel. The only thing I would do difrerently next time is reduce the salt a little. Try the leftovers in "Roast Pork with Escarole and Pasta soup" on this site. Delicious!!! Leftovers (we had a ton, but they froze well and I enjoyed using them) are also great combined with bar-b-que sauce.

This is a recipe for a six-pound, boneless, pork shoulder. While I recognize it's up to each of you what spices you use and how much of each, if you use anu other cut of meat I really think you'll be missing the most amazing part of this dish which is cooking a very large, very fatty piece of meat for six full hours! I brined my roast overnight in a cup of salt, a cup of brown sugar and a gallon of water. Then I roasted on a rack, leaving all the fat on, for almost 7 hours betwteen 250-275*. Removed the entire layer of fat before carving. Wow. A taste that can't be duplicated using any short-cuts. Great for a crowd.

Rating: 2
Not really sure what I did wrong. The only change I made was to use a bone-in pork shoulder, as my store didn't have boneless at the time. The garlic-fennel seed paste combination was a knock-out ... as long as you didn't get too much on a bite of meat. Even though I made incisions in the meat to insert the paste, the flavor stayed concentrated in those areas. The parts of pork that weren't touched by the garlic paste were very bland.

Rating: 4
One of the best pork recipes I've come across. Very easy. A 3.75 lb roast took 3 1/2 hrs. Will definely make again. Follow ingredients for herb paste exactly. Do not cover roasting pan. Yummy.

This is the most awesome pork roast recipe that I've come across in a long time! I would highly recommend for anyone to try this recipe. To the earlier reviewers that left out the fennel from the recipe, I want to say that you really missed out. It was THE key ingredient to this whole recipe. DO NOT OMIT THE FENNEL. It's what turned an ordinary, inexpensive roast into a taste sensation beyond compare. I did reduce the salt to 1T. My 4.5# roast cooked to perfection in 4 hours using convection. Internal temp. of 170C produced a tender, juicy roast.

Very tasty, I didn't change the recipe except for the salt. I thought the fennel was great and that the other herbs balanced it out. I liked how easy it was. It was very little effort for very big results.

Made this for dinner yesterday! My nine year old son and I were eating as I cut it in the kitchen! While I think I'll use a leaner cut next time (even trimming the fat resulted in a rather fatty roast-maybe it's the fault of the butcher?), the flavors were wonderful. I've never had an urge to taste the rub as I put it on the raw meat before, but this smells so good...... One thing, my husband didn't like the spices (maybe the fennel, as other reviewers have noted), but I thought it was good enough to make it again anyway (perhaps with adjustments, for his sake!)

Rating: 4
If there was a 5-Fork rating, I would have chosen it. This recipe is SO easy and SO good! The only thing to note is that 1.5 Tbs. of salt is a very hefty dose. I only used a scant tablespoon and found it to be plenty. I also added about a teaspoon each of allspice and white pepper to the herb paste for a little more depth -- turned out great. I've given this recipe to friends and family, and so far everyone has raved. You can even vary the ingredients in the spice paste to reflect different cultural flavors. Leftovers, cubed and sauteed with some fresh fennel, mushrooms, onions,and potatoes, made the best hash we've ever had. This became an instant favorite with us, and judging by the reviews we're in good company. TRY THIS RECIPE!

This dish is wonderful. Agree with the last reviewer and the comment to the cook in CT - please try it again. The meat was absolutely succulent. A definite repeat for my family.

Made this last week end and it was wonderful. I used a Double Top Loin Pork Roast, 3.5 pounds, and baked for 4 hours. The aroma begins almost immediately, and the fennel predominates; however, it does NOT predominate in the taste.... it's a perfect blend of flavors, and I followed the recipe exactly. Did not cover the roast at any time, and it had a marvelous crust. I used my Look grill pan so the meat wouldn't be sitting in any fat released. We had it with winter squash and quickly-sauteed red chard.

I followed the recipe exactly but, was VERY dissatisfied. I covered it since the recipe didn't say - no "crust" just a steamed topping. I would not reccomend it.

Oh, my word.....WOW!! It's been a while since I've been so excited about a recipe. This was jam-packed with flavor. I was skeptical about the long cooking time, thought the roast would turn out dry, but nothing could be further from the result -- juicy, amazing flavor in every bite! My roast took only five hours. I poked a thermometer into it at the five-hour mark, and it registered "well done", though it was very juicy. I didn't bother tying it with string, just let it go. Followed the recipe to a T, except used ground fennel (1 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp whole seeds) Don't fear the fennel! It didn't taste like licorice, rather just added a wonderful touch to an incredibly aromatic herb blend. My husband and I couldn't keep from hovering near the oven and breathing, "Oh my God, does that smell good...." all afternoon! Served with Hoppin' John and Collard Greens with Red Onions and Bacon from this site, plus corn bread and sauerkraut for an amazing New Year's dinner. Make this roast!!!

This was an extremely deliciuos pork dish. I used a bone-in pork shoulder roast instead of a boneless, and it came out great. The flavor of the garlic and herb paste permeated the meat. This was sooooo good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not use fennel seed. I definitely recommend this recipe.

yummy....in fact my only complaint is about the comments here. it frustrates me to read critical comments from people who didn't follow the recipe. if you didn't use the right cut of meat, left out this or added that, then you didn't make this recipe; you merely were inspired by it. of course you are still free to post your inaccurate ratings and your criticisms about the changes that YOU chose to make, but know that it skews the results. and what's more, it doesn't provide meaningful feedback to those of us who actually want to know about how the recipe (as written) turns out.

I used a clay pot and reduceed the salt according to previous suggestions. No fennel. And used a pork loin. Baked 4 hours. Was very disappointed. Made the house smell good but didn't taste like I expected even using less rosemary;

This recipe was great. I read the comments people made about it before I made it so I changed a couple thing... I used only 1 tbs of salt, no fennell seeds & only 1tbs of rosemary... My roast was only 3.6lbs so I cooked it at 275 for 3 1/2 hours. It was so moist & perfect. I will definately make this again!! THANK YOU!!

This recipe got rave reviews at my Dad's 75th birthday party! I used three 2-lb pork sirloins (very lean) in place of the butt,and I skipped the fennel seeds in the paste, but otherwise adhered to the recipe. It was tender and delicious. I will be making this one again!

We recently purchased half a fresh pig and I was looking for a way to prepare the butt roast. This recipe was outstanding. I did not have the fennel but followed the rest of the recipe accordingly, and we were bowled over! Incidentally, my oldest son rarely eats meat and never pork. He devoured this!! I can't wait to make it again, and I'm using the spice rub on an eye of round roast tonight...

The roast smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted great, really tender and juicy. My only complaint was that the herb rub was way too salty! Next time I will cut the salt in half and only use the rub on the outside instead of making slits in the meat and incerting the paste rub and tying it. All that was too much trouble for something that we didn't eat anyway!

I used a pork loin instead of a roast. We all really liked it. Biggest complaint was the amount of salt. We all thought it was to salty. I added mushrooms to the pan juices the last 10 mintues or so of cooking and served it with cream cheese mashed potatos, corn, and bread. It's a recipe I'll use again.

Made this roast for a dinner party of six last weekend and it was quite a hit! The fresh herbs really make a difference. Don't substitute here. My roast came in a net bag and when that was removed it was very messy but I was able to get the herbs in there and get it together. Anyone have any other suggestions? I also had the pork with a potato dish and a red cabbage dish. Can't wait to have another occasion to make it.

This was a truly superb roast. I set the oven to begin cooking at 6 am on Sunday, and by noon, I was more than ready to see what all the smell was about. GREAT spice rub! Take the pan drippings and make a gravy, the flavor from all of the herbs and garlic make for a versatile gravy. Side with roasted garlic mashed potatoes

The roast is wonderfully tender with the slow roast technique. I would agree with a previous review that the Rosemary tends to dominate, so would reduce the amount next time and will plan to make a gravy.

I was looking forward to this pork all day long. I'm sorry to say it was a BIG let down! The fennel seed really gave it an off taste. We ended up shredding it and covering up the flavor with barbeque sauce. A much better recipe to try is the "Roast pork loin with garlic and rosemary". It is sooo much better (4 forks)

To begin with, I don't care for recipes that take six (6) hours. In a crock pot, or in the oven! I am gone at work when they are done in the middle of the afternoon. SO TO BEGIN WITH, I HAD TO MODIFY THE RECIPE. I began with a frozen 6 pound boston butt! Cooked it 10 hours at 275, and it was great! I had it tonight for dinner, with mashed sweet potatoes/russet combination and swiss chard from the garden. I would definately make this again.
