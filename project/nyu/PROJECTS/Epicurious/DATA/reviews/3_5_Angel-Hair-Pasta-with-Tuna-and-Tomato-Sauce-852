Going back I would have made the sauce a little thicker and added some tomato juice, but overall a great dish. Expensive though!

Really wonderful recipe. I used fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned and it turned out very well.

This is a great recipe, I followed it to the letter and enjoyed it, and did my guests : to the cook from Toronto, your review is hardly valid, seeing that basically you changed the whole recipe!! Hello! you have rated a recipe you maade up (with odd changes, I might add), not this one - wake up!!

This recipe was wonderful! It really doesn't need to be altered... it's great when prepared as it's written. Although, I prefer a bit thicker sauce, so I added another half can of tomatoes. I actually served this as the first meal I prepared for a new boyfriend, and it definitely stole his heart! This recipe is going to be a permanent addition to my recipe book!

Although the tuna makes this dish a bit expensive, it is one of my favorites. Follow the instructions. Also, drain and rinse the tomatoes to remove some salt, use fresh ingredients and DO NOT overcook the tuna. A bit of heaven in every bite!!!

Well I didn't use tuna fish just b/c I didn't have it, I used salmon instead. I couldn't find clam juice, so I got a can of baby whole clams, used the liquid in it and used the clams in the sauce, I also added crabmeat. It was ok, nothing great, the pasta tasted good as the sauce was nice and light on it. I dont' realyl know if I'd do it again, probably not.

This is a good recipe, but you definitely have to be a tuna-lover to enjoy it. My husband thought it deserved just "two forks" but I out-voted him and gave it three (I made it after all!)

It was expensive to make and labor intensive.

This is a delicious, tasty recipe especially during the summer months. It's light yet full of flavor - sure to become a favorite.

This dish probably deserves 2 1/2 forks rather than just 2. My husband made it last night, and it was pretty yummy. The only problem was that it was really salty because of the salt added over and above the salt in the canned tomatoes. It's a very good way to have tuna in a relatively low-fat dish.
