Obviously this recipe is all about the sauce. If you like mustard, you'll like this recipe. Very simple but very mustardy.

Nice. I prefer Maple Syrup to Brown Sugar. Either is delicious. I use Boar's Head Deli Mustard w/ white wine. ;)MMmmm. Thank you for this wonderful, simple recipe! Psst- with my variation it is ready in 30 seconds. ;)adarthurity
