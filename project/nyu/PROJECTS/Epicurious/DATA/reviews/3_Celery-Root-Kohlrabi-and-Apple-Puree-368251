I admit I used a bit more butter and sea salt to finish this dish. It really is quite good and great to soak up any gravy you have.

This turned out great with many light-colored root vegetables. Besides celery root and kohlrabi, I added parsnips and turnip. I used peeled red potato instead of russet. It turned out fantastic, like a lighter, more flavorful mashed potato dish. Running it through a course ricer twice produced a nice texture that wasn't totally mush. I'll make it again when I find myself with a dearth of whitish root vegetables.

This recipe was really good even though I didnt follow it completely as written. I couldn't find kohlrabi so I used parsnips instead. I also used 1/2 the amount of butter it called for. Since I don't have a food mill or potato ricer I pureed the ingredients in a food processor and it still came out fairly nice and fluffy. I like the combination of the ingredients and it was a nice change from mashed potatoes. I will try this again once I can find kohlrabi.
