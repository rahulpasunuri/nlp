Be aware, these are rather time consuming to make, however, they are quite enjoyable in the end. I did make a few alterations though in order to be a bit truer to the many coxinhas I enjoyed while living in Brazil--instead of cream cheese, use Mexican Crema and add a little bit of tomato paste to the filling. Then pair the finished product with a bit of mayonnaise and the result is an enjoyable croquette like snack or lunch.
