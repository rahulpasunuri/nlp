This recipe was good, but next time I think I will make it with less Dijon. I found the taste a little overpowering. I made it with pork ribs and was very tasty, but would cut the mustard and perhaps add a little more spice.

Stopping by to get the recipe for what has to be the 4th or 5th time, just wanted to say this is my favorite sweet-style sauce. The bourbon gives it that unusual flavor that tells everyone that it isn't out of a jar. Just excellent, but apparently not for everybody :)

This sauce was not good at all - I even simmered it for 1/2 hour, still not good. Threw the recipe away immedately.

I've made this twice already and both times, they've blown both me and my fiancé away. The trick is that I simmer all the ingredients together until it thickens. Then when the whole chicken is done marinating in my own special white wine-lemon mixture (yes, I soak a whole chicken for 9-10 hours before cooking), I preheat the oven to 400 degrees, fill the cavity with some cut-up onion and garlic, baste the entire chicken with the BBQ sauce, and stick it in. Every 20 minutes, I continuously baste the chicken with the sauce. Toward the end, I broil the chicken with the oven door open and baste it a bit more. You'll probably end up using the whole 1 1/4 cup of sauce for basting but the chicken will carry such an awesome flavor... and broiling toward the end should crisp the skin a bit... it's totally fun and yummy to eat. This is my standard BBQ sauce from now on. No more store-bought bottles.

I made this exactly as directed and let it mellow in the fridge for a day. It was awesome with hickory-grilled salmon.

Delicious sauce. Needs to be simmered to thicken and mature flavor. I simmered for about 10 minutes or so. I also added a little extra brown sugar to sweeten it a bit more.

I marinated bone in chicken breasts and drumsticks with this delicious barbeque sauce for a few minutes. Once on the grill I basted the chicken every 5 minutes or so. Turned out very, very good - a summer classic.

This was an excellent bbq sauce...I just brought it to a simmer and then let it cool...it was really great...the fresh rosemary really adds something special to the sauce...very unique.

A great, reliable sauce. We still try other sauces but keep coming back to this one.

This sauce has to be SIMMERED for at least 30 minutes to mellow it out. I also added some vinegar and a bit of garlic. Liquid smoke is another possibility

I doubled the brown sugar and that made it a 4 fork recipe, before that it was a bit harsh, now it's truely GREAT!

Loved this recipe. The suace was a little strong, but after sitting for a few weeks the taste mellowed and this definitely became a four fork recipe.

Really tasty! Goes well with smoked pulled pork.
