Not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but too soggy to be good chips.

I thought these were terrific and worth the beet-stained hands. I used a deep fryer which worked fine. I sliced the beets on the 1mm blade in my food processor which probably wasn't thin enough. After 2 minutes of cooking the beet chips were not crisp. I tried cooking them longer and at a higher temperature, but they lost their sweetness. Even though I cooked the rest for less time and they were not crisp, they were still sweet and delicious. Next time I'll slice them thinner.

The flavor is really great & they're even fun to eat....but.....they are a pain to cook. I even used a mandoline which made the prep work extremely easy & fast. But when it came to the frying....it took a long time (a lot of batches to fry). I don't think it's worth it. Won't make again. Also, they have a shiny appearance, as in greasy look which makes them unappealing visually. I used a deep-fat fryer which may have something to do with it.

These chips were amazing, full of flavour. Even the beet-haters loved them. Much better than the sweet potato chips I made at the same time. Take care, though - slicing them is messy work!!
