Liked it, didn't love it. used only endive (tossed in a little arugula for color). threw some truffle oil in--was a nice touch. The problem here is that the dressing masks the bitterness of the endive. I like the bitterness!

This salad takes no time to make! I only had endive, but it was more than enough bitter to balance the acidity of the vinaigrette. This salad offers complex flavors, interesting textures, and an eye-catching presentation with a minimum of fuss.

We substituted fresh rosemary for the dried and swiss chard for the bitter greens. It was really quite good. It almost had an asian flavor. we served it as a side to soy/sesame marinated salmon and jasmine rice. I would enjoy having it again although my husband thought that the sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the swiss chard. I'll have to try it with the stronger-flavored bitter greens.

rather interesting salad, not difficult to make. i find it particularly suitable for the seder meal where both greens and bitter herbs are part of the ceremony rmp
