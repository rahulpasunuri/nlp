A great recipe and very easy for a first- time turkey-stock cook such as myself. I used the neck, giblets, and carcass of my organic turkey from Thanksgiving, and more vegetables than called for - two of each and four garlic cloves. I'm not sure parsley adds much flavor, personally, so I used five or so fronds. I found the stock reduced about 45 minutes faster than the recipe noted, but I may have had the heat turned up too much. In any case, it turned out scrumptious and was great in the turkey soups I made. Leftovers are frozen for the next recipe.

If you're comparing recipes, don't even consider the Gourmet roasted version, but use this one instead! This recipe produced a lovely, rich, full flavored stock.

This is the best stock ever! I have been making it for 7 years. It is part of my Thanksgiving tradition. It makes the best gravy ever!

Great stock, I doubled the amount of turkey. I love the true taste of turkey in this stock without other competing flavors.

This is a great recipe and I've used it more than a few times, but there are much easier ways to do it. The stock I currently have on the stove has a pack of turkey necks and turkey legs, along with the frozen carcass (with quite a bit of meat left on) from a previously roasted turkey and a very small frozen chicken carcass as well. The mix provides a great depth. I threw in two carrots, one large onion, some leftover frozen leek tops, one frozen leftover frond of fennel, one clove of garlic and about a teaspoon or so of peppercorns. I'm quite fond of the 'accumulate and cook' method of stock... It saves money and lets you get the full use of your food. All year I collect odds and ends to use this time of year as I go through enormous quantities for soups, Thanksgiving, etc. Generally I don't brown, or at least too much. I heat the pot, and just start throwing in stuff as I chop it. Between browning and not browning, I haven't found a huge difference.

This stock makes the very best turkey gravy ever! Every Thanksgiving and Christmas, guests rave about my gravy. I will never make any other stock again!

This is the first turkey stock I've made without a hint of chicken taste - it was fabulous! Without a doubt a great recipe. This is now part of my Thanksgiving tradition.

Wonderful stock...BUT the bottom line is to get an ORGANIC turkey for best flavor and no chemical additives. I DARE anyone to do an honest search to see what they are ingesting in the Butterball types. I used to think that stuff was okay since it was FDA approved. Ha!
