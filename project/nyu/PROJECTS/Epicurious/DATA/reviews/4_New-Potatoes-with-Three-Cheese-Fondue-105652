Agree with most... A keeper as is! I made for Xmas eve dinner. Put it in crock pot and headed off to church. No fuss. We steamed cauliflower,broccoli,carrots. Roasted potatoes, grilled rib eye, cubes of bread, raw peppers... Doubled the recipe. It was enough for 5 adults 3 kids.

Teens prepared this in an electric fondue pot at a dinner party. They had fun & just loved it!(did add a minced garlic clove with the onion)Used cubed bread, grape tomatoes & broccoli for dipping. Smooth & creamy - the fondue did NOT separate, even after hours on warm.

This is the perfect fondue for entertaining. You don't have to keep going back to stir since the cream cheese keeps everything mixed together. I've used this for a handful of Christmas parties and it's a big hit...and easy on my part. I leave it in a small crock pot plugged in.

We do lots of grilled veggies and thought the a cheese sauce would be a nice compliment. I made this as it had a great base to work with and added my own twist. I used an emmental cheese and a hot pepper Jack. I used 1/2 the cream cheese and low fat milk and it came out awesome. I also used a little extra onion. Will definitely do again.

I am in love with this recipe! I had most of the ingredients on hand, nice fondue without having to purchase booze. Easy to assemble, mixture didn't break, it was fabulous. Served it for my Birthday Potluck & it was a hit. Had steamed broccoli & carrots, toasted bread, almonds, pear & sausage.

this is the best fondue I've ever tasted. I used cave-aged Gruyere from Trader Joe's, and I think that made all the difference. It imparted a pungent, almost smoky flavor. Not only was this fondue delicious, its consistency stayed smooth and velvety the whole time it was in the pot. I doubled the recipe for a party, but ended up refrigerating a third of it. Even the leftovers heated up nicely the next day (in the microwave). And what a great idea to use red potatoes! Luckily, I found some olive-sized mini reds (also at Trader Joe's), which I boiled whole and tossed with parsley and olive oil. no need to add salt to any component; the blend of cheeses adds the perfect amount of savoriness. What an incredibly good recipe. My guests swooned, and so did I!

DELICIOUS!!! We made this in our local Iron Chef competition as the appetizer and blew them away! The secret ingredient was squash, which we peeled, sliced and sauteed. It went beautifully and added some color to the plate with the parslied potatoes. We plated it by placing a few tablespoons of the cheese on the plate, 4 potato pieces, the slices of squash crisscrossed and a parmesan crisp topping it off. The Chef judges gave us 53 out of a possible 60 points. It also goes well with apples & celery.

I made this for a party and received many compliments. I really liked the flavor but it was maybe a bit too thick. I did use evaporated milk instead of whipping cream and reduced fat cream cheese and the flavor was still very good. Served it with bread, broccoli, apples and the suggested potatoes. I'll definitely make this again but may try a little less cream cheese.

Absolutely the hit of a bridal shower.. didn't bother rewarming the potatoes, left fondue in pan to stay warm, kept catching girls sneaking back into the dining room and dipping bread, apples, pears, anything into the fondue!

This was a big hit for me. I didn't have gruyere, so I used asiago (BIG difference). My french husband liked it, but told me it wasn't "real" fondue. Still, the pot was scraped clean with no leftovers. I'll make again, but probably add some wine to add some kick.

This is an awesome fondue recipe. Everytime I've made it I get compliments and asked for the recipe. I would highly recommend it. It's pretty easy to make also.

I make this for my annual Christmas party and usually triple the recipe. I pour the cheese fondue directly over the potatoes and keep it warm in a chafing dish. There are never any leftovers. Guests ask for the recipe throughout the night. Very tasty and great for a party since you can make ahead of time and simply reheat.

I completely adore this recipe. I have made it countless times (with some slight variations in the cheeses) and find it to be creamy and perfect every time. Much easier to make than conventional wine fondues as well. Very highly recommended.

This fondue is delicious! It was served with french bread, broccoli, and mushrooms. The rich taste is addicting. I will be making again soon.

Very easy to make and incredibly rich, your eyes will roll back in your head with the first taste! Not your traditional fondue, but the cream cheese adds a flavor that will be more familiar to most. Make certain that you keep it on a very gentle heat to avoid scorching the cheese. Live and learn!!!

Fabulously delicious! Made this for a fondue party with friends. We had three different cheese fondues and this was by far the favorite. We kept fighting over who could sit closest to it! I used fingerling potatoes instead of red potatoes. We also dipped bread, broccoli, cauliflower and meat from our hot oil fondue. This will be a standard for fondue nigths!

EXCELLENT! The potatoes are superb, the fondue was a hit at the party I just threw for 14 very different people- definitely a keeper as is!

This is a very rich tasting fondue, but overall very good considering that this is the first time that I've ever made anything like this. I made it for my husband and I...he really liked it, I think next time I would cut back on the cream cheese...we had it with potatoes, broccali, mushrooms, shrimp, pasta, bread and some apples. This definately filled us up for a dinner meal.

We had this for New Years Eve last year - everyone loved it and we will do a repeat this year. Our son just called from Duke, wanted the recipe and his lab is doing it also for the holidays. We added different vegetables besides potatoes as well as the baguette

This was a great way to fondue. I'd make it again. The potatoes where a nice change.

The only problem with this recipe is there is not enough!!! The first time I made this, I had for some German and Swiss friends - not traditional fondue but they all asked for the recipe! I am making it again tonight - but doubling the recipe....This one is a keeper

This is a nice variation on Piedmontese fonduta. I substitute the gruyere for something jazzier, such as fontina val d'aosta or raclette.

We had a fondue party for 30 this past weekend - this recipe was a BIG hit, especially for the people who prefer mild cheeses. The potato was perfect with the fondue -delicious ! I made this ahead of time and then microwaved it back to temperature before adding it to the pot. The spuds rewarmed nicely in the oven.

I didn't think this recipe was all that fabulous. It was good, but I just wasn't wowed by it. I've had other fondue recipes that were much nicer than this and will probably use those in the future.

Used baby red potatoes, halved, which were a lot prettier, and apple chunks, to satisfy the no-carbs crowd at christmas eve. Everyone loved it - even with lots of other apps, it was almost all devoured. super easy to make, esp. compared to other gruyere fondue recipes on the site. It doesn't make as much as you would think...

Artery clogging, but oh so very very good. Easy to make ,popular with guests. Served with other appetizers from the same article...all of them were good: smoky chipolte hummus, pepperoni pinwheels, roasted mushrooms w/ feta, spinach & bacon. Will make again as long as it's served with another of other appetizers.

This was a wonderful recipe! The perfect flavor and consistency. It's a great extra appetizer to make for a party when you want to make sure there is enough to eat. It's easy to make and reheats nicely the next day. We've even used it as a side dish for a party where we served tenderloin sandwiches. Don't change a thing about the recipe.

This fondue was a hit!! I used scallions instead of onion and a smooth havarti instead of the gruyere and I received rave reviews. The best part is that it's so easy! I will definitely make this again and play with the receipe a little more.

I was a little sceptical reading this recipe. I mean, how can fondue not include wine or kirsch?! But we tried it, and this is great fondue. Easy to make too.

I haven't made this dish yet, but thought I'd give another recipe for the fondue that my family has made for the holidays, for over 30 years- it's simple and DELICIOUS!! You can use a fondue pan, but I think an electric skillet works wonderfully! Take 1 large garlic clove (smashed), rub your pan with it thoroughly. Add 1&1/2 cups dry white wine. Heat almost to a boil. Add 1LB. of GRUYERE cheese (shredded), STIR CONSTANTLY. Mix 2 tsp. corn starch with 3 TBL. KIRSCH LIQUOR. Add to sauce. If you don't have KIRSCH, you can use 1 TBL. BRANDY EXTRACT mixed with 2 TBL. water. This is a CLASSIC FONDUE!! When sauce thickens, keep over a med. low heat, but MAKE SURE to keep stirring! You can stir w/ your bread and fork! We always dip cubed Itailian bread into the fondue, with a salad of mixed greens & homemade Italian style dressing. ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD-DELICIOUS! Let me know what you think!
