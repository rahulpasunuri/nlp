Delicious, although the sauce is not very attractive. Tastes better if you don't try to take a shortcut by using the food processer for all the steps in the sauce. Sauce is also wonderful with bread.

This recipe was bad bad bad. It was just boiled beets with a sauce that looked like Poi, brown amd thick with a very strong taste of raw garlic. I ate this two days ago and I can still taste the garlic!!!

This was very tasty and very beautiful, a little bit of work but worth it for a special occasion. The sauce was different from what I imagined, almost pasty from the bread and potato, but so flavorful with garlic. A friend who professed not to like beets before had at least three large helpings. Yum.

This dish is incredible. I just discovered beets this year, and I discovered that they are one of the healthiest foods for me, they make me feel really good, so I'm on the lookout now for beet recipes. I first saw the recipe in my Bon Appetit for May, all about the Greek Islands, this one is from Samos. I decided that I was going to make some "Greek Food", then I saw it on the website. The sauce is a chunky sauce, so be prepared for that, You might want to process the whole thing in your food processor, instead of mixing it in the bowl. I forgot the vinegar at the end, (drizzle) but it was delicious anyway. I used extra garlic cloves, and served it with some sourdough French bread, and some Italian Meatballs with Marinara Sauce, and a bottle of Santa Ynez Valley Lincourt Vineyards Pinot Noir. I garnished it with fresh herbs. The sauce is pretty strong with all the garlic.
