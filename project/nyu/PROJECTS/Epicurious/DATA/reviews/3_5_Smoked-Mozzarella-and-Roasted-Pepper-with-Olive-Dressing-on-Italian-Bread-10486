I found that the bread overwhelmed the contents of the sandwich. If I try this again, I will use a thin bread that lets the olive/cheese/pepper combo shine.

I originally thought there would be too many strong flavors competing with each other, but boy, was I wrong! This amazing, simple sandwich will "wow" all the lucky people you make it for!

Smoked is the first word in the title but somehow I didn't notice and bought fresh mozzarella. It was so good I can't imagine smoked would be better. This is without a doubt the best sandwich. It looks like the cover of Gourmet and couldn't be easier. I thought 4 olives what is that going to do...when you brush that on the bread it's amazing!!

tHIS WAS FABULOUS! I WANTED TO SERVE AS AN APPETIZER, SO I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND SPLINT OPEN A LOAF OF FRENCH BREAD. I BLENDED THE BASIL SO IT WAS MORE LIKE A PASTE TO SPREAD OVER THE BREAD WHICH I GRILLED FIRST. SLICED THE PEPERS AND PUT IT UNDER THE BROILER FOR A FEW MIN. CUT INTO APPETIZER PORTIONS, IT WAS GREAT. LIKE BRUCHETTA.

This is the best kind of entertaining recipe. It's fast, easy and delicious. I'm going to start making it on a smaller scale for my lunches.

It was PRIMO!!!! Trust me, this is one, fool-proof dinner accompaniment. I used it with some Pasta Primavera, as an open face sandwich, and let me tell y'all... my girlfriend was thoroughly impressed.

Very rich and tasty -- using a little less oil than called for make it even better.

A delicious, simple sandwich to make. I had a hard time finding smoked mozzarella, so I used smoked provolone instead, which I think lost something in the translation. But the olive dressing was good and very easy to do, so next time I will try this with fresh mozzarella if nothing else. This is a really tasty summer picnic sandwich, and I will make it again for beach picnics, etc.

It's a party in your mouth. Just add a good petit sirah and your happy! Lost this recipe and was so happy to find it here.
