The best granola we have ever made! Added chopped dried apricots and shredded unsweetened coconut. So crispy, and just sweet enough!!

Great basic recipe which is usually what I am looking for when I go on this site. Then make changes/additions according to what's on hand which are usually my personal preferences. I used pepitas, sunflower seeds and some chopped almonds and hazelnuts. Had some maple butter which I threw in in lieu of honey with a little butter. My kids love it.

I like my granola crunchy but after following the directions, it still did not crisp after cooling. 30 min at 300 degrees is not long enough. It's good, but could bear some tweaking.

The recipe seemed a bit bland to I added cinnamon and added some almond and vanilla extracts. Instead of toasting the nuts and oats mixture separately, I combined everything in a big bowl and spread it evenly on a baking sheet and baked it at 325 for about 25 minutes. I usually check it frequently after 20 minutes to make sure it doesn't burn. Everything toasted up just fine and it eliminated a step from the original recipe. Also, I found that the amount of syrup was too low. I like larger pieces of granola for easier snacking and this amount of syrup leaves the granola broken up. Just a personal prefence.

Made this recipe using cashews and pecans. Used a cinnamon flavored syrup. Followed directions otherwise, using the full stick of butter. Delicious!!

I really like this recipe, I do use more honey than called for and add brown sugar. I also use sunflower seeds.

i think this recipe is fine, but not at all great. i have made better tasting granola without a slice of butter. i agree that with the reviewer that said her nuts burned, mine did too, after only 7 minutes they were ruined...

I HATE it when people give four forks to a recipe they've changed but I'm doing it now! This is a great recipe but I tweaked it to fit my family and our tastes. I changed the pecans to cashews, did 1/8 cup sesame seeds & 1/8 cup pumpkin seeds. Instead of butter I used coconut oil. I used 3/4 cup craisins & 1/2 cup chopped dried peaches. I also added 1/4 C unsweetened coconut flakes. THIS IS SCRUMPTIOUS.

This recipe is so delicious, it is a standard in our pantry! No more spendy granola from the store. It is worth it to follow the recipe precisely instead of getting worried about the butter.... I tried it both ways and it is far superior with the butter!

This granola recipe is a huge hit in our family - everyone loves it. Our daughter who is in college is constantly asking me to make some and send it to heralong with extra for all her friends that love it as well. As others suggested, I reduced the butter to 2 Tablespoons and I added 1 T brown sugar as others suggested.

This has become a regular part of our pantry at our house. My teens love it and my husband reminds me when we are getting low. Excellent.

I used to work at a national granola factory. Someone in my family made this and followed the recipe except put in more sweetener. They left the nuts in the oven for only 7 min. and they burned. The recipe called for 8-10 min. The granola was hardly sweet. Maybe Fido will eat it though.

Because of certain nut allergies I have adapted this recipe to suit, very easy, no need to pre-cook the nuts in my opinion. I like to bake for longer, stirring every 15 mins. 1/2c raw unsalted pistacio 1/2c raw unsalted cashews 4c old fashioned rolled oats 1/4c sesame seeds 1/4c flax seeds 1/2c olive/ grapeseed oil 1/3c honey 1c green pumpkin seeds 1/2c dried blueberries or 1/2c dried pears

This recipe is absolutely delicious and I am getting ready to make it for the second time. Out of curiosity, I ran the calories through the recipe creator on nutritiondata.com. Even with only 2 tbsp of butter, the calories run about 350 for a 1/2 cup serving, with about 12 grams of fat and 50g of carbs (made with raisins and including the sesame seeds). So not exactly health food, but yummy nevertheless.

Delicious, I used pecans, almonds and a package of mixed of berries from Trader Joes. Also substituted canola for butter; and agave syrup for golden as I could not find it. It's so much better than store bought, it's definitely noticeable. I eat it with greek yogurt.

I used old fashioned oats and steel cut oats, 75/25%. It makes it chewey, I like that. Nuts were pecan & pistachio; and fruits were dates, craisins and figs. I think it is ok, not spectacular. The way I got it to stay in clumps was to add a little more syrup (agave). I like it as a topping on my oatmeal, malt-o-meal and yogurt.

This granola is delicious. First time I made homemade and can taste the difference. A few changes: Used chopped almonds and walnuts (easier). Used simple syrup instead of maple combined with a touch of honey. Used dried cranberries (cheaper). And I only used about a tablespoon of butter and a swirl of olive oil. It makes me excited for breakfast!

HERE'S A TIP! Want clumping? After months of using this wonderful recipe, I wanted to make it for a vegan friend. So instead of using the butter as is called for in the recipe, I used 1/4 cup grapeseed oil. At the same time, I was out of maple syrup (thank God spring has arrived so I can make the drive to NH for more) so I used Lyle's cane syrup instead. For their last 15 minutes in the oven I pat the oats flat with a spatula and don't stir them again until they're out of the oven and stone cold. Viola! Scrape it up with your spatula and -- viola! -- you have clumpy granola!

This recipe was super easy to make which I loved. I took the advice of previous people and cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons. I also added toasted coconut, and substituted hazelnuts and cashews in it. It is super yummy. I will definately make this again.

This is a great, great recipe. I use the toasted oats from Trader Joes, also throw in their toasted flax seeds, it's great. I am going to try using the egg whites to clump the mixture, and I also use only 2 TBS of butter (thanks so much for this suggestion!) My son asked if I could send him a batch at college, it's that good. Dried cherries, blueberries, anything you have on hand works really well.

I've made this several times and it's great each time. I skipped the foil and put the nuts directly on the pan to bake. While it's baking I melt the butter and measure the oats in a bowl and then add the butter and honey or syrup. It's much easier to mix that way even though you have one more item to wash. Also chopping the nuts while the oats bake saves some time. Once the oats have baked I have everything else in the bowl and ready to mix. I've skipped the salt entirely since my third batch.

I've made this twice now and both times it was delicious. After reading other reviews, next time I'll try halving the butter (or less) as one whole stick seems like a lot. The second time I ran out of maple syrup so did a combo or maple syrup and honey and it worked out well. Will definitely be making this many times.

Added my own dried fruit mixture. Also, this particular granola recipe is high in saturated fat due to the butter used instead of oil. It's a good treat though. The butter also makes it have an oatmeal cookie-like flavor. Yum!

Candied ginger, dried peaches and pecans are very yummy together! mmmmm Also couldnt get mine to clump by the way, but I will try again next time..its so good either way. Wondering if I stired it around too much after adding the butter, maple syrup and egg whites.

To the Cook from Norfolk, MA...try using the whites from two eggs... or 2tbs of egg whites to get the clump in your granola. It works well and doesnt alter the recipe.

I used Lyle's Golden Syrup, which is a cane syrup. This had a lovely taste, but I wasn't able to get the oats to clump, which was what I was aiming for so I could add it to a homemade trail mix. I tried adding water and squeezing the oats together as one reviewer suggested-- this did get me many clumps, but a vast majority of the granola was just single oats. That's fine, however, because I'm using it as a breakfast cereal instead, which is how I believe the recipe is intended to be used. I'm wondering, though, if anyone else knows how I might get some good clumping action going on the oats.

I made the basic recipe this past weekend. Used the dried fruit that I had on hand (dates, cherries, and apricots), and have kept them seperate from the granola itself so as not to add moisture. Fabulous over a large scoop of Greek yogurt!

This is really good. Thanks to previous reviewers for suggestions. I used 2 tbsp of butter with no loss of flavor, and a combination of brown sugar and honey (plenty sweet). Also added some wheat germ and flax seeds to whatever nuts were on hand. I have it every morning with yogurt.

A tasty and exceptionally versatile recipe. I've made this with various combinations: no fixins (pure oats), pepitas, unsalted pistachios, smidgens of ground ginger or cardamom, apricot, whatever is on hand or of interest. I've also added 1/4c brown sugar to the dry ingredients, slightly reducing honey, for a nice, mellow take (http://tinyurl.com/2caex5). The high fat content is unnecessary. I cut butter to 2 tbs to have the round flavor present, minus artery and belly attack... only challenge then is not to eat the entire batch. Tasty.

I changed a few things to reduce the fat and add extra crispiness: Instead of 1 whole stick of butter, I added 1/2 a stick + 2 tablespoons veg oil + 1 egg white. The egg white adds extra crisp and helps the mix clump a bit better. I skipped sesame seeds, adding wheat germ and flax seeds instead. And in place of the dates I added chopped apricots- adding them to the granola with about 10 minutes left in the baking time so they would dry out enough to not make the dry ingredients soften once out of the oven. I also added craisins when it was done baking. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe! Even my carnivorous husband liked it. To make it a little more to my liking, I added a cup of shredded coconut (no sugar added) and a half a cup of honey sweetened wheat germ to the dry mixture then added a bunch of different dried fruits; cranberries, cherries, currants, whatever. Oh, and I nixed the salt. If you add more stuff, you might need to add more syrup to clump it together but I didn't and it turned out like more of a great tasting muslix. Right up my alley!

To CelenaK from Santa Cruz: try adding 1-2 T water to the mix and squeeze handfuls after you pour it on the baking sheet. The water should help clump the mix together. I haven't tried ths recipe (too much butter!), but that is what I do for my other granolas.

Like everyone else, I love this granola. But, I'd love a few suggestions. I want to try to get the oats to clump a bit and tone down the sweetness just a bit. Less oats? A greater variety of nuts, berries?

For granola, this does seem to rate "exceptional". The process can be greatly simplified. To coat the oats and sesame seed, melt the stick of butter in a large glass bowl (I used a 2-qt. one) in the microwave, stir in the syrup and salt and then stir in the oats and sesame seed. Once thoroughly coated, spread in a thin layer on the foil-covered baking sheet used to toast nuts. I did not stir again once in the oven--wasn't necessary--but that mey be because I was using a convection oven. This really is delicious.

Sunflower seeds are a good idea, as are pumpkin seeds. You can also try whole flax seeds (mmm lots of omega3s!) or sesame seeds, and crasins in addition to the dried blueberries.

Same for me, my son is allergic to nuts, i was thinking mixing sunflower seeds with soy nuts. Any suggestions?

Any advice? No nuts at my sons school. Would it be a waste of ingredients if I tried it without the nuts. Maybe soy nuts and dried pea's?
