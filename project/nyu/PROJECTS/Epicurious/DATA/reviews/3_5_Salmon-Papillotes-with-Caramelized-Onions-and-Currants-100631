I have enjoyed this recipe since it first came out, and I still have the magazine version. This is the dish I make when company is coming. I like that I can make the packets well in advance and spend time with my guests, rather than frantically working in the kitchen. The flavors and scents are heavenly. It works year round. And since many people are not familiar with how foolproof parchment paper makes cooking, they think it is something fancy rather than just a great way to keep food moist. Very simple and always perfect. I cannot rave enough. This is one of my three favorite recipes of all time. Thank you, epicurious!

This is excellent but here's a tip to make it much easier -- make one big fillet for all the guests in the parchment. It serves beautifully, and saves a lot of busy work!

After seeing the poor reviews I can understand why no one has made this dish in a while. I have been making it for years always to great reviews. First and Foremost - you Must use the very best and freshest salmon. (No farmed stuff) I use a bit less currants and spice, but the brandied currants and carmelized onions on top of the salmon is very good and best of all can be prepared a few hours ahead of time in the paper and on a cookie sheet waiting to go into the oven. Four or Six packages are the right amount to make. I serve mine still in the parchment on each guests plate with scallop potatoes on the side. Add plenty of pepper to the onions and a dash of lemon on the fish is okay too.

I loved this recipe - great flavors, simple to make, elegant and not too many calories! I look forward to making it again for company.

In a word: awful. I tried all the extras everyone suggested, and the fish was WAY to "fishy" both tasting and smelling. I think the onion mixture would be delicious on pork or chicken, but I think it is to much for fish.

This was a wonderful recipe. I love cooking in parchment. It's so easy and healthy plus everything gets perfectly cooked. I served a Moroccan vegetable soup for first course then the salmon and a side of roasted butternut squash and mushrooms with sage. It was a night for spices, delicious!

Scrumptious. This is such a delicious recipe for salmon. And the presentation is beautiful.

Wonderful recipe! I used less onion, added a little more brandy and cinnamon and nutmeg and reduced the oil. Beautiful presentation and the flavors blended marvelously with the salmon. Served with mashed roasted garlic parsnips and potatoes. Mmm Mmm good!

The sauce was absolutely delicious, and I would have LOVED it on pork. I decided, however, that I much prefer salmon broiled than poached. I think I had an OK piece of fish, so my girlfriend guessed that the sauce may have accentuated it's fishy flavor. The pouches were definitely cool to make, and if I ever try this again, I might bathe the salmon in lemon first. It took a couple of tries to get the pouches to fold and seal properly. Fortunately, I found more detailed instructions on doing this on the back of the parchment package. Some hints: the final result is a HALF heart, and Safeway had only 12x16" sheets of parchment, which worked well with 3-4oz fillets. If you plan ahead and prepare half of them upside down, you can decorate them and serve them as full hearts. I used the skewer I used for testing as an arrow.

Easy and very good for parties. I reduced onion and oil to half.

We made this recipe for a special birthday dinner. All the guests raved about this recipe and all asked for the recipe. This is my new specialty dish. I replaced the salmon with chilean sea bass.

Prepared this as the main course of a rotating "progressive" dinner. The guests are still raving. I used the freshest B.C. salmon I could find and Vidalia onions. Had to remove from the envelopes before serving, though, as they took up almost the whole plate!

The spices in this recipe bring out a strong, somewhat fishy, flavor in the salmon. I would use less spice and try in again. The best part of this recipe is the ease of preparation --- and --- the presentation. My guests, especially the kids, thought the bags were way cool.

I made this once and will be making it again for a dinner party because it was elegant, easy and a great make-ahead dish. I didn't use salmon though, I made this with sea-bass fillets and it was out of this world.

This is a wonderful, flexible recipe. My favorite variation is with halibut rather than salmon. I use 2 tsp. of oil to caramelize the onions; just as flavorful. If you make the papillotes ahead of time and have them waiting in the refrigerator, timing your dinner party so easy; just 12 minutes or so in the oven while your guests are enjoying salad...Wonderful!

This dish got rave reviews from some very sophisticated cooks. It is easily prepared in advance, allowing the hosts more time with their guests. It married well with a soft zinfandel.

The nutmeg and cinnamon flavors were too strong for my taste. They overpowered the salmon.
