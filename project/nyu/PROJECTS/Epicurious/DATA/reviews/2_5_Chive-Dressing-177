In response to the cook from Walnut Creek, I also enjoyed this recipe but note that tofu is not fat free. I'm certainly not trying to be a know-it-all but this recipe calls for about 15 grams of fat from soft tofu. Of course that's better than olive or canola oil but just wanted everyone to know that Tofu is a tasty alternative to oil but not a fat free solution.

Great texture, bland taste

Bland. My family did not care for it at all.

The flavor had improved after one day of refrigeration. Guests asked for the recipe.

Tofu must be processed in batches if using blender of small food processor to make a smooth sauce or mayonaisse. If done right, no one will know the difference from Kraft or others and it's fat free.
