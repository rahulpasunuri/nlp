Love this dough recipe - it's forgiving if you swap around the flours a bit too, as first time I made with wholewheat spelt flour instead of vital wheat gluten flour. It makes a lovely chewy blistered base & is by far the best pizza dough I've made. I was lucky enough to have foraged a whole basket of chanterelles so was looking for something different to use them in. My French friend was horrified that I was using them on pizza - until she had a bite ...

Excellent! Used whatever mushrooms are available. Nice earthy taste.

I used store-bought raw pizza dough to save time, and adding the toppings was dead simple. Used portobellos and oyster mushrooms, very tasty. Next time I will add some roasted garlic, but it's pretty good as is.

This was fantastic! We used store bought dough and chanterelles that we found in the woods. Added some sauteed onions and kale and we got rave reviews!

Easy recipe and very good taste. My husband and I love tomato sauce, so I used tomato sauce as first topping. We also added salami. Turned out great!

Crust is very good and easy to work with. I used 6 oz. portobello mushrooms, 3 sliced plum tomatoes, 1 lb. shredded mozzarella, 3/4 cup shaved parmesean, 10 sliced Greek kalamata olives, and 8 oz. Greek Byzantino Manouri (sheep's cheese); sprinkled with oregano. This made 2 pizzas. The filling was fantastic. I found the Greek style sheep cheese at a local ethnic supermarket, and it really made it great. The sheep's cheese is milder than goat cheese.

This was delicious. Instead of the chives, we added some caramelized onions. Yum!

I made this recipe as an appetizer for our company what a great hit! I added a little bit of pesto on top of the olive oil it gave the pizza a little kick!

An excellent recipe! It was delicious! This was the first time I made pizza dough and it was so simple and easy to work with. The crust was fantastic (it puffed at the edges and had a nice combination of crispy edges and some doughy parts).The topping is also superb! Just the perfect amount of cheese and mushrooms.

I used waaaaay more mushrooms than the recipe calls for. This pizza was delicious, the pizza dough was pretty good.

What can I say, except AMAZING. I have made this recipe several times and each time I get great raves from friends, They think I'm sort of Gourmet chef. I t is easy, especially the dough and can be done ahead of time and popped in the oven when ready.

This is a delicious pizza. It's great heated up in a toaster oven for lunch the next day, too. Then all your co-workers are super envious. I can usually find Shiitakes but not Chanterelles. So sometimes I've used sliced Baby Bellas, or substituted a wild mushroom mix that features Oyster mushrooms. Very delicious. The more goat cheese you put on, the better.

My favorite pizza. I sometimes substitute fontina for mozzarella.

Fabulous...I made this for a cocktail party and everyone devoured it within 15 minutes. I used alot more mushrooms and chopped them up small, as with the chives...will make again, and again!

I made this for a party & it was a hit. Everyone raved about it. I've never made dough before & after making it, I don't know why I was so afraid to do it. I will definitely make this again - it's easy and delicious.

This is a great pizza, and this crust recipe might become my standard.

This was good, but not great. It took me about four hours to prepare for only OK results. Next time I would use more mushrooms and slice them thicker. These bake to beautiful thin slivers, but so thin as to have not much flavor. The chevre I used was on the tart side and overpowered all other flavors. I would just use small dots next time instead of nickel-sized pieces. If you go to the effort to make the dough, do make a double batch because it was really tasty.

Exceptional! The crust was well worth the effort. This was a hit with my entire family, even my pick little two year old. Now we use the dough recipe for all our pizza nights.

Oustanding recipe. I cheated and used ready made pizza crust. Next time I will maybe add a few more mushrooms, but everyone loved it.

This was the first time that I made pizza dough and it was for company. Great!

Actually only made the topping (and substituted less expensive wild mushrooms for the chanterelles), but the pizzas were totally delicious. We bought ready-made raw pizza dough, and served them as hors d'oeuvres at a cocktail party. Big hit.

We too could not find the chanterelle mushrooms and substituted with other 'shrooms. The pizza is just delicious!! We all loved it.

Odd that a recipe calling for Chanterelle mushrooms would appear in a June issue! They are only fresh in the Fall and Winter. So I substituted a mix of fresh wild mushrooms available in the market. FABULOUS Results.

This was delicious. To save time I used a premade thin crust pizza dough. I followed the rest of the instructions and it turned out GREAT! Will definitely make again. A real winner.
