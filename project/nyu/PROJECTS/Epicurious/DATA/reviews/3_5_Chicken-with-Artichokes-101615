Both my husband and I really liked this dish. Everything was done as is other than the artichokes themselves. Due to the time of year, I had to substitute frozen artichoke hearts which worked out great. My mistake was also using frozen pearl onions to save some time and effort. They didn't brown up and carmelize and were rather tasteless. Bad move on my part. But would definitely make this again.

This recipe is easy, quick and delicious. It's one of those meals that can make a beginner look like a pro in the kitchen. More seasoned cooks will find it hard to resist improvising and modifying to suit personal tastes and pantry staples. I went with the previous suggestion to use Champagne vinegar (because I had it). I added some Red Pepper flakes to give it some heat. In the future I will try some other tricks. A shallot or two wouldn't hurt. You can easily do a "Provencale" turn on this one with the addition of some tomatoes and Kalamata olives. My guess is if you follow this recipe to the letter, it'll still be really tasty.

I've made this twice now and loved this recipe both times. I just used regular artichokes - quartered and cleaned according to recipe. Since regular artichokes need to cook longer, I browned them for a few minutes before adding in pearl onions. Then, I increased the vinegar to 1/2 cup cooked according to recipe and added in a quart of chicken stock + enough water to cover. I covered and let cook for about 5 minutes for adding back in the chicken and following recipe. I also added in some thyme and the flavor was perfect. It makes a lovely sauce and I served on top of a bed of orzo with sautéed spinach on the side.

A few modifications will make this recipe killer, I promise. First, crush the garlic and add it at the end of browining the onions/artichokes. Second, substitute Champagne Vinegar for the Red Wine Vinegar. Thirdly, Substitute good chicken stock for the water. This recipe will knock your socks off!!!

My husband & I did not care for this at all. It was edible the first time around, but then we tried the left-overs & had to throw it out. The flavor was bland. Definitely do not use canned artichokes! Maybe that was the problem, but even with fresh artichokes I don't think it would have been much better.

I have been making this recipe once a year for several years when the baby artichokes are available in the grocery store and my husband always loves it. The flavors are suble, the chicken very moist and we love the artichokes. I use a very heavy pan and there is always plenty of liquid at the end of 30 to 45 minutes of cooking. I spoon the liquid over the chicken and vegetables and serve with roasted red skin potatoes.

I love this recipe! However, 30 minutes is more than I needed. My chicken and veggies had burnt after only 10 minutes! It just needed heating up. Once I realized that, this is a favorite! I also used marinated artichokes instead which gave it a slight vinegar taste that I enjoy. I will make this many times to come!

I agree with the others about there being nothing special about the flavors. It was good, but not worth repeating, as the recipe reads.

I don't eat meat anymore, and I miss this recipe. Be sure to salt the chicken liberally or it might be bland. I substituted 2 boxes defrosted frozen articoke hearts (or 2 cans) and 1 bag defrosted frozen pearl onions to make it easier (and to make more of each; we fought over those). Be sure to cook both until they brown a bit to get deep, carmelized flavor. I also soak the articokes for as long as possible in lemon water & use that water rather than plain where it is called for l8r in recipe.

I gave this dish a test run with my family before making it for a client. I'm glad I did! The artichokes taste like artichokes, the chicken tastes like chicken, etc., but there is nothing to marry the ingredients. Tomorrow (when I cook it again) I will substitute balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and I will use half water and half wine to steam. Don't be afraid to use salt liberally--it brings out the flavors. Also--I put the juices from the bottom of the pot in a bowl and used it as a sauce--truthfully the most interesting part of the meal! A high quality organic chicken (Bell and Evans where we are) will make a big flavor difference. I served with a 4-grain pilaf tonight, will serve with risotto tomorrow. I think the subtle cheesiness of risotto will be a good enhancement.

I make this dish all the time, for myself and for company. It is superb. Think about it for a potluck dinner.

Smelled simply delicious, but lacked a distinctive flavor, in my opinion. My husband, however, really enjoyed this recipe. The simmering time should be reduced to 20 minutes to prevent over-cooking. Overall, a tasty and tender chicken dish.

Very tasty.

This was really good. Even my guests who weren't artichoke fans loved it.
