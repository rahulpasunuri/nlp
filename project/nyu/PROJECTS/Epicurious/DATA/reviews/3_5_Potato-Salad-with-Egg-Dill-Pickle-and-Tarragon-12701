try chives instead of tarragon and add in some paprika.

This is a delightful salad, but I couldn't help wondering what was missing. However, I later discovered it was the Dijon Mustard, I forgot to put it in. Having said this, it was still very tasty but will add a touch of Dijon to the left overs, it made more than enough... Will make it again and again...

this is a favorite. i make it all the time. i always use fresh tarragon from the garden, adding extra dry mustard seed for crunch and chopped cornichon.

I made double this recipe. I used all low fat dairy (a little yogurt too) and made the following additions: 2 hard boiled eggs, some finely grated lemon zest, and fresh dill. I would make this recipe again with the same alterations.

Great potato salad recipe, added an extra shallot, an extra egg little less dijon and a little more tarragon and it was pretty perfect. great with a little red pepper flake on top.

I've been searching for a good potato salad recipie for a long time, and this is the best. I too added 1 clove garlic. I used Total Greek strained yogurt instead of sour cream, and it worked out great. Next time, I might reduce the dijon mustard a bit, but otherwise wonderful.

The mustard overpowered the tarragon.

This is a wonderful potato salad. Because I was making it for a large group, I used 4 lbs. of potatoes and doubled the sauce ingredients - for the mayo/sour cream I used 1/2 c. each - and it turned out beautifully. Am making again for a cookout party tonight!

This was the first potato salad I have ever made and I must admit that it's the best one I've ever tasted. The addition of tarragon and dill added great depth and freshness to this traditional salad. I added several eggs and a bit of garlic...yum!!

This definitely makes more than two servings, three ample ones is more like it. But you'll certainly want to lap it all up yourself. This is just delicious. I added a bit more shallot than called for, used fresh tarragon from the garden, again, a tiny bit more, shook in a bit of garlic salt and paprika, and thought it to be the best potato salad I've ever made. It's fast, easy, and uses things you already have on hand.

a little more mustard, a little less mayo, add a clove of garlic and it's great!

Folks - I'm re-rating this recipe because I've made it three times so far and I've determined that you must use regular mayo - nothing low fat and the best is if you use a deli pickle - nothing jarred.....then it's unbelieveable.

The recipe was a hit. I did not have tarragon so I substituted dill instead, and it was delicious.

This was good, but more assertive than I had expected. I prefer the State Fair Potato Salad (this website).

So good that my husband asked me to make it two days in a row for an impromptu father's day cookout. It is so fast and easy with ingrediants you would normally have on hand that it was easy to say yes. It really needs double the pickle..

This is my favorite potato salad recipe. Just made it again this past weekend for a bbq and there was none left. The only change I make it to use fresh dill instead of the pickles (to taste)

This was delicious! Used French tarragon from my garden, red onion instead of shallots, and more pickles. Also little tiny potatoes from Napa Valley farmers' market. I couldn't wait for it to get cold--it was great slightly warm.

The sour cream added a nice smooth flavor as I am not a big mayonnaise fan. I added more chopped baby dill pickles to add a bit more zest. I did not have tarragon and added fresh dill. This gave the salad a nice fresh taste. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Yummy!! I modified the recipe a bit to suit my own tastes- added extra dill pickle, 3 eggs, more shallots, and several pieces of chopped, cooked bacon. Very good but serves more like 4 people instead of 2.

Delicious and easy, and just different enough to make it more interesting than regular potato salad. I also used dill relish, and added 4 eggs instead of one. Make a day ahead of serving for best flavor!

When I first made this recipe, everyone praised it as "the best potato salad ever". I admit I was a little generous with the tarragon and added more eggs and dill pickle. Definitely adding this to my list of recipes!

This is a heavenly salad ... a nice change of pace from "normal" potato salad. The tarragon dressing was delicious. I used baby Yukon Gold potatoes, fresh tarragon and chopped up a homemade garlic dill pickle. I did not add egg (forgot to boil it!) and the salad was still wonderful.

A very good, zippy version. I quartered the small potatoes for a chunkier bite and used dill pickle relish (both cut down on the prep). I also doubled the amount of onion, and added an extra hard-boiled egg white. Frankly, a little less mayo, sour cream and mustard wouldn't be missed; and lower-fat versions of the first two would work just fine.

The reason I choose this recipe was I love all the ingrediants, I added more dill pickle and egg. I thought the recipe was fine, but nothing spectacular. I would make again, but I'm still on the search for that wonderful potato salad.

The rule in our house is that I make the recipe exactly according to the recipe before I start making changes. First, and not a change - it can be prepared in 45 minutes, but ALLOW TIME FOR REFRIGERATION!!! This was very good, so not too many changes: I like egg in my potato salad, so I'd double or triple it (isn't it nice to be able to increase or delete egg if you want to? I don't add the yolk.) I also found myself searching for more pickle - I think I'd either increase it or chop it coarser. Also, I think I would change the shallot to red onion and increase the amount. Needs something for crunch too. Otherwise, a real keeper.

This recipe give potato salad a lift. The combination of the dill and taragon add bite.

Delish! Very light, not too creamy and the pickle and taragon combine perfectly. Always a hit!

I quadrupled this recipe for a fish fry and it was just wonderful.There's about three servings left in the bowl, it's been three days now, and it's still very good.Not too creamy and not too heavily seasoned, a picnic classic that makes great leftovers.(my 1st potato salad experience)

Very nice dish, I forgot to buy sour cream, so I added more mayonnaise to make up for missing sour cream.
