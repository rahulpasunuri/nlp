This is a good recipe, but the pan size is wrong. I used a 9 inch pie pan and it held 6 large peaches plus a half pint of blueberries, plus topping. I also made this with peaches and raspberries and it was sublime. Hint: I've been making crips for years and always double the topping recipe. Store the extra topping mix in the freezer. It is instantly available for the next time you have the fruit for a crisp. The topping is very forgiving: you can use less or more, to taste. I even make small fruit crisps to serve just the two of us. Love the flexibility!

I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 and used brown sugar. The peaches don't need to be sweetened. Loved it.

Loved reading all your reviews and was inspired to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup light brown, increase the granola to 1 cup(used one with nuts) and added a Tbs of instant tapioca. Oh, and I added a pint of raspberries to the peaches. Thanks everyone for the great tips!

VERY easy! I cut the sugar a bit, to account for the sweetness of the peaches and the OJ. I used granola that had whole almonds (Yummy with the peaches!). I will most definitely make this again, as it is so easy! I think it would be fun to try this with 2-3 different fruits next time, and serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. YUM!

So good and so easy! I try to put a "healthy" spin on everything I make, so I used Ezekiel (sprouted grain cereal) to replace the granola. To sweeten, I used very little brown sugar and light agave...With ripe peaches, it's really not necessary to add sweetners. The cinnamon/nutmeg combo really made this dish wonderful. It was so light and tasty! Everyone was fighting over seconds.

I added a lot of oatmeal and dried fruits and nuts and reduced the sugar by half and it was exceptionally good--especially just out of the oven with a dollop of creme fraiche.

I love crisps and this is a delicious way to use summer's crop of juicy peaches.

I've had problems before with fruit crisp recipes ending up too mushy/liquidy. I had slightly less than 3 pounds of peaches and threw a splash of balsamic on them and added lemon zest and a pinch of corn starch. I upped the dry content by adding granola and regular rolled oats (around 1/2 cup). I usually prefer brown sugar in my desserts so I split the sugar. Despite that higher dry/peaches ratio I had, it's still a little on the wet side with just a very thin layer of crispiness. Taste-wise I have no complaints, it tastes like summer.

very simple to make with a pleasing end result! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the peaches and OJ and decreased the baking time by about ten minutes .Next time I would replace some of the white sugar with light brown dark sugar (maybe 1/3 to half a cup), and decrease the baking time a few more minutes.

I had no difficulty with the crisp being too soggy. Excellent and easy recipe.

Delicious! This is a winner! I have made it twice this summer to rave reviews from all. I throw a tablespoon or less of tapioca into the peach mixture which helps to avoid the "soggy mess" comments and tend to add a bunch more granola 'cause I really like the crisp in crisps! Enjoy!

Great recipe, quick and simple, looks pretty and tastes wonderful!

I wish I could agree with the other reviews and say that this was great, but despite following the recipe to the letter, it turned out a horrible, soggy mess. There was nothing *crisp* about this peach crisp. Perhaps the fault is mine: our neighbor gave us some giant, home-grown "eat-over-the-kitchen-sink" kind of peaches, and I probably should have done just that with them. Instead, I used them in this recipe, and am afraid I wasted a bit of nature's bounty. :-(

Delicious. I changed the recipe just a tad by adding a little bit of chopped pear and apple juice. It was just delicious. Also, using a vanilla granola is great. Next time, I'm going to add a little lemonade, but I didn't have any accessible.

Delicious! A wonderfully simple desert that pleases most palates! Apples, pears, or any other similar fruit works as well as peaches. Highly recommended! Great with sweet desert wine!

This is one of these great recipes that you can use as a base for pretty much any fruit and then easily adjust. I'm not sure why it says to use a granola without fruit in it. . . I have and it is delicious.

I didn't read the recipe very carefully when I decided to make it, so I didn't have a couple of the ingredients on hand. I substituted orange juice with Gran Gala orange liquor and granola with rolled oats. It was fantastic and my guest were asking for seconds! It is a definite keeper and I have already made it a second time.

good and easy recipe. i put in less sugar but still found it too sweet. the sweetness of the granola is something to consider. i also left the peach skins on and found that worked fine. definitely a keeper but next time i'll do 2/3 a cup sugar.

This is so easy and so good. I used Quaker "oats and honey" granola cereal because that's what I had on hand. I also added a cup of pitted bing cherries I had in the frig that were a bit past their prime. Fine as is without ice cream.

*I* used red river grapefruit juice instead of the OJ - it was all that I had. It was delicous!

This was so easy! I had a few peaches that seemed to be near their prime, so I used them with this. I used pecan granola, which was delicious with the peaches. I would definitely make this again!

Made this using 1 C. Nature Valley Oat 'n Honey granola bars crushed, 1/4 C. sugar instead of 1 cup, 1/4 C. brown sugar and 1/4 C. fresh lemon juice instead of orange juice; everyone raved about it. Very good and easy to make. Also, I simply comvined the peaches and the lemon juice in a bowl and since I wasn't ready to finish off the dish, put this in the fridge for about 2 hours bafore putting in baking dish and topping with granola mixture. Next time I'll use Splenda instead of white sugar.

Good and easy! Used nectarines and added a little extra sugar since they weren't quite ripe. It was delicious. A potato peeler worked well on the nectarines.

This recipe was super easy and very tasty! I didn't have granola on hand so I substituted uncooked oatmeal, I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Next time I will try granola and see it if adds a bit of crunch. The nutmeg (and cinnamon, as well) adds great flavor that compliments the peaches. I will definitely make this one again - make sure to cut your peaches to the size recommended...if you cut them too small they will not hold their shape as the cook.

My company really loved this dessert, so I will probably add it to my list of "things I can make". I used chopped pecans and oatbran flakes instead of granola; it worked fine.

I love peaches. If you do too, try this! The granola is a great complement. Didn't peel the peaches and didn't notice because it tasted so good. Used praline vanilla ice cream. Hurry before peaches are out of season!

Yummy! Peeling the peaches isn't necessary.

Definitely would make this again. My husband thought it was very good especially warm as suggested. The note part to peel the peaches came in handy. I did however did not use ice cream instead I used whipped cream which gave it a good taste.

This crisp recipe is so easy and is definately a family pleaser. I did add a tiny bit more salt than it called for because I felt it would not contrast the icecream topping very well.
