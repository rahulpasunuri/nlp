This might be the best ice cream (really not ice cream...gelato) that I have ever tasted, much less made. Cacao nibs are ALWAYS in the cupboard now, in case I have the advance notice and prep time to make it.

I was skeptical when I started making this recipe but it turned out amazing! The nibs add an incredible dimension to the gelato. I will certainly make this recipe again. Thanks to the reader who pointed out the typo in the recipe -- the instructions repeat steps when it comes to making the custard.

Absolutely wonderful, loved the subtle cocoa flavor from the nibs. I used some I had ordered from Askinosie. Highly recommended. The accompanying brownies were great too!

Was absolutely delicous. Will definetly make this one again and again!!! Was very creamy and the flavor of the cacao nibs and vanilla infused into the cream was perfect. just like gelato should be.

Excellent! Be careful, the recipe reads twice, so don't add extra egg yolks in when you don't have too. The nibs add a rich chocolate flavor into the creamy gelato. I also added chopped Guittard milk chocolate chips during the last 5min of mixing. Adding a bit of crunch to the creaminess. This was great recipe to try out 1st on my Cuisinart Ice Cream maker - maiden voyage. Will definitely make again!
