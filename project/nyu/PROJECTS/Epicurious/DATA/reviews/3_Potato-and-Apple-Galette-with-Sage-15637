Very easy and reliable - you can use an inexpensive mandolin to cut the potatos and apples - it really makes it simple to prepare. I agree - any herbs will do. Not a standout dish - but a great companion dish if you have other items with stonger flavors and sauces that can be sopped up by this galette

I made this recipe twice in 5 days, once for Christmas, and then today to see how it would taste if it actually didn't get overdone. The first time it got very overcooked because I kept it in the oven for an hour like the recipe said. It smelled great, but the first inch and the bottom were very crunchy and overdone. I made it again tonight and watched it carefully and found it was done in half an hour! I also salted the potatoes after putting in the butter and sage (which I didn't do the first time) and had a puddle of water at the bottom of the bowl by the time I put the last layer of potatoes on. Besides watching the galette very closely because the cooking time will vary according to your oven and the thickness of your potato/apple slices, the other suggestion I'd have for anyone making this dish is to make sure your potatoes and apple are room temperature. Otherwise, your melted butter will congeal in lumps and you won't be able to get it evenly over all your slices. This is a very pretty dish and smells great. Even with using a mandoline, it's quite a production. It impressed everyone, even the good friend who tried to console me after the first one got fried, but I wouldn't make it for an everyday meal.

This recipe is really nothing special, taste-wise, but it looks nice. I'd definitely amplify the comments about adding salt, and I imagine the addition of a complementary cheese (probably sharp cheddar, to go with the apple), would ratchet up the flavor a bit.

this is a very easy recipe. It's not something you would make to impress, but it's easy enough to make any time for dinner. You don't have to use sage only- I used thyme, rosemary and sage.

I loved this! Unlike other reviewers, I thought it was SUCH an easy dish to make. I love that there are only a few ingredients and yet they combine to make a flavor that we don't experience much so it was unique and delicious. I only needed to bake for 40 minutes, perhaps because my potatoes were sliced more thinly than 1/8 in. I used a Braeburn apple because that's what I had, then before broiling I sprinkled some grated cheddar on top. I think it would also make a wonderful brunch item.

It was very tasty, and although a bit time consuming worth the time. Served it with pork tenderloin with orange sauce. Everybody loved it.

I made 2. One vegan so margerine instead of butter - didn't come out quite as pretty but effective. The other one I made according to recipe, but added some shredded smoked cheddar in the middle. Very tasty. Somewhat time consuming but good to make ahead. I took them out of the oven a bit early and let them sit. Broiled when I was ready to serve. Worked out great!

the combination of apple and potato is great, here in Germany a mixture of mashed potato and apples is called "Himmel und Erde" or,"Heaven and Earth!" I think the process could be simplified, by just tossing it all together after arranging the first layer.

I made mine in a cast iron skillet, and it was done after a little more than 30 minutes -- watch the galette! I was surprised at how well it inverted and how beautiful it was. One change: this recipe really needs salt, and I'm not even a salt fan; I'd recommend adding salt to the butter mixture. I made this for a normal week night so I cut down on the fat to about 1.5 tablespoons, brushing the slices with butter; I've made other potato galettes before (namely the Crusty Potato Galette, also on this site) and less than this has been ample. However, maybe it's my own fault for reducing the amount of butter, but I wasn't blown away by the flavor of this recipe; it basically tasted like browned potatoes, apples, and sage. My boyfriend loves potatoes, so he really liked it. However, since I made it, I know that it took more work than other potato recipes, so I know that it's not going to become a stand-by. Definitely try the less time-consuming, equally beautiful, and even more delicious Crusty Potato Galette.

I also had the problem of the bottom almost burning, so I didn't even need to put it under the broiler. Great taste with the slight sweetness of the apple, and also very buttery.

Delicious! Very moist and buttery, the apples give it a nice sweetness. Looking at the quantities, I was concerned that this wouldn't actually be enough to feed 6 people but it was plenty. Tried it with thyme instead of sage, which was good. I served it with the Pork Tenderlion with Balsamic-Cranberry sauce from this site.

Excellent side dish for either beef tenderloin or lamb. I'm not a great fan of sage, so I replaced it with rosemary. Great make ahead recipe. Reheats very well.

Loved this dish! Next time, however, I'd cook it less time--the potatoes on the bottom burned and it didn't look as attractive as it could. Also agree with the comment about adding more sage.

I have made this dish for my husband and for friends and have received rave reviews. I find it goes particularly well with pork and is a nice change from mashed potatoes. In addition it's easy to make. Bravo Bon Appetit for another winning recipe.

We loved the texture of this dish, but I'm going to double or triple the amount of sage next time. I made it as part of a Thanksgiving-style turkey dinner, and it was a big hit.
