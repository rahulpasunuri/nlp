Very easy, nutritious, tasty dish. Next time I'll do a few things differently... I'll double or triple the sauce portion of the recipe... I'll cut the chicken into smaller pieces.. I'll add some red pepper to the sauce (turmeric is a terrific anti-cancer spice, but it doesn't digest well without pepper)...

I used more garlic, more curry, less liquid and I used College Inn's Thai Coconut Curry broth in both the chicken and the couscous. That made a DRASTIC improvement!

This is a good starting point, but I had to make a few alterations. First, it needs significantly more garlic. Using only one clove kind of defeats the purpose. I also found for my tastes that it needed more curry, but I do like spicy foods. I also used 2 florets of cauliflower and 2 florets of broccoli which made it more substantial. I would definitely slice the chicken into think strips, and cook for about 2-3 minutes before adding the water and vegetables. The chicken was too dry cooking it as long as the recipe calls before before simmering for 15 minutes. Next time I might use chicken tenders instead. Over couscous was great, and a nice substitute for brown rice.

I thought this dish had potential as a healthy, hearty meal, but I made several changes that I think helped it along. When I added the chicken, I only allowed it to brown on the outside before adding the veggies. I think this prevented overcooking the chicken. Also, rather than simply adding water, I used chicken broth, which lends much more flavor without adding a lot of calories. Finally, when the vegetables were almost done, I noticed that the sauce was going to be very runny and would not bind well to the couscous/rice. I took 1 T of corn starch and made a paste with cold water, then added it to the pan for the last couple of minutes of cooking, allowing it to boil until thickened. I happened to have zucchini and a shallot on hand rather than broccoli and onion, so this may have changed the flavor a bit as well. Great over rice. Next time I'd like to try adding some cashews...

I was pleased with the health and wholesomeness of this recipe, and it smelled great while I was cooking it, but we were disappointed with the end product. It just has a real "heavy" taste without a lot of flavor. I'm not an expert on curries, as I tried this in my quest to find a good chicken curry (and I had some veggie tray leftovers to use up). I'll keep looking... One thing that might improve it -- I added some plain yogurt when I ate the leftovers and it lightened up the flavor a bit and made it quite palatable for a very healthy and balanced meal.

This was okay, but it definitely needs some changes. What I cant really point out, but it lacked the intense flavor and rich sauce I expect when making curry.
