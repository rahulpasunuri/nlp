Delicious-I didn't make the sauce and instead topped with fat free redi whip and sliced strawberries. I also added a teaspoon of espresso powder to the melted chocalate. The perfect size for a sweet bite after dinner.

I did not make the sauce. We thought these were excellent, and no one guessed they were light. I used semisweet chocolate instead of bittersweet. The cakes also took longer to bake (about 17 minutes).

I've made this recipie twice. I think it tastes very good for 139 calories. The first time I made the sauce as directed, but the second time I made it a vanilla sauce and used a whole vanilla bean--very good. I also used sugar-free chocolate syrup to decorate the plate before adding the cake. The cake is very light, similar in texture to a soufflle, and only a few bites, but what else would you expect for 139 calories? I'll make it again for guests who want a healthy treat.
