I left it in the fridge for about 10 hrs and absolutely loved it. :)

I agree with the last review...this needs a minimum of 6 hours to marinate...the longer the better....I marinated for only 5 and 1/2 hours and the flavour was only slightly there, and if I didn't know I had marinated it in what I did, I might of thought it wasn't marinated at all....overnight would be the key...

This is one of our favorite treatments to steak. I usually end up with delmonico's, but imagine it is great with any steak. It is a delicate yet "zingy" approach to a marinade for beef. I've made it many times -- I do believe the trick is to marinade it for at least the time suggested or overnight.

I am surely spoiled by the many great recipes on this web site, but this one did not do much for me or my guests. Unless I prepared something incorrectly, the marinade for this particular steak dish is rather bland. Look around....there are better steak dishes on these pages.

This is one of our all-time favorites! The lemon juice gets the meat so tender - sometimes I marniate for even longer than the recipe calls for. We love the combination of the lemon and rosemary with beef. Great, easy recipe for a spring or summer barbeque.

very different. I sometimes do lamb this way but usually also add dijon mustard and crushed garlic pods to the marinade. add mesquite(or other favorite wood chips soaked in soapy water) to the bbq fire for a still more different flavor/
