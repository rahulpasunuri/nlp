I used a Whole Foods brined turkey - did not bother putting the butter under the skin. Followed recipe otherwise - the turkey and gravy with the truffle butter were fantastic. I cook my turkeys breast side down and cook to 165-170 the meat was absolute perfection. Most definitely will make again.

I don't usually rate things because I always alter the recipe somehow, just to fit what I have on hand. I wanted to rate this one so that others would consider the high heat bake time. I have never baked a turkey at 450F, and I have to say that when I peered in after twenty minutes and saw the really dark skin, I was afraid it was going to be horribly burnt with the rest underdone. It turned out PERFECT. I made "truffle butter" by melting an entire stick of butter and adding about a teaspoon of white truffle oil and about 1.5 tablespoons of sea salt. I rubbed this concoction all over the turkey, underneath the skin, being careful to spread the salt around as evenly as possible. Cut up onions filled the turkey cavity, and I positioned some slices under the skin as well. I poured martinelli's over the turkey, letting about a cup of it pool in the bottom of the pan (I always do this), popped it into the 450F oven and then kept basting with pan juices and added martinelli's as necessary (about every 15 min). The turkey is the most moist I have ever made, and I must say that my turkeys are always moist. It also had a nice truffle flavor. I had been worried about the taste cooking out with the high heat, but that wasn't an issue at all. I hope this review helps. Happy turkey baking!

I did not use black-truffle butter with the turkey but I did add 1.5 tb of infused black truffled oil with the butter in the white wine gravy. To die for!

I did this on the cheap, adding truffle salt and truffle olive oil to the butter - and it was DELICIOUS. I set the oven at 400, which was perfect for the turkey, so I could cook a plate of stuffing and some other things at the same time. Skin was crisp, but not burnt and the turkey was really moist. I added a little more water to the roasting pan (and with more frequency) than the recipe called for, and I think it made a big difference.

i've been marking this turkey for 2 thanksgiving in a row now. it's so tasty that i haven't tried anything new. yes the truffle butter is expensive but come on....it's thanksgiving! i'd have to say my favorite part about this turkey really is the gravy. if you're worried about burning the turkey, put foil on it and remove it prior to serving to let it crisp. i think it even says that in the recipe. stay moist my friends.

I made my own truffle butter (2oz black truffles/8oz unsalted butter + fleur de sal to taste) to make this more affordable (still ended up spending way more on the truffles than on the turkey). Brined the turkey for 24 hours. Roasted in a convection oven @450 for 45 mins, 350 for 45 minutes and it was still slightly overdone. The brining + the butter saved me -- the meat was still moist...but alas, no truffle flavor! Will probably not make this again.

careful with the oven temp. 450 is way too high. i burned my turkey thanks to this ridiculous recipe.

For the expense of the truffle butter, there wasn't even a hint of flavor when the bird was done. And high heat cooking in a conventional oven resulted in slightly overdone breast and slightly underdone thigh. Gravy was sensational, as was the stuffing. The turkey was a major disappointment.

I am not a gravy fan, but this was by far the best I've had on turkey. Did not deviate from the gravy recipe, but did make the flour/truffle butter paste the day before which was a help. For the turkey, we brined it for two days, and then rubbed the butter under the breasts. I was nervous to not put anything on the outside other than the salt and pepper, but I was amazed at how crisp the skin was. Temperature wise, I cooked on convection roast at 400 for 20 minutes, then dropped to 350 and the 16 pound turkey was still done in 1 hour and 40 minutes. Given the expense of the butter (I paid $10 per 3 oz) this was a failproof recipe and SOOO worth the end result!

For a turkey novice, this was an effortless recipe resulting in fantastic flavor. The turkey skin was crisp, the meat moist, and the gravy accompanied well. A nice twist from the standard flavors. Buy your truffles separate and make your own butter to reduce costs. I would also increase the amount of truffle butter, if your wallet allows!

We made this turkey for Thanksgiving with local Oregon truffles from our farmer's market and a heritage turkey. We'd made truffled turkeys before, but this is by far the best recipe we've come across. We brined the turkey on the Monday night before Thanksgiving. We then took the turkey out of the brine on Wednesday night and rubbed on the truffle butter and let it sit in the fridge overnight. This resulted in the moistest, most delicious turkey we've ever had. Because we really like truffles, we actually put whole slices of truffle under the skin, in addition to the truffle butter, which made the turkey even more delicious. The gravy also turned out wonderfully and full of truffle-y goodness.

One of the best turkey's I've made. I did use a 13.75# free range heritage turkey. It was cooked within 1.5 hours in a 450 degree convection oven. The high cost of the truffle butter was the reason for the 3 fork rating. Using regular butter in place of truffle butter for the rub may be an option. Adding a touch of black truffle oil to the gravy may be a cost saving option.

Wonderful....I first did a dried herb salt(recipe from salted roast turkey with herbs and shallot-dijon gravy)overnight and then put the truffle the following evening. It was moist, crispy golden and delicious. I used a 20 lb turkey and it only took 2 hours at 450 in a convection oven. This will be part of my Thanksgiving tradition forever.
