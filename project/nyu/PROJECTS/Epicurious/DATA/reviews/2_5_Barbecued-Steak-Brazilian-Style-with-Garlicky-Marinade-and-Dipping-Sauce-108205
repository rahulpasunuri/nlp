Despite the incorrect names and lack of geographical knowledge, I loved the spicy marinade. Will definitely make it again.

As an American who has experienced the bitter pain and embarrassment of fellow Americans not only butchering other countries history but exhibiting blatent ignorance of other cultures and their culinary past. Thanks to all of the previous readers comment's for setting the record straight. I wish for a world where I can boldly step into an American restaurant and peruse a menu confindently knowing the culinary correct terms are correct. (heavy sigh) Cheers!!

For a churrasco in Sao Paulo, Rio, Minas, etc. the most common sauce accompaniment to steak is "vinagrete" which is not spicy -- made from tomato, onion, bell peppers and vinegar.

This whole recipe is ludicrous to borderline offensive. While the pampas and gauchos do extend into Brazil, they are more associated with Argentina and Uruguay -- the 2 countries were chimichurri sauce is made. Chimichurri is not from Brazil. Thus I struggle to understand how steak marinated in a sauce from Argentina / Uruguay is Brazilian and why the recipe has supposedly Brazilian foods listed in Spanish (they speak Portuguese in Brazil). Brazil is a country the size of the U.S. with a population of almost 200 million people in neighboring Latin America -- it's a bit ridiculous to so blithely confuse the country with it's neighbors.

First, as Mr. Van Aken states, the chimichurri sauce is not Brazilian (not even sure if it is from Argentina - I've been told it is from Uruguay). Second, it is not common to marinate steaks in our country. We do it sometimes, but it is not a tradition. Third, Brasil is a continental size country, and it is often a irresponsible simplification call any dish "Brazilian Style". Would anyone say that a NY style steak is the same as a Texas or Missouri style steak? In Rio de Janeiro, traditional "churrasco" is made only with kosher salt, over high-heat charcoal fire, rare to medium-rare. Just like the primitive "gauchos".

After reading the reviews, I cut back slightly on the cayenne. Even so, this is really nasty. It's an unpleasant vinegary hot that no one liked. We threw away a lot of expensive beef.

The red sauce is good, but much too hot to marinate the steak in. It was almost inedible for my American friends. Make this sauce and serve it on the side, along with the green Chimicurri and marinate your steak in something else such as a red wine based vinaigrette with basil/garlic/onions.

Used flank steak and marinated overnight. Very easy and delicious! Will definitely make again.
