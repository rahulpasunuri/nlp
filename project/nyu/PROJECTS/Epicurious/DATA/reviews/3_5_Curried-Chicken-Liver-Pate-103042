I didn't enjoy the flavor of this really. It's 'OK' but I wouldn't make it again. I used a Madras curry powder which is a hot spicy powder, perhaps a mild sweet one may be better, but overall it just tastes 'wrong'.

Just made this recipe and really loved it. I made it with lamb's liver instead of chicken's, and soaked the liver in milk overnight first. Very unusual flavor, the curry masks that iron taste you get with liver. Great pate for people that don't care for liver! As the other reviewers have said, this recipe does make a lot of pate.

it is incredible, what about that it's too much, if you pack it in marienfilm, you can freeze it forever.

Got great reception at a recent dinner party. it makes about 3 cups of pate, but you can freeze it, or give it away to your guests. It's also a very cheap recipe, as chicken livers are inexpensive. Next time I would increase the amount of curry to give it more kick.

I have made this many times during the past year. Everyone seems to really like it. It does indeed make a large amount of pate. What I do is put the entire amount in the refrigerator over night to let the flavors blend. The next day I divide it among several different sized containers and freeze them. There is little if any loss of flavor and I always have something for unexpected company.

A crowd pleaser-yes it makes 3-1/2 cups, but can be easily halved. Delicious flavors and inexpensive and it's a cinch to make and can be made a couple of days ahead. People always enjoy when this is served since the food police have outlawed pate!

thanks to my previous reviewers, i cut the recipe in half and still had a ton of pate. instead of chicken livers i used turkey livers (that i'd been saving in my freezer in milk) and cut the alcohol from the recipe. i took this to a thankgiving party where it disappeared in 2 minutes flat! so yummy!

Although this recipe was very simple and easy to make,it was far to much pate. also, i think i would have been better off serving alpo instead of this crap.it was disgusting.

Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party. Everyone raved about it and begged for the recipe. Did use as much butter as is specified and it was still very creamy and rich.

This is a great pate best made the day before. It is very easy to make and also very cheap. Unless you are making it for a large party I would halve the quanties as it does make rather a lot and a little goes along way.

This got raves, and I mean, raves from my guests. They liked not only the pate, which is easy to make, but also the baguette slices baked with oil, salt, and pepper. I suspect there are three things that are important to the seasoning of this recipe -- first, a really good curry powder (I used a sweet curry powder from Penzey's), good brandy (Courvosier), and, for the bread, good olive oil. Hate to say it, but grocery store spices and oils are not the best -- go to the catalogs or specialty stores. I agree with the review that states that this recipe makes a lot -- it is enough for a party. I solved that problem by molding the pate in two small ramekins, lined with a sheet of saran wrap for easy unmolding. I used one for my dinner party of 6 (about half left over for rest-of-the-week snacks) and I am freezing the other for use later in the month when we have guests.

This was very easy to make, and better than most of the pates I've bought. The only problem I had was that it was just entirely too much pate. Would make for a party.
