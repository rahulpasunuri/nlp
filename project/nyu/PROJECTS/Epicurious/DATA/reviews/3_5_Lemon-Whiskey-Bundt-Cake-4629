This cake recipe is easy and delicious. I didn't make the whiskey glaze, I made a traditional chocolate glaze to drizzle over the cake instead. Everybody loved it. The recipe says to not use skim milk, worked really well for me, no difference whatsoever. Used the zest of one lemon plus juice. Will do it again and again and again...

This was very popular at work. I personally thought the whiskey was a bit strong and it could use a bit more lemon. I had followed other reviewers and used the zest of one lemon and the juice of a lemon. I'm going to make this again today with limoncello instead of whiskey.

Made this cake last night. Cut oil in half, used lots of lemon juice and left out the nuts.Extra zest helped too. Delicious! I used a simple mocha frosting recipe to drizzle over the cake.

Made this as a birthday cake for a friend who loves whiskey cake. Also took it camping. Not one bite left - a total hit. More lemon is mo betta - zest, juice, throw it all in.

a nice recipe, but nothing outstanding. very easy to make and certainly use more whisky and more lemon than called for. we make a similar recipe with rum that is identical to a Tortuga Rum Cake which is much better. I would make it again.

I added lemon zest and lemon juice per previous reviewers, however by the 2nd day the cake had "mellowed" to the point of just tasting like plain yellow cake - no significant lemon or whiskey flavor. This recipe makes a nice moist easy yellow cake, but tastes fairly uninteresting unless eaten the first day.

Very good. Next time I'll leave out the nuts--bleck. I went with other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the oil, and added lemon zest and juice. Next time I'll add even a bit more juice.

Following other reviewers' advice, I used zest from two lemons and juice from one. Also cut oil in half. Recipe was a crowd-pleaser!

ALthough I make it the original way I also do chocolate cake mix and pudding, no lemon. Great take-with or camping cake as can slice for a container or take whole.

Never thought I'd be ecstatic about a mix but this works with the additives. Not lemony but more whiskied (who complains?) It cooked earlier than advised. Moist (that magic necessity) and flavorsome as it melts in the mouth.

First of all, I divided the recipe in half as I was making in the mini-bundt cake pans (6 mini cakes). I took the advice of another reviewer and added the juice of half of a lemon (since I was making half the recipe), but I added the full amount of lemon peel. Also I let the syrup cool and then spooned it over the top of the cake prior to serving. A huge success!

After reading other people's comments that lemon flavor was not pronounced enough, I added juice from one large lemon to batter. I also added 1/4 cup light sour cream to the milk, because I did not have whole milk in the house. Lastly, I mixed the pecans with walnuts. The cake had a wonderful texture and just enough lemon flavor. Everyone asked for a second slice!

An easy/quick cake. I used lemon cake mix, instant vanilla pudding, chopped walnuts and Seagram's 7. Best served the next day as other reviewers suggested as the syrup has a chance to set in.

This was O.K. Used a yellow cake mix, the cake was lacking in lemon flavor. I even added about twice as much lemon zest. The whiskey sauce was also not very strong, I may have cooked it too long, not sure. I even added a little extra whiskey and lemon juice to it and poked the holes with skewers. The cake was very moist. Also made thinned cream cheese icing with extra lemon juice, still not lemony enough. The pecans were not very flavorful, added texture but were not crisp or nutty. I would toast them if I made it again, which I probably won't. It was a nice moist cake, just not very much flavor. Totally unable to stand up to vanilla icecream, just tasted like warm mush, better alone.

So simple to make, and delicious. I follow the recipe exactly, and I get requests for this cake just about every time I get invited for dinner.

I made the recipe pretty much to a T. I did use a skewer to poke holes for the syrup as suggested. Mine baked for about 45 minutes. The overall effect was pretty good but I expected more of the lemon and whiskey flavor to come through (I was thinking like rum cake). I used good bourbon, Makers Mark and would have liked the flavor to be more prominent. I very rarely cook with mixes, but this was quick and didn't taste like a mix. I would try the lemon cake mix next time to increase the lemon flavor. Overall it was a nice quick dessert, just didn't blow me away.

I added about 3/4 cup of marmalade and left out the pecans, this time. Yum. Also followed another reviewers' advice and thinned cream cheese frosting to drizzle over the top. It made about 6 mini loaf pans--great for gifts.

Great cake, everyone loved it. I used rum instead of whiskey, turned out great.

I made the cake with the lemon cake mix as recommended above. It was delicious!!! I also poured thined out cream chees icing over it. It really complemented the cake. For the whiskey I used Jack Daniels, but I think that it would also taste good with Cointreau or Amaretto. The cake was super fast and easy to make and I will definitely make it again!

I have made this cake numerous times. The best was my dad's birthday where traditional rum cake used to be tradition. It's simple, attractive, and yummy. Being a bourbon snob, I only use Kentucky bourbon in such recipes. They have a great fullness to their flavor. I also have substituted orange for lemon for the flavoring even to the point of adding a splash of Grand Marnier or other orange liquer to the sauce!

This is agreat cake if you need something quick. I have a question about this receipe. In Canada, we have Canadian (Rye) Whiskey. There is also bourbon whiskey, scotch whiskey, Jack Daniels, etc. I used Rye Whiskey but wondered if that made it a little less flavorful. What are others using?

My husband makes this often for holiday parties in the Williams-Sonoma cathedral bundt mold with a dusting of confectioner's sugar. It always looks spectacular for such an easy cake. Everyone raves about it and goes for seconds. Best served fairly warm with ice cream.

I too used a lemon cake mix rather than the yellow. It was absolutely delicious! Everyone had seconds. It makes a very moist and light cake that would be a refreshing dessert after a heavy meal or on a warm, summer night.

THis was a great way to use some whiskey that we have in our liquor closet and never used. The cake was easy to make and was delious with vanilla ice cream on top.

I liked the cake, probably won't make it again though. I accidentally used a lemon cake mix, but didn't think it was too lemony. I guess that personally, I would just prefer a different lemon cake. I love lemon desserts. Don't let my review discourage you, it was good, very moist, I just probably won't make it again.

This is a great recipe to bring to a party - I made it the night before as many suggested and it was perfect! People didn't believe it was home-made - it looked as pretty as the bakery cakes that others brought and tasted much better. This one goes in the recipe box!

The cake was delicious but I did make one change. I used a white drizzle icing instead of the whiskey icing. Everyone loved it.

I made this cake to take to a St. Patrick's Day party. It was a big hit! Extremely easy to make and delicious. I decorated the top with green marischino cherries to give it a holiday look. In fact, it was so good I'm making another one to take to a party this weekend.

This turned out to be a perfect cake for a quick party. It is a lovely cake and moist. I was careful to buy a cake mix without pudding in it and after I took it out of the oven I let it set for about 15 minutes and then poked some slim holes with a fine skewer and then poured the whisky, sugar, butter mixture over carefully. I left it covered all night, then decanted it the next morning. I normally do not use cake mixes, but this is a very impressive looking cake and its definitely moist.

I made this cake for a family camping trip, and it got rave reviews from all who tried it. I baked it on Thursday, we didn't eat it until Sunday, and the flavor was wonderful. The only change I made was to only use 1/4 cup of Maker's Mark bourbon in the syrup, and used a metal skewer to poke holes all over the cake prior to spooning the syrup over.

This cake took about 53 minutes in my oven and turned out well. I accidentally used 3/4 cup whiskey in the cake itself, which made for a bit much. You should probably allow it to cool somewhat before pouring the sauce over, as it tends to concentrate all in one area of the cake otherwise. The flavor is excellent, however, and it is easy to make.

Others liked this cake a lot, but for some reason, it didn't appeal to my taste. It does keep VERY WELL (I made it a week ago and we're still eating it).

My first attempt at this one was a huge disaster. I was using my new silicone deep savarin pan - "cooks evenly and completely" and "cooking times may be slightly shorter than with ordinary baking tins" - Not True. Also didn't wait long enough to pour hot syrup over the top. The center collapsed into a gooey mush. As it was for a pot luck the next day, I pulled out a frozen lasagne for my contribution and then tried to salvage a least a portion of the "cake". Ugly as it was the flavor of the cooked outer portion was great and I even had requests for the recipe! I made it again a week later ignoring the shorter baking recommendation and made sure to check doneness very near the center with success. The lemon flavor still isn't quite high enough for me so will try with a lemon cake mix for the next baking.

I served this to my sister and her husband the first day and my son and his fiance the next night. It actually got better the second day! Very easy and just delicious. It took longer than the 50 minutes called for - at least in my oven. I'll be serving this to my book club this week.

I was so surprised how easy it was. The result was superb, moist and delicious cake. I might add little bit more whiskey next time.

This is a superb recipe. The flavor is outstanding, it's very quick and easy to make, and the longer it sits, the more moist it seems to get. Recommendations: Poke holes in the cake with a long-tined meat fork or bamboo skewer before spooning the syrup over the hot cake, and make the cake the day before you plan to serve it so the syrup has a chance to spread and moisten the whole cake. Everyone who's ever tasted this cake is wild for it. It seems like it should be too sweet from the syrup, but the lemon seems to cut the sweetness just enough. Another hint: When I have extra lemons, I grate the rind and freeze it so this cake really can be put together in minutes.

I make another cake identical to this one, except for the syrup. In mine I add one shot of Whiskey to the ingredients. While the syrup is cooking I "poke" holes all over the cake with a big turning fork. This way the syrup goes into the holes and soaks into the cake. This cake has always been a big hit.

This cake was really delicious and very simple to make. It seemed that there was too much glaze as I was pouring it on, but it did seep into the cake. I wouldn't recommend keeping the leftovers for more than 2 days.
