Best Potato Salad ever! It is definitely the sauce that makes it! I add a few extra veggies (for texture only because I like some crunch in my PS) like celery or sweet pickle, but the recipe is great without any additions. Simple, fresh and a great side dish for any meal or picnic.

Great recipe. 13 year old son commented on how good it was, can't beat that. I would reduce amount of horseradish next time to 2 Tablespoons and I added 4 pieces of chopped crispy bacon. Will make this again.

Really good way to use up all those late summer chives brimming from your pots. The horseradish and vinegar add a nice tangy zip.

We really loved this version of potato salad. I'm not a fan of hard-boiled eggs so this was a great alternative to classic potato salad. The horseradish gave it a really nice tang and the sour cream cut down on the mayonaise-heavy taste of most other potato salads. Yum.

This is a great recipe. I have made this my standard potato salad, it get even more enjoyable each time I make it now. Try adding a 1/2 cup of crisp cooked Applewood smoked bacon. This a great potato salad with steaks.

I had to double the mayo/cream sauce and tripled the black pepper. It seemed too dry and needed other spices. Several people were surprised by the unique flavor, but I prefer the old fashioned type of potato salad.

We made this recently for a party and four people commented on it! Even my husband, who usually prefers pasta salad over potato, said it was better than his favorite pasta salad. Will be making this again!

Whenever I make this people rave and wonder what the special taste is. Don't be afraid of all three Tbsp. of horseradish. It's not too much at all. I also frequently add some fresh lemon juice.

I served this to a party of 8, they all raved about it. This is so easy and delicious.. I thought the amount of horseradish would be to much so I only use half of what it called for. Next time I'll use all 3 tlbls....

Just Okay. I used potatoes that didn't have alot of flavor, and that could have been it's downfall. If I were to make it again, I'd try Yukon Golds.

Super light dressing. Flavorful and delicious. I will definitely make it again. I mixed the dressing the day before and the flavors melded beautifully. Be sure to let it warm up a bit before you serve it so that the flavors ring true!

What a nice change from my regular potato salad! I didn't have any chives so used finely chopped Vidalia onion and a bit of paarslet for color. A Keeper!

I used non-fat sour cream and light mayonnaise, and this was still delicious. It needs time ( 1 hour?) in the refrigerator for flavors to meld so don't worry if it tastes a little funky right after combining - it'll definitely improve with age.
