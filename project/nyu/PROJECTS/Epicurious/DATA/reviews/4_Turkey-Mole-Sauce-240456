This is my go-to recipe for mole. You can adjust some of the peppers to suite your taste and heat tolerance; however, I've used this in a number of recipes.

This did not taste good. It tasted "raw". I think the chiles should have been sieved after the soaking. With all the skins, the mole could not puree and smooth out as well as it should of.
