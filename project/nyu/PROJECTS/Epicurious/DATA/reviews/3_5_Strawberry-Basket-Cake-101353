One of the best tasting cakes!

Rating: 4
After reading the suggestions, I replaced sour cream with buttermilk, did 1/3 cup fresh squeezed juice and one more egg. The cake was awesome. It was dense and moist. The perfect consistency to absorb the strawberry filling without being mush. It tasted like a divine version of strawberries and cream. I used the exact cornstarch directions from the previous reviewer a few pages back and the frosting was perfect. Held up for more than 24 hrs. I only spread it on, no basket weave.

This cake turned out really well. I made a 3 layer cake using 8 inch pans. Baking time was around 20 minutes. I was really worried about pouring all those strawberries and juice on the layers, thinking it would turn the cake into mush, so I went easy. I wish I hadn't, because the cake actually held up well. After a day, though, it did start to mush-up. I would recommend serving it the day it is made, and adding all those yummy strawberries!

Great recipe. Both the cake and the creme fraiche had wonderful flavor and weren't too sweet. I did not have access to my pastry tips so did not do the basket weave, but it was still pretty.

Excellent recipe and have made this over the years many times for birthdays as my sons always request it. Instead of adding all the extra fillers, try creaming the butter and sugar until very white and the cake will be lighter. If you overmix the frosting, the cream will begin to separate and will weep. Just whip the cream mixture until it stays in the bowl when turned upside down.

This recipe has become a classic in my house; so much so that it is requested for birthdays and holidays. The first time I made it, I added the extra egg to the cake, and instant vanilla pudding powder and unflavored gelatin to the creme fraiche. It came out perfectly; the basket weave was no problem. Second time around, I forgot the vanilla pudding and the basket weave did not work; I ended up spreading a very unstable creme on it instead. Process of elimination, the instant pudding was a must.

I've made this cake many times, for it has become a family favorite. It turns cranky old geezers into giddy, smiling sweethearts. I follow the cake part of the recipe to a "T". I've never had the patience to sculpt the creme fraiche, I just smooth it on like any other frosting. This makes the cake much easier to prepare, which is a good thing, for it's in constant demand. I've shared this recipe with several friends and we're in universal agreement - definitely 4 forks!!

In order for the frosting to hold it's shape you need to use Manufacturing Cream (40% butterfat), that or add a bunch of stabilizers (yuck!). If you live in the Western states you can buy it at either Smart & Final or Cash & Carry stores (www.smartandfinal.com). The website will tell you where there is a store in your area. You can't buy it at just a regular grocery store, unfortunately.

Delicious, not hard to make. I did not modify the recipe and it turned out great! Make sure your ingredients are at room temp and don't over-mix the dry and wet. It would be best to check the cake after about 20 minutes though - I took the cakes out after about 26 minutes and it would have been better to remove it a few minutes earlier as the edges were a bit darker than I prefer. Everyone loved the flavor - it's better than a plain yellow cake - and the whipped cream topping was delicious (reviewed that separately). The basket-weave was not hard. I have a fair amount of extra whipped cream which is lovely with fruit salad, or more strawberries, or chocolate cake, or... :)

I made this for Mother's Day, after reading every single review. I added an extra egg, as many suggested, and checked after 23 minutes in the oven (mine needed the full 28 minutes). I followed the advice of the cook from Elkridge MD on stabilizing the whipped cream (thank you). All in all, however, I was disappointed. The different elements tasted nice enough, but altogether, the density of the cake doesn't work with the light weight of the frosting. This cake needs a sturdier frosting, as at least one reviewer did mention. Mine looked lovely, even without the basketweave, but it did not produce an attractive slice. Difficult to cut and the slices were an unsightly mush. I won't make this again.

Rating: 4
This is the cake my friends ask me to make over and over again. I've never attempted to do the basket-weave design because I don't think I'm skilled enough to do it =P I always leave out the orange peel because I don't like the taste but the cake is still very good. I love making this cake when strawberries are in season =d

The rating here is for the way the finished product tasted, but the recipe sort of sets you up for failure. Do take the last reviewer's advice and use the two-stage method which you can find in Cook's Illustrated's Baking book or their best recipes books. I got a very moist, golden cake with a nice crumb that DID harden a bit on refridgeration but still had good flavor. The whipped cream icing was the problem -I wanted the berries-and-cream flavor and texture that buttercream couldn't deliver, but whipped cream without stabilizer would not hold the basket weave detail. Find a way to stabilize your cream (corn starch method described by a previous reviewer, gelatin, Dr. Oetker's Whip It, pudding, whatever) or make this in an ice-cold kitchen and/or get a professional friend to find you a quart of real 40% butterfat cream. Even rushing it in and out of the fridge and giving the cream time in the freezer every few minutes wasn't enough to keep the icing stiff. But it really does taste lovely - the orange cream and strawberries together were SO good.

This cake, as made according to the recipe, is a little ordinary (minus the basketweave fanfare) but still good. Made according to the "two-stage method" (see Cook's Illustrated's "Baking Illustrated" book for instructions), it has a better flavor and finer, lighter texture. I also recommend adding two teaspoons of pure orange extract along with the vanilla and orange peel. The trouble with using a whipped cream frosting is that the cake must be refrigerated. Butter cakes (as opposed to Chiffon cakes) get hard in the fridge. A better option is a Swiss, French or Italian buttercream - or a cream cheese based buttercream - which is very easy (is there anyone who doesn't like cream cheese frosting?). The basket design is quite a bit of piecework. Save yourself the time and trouble and just fill with seedless strawberry jam or strawberry butter (from American Spoon Foods) and frost in the normal fashion. Top with a mound of fresh strawberries in the center. It will still be beautiful and taste wonderful. A lovely cake for Easter and summer, when strawberries are at their peak. It can also be done with seedless raspberry jam and fresh raspberries. For the raspberry version, add a bit of Chambord Liqueur or Bonny Doon Framboise to the buttercream.

Wonderful. Add the extra egg. The cake layers are a little dense, but very moist and the frosting came together very well by beating the cream in an stainless steel bowl that was chilled in the freezer. Everyone was impressed and the cake went FAST.

This is a showpiece cake. This was an all day affair with the cakes, the frosting, and the piped outside. I used extra small strawberries from an Amish fruit market for the top because they were easier to move aside and didn't require any cutting on the plate. I did not add the grated orange, so I increased the orange juice to 1/3. The creme fraiche was a little tempermental and droppy, but with chilling it came together enough to hold the shape of the basket weave. It made so much I think that it over powered some aspects of the cake. I would go for a more substantial frosting the next time I make this, at least add some powdered sugar to stiffen it up. My guests still loved the cake, though. One remarked that he never believed I was the baker people said I was until I brought out this cake.

Okay, I hate to be the party basher here... but, I was really disappointed by this cake. After all the hype, I was really excited to make it. I followed the alterations suggested - extra O.J. and extra egg - which I think helped. Still, I thought the cake was too dense and didn't have enough flavor. I didn't think the frosting was that great either. It made way too much frosting for the cake and I thought was so-so on the flavor. I'll look for another cake recipe for my next cake endeavor.

Rating: 4
And I thought cake was all about chocolate... This is the new royalty in my recipe collection! I didn't pipe the frosting, as I didn't have the time or skill. It still presents beautifully. I added an extra egg & used previous instructions on how to stablize the frosting. Worked great! Thank you for a most amazing recipe!

This was an amazing cake - both in presentation and taste. Based on the advice from the reviewers I combined several changes to make the icing firmer and cake moist. 1) used 3 eggs and added more OJ to cake batter; 2)baked for 23 min; 3)used ultra-pasteurized whipping cream but added 1 tsp instant vanilla pudding powder per cup of cream; 4)added 1 packet of unflavored gelatin (evenly spread over 3TBS COLD water in small saucepan, let stand 1min to sotften, then boil over low-med heat stirring until dissolved, remove from heat and immediately start beating whipping cream for 2-3min, then add powdered sugar, followed by slow stream of dissolved gelatin); 5)used 1c of powdered sugar in Creme Fraiche recipe. After the modification, the frosting did not weep, cake remained moist till the next day when stored overnight even without any cover. And it is really delicious and light.

Great cake to make when strawberries are in season! When I made the cake, it was dense but still nice and moist. The orange flavor was not overpowering but just enough to make it intresting. The basketweave was easy to do, and the whipped topping held up surprisingly well. I had to use ultra pasteurized cream (it was all the grocery store had), but I stabilized it with cornstarch as a previous reviewer suggested. It worked fine as long as I kept it cool. I can't imagine what a mess it would have been if it weren't for the cornstarch! I used toothpicks to attach the outermost strawberries on the top, otherwise they slid down the side. Overall a great springtime recipe!

I made this cake (N.B., cake only) for my son's birthday. I was a little nervous about the non-alternation of ingredients thing, but it worked fine. I did add 1 more egg than the recipe called for. It made a nice, moist cake, with a delicious, delicate flavor. I made it with the chocolate frosting for the orange cake in the March 1999 Bon Appetit (OMG, that frosting kicks butt--wish this were a 3-layer cake so I could have used even more frosting on it!) because that was the birthday request, but would definitely make the cake again in its strawberry basket iteration.

Rating: 4
This was pretty easy to make if you frost it and don't make the basket. The cake came out dense and a tad like shortbread but still moist and good. The frosting was too liquidy even after 15 minutes of whipping. I would see about thickening it up somehow. Very tasty and loved by all.

Rating: 3
I had trouble with the frosting as well, but the orange flavour and texture of the cake and frosting together were very pleasant. I'd definitely like to take another shot at the frosting, after I get larger piping tips as the zest kept clogging up my basket weave one.

This cake was excellent and so easy. Unusual that you did not have to alternate liquid and dry ingredients - works for me. I didn't do the basketweave the first time, not enough time. I am going to try this when I make it for Easter. All in the presentation!

I've made this several times after getting the recipe from a friend who made it and have always gotten rave reviews. I'm making it this weekend for someone who won it at an auction at my son's school. I agree that the chocolate dipped strawberries on top add a nice touch. Last time I stabilized the whipped cream by adapting a recipe from "The Cake Bible" which says it will not water out for up to 24 hours if kept refrigerated. The icing still tasted great, was nice and thick and stayed that way through leftovers the next day. All you need is a little cornstarch with the listed ingredients. Refrigerate mixing bowl and beaters. In a small saucepan, place 6 Tbs. powdered sugar and 1 Tbs. cornstarch and gradually stir in 3/4 cup of the cream. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and simmer for just a few seconds (until the liquid is thickened). Scrape into a small bowl and cool to room temperature. Add the 3/4 tsp. vanilla. Beat the remaining 2 1/4 cups cream, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1 1/2 tsp. orange peel, and remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 Tbs. powdered sugar together in chilled bowl just until traces of beater marks begin to show distinctly. Add the cornstarch mixture in a steady stream, beating constantly. Beat just until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised. This is good for the purists who don't want to use pudding in the icing. :)

This cake was amazing. It looked wonderful and tasted even better. I used a few suggestions and added one extra egg and ended up with a very moist cake. I also put a bit of vanilla pudding mix in the frosting and had no problem with thickness. The basket weave is very easy and makes a great impression, but make sure to keep it cold at all times and work quickly. Onces I was done (I took my time) the frosting was starting to melt a bit, but I put it in the fridge and it was fine. Verry yummy, I will be making this again and again.

I made this cake again for a birthday at school and EVERYONE loved it! I still say instead of adding extra ingredients, invest in an oven thermometer to ensure you oven temp. is right and, even then, check for doneness often - starting 10 minutes before suggested baking time. Cakes are dry because they are OVERBAKED!

This cake was great! I added an extra egg as many of my cakes are too dry. The cake had a wonderful flavor and the icing was a great complement to the cake. The flavor and combination of orange and strawberry was very refreshing and the whipped icing was nice and light. The basket decoration was not that difficult to do. Make sure to serve the cake right out of the fridge so that the icing doesn't get too soft.

Rating: 3
While this was not "out of this world" extraordinary in taste, it's presentation was quite impressive. Could very have been the strawberries I used. Is it me, or do strawberries not taste as good as they used to? They certainly LOOK pretty. At any rate, I thought I would let you all in on my Mother's trick of firming-up whipped cream.(Definitely NOT for the purists out there). She would add about 1/2 teaspoon of INSTANT vanilla pudding mix per cup of cream after beating slightly. Voila! Thick and very stable. (Alter accordingly).

This cake had a nice "wedding-cake" flavor to it, but its distinction lies in the presentation. Take your time icing it and it's even more special. Too bad the dog ate ours off the countertop before we could have seconds!

I can't believe everyone didn't LOVE this cake! My advice to those people who felt it was "sloppy" or difficult to handle is to refrigerate it for a bit. The cake is delicious and moist. The orange flavor blends perfectly with the strawberries and whipped cream. Another tip...pipe a bit a whipped cream around the end of the cake BEFORE you add the strawberry mixture. You can then add all of that wonderful strawberry syrup without dripping! I've made this cake a half dozen times for different crowds any everyone raved. Highly recommend!

This cake was very good and looked nice but was very time consuming for a strawberry shortcake. I made the cakes the day before and then did the frosting a few hours before I was going to leave the house. The frosting did not really hold up too well and I put my beaters and bowl in the freezer for 24 hours before making this cake. Everyone really liked the cake and wanted some to take home. It is definitely a good cake but I definitely second the concerns about the runny frosting! Next time, I would make the berry tiramisu - it is a "sure thing". Happy Cooking!

While the flavor reminded me of fresh strawberries and cream, some of my guests didn't like the orange flavor in it. It was also extremely sloppy in appearance. I had a hard time keeping the filling where it was supposed to be and the frosting slipped and slid all over the place. Cutting it also resulted in a sloppy mess. All in all, while I liked it, I wouldn't bother going through all that trouble again.

Somebody brought this dessert to my house and I absolutely loved it. It tasted like strawberry shortcake in a cake. Light, moist, and fresh whipped cream. Since I subscribe to Bon Appetit, I decided to try it for company a few weeks ago. I was disappointed. I found it very dry. By reading the other comments, I'm assuming I cooked it too long. However, I was also confused with the strawberry and preserve layer....was I supposed to use the juice (or some of it) in the layering process? That may have cut down on some of the dryness, but would it make it soggy? Obviously, I did not use any of the juice. Any suggestions? I would love to make this work.

My frosting turned out fine, but I added more conf. sugar (I didn't think it was 'sugary' enough'). The cake portion was very light with a subtle hint of orange(just right), however my cake layers did not rise enough.

I made this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. Thanks for all readers' reviews which I read and took into account! I baked for 23 minutes which was perfect. I drizzled each layer with some of the strawberry liquid and some Grand Marnier (seemed perfect moisture). I did use pasteurized cream (not ultra) and it whipped up perfectly in @6 minutes on speed 6 of Mixmaster (chilled bowl and beaters). I felt the brand of sour cream was a factor and used Daisy brand (seems thicker and heavier than others which are runnier)and feel it helped. i used tip#2B for basketweave, #2A for cords and 6B for swirls on top - worked well and I used all the creme fraiche. It did start to melt slightly, but I put bags in fridge or freezer for a few minutes. My cake seemed flatter than the photo and I had only 3 rows of weaves(next time I may use 8# pans). I used an entire pound of strawberries on top (had a larger area than the photo) and for a dramatic effect, I dipped 5 strawberries in white chocolate and placed them strategically around the pile. It looked beautiful and I'm expected to make it again!!

I just made this cake for Mother's Day and it received rave reviews from my family. I took the liberty of changing a few things, however. I baked the cake as the recipe described and it turned out very well. Instead of the jam and creme fraiche filling I made Berenbaum's Strawberry Cloud Cream and sliced strawberries very thinly on top of each layer of the cream. I also used a vanilla/grand marnier buttercream to frost the cake because i thought it might be a bit more stable. To readers who have had some trouble keeping fillings in the cake, I can offer a suggestion for making your cake building more enjoyable: first of all use a springform pan that is the same size as the cake. Line it with plastic wrap first with enough overhang to cover it all up when you've finished. put in one layer of cake, then pipe a line of buttercream around the edge of it. Then pipe another on top of that. It forms an edge that will help you with your filling. The filling will stay inside the cake. Just don't put too thick of a line of buttercream. I also brushed a bit of simple syrup flavored w ith grand marnier on each layer before filling to keep it moist. After put the top layer on i just wrapped it all up and refrigerated it awhile before finishing the cake. Yummy cake! The basketweave is simpler than it sounds, just go for it and have fun!

The cake was a great success. The only problem was that 1.) it will never look like the picture; and 2.) the cake was rather flat in the pan - but did not matter when you put it together with the strawberries However, aesthetics asie - the cake was a huge hit. In fact, I have been told that this cake will be my food assignment every Easter. I have made the cake three times and have found that when I used the heavy duty Kitchen Aid mixer instead of the hand mixer - the frosting results are dramatically improved. I also put the bowl in the refrigerator.

Great cake. I didn't follow decorating directions, baked in a bundt pan, served with strawberries and whipped cream on the side. Very light texture and great flavor, not overly strong flavor. 8 adults and 2 kids (mostly the adults) finished off the entire cake.

This was good. It looked like it was put together by an 8yr old, but it's my own fault. I didn't have the right equipment to basket weave, and just couldn't make it look good. It was devasted by 8 adults, even after a rather huge meal. Nothing but praises. I think I'd avoid the ultra pasteurized cream as well. Good luck all.

I adore this cake, and I've made it three times---the last two by very enthusiastic request. I have never mastered the piping, so I dollop the cake with the creme fraiche and use a plastic tool with curves to rake the creme fraiche in an upward motion, which creates a lovely effect, although it left far too much creme. I would only make a half batch without piping. The last time, I ran out of pretty strawberries for the top, and instead used canned mandarin orange slices around them and it turned out beautifully. Making this cake in March is perfect in Florida, because both the oranges and strawberries are in season right now. I think I would use more orange flavor next time, perhaps a little orange extract or Cointreau with the vanilla, to make the cake more vibrant against the heavy cream and strawberries. Cointreau added to the strawberry mixture for the cake's center gives it a lovely bite.

WARNING..Ok, for those of you who can only get ultra-pasteurized cream, listen up. Your frosting is doomed. It will fall, your layers will slide, and your cake will be a mess. It will taste good, but it will be a MESS. If you suffer like I do and only have ultra-P cream available, here's what you do.....you either stablize it with unflavored gelatine, or with 1 1/2 cups of vegetable shortning. Trust me, you need the extra stability. I made the frosting the recipe calls for on Friday night. By Sat. morning, the frosting had become a pool of mush. If I had frosted the cake, it would have been a disaster. OH, and don't forget about the Grand Mariner. Don't use strawberry preserves...yuck. Use your imagination. MY cake ruled the world. Your cake, if you follow the recipe, is average at best. Feel free to write me for advice!!

This cake was absolutely marvelous!! I loved the light orange zest flavor, and my guests all thought the cake was to die for, and a good friend of mine loved it so much he ate two pieces. Most of the reviews on here said the frosting is too runny.. I didn't think it was at all.. I just had my metal bowl and beaters in the freezer for a half hour before I made it. I have a hand mixer, so I had to be patient, but if you put it on the highest speed, and emulate the motions of a kichen aid mixer, really big, fast circular motions, it whips up really stiff. The cake sliced beautifully as well. Since strawberries are out of season, I had to use frozen whole strawberries, but it was still delicious. I will definitely make this again in the spring when the strawberries are in season.

The flavor of orange with the strawberries was a new experience to me. I have made this cake three times and the fourth time was in the form of a sheet cake for a birthday party. That took some doing! The only trouble I have is getting the cake to rise a proper heigth. The very first time the cake layer came out flat. The second time I made sure not to beat it too much. Compared to the picture on the magazine cover, I was never able to get a tall layer, but it still turned out just as delicious. If anyone has any suggestions I would gladly like to hear from you! Otherwise, this is a fabulous cake and my friends were very impressed!

I have made this cake several times with varying success. It's good to hear others had problems with the cakes moisture content. The second time I made the cake I thought I might use it for stepping stones. However, I have altered the batter a bit to add some moisture. The next time I make it I will probably pull it out of the oven sooner. As others say, this is always a HIT. Instead of the basketweave, I do a fancy baseline decoration around the bottom layer, then half the strawberries and press them into the sides of the cake. I then do a fancy edge on the top of the cake and place whole berries stem down on top. Always a hit!

It is great to make a stunning cake that does not take 3 days of work. It was a thrill to try a basket weave for the first time and have it work. I found the whole strawberries on the top made it difficult to cut and serve, so the second time I made this I layered sliced strawberries in a circular pattern with a few whole ones in the center, and it was much easier to cut and still looked great.

I made this for my birthday. The cake is moist and the orange zest makes it taste special. However, the creme fraiche is imposible to pipe. I whipped it to the stiff peak (within ice water bath and all) but once I stuffed it into my pastry bag, it dripped right through the tip. I baked the cake only for 17 minutes (11 minutes less than the recommended time), turned out moist until the last bite. I'd frost the cake with regular meringue buttercream icing next time for prettier look.

This cake turned out beautifully. It was very moist and delicious. And, when it was combined with the frosting it was wonderful! However, I recommend that you do not plan to save this cake for a few days. It is by far best when served the day it is made. Otherwise it gets soggy and somewhat dried out, when stored in a cake dome in the refrigerator.

Made this cake for a birthday party at work. Receieved so many compliments it made my head swell :).

I made the cake for a dinner party and it was a hit. The presentation is outstanding. I spooned some of the strawberry liquid over the cake layers, which added some moisture.

Excellent! I made it at Easter. Everyone requested the leftovers to take home, and my father loved it so much he had a piece for breakfast the next morning. The creme freche is difficult to pipe, but it looks just as spectacular spread on the cake.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday party. The cake is pretty good, but I personally thought the cake itself was kind of dense and the creme fraiche was very soft and a difficult to pipe, so I did without the basket weave. But overall, people thought it was really good, and I got many compliments.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was delicious. Relatively easy to make, but the frosting was not as firm as I would have liked which made it a little bit difficult to do the basket weave, but it still came out beautifully!

The cake was very dense and dry, a little to sweet also. A moist and light cake would have complimented the strawberries and cream nicely, or even a classic pound cake if you favor a more dense cake. The whipped cream icing was not thick enough to use for basket weaving. My suggestion if making this cake: Drizzle each cake layer with strawberry sauce to add moistness, and top with whipped topping just before serving, forget the basket weave!

I made this cake for Easter dinner and it was a tremendous success. Try using three 8 inch layers. I didn't have time to do the basket weave and no one cared it was so beautiful already.

Regarding whipped cream, try to find pasturized not ultrapasturized cream. The ultrapasturization process cooks the cream to a high heat and destroys it's wonderful whipping qualities. Most ultrapasturized cream collapses after a few minutes. Keep your cream, beaters and bowl cold before whipping

My husband, a pie enthusiast, said this was the best cake he had ever eaten.I took that as a positive. I have trouble whipping cream with a hand blender. My frosting was not as "firm" as it should have been, I think. Aside from perhaps using my kitchen-aid, does anyone have tips on how to perfect "whipping" cream?

The recipe was well written and the instructions for icing easy to follow. Some hints based on my experience. I found that I needed to use less creme fraiche than recommended in each pastry bag to do a proper job. Also, it would be nice if the next time, the sizes of the tips could be added. You need a medium to large sized basket weave tip to make the weave look similar to the photographs.

Gorgeous cake, simple to make and tastes great. No overly pretentious ingredients or techniques here. A simple but favourful cake that allows you to enjoy the strawberries and whipped cream topping.

this was outstanding! I made it for Easter and it was a real hit: I'll be making it again for Mother's Day! just a couple of suggestions: chill the whipped cream icing before putting it in the pastry bags, use a well-chilled metal bowl to whip the cream. I also brushed the bottom layer of the cake with Bourbon (could use Grand Marnier or Brandy) before adding the strawberry filling- it kept the cake moister. And trust me, the basketweave design is easier than it looks, you just get the hang of it!
