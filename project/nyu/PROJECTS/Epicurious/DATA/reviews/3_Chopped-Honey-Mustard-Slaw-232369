This recipe was a huge disappointment and waste of time and ingredients. I had Tom Douglas's Greek slaw the Friday before I made this and it was fantastic, so when I came across this recipe I thought I'd give it a try. Slimy, weird mess. I would like to think this would be better if you didn't wilt the cabbage prior, but the dressing wasn't good either.

This was good and a nice change. Surprisingly the kids gobbled this up.

Just O.K. for me. My guests loved it. I thought mine turned out just a little too runny. Was not good at all the next day for leftovers.

I decided this was good for slaw. Good because it is a very nice version of slaw, however I am not a slaw fan. I simply made it to use a cabbage I happened to have.

I really liked this. I usually just use vinegar, mayo and sugar for my coleslaw. So this was a nice twist on my basic recipe

My husband, who is a slaw snob, pronounced this the best he'd ever had. I followed the recipe exactly (including the cabbage draining up front, although not overnight) except for adding about a tablespoon of lemon juice that I had left from another dish I'd made, which made it a great complement to the Yukon Gold Potato Salad with Truffle Oil elsewhere on this site!
