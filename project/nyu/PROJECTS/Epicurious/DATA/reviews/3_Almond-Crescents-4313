Love this recipe. I substituted one cup of "Bob's" almond flour for the cup of ground almonds. Turned out great! For a recent batch, made chocolate ganache and dipped half of the cookie in the ganache and then dipped again into a mixture of toasted coconut and toasted almonds. Awesome!

These were not even close to what I was looking for in a classic almond crescent. I agree with other reviewers that there must be better recipes than this one.

Thank you to the cook from Vancouver who commented - I have the Crescent Almond Cookies recipe you were referring to and was considering making them but couldn't find a review of them, but based on your comment, I will make them. THANKS!

These are no where near as good as the Crescent Almond Cookies from the December 1995 issue of Bon Appetit, yet I can't seem to locate this recipe on the web. Luckily, I saved this issue. I wonder why they don't make this one available? I have to keep typing it out and sending it to friends...everyone loves them!

I thought they were a little bland. Wouldn't make them again. There are better almond cookie recipes out there.

My family loves these simple snacks. They are sweet enough to satisfy even a picky 4-year-old.

Excellent. Children love to make & eat them!

I used lemon instead of almond flavoring in these (being a lemon fan) and my family raves. They're very quick, quite delicious and extremely easy to make. Wonderful for kids to work with.

One of the better crescent cookies recipes. Be careful as the dough does spread so do not make the crescents too big.
