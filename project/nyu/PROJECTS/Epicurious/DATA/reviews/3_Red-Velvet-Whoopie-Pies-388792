Eyyyy YUCK! I can't imagine anyone finding these to be good. The cakes weren't just bland (even with an extra pinch of salt and more cocoa), they had an off taste that was just awful. Heavy on the flour too. Maybe if you use all butter, dark brown sugar, omit the vinegar (probably the source of the icky taste) and increase the vanilla... better yet, just use a different recipe all together. Don't waste your time or money on this recipe.

I made two batches of these. Two tablespoons of cake batter makes 8 HUGE pies. For the second batch I used 1 tablespoon to measure the batter and got 10 pies. The cake itself doesn't have too much flavour...I think if I were to do them again I would add more cocoa, or almond extract or...something. The texture, however is amazing. The frosting is also delicious but these are very heavy treats.

Delicious! 2 Tbsp of batter does make large cakes and only produced 8 whoopie pies for me. The filling needs more confectioners sugar as well, and I chilled the completed whoopie pies in the fridge so that the filling would hold its shape. I will definitely make these again!

These were delicious! 2 tbsp cookie drops would have been ridiculously oversized cookies, and as I used only 1 tbsp cookie drops, the cookies were much bigger than the ones shown in the picture. Instead of having depth, my cookies looked as though they were rising and fell flat after being taken out of the oven. I prefer cake flour in my RVC recipes but still very much found these cookies to be delicious and popular.
