The Sauce Andalouse is absolutely wonderful! So much better than plain, old red, tomato, sugar-goo...er..."ketchup." Many of my friends will say "Mayonnaise on fries is gross," then go on to devour this sauce. Don't screw with it. It's absolutely perfect the way it is. Delicious! I've always done the "double fry" method for my pommes frites, so that was nothing new. The come out perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Toss with lots of salt, and dipped in the sauce....that's a slice of fried gold, it is.

Wow! I didn't think I'd ever be able to make fries like this at home! Will be making these frequently because we loved them and I over-planted potatoes this year.

As a true Belgian, I must say: this is the first time that I see a 'correct' recipe for fries. frie it 2 times! As you all know hopefully, French Fries are actually Belgian, so the comparison to French Fries is correct. In Belgium, we usually make them a bit smaller: 10 cm long, a half a cm broad and high. The sauce is also quite classic in Belgium. I eat this every week, and in every city in Belgium we have little shops on corners where you can buy these "frieten" (french fries) right away. It is actually also something many students live on...

I just made this for my family and my husband and I loved it. My kids loved the fries but wouldn't touch the sauce! Typical. I made buffalo burgers and added the sauce to mine; outstanding. I ended up adding Tobasco just to give it a little kick, about 1/2 tsp. Loved it.

The fries were great, but the sauce was divine. Can't wait to make it again. Double frying the potatoes is definitely the key to crisp fries.

I served these to a group of French and English people and they all loved them. The sauce was a big hit. Very tasty.

I should probably rate this four forks, but it is so NOT healthy.... That being said, the fries are great and the sauce is unbelievably good. I won't serve it often, but I will serve it again.

Let's face it fries are fries so nothing special there. But this sauce is just wonderful. I left it in the frig for about 6 hours before I used it. Both my wife and I just loved it. Add a few capers and substitute a good zesty marinara for the tomato paste and I bet this would be amazing with Calamari.

Excellent recipe, the only thing I did differently was use 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise instead of 1 cup. Almost as good as what you get in NYC!

Absolutely marvelous. I would not change a thing.

Talk about a "secret sauce"...this one takes the 'spud'! I didn't have any bell peppers handy so I opened a package of Knorr Spring Veg. Soup & Recipe Mix and added comparable amounts of only the dried vegies, no seasoning, breaking up larger mushroom pieces. I also used red onion. It was superb and beats ketchup or ranch as a dip HANDS DOWN any day! The fries turned golden quickly the second time they were fried. They were delicately crispy outside and perfectly moist and fluffy inside. Move over McDonalds!!!
