My grocery store didn't have parsnips so I used a combination of roasted broccoli and cauliflower. The mustard sauce was delicious and very simple to make. I'm going to try it on more vegetables.

I love all the flavors in this dish, but the overall product is much too greasy and a little too sweet for my taste. The mustard seeds are lots of fun, though. I'll definitely be tinkering with this recipe to make it fit our family's tastes.

Made it as listed except I roasted the parsnips rather than steaming them and used Cajun mustard rather than dijon. The mustard seed mixture was excellent! I Loved it. The sweetness of the parsnips with the spicy, buttery coating was fabulous.

This is a really lovely, simple-to-make side dish. It has become one of our "go-to" dishes, both for us and for company...Dee-lish!

This was an excellent side dish! I used some carrots in addition to the parsnips. Having never had popped mustard seeds before, I was a little bit apprehensive at the amount called for in the recipe so I went light on them but after tasting the finished product, I'll definitely use the whole 1/4 cup when I make this again. It was sweet and a little spicy from the dijon, but just enough of both for a great balance of flavor. This is also very pretty, so I'll be happy to make it again just for us or for company.

This is my favorite way to make parsnips and I've made it many times. However, I do have trouble getting the seeds to pop.

My husband and I loved this dish. We made it at Thanksgiving. It is such a unique way to prepare parnsips, but very good. I never thought I liked parsnips until I had this dish! I am definitely going to make it again this year.
