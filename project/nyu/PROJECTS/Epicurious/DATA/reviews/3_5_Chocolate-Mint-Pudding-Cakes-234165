Made these for Valentine's Day and they were a huge success. I put the batter in the ramekins 8 hours ahead, covered them with saran wrap, and put them in fridge. I baked them for exactly 11 minutes and they came out perfectly. I dusted them with powdered sugar and served with fresh berries.

Excellent! Makes a great impression at serving time! I used only 1 tsp of peppermint, and they were perfectly minty, otherwise it may be too minty for my taste.

Love this recipe. I like the 1 t. vanilla modification, plus I increae bake time to 15-16 minutes for 4 ramekins instead of 6. I used a heaping cup of excellent chocolate chips to get my 6 oz. of chocolate, and it was perfect.

I first made this for my wife's birthday a year ago. As I over-baked them (having never made a pudding cake before), they made a nice chocolate cake. Once I figured out how to actually leave some pudding inside them, they were extraordinary. Contrary to what others have written, we both love the mint in the recipe. I tend to add a little more than what is called for. Incidentally, make sure to pull them out of the oven before the tops have completely caked over. These are best when a ring of cake is showing around the edges.

This recipe was horrible. The picture was enticing, however, if you try to cut it down to 2 servings, be prepared to serve chocolate mush. I followed the simple-sounding recipe exactly, and was horrified at the results. Don't bank on this working for a dinner gathering or nice occasion with your sig. other, you will have to try and try it again beforehand to make your own adjustments for it to come out, I'm sure. Bottom line-don't waste your time, pick a different recipe.

I made these for Christmas Eve. Very easy to make. I whipped them up while others were cleaning up the dinner dishes. I served them with Edys Pink Peppermint Ice Cream to add a Christmas touch. You really need the ice cream because these are very rich. I used Green and Black Organic 72% baking chocolate which may have added to the richness. Delish!

Okay, since these are likely to be popped into the oven just as you are finishing dinner and you have had a glass or two or? of wine BE SURE TO SET A TIMER! I blew it but they still were yummy and light if not at all pudding-y. Used larger souffle cups since we were only 4. Dusted buttered cups w/cocoa and the cakes fell right out on the plate nice n/easy. Also used Grand Marnier instead of peppermint. Great prep- ahead,versatile and forgiving recipe.

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe! The flavor is great, the texture is amazing, and the cakes are delicious warm or at room temperature. I have made the recipe twice, once with 1/4 tsp peppermint extract and once with 1 tsp vanilla. I prefer the vanilla version, as it does not mask the nice chocolate flavor. As for the chocolate, I try to use a 60% cocoa chocolate, such as Valrhona's 64% bars or Ghirardelli's 60% bittersweet chocolate. I think both work just perfect.

I love this recipe. I'm right now making it a second time. However, both times I've left out the mint since it can be strong and overwhelming and I prefer to enjoy the chocolate alone. I use premium Swiss chocolate (85% cocao), which makes a big difference to the taste. I also use 4 ramekins instead of 6 so each person gets more to enjoy!

Very easy and tasty.

While I made the recipe without peppermint extract, I still thought it was delicious. To be sure, there are many recipes available for this kind of molten chocolate cake, but this has been my favorite so far. Not having small ramekins to use, I was able to fill 9 medium muffins. They turned out onto a baking sheet fine, though they were small, but I suppose that's just portion control. Mine cooked for 6 minutes.

I THINK TIS CAKE IS DELICOUS, HOWEVER I WOULD MAKE IT SIMPLIER BY PUTTING IT IN A GREASED, FLOURED BUNDT PAN, AND SLICE LATER WITH ICE CREAM.

I'm very sorry, but I was reviewing the wrong recipe! If you interested the triple-chocolate cookies are four fork incredible. :) Sorry for the mix up.

If you're needing a fix of chocolate, and have milk near by this is the recipe for you! I too was a little nervous about the consistancy of the batter, but the results speak for itself. I only had 10oz of chocolate so I cut the recipe in half and put in 2 eggs--they turned out perfect.

I thought the flavor was delicious but I would recommend doubling the recipe for larger portions. I had a hard time getting the cakes out of the dishes.

I would make this again, but not as written. I found the peppermint taste overwhelming and in conflict with the chocolate. Coffee would work much better. Further, it is even more ovewhelming with the ice cream, and the chocolate and ice cream run together. Whipped cream would be more suitable and a nice contrast. If you use 3/4 cup molds, these will be very shallow. I could only get 5 desserts out of this quantity. On the plus side, the texture and method are very good, if not overbaked.
