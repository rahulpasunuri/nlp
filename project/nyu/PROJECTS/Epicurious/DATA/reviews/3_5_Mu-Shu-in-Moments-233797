Agree with all the reviewers and thanks for the suggestions. Made this with cabbage shredded in the Cuisinart, grilled chicken breast strips from Costco. Used slide shiitake's rehydrated and the mushroom water instead of plain water. Used egg pancake suggestion. Great and pretty quick. Hubby is still eating his 4th portion!

Super-easy and economical (especially if Asian ingredients are a regular part of your pantry). Have made this with both rotisserie chicken and Chinese roast pork--better with the pork. It looks best if you make the eggs into an omelet, and slice it into strips. I can buy mu shu wrappers in the freezer at the Asian market...authentic wrappers make this more restaurant-quality, but it's still delish with tortillas (or even lettuce wraps). Yummy!

Thia is a wonderful week night dish that yields ample leftovers. Easy to adjust to taste, a good template to start from. I add a little fish sauce and cilantro and double the ginger.: )

So quick and easy and very satisfying. I had some left over pork that I used instead of chicken. You could play a lot with what to put in this recipe.

Rating: 3
Really great. I got some dried tree mushrooms and added about 5 or 6 of those, which really helped out the flavor. I also have the advantage of asian markets closeby, so I went with the real mu shu pancakes. To keep it cheap, I left out the chicken and it was still really really tasty. Next time I may play around with some more sauces or even pork rib meat. mm!

It was very easy to adapt this recipe to veggie-chicken if you're vegetarian since the recipe calls for pre-cooked chicken anyway. I used a bag of the morningstar farms strips. This was delicious and came together very quickly. I had a little less cabbage on hand, so I made up the difference with shredded carrot.

Delicious! I added some shitaki with the garlic and ginger and some snow pea and bamboo shoots with the cabbage and it was so delish!! So easy!!

Awesome and easy! We loved it. I would add some snow peas for crunch next time. The cole slaw mix does not need 5 min. covered. More like 3 min. uncovered.

I found this one-dimensional and overly sweet...not sure I'll be making it again.

This was a great recipe to work with. I added shredded carrots,julienned red pepper, and sliced mushrooms. Wish I'd had the bean sprouts, too! My husband added some plum sauce to his tortillas and called the meal a great success! I gave it 3 forks for too much soy sauce - a pet peeve of mine. I used half the amount or less. Great recipe though, which we will be making again and again!

very good recipe. Had a lot of flavor! We used broccoli slaw instead of the cole slaw mix b/c we already had that on hand. would definitely make this again!

Very good. I made with a 3/4 pound pork tenderloin, thinly sliced and sauted before the rest of the ingredients, added some sliced mushrooms.

This recipe is spot-on! I really like the fact that I can control the quality of the ingredients and adjust the flavors - unlike my local 'take-out' variety which is sketchy at best. The coleslaw mix is a great shortcut, so I used the saved time to make the Mandarin pancakes myself. They are so easy and instructions can be found online. I also added soaked, slivered wood ear mushrooms (aka: black fungus) and bean sprouts to get closer to the style I prefer. I'll make this again, for sure.

I made this for a Asian themed potluck. I added mushrooms with the garlic mixture, then added bean sprouts and shredded carrots with the cabbage and just put the chicken right in there at the end. I also used less oil than the recipe suggested. This was the hit of the evening! People said it was the best mu shu they had ever had! Definitely a keeper. I would consider reducing the water in the future as it is pretty liquidy at the bottom, but it was a great dish as is!

Rating: 4
We tripled this recipe and cut each wrap into thirds. An excellent appetizer. We had lots of chicken and cabbage left over. Delicious.

Rating: 4
Excellent and better than takeout because I control the oil and quality of meat. I added sliced shitake mushrooms before the cabbage and added bean sprouts with the cabbage (you can cut back on water then) I had leftover pork tenderloin that I'd roasted with Korean BBQ sauce and used that sliced thin. Delicious! I also used raw tortillas that you cook first which I think was important. You can get these in SoCal at the local Vons. We loved it and it's quick and easy.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe delivered exactly what it promised- better than takeout Mu Shu in record time. It was fast, easy and delicious! I sauteed thinly sliced button mushrooms with the ginger and garlic, and also added bean sprouts as recommended- I wouldn't skip the few extra minutes to bulk up the veggies, they really make the dish. Great for week nights, enjoy!

This was quick, easy, and delicious! I followed the recipe, as written, but will try it with whatever vegetables I have on hand to vary it a bit. I'd also like to use shrimp or pork, as others have suggested. A keeper!

Delicious! I subbed bbq pork for the chicken and added celery and mushrooms. I'll use the sauce again for other recipes.

My family and I liked this recipe, but something seemed to be missing, and it was not as good as take-out. I added bean sprouts to ours, which I would HIGHLY recommend. The hoisin sauce is essential; my brother and I could have drank the stuff from the bottle. Overall, it's a good way to use up leftover chicken. Next time, however, I think I might sautee some pork tenderloin since it really wouldn't take that much longer to cut it up. Worth a try.

I wanted to love this recipe, but just didn't. I find the tortillas too heavy for the fairly delicate filling. The flavors were pretty good though. Next time I will do this on a weekend when I can either try making real mu shu pancakes, or get to an asian market to see if I can buy some pre-made.

This is one of my favorite quick and easy recipes. Though, now that I have made it a few times, I do have some variations. I use a bag of broccoli coleslaw and chop up cabbage myself...just to add some vegetable variety. I also skip the chicken and add small pieces of fried tofu to the coleslaw mix, which absorbs the sauce flavor nicely. However, the original way of making this is great too!

I made this recipe, decreasing some of the cooking oil to cut down on the fat. But even so it was completely delicious. I followed the recipe closely and served it as lettuce wraps with rice. btw, it was even better the next day!

Yum! This was easy and delicious. We followed the recipe, however added more garlic and roasted some chicken thighs which were marinated in hoisin sauce, soy sauce, olive oil, ginger, garlic salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again.

Instead of using the tortillas, I used Mu Shu filling and made Lettuce Wraps. I HUGE hit with my kids. I cut down on the cole slaw mix shredded some carrots and added ground peanuts. Then used the mixture with Lettuce, to create a Wrap. Served with Brown Rice! It was fantastic.

This recipe was pretty good. I used vegetable oil but I think it would have tasted better with peanut oil. Overall, it was very easy to make.

This recipe was good. Nothing more, nothing less. Didn't compare to what can be picked up at a restaurant. I'll make the sauce again because I think it will work well in a stir fry. Will not make the mushu again though. Glad I tried it.

Very quick and quite delicious - a good substitute for takeout. Only modifications made were to add some honey to the sauce, my boyfriend doesn't care for how much of a 'bite' hoisin has, so I toned it down a bit.

I would actually go 3.5 forks on this one. Very tasty, and almost as easy as a grilled cheese sandwich. This one really does taste as good as some Mu shu from a resturant; I was curious if tortillas would work as well as what they use in chinese resturants, but they really do work well.

I have used this as inspiration for my own mu shu several times and we love it. I use half cabbage slaw and half broccoli slaw, add baby bella mushrooms, and I find it just as easy to stir fry fresh chicken or pork tender cut into bite size chunks. I've also made it with tofu for a vegetarian dish. I use lots of ginger and extra hoisin. If I have time, I've picked up the pancakes from my local chinese take out--much better than tortillas. A fast, healthy and delicious week-night "one's a meal."

This was fabulous! I cooked my own chicken (just poached two breasts with some onions, carrots, & celery) and it was still a quick and satisfying dish. I'm sitting at work now eating the cold leftovers and it's even better! One problem I had--I didn't separate the tortillas from the paper towels right away, so they became stuck to the paper. I was too lazy to microwave more... the regular tortillas are nowhere near as good, but definitely still edible. I'm going to try and find rice pancakes next time. This one's definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
This is delicious. My husband is a big mu shu fan and he loved it. I enjoyed the fact that I know that, in making it at home, the ingredients are fresh and healthy. I roasted my own chicken breasts rather than purchasing the rotisserie chicken--just seemed simpler. With either preparation of chicken, I recommend shredding it earlier in the day. The prep time is active, and removing the chicken from the bone slowed me down. It would be a very easy, fast dish when this step is done ahead.

Fabulous! I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing. It was easy and delicious and we will definitely make it again.

I added extra garlic, ginger and red pepper. Next time I would not add the water since the cole slaw mix created so much moisture; the sauce was a bit thin for my taste. Very good, quick, simple.

Very bland and not at all like good Moo Shu Chicken. Tasteless!!! Would not make again. Very unlike the many good recipes I have found on this site.

Rating: 3
I agree with those who say this would be better with thinner rice tortillas (they must be available somewhere around here; now I'll be looking for them). It's a recipe that can easily accommodate additions and substitutions. We were tired of chicken, so I roasted a small pork tenderloin and shredded half of it -- a 1/2 lb. of pork in this recipe fed 3 people easily. Bagged coleslaw mix works great here; I always have too much left over when I use a whole head of cabbage.

Rating: 3
good and easy weeknight dish; I added a package of sliced mushrooms to the saute to make a vegetarian filling instead of a chicken one. My husband added chopped peanuts to his and loved that.

Rating: 3
Very good, with only one adjustment that only improves things... I added sliced crimini mushrooms and chopped cilantro to the slaw mix before sauteeing (the "MOO" in moo shu refers to woods ear mushrooms, so omitting mushrooms just ain't right). I ended up adding no meat, as it stands alone nicely without. I really prefer the rice pancakes, so use them if you can get them -- tortillas are way too doughey for such a delicate mixture. Don't skimp on the hoisin, it's what moo shu is all about! Enjoy!

This was quick and easy to make. I added the chicken to the veggies so everything was evenly coated with the sauce. Next time I will add more ginger and garlic, and maybe some asian chili-garlic sauce for heat.

I was also impressed by the ease of preparation of this dish. I didn't mind the flour tortillas but of course a thinner pancake is preferable. Pretty close to Chinese mu shu. I will certainly make this again as they were yummy.

I made this on a whim for my kids. They wanted "Chinese" food. They loved it. I love being able to use a purchased rotisserie chicken and packaged cabbage to cut down on prep time. We will be having it again.

These are so good and so easy, as all have said. I made my first one with the chicken but I found the meat to be a little...distracting. The second one I did with just the veggie-egg mixture and liked it much better. DH didn't even try it with the chicken, he liked the veggies so well.

This is a great mu-shu recipe with outstanding flavors. After following the recipe exactly, I now double the garlic and go heavy on the ginger ...even though I think grating fresh ginger is a pain in the butt. I serve it over rice and don't even bother with the tortillas. We're eating it tonight as a side dish to steaks and I can't wait!

this was easy and great and ready in 30 minutes. I put the chicken in the pan with the cabbage mixture and heated it through, serving it all together. Kids loved it, too.

I love Mu Shu Shrimp so I added 1 doz frozen, pre-cooked, deveined large shrimp (thawed and cut into pieces) at the very last minute. The Lancaster County natives would flip if they knew what I was doing with their slaw mix! Great taste - I happen to enjoy hoisin.

Okay, I altered the recipe, and really loved it! I used a bag of "broccoli slaw" instead of coleslaw. I added the shredded chicken in with the veggies. The filling was a little watery, but it was easy to drain. We also used more scallion, sliced in matchsticks, to the assembly. My family usually does not like mu shu, because they don't like cabbage, but this was a big hit.

My husband and I both loved this dish. Since he is a vegetarian, I used diced tofu in place of the chicken, which I marinated in the sesame oil/soy sauce/hoisin sauce mixture (I used chili sesame oil) and stir-fried with the garlic and ginger. Next time, I will add more red pepper flakes for more of a kick.

I'm siding (in the minority) with the cook from Redmond, WA--I did not care for this recipe, despite following the directions to a "t". It was too heavy on the hoisin and was nothing like the Mu Shu I regularly order in restaurants. I wouldn't dream of adding more hoisin to the tortilla after tasting how it dominated the chicken & vegetables.

This was quick and delicious. I made no changes other than adding the chicken to the hoisin sauce mixture which made it moist. Good recipe for kids too.

This was a tasty recipe. While I was happy to add additional hoisin to the tortilla I can see where people who don't like that flavor would not care for this as much. Rather than chicken, I used roast pork which I cut into match stick pieces and added to the cole slaw mixture to reheat. Initially I was apprehensive about the tortilla as a wrap, however, with the moisture from the filling it proved to be a good choice. Will definitely do again!

We loved this recipe as a quick family meal - fast, tasty, and featuring easy to access ingredients. Probably the biggest problem with the recipe is its title. These are wraps inspired by mu shu, but aren't authentic mu shu. Like some other reviewers, I think it would be good to find a thinner alternative to tortillas for wrapping. I may even try this as as a lettuce wrap - might make a good appetizer.

Great! I made the recipe as written, but I might tinker with it a bit next time (adding a bit of asian chili paste, oyster sauce and some cilantro). I used thin flour tortillas but would be open to a substitution. Will definitely make these again.

I've had wonderful success with epicurious recipes (and reviews). I guess I'm in the minority here, because this just didn't cut it for me or for my family. I felt the filling was very lack-luster, soggy and heavy on the hoisin. I think using fresh Asian style veggies may have made a difference, rather than mediocre packaged cole slaw mix. We eat a lot of mu shu and this did not resemble what I am used to at all.

I will definitely be keeping this one! It was so easy and so delicious. With high cholesterol, I used Egg Beaters instead and it was perfectly fine. I also might try using won ton/egg roll wrappers instead of flour tortillas which I found to be a bit dough-y. But it really was easy and yummy!

Had this dish at a friend's house today. I found it as good as some of the tastiest mu shu I've had at Chinese restaurants but with lower fat and calories, I'm sure.
