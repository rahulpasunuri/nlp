Made this for Thanksgiving this year. We used Udi's whole grain gluten-free bread (one whole package, cut up and toasted under broiler for a few minutes). It was very tasty. Key to this dish is to have flavorful sausage. This was a big hit at both Thanksgiving meals we went to over the weekend.

Outcome was great. I used LaBrea Bakery's Olive Oil Rosemary and baked this stuffing beneath brined turkey pieces (breasts, legs, thighs). Near the finish, I removed the turkey pieces to allow top to crisp. Reduced the liquid somewhat to allow for flavor/moisture contribution from the turkey. Froze in small portions and enjoyed thawed left-overs a week later. This turned out to be a great 1-pot dish suitable for company. A combination of sweet & spicy sausage will be used next time I make this dish.

This was all right but not anything amazing, not anything that I'm going to be sure to make next Thanksgiving. The ratios given seem a bit off. I'm always one to up the veggies and greens in any recipe (or add them even when they're not called for) but the amount of spinach in this (2 pounds of frozen) seemed a bit excessive; I didn't put it all in, and it was still very spinachy. I think you would need to have more sausage to compensate flavor-wise. Plus the fennel, both the fresh fennel and the fennel seed, also really got a bit lost. Maybe with some ratio adjustments this could be improved, but when there are so many delicious stuffings out there, you might as well make one that's doesn't require as much tinkering.

Although it felt like a lot of work with everything else I needed to do for Thanksgiving, it was worth it. I left out the fennel seeds because I'm not a fan. I also used sweet sausage because my parents don't like spicy food. Other than that, I followed the recipe. In the future, I would probably add a little extra sausage. I felt it got lost in the mix. Maybe if I had used the hot, it would have stood out a little more.

Just took this dish from the oven and had my husband taste--he loves it. I made some adjustments: used fresh baby spinach--lightly sauteed in a bit of oil, butter and white wine. Also added dried sage. It did not need as much broth as recipe requires. I added it at the end and stopped when I felt it was moist enough. If you like savory, this is a great dish.

Pretty good and fairly easy to make. I went light on the bread and heavy on the veggies so this could be more of a main dish. If your spinach is already thawed, I'd say you could prep this dish in 30 mins.
