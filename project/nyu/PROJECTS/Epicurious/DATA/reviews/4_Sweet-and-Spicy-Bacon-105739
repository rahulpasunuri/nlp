This was amazing, and so easy. We had it at Christmas morning brunch. My son said it was the best bacon he ever had.

Great idea. To make this slightly move savory, I often add a fresh herb - people can never believe the flavors. Rosemary has been my favorite so far, but there are plenty of options. If you ever do a cheese course, add some oddly cut pieces of this bacon and drizzle reduced balsamic: beautiful presentation and great taste.

A definite crowd pleaser and so different! I have made this time and time again due to multiple request. It is so easy. All you have to do is sprinkle the seasonings on there and bake!

I've made this recipe twice now and everyone raves about it. I'm too impatient to wait for the bacon to cook at 350, so I put it under a high broiler instead and cut the cooking time in half. Comes out great!

I have made this once for a knitting brunch and got rave reviews and demands that I make it for the next meet-up. It's become a brunch tradition: it's been dubbed "crack bacon." Absolutely tasty and addictive. I agree with the other reviewer that said she's unsure if washing the bacon prevents curling. Perhaps I will try the cold oven method, at least for the first batch.

Great and easy recipe. Last time we made it, we were out of brown sugar. My husand warmed up some honey in the microwave and basted it on the bacon. The pepper really stuck to the honey and the taste was amazing. Everyone liked the honey bacon better than the brown sugar version.

Perfect taste balance. Delightful!

I have made this several times as directed and have received rave reviews. Another way to use this is leave out the sugar and serve with a sweet breakfast. I always make this to serve with baked french toast with a mixed berry sauce. Perfect combo of sweet and spicy.

This was really delicious and very easy. A great accompaniment for eggs. If you're like me and you always pour maple syrup on your bacon, you'll love this dish.

Delicious and so easy! Don't know if rinsing under water really helped. One time I did, and one time I didn't - same result. Made with Three Cheese Baked Eggs, Petit Pains Au Chocolate, and Cranberry Coffeecake.

I followed the 10/05 review and wrapped it around breadsticks for a brunch. The parents were stealing it off their own children's plates.

I don't remember where I originally read this tip re: keeping bacon from curling but I start the bacon in a cold oven, don't preheat. It takes a little little longer but the bacon comes out with a minimum of curling.

I made this for brunch today along with Boursin Fritatta. I followed others suggestion about running bacon under cold water first, it really worked. This was not as spicy as I would have liked, will add more pepper next time. I used a foil lined cookie sheet with a wire rack and clean up was a breeze.

I have never made this recipe as just bacon, but as a caterer and hostess, I wrap bacon around long, thin, crisp breadsticks (leave an inch or two for handle) and roll in sugar mixture; broil, flipping once, and serve as appetizers. After cooking they need to sit a few minutes for breadsticks to re-crisp, but guests usually won't wait that long.

Per others advice, ran bacon under cold water before baking. Bacon didn't curl at all. Put sugar mix into strainer and sifted onto bacon - went on very evenly. As with others, I may never make bacon any other way. Delicious!

Nice twist to plain old bacon. I actually modified this recipe quite a bit. I added 3 tbsp of water and 2 of extra virgil olive oil and made a paste to spread over the bacon using a brush. It made a nicely sweetened glaze for the bacon and the pepper added another dimension of flavor.

EXCELLENT recipe. Easy to do, broiler drains fat off bacon which is nice. Prepared as written. Make sure you use thick bacon, and make more than you need! Taste is a great spicy, sweet mixture.

My husband and I boh loved this simple twist on basic bacon. One word of advice - if you use raised cooling racks on a cookie sheet (which works really well), keep an eye on the pieces on the end. I had a piece go overboard and drip onto my oven floor.

Fantastic. I put the bacon on a metal cooling rack and put a cookie sheet underneath to catch the drippings, and it worked really well. Next time, I'll probably remember to line the cookie sheet with foil (no clean-up... gotta love that). This recipe was ridiculously easy and very tasty.

This was a really good, non-messy way to make bacon. It is so easy and different, my friends ate a pound of it in about 5 minutes. I just lined 2 cookie sheets with tin foil and arranged the bacon and when it was done, just scooped up the foil and threw out all the grease and melted sugar, there was virutally no cleanup at all. The sweetness goes so well with the salitness of the bacon. I had no problem with the bacon curling more than bacon usually does when you cook it.

Made this for a Girls' Day Brunch over the weekend and it was a nice addition to the menu. I took another reviewer's advice and ran the bacon under cold water before rubbing on the mix. It worked - no curling at all. For extra kick, I would even add a little garlic powder to the mix next time.

I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast and he loved it!! Not only was it delicious, it was very low-maintenance - the perfect side dish when my mind was occupied by the eggs benedict. Just had to pop it in the oven, turn the bacon once, and 40 minutes later it was ready to roll!! This is definitely how I will make bacon from now on!

For a long time, I have wanted to try this recipe, but was concerned about the mess of bacon broiling in my oven. Finally, I decided to experiment with a less messy approach. I bought the pre-cooked bacon, then put it (thawed) in a ziplock bag with all the other ingredients, shook it up to cover all the bacon, then refrigerated overnight. In the morning, I laid the bacon on a piece of parchment paper (a paper towel would have also worked), then microwaved the recipe for one minute. Since I never tried the original broiling method, I don't how my approach compares, but I do know that the bacon I made was quite delicious. And there was absolutely nothing to clean up. I will make this again and again.

Fortunately, I tried this recipe before preparing for a crowd. The first time I made it, it turned out a disaster as I merely sprinkled the mixture over the bacon which baked into an unsightly glob on each piece. All of the favorable reviews convinced me to try again and I'm SO glad I did as it was wonderful the second, third, fourth time around. For the great repeated results, I rubbed each side of the bacon as I would a dry rub on meat before barbecue. This created a wonderfully even, brown crunchy texture. I also baked the slices on a pan that allowed the fat to drain below away from the bacon. Unbelievably good!

This is really great. If you rinse off each bacon slice under cold running water it cuts down on shrinkage a lot.

A must for brunch parties. I don't think bacon could possibly taste better or be prepared more easily. I also lined the pan with foil for easy cleanup.

this is sooo good. i use a disposable foil cookie sheet, so there is no mess to clean up. i use just regular bacon, any type will do. i also cut my bacon in half first which helps to keep it from curling as much. we love this on blt's for something out of the ordinary.

Delicious! It has a nice sweetness and spiciness to it. I didn't have to cook it for 20 minutes on one side and 15 minutes the other. Instead, it was done both sides in 20-25 minutes. Any longer, it wouldn't have turned out so great.

When I saw this recipe, it reminded me of a recipe I need to start making again. Its almost identical to one of my favorite recipes from the cookbook, Beyond Parsley. Since I've made it so many times, I thought I would add a few comments. First, my recipe does not call for pepper, but I think that might be good. Mine just throughly coats brown sugar (and cinnamon if you want) on both sides of (room temp) bacon. Then, to elimate the turning of the bacon as noted in this recipe, you simply twist the bacon and bake it. Cool on foil and the sugar caramelizes hard. Serve room temperature.

We bought the magazine just to make the breakfast with the three cheese eggs. This bacon was marvelous! Our children loved it especially. They have a thing for spicy food!
