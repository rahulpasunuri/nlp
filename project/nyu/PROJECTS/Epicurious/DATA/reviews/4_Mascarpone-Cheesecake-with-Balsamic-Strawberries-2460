This was a terrific recipe! Deliciously and visually exciting. I will be making this again. The almond biscotti was good but next time I'm going to go with the chocolate biscotti to see how that goes. Everyone loved it.

so easy to make, and the results were delicious! i followed the recipe almost exactly--1/2 c sugar in the berries seemed like it was a bit too much. i only used about 1/3 c. and i thought it was perfect. someone mentioned in one review that they didn't use top-quality balsamic and their berries were too sour. i made sure to use the best-quality stuff i had (the best stuff from trader joe's). i used the almond mini-biscotti from trader joe's too--they were perfect. for ease of serving i made cheesecake 'cupcakes'. i lined cupcake tins with paper liners, then pressed about 1/2 tablespoon of the crust mixture in the bottom, and filled to the top with the cheesecake filling. i set the muffin tins in a full sheet pan and filled it with water. baked for 30 min--they were light golden on top and the texture was perfect.

What a great recipe even after a few changes. Too lighten it up I used (2) 1/3 fat cream cheese, 1 mascarpone cheese and (8oz) of part skim ricotta cheese. It was awesome!! I also added the vanilla extract which others had suggested.

Four forks up! This cheesecake was a big hit at a dinner party and I would definitely serve it again. I read all the reviews first and appreciate your many tips. In spite of them, however, my foil leaked during baking and my crust was wet. So I encourage you to tightly seal the pan bottom twice with HEAVY duty foil, not the regular stuff I used. Regardless, the cake itself was wonderful, and the strawberries in Basalmic vinegar were an amazing treat. My changes/additions: I subbed 8 oz. ricotta for 8 oz. of the cream cheese, just to make this more "Italian." I added 1 and 3/4 cup sugar to the cake itself because I misread the recipe, and it turned out better I think. I added one egg white to lighten the batter but I do not think I would do that again. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla, which I think helped. I used the Nonni biscotti (almond with a hint of anise) and did not like the anise flavor, so will not use Nonni the next time. This was an easy, fun recipe and certainly has made my list of top cheesecake recipes.

This is one of the best cheesecake recipes I've made, and I've made quite a few. I love the simplicity of it, yet the flavor is so rich. Trader Joes carries almond biscotti that are perfect for the crust. The strawberries are a must! Also, I like to let the top brown till its a uniform gold, give it a nice crust. Its ok if the cake is jiggly when you pull it out, it will continue to cook. Delicious! About to have another piece:)

I made a few mistakes and I would make a few changes, but the cake was great. I made it for my husband's birthday and it got rave reviews, especially from the guest of honor! Some questions and changes: First, I cooked it for the full length called for in the recipe, and the top got golden brown but the cake remained very jiggly. I decided to take it out because I didn't want to burn the top but I wish I could have cooked it longer. Second, I would butter the pan because the crust stuck to the bottom of my springform pan and I couldn't get it off. I was disappointed because I think the crust would have been great! Third, adding a bit of sugar to the strawberry mixture helps break it down. Finally, I think vanilla would be a wonderful addition.

I loved this cheesecake. I enjoyed the strawberries, and thought they were the perfect compliment to the cake, but didn't think they were as amazing as other reviewers. I used my standard balsamic, and perhaps a higher quality would have been the tipping point. For the cake though, I subsituted 15 oz ricotta and 24 oz cream cheese, and it was exceptional. I don't know how it would have compared with the mascarpone, but it was the perfect consistency - rich but light and smooth. The biscotti crust was fabulous and infused the entire cake with almond essence. Definitely make again!

Didn't have time to make the cheesecake, so I just made the strawberries and served with store-bought cheesecake and they were delicious. I was surprised by how much liquid was in the bowl (I even had 3+ cups of strawberries). Any suggestions on how to thicken up the liquid to give it a more syrup-y consistency?

Rating: 4
Fabulous. But I would slice the strawberries next time (rather than quartering) to allow the balsamic vinegar to soak in a bit more

Unbelievable. This cake is absolutely perfect. Followed the recipe exactly and couldn't have been happier. Brought to a potluck and it was the first dessert gone. Plenty of people licking the syrup off the plate.

everyone loved it, definitely needs to be made with the almond biscotti and the balsamic strawberries added a lot. I chose to add more strawberries so that the balsamic/sugar mix wasn't so watery.

This one has to get 4 forks because it disappeared so fast I only got to taste the crumbs and a few strawberries! One of the guests at the party requested 5 for her 50th birthday party!I was concerned while making it because there was no vanilla, lemon etc. but the flavor of the almond biscotti (Trader Joe's) came through with just the right balance. After baking the aroma coming out of the oven was great. I did make a slight adjustment and used the entire 12 oz container of mascarpone and adjusted the cream cheese to 1 3/4 lb. I had to interrupt the process after making the crust and filling seperately because I didn't have time to bake it immediately so had to increase the bake time slightly due to chilled filling, but the recipe tolarated it perfectly-just baked until the top was golden brown.

This is easy and tastes really good. Quick tip, take about a cup of strawberries and puree them. Add the puree while you beat up the cream cheese and eggs. Cheesecake came out just perfect and with a hint of strawberry flavor. Would do it again...!! Was a surprise Birthday gift and everyone loved it.

This is my first cheesecake and I have to say that it was really good. I brought it into work for everyone to sample and not one person had a bad thing to say about it. I'm going to make it again this weekend. I will alter the crust a little because I had the same problem with my crust being to soft.

This was awesome. I am not a cheesecake fan, but this is great. Everyone who tried it loved it! The strawberries were fantastic. I did cut the sugar in half and they were still quite sweet. I also used double the mascarpone since I had it and cut down on cream cheese. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese to balance out the heavy mascarpone. And I used a chocolate graham cracker crust (since I had them on hand). The recipe crust would probably be better. My husband really liked it with sliced almonds on top.

Cheesecake was very creamy and smooth, not too heavy - as good as my old standby, Sour Cream Cheesecake. Crust was a little soggy but very tasty. Strawberries were delicious. I added 1 tsp. of Vanilla to the cheesecake mixture. Used 24 oz. Driscoll strawberries, 1/2 c. + 2 Tbsp sugar and 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar and marinated 3 hrs. First Time: Used Nonni's almond and walnut biscotti with a hint of anise. The "hint" of anise was too much for my liking. Second Time: Found almond biscotti at an Italian market. Much better

I thought it was pretty good, though not out of this world. Added 1 tsp. grated lemon peel and decided that was too much. I only wanted a hint of lemon, so next time I'll use 1/4 or 1/2 tsp.

My first cheesecake and it was SO tasty even though I messed up. I've never heard of a "water bath" so I didn't wrap my cheesecake as well as I should have and water leaked in. But I drained the excess water and cooked it anyway and it was fabulous! I did the water bath another way: I put a pan of water on the bottom rack of my oven and put the springform pan above, but I still got one or two cracks.

I would make this cheesecake again but next time I would serve it as an appetizer. I'm not kidding! We had a beautiful dinner and everyone was too full for dessert and, while everyone loved the taste of both the cheesecake and strawberries, less than 1/2 of it was eaten by 12 people. Why waste precious stomach space with veggies dipped in french onion dip.

Delecious! Was not as hard to make as I was anticipating. Received many compliments. Don't own a food processor so first crushed the biscotti with a rolling pin, then put in coffee bean grinder. Worked great! Water got into the springform pan during baking but cheesecake was fine. Just let it bake a little longer. Was told by a pastry chef that a large regular cake pan would work fine also.

Made this for an Easter party...there were lots of desert choices on the table but this was the 1st to be eaten up. Got rave reviews. Didnt have lots of faith in the balsamic strawberry mix but it really came around & was yummy. Added a bit more sugar and let it stand a couple of hours. Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter...am making again this weekend...

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The cheesecake was very dense and heavy. Not what I like. The strawberries are devine. I will definitely make those again. I much prefer the "Mascarpone Cheesecake with candied Pecans and Dulce de Leche Sauce." That cheesecake is light and fluffy and absolutely melts in your mouth. Next time I will serve that cheesecake with the balsamic strawberries.

I made this the other night for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Very easy to make. Like the other reviewers said, the strawberries in balsamic were wonderful and the biscotti crust excellent. The texture turned out just perfect. One of my guests admitted he wasn't usually a big fan of cheesecake but really loved this one. It's an easy recipe that can make you look like a fabulous cook. I'll definitely make it again.

Had a party for 25 people and this is one of the desserts I made (actually doubled the recipe for 2). It was a huge hit. Several people told me that it was the best cheesecake they had ever tasted and I agreed -- definitely the best I ever tasted. Use a good balsamic vinegar and just adjust the flavor of the berries to your taste, but the cheesecake is also amazing all by itself. Also listen to the advice of previous reviewer -- wrap extremely well with aluminum foil! But this is a very easy recipe.

i really loved the taste of this cheesecake. i'd never made crust from biscotti before and i liked the nice almond flavor of it. next time though i would REALLY marinate the strawberries for a few hours (rather than 30 minutes) to get the full sweetness of them.

There is a restauarant in Providence RI that makes athe most divine cheesecake -- apparently with marscapone. Tried this recipe to see if it came close and I can't believe how wonderful it is! Yumm!

People went berserk over this when I served it, very gratifying. The technique of putting the pan in the water while cooking is great--it keeps the cake from getting that sagging effect when it's cooling.

I would never have made this if someone hadn't made it first and shared it with me. This was the best cheesecake I have had, it was light the cake itself wasn't heavy, most cheesecakes that are baked have a heaviness to them. Oh and the strawberries, this cheesecake with fresh strawberries what a treat and what an extra treat with balsamic viniger, who would have ever guessed! Whoever put the two together..... what a chef!! I will difinitly make this again... I had never made a homemade cheesecake, this was a very simple recipe to follow and put together, and to have an outstanding success was very rewarding.. Thanks for sharing................

I was hesitant to try another cheesecake recipe since most of the ones I've tried were about as edible as a lead block, but everyone's recommendations won me over. The texture was light and fluffy and melt in your mouth. I used icing sugar and double the amount of sugar as I found it rather plain. The balsamic strawberries were wonderful and the entire cheesecake was gone in 1/2 an hour with requests for more. I would probably add some liquer and lemon next time but I'll definately make it again

This is a great cheesecake. I will definitely make it again. This is the same recipe I tasted at a cooking demonstration. The instructor recommended adding 2 1/2 tsp lemon zest and 2-3 tbsp lemon juice to make a lemon version, or the same quanities of lime zest/lime juice to make a key lime version. I'll definitely make this recipe again. It's very dense, so I may try using double the mascarpone cheese and reduce the cream cheese to see if that lightens it up a bit. The balsamic strawberries are great. The longer they soak in the sugar & vinegar, the sweeter they get!

This is AWESOME cheesecake. I also only chilled 8 hours & it was plenty. However, I did have to bake it for nearly 2 hours, and it still "shook" all over, but was golden on top. Turned out great.

This is the best plain cheesecake I've ever had. Even if the balsamic berries are too much for you, the cheesecake is a must. There is no subsitute for very good quality balsamic vinegar. The biscotti crust is worth experimenting with as well. I'll be subsituting the biscotti for any vanilla wafer crust in other recipes.

I'm not that good at making desserts, but this was pretty much a breeze and just excellent. The cheesecake is dense yet light, and even out-of-season strawberries tasted wonderful in the sugar and vinegar sauce. It was worth driving to 5 stores to find the mascarpone cheese and biscotti. I made it in the morning and served it the same evening, so about 8 hours of chilling seems adequate.

Excellent, dense cake, and the strawberries are excellent-I saw a strawberry balsamic vinegar in the market, but passed on it. I also made this with 1/3 less fat creamcheese, and it was excellent as well, also can reduce the butter in the crust by 50%, that is if you are interested in removing SOME fat.

We enjoyed this dish at a "progressive dinner" where each couple prepared a different course. This dessert is outstanding!!

This cheesecake was fantastic. Very easy to make and tasted out of this world. I served it at a dinner party the same day that I made it. The tiny piece left over the next day was good, too. If you can properly chill the cheesecake, I don't think you need to make it early. Also, raspberries were in season, so I substituted a raspberry sauce.

This was a fabulous heavy cheesecake. It was also very easy. We just love the strawberries with balsamic vinegar and won't eat our strawberries any other way now.
