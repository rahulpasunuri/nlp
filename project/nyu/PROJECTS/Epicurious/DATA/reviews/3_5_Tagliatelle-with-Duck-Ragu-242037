Kids and adults love this one. Made it about a half dozen times and it is always good. Make it!

Getting ready to make this again 4th time. Have made with duck and chicken thighs, I take skin off after searing and chop it up for garnish yummy! The hicken thighs are just as good and a lot cheaper than duck, with the rich ragu the duck flavor gets lost so why not :)

I have to add a dissenting review. While sticking to the original recipe - the only exception was using dried rosemary - I found the flavor in this dish to be disappointing. In fact, if you look at other positive reviews, you'll notice a lot of chefs seem to have altered the recipe. Those recipes certainly may be 4 forks, I don't think this one is. My main problem is that while the duck meat is very tender, the taste isn't special, the meat could have been brisket. Basically, to me, the duck doesn't do anything for this dish. My suggestion would be not to waste a duck breast on this recipe. It's probably a 2 forker, but the cooking time and extra clean-up along with requiring an expensive duck breast drags it down in my estimation.

I made this using whole duck so I could use the bones for duck stock instead of chicken stock (I've been a professional Chef and am fussy). The leg meat has a far better texture when cooked using moist heat cooking and was waaay better tasting. If I don't make stock, I am going to make it out of leg meat only. I have found Asian markets are the best place to get duck legs. Very tasty, everyone loved it.

This was lovely! I had leftover confit of duck so I shredded it up and used it instead of fresh duck. I pureed the whole works instead of leaving the duck in chunks and the resulting sauce was lip smacking good!

In my opinion there is only one way to make this dish. Put the duck in a slow cooker! Absolutely to die for! This way it is very easy and you can add as much of the duck fat as you would like to make it rich. I thought there was not quite enough sauce, and I only made this for 2. We had enough sauce for 3, but I don't think I could have stretched it for 4. Next time I will double the sauce (for leftovers) and I only pureed half the sauce to still have some chunks (used diced tomatoes)

The flavor was pretty good. I used a whole duck (quartered), which imparted flavor from the bones. I wouldn't use butter to fry the duck again as it caused the pan to burn very quickly. I thought it a bit odd that the pasta wasn't tossed in grated parmesan or herbs and decided to add parsley - which turned out to be great in giving the dish an added dimension. At a guest's request, I also provided chili flakes and found that it took the recipe up another notch.

My husband gobbled it up. I am not an experienced cook, so I gauge recipes based on how many mistakes I can make and still have the result taste good. Here's how I screwed up: didn't sear the duck for long enough (I think they really want DARK brown), I rubbed the chopped duck with salt and pepper instead of seasoning the sauce with it, the sauce just wouldn't reduce (I ended up with like 5 cups of it) so I put in 2 tsp. brown sugar to simulate caramelization. I used a can of pureed tomatoes with basil instead of whole tomatoes. I put too much salt in the water so the noodles were a bit softer than al dente. Despite all this, it was still yummy. The directions were really clear and specific. Thank you Aromi!

This recipe is a keeper! Instead of using 4 duck breasts, I just quartered a whole pekin duck, and I shredded the meat instead of chopping it. I also let the sauce reduce a bit more (uncovered of course) before blending it. Delish! I'm thinking of doing pizza with the leftover ragu : )

wonderful with the addition of - 3/4 cup sauteed finely diced fresh carrots triple garlic cloves homemade chicken stock ("Better Than Bouillon" is a decent substitute) fresh tagliatelle (procured from molinari's if you're in SF) 2003 pio cesare nebbiolo the above, lovely on a chilly night.

I thought this was great even though I forgot to process it at the end of the recipe. Delish

Absolutely fantastic! I love duck, and I love ragu, so I'm not sure why I never tried anything like this before. Served with sauteed green beans with lemon and garlic, it was the perfect dinner. DO try and make it; it is worth the wait!

I had something similar at Incanto in SF and this recipe was a good substitute for the home chef. I added some nice green olives and a bit of lemon zest to the finished product and it was wonderful. Perfect for a rainy Sunday dinner.

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM! I used canned diced tomatoes instead of chopping up canned whole tomatoes, and also forgot to add the chicken stock (oops!) It turned out great anyway, just a little thicker than it was meant to.

Very good - rich and comforting. I would have given it 3/12 forks if that were an option. Perfect fall or winter meal.

Easy and delicious! I cook duck many different ways and this is a keeper for a richer, pasta dish for duck. You absolutely need to use breasts or you will not have the desired amount of fat and crispiness of skin to go into the finished product.

This dish was simply amazing. My family is Italian and I chose to make the dish for Mothers Day... everyone was ecstatic. The richness of the sauce and the deepness of the duck flavor is one of a kind. I used Papardelle instead.

We thought this was good - the sauce had a nice flavor and consistency - but in my husband's words "the duck lost it's duck-ness".

Very good and different. Not sure use of the expensive breast is necessary. I think it would work with legs too. Use a tight lid or you'll lose too much liquid.

Outstanding recipe. Usually something this rich tasting takes more time and ingredients, but made as is, it came out perfect. Can't recommend this enough.

delicious and rich, as promised. i made this pretty much as written, although i increased ingredient amounts a bit to feed five. also, i made the ragu ahead of time, and i think allowing the sauce to rest overnight really improved it. see here for pictures! http://www.flickr.com/photos/figandplum/2376465334/

Well...Wow! This is one of those recipes that transcend one's preconceptions about the ingredients and techniques involved. I love rich, savory dishes and this certainly fit the bill. However, it was not at all heavy. It felt rather "nouveau- French", wholesome and comforting. I made this for my partner & I, and he literally licked his plate clean! We're saving the leftovers for an insane lasagna with wild mushrooms and smoked mozzarella. What an easy, impressive recipe! p.s. I hate to modify on the first attempt, but I hate de-fatting sauces at the end, so I poured off half of the duck fat after cooking the onions. Still silky and rich!
