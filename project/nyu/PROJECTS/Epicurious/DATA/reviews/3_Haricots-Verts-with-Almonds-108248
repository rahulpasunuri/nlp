Just okay. I used a lot more almond slivers too but still a little boring.

I used Trader Joe's frozen haricot verts and it turned out great. Quick and easy.

To make it 4 forks, add a step: saute some garlic before adding the haricot verts. It really kicks this into overdrive. My guests couldn't get enough!

Very good and easy. I added salt and pepper but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.

Couldn't be easier, and delicious. On the food network someone made this recipe with carmelized onions so I'm definitely going to try that next.

Such a simple side dish. We add kosher salt, too.

Simple preparation. I used toasted pine nuts instead of almonds.

Great, easy recipe. We went over on the almonds and that was a good idea. We also sauteed a whole clove or so of garlic in the olive oil as it was heating up to flavor the oil. Hardly noticable but probably added to the flavor. Would definitely make again - especially since we used a bag of frozen haricots verts. Very simple.
