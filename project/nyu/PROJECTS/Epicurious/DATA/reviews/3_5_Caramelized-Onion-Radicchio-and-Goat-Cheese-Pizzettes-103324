Lovely recipe. I used the Treviso variety of radicchio, which we can get in our farmer's market. The leaves are a little more tender and a beautiful rich purply red color. I also did this as one large pizza and drizzled olive oil over the crust before adding the onions and radicchio. Everyone raved about the pizza. Definitely a keeper.

Really enjoyed this. Used pizza dough recipe from this site (Bon Appetit March 2007) and made one large pie rather than pizzettes. Omitted the thyme and flavor was excellent.

This combination works. I made it according to the recipe except cooked it on a stone on my grill. I use a lot of wood in my grill and like to cook pizza on it for the wood fired flavor. My only adjustment next time will be to brush the crust with some olive oil and sprinkle some good olive oil on top for flavor, moisture and to help melt the goat cheese better. This could also inspire a summer rigatoni dish with the same combo.

Made this with store bought gourmet crust. Used seasoned feta rather than goat cheese. Really a nice flavor combo. It is nice to start carmelizing the onions a couple hours before dinner. It gives the house such a great smell! People think you've cooking all day! Quick assembly makes this a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe. It will make a great addition to our pizza repertoire. I did cook the onions somewhat longer than indicated to achieve a rich caramellization. The goat cheese is a nice alternative to more tradional cheeses.
