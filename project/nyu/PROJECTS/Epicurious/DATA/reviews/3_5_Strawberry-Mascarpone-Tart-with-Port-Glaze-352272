Complex recipe, but yummy.

I would say I'm not the best baker - but I'd also say this recipe does not appear that difficult. My version of this tart was less than impressive. The crust/tart was a bit hard and not at all flaky, and the cheese curdled right away when I added the lemon juice. I'm not sure how to rectify the cheese issue - and it looks like I'm not alone, based on other reviews. Before serving to a crowd, I would try this recipe out first to be sure you really like it.

I'm a fairly inexperienced baker, but had a great time with this recipe. Was able to use a foil-lined 9" square cakepan, instead of something special. Used rice for the weight, to prevent bubbling. My strawberries were no the best (a little white), but swapping 1/2lb with raspberries worked really well. Rather than Port, I used some chocolate wine I had around. On the whole, it was delicious. I would use way less sugar though-- it is loaded in the crust, cheese, and strawberries. I also might try using blueberries, or apricots, along with the strawberries. The mascarpone shone.

Delicious and not too sweet! Used the zest of an entire large lemon +1 Tbl fresh lemon juice in the filling, which gave it a discernible, but still light, lemon flavor. Also, the mascarpone becomes stiff in just a minute or two (it will curdle if beaten too much). I was tired of butter crusts shrinking far below the rim of the tart pan; this time I froze the crust for 40 minutes, and it came out perfect.

Quite yummy! I made a couple changes based on previous reviewers' comments: an extra 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and 2 Tbsp of brown sugar in with the marscapone. I was also out of port, so I used a mixture of sherry and triple sec.

It looked exactly like the picture and was so pretty!! I didn't add the Port, and just reduced the syrup that came right from the strawberries, which was delicious. I think the Port would've just messed with the flavor of it. I didn't have mascarpone, so instead I made my own by mixing 16 oz. of cream cheese (2 packages), 1/2 cup of sour cream, and 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I had to beat it a little bit to get it smooth. Then I measured out 2 cups of the cream cheese mixture and just followed the rest of the directions with that as my mascarpone. I've never had mascarpone, but the substitute tasted great. The crust was delicious, and tasted almost like a shortbread. I had to add a few more spoonfuls of flour because it was so sticky, and there was no way I could knead it before adding the extra flour. The crust was very easy and well worth it. I had considered just using a store bought pie crust, but I'm definitely glad I didn't. I blind baked it for the full twenty minutes, but after I took off the pie weights (I used dried black beans), I only baked it another fifteen minutes. I didn't have any problems with the filling curdling, but after reading the reviews, I thought it was better to be safe than sorry, so I mixed the zest, vanilla, and lemon juice together before mixing it into the mascarpone. When it says to beat the filling until stiff, I was imagining whipped cream, but it only needs to mixed until smooth and combined. It won't thicken, or go through any big changes, or at least it won't with the substitue mascarpone I used. I didn't add any brown sugar, nutmeg, or anything else. It didn't need it, but I will try it next time, because I can see how it might add to it. Overall, it was easy, beautiful, and delicious!

Like others, I had trouble with curdling. I tried mixing the lemon with the vanilla first, but the mascarpone mixture curdled immediately when I added the lemon-vanilla. I might try again, but next time just use lemon zest and no juice. I also added the brown sugar and nutmeg, and before the lemon was added, it was delicious!

I made this recipe for a dinner that was heavy. this tart was good and light. subtle lemon taste and not too sweet. i also liked the crust. i made this using recommendation of adding brown sugar and more lemon.

I concur with other reviewers that the tart shell recipe is definitely a KEEPER. Bland mascarpone?-- it's supposed to be bland, to not overwhelm the flavor of the berries. If you don't have absolutely fresh beautiful strawberries, then adding extra lemon or nutmeg may help. Next time I make this I'm going to try a ginger cream tart filling from a Gourmet recipe from July 2002 ("Berry Tart with Ginger Cream"); this makes a tart filling that is like what I always imagine fruit tarts SHOULD taste like but rarely do. Also I wasn't crazy about "drizzling" the glaze over the berries at the end; next time I will toss the berries with the glaze to coat and then top the tart with the glazed berries.

Fab!! Quick and easy. Very impressive! Probably added more lemon juice to mascarpone as I don't tend to measure!!...a good squeeze....No prob with curdling! Used 1.5 lb of mascarpone as I'm a bit greedy!! DELISH!! Just going back for a third helping!!.....well no point in saving that last bit is there?!!!

I just made this tart for the first time and will definitely be making it again. I included a few modifications that were listed here to help improve the filling; I added 2 tbsp brown sugar to the filling in addition to the granulated sugar. I also increased the lemon juice by 1/2 tsp and added a pinch of nutmeg. Other members mentioned the mascarpone curdling when the lemon juice is added - I would suggest making sure you use full-fat mascarpone and perhaps mixing the lemon juice with the vanilla before adding. I would also caution to make sure that you cook the glaze long enough so that it reduces down to 1/4 cup. I pulled it off too early and ended up with a really watery consistency, which is too bad b/c it tasted great.

I was so excited to make this for a fancy beach party- it was perfect. tart was great exactly as it was, but I took some other reviewers idea of changing up the filling. I used heavy whipping cream, confectioners sugar making whipped cream and then adding lemon zest and ricotta- perfect! I assembled it a bit too early so I stuck it in the freezer to keep it assembled. Fabulous!

Rating: 0
After reading the reviews, I went ahead and made the filling. I mixed the the ingredients and immediately after I added the 1T of lemon juice the mixture curdled. It happened so fast, I was kind of shocked even though it had happened to others. I did use my food processor to mix it instead of whisking by hand. Could this have been the problem? Or could it have been the brand of Mascarpone?

Alot of comments have been made about the blandness of the mascapone... This can be remedied by adding rMORE LEMON (I used 1 lemon, rind and juice), 2 tbsp.BROWN SUGAR, instead of the 1/3 cup white sugar, and a dash of NUTMEG and CINNAMON. It was a hit - with Austrians who KNOW desserts!

Pretty flexible..I accidentally made the crust without the egg yolk and it was delicious. More like a short bread. Didn't have time fresh berries while making the syrup (wife was out buying the ingredients) so boiled the port with some frozen - still worked. Had to make mascarpone (sour cream, cream cheese, heavy cream)...one of those days. Still turned out great.

Rating: 4
OMG! This was amazing!! Yum! Yum! Yum! Made just as written but didn't whip the mascarpone till stiff I just stirred the other ingredients into it and spread in the shell. I do think you could do half the amount of the filling and increase the strawberries to save on calories and it would still be just as delicious. Will try that next time.

For me, nothing except the glaze worked. The crust dough came out too wet, and even after it was baked was gummy and blah. The mascarpone filling was blah, too, and curdled. The glaze was great. I ended out serving this with a layer of vanilla ice cream over the mascarpone, which saved it from being awful. I don't know what happened, as I'm an experienced baker, but this just plain didn't work for me.

The crust is amazing! I use it for all of my tarts now. The had higher expectations for the filling, but with a few simple mods it can become very delicious. The sauce was wonderful and the tart overall was a big hit.

This dish was a hit with my family and our guests. Breaking down the components; the strawberries and glaze worked well together although I used white wine instead of Port. The pastry was exceptional; flavorful and so very easy. I struggle with pastry, often sacrificing flavor for ease of handling by using butter substitutes. No more! The mascarpone did not curdle, nor did it have a strong flavor as many have pointed out. However I did get the subtle taste of it, hence all components were complimentary. Next time I may try foregoing the Port glaze and add bourbon to the mascarpone instead of the lemon vanilla combination.

The first time I made this I gave it 4 forks, now it's down to 2. The best things about this recipe are it's ease, presentation and tart shell. The mascarpone filling is bland. I don't know why I didn't notice that before. I would make the shell and strawberry topping again but with a different filling.

I've made this pie a few times - the first two times I followed the recipe precisely and it came out great, although I would say if you are making this in the summer heat to make sure you serve it promptly or it may get a bit mushy. The third time it was far too hot out to turn on the oven so I replaced the crust with an easy no bake chocolate cookie crumble crust. It turned out a bit sweet for my taste, but my guests loved it.

I see where lots of people felt the filling was bland. Here's a substitution suggestion (from the plum tart recipe also on this website) * 8 ounces soft fresh goat cheese * 8 ounces (1 cup) whole-milk ricotta cheese * 3 tablespoons honey * 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil * 1 tablespoon sugar * 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg * 1/8 teaspoon coarse kosher salt * Pinch of freshly ground black pepper Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Plum-Tart-with-Goat-Cheese-and-Walnut-Thyme-Streusel-108598#ixzz0tgT30gvy

I forgot my recipe book at work and needed a crust recipe for my fruit tart. This came out great. I always fill my fruit tarts with pastry cream, and fresh fruit. If you don't want the added work of making your own pastry cream, try instant vanilla pudding and top with fresh fruit.

This dessert was good, but not great. When I give something 3 forks, it means I am happy I made it, it tasted good, but I am not keeping the recipe. The only exception to this rule it that I may keep the recipe just for the crust - which I did not need to bake as long as called for.

I made this for dessert on Easter. It was a HUGE hit. Everyone loved it. I highly recommend making it.

I made this by the recipe for Easter brunch and the filling for this was much too heavy. I am usually all for more marscapone, but in this it would have been better if I had used half marscapone and half cream. The filling didn't spread easily into the crust, didn't have much flavor, and there was a lot left over. Won't make again.

Made this for an Easter Brunch...excellent appearance....love the look of this dessert on table...crust was excellent too, will use again with other desserts. I did not like the mascarpone filling; it did not curdle and was rather dense. I tried to lighten it with creme fraiche but still found the filling bland and dense. I will try this recipe again with cream cheese and whipping cream,

Just made this for Easter Brunch and there was none left, although lots of requests for 2nd helpings! Made a mix of ricotta, mascarpone and heavy whipping cream (whipped) and extra 1/3 confectioner's sugar. I also add the sugar and port to the strawberries. Why not? Had no problems with curdling that others mentioned. Next time I would probably use mascarpone and whipped cream to keep a thicker "custard-like" texture and try to roll the dough versus a hand press to get even consistency with the bottom and sides. (Not sure if that's going to work) The crust is truly genius and I'll use it in other recipes from now on. Great as is, so it can only get better!

this was DEEE- LISH- the first and second time making it I made it exactly, then the third time making it I didn't have port so I made a balsamic reduction and, holy cow, I think I like the balsamic a tad better. mmmm balsamic and stawberries!!!

Rather than slicing strawberries in half (which would have yielded BIG bites) I sliced them in the food processor. This increased the amount of juice blended with the port. The thinner-sliced strawberries also appeared "dried out" within a few hours. For these reasons I didn't find it worked very well as a "make ahead" dish (even just 6 hours in advance of serving). The mascarpone cheese was also pretty bland.

The crust is simple and delicious. I found the port glaze a bit sweet and have used gran marnier instead--which I though was even better than the port.

Cooked this yesterday for a special dinner. It is fab. I may add a bit more confectioners sugar to the mascappone another time, I used low fat mascapone and it worked well. I made ahead of time as suggested and the tart kept well. I served with lof fat greak yoghurt on the side which also worked. We loved the crust which is a bit like our shortbread

I saw this on the cover of Gourmet and had to make it. It was a huge success. I tried it old school and made the dough by hand, but found that the warmth geeked up the dough. I then switched over to the food processor and the flour received the butter much better that way. The lemon in the crust was a nice touch! It was devoured...so that's a good sign.

This tart is lovely! I live in a rural area and a tough time finding mascarpone....but trust me cream cheese didn't substitute well. Do not use all of the port wine glaze, but other than that follow the recipe to the "T" and all will delight in it. This tart saved me with my home association. I built a fence that I shouldn't have and they knocked on the door and my husband said "Come have some tart..." and then all was fine!!!

Rating: 4
This is so delicious! I used a 12" tart pan instead of the 10" the recipe requires, so I made 1.5x the dough and that worked out fine. I would not change a thing about the mascarpone filling, it was so tasty! Next time I may omit the port sauce...I think fresh, juicy berries by themselves would be good enough and much less effort.

you have to really LOVE creamy (dairy) stuff to eat this. i temporarily lost my mind when i got it in my head to make this. the cream filling was quite tasteless and it was really too much, for me anyway. it is a LOT of cream. the strawberries and the glaze are nice. i didn't bother to load all the berries on top. the crust is good. and, the recipe is easy to make. i wouldn't make this again though. just not my taste.

I liked this tart, but had trouble with the shell. I cooked the shell using the time suggested and it both shrunk and burnt -- shame on me for not checking it sooner, but my three young children were insane this morning and in all the chaos, I forgot to check it. I remade the shell, used the pie weights for 5 extra minutes and took 8 FULL MINUTES OFF the total cooking time. It came out much better the second time, but by this time, I was a more than a little frustrated. In the end, it must have been worth it as three people specifically asked me what was in the crust! Overall, my guests thought that the tart was great. Personally, I loved the hint of lemon-vanilla of the mascarpone. Also, I used two full pounds of strawberries and was glad to have the extra for the top. Very pretty dessert.

Rating: 4
This is a winner! Was really easy and and spectacular dessert. Having all the parts ready, put together at serving time. I almost lost my glaze, which firmed up quickly after slowly reducing. It firmed too much too fast. Remedied by adding more Port and microwaving. Once you know the routine, it will come together next time without a hitch.

My family and I did not care for this recipe. I have crust recipes which are much better and this crust seemed a little mushy or stale(?). I don't know, it was off somehow. The filling was awkward and bland to me. It sat in the refrig for several days until someone picked all the strawberries off the top(they were good) and I ended up throwing almost half of it away.

This was my very first tart and I am thrilled with the results. My guests were, too. A couple of things I discovered. This was my first time working with mascarpone and I was a little confused reading the recipe because I said to beat until still with peaks. To me, this implied that the mascarpone needed to be softened up a great deal, which I did. But as it melted, it was hard to get it back to a smooth consistency. I added the lemon -- don't think it curdled the mixture -- but I ended up getting out my hand mixer and beating the mixture until smooth. Worked very well. I also put it in the freezer for a few minutes to stiffen it up before putting into crust. After I put the mascarpone filling into crust, I put in refrigerator. I added the strawberries and glaze about 30 minutes before the guests arrived, and served it about hour and half later. Gave time for juices to begin to penetrate crust without enough time to make it soggy.

Delicious! I've made other tarts using mascarpone and they've never tasted this good. I didn't add the lemon juice to the filling after reading reviews and with a little more zest, you won't miss it.

I made this tart for mother's day and it turned out beautifully! I did take the advice: "I made this for Easter dinner and as others have mentioned, the tart crust was delicious, but I am on the fence abut the mascarpone filling. I think next time I make this I will use 1 cup heavy cream, whipped until fluffy, mix in 1 cup ricotta cheese and 1 cup mascarpone with 1/2-3/4 cup of sugar with zest of a lemon (not sure why everyone's is curdling) Right before serving top with strawberries and I think instead of the port wine glaze a balsamic glaze would be better! It is a beautiful tart, the very essence of spring and summer" This worked wonderfully. the filling was delicious. I used 1/2 cup of sugar which i beat in with the whipped cream in the beginning. I actually didn't end up using the port glaze and the tart was wonderful without it. Beautifully simple. This tart is perfect for any spring/summer event!

Made this for a family backyard bbq and got absolute rave reviews. Definitely a dessert that looks impressive, despite how easy it is! I didn't include the port glaze and I don't think the tart suffered too much for it. It just had a fresh spring taste. I did have an issue with very lumpy (or "rustic") looking crust. I didn't use pie weights and I suppose that was the issue but if anyone has any advice on how to get a smooth looking crust I'd love to hear it!

I have nothing to say about this recipe. It's simply amazing. I added the strawberries hours before serving, but held off on the glaze until right before serving. I also added some extra sugar to the marscapone to taste, but feel that's a personal preference. Really easy.

Yummy! I used a little more than 1/2 cup sherry instead of port. It's cheaper than port besides tasting great in it! I used 1 cup marscapone and 1 cup whipped whipping cream instead. Next time I will use less powdered sugar in the filling. It was great!

Made this for friends last weekend and it was superb! We all LOVED it! The recipe is perfect as written, plenty sweet enough and the mascarpone was fresh and light (no curdling). I noticed that everyone who said it curdled said they had whipped the mascarpone (with a mixer?) and the recipe calls for whisking--maybe the over-beat it? Anyway, I wouldn't change a thing. As everyone says, the crust is delicious--like a butter cookie! I also highly recommend assembling at the last minute since it only takes about 5 minutes to put together. Yum-- can't wait to make it again!

I made this as a test for a dinner party and the crust was amazing. I didn't find the filling sweet enough, so think I will add more sugar to the mascarpone next time. I didn't have a problem with the curdling, but I did add the juice slowly after mixing at each bit added. I also suggest adding the glaze shortly before serving.

This turned out great! The pastry is a keeper for sure - crisp, delicate and flavorful. I find mascarpone to be too heavy, so I used 8 oz creme fraiche and 4 oz mascarpone (4 oz less total creme than the recipe calls for). I found this ratio to be just right. I recommend adding the glaze just before serving so it doesn't 'bleed'. The pastry was so good, it is going to be a standby for me to experiment with different toppings.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a hit. I'm not sure why others had trouble with curdling...was not an issue at all. I increased the powdered sugar to 1/2 cup and the lemon juice to 2 TBSP. It's important to cook the glaze long enough so that isa thick glaze not a thin syrup. Creamy, fresh, delicious!

I have never baked a tart before and although it did take me a while to make the crust, everything else was very easy. I did not have any trouble with the filling curdling - but I used a fork to mix it together. There was some run off of strawberry juice by the time it was ready to be served, so I would suggest asembling the tart as close to serving time as possible. It was a huge hit at Easter lunch. Everyone loved it!

Very good but not fabulous; the mascarpone filling is a little on the thick side - I think I'd prefer a pastry cream or something a little lighter. I did not use the lemon juice after seeing these reviews, just upped the lemon zest and it worked fine.

I made this for a brunch, and it was fabulous. I used cream cheese instead of mascarpone, and didn't have any problems when adding the lemon juice. Don't put the berries on top until you are ready to serve, otherwise they will continue to leak juice and make the crust soggy. Also, I don't think the port glaze is neccessary, it was almost too much like cough syrup. The crust is the best part of this dish, I could see using it for any kind of tart. It's very easy to work with, too, unlike some other pastry. Delicious!!

Like butter - literally. Crust good, other bad. I am an avid baker, and made this recipe last night for a dinner party. When I attempted to whip the marscapone when mixed w/ lemon separated and became watery and curdy. I thought it might still be edible, and took it to a friend's house. Big mistake. It was a layer of butter-like fat on a crust topped with strawberries drenched in port sauce. I cannot even call it "okay."

Made this as directed and was delicious - it's like a fancy version of strawberry shortcake (one of our family's favourite desserts). The crust was nice, but I didn't think the press-in was that much faster or easier than just rolling it. Either way, probably get the same results. I will definitely be making this again, especially as the local berries start coming in!
