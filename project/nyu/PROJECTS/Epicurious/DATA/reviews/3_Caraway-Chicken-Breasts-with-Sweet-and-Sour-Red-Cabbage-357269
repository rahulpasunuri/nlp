I enjoyed this recipe--after simmering in a glazed reduction, red cabbage has never tasted so good. The caraway can be a little overpowering, I plan to use less the next time I make this.

It was good for a nice weeknight meal. I pulled the whole thing together in about 20 minutes, and it was good for a nice little weeknight meal that's lighter on the calories. But take it just for that. Don't try to make this out to be some grandly spectacular dinner. Its simple and fast. When I saute a chicken breast, I invariably paillard the breast to give it an even thickness. This along with attentive cooking and a meat thermometer gives me a perfectly moist and done breast every time

Overall a quick and tasty meal, but somewhat underwhelming as a whole. The take-away though is the cabbage. Fantastic and worth keeping the how-to.

Quick and tasty. I would decrease the allspice by just a tad next time but overall it was very good.

The flavors were really good here, and I'll definitely make the cabbage again. But the method for cooking the chicken left it tough and dry. Use your go-to boneless skinless chicken breast method instead of this one.

Would not recommend or make this again. Flavors were not good and it was time consuming.

Easy, different and delicious! I used regular bacon--no applewood in the frig-- and did everything else just as written.

Not very good at all. Do not recommend.

I only made the Sweet-and-Sour Red Cabbage, but it was outstanding. Next time I might try with some sliced apple, but not because the recipe was lacking. I liked the fact that the cabbage had some texture to it. My 9 year old gobbled it down.
