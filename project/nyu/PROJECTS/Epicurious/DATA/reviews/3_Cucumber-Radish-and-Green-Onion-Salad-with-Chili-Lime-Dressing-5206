This is perfect as is. The spicyness is just the way I like it, the dressing was fine (using light soy) and the flavors perfectly balanced. Simple and delicious, reminding me of South East Asia. A keeper.

Simple, fresh, crunchy. I'd add more mint, I think. Used Splenda instead of sugar because my boyfriend can't eat sugar, and I didn't notice a taste difference. Definitely make the chili-lime dressing.

It was good, but a little too spicy. Next time I would only add 1 tsp of chili oil.
