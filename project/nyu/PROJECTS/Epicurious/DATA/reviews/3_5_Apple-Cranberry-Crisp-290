I made this last night, and it was very easy, but I probably won't make it again. I think I would have enjoyed it with less cranberries, maybe two cups instead of three, as it was quite tart. My husband loved it though. Also, I took another cook's advice and doubled the amount of topping I used, and was happy I did. On second thought, I probably will make it again, only with less cranberries. I think I'll sprinkle extra cinnamon over the filling before adding the topping, too. (We love cinnamon!)

I was looking for a cranberry-apple compote, which there were no recipes for at the time, so I made the filling of this without the topping and baked it in a covered casserole dish. (Actually two covered casserole dishes, although it cooked down a lot and I combined them and served it in one dish.) Served with pancakes and vanilla yogurt for brunch. Delicious and the perfect balance between sweet and tart.

Mushy apples (and I cut them large), yucky oats...just not crispy. The combo is good but the recipe just doesn't cut it...keep looking!

I got rave reviews when I made this, however, next time I would half the cranberries - it seemed a little too much for me.

Served this at Xmas dinner to rave reviews. I did follow some of the advice mentioned however. I decreased the amount of cranberries and added some pears, I also doubled the crumb topping and served it with vanilla bean ice cream. Its best served warm. Everyone was licking their plates.

This was ok. I made it with fresh cranberries left over from Christmas. The smell may have been better than the taste. I baked it over an hour and STILL the apples where a bit too firm. I used 2x's the amount for topping as someone suggested. A great suggestion. Ice cream or frozen yogurt is a must. I tried to get by serving it with homemade whip cream and the tartness was overwhelming. Served it the following day with ice cream and it was a lot better.

I really liked the sour taste from the cranberries. I made twice more toppiing to cover the all apples & cranberries. It was so delicious!!

Made some modifications but, it was delicious and the house smelt wonderful. I've given the recipe to a few friends and we all agree this one is a keeper!

We didn't have any nutmeg, didn't matter. It was wonderful! I would recommend using fresh cranberries instead of dried. Fresh adds extra moisture that will stop it from being too dry.

I used a variety of Granny Smith, McIntosh & Fuji apples. I served it without the vanilla frozen yogurt the first day. It was a little too tart. On day 2 I served it with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious!

A little tart, but did not serve with frozen yogurt or ice cream, which would have sweetened it up. Really easy, and looks and smells wonderful.

This is a really quick, really good recipe that also happens to be relatively low in fat. I used a mixture of apples, pears and frozen blueberries. One caution: this is so good, it won't serve 6 in the average household!
