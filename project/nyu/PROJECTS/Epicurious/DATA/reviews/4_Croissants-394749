This recipe, like all croissant recipes, requires patience. The stages can't be rushed, or they will be flawed. For example, i've had butter seep out if I don't let them rise long enough or at too high a temperature, or if I try to sneak extra turns in before the dough has rested enough. Even flawed, they're still better than what I can buy at my local bakeries. I have frozen these (before baking) with good results. A convection oven really does work better here than a regular oven, though results are still delicious! By the way, Pierre Herme is best known for his macaron, but I firmly believe that his croissants are the best in Paris.
