Delicious recipe! My children (6 & 8) weren't fond of the avocado, but loved the rest.

This recipe is great - I wouldn't characterize it as "quick", though. Will definitely make again. Next time I will use fewer beans and will get 2 avocados (had fair bit of other ingredients left, but ran out of avocados first).

I hesitated to try this recipe because it only has 1 review. Glad I did as it's a definite winner. Delicious, loaded with fresh veggies, and really satisfying. My 14 year-old was so enthused when she saw the first quesadilla come off the griddle that she jumped in and cooked and served the rest. I found the raw onion in the salsa a little bit strong, so next time I might use less or substitute sweet onion for the red.
