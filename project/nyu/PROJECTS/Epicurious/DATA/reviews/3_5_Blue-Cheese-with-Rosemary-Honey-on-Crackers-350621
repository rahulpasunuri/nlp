Yuk. I did not like the honey and blue cheese together at all and when you add the rosemary it was just awful. Luckily I tried one before wasting the entire 10 ounces of blue cheese.

I am a huge fan of blue cheese, and I am always looking for a new appetizer idea. I went with Maytag because of the strong flavor and Wasa whole grain crackers to make sure the cheese would not completely overwhelm the cracker. An added benefit is the cracker has indentations that contained the rosemary honey with out being a huge mess.

These have an incredibly rich flavor. I used Vinta crackers. I dripped the honey onto the cracker and blue cheese and then placed the scallion. Be sure when you are cooking the honey that you keep it low and it does not get too hot and begin to boil. My first batch turned into toffee when it cooled and I had to throw it away. Very delicious!

Not rating, as I made several changes that make these easier and less messy to serve without compromising the flavors. First, I made them in wonton cups - this helped immensely with containing the drizzled honey. Second, I used softened whipped cream cheese to bind the crumbled blue cheese - about a cup of cream cheese to 10 oz cheese. Then a spoonful into each little cup, a drizzle of honey, and a little sprinkle of sliced scallion and finely chopped toasted walnut. To make wonton cups, brush wonton (or gyoza) wrappers on one side with olive or vegetable oil, press them oiled side up into mini-muffin pans, and bake at 350 for 8 or 10 minutes, until golden. The cups can be made ahead and frozen; just wait until just before party time to fill them so they don't become soggy.

I feel like a party pooper with so many positive reviews but I thought these were terrible & so did the rest of my family. My taste buds were spasming. I used Maytag blue cheese and maybe that was too strong but I'm not going to try again.

Flavors are really good, but very messy!

Great recipe. Very easy and can be prepared without the honey in advance.

Would recommend simmering the rosemary and honey for longer than ten minutes to bring out the flavor of the herb. Good taste, but really impactical as far as serving goes......can you say honey all over the table, floor, clothes?

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and my guests loved it. I put the honey out in a bowl and allowed guests to drizzle themselves, which helped make it not so sticky. The suggestion to freeze the blue cheese prior to slicing is genius and totally helpful. Definitely will make this again.

Delicious and easy! I used multigrain crackers and I went with a previous poster's suggestions to simmer the honey and rosemary together longer and drizzle the honey at the last minute. I had to make a few more platters of them as they went fast!

Perfect flavors!!! Honey is a long time scrumptious companion to bleu cheese. This is beautiful! Addictive!!

Needing hors d'oeuvres to bring to a dinner party, I would never have tried these except for the rave reviews. They are wonderful! The combination of tastes is just perfect. I did the mini crackers, but would use full-size in the future. I also think partially thawing the blue cheese would make it easier to slice. I accidentally left the honey and rosemary simmering for about 25 minutes, and I think it helped add to the flavor.

AMAZING. Nobody could get enough, perfect and complete flavour combination. People who didn't like blue cheese liked these. Will continue to make these for years to come.

These are very tasty and I will certainly make again. They are also beautiful. I used mini crackers to make these truly bite-size and I think that works best.

i used four sprigs of rosemary and heated the honey for about 10 mins. as per the recipe. the smell and taste of rosemary came right through. this was super easy to put together and tasted great. it was also a bit unusual so it's fun to make for a party and expose people to a new combination of tastes. everyone enjoyed it.

This was a great appetizer and my guests loved it. I used Kashi stoneground 7 grain crackers; I also used about 5 rosemary sprigs and let the honey and rosemary sit on very low heat for about an hour. The result is a very pronounced rosemary flavor in the honey, which everyone loved. I suppose it depends on which flavors you are trying to bring out: more of the sweet or more of the savory. Cut the scallions very thin if possible! One more thing is drizzle on the honey right before you serve them, otherwise if they sit for a long time and soak into the cracker the crackers get a little mushy. Great hors d'oeuvre though, definitely will do this one again.

Yum, yum, yum. This is going to be my new "go-to" recipe for get togethers and parties. It is delicious! I do agree with a previous poster, I'm not sure the rosemary was a nevessary addition to the honey. Maybe I didn't infuse it long enough, but I couldn't taste it. I think it is just as good without. The blue cheese and honey and scallions are a beautiful combination of flavors.

I used a ginger thin cookie as the cracker and they were a hit! I wanted to do something fun for a holiday cocktail party and it was so easy.

This is delicious! Homemade honey mixture drizzled over blue cheese with an unexpected bite of scallion. What's not to like?

It's cheese and crackers so of course it's good. But the rosemary infused honey did not stand out at all. The tiny drizzle just ended up tasting like plain honey.
