I used this recipe for my first experiment in crepe-making, and then again for Mother's Day brunch. Good results both times. I doubled the recipe, which made just about enough for a hungry family of five. I used two skillets (12" and 10"), with 1/3 cup batter for each crepe, swirled in the pan to make a thinnish layer. It's important to use clarified butter in the skillet, as milky residue in the butter causes it to spatter.

Meh Batter was too thick Tasted like cardboard Glad I had had quality ingredients for filling these otherwise they would have been inedible.

Excellent -- just like the ones I used to have as a child. One tip: do not use a griddle, as it's difficult to spread them out quickly enough to keep them thin, as crepes are supposed to be.

This was a great basic crepe recipe, and easy too. It tasted great, was easy to cook, and I had little problems with browning. I added nutella and bananas and it was perfect.

This recipe is identical to one a former French boyfriend gave me and I've been making it for years. I've tried a couple of others but I always come back to this because it's easy, authentic, I know it by heart, and most of all it's yummy! : ) I recommend it!

I have tried a number of different crepe recipes looking for the most tender, delicate and flavorful. This doesn't win that title. However, if you are new to crepe making and want to develop your cooking technique, give it a try. It is very durable and easy to work and most people will be impressed. Tip: To spend less time standing in front of a hot stove and more time at the table, use a 12 inch pan so you only have to make 5 (rather than 15 little) crepes. The Simply Calphalon 12 inch non-stick griddle works great as a crepe pan for under $20.

I have made this many times for friends and they love it, specially the sweet ones. It's very similar to the crepes I had when I was living in France. Try the Buckwheat variation for savory crepes. Best part about this recipe is this is really simple and allows you to get creative with it.

This is THE definitive recipe for crepes. No need to look any further! They are buttery, rich, and delicious. I made the full recipe and what we didn't eat I put in the freezer for later.
