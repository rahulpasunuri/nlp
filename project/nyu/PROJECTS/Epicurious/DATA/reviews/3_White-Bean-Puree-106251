This is a simple, tasty alternative to potatoes and is better for you. I add more garlic and use different kinds of beans (depending on what is availabe in the cupboard.) It is a fantastic side to lamb, but also goes well with a nice rib steak.

I do sometimes make this as an alternative to mashed potatoes with certain dishes. For example, it goes very well with the Braised Chicken with Garlic and White Wine, also on this site. At room temp it's also a good bread spread, very much like one that's offered instead of butter at one of our favorite mediterranean restaurants.

This is really delicious and quite different. The thyme is what makes it work. It's not a substitute for potatoes, though. Anyone looking for that will be disappointed. This was a great boon to a largely vegetarian Christmas dinner--a good way to add protein to a dinner full of vegetable side dishes.
