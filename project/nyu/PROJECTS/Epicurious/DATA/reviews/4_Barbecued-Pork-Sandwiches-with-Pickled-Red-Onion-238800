Big hit! Came out great just as recipe is written with only a slight reduction in the oil to 1/3 cup. Quick grilling time leaves more time for playing with the kids on Father's Day! Served with watermelon, corn on the cob and fresh slaw. The pickled red onions really make it and must not be skipped. Fresh rolls are also a key ingredient... munching on seconds now... yumm!

Great alternative for a cookout when you are burgered out. Made recipe as written but used regular kaiser rolls lightly grilled. Made for foodie company, they were impressed and requested the recipe.

This really is as amazing as the reviews suggest. I left the rub on over night and the flavor of the pork was exceptional. Thow in some crispy cibatta bread and it's near perfect.

Amazing. The next time I'd cut back on the olive oil in the sauce, or just add a little extra vinegar. But otherwise, truly wonderful. If you don't have onion rolls, chibatta bread works well too.

The vinaigrette is delicious. This is perfect for weeknights.

Great recipe - very easy to make. I served this for a wine tastig party and used silver dollar rolls for smaller portions. They were eaten up quickly - will make this recipe again!

Addendum: I made this again tonight, and because it's raining and grilling wasn't an option, roasted the tenderloin at 500 for about 18 minutes, turning it over on the baking pan after 9 minute or so. No onion rolls on hand, so we had it on toasted challah rolls. Awesome. Also, the vinaigrette doesn't need all that attention, pasting the garlic with the salt, coaxing in the olive oil... I used a small hand blender with no probs, and I'm sure it'd do just fine in a regular blender, too.

This recipe was a HUGE hit. I toasted the rolls and used leftover pickled onions from another recipe here on epi, but those were the only significant deviations from the recipe. The vinaigrette was fantastic, and the pepper & paprika spice rub were delish, and blackened beautifully where it rested against the grill. I'll definitely be making this again. Served it with a siple lettuce & tomato salad with mustard dressing and the balsamic sweet potatoes from this site. Killer Sunday afternoon meal!

Served this as patio meal to guests. Everyone raved. Pickled onions were a great addition; I normally don't like a lot of onion, but the boiling water took the aftertaste away and the pickling gave it a tang. It was a nice change from the usual burgers with the same old condiments. Even with the 'barbecutioner' overcooking the tenderloin, the flavor was great. Onion rolls added to the flavor as well. This one's a keeper.

Very good. Recipe was easy and a lot could be prepared ahead. Good if you are looking to cooking something different on the BBQ.

Good. My husband and kids liked it. However I thought the sauce was a bit too olive oily. Next time I'll double the ingred. except the oil. Also, didn't feel like grilling so I baked it at 350 for about 35 minutes after brushing a little of the sauce on it. Onion were a bit strange, though probably leave those out next time.Will make again.

Very good and a nice change from grilled burgers. Pork was very tender.

This recipe fell short of my expectations. I was expecting more of a pulled-pork flavour but it was actually rather bland. Next time, I will make the pickled onions without the "boiling water" trick and will just de-flame them under a rinse of cold water; they lost almost all their flavour in the boiling water.

I made this for Father's Day dinner and my husband and I were thrilled with the taste. Don't look at the onions and think they will be strong...it was the most surprising part of the meal. Soaking the onion in boiling water softened the taste so much, and the pickling was excellent. The onions were a subtle, sweet, absolute positive additon to the sandwich. Overall, this was easy to make and each part of it (meat, onion and vinagrette) added up to a delicious and unique sandwich. Really good!!

Easy, tasty and something different. My husband and I enjoyed these sandwiches and look forward to making them again. I did not have smoked paprika so used 1/2 regular paprika and 1/2 chipotle chile pepper instead. A green side salad with blue cheese dressing rounded out the meal.

We made these sandwiches last night. They were absolutely delicious! My husband loved them and wished we had more leftovers so he could have had them for lunch. I made the corn & cabbage slaw from the same issue to go with them. It was delicious as well and a great accompaniment. Wouldn't change a thing about either recipe. I LOVE the BBQ issue and this year's is no exception!
