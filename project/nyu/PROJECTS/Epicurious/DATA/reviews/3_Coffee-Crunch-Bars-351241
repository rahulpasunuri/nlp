I made the change of adding an egg to make it a little more like a brownie and I only cooked it for 25 minutes. Turned out great!

I have made these several times, AS IS and they are amazing. They are "coffee CRUNCH" bars, so expect them to be hard and crunchy. There was some butter residue in the pan afterward, but I think the amount of butter is necessary to carmelize the cookies and create a candy-like crunch. If you have a gas oven, decrease the cooking time by 5-10 min.

I'm not a novice baker but these were just a disaster: burnt, greasy...not worth making multiple times just to figure out what went wrong! I thought recipes in Bon Appetit were tested? Instead I felt like the guinea pig.

I reduced the butter to 1 cup and also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla along with the almond extract. I also added 1 egg, but don't think that was actually necessary. I baked it in an 8x12" baking dish at 325 for 40 minutes, and I wish I had left it in longer, but I let the other reviews scare me. It has a great flavor, though, and it was quick to make, so I am a fan.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut back on the butter and on the baking time. These bars are tasty, but too crunchy. Perhaps baked in a 9 X 9 pan, they would be softer with some crunch from the chips and the nuts. I will tyr this the next time, but there are other recipes with these flavors that are better.

WITH THE SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS. 1 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar. I added 1/4 cup cocoa nibs and 1/4 cup almonds instead of 1/2 almonds. Baked about 40 mins; it REALLY FIRMS UP AFTER COOLING so keep that in mind (high sugar content). They were popular at work; neat TOFFEE FLAVOUR from the brown sugar; kind of like a toffee latte; not amazing, though.

I'm with those who said they cooked faster than the stated amount of time. The dough spread out and the edges burned. Maybe a regular baking pan would be better. I don't think I will try these again. It was a waste of good ingredients.

Wow, these are fantastic -- but only with the following changes: 1 cup butter (or even 1 cup ls 1-2 tbsp.), no salt, 1 cup dark brown sugar, baked at 325 for 30 minutes, and not a minute longer. Totally perfect !! The first time I made these, they were almost burnt (45 minutes baking time), they were hard, and way too greasy. But I still liked the taste, so I thought I would make them one more time. With the changes above, these are real keepers.

Rating: 4
These are amazing! My friends and family love them! The other reviewers are correct-you need to tweak it slightly for best results. I've made them 4 times and finally got it down. Use less butter-I used 2 sticks minus a TBL. I also used 1 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup raw sugar (it gave it a little extra cruch and mellowed it out). Also, vanilla extract is better and I used 1 tsp. I hope you love this recipe as much as i did. happy baking!

I tried this recipe twice. The first batch tasted burnt. With the next batch, I reduced the cooking time, but it didn't help that much. The bars were very hard and the flavor was mediocre- a huge disappointment after the great article. However, we found that they taste great when crushed up and used as a topping on Mexican Vanilla ice cream.

Rating: 1
Well, these were crunchy, tasted of coffee, and were bars. That's about all one can say about this recipe. Reducing the butter and the cooking time might help somewhat. But, I wouldn't bet on it. A disappointing use of perfectly good ingredients. Not going to bother with this again. This tastes like an unfortunate cross between badly made biscotti and burnt brownies with the virtues of neither.

SECOND TIME AROUND,USED ONLY THE 1 CUP OF VEGANMARGARINE, NEXT TIME EVEN LESS.WITH I CUP BROWN SUGAR. THEY ARE A BIT DIFFICULT TO CUT AFTER ONLY 1 MINUTE OF COOL DOWN IN PAN BUT THE END RESULT WAS FAVORABLY REVIEWED, AGAIN, BY THE VEGANS IN MY LIFE.

I wish that I had read the reviews first...but made this recipe straight from the promising article. These cookies were far too greasy. I believe the extra 2 tablespoons of butter pushed it over the top. And like many other reviews stated, the cooking time was too long (and I cooked them 40 minutes). The flavor is ok - probably much better if not overcooked - but not worth making again, unfortunately.

This recipe is fairly good. It's not amazing. The almond extract is a little bit overwhelming. I would try it with a high quality vanilla extract instead as that would help it taste a little bit like a vanilla latte rather than a strangely over-almond flavor.

I have now made this recipe 5 times... I make it according to the recipe and the difference I've found is a result of the baking times. Like many other reviewers I found that the time given in the recipe is far too long to achieve the desired results. 25-30 min seems to do it in my oven. And if you look at the photo you will see they have cut away all the cookies along the edges. In my case that's because those on the edge always burn and I throw them away. Still and all we LOVE these cookies - provided they are not baked too long...

Cut recipe in 1/2 and baked in 9x9 pan for 25 mintues. Followed original recipe which the only diff is 1/2 c brown sugar & 1/2 cup turbinado and only 2 sticks butter. Good, but I prefer a more subtle coffee flavor. Day 2 they were chewy not hard.

I DID NOT make the recipe that is shown here on epicurious - i made the ORIGINAL recipe from the creator that is given on the bon appetit website in the "Comments" section of the recipe (i believe it is also listed here in this comments section). The Whole Foods near me had the dark muscovado sugar but i couldn't find instant espresso powder so i finely ground espresso beans at whole foods. I can't believe the bon appetit editors changed the recipe to be a 45 MINUTE cooking time! that is ridiculous (eventhough they added extra butter and sugar (which acts like a liquid when baked)). these were DEFINITELY done at 25 minutes. I patted the dough into a 12x12 inch square in a baking pan and used tin foil folded up to get a flat side. When they are done, they do get crunchy so don't expect one of those soft cookies. I guess if you made them in a smaller size - like 9 x 12 and still cook for 25 minutes they would be softer in the middle. I might try that next time since i do like mine a little soft in the middle. These are strangely addicting though.

I made these exactly as written except for vegan margarine instead of butter. I am always looking for Vegan recipes for my children. Checked them at 30 minutes and they were getting dark tan...so I took them out of the oven. Cooled, cut,cooled..they were very hard but that did not stop my family from devouring them. They loved the flavor.Next time I might use less sugar and cook for 20 to 25 minutes. The few left over are in an airtight container.

I made these hoping for the amazing outcome described in the article, will try one more time, but was dissapointed. Baked for 25 minutes, may take out at 20 next time. Flavor ok, but boy they do get hard on day two! Patted into a 10x15 jelly roll pan, but only to about 13x10, used dark brown sugar, and 1 tsp almond extract.

i agree with the cooking times - baked them for about 45 minutes, actually could have reduced the time even more. They were good, but could have been a little better.

I made this recipe as written. The cookies were soft enough to cut after sitting for 1 minute and hardened while cooling, although not into the rocks described by some here. I think that those having problems have ovens that may not be properly calibrated, resulting in overcooked bars. I think these are fantastic and perfectly cooked at 45 minutes.

This recipe is a winner! The taste and texture, both crunchy and melt in your mouth (probably because of all that butter), are devine.I bake goodies all the time, (much to the delight of family and friends), and I can't wait to make this one for them. I'm certain that this is going to one of their favorites.

Just made these using the recipe from the comments section at Bon Apetit. They are fantastic, but I can see how they would be hard and overcooked if they were baked for such a long time. Mine were in for exactly 25 mins. and I shaped them into a 10" x 12" rectangle. I will make these again for sure. Great coffee flavour and so buttery! Here's the recipe I followed... Coffee Crunch Bars Adapted from Leah Reich and her grandmother, Mamie Chaiffetz 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1/4 tsp. salt 8 oz. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup tightly packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup tightly packed dark muscovado sugar 1/2 tsp. almond extract 2 Tbsp. instant espresso or instant coffee 1/2 cup sliced almonds 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In another medium bowl, cream the butter and sugars with an electric mixer, beating until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the almond extract and instant espresso, and beat 1 minute more. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture in three doses, mixing until just absorbed. Stir in the almonds and chocolate chips. The dough will be thick. Turn the dough out onto an ungreased (approximately 12-inch x 17-inch) rimmed baking sheet. Using your hands, press the dough evenly into a 12-inch by 12-inch square. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the edges are browned and the top looks set. Cool in the pan for 1 minute; then, while still hot, cut into 24 (2-inch by 3-inch) bars. Transfer immediately to wire rack to cool completely. Bars will crisp as they cool. Note: Bars will keep, sealed in an airtight container at room temperature, for up to 5 days. Their flavor improves with time. Yield: 24 bars

The original recipe produced cookies that were simply too hard to bite/chew/eat. It seemed there was too much sugar and the cookies carmelized in the pan. The solution is to use a slightly heaping 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. I used a small cookie scoop and made the cookies in mini muffin pans. They only need to cook for about 15 minutes - crisp on the edges and soft in the middle. They are wonderful! To make them even better, leave out the chocolate chips and add a couple of tablespoons cocoa. Now they ARE totally addictive.

Like many others, I felt the original recipe was a disaster because the cookies were simply too hard to eat. Even my coworkers (who snap down anything) did not eat them. HOWEVER, I did think that the taste was unusual and worth another try. See next post for my solution.

I did it! I've been wanting to make this recipe since seeing it in the magazine but with all the negative reviews, I was really hesitant. I followed the directions almost exactly but used 3/4 c light brown sugar and 1/2 c dark. Instead of making the 12 inch square, I put the dough into an 8x11 inch pan so they were a bit thicker. I sprinkled the top with coarse sugar to give a little crunch. I baked them for 30 minutes. When I took them out of the oven, the edges were firm and the top was set but the middle was still quite gooey. Then end result is fabulous. The exterior is very crunchy but the middle is soft and chewy. The sugar on top gives a nice added texture. To those who ended up with a hard as a rock result, try doing it this way. I hope you'll be pleased. I'll definitely make them again.

Rating: 4
WOW! I was a little nervous to make these, given the turbulent reviews, but now I'm so happy that I went ahead and did it! I was particularly nervous as I mixed the dry ingredients into the dough - the final texture is a bit like wet sand. I had an immediate flashback to my worst baking experience ever with "World Peace Cookies" - the dough on these had the same texture......I did line my pan with a sheet of parchment, figuring that it would help me to get the cookies out quickly - and it did! I patted my dough into aprox a 10 inch by 12 inch rectangle - it was the best I could do. Poking the tines of the fork in the dough was a bit strange - I kept spearing and dislodging chocolate chips......I have a Porcini and Wine Potroast cooking in my perfect oven, so I was forced to use the second oven that is tough to keep at temp - I believe this resulted in my cookies baking at slightly less than 325 - but they did bake for 45 minutes. I took them out - gave them a minute before rolling across them with a pizza cutter, and put them on the rack to cool. My first impression is that I'm in heaven! I love the toffee texture and the slightly rich taste of the almond extract combined with the coffee....Really great cookie! Don't be afraid - try them!!!!!!!

WOW! I am surprised that so many people disliked these bars so intently. They were pretty buttery/greasy, I will admit. I didn't do a 12x12, but i decided to make them thicker. probably about 3/4 in. I'm not sure how big the pan was because it was an odd size and not even mine (I made them at a friends house). I cooked them longer than the directions called for. I used ghiradelli chips which are pretty big so I think next time i will either go sans chips or use the minis. they only need a hint of the chocolate, if any at all. All-in-all, these were really delicious. Everyone loved them; for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.

When I read the article, I was so excited to try these! Then, once I read all the mixed reviews, I wanted so badly to try and have them be great, but they're not! The flavors seem muddled to me, and I really don't like the hard texture. I think I'll use the dark brown sugar and espresso idea, and play with making a gooey bar... And no chocolate, it's just not the right flavor here. Anyone had any success making the coffee/toffee flavor in a soft brownie like bar?

My 4 "fork" review is for Molly's original recipe, which has been posted over at www.bonappetit.com under the comments portion of the When Coffee Goes Crunch article. The test kitchen at BA tested the recipe, as they always do, but changed it quite a bit from her original recipe, including adding extra butter and doubling the cooking time. I made Molly's original recipe and absolutely loved them. I'm not normally a hard cookie person, but these are delicious, and the flavors are incredible. I hope anyone who made this version and hated it will give her recipe a shot. They're worth it.

I couldn't wait to make these bars after reading the article. I am a baker and love recipes like these. Unfortunately, I thought these were awful. I was sure I must have done something wrong so I read the reviews. I took them out of the oven early b/c my husband was yelling that something was burning. I put them out for a super bowl party and ended up throwing them away b/c no one ate them. I would never make these again. The reviews though have been entertaining much more so than the bars. No forks for this one

Awful. I got excited because the ingredients sound good but it was all a total waste. The cookies smell good, but they become a strange combination of greasy, chewy (not in a good way, in a way that sticks to your teeth), and oily. I don't usually write reviews but had to tell people not to waste their time.

I mixed the dough for these bars following the recipe precisely, and pressed the dough into a 12-inch square on my largest rimmed baking sheet. After about 15 minutes in the oven I noticed a distinct "burnt sugar" smell coming from the oven, so I ran to my computer and looked up the reviews of this recipe, and I am so glad I did! I ended up pulling them out of the oven after they had baked for about 27 minutes. I went ahead and cut them right away, and cooled them on racks. Once cool, these bars are a little bit crispy/crunchy on the outside and chewy and moist on the inside. The toffee flavor as described by the author is present, and there is just a whisper of almond and espresso flavor in the background. Very yummy! However, if I had left them in the oven any longer than I did I think they would have turned quite burnt and bitter.

Rating: 1
As many have stated, these ended up tasting burnt. In fact, I couldn't taste anything else. I can't imagine with soooo many people getting this same result, that the recipe could be accurate? I ended up throwing mine away as well. Are these recipes not tried out in some way before they are published? It's disappointing that you would publish such a horrible recipe!!!!!!! When readers view your magazine, it's expected that the recipes are at least edible! I wouldn't even rate this 1 fork....

I have to agree with many of the comments here. These were not good AT ALL, and I really wanted them to be because the editorial was so beautiful.

I just made these. The only changes I made is that I used white chocolate chips, a touch more almond extract (you definately want almond, not vanilla extract) and after reading the reviews, I baked them for 30 minutes. They were incredible and I had all the experiences in the article - the dough was wonderful, the smell incredible and I could hardly wait to eat them all.

I'm so mad I made this recipe. I used slightly less butter than called for, and it is a greasy mess. Once I'd lifted the cookies off the baking sheet, there were just pools of grease underneath. Gross. The taste was okay - I didn't have almond extract on hand - so used vanilla extract, which may not have helped the taste. And what kind of strange directions is that to create a 12x12 square on a rimmed cookie sheet? I think she may have called these 'the best cookies' or something like that. Uh, no thanks.

Great squares - very complicated flavours. I used ordinary instant coffee & made them in a 9 x 13 rectangular cake pan & they turned out great.

I just made this very controversial cookies after reading the reviews. I was also seduced by the article. They are delicious, albeit greasy. The almond extract is clutch, do not substitute vanilla, if possible. I was also confused by the 12 x 12 square of dough direction... I blindly followed orders and formed a square on my 12 x 15 (or whatever the average sheet size is) baking sheet. It spread to one side more than the other, the cookies were of uneven thickness. Thinner ones were better. I reduced baking time to 30 - 35 minutes. I will make them again, but next time I will cover the entire baking sheet with a thin layer of dough, and bake for 30 - 35 minutes. Great flavors.

Rating: 3
It is definitely flawed. Really wonder how the test kitchen did it at 45-50mins unless they used a perfectly 12X12" pan, which directions do not state. Has great potential. Shorter bake time should help. I used parchment paper. I may try using cocoa instead of choco chips or both to some degree.

Rating: 2
While my coffee crunch bars were in the oven, I decided to check the reviews. And thank goodness for that.. I followed everyone's advice and cooked the cookies for around 30 minutes versus 45 to 50 minutes called for. The cookies harden a lot out of the oven. I can't stress that enough! Also -- there's confusion over the size of the pan. The recipe says to put into a 12-inch square?? Who has a baking sheet that's a 12-inch square? The cookies are good, although very greasy (the accompanying article is better than the cookies). I gave the recipe 2 stars because the recipe is clearly flawed. I am not sure I will be making any future recipes from the author.

These cookies were delicious and quite a hit at the party I took them to last night. A couple of suggestions. Use a 10x15 rimmed baking sheet and press the dough to within about a half inch of the edge. It will spread but not be too thick at the edge. This is about the same area as a 12x12 square but a much more common size of pan. The baking time in the recipe is too long; about 30-35 minutes should be about right. Test by touching lightly; it should just spring back. I cut them in the pan with a pizza cutter, which was very quick and easy, but you need to leave them in the pan for about 4-5 minutes or they are too soft to get out without falling apart. I let them cool on paper towels spread over newspaper, which absorbed some of the fat. I used 1 T. instant espresso and 1 T. cocoa because some of the guests last night are not big coffee fans. I would definitely make these again.

I loved the article and the cookies! I couldn't stop nibbling on them as they cooled. I loved the crunchy, grainy texture and they were as I imagined them to be. I followed the recipe exactly, except that my oven runs hot and I was prepared to take the cookies out before the recommended time. I baked them for about 35 minutes and they were perfect. I will be making these again and again. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I am always looking for something new to add to my repetoire of sweets...This was a hit! I had to make a couple of modifications due to pantry availability and they are as follows: used instant folgers instant coffee instead of espresso, used vanilla extract and eliminated the almonds due to a tree nut allergy in the house. I also, after having read all the previous reviews, limited the cooking time to 35 mins and was happy with the results. I am a soft cookie fan but I really liked these ingredients. I guess the lack of eggs makes the texture crunchy rather than softer and possibly chewy. All the kids liked them including my husband.

I also made these immediately after reading the article and I'm glad I did. This is a keeper! The deep flavor of the chocolate, coffee with the crunch is addictive. I didn't have any issue with the dough, but I did make it more like a 10x10 square which made them a little thicker. Baked them for only 40 minutes. My husband and office loved them.

Both my husband and I loved these bars. Although, I have to admit I changed the recipe a little. I substituted cold pressed coconut oil for butter and vanilla sugar for brown sugar. The dough turned out to be like sand. I used latex gloves to press it to the sheet (which helped me to work very fast) Cooked it for 45 minutes at 325F. The whole house smelled heavenly during the baking time. They turn out to be crunchy but not as hard as some described. I will definitely make them again and again.

These bars were delicious. I had to modify it a bit because I was out of the coffee and the dark brown sugar. I substituted high quality cocoa for the coffee and light brown sugar for the dark brown. The result was phenomenal. I also took them out after 30, not 35, minutes. I cut them immediately and let them cool on racks. Crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I guess I cannot call them "coffee" crunch since I omitted the coffee but maybe chocolate crunch bars.

The flavor on these is delicious, although I burned my slightly. They were overdone after 35 minutes in a 300 degree convection oven. Next time I would take them out as soon as I smell them. The texture is interesting, sort of chewy/crunchy. I will make them again with less baking time.

I have to say that the story that went along with these cookies was much better than the cookies themselves. I followed the recipe exactly and while the flavor was good, the texture was not. Yes, I know they have the name crunch in the title but these were hard as a rock. Very difficult to spread as well. Maybe they needed less baking time? Gave them 2 forks because of the excellent flavor though.

I made these cookies before reading any reviews, so I followed the recipe just as written. I thought they were very good. My husband and friends liked them as well. I am actually surpised at how negative some of the reviews are. Yes, they are crunchy but they are called coffee crunch bars after all!

After reading the wonderful article and noting the gorgeous picture, I was very excited to make these. But my results were less than I expected and I event emailed the author on bonapetit.com (no response). I followed the recipe TO THE LETTER and scooped flour into the measuring cup with a separate spoon. I had a very difficult time getting the dough into a good even shape. It was extreamly sandy and I was touching it so much that I was melting the butter! The tastes itself was lovely, a very sophistiated flavor and the almond extract and crunchy bits of almond were very nice. But the bars were uneven, crunchy and HARD on the bottom and crumbly on the top. If I try again, I will reduce the flour a bit and use a 8x8 pan to get a nice square shape. Oh well.

The name says it all; there is a strong coffee flavor with hints of butterscotch. The cookies was falling apart soft when they first came out of the oven and 30 minutes later, they were very crunchy. I enjoyed the cookies a lot, as did my co-workers. They are easy to make and would be an excellent accompaniment to a cup of coffee.

I agree with "A Cook from los gatos", the story is much better than the cookies. I took them to a New Year's Eve party where no one touched them. They were just too bitter from the espresso powder and too hard. I've been eating them with my morning coffee but only to get rid of them. Don't waste your time or ingredients on this one!

What a great story! I had to make these. I just sampled a bar still warm from the oven. Yum! Moist, sweet, and almondy. I didn't like that it told you to shape it into a 12' square, so I doubled the recipe and it filled the entire jelly-roll pan I used. It ended up thicker (the edges rose above the rim) and a bit more chewy than crunchy. I had hoped that by doubling the recipe I would end up with more cookies. The recipe said you would get 50 something cookies, but thats how many I ended up with even with the doubled recipe. They may not be the best cookies I ever ate, but I really can't think of a better one right now!

I was nervous about making these after looking at the mixed reviews, but I'm glad to report that I love these bars! They're delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, even the baking time (45 min), except I spread the dough a tiny bit thicker, making an 11.5" square instead of 12". The brand of instant espresso powder ( Iused Medaglia D'oro) might make a difference in the results, in reference to the comment about the bars being bitter- did you use actual espresso or instant espresso powder? Overall these are a huge hit and so easy to make. I will certainly be making them again!

I, like other reviewers, was sold by the article, and excited to make these cookies. I substituted vanilla for almond extract, but otherwise made as written. I thought the flavor was fabulous but the texture wasn't--a little too crunchy. Great crumbled over ice cream but a bit much on their own. I did find that the edge pieces (which were slightly thinner, and more cooked) had a better texture--still crispy but less HARD. I'd make again, but I'd spread the dough much thinner and cut into very small pieces.

i realize these are supposed to be crunchy but i actually think these are truly HARD - like "break your teeth" hard. my husband liked them but they did not go over well at the hospital i am on staff at - i even saw some in the trash. i won't make these again.

My husband and I loved these! I baked them for 45 minutes, put in about 2/3s of the espresso and put in vanilla instead of the almond extract. I love crunchy so they worked for me. Don't bother if you are a gooey dessert lover!

Beautifully written piece...I made the bars right after reading it. Unfortunately the story is better than the cookies. Very crunchy and a little bitter due to baking. I probably won't make them again but if I were too I would definitely reduce the baking time and perhaps some of the espresso powder.

Meh. They're fine, but by no means are they "the best cookie I've ever tasted" the author promises.

I thought these were great and loved the story about how the recipe came about. I did not cook them for as long as recipe stated though. I think I took them out after 35 or 40 minutes. I forgot to set my timer so not sure but think 50 minutes would be way too long. Also, I wonder if some people measure flour wrong and get too much. You should never scoop the flour out, instead use a spoon to fill your measuring cup. Possibly, this is why some people didn't like the recipe. My husband and daughter love them.

I had already made the batter before I read the reviews and was nervous about the results. I am relieved to note that they were very good, and had the nice amount of crunch and toffee flavor. Definitely take them out 15 minutes earlier than the recipe states, as a previous reviewer notes. They really crisp up once they are on the cooling rack. I'm not a coffee person at all, but was surprised that I liked them as much as I did.

Not being a coffee kind of gal, I substituted cocoa powder for espresso powder and vanilla for almond extract. They were delicious and made a fantastic mid-winter pick-me-up. I loved these!

I loved the story accompanying this recipe and could not wait to make the bars. The result was very disappointing. I would not make this recipe again. I actually was looking online to see if perhaps an ingredient or two was missing from the magazine recipe. Very hard, very crunchy, very disappointing.

I thought I'd found my new favorite cookie while I was making these. The dough was yummy but the finished product was way too crunchy (removed from the oven 15 min before the suggested time). I won't make these again.

I made these bars for friends and everyone loved them! Highly recommend. I loved how crisp they were. I will be making these again. Terrific flavor.

After reading the article that accompanied this recipe I was convinced this was the best dessert ever. I am so disappointed that I wasted my time and ingredients. The bars are horrible. My friend, daughter and husband spit them out. My husband would not take these to work because he didn't want anyone to know I made them. He said, "I don't want anyone to think you are a horrible cook". Don't waste your time on these bars.
