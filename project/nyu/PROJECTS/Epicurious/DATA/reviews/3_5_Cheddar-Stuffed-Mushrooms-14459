My first experience with these mushrooms was during a family gathering. Not a big meat eater, I snarled at them, thinking they were full of sausage. My mother persisted, I tried, and she shared the recipe, which was featured in a tiny 2004 cookbook from an insurance agency in New Mexico. I later found the recipe here, as also featured years ago in Gourmet. The stuffed mushrooms are so easy to make, and the best part is they can be made ahead of time and then popped into the refrigerator until baking time. Though I made them exactly as the recipe called, personal tastes dictated just a tiny bit more salt, and sadly, I only had dried parsley, but they were absolutely delicious. For the bread crumbs, I used Progresso brand. Fabulous. I would be willing to try the Worcestershire sauce and addition of garlic as others suggested. To fill the mushrooms, a pastry decorator tube comes in so handy, and even forms a nifty looking top for the mushrooms, which should be filled with a bump of filling above the caps. Would definitely make again, and absolutely serve to guests. Thank you!

Made these for New Year's Eve. I forgot walnuts but didn't miss them. Delicious!

Easy, delicious, different than the usual stuffed mushrooms. I followed the advice of many and added some Worcestershire sauce- needed it. Will make again!

I used a 14oz pack of stuffer mushrooms and omitted the brushing with butter as per other reviewers (they're rich enough with the cheese and nuts!). These were delicious. A guest who hates mushrooms enjoyed them. They are also surprisingly filling. I'm eager to make them again!

Definitely the loser in the array of hors d'oeurvres for our 8th Annual Progressive NYE dinner. I used a blend of toasted walnuts and pine nuts and a blend of parmesan,asiago,romano and provolone. They were a bit soggy and didn't have much flavor other than baked mushroom. I did omit the brushing with melted butter which may have been a mistake but I don't think it would have made the difference. The leftover filling did make a good addition to some lasagne I made a couple of days later, so all was not lost!!

Absolutely delicious and easy. I used panko bread crumbs as I like their crunch. Got rave reviews.

These were really good. I added some worcestershire sauce, which tasted good. Next time, I might add more salt or hot sauce or try a sharper cheddar to give the flavor a boost.

I have made these mushrooms many times for quite a few years now. I always get rave reviews when I make them. I follow the recipe, except I add a few drops of worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. I also top them with cheddar right before baking. I love them, this is the best stuffed mushroom recipe I have found.

I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 parmeasan as suggested. Also used packaged stuffing mix(Pepperidge Farm chicken flavored) added garlic and a touch of tarragon. Really good and easy!

I made these mushrooms to accompany filet this weekend and they were a huge hit. I took the advice of previous reviewers and I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese. I also ground up caesar salad croutons in place of the bread crumbs. I used fairly large stuffer mushrooms and found that I didnt have any stuffing left over. This recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 3
Excellent, easy-to-prepare recipe. I agree with others that have omitted brushing the caps with melted butter; it is a time-consuming step that is of little consequence to the finished dish. Even friends who claim to not like mushrooms have raved about these.

I made this for a party and it was excellent and seems healthier than recipes that use sausage. I did find it a but bland at frst so I added 1 tbspn of Worstershire sauce. Once I did that it was great. Even my mother loved it and she hates mushrooms!

This is a real winner! I made this twice so far and gotten RAVE reviews all around (and I was feeding 7 very picky men.) Here is a tip for the chef that is short on time: use Stove Top stuffing and forget the onion. I have made this exactly as the recipe says and again with a little impromptu help from Stove Top and the mushrooms came out delicious both times! Excellent for parties and as appetizers. I will most certainly be making this many times again!

I made this for a friend's party this weekend and everyone loved it. I took the advice of a couple of others and added a clove or 2 of garlic. I also used a SMOKED cheddar as opposed to a sharp cheddar. Instead of a regular onion I used a bunch of green onions and sauteed those with the garlic and mushroom stems. I also found the mixture to be a bit dry so I added about a cup of water. Very good. Easy to make, and quite tasty.

I've made this twice now to rave reviews from guests. My only change to the recipe was to saute garlic with the onions and to add parmesan (eliminating an equal amount of cheddar).

Very tasty! I actually made mine a day ahead and they were wonderful. I brushed them with white wine & butter

just an afterthought....what would these taste like with all the same ingredients, but gorg

have made these before and loved them, but this time added one clove chopped garlic to saute and 1/2 parm cheese as suggested...and now even better...make sure to use real parm and a good sharp cheddar...makes the world of difference...having made these in past the cheese adds loads of flavor

I added a teaspoon of garlic, a teaspoon of olive oil and fresh ground pepper while sauteeing the stuffing. I loved the way they turned out and were a big hit at the dinner party I attended.

These disappeared in seconds. Outstanding flavor. Would double the entire recipe to satisfy guests' love for them.

Spectacular!! Substituted 1/2 parmesean in for 1/2 of the cheddar and almonds for walnuts. The most popular dish out of rack of lamb, creme brule, and a cheese and broccili creation. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

Rating: 2
Not bad, and they did get eaten, but they were just strange. Perhaps Parmesan cheese would be better than the cheddar. There was way too much butter; I ended up turning the mushroom stem and onion mixture out onto a pile of paper towels to drain after they were cooked. The mushroom caps did not need to be brushed with butter, either. I much prefer to stuff the caps with a pickled jalapeno slice and fill the cap with cream cheese, and bake. Drippy, but wonderful.

Just had a party and these were the first to go. Delicious! I loved the addition of the nuts. Very easy to make.

I had never made stuffed mushrooms before, but these were easy and delicious, although somewhat time consuming. I improvised a little, based on other cooks' suggestions: I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 1 chicken/sun dried tomato/basil sausage, and about 1/3 cup of crushed croutons. I also cut the butter to about 2 tablespoons to keep the fat down, used a reduced fat cheese, and omitted the parsley. They were wonderful, and I will definitely make them again!

These are delicious! I have made these several times now and you just simply cannot go wrong with this recipe! Delicious and easy! Made recipe as is the first time ... delicious ... second time I spiced it up as per suggestions of previous reviewers! Substituted pecans for walnuts (walnuts were fine - just a change to pecans), added lots more cheese, more salt, added garlic to the saute mixture, and brushed the caps with wine! Have also tried them without the bread crumbs and a bit of crumbled pork sausage ... yum! You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

These were a big hit at the New Year's Eve dinner party we attended, where they were served as the first course. I tweaked the recipe by adding one cup crabmeat, 1 1/2 tsp Worchestershire sauce, and a bit more salt. I agree that using butter is a must, as it enhanced the flavor of the mushrooms considerably. The guests at our party clamored for more!

This was a huge hit for New Years Eve. Next time I would add 2 tbl. less of butter and substitute with white wine. I'd also add a couple less Tbl. of bread crumbs. Very simple and tasty with huge reviews.

These were very tasty. I added worchester sauce and a clove of chopped garlic as someone suggested (good ideas both). Also way more salt. This is a great recipe for tinkering. Lots of possibilities. Will keep this one around for future. We had extra filling, so saved it and used it again the next night with no loss of flavor. Used olive oil instead of melted butter on night two and it was not as good as the butter. Stick with the butter.

Great recipe, very easy. It's a great basic recipe for stuffed mushrooms. I've played with this and used artichokes instead of walnuts and then replaced some of the butter with sour cream. It also worked great.

Really good. Used pecans instead. These are a really nice departure from the usual stuffed shrooms. Nothing to not like here.

I used portabellos ( which together weighed one and a half pounds, and increased the filling by 50%. They came out very nice. Good vegie main course.

I have made this recipe 3 times now, and each time all of the mushrooms were gone within 10 minutes. Everyone loved them! This is definitely one of my favorites. I also add garlic, worcestershire sauce, and lots more cheese.

I am not a real nut lover, especially walnuts, but my husband is. To satisfy us both, I used macadamia nuts instead of the walnuts. They were wonderful, a nice change from the typical sausage or seafood stuffing.

I served these mushrooms as a side to beef tenderloin along with garlic & herb mashed potatoes and asparagus with parmesan butter (also from this site) and they were delicious. My dinner guests raved! As was suggested in previous reviews, I added worcestershire as well as a little bacon and used pine nuts instead of walnuts. This is an easy recipe that you really can't mess up!

My boyfriend's brother-in-law made these and they were so good - they flew off the plate! I tried at home with parmesean cheese (out of cheddar) and they did not taste nearly as good. Overall, mine were dry - any suggestions? Or do you just have to practice with these?

I left out the nuts both times I have made this dish and don't feel like I'm missing anything. I've also substituted with soy cheese and soy butter, which also makes a tasty dish. Everyone who's tried this when I've made it, loves it. Its a staple.

Squishy and boring. No pizzaz. I added the extra items others suggested (wine, worchestershire, more cheese, garlic, seasoned bread crumbs, etc.) - but still no zip.

I'm giving this 3 forks rather than 4 because I think it is necessary to jazz this up, as indicated by previous reviews. I used 2 14 oz. containers of large mushrooms for a total of 16. I basically doubled ingredients. Here are my changes: 3 shallots and 1 small onion; roasted pecans instead of walnuts; 10 garlic cloves; added chardonnay to the cooked mixture and reduced; added a little worchestershire sauce; used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs; added about 1 cup of fresh grated parmesan; put some buttered bread crumbs on top; added some shredded parmesan to top the last 2 minutes. Had lots of stuffing left, mushrooms were great, very flavorful, assembled and then cooked the next day. Only took 12 minutes to cook mine.

These were great. I did what was suggested and added a little white wine and whistershire; and I mixed extra bread crumbs with melted butter and sprinkled on top.

This was a popular choice among my friends and relatives. Instead of cheddar, smoked gouda works nicely. Also, I used sliced almonds, cooking them in a little sherry and butter before adding to the mixture. Use chives instead of parsley for this alternative combination!

Great tasting, and it doesn't get any easier than throwing the ingredients in a food processor. Everyone is so impressed when you stuff a mushroom!

My boyfriend loves it and is always thrilled when I make it. I have made it several times and each time just a little bit different. Once, I added finely chopped shrimp, cutting down on the mushrooms, another time a blend of Italian cheeses. I always use seasoned bread crumbs. I've yet to add the nuts as it's something I don't keep on hand but all the other ingredients I do so I can whip it up. Went well with champagne New Years Eve. This is something for the upcoming Superbowl.

I have made this several times. It always turns out well. I prepared it for guests the first time and the mushrooms were all gone within minutes. The second time I didn't have parsley so I added pesto instead. It turned out well, too.

I absolutely adore this recipe. I've made them several times before, and I'll be making them again for my family this Thanksgiving. Only this time, I'll be adding some minced ground-hog meat if daddy aims his rifle korrect and gits that sun a gun that's been raidin' through the garden.

These definitely need to be spiced up a bit. I added two cloves of minced garlic in with the onions and also added the worcestershire & a splash of sherry & lots of extra cheese. After seasoning with salt and pepper they still needed something to perk them up so I added a dash of Tabasco. Finally they came alive.

still not as good as grand-dad used to make, but still very tasty. My dinner guests ate them up fast. I too added bacon, which helped give them some zing. Another idea is to add a bit of worstershire sauce to each mushroom.

My guests loved this appetizer! My picky husband raved about them. I might add some more cheese the next time, as I didn't really taste the cheese flavor in them.

For the filling, I used extra sharp cheddar and seasoned dried breadcrumbs as well as a splash of sherry. I also sprinkled the mushrooms with some extra crumbs mixed with a little melted butter before baking. The mushrooms were delicious and extremely well received, and several people told me they were the best stuffed mushrooms they ever had. Warning -- as with all stuffed mushrooms, these will look more attractive if you sprinkle with chopped parsley befroe serving (I also sprinkled a little extra grated cheddar).
