Good-I served with the grilled porterhouse steaks and people really liked the extra kick it gave the meat.

This is very good with a variety of meats. Use the leftovers on sandwichs. With a food processor, if you can find the olives already pitted, it is not that much work and it is actually better when done a day or so ahead of time.
