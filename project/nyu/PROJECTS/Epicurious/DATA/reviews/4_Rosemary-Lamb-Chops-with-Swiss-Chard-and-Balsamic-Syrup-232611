I made it exactly as the recipe said (barely a beginner chef here but a ridiculously picky eater) and it was spectacular. quick, easy and uncomplicated even for me, yet it came out looking and tasting like the most sophisticated of dishes. the family was flabbergasted. my husband fell in love with me all over again :) Will be making this over and over again. it's so fast and good it would be great to serve at a dinner party. oh and the balsamic reduction is PURE HEAVEN! Thank you Epicurious - what a great site and my go-to every time.

Very tasty. If you are broiling the chops,do is as individual pieces and not as rack (even with that,you may need more than 3 min per side). Will definitely do this again and recommend this recipe

This is great. I use the chard recipe for any dark greens. I added some (1/4 cup) dried cranberries) plus 1 T. port or you could use Vermouth to add a touch of sweet. One of my my favorites.

This was delicious. Our CSA box contained a mix of greens this week so I used those. I also grilled the lamb vs broiling so I added some mustard, horseradish and white wine to the lamb rub so it would withstand the grill. Delicious!

I was surprised how REALLY GREAT this was! Simple to prepare, yet delish!! I would serve this to company proudly.The balsamic syrup heightened the flavours, and the chard and lamb were very complementary together. I only cooked the chard for 4 minutes and it was perfect.

THIS WAS AMAZING. I used very high quality balsamic vinegar (from oliver & co) and that makes all the difference. I also substituted spinach greens for the swiss chard and added a bit of white wine to the greens saute. Served alongside mashed potatoes. This is definitely a keeper recipe and I love that it is quick and doesn't require extensive marinating.

My boyfriend made this for me a few days ago, and it was delicious. He used one of the previous suggestions of using more garlic and onion when sauteeing the chard, but otherwise followed the recipe as shown. The lamb was tender and juicy. The swiss chard was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. We will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve. I almost did not make the swiss Chard because of some of the reviews, however it was the best part! I will now make swiss chard more often with other meals. I added a bit more red onion and a lot of garlic than the recipe called for and it was delicious. I think I will make it again tonight in fact. The lamb lacked taste (even though I bought the lamb from Whole Foods). I would make it again but maybe let the lamb marinate in the garlic, rosemary mixture for a few hrs before cooking. I also made couscous with this recipe. Worth making, if the lamb was tastier I'd give it 4 forks.

The Lamb chops with the Balsemec reduction were very good but... The greens could have been done much better! Possibilities include almost any green from any plant including Beets with some Beacon, salt and vinigar this could have been over the top. As it sits, it was only mediocre. The chops were good, the greens just didn't get the family vote. We do "The dinner"every Friday and ask for a vote on the spread in catagory's, Do we do it again? Often Once a year. Never. The chops got do it again, The rest got "Don't bother". Just telling you the family results. Bud

Delicious. We grilled the lamb as a rack, then served each guest two chops over fresh corn polenta (from this site) and the chard. We used rainbow chard from the farmers market. The meat itself has lots of flavor, so only a small amount of sauce is needed, even with the polenta. Impressive on the plate.

Swiss chard and rosemary grow well in my garden so this recipe is perfect. I've served this twice to rave reviews both times. The balsamic syrup really makes this dish.

Let me start by saying I have never heard of Swiss Chard and was a little afraid I wouldn't have been able to find it at a local supermarket like Stop and Shop. Lucky for me it was available. I see a lot of people losing the Swiss Chard for something else. I would follow the recipe at least for the first time because I think you will be presently surprised like I was. This was an amazing dish and the only issue I had was preparing the syrup first since it got really thick by the time the lamb was ready. But you can cover up the syrup and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds for it to melt a little bit. This is my new favorite dish.

I made this recipe this evening and (as always) I put my own spin on it by adding a little more red onion and garlic and adjusting the seasonings a bit. I can say that after tweaking it as I did, the recipe came out perfect and I even posted a pic of it to my Facebook page (of course giving credit and saying 'Courtesy of Epicurious') so friends could see. Anyway great recipe...the family loved it and will likely make it again soon.

Skipped the chard for a late, late dinner, used raspberry balsamic to compensate for added sweetness used shallots and garlic as well. (And pink peppercorns, I have a thing for them lately.) VERY tasty.

Yet another recipe from an elitist cook. 1/Fresh rosemary...why? 2/Swiss chard...seperate stems and cook before chopped leaves. 3/Why rib lamb chops only?

This recipe was excellent. For the balsamic syrup I actually put equal parts vinegar and red wine, and then let it reduce. Still added the rosemary and pepper with a little salt. It was fantastic with the lamb. Very romantic dinner and easy to make.

I'm giving this four forks on the lamb alone (made komatsuna instead of chard since that's what was ready in my garden). I used four small lamb chops and a loin, started the loin 20 minutes earlier at 425 and then turned up to broil when I added the chops. I used the same seasonings for both but added a bit of olive oil to make it like a rub. The rosemary and balsamic sauce flavors were so tasty with the lamb!

I made this for a dinner party. We grilled the chops on the BBQ because it's summer and we cook everything on the grill...Everything was so easy and so perfect. I just sent the recipe to one of the guests who can't stop raving about it and wants to serve it at his dinner party next weekend.

We liked lamb and syrup. I didn't like chard at all, but my husband did. I added a little bit of brown sugar to the syrup as I don't like sour taste at all. It tasted like pomegranate. If I cook the chard again I will add more onion and garlic as I fount it absolutely tasteless.

Used thicker chops at 2 lbs for eight chops. Followed the recipe as written with excellent result. Served with a brown rice dish containing tomato and fresh basil. Easy, quick and very good.

The lamb and chard with the balsamic blended succulently together. Mmmmm, love the sauce. Became a lover of swiss chard after cooking this. I do not know why I have never liked chard... decided to give a try and am glad I did. Lamb was wonderful too. Quick and easy.

Loved this easy recipe. Farmer's Market is alive with Swiss Chard so it was very fresh. I probably only changed it by adding more garlic and some more onions. I thought it was great. Don't overcook your chops!

I wanted a lamb dish to go with the mashed sweet potatoes and maple syrup also on this site, but there were mixed reviews for the one it was published with. When I saw the rave reviews for this one, I decided to give it a try. This is one of those classics I will go to again and again... natural pairings (lamb, garlic, rosemary) with just a little twist (the balsamic syrup). We loved it, and it was really quick to make. Could work for a week night dinner but is also fancy enough for guests. I used lamb shoulder instead of the chops also, at a third of the price and they are just as tasty. And I halfed the recipe... it worked out fine as a dinner for two. If you like them with any hint of pink left, don't leave them in for longer than 7 minutes total, and make sure to tent them with foil and let them sit for a bit after to reabsorb their juices. To complete the meal I made the swiss chard, and for dessert fresh strawberries with the amaretto zabaglione also on this site.

Yum!! Absolutely delicious. Both my husband and I loved it. Although my husband wasn't a big fan of the Swiss chard (just a preference thing). I thought it was great, chard and all. However,since my husband wasn't a big fan of the Swiss chard and the making of it was really most of the work in this otherwise very very simple, quick, and easy recipe, I may skip it next time. I might try it with something easier like spinach, which I think would also go nicely with this.

Quick and easy - I also substituted kale for the chard, which worked out just fine. Not willing to buy rib chops for a weeknight meal, I used shoulder chops instead, for about one quarter the price. Stuck them under the broiler and the results were great.

My wife had tried lamb once many years ago and never wanted it again - until I made this. Like others, I smooshed the seasoning on the chops a couple hours before and the flavor permeated nicely. I also used a griddle pan on the stove to have a little more control. The chard was a great accompaniment. Overall it was fantastic, and FAST!

This dish was incredibly delicious and easy. I couldn't find swiss chard so used kale instead, which requires more water to cook. Also paired it with mashed potatoes. The only drawback is that rack of lamb is incredibly expensive.

This was delicious as written. Worth the work when you can get fresh chard. Seasoned the chops an hour before broiling to let the flavors penetrate. Doubted that the coating would stick without oil , but it did.

The sauce is fabuloso! I just threw the lamb chops on the grill. Would serve this for a dinner party or for a weekday meal.

This is an easy and nice dish to make. But if you love lamb, I don't know if I think broiling is the most flavorful way of cooking. I prefer searing it which browns it beautifully, gives it that slightly crusty edge and just seems all around more tasty. Not bad though and certainly very very easy.

This is a great dish. I used an intense, "VSOP" balsamic vinegar and it made a wonderful sauce. The dish stands up well to a big, fruity red wine.
