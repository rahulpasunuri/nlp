I love this recipe. I did it without any corn syrup and it turned out fabulously. I'm making it again tonight!

Terrible recipe. I've made hot fudge sauce many times and this is absolutely the worst. It's runny and flavorless.

Great recipe. I wanted something more healthy than the commercial sauces. I substituted 5 squares of Trader Joe's bitter sweet chocolate (any good quality chocolate would do); reduced the sugar to 2 T; substituted 1T Smart Balance for the butter. Tip: instead of grating the chocolate, I melted in the microwave: 1 minute on high and 50 seconds on 50%. I'm so thrilled to find out what makes it get grainy. My mother never figured it out in her long life. I make a new batch as soon as I finish the current one.

I made this as a base for mud pie and woldn't you know, I made a double batch and have a lot left over. No way will it last three weeks in the fridge, as it is quite good licked off of a spoon. I used low-fat evaporated milk but the finished product says that I used heavy cream. Wonderful!

I thought this fudge sauce was absolutely lovely. I doubled the recipe, using an entire 12 oz. can of evaporated milk, so I didn't have any hanging around the fridge- but I will definitely be using this recipe again. I wanted a recipe that did not include heavy cream or bittersweet chocolate, as I didn't have any in the house, so this was perfect. It also had amazing consistency and taste- coming from a chocoholic.

What kind of cocoa powder did you all use? Hershey's baking cocoa powder? Dutch processed cocoa powder? I'm looking for uses for leftover evaporated milk.

I've made this hot fudge with enough modifications that I don't think it's really the same recipe anymore. Anyway, here is how I have gotten very good results: Whisk together 2/3 cups cocoa power & 3/4 cup sugar (as recommended by a previous reviewer). Add a 12 oz (not 5 oz) can of evaporated milk, 2 TBSP butter and 2 TBSP light corn syrup. Boil for 8 minutes as the recipe directs. Continue and add vanilla and salt once removed from heat and let cool uncovered as others suggested. This is creamy, not grainy, and plenty chocolate-y for this chocolate fanatic. Made a dozen and gave them as gifts this year.

I was very disappointed. This was easy to make but the sauce wasn't that rich chocolaty flavor and consistency that I'm searching for.

To the "grainy" cook. Bet you covered it before it was completely cool. Condensation is what causes hot fudge to get grainy. Mine was perfect the first 3 times we ate it. I then returned it to the fridge without cooling it after heating in the microwave..whoops! A grainy mess.

This sauce was so grainy, I followed the advice from other cooks and it was still so grainy! I made it again using 2/3 cup cocoa and it had a bitter edge. 2/3 cup was way too much cocoa, I think just a few tablespoons would have been better. I threw out the cocoa batch. The chocolate batch tastes okay but I like a smooth sauce better.

Yummy...great texture, thick and shiny, though a little on the sweet side. Next time I'll try a little more chocolate and a little less sugar.

Excellent fudge sauce - I've been looking a long time for a recipe like this one! I too used cocoa powder (2/3 cup) and salted butter, omitting the extra salt. Very rich and thick. Thank you Epicurious for another wonderful recipe!

So chocolatey and rich and thick...I must admit to eating a bowl of it straight. Using a bit less sugar might help though...

This sauce is fabulous. I followed another cook's tip and substituted 2/3 c cocoa for the unsweetened chocolate and whisked it together with the sugar before adding the evaporated milk and heating. And since I didn't have unsalted butter I used salted an omitted the 1/8 t. salt. It was amazingly good. And really easy! I served it over vanilla bean gelato for simple dinner party and got raves.

Excellent! I served this sauce over profiteroles; it garnered rave reviews! I too substituted cocoa for the unsweetened chocolate (3 tbsp. cocoa powder + 1 tbsp. vegetable oil = 1 oz. chocolate).

I was hunting for a lost chocolate sauce recipe and came upon this to replace it, and I'm glad I did. It's very thick and very rich, exactly the way I like it. Highly recommended.

Wonderfully gooey and chocolate-y and so easy to make. The key to avoiding grainy texture is to leave it alone as soon as it starts to boil and stir VERY gently every two minutes or so. At such high temps, the sugar plus the sugar in the milk are quick to crystalize. It thickens to the perfect consistancy and has become a family favourite!

This is like a hot fudge recipe that I got from a friend 25 years ago but had saddly misplaced. Everyone loved it! I tried this one twice, but both times had trouble with it being grainy. So I substituted cocoa powder (2/3 cup), like my original recipe, and it is smooth as can be. Just whisk the cocoa powder and sugar together, then add everything but the vanilla and salt and proceed as written. So good!!

This surprisingly easy recipe turned out exactly how I expected it to- Full of rich, robust chocolate flavor and of the perfect consistency. We toasted some coconut in a 300 degree oven, sprinkled it over vanilla-bean ice cream, then covered it in the fudge sauce. (I let the sauce cool until it coated a spoon without dripping- This allows the sauce to coat the ice cream and coconut without sliding off, which is a result of the sauce being too hot.) My boyfriend had never had homemade hot fudge before, but now I'm afraid he won't settle for anything less! Do not be discouraged if it looks as though the chocolate is separated from the rest of the liquid- it all blends together as it cools.
