excellent recipe-everyone raves. I only put 4T salt in marinade and none in the boil. I also use big pot and boil in 1 or 2 batches to save time.

We really didn't like this recipe. The vinegar and salt overpowered any other flavor and we found the dish unpleasant.

Excellent make ahead appetizer - rave reviews the two times I've made it.

We love this recipe...I made it the first time for a 40th birthday party and make it for nearly every large party that we host. I also make the version for 8 for smaller gatherings. I'm always getting requests for the recipe and checked on this website to see if it was here so I could refer my guests to the website rather than write it out...again! Thanks for keeping us all well-fed.

RATING UPDATE. I rated this recipe on 05/07/03. Since then I've made it several times with the following change. Instead of using my (rather expensive but excellent) pickling spices (from Pensey's) in the boil, I use them in the marinade. For about 1.5 pounds of 26-30 frozen shrimp (I really like Coleson's Catch), I grind about 1 tablespoon of pickling spices, the coriander, 1.5 teaspoons red pepper flakes, and black pepper (to taste) in my spice grinder. I add that mix to the juice and zest from 1 lemon, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, and olive oil - more than is called for in the recipe, but I really don't measure. I find that about 8 hours of marination give the shrimp good flavor without overpowering the taste of the shrimp itself. After "rinsing" the shrimp in the marinade to get off most of the spices, I serve the shrimp over greens, with a light drizzle of good olive oil and a wedge of lemon. I've gotten many compliments on the dish, which I use as a starter. NOTE: I've found that 1.5 pounds of shrimp makes a nice, but not too filling, starter for 4-5 people. That allows about 8-9 shrimp per person. (Plus some for tasting!) Also, next time I make it, I'm going to try topping it with a bit of chopped avocado....

I might get banned from sending in reviews for these comments. I was incredibly disappointed with this recipe. Made it this afternoon for a dinner party tomorrow and decided to take a taste tonight. Good thing I did - I would have been embarrased to serve this to my guests. The expensive shrimp, which were cooked perfectly, were "cooked" by the lemon in the marinade and became tough and chewy and they shrank. It was also way too salty even though I cut down the salt, and omitted the pickling spices. Waste of time and money.

I made this recipe as an appetizer to the Lamb/Couscous/Eggplant menu that's also featured in this "issue" of Gourmet Entertains. Initially, after tasting the shrimp, I thought that I had a culinary train wreck on my hands. The reviewers who stated that there is no kick to the original recipe must have much stronger taste buds than I do. Since I was serving it to complete strangers (business dinner for husband's subordinates), I was quite worried. Afer I "rinsed" the shrimp in the marinade to remove excess pepper flakes, things calmed down a bit. Needn't have been worried at all. It was a complete hit. (And no Tums were requested...) I served the shrimp on mixed baby greens, tossed with extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. I allowed two pounds of 26-30 sized shrimp for four people, which, with pre-dinner sampling by myself and spouse, provided about nine shrimp per appetizer. This will certainly go in my "Very Easy, Tastes Great" starter file.

Incredible recipe. I have served this at many functions and it's always the first to go. I add more red pepper flakes for a little more kick.

I modified this recipe and people just can't get enough of it! I added the zest of a lemon, added 3 tbsp of sugar, a bit of sherry and terriyaki, diced onion, red and yellow pepper and fresh cilantro. Amazing! It gets better the longer it marinates. Marinate it at least 12 hours though.

VERY GOOD recipe! I made it for a cocktail party, and my guests loved it! I did follow the suggestion for the pickling spice reduction, and used a bit more red pepper flakes.

Some problems with this recipe may be due to an error in the reduction of ingredients to make for 6. The pickling spices are only cut in half; everything else is divided by 8. REDUCE pickling spices to 1 1/2 teaspoons. This was a big hit with my 7 guests. Read recipe CAREFULLY, reduction is tricky.

I made this for a Thanksgiving party and it was a big hit with the guys who stood over it all night. Fortunately I made 4 pounds of shrimp. The pickling spice broth was odd to cook the shrimp in but didn't detract from the flavor. It was a good dish. Nice to make ahead for a party.

I entertain frequently and have made this for several parties. It is easy to make and always turns out great. I try to print out a few copies of the recipes to have on hand...I know I will be asked for it.

This recipe was just okay. I made the full recipe for a large crowd and it simply was not worth the effort. I doubt I will make it again, but if I do, I will forget the pickling spices.

I prepared this as an appetizer for a catered dinner, they loved it. I am making it this Friday for a family Easter function. I'm sure they will be impressed.

I made the smaller version of this recipe and it was not very spicy nor flavorful. I would add more chili next time.
