This was an interesting recipe. Never having cooked halibut, this was somewhat of a challenge for me. I had halibut steaks and had some bones to contend with so next time, I do think fillets would be better. The glaze was very flavorful and spicy, but the fish didn't turn out that spicy so was glad of that. We just stuck the orange strips on top of the fish and it still flavored them fine. It was a nice hint of orange and not too overpowering. For the sauce, I used two small avocados, adding only one to the puree and then chunks from the other once the sauce was pureed. Also, I am used to roasting the tomatillos (in a non-stick skillet on the stove until they have black spots all over them)for salsa so I roasted them first before pureeing them. Instead of tobasco sauce, I added a pinch of smoked chipotle powder and some smoked paprika to give the sauce a smoky flavor. We thought this turned out very nicely.

This recipe is as good as anything you would get in a an upscale restuarant. I made a few changes to it. First, I baked the fish instead of grilling it. I did not have any chipotle chiles so I used jalapenos instead. And instead of blending the entire avacado, I reserved about 1/4 of it, and cut it up into the sauce to make it a bit 'chunkier'. This dinner got rave reviews from my guests!

I didn't really care for this recipe. I think the cinnamon was overwhelming, and the avocado sauce was a complete waste. It was really bland and reminded me of orange julius. The rest of my dining party agreed about the sauce, but really liked the fish alone, with just the basting sauce. I will NOT be making this again.

I agree that the sauce wasn't the prettiest presentation I've ever served, but the flavor was excellent. I substituted tomatoes for tomatillos because I couldn't find them at my grocery store and I don't think I missed much there. I also added a little extra spice to the sauce, which made it a little less bland.

The flavor of the glaze with the avocado-tomatillo sauce was really good which made it easy to get past the sauce not being that visually appealing  might work better as salsa. The fish presentation is nice  I broiled the fish, 4 minutes on one side w/ glaze, then took the fish out, turned over, cut the slices into the fish, added the oranges, added more glaze, and cooked an additional 5 minutes. It came out perfect. Easy prep, good for weeknights!

After a read of the prior review, I decided to make a a relish of redpepper,corn, red onion, fresh cilantro & garlic that was perfect! Olive oil and salt to taste. 1st time using avocado in the quisinart and it worked perfectly with the tomatillos. Broiled the halibut and the convectioned the rest @300 for 10 minutes w/ freah cilantro and wedges of orange/grapefruit in the fish! I look forward to doing it again in the Summer months!

Very easy to make. I thought the glaze was very good, however the avocado-tomatillo sauce was bland and was not visually appealing. The next time I make this dish I will make a salsa out of the avocado, tomatillo's and add a little cilantro and red onions.

This was delicious and very easy to make...a perfect weeknight meal! The avocado-tomatillo sauce is very tasty and our favorite part of the recipe. The fish presentation is gorgeous! The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks was b/c it didn't blow us away but it is a really good fish recipe and we'll make it often.

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was delicious and so easy because you can make so much beforehand and the rest hapens so quickly! I put the fish on top of some quinoa to which I added cumin, corn, bell peppers, red onion, and lime juice. A tasty presentation and a beautiful light supper.
