Delicious! Only thing I don't like about it is you're cooking bacon right before serving the salad. That's messy and smelly if you're entertaining. I did love the dressing. Used romaine and boston lettuce with a bit of radicchio for flavor.

Love this salad!! I just came to look for this recipe because I am starting to plan my Christmas menu and this was a hit last year. The key-- for me-- was that I added the hot dressing to the greens and served immediately. That way the heat of the dressing withered the leaves slightly, but not to much to be soggy, just enough to be delicious, earning this salad a permanent spot on the Christmas menu. And I used all the bacon grease because I'm from Chicago and we're weaned on bacon fat.

Could have sworn I had bacon at home when I set out to make this- wrong! Cooked a couple of chopped shallots in 2 tbs oo then continued as written. Tossed with toasted slivered almonds. A very tasty (& healthier) alternative!

Easy and delicious. It took me no where near 40 minutes, more like 20-30. I also added some tomato wedges for some colour and balance after dressing the salad. Like it says, sweet and sharp.

This is a very good and company worthy salad. Go lightly on the dressing.

This is a very good salad! But I absolutely agree with others that you want to reduce the amount of bacon fat that you add. I added just 2 teaspoons to the reduced vinegar/sugar mixture, and that was plenty - great flavor without feeling too heavy or overwhelming. I'll probably add just 1 teaspoon next time - that might make this salad perfect!

This salad is amazing! I reduced the cider vinegar/sugars ahead of time and when ready to serve added it to about 1 TBLS of bacon fat (as suggested by previous review there's no need for more). Served over pre-packaged chopped hearts of romaine and frise, escarole, romaine combo). Served crumbled bacon on the side so that everyone could decide for themselves how "bad" they wanted to be. Not a scrap left over. Delicious!!

I served this recipe for my family. It was a huge hit! It was simple and I cut back a little on the suger and vinegar.

I made this salad on New Year's Eve as part of an hors doeuvres party for something different. I made the dressing ahead in a separate saucepan from the bacon. When I reheated it just before serving, I added about 1 Tbsp. of the bacon drippings. Even that small amount gave it a pretty heavy bacon taste. To add the ingredients to the amount of grease that would be left in the pan after cooking that amount of bacon would be absurd, and I think it would be hard to taste the dressing flavors. As it was, it had a wonderful flavor. I used mixed baby greens, but I do think more substantial greens would hold up better under the weight of the dressing.
