Oh so good. I added a little more honey and lemon...used the packaged kale and dressed it overnight. My husband even liked it. It is a keeper and very pretty to serve too. Love the different textures.

Great recipe. It was my first attempt at preparing raw kale and I will keep coming back to this one. Made a few substitutions for what I had on hand. See my version at :http://eatingininstead.com/2013/03/21/kale-salad-with-dates-parmesan-and-hazelnuts/

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this salad. Left out the parmesan because avoiding dairy and it was still stellar. Family loved the first night and co-workers loved leftovers.

I've been trying to crack the kale salad for some time. Other recipes leave the kale very tough and not very good. This was delicious. It will be a new staple!

Outstanding. I only let it sit the 20 minutes and it was still delicious. About to make more now for tomorrow!

LOVE this salad! It completely changed my relationship to kale. It stands up well to the dressing too.

This was an awesome salad! I made it for girls night potluck! It was easy to make and it did not get soggy. I didn't have almonds so I used toasted chopped cashews instead. The flavors melded beautifully. This kale salad disappeared in a heart beat...and it's healthy. I pared it with the red quinoa w/pistachios recipe here on Epi. The two compliment each other wonderfully.

Made again tonight - massaged the kale & allowed to sit in the dressing for about 2hr. Wayyyyyyyyyy better. This is going to be a regular arrival at the table from now on.

The flavor was fantastic. How can you go wrong with acid, sweet & salty? I found raw kale to be a little tough though. Next time I would very quick blanch the kale if serving that night or make ahead let it sit overnight in the dressing.

Great recipe. Agree with other reviewers that removing the stems from the kale, and massaging it with the juice of the extra lemon half, is critical (in fact, this should be done in any raw preparation of kale). The recipe did feel like it could benefit from a little more salt and a bit more Parmesan.

I'm always looking for more ways to work kale into my diet, and this recipe is a winner. The salt from the cheese, the sweetness of the dates, and the slight bitterness of the kale, along with the crunch of the almonds, adds up to an intriguing and delicious dish. Dressing ahead of time, which wilts and tenderizes the kale, is the secret here. Pomegranate seeds and sliced fuyu persimmon make nice additions.

We had chard on hand so we used it and it was delicious anyhow! Perfect blend of bitter/salty/sweet/acidic and good textures too. Don't worry about not cooking your greens - it turns out similar in texture to a coleslaw.

Delicious. Definitely give it some time to marinate.

I used baby kale to make this salad for my book group and it turned out very well - not tough at all as some of the reviewers said. If you wanted a lighter salad, you could use even less than the 2 TBSP of olive oil.

We had people over for dinner and served white bean and chive soup, this kale salad and herbed chicken and squash which all came from this site. Out of everything, this kale salad had the most people talking. Was kind of surprised because the chicken was really good. Now I am being asked to make it for Christmas dinner. That really says something about the recipe.

Thank you, I was looking for a simple recipe like this one. I grow kale all year round because it does better than cabbage. I'm going to pick the leaves right now [I have Tuscan, red Russian and Scottish curled] along with the lemons and shallots. Well maybe I'll use brown onion as I only harvested them the other day and are very tender!

I make kale salads all the time and to tenderize it, I just massage it. I don't use lemon juice but just massage for a few minutes and it is fantastic.

Why is everyone having so much trouble with this recipe?? It says juice of 1/2 a lemon right in the ingredients.. For those who feel kale is too tough, add a squeeze of the other half of the lemon to the julienned leaves of the kale and sprinkle with a bit of salt and massage it with your hand for a minute or two. This will tenderize it. Remember to cut the leaves away from the centre vein, as it will always be tough.Discard the veins and stems or use for vegetable stock. Better yet, in Toronto you can buy prewashed baby kale leaves in the same type of tub that spring mix or spinach come.. saves some prep work and they are more tender than a whole bunch of kale. This is a great tasting and healthy recipe that is simple to prepare.

If Kale is shredded, or ' chiffonade' and dressed at least an hour before sevrving, Kale is not 'tough' Search Tuscan Kale Salad here and see another wonderful version....

Sounds delicious. A little afraid of toughness of kale ? Anyone tried spinach ? Thanks for all comments.

Epicurious, Love your recipes, but please include the number of servings for each recipe. That is important information.

How much juice & what kind. There is none listed in the ingredients.

How much kale is in a bunch? I've seen small and large bunches at the grocery stores. If this recipe gave the numbers of servings and serving size, I might have some idea how much kale to use. Thanks to the reviewers who told us what kind of juice and how much to use.

Sounds weird, but it's absolutely delicious. Can't wait to buy more kale. Re juice - I used 1/2 lemon. One other question - what's the size of a bunch of kale? I just winged it with one large bunch. The dressing goes a surprisingly long way.

It's juice from half a lemon. Honestly, if Epicurious is going to include a recipe in the "Recipe of the Day" you'd think they'd proofread the thing to make sure it's correct.

This was a fantastic (and healthy!) salad. My family, including two teenage boys, was also skeptical but ate every bite. I'll definitely make it again. Odd that the juice of 1/2 lemon is not on the ingredients list. Thanks to K8mom for clarifying.
