My husband and I both loved this, pretty much as written. We are great fans of arugula, though - to my mind it would not have been as delicious without that nice nutty flavor the arugula brings. I did not save any squash for serving - it all went into the dish. As some of it was very cooked, it didn't exactly "cube" very well. But - that was fine. The dish is also beautiful, with the golden color from squash that smashes up contrasting with the bright green of the arugula. Served with grilled asparagus it was a great meal!

Good basic recipe but agree, needs additions. I added a package of sliced Cremini mushrooms after cooking shallots and garlic in olive oil and 1/2 C white wine. (used shallots instead of onions.) As per other reviews, I omitted the cumin, used more sage, and fresh ground pepper. The arugula was a little bitter for me. Next time I will try asparagus.

Good recipe. Used homemade veggie stock (added the roasted squash peel as the stok was finishing-made it very flavorful). Also added some sautéed asparagus (instead of arugula or spinach) at the end to give some texture.

I usually make the Butternut Squash Risotto recipe from Gourmet October 95, but was in the mood for sage so I worked with this one. Made a few changes, which I borrowed from the other recipe / have become my standard risotto tweaks: cooked the garlic at the end of the onion, added about 1/2 cup chardonnay before starting to add broth. I added a dash of nutmeg per other reviewers, probably doubled the sage, and skipped the greens. For the squash, I brushed 2 halves with olive oil and roasted them cut side down in about 1/4 inch of water for 30 minutes. Then I course chopped the bulbs, cubed the straight parts, and added both to the risotto about 2/3 of the way through. It needed salt at the end, even with Reggiano. It was pretty good; I anticipate the flavors will blend better and the leftovers will be delicious.

Wonderful! The cumin and sage nicely offset the sweetness of the roasted Butternut. First time making this but I highly recommend this.

I'm surprised this recipe has gotten so many positive reviews. I thought it was extremely bland and the arugula left a bitter aftertaste. After tasting it, I added pepper, an extra teaspoon of salt and an extra 3/4 cup of cheese. That made it passable, but nothing special. Disappointing.

I've made this recipe twice and it turned out great both times. I cook for myself so I halved it and it was a perfect amount. It was enough for a meal with a lunch worth of left overs. I'm not sold on the arugula, it might be too much of a contrast for my taste. In preparing the squash I just peel and seed the whole thing and chop it up into 1 in pieces before cooking. Beware, this reduces the cooking time so keep an eye on them but it saves time and is a lot easier. Also, didn't wait to start cooking the risotto, I don't really understand that instruction cause it takes longer to do the rice than to roast the squash.

Delicious and healthy recipe!!! Very creamy and easily hearty enough for a full meal. My substitutes (because I didn't have the exact ingredients): Poultry seasoning (about 1/2 tsp) instead of sage and Pecorino (about 3T b/c that's all I had) instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano.

Rating: 3
Very good. I followed recipe exactly, except I cut up all the squash and mixed in. The sage gave it a nice freshness, and the squash kept a firm bite (though it was definitely cooked fully) -- texture was very good. It did take longer than 18 mins. to absorb all the broth, and I needed to add more broth. My (homemade) broth was not strong tasting -- next time I would use Better than Boullion to punch it up a little.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I thought the squash slices caramelized in the oven was key. I put in peas instead of arugula as another reviewer suggested, and thought it was a great substitution. I put in cumin seeds instead of ground cumin and liked that added flavor (but I am a fan of cumin).

Rating: 4
This was hands down the best risotto I have made! Minor changes: left out the cumin, added cooked bacon and a handful of chopped roasted garlic that was roasted the same time as the squash. I did not serve it over squash, instead served with a side of Epi's 'arugula w/garlic croutons salad'. Can't wait for the leftovers!

Delicious! I used swiss chard instead of arugula and left out the cumin. Absolutely great as a main dish.

Rating: 4
This is my go-to for vegetarians and vegans ... it looks spectacular and tastes unbelievably good. Note: definitely use the fresh sage -- makes a difference! I also prefer the arugula over the spinach, because it gives it a little more of a "bite" -- otherwise it can taste a little too sweet for my tastes. Also, make sure you cut the butternut slices at least 1 and 1/2 inches -- it's too hard to cut the chunks away from the skin.

Blech. This is the worst risotto I've ever made. The combination of the lovely, sweet roasted squash, the pungent cheese, and the overly strong flavor of sage is totally disharmonious. We ate a little and threw the rest away -- and, it is hoped, out of memory.

Rating: 4
YUM! I used veggie stock and didn't reserve 6 slices of squash to serve the risotto on--just cut it all up to stir into the risotto. Truly, truly delicious. I also doubled the garlic and sage, based on some of the reviews. Eating my leftovers for lunch right now!

Very tasty! It would make a great side dish for Thanksgiving. I made a few changes to the recipe...I added 1 cup of dry white wine after adding the rice and cooked it until the wine was absorbed by the rice. I wasn't too sure about the cumin, so I only added a 1/4 tsp and added a 1/4 tsp of saffron. I added more cheese, 1/2 cup. I used 4 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups water. I did not add the sage or arugula/spinach. Overall, it was creamy and perfect!

Rating: 4
The fresh sage is a really delicious touch to this recipe. I left the arugula out of the risotto and instead served the risotto over a bed of arugula, which turned out very nicely and added another texture. The slices of roasted squash on the side were tasty, but difficult to eat politely. My friends and family didn't mind, but it would be awkward in some situations.

I make risotto fairly often and thought I would try a new recipe. This was pretty good. I used a little bit of white wine and the chicken broth, mixed in the whole squash (didn't serve it over pieces) and left out the spinach and arugula. I was wary of adding the cumin, but honestly, at the end, I couldn't even taste it. Pretty good.

It was a very easy recipe to follow. Risotto is always time consuming, so expect that, but other than that it received rave reviews. I made it with spinach instead of arugula and veggie broth instead of chicken. I def recommend!

Good recipe with a few tweaks, which is why I only rated it a 3. Used chard instead of spinach; doubled the amounts of sage, cumin and garlic; and added a couple of teaspoons of black pepper and a dash of red pepper flakes. All this added up to a mighty tasty dish.

I used this recipe as a foundation for the risotto I served as a side for Christmas dinner. Guests included several older Italians that asked for seconds and one that not only took a third helping but wanted to know how I made such a wonderful risotto. All of the guests raved about it except one 11 year old girl. Here were the changes I made. Cut the squash into smaller pieces prior to roasting. Also, I brushed the squash with a bit of olive oil and applied salt and pepper. I also did not serve the risotto with a piece of squash as it was used as a side dish instead of a main course. Prior to adding the onion, I added about 8 oz of diced pancetta and rendered it. (if you cant find pancetta , a lightly smoked bacon would work as well.) Added the squash, about 2/3rds the way through the cooking process so it would soften and blend better with the rice. At the end I upped the sage to two tablespoons and included fresh ground nutmeg to it as well as the other ingredients. I also declined to use the arugula as I just didnt feel it would add to the dish. By the reactions of my guests, I think I made a wise choice.

Rating: 3
A three because I wouldn't even consider putting cumin in this dish. Try the fresh sage in brown butter. Otherwise, I subbed fresh thyme for the sage and added freshly grated nutmeg as well. Spinach or arugula? Maybe in a different risotto. I used fresh peas. Other than that, the ratios are basically right.

Rating: 3
Loved it. Can't say I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't have arugula or spinach, but added italian parsley and grilled italian sausage. I also put the squash in just before the last round of broth as I thought it would be blend in better that way.

Oh yum! This one is a keeper. I too used vegetarian broth and ground sage. The only other change I'd make in the future is to leave out the spinach. It messes with the melt-in-your mouth texture and just doesn't seem to fit.

Holy smokes this is good! Very labor intensive but it makes a LOT- enough to eat, freeze, and share. My modifications: add 2.5 maple chicken sausage (cut up), and about half a block of frozen spinach instead of arugula (arugula is out of season and expensive, just $0.89 for the frozen!) I used the seasonings as written- delicious.

Risotto is truly a labor of love. I have made it as instructed and have added a few variations, if you are short on time. I used a large jar of roasted butternut squash I found at Costco and used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. It turned out wonderful! I also have added carmelized onions in lieu of onion cooked in butter. It made it more palatable for my children and it was just as creamy as the original recipe.

Rating: 3
This may be the best risotto I've ever had. The only change I made was using vegetable broth, rather than chicken broth, as that's what I had on hand. Next time, I'll remove the skin from the squash and cut it up before roasting it. I found it more difficult to remove the skin after it was cooked and it cooks a lot faster in smaller pieces.

Fantastic... substituted vegetable broth and chopped frozen spinach, and it was delicious. I also used Grana Padano parmesan, but would probably use another kind next time for a little bit creamier flavor.

This turned out to be quite a superb side dish for one of our favorite steak dinners. We followed the recipe pretty much as outlined, but added a bit of freshly ground nutmeg. We also ended up using a bit more chicken broth, which is not unusual at our mountain elevation. Even our grandson, who wasn't keen on the squash, enjoyed it.

I'm not sure if this will be an accurate review, since I changed the recipe a bit to fit what I had in the house...but I love how it came out! I sprinkled the squash with cumin along with the salt before roasting it, and it only needed 35 minutes. I used jasmine rice, and I added (a lot) of spicy curry powder along with the cumin. I used spinach instead of arugula, and added more cumin and curry at the end, as opposed to sage. I also took the other reviewers' advice and added a bit of nutmeg. My only issue with this is that it came out a bit salty...I accidently grabbed regular chicken broth instead of low sodium. Once I make it again with that change, it will be 4 fork worthy :)

The recipe sounds great but I also made some changes: I used vegetable broth instead; cooked the garlic with onion; and I added "allspice" and white wine to cumin and rice. We definetely do not need to use all broth they recommend: I had still two cups leftover. I roasted the butternut squash only for 40 minutes but some parts were too soft, thus I recommend check the squash in 35 minutes and if you need more roasting time, just turn off the oven and leave it there a little bit more. At the end, when the risotto was ready, I just added a little bit unsalted butter and I served also with parmesan cheese on the top. It turned out an awesome risotto!!!

I made this with limited ingredients but it turned out great! I used vegatable broth instead, and added mushrooms with garlic. I didn't have sage so I used thyme, and left out the argula. Also my squash had gotten very soft while roasting and so it was more pureed then cubed, but it tasted amazing

Wow. Just finished the dishes after eating this wonderful meal. Perfect with a little fall chill in the air. My husband, almost 2 year old daughter, and I just loved it. I made it vegan by using Imagine "no-chicken broth", soy margarine, and skipping the cheese altogether. My grocer was out of fresh sage, so I used ground instead. Like other reviewers, I cubed and roasted the squash in olive oil and salt, doubled the cumin, and added a tsp of nutmeg. Risotto is a bit labor intensive, but this was so worth it, I would make it again tomorrow. Enjoy!

I just loved this recipe. I followed the recipe but added about 1 tsp nutmeg and upped the sage. I had fresh spinach and loved it in this. To roast the squash, I just cut it in half and scoop out the seeds later with a spoon-easy. And I didn't bother server on the squash-which seemed really unnecessary. (Maybe for a dinner party but not for husband and me...)

I am a HUGE Epicurious fan and don't even look at my cookbooks any more. This is the first thing I've made that I've absolutely hated. Cumin, squash and arugula? Ick. I could still smell it this morning, bleck.

I roasted the butternut squash whole (before I had this recipe). It caramelized very nicely. Based on other recommendations, I grated 1/8 tsp. fresh nutmeg and used a little bit of baby mustard greens instead of spinach or arugula. So good. We'll make it again.

Everybody loved this, and it's a very pretty dish. The squash took longer to cook than indicated; it was cooked, but not all brown and roasty. I'd cube it before cooking and spray with pan spray or toss with a little olive oil to help browning. Serving the risotto on top of squash crescents gave the dish height - but that much squash was out of balance. I doubled the garlic and upped the sage and cumin a little. No need to trim the stems away if your greens are tender. This is a fine main dish, easily made vegetarian if one wants. The more carnivorous among us should constider pairing this as a side dish with a grilled steak, or topping with sliced grilled flank steak.

This is a solid recipe; however, I added additional cumin, nutmeg, and ginger for more flavor. Roasting the squash in cubes with salt and olive oil will caramalize them nicely and they will cook faster. Also, I sauteed some apple along with the onion and added wine before the broth. Great fall flavor!

This was fabulous, even though we used another, unidentified squash (yes, I sent the husband to the store!). Wonderful, fall-like flavours.

Now if only I can figure out a way to keep ALL the leftovers for myself!

After reading the other reviews, I decided to try this dish as a compliment to the Fall. The risotto, squash and arugula were a delicious trio. I cut the squash into cubes before roasting to reduce the cooking time. I added some white wine in with the chicken broth and added ginger with the garlic. I will definitely make this one again!

To those who found this recipe bland or missed the white wine, try the other roasted butternut squash recipe on this site (from 1995) - also called roasted butternut squash risotto. Fresh ginger is a major flavor element in that recipe, and it makes for a wonderful risotto...better than this one, I think. And it does call for white wine :-).

Arugula was very tasty. On the minus side, salt did not stick to squash before roasting, so dish needed more salt at serving. Of course I PAMmed the baking dish for the squash first.

Delish supper for chilly weather. Interesting that there is no wine in this, as it is usually a key component of risotto. Used homemade chicken stock. Had to sub a bit of rubbed sage for the fresh, as they were out of it at the market. My husband, not a fan of squash, ate it anyway. Will probably make again.

This was the first risotto I ever made. It was such a big hit at Thanksgiving, that it has been requested again for Christmas. I was worried that the squash would turn to mush, but I followed the recipe exactly regarding squash preparation (except I didn't salt it) and it worked perfectly. I sprayed the squash with oil before baking, per reviewer suggestion, and used spinach. Fantastic.

I agree with the comment about brushing the squash with oil first - it did dry out. I used the arugula, and cut the squash in a smaller dice. I wasn't wild about this, I have had more flavorful risottos that wowed me.

This dish was very tastey. Next time I might brush the squash with butter or oil to prevent it from drying out too much while baking. Also, I used spinach and think arugula might have been better. It was still delicious!
