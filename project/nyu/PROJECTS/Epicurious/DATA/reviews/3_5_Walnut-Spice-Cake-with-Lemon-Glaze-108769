very good BUT i cooked 5 minutes less than least suggested amount of time and it was too dry. to compensate i poked holes all in the cake and warmed the glaze and poured it over. that helped and was good anyway.

What a superb cake. I used my mum's old method of substituting 1/3 of the flour with corn flour and the result was wonderful. I made this for a Christmas Tea at work and had great reviews.

I really like this recipe, because it's nice and simple and easy to make. It's Thanksgiving today, so in this recipe I exchanged the sour cream for a small can of Pumkin Puree (398ml), and I toasted 1/2 cup of unsalted Pumking seeds and 1/2 cup of Walnuts.I used Brown raw sugar. It gave a really great flavor to the cake, made it nice and light. A great accent to any fall and holidy season.

This case is just delicious, but not extraordinary or fancy; so it gets three. But it's awfully good! Especially if it's served a touch warm. The lemon icing is a good touch. I've served several times and it's very popular.

This is a great, moist all day day - great for breakfast or an afternoon treat. I make this every winter.

This is a great cake for what it says - an all-purpose, all day cake. Especially in the winter, it's wonderful to cut a slice and settle in with a cup of something warm. As a matter of fact, I'm going to make it now to do just that!

This was defenatly a sleeper! Good idea, but don't bother, very boring cake and not worth the effort!
