A cool, refreshing summer meal. I loved it. The tarragon gives the shrimp a lovely taste.

I like the recipe (although I made a much smaller batch for myself and my boyfriend). The only reason I did not give it the full four forks is I doctored the recipe. I subbed thyme for tarragon, added grilled scallions, red bell pepper for the celery and white pepper for the black pepper. When I boiled the shrimp, I added a couple bay leaves and a tablespoon of black peppercorns to the water. I think it makes a difference. What I like about this recipe is the technique. Making the dressing ahead and letting it chill is important so that the flavors can mingle and develop. Bottomline - this is a great base recipe that benefits from using quality ingredients and is easily tweaked.

I use precooked baby shrimp, dry dill and it's delish. For variety, sometimes I add in diced red peppers and corn for extra color and then serve on musclun lettuce. It's real good.

I don't understand the negative comments - if you like shrimp, you should like this. With so few ingredients make sure you use the best and freshest ingredients you can. I added just enough mayo to hold it together and used the fresh dill I had on hand. Simple, easy, and delicious.

These were incredibly delicious! Light and fresh. The fresh tarragon is key and makes a huge difference. I only used 1 heaping cup of mayo which seemed like plenty.

I used 1/2 the shrimp, 1/2 cup mayo, juice of 1/2 large lemon, 1/2 tsp dried tarragon and 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper. I then scooped out cucumber cups, added the shrimp salad and thoroughly chilled. This was a huge hit as an appetizer!

I love seafood in a grilled hotdog roll, but the shrimp roll was not great - too much mayo. I would stay with the lobster sald roll in the future.

Not very good...leftovers sat in fridge because noone in the family liked this. Agree that it is a waste of shrimp.

blech. I should have known based on the hot dog buns...but thought I would give it a shot. Waste of shrimp !

Generously SALTED water to cook shrimp? Only if you want tough, dry shrimp. I'd make it again with a few changes, starting with NO salt in the water!
