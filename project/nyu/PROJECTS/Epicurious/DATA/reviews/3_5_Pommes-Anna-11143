I've made this several times in the past with great results. It turned out poorly for me on New Year's and I couldn't figure out why until I realized that I had soaked the potatoes for the first time. Ruined it! It turned the potato slices into hard, inflexible discs that didn't assemble or bake properly. I use a mandoline on the thinnest setting and have always used a nonstick overnproof pan instead of a cast iron skillet.

I must have messed up since mine turned into a soft mush. Did not soak the potatoes but did salt each layer with truffled salt. Possibly the salt drew out too much liquid. Used a pyrex pie plate as well so next time will go for the cast iron skillet and higher heat.

Julia has quite a different take: waxy potatoes instead of starchy. Do not put in water. Use a whole stick of butter for 1 1/2 lb potatoes. Bake uncovered for 1 hr at 350 till crisp on top. Gee - I guess that's what makes horseraces.

I used the tradtional black cast iron skillet for this recipe, which requires that you cook briefly (on high) on the stove top before putting it in the oven. I also did not soak the potatoes, just sliced and put directly into the pan as I was slicing. The dish came out absolutely beautifully, with a wonderful, carmelized crust on the bottom, almost glassy, when it was turned over. My only issue was that the butter in the pan boiled over in the oven and caused a lot of smoke in the kitchen. I may have used too much butter, but it didn't affect the final result. Everybody raved, and couldn't believe there was no "secret ingredient" (guests were tasting nutmeg, truffle, etc.)

I've made this before and used a Corning ware dish that was sort of a round like a souffle dish. Comes out beautifully. I like to add a little finely minced onion and parmesan cheese at the bottom and through the layers. It comes out very golden and crusty. I'm going to do it with Sweet Potatoes for Christmas.

The presentation was beautiful! I sprinkles layers with fresh chopped rosemary and thyme. It was delicious and pretty...what more could you want from a recipe? :-)

It could be that the potatoes are not forming a cake because by placing them in water beforehand, you are rinsing away the starch the potatoes need to "stick" together. Try it again without rinsing.

After reading all the reviewers' comments, I used clarified instead of regular butter; I also sprinkled finely chopped rosemary (about 3 T total) between each layer along with the salt and pepper, for more flavor. It was excellent -- my guests devoured it -- there weren't even scraps left. It stayed together perfectly, and easily slid out of the pan. My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't emphasize that you DO have to work quickly when building the layers in the pan before transferring it to the oven -- otherwise the bottom layer turns completely black, as mine did (so I served mine unflipped, to hide the bottom side). With this in mind, I will definitely make this recipe again. It made a lovely accompaniment to the Bacon-wrapped Beef Tenderloin with Herbed Stuffing, from Bon Appetit's Dec. 2004 issue. Yum!

I've made this several times, and we love it. Once, to feed a larger group, I used a 5-lb. bag of potatoes and a 5-quart cast iron dutch oven; it still turned out great. I think I may be using too much butter, because I've never been able to get it to be a cake, but my boyfriend and his dad nearly came to blows over the last serving last time I made it, so it's no great loss.

The potatoes were very tasty but mine did not turn out in a cake format: Instead the potatoes just went every which way.

This is very good and quite simple to make if you have a convenient way of slicing the potatoes. Following the directions of a very similar recipe on this site, I put a pyrex pie plate on top of the foil as it baked. I did need to return the potatoes to brown the bottom under the broiler for a moment. I would probably use fewer potatoes the next time to get a thinner, overall crispier cake.
