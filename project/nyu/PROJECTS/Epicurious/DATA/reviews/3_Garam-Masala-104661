The recipe calls for 1 T cardamom pods. Some cooks might not know that the pods should be opened up and tiny seeds removed. Only the seeds go into the spice grinder, and the dry pods are discarded.

A good recipe to have in your collection.

To the Iowa cook: I believe that the cook in Portland agrees with you and was objecting to the suggestions made by the previous reviewer to simply use ground spices off the shelf. This is a fine recipe and indeed, using fresh spices and toasting them makes all the difference.

To the reviewer in Portland if you don't know what you are talking about you shoudn't comment. There simple is NO substitution for freshly toasted and ground spices when it comes to Indian cooking. That one step is the key to capturing the real essence of the cuisine. Many cooks here in the states try Indian food at home and complain that is just doesn't taste the same as in their favorite Indian resteraunt. Why??? because they toast the spices in the resteraunt that's why. So the first review is DEAD ON toast the spices and then grind them fresh and you will be amazed at the difference. Oh and yes I'm from Iowa. But I've worked for years around several very good Indian cooks. They all agree that freshly toasted and ground spices is critical.

Although I haven't yet tried this particular recipe, I disagree with the other reviewer about the necessity to toast and grind the spices fresh. Perhaps it is possible to get them freshly ground in India, but here there is no comparison with ground spices off the shelf, and freshly toasted and ground!

Having just come back from living 1 year in Madras, India...I'd have to say my Indian cook and others I met (no matter how poor) did not prepare their garam masala this way - you can buy all these spices freshly ground (as long as you buy in small amounts) then dry roast just before using. I'm sure it is almost as good and a heck of a lot easiser! (especially if you use a lot of curry daily). If you want to make one special dish perhaps you can go this route....
