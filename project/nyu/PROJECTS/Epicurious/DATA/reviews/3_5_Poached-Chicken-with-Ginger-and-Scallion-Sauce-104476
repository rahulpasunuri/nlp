This is so tasty; my finacé actually had a second helping (and he never does!). I used the technique mentioned of pouring the oil over the scallions and ginger, and it seemed to work nicely. I ran out of oil today except for sesame oil (thank goodness) and coconut oil - and so I used 4T. of coconut oil instead of vegetable, and the flavour was very nice!

I prepared this for my family to celebrate Chinese New Year. They are from Taiwan and really enjoyed the dish, which is similar to what they ate every year at home. We used the liquid to make a light soup with meatballs, fishballs and daikon. My chicken was small and it needed to poach for longer than the recipe required. Leaving it to cook longer didn't seem to affect the tenderness of the chicken. I did not add MSG. I don't care for it as it tends to give me a headache. I appreciate that it is added to enhance flavor, but I prefer to taste the flavor as it is naturally.

Easy and tasty chicken. I doubled ginger and garlic, halved oil(s) and omitted msg I used only chicken breasts and skinned them after poaching. Definite keeper.

This note is for lizhirz. Only 5% of the world's people are allergic to MSG. It has earned an undeserved reputation for being undesirable. Throughout Asia, MSG (ajinomoto in Japan)is used to enhance the flavor of dishes. Asians do not share your prejudices. Nor should anyone else. Too often the opinions of a few are allowed to influence the opinions of many.

Way too much oil and even suggesting msg is ridiculous. Many more authentic Chinese recipes available than these ones.

Chicken (and lobster) with ginger and scallion has always been one of my favorite dishes. This dish is a great duplication. Like other reviewers, I increased the amount of soy sauce and ginger and scallion (triple!) and decreased the amount of vegetable oil. Also, I took a short cut and had the chicken cut up into 8 pieces before cooking, and removed it from the hot broth and brushed it with sesame oil while hot. Also, I put ginger, scallion and cilantro into the broth and topped the final dish with fresh cilantro - a real flavor boist. Finally, I topped the hot chicken with white pepper for hotness. I will make this part of my rotation!

i liked this recipe. very easy and requires few ingredients. i cut out a tablespoon from the corn oil and didn't have dry sherry, so i just used white wine. i also put some onion and ginger into the simmering chicken, and think that really boosted the flavor.

Easy and delicious. Make sure you start several hours before. It takes time for the chix to cool down. Also, while you're waiting for the chix to cool down you can use some of the broth to make the rice.

Couldn't believe how simple and delicious - only wish I knew how to make the sauce emulsify - mine was all separated between the oil and the soy stuff... Any ideas? Oh - and Shun Lee is one of my fav. NYC restaurant sand I didn't even realize until after I made this!

This was a really delicious dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and poached until just cooked through. Served over jasmine rice with some sauteed baby bok choi. Next time I'll make twice as much sauce because it was really tasty!

I served this as part of a buffet with several main courses. I used a package of chicken parts (thighs, breast, wings) already cut up which I poached the night before and refrigerated. The next day, I let it come to room temp before serving. I doubled the sauce but only used 2TBS of oil total. My only mistake was to make the sauce in advance. The green onions and ginger loose their color when they are left to soak in the soy sauce and it make for a less pretty presentation. It only takes a minute to toss together, so I definitely recommend making it at the last minute.

The chicken was very easy to prepare, and the sauce was delicious and not complicated to make, although it definitely needs to be doubled.

Make it all the time. For the poaching you definitely need salt in your water (this way you stop all of the flavour of the chicken to be "left" in the stock due to osmosis). I find it too oily and reduce the vegetable oil by half. Once tried adding aceto balsamico to the sauce and it went incredibly well.

Being half Chinese, I learned to poach an entire chicken with the bone for flavour. Used grapeseed oil. Minced ginger, green onions in bowl, added soya sauce and poured hote oil over it. Cut up poached chicken for chopstick eating and dipped it into sauce

I can't believe that a magazine with your reputation would include a recipe with monosodium glutamate! Shameful!

I used boneless breasts and just shredded them, tossing them with the sesame oil, then with the scallions and ginger and the sauce. At first I was a little nonplussed with the result, but then I kept going back into the kitchen for more.... Nice taste of ginger and scallions (duh), I used less oil for frying after reading the last comment. Pretty simple to make and tasty--I give it the thumbs up.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. It was much oilier than I expected it to be, and not as flavorful. It gave me indigestion, and I won't be making this recipe again.

This was so simple and wonderful. This is a keeper. Even the children eat it. I only wish I had made a bigger pot of rice for the sauce. I doubled the recipe as was suggested by other reviewers. I loved this recipe.

This recipe is super easy and absolutely fantastic! Definitely double (or even triple) the sauce -- its so good that we wanted it to coat every bite.

made this tonight as a quick meal, substituting boneless skinless chicken breasts and poaching them in chicken broth. Served it over basmati rice. The family said definitely add this one to the recipe box. I agree with some of the others in doubling the sauce.

This is one of the most delicious preparations for chicken and the poaching broth is very useful for soups and pilafs.

The chicken comes out very moist, and you're left with plenty of chicken stock to use for other recipes. I used about half the sesame oil called for and still thought that might be too much. The sauce is wonderful; next time I would probably double it.

This is just a great recipe, having much more flavor than one would think by looking at the simplicity of ingredients. I poached bone-in chicken breasts, but will probably do boneless next time. I used only 2 pounds of chicken, so the amount of sesame oil was decreased to about 1/4 cup (I just estimated amt). I used only about 3 tablespoons oil to saute scallions and ginger. I used 6 scallions, next time I'll probably double both scallions and ginger. I also plan to double the sauce (soy, sugar, sherry) because it was so good. Didn't use MSG. Served with rice and sugar snap peas, topped with cilantro. Pour extra sauce over the entire meal!

WOW - this was so delicious and couldn't be easier to make. I used boneless chicken breasts and only poached for 5 minutes and let sit in liquid for about 15, then removed and rubbed w/sesame oil. The sauce is AMAZING - truly authentic Chinese tasting - I simply omitted the MSG, you'll never miss it. I can't wait to make this again using various chicken parts, bone-in. Served over steamed white rice with steamed broccoli my husband was begging for more. YUMMMM...

It's hard to imagine how boiled chicken flavored only by a sauce w/ a couple ingredients can be this good. . . but trust this ABC (American Born Chinese)!This is delicious & authentic - the chicken is succulent and the sauce is wonderful. Made it for Chinese New Year for the 1st time; I omitted the sesame oil by mistake and rubbed/sprinkled w/ salt instead (after "s", the word got cut off on my printed recipe) - it was wonderful. Next time will try the sesame. I took the chicken out of the pot after 3 hours. It was still steaming, but I couldn't wait any longer. I found this amount of time fine. My kids, husband &I LOVED it.

We don't call it MSG anymore it's now called magic powder. exites the appetite! This dish could use Dark Mushroom Soy for that extra level I think it needs.

I really enjoyed this dish and it was so easy! I used cut-up chicken instead of whole chicken. I skipped brushing the sesame oil on the cooked chicken to serve plain to my kids and found the sauce was more than enough flavor for my husband and me. I also didn't have the sherry or wine so I substituted rice vinegar and the sauce was delicious. I would double the scallions next time because they were really good.

MSG? Come on, real cooks don't use this cheap way to flavour a flavourless dish. Pretty disgraceful.

This was awesome - my kids kept asking for more - I couldn't believe it!! I didn't have any scallions on hand - so I chopped up 4-5 shallots instead - while not as authentic - the taste was awesome!! I am not chinese, but my husband is - he loved it and said that the sauce tastes exactly like the one his grandmother used to pour over fish. MMmmm - we'll try that soon.

This is a pretty authentic recipe per my Chinese mother and a must for Chinese New Year Dinner. The only suggestion would be with the "sauce." The ginger, scallion & salt should be placed in a heat proof dish and boiling oil be poured into the dish. The tastes of both the ginger & sacllion is much more vibrant this way.

This did make for moist chicken, but I expected more flavor - I even added ginger, scallion, and garlic to poaching liquid. Might try adding seseame oil as some of the sauce oil. Factor in enuff time for the chicken to cool and debone if you are planning to serve it same day...longer than I thought to cool and handle.

This was great! I was a little worried when the grey-ish chicken came out of the water from being boiled. It was really good. I will definitely do this one again. I served with szechuan noodles and spinich w/ bamboo shoots and ginger? (both here) The meal was a great success. The left-over chicken was good cold. No need to 'refactor' & turn it into something else. It's been a week. I'm ready to cook it again.

So easy. I used chicken breasts, and was very happy with how moist they stayed (usually a problem with breasts for me). This sauce is simple and delicious.

Add ginger and scallion to boiling water for added flavor to chicken.

The only difference I would make to this wonderfully easy and delicious recipe is that I would use at least double the amount of scallions.
