Try the Mashed Root Vegetables, Nov. 1999 Bon Appetit recipe as well. Preferred the milder flavor of that recipe.

Hi, Carl. Some people like to put bouillon cubes in the water when they boil veggies (like potatoes, broc, especially butter peas). It doesn't matter about the quantity of water, because one ends up draining the veggies before eating. The cubes are just to add flavor to the dish. Please ignore the rude people and thier comments, and don't be discouraged. Cook away!

Mashed potatoes with turnips were a holiday staple in my New Jersey childhood. I did not have the joy of tasting the surprizingly sweet and delicate parsnip until I was an adult. It is a perfect combination with carrots. Try sauteing slices together.

The cook from Bethesda, MD, says: "Regarding the recipe, forget about it. Yams and parsnips? Sounds like the editors at the magazine were running late for a deadline and this is all they could come up with. Subscribers have every right to criticize this lack of effort." Maybe the joke's on you, Bethesda. So what if you don't like the ingredient combination? To each his own. But the recipe is from the Too Busy to Cook? column, and those recipes are submitted by readers, are extensively tested and edited by Bon Appetit before they are accepted, and this happens at least four months before the issue in which they appear is pulished. I know this because I had my recipes published in this column in October 1997.

Yams annd Parsnips? Yes, this was an excellent combination, the dish was wonderful. And went great with the pork w/ maple glaze recipie featured on this site, too.

I thought the recipe was quite good for the "hands on" time required. I had it last night with salad and today with ham and cabbage and enjoyed it both times.

I actually preferred this recipe without the boullion.

This is a quick & tasty vegetable puree recipe which goes well with a beef stew & green beans. Re-heats well too if you make it a little early (over a pan of steaming water). A note to Nancy of Florida & the cook from Raleigh, NC - its totally unnecessary & very unkind to ridicule the remarks & queries of other reviewers. These people may be novice cooks who have every right to ask basic questions of the rest of us. This is how people learn & improve. Snide remarks about 'Betty Crocker' & 'cooking by numbers' are out of place here & just make you look mean-spirited.

This is basic winter time comfort food. I substituted sturdy russet potatos because I do not like the wateriness(sp?) of the red skins. Adding cheese is a decadent idea - I will try it next time. Lastly, I agree with the last two cooks on the attitude issue. Let's try to encourage people to join the ranks of home cooking - not scare them off!! Like all sports and hobbies, participants have an obligation to promote their "sport"!! It's holiday time - let the games begin!!! Have fun, Carl!!!

I think you all are very funny! I thought this space was for reviewing the receipe so we all can learn from each other's success and mistakes, not to bash one another. You may want to finish this in a chat room for angry cooks!! HAHAHA All and all, I thought this was a good recipe, I would definitly make it again. Thanks!

nice easy side or simple meal. And as far as some of the other reviews, the full article this was a part of in Bon Ap addresses the points made by Carl...but I can't figure out where the snide comments and exclusivity of other's can be addressed -- this is all about food people! Enjoy yourselves!

Very good recipe. Easy to make. My daughter, who generally doesn't care for yams, enjoyed this recipe. Quick note to Nancy in Florida: My, My, aren't you SNOBBY? Look up a website on etiquette the next time you are online.

You tell 'em Nancy! I think asking how big a pot to cook vegetables in is an *amateur* question. Skipping the information in a recipe is not evidence of same on the part of epicurious. The recipe is good. I've substituted the milk with sour cream and added some small cubes of swiss cheese. (Sorry, Carl...I didn't measure.)

My My My..aren't we touchy..Anyone that doesn't know how big a pot or how much liquid to use to boil veggies...should be still using Betty Crocker cookbooks or Cook by Numbers books, not this website for REAL COOKS. THE RECIPE DID COME FROM THE "TOO BUSY TO COOK SECTION". I am very thankful for this website. It is the best of ALL the Recipe Centers. CHILL OUT!!!

I also thought that this was basic recipe, I learned it when I was really young just using turnips. I wouldnt mix all of those vegies and potatoes together.

I believe Carl is well aware of proper cooking techniques. He's just letting a cooking magazine staff know that they printed an amateur recipe. Touche.

CARL, USE ENOUGH WATER TO COVER THE VEGETABLES. TASTE THE BROTH ONCE THE WATER IS HEATED AND CHECK THE BOULLION TASTE AND ADD WATER IF TOO SALTY AND ADD MORE BOULLION IF NOT SALTY ENOUGH. THE WATER IS DRAINED BEFORE THE VEGETABLES ARE MASHED, SO SIZE OF POT AND AMOUNT OF WATER NOT AN ISSUE.

Carl T. Erickson- It is customary to estimate the volume of the ingredients and choose the size of the pot accordingly. With root vegetables that require boiling, most people boil them in enough water to cover them completely...so that they cook. (Kind of the same concept as cooking pasta.) I hope this helps you.
