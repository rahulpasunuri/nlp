I love hearty greens, so this recipe was appealing. Gave it two forks because it sounded fairly bland as-is. I added a minced shallot with the leeks and minced garlic just before adding liquid. I added a can of diced tomatoes with liquid, then seasoned with cayenne, salt and pepper. I added a diced yukon gold potato instead of croutons (dang yeast intolerance!). Then the broth, a bay leaf, chopped fresh parsley and thyme. I let the potatoes cook in the broth, then added kale and mustard greens (I didn't have cabbage). I let the greens cook for about 5 minutes. Drizzled about a tablespoon of Siracha into the pot before serving. I forgot all about the cheese, but didn't miss it. It was delicious on its own.

It's been a while since I made this soup to use up the greens I received from an organic food basket, but my memory of it is that it was terrible. I remember adding plenty of pasta and rice in order to mask the bitter taste...

I thought the soup was delicious. I substituted 2 cups chicken broth that I had leftover (with white wine and herbs). I also used kale instead of mustard greens... it was local and organic :)

This soup is pretty dull but feels very virtuous! (Maybe not when you put as much cheese and croutons on as I did though!)

Made this tonight. Without mustard greens. Will try in the spring when they arrive. But added a little parsley. Much depends on the taste of the broth. It was pretty bland but still pleasant. A little like the broth from pot au feu. Would like to work on a good white broth (veggie) and try again soon. Gentle and comforting. A good way to get your cabbage! Great antidote after the excesses of Christmas. Interestingly goes very well with bubbly. Nice!

I made this soup in order to use up some leftover cabbage. Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much. Made it just as written, including the croutons and cheese. To my surprise, it was delicious! Amazing how much flavor could be created by such a simple preparation (it took no time at all) and so few ingredients. Sadly, there are no leftovers :( Next time, I'll double the recipe!

I tried this recipe to use some cabbage I had on hand. I took the suggestion of adding a few cloves of garlic and hunk of ginger from another reviewer. I did not use nearly as much mustard greens, and added some freshly chopped parsley from the garden. My 10yr old daughter and I loved this soup, delicious flavor yet so simple. We liked it very well without the croutons and cheese. But when I reheated leftovers and added this, it was even better! I bought some of those hard, crumbly croutons from the store that I thought would be awful, but when saturated in the soup and sprinkled with the grated cheese, it was irrisistable. The croutons had caraway seed, which added a great flavor and a tiny little "crunch." I couldn't resist heating up another ladle full.

It seemed a bit bland for us, so I added a hunk of ginger and a few cloves of garlic (whole) and let them boil with the soup for a bit. Before eating, I took out the ginger and garlic. Soup tasted great!!!!

Maybe I just don't like mustard greens, but I didn't like this soup at all!

This is simply wonderful. It's easy, fast and delicious. I was expecting something bland but all those greens + a little butter and thyme bring out so much flavor. Will make again and again, and again...

Well, I kind of used this recipe as a jumping off point. I used purple cabbage, beet greens, added a bit of fresh ginger and used half butter half oilve oil. I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it!

This is a fantastic and easy to make soup. The taste is unique and flavorful. I didn't add croutons or cheese but loved it with the tobasco, added a nice kick. Will make again!

This is amazingly delicious for something SO SIMPLE! I used fresh grated parmesan instead of Romano and left off the croutons and it was still terrific. I'll definitely make this again.

Lovely and light. I too cut the butter by 1/2 and it still had plenty of flavor.

Delicious! I cut the butter back to 1 T and that was plenty. This is a WONDERFUL soup WITHOUT the Tabasco. The butter and leeks gives it a French flavor. It tastes extremely rich without being that fat-laden. Adding the Tabasco completely changes the soup (also very good, just different). I did not add either cheese or croutons.
