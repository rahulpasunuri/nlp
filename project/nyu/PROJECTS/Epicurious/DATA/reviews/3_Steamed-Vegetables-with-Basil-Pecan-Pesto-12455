I used the traditional pine nuts and forgot the garlic. Loved it. Pesto with the carrots, potatoes, & beans is a nice change from pesto with pasta has gotten boring.

i just made the pesto with linguine, and it was great- my boyfriend even loved it, and he usually has a strong aversion to anything green. rave reviews from everyone!

I just used the recipe for the pesto. It was good, but I would double the amount of garlic.

Unfortunately I used this receipe for a dinner party without having tried it before hand. The vegetables were not done in the time described, the potatoes had zero flavor...actually all of them were uninspired even with the pesto.
