This is very good. A bit arduous to make, but if you like fussing, the favorable reviews from guests is worth the time.

Wow, possibly the best ice cream ever... I followed the prep of the orange puree as closely as I could. Unlike how the recipe depicts it, the sugar will melt AND burn. This concerned me but turned out to fantastic. Make sure you get all of the burnt sugar out of the pan. You won't regret it. Do to the lack of moisture after baking the oranges, I chose to leave the pulp on all sections of the oranges. The resulting puree was still VERY thick and had to be forced through a fine sieve with a spoon - but well worth the effort. The resulting dark orange/brown puree is amazing!! For the custard I followed the recipe for the most part but adjusted it to fit max volume of my ice cream maker. Will definitely do again... soon!
