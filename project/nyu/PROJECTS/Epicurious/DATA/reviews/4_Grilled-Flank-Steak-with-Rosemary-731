This flank steak is by far our FAVORITE meal! We do not add the salt, and it turns out perfect every time (and I'm a salt lover), but I do use Kikkoman soy sauce which is more salty than some soy sauces. I marinate the steak in a gallon ziplock bag for 2 hours. Using the ziplock bag keeps the marinade on both sides of the steak at once so you don't have to keep flipping it on a dish to marinate. I usually make 3 recipes of the marinade at once so it's all ready to go when we need it! We make it all the time and will never get tired of it. Guests love it, and even our small children love it! We never have leftovers because we just can not stop eating it!

Super quick to make out of pantry ingredients, this teriyaki-type marinade was a very good fit for our grilled flat iron steaks. 2 hours is about right -- I wouldn't leave it in longer because I think it would overwhelm the flavor of the meat.

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious, cheap and FANTASTIC to serve for company. I have made this on the grill and also under the broiler in the winter and either way it's great. If you use the broiler, be sure to put a cookie sheet or something under the steak so it doesn't drip all over the oven.

I've made this several times. Whenever I see a flank steak at the market, I grab it because I know that I can always whip this dish up easily. My guests tried to do their own version of this when I went to their house a few weeks later, a sure sign that they loved it. Great summer grilling recipe!

Very good! Quick, easy preparation. I made the mistake of taking the advice of other posters and eliminated the salt, since it had soy sauce. But everyone needed to add salt to it at the table. next time I'll make it as directed.

I've made this before, and it's always fabulous, but the last time, I followed some reviewers' suggestions about adding balsamic vinegar. Great idea! I also reserved part of the marinade and used it on a dish of baby bella mushrooms that I'd just sliced in half. Both marinaded about 5 hours; then, I grilled the steak in my cast- iron grill pan and sauted the mushrooms. Loved it!

This was SO easy and SO delicious. I extended the marination by a few hours and cooked the steak under the broiler. I couldn't stop eating this and I can't wait to try it on the grill.

I made this for the first time tonight, and it couldn't have been easier. I didn't follow the recipe to the letter because I had 2 1-1/2 lbs flank steak, so I had to adjust the marinade, and it turned out so well that I can't wait to make it again! It was absolutely delicious. I kept it in the marinade for about 5+ hours, given that this cut of beef needs tenderizing. I didn't find it too salty, nor did I find it too sweet. It was just right! Thanks, Bon Appétit, for giving us a winner recipe!!!!!

I have made this for years. I think it came from an old Gourmet issue in the 90's. It is a great base to play with for all kinds of dishes. I replace the honey with molasses for beef and often add some heat.I too marinate much longer than the recommended 2 hours. Works on the grill as well. Never fails when paired with long roasted root vegetables.

Terrific recipe! Left out the salt since I was using regular soy sauce, but otherwise followed the instructions as written. Wound up marinating steak for closer to 4 hours, but don't feel that it was a negative. Wonderful sweet and salty flavor. Great use for rosemary from my garden. Both kids gave it "two thumbs up" - definitely will make again!

Everyone wanted this recipe after dinner! I did marinate it overnight, I think that made it even better.

I've made this probably 20 times and it is always great. Great for company and larger groups because you can grill one to medium and one rare. Thicker cuts will have medium to rare in one cut. I always use ziplocs for the marinade. Serve with horseradish cream sauce.

Rating: 4
I have made this since it first appeared in BA but I substitute the honey for 1/3c balsamic vinegar as we prefer more of a tangy flavor as opposed to sweet (and the vinegar helps to tenderize the meat more). I also leave out the salt--who needs salt with soy sauce? The longer you marinade the better. Everyone loves this marinade and I have also used it with chicken.

This is a staple in our house. I have been using it for years and basically the only marinade I use for flank steak.

I never bought flank steak until this recipe. I marinate 4-5 hours, but like the robust flavor it imparts. I use low salt soy sauce so a little added kosher salt doesn't hurt it a bit. Pair this steak with the Arugula, Tomato & Corn Salad also on this site for a dynamite summer meal!!

The flavor was alright, but the honey gave the final product an odd texture that really turned me off. It was slightly gummy. I won't be making this marinade again.

I thought this marinade to be a bit sweet. In order to counter the sweetness, but keep some depth, I would try adding some red pepper flakes, maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 tsp. I also think it could be improved by substituting sesame seed oil for half of the olive oil.

Most definitely exceptional! I just made this for a summer BBQ, and everyone was raving about how delicious it was! The meat was very tender, flavorful, and surprisingly light. Best of all, it was super easy and quick to make. Like most, I stuck with 2 hrs. for marinating, and it came out perfectly. Any longer, and I think it would have ruined the flavor. Also, I didn't think the honey flavor came out against the soy sauce, but I'm sure it helped to balance the saltiness. I would try it with maple syrup next time. Omitted the salt, too. I served this with grilled corn and chile-lime cream (from Aug. 2007 Bon Apetit), finishing with vanilla ice cream on grilled balsamic marinated peaches - divine!

A definate keeper. The comments are very helpful such as use mushroom soy & maple syrup and bag with marinade and freeze.

Rating: 3
DO NOT ADD THE SALT! I feel this comment needed to be bumped way up, as I didn't notice it when I scanned over the more than 100 reviews. Also, you might want to cut back on the amount of black pepper too. I pretty much always marinate beef overnight. If you only do it for a couple of hours, then maybe the salt won't be so pronounced. But you certainly won't be able to boil and reuse the marinade with this level of saltiness to it. The soy sauce is more than sufficient. With these changes, I can see that this marinade has great potential for summer grilling and for using the rosemary growing in my garden. I intend to make it again without the salt and am kicking myself because I should've known better and not gone with what was printed.

Rating: 4
This was DELICIOUS. Took other reviewers advice and served with the black bean, corn & tomato salad. With the addition of a nice Shiraz it was a truly wonderful meal!

Since this first appeared in B.A., it has been a trusted and often requested standby for me. I often make up a double batch of the marinade and freeze a second steak(marinade and all). On a busy day, I can just pull it from the freezer and as it defrosts, it marinates. Propbably not orthodox... but I've done it many times, and it has never let me down.

Rating: 4
I've reviewed this recipe before and want to reiterate how much of a favorite it's become. This past weekend, I was in the position of having to marinate for two days, when our Friday night grilling plans were foiled by thunderstorms, and we had other plans for dinner on Saturday. Last night, after two days, we enjoyed the best flank steak ever. Since there is no acid in the marinade, there was no fear of tissue break-down or alteration of the beef's natural texture. It was juicy, delicious, and not overpowered by the marinade. We use a dark mushroom soy sauce and add just a touch of maple syrup. Also, fresh rosemary is a must.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice in the last week. Tried it out on the husband first. He loved it. Then served it again at a dinner party of 8. Big Hit. After putting the meat on the grill I also reduced the marinate down and added sauted mushrooms. This in turn was poured over the steak. This marinate is also wonderful on Portabella Mushrooms. One of the guests is a vegetarian so cooked a a couple of portabellas just for her. Other guests went crazy over them. Let the portabella marinate in the sauce for about 1 hour then put on grill. YUM!!!

Fabulous... my entire family loved it. Extremely easy (basicly 5 ingredients)and so flavorful.

Very good and very easy. I was a little skptical because there was no acid to to tenderize and maybe next time I will add a bit of cider vinegar. Overall, it was pretty tasty and easy. I grilled it over charcoal which helped. It is a keeper for the "fast & easy" file!

This recipe really doesn't need any more positive reviews, but I, too, found it to be probably the best marinade for flank steak I've ever tried. The honey produces a nice crust when grilled. I've tried it with thyme instead of rosemary when I didn;t have any, and that was great too. I'll never make a non-marinated flank steak again!

This recipe really is a winner. I served it to a friend who is a chef and HE asked for the recipe. I did omit the salt and added a pinch of cayenne pepper for extra zip and only marinated an hour as I find food that marinates too long tastes 'cured' to me. As another reviewer suggested, I also grilled onions with the marinade. Fantastic! It was great the next day in sandwiches as well.

Used this marinade to make NY steaks last night and it was incredible. I left out the salt and used fresh rosemary as suggested and marinated for about 7 hours.

This is an amazing dish. While it is incredibly easy, you will stun your guests -- everyone asks for the recipe. Don't add the salt -- soy sauce has plenty. I used all the pepper.

Really.

This marinade is very tasty and the flavor really does stay with the meat (unlike some marinades), but we actually thought it overpowered a bit - it didn't let the taste of the beef shine through enough for my tastes. However, it was really, really good on the mushrooms I made as a side. I reserved the marinade and then boiled it. After boiling, I added it to the pan of cooked mushrooms and let it simmer for a bit. Boiling the marinade seemed to make the sweetness of the honey shine through a bit. Very tasty on the mushrooms!

An absolutely perfect balance of flavors! I have never rated anything on this site 4 forks before, but this is spot on. Used a tri-tip, marinated it for 8 hours (because there was no more time).

This is the best flank steak recipe I've found. Fresh rosemary is the key--don't use the dried stuff. Also, you can skip the salt. The leftovers work well in a salad with lentils and red wine vinaigrette (esp. if you cook it inside and save the pan juices for the vinaigrette).

I used the marinade recipe to infuse flavor and more tenderness to a 2-inch sirloin steak, then cooked it on my indoor grill. Even though the steak was slightly overcooked, it was still very flavorful. I should have taken into consideration that the marinade tends to cook the meat. I added sprigs of thyme rather than rosemary and I imagine most herbs are interchangeable in this recipe.

Prepared this recipe using beef tri-tip and was impressed with the delicious results. Using fresh rosemary is key. Also crush the rosemary to release the essential oils. Grilled for 8 mins. per side at medium temp for medium-rare. Do not leave grill unattended or the honey will cause a flare up and burn. Loosely tent for a minimum of 15 mins. before carving to allow time for the juices to re-distribute through the meat. Served with a caesar-style salad with the addition of sliced mushrooms and avocado. Will add this to my recipe file for my catering business.

I loved this recipe! The marinade made the steak very tender and so tasty. We didn't baste it at all on the grill, and it still had lots of flavor all the way through the meat. I did marinate it about 24 hours in the fridge. I used low-sodium soy sauce and cut out the additional salt, based on reviews here, and didn't miss any salty taste at all. I can't say enough about this recipe -- super easy, great for preparing in advance and for entertaining, and superb taste. The leftovers taste great as well! Enjoy!

This dish works for a family supper or casual dinner with friends. The honey is the element that softens the meat so you can use this same marinade with skirt steak but would be best if you increased the marinade time to overnight in the frig. Take the meat out from the frig an hour or so before cooking regardless of the cut of meat or length of marinade. I think two hours is a bit short, have done up to five and had great results. Low sodium soy sauce is preferred. If you only have regular soy sauce then cut it with a little water and cut out the salt. You can always salt it on the grill if you feel you need it. This receipe is very similar to one that was in Too Busy to Cook but the fresh rosemary in this one rocks. I always double the receipe for each flank steak so that they are immersed in liquid. A question for others, I used supermarket honey, does the brand of honey itself make a difference? Would it be different with clover or wild flower verses the blend? Would love to know if anyone has experimented.

So easy to make and everyone always loves it! It is a great recipe for when you have guests. I also like to let it marinate overnight. The flavor really sets in.

Simply an outstanding flank steak recipie. Have made this 5x and it has been great every time (although fresh rosemary really, really improves the flavor) Leftovers on some nice bread make a fantastic sandwich.

I have made this Flank Steak over 5 times and I still get rave reviews for it. Very easy..and excellent flavor. Marinade 10-12 hours and bring flank to room temp before grilling. Also cut salt by 1/2 or even omit-you really do not need it.

A favorite with all my friends and family. Marinating the meat overnight leaves it very tender and flavorful. Not only is it ridiculously easy, the presentation is great if you carve it at table.

Wonderful with both flank steak and beef tenderloin. Make extra as people eat more than usual! I cut out the extra salt as soy sauce is usually salty enough. Keep on hand for a quick, flavorful marinade when having guests.

have made this numerous times. always good. easy too. we marinate overnight and reduce the salt to just a pinch. has worked fine with low sodium soy too. it has a particular affinity for scalloped potatoes..

I have made this marinade for years and people I serve it to become instantly addicted! It works well on pork and lamb chops too. I have done a few variations and my favorite is to substitute Hoisin (Chinese sweet plum) sauce for the honey and add a little toasted sesame seed oil. The soy sauce is really all the salt you need. Forget adding any more because this has SOOO much flavor already. MY BEST TIP...Marinade overnight! MY SECOND BEST TIP...also marinade some whole Portobello mushooms caps and cook everything on the grill with some soaked apple wood chips. You will end up craving the flavor!

This is a great marinade for flank steak...I used a combination of rosemary and thyme, and it was delicious. Especially like the short marinating time. Served slices of the grilled steak on a salad of greens with some vegetables I roasted while the steak was on the grill--baby portabellos, red onion, and orange pepper--then added slices of red new potatoes, some tomato, and spiced pecans. Dressed the salad lightly with a balsamic vinaigrette. Made a filling, tasty, and relatively healthy summer entree.

I've made this dish many, many times (since the Sep 95 issue) and each time it's great! One recommendation would be to marinate the steak overnight vs. 4-6 hours fo a more intense flavor. Happy grilling!

This was a very good, easy recipe that I followed to a tee. I used fresh rosemary from my garden and let it marinate for about 7 hours. The steak was incredibly tender and delicious. I thought this was better than the usual sirloins I get. I will buy this cut frequently and use this recipe from now on. A keeper!

I had started making this recipe about 2 years ago and it became a staple when I wanted to dazzle friends to a great barbeque. I find modifications are not necessary, however, I do agree with one of the other reviewers in that fresh rosemary is preferable over dried. Make it and have a copy of the recipe ready...people will always ask you for it!

Oh sooo good. This steak marinade is pretty perfect...no modifications needed here. Served it (thinly sliced) over garlic mashed potatoes...Boyfriend and two friends LOVED it!

Flavor was excellent. I would really recommend using fresh rosemary for this dish--dried rosemary became twiggy and interferes with enjoyment of the dish. Also, broiling time was much less due to thin cut of meat.

This is a great recipe which produces excellent results if made as is. I took the liberty of making a few modifications which I think make it even better. I added 1/2 T. Worcestershire, reduced the honey by a T.,and added 1/3 c. red wine vinegar. With or without any modifications, I like this recipe very much.

Absolutely terrific - all these flavors fused together wonderfully and make any flank steak radiate with nice flavor. A happy addition to my recipe collection!

This dish is incredibly flavorful! I'd suggest slicing the steak into strips prior to marinating, and I double the sauce to have extra for frequent basting on the grill (but if you double the sauce, leave out the salt as the soy is quite salty).

This recipe has made it to my "regular" file. I make it every couple of weeks or so, and then slice up the steak very thin and serve on mixed greens with a good Italian dressing and blue cheese crumbles on top. That and a good loaf of bread makes dinner!

Amazing! Easy and inexpensive yet presents beautifully and tastes fabulous. The little we had left over was so good and flavorful cold that it was eaten directly from the frig before I could put it to use on a salad.

Absolutely fantastic - I make this all the time for company. For more flavor try slicing the flank steak in half-inch thick slices before marinating, then grill to individual specifications - Yummy.

The marinade for this was so good that I boiled the extra for a few minutes and served it as a sauce alongside. I used brisket since this was last-minute and that was all I had in the fridge, but I think flank steak would definitely have been more tender. Taste-wise, it was delicious.

I used this marinade on some venison steak. I purposely didn't do my husbands steak and found him picking off of the kids and I's plate. He considered it a sin to "ruin" good deer. I now have his approval to marinade his this way. I am a saltaholic so I followed the recipe exactly but found other reviewers correct. The soy sauce was salty enough. That is the only modification I would do. I'm looking forward to trying it on other cuts of meat like chicken.

Left out the salt as suggested and marinated over 12 hours; didn't count the hours. My husband " scarfed" this down and raved about it (Oh, I used tri-tip instead of flank steak.) I thought it was good, not super, though. And, it definitely had enough good flavor; no need for more marinating either for tenderness or flavor.

I thought this was a great recipe and so did my husband... even my my three-year old ate a little -- go figure. But I had to laugh when my husband said "you could make beef jerky out of that", as I remembered another reviewer's comments. It actually does taste like beef jerky... albeit really good beef jerky... still, something seems amiss when your steak draws comparisons to jerky. Don't get me wrong though, I thought it was great. But I actually do think this marinade would make fabulous beef jerky. I might try it sometime.

After reading all of the great reviews I was looking forward to trying this recipe, unfortunatly I've had better marinated flank steak. It marinated for 24 hours and yes it was tender but it really should have had more flavor. My mom has been making marinated flank steak for over 30 years and her recipe is really the tops. I thought that this one would out do my moms, boy was I wrong. She does not use the rosemary. She adds fresh ginger to hers and I think this really makes the difference.

Rating: 3
I left out the salt, and I probably could have even cut some of the soy sauce -- and I used the low-salt brand! My steak was 1.5 pounds and it was perfect with 4 minutes a side, and a ten-minute rest before slicing. A nice medium rare. I marinated the meat for 24 hours and it was very tender. I boiled the extra marinade and drizzled it over the warm meat before serving. Oh, I also crushed the dried rosemary....

I have made this so many times and given the recipe out to guests over and over again so I finally sat down to say "this flank steak is unbelievable"! Couldn't be easier, and people just rave about it! Skip the salt, like the other reviewers suggest...the soy sauce is enough. Also, my number one tip - MARINATE FOR 24 HOURS - this is the key to make it absolutely fabulous! Here's the kicker...I'm a vegetarian! Of course I don't eat the steak, but after so many compliments I have to say MAKE THIS TODAY!

I omitted the salt, but realized that the great flank steak I bought ended up tasting like beef jerky.

An amazingly tasty and easy-to-prepare recipe for an inexpensive cut o' meat!

I love meat, and I think this is the best marinade for steak I've ever had.

Rating: 2
Good as it may be, it is a rather rudimentary preparation--a very obvious one. You might use it to overcome the tastelessness of a nation-wide chain pre-cut cut. Salt, as somebody has remarked is unnecessary. If you crave for more, salt it when cooked and then with freshly ground cristal sea salt with its superb whiff of iodine. Soy sauce... Most are mediocre or anodine (most but not all). It works better with pork and vegetable and improves with a few drops of sherry vinegar and/ot bourbon (etc.). Far preferable is the Chinese oyster sauce preferably from a Chinese store. While I may not be ready to reproduce the recipe as such, I would relish to have it served in a restarant or... your home. I'd bring a Shiraz from down-under, or a decent Zinfandel, and let's not forget there's always a Bordeaux for any imaginable life/death situation. Basta, tripo[d][t]

I tried this first with flank steak, then with tri-tip. The flavors were outstanding for both, though we liked the tri-tip better. The flank steak was fairly fatty, and the tri-tip was nice and lean. Works well to marinate in a bag all afternoon, then grill for dinner. Will make again.

One of the best flank stank marinades I've tried. We make it frequently and friends always ask for the recipe. Don't forget to poke holes in the steak with a fork before marinating - this ensures that the steak soaks up all the wonderful marinade flavor!

The marinade was delicious, I boiled the remainder and drizzled over meat on plate. I didn't change any ingredients but I did use a large ziplock bag for marinating instead of the 9x13 dish. I always find I get better, more even results that way. Now I don't know if we have fatter flanks up here in Canada but at 4 minutes per side our steak was still "blue" in the centre. Next time I'd go 6-7 minutes per side for medium-rare. Great recipe!
