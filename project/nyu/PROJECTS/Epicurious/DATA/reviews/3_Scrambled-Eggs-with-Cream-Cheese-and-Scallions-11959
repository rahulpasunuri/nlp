It was OK. I'd only do it again if I was stuck with those ingredients.

This reminds me of a recipe I had at a restaurant once called LePeep in NJ. It has since closed, but I remember they also put chunks of ham in it. This may add the saltiness that some of the reviewers were craving. It was a delicious dish

Wonderful! Also works well just using egg whites, and only 1/2 tablespoon cream cheese stirred in at very end.

I think this needs a bit more saltiness, but it's a nice way to use up some of the most on-hand ingredients around. Good for late night snacking.

Very simple twist to basic scrambled eggs adds a lot of flavor. I added some asparagas tips for color and texture.
