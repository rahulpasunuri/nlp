My family loves this recipe. We've made these cookies every since the issue came out and they get better every year! We usually skip the icing, and my kids eat them faster than I can make them.

I've made these cookies every year for the last couple of years.... since 2006, when the issue came out! These are just amazing cookies. DO NOT OMIT THE ICING! The icing is what makes these cookies rock, without it, its just an ordinary gingerbread cookie.

even better the 2nd day I used cardamom cooked in the half and half instead of the juniper berries, and that was great!

I agree with others that more spice was needed. I almost tripled the spices and they were the best gingerbread cookies I've ever made. The glaze is great but the cookies stand up fine without it. Still, I think it's worth getting juniper berries for. The texture is fantastic: crispy and melt-in-your-mouth.

Everything that is good about Christmas all stuffed in to a cookie. Delicious. I upped the ginger to 1 tbsp and added a little bit of cloves; also 10 minutes was perfect baking time.

These cookies get rave reviews every time I serve them. They've become my favorite Christmas cookie. I did not let the Juniper/cream mixture sit for 5 hours this time, only 1, and the Juniper flavor was still present and they were as tasty as always. Also, cookies maintained their shape during the baking process. They didn't puff up or spread out at all. Love this recipe!!!!

I only gave 3 stars because the gingerbread recipe as printed is waaaay too flavorless for my tatstes -- no wonder some of the other reviewers thought the juniper icing was overpowering. I basically tripled the spices, and thought the juniper in the glaze was brilliant and perfectly balanced. I brought these cookies to a party and everyone loved them. I will definitely make these again! I used: 3tsp ginger, 2 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves, and I used dark molasses instead of light. My 2.25 cups of flour weighed in at 300g. I also did half butter, half shortening, because I didn't have enough butter on hand.

Excellent gingerbread. The glaze was good too. An unusual flavor, but good. I might try to tone it down a little next time b/c I felt it competed with the gingerbread a little too much. But I will definitely make again.

Very good. Made without the icing nor berries and still had a nice sweetness. Easy to make.

So easy to make and so yummy! The juniper berries gave them a really nice piney flavor that was subtle and yet distinctly unique.

Everyone I've made these cookies for absolutely loves them. The gingerbread is a very nice one, and the glaze is really special.

Good, mild gingerbread cookie, the icing makes it special.

I really enjoyed making these cookies, and I love the presentation and unusual juniper flavor. They are not at all difficult to make. I used about half the juniper berries called for with no adverse effect.

This is a good gingerbread cookie with an unusual but tasty icing. Don't be alarmed if the juniper flavor seems too strong and medicinal when you first make the icing, it seems to mellow out once it's on the cookies.

These only needed 10 minutes in my oven or they came out burned. Dough was sticky - I had to add some flour to make it managable.

The juniper frosting is great! Makes for a real "wintery" flavor. But 12 minutes was too long in my oven. I knocked it down to 10 min. Can't wait to make them again!
