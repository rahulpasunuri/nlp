I've made these about 4 times in the last three weeks. It's the recipe I use in my little side baking biz and people love them! I end up yielding 24 tarts out of the recipe. I use regular sized muffin tins and spray them well w Pam. I also bake the empty pastry shells on their own for about 3 1/2 mins then fill and cook for approx. another 32 mins. I find they're too hard to get out of the tins and the shells not quite sturdy enough if I don't pre-bake the pastry. Also, when I make the entire recipe and want to do 1 doz w pecans and 1 doz without, I make 1 1/2 times the filling since the non pecan tarts take up much more of the filling. The bourbon makes it nice and different. I'm not a huge fan of butter tarts, but everyone I bake them for loves them!

I wanted to give this recipe a '4' - it's quite good BUT - it's very rich - SO I think the single serving size of 4" tin is way too large - I would make these as tartlettes next time. I do like the shortbread crust lots...BUT I couldn't taste the bourbon - so I would up the bourbon by 4 to 5 T...I also accidentally omitted the 1/3 c butter - BUT it was not missed at all since the crust is practically solid butter!

Lovely, lovely. Substitued my standard pate brisee crust and it was still just terrific. Perfect for winter.

This is such a quick and easy recipe. I make either one large pie or small tarts. I also use a premade crust which nobody ever knows the difference. When in a hurry why not? Perfect for Thanksgiving, holidays and winter.

These are quite good. I especially liked the dough and flavor that the bourbon gave the filling.

After making and tasting, I remain on the quest for the (to me) perfect pecan pie. Perhaps I am an inadequate baker, but I was unable to get the filling to gel to the extent I find it in restaurant pies. Restaurant pies, at $4.50+ a slice, are my ideal here. Flavor was delicious (a real bourbon kick)... it's the texture I seek.

I agree - best ever. I made it easy by using Pet Ritz pie crust (large 9 1/2"). Just fill bottom of pan w pecan halves - about 1 1/2-2 cups. Mine a bit runny - will add 1 Tbl of flour next time. Otherwise don't change a thing! Husband had to have 2 pieces and also said best ever!!

One of the best pecan tarts I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a LOT)! I wanted to make one large tart only and so I cut the crust recipe by a third and made the full filling recipe. There was still so much it made a full 12" tart and a 9" (next time, I'll just cut the whole recipe in half with the exception of the pecans; you need at least two cups in the 12" tart). I baked for about 45 mins. It was outstanding. Everyone at our 6- person dinner party had seconds and we polished off the whole thing in one sitting.
