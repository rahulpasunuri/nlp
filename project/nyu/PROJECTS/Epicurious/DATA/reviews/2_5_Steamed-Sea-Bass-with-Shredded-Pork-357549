A good recipe once the fish was added. After making the onion oil. Why not add the onions (that you are told to refrigerate) to the fish along with the pork?

Apologies for the inadvertent omission. The correction to the recipe has been made. The recipe calls for 1 whole sea bass, 1 1/2 pounds, purchased live, then cleaned by the fishmonger. -Esther Sung Assistant Editor Epicurious.com

I would omit the pork and substitute soaked dried mushrooms sliced thinly after soaking. Place on top of fish before steaming it.

Who writes these? How do I shred raw pork? When do I cook it? When do I put it on the fish? What fish? How much? Perhaps Eileen Yin-FeiLo should consider a proof reader.

Might be better that the fish is left out. This is pretty weird. I did do the fish and it was pretty good. I couldn't bring myself to put shredded pork on it.
