Fairly easy to make and a wheat-free recipe which is good when you have a large group. I found that I have to bake longer before the consistency firms up. Make it a day or two ahead and it will dry out a bit. For easy serving, cut into 16 pieces and put on doilies on a platter since it is messy to cut.

I've made a lot of nice chocolate desserts, but to me, this one just didn't measure up. I followed the recipe precisely, and I believe I achieved the intended result, but it just wasn't as good as many other chocolate creations we've tried. It's just ridiculously rich - so buttery that it tastes greasy. The consistency leans more toward fudge than cake, but not in a good way - it's a mealy sort of fudge. I cut it into 16 pieces, and no one finished theirs - it was just too heavy to be pleasant. There are better ways to use up quality ingredients. I found this torte to be less than the sum of its parts.

Wow this was so delicious. I'm wondering what other people experienced as the consistency for this? I ended up with a very creamy, almost fudge like consistency for my torte. The flavor and smoothness was decadent and delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

My sister-in-law made this for a dinner party we were all at over the weekend, and it was so amazingly delicious & chocolatey that I'm now coming to Epicurious for the recipe so I can make it for a party tonight. Yum yum yum, I can't wait!!

Made this for my 30th birthday and it was wonderful. Also, its so dense (in a good way) it can easily serve a large group. Will make it again for sure and be extra careful to wrap the spring-form - only a few drops of water got in but no damage done.

Exceptional and not terribly difficult to make. However, a warning regarding wrapping the springform pan. Be really careful to wrap the saran wrap several times around. Mine leaked and I had to salvage it by transferring to another pan. The result was "torn apart" pieces but the the flavor was still wonderful.

Got great review from my wife as I made it for her birthday. The bath water is just a larger pan filled with about half inch water where you place the 9" pan. Will do again

I took this to a dinner party and everyone raved. I served it with freshly whipped cream and raspberries. I left the half we didn't eat and found out later my friend froze it and served it several weeks later at another dinner to more raves...she thought it may have been even better!

This is a delicious dessert! It serves 16 easily. Everyone loved it. It is dense but creamy. I served it with sliced strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream. I find raspberries to be too bold, I liked the smoothness of strawberries with the chocolate. The recipe is very easy to make. I used chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet squares and I did not chop them. They melted easily.

Such a great recipe! Super simple too. My only suggestion is that you have all the ingredients ready as listed - I had a short amount of time and didn't account for chopping 12 squares of chocolate. But other than that - so awesome. It got rave reviews at a dinner party and lots of requests for seconds. I served THIN slices with homemade whipped cream and fresh raspberries.

it's very good recipe, very creamy, and rich. Add a scoop vanilla ice cream to it, to make this torte even better. Good torte

Dense and chocolatey, the water bath gives it a very silky texture. Use good chocolate because it will make or break the flavor. Extremely rich so serve it with something light to break up the intensity!
