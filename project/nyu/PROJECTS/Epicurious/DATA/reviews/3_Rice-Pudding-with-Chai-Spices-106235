Definitely halve the sugar, and I would halve the cardamom too. The flavor is STRONG. The chai theme is quite nice, but I did have a problem with the consistency when it cooled. It's glucky. If you don't eat it when hot, it's not really servable after that.

I quite enjoyed this. I served as the afters for a meal of lamb madras with plain naan, aromatic rice, vegetable curry and channa masala. It was the perfect compliment to the meal.

I am sure this would have been better if I had measured the spices instead of dumping in so many the pudding turned brown. It was a good lesson for me.

This was "okay"... and by that I mean just fine. I did 1/2 tsp of vanilla, a full tsp of cardamom, and simmered the cinnimon and ginger in w/ the milk. Also added some toasted almond slivers to the final product. However, I didn't serve it immediately after finishing it, when I think it's at it's best. the flavor was good, but the arborio rice got too gluteny for me, and the result was pretty gummy and dry. Rather unsatisfying, but if you were going to serve it right away (like within 10 minutes of it coming off the stove), then I think you'll enjoy this recipe.

This was quite good, but just to reiterate: use LESS sugar! I halved the recipe and the 1/3 cup was still far too sweet. I only added vanilla, orange zest and cinnamon; the flavor was good despite the sweetness, but as I mentioned, I'll add less sugar next time!.

I've made this recipe twice, and it's been great both times. I think it's best with cinnamon sticks and pieces of fresh ginger added during the cooking process, then removed at the end, so the flavors don't get too strong. If I had cardamom pods, I'd do the same with them. I like it sweet, but did cut back slightly on the sugar. Thought it was delicious the next day after being refrigerated overnight -- I made sure it was nice and thick when cooked, so the liquids wouldn't separate when chilled. I plan to try it with a star anise in the boiling milk next time, since I include that with my chai spices (my chai recipe includes a couple of peppercorns and a small bay leaf, but I think I'll skip those!)

I love this recipe but also thought it was a little sweet. I might try some maple syrup or honey next time, which is what I use to sweeten my Chai tea. I also used fresh ginger, grated in early in the simmering process. I might cut back on the spices a little - perhaps too much allspice.

Great recipe.I've made this just like its writen, and also with slight variations. Either way, its really good. You can add currants or raisans, fresh ginger grated (But add it early!)Substatute a little coconut milk for the regular stuff, etc. As another reviewer suggested, I cut the sugar in half and used a full tablespoon of cardamom, which is great if you want it to taste more like chai and less like your run of the mill sugary desert. I also used cinnimon sticks instead of the grated stuff(Again, add early so it can boil with the sticks in it).

tasty but too sweet - definitely cut the sugar in half!

Excellent choice for ginger and spice fans. I used coconut milk, and it worked great. I also recommend throwing in some cardamom pods, and fresh ginger to spice it up even more.

This was pretty decent the day I made it, while still warm. Once you put it in the fridge, however, it becomes vile. I will not make it again.

YIKES! This was just way too pungent - the ginger was overbearing. It actually made my mouth pucker after each bite. My husband who loves rice pudding hated it. We ended up dumping it. Oh, well I can't love all the recipies!

Very simple and delicious! I used soft-diced ginger from The Baker's Catalog and added it and all the spices while the rice was simmering to fully activate the flavors. Also threw in a handful of currants and slivered almonds. Nicely spicey, good change from regular rice pudding.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I also added vanilla, some almond extract and about a half cup of cream in addition with the milk. I skipped the whipping cream at the end and it was totally delicioso!!!!

This dish is creamy and tasty beyond compare. It is simple to make and with little attention it still turns out sweet and flavorful. Highly recommended.

Too sweet by far! I also had other problems as a result of tinkering with the recipe -- didn't have allspice, used ground ginger instead of crystallized, used whole cardamom seeds taken from green pods, and added vanilla -- but nothing I did or didn't do would have affected the taste. Next time I make this I'll cut the sugar in half.

I know its silly, but I actually used Chai flavored soy milk and it came out really well. I was VERY happy. So if you (or your guests) don't like dairy, this still works, which is great...

I really liked this but think the recipe needs a few changes. First, I added a tsp of vanilla--definitely a must! And I doubled the cardamom since that's such an important flavor in chai. I think there's too much ginger in it--the flavor is too dominent in the pudding. I will definitely cut down on that in the future. Also, I might try to substitute some strongly brewed black tea for some of the milk (not more than a cup). I think that would give it an even stronger chai flavor.

Very tasty! Couldn't find cardamom today in the supermarket, so I just left it out, and it was delicious anyway. The crystallized ginger adds a wonderful flavor (as opposed to plain ground ginger) and the whipped cream on top is a nice addition. This recipe is great!

Took this camping with us, (made ahead and kept well, in the cooler.) It seized up a bit, so just added a little more milk as I was reheating. Since I was camping, I brought a can of whipped cream (usually a huge NO NO in my house!) Yummy and so comforting on a cold night in the woods! Now that's camp food!

Didn't have cardamom so added extra cinnamon and ground ginger. Absolutely delicious - especially for a chai tea lover. The pudding base is delicious too. Next time I might try adding different spices and some dried fruit.

I have now made this dish three times. I find it's a great comfort food. Also, while whole milk is nice, I have made it successfully with fat free milk (sometimes you just use what you have available).

This had a very delicious flavor to it. I don't know if it was just me but I had to cook the rice a bit longer than the recommended time (and even at that it didn't seem to have the right creamy texture). I will definitely try it again though!

A delicious, easy desert that strays from the usual. A must for chai lovers! I think my cooking time was a bit off also, but just watch, test and adjust and you'll be fine.

I made this even though I didn't have any ground cardamom. I just replaced it with ground ginger. I finished it off with a "brulee" topping and everyone raved about it. It was also very easy to make. I'm just getting ready to make another batch.

I'm not sure what happened. My pudding was done 15 minutes before it was supposed to be and actually ended up overdone. It became very dense and "set up". Way too stiff to eat the next day. I will try again, but with more liquid and less cooking time. Spices were great though, and I doubled the cardamom.

This was my first ever attempt at rice pudding and it turned out to be very easy and tasted oh so good. Lots of stirring but well worth the effort. Boyfriend was speechless after first spoonful, roommates said they would like it better w/o the exotic spices, so know your guests. If you have any leftovers (doubtful) they are much better warmed up.
