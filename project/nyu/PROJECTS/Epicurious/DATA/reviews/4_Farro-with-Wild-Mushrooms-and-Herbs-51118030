I made half this recipe for four of us - SOOO good!! The mixture just works together flavor-wise. I used shiitakes and crimini mushrooms and more of them. I didn't do the herbs and that would have made it even better especially the chives.

Outstanding! I only made one cup of farro because I was cooking for two people, but I didn't half the rest of the recipe (except the butter). The flavor was so rich! It was great with a simple baked chicken. Also very easy to prepare, even though it looks like a lot of effort for a weeknight side dish.

Excellent side dish with pork roast. Needs a little extra so I added some garlic.
