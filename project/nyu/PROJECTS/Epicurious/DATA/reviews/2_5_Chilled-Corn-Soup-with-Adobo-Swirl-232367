sorry, that was 4 corn to 3 water.

the 1:1 ratio of corn to liquid is a bit much for water. Serve warm or cold, up to you. I prefer hot. The Adobo was a fun touch for a cold day. I enjoyed it. use this base recipe instead for a 4 corn to 1 water ratio. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Fresh-Corn-Soup-103702

I took into account the suggestions, serving it hot, and not blending all the corn for added texture and found this dish quite delightful. Although I wasn't a fan of the adobe sauce.

tried this twice it somehow is too bland almost no flavor except for the chile swirl it is definitely better if you grill the ccrn and actually the onion also I have tried toalter this to make it work but i think it is too much water and not enough punch for a cold soup

I found this soup bland and didn't enjoy it cold. Will have to try suggestions to serve it warm, but am not likely to make it again.

I made this soup using leftover grilled corn and homemade chicken stock. Taking the advice of other cooks who rated it, I reserved a bit of the soup before pureeing to give it a more interesting texture and also took their advice and served it hot. It was Fabulous and my husband, daughter and I all loved every spoonful. I can't wait to have leftover grilled corn again so I can whip up another batch. It's ridiculously easy and quick to make. I'm calling my version "Grilled Corn Soup with Adobo Swirl."

I agree with reader from Appleton, this recipe tastes better when warm. I also left some corn unblended, it makes it more interesting.

Try boiling frozen corn in half broth, half medium salsa. I add some cream and cheese to the soup, and serve hot with a garnish of crumbled tortilla chips, cheese and hot sauce in the center.

This is the one and only recipe I have tried from Bon Appetit that I haven't liked. The soup was very bland and smelled like baby food. Sorry!!
