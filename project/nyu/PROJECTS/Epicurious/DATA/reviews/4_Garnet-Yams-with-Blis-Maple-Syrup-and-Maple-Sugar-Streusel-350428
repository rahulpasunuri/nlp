Great recipe with rave reviews from harsh Thanksgiving crowd in Dubai. I accidentally used maple syrup instead of maple sugar for the topping while reading the recipe too fast, and while presentation was damaged (looked like a gooey mess as opposed to a streusel), taste was still excellent.

Yummy! This recipe is a keeper. I have never been a fan of sweet potato but my husband requested it for Thanksgiving. Per my sister I pre-baked them in the oven the day before for a shorter cooking time on the Big day.

Mine is still in the oven, but I wanted to let people know that Trader Joe's sells maple sugar at a very reasonable price, and you can also get it at Whole Foods.

Delicious! I didn't have maple sugar, so I used a bit more brown sugar (which I did not pack -- the sweetness was perfect and balanced with the maple syrup mixture). Soft butter also worked fine without taking the time to melt. Thought it would be a bit heavy with the butter, but it's just fine, will definitely make again.

Even though I screwed up by putting the topping on right at the beginning rather than part way through the cooking process, these were still amazing. I believe these were the best yams I've ever had.

These were hands down the Best Yams I have ever had. They almost had a dessert -like flavor, yet the worked well with the rest of a conventional T. G. menu.

Made this for Thanksgiving 2011 and it was a huge hit! This is an excellent compromise for the marshmallow loving yam eaters and those who prefer a more sophisticated less kitschy dish. I added chopped pecans and a bit of vanilla. Also, I had no apple cider vinegar on hand so I used red wine vinegar and the juice of half an orange. I did not have maple sugar, just used a bit of maple syrup in the streusel topping. I will definitely make this again next year!!!

I thought I hated yam dishes because the only yam dish I'd been exposed to was yams with horrid melted marshmallow on top, which to me was ridiculously too sweet. But, I was hosting Thanksgiving this year and had to do a yam dish (or else there might be rioting) so I made this one and I loved it! I reduced the total sugar in the streusel by 1/3 cup, and I thought it was totally delicious and the perfect sweetness and crunch complement to the yams. I think other people liked it too but, there fans of the marshmallow version who perhaps it wasn't sweet enough for.

This has become a staple at our large family Thanksgiving meal. In fact everyone just expects us to bring this dish! I added one personal touch that absolutely sets this apart. I make a vanilla-maple sugar meringue to pipe on top in a lattice. Simply amazing!!!

The texture of the streusel does not work with the yams. It's mealy and clumpy. And, it is far too sweet. Of the many dishes on last night's table, this one yielded by far the most leftovers.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving. Prepared 1- 1/2 recipe as we had 13 for dinner. Only changes: I did not have Maple sugar so I used Muscavado sugar that I had on hand and added chopped Pecans to the streusel as well as a pinch of nutmeg and cloves. Based on others reviews that it was better the next day and the streusel crisped up, I prepared the night before and covered the dish tightly in foil and baked. Removed foil, let cool then recovered with foil and refrigerated. Baked again the next day to warm up and kept foil on during this time. Was absolutely a huge hit and I loved it. It's a keeper.

OMFG! i never liked yams before i had these, they were the star of our thankgsiving table this year, everyone was raving about them! I did have maple sugar so i just substituted with brown sugar.

My family and I never cared for sweet potatos until I decided to find a new recipe. This is it. This will be my third year making these. Eveyone loves them including my two young kids and my brother-in-law who is kind of a food snob (gormet chef). Instead of the maple surgar I use a mix of turbano surgar and dark brown surgar.

Wonderful recipe that I've used the last couple years, and will this year as well. The topping is crunchy and not-too-sweet, and the potato mixture becomes molten and decadent underneath.

I can't stop making this dish! I love yams and I love this recipe. I made it for a Christmas party and could've made two it disappeared so fast. The men were commenting to their wives how good it was and the next morning I had 2 email requests for the recipe. I don't have the Blis syrup so one time I added a bit of bourbon just for fun and depth. I finally ordered some maple sugar - I had been winging it like other reviewers, using white, brown sugars w/maple syrup for the topping, but tonight I'm using the real thing, though it's hard to imagine liking it more than I already do. I've always preferred my yams baked simply in butter/brown sugar but here I am making this for the 4th time since T'giving!

This was good but not as fabulous as I expected. Several dishes at our early Christmas dinner yesterday were demolished. Half of this remained. I do like the garnet yams -- have never had them before -- but I wasn't crazy about the sugary topping. It was better after microwaving leftovers today. The topping softened, melded with the potatoes and seemed less sweet.

To JBScanlan of BC. It is important that you use a red garnet yam. A sweet potato will have a lower moisture content and that might explain the chewy texture of your streusal. I would say blanch or lightly pre cook the grated sweet potato for the topping to get a little extra moisture in it. That may resolve the sticky issue. Otherwise I found this to be an excellent addition to the family thanksgiving table.

This dish was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner this year. Everyone loved it. The recipe is incredibly easy to follow and didn't require any modifications (in our opinion). Very delicious and we'll be making this every year from now on.

I made this last night as part of my "trial run Thanksgiving" before the actual event. My word, this dish is GOOD! I converted several non-yam fans (including myself) to lovers! Every one of my guests commented that this was a major hit!

You will never try another yam recipe for turkey day again! This is a hit! It's the perfect solution for anyone who likes yams, but doesn't like the way everyone else does it. For complaints about the streusel or the recipe in general, I can't see how the recipe was followed right. Made this several times, never had a problem. It's a perfect, perfect, recipe.

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe but the streusel is like glop and it's so chewy that I fear fillings will pop out! And the grated potatoes don't seem to have cooked enough. Any clue about whether the ratios are correct on the streusal? It's just too greasy as written.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and it was the favorite dish among everything else that we served. I highly recommend using Blis syrup, as the depth of flavor the aging and the bourbon yields, will not be found in other maple syrups, even high quality ones.

Made this for Thanksgiving, always want to try something new, and these did not disappoint. The Blis syrup is worth the investment. So delicious it could be a dessert.

I chose to make this recipe because I happened to have some maple sugar in the cupboard and hadn't tried it yet. I'll definitely be doing these again. A bit too sweet perhaps, but that is easily remedied.

Normally I don't care for the traditional Thanksgiving sweet potato thing with the marshmallows but I thought I'd give this a try for Thanksgiving (convinced I didn't like sweet potatoes!) This was absolutely delicious. Will be making this one again and again.

Totally awesome! I need to find a cheaper source for maple sugar though, or substitute brown sugar. I have made this several times and its a hit with everyone. It keeps for a few days too, the topping just gets crunchier when you reheat it.

Wow! Rave reviews on this dish! I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner, what a hit. Could not find maple sugar, not even at health food stores so I used same amount of brown sugar.

This turned out really well. Disregard any concerns that it bakes up messy--that didn't happen when I made this. Even if it did, it would be worth the dirty dish :}.

I have made this twice,and it has been a hit both times. It is sweet, but we like it that way. I agree the maple sugar is worth the expense. I used maple syrup, but did not find the brand recommended. It is easy to make and really very good.

My 14 year old would eat this every night if I would make it. He had three helpings on Thanksgiving and finished it off the next day. I thought there was too much topping which was too sweet. Next time, I will use more shredded sweet potato in the topping and less sugar.

These were phenomenal! I cut the recipe in half, so perhaps that is responsible for the overwhelming ratio of the crisp to the yams, I would recommend using a little less of it, but overall these were wonderful. They are very sweet though and I couldn't even go near the dessert table after a helping of these. Do NOT skip out on getting the maple sugar, it MADE these! I realize it is expensive, but save it and use it for next Thanksgiving or around Christmas. Definitely a recipe worth trying out.

This dish was the hit of my Thanksgiving. It was the only dish with no leftovers. I did 5 rows of potatoes and it came out fine. really good and was asked to make 2 of them for next year.

I think these were the best dish we had on thanksgiving. They were wonderful, I loved the streusel topping and the maple syrup added just the right touch. I read the initial review a couple weeks ago and couldn't wait to make them because I think this area should be used to review the actual recipe and not the photo. Besides that, I think the photo makes them look rustic and not all perfect, just like things I make at home look.

I agree...the photo has no relation to how delicious (and not messy) this recipe is. Didn't have maple sugar so I substituted regular sugar and about 2 tablespoons additional maple syrup. Great!

I made this this last thanksgiving and they were quite a hit. My sister called them "coffee cake yams" (because of the yummy streusel on top) and told me that this meant that I'd have to be bringing them every year. Regardless, the strusel topping turned out great, I had no problems with it being hard. I did use a pastry cutter instead of my fingers, because that's what a pastry cutter is for! In addition, I put a little more yams (4 lbs instead of 3.5) and about the amount of sauce called for plus about half again of the sauce recipe. But very good - and the maple sugar really made the dish!

As a reluctant sweet potato or yam cook or eater I approached this recipe with modest expectations. At least it wasn't a lot of work I thought. Boy was I surprised at the outcome. It was pretty, delicious and very popular with our Thanksgiving Day crowd. I always figure if something gets mostly eaten at that meal with so much competition, it gets a 4 forks rating, so it does. I made it exactly as written.

I made this for Thanksgiving after just about giving up on yams altogether. People in my family who don't even like yams liked this! I made a smaller version with 4, 2" yams and using about 3/4 of all other ingredients for a 8x8x2" baking dish. Substituted white wine vinegar and replaced maple sugar with brown sugar. I used real maple syrup as directed though and it was delicious! The recipe is easy and it was nice to be able to do the prep in the morning and then minimal effort to finish up amid all the holiday rush. My sister wants the recipe and I'll definitely make this again.

My mom made this for Thanksgiving dinner at her place and it was outstanding!! We all raved. I love yams & this was easily one of the best ways I have ever had them prepared. Yes, the baked-on splatter in the photo looks a little menacing, but don't let that stop you from trying an amazing dish.

I too have to say IGNORE the photos. This is by far one of the best yam dishes I have made. Everyone loved it! Mine came out beautiful. Didn't have the maple sugar, so just used white sugar and then added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup to the streusel!

Ignore the photos, this is amazing and bakes up beautifully! I made it over the weekend for an early Thanksgiving feast involving some friends and it was the first thing to go. I couldn't find maple sugar so I just doubled the amount of brown sugar and it was delicious. I've been looking for a knockout way to cook sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving and this is it! I will make this again and again!
