I made these for a Hannukah party with the relish and salsa, they were a great hit. Just make sure, as with regular potatoe latkes, that you drain the carrots/potatoes after grating and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.

Fabulous! Following reviewer advice, I drained the carrots really well. Then I mixed the batter and refrigerated it for a while, then drained off a bit more liquid and added a little more flour. They turned out perfect, and the apple salsa is so good with them!

I accidentally added the equivalent of 7 tablespoons of ginger (had downsized the recipe...luckily) but regardless, I'm sure these are amazing with less ginger than I put. I forgot to dry the carrots so just added extra flour and they cooked just fine. Can't wait to make them again!

I must've done something wrong because these didn't come out so well. I probably didn't squeeze enough water out of the carrots, because they fell apart in the pan. Midway through cooking, I added a fourth egg, and that helped. Ultimately, the ginger flavor was way too overpowering. I'll try again...

delicious recipe, and super simple. i skip the relish & salsa, and just serve these with sriracha--it goes great with the ginger flavor.

These were delicious! I loved how the ginger and carrot balanced each other so perfectly. I did not make the celery relish based on reviews, but the apple salsa was a perfect compliment. I would use more jalapeno next time (or perhaps mine just wasn't that spicy).

I only had half the amount of carrots, so I added sweet potato and had some leftover freshly ground coriander seeds from the Cumin Scented Beet Latkes and added it which cut the ginger taste enough for my fiance's taste, but too much for me. Definitely make the beet latkes and the salsa, the three make great flavor contrasts.

Wow - I made these and the beet latkes with the relish and salsa -- they were TERRIFIC. Used food processor to grate everything, including apples for salsa; drained and squeezed dry the carrots and beets very very thoroughly (a crucial step); they were the hit of the evening, and tasted great as leftovers the next day. The salsa was much more than needed, but so good we'll enjoy trying it out as an accompaniment for other things for the rest of the week. The relish, while interesting, was unnecessary.

Great.

They were easy, great, and the apple-jalapeno relish was really good with them. We wished that we'd mixed the flour mixture with the carrots, then done a second drying of the carrots before adding the egg, as the flour brings out some of the moisture. (but we added another egg instead and it made an interesting version). also putting the carrots in the food processor made things so much easier.

We made these for a Hannukah party yesterday, and they were divine. People loved them. We did not make the side relishes/dips. They're great on their own.

I loved them, but my kids didn't (hence the 3 stars). The hint of ginger was just the right touch.

i just made double recipes of this and the beet latkes. they were so delicious. although i was not so happy with the presentation as the other cook said. i had to brown them to be cooked and i loved the bright red and orange in the picture. also i am freezing it and then popping it into the oven right before my party. hope that works well.

What I meant to say is that this dish was labor intensive if making the relish and salsa. It took a lot of time for relatively few latkes.

Found this to be very labor intensive, but worth it. Yummy and makes a nice presentation! The relish and salsa that accompanied this recipe were also delicious, though not necessary in such generous amounts (could probably make half of what's called for). The latkes have a nice flavor by themselves.
