I usually add some basil as well. When I take it to parties or serve it to guests at home there is never any left and I always get asked for the recipe. Don't expect this to taste like the store bought ranch dressing or dip because it is fresh and not full of chemicals you don't need. It just tastes good!

This dip is the best! The fresh herbs really come through. I always make the day before. It's been the hit at several parties and is great with crudite or potato chips. Fresh from the garden flavors and a cinch to make.

Bland and boring.

I own a Restaraunt and Catering Service in a very small town in Kentucky, I tried this dip for a small party and got so many compliments. I now serve it on a weekly basis in bulk and it is still incredible. The first time we tried it I used dried parsley, which is suitable if that is all you have access to, but fresh has a much more distinctive taste. I do strongly suggest you make it at least 1 day in advance for best taste. I would recommend this to anyone! My three kids are also crazy about it, so I have to make them some at home in order for my business stash not to disappear!

making it again right now! fresh ingredients and home made taste, honestly don't know how someone who's a cook could consider suggesting MSG laden store bought dip as a better alternative.

This was an easy and tasty dip. Compared to the prepared supermarket dips, it had a fresh taste that was very nice. Would make a good starting point for the addition of other flavors.

This is a ranch dip both adults and kids can enjoy!

Super delicious!!! I used Fage 2% plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream (they're very close in taste and mouth-feel), and scallions instead of chives since that was what I had on hand. It was delicious! Giving the dip a little time to meld before eating is imperative. Since for me this was a use-up-the-leftovers-from-other-recipes dish, I used tomatoes, carrots, celery and the white parts of bok choy for dipping.

I've served this at a couple of parties and it went over well. It makes a good basic ranch dip, nothing overly special but pretty tasty. I used scallions instead of chives which worked well.

Worst dip ever.

This recipe was enjoyed by all adults and kids at the new years party I served it at. I had to double the recipe, and it was still delicious! Maybe next time I will also put some diced red and yellow peppers in it to add some pizzaz.

Very good. I agree - this was even better the next day.

Simple to make with a nice flavor. Easy to adjust to personal preference. Great alternative to thousands of vegetable dip recipes with dill.

I loved this dip. It hands down beats that stuff in the envelope. It was so simple and I love the idea of adding my own fresh ingredients...have you checked the amount of salt in the envelope stuff? One thing I did notice was that it got better as time went on. I think the reviewer below didn't let the flavors meld long enough. I was still eating this one week later and it was more delish than the first day I served. Enjoy!

I wish I could give this ZERO forks. It was easy to make, but had a really flat taste. I would not make it again and would only feed it to children if I wanted to harm them. Save yourself the effort and just buy some ranch dip--I guarantee the store bought stuff will taste much better (and is that ever supposed to be the case?).

I've never cared that much for ranch dressing. However, this is great. It was a hit with everyone at Thanksgiving! Easy and good!

This is a simple and tasty dip that is enjoyed by children of all ages. I served it with a huge platter of vegetables at a family gathering, and there were no leftovers. When I had unexpected guests two days later, I mixed up another batch, with similar results. It tastes best if it has a few hours to sit in the refridgerator for the flavors to blend, but it's plenty tasty even right away.

This is just what is says it is - and just what I was looking for - an easy to make and good basic ranch dip with stuff I have in the house all the time. I think adding bacon, smoked salmon, curry, etc would add easy variety.
