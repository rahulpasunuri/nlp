This recipe needs doctoring. Turned out excellent with the following changes - doubled the shallots. Used 1/2 cup of sherry and 1 cup chicken stock. No wine. Added raw minced shallot and garlic clove at end. Paired very well with ham and balsamic dijon glaze.

This sauce is really yummy and it makes plenty. I used less butter than recomended and slightly less cream. With the peas and the mushrooms the flavor is very earthy and delicious. When I make it next time I am going to try it with asaragus.

I think the idea behind the recipe is good. However, I would take out the wine since the it makes the sauce way too watery. Instead of butter , I would use a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil...I wouldn't use garlic either. I live in Italy and Italians barely use garlic when they cook pasta!...I would add fresh thyme.....and a hint of nutmeg I would also make sure that when I cook the pasta, I would put enough salt into the boiling pan...Finally, I'd add some fersh grated Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese

This recipe is more than bland: none of the flavors work together. I found I had to add lots of crushed red pepper, some stock, some grated pecorino, and it still is nothing special. I feel the liquids made everything too soupy. Would definitely not make again and I'd use the pricey mushrooms in another dish.

This is a great recipe for improvisational cooks; I made it, we loved it - but what I put on the table wasn't even close to what you'd get from following the recipe exactly. I added red pepper to the garlic and shallots, put juice of 1 lemon in with the mushrooms, used 1/4 wine and 1/3 cup vegetable stock, omitted the cream, and used 3/4 cup pecorino romano cheese.

As written, this recipe, as several reviewers have pointed out, is bland, but it can be very tasty with a few modifications. The following suggestions will help: first, make sure the pan is heated to medium-high. The high heat caramelizes the mushrooms, which deepens their flavor. Saute the mushrooms rapidly in the pan, stirring and tossing constantly. Reduce the wine by 1/4 cup, then add 1/4 cup chicken stock after you have deglazed the pan with the wine. Heat, then add the cream per recipe instructions. Add salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper to taste. That should do the trick.

There is one word to describe this meal...bland. I spent a small fortune on all those mushrooms ($2.99 just for 4 oz.)and the sauce just did nothing for the meal. Very disappointing. Maybe a sherry sauce or something tangier would be better. Not worth the effort of cleaning and chopping all the mushrooms.

This was the first thing in Epicurious that I haven't liked. It was bland, and no amount of salt & Pepper could fix it.

Great recipe and even non-pasta lovers really enjoyed this pasta. the flaours combine well to highlight the mildness of the sauce

Needs a lot of salt, but then becomes a delicious dish. I used a whole mixture of different kinds of wild mushrooms, think it would work with any variety. This is not exactly light eating, but nice for an occasional cream and butter treat.
