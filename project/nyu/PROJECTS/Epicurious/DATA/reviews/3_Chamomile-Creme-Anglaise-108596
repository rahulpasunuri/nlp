This sauce was amazing. It's very much like a hollandaise. I used heavy cream instead of half and half. It turned out very rich, but very good. Also, when you return the yolk/sugar mixture to the pan and and the simmering half & half, I used a double boiler and you have to add the mixture slowly and whisk the entire time.
