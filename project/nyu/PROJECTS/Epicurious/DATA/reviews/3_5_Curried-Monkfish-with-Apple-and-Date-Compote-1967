I won't be making this again. Curry needs to be cooked before it gets used. I found the flavor of the raw curry to overwhelm the fish. The compote, on the other hand, was great. I used apple cider instead of water and added more than was called for.

This is a lovely dish. The marinade is suitable for use as a glaze for any meaty tasting baked fish, and it's got a really interesting flavor combination. We agree with other reviewers that the fish should be salted a little before cooking, and the compote requires more liquid than the recipe calls for.

We loved this meal. The only changes I would make next time is to add more apples and less dates. I only used approximately 14 dates and that was too much. I can see why others have paired the chutney with pork and chicken. Really tasty.

I found the recipe incredibly easy to make and that it tasted great in the end. I substituted white raisins for dates (which I didn't have time to buy in the moment) and the compote turned out beautifully. I found that the compote required a good deal more liquid than the recipe called for. I substituted a white wine and stock mixture for the water. I covered the monkfish for the last two minutes of cooking time to get it to cook through properly (likely because my fillets were thicker than those used in the recipe). I will definitely be making this again.

Too sweet! I like sweet/savoury dishes when done right, but with this dish I'd suggest less honey, less dates and not to mention more curry powder to merit the name "curried monkfish".

WOW! THIS IS GOOD! Quick too since i only marinaded the fish for about 45 minutes. I subbed raisins for dates and used apple juice instead of water to simmer the compote. Definitely not your typical fish with lemon herb marinade. A wonderful collision of texture and flavors. I will make it again the next time company comes for dinner too. With advanced prep then a short time to bake i'll definitely be able to enjoy the evening.

This was truly an amazing dish. The compote really complimented the monkfish. I will make this again!

I made this successfully using maple syrup (instead of honey) and mustard (no curry) and pine nuts/raisons in the compote. Could have been fine without the compote, and as mentioned elsewhere, did not need two hours to marinate the fish.

Delicious and really easy to make. Medjool dates are richest and best for the comppote. If you make the compote ahead of time don't overheat it when you rewarm or it'll dry out. You'll find it worth the extra cost and effort to use monkfish rather than substituting some more familiar fish. Monkfish is meaty and succulent, almost more like shrimp or lobster than finfish. A wonderful meal!

This is very good with chicken breasts. Watch though when you cook them because the honey will burn. I just roasted the chicken breasts at 350 for 30 minutes.

This is DELICIOUS! I don't usually cook with butter at all, much less the rather large amount called for by the compote, but it was a special occasion. Because the fruits are so sweet, I'm going to try cooking both the compote and the fish in canola oil next time. If you don't have 2 hours to wait while the fish marinates, don't worry about it--I only marinated it for about 50 minutes and it couldn't have been better. I didn't tell my husband that there was curry in it (he claims to dislike curry); he described it as "heavenly" and gobbled two helpings.

We used Copper River salmon instead of monkfish and it was great. Used half mild curry powder and half spicy, but next time will use all hot and try honey mustard instead of ground.

Very good for such little work. The fish needed some salt though (having it in the compote alone isn't enough.)

delicious. my first time making monkfish and i can't wait to make it again. used dijon mustard instead of grainy. was fantastic. also used less butter and grilled it on the bbq instead of frying it. the only dates i had were medjool dates - decadent!

I have made this a few times. The first time I made it with red snapper fillets and served it with sides of braised chard and basmati rice- excellent! the next time I used cod fillets but the cod was too mild and bland for this dish. As I had leftover apple-date compote, I made it again the next day with chicken breast fillets and served it with braised cabbage and rice (panfry shredded cabbage in a little olive oil and then add some chicken stock, pepper, cover and cook till tender) - totally different but just as enjoyable! However, if using chicken I would use thinner fillets or finish off the chicken in the microwave as the honey in the marinade has a tendency to burn with prolonged panfrying.

This is an inspired dish. I whole heartedly recommend it.

I'm a personal chef, and one of my families raves about this recipe and would eat it every week! I have to agree it's excellent. One difference--I make it with chilean sea bass rather than monkfish, and I bake it in the oven rather than pan fry.

The compote is easy and so delicious. Works great with chicken as well as other firm white fish.
