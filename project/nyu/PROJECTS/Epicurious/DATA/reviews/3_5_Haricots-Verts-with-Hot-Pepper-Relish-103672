Great cool veggie for a dinner party on the hottest day of the summer! Used the leftover relish on a bar-b-que chicken pizza (BBQ sauce, grilled chicken, green onions, relish, and cheddar cheese) - was wonderful!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used red, yellow, and orange peppers, as well as, the serrano (or whatever hot pepper I had in my possession at the time, and used balsamic vinegar instead of cider. I have made it several times and it is always a hit!
