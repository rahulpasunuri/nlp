Wow...what an amazing cake. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problem with the cake falling or the buttercream setting. I did find the orange flavour of the buttercream slightly overpowering so next time I would use less orange peel.

I just made this cake again for another birthday celebration and want to add some comments to my previous review: While it's true that this cake tends to "fall" I'm not so sure that that's a problem. It winds up being a dense and very moist sponge type cake. Everyone loves it. The flavor is really wonderful. And even when the frosting doesn't always get as firm as at other times and can sometimes be relatively "soft" it's still absolutely wonderful and easy to use.

I made this cake several years ago for my grand daughter's birthday and several people commented that it was the best cake they ever tasted. So I decided to make it for my mother- in-law's 90th birthday celebration: I converted it to a two layer 1/2 sheet cake and put the jam, berries and buttercream between the layers. The cake did fall somewhat after baking. My Kitchenaid blender kinda fell apart while I was whipping the egg whites (I mananaged to fix it later) and when I didn't have enough frosting, I made a second 1/2 batch the next day and the egg whites didn't quite firm up so it was very soft. I had to add some confectioner's sugar to the frosting to use it for piping the decorations. In the end, despite all its "imperfections," this cake was beautiful and EVERYONE raved about it and said it was the best cake they'd ever had. One modification I made was I used half vanilla extract and half lemon oil. YUM!!

The flavor of this cake is fantastic. If it hadn't fallen, it would have been a 4 forker. Even though others said it fell, I decided to try it anyway. I'm suspect it has something to do with the air you get from beating the whites and/or the temperature. The buttercream is fantastic. I might try the cake again at a lower temp for a longer time; the buttercream is definitely a keeper. I used smaller pans (but deeper) and had enough leftover cake to use for fill in after I cut it for layering. It got rave reviews at the baby shower I took it to.

Buttercream does not set. Even when cooked to 160F via instant read thermometer. Takes much longer than noted in recipe and will not set, remains a whipped sour cream consistency even when refrigerated. Very unfortunate but the flavor is good.

Re the cake falling problem: I've made this cake a few times. The last time was in the summer...a big mistake. Even though I have central air there must have been enough humidity in the house to bring the cake down as soon as it was out of the oven. Because I was successful the previous 3 times and followed the exact game plan I am pretty sure about the humidity theory. Took it to an outdoor party anyway. No one was the wiser but I did insist on cutting it up asap. I didn't want it to melt!

I made this cake for my friend's soon to be daughter in-law's wedding shower. It was great and so easy to make. I read all the reviews and saw that some people had issues with the cake 'falling'. I left the pans in the oven longer than stated (until the cake pulled away from the pans) and I had no problem with them falling. They were not dry, etc. I did find that I should have shaved off the top of the cake as I had to press the berries into the top of the cake to keep them from rolling off. I made the cake and then put it in the fridge. The day of the shower (before I left for the party) I took the cake out of the fridge and put the berries on. If I let the cake soften I'm sure the berries would have stuck in the icing. I melted the currant jam and brushed it on the berries. When I got to the party the jam was dripping down the sides of the cake. Not what I wanted but the effect was passable. Next time I would put the berries on, brush with the melted jam and them back in the fridge to set. Everyone raved. I would make this one again. Nice sponge/angle type cake. Great for spring time when the berries are in season.

This cake sound very much like the cake I had for my wedding. I am in the process of making it and thought I was doing a good job until the cake came out of the oven....and then "fell". I have read a few reviews on the same thing happening. Did anyone find a way around from this happening????

WOW! I only made the buttercream but it was phenomenal. Followed directions as is, but instead of the orange peel, I just put vanilla extract in place of it. If you are looking for a truly delicious buttercream, try this one!

I made this for my daughter's birthday and the buttercream is as good as it gets. I also have the problem of timing - it certainly takes longer than 3 min. for the egg whites to heat to 160 degrees. And if they are not properly heated, the icing never stiffens up as it should. But the flavor - heavenly! the cake is light and fluffy - and made praise-worthy by the fresh fruit (i did not use any jam).

I made this cake for my mom's birthday back in june 2000, the month the recipe came out in thr magizine. My family loved it, and i have made in time and time again, every time with rave reviews. I even was asked to make it in to a wedding cake and it came out so good.

I've never rated a recipe before, but I couldn't go without praising this dessert. I am not even close to a professional when it comes to cooking or baking and this cake turned out awesome. While it was time consuming for me, it turned out perfect for my son's 6th birthday party - everyone raved about it. I followed the advice of using a thin layer of the raspberry jam and iced the lower portion of the middle and top layers to better hold the cake together. It was perfect. I baked the cakes until they felt firm and they did not fall. I made cupcakes with extra batter (I made a 10" instead of 12" cake)and only did the toothpick test, they all fell. One other caveat . . . keep it cool. I would definitely not make this for an outdoor event in warm weather as the icing is greatly affected by the temperature. As well, I kept the cake chilled until 30 minutes before serving rather than the 1-3 hours. I noticed about 30 min. after serving that the icing on the remaing cake was extremely soft. Regardless, I will definitely make this cake again for a special occasion. I can't believe I made something soooo delicious. Thanks epicurious!!!

I made this cake in one day and it took FOUR hours from start to finish! My only complaint is that my cakes fell flat...not sure why. The frosting and berries made up for it though! The buttercream was tasty and relatively easy to make. The assembly was fairly easy as well and made for a beautiful cake! This recipe is definitely a keeper (assuming next time my cakes come out right)!

I only made the frosting, because the cake looked to involved and the reviews didn't make it look promising. The frosting I made for my son's birthday cake and EVERONE loved it. This is now the only white frosting recipe in my book! It is worth the effort.

I made the buttercream just as the recipe stated and it was incredible! Rave reviews and very easy! I made it 2 days in advance, then refrigerated it. I used the warming/remixing technique in the recipe to bring the texture back and it was perfect!

I made only the cake, not the frosting - though it looks great and I can't wait to try it. The cake as given was way more cake than I wanted to make, so I cut the recipe in half (used 7 extra-large eggs) and baked it in 3 9 in pans to save myself the trouble of halving it later. I also subbed in frangelico for part of the vanilla. It baked up perfectly (took about 25 mins total) with a wonderful sponge texture. Light and lovely. A keeper.

Given the rave reviews this recipe has received, I was very disappointed in the cake itself. The cake fell flat, I rebaked it and it fell flat again. The frosting was delicious and not as time-consuming as I expected though, and I received wonderful compliments overall. When I make this again, I'll use my ordinary sponge cake recipe (which is pretty foolproof) and just make the frosting. The frosting and berries are really a match made in heaven - if only it didn't have so many calories I'd make it often!

I have very little baking experinece, but tried this recipe for my daughter's first birthday ( I made the cake into a three tier castle!) Three weeks later the guests are still commenting on the cake, it was outstanding! The frosting is quite time consuming and needs extra time in the refrigerator, but well worth the effort.

This cake was absolutely fabulous. I had no problems with any part of the recipe, the cream came out amazing, no curdling, I didn't even find it that time consuming. I thought however that the size was too big so I cut down by a third the cake portion and baked it in 9 inch pans but made the same amount of cream. The cake was nice and tall and very firm. I would also recommend that when layering, spread one layer of buttercream, then spread berries, then spread another thin layer of buttercream on the under side of the next cake layer- this helps the cake hold together much better!Also, my tasters thought it was a very light tasting cake, it was a total hit!

I have made this cake multiple times including as a 4 tiered wedding cake (double recipe). Everyone loves how light the cake and the buttercream are. Rather than the jam for filling, I spooned a mixture of thawed frozen and fresh mixed berries, chambourd, and seedless raspberry jam in between the layers (no buttercream in the layers) which allowed the juices to seep into the cake a little. Then topped with mounds of fresh mixed berries glazed with melted raspberry jam. Excellent!

This is why I bake. It was time consuming but so much fun. I've had many past disasters with sponge cakes and this one is incredibly forgiving. I think it is worth noting that most ingredients were very generous: plenty of frosting and berries. I used thin layers of jam because of the previous review and not more than a dollop of melted currant jelly for the top. The cake is overall very sweet and it doesn't need so much jam. A keeper! I'd love to know how to adjust it for 9 inch pans.

A LOT OF WORK! KEEP FROSTING IN FRIDGE BETWEEN USES. NEXT TIME WILL USE 8 OR 10 INCH PANS. MAKE SURE THAT SUGAR IS DISSOLVED WHEN COOKING IN THE EGGWHITES OR ELSE IT WILL BE GRAINY...

The cake was great! I've been searching for an exellent buttercream frosting recipe for ages - and I've found it! I was initially intimidated by the amount of eggs in this recipe, especially in the frosting but it turned out perfect! I made it for a 3-year old's party and she wanted a pink cake- so I used professional gel food colourings and that was no problem. I also used my Wiltons icing tips to design flowers and borders and the icing was a DREAM to work with! Definitely a keeper!

The texture and flavor of the cake was wonderful, however, the raspberry jam overpowered the entire cake. I was disappointed. There are other cakes out there with much less work.

I doubled the recipe and made this cake as one layer of a friend's multi-tiered wedding cake. It was sublime...tender white cake sandwiched between delicate layers of delicious frosting and berries. Everyone loved it and even the caterer asked for the recipe. The extra cake layer is great cubed and used as a base for a trifle.

Amazing!! I made this for a birthday party/baby shower and everyone loved it. One guest said it was the moisted cake she had every had. I made it on a warm, humid day and the icing did not set up that well, but some extra time (1 hour instead of the 30 minutes in the recipe) in the refrigerator did the trick.

I made only the buttercream portion of this recipe. I needed a frosting for a Martha Stewart wedding cake recipe, because her white chocolate buttercream was a disaster. This frosting was a dream. I would leave the orange peel out, though, because it overpowers the white chocolate.

I have never taken time to rate anything, but this cake is fabulous, and worth every minute of your time. It looks beautiful and tastes heavenly; my guests raved about it(and still are). To save time, I used a 7 minute frosting made in my food processor; it was a perfect match.

I made this for a bridal shower and it was spectacular to look at and delicious! This was my first attempt at making a 12" cake and making a buttercream frosting. The cake was very moist and the frosting was fabulous. It looked just like the magazine picture. For anyone unsure of their ability to pull this off, all that I can say is that if I can do it, so can you! It was a big hit!

This was a beautiful cake to present at a dinner party! I would love to make it for my friend's wedding in September, but the bottom 1/4 inch of each layer turned egglike and grayish when baked, although it still tasted great. Does anyone know why that happened? Did I butter the pans too much?

I made this cake for a bridal shower and it turned out fabulous. I cheated a bit by using a yellow cake mix, and it was still delectable. Very moist, and the berries were fragrant and delicious. It did take a half-hour just to get the egg whites beaten to the right consistency for the frosting, but it was worth the effort.

I made this cake for a baby shower and everyone just loved it! It was a very warm day when I made the frosting, so my room temperature butter was really soft. As soon as I started adding the butter to my stiff egg whites they started to get really soupy. I don't think I let the other ingredients cool enough so my frosting came out pretty soft and seem to stay that way. I plan on making this cake again this week, but I am going to try using the sugar syrup method adding to the egg whites, I think they may stay firmer using that method.

I made this as a wedding cake using just picked small strawberries, blackberries and raspberries. It was fantastic! The only problem was getting the icing just right. I had to make it twice to learn the technique and correct temperature. You definitely need to keep the cake refrigerated. The wedding was outdoors and the icing started to melt very quickly. Would make again, but never for an outdoor event.

Since this recipe is time-consuming, DON'T do what I did! I made the cake layers AND the buttercream on Friday, then assembled on Saturday and garnished on Sunday for a birthday brunch that day. My problem was that the buttercream was too hard to spread the next day, so I beat again with electric mixer to loosen up. It started to separate and curdle, so consistency was grainy and still hard to spread. Did not affect the taste, but did alter the look and texture. Next time I would make sure that I had time to frost & assemble 30 minutes after chilling the buttercream as stated. Otherwise everyone loved it and it was still beautiful!

Fabulous cake. I use a little more orange in the frosting, and I put jam on both sides of the cake layer to help cement them together. First time it sort of split apart when cut into thin slices.

This was deliciouse and beautiful. I was so proud to present it! I did have to make the frosting a second time. The first time, I did not wait for the egg whites to reach 160 degrees. It turned out grainy and too soupy. The second time out it was perfect. The problem for me was that it actually took maybe 8-10 minutes for my stove to get the mixture up to 160 degrees, not 3 minutes or so as the recipe indicates. For a special occasion this recipe is fabulous.

I have made this twice (for birthdays) and am making it again next week for a bridal shower. It is time consuming and requires a lot of refrigerator space, but is well worth it. It easily feeds 24 people and is perfect this time of year with berries being in season. And it is delicious and beautiful...what could be better?

Tried this recipe twice, and both times it was much too thin to use as a frosting. The taste is great, but after comparing with other buttercream recipes, I wonder if it needs more butter, or some cream of tartar to support the meringue.
