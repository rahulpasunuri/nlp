This was very good. We went heavy on the dressing and served it on a bed of mixed greens -- fresh kale and endive. Terrific with grilled skirt stake suffocated in a chipotle dry rub.

Simple, light and different. A quick and healthy light sidedish that's a nice alternative to a salad or coleslaw.

Light, tasty, and attractive. Good counterpoint to richer dishes. I used serranos instead of jalapenos, but they were exceptionally mild serranos.

Since we don't have a variety of carrots available, I used a 10 oz. bag of shredded carrots and followed the rest of the recipe. It was a simple, nice tasting summer salad that was perfect for a night at The Hollywood Bowl. Even the guest who doesn't like carrots liked this salad. It's a keeper for us that I'll make again soon.

This was an interesting slaw, with a clean taste, but it seemed missing something in flavor. With the exception of using olive oil made no changes to the recipe. The jalapeno I used was ex-large, about 3" in length and didn't find it to hot -- but did finely minced it. I would probably make it again.

This recipe calls for about 1 1/2 too many jalapenos. Holy cow. Unless you really like it spicy- this will have your lips burning for hours.
