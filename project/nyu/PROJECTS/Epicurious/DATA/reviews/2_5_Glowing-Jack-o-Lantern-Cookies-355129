These are adorable, but 2 cups was WAY too much flour - the dough was falling apart and wouldn't roll properly at all. I would recommend reducing the flour to 1 1/2 cups.

These were cute but a lot of work. I varied it a bit by using 1.5 sticks butter, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup confectioners. I opted for the zest and not the juice of the lemon. I used butterscotch candies which was ok but I thought lemon would have better (20 pieces was good for a batch.) I also used a chopper attachment for my hand blender for the candies. I kept any dough I was not immediately working with in the fridge which helped it from getting too sticky.The taste of the cookie was good but it was kind of a lot of work to make all the cut outs and try to get the candy in there without spilling too much. But they were definitely a show piece and got lots of compliments!

I had the opposite problem-- too much flour. I made 4 batches and if I added the flour slowly I could guage how much was needed-- 2 to 3 tbsp. less than the recipe. I used multi-coloured lollipops, inside a ziploc bag, crushed with a hammer and these worked very well. I found the taste not to my liking, but the twenty 6 and 7 year olds at the party loved them.

I thought the recipe was cute but it doesn't specify what kind of hard candy. I crushed the hard candy to a powder but then it just formed back up and stuck all together.the dough was hard to manage even with a lot of flour. I also tried the funny bones and they did not turn out by directions given. I came to this site for new recipes. not satisfied with how the recipe read and how they turned out! And I been baking for a while,never had this hard of time.
