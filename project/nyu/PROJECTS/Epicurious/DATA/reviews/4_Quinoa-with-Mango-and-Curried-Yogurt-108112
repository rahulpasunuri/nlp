Despite the fact that I was missing quite a few ingredients, this turned out fantastic. The market near me didn't have yogurt (it's just a corner store), so I used sour cream and a little milk. I also didn't have mango or mint - so I suspect that my version was substantially different than the recipe, but everyone still gobbled it up. I doubled the yogurt dressing after reading other reviews and added extra lime juice. I also subbed ginger powder, though I think fresh ginger would add a lot to this. I just made a bunch of quinoa and mixed it with the dressing to taste. I don't understand reviewers who found this bland; I always taste test throughout my cooking and before adding a little more lime and a little more dressing to my quinoa, it was a tad forgettable. This, however, was easily remedied by the extra lime and dressing. I grilled chicken, pulled it apart, and rubbed it with some more curry powder (Frontier brand organic, I bought a pound! on Amazon for under $20 and I would recommend it) and some more lime juice. This yogurt-curry sauce is very versatile and I think it would be delicious tossed with veggies as well. I did add a pepper (green, not red, was what I had on hand) and found that, while it didn't take away from the dish, it didn't really add anything. I (as I always do) toasted the quinoa before cooking it: put some coconut oil in a pot and toss in the rinsed quinoa over medium heat, stir occasionally until it starts to toast and brown. I then followed the two step instructions in this recipe and was very impressed by how the quinoa came out. My roommates devoured this and now I'm hiding leftovers (that I made in secret)!

I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe since I've never eaten quinoa salad with curried yogurt. The flavors came together well though the mint and mango make the dish pop. It was also really easy to make. My boyfriend and I were able prep everything as the quinoa cooked. I substituted the jalapeno for sambal olek and it worked very well. I also used pan roasted almonds instead of peanuts. I really enjoyed this dish for dinner; it has enough protein from the quinoa and nuts.

This is a really terrific recipe that leaves a lot of room for substitutions for things you have on hand-brown rice for quinoa, cashews or almonds instead of peanuts. Many people said they didn't put mint in the dish, but it really makes the dish refreshing, so definitely go for it if you can. I tried the recipe exactly, just made sure to pre taste the jalapeño I had to make sure it wasn't too spicy because I'm a wimp. The next day I added some cilantro and a dash of rice vinegar and I felt that added the additional pop to make this a regular in my rotation. HIGHLY recommend serving with grilled chicken and would also pair nicely with any fish you prefer. I have to say I was sad when I finished off the leftovers and will jump at the chance to make it for a summer BBQ with friends.

Although it is a little labor intensive, but is an excellent dish and a boyfriend fav that is definitely worth the effort. The only change I make is to add shrimp, which makes this a hardy meal. I also double to recipe to ensure that there are enough left overs for a second meal.

This is an awesome recipe and it's also very healthy! The flavors are excellent! I love the combination of the mango, vegetables and spices. This is a great way to cook with quinoa!

Completely delicious! I changed the recipe based on what we had--I used roasted almonds instead of peanuts, cilantro instead of mint, and I added scallions. I left out the ginger and bell pepper. I used black quinoa, which tends to be more crunchy than the regular kind. I thought this recipe would make enough for dinner tonight plus a lunch or two but we ate it all up tonight! Even my 2 year old liked it. I know I made a bunch of changes but I think it would be good either way--the dressing is fantastic!

Just a quick note to "A Cook from New York". Um in calling the cook who wrote this recipe stupid, you should take note that the recipe doesn't tell you to cover the POT with a towel, it tells you to cover the Quinoa, then cover that, with a lid. The recipe is great, reading skills are essentiasl too.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I made as suggested except I did not steam the quinoa, we like it a little more firm. I forgot the lime juice which I think will add to the flavor next time I make it. Also our grocery store was out of mint but it was good without it.

Rating: 2
The heat was nice but the quinoa was a little boring. There was a lot of digging out the mangos (which are alway a hit.)

Rating: 3
I agree, the sauce could be increased, perhaps another 1/2x. I only used 1/2 jalapeno, and there was plenty of heat, also added another bell pepper I used yellow oriental curry and liked the outcome. Note on quinoa in a rice cooker: Soak overnight, rinse and drain. Fill the rice cooker with 3x the amount of water for white rice. (1cup dry quinoa, fill to 3cup line with water)

Rating: 4
Great dish, makes a refreshing summer meal. I added some lime zest to the dish, but I think it could stand some more lime juice/zest. I also had to substitute cilantro which is what I had on hand. Will definitely try mint next time. I also made the quinoa in my rice cooker instead of steaming, and it still tasted yummy to me and the family.

Did not like this at all. The cooking method was overly complex and made the quinoa mushy. Ingredients sound good but don't blend well together. Choked some down and threw away the leftovers.

This is my go to side dish to anything grilled. I use what I have on hand, sometimes mangoes, some times avocados. Hot sauce or jalepenos. Top notch excellent. And because quinoa cooks so fast, it's done in a flash!

Lovely although I would double the dressing - after it sits a while, it absorbs much of it and tastes a bit dry. The dressing itself is quite excellent and so versatile - I plan to use it for curried chicken salad and other salads too. The steaming was a great idea (have made quinoa many times but never thought about doing this - it really gives it a much nicer texture and look)!

Rating: 4
Made this exactly as written except I left out the jalapeno. It was a hit - very nice blend of flavors and textures. I won't be changing a thing next time I make it, and I will be making it regularly from now on. I am worried about finding mangos in the off season, though. Wondering what I could substitute.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful quinoa recipe--a new family favorite. I did not steam the quinoa, but drained it over a bowl and then covered the sieve to get the steaming with one less step! I am allergic to bell peppers, so substituted a couple of baby cucumbers for added crunch. I also cubed up a ripe avocado I had on hand. The leftovers kept for a delicious lunch the next day (I covered the surface of the salad with plastic wrap to prevent browning of the avocados.)

Rating: 1
Without a doubt, this is THE WORST recipe on this site. I don't know what made me think that putting a towel anywhere near an open flame would be a good idea. I don't know what compelled this chef to even recommend this to people I nearly burnt down my house trying to make this. I'm sure the dish will taste great, but even so, this gets one fork for stupidity.

I was already a big quinoa fan, and this is probably the best quinoa dish I have made! Don't worry about the saltiness of the curried yogurt, it's delicious when mixed all together. Many reviewers substituted cilantro for mint, which I imagine is plenty tasty, but the mint really is a perfect fit. I think people associate curry with cilantro, but mint works too! (Ever had mint raita?).

I had my questions about how quinoa would pair with mango and curried yogurt.. But no! This dish turned out absolutely amazing. Added some cucumbers and had to substitute almonds for peanuts. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

Rating: 4
This dish was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as written except that I did not steam the quinoa. I think I might try it the next time I make it to see if it helps keep the grains more separate, as they kind of mushed together - but it was really excellent nonetheless. The other change I made was the addition of cubed poached chicken, which I think is a must. The flavors of the mango, chicken, and curry really work well together, kind of a new spin on traditional chicken salad. Would be excellent with bulgur wheat in lieu of the quinoa as well, I think. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Delicious! The whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts on this one. Followed previous reviewer's suggestion and only made 1 cup quinoa. Used 2 bell peppers and 2 mangos, and added 3 chopped scallions. One jalapeno (no seeds) yields just a kick (wish I hadn't thrown out the seeds). I don't know why so many people substituted cilantro for the mint... the mint is perfect in this dish. A final note: I have made quinoa many times and usually just use the 1:2 ratio and cook until all of the water is absorbed. For this recipe I decided to try the more labor-intensive steaming approach and was disappointed to see that it made very little difference. After all, once you add the dressing and other add-ins, the "fluffy factor" seems irrelevant.

Wouldn't change a thing. This was perfect as is. The mango was a great boost of flavor. Highly recommended for an easy weeknight dinner.

Upon tasting the dressing, I thought it might be too salty, so I cut it a little bit with more yogurt and lime juice - though not much. After mixing it all together it turned out beautifully.

YUM! This was the first time I've made quinoa and it was great. I made the recipe as is but used roasted red peppers and cooked the quinoa per package directions. Next time I'll cut the amt of quinoa to 1C because there just wasn't enough dressing to go around. Will probably add shrimp or chix next time, too. Very adaptable, you can add all kinds of stuff to make this even better. De-lish.

I love quinoa, mangoes and yogurt and although I made this recipe twice (I figured I must have done something wrong the first time), I found it to be very weird tasting. Maybe my curry powder is too spicy (I bought it at my local spice monger so I know it's fresh) or maybe two teaspoons is simply too much curry. Perhaps others will have better luck!

Excellent exactly as is! My daughter is a vegetarian and I am always on the lookout for vegetarian dishes that contain protein. Quinoa is a great, high-protein grain. All the non-vegetarians in my family loved it too. My mother-in-law, who is a gourmet cook, even asked for the recipe! Has become a family favorite

I thought that this recipe was great, although I did make a few changes that I thought made it even better. I decided to use cilantro instead of mint because I feel that cilantro goes very well with the Indian influences of curry and the Mexican influences of mango and jalapeño. Also, I roasted the red bell pepper first, then sauteed it with the mango, jalapeño, and fresh ginger before I added it to the rest of the ingredients. It turned out fantastic!

My family loved this recipe! I did not steam the quinoa. Instead, I prepared it according to the directions on the package and then mixed it a bit and let it sit in the pot to let the extra moisture evaporate. I also didn't add any oil to the recipe and don't think any of us missed it.

I agree with others that this was a delicious recipe. I haven't cooked with quinoa that much, but I just followed the instructions on the box and cooked 1-part quinoa to 2-parts water (bringing to boil and then simmer for 15 minutes) and thought it came out well. I followed the instructions exactly for the yogurt sauce, and I initially thought it was WAY too salty. But when combined with the mango, mint, and jalepeno, it all leveled out nicely

My goodness was this delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and although steaming the quinoa was sort of a pain I think it was well worth the effort. I brought it to a friend's home for the 4th of July to raves. Fortunately we had leftovers and I had some today at lunch -- even better than the first day. Although it was great at every stage, my preference was eating it cold. This is definitely a house staple!

I prepared this dish just as recipe is written. Even though quinoa is a complete protein, we added a chicken breast for a bigger meal. It was super delicious! Even a skeptical husband went back for seconds.

What a delicious surprise! I loved this dish and it's unusual mix of textures and flavors. I left out the mint as I seldom care for it in any dish. I also ended up not using all the quinoa because I felt that the dressing wasn't going to go far enough (I fed the leftover quinoa, topped with yogurt and mango, to my 19-month-old son!). Next time, I'd make less quinoa (or more dressing), and leave out the jalapeno (the heat was redundant with the spicy curry powder).

Rating: 4
This dish is delicious!! Very simple to prepare, yet very complexly flavoured. The more fragrant the curry powder, the more tasty the dish, so if you have homemade curry powder, or can get some that has a good amount of fennel, cardamon, and cinnamon, and is easy on the tumeric, use that. I also substituted almonds for peanuts and that worked quite well. It keeps well, too, and is just as good cold, so it makes great left-overs.

Rating: 4
I didn't expect this to be a 4-forker, but this dish surprised me. It has a variety of contrasting flavours and textures: all which work well together. I reduced the amount of quinoa to 1 cup, and boiled it, as suggested by other reviewers. I'll try adding some chopped corriander with the chopped mint the next time I make this. Definitely a keeper!

This is maybe a 3.5 forker--really delicious and interesting, and quite easy to do. My dinner guest, a foodie, couldn't stop raving. Seriously, an "mmm-mmmmmm" after every bite, eyes closed in appreciation. What cook doesn't like to see that? My company arrived sooner than I expected, so I skipped the steaming and just boiled the quinoa in two parts water to one part quinoa for 15 minutes, and it turned out just fine. (Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned those directions--you saved me!) Also used one-quarter jalapeno instead of the whole thing, because previous reviewers said a whole one is too much, but I think this could take a little more heat than that (the mango and mint and red pepper are so cooling). The different flavors and textures make each mouthful a delightful one, and they somehow all make sense together, adding their own little unique flavor and mouthfeel without commandeering the dish. I'd serve with a mild vegetable dish (cuke salad or green beans?), maybe a nice wedge of sheep's milk cheese (something with a little tang), and sauvignon blanc (my taste preference) and feel quite proud. Highly recommended!

This was a very tasty recipe for an under used grain. I did substitute 1/4t of dried ginger for fresh, but had I used the fresh, I suspect it would have had just that much more of a punch. Be aware that a fine mesh sieve is essential when rinsing the tiny little grains before cooking.

Rating: 3
I'd give this 2.5 forks, but I rounded up b/c I believe it has real potential. Some very nice flavors that work well together here-- I just had problems with the consistency of the quinoa. In fairness to the recipe, though, I didn't have the right equipment; my sieve was too large for my pans & I couldn't completely cover the quinoa when steaming it & get it dry enough. I'd like to make this again, though, next time substituting couscous for the quinoa-- couscous is already pretty dry and one wouldn't need the steaming step. I don't think anything would be lost-- the flavors of the other ingredients are so strong that the recipe really does not really benefit from the deliciousness of quinoa anyway. I'd also add some green onions.

This was a delicious dish. This is the first time I have cooked or tasted Quinoa. I made mine too hot initially, so I cooled it down with Pineapple. It was fruity and spicy! I didn't add in the peanuts but it was fantastic anyway. I served it chilled and everyone loved it.

One should ALWAYS rinse quinoa. Quinoa is coated with a bitter substance called saponin, which tastes soapy. In the US, the quinoa we buy should have been processed in such a way to remove all the saponin. But, it's still a good idea to rinse the grains to make sure. Anyway, fantastic recipe!

Out of this world, especially if you are lucky enough to get really good mangoes. Steaming method is not strictly needed, but does give a nicer, lighter texture to the finished product. I've never needed to rinse the quinoa either. Absolutely delicious, and cashews work as well or better than peanuts. Have made several times, and will make again. Great summer potluck dish...

I added more yogurt and lime juice, then added half an onion, half a cucumber, a can of sweet corn, a can of black beans and 4 grilled chicken breasts grilled and diced. Served cold. Nice light supper on the patio. I do think that steaming the quinoa makes it better. I'm sure it would be fine just cooking like rice, but the steaming gave it a really nice light texture. I used my bamboo steamer for Thai sticky rice, worked like a charm.

Very good. I cooked the quinoa according to package directions and it was fine. I used one mango and one papaya (it's so hard to find ripe mangoes), but will use two mangoes next time. This is great left over, but I wouldn't put in the nuts until time to eat, so they keep their crisp.

I'm always looking for interesting summer side dishes and this fit the bill perfectly! Flavors blended well, dressing was healthy (use good curry powder), mmmm it was delicious. I've read that quinoa is a particularly healthy grain, and it provides a nice change of pace. I doubled the mango -- have a small child to please at home and thought she'd like the extra sweetness. (Note: I didn't steam the quinoa for the second cooking because I don't have a steamer with such fine holes. The quinoa was cooked through just by boiling 10 mins. I dried thoroughly to avoid sogginess.)

A tip - I come from a country that quinoa is used in lots of dishes,to make quinoa fluffier we do not use salt while it cooks. We add salt at the very last boil.

I also enjoyed this recipe very much. As was said, it was very light and I'll definitely be making it again this summer. I actually used papaya rather than mango simply because I had one on hand, and it was wonderful. Next time, however, I'll prepare quinoa the usual way (more like rice). While this way was good, it was a bit of pain for a hardly detectable difference.
