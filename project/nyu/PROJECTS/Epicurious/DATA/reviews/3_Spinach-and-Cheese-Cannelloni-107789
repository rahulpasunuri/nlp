I made this following the filling recipe. I made homemade pasta rectangles and dressed it in a red sauce (Frankie Sputinos recipe). The filling did leave something to be desired but my guests loved it.

In light of other people's feedback, I made the following minor changes and thought it was great: I doubled the cream sauce so it wouldn't be as dry. Didn't use the full amount but one serving of the sauce wouldn't have been enough. For the filling, I added an extra, rather large, clove of garlic to give it more punch. For the filling, I doubled the romano cheese. I used the pancetta--where it looked like others may have skipped. Once assembled in the dish, with the white cream sauce on top, I added some red marinara sauce I had on hand--bolognese I had from Trader Joes. I would definitely make it again!

This was really bland. After reading the reviews, I tried to avoid it by adding more parmigiano, as well as some chile pepper, to the sauce. I also doubled the garlic and added some mushrooms, and I used the prosciutto. I was pretty disappointed, since it seemed like it should have come together better than it did.

I thought this was good. It certainly was heavy, as others described. I used lumpia wrappers (someone else mentioned this), which I thought worked really well and made the dish a bit lighter than regular pasta would have been. My favorite thing about this is that it only took 1 hour to prepare. Other reviewers made it sound like it was going to tie up the whole afternoon, but it didn't, so I could see making this on a weeknight (if you were really hungry!).

I added chopped cooked shrimp instead of the procutto and used the lemon cream sauce that was on the salmon recipe. Very nice twist.

Dish has many possibilities. I regret not using pancetta, thought it definitely needed something else because it seemed a bit bland. I want to try again and add crab or smoked chicken to filling. Also,thought it had too much parsley.

I found this dish to be very bland and the texture unpleasant. The filling was grainy, not creamy. The no-bake noodles disintegrated way before the 6 minutes given to cook them. I used pepperoni instead of proscuitto as I didn't have the latter, but it was still bland. I also used homegrown fully-grown spinach. I didn't broil it with cheese on top as I didn't have a dish that could go in the broiler. Don't know if that would have made a huge difference, but it would have helped. It was a lot of work but not terribly hard. It needs some spicing up and a more creamy texture.

This was a good recipe even though it did take a long time to make, but that's what Sunday afternoons are for. I added some chicken that I had sauteed in olive oil and diced as well as some sun dried tomatoes. I think a medium onion was a little much, but not too overbearing. When buying the pre-cooked lasagne noodles, make sure they are big enough. Mine weren't wide enough and the cannellonis were on the smallish side. Still delicious.

This was a big hit when I served it at a small dinner party. I used manicotti tubes but will try the fresh pasta next time. I would also consider making it with frozen spinach for convenience. I added a little extra cheese to the sauce, which I will definitely double the next time I make the recipe. I added some fresh basil to the filling along with the parsley, and will increase the garlic next time, too.

I used the fresh no boil noodles - made it easy to put together. I did not use the prosciutto but will add that next time for a little zing. With big eaters - you had better watch out as it may not make enough - this did serve 4 but 4 regular eaters not my in-laws!

Only because I know that when people pose a question (or in this case answers) the forks change as well as the %... I put yes. First, to answer the question of the glass pan. Glass pans tend to really hold and deliver heat directly to the BOTTOM of the pan. If you add extra sauce in the beginning, this would help the drying, frying...: ) As for the work. If I were to make a recipe for cannelloni, I would find one with crepes since real cannelloni is made that way. At least then, the "trouble" would seem worth it.

This is a great recipe but you have to love cheese!! I recommend doubling the sauce portion of the recipe and pouring more sauce over the top of the cannelloni before cooking. I've made it over and over and love it!!

This recipe turned out very well, but it was quite time-consuming. I did not use the proscuitto, and it seemed quite flavorful without it. I served this to guests with very finely chopped red pepper to garnish over the top - it served as a nice contrast to the white and green of the dish.

This dish was enjoyed by all. I would say the prosciutto is not optional. It adds a really nice taste. I'd not chop it too finely next time. I added more parmesan and liked that extra bite and richness it gives to the sauce. The sauce is one that can be used for many other dishes (I added the drained liquid from the spinach to the sauce). It is a bit labour intensive...but well worth the effort.

Excellent. I didn't have enough no-boil noodles, so substituted cooked regular ladagne noodles-so can imagine how great it will benext time with fresh or no-boil. Also substituted family likes these type of dishes on the saucy side. Leftovers were great as well

I really enjoyed making this on a Sunday afternoon. I followed the recipe exactly and used "no boil" lasgne noodles as it suggested. I included the prosciutto as well. I was quite impressed with my sauce and can't wait to make this dish again - next time for company!

This turned out very good, my husband loved it. I followed the sauce and filling exactly and they were great. But I did not bother boiling the fresh pasta squares, and I did use a glass dish. Also, put on all the sauce before baking.

Great recipe! had lots of extra filling and sauce, which I used to make an eggplant and spinach lasagna. Used the fresh pasta recipe twice, once for the cannelloni and again for the lasagna.

This is the best of its type I have ever had - including in many Italians restaurants. Made it exactly as written, including prosciutto. Friends also raved. Try it!

I am making this tonight...but I think you need a non glass dish because you are putting it under the broiler?? That would be my take on it. I am using won ton/egg roll wrappers instead of the pasta and making ravioli along with extra sauce for serving.

Can someone tell me why a glass dish is not recommeded here? I'd would rather not purchase a ceramic dish for just one recipe, although I know they are superior for baking... Thanks

This was good! I didn't use prosciutto and it seemed redundant to put in parsley with all the spinach. I made the white sauce with 1 per cent milk and instead of pasta I used six-inch flour tortillas. Poured all the sauce over the cannelloni instead of reserving some. Very light and delicious.

I have to fess up - I didn't follow the whole recipe. I don't care for ham, so used the sauce and noodle recipes over my own spinach, mushroom and cheese filling concoction. I found the sauce to be simple but very flavorful. The cake flour used for pasta made it delightfully tender and light. I can't speak for the filing, but would encourage cooks to keep the sauce and pasta recipes on hand for permutations...

Didn't love it. Normally like prosciutto, but... it did taste better the next day, so I would tell you to make them a day prior. My leftovers didn't have much white sauce on them, and I did not actually miss it. The sauce can be made with 1% and just added a little more flour. Red pepper flakes in the spinach cheese mixture would probably help.

This tasted great. I cooked 1/2 lb. of ground veal and added it to the spinach and cheese mixture. I also coarsley chopped the spinach mixture before adding the cheese. I purchased fresh pasta from a restaurant, and it was more intuitive to score the sheets in quarters. It made 12 smaller cannelloni. I also did not cook the pasta at all; that seemed like an extra unnecessary step with fresh pasta. I froze them in packets of 2 and they bake up tasting wonderfully fresh.

i'd better go back and work on my roux 'cause my sauce tasted like elmer's glue... however, the cannelloni themselves were delicate and delicious. a lot of work.

Mmmmm - sooo yummy! Has the same comforting effect as homemade mac n' cheese. Use fresh pasta - it adds a nice delicateness to the dish. I didn't use prosciutto, but I do wish I had used some Pecorino Romano. I also used 2%milk, so it took a little longer for the bechamel to thicken. Tasted great, nonetheless.
