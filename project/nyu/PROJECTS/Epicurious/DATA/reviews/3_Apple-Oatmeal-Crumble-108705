Highly recommend doubling the crumble topping portion of the recipe. When prepared with original measurements, I could barely cover the surface of the toasted apples.

Sounded great and may have potential but the topping didn't work for me at all. It was dry and didn'd add anything to the dish. won't make it again.

I think this is totally funny - I am reading the top of the recipe in July and they mistakenly wrote tomatoes instead of apples, when most people are swamped with tomatoes. It makes me feel like the folks at Epicurious are human too and have full gardens - bursting with too many tomatoes!!! Have a great day!

Well, I used 3 Gala Apples and left the skin on which added a pretty color. I think the topping needed more butter and I should have added nuts and some candied ginger or raisins, because it was bland but thats what happens when you're really trying to stay on the healthy side. Overall, decent, not anything I'd want to serve for company but good nonetheless for a sweet end to a nice meal for myself and my neighbor! Ha!

Pretty disappointing. Apple crumble is my fav dessert and I am always looking for a new recipe. This was not it. The crumble was insufficient and not very crumbly. The apple flavour was good but the texture was too mushy. I will keep looking for better recipes.

I made a number of changes to really kick this up a bit and tried to keep it semi-healthy. I think these changes will really help give this recipe the additions it needs. First of all, I used 1/4 c brown sugar and combined it with 1/4 c wheat flour, 1/4 c sliced almonds, and 3 tbsps of margarine. I mushed it into a good paste. I did the apples almost the same (i.e., sliced thin with lemon), however, I added a little bit of flour to cover the apples (@ 1/2 tbsp as a binder), then sprinkled them with cinnamon, nutmeg and a little clove and then added in some dried cherries I had on hand. I didn't cook the apples separately. I guess you could do that if you cooked them with some white sugar, but it seemed unnecessary. Instead, I covered them with the oat/almond mixture and popped them in the over for the full 45 mins. My guests seemed to like it since it's all gone! :^) I offered it up over fat-free frozen vanilla yogurt and ate it myself with fat-free regular vanilla yogurt. It was kind of like a parfait. Great either way.

Good for a low-calorie recipe, however next time I will try it with Granny Smith apples and cut back on the lemon juice. The Rome apples, at least the ones from my supermarket, were tasteless. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples, and will add more cinnamon to the topping next time.

This is a good recipe guidline for a great dessert, but you need to have an imagination or some creativity to transform this recipe from unremarkable to remarkable. For example, mix in peaches and pears with the apples. Add some currants or raisins. I used a tablespoon cinnamon. Chopped, toasted pecans also added nicely.

This is great, mostly because I never knew how unbelievably easy it is to make oatmeal crumble topping. The apple part, however, looked bland. I added some sweet butter, raisins, and apricot jam. Turned out brilliantly--and even better served with a dollop of cream.

I added more lemon juice, sugar, and butter to make the taste stand out. My guests polished this off in a matter of minutes.

Apple oatmeal crumble is my favorite dessert. I has made every recipe I have come across. This is the best one I have found. I enjoy preparing it, and everyone I've made it for loves eating it. I double the topping, that's the best part.

Don't shout me down for this, I just wanted to add a variation in case others want to try it. I found this recipe not long ago and I really like it. With the apples, soften them in a saucepan in red wine of your choice (something light like Pinot Noir) until they break up, then add some sugar and dissolve if you are a sweet tooth. Make the topping as directed, but instead of oatmeal (the healthy topping) substitute chopped walnuts (still healthy but in a different way). My guests thought this was pretty good. If you want to experiment give it a go.

Yum! this is really good. Next time I'll get the baking dishes the recipe called for, and double the topping.

Im not big on apples so i didnt try this, my fiancee thought it was so-so. He would have liked a little more crumble topping and maybe more cinnamon. I will try it again with these changes!

Definitely a good recipe and easy to make. I would recommend also that the topping be doubled. I made it with golden delicious apples and it turned out very well.

Pretty good - great with vanilla ice cream. I would add more liquid before I baked the apples and possibly use cider to make it more flavorful. I would also at least double the topping. But worth experimenting with and making again.
