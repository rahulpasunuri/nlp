Delicious flavors because of the vinaigrette (cilantro a must for my crowd). My family wants the vinaigrette on everything now! "Hey, would this be good on halibut?" Probably! BTW, thanks to tomese from Louisville who suggested browning the chops and finishing in the oven. Chops are more succulent when prepared this way.

Good recipe...though I would offerone caveat on the point about the squash skins being edible--while they can be eaten, in my experience it is not uncommon to find some people you serve it to will experience a certain level of...well...gastric distress the next day.

This was a great use of butternut squash. I love complete recipes like this. The combination was delicious. The only change I made was instead of pumpkin seeds I took the seeds out of my squash and toasted those to go on top.

Made this last night, super easy and delicious. Used unpeeled butternut squash - it caramelized beautifully and the viniagrette's tartness was perfect on the pork and the sweetness of the squash. Per another recipe on this site, I browned the chops (2 min per side) and finished in the oven (8 min) on the pan with the squash. Thick chops were perfectly done.

Very, very good. I usually discount reviews in which it seems that the reviewer made multiple substitutions and didn't really make the recipe as intended. However, I was guilty this time as did not have cilantro on hand. Scoured my spice cabinet and settled on one teaspoon of dried basil in place of the cilantro. It was still excellent, a great weeknight meal. This recipe's a keeper, and next time I WILL have cilantro.

I made this with acorn squash, and it was perfect with the pork chop and the skin was soft and delicious as well. I substituted roasted sunflower seeds because I had them on hand and couldn't find pumpkin seeds. The lime vinaigrette was a perfect, bright compliment to the dish. I had a homemade rub that I used to season the pork chop, but I'm sure it would be very good with just salt & pepper as well. Very tasty and will make it as a regular dish at our house for sure. Very quick and easy dish to make, full of flavor.

First to review - OK here goes. I pared it down to two servings and it still came out very well. The only change I made was to further season the pork with with a sprinkle of cumin and sweet paprika on each chop. I would suggest if you do so DO NOT crust them with spices! The delicate sweetness of the squash will be overwhelmed. The tartness of the vinaigrette counters that note quite well. One further note: the squash skins are edible but chewy and add no flavor. They just look good on the plate. They easily peel off. But the wife and I loved it! Keeping this one.
