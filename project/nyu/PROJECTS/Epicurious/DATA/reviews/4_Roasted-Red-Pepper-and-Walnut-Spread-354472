Made homemade roasted peppers then subbed fresh basil and garlic because I had an olive oil marinade from earlier in the day. Very tasty instantly...and only gets better as the days go by. Will make again using cumin/cayenne and with less carbs (perhaps using cauliflower instead of bread crumbs).

I gave it one fork for OK, but OK is an exaggeration. Mainly, one T. red wine vinegar is far too much. It overpowers the flavors and conflicts with the toasted walnuts. I added garlic, and salt and pepper, and more cayenne, and then some Sriacha, and then more garlic, and it's still pretty vinegary. It is attractive, though, especially with a little fresh thyme on top.

This was delicious, and SOOO easy and quick. And because it is to be served at room temp, it can be a really last-minute appetizer. I used fresh bread crumbs, but from what other reviewers said, could be made with packaged crumbs. So everything is pretty much in my pantry all the time. I'll definitely make it again.

OK I made this with 4 red peppers that I roasted instead of buying jars of roasted peppers. I also used Trader Joes organic breadcrumbs instead of fresh breadcrumbs. I needed to add at least 1/2 cup EVOO to get it to a smooth consistency. The flavor was great. I would make it again. I can see where the sun dried tomatoes would be a good addition as mentioned in other reviews.

I absolutely loved this recipe! Incredibly fast and easy. I didn't have red wine vinegar so used white wine vinegar and it was fine. The dip was a ok consistency without EVOO, but I added the 1/4 cup anyway to make it smoother. Toasting the walnuts adds a really fantastic depth of flavor. I use it as a spread for sandwiches and wraps as well as a dip for chips and crudite, and its awesome!

For ease and taste, this dip/spread can't be beat! One quick spin in the food processor and you have a healthy and delicious dip for pita chips and crudite. It's also great on turkey sandwiches or veggie wraps--Even the kids like it!

As recipe goes: BLECH! Despite loving roasted red peppers and making them for this recipe, I almost threw it out instead of serving it since I found it sickly sweet. BUT take the recipe from YUCH to YUMMMM (and 4-FORKs) by: half it, use 3-4 home roasted red peppers, add about 10 sun-dried tomatoes (oil packed), more cayenne, and about a clove of garlic. I also added lemon, but that was early on in my rescue attempts, and not sure if it helped or not in the end. OH - and cut-up pita bread (thin type with pocket) is amazing with it!!

I decreased the oil to 1/8 of a cup, added garlic, sun-dried tomato, and lots more cayenne, and it was delicious.

Made it twice this holiday season. Did it as written the first time and would give it 31/2 forks. Added some sun dried tomatoes the second round which brought up to a 4.

Wow. This is one amazingly fabulous spread! It was done in a flash AND the flavors were incredible. Toasting the nuts adds a wonderful depth of flavor. I tasted the spread before adding the oil--and it was so good I decided to eliminate the oil altogether to reduce the fat. This is a real winner and is at the top of my quick, easy & delicious hors d'oeuvres list.

WONDERFUL! I don't like and therefore didn't have walnuts, but toasted pecans were delicious and made this a HUGE hit!!!

This was fantastic and very easy to make. I increased the cayenne slightly so it had a really nice kick at the end. Served with pita chips.

Total hit and super easy. Didn't have red wine vinegar, so used balsamic and it was fantastic. This was devoured in no time. Making it again this week for second party! Enjoy!

Love this basic recipe, have made it several times. Easy and a crowd-pleaser as a dip with fresh veggies, toasts, crackers or chips. Wonderful as a spread on sandwiches, too. I prefer to use more than the recommended amounts of cayenne and cumin and a multigrain bread for the crumbs.

One fork for just the recipe by itself. I made it exactly as stated, and thought it was rather bland. I then added twice the amount of salt, a sprinkle of garlic powder, and the juice from a lemon wedge. YOU NEED TO ADD THE LEMON JUICE! Made it a 3.5 fork dip after that. Served with veggies from the garden and it was delish.

One of the easiest dishes to make, this spread is greatly enjoyed by even the pickiest of eaters among my friends. I've made it with both jarred peppers and roasted my own and there was no perceptible difference. A fragrant, fresh year-round option.

delish- i am allergic to walnuts and was scooping this out of the food processor before i added them in. it is very addictive!

Quick and delicious. I also added a little garlic and a little harissa to add more spice.

Excellent. I didn't have walnuts so I used toasted pine nuts, and added garlic. I made enough to freeze some.

Good and easy - lovely color. Might try this with toasted almonds to make it a Romesco type spread. Served with lavash "crackers:" Brush lavash with olive oil, sprinkled with zatar (Penzy's mix) and baked in 350 degree oven until lightly toasted. Break up into cracker-size pieces.

I'm not a huge fan of this spread. It would have been great with some chickpeas, but just red pepper on it's own was a little too sweet.

My dining companion and I thoroughly enjoyed this spread as an accompaniment to our pita/kebab dinner. I had bought roasted red pepper hummus for the meal, but found it unnecessary after whipping this up. As someone lacking a food processor (gasp!) I was also pleased that I was able to prepare this in my blender; I cut the walnuts down to 3/4 cup and the mixture wasn't too thick to blend.

This was great!! Served it for our monthly dinner group gathering and it was quite the "hit". Perfect with celery and carrots as dippers (in addition to pita chips).

Ohhh, this was so good. I'm actually at the groaning stage right now because I ate SO many pitas dipped in this spread! I added a clove of garlic and some salt; it was perfect.

I would only make half next time since I had a lot left over and the amounts lend themselves to being divided. Also, I used 2/3 cup regular bread crumbs to save time and it turned out perfectly.

This is a great spread. Add a clove or two of mashed garlic, and 1 tsp pomegranate molasses/syrup OR lemon juice and you have my favorite muhammara! This is fabulous with roasted or grilled chicken, spread on crackers, pita chips dipped in, as a condiment on sandwiches.... Well, you get the picture.

I liked this a lot. I happened to have the oven on so I roasted my own peppers - did 2 good-sized red peppers. Comes together quickly. Definitely tastes better if it sits overnight.

Wow...this was awesome. I didn't make any changes other than making a smaller batch. It was great with the pita bread and the cumin-scented kebabs!

Fabulous spread ! Take the time to roast your own red peppers! What a treat, I like it so much I'd even put it on my Breakfast Toast !
