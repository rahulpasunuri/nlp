The first time my sister made this, she accidentally put all the Skor bars in the crust. It was kind of hard but VERY tasty. It's of course delicious made the right way too! I'm going to try it for the first time this Christmas and liked someone's idea of using red and green sprinkles since all that candy on top would be too much.

This cheesecake was amazing, and I plan to make it again this weekend for a party. My family was speechless as they ate it! I don't think I would put the recommended candies on the top as it would detract from the overall taste--maybe just a few crushed candy canes or soething which is not to be consumed for a decoration.

I have made this every year at Christmas for the past 4 years and everyone loves it! This year I sprinkled the top with just a little bit of red and green sprinkles (the kind that you usually put on ice cream). This gave it a very festive look without making it overly sweet, since the cheesecake is already so rich.

I omitted the candy and topped with shards of Heath Bars. Unlike others, I did not experience need for extending cook time, so keep an eye on it - maybe my oven runs hot. It came out perfect. The picture shows a much thicker coating of sour cream than you get by following recipe. All my guests loved this.

My husband and daughter are cheesecake lovers, so I made this for Christmas. Although good, we all agreed we would have preferred a more traditional cheesecake. I did not care for the crust at all. The almonds ruined it. Keep searching...you are sure to find a better recipe. I will add that I took the tip from a reviewer to create a "wreath" with green and red M&M's and use a real piece of long, red ribbon for a bow. I used skinny satin, and it looked beautiful! Do it at the last minute so the colors don't bleed. The sour cream topping is forgiving and delicious, so I will borrow that for another recipe.

Oh my. I meant to say that I USED Nielssen-Massey vanilla and almond extracts, and meant nothing at all about any court-actions...

Rating: 4
This was a great cheesecake that received rave reviews from all who ate it...I found the flavor to be rather delicate, and not overly sweet; I sued Nielssen-Massey vanilla and almond extract (I swear by them), and didn't find the almond overwhelming at all...To my surprise, the toffee pieces within the cheesecake were not hard, but gently flaked away upon tooth contact -- quite nice. The one thing I did have a problem with was the crust; the toffee pieces in the crust caused the bottom to stick to the pan, and the sides to crumble away -- "erode" is probably a better word for it... Next time, I will omit the toffee from the crust.

I loved this recipe; I actually thres the toasted almonds and heath bars into the food processor until it was like a paste to create a uniform crust with the taste throughout then I ground up the heath finely to spread the flavor into the entire cake. I love the whole thing and I'm making it again now. This time I will do everything the same but cut back a bit on sugar and add extra toffee bits as said in the recipe to add texture

I am not really on the level of most people on Epicurious...I'm usually pretty intimidated by most of these recipes. But this one was really easy actually...the hardest part was getting the graham cracker crust to stick to the edges of the springform pan. I didn't use all the toffee it called for in the middle of the cheesecake, and I added a layer of strawberry spreadable fruit between the crust and cheesecake, which was a good call. If I make this again, I'll probably leave out the toasted almonds, they made the crust taste a little burnt to me. But I should say that others commented that they enjoyed the almonds.

Great Christmas Recipe. I baked this cheesecake for a Christmas Party. It was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly. I used lots of candy so that it looked like a Christmas Wreath. I even attached a bright red bow. It was as beautiful as it was delicious.

This is hands-down my favorite cheesecake recipe. The sour cream topping perfectly cuts through some of the heaviness of the cheesecake with a slightly tart flavor and the toffee is divine! I always omit the almond extract, I find it too overwhelming. And be sure not to top with candies until right before serving as they will bleed their colors (and I've usually gone with more finely crumbled chocolate-covered toffee on top...I can never have enough). I've served this at Christmas for the last 2 years and it makes a perfect birthday treat as well - everyone loves it!

I made the crust, then poured a cup of hot fudge topping, then refrigerated overnight then made the cheesecake. Baked in a water bath, it turned out beautiful. I followed others' advice and didn't put any candy on top, just left it plain. I won first place in a baking contest with this recipe! Everyone still raves about this one.

Outstanding. Used light brown sugar, no almond extract, put crust ingredients in food processor. All great. Baked cake and topping each 5 minutes extra due to other reviews. Guests said "no!" to adding candy on top. A thin slice was perfect. Could serve 16-20 if you slice thinly. Do try this!!

This is a great cheesecake recipe! I cooked the crust a few minutes longer than the recipe suggested, and used a water bath when I baked the cheesecake and topping, so I had each of those in for an extra 5 minutes. When I took it out, I was worried that it looked undercooked, but after patiently waiting for it to chill overnight, the next day, it turned out wonderfully. This was the first cheesecake I've made that didn't have a single crack on it, and looked beautiful. I served it to guests and family, and heard nothing but compliments about how much they loved it! The next day, nearly everyone in my family was snooping around to grab the leftovers.

Rating: 4
This is the best cheesecake I ever made! I used one cup of sour cream and 3 8-oz of cream cheese for the filling so that it wouldn't be so dense. I also cooked it longer, because it needed it but it turned out great! For the topping, instead of candy, I laid sliced almonds flat on the top, it looked beautiful. I'm making two more this christmas. I only used half the almond extract, and still found it over powering, so I might leave it out next time.

I had made this recipe back in 2000 and 2001 for Christmas, and unfortunatley lost the recipe since then. My family raved about it for both years. The last few years I tried making similar recipes to this one, but they did not compare. I am absolutley thrilled to find this again, and will be making it for Christmas this year, and every other year. My tip, is to follow the recipe exactly! It really does come out perfect... and, I used Christmas M & M'S with sprinkles, and even crushed up pieces of chocolate bark. The candy on top really does make this so wonderful! Enjoy!

The crust really makes this cheesecake special and a delight to eat (I cut the brown sugar by half)! I chopped the Skor bars pretty finely in the filling, which helped to permeate the cheesecake and give a nice toffee flavor throughout. The sour cream topping is essential to provide a tartness that cuts the sweetness of the rest of the dessert. Very tasty, and very and very rich. Enjoy!

I made this as one of several desserts that I took to our friends' home for a large Christmas dinner. This recipe was so well received and many asked for the recipe. I thought one woman was going to do the scene from "Harry Met Sally" at one of the tables across the room. I had made the toffee myself to give as gifts to friends and was able to save some for this dessert. I left off the sour cream topping and decorated the top with whip cream in a pastry bag; pretty simple criss cross and piped fluted stars around the rim. I added small chunks of toffee to the top but found it difficult to cut with the chunks. Next time, I will cut them smaller or leave them off entirely. It turned out perfectly. I did bake it in a water bath and let it cool under a large stainless steel bowl (helps to prevent cracks). I am making it again for another party on New Year's Eve.

I really appreciated all the advice from previous reviewers. I cooked the cheesecake and topping an extra 5 minutes each and it was perfect. I left out the almonds(burnt them while toasting)and almond flavoring. I topped it with toffee bits around the edge and drizzled it with a crisscross pattern in chocolate and caramel sauce. It was just beautiful. I think gumdrops would have ruined it.

Rating: 4
This is a very delicious cheesecake! Besides leaving the cheesecake in for an addtional 5 mins. after adding the topping, I followed the recipe exactly! The only mistake I made was not topping ALL the topping on, which I initially thought was too much. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how delicious the topping is! I will make this cheesecake again at our next holiday gathering (or next dinner party). By the way, I, too, did not add the gumdrops (not a fan of them anyway), but did add chopped up helath bar and it was great!

I made this recipe according to directions, except for the topping, in which I skipped the sour cream/candy and instead topped my cake with a 1/2 inch perimeter of the toffee bits and then filled in the center with crumbled Heath Bars. This made for a pretty presentation and kept to the theme of the cake. The result - very tasty with good texture.

Well, think i'm better off sticking to the light lemon cheesecake or even New York Cheesecake, this is just too rich for me. I still ate it but too sickly.

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe. I've used it so many times, it's practically memorized and I've passed on the recipe to numerous requestors. The topping is an excellent idea. Even if I make a different cheesecake, I still make this topping. It makes the cheesecake look pristine even if it cracks, or browns funny. My much loved step-father (who didn't believe that you should compliment food and so almost never did) took one bite and said "This is good!" My mother and I just stared at each other. From that day on, we made this cheesecake for every father's day and birthday until he passed. I have to be very careful now not to get tears in it because I think about him a lot whenever I make it. It's a wonderful cheesecake and I have the added benefit of having pleased someone I loved very much with it.

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday. It was the first time I made a cheesecake. I was very pleased with the results- delicious! Everyone loved it. I (oops) used fat-free sour cream, and I thought it would be a disaster, but it was fine. Next time I'll either skip the topping or use regular sour cream. I didn't put candies on top. I thought that it would look sort of tacky.

I made this a while ago, as a dessert for a New Years party. Since it was for a party, I made it into bars instead of a round cake. I made the one batch, and put in two 8X10 glass pans. Overall the flavor was wonderful, and many at the party complemented on how good the cheesecake was. Other than making into small one inch bars, I didnt use the candy topping, I drizzled chocolate over the top, after cutting into peices, then removed from the baking pan, and put on a tray. a warning, the first piece removed usually doesnt look the best, so you will have to eat it right away (oh darn). enjoy

This was a super easy cheesecake. I replaced the graham cracker crumbs with chocolate graham craker crumbs... replaced the dark brown sugar in the filling with regular white sugar...substituted Bailey's Irish cream for the almond extract and used Hershey's toffee bits in place of Heath bars...also skipped the topping but decorated it with bittersweet chocolate shavings..Looked great! For the cooking method, I double-wrapped the outside of the springfoam pan with foil and cooked the cheesecake in a roasting pan filled with boiling hot water bath at 325 degrees. Lots of changes but the result was excellent! Definitely a keeper!!

Wonderful. Very, very rich and very sweet. Like most other people, we left the candies off the top and just sprinkled on crushed Heath Bar bits instead. A full 16 oz. of sour cream sounded like way too much for the topping, so we decreased it to 8 oz. and used only 3 tablespoons of sugar. I agree with other reviewers that it needs at least 10 or 15 minutes more baking time than the review says - it was soft in the center (though it still tasted delicious).

This is an excellent cheesecake recipe. I make pastry dough crust instead of graham cracker crust. People ask for the recipe and it is a hit each time it is served.

I took this cheesecake to a dinner party and everyone absolutely LOVED it. I also did not put candies on top and instead opted for more crushed skor bars. It definitely makes 12 LARGE servings - you could realistically serve 15 or more people with smaller slices as this is an incredibly rich cake...almost too rich! I also found that it took an extra 5 minutes too bake fully and about 2 minutes extra for the topping to set.

I made this for the holidays last year and it was to die for! I don't know what the cook from Ontario did, but it sounds like she did something wrong.

Excellent. I have made this cheesecake several times and it is always a hit. (Caught my brother eating a piece like a brownie!) I don't use the candies.... just sprinkle on more Skor bits and toasted almonds.

Real butter... real cream... real sour scream.

The crust was a bit hard although I cooked it for only 5 min. as instructed, but very tasty. Had to leave the sour cream about 15 min. for it to finally take. The candies for topping didn't appeal to me either (before I read the reviews...) and instead I crushed more toasted almonds and skor candies, topped with soft creamy caramel... Everyone loved it !

I have never been disappointed with anything I've made from this site that has gotten such good reviews -- until now! The cheesecake itself is very good, but the sour cream topping was just awful. I made this to take into work on my birthday, and started cutting it up the night before, and arranging pieces on a platter. Good thing I tried it first -- no way could I have served it to my coworkers. I baked the cheesecake about 15 minutes longer than called for, then baked the topping for another 15 minutes, but although the edges set up, the middle didn't. Worse, when I cut into the cake, it had sunk in the middle (when I added the topping I guess? -- it came out of the oven quite flat) so that there was 1" of cheesecake and 2" of topping in that area. I wound up scraping off all the topping and freezing the cheesecake -- my husband and I can pick away at it -- but I need to make something else for work now. I was really disappointed. Note that I inadvertently bought light sour cream (not ultra light or fat free) rather than the full fat kind, but I still expected better results.

Definitely a 3 1/2 fork recipe! I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it - my only change was to add a bit of Amaretto and it turned out beautifully. As a bit of a cheesecake novice, I love the sour cream topping that hides any cracks I couldn't (or didn't take the time to) avoid in baking the cake! I'm sure that comment will make me despised by some, but I thought those of you out there cooking with less than perfect ovens might appreciate the tip. :)

Made this for a holiday party. It was absolutely delicious, and no one noticed that I left the brown sugar out of the crust by accident! I also substituted reduced fat cream cheese for 1/2 the cream cheese and it was still extremely rich and creamy. The sour cream topping definitely needed the extra time most reviewers suggested. The holiday M&Ms and other candy for the top didn't appeal to me so I crushed up almond rocha (you could use heath or skor bars) and used that. I placed a circle cut from a paper plate in the middle of the cheesecake and sprinkled the crushed almond rocha around the circle. When I lifted the paper circle, I had a round white area on the cheesecake and that became a snowman's face peeking out of the cheesecake. I used a baby carrot for a nose, and two cut pieces of black panda (brand name)licorice for eyes and raisins to make a smile. It looked festive and tasted great. It certainly is very rich and a little goes a long way, but it's a delicious cheesecake and I will definitely make it again.

I want to make a comment to those of you who are thinking of substituting with an oreo cookie crust. What a great way to ruin this cake! Oreo's have no place in this recipe. I have not done it myself, but I read some reviews with folks who have and I cannot believe they enjoyed the result. I have made this cheesecake many times and as many have I skip all the gumdrops and even the sour cream topping. It's a great recipe.

I was the only one of 6 people that tried this cake that thought that the almond flavor was too overpowering. The next time I make it, I will halve the almond extract or leave it out entirely. The cheesecake just doesn't need that flavor - the crust, toffee chunks and creamy filling is enough. I topped it with crushed heathbars around the rim, and it was a sight to behold. It definitely got a lot of oohs and ahhs, even before it was tasted!

I modified this recipe; Instead of doing the crust as suggested, I used an oreo cookie crumb crust.

I made this for my guy's 30th birthday. We and the rest of the guests agree that the cake is great.

I am making the cake again this weekend for another b-day, so it is quickly becoming a favorite.

Although I don't/can't eat cheesecake, I make them frequently. This one received fantastic reviews by everyone along with requests for the recipe. I have also received a request to make it again.

As with most cheesecakes it was very easy to prepared so there was a great return on the investment.

This is the most amazing cheesecake I have made to date. I make a lot of cheesecakes, and don't like to make the same recipe twice. BUT - this one is so good I have now made it 3 times and continue to get requests for it.

The most decadent decos were broken pieces of the toffee bar and Reeses chocolate covered balls of toffee w/ chocolate sprinkles! Just amazing!

Based on all other reviews, I expected this cake to be awesome. I did take many suggestions, and the texture and amt. of time cooked was fine. I simply did not like the taste of the filling. The dark brown sugar and cream cheese filling, to me, was not tasty, though the plain sour cream topping seemed to temper it a bit, making it more palatable. I will stick with the plain versions in the future. I would however, use the crust in other cheesecake recipes, as it was delicious. Maybe even this same recipe with white sugar instead of brown.

Very good, recieved rave reviews. I used Nilla cookies in the crust. Yum! I also used Heath Bits (the packaged bite sized chunks of heath bars) worked really well. Because of the toffee in the crust, the crust hardens to an almost candy like consistency be prepared to use a lot of pressure.

This is definately a rich, creamy cheesecake. I changed the crust to an oreo crust and next time I will make it with the crust in this recipe. I used 6 heath bars in the filling -- baked it for an hour and 15 minutes -- put the sour cream topping on and baked that for 15 minutes (I also added 3 more chopped heath bars on top of the sour cream before baking). The cheesecake still seemed a bit too wobbly, so I turned off the oven and let the cheesecake sit for an additional 30 minutes. I let it refrigerate almost 24 hrs before cutting it. It was fabulous -- very decadent. Be sure to not cover it -- I put a towel over it in the refrigerator after it had already cooled and set, but it seemed to make it "sweat" a little. Try this recipe!!

This is a terrific cheesecake, though very sweet. Tiny slices certainly suffice. You might experiment with new flavors to add to it (candied ginger and lime would be good and less heavy). I made the filling with 3 packages of 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and 1 cup of plain yoghurt. It was lovely--flavorful and plenty rich. (Don't try the fat free cheese though-it's like bathroom caulking). I agree with the reviewer who says to go easy on the sour cream glaze; this does tend to overpower the very subtle and delicious filling. The crust is really delicious. Butter the sides of your pan if it doesn't want to stick. And like most have said, the cake needs more oven time than the recipe calls for. But I served this at a birthday party with 5 skor bars split between the crust, filling and top, and everyone raved

This is a fantastic and easy to make cheesecake . The crust is to die for!! The only thing I will do different next time is I will halve the sour cream topping.

I will definitely make this the next time I am asked to bring desert.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made, and I'll definitely make it again! My Easter-dinner friends loved it. It was easy too. My only comments are that yes, the topping should be baked a little longer than 5 minutes (I think I baked for 7 minutes) and instead of the gumdrops (which seems to be a misprint, maybe?) I sprinkled extra toffee bits and crumbled Skor bars on top after chilling. The result was awesome. Plus, I also think that you can get way more servings out of this cake. It is VERY rich, and my friends could only eat small pieces -- but I've been stealing bites off it all night!

WOW!!! What a cake! Everyone loved it! Instead of the graham cracker crust, I used the crust from the "Cherry cheesecake with chocolate almond crust" recipe which is also found on epicurious. (another wonderful cheesecake.) Instead of the candy in the middle of the cake, I drizzled some AlmondRoca syrup in its place. I also spread some of the syrup on top of the cake once it was cooled and sprinkled chopped up AlmondRoca on top of that. I hope I will have reason to make this cake again really soon.

All recipes can be improved upon but this one...not by much. The texture is smooth, the taste is rich, and the smell will draw crowds out of the woodwork. I bake my cheesecakes at 300, not 325 and they do not crack. Not as dry to boot. If you love the HEATH bars[minus chocolate!] the taste is delightful. A 3.5 in my book.

This cheesecake was a big hit at a recent party. The crust was one of the best of the many cheesecake recipes that I have made. It was also one of the easier cheesecakes to make. As some others have said, it should be baked longer. It was soft in the center, but no one complained. I will bake it 10 to 15 minutes longer the next time I make it. And that will be soon.

Personally, I would have rated this with 3 forks, but based on comments from everyone who tried it, I upped it to 4 forks. I've made this twice now - at Christmas and then again for my dad's birthday. It was well received each time. I haven't tried this, but I am tempted to add 8 tbsp of butter in the crust as it was a bit more crumbly than I like. Also, I suggest going crazy with the toffee. I think the only reason why I didn't feel that the recipe was worth 4 forks was because there wasn't as much toffee flavour as I had hoped. Oh, and I completely agree that the topping needs to be cooked for longer than 5 min. I believe I had it in the oven for close to 15. Instead of putting candies on it, I sprinkled score bits on the topping just before baking. The cake looked fantastic when I was done. My brother didn't believe that I made it when he saw it.

This cheesecake was awesome! Very creamy and not dense. It would be good without the toffee as well. Or, with some other flavor addition, like pecans and cinnamon.

I made this for my family's Christmas Eve party. Everyone loved it and my husband - who is not a cheesecake fan - thought it was absolutely delicious. For my other family members who are cheesecake lovers - it was the best cheesecake they have ever had. This is an incredibly simple dessert that has outstanding taste and texture.

I made this for a holiday dinner party. Everyone loved it!!! I used the candies. There was no bleeding as I put the candies on at the last minute. My only complaint was that I wish the inside heath bar had stayed crunchy. I agree with the review to cook longer. Mine cooked 1 hr 5 minutes.

I've made this cheesecake twice and both times the center was not done when I served it. I suggest baking the cake at least 1 hr 10 minutes and then test with a knife. The flavors were wonderful though and I will try it again.

This was outstanding. A wonderful mix of flavors. I will leave the colored candies out the next time as they did bleed;or just put chopped chocolate toffee on top. Try it you won't be disappointed.

It was a complete success for all 8 guests. It turned out moist and light rather than dense and dry. There were already requests to make it for the next holiday dinner. I didn't add any candy on the top for the fear of the colors bleeding on the topping. Also, I used regular light brown sugar, instead of dark. This was only my 3rd cheesecake ever and it was pretty easy. Don't spare on the toffee.

Rating: 4
I give it a 4 because everyone else(14 people) loved it, except me! There was an underlying taste that I didn't like, it could have been the brown sugar that was mixed in with the cream cheese. Before I made it- I was worried it would be odd having crunchy scor bits in the soft cheesecake, but the bits melted and were soft. I didn't like the nuts in the crust, I would leave it out next time.

I made this last year for a dessert buffet because it looked so spectacular. I made it again this year because it tastes so spectacular! One cheesecake afficianado told me she liked it better than Eli's, which is everybody's favorite in Chicago. I used Heath toffee bits this year because I couldn't find Skor's, and couldn't tell the difference--a time saver. Great recipe!

This cheesecake was the best I've ever made and I've made A LOT! Just made it for the first time for a "girl's dinner party" and it was absolutely fabulous! Got nothing but rave reviews all around! I'll be making it as one of my Christmas desserts this year and every year! Easy too!

For anyone who does not know (I certainly didn't!), each Skor bar is 1.8 oz. I love this recipe! I have made it twice, and it is totally worth the trouble.

This is GREAT! The crust is fabulous. Almond extract was slightly too much, I thought. (could've accidently put in too much...my hand wasn't feeling too steady after crunching up all that toffee). Tastes even better the second or third day.

Finally, I made this ! Served this at my Thanksgiving dinner party! Very, very rich - but delicious! It easily can serve 12-15 people, really. You do not need a very large piece! I'm glad I made this after reading the reviews. I did use six Skor bars for the filling ! What a dessert!!!

This is one of the best cheesecake recipes I have ever eaten. Use broken toffee pieces as garnish and bake topping for ten minutes instead of five. My husband rated this as a "10". (I agree!!) You won't be disappointed.

Rating: 4
Very good, very decadent. My neighbor says it was the best cheesecake she had ever eaten. You'll need about 6 Skor bars for the filling and I would chop them up finer than 1/2" square. I agree with others that it does not need additional candies on top...shaved chocolate was sufficient.

Fabulous! I used two packages regular plus two packages reduced-fat cream cheese, as well as low-fat sour cream for the topping, and it was still decadent. Toffee bits as a garnish make for an elegant presentation.

Delicous. Very rich and creamy. Followed exact recipe but used a 9 1/2" springform pan. Served 20 people. 3 chopped skor bars filled 1/2 cup. I decorated top with shaved chocolate. Quick and easy to make.

Easy to make and relatively inexpensive. Sooooooooo tasty! 8 out of the 10 people who tried it said it was my best cheesecake yet. I also baked the cake for an extra 5 minutes and baked it with the sour cream topping for about 11 minutes instead of 5. I was planning on adding chopped toffee bars and toasted almonds to the top before serving, but it was so beautiful and perfectly rich tasting, it didn't need a thing. Make this cheesecake!!!!!!!

Very sweet and rich. Because you only need a sliver of this cake, it feeds a lot of people.

Made this cheesecake for a dear friends birthday at work. Absolute raves from everyone. I agree with the lady who said that after adding the sourcream topping it should be baked more than 5 min. I did about 12. Also, instead of the candies on top, I had a little crust crumb mixture left over and sprinkled this over the finished cake. The flavor was a wonderfully delicate toffee. The friend said this recipe is definitely a "Keeper!!" Will definitely make this one again!!

I made this recipe for desert after a Christmas dinner . It was very good. I did not put the candies on the top. I thought it would be much too sweet. Instead I put chopped Skor Bars on top. It was very good!! I received many compliments.Thank you.

This is nice and light for a cheesecake. We omitted the skor from the crust. I think it would be better without the sour cream layer and it definately doesn't need the M&M's on top.

Of the three cheesecakes I've made in the past month (birthday cakes all) this was the forks-down winner. (The other two were Oreo and Maple.)Toffee flavour is subtle but certainly present; filling is moist, base -- yum, I could eat that all by itself. Use a jelly roll pan on the oven rack below the one that the cake is baking on to catch drips. I let the topping baked for 10 minutes rather than five -- it was better-set, but still very moist.

Rating: 3
This cheesecake turned out well - I served it at a special birthday dinner - and got a lot of nice comments on it. I found that when I got home from work the next day my houseguests had nearly finished it off! My only difficulty was that all the toffee bits got pushed out to the periphery when I added the second half of the filling. Next time I might just mix the bits into the filling before pouring it.

Rating: 4
This was my very first attempt at a cheesecake, and I was most impressed with the results! The cake was moist, with a subtle toffee flavor; the topping was a perfect contrast to the sweet toffee crust. I did not put any candies on top, I think it was better on its own. I highly recommend this one for the files!

Rating: 2
So disappointing! I had seen the recipe in my December issue, and then I read all the rave reviews, so I had to try it. All those toffee bars, and still no toffee flavor! This recipe tasted almost identical to the plain cheesecake recipe I use - they both use almond extract. I was expecting that with the dark brown sugar and the toffee it would be enough to create a distinctive flavor, but no. It wasn't worth wasting all those Heath bars.

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at a "real" cheesecake - springform pan and all - and it turned out beautifully. I guess I should have cooked it for an additional 5-10 minutes, because the center sank as it was cooling overnight, but that didn't affect the taste (maybe it's the altitude?). I decorated it with Heath "Bites" - little chocolate balls with toffee centers - and sliced almonds. Definitely worth making again!

I would make this dish again. I made it for a holiday party and everyone was raving that it was delicious!! They all wanted the recipe. The cream cheese taste was a little strong so I think next time I might not use the whole amount the recipe calls for. I also added whipped cream on the top w/ sprinkled toffee!!

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I put a piece of parchment underneath all of my cheesecakes. Then emoving the cheesecake should be easy, especially if you wait until the cheesecake is completely chilled. Before decorating, remove the collar from the pan, turn the cheesecake over, remove the pan bottom and the parchment, and invert the cake onto the serving plate.

This was a hit- I took all the other reviewers advice and didn't add m-ms, but I did cover it with small chocolate curls,which was good. My only problem was that the crust was really hard to get out in one piece-I'm guessing because the toffee in the crust. Did anyone else have this problem, and if so, any solutions?

I susbstituted Watkins Caramel extract for the almond in the filling and for the vanilla in the topping. I used Macintosh's English Toffee Bars combined with Skor in the crust, the filling and then sprinkled on top. I also used light cream cheese and it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

Made this for Christmas and we loved it, even my daughter liked it and she isn't overly fond of cheesecake. I didn't use the red/green candy on the top. I used crushed Heath Bars. This was an easy and special dessert!

This was a really delicious cheesecake. I have to agree with other raters, though: DON'T put M&M's on top. It looks good for about 5 minutes, then turns into this brown puddle of candy-coated sour cream. My suggestion would be to use chocolate syrup (either drizzle it on or make a decorative pattern). Also, I reduced the amount of toffee for cost's sake and it turned out just fine.

I served this for Christmas dinner dessert sans red and green candies. The crust was the best I've ever had (I used Skor toffee bits), but the filling was entirely too sweet for my taste. Next time, I would reduce the sugar in the filling and perhaps use less Heath bars (I used 6). Due to its sweetness and richness, this cake easily serves 12.

Fantastic recipe...after making it for Thanksgiving, it was requested for Christmas and New Year's. I too had to increase the cooking time, and would also skip the gumdrops and M and M's. The sour cream topping is great for hiding any imperfections that you might have on the top of the cooked cake!

Rating: 4
I baked the cheesecake about 5 minutes longer than stated. It turned out absolutely delicious. The recipe went right into my permanent file. I decorated the edge with Green & Red Jelly Bellys right before serving as I was concerned with "bleeding" also. I agree with with the reviewer who would use toffee to decorate in lieu of the green & red candy next time.

To Cook on 12/22, Good grief, why the attack on an innocent opinion by Kingston? Did someone step on your tail and make you cranky, my dear?

Rating: 3
55 minutes was not nearly enough baking time. I left it 5 minutes longer, pulled it out and put on the sour cream, thinking that the bit of a puff on the edges and slight cracks on top had been sufficient. 5 minutes later, it really started to puff on the edges so I left it in another 5, worrying about the sour cream being in too long. Finally, I had to pull it out before the sour cream started to brown, but it looks woefully underdone in the center. Cooling in the kitchen with my fingers crossed. Sure wish I had read these other reviews first.

Please tell me, cook from Kingston, Ontario, did you even even make this recipe? Or are you such an incredible CHEF that you can rate a recipe without even attempting it? If not, KEEP YOUR OPINIONS TO YOURSELF. YOU AND THOSE OF YOUR ILK ARE RUINING THIS WEBSITE!

I followed the recipe exactly and came out with a delicious and good-looking result. The toffee tase was yummy, and the crust was especially crunchy and tasty with the creamy filling. Like another reviewer here, my cake was slightly underdone-- I think it could have used an extra five to ten minutes in my oven. I wouldn't do the M&Ms, gumdrops, and sprinkles again-- they looked festive enough, but the tastes really don't mesh--especially the gumdrops--and I think guests at a potluck for 40 people avoided the cake in favor of other desserts because of the candy--it's overkill. Plus, if you have leftover cheesecake,the candy bleeds red and green everywhere-- sorta disgusting-- and who needs the food dye. Next time I will garnish the cake with chopped toffee bars and sliced almonds for a less garish presentation appropriate for any season.

The cake was delicious. Mine could have baked a little bit longer. Maybe it is my oven because none of the other reviewers seemed to have the same problem. The cake was slightly runny in the center. It still tasted great and got rave reviews, but next time I will bake it for about 5 minutes longer.

I'm not usually a big cheesecake fan, but I love toffee, and so I served this to a group of ladies for a Christmas luncheon dessert. There was not a crumb left! I used 1/4 cup of ground almonds in the crust instead of the sliced almonds, and I layered the filling and chopped Skor bars in three layers instead of just two. BTW, the recipe translates into 8 Skor bars.

Rating: 4
Everyone raved about it! I don't bake often, so I was a bit concerned that I might do something wrong and ruin a perfectly good recipe. But this one is goof-proof. I followed the directions, and the cheesecake looked perfect and tasted great! I decorated the top with holiday M&Ms in a Christmas wreath design,then made a red bow (tied a 1"-wide red ribbon to a toothpick)and stuck it in at at top of the wreath, with the ribbon ends draped down the center of the wreath and over the lower edge of the cake. My friends were impressed with my baking and presentation--and I owe it all to you! The cake is so rich it's quite a "heavy" dessert, so when cut in fairly narrow (but not skimpy) slices, it can easily serve 15-16.

I made this for an elementary school holiday staff luncheon. I followed the recipe exactly(since there were no reviews). It turned out PERFECT!!!! Everyone loved the wonderful, rich toffee flavor. I passed on the gumdrop/M&M topping, using instead tiny sprinkles in shapes of green holly leaves and red berries.

This recipe is a keeper! I made it for a brunch and had many requests for the recipe. I plan to make it again for Christmas Eve Dinner. I garnished the top with M & M's and gumdrops. I will just add a few candies for the topping garnish next time, as the dye in the candies starting bleeding onto the sour cream topping. I waited until the last minute to garnish with candies too. Very delicious toffee flavor.
