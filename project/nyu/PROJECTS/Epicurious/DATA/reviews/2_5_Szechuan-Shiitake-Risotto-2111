This dish needs some work. I used ground Szechuan peppercorns, thinking I wouldn't have to strain the broth - WRONG! The rice had a crunch to it, which people didn't seem to mind (or were they just being kind?). There is really no "asianness" to this dish - maybe more Soy sauce would make a difference, but there are other rice recipes out there (and some packaged varieties) that would do just as well. I'll try this again, if I have the time.

This had a great, rich beef flavor, but didn't taste that "asian." Make sure and use a reduced sodium beef broth..I didn't and it was too salty. Next time I make it,I will probably add some ginger and additional soy sauce, while minimizing the beef consomme, to give it the "oriental" flavor.
