Thought this was very good. Made a few similar substitutions to others...replaced the cucumber with red pepper, reduced soy to two tablespoons, and added two tablespoons of orange juice. Will definately make again.

I agree with others, cut soy sauce to two tablespoons, increase oil to 1/4 cup. Add two tablespoons orange juice to dressing.I added red bell peppers and carrots as well as topped with toasted sliced almonds. Everyone loved this salad. Yum!

This is a great recipe and relatively simple to make. I went with the variations from A Cook from NJ on 02/06/06.

This is a great go to recipe for a lighter meal. I use a store bought rotisserie chicken to make it quick. Also, I like the crunch of red bell pepper in here, and don't find the cucumber adds much (although I often find cucumber just a so so salad ingredient). Finally, I use a combo of the cabbage and some red leaf lettuce. Overall, a tasty dish. Oh, and I have used ground ginger when I am out of fresh - it works well, not quite as good but no reason to run out to the store for it.

I really liked this, but I did make a few alterations. I used purple cabbage for color. I followed the dressing recipe fairly closely, but had to substitute dried, crushed chilis for red pepper flakes (same thing? not sure) and had to use about 1/2 T of stone ground mustard to augment my low dijon mustard supply. The balance didn't seem right, so I then added juice of 1/2 lemon and about 2 1/2 T of sugar. In future, I'll definitely try tangerine slices and cashews or peanuts. I may also try orange juice instead of lemon and cut back on the sugar. Delish!

I went with someone's suggestion of using Low sodium soy sauce, reducing it to 2T and added 2T of orange juice. I also used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery which was a very tasty short-cut. I also added 1/3 cup of crushed peanuts and subbed the cucumber for red bell pepper. My husband LOVED this salad. I will definitely make it again.

This is a favorite. My husband loves it. Every time I make it for company I'm asked for the recipe. I have made a few changes to the recipe: * reduce soy sauce to 2-3 T * incrrease rice vinegar to 1/4 c * reduce vegetable oil to 1T * add 2t sugar to dressing * omit cucumber * add 3/4 c red bell pepper, julienned * add 3/4 c carrot, sliced diagonally Just my preferences. Love the recipe!

We liked this a lot. I thought the dressing needed sweetening so I added about 1.5 tablespoons of sugar. Also, my cabbage didn't look great, so I used butter lettuce instead, which was fine. The lettuce won't hold up overnight, but it worked fine in the moment.

Terrible, this recipe has much to be desired. Will not make again

Like others I thought this recipe had good bones. The first time I made it I followed the recipe as written. The second time I made a number of changes that I think work. Here they are. Dressing - Reduce the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons of reduced sodium soy sauce and replace the missing soy sauce with 2 tablespoons of fresh orange juice. Add 3 thinly sliced scallions. I replaced the pepper flakes with one teaspoon of Thai chili paste. Salad - I did not like the Napa cabbage. I agree with other reviewers that the salad needs color. I used half a regular cabbage and half a purple cabbage. I added one shredded carrot. I salted the cabbage, carrot and cucumber with 2 teaspoons Kosher salt for 1/2 hour to 45 minutes. I rinsed thoroughly and dried with paper towel. This makes the cucumber crisper and the cabbage easier to eat. I tossed the vegetables with dressing and plated it. I topped it with chicken, mandarin oranges and chow mein noodles. It was great. After salting the vegetables there were not quite enough for 4 portions. I will chop 3/4 of each medium cabbage next time.

Way too salty

My Notes:______ I was using 1 whole young Chicken, so I tripled the dressing and doubled the salad. ______ Dressing:______ I followed the reduction of the Soy Sauce, but ended up adding a splash more at the end, to taste. With a tripled dressing, I also used a combo of the Pepper Flakes with a few dashes of Cayenne Pepper. I also added 2 tsp of Wasabi Powder to the tripled dressing (really loved that addition). Also added a little Hot Ginger Mustard from the "Mendocino Jams & Jellies Co" as part of the 2-3 Tsp Dijon Mustard. Added a few dashes of sesame seeds for flair. ______ Salad:______ Doubled everything except the Cucumber & Scallions. Replaced Scallions with Green Onions (because the store didn't have them). Added a generous fistful of Cashews. Added a fistful of Dry Chow Mein noodles (which soften over time), added fresh ones at serving. (This is probably why I had to triple the dressing). Could've added a bit more Cucumber. ______ My hubby went nuts over the salad, and he's quite picky with his flavors. He ate everything!

Has potential, but the dressing is WAY too salty. I even used reduced sodium soy sauce. I'd highly recommend halving the amount of soy. Otherwise, it is an okay salad.

Excellent flavor with great texture. Made the following changes per previous reviewers: added grated carrot, and reduced soy sauce and vegetable oil to 1 Tbsp each. I'll make it again soon!

I made alterations as suggested by other reviewers, and this came out GREAT! Used a combo of Napa and red/purple cabbage, added orange bell peppers (carrots would be great, too), mandarin oranges, & walnuts. The oranges' flavor got lost a bit, but I'd still add them. I used 1/2 of the soy sauce called for, (reduced sodium), and that was more than enough. Peanut sauce was a great addition, too. Crunchy, yummy, and easy, I'll make this again!

I usually try to make a recipe in its original form before making alterations, so I followed this recipe exactly. Too bland for my taste and my husband agreed. The fact that all the vegetables are light green makes the salad somewhat boring in presentation. I can see where the added vegetables other reviewers recommended would improve the taste, but I just don't think I'll bother making it again. I have too many other chicken salad recipes that are far superior.

I also cut the vegetable oil to 1 TLB, added carrots, sliced oranges, red onion and nuts. I used left over pork tenderloin from the previous evening. Yummy

The freshest chicken salad recipe ever! Also a real crowd pleaser. Even with fewer chili flakes, it is still delicious.

Used a lot of suggestions from other people: added redpeppers, carrots, etc. Just more vegetables in general to make it look more interesting. Also-added tangerine segments and it was fantastic. It worked nicely with the saltiness of the dressing. DEFINITELY use the low sodium soy sauce - it's a hefty dressing! I will try using some toasted nuts next time.

I just used the dressing of this recipe, but added the zest of an orange. Really made a big difference.

I too read all the reviews and adapted: left the vegetable oil out of the dressing, used julienned carrots and green peppers and slivered almonds with the chicken, tossed it all with the dressing and served on salad greens. Delicious! Fresh and crunchy. Will make again.

I read all the other reviews and decided to experiment (sorry, recipe purists...) On the dressing, I eliminated the vegetable oil and ginger (forgot to buy it) and added a teaspoon each of peanut butter and maple syrup; sounds weird, but tasted good. To the salad, I took out everything except chicken (duh), scallions and cilantro. I added mandarin orange slices, cashews and chopped water chestnuts. I liked it, though next time I'll reduce the soy sauce a bit...I used low sodium, but it's still a bit salty for me. Good though. It sat in the fridge for a few hours and the flavors blended very well.

Rating: 3
Very good but not great. Yes, more colour would be a good idea but I was too tired to be creative today. All I did was toast some broken peanuts to sprinkle on the top. Very fast to make. Next time I would maybe decrease the veg oil as suggested and add other vegs like waterchestnuts, shredded carrots, bean sprouts - a bit more crunch would be welcome.

Rating: 4
Great recipe and a snap with the grocer store rotisserie chicken. I did not use any vegetable oil- seemed like too much oil with the sesame oil. The ingredients are interchangeable - i.e, use water chestnuts, or radishes, or brocolinni, or bean sprouts, or carrots, or red cabbage, or red onions or Chinese rice noodles. I made the dressing a few hours before so the flavors could meld. Have fun with this!

after following the advice of some of the reviews, i modified this salad by: julienned 1 red bell pepper and 1 yellow bell pepper (needed more color), 1/2 cup of slivered almonds (pan toasted) for some crunch, thinly sliced the cucumber down it's width instead of quartering or whatever, 1 tbsp of vegetable oil instead of 2, and 1 tbsp of sugar for a hint of sweetness in the dressing. it was pretty good--reminiscent of something you'd find in a decent deli--but not up to par of a quality restaurant. next time i might omit the tbsp of sugar and use candied almond slivers (toss almond slivers in 2 tbsp of melted butter with some brown sugar and some fresh herbs if u want to get fancy and experiment) and top the salad with them right before eating/serving. recommended overall.

As reviewed before..this salad definitely needs more color. I added diced red bell pepper and shredded carrots and skipped the cuke. Loved the dressing, it has a great tang to it!

This recipe is great. I tripled it and made it for a large party. I prepared everything the night before and just mixed it all together the night of the event. People were raving about how good it was. It was light, had a nice flavor and a good kick. I did reduce the vegetable oil a little bit and used low sodium soy sauce. I think it would have been too salty otherwise. Also, I grilled the chicken and used dark meat. It was delicious. This is a keeper!

This is sooooo yummy, especially with a few tweaks... grilled shrimp instead of the chicken (or grill the chicken and slice it), or even pork. Add coarsely chopped peanuts or almonds for crunch. You can even add crushed ramen noodles (really!), and the dressing soaks into them nicely and it is delicious!

Excellent - simple, beautiful, delicious! Substituted French beans for the snow peas and added diced red peppers to the salad mix for color. A perfect summer recipe!

Great Recipe! If you have a food processor to chop your veggies it goes by real quick! I used Tamari instead of Soy, and added carrots and red bell pepper. It was light and fresh! I took it for lunch the next couple of days because the recipe made soooo much!

Loved this recipe. Sure it has lots of ingredients, but the texture is wonderful. I plan to make this one again and again. You can even substitute other veggies for color.

I took everyone's advice and added the red pepper and purple cabbage. I also added the almonds. However the first time I made it I found the ginger too strong and added pineapple to cut it back. The second time I made it, I reduced the ginger to taste, about 3/4 of a tsp. It's fast and very easy to make!! Plus you can feed an army on it!

Upon noticing this salads color, I also added peppers and carrots. Like another user, I used blanched, slivered almonds for crunch- this made a wonderful lunch!To the cook from Greenwood: If you haven't made it, don't knock it! It was quick, easy, and delicious!

The second time I made it I added diced red pepper and some carrot and it dressed up the look and flavor. All those green ingredients needed a splash of color. The dressing and napa cabbage make it irresistable.

I didn't make the salad; only the vinaigrette. I had to play around a little with the amounts; like adding a extra sesame oil. A few toasted sesame seeds don't hurt. Also, I find it is much better after a day or so in the fridge, after the flavors have had a chance to 'marry'. Once you get this figured out, this is wonderful; This is going to be my new 'house dressing'.

Added carrott as suggested, thought that went well. Very pleased with the results, but I would use only white chicken meat next time. Left overs the next day were too soggy to eat though, would reserve the dressing for just before eating individual portions. Almonds might be a nice addition too.

I made this without the chicken, increased the cabbage, and added grated carrot. The dressing is delicious.

This is a good quick meal. Good compliment for a dinner or alone for a lunch. Next time I make it, I would add something for color like shredded carrots. It has a lot of green color. The cabbage gives it a good crunchy texture. Enjoy.

Way too salty!!! I was bit suspicious when the dressing called for a 1/4 cup of soy sauce but I followed the recipe exactly. I'm usually very pleased with Gourment's recipes but this was a big disappiontment. Not worth the effort or time it took to chop and blend ingredients.

Wanted to try this recipe right away so used what I had on hand: HALVED the recipe using 10 oz. pkg. Perdue Short Cuts Roasted Chicken pcs. and instead of the napa cabbage (which I love) I used shredded regular cabbage. I also adjusted the other veggie amounts to more or less, to suit my taste.... No biggie! Used low sodium soy sauce. Loved the bite in the dressing and I think sesame oil and red pepper flakes are wonderful together. Topped ea. serving with packaged crunchy chinese noodles. Enjoy! KIMBER

this was a very good, non-mayonnaisy chicken salad...I like the Asian taste...would add mandarin oranges or cashews as other readers suggested, but this is good to have in the fridge. Would definitely make again.

Pretty good. I drizzled Thai Peanut Sauce on before serving and added toasted cashew nuts. The salad is very green, next time I'll add some shredded carrots for color. Would also be good with some fried wontons or those crunchy oriental noodles. Served with Cucumber-Avocado soup from August 2000 Bon Appetit. An easy summer meal.

I thought the dressing was a little too salty, although my husband thought it was fine. Next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce or cut back a little on the regular. I added a handful of roughly chopped dry roasted peanuts to the top of the salad just before serving. Mandarin oranges would also be a good garnish. All in all, a nice hot weather, summer time salad. (I think the dressing would also make a great barbeque marinade for flank steak, chicken, or pork!)
