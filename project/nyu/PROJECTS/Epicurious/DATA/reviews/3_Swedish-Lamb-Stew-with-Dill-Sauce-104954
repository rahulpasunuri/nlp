I liked this very much. Very easy to make and satisfying. I used dried dill and rosemary (always very good with lamb) and black peppercorns and it was okay. I served Rolled Potato Dumplings and Beets with Horseradish on the side. The next I'm going to use pork shoulder cubes.

Just okay. You have to like lamb because the result is pretty 'lamby' tasting. The stew only needed an hour on simmer. The meat was tender and moist. Overall the stew didn't have any pizazz. It's impossible to separate the vegetables from the meat and I think leaving the veggies in added some flavor. I served this over noodles with Baby Greens, Pears, Walnuts, and Blue Cheese Salad.

This recipe was easy to prepare. I added 1/2 of a lamb boullion cube and a little white wine to the water. Next time I'll leave out or use only half the sugar and maybe use 1 T sour cream and 1 T whipping cream. Also, the cooking time given was too long for our stew -- the meat was done in about an hour. It's important to keep checking.
