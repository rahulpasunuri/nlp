My 4yo and I made this. Very yummy at 2 stages (1st when just shallots and butter are cooked/tossed with the cauliflower-I accidently added the full amt of butter when sauteing the shallots and 2nd at the final stage). I used green and orange cauliflower. The whole family loved it.

This was very good! It was pretty with the different colors and it was a nice way to serve cauliflower. It was even better the next day when the flavors had come together a little more.

I added at least double the mustard to both the sauce and the bread crumbs. Also used more sage in the sauce along with thyme and tarragon. I used plain panko crumbs for the sage mustard topping and no one will care whether the stems are up, down or sideways. Delicious!

Delish. I don't like mustard so cut that and subbed rosemary for the sage. I used veg broth to make it vegetarian and the butter wasn't necessary. I just crumbled the cornbread over the top. Excellent reviews from the entire family.

Very good. Nice side dish.

SO GOOD! My husband hates cauliflower, but he loved this! The kids were fighting over the leftovers. I have made several times, sometimes I have all the ingredients on hand and follow exactly, sometimes I make substitutions, but it always comes out delicious. Definitely a family favorite already.

Adjusted to make gluten-free, using purchased gluten-free breadcrumbs and rice flour to thicken sauce. Very tasty. Arranging cauliflower stem down was a bit more labor than I was willing to do in the middle of cooking several dishes: didn't seem to be harmed by the by leaving some stems up. I would agree about steaming the cauliflower a little less: the texture was a bit softer than I'd prefer. The flavor was milder than I expected with that much mustard: the lemon peel was the strongest flavor. Very nice and I will make again.

This was delicious! In fact, I thought it was tastier the next day as leftovers. I will make this again. A great holiday dish.

Very good! Several people at potluck asked for the recipe. I've made it a couple times - once as written and once with some adjustments. I prefer regular breadcrumbs to the cornbread crumbs (which made the dish a little sweet for my tastes). I also liked the sauce even better with a little extra mustard, sage, and lemon peel. Zesty, savory, and wonderful! Next time, will try with milk instead of cream to cut down on fat.

It is ridiculous how good this is. Even harder to believe it's made without cheese. Have had it for 2 dinners and both times everyone raved. Even the kids ate it without incident.

This was so tasty! Don't change a thing & impress your friends. Would be a great dish for a potluck.

The cauliflower dish was a big hit with my dinner club.I did add some grated cheddar cheese to the 'sauce' step the second time I made it though and the cheese definitely made it a real 'gratin'.

Made this for our dinner club and everyone loved it. It is delicious, rich and the sweetness of the cornbread added a nice touch. I followed the recipe exactly- no changes needed.

Thanks, everyone, for giving this dish high ratings. Outcome was fantastic, better than expected! Made Trader Joe's cornbread earlier in the day and cut the cream by about 50% with 1% milk. Delicious! This recipe has already been added to my favorites.

Oh, yes, yes! Wonderful. So aromatic with the sage, lemon and mustard. I didn't change a thing. Husband loved it and my six-year-old tried it, which is more than he usually does for unfamiliar vegetables. Recommended.

Delicious! Wish I had found this recipe prior to the holidays. What a lovely way to eat cauliflower. I served it with meatloaf and it was a perfect side dish. My husband raved and asked for it to be added to our regular revolving set of side dishes! I followed the recipe exactly except that my shallots browned a bit more than I'd planned due to multitasking. Even so, the dish was one of the best veggie dishes I have made in a long time -- very hearty. I think I would have steamed the cauliflower a bit less since we like firmer cauliflower and it will be baked anyway. Used leftover cornbread that I'd made previously for another meal. Just a lovely set of flavors in this dish including the sage which was not overpowering. Could also be a "main course" for vegetarians. This one is a definite keeper!

Needed a dish for folks who do not love roasted cauliflower (as I do) and needed to cook it fast. This was a winner. I was in a rush and did not have time to reduce the recipe amounts based on a single cauliflower head. I punted and it worked. I also did some shortcuts (starting at the sauce) that sped the process along. After mixing the sauce in a bowl (used 1 tsp mustard and sage with peel but less cream and no flour,salt or pepper), I added sauce to the skillet and let it thicken with the cauliflower. I tossed it in the baking dish and made the topping with significantly less mustard due to my salt sensitive Mom. Served with leftover beef rib roast and sauteed sugar snap peas. It was great and she loved it!!

This was so good, I,m thinking about having the leftovers for breakfast.

This was excellent. I might increase the amount of mustard and sage next time. One iron skillet full of white cornbread made enough crumbs for 4 batches, so I've got 3 bags on hand in the freezer.

I made this for my family last night and it was a huge hit. I used cornbread stuffing mix instead of cornbread b/c I had it left over. Everybody came back for seconds - of CAULIFLOWER... go figure.

Served this at Thankgsiving dinner,used all the called-for ingredients. It was delicious and a "keeper" except...I was in a hurry and picked up some cornbread from a cheaper grocery store bakery; it was too heavy and sweet for the topping. Next time I'll be more selective of the cornbread, or perhaps better yet, use white or whole wheat bread crumbs. Also, be careful to not overcook the cauliflower; mine was done steaming in less than 8-10 minutes.
