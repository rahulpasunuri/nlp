i agree with the previous reviewer that there isn't enough sugar, so upped the amount just slightly to a cup. talk about a sugar high!

This is meant to be used in the chocolate hazelnut torte recipe. I wouldn't recommend it for anything else. There's not a lot of sugar, so when it's poured out, it's more of a lump of hazelnuts rather than a praline.
