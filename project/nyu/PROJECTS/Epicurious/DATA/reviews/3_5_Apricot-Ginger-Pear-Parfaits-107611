It was pretty good but I didn't love it. It just lacked something.

My family had these for our Sunday morning breakfast and they were delicious. I did not add the pear cores, only used 1 tbs of sugar, and I pureed in the food processor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. When I served the parfaits, I did add an extra layer of vanilla yogurt and one layer of crushed wheat biscuit cereal (mini wheats). Very filling and yummy, yet healthy.

Served this parfait as the starter course at Christmas brunch. It was so good it overshadowed the eggnog french toast that followed. Per reviews, I cut back on the ginger. I used a zester on the peeled ginger to get a very fine juicy ginger puree. I also used the zester for the lemon zest. Rather than a food mill, I used my immersion blender, and I did add another tablespoon of sugar to the sauce at the end. I used Dannon LaCreme Vanilla yogurt. Also, did not bother to peel the diced pears. Everything was divine. The whole thing tasted like a rich dessert. Yum!

It's the second time I prepare this for my husband and I. We really like it. However, the ginger flavor is really strong, and I suggest putting a bottom layer of yogurt (to finish on a sweet note) or a larger proportion of yogurt to the cups. I do not own a food mill, nor a food processor, so I simply chopped the apricots and cored pears into small pieces, and finely grated the ginger and zest before cooking. I added a pear to make up for the lost cores. This made it more time consuming, but worth it.

I had this dinner party the other night and everyone loved this dessert. It was super easy to make but pealing all the fruit took a while but it was worth it. Adding chocolate chips at the end would be great.
