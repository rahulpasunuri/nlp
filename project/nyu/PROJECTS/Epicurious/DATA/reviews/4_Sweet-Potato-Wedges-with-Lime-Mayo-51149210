I was a little unsure of the lime mayo, but this was great! It was a perfect combination. I made this tonight and my son and I "accidentally" ate it all...

Simple, nutritious, satisfying (even as a dessert to satisfy a sweet tooth). My husband loves these on the side portobella mushroom burgers. I've made these at least once to twice a week since I found the recipe here. The mayo is easy and tangy, the perfect compliment to the sweet potatoes :)

Outstanding and so simple! Take these to the next gathering you are invited to and you will never have an empty social card again. One of the guys even went to the market(in the middle of the game!)to get more limes so we could make more lime sauce for the Hot Wings still in the oven(he brought back more sweet potatoes too). Definitely a keeper!
