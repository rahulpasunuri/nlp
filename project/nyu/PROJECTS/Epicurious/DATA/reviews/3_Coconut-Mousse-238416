Canned coconut milk would prob work, but fresh is so much better. I make mine from a fresh coconut and have leftover milk for a Thai chicken dish. Bake a whole coconut at 350 for about 10 min then crack it in a metal bowl covered with a towel with a hammer (breaks easily after being baked). Discard outer shell and peel brown skin away with a vege peeler. Grate coconut meat then place in cheesecloth and tie. Pour about 1 1/2 cups hot water over and steep a few minutes. Squeeze, discard solids. (Less water for thicker milk, more for thinner.) BTW - great mousse!!!

This dessert tasted great! My only complaint is that it was a LOT of work and there were many dishes/appliances to clean afterwards.

Of course you could go ahead and substitute the dried coconut process for 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk.

I haven't made this yet but could you not substitute canned coconut milk instead of squeezing out the milk fron the hot water and dried coconut blend?
