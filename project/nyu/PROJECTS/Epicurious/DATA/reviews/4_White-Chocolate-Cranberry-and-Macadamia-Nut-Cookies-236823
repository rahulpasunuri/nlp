Everyone at the office loved these. I followed the recipe as written but shortened the baking time to 9 minutes and baked the cookies on parchment. I think an extra 2 minutes of baking time would enhance the flavor of the macadamia's more, so I'll try that next time.

I agree that these need to bake just 12-15 minutes. I used 1 cup dried cherries and 1 cup dark chocolate chips instead of 1.5 cups dried cranberries and 1.5 cups white chocolate, and they turned out great.

Delicious! The cooking time is too long on the recipe, so take them out a few minutes early. I think they tasted much better the day after baking. Will definitely make these again.

I used white chocolate chunks instead of chips for a more decadent effect. Also, I skipped the nuts for some friends who are allergic, but the cookies are still fantastic!

OMG! I have just discovered my new favorite cookie. A couple of tips; take them out at 12-14. They will not look cooked but they will be perfect when they cool. Next, do not chop the nuts to small. Leaving nice big chunks allows you to really get the pop. Otherwise a really expensive nut gets lost and you don't get the flavour.

Excellent recipe. I made them as directed. I used a level tablespoon and baked 15 minutes. Rave reviews. Will make again during the holiday season.

I love these cookies. The only change I made was not including the salt because the nuts were so salty. Next time I would include 1/2 t of salt. I cooked them 14 min. And made about 40 cookies. Will definitely use again. Delicious:) Looked just like the picture.

BAKE TIME IS TOO LONG! You know those 'boutique' cookie shops? Well, this cookie is one that you will find there...but save gas and make it at home. Wonderful treat! One note of caution: listed bake time is too long. I happened to check at 12 minutes, and even that was too long, making a crunchy style cookie through 'n through. I prefer a slightly soft center, so I figure a bake time of 10 minutes max should do it. Otherwise, this is a stellar cookie recipe which we will use again.

Buttery, sweet, salty... so delicious!! These are my new all-time fav Christmas cookies! They are a hit all the time and are a great cookie that's a little different; stands out. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies taste wonderful! I did make some slight modifications. I replaced some of the butter with applesauce. I also reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 instead of 1 cup (due to previous reviewer recommendations). I used 1/2 cup of honey instead of adding granulated sugar. I made the large size cookies and baked them 17 minutes. The cookies ended up kind of cake like in the middle. My husband and I loved the results! I will definitely make these again and I'll experiment with different chips and dried fruit. This recipe is a winner!

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe as is but swapped the white chocolate for semi-sweet dark chocolate and the macadamia nuts for pecans because they were cheaper :) It was delicious! One change - the time in the recipe is long, I made the larger cookies and only kept them in there 15 minutes which turned out perfectly! Yum!!

Rating: 4
Have reviewed these beforejetted again because I tried something different. Made one batch as directed. Made a second batch of the dough, and added dried cherries and dark chocolate rather than the other ingredients. For softer, chewy cookies, take out a few minutes early. Both versions went over well-again- at an annual party. Am I invited every year for these cookies?

Rating: 4
I make these every Christmas. I use dried cherries rather than cranberries for a little more tartness to balance the sweet white chocolate. It's a splurge, but well worth the money for a nice holiday treat and a tradition. Everyone who eats them asks for the recipe. I have some in the oven now - can't wait for the buzzer to go off!

These are really good cookies. I did reduce the sugars to about half specified and macadamia nuts were too pricy, so I used hazelnuts (on sale at the store). The texture is great and my boyfriend said they are now his favorite cookies. I think I'll be making them a lot.

Ingredients 125g/4½oz plain flour 25g/1oz cocoa powder 1½ tsp baking powder 150g/5oz caster sugar 50g/2oz butter, softened at room temperature 1 free-range egg 8 tbsp milk For the cream cheese icing 50g/2oz cream cheese 25g/1oz butter, softened at room temperature 125g/4oz icing sugar, sifted ½ tsp vanilla essence For the chocolate icing 25g/1oz icing sugar 1 tbsp cocoa powder Directions Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a muffin tray with 9 paper cases. Sift the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder into a bowl. Add the sugar and butter and beat the mixture together until well combined. Whisk in the egg and milk until the mixture is thick and smooth. Divide the mixture between the paper case and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until springy to the touch and skewer inserted into the middle of one of the cakes comes out clean. Set aside to cool on a wire rack. For the cream cheese icing, beat the cream cheese and butter together in a bowl until well combined. Beat in the icing sugar and vanilla. Spoon the icing onto the cupcakes, leaving a small border around the edge. For the chocolate icing, sift the icing sugar and cocoa powder into a bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons of water to form a smooth, thick icing. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag with a fine nozzle. (Alternatively, spoon the mixture into the corner of a sandwich bag and snip off the corner, to form a small hole.) Carefully pipe 3 concentric circles onto each cupcake. Run a toothpick from the centre to the edge of the cake, through each circle of icing, at 2cm/1in intervals to create a cobweb effect. Set aside for 20 minutes to allow the icing to harden.

These cookies are some of the best I've ever tasted or made! There is a nice balance of sweet and salty, something I think most cookies lack. These are nice and buttery with a lot of rich vanilla flavor as well. The texture was also perfection - slightly crispy on the outside and moist, dense and cakey on the inside. The white chocolate and cranberries help keep the cookie nice and moist. And the combination of chips, cranberries and macadamias is wonderful. I didn't alter a thing.

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a low carb solution to this recipe. Substitiued Splenda brown sugar, whole wheat flour, splenda sugar. For a variation I have used Michigan tart cherries instead of cranberries and pecan pieces compliment the cherries well.

Excellent recipe. I followed the suggestions of previous comments and decreased my brown sugar to 3/4 with very good results. My cookies were crunchy and the cranberries provided the perfect, tart note to the salty and sweet cookie. I actually made half a batch with cranberries and half a batch with tart cherries, and was surprised that I liked the cranberries best! The cherries weren't tart or chewy enough in comparison.

Rating: 4
I've made these twice now and they are delicious. Definitely a more dense, cake like cookie. But I have made the larger size -- going to try smaller portions next go round. I will say I have used large organic eggs each time and had to add a third to get proper consistency (both times), maybe it was the eggs I used, but worth noting. Tried both the original recipe and dark chocolate with pecans (success!). They've been a hit.

Rating: 3
These cookies are great! I love chewy cookies, and mine turned out just that way. I absolutely love the white choc, cranberry, macadamia combo, but I am looking forward to experimenting with dark chocolate and other fruits & nuts. The only thing I would do differently is use less sugar- maybe even half the amount- it's totally unnecessary. The best part of the cookies--- the salty crunchy macadamia nuts!!!! If you like the salty/sweet thing (and who doesn't?), make sure you use roasted salted macadamias!

I made this cookie as one of many for my annual christmas cookie tray...I have to say this was absolutely delicious and of the 17 different varieties I made, this was among my top two, second only to my peanut butter chocolate chip nutter butter cookie...I highly recommend this cookie...it was so good I used this recipe to make a second batch of chocolate chip cookies, replacing the white chocolate and cranberries for semi sweet and bittersweet chocolate chunks....these were the best chocolate chips I've ever made!

This is my second year making them for the holiday season. I just grabbed one and thought I had to share my thoughts. Delish! I usually share my tweeks and changes to the recipe and I can say that I have none for this one follow as says. A great simple recipe with a fantastic tasting cookie. I recommend.

Rating: 4
I never thought I would love a cookie such as this. Not a big fan of cranberries, or white chocolate, and macadamias are hella expensive. But I made them at Dad's request, and lemme tell ya, the man knows a good cookie when he sees one. I now make them every holiday season, and everyone loves them as much as I do. Comments about baking times are to be believed: baking them for 15 min when making the "large" size works out best.

Rating: 4
Good recipe, but not the one I was looking for. Bake time is way too long. I lower the temp to about 330 and time to 10-12 min to achieve a chewy moist cookie. Longer either crisp or burned. Will not use for our cookie contest. Nothing remarkable, but good.

I use this as my go to recipe!!! I substitute one cup semi sweet chocolate chips, one cup white chocolate chips and one cup dark chocolate chips for the dried cranberries & white chocolate chips. Also substitute chopped pecans for macadamia nuts. I bake in a convection oven and place scoops of cookie dough on parchment lined baking sheets. This is always a hit. For bake sales, I place a popsicle stick in the ball of raw cookie dough and flatten on the baking sheet. Bake normal length of time, cool on baking sheets, then wrap in plastic wrap with a ribbon. These become Triple Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie Pops!!!

These are my holiday cookies of choice, and because the rest of the family likes them so much as well I usually end up making myself my own secret stash.

I made these cookies for my boyfriend on Father's day thinking it would be a sweet idea since he loves Macadamia nuts. The DOUGH was the only thing that he and I couldn't get our hands out of. Following the recipe word-to-word, the cookies came out ROCK HARD! Even keeping the cookies in for less time came out more hard than soft. This would be a great recipe for people who like cake-like cookies but something should be done to prevent the cookies from getting very hard.

Rating: 4
These cookies were VERY easy to make and everyone at the office loved them! I couldn't find roasted, salted macadamia nuts so I chopped mine up a little bit and toasted them with a little salt. The crunch from toasting adds good texture, I then reduced the salt I added to the batter by just a little bit.

Rating: 4
These were AWESOME! I added more than the stated amount of chips, as I couldn't see saving what little I had left, and I was a tad short on nuts and cranberries due to the package sizes. I also made them bigger than recommended so they took longer to cook. Even with all my attempts to screw them up, thay still came out great and everyone LOVED them! I'm making them again right now...

Great combination of flavors. the sweetness of the cranberries offsets the salt and crunch of the the macadamia nuts well, and the white chocolate just adds an extra but not overpowering depth to the mix. nice crisp outside with soft cakey chewy insides. I baked these for the recommended time and they came out lightly browned on top and crisp on the bottom. They will look and feel soft when done but a good way to know for sure is to peak underneath. I will surely be making these again.

Rating: 4
These were AWESOME! Sooo delicious! I used egg whites, 1/3 of the flour was whole wheat, and I only used 3/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar and they were still sweet...I think next time I might just half all the sugar (the white choc. chips and craisins already give so much sweetness, the full amt would be too much) My husband and our friend loved it, and it made 3 dozen cookies, aka plenty to share at the office! :) I agree with other posts, check them in the oven, mine took between 12-13 minutes. I'd definitely make these again!

Very good cookie. I decreased sugar slightly as recommended by others and used a mix of dark chocolate left over from other recipes. Definitely check after 10 minutes during baking. I found 11 to 12 minutes perfect for lightly golden brown cookies. Next time I will decrease the macadamia nuts by a 1/4 cup and chop into smaller pieces - nuts were a bit too big for my taste. But, very nice overall and will be worth trying again with other modifications suggested.

Wonderful cookie. Loved the texture and balance of flavors. Used Splenda in place of the white sugar and reduced to 1/2 cup (instead of 3/4 cup). Still perfectly sweet. I wouldn't have wanted them any sweeter. Baked on silpat mats rather than parchment paper. Wonderful recipe and a big hit!

This recipe was a hit with everyone. The store was out of white chocolate chips so I used an organic chocolate bar broken into pieces. It would probably use 3 bars instead of 2 next time, they were so yummy. I only baked them for 10 minutes and they were pretty dark on the bottom, which was okay because it gave them a nice crispness. All around, these are really fun and very popular!

I have a really stupid question. I am not a baker, and want to make these for a party, and don't want to screw up. It says you can make them ahead and freeze. I'm assuming it means I can make the dough ahead of time and freeze it. Has anyone done this? If so, how did it affect your baking time? Did you have to allow time to thaw before baking?

I make these cookies every year, and people always rave about them. I have always made them exactly as written, except the first time I left out the cranberries. I always use them now-the tartness balances the sweetness and richness in the cookie, and the saltiness of the nuts just puts it over the top. I think they are perfection, and I will continue to make them for years. This year I'm going to try to turn them into a bar cookie, for my Christmas cookie trays. I'll let you all know how they turn out!

I intend to bake these but was wondering if anyone had experimented with fresh cranberries? I noticed some reviewers commented on the sweetness of the cookie and I would guess that maybe the fresh cranberries would counteract that? Any suggestions welcome!

These cookies are awesome! I ran across the recipe in two different places (a blog I love to read and on the epicurious app on my iPhone) so I was destined to make them. I followed the recipe exactly, except I chopped the cranberries and only used about a cup. However, they would be fine with 1 1/2 cups. I used a cookie scoop (like a little ice cream scoop) and the recipe made 58 cookies. I baked them for 11-12 minutes and took them out of the oven when they just started to brown around the edges. So Yummy and buttery!! I could eat the entire batch!

My roommate just ate one of these and said, "This is the best cookie I've had in my entire life." These cookies are delicious and extremely easy to make, but also easy to overcook... if making the smaller size, ten minutes on the top third of the oven is where it's at.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The white chocolate, dried cranberries, and macadamia nuts are wonderful together. These cookies are very dense however and could be a little lighter.

These are a "keeper". I didn't have macadamias so I subbed, walnuts. They were still great. Must remember to stick to the original cooking time. At first I thought they weren't done, but after resting they were perfect. The second batch was overdone. Loved the white chocolate. Next time I'm going to try the same recipe with dark chocolate chips and dried cherries. I'll bet they will be just as yummy.

I used almonds, and Welch's Dried Fruit Medley, decreased the white sugar by half. They were just ok. I will try it again using cranberries, I know now that they need the tartness. And the almonds I thought were too crunchy, while macadamia nuts would have been perfect. I did not rate it because I didn't follow the recipe.

Wow, super easy and delicious! I did not have white chocolate so I used toffee bits instead and they came out beautifully. Not too sweet and so easy. They also look like they will hold up well in shipping. I was concerned when I started stirring in the berries, nuts, etc that the dough was too dry but it just too a little extra elbow grease. Yum!

This was excellent. I salted and roasted my macademia nuts at 325 for a little over 10 minutes. I discovered that I only had about 1 T. of craisins, but I had half a bag of frozen cranberries, so I thawed them, then covered them with sugar, put them on a rimmed pan, and stuck them into the oven at 325 for about 30 minutes. I would check them about every 10 minutes, shake, and add more sugar. The batter looked pink, but after baking, they were still white but almost looked bluish on the back. It made a ton and I LOVE them.

I have a new favorite cookie. I must admit that I omitted the cranberries, and instead used a 12 oz. bag of white chocolate chips and 1-1/2 cups of macadamia nuts. I didn't realize the recipe called for roasted and salted macadamias, but the cookies turned out wonderfully with plain ones. I rolled the dough into 1-1/4 inch balls (the recipe yielded exactly 5 dozen cookies this way) and baked them for 10 minutes, as they just started to brown and before they had a chance to flatten out too much. Absolutely delicious.

I would have given this four forks if the proportions were more reasonable. Even on my first attempt, I used less sugar than the recipe called for, but the cookies were still far too sweet.

This is an amazing cookie! It may take over as my new favourite chocolate chip cookie. They're perfectly soft, slightly chewy and a bit crispy at the edges. And still soft the next day. I underbaked them a bit (13-14 minutes) and will try adding more vanilla next time. I made them omitting the cranberry, and another version with chopped Toblerone (no white chocolate, nuts or cranberries). Make sure to use ROASTED/TOASTED macadamia nuts - raw ones taste weird in the cookie (as I learned).

Rating: 3
I agree with some others in that this is a little sugary for my taste. The basic recipe is for chocolate chip cookies, so the sugar content is adequate for that recipe. Given the sweetness of the white chocolate and the sweetness of the macadamia's, you could cut the sugar in almost half. Before I baked these, I made up another batch with reduced sugar, didn't add the nuts or white chocolate and mixed these two together to get a less sweet cookie.

I'm sure they're great with the cranberries but decided to omit them - the cookies are fabulous and addicting! When using a light pan with a silpat they come out crispy, flatter, and more "perfect" looking. When using a rimmed darker non-stick pan they come out as pictured, and softer. Both are delicious!

These turned out perfectly--just as written. I only had dried cherries on hand and substituted for cranberries. Worked very well. And these cookies look perfect, too.

Everyone loved them! Made 30 big cookies and they were gone in seconds.

These were good...not out of this world good, but a good family recipe. I was looking for one that was denser and richer...like the coffee-shop kind.

I substituted cherries for the cranberriesbut otherwise followed the recipe. They are delicious! I used a cookie scoop that holds just over a tablespoon and baked the cookies 12 and a half minutes. Perfect. Will definitely make again and sub different chips, nuts, etc.

I bake cookies all the time. When I made these, they were voted the best cookie I have ever made by a majority of the crowd.

My favorite Christmas cookie! I added orange zest too and have tried it with pecans. A winner!

Wow! I loved this cookie recipes. This might be my very favorite cookie. I used almonds instead of macadamia nuts, and they still turned out great.

These are excellent! Had to make 2 batches over the holidays. They will be added to my must-have Christmas cookies (snickerdoodles and peanut butter blossoms)

Good stuff! Made these for my husband's work team and they loved them! A lot of flavors but they worked well together. A great addition to the holiday cookie jar.

Delish, easy to make, and everybody loved them. Can't go wrong with these! I would, however, recommend baking the cookies for only 10 minutes (15 minutes is too long for the small cookies - they will likely burn).

These were very easy and delicious. The holiday colors make them especially good for gifts or cookie exchanges.

These cookies were very easy to make and were delicious. Everyone loved them and I had many requests for the recipe. The baking time seemed too long for my batch so I shortened it by several minutes and they came out beautifully. I will make these cookies all year round. Definately a keeper.

Great Christmas Cookies.

I took pine nuts and substituted them for macadamias. I also baked the cookies for about 12 minutes. What the timing comes down to is just getting a feel for your oven. I like the cookies a lot. Next time, I might even put some lemon zest, drop the white chocolate and leave the cranberries and nuts speak for themselves.

These look great but they only taste marginal to me, nothing special. The white chocolate chips have no flavor at all and the macadamia nuts don't have much either. I like the idea of sweet and salty tastes but these are just not worth it to me.

I made the small size cookies, and 15 minutes in the oven would have been way too long. I took the first batch out after 12 and they were already very dry and too dark on the bottom. The second batch only got 10 minutes and were perfect. Also - I used dried cherries instead of cranberries (making the pistachio/cran icebox cookies and didn't want too much of the same flavor) and the switch was delicious.

I don't like white chocolate, so I used semi-sweet choc. chips, and I added about 4-6 oz. flaked, sweetened coconut. I also used a little extra on the amount of chips, cranberries and nuts. Marvy! Everybody loved it! Well worth the cost of the macadamias. Great bring-with dish.

Good stuff. A solid holiday cookie. Very festive looking. I followed the recipe as written and it came out perfect.

Delicious and easy - I couldn't keep my husband away from them (and they were supposed to be gifts). I used plain macadamia nuts instead of salted and roasted.

Too sweet for my taste. I will make them again because they are pretty and easy. Will definitely decrease the amount of sugar AND of vanilla.

These are my new favorite cookies. I have made them 4 times since I found the recipe. Everyone loves them. The first time they were a little too sweet for me, I cut back the white sugar just a bit and added more cranberries. I love the chewy tartness of the cranberries. Everyone I have shared these with wants the recipe. Very Christmasy too, with the red of the berries.

This is one GREAT combination of flavors. Very rich but totally delicious. They were very soft and seemed uncooked --like they could fall apart --when I took them out of the oven (maybe all cookies are that way ... I hardly ever make any) so I left them in to bake longer. This was a mistake. The 2nd batch, baked just the amount of time suggested in the recipe, was perfect... good and chewey! You can bet I'll be making these again!

Made this cookie for a cookie swap this year. It was EXCELLENT! Be aware, the nuts are a bit pricey. This is a definate keeper!

Awsome. These are wonderfully indulgent cookies. The tart cranberries balance the super sweet white chocolate and then you get a hit of salty, buttery macadamia nut. They are very satisfying. Two notes; I did not chop the macadamia nuts. I like the impact of the large pieces. I had difficulty getting the add-ins evenly distributed. Next time I will press the dough flat on the counter, sprinkle the add-ins evenly over the dough and then kneed it to combine. Easy and well worth the price of ingredients.

These were not hard, I did find a bag of Nestle white choc. chips with macadamia nut pieces in it, so I used that bag. It didn't have a lot of mac. nut taste to it, but it saved me a lot of money when making these cookies. The taste of the cranberry and chips together were very nice.

These cookies were fabulous and loved by all. The macadamia nuts added a very decadent touch and the cranberries were the perfect tart compliment to all the sweet. My guests and friends loved these cookies!

Sorry to be the first "nay" on this recipe but I thought it was pretty ho-hum. The cookies were both overly sweet and dry. And it's not worth the expensive ingredients.

easy. made without the nuts and still very good. definitely "guest-worthy"

Excellent - very nummy, chewey, crunchy. The base is like a chocolate chip cookie dough. I baked a few minutes less because I prefer softer, more chewey cookies than crisp.

Loved it!!! Macedamia nuts make it extra rich - would be just as great without them!!

Made these as written. They were a huge hit with my family. Will look beautiful on Christmas Cookie Gift Plates. Very easy to make.

These cookies are absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. I chose to make the smaller size, which turned out plenty big enough. I will definitely make these again.
