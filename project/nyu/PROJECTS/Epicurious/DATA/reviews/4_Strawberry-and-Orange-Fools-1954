not a speck leftover! Very tasty, made a great, simple end to a traditional Irish dinner for St. Patrick's Day.

We brought this to a party and everyone went for seconds over tasting the other desserts. We tripled the recipe, didn't add in the zest, reduced the sugar and added the chocolate as the other reviews suggested. Also used Grand Marnier. We felt like it needed some substance so we layered the fool w/ cubed angel food cake. I was worried it would be soggy but the cake stayed in tact and it was AMAZING. I will make this for every summer party I go to! LOVE the fool.

Wow, big returns for little effort. Flexible to boot. Have used turbinado sugar, teeny wait to dissolve but made an earthy cream, fat free Greek yogurt, and grappa. Per others, as long as the yogurt's thick, low fat, no fat, full fatall good.

Used fresh Strawberries as they are in season. Cut back on the sugar a tad as the berries are nice and sweet. Everyone loved this and it's not a heavy desert. Used Grand Marnier - awesome! Next time I would use more GM and add more berries.

I also used raspberries and it was great. I decided against the white chocolate because I used a much richer Greek yogurt, and I still think it would have benefited from the extra thickness and flavor. Use the white chocolate. Don't even think about leaving it out. Also, you need to at least double the amount of orange peel to get any citrus to come through in this.

This is a wonderful, light dessert. I have made it for the last five years for St. Patrick's Day and everyone loves it. Light, refreshing, flavorful. I use lowfat yogurt (vanilla) without a problem.

Excellent summer dish; easy, quick, superb flavour - nothing overwhelms anything else. Everyone I have served this to raved about it and wanted the recipe. For best results I use unsprayed or organic berries picked the same day.

very easy to make with fantastic results. It can be freezed and served as icecream (partially melted) accompanied with wafer, mint leaves and orange setz.

This was good. I used strained low fat yogurt instead of regular yogurt. That helped thicken up the mixture. I added 3oz melted white chocolate to the recipe like some of your other reviewers and thought it was a good addition.

This was tasty. I used the white chocolate, which was a good idea. Even with that added richness, it was a bit too much like fancy cool whip. I would suggest this light dessert for a casual occasion after a heavier meal.

A refreshing, elegant and easy dessert. I folded in approx. 3 oz of melted white chocolate and reduced the sugar. It made it a bit firmer and richer -- without the chocolate I found it a little too soft.

A light, but tasty spring dessert that presents beautifully. I reduced the sugar to 4 tbsp, and used low-fat yogurt, and still had rave reviews!

Very elegant dessert. I make it with fresh and/or frozen raspberries instead of the strawberries and serve in chilled martini glasses garnished with mint and whole fresh berries. I serve with wonderful orange biscotti from a local Italian bakery. You won't be disappointed.
