Just made this and it was very good with a minor tweak - Cholula Hot Sauce added to the meat mix! It needed some heat and also added authenticity. We like spicy but it's a matter of taste so add as much or as little as you like. Also used Jack cheese instead of cheddar, served with Pico de Gallo salsa and guacamole. Skipped the sour cream and didn't miss it as it was quite rich already. Definitely a keeper.

Okay peeps! Here is how to make this recipe a 4 forks! I made the meat mixture, tasted it and was like, hmmm. Is this it? Where is the heat? So I took out a teaspoon, and put four drops of Goya Hot Sauce (Salsa Picante) on the spoon and dumped it into the meat mixture. You have to be careful with the Hot Sauce or you can overdo. Four drops was enough! I also only used a teaspoon of lemon juice in the meat mixture. I did not use the corn (kids don't like it), and it wasn't missed. Then I generously spread out the Tortilla chips (I used Sage Valley Yellow Corn organic chips) onto a serving platter. I put a thin layer of cheese over the chips, spooned the meat mixture over the cheese/chips, and put another layer of cheese over the meat. Then I put the platter under the broiler just until the cheese started to melt. Then I topped with the cilantro. (Not 1/2 a cup! Just a little bit on the top!) I gave everyone a fork and spoon and each person used the sour cream as needed. IT WAS WONDERFUL!

A very quick, tasty meal, certainly not gourmet, but when you're wanting a easy meal that will satisfy hungry boys, this is great. I cut the recipe in half (and still had some left) used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of the tomatoe sauce and served over rice instead of chips, topped with mexican blend cheese and sour cream. Yum. Next time I think I'll try with corn bread.

I thought 1/4 cup chili powder seemed like a lot so I reduced it to 1 tsp and added a pinch of cayenne, 1/8 tsp cumin, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp salt, twice as much onion and garlic. Also I used dried black beans that I had cooked. I got rave reviews. Simple, but delicious!

Perfect late night food when you don't want a smoothie, salad or rice cake. Great with beer, too!

Served this for dinner, and we all agreed that it was awesome! We also felt that it could be served as a stand-alone chili. Will definitely make again.

I made this for my family with a few adjustments. I added Rotel Tomatoes (2 small cans) instead of the tomatoe sauce. My family loves it and we've made it several times in the last few weeks. Also, took it to my church dinner and had several ask for the recipe. Love it!

I thought this dish was disgusting, and I made it twice without improvement. Not a keeper.

I usually make this with ground turkey because it is so easy and healthy. I keep it separate from the chips and reheat it a few times throughout the week for tasty leftovers. Garnish with some sour cream, fresh avocado, tomatoes, cheese and its a winner every time.

Yes, this dish was easy to make and yes, it was also very little prep time but there is little else to recommend it. Barely edible.

This mixture is excellent as nachos, soft tacos, and hard shell tacos. Made with high quality ground beef, organic beans, and organic tomato sauce - the recipe becomes exquisite!

Mexican Chili would more accurately describe this dish. And you want to be sure to soak up, drain or rinse the meat before adding the chili powder or this would end up VERY greasy and I used 7% ground beef. But it was a nice cross between taco/burrito filling and a regular chili. I used one can of pinto beans in place of one can of black beans and it was a nice mix. But all that said I'm still not sure if I would make it again or not although it was very easy to put together

This was excellent. Easy to make and very tastey. I did substitute some diced tomato and some salsa for the tomato sauce. It is substantial enough to eat by iself like a chili. I served it with the fajita recipe with peppered beef that I found on this site.
