The lamb part of the recipe was basic and nice enough, but the dipping sauce came out tasting like a candy cane.

we are HUGE lamb fans -- i regularly make lamb chops. based on the other reviews, i decided to make this for a cocktail party. it was very blah. i rarely have leftovers at these parties and these lamb chops were glaringly not eaten -- what a disappointment. ill stick with my old recipe of rosemary, lemon, garlic and red pepper flakes.

Great recipe. Made it for a dinner party as an hors d'oevres and was asked for the recipe by friends who don't even like mint. Very easy to make..

The dipping sauce was phenomenal! And this was very easy to make! I reccomend it highly!

I made the sauce and served it over basic broiled lamb chops. My girlfriend and i loved it. It tastes like an adult alternative to mint jelly. I was afraid it wouldn't make enough sauce, but it's so powerful that you wouldn't want more--of course there are only two of us, so maybe that's not a useful metric.

I hate to be a wet blanket but my husband and I detested the sauce; plain mint jelly would have been tastier. The lamb chop recipe was easy and delicious but next time I would definitely go back to my old Cabernet sauce for dipping.

WOW - so easy and so wonderful! Made this with some roasted brussel sprouts (Barefoot Contessa) and roasted rosemary/garlic new potatoes for a quick weeknight meal. My husband is not a lamb fan but said this was the best lamb he's ever had. A great weeknight meal but also nice for guest especially if you're short on time...a definite keeper.

good heavens - this is lamb and mint sauce, which people in the UK have been enjoying for centuries! Who knew British cuisine could sound so good?!

Made this sauce and grilled lamb loin chops - FABULOUS and EASY. The recipe went home with the guests and the sauce was all gone!

Lamb chops are a weekly feature around here. This easy, fast dipping sauce added a fresh spin to a favorite. I might add a little more mint next time.
