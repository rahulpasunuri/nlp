I madee this exactly as written and was fairly disappointed with the crust as it doesn't really "rise." It did look exactly like the picture in the magazine, which I pulled out to check. What is the point of using yeast? I agree that this is more suited to dessert, as it doesn't at all resemble a coffee cake. I didn't add vanilla or nutmeg since they don't go with lemon. It's either or IMO, not both. As a lemon custardy tart, it was only okay. I have done some research and there should be a more authentic tarte au sucre in one of Anne Willan's cookbooks that has a risen dough. If you Google, there is another entirely different kind of tarte au sucre that is Canadian in origin.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the crust didn't rise a bit, even after baking. It was tasty, but the bottom crust was still moist after baking. I added nutmeg and vanilla, as someone suggested, and the custard had a nice flavor. I'd have to work on this crust recipe, though. Maybe the failure was due to making it in the food processor; I'll try doing it by hand next time.

To die for...and easy to make. Added 1 tsp of vanilla and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to rave reviews. Next time would half the lemon - although the full amount "freshened" the flavour, it was a little too obvious for my liking.

This is terrific. The crust won't look pretty in the springform pan, even after it has "risen", but it looks very pretty when baked. Also, I added vanilla & nutmeg to the cream/egg mixture and served it warm. I ate way too many pieces to put in print. Served it for dessert & everybody loved it.

This is a very simple dessert to make, and it has a lot more flavor than it would seem considering that apart from the crust, there's only egg yolks, cream, and brown sugar. I personally wasn't crazy about the filling but others were ONLY because of the lemon rind which gives the tarte a slightly fruity taste. Also, contrary to the original published recipe, I feel it's far too sweet to be eaten for brunch; it's better suited for dessert. One more tip: this tastes much better after it's had a chance to sit for a day or two.

i grew up in western pa my fanily was belgian as were many others. we bought these pies in our local bakery, may years ago. this is a very good recipe, we called this one sugar pie.stewed apricot and prune fillings on top are very good too. many people put rice custard on them. this was a soft buttery crust.
