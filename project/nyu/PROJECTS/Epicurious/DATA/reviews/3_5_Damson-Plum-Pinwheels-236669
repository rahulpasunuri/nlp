This is an amazing cookie! The flavor is so nice. Such great variation from plain sugar cookies. The only thing negative I would say is that they are very fragile. Fun to shape, they are beautiful!

These are fancy jelly-bowl cookies. They were very pretty, but I thought it was too much effort for this type of cookie.

This is a great cookie. Put the squares of dough on the parchment paper before you start making the pinwheels so you don't have to move them.
