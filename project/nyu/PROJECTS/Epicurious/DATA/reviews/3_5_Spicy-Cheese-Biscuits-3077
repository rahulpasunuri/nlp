I'm always nervous mentioning substitutions because some reviewers get so upset at deviation from the recipe, but here goes: Tripled the cayenne and thought the amount of spice was perfect. Used soy milk/champagne vinegar to replace buttermilk because that's what I had on hand. Used whole wheat flour and added four chopped scallions. End result? I'm pausing between my third and fourth biscuit to write the review. Oh yeah, recipe made 12 large biscuits; if I'd gone with nine they would have been enormous.

This recipe was good but the cayenne flavor was weaker than I would have liked.

These were very tasty -- I was not disappointed. However, maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I think I like regular buttermilk biscuits better. As much as I enjoyed these, I don't think I'd make them again.

Ditto the other reviewers; this is a fab recipe. I also added extra cayenne pepper, but used less cheese as not enough on hand, and they were still wonderful. They also freeze/reheat well. Certainly makes more than 9 biscuits.

Excellent biscuits!!! Very moist with a good kick. Didn't have buttermilk so used vinegar and milk - had to use red wine vinegar since it's what I had - worked out fine.

The only warning that I have about these absolutely delicious biscuits is that they do NOT make 9 - they made 24+ for me, and I had doubled the recipe, so does anyone want to come over for a nice hot biscuit?

My husband & I love these biscuits! I am still trying to figure out in what world this recipe only makes 9 biscuits, but we eat quite a few of them when we make this old favorite. Easy, cheesy goodness!

These are the best biscuits I've ever made, and everyone I've shared them with agrees: even with a little more spice they are incredible. Definitely serve with chili or hot vegetable soup for dipping
