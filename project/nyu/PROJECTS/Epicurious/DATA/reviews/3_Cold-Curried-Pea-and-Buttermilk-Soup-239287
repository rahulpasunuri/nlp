this soup was a great inspiration. i used half shallots and half leeks, all water and no stock, frozen spinach and all olive oil. in place of the curry powder, i used 2 teaspooons dried mint and 1/4 teaspoon dried dill and a pinch of cumin. delicious topped with a drop of creme fraiche. http://fineeats.blogspot.com

This soup is delicious, a nice, refreshing alternative to traditional pea soup. I halved the recipe (since it was just for me), but otherwise followed it as written and it came out very well. The sea salt and pepper crackers that accompanied it in the menu were a very nice addition.
