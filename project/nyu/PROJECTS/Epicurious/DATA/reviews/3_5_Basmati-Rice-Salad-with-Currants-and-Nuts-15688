Discovered this recipe some time 2 years ago and been using it ever since when I want a tasty rice side dish for BBQs or picnics or even when I'm home. Everyone loves it and my vegetarian and health conscious friends love it too! The combination of flavours in it is wonderful and they all come together very nicely. I did the recipe as is, I did not change anything, maybe I added a little bit extra nuts to it ;) Would definitely recommend it to anyone! I always get many compliments when I prepare this dish.

This was delicous! The only changes I made were to toast the nuts before adding them to the salad and I used Tamari soy sauce instead of the regular stuff. It's a great salad and healthy, too!

This is a delicious salad and a real crowd pleaser. Going with what was on hand, I used short-grain brown rice. The flavors really develop overnight as I learned when taking leftovers for lunch. Light, tasty, Delish!

Turned out to be a hit at an end of summer picnic. Made as directed, except with white basmati rice (just overlooked fact that brown was indicated) and to give it a little more pizazz, I splashed a generous portion of sesame oil at the end. Will likely make again, probably with raisins and toasted nuts.

recommended by friend, a great side salad. I used toasted pine nuts instead of pecans and halved the rice. Got rave reviews from my dinner guests.

This was good and healthy. I substituted chives for the green onions and didn't have any celery, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Everyone liked it..kids included. Will definitely make it again. Good fresh flavors.

I'm giving this recipe 3 forks because I made quite a few changes, but it turned out to be a fantastic salad. I used extra parsley, toasted pine nuts and pecans and dried raspberries instead of currents. I also changed the dressing. I left out the cumin and added a splash of rice vinegar and a touch of sugar. I've also made it with cucumber before and that was good too.

I made it with toasted slivered almonds instead of the walnuts for more textural contrast. I also made the rice in a cooker. This was easy and a big hit - I will definitely make it again.

I made this for an office potluck based on the favorable reviews of others on the site and was really pleased with how it turned out. I added raisens instead of currants and reduced the cumin to 2 teaspoons. The best thing I did was toast the nuts in the oven slightly first. Very good!

I've been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it. No need to alter it or make any substitutions -- the recipe is perfect as written. And easy. A great make ahead dish which is particularly well-suited for grilled meats.

This was very delicious. It is something I will make often. No Italian Parsley or currants were available in the boonies so I used dried cranberries and cilantro. Can't imagine it being any better than it was. Next time I will make more of the dressing. Yummy!!!

This is an excellent rice salad. It's great warm or cold (better after a day). I used a blend of wild and brown rices, toasted the nuts, and used raisins instead of currents. Fantastic!

I made this recipe for a camping trip and served it with spicy, Moroccan-style grilled salmon. Only two variations: I substituted white basmati rice and toasted the walnuts and pecans. Delicious--a definite keeper.

I made this one night and served it the next day. It held up well and eveyone thought it was very good. I increased the amount of currants (doubled) and used just under two teaspoons of cumin although I think the full amount of cumin would have been fine. Next time I will hand chop the nuts since mine ended up more ground than chopped. A great company and/or picnic dish.

Great recipe! Substituted dried cranberries for the currants and cannot say enough good things about it. I recommend it.

I really liked this alot. I will try a few of the changes suggested when I make it again. The cumin was very strong and I added more currants but next time I'll toast the nuts, use chicken broth and try garam marsala if I can find it.

i made this for a holiday party and it was a hit, not just with the vegetarians. i toasted the pecans for a nutty flavor and replaced dried cranberries for half the amount of currants. i also had pistachios on hand and added those too! i followed the recipe and it made a ton of rice salad. this one will definitely be added to my standard recipes.

I loved this recipe! Served it w/beef shish kebabs and roasted vegies while camping. (made dressing ahead, & pre-cut everything but parsley; cooked rice on cook stove, chopped parsley and tossed all together) Just a few modifications; most from previous reviewers' suggestions. Roasting the nuts added a lot to the flavor (it also keeps them from getting soft as leftovers). I halved the cumin and thought it was just right, but will try it again w/full amount. Used half dried cranberries, half currants and liked the tartness of cranberries w/cumin flavor (might replace all currants w/cranberries next time). For my crowd, I doubled all ingredients, except rice, which was 1 1/2. Liked the proportions of goodies & dressing to rice. This recipe makes generous proportions, but we thought it was great leftover. Will most definitely make this one again.

This is such a great dish to go with BBQ pork. Thanks to the other reviewers who suggested the spice changes, it was yummy. Did one change, when I cook the rice I used chicken stock and the juice and zest of one lemon. Will definetly keep this on hand for summer grilling. Perfect.

Rave reviews from the neighbors for a quick Wednesday night meal (served with pork tenderloin but we'll be darned if we remember which one, the rice was the star). Used dried cranberries instead of currants, threw in a few chix bouillon cubes with the cooking water.

We all thought this rice recipe was delicious. The only changes I made were to use chicken broth plus water, increase the currants to 3/4 cup, and to substitute Garam Marsala for the cumin. Thanks to previous reviewers!!

This was very good and extremely easy to make. I omitted the walunts, to cut down on the fat a bit. It looked great and the combination of the lemon, tamari soy, cumin and currants delivered a delicious flavor.

Delish! Especially if you are into healthy fare that is flavorful, high fiber, crunchy and colorful! Leftovers stayed tasty even after 1-2 days in the fridge. Definitely will make it again.

I cooked the rice with some chicken broth, added more lemon, some dried apricots, some pine nuts in lieu of the pecan. The dish turned out good but I must say I've had better. For it's simplicity I was impressed by the end result, so I'd definitely make it again. I will enhance further and will be back with results.

I typically say so much more in reviewing recipes on Epicurious but "Delicious!" will suffice for this recipe!

This dish was delicous and received raved reviews. A few adjustments though: I added more rice (about 1-1/2 cups) because I felt the rice was too saturated with the oil and lemon and I microwaved the rice which made it come out a little less stickier. I also added more lemon juice. I agreed with a reviewer about adding more currants too. But all in all, it was an easy dish to prepare and very very good!!

Prepared this recipe exactly as instructed. Started the meal with a spinach, feta, bacon, and date salad. Served medium-rare grilled charmoula lamb chops on top of a bed of this rice, and sauteed fennel and carrots. This recipe lended itself well to the lamb chops. The spicy lamb with the sweet crubchy rice was excellent. I served the rice at room temperature underneath a fresh off the grill pair of lamb chops. The only adjustment to the rice would be to add more currants. I would double the amount of currant to 1 cup. This was a very great meal that our guests could not stop raving about. The presentation of the meal was excellent. We served the meal with a nice Chardonnay.

Fantastic. We used white basmati rice since we didn't have any brown but it was still great. It was perfect with grilled chicken and veggies.

Rating: 3
Easy to make. Nice combination of tastes and textures. The nuts are particularly good in this. I had to microwave the rice since my cooktop was broken. It cooked beautifully in the microwave...I zapped it for 15 minutes, stirred the rice and zapped it 15 minutes more. Perfect.

The hint below about adding garam marsala (and we used Graham Kerr's recipe) and rice vinegar and toasting the nuts was what made this dish for us. We've made it at least a dozen times since 10/99 and it's a winner every time.

Yum, yum, yum! Just don't expect anything that colorful or pretty.

As usual, I made some substitutions. I used 1 cup of walnuts, instead of the walnut/pecan mix. Red onion for green onion, tamari for soy sauce. I found the sauce a little overwhelming and to the leftovers added some white basmati rice - this was amazing and I received rave reviews on the 'adjusted' dish. I will make it again with half white half brown rice (which makes it quite attractive) and a little less dressing. Enjoy!

Amazing combination of flavors and textures. The spice and tartness of the vinaigrette and sweetness of the currants are a fantastic mix. Easy yet complex and attractive rice salad.

I love this salad at Mothers and have wanted the recipe forever! Yay! I am planning to serve this with a citrus-stuffed turkey for Easter; a little something different.

I've made this dish several times, always with very good results. As celery and pecans are hard to find here, I have had to omit them, but it is still a great rice salad, very refreshing.

This is a great summer dish. Very different than your normal summer salad. Surve this with coconut barbecued ribs. Your guests will love it! The flavour is what you are looking for and these coconut ribs are the trick! With the basmati rice, be sure to cook it on the dry side.

Loaded with flavor, but I did make changes. Cooked rice in chicken broth, placing 2 frozen, boneless, skinless chicken breasts on top to cook. Will be finished when rice is done. Also replace currants w/diced dried apricots and added one 16 oz can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained. Next time I'll replace 1 tbsp olive oil w/1 tbsp walnut oil. cooking rice,

I used to live in Newport Beach, CA & absolutely love & miss Mothers Market & Kitchen. It's the locals (& not so local) health food store & all vegitarian kitchen. All of their food is wonderful & balanced for the vegan diet. I loved this recipe!!! They make wonderful organic salads & a dressing made with ground cashews/ tomatoes (& more) that I will have to share with you too. 40 forks up!

Forget the cumin. Make it with garam Marsala [1/2 to 1 tsp] or a sweet curry and add a bit of rice vinagar. Be sure to toast the nuts before adding them. It was great when made this way.

Very good, goes well with other spicy dishes and would be excellent on a picnic or lunch buffet. Nice blend of spices and crunch.

Looked like it had potential, but thought the cumin looked like a lot for this recipe so I cut it down to 1 1/2 tsps. Cumin still over powered the other ingredients.
