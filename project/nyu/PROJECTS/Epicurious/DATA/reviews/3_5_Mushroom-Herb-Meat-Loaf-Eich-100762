delicious and easy. Even my mushroom hating son had seconds. Followed reviewers advice and added an egg.

This is a very good meatloaf recipe. I only used about 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper; next time I might use more. I also used store- bought breadcrumbs. I added an egg,1 tsp. Worchestershire and 2 more cloves of garlic. After an hour in the hour, my meatloaf was 145 degrees and it rose another 10 degrees outside of the oven. Tasted great.

So AMAZING! I'm not a very experienced cook, and have never had meatloaf in my life, my boyfriend loves it so I wanted to find a recipe that made the meat have flavors that I knew I would like. I was SO simple, and SO tasty, he didn't even need Ketchup, which says a lot! I left out the ceyenne pepper, cause I can't handle spicy foods, and it tasted great!

I meant a thinly sliced pancetta.

Amazing!! I'm not a big fan of bell peppers,so I nixed them and added more mushroooms. I also added a little more garlic and alot more cayenne.(we love spicy.) It definately was not over powering. Instead of bacon I did thinly sliced procetto,which I think cut back on the grease. The recipe makes alot, but we are alredy counting down until we can eat the leftovers!

I made this meatloaf and I actually FOLLOWED THE RECIPE. I didn't use turkey, or thyme, or anything else in THE RECIPE but I did add an egg. It was delicious... the best loaf I've ever made. Highly recommended. Still scratching my head over users who comment on a dish when they don't even follow THE RECIPE!

It sounds good, I am going to try. But Jeesh! San Mateo, sounds like you made an entirely different recipe! Turkey Thyme Loaf...... YUK!

This turned out quite well--moist and flavorful. Even my husband, who can be pretty picky when it comes to food, said it was a keeper. I actually made several changes, since I was missing ingredients. Plus, I wanted to make the dish healthier. I left out the red pepper, the parsley, and the bacon. Instead of the basil and cayenne, I just used thyme. And for the meat, I only used ground turkey. I also added in an egg, as suggested by others. Despite all my changes, it turned out quite well and I plan to make it again.

Outstanding. Add a mushroom gravy, au gratin potatoes and peas with perl onions in goose fat and you have a meal people will absolutely love.

Great recipe. Hubby doesn't usually say much on meatloaf night, but this one he liked. I'd definitely make it again! Only changes I made were to halve it, use Maverick beef and add an egg.

I've tried several recipes for Meat loaf and am usually not that thrilled with the results. My family loves this recipe. It has become the cheap staple meal in an otherwise more gourmetish household. Have not tried any substitutions but I am generous with the red pepper and onions.

Very good with a few substitutions. I used 1/3 lbs each of ground beef, ground pork and sage sauage (Jimmy Dean's has a good version). Also added an egg and replaced the basil and cayenne with thyme and sage. Very flavorful and not at all dry! I served the meat load with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and the recipe for mushroom gravy found on this site. All of it excellent comfort food for a chilly October night!

I like trying new meatloaf recipes and have found some great ones but this isn't one of them. We didn't like it all...very dry and bland. Definately not a keeper for me.

The meatloaf turned out phenomenally and I would definitely make it again, but did anyone else have a problem with grease? I had about a cup and half of fat in the pan when it was done baking and I used only 90% lean beef. Still, it was the best meatloaf I've ever had.

In the words of my husband "this meatloaf rocks!!!" Needless to say, it is absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe, and it still came out great. This will be our standard from now on. And so very easy to prepare.

The best meatloaf ever. I thought I had found the one when I made Frugal Gourmet's meatloaf that has italian sausage in it, but this one takes the cake. It is really beyond compare.

Unbelievable, it was the best I have ever tasted. I have been searching for a meatloaf recipe for a long time and this one is it !

The best meat loaf we ever had. To reduce fat, coated the top with cracked pepper and also added white pepper to the loaf. Excellent cold the next day.

Loved all of the vegetables and spices mixed in with the meat - it made for a very flavourful dish. I added an egg as I found it too dry without to bind properly. Make sure your use an 8X4 dish, as I only had a 9X5 and the loaf was quite wide and not that high.

Best meatloaf I have ever had. Exremely easy to put together. Everyone loved it. I added extra cracked black pepper to the outside before I covered it with the bacon strips. Perfect.
