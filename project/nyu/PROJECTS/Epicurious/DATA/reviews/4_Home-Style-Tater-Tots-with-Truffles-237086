This recipe is a bit time consuming so plan ahead. However, it is worth the effort. When it comes to nutrition...it's best not to think about it (as with many recipes that are potatoes, butter and eggs). Just savor the moment.

I made these tater tots about a year ago and they were a HUGE hit. The time commitment is worth it. I actually made a double batch and kept the tots frozen for several months to cook up for brunch as needed. The key seems to be that the tots need to be completely frozen when you deep fry them. Like others, I also agree that truffles are unnecessary, as the flavor comes from the oil. I am making this recipe again this weekend to use up my CSA potato bounty!

I made these for a cocktail party (tripled the recipe for 40 guests and had more than enough). These were a huge hit and so many people asked for the recipe. I would definitely make these again, though I agree with the other review that the truffles are not necessary - it is the truffle oil that flavors them and I would not waste my time or money again on the truffles. We had some left over and reheated them in the oven the next day at 375 for about 10 minutes and they were good as well - but these are not a make ahead of time food - they are best when made and served imediately.

I made these tater tots to serve as a side dish for prime rib and everyone gobbled them up...no left overs. I am getting ready to make them again to take to a pot luck so not sure how they will hold up. I had some Oregon white truffles that I used in addition to the truffle oil. Waste of truffles as you couldn't really taste them. In the future I will use only truffle oil. I also used only olive oil for deep frying.
