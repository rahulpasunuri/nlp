Made this for the first this evening, and it was absolutely delicious. Everyone of my guests, including those who typically do not like lamb raved! I did slightly adjust the sauce, I added a bit of orange juice and a little bit of sugar, which worked very well.

The marinade was good, but the whole berbere paste crust fell off the lamb when it was cut. The biggest problem I found with this recipe is that 25 minutes doesn't get you a medium-rare chop at all. You need at least a good 35-40 minutes, so take that and the 5-minutes resting period into account when planning your dinner. Guests still loved it, but I didn't find the recipe particularly original.
