Exceptional and delicious. It made for a spectacular finale for the Easter meal. Mised strawberries and blueberries.

Excellent dessert. However, I thought that 3 eggs whiles was not enough for 8 people, so I doubled the amount to six. I came out to be an excellent size with four individual meringue on the side which were also exceptional. Since I am not a big fan of cream, I did not double the amount of the lemon curd and I thought it was a great ratio between the meringue and the filling with most emphasis to meringue and berries. The dessert was a hit. Will make it again many more times.

I did not make this recipe, but based on the comments, I think others might be interested in the Orange-Flower Pavlovas, also on this website--instructions for individual pavlovas with less sugar.

Wow, I loved this recipe! I made one big pavlova the first time. It tasted great but it was a little messy to cut up. The next time I made it I piped the meringue using a medium round tube. I got about 9 nests the size of a drinking glass mouth. This was a much better way of serving this. Some people complained about the lemon curd. I mixed it with unsweetened whip cream as mentioned in the recipe. This brought out the tartness of the lemons and cut the sweetness of the sugar. I'm making some small pavlovas and I'm putting them on a tiered serving platter to be used as a wedding cake. Should look and taste fantastic!!

Really lovely. I made this because I had too many lemons and too many blueberries on hand (such a hardship). It was hugely popular at work (true, they'll eat most free food with relish and abandon but this one seemed special). I really appreciated the fact that this recipe doesn't leave me with left over egg - 3 egg whites for the meringue and 3 egg yolks for the lemon curd.

This is a recipe that is incredible to die for. I made it when it was first published and it is a request from my family every christmass or holiday. very easy to make and everyone who tastes it can't stop eating it.

My entire extended family loves this recipe. Too sweet? Nahh. It's wonderful and disappears all too quickly. For entertaining other than family, make individual pies to keep them neat and tidy while serving. Sorry, can't remember how many pies I got from this...maybe I'll take note next time.

I made this dessert for a dinner party on a hot summer night. It was a HUGE hit! So light and refreshing with vibrant flavor. I followed the directions exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing. The pavlova in the picture looks more refined than mine did. This is definitely something I will make again.

I reduced the sugar as suggested, and we all still had sugar buzzes. It was painfully sweet. I'd say the curd needs to be more of a light lemon cream with minimal sugar to coordinate with the sweet pavlova and berries.

Rating: 3
I give this recipe 3 forks as written, because as written the lemon curd is a little two sweet. With the sugar in the curd cut to a 1/2 cup, this is a 4-fork recipe. Really good! And, easy to make. My pavlova cracked something horrible when I opened the oven, but I patched it together with the filling and it still tasted fantastic!

This was beautiful when assembled, but I even cut the sugar as recommended by other reviewers and it was still so sweet we all had sugar buzz headaches afterwards.

Absolutely excellent in every way. I cut the sugar in the lemon curd to 1/2 cup, and that was sufficient. Huge "wow" factor at a foodie dinner party.

Insanely good! I've made this a few times now - twice as is and once in individual-sized portions so each person had one perfect pavlova on their plate. When I made individual it worked great since we were assigned dessert for our supper club and it traveled well to plate up after dinner. If you make the recipe as is, I just found it got a bit messy in serving, but still it's a light, delightful, special dessert.

I guess I must not be a meringue lover. Though I have a sweet tooth, I found this over the top sweet. First few bites were good but none of us could finish our plates and I threw away leftovers.

I've made this several times since it first appeared in the magazine and love it! It's great as is, but I do have one shortcut. Buy a good lemon curd and combine with homemade whipped cream. Tastes just as good to me, and cuts your time over the stove.

Pavlova is my new favorite dessert! Great recipe! I put strawberry, kiwi, blackberry, and raspberry on top. My meringue tends to get a little chewy on the bottom, but that is my own fault. Any tips?

This recipe is basically great. Cut back on the sugar a bit in the filling to eliminate a bit too much sweetness. I made individual meringues for a cocktail party and people loved them.

Exceptional. My first time making meringue. It dropped in the middle while baking but I just filled it with lemon curd and berries and my guests didn't know or didn't care. They were very impressed. Looks and tastes wonderful. Well worth the effort.

Wonderful and fairly light in spite of the sugar. Adding water to the egg whites was a leap of faith but the recipe worked out perfectly. Doubled lemon curd but not whipped cream, also reduced sugar to 1 cup for the doubled curd recipe. Impressive presentation; making again for another birthday.

this was great. Used slightly less sugar in the curd than the recipe calls for which made it a nicer contrast to the sweet pavlova. This was my first time making this dessert and I enjoyed it.

Rating: 3
despite the fact this was delicious, the time and relative difficulty make me take off a fork (I don't love laboring in the kitchen in the summer!). To be fair though, it was my first time making a meringue this size. It whipped up beautifully, but then fell as soon as I propped the door, as directed. I made another recipe that was similar from a blog, called for a slightly lower, longer baking time, then turn off the heat and keep the door SHUT. I even left it in the (off) oven overnight, and it was perfect. Minus the meringue, the rest of it is great. Curd was easy, uses up your yolks, and delicious. I used seasonal nectarines, red currants and raspberries-- it was beautiful.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe! I'm usually not into the enormous rating inflation on Epicurious (4 forks is supposed to mean it changed your life, 3 is still great!), but this dessert was truly special and deserved four forks. I also recommend reducing the sugar in the curd if you are sensitive to overly sweet things. It was simple, but you have to be around your house for a few hours to make it. It is a perfect summer dessert. I will definitely be making this again!

Rating: 4
Wow. This was good. Took the advice and reduced the sugar in the curd to 1/2 cup. The pavlova is very sweet on it's own, the curd is very tart on it's own, but once it comes together with the whipped cream and berries... my goodness! It's a keeper! I'm looking foward to varying the curd with different citrus, etc. Lots of options here for creativity.

Rating: 4
Took advice to double lemon curd and reduce the sugar..perfect. I used blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. I think I should of added more whipped cream to curd as mine wsa a bit thick. Not difficult but time consuming; make as much ahead that you can. This was devoured by all...perfect for Spring

Rating: 4
I'll start off by getting to the point; this was absolutely delicious! I substituted limes for lemons because of personal preference and the smaller citrus added a different dimension to the recipe. IMHO, the incisive taste of limes offers a more marked contrast to the earthy sweetness of the blueberries than lemons do. Those of you who have a truly authentic sweet tooth will probably want to let the recipe remain as is, but I personally found it a little cloying. In future, I'll decrease the amount of sugar to disrupt the saccharine assault and to alleviate a little of the guilt I have for eating this. Overall, though, it's hard to find any fault with this recipe, especially when faced with the brutal evidence of an empty pan that only minutes earlier was the resting place of 2 pavlovas. Kudos to the poster!

This was a great recipe but I agree with those who said that the lemon curd might be a bit too sweet. Next time I will definitely cut down on the sugar. Otherwise, very tasty, even the morning after. Someone had it for breakfast with more fruit and loved it.

Lemon curd was excellent, but the pavlova was too sweet for my taste - would cut the sugar in the future.

I made this for a party where I was asked to bring dessert. It was around 4th of July and the dessert set off fireworks! Making this dessert was just as fun as eating it. After preparing my own lemon curd, I don't know why I would buy it from the store. I did see however Williams and Sonoma does carry a lemon curd and I would trust theirs. Low if not none on the "fillers" that I don't like in my foods. Delicious!

I made the pavlova using this recipe for the meringue and the recipe for lemon curd from Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook (my "go to" lemon curd recipe). I put blackberries, blueberries, sliced peaches and quartered fresh figs on it. It was amazing!! The sourness of the curd paired with the sweetness of the meringue was unbeatable. It was even good (tho soggier) the next day...

I just made this and my meringue is cooling in the oven. Sadly it has fallen, it looked so beautiful until the cool down time and now there is a large crater. My first thought is that elevation has stuck again (I live at about 7500 feet). Does anyone out there have any ideas for how to tweak this dessert for high altitude? I am still excited about trying it, just kind of bummed that it will be flat-ish instead of nice and puffy!

Rating: 2
Isn't 300F way too high for meringues? I've always done them much lower and longer so that they dry out and get crispy. These (I made individual ones) turned 'golden' in no time. I thought the idea was for meringues to be super white. Plus they were really chewy in the middle but not in a nice way...you'd get a hard chewy ball of sugar stuck in your teeth. I ended up putting them back in the oven on low for a while longer. I added some lemon zest to the meringue mix and it tasted great. Next time I think I will make this with different recipes for the components. I also thought there was too little curd. But for what it's worth, the photo is GORGEOUS.

This may be the best recipe for pavlova I've come across. The shells turned out beautifully ever time I made them, and the lemon curd got rave reviews from my guests. If it seems too sweet, add a little extra cream and cut back on the sugar slightly. A little extra lemon juice never hurts, either.

Although my meringue had a lot of air and eventually broke this was delicious and beautiful anyway. I did not use this curd recipe but it was still very good!

My lemon curd was also runny so I continued stirring on a low heat for another 10minutes to let it thicken. It was much too sweet so added 1 cup of ricotta cheese. This cut the sweetness, the acidity and allowed it to firm up in the refrigerator. It also increased the amount of filling. Before assembly I added the 1/4cup of whipped cream. It got rave reviews from all guests.

Rating: 4
I would double the curd amount too. Not enough in ratio to the berries and meringue. But fun recipe!

Rating: 3
Made this as written. I do have to agree with other reviewers--the lemon curd was a little sweeter than I prefer, but only by a touch. I made the curd and meringue the night before. The curd turned out very thick and sticky. This made it difficult to gently fold the whipped cream into it. The cream also really lightened the color of the curd from a stunning sunny yellow to a pastel buttercream. I also didn't seem to have quite enough curd to cover the bottom of the meringue, which admittedly ran a little on the large side. Tips for next time: make the meringue smaller or double the curd, or layer the curd and cream skipping the mixing of the two. Oh yeah, it tastes FANTASTIC!

Rating: 4
Amazing results! Took it to a garden party and everyone loved it. It's very light and summery. A splendid recipe. If in a rush, I would use a quality lemon curd from a jar next time. The recipe's lemon curd was very watery - maybe I did something wrong or my eggs were too large. I can't wait to make the pavlova for the family.

Forget the blueberries - Add pineapple! Absolutely delicious!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Don't be intimated by the merinque. I followed the instructions as written and got great results: crispy on the outside, soft and pleasantly chewy on the inside. Truly lovely! The best feature of the meringue recipe is that I made the meringue shell the night before and simply let it sit at room temperature until the next day. It kept just fine. So you can make the trickiest part ahead and confirm that it turned out well before you proceed. Again, nothing really difficult about the meringue if you have a good quality stand mixer this is as "easy as pie." The lemon curd has just the right level of sweetness and a very nice consistency. If you can find flavorful fresh blueberries this is a show stopper. People will think this is much harder than it is. This is great for entertaining because you can make the meringue(s) the night before and make the lemon curd a day or two before and just assemble right before serving. Believe me you will get "oohs and aahs."

A very pretty dessert. The meringue and the lemon curd turned out well but I was left with an egg aftertaste. Perhaps I did something wrong. I think I may only do the meringue part again.

I am about to make this recipe for the second time. I only use the meringue part, making 4 separate 'nests' to put together simple individual pavlovas made with whatever soft berries we have in the house, vanilla icecream and whipped cream. Delicious and much better than the bought meringue nests you can buy in the supermarket here in London.

i made this recipe and followed it exactly. the meringue was delicious, but the lemon curd was FAR too sweet! it gave me and my guests an instant stomachache! i used regular granulated sugar instead of superfine, but that isn't supposed to make a difference. the whipping cream seems to be part of the recipe to cut down the sweetness, but it really doesn't do the trick. i would consider seriously cutting down the sugar from the custard!

Delicious! After lusting after this online for weeks, imagine my delight to discover my daughter made this for me for my birthday! (without knowing I'd been eyeing it) The curd is perfect--and its tartness counters the meringue perfectly. Blueberries & lemon are a match made in heaven! I have been making Pavolvas with cream, strawberries, etc. for many years. THis is a delightful variation, and I will be making it again!

Wonderful! Before I made this recipe, I read the reviews and felt like I should do a different lemon curd - DON'T! The lemon curd was amazing. I added raspberries and blueberries on top with some mint sprigs as well. It got rave reviews. Perfect for summer.

Easy and delicious. Beautiful for the brief and shining moment before you cut it, especially when you follow the food stylist's picture and use only blue berries (blackberries and blueberries) against the yellow of the curd. As suggested, I used a different lemon curd recipe because, yes, corn starch in a curd recipe is weird. I wondered about the odd specificity of "white distilled vinegar," and used white wine vinegar with no discernible ill effect.

This is a really fun recipe. It is sweet so you must add the cream to the lemon curd. I did also make 4 individual for easier servings. Cooked for 5 mins less.

Tastes just as good as it looks! And easy to make. This is a keeper. Light and not overly sweet due to the wonderful lemon curd cut with a the whipped cream. No need for whipped cream on the side. Liked the idea of making indiviual servings. How long should the individual meringues cook?

For the Meringue I made 8 individual Pavlovas. I put the meringue into a zip lock bag, cut off the tip, and onto parchment paper I made circles- higher at the ridge, piped some into the center and smoothed it out with a spoon. I used a different recipe for the lemon curd (on Epicurious "Meyer Lemon Curd"). I used fresh rasberries and blueberries. My guests really loved this!! Very Good!

Great and easy to make. There is one mistake on the online version. It should be 1/3 cup lemon juice for the lemon curd - not 1/3 lemon juice.

Made this in April in individual servings, but used a curd recipe from another source. I froze the left over meringues. For a dinner party in May, I re-crisped the left over meringues at 275 degrees and then crumbled them onto a large platter, put dollops of the curd and whipped cream on top and gave everyone a spoon to eat off the communal platter! Again, it was a show stopper!

Made this for a dinner party last night. I did follow the recipe -- against my better judgement -- for the curd, but didn't use it. Can someone tell me why you put cornstarch in curd? I think it tastes awful. So I made regular lemon curd (did not lighten it with whip cream) and used strawberries, blackberries and blueberries on top. It looked great and everyone ate their share. Meringue is too sweet for me, but the lemon cuts it and the presentation is great.

It was wonderful. Made it for Easter and used strawberries and blackberries. The directions may seem a little strange at first, but they work. Make the seven inch circle, and think about it like a disk. Then just push up the sides, not outward to make the crater for the fruit and lemon curd.

Phenomenal!!! Made this for Easter and it was delicious. I made the Pavlova and the curd the night before and refrigerated both separately. I assembled everything shortly before serving and it was perfect. I used blueberries, blackberries and raspberries and it was really pretty... The Pavlova really holds up well, I thought it might get mushy too quick and it did NOT! Honestly it doesn't even need the whipped cream.

This recipe was so much more delicious than I had even expected. My friends are still talking about it! I didn't have cornstarch in the house, so I used some arrowroot instead, to no noticeable detriment. My own creation, I have to admit, was not nearly as beautiful as the picture you see here, but hopefully practice will make perfect, because I will definitely make this dessert again.

Very good and extremely pretty - all guests served themselves *generous* seconds. I'm used to sweetening whipped cream, but the unsweetened version in the recipe is the way to go - the pavlova is sweet enough all by itself.

I made this for dinner guests who were delighted. I made about an 8" fairly high circle of meringue. The thick meringue crust was perfectly moist within and dry outside. The lemon curd was very lemony and not so rich as many recipes. I added a bit of sugar to the berries before putting them on top. Looked just like the picture and tasted wonderful.

Rating: 2
It looked so good I had to make it, but the instructions are odd. For one thing, the meringue made a way bigger circle than 7 inches. There weren't any instructions on the berries either. And I made the lemon curd from another, really easy Epicurious recipe. I should have made more than one shell with so much meringue so I ended up breaking it up and serving it with the lemon mix (which was good) and some fresh sliced strawberries on top. It tasted really good, but still a weird recipe. I would make something similar again but not this exact one.
