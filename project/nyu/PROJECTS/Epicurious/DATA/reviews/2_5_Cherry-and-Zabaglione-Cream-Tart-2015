This was easy to make and good, but not delicious. I ended up putting down the layer of zabaglione first, and then placing the cherries on top because the cream filling was too thick to do otherwise.

Easy to prepare and was absolutely wonderful!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed, as were my guests. The flavors were good, but they just didn't mesh well together. I think this could be fantastik with fresh peaches instead of cherries.

I don't eat sweets, but it received great comments at a recent party and it was quick and easy to prepare.
