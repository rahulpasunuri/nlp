This was a disappointing recipe, a waste of ingredients in my opinion. There is no way the yield is 60 cookies, I got maybe 30. I would also say they had no sweetness. I added dried cherries, but they couldn't save the dish. Always look the the reviews.

I just completed the dipping & drizzling process- not good! The flavour is bland. The texture a bit like stale rye bread. 1-Do add a pinch of salt. 2-Do add 1/2 cup addt'l sugar 3-do add 1/4 cup adt'l flour And the number one missing ingredient: BUTTER. I was so excited for a lighter biscotti. DON'T DO IT! If you want light, have some celery. If you want a DE-lightful italian cookie w/a crunch AND a bountiful, robust flavour, add the salt and butter. Also, toast the pistachioes first. They're not as rich in flavour as other nuts used for baking. It'll bring out their sweetness,

This is my second time trying my hand at biscotti; and I must say, this recipe is easier and quicker than the first one. Although... As one reviewer said, it does lack something. It called for far less flour than other recipes which promised to turn out an equal number of biscotti. I used four lemons, added an additional 14 cup of sugar and (because I'd run out of pistachioes), 1/4 cup of hazelnuts, and I still only got about 42 biscotti. The lack of butter makes them healthier, but also creates a gummier texture. To finish them off with more flavour and zing, I dipped one end in a lemon/confectioners sugar glaze and the other in dark chocolate. I rated them 3 forks, but only because I improvised. Next attempt: I'll use another recipe & substitute the ingredients with those from this one!

This recipe needs to have a lemon icing drizzled on top after cooling. I also added sprinkles for a final touch. These additions gave it the taste of lemons and sweetness that the biscotti was lacking.

If anyone has a perfect lemon biscotti recipe, let me know... I've been wasting a lot of lemons in my kitchen lately in pursuit of one, & this recipe is now part of the legacy. These cookies taste like flour and lemon. Per past suggestions, I added more lemon zest. I should have added more sugar to compensate, but even if sweeter, I still think something would be lacking. The consistency & appearance, at least, is lovely.

I made these cookies along with some cinnamon orange biscotti and they went well together. I think the "flat" aspect many reviewers complain about is a lack of salt in the recipe. I put a pinch of sea salt in and it helped. Next time I'd probably use table salt but I had the sea salt in front of me at the time. I also used more zest and juice than the recipe called for and I think it helped because I wouldn't want the cookies any less "lemony" than they are. As far as I'm concerned, the cookies were well balanced. Bakers probably shouldn't expect them to be too sweet-traditional biscotti aren't. Overall, it's a nice little cookie.

This biscotti recipe is mediocre at best. I made it last year and didn't like it, but I gave it another shot this year because I thought it sounded so good. Not so. The dough was gooey and hard to handle. The biscotti cooks and cuts nicely (it especially looks pretty before the second baking). However, it really doesn't taste anything but bland. And it doesn't have that awesome crunch that you want from a biscotti. It just seems dried out. My advice: just avoid the recipe. Biscotti is way too time consuming to make a bad cookie!

I have made these a number of times, and they are easy to make and always turn out well. If you like your biscotti hard and not too sweet, then this is a great recipe. I agree that adding a bit more lemon zest and juice gives them an added zing. Also, I accidently once made them with salted pistachios, and they still turned out fine.

My first try at biscotti. Was better than any I ever had. Easy too. Now I'm the biscotti king.

I agree with previous reviewers that the lemon flavor was not quite enough. When I make them again, I'll definitely add more juice or zest. Though not my favorite biscotti recipe, I thought they were good enough to make again. I liked that they weren't too sweet.

I have made biscotti before and this recipe is one of my favorites. I added extra lemon juice and zest and found the end result fantastic. It had a great lemony flavor, and I loved the pistachios. This is a great recipe.

I've made biscotti many times, always with great results. These were very disappointing; not the correct texture and flat in flavor, despite the wonderful ingredients. Since I was making them for company I felt I had to rescue them so I drizzled them with Lindt white chocolate. Would definately use another recipe next time.

I have made biscotti at Christmas for the last four years and have tried several recipes. Although this recipe is good it is not my favorite. I added extra lemon juice and zest as one reviewer suggested, but even though there is a strong lemon flavor, it somehow seems "flat." However the consistency is very easy to work with and the finished product is pretty.

I have made biscotti before and they were just great. It was another recipe. However, this recipe is really bad. There is absolutely no flavor at all - very flat tasting - and the recipe made a very moist dough. Also, the biscotti did not turn out with exactly the same texture as they should be, i.e. pretty crisp and dry. They are OK to finish off with my tea. But will not make this recipe again.

I thought it was a great recipe. I used extra lemon zest, which really added to the flavor. Salted pistachios worked for the recipe just as well!

I don't quite understand the lukewarm reviews. This was my first shot at making biscotti and I thought they were wonderful. I used all the juice as well as the zest from the lemons (out of laziness), and added some white chocolate chips. Tasty stuff!

The biscotti where fantastic. I made them and brought them to work and now everyone at work is making them. They are very easy to make and store. It is very easy to alter the ingredients to make a different kind of biscotti.

I found the dough extremely difficult to work with. It was barely firm enough to maintain a "log" shape. The taste was rather bland - not sweet or lemon enough. Definitely not worth the extra drive to find unsalted pistachios. On the plus side, they did look pretty.

Very easy - and especially tasty. They freeze well too/

Instead of the modest amount of zest, I used about 1/2 c. of candied orange peel. The citrus flavor was nicely pronounced and the cookies were flecked with orange and green. The flavors were even better the next day. Will try candied lemon peel next time.

I made this recipe twice. Once at Christmas and again yesterday. I don't think I'm going to make them again. While they do look nice they need something. I even grated an extra lemon ( 3 small). I drizzled white chocolate over the biscotti after cooking. It helped the taste and certainly looked great. While I would love to find a lemon biscotti recipe - this is not it.

Despite loving lemon and pistachios, this was a big disapointment. I had no problems working with them, and they certainly weren't too hard (almost not hard enough for true biscotti), but just lacking in any real flavor punch. I see that others have increased the lemon, but I don't think this recipe is worth retrying.

Added a bit more lemon zest for extra flavour, and reduced baking times a little so they weren't quite as hard. A lovely biscotti, I'll make them again!!

While pretty, rather bland and not very lemony. Also came out very hard--even for biscotti!

absolutely fabulous...pretty to look at...easy to make and DELICIOUS! The smell alone is wonderful! I sprinkled some sugar on the top of the logs before baking for added sweetness and a sparkly top!

Great flavour, perfect mix of lemon and pistachios.
