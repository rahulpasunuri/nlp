Just a great combination of varying textures and flavors. I heeded the warnings about the richness - I used half semi-sweet half milk chocolate and I think it provided the right balance. I increased cream/sugar in the top layer by 50% and I'm glad I did. Oh, and this cake was ridiculously easy as well.

I prefer Bon Appetit's Mocha Custard Tart over this dessert, both of which give the same flavors and creamy texture. This was good though, but so rich that I couldn't imagine making it with bittersweet chocolate (I used semi-sweet). This will appeal to people who love flourless chocolate cakes, but not to milk-chocolate fans.

Wow this is good. Not too tough to make, looks very professional at the table (my family was sure I had bought it at our local gourmet store), and tastes incredible. Can't wait to make it again.

the crust was delicious. however, the filling contained too much bittersweet chocolate for my taste, it overwhelmed the coffee flavor. the topping had a good flavor but the gelatin affected the consistency. if i were to make again, i would double the recipe for the topping (except for the gelatin) and decrease the amount of bittersweet chocolate maybe subbing a semi sweet or dark chocolate instead.

Delicious and very rich! The crust tended to stick to the bottom of the pan. I recommend using parchment paper.

A fabulous-tasting, impressive dessert that wowed the crowd, and was easy to make, especially for the result it produced. I used 2/3 bittersweet, 1/3 semisweet chocolates (plus the imported amount), doubled the whipped cream topping, and quickly grated some semi-sweet chocolate over the topping. I'll definitely make this again!

Very good...fairly simple to make. I always let tortes, and cheesecakes, cool at room temperature before refrigerating...I think it makes them creamier. I don't know if it made a difference, but this was wonderful, and served 16 people!

Ok--it's not even funny how delicious this torte is... I made it for a dinner party and HOLY COW I've never seen so many people slobber and gush over a dessert. Of course it should have been good--I spent serious $ on a premium blend of bittersweet and semisweet chocolate, and it was worth every penny.

A fantastic dessert. A little complicated because of all the steps, but a great result. The day after I made this dessert, I brought an Imperial Torte I had been given as a gift over to a brunch party. Many of my dinner guests from the night before were there and swore that the Chocolate Cream Espresso Torte was better than the (outrageously expensive) Imperial Torte.

Fabulous dessert -- in my all-time top 10! Love the hazelnut, chocolate and espresso combination. I made extra whipped cream topping (actually doubled the topping recipe). *Make sure the cake is completely cooled before adding topping.* Highly recommend this recipe.

This dessert is an absolute must for chocolate lovers! The hazelnut crust has just enough flavor and texture to enhance and not detract from the cake. The filling reminded me of chocolate cream pie but denser and richer and the addition of espresso in the whipped cream made for a heavenly finish. One of the easiest and most decadent desserts I've made this summer. The only change I made was in the garnish...didn't feel like shaving chocolate so I sprinkled the topping with MINI chocolate morsels. Yum!!! I can't say enough about this cake -- I'm making it again this weekend.
