A-mazing!! What a wonderful summer meal. I drizzled it over thin slices of porterhouse. The meat was succulent, and this dressing added to the juiciness of it all. We had NO leftovers. I used anchovy paste instead of fillets, and I omitted the red pepper (kids). Vinigrette looks oily, but you have got to try it at least once this summer, trust me you won't regret it.
