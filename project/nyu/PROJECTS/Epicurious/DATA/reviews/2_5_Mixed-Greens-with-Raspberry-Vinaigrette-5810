Nice dressing, but use less shallots.

I made this but had to throw it out. Too many shallots overpowered the dressing. Next time, I will cut the shallots by at least half. Also may add a clove of garlic and some fresh berries to smooth it out.

The vinaigrette was way too tangy.... even after I pureed raspberries and added sugar. I would not make this again.

Great dressing. I had a similar one at The Claim Jumper. They added candied walnuts, sliced asian pear and fresh raspberries. Excellent.

Great salad. I added goat cheese, fresh raspberries and carmelized pecans.

My husband and guests loved the dressing. I would cut back on the shallots, I am not an onion lover.

I liked the dressing but in general found the salad to be bland. It needs 'doctoring' up. Maybe add onions, tomatoes...

I used this dressing on another salad I like alot and it's wonderful. Changes made: add tarragon to the dressing. Salad: over spinach, feta, chopped green apples, and topped with walnuts. Yum!
