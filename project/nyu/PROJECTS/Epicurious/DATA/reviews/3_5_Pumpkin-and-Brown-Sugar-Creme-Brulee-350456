So delicious. The trick is finding the right sugar to get the caramelized top--don't substitute regular sugar, it doesn't brown as well. Makes the perfect Fall dessert

I doubled the spices and added ginger and it came out awesome! SO easy and delicious.

2 1/2 forks. Tasty but not exceptional. As other reviewers stated, this is more like a custard than a traditional creme brulee. It would make a terrific filling for a sweet crust. Not exactly a show stopper but its so easy to make I find it hard to complain too loudly. :)

Absolutely delicious! Much more elegant than your standard pumpkin pie, and the spice combination was unique and flavorful.

Smooth and delicious! I made this for Thanksgiving instead of the usual pumpkin pie. I strained the custard before pouring it into ramekins (as other reviewers found the texture rather grainy), but I think that extra step was unnecessary. I cooked the strained-out portion and it was smooth and tasty too!

A lot like pumpkin pie without the crust, but a smoother texture. A great alternative to pumpkin pie.

I omitted the cloves (I often find cloves too overpowering in a recipe) and thought this was wonderful. It doesn't even need to be "brulee'd" to be tasty. Well covered in the fridge, this kept for a few days. A perfect, non-baking dessert for a dinner gathering.

I thought this was good, not great. The pumpkin overpowers the custard too much. It tasted just like pumpkin pie filling with the creme brulee topping. I guess I expected something richer. When I make creme brulee again, I'll stick with the original version where the cream really shines.

This is an instant classic! Do not be afraid of the spices and amounts as they give this dessert the perfect kick. For an elegant dessert trio, I baked these in sake cups (the perfect individual size) and served with cinnamon ice cream and chocolate bourbon pecan pie.

My husband actually made this! We prepared two days before thanksgiving, and "torched" it just before serving. The reviews were all glowing. My sister, who is a creme brulee expert, declared it the "best ever" and wants it every year!

This is so easy and fast! I threw it together in a few minutes, amazing. Only change was that I added an extra egg yolk. I didn't expect it to have creme brulee texture so was not disappointed at all. It is like a super creamy filling. Fabulous taste, fun presentation.

This turned out beautifuly, and was a unique spin on pumpkin pie. It added an elegant touch to Thanksgiving. I followed other reader's suggestions to strain before putting into rammekins and the texture was very smooth and creamy.

I made this recipe for a group of confirmed "foodies" with experience in the restaurant and catering world. It received great reviews, but with one important change-- substituting regular refined (white) sugar for the demerara sugar topping. With that change, it merits four forks. Having said that, you should know that this recipe produces a flavor and texture similar to a very creamy pumpkin pie filling, and is not creme brulee-smooth in texture. Someone with a background in food science could likely explain this better than I, but the demerara is a bit slow to melt and becomes somewhat bitter when you torch it. On the other hand, refined white sugar gives you the crunchy, caramelly flavor you expect with a creme brulee. I prepared eight ramekins--four with demerara and four with refined white sugar--and the unanimous verdict among eight serious gourmets was that white sugar produced a better tasting dessert. Also, based on one of the earlier reviews, I cut the cardamom in half (1/8 tsp.). One of my test subjects opined, without knowing the recipe or that I had modified it, that the dessert would benefit from more cardamom. So, when I make this for Thanksgiving, I'll go back to the full 1/4 tsp. called for in the recipe.

I think that you have to put the forks in to get your "review" to take so I suggest that you rate it the same as before you started.

Another way is to give it the rating that existed when made your comment.

I was skeptical that with all the pumpkin puree, the consistency would not be true to the standard creme brulee. I solved this problem by straining the mixture through a wire mesh strainer after whisking in the hot cream and before pouring into the ramekins. While not quite every pumpkin bit made it through the strainer, I had enough for 10 1/2 cup ramekins and the consistency was great. After caramelizing the sugar, I did find the filling softer than a stove-top creme brulee, but the flavor was excellent. I used heaping measures of all spices and ground my own cardamom. Definitely strain this recipe if you are looking for a creme-brulee consistency!

Dear Jamboree, Please do your fellow cooks a favor and do NOT "fork" recipes that you haven't made; your "review" has nothing to do with this recipe! Thanks.

I am sorry I have not made this recipe but for those that are intereseted in a fool proof and delicious Thanksgiving treat...sample the maple syrup pot de cremes (on epicurious) ...to die for! I add the pie crust crunch with a tasty and delicious candied ginger shortbread cookie. My guest are instructed to use it as a dipping spoon for the pumpkin goodness. They have literally licked the bowl clean! nuff said!

Basically "pumpkin pie filling" flavor and consistency. The texture under the carmelized top was not true creme brulee, though it was tasty.

To the previous reviewer, the key phrase in the sugar is "raw." Don't try regular brown sugar. Creme brulee is best when topped with turbinado or demerera, although regular white works well in an emergency.

Unlike the reviewer above, I found the cardamom much too strong as it overwhelmed the rest of the flavors. If I do this one again, I would put in just a tiny pinch of the stuff and add about 1/4 t of nutmeg and some more cinnamon. This custard is only tolerable with a very thick, strong carmelized top to balance it out. I also had trouble getting brown sugar to work with a creme-brulee torch (the stuff caught fire before it melted) and opted for white, granulated sugar for the other 7 ramekins. One might have better luck with a broiler. As the recipe is, I'm not sure it is worth all the trouble. I'm a little disappointed.

Absolutely yummy, wonderful blend of spices (as long as you like cardamom, which I do) - the perfect dessert for a chilly fall day - but since it uses canned pumpkin, I'll be making this year-round!
