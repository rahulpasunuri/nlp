Excellent recipe, the syrup really gives the cake a nice citrusy flavor that is delicious. Didn't have time to make it too much in advance but that worked just fine. Served some syrup on the side for those who wanted to add some. Didn't have enough butter so subbed 100g of apple sauce for 100g of butter. Worked just fine. Definitely a keeper

Followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit with the family. Very fast to pull together.

This cake was exceptionally good. I added twice the lemon zest called for as I am a lemon lover, and it was fantastic. I was careful not to overbeat. Also, I did not slice the top, nor did I cover half-way through baking and it was not over-browned by any stretch. The brushing with lemon syrup should be mandatory, it softens the crust and gives it a kick. Thank you for posting this! Easy and fun with my Kitchenaid. :)

Easy and delicious pound cake recipe. I recommend mixing liquid and dry ingredients separately at first and then combining them in batches later on. For smoother, fluffier texture mix the liquid ingredients until doubled in volume. Also I added about 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the cake batter for extra flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again

Good but a bit dry. I even weighed all of the ingredients and baked the cake for 55 minutes which is the low end of the time called for. Next time I would check it at 45 minutes. The cake is not dense as a pound cake.

this recipe totally rocks. i used a bundt pan, for lack of a loaf pan, and it came out divine. watch the cooking time.

This was the strangest cake that I ever made. The flavor was good, but it was very dense and dry. Even the batter was a bit too thick before it went in the oven. It definitely needs icing, but I would recommend finding another recipe. Not worth the trouble of making it from scratch!

Really nice cake with a rich flavour, even without the poppy seeds and lemon. My family loved it and it was gone in a flash.

A very nice cake. I made it as a lighter option to a flourless chocolate cake for a family buffet and it was very well recieved. Sadly, I could not find any poppy seeds so had to omit, but I thought it was very good nonethless. I made a simple icing of 2 tbs icing sugar and lemon juice, which think I will double or triple next time. Also, I lined the whole tin with baking parchment which made for an attractive presentation. I'm looking forward to making it again.

A great recipe if you need a small cake - my 8 inch tube pan was the perfect size. Despite the overly complicated directions, this is an easy recipe. I measured the ingredients without weighing them. The cake had a wonderful flavor and a lovely texture.

This is good. I don't think you need to pay attention to all those over-dramatic instructions (I'd feel silly using parchment in a loaf pan), it's just a pound cake. I like this mixing method from The Cake Bible, but it's a pain if you want to make a cake on the spur of the moment and don't have softened butter (you can soften it in the microwave but it's tricky). I used the zest of two Meyer lemons and slightly less sugar, a greased and floured disposable 8-inch loaf pan, measured and didn't weigh the ingredients, and it worked fine. You may well need to cover it (I used a Pammed piece of foil), as it gets pretty brown. It's not as dense as more traditional pound cakes, but it's yummy and gets better as it ages a bit. If you can deal with all the ponderous, self-important directions, there's a perfectly nice recipe in there.

Good pound cake but definitely needs some icing or something, its pretty dry. I made icing for it, SOOOO good. The icing is easy: 3 cups powdered sugar, 1.5 teaspoons light corn syrup, 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice. Whisk the 3 ingredients together and pour it over the entire cake, HUGE hit.

I agree with a previous reviewer's comment that this was more like a tea cake than a pound cake. It was not exactly what I expected, but it was delicious. I made the recipe exactly as written. This would make a good gift.

After trying 4 different receipes for a birthday cake, I finally found the perfect cake! I left out the poppy seeds and lemon zest (used lemon extract) b/c I was aiming for a traditonal yellow birthday cake that did not require more than 3 eggs. I baked it in an 8 inch round,PERFECT! Very yummy with buttercream vamilla icing.

I've been making this cake since I got the "Cake Bible" about 12 years ago. It is one of the best lemon cakes ever and everyone always loves it. The lemon syrup adds a nice tang and moistness to the cake, and the fact that it can be made in advance is a definite bonus! Always weigh the dry ingredients - much more precise than measuring.

Stunning. I made two modifications... used 4 small eggs instead of 3 large, and substituted raw fair trade sugar (whizzed in a moulinex) for the susperfine white sugar specified in the recipe. Absolutely magnificent... I won't ever make a different lemon pound cake again... there's no point, as it could never compare with this one!

Fabulous!!! The instructions couldn't have been clearer and the cake was moist and flavorful. I followed the suggestion of making in mini bindt pans - great idea - they were so cute - my guests loved them.

Fantastic recipe. Like everything else in The Cake Bible, it is perfect. Simple to make, incredibly moist and tasty. I do like the idea of using "european butter", and plan to use handmade Irish butter next time.

The only substition I made was to use regular flour instead of cake flour. This was really, truly amazing! I served it with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice-cream and everyone raved about it. I will certainly be making this one again and again.

I've been making this cake since I got my copy of "The Cake Bible" 15 years ago; it's one of my favorite offerings. The only change I've ever made is to switch to "european style" butter - I highly recommend it. I also make it in mini bundt pans a lot - the little cakes look beautiful. Everyone loves it - the flavor is superb and the texture is outstanding. The cake part is meltingly tender offset by the crunch of the poppyseeds. Follow the direction exactly and it comes out perfect every time!

I was initially intimidated by the recipe, which reads as if it is a difficult endeavor. I forged ahead anyway and followed the directions exactly. I was really dissatisfied with the results. This tastes much more like a tea bread, not a pound cake. Not dense enough for me (as a pound cake should be) and light on flavor. Rather blah. Too much work for the product. I'm still searching for an excellent lemon poppy cake.

Wonderful! I made this for a party and the cake was gone in about 10 minutes. I received plenty of compliments; I'll definitely make this again! I wouldn't change a thing!

I have been making this recipe since it appeared in the Cake Bible in 1988. It is the quintessential pound cake. It is rich, not too sweet and very lemony. I will be making this for years to come.

This cake is wonderful and the cleverest part is the introduction of a new mixing technique--combining dry ingredients first, then adding liquids and mixing properly to develop the small amount of gluten in cake flour. If you just weigh everything--especially cake flour--it eliminates all that measuring and sifting and makes life much simpler. I've tried the same technique on large wedding cake recipes and have had wonderful results as well as cut my work time in half. Rose's cookbooks are detailed and because she is a scientist and an artist, her instructions illuminate the why's of doing everything. Thank you Rose!

This is the worst lemon poppy seed cake I have ever made.The lemon flavor was cloying,the cake was too firm and I had to throw it out .There are many better versions of this cake.

Very nice, I've also turned this into vanilla pound cake by leaving out the lemon/poppy seeds and adding vanilla seeds/sugar and adding a little bourbon to the sugar sruyp.

For all the finickyness of making this cake (ingredients @ room temp, greasing the pan, lining it w/ parchment paper and regreasing, etc) it wasn't worth it. Mine came out very dry and the lemon syrup overpowered the buttery flavory of a pound cake. I've made easier with better results

ooo I thought this was very yummy. Mine came out nice and light..not dense at all. Wondering if the previous reviewer overbeat or used the wrong flour. Granted this is a very lemony flavor but I found it not overpowering. All and all a new favorite of mine. I baked in 3 mini loaf pans for about 35-40 minutes.

It seems I am in the minority but I didn't care for this cake at all. Too dense and flavor is actually TOO intense. May have done something wrong in preparing but I tried to follow all instructions.

I've made this recipe over and over and its fabulous. One year I gave them for Xmas. I've even made them in individual bundtlette pans, served them with ms. berebaums raspberry sauce, fresh fruit and some whipped cream. Easiest glamourous dessert ever. I must comment on the reviewer who substituted the butter, and eliminated the zest, the poppy seeds, and reduced the sugar in the syrup. I think you missed the point. And a small piece of something fabulous is better than a large piece of something mediocre. If you have dietary issues, you should really consult a specialty cookbook.

Lovely recipe- lemony and moist. I added a bit more lemon zest and juice to this recipe, and balanced the acidity by serving with thick cream. Was very well received!

This was a good recipe: easy and detailed. I made a lot of modifications, though, but is still worked great. (1) I substituted the butter with 8 tbls applesause, 6 tbls oil, (2) no poppy seeds or zest, (3) oranges instead of lemon in the syrup, w/ only 2 tbls sugar, and (4) regular flour & sugar. A few tips: I didn't cover w/ foil, and it got overbrowned, and don't let the syrup stand too long or it'll turn into candy.

Tasty and nice looking cake. The lemon can be substituted with orange - in this case take less sugar for syrup. Another variation is to make two smaller cakes and put one on top of another and the orange/lemon bechamel between them.

I've made this, from The Cake Bible, and think it's fab. We like more poppy seeds than called for, but that's a small alteration.

Easy to make and absolutely divine. I used all-purpose flour and regular sugar to save money and it came out perfect. I will be making this often.
