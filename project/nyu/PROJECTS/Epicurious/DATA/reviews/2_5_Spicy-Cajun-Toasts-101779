I agree with the other reviewers--way too much salt.

OK. Sorry- how does this qualify as a "recipe"? It's bread, butter, and "cajun spices" that I assume you're supposed to graboff the store shelf. I do variations on this for several meals a month and wouldn't have the audacity to post it here and call it a recipe. I expected at least to see a spice list so I could make my own Cajun Spices. WAIT- I have a recipe: go to the store, buy a premade chicken, heat in the oven for 10 minutes, and you have a chicken dinner!

I would cut the salt down by half, or even less. Let it brown that touch more You could serve it as an apperetive, or, with barbequed sausages, steaks, and (chicken with the same cajun marinade).... dont forget the green leafy salads The only problem is one tends to eat more toast than meat....so be sure you make lots of it....!! Yes....I would certainly make it again.

This recipe was excellent with using half of the salt asked for. I will use it over and over.

This recipe was easy and it tasted ok, but I would probably try something new rather than make it again.

Good if toasted quite brown. However, the amount of salt could be decreased to 1/4 teaspoon, or eliminated altogether if the cajun spice seasoning is on the salty side. These are very good with tomato juice cocktails or with a tart lemonade.
