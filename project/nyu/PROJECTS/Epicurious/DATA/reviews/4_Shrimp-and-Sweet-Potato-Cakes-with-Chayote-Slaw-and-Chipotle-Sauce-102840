Delicious and healthy! I recently had something similar to this at a restaurant but this recipe definitely superior. Wrote about the comparison of the two versions of sweet potato cake on my blog, Spoons to Sporks.

Delicious. You can subtitute picked jalepenos if you can't find the poblano.I didn't make the salad but just served it on a bed of butter lettuce. Couldn't get enough of it! If you have a coffee/spice grinder, it'll make creating the spice mix much easier. See link for some lessons learned regarding the recipe http://cinnybear.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/sweet-potato-shrimp-cakes/

I would like to make these for a picnic, and was wondering if anyone has eaten these cold, and if they were good or not? maybe on a toasted baguette as a sandwich? I don't usually make fish cakes so I can't really imagine if they would taste good chilled. Thanks for any help!

Forget the slaw - not impressive, but the shrimp cakes with chipotle sauce are divine. I make them early in the day and refrigerate and cook at the last minute. Plate with a spring salad mix tossed with a vinaigrette...perfect first course for a dinner party. The entire menu is wonderful - try the pork loin with this...one of my favorite dinner party menus

This is a great recipe .... it would be a shame to omit the poblano, with its subtle smokey spicey flavor. We also think it's a shame to only serve it for company. We have it from time to time just for a tasty light supper for just the two of us. Mary in Eugene.

This recipe was intriguing. I used Japanese sweet potatoes, and did not bother with the poblano chili. At first, I was worried whether they would hold together or not, but no problem, they were delicious. We paired them with a salad, and a bottle of rose for a nice summer evening meal.

This was so good and easy and different.

Holy smokes, this was outrageously good. We were melting with pleasure over this appetizer and had only tried it because it called for chayote, which we had never used. Can't wait to have people over as an excuse to make it again.

These were good, but not great. The chipotle mayo offsets the sweetness of the potato nicley tho. I prefer the Shrimp Cakes with Chile Lime Cream Sauce on this website. Those are super!

I made the shrimp cakes and chipotle sauce as an appetizer for Thanksgiving day and everyone loved them. I would definitely make them again! Because there were many people in the kitchen trying to prepare food simultaneously, I didn't have the time or facilities I would have had at home. I roasted the garlic a day ahead, microwaved the sweet potatoes (which I'm sure didn't make a difference in texture), chopped several things using a food processor, and prepared this in what was probably record time, but they were delicious!! People used the leftover tartar sauce as a dip with leftover crackers. Both have interesting combinations of flavors that work extremely well together!!

I have made this recipe many times; yes - it is somewhat labor-intensive, but the wow factor is very high. Some notes - after adding the panko bread crumbs the cake should form easy in the hand. If it is still sticky, add a little bit more panko. I've included this dish in a southeast asia inspired meal; in that case I used samboleek instead of chipotle in the tartar sauce. Also, after frying these you can warm them on your grill (off center) instead of the oven.

My family raved! It was so labor intensive, that I was glad it was worth it. My brother thought the chipotle sauce overpowered the cake and should not be dolloped on top, but set on the side so you can taste the cake by itself, as it is yummy. The slaw was great tasting too. I think the best way to handle the dish is to make the spices, the slaw and the sauce on one day and the rest the next. It was worth the effort; unusual, sweet, crunchy, spicy, wow.

I noticed in the photo that the shrimp and sweet potato cakes had a perfect form, and so used a squat pineapple can (both ends removed) to press the shrimp mixture into. As a bonus, the pineapple tidbits mixed with a diced ripe avocado and a squeeze of lime juice made a tasty and healthy salsa as an alternative to the chipotle mayo (which I made but found too heavy for the delicate cakes). I also added a bit (1 TBS) of diced sun dried tomato to this mix, just for color. Red pepper might work better if you like that vegetable. We skipped the slaw and had steamed baby green beans. Great meal!

Excellent shrimp/sweet potato cakes; will definitely be a regular dish at our house. To speed up the process I microwaved the sweet potatoes, takes about 6 minutes (be sure to pierce with a fork a few times so they don't explode). A few shakes of Caribbean hot sauce took the place of the poblanos. Somehow I didn't notice that the shrimp was supposed to be precooked, so I baked a bit longer in the oven, about 10-15 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly, minus the slaw, and WOW... delish! They probably dont even need to be fried, just heated in the oven, but of course, everything tastes better when it's fried ; ) I thought that maybe the amount of cilantro was a bit much but it was perfect. The sweetness of the potato was a perfect mixture. If you want to impress and make a big splash, try this one as a starter.

Based on other reviewers, I increased the amount of shrimp to 10oz, which was plenty for the cakes. Instead of going to the trouble of making the spice mix, I used bottled Cajun seasoning, which worked wonderfully. I also substituted 1/3c sun-dried tomatoes for the chilli, to cut down on unnecessary heat while still adding colour. Guests all raved!

Unbelievble! So good. Don't weigh the shrimp. It's about 2 cups. And forget the Chayote. It's not worth the trouble. But these cakes are great with the chipotle tartar sauce and latin spice mix

My 17-yr old son made this for a party of 16 yesterday and it was a total hit! The best appetizer on the table! It disappeared in no time! I love the blend of flavors!

a delicious base recipe -- worth expanding/enhancing. i added red peppers, corn, lime juice and zest. nice inexpensive alternative to crab cakes.

I used the idea that someone posted, to make this sort of Asian - I added some sesame oil, soy, garlic, ginger, and chopped scallion then served it alongside the japanese-style quick pickled slaw, as seen on this website. It was really good. Maybe reserve some of the panko, or use extra, for dredging prior to frying for a little crunch.

We thought these cakes were a little too much work for not too much wow. They weren't gross or anything, but they weren't anything special in our opinion either, and we wouldn't bother making them again. It seemed that the cakes had such weak flavor that without the chipotle tartar sauce they would have tasted like little more than spicy mashed sweet potatoes.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous! I added fresh minced ginger to the cakes. This recipe would be great with an Asian twist too: five-spice powder instead of the latin blend, Asian vegetable "slaw" instead of the chayote one. Very impressed, I will offer it to my clients (personal chef).

This is one of the finest buffet receipes you can do. do the slaw, it adds the right touch, also, the latin spice mix goes great as a rub for pork or chicken on the pit at a later date. this is one of the best, greatest receipes I have ever tried on this site. the other best would be the gingerbread with ginger sauce, great with this as dessert.

This was so good! I did not make the slaw however. The cakes and chipotle sauce were restaurant quality, I was so proud of myself! Served with a mixed green salad on the side for a light dinner. Make this one and you will not be disappointed!

The Shrimp and Sweet Potato Cakes and the Chipotle Sauce were wonderful and we'll definitely make them again, but we thought the slaw didn't contribute much and wouldn't bother with it next time.

The slaw, the cakes, and the chipotle tartar sauce make for a well-rounded and superbly yummy combination! I'd had this dish on my list for ages and finally got around to making it today -- and it was worth the wait. This is ideal as an appetizer but two cakes apiece served two as an informal warm summer evening meal. Ended up with only five cakes; may have made them a little large. I may add more roasted garlic next time and will probably revert to my oven roasting method for the bell peppers (30 minutes at 450), which I find easier and more efficient, although the pasilla chars well over an open flame. I was not accustomed to using chayote so I checked my trusty Rick Bayless cookbook and learned that I needed to peel it and remove the soft pit from the core. Textures and flavors are quite complementary. Delish!

This is fabulous and is great leftover as well as fresh. Only change I'd make is to chop the shrimp smaller and/or add more so that every bite has shrimp in it.

I've made this several times. Since chayote is not sold in this here town, I skip the coleslaw and just do the patties. For a quick sauce to serve with it, I mix salsa with mayonnaise to a consistency similar to Russian dressing. We love it.

This has become an instant favorite, and has gotten rave reviews at a recent dinner party. Not a simple recipe to make, but so worth the trouble. Serve the shrimp cakes with a`pork roast, rubbed with the latin seasoning mix.

Loved it. Made it twice this week already. First for my family and then for company. Popular with everyone.

This is an amazing recipe. I've made it several times and everyone loves them. I make the cakes a few hours in advance and refrigerate covered. Fry them just before the guests arrive and keep in a warm oven until you're ready to serve them. Try the whole latin menu that goes with this recipe - it's out of this world. (Bon Appetit Jan 2000)

This dish is incredible! I used a brown rice bread crumb so my cakes didn't hold together as well as they might have, but the taste was still unparalleled. The tartar sauce is just as wonderful. I passed on the slaw. I will make this again and again.

I was looking for a way to use leftover shrimp cocktail from a party. Boy did I get lucky. Did not make the slaw, substituted much in spices with what I had on hand. I also used same chilies in dish and tarter. My dinner guests raved, can't wait to make it again

I had never made anything like this recipe, so I had no idea how it was going to come out. I was extreamly happy with the results and so were my guests. I would make this again and again. Just make sure you have plenty of prep time as it has many steps. But, it is easy to do and well worth the effort.

Yummy! I brought the sweet potato cakes with the chipotle tartar sauce to a dinner party for the first course and it was 2 thumbs up from everyone! The sauce would be great on fish also, lots of flavor.

Our dinner party of 10 loved it. The Chipotle Sauce was spicy but was a nice contrast to the Chaote Slaw. It would make a nice light lunch and I will make it again.

what a wonderful recipe! very good and different from the typical crab cakes. the chipotle tarter sauce the best, i make it all the time and use it in place of regular tarter!

Wow!!! What a surprise! You need to try this! I was in a pinch for an extra appetizer when I heard at the last minute I would have 4 extra guests for a dinner party -- I had no poblamos or panko, so I used what I had. I used canned green chile peppers with some freshly ground chili powder and freshly ground bread crumbs from a honey grain bread. Had to nuke the potatoes and use garlic powder because of time - Also, I did the whole cooking under the broiler - skip the flour if you do that - This was the star of the show, and the first thing to disappear!! You don't need tartar sauce or anything, it's absolutely amazing! It's quite rich - I'd recommend it as a main entree for a romantic dinner with salad and wine! I will try it with the poblamos and panko, but don't be afraid to substitute, this is a very unusual and delicious!(I also didn't make the slaw or sauce - I'm just reviewing the cakes)

This was absolutely wonderful. I did not make the slaw, but the chipotle tarter sauce was perfect. I have already made these a couple of times, each time getting great acolades.
