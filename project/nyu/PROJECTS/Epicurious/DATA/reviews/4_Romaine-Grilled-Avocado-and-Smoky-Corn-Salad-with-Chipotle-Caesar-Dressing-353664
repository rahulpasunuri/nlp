Great recipe if you make a few modifications. I made the dressing as directed and wasn't overly impressed, so I put it in the blender and made to taste (I ended up adding more lime juice, parmesan, chipotle chiles, garlic and salt). The end result was amazing and creamy and tossed nicely with the romaine. I grilled the avocado & corn on a cast iron skillet as suggested by a previous reviewer. I didn't have fresh corn, so I used frozen and added chopped red onion and jalapenos. Added raw red onion and shrimp sauteed with garlic and diced chipotle chiles since the salad was served on it's own. Can't wait to try this during the summer so that I can grill the corn and avocado.

Really enjoyed this, except for the avocado, which was just as blah grilled as it is not. We're not avocado fans, but were hopeful that grilling would give it a boost. Next time, we'll skip the avocado entirely and add black beans as suggested by an earlier reviewer.

Love this fresh summer salad. I made as directed and my dinner guests raved about it. The romaine was nice and crispy and the dressing was smokey and flavorful. I added the chile to taste and you can use more than you think as it is diluted somewhat in the dressing. I will definitely make this one again.

Ok-- Love the idea for the salad-- BUT, it's bland and not worth the effort unless you make a couple of tweaks. First, the avocado. I found grilling it (as above) kind of a waste but I love the idea of that. So this time, instead of brushing with olive oil, salt and pepper, I dipped the open side of split avocado in prepped dressing and cooked face down til browned in skillet. TOTALLY GOOD. Also, you really have to use at least twice the chipotle called for to taste it. Don't worry, with this much lettuce and the other ingredients, it's enough to give it taste but not really too much of a bite. Don't overdo on the olive oil or underdo on the lime. And get your corn good and roasted and throw in some extra. Simple tweaks made a world of difference. :)

Sorry I just reviewed the wrong recipe... excited about trying new grilled romaine recipes and forgot where I was..

I loved this recipe - my first grilling lettuce experience. The pickled onion/blue cheese dressing tasted amazing together. I used 1 large red onion that weight about a pound and found it was way more than we needed, I'd do about half a medium one next time.

I think the chefs who aren't impressed by the grilled avocado may be too gentle in the grilling. I don't have a grill, so I put a cast iron skillet on high heat and seared the unpeeled avocado halves until they were completely black. That gave them that carbon-y complexity when diced up.

This is one of my favorite salads. I never grill the avocado. In the winter I use Green Giant Mexicorn, grill the romaine and add some toasted pine nuts. In the summer I grill the corn and sometimes also the romaine. Next time I am going to add some black beans and mango and it will be dinner. I love this sooo much!

This was delicious. I cut the recipe in half and my husband and I ate it for a side salad with fresh salmon burgers. The smokiness and heat from the chipolte and jalapeno and the tangy lime juice made a perfect combination. I know I will make it again and again.

I just did the grilled avocado to serve on or with a burger and it was nothing. Avocado needs a boost of some sort & just grilling it was no more interesting than just plain unadorned avocado. It went on the burger ok, but no better than without the grilling.

Delicious salad, though I took some of the other reviewers' advice with the dressing and lessened the peppers to 1.5 tsp. and lime to 3 T. I added about a half tsp. of the adobo sauce to the dressing which added smoky flavor without making it too spicy. Didn't grill avocados BUT did grill the romaine - rub with oil and just quickly char it. Delicious! Added tomatoes and slivered red onion. With these changes, a definite keeper.

Love love love this recipe! Made it for a dinner party and all 12 guests raved about it. It was a bit spicy so adjust accordinging to your tastes. I am making again this weekend for another dinner party...yum! :-)

Recipe was okay, not great. The grilled corn was a nice addition to the salad. The dressing was interesting but agree with others that the lime and chipotle were overpowering. Added a little over a teaspoon of light brown sugar to cut the lime/chipotle bite.

I didn't find this recipe terribly special. You couldn't discern any "grilled" or "smokey" flavor from the avocado or corn. The dressing was OK but nothind special. It tasted a little too strongly of lime and I couldn't really taste the chipotle chiles. Too much effort for something that ultimately tasted pretty pedestrian.

This salad was amazing! I doubled the recipe and made it for a dinner party last night. Everyone raved about how it was 'like a salad you get at a restaurant'. The dressing was so good and complimented everything so well. Not sure that grilling the avocados did much for it. DELICIOUS nonetheless! Could be a great main dish with a few shrimp or some chicken on top. I will definitely make this one again!

I used maybe three tbsps of the minced chipolte in adobe and it was way too hot for my guests. So go easy on the peppers and enjoy.

Great light summer dinner. We added rinsed and drained black beans which I highly recommend. My husband can't have lactose so I substituted a hard pecorino romano sheep's cheese for the parm. For dinner I would say you can get 3 serving out of this (w/ the black beans) - not 4 adult servings. Maybe I didn't use enough lettuce though and the avocados were small. The avocados turned out like they did int he picture. Mine tasted funny but I think it was the avocado and not the grilling. My husband was thrilled with his. I took the leftover olive oil on the plate from the corn and placed two pieces of sourdough in it face first. I grilled lightly and placed them like a giant crouton on top.

Delicious topped with marinated chicken breast as well! I disagree with other reviewers in that I thought grilling the avocado brought out a unique flavor/texture that I hadn't experienced in an avocado before.

Quick, easy, crowd pleaser! I omitted the chipotle chiles as I was serving this at a 4th of July BBQ with lots of kids. Probably won't add them next time -- didn't think it was missing anything.

Delicious, with one stipulation: a full tablespoon of chipotle pepper overwhelmed the rest of the flavors in the dressing. I'll halve it from now on for more subtle smoke and spice, and to let the lime and garlic through.

I made this for my book club last week and they were all asking for the recipe. I tossed the salad very lightly and served the rest of the dressing on the side. A also doubled the corn. Yum! And while the avocados may or may not taste any different from the grill, I think the grill lines make it different, and you're at the grill for the corn anyway. My new summer salad!

We really enjoyed this salad. I did grill the avocado but it made absolutey NO difference taste-wise so I will skip that step in the future.

Liked this a lot. The grilling made the avocado very buttery which I liked, but I'm not sure it was necessary. I added some cilantro which worked well.

This was awesome. Followed the recipe exactly as written, but took reviewers' suggestions and did not grill the avocado. Adobo chiles provided just the right amount of heat and added a nice smokey kick! Served the dressing on the side so guests could pour as little or as much as they liked. Freeze leftover chipotle chiles in air tight container.

This was pretty yummy. Loved the variation on the caesar dressing. I liked the grilled avocado - I thought the grilling did something kind of neat to the texture. Would probably be good ungrilled, too. I like the other person's suggestion of adding cherry tomatoes. Would be good a good addition. I was also thinking to heft it up a little maybe add some cooked black beans or a chicken breast. Ooh, or cornbread croutons! I feel like this is a good recipe because it's good on its own, but could easily be varied in easy ways and still be good.

I agree. Skip grilling the avocados. Otherwise it was yummy. Some fresh cilantro works as well.

Added cherry tomatoes. I'm not sure that grilling the avocado added much; I would add it raw next time. Definitely grill the corn.
