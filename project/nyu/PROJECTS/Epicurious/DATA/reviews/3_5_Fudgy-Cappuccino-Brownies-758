well it turn out to be pretty good. As mentioned I made the adjustments with cinnamon & some extra coffee. Nutmeg's flavour could be avoided if some one is not that into spices, but the texture was really good and so was the taste.

Everyone loved these. The spices make the difference, not the espresso. I even prepared the dry mix and put it into jars for Christmas gifts. Yum.

These were actually very good, but more cakey than i like. My favorites EVER are the Fudgy Toffee Brownies on this site.

This is a great recipe that balances the wonderful rich chocolate with intense espresso powder. However, I would caution people to let the brownies cool in the pan as opposed to taking them out to cool on the wire rack.

Do not hesitate to make these!! My family thought they were great, even my eight year old son who does not like coffee anything. In response to the other comments, I'm not sure I understand Cranston's comments. The recipe states "fudgy," these are not supposed to rise to a cake-like texture, so I wouldn't suggest adding baking powder. As for the cooking time, I thought it was right on. Mine came out slightly crusty on the outside and just right on the inside, i.e. perfect. And, if the thought of "spicy" brownies sounds unappetizing, lighten up on the cinnamon and nutmeg, but don't eliminate them. They add an interesting complexity to the final product.

These were very good but I added 1 tsp baking powder. How do they rise without it? The eggs in the recipe weren't beaten enough to incorporate air into the batter.

Great brownies! I prepared them as written, and thought the spices were just right, but yes, they did take a few minutes less to bake.

Whenever I make these for a gathering, they get rave reviews, with requests to make them again

These were great, but I made some adjustments to the recipe that I think made a difference. Based on a previous review, I decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. and eliminated the nutmeg altogether (nutmeg in brownies does not sound good to me!!) Also, I decreased the baking time by about 8 minutes - if I would have cooked them for the recommended time, they would definitely have been too dry. Also, the brownies were very thin. Next time, I think I will prepare in a 9 x 9 pan instead, and increase the baking time slightly to account for the thicker brownies... YUM!

These were nasty. Way too heavy on the cinnamon and not chocolatey enough. I had never made a bad brownie until now. Avoid this recipe!

This was one of the most successful brownie recipes I have ever made. I substituted the vanilla with Kahlua and used both white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips.I made them for a party and everyone wanted the recipe!!
