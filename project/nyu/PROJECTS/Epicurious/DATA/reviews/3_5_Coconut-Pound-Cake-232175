Delicious-though I threw away my bunt pan in disgust, as the cakes never pop out cleanly. This is moist, and I drizzle it with a melted white chocolate coconut and coconut. Will try in a lamb mold for Easter.

Wondeful and easy. Follow the recipe as provided, ignore all the"advice". This cake is moist and rich with coconut flavor. I did not find it "too" sweet, it is a pound cake, not a bread.

This is an excellent recipe to follow true to the original. I've made it countless times over the past couple of years and it is a favorite. I continue to receive compliments and requests for this pound cake.

Wonderful snacking cake. As directed by other reviewers, add a few dollops of sour cream (I increased the recipe by half so I could make another small loaf, and added a scant 1/2 cup sour cream to the whole batch). Skip the toasting of the coconut, and don't bother with the extract unless you just happen to have it. The real trick is that this cake tastes better the next day, or even the day after. I baked mine four days ago and the piece I just ate was fantastic. Seems like it keeps improving, and doesn't dry out or become gummy the way most cakes do.

I followed the recipe with the revisions (suggested in reviews) of a 1/4 cup less sugar, 3 T. sour cream, and 1/2 C. lite coconut milk. When it had cooled, I covered it in a chocolate shell, thinking it would be like a Mounds bar for my son's birthday. We all ate it (and have been picking at it), and it was definitely moist, but my 8-year old aptly likened it to "coconut corn bread." Perhaps it was the reduced sugar, but this was definitely reminiscent of corn bread and, therefore, not an optimal birthday cake situation. This might be a perfect dessert for a ladies' lunch. Not so kid friendly.

I modified this recipe by exchanging a 1/2c turbanado sugar instead of white and added 1T fresh ginger and 1c dried cranberries. I also added 2T half and half to add moisture, as a result the cake took longer to bake through. I'll make it again and find a fat to add moisture.

Great with minor modifications. I used 1/3 cup coconut milk and 2 large dollops of sour cream as suggested in earlier reviews. Also used sweetened coconut, but did not toast. The cake was a huge hit at my family brunch. Will make again soon to use the rest of coconut milk. I made cake a week in advance, wrapped well and froze and it tasted fresh!

Is this not a fabulous recipe? Sweet, buttery, and so forgiving! I added some milk as suggested and have had nothing but success. I have made it with untoasted coconut and no coconut at all, both with excellent results. Multiplying the recipe by 1.5 and adding 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup buttermilk, and 1 tsp baking soda yields a scrumptious 12" butter cake. I highly recommend this recipe!

Well, I made alterations to the recipe after reading the reviews, but wish I had just stuck with the recipe for my first time out. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cups, added 1/4 coconut milk, and used almond extract instead of coconut extract. The texture of the cake came out more like a nice coconut bread. The decreased amount of sugar, I think, made it taste less like cake. It was still enjoyable, but I will try this as written the next time. ***I will admit that my diabetic parents were grateful for the lowered amount of sugar.***

I agree with the last reviewer that this recipe calls for way too much sugar, but other than that it's fantastic! I made a few minor changes. I didn't have any butter so I used 1/2 C. Crisco & 1/2 C. applesauce to help cut the fat. I also cut the sugar down to 1 C. and would probably cut it down to 3/4 C. next time since I used sweetened, flaked coconut. I didn't have coconut extract but I did use about 1/4 C. coconut creme (Coco Lopez brand). This added great coconut flavor but unfortunately added to the sweetness. I forgot to add the sour cream as suggested by previous reviewers. Will definitely do that next time because it was still crumbly. Overall, though, 2 big thumbs up!

Not good at all. I ommitted the extracts and added coconut oil. I did not use sweetened flaked coconut. I used fresh coconut meat toasted for 10 minutes @ 170 'c. I topped with slivered almonds and fresh coconut. Still, texture was not "macaroony". And it calls for WAY too much sugar. I made many maccaroons and thousands of poundcakes. This is an eggy recipe trying to be something it is not. - a pastry chef

I made this cake last night for a customer and was surprised to find out how dry it was. I ususally read the reviews but with this one being 4 forks..I passed. Next time I think I'll add the sour cream and a little of coconut milk. Has a good flavor, only dry.

Made exactly as directed and the cake was absolutely delicious! Will make again and again.

made with the kids. easy and yummy. We used a bundt cake pan. In addition to the ingredients listed, I added 1/4 c. coconut milk and 4 dollops of sour cream to make sure it was moise.

Followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't have the coconut extract and didn't toast the coconut). It was still delicious. My mother enjoyed it very much as her mother's day treat.

I made this for Easter and it was delicious--even more so the next day. Since I read the reviews, and it said it could be dry, I did add 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream and 1/4 cup milk. The texture was perfect and it was a huge hit.

I made some changes: used almond extract instead of coconut extract and sub 1/3 cup sliced almonds for some of the coconut. Next time I'll add 1/4 cup or more of unsweetened coconut milk to make it more moist.

Ok. I just wanted to follow up on my last review. This is awesome & easy. This has become one of the most requested desserts in my line-up (which also has your faboo raspberry truffle brownies & tequila lime tart!). This truly rocks! Also yummy toasted the next morning!

So very yum! It was easy to make...I actually had all the ingredients on hand! It was moist & delicious all on it's own...wow! I would so very much make this again. Now, I DID toast the coconut...picture a big ol' macaroon! Awesome!

Surpringly good, even though I'm not really a coconut fan. I *did* toast the coconut, which I definitely recommend, but I only used 1/4 t of coconut extract. I originally made this to go with the Curried Couscous with Roasted Vegetables, Peach Chutney and Cilantro Yogurt and Mango Martini recipes (both from this site) - yum. This cake keeps very well for over one week: it's still moist and delish with just some vanilla ice cream and/or fruit.

Delicious, easy (esp with a KitchenAid! :) and a surefire hit every time. I didn't toast the coconut either, and it still turned out great, so I just skip that step now. Make it special by frosting the cake, or (more simply), either making a sugar icing or just dust some powdered sugar over it. You could also lay some sliced tropical fruit over it (in a pinch, I've used canned mandarin oranges and it still works!).

I only had unsweetened coconut so I used it. I also used bananas that had become quite ripe and were then frozen to save them for a baking project. As a result, they were a lot sweeter and made up for the sugar missing in the coconut. It turned out great...very tasty, buttery, moist,and plenty sweet.

Like another reviewer, I don't think I missed anything by not toasting the coconut. I recommend cutting back the sugar and increasing the cococnut a little bit. The cake came out great: moist and crumbly and with lots of flavour. Served it with vanilla ice cream for a simple outdoor dessert that guests loved. I personally thought it was a little heavy, though. Note: if you use baby loaf pans, the recipe yields three small cakes.

I loved this recipe and am making it again for the Fourth of July weekend. Family and friends raved about it. I sliced fresh peaches to lay on each slice and drizzled hot chocolate sauce over it. DELICIOUS!

GREAT flavor, really moist but very crumbly...maybe I needed to cook it a tad longer. Great with coffee!

Mmm! I forgot to toast the flaked coconut, so it went in untoasted, and the cake came out fine. I don't know what toasting the coconut would have added - maybe made it a tad less sweet? Very easy and a good, moist cake.

This was really a great pound cake. It wasn't too heavy, the flavor was really nice (not too sweet). My cake was pretty crumbly though, which made it a pain to cut, but other than that, it was great!

Fabulous flavor, moist and with the fruit a great summer time dessert. I didn't grill the cake & I used 'Bananas Foster' ice cream. YUM!

Fun to grill this after dinner. Guests loved it, were happy to have "leftover" dessert for lunch!
