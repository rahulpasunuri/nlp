I made this but substituted green onions for both the onions and chives (I did not saute the onions first)and instead of using 2 lbs of scallops, I used 1 lb of scallop pieces and 1 lb of raw shrimp. I did have to add panko crumbs because, as other people have noted, the 2 tbsp of flour is not enough to bind the mixture. These ARE bland but I added a squirt of Sriracha (asian pepper sauce) to the cakes. I also used Sriracha in the mayonnaise mix and there was a nice "bite" to the dish. I would not recommend serving this without the Cilantro/Lime mayo, as it is the perfect companion for this dish!

These scallop cakes were delicious. Agree that they absolutely need the panko crust before frying. I served at brunch and were great with a mimosa.

I've made these scallop cakes twice exactly as the recipe directed and they were perfect. I was worried that I would not have enough binder or that I could need bread crumbs on the outside, but I perservered and didn't make any changes. They are delicious just as written! (just be sure to dry the scallops thoroughly before adding to the food processor.) I served it with a chipotle avocado mayonaise instead of the sauce listed though.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a success even when cooking for my mom who is the hardest to please when it comes to seafood dishes! I do however simply give the scallops a rough chop, play around with different herbs, and dredge the cakes in panko for added texture. Other than that I keep the recipe the same and it is always sure to please every time.

These were great as part of a first course of a trio of scallop dishes. I used panko only on outside for crispness and they were perfect.

My scallops were very wet and I needed to add some Panko to keep the cakes together, but these ended up being a complete hit. I will be making these often.

Fantastic! Didn't have any chives on hand and added some cayenne for a little kick, otherwise followed the recipe and came out great.

These were very good - a nice change from crab cakes. I made some of the modifications suggested - not overprocessing the scallops and adding panko breadcrumbs are a must to help keep the cakes together - if you chill the mixture well before forming into cakes that helps too. LOVED the cilantro mayo!

We followed the recipe and had none of the problems mentioned in other reviews. The cakes were delicious, and the cilantro mayo was awesome. This one's a keeper.

Not a fan of this recipe! I followed everyone's suggestions (didn't over chop the scallops, patted the scallops dry), but until I started adding panko, the cakes wouldn't not stick together. The more panko I put in, the better they formed. I checked out other crab cake recipes and every one of them had at least a cup of breadcrumbs per pound of shellfish. Are scallops more starchy they they wouldn't need breadcrumbs? What a mess to clean up. Can I use living at 9,000 feet as an excuse why mine were so bad?

I was very much afraid to make these scallop cakes -- having read the reviews. Howver, following the recipe exactly I found that they do not "weep". Due to my fear, I used two egg yolks rather than a whole egg. I think those who had trouble may have over-chopped the scallops. I thawed mine in a collander, I used no bread crumbs, or any other binder -- other than the flour recommended in the recipe. Please do try these scallop cakes. They are wonderful -- just be careful to thaw scallops in a collander and not over-chop!

Because I am allergic to scallops, I substituted salmon. It is terrific! The cilantro-lime mayonnaise is so delicious that you'll be scrounging around in your refrigerator to find things to dip in it and eat.

There was no mention of dry scallops in the ingrediants list, so I proceeded accordingly and got scallop mush that did not survive the spatula. So I added more flour and lowered the heat in the pan. The modified version fared better but I don't think I'll make this one again. The mayo-sauce, however was delicious and I used it the next day as one of two dips for salmon balls. I would make the mayo again for other seafood cakes, patties, balls, and fritters.

I'd give this 1.5 forks if I could, and I may try it one more time, chopping the shellfish just a bit finer. We love scallops and are fond of "cakes" as well, but all in all we were underwhelmed by this recipe. It's certainly nothing I'd waste an expensive bunch of dry-packed diver scallops on. Make the crab cakes w/ Meyer lemon aioli featured in Bon Appetit last summer if you want a great seafood cake recipe. However, that recipe also needs some Panko in the mix and as a coating to hold things together. Seems odd that so many of the recipes on this site are missing a good binding ingredient. There must be some super-secret chef's trick to get them to hold together as written.

Loved it! My husband was thrilled with the abundance of various flavors. Chopped up not-quite thawed scallops so it ended up slightly runny prior to cooking, but with pancake-like skill, they stayed intact and thick. Awesome!!

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I used large wild scallops and went for very few pulses on the food processor in order to get nice huge chunks of meat. Although I completely patted the scallops dry, there was still a litte leakage on the baking sheet as they chilled. With careful flipping in the pan and transfers to the baking sheet, all the patties remained intact. For future attempts, I may double the flour or add some panko bread crumbs to hold the patties together a little better.

Positively delicious but you MUST add panko breadcrumbs to the mixture before forming into cakes. Otherwise you will have a mess, no matter how much you dry the scallops.

I should have listened to the reviews. What a waste of wonderful (not to mention expensive) scallops.

Rating: 4
Absolutely outstanding taste and very, very elegant presentation. I have made this dish three times exactly per the recipe and didn't find it at all necessary to add bread crumbs to hold the mixture together. I think the secret is to thoroughly pat the scallops dry after rinsing them before pulsing in the food processor. Having said that, scallops are often injected with water before going to market and everyone who did add bread crumbs was pleased with the results, so . . . I guess each cook just has to use her best judgment. In any event, this one's a keeper for me.

I had absolutely no problems with this, and I added no breadcrumbs (a.k.a. filler!) Perhaps you people aren't buying "dry" scallops, or not draining them on paper towels sufficiently. Unless you go to a really good fish monger or decent seafood market, you get scallops that are sitting in liquid, then you end up taking them home in a tub full of the stuff. I suggest after a good soaking to remove sediment that you drain them wrappped up in paper towels in the frig. I think you shoul;d also be careful not to "over-process" the scallops. one or two one-second pulses in the machine is plenty. But if you must use breadcrumbs, I too suggest panko. Those store-bought "Italian" breadcrumbs remind me of the contents of my bagless Hoover's dust bin!

Yummy! My husband could not stop going on about how delicious it was. I did throw in a few tablespoons of bread crumbs and coated it in breadcrumbs as well. Used olive oil instead of peanut oil. Will be including this in my dinner menus!

You HAVE to add panko breadcrumbs to the mixture for this to be a 3 Forker. Without them, the mixture is a sticky mess that is impossible to form into cakes. I also dredged them in panko before browning. Epicurious should revise this recipe.

I did roll the scallop cakes with Panko before frying and it gave a beautiful crust. This dish was extremely popular with guests and will not get rubbery unless they get overcooked. This recipe is a real keeper.

Rating: 3
I had made a similar recipe for shrimp cakes and the texture was rubbery. So one slice of toasted bread whipped up in my mini-food processor made the texture of this recipe just fine (I halved the recipe with only 1 pound of scallops) This was a great use for the small (and cheap!) bay scallops we get here from the Gulf. I omitted the mustard from the cilantro-lime mayo and added on large clove of minced garlic to make an aioli. Tasted great!

I rated the recipe yesterday and forgot to mention to cut down on the salt by at least 1/2. It is way too salty.

I really enjoyed the flavours in the scallop cakes. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to bind them together, and added plain yogurt to the cilantro-mayo sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I normally don't love cilantro, but it is really nice in this dip. My husband, who is not a seafood lover, even liked them. A definite keeper.

I wish I had the success many of the other reviewers did. Unfortunately, things did not go well. I did follow the recipe, including actually measuring the ingredients, and ended up with an overly watery mixture that couldn't be formed into patties. I wish I had read these reviews to add panko crumbs. Better yet, I wish the recipe had included them in the first place. It may have saved the texture, but nothing would have saved the over saltiness. Perhaps I got scallops which had been frozen with a very salty solution. Had to throw the whole mess away. A very disappointing (and expensive) experiment.

Just a quick note to Dave, I spend a quarter of the year in London and would never dream of putting fine British scallops in the blender. Unfortunately, most of us in the U.S. are limited to using scallops that are bloated from the solution in which they are soaked and have only a passing hint of the flavor you know so well. This is a fine option for most of us.

I've made these twice now and plan to do so again tomorrow. I think they're wonderful, and very vibrant w/ the lime juice and zest. I used about 3/4 cup of panko to hold them together, then lightly coated them w/ more panko just before baking (didn't do the initial frying) and otherwise followed the recipe. I did hand-chop the scallops rather than putting in the food processor. I'm not a fan of cilantro, either, but thought the sauce was actually a good complement. For the person who asked about substituting for this, I also made the sauce that's in the "crab cakes w/ red chili mayo" recipe, and we thought it was pretty tasty w/ the scallop cakes as well. (That crab cake recipe is really good, too!)

Rating: 4
This recipe is superb. I wish I could give it more than four forks! I made the cakes smaller and served them as an appetizer. My guests and my family loved them. They are easy to make, moist, tasty and make an elegant presentation. I will definitely make these again - in fact, my guests that night are hoping I make them again for them!

Hey chef dave. No where in this recipe does it call for the higher end "diver" or "dayboat" scallops. of course throwing those in the blender is not cost-effective. This recipe merely calls for "sea scallops" which doesn't Necessarily ,ean the finest grade to which you referred. And the Helen, to say "panee in a frying pan" is redundant.

Lovely! Similar in flavor (although not in texture) to a moussaline of scallops I had in Provance last summer. One more yolk perhaps, a little heavy cream and more of a puree in the food processor and this would be even better!

I pesonally have to agree with Helen and Dave, though there's no need to throw credentials around; it does sound rather snarky. Scallops are wonderful sauteed; the sauce is a nice accompaniment. I don't care for citrus peel, and wonder if I lose much by leaving it out. Any suggestions?

Rating: 0
Suggestion to the cooks who dislike cilantro: How about lemon basil, lemon balm or lemon verbena (may have to look for these herbs at a farmer's market), or even lemon grass which is readily available and very flavourful. If you opt for lemon grass, use only the white/pale green parts and mince it very, very fine (then mince it again!) and saute with the onions to soften it, otherwise it will be tough and very unpleasant to chew. Paired with the lime, these lemony herbs should be a good substitute for cilantro. Enjoy this great recipe which I reviewed April 15th. Cheers!

As a a professional Chef for the past 40 years and currently running my own Fish and Seafood restaurant in the UK for the past 21 years, the idea of taking fresh diver caught scallops and blitzing them in a Robot Coupe is simply heresy. I completely agree with Helen who says, simply lightly pan fry the scallops in the pan and use the other ingredients as a garnish. Scallops are one of the finest seafoods in the ocean and do anything else with them is quite frankly uncouth. It is not a question of an open mind, it is a question of respect for the product you are using. David Peek Chef-Patron www.haxtedmill.co.uk

Question for everyone---If a person dislikes cilantro, would they be likely to enjoy this dish in spite of that?

Rating: 0
I am not rating this recipe, just offering food for thought. For those who said the texture was weird- how much lime juice did you use and how long did you let the cakes sit before frying? Lime or lemon juice will "cook" fish if left in contact with it for any length of time. That is how to make ceviche. This recipe says to let them sit for 1 hour with lime juice and lime peel. Maybe that is too long in some cases. ??

After reading the reviews I looked forward to this dish. Rather than blend the scallops I chopped them roughly. Used more panko (instead of crumbs) and more flour. I know a dish meets "par" when I don't have to ask my husband, "how is it". He says, with roll of the eyes and a smile, this is ummmmmmmmm, great!

Helen From culinary school: You've posted your arrogant, condescending remarks on other recipes on this website, too, and each time you come off sounding pretentious, self-agrandizing and desperate for validation from a bunch of complete strangers. The fact that you went to culinary school is NOT RELEVANT to matters related to personal opinions such as taste. I'm a CIA grad, and have worked in some of the finest restaurants in Manhattan, Paris and throughout Burgundy. I've made scallop cakes before, and find them to be delicious.

I have made this dish twice. The consistency was a little too soft to form patties so I added additional bread crumbs, which worked out fine. I also rolled the patties in Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) before chilling. Next time I think I will add some chopped shrimp to the mixture. This is definitely a keeper.

I was soooo disappointed. Followed the directions exactly with great scallops from Whole Foods and the texture of the cakes was---odd. Too soft and the seasoning was not really assertive. Not something I'll be doing again with scallops--too "squishy". The sauce was good and tart, but could not save the cakes.

WHAT? Am I the only person for whom this recipe does NOT work? I ended up with the nastiest scrambled-hash-like-scallop glop I've ever seen. Appearance notwithstanding, the taste was barely tolerable, but the cilantro mayo was very tasty and covered up the icky flavor nicely. I thought to myself "TRUST Bon Apetit - these will stick together if they say they will!" But they didn't - I should have trusted my own experience on this one, I guess. It was a waste of perfectly good scallops and a weekend night meal opportunity, I guess.

Although I have made crab or salmon cakes many times, I never thought of scallop cakes - what a brilliant idea! Delicious flavours and perfect blend of herbs/spices to complement, but not overpower, the delicate taste of the scallops. Loved the cilantro/lime mayonnaise, but think these cakes would also be good with an Asian dipping sauce. I heeded the advice of the first reviewer and added 2 tbsp. fine bread crumbs along with the flour and it held together well. This is an outstanding recipe - thanks Epicurious!

The flavor of the cakes was phenomenal. I do not believe that 3 T. of flour is enough to "bind" everything together. If I make it again, I will add either fine bread or cracker crumbs to hold it together. The mayo was delightful.
