Wow - so much easier than I expected! Yes they do take time. I started around 5 in the evening, did the 4 "turns", did the overnight in the fridge, then shaped, rise, and bake in the morning. Made 1/2 butter croissants, 1/2 chocolate. Definitely making these again.

I made this recip.last night and it as absolutey fantastic. Very easy to handle. I made th dough a little soft and once i was done mixing the dough i knead it and let it sit for about 5 mins. Also at he begining i rolled the butter between a piece of saran wrap and let it chill in the freezer. Once the douh was ready the entire proces took about one hour. The thing with this type of dough is that you must work quickly so the butter does not melt. My family is eating as i am writing this review and they love it. Will definitely make this flaky deliciousness again.

I make these every Easter. They're a labor of love--very time consuming, but absolutely delicious.

Although I have never shied away from any culinary challenge, for some reason, I always have been afraid to tackle croissants. Perhaps it is the awe with which I regarded my neighborhood pattiser when growing up in France. But this year, finding myself at my father's with a couple extra pounds of Kate's of Maine butter (I always bring about 10 pounds of this, far the freshest and most sumptuous butter I have found, with me for the holidays), so I decided to try this recipe. I am hooked. The recipe is a cinch, and the results are fantastic. I only made one change, which I recommend to those who, like me, prefer croissants with a little touch of sweetness. At the final stage, when rolling up the triangles of dough to assemble the final croissants, I sprinkle some vanilla sugar on my work surface, gathering a light covering on both sides of the triangle before rolling it up. I also tried a variation on a few of the croissants. Before rolling the triangle, I sprinkled a mix of ground roasted nuts--varied among walnuts, hazelnuts and pecans--blending with a little flour and a pinch of vanilla powder. This added a delightful nuttiness to the finished croissants.

By the way, I don't use the bread machine anymore, I make the dough with my mix master.

I think this is the 3rd review I write for the recipe. I get raves about these croissants every time I make them. Made them for guests from France last week and they gobbled them up. Well worth the trouble and time. See my other reviews for the difference in baking I made.

This is a wonderful recipe. I only made adjustments for altitude. With the lower pressure of a higher altitude kitchen, proofing times can be cut way down. The last proof before cutting/rolling the croissants was just 2 hours vs. 8. Once cut/rolled, the proof time was just 45 minutes. Living in a drier climate, the water sprayed into the oven was not sufficient, so I placed a baking pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven, which steamed the croissants throughout the baking time. No pools of butter, no burned bottoms. Very, very good.

Although time consuming, making these croissants was worth it. They were flaky and buttery just like one would expect. My only complaint was that they were a little too salty, so in the future I would add less than a full tablespoon.

The main reason why the butter is melting is, in my opinion, because the baking temperature is too low. Bake them at 475 for 12 minutes one baking sheet at a time and you won't have that problem. Made another batch yesterday, well worth the time!

I forgot to mention that I wouldn't use baking sheets again. The runoff from the melting butter in the croissants coated the floor of my oven.

The first couple times I tried this dough I came out with croissants which had the consistency of bread. I had all but given up when a pastry chef friend of mine told me the only mistake I'd made was probably not letting the dough proof enough, and she was right- I'd missed the last rise! I cut the dough in half, letting one rise in the refridgerator as instructed and the other rise at room temperature. While still heavier than the store-bought croissants I'm used to, they were still wonderfully flaky and croissant-like. However, given the time requirement, I'll probably save this for company and stick to store-bought croissants.

One thing I forgot, I use one cup of bread flour to 3 cups of all purpose flour. Just made a batch today, 12 minutes in the oven at 475 degrees was sufficient.

I made Julia Child's recipe for many years and almost always succeeded but the recipe made only one dozen and the only way to double was to make two batches. This recipe makes 24 croissants and is easier I find though as long to make. I have made two changes. I use my bread machine to knead, cancelling the preheat cycle and timing 7 minutes of kneading. I also use Julia Child's baking instructions, painting the croissants with an egg glaze and baking at 475 degrees for 13 minutes one batch at a time. I freeze them when they are cooled and to eat, put them on a baking sheet frozen at 400 degrees for 4 minutes. Perfect

These croissants were my first attempt and were PERFECT. Buttery, with gorgeous layers and a slightly crisp brown crust. The perfect pastry. This recipe includes fantastic instructions.

My croissants turned out more like Pillsbury's Crescent Rolls that you buy at the store. Not sure where I went wrong- maybe the high altitude (5280 ft) effected the yeast? The yeast foamed initially but after all the folding and the resting for 8 hours it didn't expand very much. Any tips of wisdom is appreciated!!! I will make again and hopefully the 2nd time will be better!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the directions: when I went to switch the sheets, my croissants were so beautifully risen. After I amnipulated them (following the recipe), they've collapsed. And yes, they are getting too brown on the bottom, even with the silver sheet. So, next time: bake one sheet at the time. Another thing, my bf, who worked at the bakery, said that when they made theirs (and those are great!), they went from the fridge to the oven, so no proffing in the room temprature. This is the direction for the regular puff pastry as well (so the butter gets cold and creates layers). This dough has yeast though... what do you think?

Just on my 4th straight from the oven w light cream cheese and blackberry jam - yum first attempt and easy. Wanted to try after seeing Meryl Streep in it's complicated movie. Always put off by rolling the butter.. So I microwaved it for 20 secs till softened & whisked till smooth then put back it fridge stirring occasionally. Then just spread it on. Also baked for 8 mins and half batch made as pains au chocolat and they are proving - can't wait!

Perfect on my first try. Very good directions. Delicious.

These are incredible. It was my first time making croissants and this recipe is very thorough. I also had black bottoms - but that was because I have old baking sheets. As long as you have a good silver sheet and some parchment these will turn out fine. It is time consuming but WELL worth the effort. Not at all as hard as I expected. Also, mine took around 8 minutes per switch, not 10...just keep an eye on them. Highly recommended!

This is the most exceptional croissant I have ever put in my mouth. My sweetie, who is hard to impress, ate these cold for days after I made them. My coworkers want me to go into business selling them. Truly exquisite. Just remember to use rimmed baking sheets so the butter that they throw off doesn't set your oven on fire. The apartment takes a few days to air out after that.

These were absolutely fantastic! Probably the clearest instructions for rolling out the dough that I've seen in a croissant recipe, too. One caveat: don't try to freeze dough - it does funky things when you defrost & use (don't know what the mechanism is, but you end up with a nice, chewy pastry swimming in a sea of melted butter). Better to bake the whole batch & freeze the baked croissants. But these truly are incredible croissants.

These are divine. I've had the recipe marked for trial for some time and I can't figure out why I waited so long to make them. I won't make that mistake again. A tip for those who had burnt bottoms, dark pans will give you pastry dark results. If you can find a new shiny silver baking sheet, your croissants will be a perfect golden colour.

Making croissants is a project, but worth it for a special occassion

Wow! And again I say, Wow! I'd give this recipe 5 forks if I could. Just adapt your workout to compensate. These are glorious, and not that difficult. The Gourmet mag walks you through the shaping with photos. Planning ahead is key, as these are a project. . .but what a worthy project. Double the recipe and keep some in the freezer. My kids like to take one in their lunchbox for recess/snack time.

These were excellent. Flaky, soft, buttery and crispy on the outside. I didn't have any trouble with my bottoms burning. I preheated the oven to 400 degrees F and then put the croissants in and turned the oven down to 350 degress F. The croissants took a little longer to cook but they came out perfectly golden on the tops and bottoms.

I had to go to 2 different recipes to get one complete recipe. Besides this one which only shows me the final steps of this recipe. The other part is in a recipe called croissant dough. This part contained the ingredients and the first steps. Quite confusing!

A triumph! A lot of time and effort, but not really a difficult recipe--and every bit as delicious as the croissants I remember eating at the French patisseries in Morocco. I used Plugra (higher percentage of butterfat). One word of caution--watch baking times as oven temps vary. I determined my croissants did better at eight minute intervals, rather than ten, after a few burned bottoms.

I get "Pastry Flour" 500 ml and mix with Unbleached 310 ml. This makes them crustier, lighter, softer (a LITTLE more like Paris). Then I roll the butter in in two 5 x 8 pieces (easier). I roll the dough in 18" x 8" and cut in triangles -Makes the layers thinner and not so doughy inside (a LITTLE more like Paris) The Three inch triangles I roll up too. Still making the 24 with 8 little ones. THEN I put an "Oven liner pan" from the market (cheap) sprayed with water on the bottom and the 12 croissants on parchment paper on the oven liner pan on top. 500 degrees in my oven EXACTLY 6 minutes. Turn and switch the pans, another 6 minutes. Do the same with the other 12 making sure the oven is 500 degrees. The first time I tried this they looked very dark but not so!! I freeze them immediately out of the oven and eat one a day so have made these every three weeks or so. They are not QUITE Paris, but not BAD.

These are fabulous. I just took them out of the oven, and they're beautiful, light and flaky. I would definitely make them again. I would like to note, however, that they require a lot of work and attention, so only attempt them on a day when you're feeling very ambitious...

You need to set aside two days to make the croissant dough, and the croissants. The croissants were very tasty, but were black on the bottom. I wonder if it is because I used waxed paper instead of parchment? I will try this recipe again, only so I can perfect it!

I liked the resultant size of these, and the texture given the baking instructions was just the best I've ever made. I've tried two other recipes, but the high heat and steam at the beginning seems to really set these apart. Crisp on the outside, tender and yeasty on the inside, they turned out beautifully. Since I'm at high altitude, I found that letting the last proof stop at the 2 hour mark and upping all the temps by 25 degrees gave what seemed to be equivalent results.
