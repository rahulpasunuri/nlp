It was something different that I'd never made before. It tasted delicious, but next time I should be able to cook it better

Just finished making this recipe for a coffee tomorrow. Would you please the quantities for the last two ingredients. The recipe reads "1 tablespoons". Is the "s" on tablespoons just a typing error or should their be more than one tablespoon? I found that the dough would not form a ball with 1 tablspoon of lemon juice, so I added another tablespoon for a total of 2. I would appreciate your comments on this and also any corrections I should make. Thank you Ann B Hendrick

I may make this again, but I would add more lemon juice to give it a stronger flavor and more butter since it lacks the butter melt-in-your mouth taste people expect when they eat shortbread.
