9x9 pan is too small like other reviewers said it would be. I switched to a 9x13 pan and that worked much better and it took longer to cook through than 28 minutes.

Don't make the same mistake I made.DO NOT use a 9x9 pan! Use 13x9. Way too much batter for such a small pan and it didn't cook all the way through. We ate around that though.

These were sinful and decadent - I loved the white chocolate chips. They "broke up" the intense richness of the chocolate just a bit. Will make these again and again.

Oh chocolate euphoria! Oh oral ecstasy! I made these in two 8-inch round pans and served them as cake slices, which seemed to fit better with the creme anglaise topping. I underbaked them (about 20 minutes total) which added to their gooey perfection.

I took one of the suggestions below and baked the batter in a 13 x 9 pan since the 9 x 9 did sound too small. I baked it for 28 minutes, as the original said; I figured it would be a thinner layer and less likely to underbake. I tested it after 28 minutes and the knife came out clean, but a lot of the brownies fell apart when cut. Maybe I should have waited longer, perhaps chilling the pan in the refrigerator. The taste was excellent, but I will search for a recipe that does not require this kind of tinkering.

I really thought this was going to be the mother of all brownie recipes from the reviews that I read. For me, this recipe is just way too sweet. I prefer to taste more chocolate than sweet in my brownies, so I think I'll continue my search. About 35 minutes is a better cooking time for those bent on giving this one a go.

I've never had anyone tell me before that a brownie was too rich. They are fantastic, but a little more complicated and costly than the basic. I also found that it too much for a 9x9. A bigger pan can be used.

Although I'll refrain from using any biblical references, I must say that this recipe was quite "heavenly". Like the last reviewer, I made these delectable brownies for me and my "lover". Smart move... Didn't make the Creme Anglaise or serve ice cream with the brownies for the combination of all three would have put us in a diabetic overload. My only suggestion is to bake the brownies a litle longer than the suggested 28 minutes. My first batch came out a little too under cooked. Otherwise, simply fabulous!

Jesus H. Christ this was good! I can't remember the last time I had anything better. Chocolate, white chocolate, oh Christ! You must make this for yourself or lover. Lord! Janet Jacalone

One of the best brownie recipes I have come across. The brownie base reminds me of Boston Brownie Company brownies. A definite keeper.

Chocolate and white chocolate are two things that deffinetly always go together.
