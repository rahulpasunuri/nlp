I made this while on vacation in New Orleans where the grocery stores have spicy smoked sausage. It helped perk up this recipe with spice, but it still needed some hot sauce. I'd make it again with the addition of cayenne pepper.

I made the recipe as written. It was a disappointing and pale imitation of any jambalaya I have eaten. I tried it again, cutting the rice to 1 1/4 cups, the tomatoes to a 16 oz. can, adding 1 tablespoon cajun seasoning, a pinch of saffron, a pinch of cayenne, and substituting 1 cup chicken broth and 3/4 cup water. After the jambalaya cooked and was standing, I sauteed 1/2 pound cleaned and deveined shrimp in some olive oil and added it to the pot before fluffing the rice. I believe it was much improved.

Wish I could have given a higher rating. I Love Jambalaya. This was my first attempt to make it from scratch without any prepackaged spices. This was only good. I tweaked it a little to my taste. I agree with a previous reviewer, I def added much more sausage than recommended by the recipe. I also added some black beans to it. Next time I make it, I'm not adding canned tomatoes directly to the pot. I would prefer to either use fresh tomatoes, or at least sautee the canned ones before adding to the rice. I could totally taste the canned tomatoes. Not so good.

We loved this Jambalaya! I made a few changes to the recipe: I used 3/4 cup of brown rice instead of white, added 1 lb of cooked shrimp, 1 teas of cayenne pepper and eliminated the green peppers. I will definitely make this again!

This Jambalaya was very good. My husband and I have over 20+ years in the restaurant/hospitality industry. This is a dish that I would make again and order if it were offered at a restaurant. I did make a few modifications to the recipe. We prefer to eat a little healthier so I used 14 oz of Turkey Kielbasa (still had plenty of flavor), reduced the amount of rice to 1 1/2 cups, used 1 cup water and approx. 2 cups Chicken broth (I added by sight rather than measuring) and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. I added crushed red pepper flakes and a few dashes of white pepper for a little kick (I was out of Cajun seasoning). It was delicious. If you like "hot" dishes definitely add seasoning. In our home we prefer good flavor over heat alone. Next time I would add a little Cajun seasoning, but other than that it was great.

My first time making Jambalaya. Loved it, but added Cayenne Pepper, two bay leaves, four sprigs of thyme, paprika, cajun seasoning, and a chicken breast.

Me and my mom love to cook..even though were not gourmet. I sawn this and thought it looked great...I tried it out and it ended up being ALOT OF FOOD!! I recomend cutting the recipe in half but leaving the amount of sausage the Same. We added some of our own Cajun spices to give it some flare. It was delightful. And we will be sure to make it again soon :)

This makes a great meal with a few added bits! So I am from the UK and to help translate for others scallions are spring onions! So I followed the recipe exactly except I used half water and half chicken stock, added 2tbsp of worcester sauce, 2tsp of paprika and 1tsp of creole/cajun seasoning. I also used Chorizo as I couldn't find Andouille or Kielbasa anaywhere. I had 5 very good portions at the end of everything and no mistakes. Would definitely cook this again.

Ok, if you are a Jambalaya newbie, this may be your recipe. I have never made or ate Jambalaya before but my husband has and loves it. It was a simple recipe to follow and if you follow the recipe to the T you will have great results. Being an experienced foodie/cook I tweaked the following.... Smoked Hot Sausage instead of Andouille, Beef Boullion (add no other salt), and cayenne pepper. I read some of the reviews and made those tweaks based on what the said and my husband said it was delicious. Oh and I really enjoyed it too. Making again next week.

I should have let my instincts work for me. As I was poritioning out the rice, I was wary of the amount. This dish is all rice, and does not turn out anything like the photo if you follow the directions. Way too little meat, there's no broth left over. I did substitute chicken broth for about 1/2 of the liquid because I could just sense the blandness in this dish. Other than that, I followed this recipe to the letter. I had to add tons of spices after it was cooked just to get some flavor out of it. The leftovers are going in the trash.

I added sauteed Gulf shrimp and a generous amount of Cajun seasoning to this recipe. My family ate the whole thing. This recipe yields 8 generous servings. Serve it with buttered French bread and a green salad for a great winter meal.

I cannot get Andouile, so I used smoked kielbasa, and I added cayenne pepper and some Tabasco. I also added some Worcester sauce, paprika, Italian chopped tomatoes,and substituted a cup of chicken broth for some of the water. Finally, I added a pound of medium raw shrimp. This was as good as other Jambalaya dishes that I have had elsewhere. Using Andouile would definitely improve it. Good one pot dish for a Sunday evening

This recipe was not at all disappointing. The overall flavor has a lot to do with the sausage used in the making. I used a fairly spicy hand made andouille that I picked up at the local super market. This is definitely an easy recipe to make as I am not an accomplished cook, but still turned out a delicious dinner. I did add 1/2 tsp. Creole seasoning. Can't to enjoy the leftovers.

This recipe was very disappointed. The flavors were shallow and boring. I just kept thinking it was missing something. Definitely edible, but I am already dreading trying to figure out what to do with the other six servings!

This is a very good jamabalya recipe. I did not use andouille, as I am really not a fan, but a very good local smoked sausage link instead, treating it in the same manner. The flavor was delicious. We sampled it as is...yummy...and then I added 1 tsp. Creole Seasoning for authenticity. We'd be hard-pressed to say which version we liked better. This one's a keeper. You could also add cooked chicken and/or cooked shrimp at the end of the cooking time for variations--all are regular local NOLA ingredients for this dish.
