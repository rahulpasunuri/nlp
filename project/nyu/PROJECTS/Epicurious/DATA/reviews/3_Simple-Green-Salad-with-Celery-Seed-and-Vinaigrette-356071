I was looking for a very simple salad to go with my osso bucco and potato gnocchi dinner when I stumbled across this recipe. After reading the last reviewers comments I knew this one was in need of redemtion. I liked the toasted celery seeds, I've never seen that in a salad dressing before. The salad was simple and crisp, just what I wanted. The key to a healthy diet is to eat as many different kinds of healthy foods as you can. Leaf lettuce has vitamin K, vitamin A, folate and even though I love spinach and kale sometimes you want a change.

I would never advise anyone to use 'head lettuce' for ANY recipe. It has no nutritional value, nothing but water and fiber. There are numerous kinds of lettuce that have many nutrients and are tasty too;-)
