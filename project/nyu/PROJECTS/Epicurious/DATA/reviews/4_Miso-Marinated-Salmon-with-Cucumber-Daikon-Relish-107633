This was insanely easy to make and absolutely delicious. Better than if not on par with a gourmet meal at a nice restaurant. I paired this salmon w/ a mango/cucumber/jalepeno relish and it was very nice. Def give this recipe a go and it is bound to be on your weekly rotation....

great recipe for miso salmon. no adjustments made except for marinating overnight. there was enough flavor and sauce for this salmon. it's not suppsoed to be exceptionally heavy.

I think the marinade could have used more miso paste and more liquid. The flavor was good, but since there was so little marinade, the fish was a little bland, even though I cooked the fish in all the marinade instead of shaking off the excess. I put the fish in the oven because my broiler is out of commission. I'd used another recipe as a reference for oven temp and times (500 degrees for 6 mins per side is way too hot, and will overcook the fish). I've had incredible miso-marinated salmon before, but this was not.

Easy and everyone loved it. I only marinaded for 1 hour. My kids 4 and 2 both gobbled it down asking for more.

I made this with some wild sockeye salmon and it was simply amazing. I only marinated it for about 2 hours but that was enough for the fish. The diakon-cucumber salad could be marinated over night for best results.

This is pretty good, but not the greatest recipe ever. I saved the marinade, cooked it and put it on top of the fish as several reviewers recommended. I wish I hadn't done that, as it overwhelmed the salmon. Thank you to the reviewer who pointed out that the cucumber-daikon relish is not the 3 ingredients listed below that, you have to click on the relish. I was confused about that.

this was delicious! Even my daughter said "I love salmon" and my husband said "you always say you hate it!". My only change was to bake at 475 and a light sprinkling of Japanese seven spice when done. I prefer baking to broiling salmon. I served with jasmine rice to which I added dill, butter, lemon zest and edamame. I made a side salad of Persian cucumbers with ricewine vinegar and some sugar and salt. Delicious and the glaze was just so tasty! Don't scrape it off---let it bake through.

I adore this recipe - I could eat it weekly without tiring of it. Like the other posters, I definitely don't scrape off the marinade. I'm embarrassed to add that I have never actually made the accompanying cuke/daikon relish - I must do it one of these days. It will probably tip the meal up into another realm.

I've made this recipe a number of times and absolutely love it. I've heeded the advice of a number of reviewers and have marinated the salmon as long as 24 hours. I've also spooned some of the marinade (after microwaving or boiling to kill any bacteria) over the fish, before spooning on the cucumber-daikon relish, to add more miso flavor. But the one adjustment that added the most has to do with the steamed rice tossed with shelled edamame, which always felt a bit bland. So this last time, I added a couple of spoonfuls of the the liquid that the cucumber-daikon relish is soaking in (rice vinegar, sugar, ginger, cayenne pepper)and tossed it with the rice and edamame. Wow! It helped unify the top and bottom of the dish and took it to a new level. Try it.

Made the complete meal as part of an Asian-themed cooking class I hosted. Also made Vietnamese Summer Rolls and Green Tea Cheesecake, also on this site. I wanted the salmon to have a deeper flavor, so did not scrape off much of the marinade. Plates looked gorgeous, just like the picture, and guests really enjoyed the dish.

An absolutely delicious marinade. I've let the salmon sit for 20 minutes and overnight, but I feel the flavor is just as good either way. We make extra sauce, heat in a small frying pan and use over rice or as extra sauce for the fish. This is a winner!

An excellent and easy recipe! Everyone loved both the salmon and the cucumber relish, and licked the bowl for the marinade.

Works well with longer marinade times too (tried 24hrs last time - perfect!). Lowered the broiler to 9 inches and cooked on a single side only. Great dish! Displays beautifully too.

Wonderful recipe-- be sure to get the freshest salmon for a spectacular meal.

Very tasty especially the edges of the salmon where the miso caramelized. I roasted a one pound fillet, which took about 14 minutes.

This was delicious but should have saved the marinade!!! I rubbed off all of the marinade before putting the salmon in the oven, as the recipe indicates... badly done! i think everyone is right! Next time i will save the marinade and serve it with the fish! It will then be PERFECT!

Omigosh, this is SO delicious! I took the advice of the cook who reserved the marinade & microwaved it to spoon on top. Also, I used the given quantities of marinade for only 2 filets, because we wanted plenty of the yummy sauce. I also added more veggies to the cucumber garnish, just what I had on hand, & that dressed it up (tomato, red bell, avocado & strawberries). But I won't change a thing about the marinade: it's perfect!

Really stellar recipe. We left the majority of the marinade on the salmon while broiling and it turned out wonderful.

Rating: 4
I also wanted a more pronounced miso flavor. I tried marinating it a little longer, but what I found is best is to reserve the marinade and heat it to boiling in the microwave, then spread it back on the fish before serving. I can't say enough good things about this recipe---love it!

Rating: 3
Very tasty indeed! Would have enjoyed a more pronounce miso flavour, but we only marinated it for 1/2 hour. We really enjoyed the cucumber-daikon relish - it complements the salmon very nicely and is definately worth the effort. Will make again!

This recipe is tremendous. It's the perfect combination of sweet & sour, spicy & cool, cold & hot. The relish is well worth the effort (and it's not that difficult-just a little chopping) I'm going to serve it the next time I have dinner guests and since it's so light I'll have a really decadent dessert afterwards. Mmmm....

Fabulous recipe. Since I first made it about 8 months, my husband requests it at least once a week. Usually don't follow the recipe exactly and it always turns out great.

OUTRAGEOUS OUTRAGEOUS RECIPIE. It is so delicious I have made it many times. The salmon is very mellow...such a dainty taste. I have served to company and they have raved. I get tired of my own cooking very often but this really rocked my world.

This was very good, but the relish was too watery for my liking, and I thought it yielded far more than necessary to top the fish. Now I have a whole bowl of it and don't know what I'm going to do with it. However, the fish was excellent, and the relish adds a nice touch - I would just halve the recipe for that next time, and maybe reduce the amount of vinegar.

I made this dish two ways: as written and also leaving out the vinegar and using the miso/mirin as a paste that I rubbed on the salmon. It was delicious and easy to make both ways.

This was a very nice dish. It might have come out as a 4-fork but I overcooked my salmon a bit. We also liked the relish. I made a bit extra of the miso marninade, put it aside, and then used it as a topping for steamed bok choy. Served with rice.

These flavors are fantastic on salmon and I agree; wild salmon is the best. This will be a standard entertaining dish and I might even make it just for my husband (if he's lucky!!!)

I didn't make the relish - I served the salmon, marinated on skewers and it was fabulous. The flavours were great and really showed off the fresh salmon. These got an enormous amount of attention at a bring you own meat barbeque, we barely got to eat any ourselves.

My family loved this. The combination of salmon, relish and rice together was fabulous, definitely worthy of company. We like to try new salmon recipes but rarely find one that rates up with the one or two we return to all the time--this one definitely does. I got daikon easily from my buying club, but I think it would work fine with regular radishes. Also, I used white wine in place of mirin.

I served this for a dinner party of 8 and everyone raved about it! They said the salmon was extremely moist and the dish was 4 star restaurant quality. Make sure you serve it with this delicious relish. I served my salmon over wasabi mashed potatoes too for that added punch. Kudos!

This was a great success at a last minute dinner party thrown for friends visiting in town. The relish was a perfect compliment with its crisp texture and sweetness. It made salmon new again.

This may be the premier manner in which to fix salmon .. it absolutely melts in your mouth, has a great flavor, and is super-simple to make. Be careful not to overcook it. We made it without the relish; will try that next time. Fixing it for guests today.

I only made the salmon recipe, but it was too good for words! Slightly sweet, but no fishy taste at all and so easy. It's a great dish for people who aren't fond of salmon yet want the health benefits.
