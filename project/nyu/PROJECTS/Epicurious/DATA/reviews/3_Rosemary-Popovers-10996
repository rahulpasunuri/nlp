While this was a good basic recipe for popovers, the result was a bit bland for my tastes. I would add a bit more salt to the batter, either put rosemary in batter or put half of batter in, sprinkle with rosemary, fill rest of way and sprinkle again. The addition of finely chopped garlic or making a paste with salt as one does with a salad and adding to batter would also increase taste. Texture was very good and the "pop" was certainly there.

This is a great way to use the other half of a package of rosemary. To the cook who thought this was little bland, add a few small cloves of chopped garlic. Mmmm.

Have made these popovers several times, and have enjoyed them. Very good flavor.

I have to disagree with the earlier reviewer - I thought these were very flavorful. And so easy!

I was looking forward to these because I love rosemary! I thought they were very bland, however. Maybe they need double the rosemary...definitely something more!
