We really enjoyed this dish. We actually used 2 cups of broth and simmered it down to about 1.5 cups. It was delicious! It was almost like it was tabouleh stuffed tomatoes. yum! We will definitely make this again.

I usually love mixing dried fruits and couscous but the mix with the tomato did't seem right. So I used dry tomatoes ibstead and omitted the lemon juice. I actually used bulgur instead of couscous for its nuttier, crunchier taste. Turned out a very healthy lunch meal

Easy to make. "Blanching" the currants in the stock takes some of the sweet edge off (nice). Some toasted pine nuts go well with the couscous, and a topping of fresh oregano and parmesan is wonderful. Kosher salt seems to draw the water out of tomatoes better than table salt. * Might use slightly less stock in making couscous, or cook for another 1-2 minutes.

I garnished with a thin lemon slice before baking and then added a sprig of dill before serving. They looked gorgeous. I also used dried cranberries instead of currants and they were more flavorful.

We've made this a couple of times now, and have found it a flavourful accompaniment to grilled lamb (and substituting lamb stock for chicken stock). The 'pockets' of tomatoes make it a convenient way to serve dinner guests. Very nice.

I found this recipe to be dry and lacking flavor. Wasn't worth the effort.

Delicious summer picnic food which is light and easy to make.
