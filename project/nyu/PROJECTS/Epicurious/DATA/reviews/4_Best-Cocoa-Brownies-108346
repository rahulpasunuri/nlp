These came out great! Buttery, rich and delicious. I'm a novice when it comes to scratch brownies so I could have used a little more guidance about the batter consistency. My granulated sugar did not dissolve completely which worried me but didn't pose a problem in the finished product. The batter was also MUCH thicker than I expected. They were difficult to cut after completely cooling, but absolutely delicious.

Made this last minute without a hitch and turned out perfect. So much better than supermarket brownie mixes -- and just as easy. If you have a Pyrex bowl and sturdy pan those will serve as double boiler. Use good butter and chocolate, a reliable oven, and you can't go wrong. Serve slightly warm with a good vanilla ice cream.

Rating: 4
I cook these about 15 - 20 minutes longer than recipe calls for...I check oven frequently and usually double the recipe for a thicker brownie. Really gooey and delicious. Great plain, but have also added dried cherries and have tried mini peanut butter cups - can customize however you like!

I made this with high expectations. Unfortunately there must be something missing because mine came out a gooey conglomerate that tasted great but had to be eaten with a spoon. It made a great ice cream topping but not a brownie.

I agree wholeheartedly that this is the only brownie recipe you will ever need. It's extremely adaptable, turned out beautifully (and gluten-free) with the following modifications: replaced the flour with one half almond flour and one half rice flour. Added 1 teaspoon espresso powder. Reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and bumped up the salt by another eighth of a teaspoon.

Rating: 4
1 word: amazing After searching the kitchen and finding a huge lack of ingredients, I ended up making lots of modifications. 1. For lack on unsalted butter, I used salted and no extra salt 2. I microwaved the butter 3. For lack of vanilla extract, I used almond extract (surprisingly sooooo good) 4. For only two eggs, I used less flour After all this, my friends and family claim they could be in a restaurant. Will make again!

I love reading other reviews, and they inspired me to use applesauce instead of butter and almond meal instead of flour. Plus, I cut the sugar in half. It wasn't until I was tasting the cooked version that I realized it needed salt (as other reviewers pointed out), so I sprinkled some Maldon sea salt on the top and voila. I feel like a healthy-eating genius. Thank you also for recommending they be cooked longer.

Rating: 3
Very rich, but very nice. Added a tad bit more salt as I was measuring out ingredients. Also, I didn't follow the whole double-boiler direction. Instead, I melted the butter in the microwave and then added it to the whisked sugar, cocoa and salt mixture. Came out awesome.

Rating: 4
I used the Dutch process cocoa and added 60%cocoa chocolate chips and walnuts (as recommended). The brownies came out soft and fudge like. They took about 15 extra minutes to cook. Well worth the wait! I passed this recipe on to a friend who needed a gluten free recipe as some reviewers said that the recipe came out great without the flour.

Rating: 1
Huge disappointment. Other people who gave it bad reviews seemed to have problems from the batter. Mine was great: used a fork to beat in the eggs, after which the batter smoothed out pretty nicely, the butter didn't separate out, and it tasted amazing. What came out of the oven was not. Way to thin, not chewy at all, and there were still sugar crystals undissolved in the top of the brownies. This recipe will be ejected from my recipe box as soon as I post this, good riddance.

Rating: 4
I too used only a stick of butter, but I cut down the cocoa to 2/3 cup and the sugar to a slightly heaping cup. Also added dried tart cherries instead of nuts. Deeply chocolaty, moist, delicious.

Yummy!! Made as directed using cocoa powder from France. Rich and moist and very easy to make. This is now my go-to brownie recipe. Toasted the nuts -- really adds flavor and can easily be done while the oven is preheating.

I've made these many times, always to rave reviews. Recently, though, I made them and realized after I put them in the oven that I had somehow forgotten to mix in the flour. They took a long time to cook, but they did cook eventually and they were fantastic. I've made them without flour (and with no other alterations) several times since and they have become my signature baked good.

I received rave reviews for these brownies and have passed on the recipe to two friends. I glazed the brownies with a heavy cream and bittersweet chocolate mixture: 1/2 cup of heavy cream brought to a bare simmer and then added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Prepare while brownies cook.Enough glaze for two brownies recipe... yum!!

To quote our daughter, "Best brownies EVER!!! You rock in the kitchen!" If you would like to find a similar note in your kitchen, please make these brownies. I made them exactly like the recipe and cooked them a bit longer because they were still too moist in the center after 20 minutes...keep testing with a wooden pick until you feel they are ready.

Best Brownies Ever. I've made these for years. To make them wheat -free with spelt, sub spelt flour for regular flour but add 2 Tablespoons. For gluten-free/slightly lower g.i., I posted on my website the variation on this post: http://untilthethinladysings.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-have-gluten-free-healthy.html

The only brownie recipe you need. I made these all the time when I was pregnant and just whipped up another batch for my brother-in-law. They are delicious. I eschew the bain marie in favor of using a glass mixing bowl in the microwave for about 1 minute 15 seconds, mixing with a rubber spatula. The bowl and spatula go straight into the dishwasher and the brownie pan is lined so clean up is a breeze. Chocolaty and chewy. MMMM.

At this point in my life, I don't bake from boxes... except brownies. I had never found a recipe that could match. Until now! These were amazing. Perfectly moist, excellent cocoa flavor. The recipe confused me a little because my softened butter + cocoa mixture never didget melted, but it did get hot and was of uniform texture- and they turned out right, so I assume that's normal. I'll be making these again!

Rating: 4
This is my go-to brownie. It's better than, and just as easy as a mix. My modifications are 1. sea salt (i love the bite that sea salt gives chocolate) and 2) tsp. espresso/coffee. If i have espresso or coffee left from the morning brew i whisk some it after all ingredients are mixed or i'll include a bit of espresso powder. I barely underbake... i love the fudgy center.

Mine turned out great. Used: 1 stick butter same sugar same cocoa 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp vanilla 3 eggs 1/2 c plus 2 tbsp four and no nuts I sifted both the cocoa powder and the flour and I WHISKED the eggs in before the vanilla and only folded in the flour and salt at the end (instead of thoroughly mixing). Baked for 45 min approx. Fudgey/Cakey at the same time. Delicious :)

Rating: 4
Like other reviewers, I've changed this recipe to suit myself thereby rendering the opinion of the posted recipe invalid, imo. I wanted to make it gluten-free so replaced the all-purpose flour with 1 cup of Almond flour and added 1 tsp. of baking soda. I also extended the cooking time to about 35 minutes as others have done. The result was a dense, rich brownie that no one suspected was gluten free and that now I'm adding to my card file. I do think that this is a good base recipe to tweak as wanted!

Wow...I really hated these brownies. I made them exactly as written and they were flat, dry, and just not what a brownie should be. Very disappointing. The only way to eat these was with ice cream. Blech.

Rating: 4
I am a hard-core brownie snob, and these are AWESOME. I use a bit more cocoa to make them less sweet. Fantastic recipe because it doesn't need actual chocolate, so I can make it when I've eaten all the actual chocolate. Works great with a cheesecake top or swirl too :)

Rating: 3
This makes a delicious brownie, but it took quite a while. I guess I didn't have the expected vessels. I ended up using the microwave to get the butter/cocoa hot enough. I had to increase the heat to 350 and add 10 minutes baking time (as I used a glass 8x8 pan). But, in the end, they were delicious. I added pecans and dried cranberries.

Rating: 0
So no review yet...I doubled the recipe and they have been in the oven 2x the baking time. Im not a pro-cook to I dont know if I was suppose to raise the time or anything. Also, I was getting a collection of fluid on top of the brownies as they were baking., Is this normal? Ill give my rating once I try it. But if the brownie isnt good I think its because of something I did.... :(

Rating: 4
Delicious and super easy. This was my first time making these brownies - I didn't change any of the ingredient amounts - and they are spectacular! Next time I may try the changes that others have suggested, just for kicks. I bet they come out just as delicious. For those reviewers who did not like this recipe I wonder if it is because they were expecting them to taste like a mix. Beware: they don't. They are richer, denser, and way more chocolate-y. These are so easy and delicious, I will never bake brownies from a mix again!

If you love a fudgey brownie vs a cake type brownie this recipe is to die for! I have always used a box mix, but no more! My husband and 21 yr old both said it is the best brownie they have ever had.

Well I tried the "natural" cocoa powder this time and I have to say that I much prefer the dutch-process cocoa powder. Not that the natural is not good, just the other is SO good.

SOOOOO good! I highly recommend making this recipe that just uses cocoa powder. I opted with the "dutch processed" cocoa powder Valrhona which is a very high quality cocoa. Turned out very moist, and just simply perfect. Next time for fun I will use the "natural" cocoa powder for tasing comparison.

Rating: 4
I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 by 13 pan for about 35 minutes and it turned out well. The brownies were less sweet than I expected and could definitely use more nuts. They were dense and full of flavor and I think they'd be a great accompaniment to some caramel ice cream :)

Rating: 4
I already had a preferred recipe for brownies, but was looking for a cocoa-only recipe as I had a large packet of cocoa powder but no chocolate. These turned out very well indeed: I reduced the sugar a tad and added a heaped teaspoon of coffee powder. The result was right on the money: fudgy texture, rich and assertive flavour, and not too sweet.

These are amazing. I felt like I was messing everything up while i was making them: I was short on butter, only had cake flour and vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla, but it was all OK. It was all OK because these were still the best brownies ever. Not fussy or complicated, just simply delicious.

Rating: 4
First of all, if you have ever used the words "too much chocolate", these brownies aren't for you - move along. If you love chocolate though, these are fantastic. I accidentally used wheat flour instead of white flour, and I couldn't taste the wheat at all. They did take about 40 mins to bake though, instead of 25. But the other chocolately, chewy recipe I love also takes 40 mins for an 8x8 pan. Instead of nuts, I used cacao nibs.

Rating: 4
Best one bowl fudgey, dense brownies ever. I make them all the time. Add a little instant espresso powder to the butter/sugar/cocoa mix and use Kosher salt to give it some salty bite (our preference). The batter and thick and gluey, just press it in the pan and I promise, if you like fudgey, thick and dense brownies, you will not be disappointed!

Rating: 4
These brownies are excellent, chewy, very rich, exactly what a brownie should be. However, they did take 40 minutes to bake and I had my oven calibrated just last week, so I know it heats properly. All other brownie recipes I have seen say 350 or 375.

Rating: 2
Too rich for me. I followed the recipe exactly and would add sugar and cut down on the butter in the future. Also it took MUCH longer to cook than recipe states. At least 35 minutes.

Whether you find this brownie fantastic or not will be based on personal taste. I love this brownie because it is light and chewy. I don't believe there is a single flaw with the recipe itself. I use very high quality cocoa and fallow the instruction to the letter (although, I admit I am about to mix in cocoa nibs with the walnuts today, I hope it comes out well!).

In short: THESE BROWNIES ARE AMAZING! In long: About a year after I first stumbled across this recipe I thought I'd come back and give a review because this is the most often used recipe in my bag of tricks. Need to satisfy a sweet tooth or chocolate craving? Here's your recipe. Need to knock off a quick something to bring to a dinner party? These guys are your man. This recipe has everything I look for in a brownie: chewy and moist (I often underbake them to give them even more of that barely cooked chewiness), intensely chocolatey (which is surprisingly hard to find in a brownie recipe) and ridiculously easy (1 bowl, 1 spoon and 1 pan, who can complain?)! I add 1 tsp of instant coffee to bring out the chocolate flavour and sprinkle of cinnamon. And when I'm feeling feisty, I add 1/4 tsp (or more but be careful) of cayenne pepper for a little kick. And I always, always sprinkle coarse sea salt over the batter before it goes into the oven. You can do so many things to this recipe to personalize it and make it even more awesome because it's got good bones. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

Step one of my review should read "1) Combine the sugar, cocoa, and salt in a large metal bowl." The butter is not added until it has been melted in step 2. Tried to edit this, but apparently that's not possible. Sorry for any confusion.

Rating: 0
The brownies themselves are very good, but the recipe can be executed much more easily. 1) Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in a large metal bowl. 2) Heat the butter in the microwave until it's just melted. The time will vary with the oven, start with 20 seconds or so. 3) Whip in the melted butter with a whisk. It will not be "smooth", the grains of sugar will still be present, that's fine. 4) Whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Add nuts, if you wish. I add a few grindings of black pepper. 5) Mix in the flour a little at a time with a rubber spatula 6) Pour the batter into a buttered and floured baking pan. You can use the parchment approach instead. 7) Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. The baking time in the recipe is too short. I tried this recipe both ways, the outcome is identical using the above, much more straightforward technique.

Odd. Usually with this many positive reviews, Epi recipes are pretty solid. This is... not. Kinda like less tasty, less pleasantly textured flourless chocolate cake. It's definitely easy - much easier than any other brownie recipe I've made before, fudgy or cakey - but puzzlingy sub-awesome given the reviews. It's eh, OK... but def wouldn't bother making again.

These brownies are amazing. They are so easy to make and nothing like box-type brownies. My co-workers loved them and ate them very quickly. I did not add any nuts to the recipe and I found that they were very rich. However that's a good thing because you can only eat so many.

I always that excellent brownies had to be made with unsweetened chocolate and not cocoa, but no more. I had everything to make brownies but chocolate and didn't want to go to the store because it is 4th of July weekend at the beach. So I tried this recipe and added peanut butter chips. These brownies are decadent and are even better than my go to brownie recipe that I spent my senior year in college perfecting. I think that the key is baking them at a lower temperature - 325 degrees - and taking them out while a little of the batter still sticks to a toothpick. This is now my new go to brownie recipe!

Rating: 4
These are not only the best brownies ever, but they also make a killer base for homemade ice cream bars. I spread the batter out in a jelly roll pan lined with greased foil, baked them for about 8 minutes, cut them in half, spread strawberry ice cream on one half, topped with the other half, cut into bars, and voila! The brownies stayed a nice chewable consistency in the freezer, I suppose because they're made with cocoa rather than baking chocolate.

Rating: 0
These turned out very dry - not fudgy at all. This was probably due to user error (which is why I have refrained from rating). I have a convection oven and baked for 20 minutes, and when I tested with a toothpick there were no crumbs at all, so I clearly overbaked.

Rating: 4
I've made these several times now, they are that good. I cut the butter and sugar down to 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of sugar. Another thing I did was accidentally substitute bread flour for all purpose flour, and that made them even better. I've also done the butter melting part in the microwave on low. Saves time!

I always add a few handfuls of chocolate chips (milk chocolate, if i have them) as i'm putting the batter in the pan.

I had some of these in the freezer and after warming in the microwave i think they were even better.

Just made these brownies last night as I had a craving and wanted to be able to make brownies with only the ingredients I had on hand-Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa powder being one of them. Read through the reviews and laughed out loud when I read InsectGod from DC's review. I followed the directions exactly and wound up with the most amazing rich, fudgey, chocolaty brownies I think I've ever tasted. The only alterations to the recipe were that I used salted butter (that's all I had) and thus omitted the 1/4 tsp salt, and that it took 30 mins of cooking at 325 for the toothpick to come out not covered in uncooked batter. I did not get the crackled crust (unknown why) but otherwise was extremely pleased with the end result. Warning-must have milk on hand for these brownies. If you like cake-like brownies, stay away from this recipe. If you like to make brownies from the box and under-cook them to get fudgey brownies, this is your recipe. You will never make boxed brownies again, this recipe is so easy. Next time I might just microwave the butter rather than do the water bath-you just have to be careful and slowly melt the butter that way so as not to over heat it. The sugar/butter/cocoa mixture doesn't (and won't) be smooth, like others mentioned it will have a "concrete" texture-once you add both eggs however the batter is quite smooth and shiny and holds together as you mix it in the bowl-odd effect but it is exactly the way they should come out.

Rating: 0
I've had this recipe in my recipe box since 12/07 and only just made them. Easy to make, I happened to have had everything on hand, and they are delish. Baking time was longer, perhaps my oven needs to be calibrated. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe and it might even replace my mom's - which is of course perfection!

Have made this recipe a couple of times. I reduced the sugar to one cup (3/4 would be enough for my taste), instead of parchment I spread a piece of butter in the pan, and added rum to the mixture. I do agree with the reviewer below: follow the recipe, stir longer and harder if the consistency is not right. The mixture will smooth out with each added ingredient. It is an easy and forgiving recipe not to mention how fudgy and delicious the brownies are.

Simple steps that will ensure these brownies turn out wonderfully: 1. Follow the directions 2. Be capable of basic mechanical functions like, uh, stirring. 3. DON'T PANIC. Don't try to "fix" anything. Seriously. These are great, fudgy, very rich brownies, but they do look VERY weird at many points during the cooking process. I highly recommend actually using the double boiler. It melts the butter slowly and evenly, and maintains the temperature throughout the mix. Don't just melt everything in the microwave--the texture will suffer because of it. Use the wooden spoon for the vanilla, but you can just stir with a metal fork the rest of the way. The brownies don't suffer for it. After melting the initial ingredients, the mixture will be grainy but somewhat fluffy. If it doesn't taste burned, then it's fine. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T ADD ANYTHING. You don't need to fix this texture, it's fine, it's fine, don't do it. It will look impressively gross when you add the eggs. Just stir really thoroughly until you can't see them anymore, I promise you it will happen. Ultimately, your batter should not be very smooth and liquidy--instead, it will be a very slightly grainy, shiny and chocolatey mass that holds together when stirred. Plop it into the pan as is and smooth it out. The eventual brownies will be thin, yes, but they are very rich and chewy and wouldn't benefit very much from increased thickness. If you like fudgy, unusual, but totally delicious brownies, then give this recipe a try. If you're nervous, don't be like the somewhat entertaining previous review and use your "special cocoa from Italy for Christmas." And for the love of god, don't follow that reviewer's other example and apparently try to feed the "total crap" brownies to the dog. Society will judge you and stuff. Give these a try. They're great. I swear.

Um.. followed the recipe to the T since I've never made cocoa based brownies before. The heated mix turned into a mush that looked like coffee grounds when I beat in eggs and flour... I had to add a few tablespoons of half nd half just to getit to the right consistency. Its in the oven now, will update when they are removed. I am going to top them with peanut butter ganache, so heres hoping that saves it.. I'll be trying a different cocoa based brownie next time

First attempt; just melted the butter and mixed it hot/warm. Used half Splenda for sugar. One egg and a white. Hershey's Dark Chocolate baking cocoa. When it was mixed, it looked like something that might come alive. It turned out to be pretty excellent, but more black than brown on account of the Hershey's.

Great brownies! Although I did make a couple substitutions. Instead of using the full amount of sugar, I used 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar. Made them even more chewy! also I baked them a bit longer about 30-35 minutes. Very rich and delicious. I think next time I'll add some orange zest to the batch

At first I thought it was a total flop. AND I followed the directions exactly. My cocoa, sugar and butter were in this grainy looking mass in the bowl and I thought there was no way these would be good brownies. So I added slightly more MELTED butter and whisked it with beaters. Then I beat the eggs separately and added them to the chocolate slowly. Eventually the texture became what you expect for brownies and then I added the flour. What I learned from this is technique is everything, especially after making it again. Melt the butter, who cares about the double boiler, then dissolve the sugar and add the cocoa. It'll be thicker than you expect, but at least not balled up on your spoon. I doubled the recipe to make a large batch in a 9x13 and sprinkled walnuts on top. I also did not line the pan. Waste of time especially when kids and men are just gonna dig in. They actually rose to twice the height of the batter and are fantastic.

Made this recipe once and almost died from how delicious they were. The tasty brown morsels never stood a chance in this house! Today is a big snow day and what could be more perfect than a chewy gooey perfect brownie? My thoughts for the people that this did not work out for is that you did not beat them enough times. You have to beat them until your arm practically falls off! More later, I have brownies to make!

Rating: 4
Soft and chewy, just as described... It didn't yield 16 large brownies, though--I cut about the equivalent of one large brownie off the sides to make them square, and then cut 6 extra-large brownies. Made sundaes with them--they were the perfect brownie for a sundae!

Not the best brownies but definitely not throwing them out. Nice crust and flavor was chocolatey but not too sweet. Used callebaut cocoa. Texture was more like fudge. It was too much work for what you get in the end and I won't be making these again without tweaking the recipe.

I wish I could give this recipe negative forks. I found this recipe after making a nearly identical recipe that was featured on the cover of the feb '11 bon appetit. After combining all the ingredients in the bowl, there was still a pool of butter on the edges and top of the mixture. When put into an 8x8 pan, it was barely thick enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Came out with a pool of butter on top of the brownies. Completely inedible.

They're my go-to brownie recipe. High-quality cocoa powder (Askinose is what I have) makes them that much better.

Had a sweet tooth this afternoon and knew that I only had ingredients to make cocoa brownies and this recipe was super easy and delicious. One bowl, microwave melting, perfect. Do be careful to monitor your microwave time and make sure you have good cold eggs.

I love these and have experimented with them quite a lot. I had some extra Ghiradelli 100% cacao and melted that with 1/2 cup of the cocoa and then when off the heat, added three tablespoons of thick Greek Yogurt! Talk about fudgy!

With the La Maison du Chocolat cocoa powder and Guittard Akoma extra bittersweet chocolate chips, these brownies were destined to be amazing. I cut them into 25 pieces as anything larger would have been too much (even for the biggest of chocolate lovers.)

Absolutely divine! Some older reviews stated that the brownies had to be thrown away. Seriously? Rotten eggs? Brownie pan/ litterbox confusion? I can't think of many reasons to throw away even mediocre brownies. Even my friends who prefer cakey brownies inhale these. I made the first batch with a mixture of Hershey & Rademaker cocoas (all I had), and they were excellent. Next time, I used Hershey Special Dark cocoa and added Ghirardelli milk choc chips...TO DIE FOR! Quick and easy to make (used microwave as many others recommend), easy cleanup.

I'm beyond disappointed. I'm a fairly adept baker and following this recipe to a T produced substandard results. Or maybe the reviews just hyped me into thinking this would be amazing? I won't be making it again.

I actually joined epicurious today, just to write this review. These brownies were a disappointment. Flavor was good, but the texture and thickness was not. First off - these end up being VERY thin. Second, if cooked at the suggested temperature and time, these come out almost exactly like fudge. They don't resemble any brownie I've ever had. I'm not sure how to "fix' these, but it seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to have a recipe for a brownie that was simple and straightforward. I will NOT make these again.

Rating: 4
these brownies are easily the best brownies I've ever made - they're delicious, easy to make, and best of all, by placing foil in the bottom of the pan, there's little to clean up - which is why I've come back to this recipe time and again. They are very rich, so a little goes a long way. I omit the nuts and sprinkle the top of the batter with m&ms.

Everyone said that these were the perfect brownie and they were as simple to make as a boxed brownie. I highly recommend them!

I double up the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan. I have made these so often now and each time, everyone's taste buds go to chocolate heaven. I do add a pinch of cayenne pepper, a generous amount of vanilla, almond extract, ground sea salt to it and a touch of cinnamon. The other time I ran out of cinnamon, I grounded up two table spoons of chai tea, it turned out really well. I do melt my butter in the microwave oven, it is much faster. Adore this recipe!

I made two batches of these brownies this afternoon. I have never made brownies from scratch and I chose this recipe based on the reviews (that, and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard). My cocoa of choice was a brand called Wondercocoa, a dutch-process type which I found at Bob's Red Mill here in Oregon. For the first batch, I followed the recipe exactly and, yes, my arm ached after beating the butter/sugar/cocoa and the final batter. For the next batch I made the following changes: swapped the all-purpose flour for coconut flour (another Bob's Red Mill product) and microwaved the butter before adding the cocoa and sugars. I also added a pinch of baking soda the second time around. I didn't measure the vanilla either time, I like a vanill-y batter. So the result? Chewy and dense, not so sweet as some complained, nor too chococlat-y. Personally, I don't have a sweet tooth, these were made for my husband and friends. But they are great and I would definately make them again - either way.

LOVE this recipe. Today, since we have leftover chocolate bars from Halloween that even my hubby won't eat (Milky Ways and 3 Musketeers), I chopped the remaining bars into little pieces and stirred them, with walnuts, into this brownie batter. Oh... my... God.... What a way to revive leftover Halloween candy!! I am calling them my Trick-Or-Treat brownies. :))

These brownies were exactly what I'd hoped they'd be: chocolatey and chewy more than cakey . I was surprised at how deep the chocolate flavour was (use the best cocoa you can get your hands on). I tried one version by omitting the nuts and adding 1/4 tsp cayene pepper, a liberal sprinkle of cinnamon and 1 tsp instant coffee for a spicy kick and everyone loved them. Sea salt sprinkled over top worked really well with the chocolate as well. This has become one of my fail safe hostess gifts whenever we're invited for dinner.

These brownies were so delicious, I actually cut down the butter to 1 stick and the sugar to 1 cup, increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and added 1/8 tap baking soda. The first time I tried the recipe it was too sweet and they had a gummy texture, the baking soda gave it a little lift and it had the perfect crusty top.

These are amazing. On the fudgy/chewy side and such good flavor. I did add 1/2 cup or so milk chocolate chips, and I would do it again. I think they might be too intensely dark for me otherwise.

I thought these brownies were delicious. They are more dense than the betty crocker box variety, but absolutely wonderful flavor and texture. I only put in 1 cup of sugar, which was perfect - otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I have made this recipe with Ghiardelli (natural), Droste (Dutch process), and Hershey's Special Dark (mix of natural and Dutch process) cocoa. My family liked the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa best in this recipe. After making as-is a couple of times, I added an 1/8 of a tsp of baking powder to create a little more lift, and I like the slightly chewier texture the baking powder creates. Easy recipe and one the kids can help with. This is a keeper!

I've made these brownies dozens of times, and they've never come out bad. Usually I reduce the butter to 8 tbsp, and the sugar to 1 cup, but this recipe is pretty forgiving-- a little extra something here or too little something there doesn't make a big difference in the finished product. I've made them with varying qualities of cocoa powder, and higher quality, non-dutched cocoa does make these better. They're very dense, rich brownies. This is my go-to brownie recipe.

Really wonderful and rich. And so easy to make. The chocolate flavor was really deep, which is sometimes hard to get with a powdered cocoa. I wouldn't mind them a teeny bit less sweet, but as long as you eat small pieces, it's not overpowering.

Hands down, THE. BEST. brownie recipe I have ever tried (and I've tried a lot). Flawless from start to finish, and I even made these gluten-free with my own special gf flour mixture! These were so rich and tasty with the Hershey's cocoa I used, I can only imagine how orgasmic they'd be with a higher quality cocoa. I also made mine in mini muffin tins (a mini over cream scoop was perfect for this) and I'm glad I did. They came out beautifully (it made about 27 minis) and the size was just enough without being too overwhelmed with the richness. I doubt I will ever use another brownie recipe.

Rating: 4
excellent moist and decadent I reduced the sugar by half a cup, added almond flavouring in addition to vanilla to it and doubled the later. Instead of walnuts I used almonds. I did short cut the recipe, I melted the butter in the microwave oven and from what I can tell they turned out excellent.

These brownies are shockingly rich and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but it could probably do with cutting down the sugar, maybe to 1 cup (and I baked at 350 deg by mistake but didn't seem to hurt them). Did not use nuts as my son is allergic but those would be a good addition. Would be perfect as a party dessert cut into bite size squares since they are so rich.

I love to see how big people's eyes get when they first bite into this brownie. It is simply delicious. They always ask for me to make another batch. I do, like the others here, have to add 10 minutes baking time. And I melt the butter and etc in the microwave. The recipe is perfect as it is but sometimes I'll add some cinnamon or instant expresso to change it up if I want an extra kick. This is staple recipe for me.

I love dark chocolate and rich desserts, but this recipe was simply too bitter and overly complicated for the result. People who tried it thought it needed more sugar. By reducing the amounts to whole amounts 1 stick of butter and 1 cup sugar and by reducing the cocoa to 1/3 cup, I had a delicious and rich brownie without the bitterness. I also increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and omitted the salt. The final result was my perfect brownie and how I will make them from now on. I simplified the preparation by melting the butter in the microwave and then adding the rest of the ingredients in the order listed (and mixing after each addition).

I've never gotten such a deep, amazing chocolate flavor with cocoa before! So sinfully good. Like other reviewers, I needed an extra 5 to 10 minutes, and they were still a little fudgy in the middle. I also added some Guittard milk and white chocolate chunks--chocolate heaven :)

Wonderful and rich - like a chocolate torte. Very dense but not at all dry; moist but not gooey. Not much time or effort for such a decadent homemade treat. They didn't get much of a "crust" though. A little bittersweet for people who prefer milk chocolate, in which case I would recommend adding some milk choc. or white chocolate chips, or serve with ice cream like we did. Oh yeah, we poured a little kahlua over the brownie sundae too!

of the last 4 brownie recipes i've made in the last month, these took the proverbial cake. i made a few changes: added not even a half of 1/4 tsp baking powder, upped the vanilla extract to 1 tsp, substituted 1/3 milk chocolate chips for 1/3 of the walnuts, and per another reviewer's suggestion, sprinkled coarse sea salt on top before baking. delicious!

These are the best brownies I've ever made. Everyone who had them raved about them, and my husband would not stop talking about how they were the best brownies he's ever had in his life. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but instead of using nuts, I scattered some chocolate chips on top and lightly pressed them into the batter. 25 minutes was perfect. I was concerned at first because my batter never was smooth when I was heating and mixing the first 4 ingredients. But as soon as I mixed in the eggs, the batter became smooth and shiny. The end product was soft and chewy, not cake like. Delicious!

Better if you use 2T less butter. I used a non-stick teflon pan and it made it more moist so the butter could be saved, or it turns out too heavy and oily. Needs an extra 5 minutes or so to 30 minute cooking time.

I won't make these again. They have a very dry mouth-feel, and the flavor is bland. The top did have a crustiness as the recipe claimed, but I didn't get any chewiness, despite following the recipe precisely. I'm sorry to say this recipe is not worth the effort.

I was not too crazy about the all cocoa powder recipe. I found the brownies to be pasty. In the future I will stick with the traditional melted chocolate folded into the batter method. The flavor was nice though.

so chocolatey. used trader joe's baking cocoa and it was great. added a tiny bit of instant coffee powder to the mixture on the double broiler and really felt it added something.i definitely had to leave it in the oven longer, and next time would probably bake it at 350 instead of 325. these are fudgey and dense and a chocoholic's dream. next time will use nuts - without it was pretty intense on the chocolate factor. would probably be good with marshmallows pushed in while the dough is still baking.

Richest brownie I've ever baked. I'm a true chocoholic & I've eaten, purchased and baked many brownies, using all types of chocolate. From the 7-Eleven brownies to Chocolatiers. I used normally I use Ghiradelli cocoa or bars. But for this batch I used Valrhona Dutch Processed Cocoa. I do agree with the other reviewers, I added 10-15minutes extra baking time. Be sure to let it cool COMPLETELY before cutting. I didn't feel the need to add the normal chocolate chips or the nuts. I think that the nuts would've helped to break up the richness. I cut out the double broiler method & just melted the butter. I think the recipe just seemed to complicated. Moist & melted right in our mouths.

If you like a dense, chocolate fudge brownie, this is the recipe to try. If you like a cake-like brownie, this is not the recipe for you if that is what you are expecting. Minor changes to the recipe: Salted butter was used as that was what was on hand. You can omit 1/4 salt. I still added 1/8 tsp sea salt to up the flavor. Also added 1 full tsp Vanilla and 1 tsp Coffee to the Butter/Sugar/Cocoa mixture. Used Jumbo Eggs, but picked smallest two from carton. Added Cocoa (Ghirardelli) to mix then Sugar. Tasting the batter after 1 cup of sugar I think it may be possible to cut back to this, but I added the extra 1/4 cup so not to throw off a ratio when baking. NOTE 1: The Butter, Sugar, Cocoa mixture will NEVER be smooth regardless of heat because there is not enough moisture to dissolve the sugar completely. Sugar will dissolve and batter will be smooth when eggs are added. NOTE 2: I sifted the Cocoa and Flour through a mesh strainer. Cocoa can tend to clump if it is open for some time. I think this helps keep lumps out of batter. NOTE 3: I whisked eggs briefly before adding the batter. NOTE 4: I have an 8x8 corningware pan. This batter makes a dense, 1 inch tall brownie in this pan. A large pan will affect the thickness and thus cooking time of the brownie. If you only have a 9x13, I suggest you double the recipe and you may have to adjust your cooking time. NOTE 5: I have a new oven which has an accurate temperature. These Brownies were done after 25 minutes. I let the brownies rest for 30 minutes in the pan then cool another 30 out of the pan before cutting. Brownies were still warm. They set up more fudge-like (less soft) by the next day.

I just made these, and I was pleasantly surprised, I must say. They taste like dark chocolate brownies in a subtle way. I, too, microwaved the buter, sugar, cocoa and salt, but otherwise, followed the directions, and baked them for 25 mins. However, I used my normal brownie pan that is 9X13, but I recommend using something smaller as the brownies were thinner than I prefer, which may increase baking time a bit. They're fantastic and easy, and completely not what I expected, given I read a lot of the reviews. I recommend giving it a run. Hubby loved it too!

I'll admit, I was skeptical too when I first took these out of the oven... they were more pudding-y than I normally want brownies to be. But I chilled the rest of the batch, and, once cold (which I prefer anyway) - best ever. Truly.

I made a few changes to make them a little more low-fat (and also based on what I had on hand) 1) substituted half the butter with nonfat vanilla Greek-strained yogurt--1/4 c yogurt 2) used bakers choc. instead of cocoa powder (which knocked out the other half of the butter called for--1 oz. bakers choc to every 3 tbsp cocoa powder, and minus 1 tbsp butter for every oz. bakers choc. when substituting, since bakers choc. includes oil) 3) almond extract instead of vanilla 4) 1/2 c brown sugar, 3/4 c white sugar they still came out fabulous!

These are excellent brownies, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the prep is unnecessarily fussy. Here's what I did: I melted the butter in a large glass bowl in the microwave and then used my electric hand mixer to blend in everything else. I then slapped the batter into a buttered foil-lined 8 inch square pan and baked it for 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Results? FABULOUS! Chewy, moist and with a deep chocolate/cocoa flavor. Would I make these again? Heck yeah! I'm just not going to bother with the whole simmering-over-water business or mixing by hand with a wooden spoon for eleventy million strokes.

These were so easy to make. The firat time I tried the double boiler method, and I thought my arm would fall off, so the last time I took the advice of fellow reviewers and used the microwave. SO MUCH EASIER! These brownies are fantastic. They do need to be baked longer, 40 minutes for a double batch, and you HAVE to let them cool completely before cutting, but then... YUMMY! I sprinkled mine with coarse sea salt before baking, and the dark chocolatey/fudgey taste with that touch of salty crunch is sinful. I have to make another batch, the second one is almost gone.

I love these brownies, and my kids do, too. Because they are young cooks, I am trying to teach them that making things from scratch is almost as easy and eminently more satisfying than using a mix. This recipe is a great lesson in exactly that. We like to add good stuff like butterscotch chips, dried cranberries, or dried cherries to doctor them up. The recipe also doubles and triples well - we just made a huge batch to add to our holiday cookie tins.

These brownies are the easiset ever to make and the best taste and consistency. I can have a batch in the oven in 10 minutes. I don't bother with the simmering over water - just put the butter, cocoa, salt and sugar in a glass bowl and microwave on medium high for about 1.5 minutes. Once the butter is melted I stir like crazy and after the vanilla and each of the eggs. At first it looks like it will never come together but after the eggs it magically does. Brought these to a basketball tournament and every parent asked for the recipe. They are very grown up brownies with a dark chocolate flavour but the kids love them too!

Ouch, eating 2 of these brownies gave me a bellyache. I don't know what went wrong with mine, but I ended up with extremely greasy brownies -- the parchment paper that I baked on was soaked in butterfat after taking them out of the oven, and they continued to leak grease onto a paper-towel as I let them cool. I may try this recipe again, but I'll be adding another 1/2 cup of flour.

These were very good, soft and "fudge-like". It is a long process to make them, and I have had almost as good results with "one-bowl" type brownies, which are much faster to make.

After baking many different brownies, these are definitely the best so far. I'm not a big believer in using good quality chocolate for brownies so discovering an exceptional cocoa brownie is what I'm after. This is probably close to it. Although I did increase the cocoa to 1 cup and the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. Using the microwave for melting is perfectly fine. The brownies are dense, bittersweet, chewy. Not cakey. I did have to use some brown sugar with the white as I didn't quite have enough and it seemed fine. In future, I may experiment with baking soda to give the brownies a bit of lift and may increase the sugar slightly. But this is my new basic brownie recipe that I will make again and again!

I have made these brownies many times since the recipe appeared on Epicurious. It's a godsend for those of us who live far away from sources for unsweetened chocolate, and the brownies are AMAZING whether made with expensive cocoa or with home- brand cocoa. Over time I have modified the process slightly by melting the butter with the cocoa only until smooth and quite hot then mixing in the sugar and proceeding with the rest of the recipe. This makes it easier to get a smooth mixture. I do get different results depending on how hot the mixture is when the eggs are beaten in - hotter the mixture the higher the brownies seem to rise and the chewier they are. Could this be like the reaction in choux paste? For some reason I also seem to have more consistent results when I make a double batch and bake in 13x9 pan. For those working in metric: 150 grams of butter, 280 grams of sugar and 60 grams of cocoa. Oven temp 160 celsius.

Oh WOW! I actually took one reviewers advice and sprinkled coarse sea salt on top right before I put the brownies in the oven. These are by far, the best brownies I have ever tasted!!

This was by far the easiest brownie receipe that I've ever made. I used No-Name brand cocao and they still turned out fantastic, so I could only imagine they'd be much better with a premium brand of cocao. Like another poster suggested, I swirled some melted peanut butter through the batter before it went in the oven, and that added a little extra dimension. I too had to cook them for an additional 10 mins in a glass pan, but the edges were not overdone at exactly 35mins. I also used the microwave instead of the double boiler method...much simpler! I ended up slicing them into 9 squares to serve with some vanilla frozen yogurt and chocolate drizzle. Very easy dessert that you can whip up in less than 45 mins with ingredients most people have on hand. Will be my go-to brownie receipe!

I was very disappointed as I was hoping for a fudge brownie but these are dry and I followed the recipe to a "T"! The batter never got smooth. Theres a good taste to them but not fantastic. has the same results as another poster, the pan yielded brownies that were 1 inch thick more or less and I only baked them for 13 minutes as my oven tends to run hotter. I will try them again but try to add something to get a fudge center like I want.

I've tried to make brownies before and failed miserably. But making these with Dutch-process cocoa powder made the best brownies I've ever tasted. I did have to cook them a little bit longer.

I had a lot of mint in the garden so took one cup of the sugar and made a simple syrup with 2 big handfuls of mint simmered in it. Then followed this recipe and had great mint-chocolate brownies. A great treat to welcome my daughter home from working at a camp all summer!

Undoubtly THE BEST fudge-like brownie recipe I have ever used. I will never use a box mix again.

I use epicurious a lot but had to become a member just now for the sole purpose of reviewing this recipe. Three words that may change your life: coarse sea salt. I sprinkled large coarse crystals of sea salt on top of the batter prior to baking. This could also probably be done right when they come out of the oven. Words cannot describe how delicious they are. My boyfriend and I are both currently intoxicated with these brownies.

By far the best brownies on the planet. Dense, not at all cake like. And rich. and intense. Will make them again and again.

Happy to find a brownie recipe that called for cocoa powder (I used Valhrona) & encouraged by the reviews here, I had to LOL upon reading the recommended prep. I mean, COME ON! That said, I sprayed my baking pan with Pam & softened my room-temp butter in the micro, then stirred in the other ingredients. Oh & I didn't count my "strokes" either. My brownies came out tasting just as delicious than if I had stood on my head or jumped up & down on one leg to make them! My only other issue with this recipe is that baking time (conventional thermal oven) took at least 10 - 15 mins longer than recommended. Final result was a nicely fudgy brownie. And a "candylike top crust"? No, but who cares! Please pass the milk ...

Rating: 4
Will definitely make these again. I agree with another reviewer - the 'crackly' crust really only appeared when the brownies were cut but it did appear a bit, and the brownies were fantastically chewy and chocolatey. Baked for 20 minutes at 160 degrees Centrigrade (the equivalent of the Farenheit temperature listed in the reipce) in a fan oven. Spot on. I had run out of real unsalted butter so I used half 'slightly salted 'spreadable'' butter* (and reduced the salt) and I only had supermarket 'own brand' cocoa, but the brownies were still excellent. I look forward to making them with all real butter and better quality chocolate, but I'm thrilled to find a good chocolatey recipe I can make from a couple of eggs and not much else: Actual chocolate doesn't stay in my storecupboard for long ;-) * in the UK we have 'spreadable' butter which comes in containers like margarine and is butter with a little bit of added oil to make it easy to spread straight from the fridge. The brand I buy is slightly salted.

I really wasn't impressed with these brownies. They were more or less a let-down. The "candylike top crust" wasn't really a crust at all, and only got "crackly" where the knife cut through the brownie. The interior was somewhat like a dry-ish cake. It rose to a disappointing height of approximately 1.5 inches.

Chewy, moist and yummy. The cocoa power delivers in this recipe with a rich chocolate flavor, while the butter adds a richness only butter can do. I baked these brownies in a rectangular Pyrex 2 quart glass dish lined with parchment for approximately 37 minutes.

I've been looking for a good cocoa brownie recipe like the one I had as a teenager. I have found it. These brownies are fantastic, with the perfect texture. Not like "cake brownies" whic are inevitably too dry. I doubled for a large pan and cooked in a fan oven - the timing was perfect. I drizzled melted choc over for my son's birthday ring and they were a huge hit.

These are, hands down, the best brownies I've ever made. The only change I made was that I substituted the sugar for a sugar substitute as I was trying this recipe out for a diabetic. I have to say that this is the perfect diabetic chocolate treat because it's made with cocoa and no chocolate (if you use the sugar substitute). I didn't get the candylike top, which was fine, but they were so rich and moist- needless to say, they're all gone!

Rating: 3
I baked these for 50 minutes in a faberware baking pan, no AL liner, just butter. The texture was exactly what I was looking for: fudgey-chewy. It's the flavor of these that knocks a fork off my rating. Perhaps it's the cocoa I used, Hersheys rather than the "best I could find." They're a little too bitter. Next time, I'll throw in chocolate chips. I think then I will have reached the end of my quest for my perfect brownie.

yummy! hubbs is a loves brownies above all else. this is the first time i've made brownies from scratch and they are really good. much better than any box. i didn't do all the complicated stuff - just melted the butter on defrost in the microwave and did all the mixing in my kitchen aide. no big deal. easy and yummy! did take much more than 25 minutes to cook - maybe 45.

Very satisfying brownies! My first made-to-scratch brownies. Fudgy, not-too sweet, very cocoa-ey. I substituted butter with 1/2 cup + 2 tblsp EVOO, and used 1/2 cup + 2 tblsp brown sugar instead. I ran out of vanilla extract so I used almond extract, and added 3/4 cup of mix of almond and walnuts.

I don't have much of a sweet tooth (thank Google for that saving grace!), but had a serious chocolate snack attack today, so I came here to see what I could rustle up with the few ingredients I had. Other than a sub of cake flour for the all-purpose, a 1/4 c of brown sugar to make the amount needed, and 1 oz Ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate (because I had it), I changed nothing. Eating now. Totally satisfying!

Oh, YUM. This is exactly the recipe I've been looking for. They were so moist, it was hard to cut them - but that's hardly a complaint. These are great for rolling up into little brownie balls and dropping them on top of a bowl of ice cream. I had to leave them in for about 10-15 minutes longer than the suggested time (20-25). And like many other people, I just melted the butter/sugar/cocoa in the microwave.

Powerful chocolate flavor which I love!! I agree with other reviewers who said to skip the step of heating the cocoa, sugar and butter together. Just melt the butter in a pan {my microwave makes the butter explode} Then mix the butter with the ingredients. they turned out Moist in the middle crisp around edges like I like them! fast and easy to make because don't have to melt any chocolate. They are soo chocolatey and I love having the option of using cocoa if I am out of baking bars!! A keeper recipie, I am making it again today for the Hubby!

Alright, here's how it goes. To start with, I'm fourteen. I know, I know, teenagers aren't exactly appreciative of tastes as you illustrious adults, but we can be gastronomes if we want. The water step was something I have never done before, but hey, if a fourteen-year-old pulled it off, why can't you? I admit that the batter was disjointed and the cocoa powder was overpowering, but after I mixed in the eggs, using my plain teenage stupidity, I added a shot of Hershey's chocolate syrup. It filled in the holes left between the flavor and helped the batter liquify slightly more. The only issue I had was getting it from the bowl to the pan--gooey stuff! Anyway, they turned out great and as promised, perhaps a bit more with my dumb addition. If all else fails, use it I guess. No culinary jack-assery as far as I could see.

I made the recipe as written and they came out tasting like mushy brownie batter. At 25 minutes, the batter was still runny, so cooked them an extra 10 minutes. They firmed up a bit once they cooled, but they still tasted like brownie batter, not brownies. You could even taste the powder texture of the cocoa. I don't think I did anything wrong. I rated it 2 forks instead of 1 because my husband ate them anyway. I'm going back to box brownies.

I made this recipe yesterday and they are the best brownies I've had, easy in my opinion to make, heating the ingredients in the bowl over water was not hard to do like others have said.

Texture of the brownie is great but the taste is absolutely overpowered by cocoa. The mix of flavors is very uneven; it completely lacks any subtlety and there is no undertone/overtone, just one flat flavor of cocoa powder. I hadn't actually ever met a brownie I didn't like until this one.

I would use the ingredients for this recipe again, but the preparation is ridiculous. Using a double-boiler when all that needs to be done is melt the butter, which is a job perfect for a microwave, is silly at best. It's pure culinary jack-assery at the worst. There is virtually no return on the time you invest by doing all the superfluous steps listed.

Superb brownies. Followed the recipe exactly as written (left out the nuts). Baked for 25 minutes. Brownies are flavorful and chewy.

These were good, and certainly quick and easy, but I think I prefer the flavor of brownies (and chocolate cake) made with chocolate rather than just cocoa. Also, these brownies were soft and cakey throughout, with no "chewy candylike top crust" at all, though I followed the directions exactly.

Fantastic recipe. I made this per the directions but omitted the nuts and added one can of Oregon Fruit Tart Cherries (drained and mashed in a sieve to remove as much liquid as possible).

This recipe was great. I was snowed in and wanted to make brownies but only had cocoa powder, no chocolate chips. This recipe was simple and I didn't even need to go to the store! The ingredients are common things you probably have in your cupboard. I read in another review to be careful about overcooking them and, since my oven is old and inconsistent, I lowered the cook time to 17 min. They looked a bit underdone but but I took them out in lieu of overdoing it. Once they set up they were perfect and even better the next day. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it worked like a charm! Make these brownies!

I use this recipe to make brownie pops. I pour the batter into individual heart shape molds after spraying the molds with cooking spray. I only cook the brownies 23 minutes and then wait until they firm up a little before removing them from the molds. (Though my son takes a gooey, hot brownie and tops it with vanilla ice cream. It tastes like a molten chocolate cake.) This recipe is easy, better and cheaper then a good mix, and the brownies always disappear in a hurry.

I should have mentioned- these brownies turned out absolutely fantastic, but I did make one small change. I was too lazy to make a dutch oven. Instead, I put the first four ingredients in the microwave for about a minute and a half. Other than that, I followed the recipe with GREAT results.

These are great brownies! Here's a hint--if you cut down on the butter/sugar, the browniew will be dry, because butter and sugar add moisture. So don't complain about the recipe being dry if you changed the recipe to make it drier. Check your oven temp too; if it's high the brownies will overbake and be dry. Home ovens often vary quite a bit from the marked temperature.

I made it exactly as written. I found it to be a very easy with good instructions. I used wax paper too which was so much easier than greasing the pan. I used very high quality cocoa so my brownies came out very rich with a strong fruity cocoa taste and not too sweet. I cut them into tiny squares as I find that just a bite is perfect for a party. The top was a bit crunchy but not too and inside was very soft but not too cakey. I will be making this one again.

These are the best homemade brownies that I can remember making. I've tried other recipes that use cocoa, but they always were a bit disappointing. These were very rich, fudgy, and chocolaty. I am a big fan of chocolate chips in brownies and I can honestly say that these did not need any chocolate chips! I made the recipe as written with the walnuts. The only change that I made was to melt the butter in a saucepan, then mix in the sugar, then mix in the cocoa. I then took it off the heat and added the other ingredients. I cooked them for just over 20 minutes in a convection toaster oven. A few hours after I made them, I tried one and I was afraid I might have undercooked them a bit. However, the next day they are perfect. Honestly, I think that I have always had a tendency to overcook brownies in the past because I couldn't bring myself to take them out of the oven while the middle was still wet. Now I can see the difference! My fiance ate two of them last night and he claims to not like either brownies or chocolate. I used Ghirardelli cocoa and it seemed to be fine. I'll make these again.

I used 1 cup of agave syrup instead of sugar and it turned out to be a nice bittersweet flavor. I'm not sure if it was the agave or the humidity (I live in Hawaii) but mine didn't get a crust on top and it wasn't chewy. The texture was more like fudge and it melts in your mouth. As far as flavor, this is the best recipe--as long as you don't like overly sugary sweet things and prefer 'pure' chocolatey-ness. I'll definitely make these again but I'd experiment with substituting white flour for something else to make it 'healthier' and less processed.

Rating: 1
ehhhh...not what I expected. Fudgy, but not like the tradiontal brownie I was after. The crust was not there either -which is my FAVE part. Dense and kind of flat on flavor. Also, hated the parchment idea. It still stuck, and was a pain - think spreading silly putty flat onto a piece of paper. Next time I will grease/flour and hope for the best. More work than I expected, although still easy. Used the 1 cup butter/sugar modifications since that seems to be the "norm" for this recipe, so maybe that made a difference.

These were pretty good. Definitely chocolatey! I also didn't have an 8" pan so i used a little more rectangular one. I had better luck on this recipe than the boxed kind. The only thing I can't seem to get around is how to make the edges not be so tough. Any ideas?

I used just 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of sugar like other reviewers recommended and they turned out wonderful. i'm making them again today for a Christmas eve party and plan on adding crushed candy canes to the top after I take them out of the oven...the dark chocolately flavor of these will go great with mint, I think.

after 8 batches of these that were given out to friends, and 2 more for my family, I can say that YES these are the best cocoa brownies! Haven't made brownies with cocoa in a while--now this is my only brownie recipe. such an easy one. I used the microwave and cut butter and sugar by 1/4 cup.

Rating: 3
This recipe deserves 4 forks for practicality, since the ingredients are so standard, but I'm not sure I would prefer them over ones made with actual chocolate. I doubled the recipe, cut the sugar down to 1 cup (x2) as asuggested, and baked in a 9" X 13" Pyrex casserole dish for 35 minutes. I used plain ol' Hershey's cocoa, and they came out delicious. I had a craving for chocolate and didn't have any actual chocolate on hand, so I made these. Did the trick! The flavor is very bittersweet, and the consistency is dense and moist, with a flaky top layer, like boxed brownies. I think that many people are saying it is too sweet because the cocoa has an inherent flavor that is not necessarily sweet, but hits the sweet taste buds similar to sweetness/sugar. Part of the "tangyness" perhaps is an intense flavor that is bitter and sweet at the same time. I am somewhat sensitive to sugar and I thought 1 cup per recipe is a good amount. I wouldn't use any less. This brownie recipe is a good candidate for a marble or frosted variety. Also, someone mentioned adding bacon, and I agree! I have had gourmet bacon chocolate, which you have to taste to believe, and this recipe might very well be delicious with crispy bacon mixed in.

Rating: 4
Easy and doesn't require you to have baking chocolate on hand, like most brownie recipes. I've made this twice; the first time, I used the hot water bath as recommended. This time, I used the microwave. I thought the microwave was actually more work and took longer because i had to keep stopping it, pulling it out, looking at it and stirring, instead of just standing by a pot stirring. So I think in the future I'll just do it as written instead of microwave. I also cut down on butter and sugar this time, as others mentioned, and I used gluten-free flour. They still turned out really good!

These are the best brownies I've ever had. Simple, great consistency. Since they are so simple, you can really trick them out with some high-end cocoa powder and taste the complexity. I followed others and only did 1 stick butter, 1 cp sugar and melted in the microwave vs all the complex stirring instructions. Add bacon! I know people will think I'm crazy, but I had some of that Voigners (sp?) Haute Chocolate that had bacon in it, and it was really good. So I wanted to try bacon in a good brownie recipe. Honestly, it was really, really good. I crisped up the bacon, patted it off and let it cool. Then poured in half of the brownie batter, laid on the 5 strips of bacon, and covered them with the rest of the batter. The saltiness of the bacon really added a nice touch to the chocolate. If you are at all inclined, try it!

I was sceptical of this recipe because of the large amount of cocoa when many other recipes call for just a couple or so tablespoons, but they are usually not chocolatey enough and are too sugary. I wondered if it was a joke and would turn out to be a black bitter brick but I decided to try it and was amazed at how delicious they were. My family loves them and devoured them before they could cool all the way. I made them two days in a row and the second time didn't have all the ingredients so used: 1 c sugar, 1 stick butter only 1 egg and 2 tbsp. water and 2/3 c cocoa. This recipe is pretty much fool proof, it turned out delicious both times and is our very favorite brownie recipe bar none. Fudgy and fantastic. The Absolute Best Brownies!

Very good and very rich. I substituted chocolate chunks instead of nuts. The kids enjoyed them.

Wow. Even I couldn't screw this up. Although I did reduce the sugar to one cup and the butter to one stick. Also - I didn't do the whole double-boiler thing either. I melted the butter in the microwave, added the eggs and the vanilla with it. I mixed all the dry ingredients in another bowl, then combined the two. The brownies were amazing - not gritty, perfectly sweet and chocolatey. I'll never use a boxed mix again! Thank you!

This is a terrific brownie recipe. I melted the butter with sugar and cocoa powder over low heat until it was shiny, took it off the heat and whisked the eggs into the pot. I then whisked in the vanilla,flour and something i can't stay away from when making brownies, espresso powder. Such easy cleanup! The brownies are moist and have a shiny top crust, just as promised. I was afraid that the batter wouldn't make it to the pan because my brother, who happens to be a total health freak, could not stop eating it. This one is being added to my recipe binder, for sure!

This was a very forgiving recipe. We were lazy, confused and lacking all the correct ingredients and the brownies still turned out great. They were moist and chewy without being oily, and they had a thin, crisp top. Here is where we diverted from the instructions: 1) We used self-rising flour rather than all- purpose flour. 2) We only put in 80g of butter which is about 5 and half tablespoons. 3) We microwaved the butter and then just mixed it all up in the same bowl. When we spooned the batter into our greased, unlined tin it was grainy. We cooked the brownies for 24 minutes in a fan oven at 180 celcius and they were perfect! I won't bother adding the correct amount of butter in the future. Why bother? Save money and calories, you'll never notice the difference!

These are the most amazing brownies plus the are super quick and easy to make! They are chewy with that awesome crispy top!

Rating: 3
Great taste but author really made much harder to make than necessary. I melted butter in microwave, added sugar, cocoa, and salt, stirred, added vanilla and eggs, beating after each egg with spoon, added dry ingredients and baked in a glass pan at 325 for 40 minutes. They were awesome and much easier than author's steps.

Very good and fast. I didn't bother with the double boiler, just melted everything together over low heat. I also used Hershey's cocoa and substituted chocolate and peanut butter chips for the nuts. Fudgy brownies.

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing. i've made dozens and if you follow the directions exactly, they come out chewy with a nice crust. Only use High grade dutch cocoa and the "sweetness" everyone comments on will be changed. i think the darkness of great cocoa cuts the sweetness.

Rating: 4
Considering nothing in this recipe is difficult to get or expensive(unless you buy expensive cocoa) these are great. I made them for the first time in Tanzania, as cocoa was much easier to find and cheaper than chocolate bars of good quality. I find they double well and work well with Hersheys cocoa or fancy stuff!

Rating: 0
Very interesting! I haven't had one at room temp yet (who can wait?), but these have an interesting flavor. I used only 1 cup of sugar, so there's more of a cocoa flavor. Kind of a dark chocolate tang, that would be nice with accompaniments. Not your mother's after school brownie, that's for sure!

Rating: 4
This is by far my favorite brownie recipe because it's easy to keep the ingredients on hand. They are super rich and taste like a brownie should. I too double the recipe and cut about 1/2 cup sugar for a double batch and they turn out beautifully. Be sure to melt the ingredients together very slowly without letting it get overly hot to ensure a perfectly smooth batter. Be patient and don't add the eggs too soon either.

Rating: 0
My batter turned out very lumpy and gritty when it should have been "smooth." I believe it was because my butter was cold, but I assumed the step where you heat it would make that a moot point. Unfortunately it did not. I'd recommend melting the butter, then adding the cocoa, then adding the sugar, etc. and following the rest of the recipe as stated. To be honest, once I had to throw that out, I moved on to a different recipe.

Rating: 3
I'm a bit surprised by the reviews that say these brownies were too sweet . . . I'd actually say the opposite. Not that they weren't delicious -- they're very good -- but I thought they were a bit more on the bittersweet side, and definitely benefited from the scoop of vanilla ice cream I served on top. I used non-dutch processed cocoa . . . maybe that made the difference? I think I might play around with some of the other recipes on the site to see if I find one I like even more, but this is definitely one I'll come back to.

Yesssss! What I was wishing for before I made them. A little less sugar makes for a good treat with ice cream and coffee.

Amazing that the previous reviewer was disappointed. These browmies were fabulous. I will not ever try another brownie recipe. I used Droste cocoa and that may have been part of my success. I also used slightly less sugar than called for. Next time I'll double the recipe.

Rating: 0
This was an extremely disappointing recipe and little better than your average boxed brownie. Too much sugar resulted in a brownie that was tough and so overly sweet that you can barely make out the taste of chocolate. If you want a really good brownie, don't waste your time with this recipe and try Alton Brown's cocoa powder brownie recipe.

This is my family's favorite brownie recipe, but it makes a small amount so I double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan instead.

Rating: 2
I reduced the sugar from 1 1/4 to less than 1 cup, and yet this was toothachingly sweet. Perhaps with a stronger, more gourmet cocoa the sweetness will be cut (I used hershey's regular cocoa), but as is, and without nuts, this seemed way too sweet to me. They are certainly better than the boxed brownie mixes, but if I were to make these again I'd probably cut the sugar down to less than half of what's called for here.

This is the perfect brownie recipe. I have had a string of failures over the years until I found this recipe. You can't go wrong!

I made this for a school fundraiser with couple of small modifications. I made a triple batch and added one cup each of toffee, caramel, and chocolate chips. Never having made the recipe before, I made a small test brownie. It was so good my husband and I fought over it and had to immediately wrap the large batch to keep ourselves from eating them all before the fundraiser.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good. The first time I made it I needed to cook it a little longer, but that's probably just my oven. The second time I made it, I veganized it. I used Ener-G egg replacer and Earth Balance and it was just as good!

I was hesitant to try this since I have been used to buying package brownies from the store since I was a child. I had never tried baking home made ones before. So, one day I had the ingredients and a another bad experience with bag brownies. I tried this recipe and was astounded at how good these really are! I just melted my no salt added butter in the microwave instead of doing the double boiler. It worked perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe. I have already made another batch and they are in the oven as I type this! :P UUMMM....

I'm another brownie fanatic and these are amazing! I've been making these for months and they're always gone within hours. They're nice and moist, not dry and cakey. Perfect cocoa brownies!

Rating: 3
I'm a brownie fanatic, and I love this recipe. So simple! I took the suggestion to melt the butter first, then add the sugar, then the cocoa. Other than that, I prepared as directed, then spooned into mini muffin pans. The baking time ended up being 22 minutes, but that's probably because I was paranoid about them over-cooking and kept opening my oven to check on them... Can't wait to take these to work tonight. I will never buy brownie mix again!

Rating: 4
I find lining pans rather fussy so I just greased the pan and dusted it with breadcrumbs. I had no problems getting the finished brownies out. I cut down on the sugar, only 1 c and although the brownies tasted good, they were a bit dry so I will cut down on baking time in the future. In spite of all that, my guinea pigs were very happy with the result. ;-)

This is my Brownie recipe that I will use for the rest of my life. And thanks so much to Savia from San Francisco - it takes FOREVER for the chocolate mixture to get "hot enough so you can only keep you finger there for a second" or whatever. Actually I wouldn't really know because I never waited that long. Even still, I love these brownies so I can't wait to make them by melting the butter (def in the microwave).

Rating: 4
I cheated and these were still fan-freakin'-tastic. I can hear the harpies now, but since I didn't have a double boiler, I microwaved the butter, added the sugar, microwaved some more, then added cocoa and microwaved again. A dangerous recipe since I always have these ingredients on hand...

Rating: 4
Wow! I was really skeptical about the unusual preparation technique. We used a really nice Valrhona cocoa powder and added 3 more tablespoons of cocoa but kept everything the same. Next time I think we will try increasing the butter by a tablespoon or two.

Rating: 4
Really really good. I did try the suggestion that up to 3/4 of the sugar could be substituted with apple sauce to make the recipe slightly healthier - GROSS RESULTS!!! had to throw it away. Make the recipe as is and you'll be happy if you like a really dense and moist brownie.

They also work out well with a little less sugar and a little more cocoa (I like 'em a bit "darker").

These are quick, easy and delicious. There really is never a need to buy a brownie mix again when you have this little recipe at your fingertips. My only gripe with the recipe is that if you follow the directions exactly, you won't get the crunchy candy "crust" that makes these brownies extra special. To get that, you must melt the butter first, then melt the sugar into it, and THEN add the cocoa powder. If you mix them together all at once, it will take forever (comparatively) to melt the butter and heat all the ingredients to the appropriate temperature, and you will never get the delicious, smooth consistency you're looking for. Or the candy coating. I love this recipe so much, I'm using it to make brownies as little holiday gifts - everyone wants these brownies for Christmas!

Rating: 4
Agreed with all of the reviewers. This is an excellent brownie recipe. I was wondering if they would be good because the recipe seemed kind of unconventional. I followed everything exactly as instructed and they came out perfect. I sprinkled pecans before baking and drizzled caramel after to make them like turtle brownies. Next time I might double up on the recipe to make them thicker but thin is good in it's own way. My new brownie recipe for sure. So quick and easy to make!

Rating: 4
The brownies are exceptional... but be sure to grease your foil or just bake them in a greased pan. Mine stuck horribly to the foil. Also, b/c I was making a triple batch, my butter never seemed to melt, so I melted it in the microwave and then stirred the mixture over the simmering water.

After trying a dozen or so different brownie recipes, this is the keeper. I have made these at least 4 times during the last month for my kids and their friends who come over to play. Everyone loves them. P.S. the kids love to see the cocoa & butter mixture turn into a chocolately sauce.

It seems when these brownies are removed from the oven like one might have a disaster on her hands, but they set up just great when they cool off and they're delicious! I used the microwave method and it worked well. I did experience the curdled look some other reviewers spoke of, then added eggs and all was well. Needed a full 25 minutes baking time in my oven. Super easy, fudgy, rich and tasty. My search for a good brownie recipe stops here.

I searched forever to find the perfect chewy brownie, and I'm searching no more! My kitchen smells like heaven when I bake these, and every time I do, folks tell me they're the best brownies they've ever eaten. I triple the recipe and bake in a jelly roll pan (so I can have plenty to pass out to friends and family). Yum!

I've already rated this recipe (a solid four forks, because...wow) but in quick response to a cook wondering whether this recipe can be increased, i just wanted to write that I almost always make a double batch, baking it in a 9" x 13" pan for about 25 - 35 minutes (it varies- I have a wonky oven!). Doubled, the recipe produces exactly the same fudgy, addictive brownies- but in bigger bounty. Perfect for bakesales or buying the affection of larger crowds. ;-P

Rating: 4
Simply perfect. After the first time I made these, my friends already started calling them my "famous brownies." Brownies are a comforting, rustic dessert, and I see nothing wrong with using plain old Hershey's cocoa for my weekly batch. But, for special occasions, fancy cocoa turns these into a really gourmet treat.

Rating: 4
This is the perfect brownie recipe. I've made it twice, with fabulous results both times. Both times I used walnuts and (this may be blasphemy), plain ol' Hershey's cocoa. Not as complexly flavored as a better cocoa would have made it, but chocolately delicious and a perfect fix for cravings nonetheless. Both times I also microwaved the cocoa-butter-sugar-salt-mix instead of cooking it on the stovetop. I admit, I was lazy. :) And it was absolutely delicious, despite my skimping. All of my guests asked for seconds. I served it with vanilla ice cream. I also covered it with a thin layer of chocolate frosting that I was trying to use up. It was perfection. I found that it was quite undercooked-looking when I took it out of the overn, but it requires this so it does not dry out. It dries out on the rack and gets a little firmer like almost any cookie.

I just thought all brownies were made with cocoa powder, so I was surprised to see that most of them were using solid chocolate. Glad I found this! I used Pernigotti cocoa and they turned out fab.

Will definitely make again and plan to make a batch for a thank-you to give to a friend. YUM!

This is a great brownie recipe. Had to cook them a bit longer than the recipe recommends but the outcome was excellent. Great top crust, excellent chocolate flavor, easy to make with ingredients usually in the cupboard anyway. They freeze well. Eat them straight from the freezer or pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds and serve with a little vanilla ice cream.

These were good, easy brownies, and perfect for when you need chocolate but only have cocoa powder. The texture was great, very fudgy, but I had to bake them 35-40 minutes total. They were moist, but not unpleasantly gooey like some other reviews seemed to think. I used Dutch-process cocoa, and I melted the butter mixture in a small saucepan over very low heat, then moved it to the stand mixer to beat in the eggs and flour. I also used jumbo eggs, since that's what I had, and they worked just fine. The cocoa flavour is excellent, very deep, and I didn't find these too sweet at all. However, this candy crust mentioned in the description didn't happen. But I didn't miss it.

Excellent. Melted chocolate & butter in microwave and used a good dutch process cocoa. Can't wait to make these with rice flour modification (thanks, cook from Brooklyn!) for my gluten-free friends.

I'm in accordance with the other reviewers who found these brownies slightly unworkable when direct from the oven. Instead of baking longer, I pulled them as directed and set them aside for a day. These are definitely day-later or maybe two-days-later brownies. They were killer after that (moist, rich, crunchy top), especially when iced with a bittersweet chocolate ganache. I will make these again, but will not plan on eating them immediately.

I'm so glad I made this despite the mixed reviews. It was awesome. The brownies are extremely chewy and fudgy and were so easy since I had everything on hand. They definitely tasted better the next day, but then again so does almost anything made with chocolate. I will be making these very often. Thank you.

These brownies were fantastic. I substituted turbinado sugar because it cuts the sweetness. I also skipped the double boiler and just melted the sugar/butter mixture over a low flame. They made a van full of exhausted foodies (my boyfriend's band) very happy when they got to stop in SF.

These are the grossest brownies I've ever tasted; compared to these, even gas station or vending machine brownies would seem Gourmet. "Fudgy" is a bit of a misnomer, "nearly raw" would be more accurate. I like brownies to be crusty and chewy, which these are supposed to be because of all the butter and granulated sugar, but they turned out just sugary-soupy, despite using a larger than called for pan. I cooked them 25 minutes at 325 and the toothpick came out clean, but the texture is just terrible. Serious disappointment. They are back in the oven now in hopes that they can be salvaged, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

Terrific fudgy brownies and I love the fact that they contain only ingredients that I always have on hand. I deviated from the recipe just a bit by adding 1 cup of chocolate chips with the walnuts. These beg to be covered in rich vanilla ice cream!

Amazing recipe! Too good in fact... I now need help: I've somehow got myself roped into making 600 for an event at work next Friday. And I'm concerned about the size of the trays I'm planning on using. They're approx 24 inches x 16 inches - much bigger than suggested. Will this effect the gooey-ness of the outcome? Should I simply cook them for longer?

This is my first time making brownies and I thought this recipe was very easy and great. I was a bit nervous since many people said that it didn't completely cook in 25 mins. So i boosted my temp to 335 and baked for 25 mins. It came out perfectly fine.

The quintessential brownies! The water bath portion of the recipe took much longer than I'd anticipated and I was unsure I'd made the cocoa/butter/etc. hot enough but the end result was perfect, so hang in there if the method seems a bit odd.

For the last week I've been having a chocolate craving itch that I just couldn't scratch. Until I made these brownies.

I wish I could have given this recipe at least FIVE stars! After reading some of the other reviews I almost didn't try it. I guess it goes to show some people can screw up even the most elementary recipe because to say that these are the best brownies I ever tasted in my whole life is saying a lot. I've been eating brownies for 50 years! My husband was so impressed he thought the owner of a chocolate shop that he knows of should sell them!

This recipe was a disaster-- I followed it to the letter and ended up having to bake it for over 50 minutes, at which point it still wasn't fully cooked.

FYI - Black cocoa is what they put in Oreo cookies. It is black because they ultra-alkalize (Dutch-process) it - not because it is any "richer" than unalkalized cocoa. It actually produces cocoa that is usually more difficult to work with, although in certain recipes it is desirable for a dramatic color. Beware!

Rating: 4
I used 1/4 cup of black cocoa (purchased from kingarthurflour.com). I don't usually like fudgy brownies but with the deep dark chocolate flavor I loved these with an ice cold glass of milk. Hits the spot for a SERIOUS chocolate craving. It's a good thing the recipe only yields an 8" pan--any more would be dangerous!

Rating: 4
Very rich, dark chocolate flavor. I substituted full-fat vegetable oil spread for the butter and I had no problems. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (I prefer the dark chocolate taste over the sweeter kind) and reduced the flour by about 2 TBS. Baking time was accurate. Outcome was a mix between fudgy and cakey. Difficult to swallow without the help of some milk or vanilla ice cream. YUM! Will definitely make again.

I have to agree with everyone else who has raved about this recipe. I used a quarter of a cup less sugar than called for and it was still sweet enough for our tastes. The only thing I would suggest: don't wait for the batter to become smooth while over the heat because mine never did and it almost started to separate. When I realized what was happening, I quickly took it off the heat and poured it into another bowl. I was a little worried, but everything turned out fine in the end. The only thing missing was vanilla ice cream!

I gave this recipe 4 forks. My brownies went through quite a bit (see below if you are interested) and they tasted awesome! Of course my personal preference is for deep dark chocolate, and this more than satisfied the chocolate craving based on what was in my pantry. Ok, here's the story. I decided to make these as directed but adding 1 tbsp espresso powder and subbing 1/2 cup hershey's dark chocolate chips instead of nuts. My big departure from the instructions was using the microwave per reviews rather than following the directions for the water bath. I microwaved for 4-5 minutes (BTW this is too long) stirring every 30 seconds. I never got anything that looked smooth. I did get bubbly so I knew to pull it out, no way I was putting my finger in that! After I stirred it, the butter started to separate from a big blob of chocolate/sugar mixture. I decided to throw it out at that point but it was too hot to throw in the trash so I left it on the counter for awhile. When I came back somehow the mixture had drastically morphed into something resembling a moist brown sugar texture and the butter had disappeared. At this point I decided to just mix them up so I added the vanilla, eggs, flour and chocolate chips and put them in the pan I had already prepared earlier with parchment paper. Then I had to leave so I stuck them in the fridge instead of baking. Later in the evening I baked them 30 minutes at 325 straight from the fridge. They actually turned out to die for! However, I wouldn't recommend my negligent baking approach. Just FYI not to throw it out in case this happens to you. If anyone undertands what I did, feel free to point out how these could possibly taste so good?

OK, this is really a four fork recipe as is, because it is so easy, but here's my variation. These brownies turn out tender and fudgy, but to get them a little more like a traditional brownie, I added 4 oz each semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chunks to the cooled batter (make sure to taste your white chocolate first- some brands taste wierd). I also upped the flour to 3/4 cup, added 3/4 tsp baking powder, and baked it in a 10 x 10 pan. I had to let the batter cool , and just to be safe, put the chocolate chips in the freezer, because the first time I tried this, they melted right into the batter, disastrous, but my fault completely! This recipe is awesome because it requires no melting chocolate- which I dread!

Rating: 4
This is an amazingly simple dish to make, that turned out GREAT! You're guaranteed to get rave reviews if you make this, just so long as you like brownies on the fudgy side of things. I see in the reviews that some people didn't like these brownies, and thought the cocoa was overpowering, or not sweet enough. I tasted the batter, and decided I wanted them to be a little sweeter, so I added a 1/4 cup of sugar. Just adjust it to your liking. All kinds of variations on these too--I added some peppermint extract for a tasty addition, and I think I may add dried cherries in the future, or chunks of white or dark chocolate. This recipe IS the BEST cocoa brownie recipe I've tried. Do yourself a favor, and bake up a pan of these puppies!

Raves all around on this brownie recipe. It's a great recipe for the kids to make also. We added Belgian chocolate chips to the 'mix', sprinkling them on top right after coming out of the oven. We call them 'raindrop brownies'...because when the 'chips' melt on the top....it looks like rain drops. A new family favorite.

My batter was VERY thick, I had to scoop it out of the bowl, so I was a little nervous that I hadn't measured the amounts properly. However, they are moist and chewy and delicious. One of my best friends is allergic to gluten, so I substituted 1/2 c. rice flour + 1/4 tsp of baking powder for the regular flour. Usually this kind of substitution is a recipe for disaster in baked goods, but these brownies are still MAGNIFICENT! If you are looking for a gluten-free brownie recipe, this is a very easy one to transform.

ok, i wouldn't say these turned out wrong, but i'm wondering if they could be better if the recipe proceded as described. i also didn't get the smooth effect until the eggs, and even then it wasn't all that smooth. is the sugar supposed to dissolve in the butter? cause mine didn't, nor did it get "hot." was i just impatient? i was afraid of overworking the butter, as i had a recent mishap with that... very tasty, and definitely will make again, as it's quite a quick and easy recipe.

I used Natural cocoa powder and these brownies turned out delightful. They were fudgey & chewey in texture, and very chocolatey. I garnished them with powdered sugar on top. Maybe I'll use frosting next time. I would definitely recommend this if you're a deep, dark chocolate lover!

As the name declares, these ARE the Best Cocoa Brownies. I followed the recipe instructions exactly (except I used salted butter and didn't add 1/4 tsp of salt) and had no problems. I baked for 27 minutes. I used a natural cocoa called Chatfield's. The brownies were indeed very chocalate-y and gooey, even messy, but who cares? They were delicious.

Yum. I've been making this for a couple of years and it always turns out great, especially with Guittard cocoa from the bulk bin at Whole Foods. I like to add almond extract and (drained) Morello Cherries. Yum.

To the cook who did their brownies for 35 minutes: normally I would have misgivings as well as you think "goodness - the eggs can't be done!" But they are - when cooked from 20-25 these brownies come out like some kind of dream, so dense and good. Alice is a goddess of precision so if you make this recipe with no alterations you can be sure it will come out fabulous. Don't worry if your knives aren't coming out clean so long as your oven was at the correct temperature.

i love this recipe! they are the best brownies i've made or eaten..and they don't even need any icing!

Great recipe, but I found both times I made it that it needed to cook for about 35 mins. Also, I just melted the butter and then mixed in the sugar, cocoa, and salt right on the stove. This is easier than the way the second paragraph suggest. Then I proceeded as written.

This is my favorite brownie recipe. It is perfect. I have made them so many times and they always get rave reviews! I used natural sugar and maybe that is why, but it doesn't get smooth until I add the eggs.

My brownies turned out totally flat and very fudgey. The cocoa taste was a bit overwhelming too...just too rich. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but was expecting something more amazing.

Very rich and decadent, AMAZING! I love gooey chewy brownies and bit of nuts. If you use Valrhona cocoa powder, will just make it even better. Family and friend who are pretty critical love this brownie recipe.

I expected "normal" brownies - this is the worst recipe I have ever used for brownies. Actually, I should not say that because that infers that there have been other horrible recipes and that is not true. After 20 to 25 minutes they were totally uncooked - checked another recipe and kept them in the oven for about 50 minutes. Well, one day later they are the same as when they came out - so sticky you can't get them off your teeth and not at all what you perceive brownies should be, i.e. sticky, gooey and flat.

This is very fudgey. Don't make this one if you like cakey brownies. It's a very easy recipe with good results. My husband enjoyed them although I'm still in search for a chewy, moist, and slightly cakey brownie.

This is my favorite brownie recipe, it is sooo perfect. I do, however, substitute high quality coconut oil for the butter when I am out of butter, since it is the only other healthy saturated fat (Despite what you may believe, high quality expeller pressed or virgin coconut oil is very good for you! www.coconut-info.com). It makes a very yummy crust on the top just like it says. I also used dutch chocolate.

I swear I followed the recipe exactly and I got some black glop that tastes not great and doesn't resemble brownies at all. I have had so few disasters with epicurious I just don't know why this was so terrible. It's going on the compost pile.

Delicious! Longer baking time is a must though. I baked 35 minutes and they were perfect. I was looking for a recipe for a Sunday afternoon snack I could fix with ingredients I had on hand. I used Hershey's cocoa, and since I try to watch cholesterol, the only margarine/butter product I use is "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter". I loaded the batter down with walnuts though--so much for low cholesterol, huh. The brownies were very easy and turned out perfectly. Very good the second day too.

I found this to be a little too sweet. I would reduce to the amount of sugar to maybe a cup.

I love one-pan desserts: this one especially so because it doesn't require an electric mixer. I low-fatted this version by using 1/2c applesauce + 1/4stick butter. I imagine it would've got 4 forks with all butter, but it was fudgy and moist nonetheless. Like other reviewers had said: good quality cocoa is key.

Heavenly fudgy brownies. My only modification was to add a little rum flavor which required a few extra minutes of cooking. This was the first time I've ever cooked brownies using parchment paper and it worked spectacularly well. Overall great recipe!

Finally a cocoa brownie recipe that packs a fudgy wallop. I don't prefer brownie recipes that use those squares of unsweetened choc because its too much hassle and extra cost and I always have cocoa on hand. My brownies were fudgy dark inside with a shiny crackly crust on top, just like the boxed mixes. Just as the other reviews stated, as you melt the butter, sugar and cocoa, it does get grainy and hard to mix, but so what? After the second egg is added, it all smoothes out in the end and thats what counts. I made this twice in a row. Both came out perfectly consistent. I added 1/2 cup each of coconut, chocolate chips and pecans, then drizzled some storebought caramels melted with a bit of water on top. German Chocolate Brownies!

Yum..Yum! You really can't tell that these weren't made with real chocolate. I used Hershey's European Style (Dutch Processed) Cocoa. The brownies have a dark chocolate, fudgy taste. They're moist, yet not greasy. Me and my husband both had a second piece because they were so good and they weren't too rich. 20-25mins is not enough to cook. Mine, like others, took 35-40mins to get done. I'll certainly make this again.

Rating: 4
Very good brownies! I've discovered that it's even possible to make them sort of healthily. I substituted about half the butter with plain yogurt (not nonfat, though). I'd imagine you could even play with the proportions quite a bit. The texture when they were right out of the oven was fantastic...like they melted away in your mouth! Then, the next day, it was like a big block of fudge, but that's good too, of course

Rating: 3
A great brownie recipe. Chewy, chocolatey, and much less greasy than brownies I've made with chocolate. To the cook from Toronto - try making these again with another brand of cocoa. Droste is a very nice cocoa from Holland that is available in some markets. It makes great hot cocoa too!

Mmmmm. We're smack in the middle of a blizzard and I was just craving some warm brownies. Though I have many recipes, I wanted to try something new. I'm so happy I did! They are delicious and easy (I had everything in the house that I needed to make them). Perfectly gooey chocolate without being too sweet. I used a natural cocoa (vs. Dutch) and they really are great - I especially love the slight crustiness on top. Like others, I also had to bake for 30 minutes (and I have a pretty reliable oven). Make sure you have plenty of cold milk on hand and enjoy!

This is a great brownie recipe for cocoa powder brownies. I used Droste and they came out great. I mixed the sugar, salt and powder together and added it slowly to the butter as it melted in a glass mixing dish over a pan of simmering water. Stir lots and keep things moving or the sugar could burn. Yes, it looks like sludgey clumpy goop but when the eggs are added, things are fine. Just follow the directions, it really is very easy. I too had to cook if for around 30-35 minutes. The texture is very dense and chewy, chocolaty but not too sweet. Great with vanilla ice cream and for a special occation (but really easy, I promise)

I hoped this recipe was the end to my search for cocoa based brownies. I made them last night and they were bland, crumbly, dry, and pasty. Could someone tell me what I did wrong? I used Hershey's Cocoa.

Yum! These are great and moist and easy. I used whole toasted pecans -- didn't even bother to chop them first. A batch of these made some friends very happy this Christmas.

Yum, yum, yum! Delicious! I, too, found the initial cocoa mixture weird-looking and clumpy, but that's what everything heavy with cocoa does. But it worked out great once the eggs, etc. were mixed in. These are easy and fantastic, and made some friends very happy when I gave them a batch for Christmas! I used toasted pecan halves -- didn't bother to chop them even coarsely first. Terrific.

Fantastic brownies. I especially like this recipe because it contains ingredients that I'm likely to have around!. One note though: cocoa quality is really crucial here. I used cheap dutch-processed cocoa, and the brownies were pretty good, not great. But, when I used a high-quality natural cocoa, they were superb. Oh, and I also found the texture of the cocoa/butter mixture kinda weird. It worked out in the end though.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I topped them with a chocolate peppermint frosting and gave them to friends who raved! But take note! There is very little flour, so these are extremely fudgy. I had to cook them an extra 10 min or so just to keep them from being goopy. This recipe is more along the lines of a french gateau, focusing on butter and cocoa rather than flour, so expect longer cooking times and a little difficultly when cutting them. I wouldn't call these the "best," but they're pretty good!

Rating: 4
EXCELLENT brownie recipe, but you MUST use the very best quality cocoa and only real butter. Do not overcook!

I liked these, but I don't think mine turned out like everyone else's did... I didn't find them to be fudgy at all. My real question though, is did anyone else have difficulty with the melting of the butter, sugar & cocoa? Mine turned to what looked like concrete mix, and no matter how much or long I stirred, it never got smooth. I went ahead with the recipe anyways, and they turned out fine though. Maybe that's why they weren't so fudgy??

Although these brownies were fudgy, they seemed to lack a good chocolate flavor. I probably won't make them again because I have two other recipes that are exceptional.

I've made this several times: plain, with walnuts, with raspberries, with rum-soaked raisins. It's always delicious. I use Scharffen-Berger cocoa, I've used dark brown sugar, white sugar, brown sugar... It's very easy and the instructions make it look more complicated than it is. Just mix the heck out of it at every step, you'll be fine. Even people who don't like brownies much like this thing, every good thing said about it here is true.

These are awsome, and I don't even like brownies. The first time I made them, I followed the instructions, and thought my arm would fall off. The second, I put my kitchenaid bowl over the pan of water and then used the mixer the rest of the way. This was much easier. Also, I feel the need about 35 minutes to even resemble done. They are still soft and chewey. I am at 5000 feet altritude though.

This is THE recipe for chocolaty, fudgy, moist brownies. Made super-easy by using my microwave for the cocoa, butter, and sugar mixture. Initially thought that they were looking a little "skimpy" in the 8" pan, but since they are super rich, you only need a sliver to experience the full blown effect that a huge piece of an inferior brownie would take to satisfy your innner chocolate beast! Reminiscent of a flourless chocolate cake. Baked my for 20 mins. using convection. Suggest to not increase baking time due to carry-over cooking. One bowl and spoon and no clean up when using foil.

I made these for a little birthday party and everyone was very, very happy about it. They were decadent, but I felt like I was eating fudge, not brownies. I'll probably use a different recipe next time I just want a classic chewy brownie texture. I'll use this recipe for impressing people and when I'm PMSing.

Very delicious! I was skeptical about the pseudo bain marie--had some difficulty with that, but the results were phenomonal. Very rich, dense fudgey brownies. Definately a keeper! Update: try using the microwave (I know, gasp!:-) to melt the butter, cocoa and sugar mixture, stiring occasionally until smooth. This "shortcut" made this recipe super easy, one bowl, one spoon, one measure to wash!

Hmmm...trust me, I'm a "from scratch" cook, but have never really made brownies from anything other than a box. These brownies were pretty good, but just not like how they taste out of a box. Call me goofy, but that's the taste I like, although these WERE good. Absolutely, though, they take longer than the recipe states...mine took a full 38 minutes.

excellent brownies- We however don't eat butter- not a choice thing. . .The initial mixture never really gets smooth using margarine- margarine doesn't mix well with some things- Once it was the correct temp- which took a microwave to finally achieve- the egg first egg seperated the oil from the mixture, the second brought the mixture together, science is wierd that way. baked for 25 and they are ooey gooey good.
