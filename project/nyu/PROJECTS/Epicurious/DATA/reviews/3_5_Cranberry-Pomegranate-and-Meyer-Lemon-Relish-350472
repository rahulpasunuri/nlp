This is the recipe that turned me into a cranberry sauce believer. I've been making it for Thanksgiving since the '08 issue, and just the other day I thought...why should I only make this once a year? I plan on substituting the lemon for orange the next time I do duck.

Tart, tangy and delicious. Super easy and quick.

This is a very robust relish that demands quality ingredients for the freshest flavor. Such gorgeous, sparkling, gem-like color too! Very quick to prepare if you use a zester or microplane for the orange zest. I recommend chopping the parsley very fine and blending it in well. Such a wonderful alternative to the high fructose corn syrup laden canned stuff.
