This was unbelievable!! So easy to make and my guests were licking their plates. I served it with mashed potatoes, veggie, and the sauce was wonderful on them too. Great comfort food meal for a snowy New England night. Add this to your recipe box for sure!

I liked this and my guests claimed that they really liked this. That said, I agree with the reviewer who thought that the bacon was a bit much in the sauce. I absolutely LOVE bacon and even I thought it was a bit over the top. I might try this again without the bacon. Incidentally, beginners can find a great video on how to cook beef tenderloin here: http://www.finecooking.com/videos/how-to-roast-beef-tenderloin.aspx,. I found it very helpful.

I've made this most Christmases since it first appeared, and it is always wonderful. The sauce is equally good with prime rib.

I would give this recipe 10 forks, it was so good. Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not put the bacon bits in the sauce, but saved them for another dish, like a quiche or salad topping. Did use the bacon drippings to sear the meat. I would suggest you check your meat about 20 minutes after to begin to roast it and check the temperature with your meat thermometer, as everyone's ovens vary in temperature a bit and you don't want to over cook this piece of meat. My company raved about the meal and asked for the recipe. I did make oven roasted small red potatoes and haricot verts with herb butter and a green salad with dried cranberries, sliced pears with a raspberry vinaigrette, sprinkled with candied pecans.

The BEST gravy ever. Every time I make it people rave. I only use about half the butter called for, and sub onions for shallow sometimes. I use some of the bacon fat instead of oil to cook the veg.

Great recipe but way too much gravy. Not to worry though cause I'm gonna freeze it for the next time. Yummy!

Loved this! We eat beef A LOT and this is by far one of the best beef recipes out there. I've made this a few times now and I think the key is to reduce the sauce to at least half to get full flavor and depth. I now make batches of the sauce (include all ingredients except for the beef) and keep it in the freezer for those days I need a quick dinner - I just grill up a steak and drizzle this sauce over it. I've even drizzled this over pork chops and it's wonderful!

I'm sure I've reviewed this recipe before but I have to re-emphasize what a perfect recipe this is. It's a holiday staple in our family - either Christmas Eve or New Year's. The sauce is pure heaven and this meal is so easy to make it's perfect for a seasoned cook or a novice. This year we served it with Epicurious's Potato Gratin with Mushrooms and Gruyere which was also a hit.

Rating: 4
I hate myself for overcooking this meat (took it out at 130 degrees). It was still tender but far from the medium rare I love. I made one change to the gravy - did not add back the bacon mostly because I hate when bacon becomes soggy. I have to say it was absolutely delicious. The very subtle tartness of the gravy coupled with the sweetness of the roasted shallots is then finished off with the gorgeous sheen of melted butter. Truly special and the first four forks I have ever given on this site. Served it with scalloped potatoes and buttered green peas.

Like a reviewer from California, I have fixed this recipe over and over again since the original publication in Bon Appetit back in 1997.

I have used this recipe over and over since it was published in 1997. It is a favorite with friends and family. I have had so many requests that I have finally had to reveal my source! My suggestion is to use beef broth with some body. I use the Tawny Port, but also with some body. Reduction is key. I have improvised with other ingredients, but this is a great recipe.

As always, the cut of beef makes the dish. That said, this entree was delicious! Everyone loved it. I made a few changes: used ruby port instead of tawny; uncured beef bacon instead of regular bacon; and just realized as I am writing this review that I forgot to add the tomato paste!

This is one of the most marvelous roast beef recipes I've ever made (or eaten). I've made it several times and found it to be easily reproducible every time. It's also easy to keep the proportions correct whilst changing the quantities to serve more or fewer guests. The only thing I've found is that I prefer to use whole pearl onions instead of shallots because they hold their shape better; the halved shallots fall apart when you stir them into the sauce.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely amazing. The meat was so delicious and tender it didn't need to sauce, but the sauce was so delicious it was impossible not to eat. We didn't do watercress, we did steamed veggies with crusty french bread. It was for a two-family dinner and couldn't have possibly been better. I'm making it tomorrow night for a date. I can't WAIT to eat it again .

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit. Caution to not let it get overdone; the temp rose 5-10 degrees after sitting. The sauce was delicious; although in a 9" pie pan the shallots didn't roast, they just steamed; so after a while I just spread them out in a bigger pan and turned the heat up to roast them. I agree with the others-the sauce was divine.

Yummy yummy yummy - great for a special occasion since it is easy and relatively fast (although expensive since it's tenderloin). The only change was that it took almost twice as long for my shallots to carmelize and I forgot the bed of watercress (oops)

Fabulous! As others have said, this made an elegant and delicious Christmas dinner. We cooked a smallish tenderloin (about 2.75 lbs) to 135 and it was on the medium side of medium rare. I put the bacon in shallots in the sauce but thickened it with cornstarch as others suggested. The sauce was chunky but still worked beautifully.

My guests and I loved this. The meat was so wonderful, we almost forgot to use the incredible sauce which I served alongside. I seared the tenderloin in the bacon fat but left the bacon out of the final sauce. Did not add the tomato paste either...I thickened the sauce with Wondra flour. Roasted the meat to 140 and it was a perfectly done medium rare. Will definitely make again.

This is the second time I have made this for Christmas. This time I followed another's advice on the Port Sauce.

I've made this recipe a few times now but never with beef tenderloin. Primarily because of the cost but also the sauce is strongly flavored and why do you need that with a beef tenderloin? I used pork tenderloin and a beef sirloin. I love the sauce and so do my guests. I like to prepare what I can ahead of time and did so with the sauce. It's a great compliment, good strong flavor and wonderful over mashed potatoes.

Expensive cut so be prepared to shell out some $$$ but a very nice result. The pan sauce is what really makes this dish along with the nicely caramelized shallots for that slightly sweet and savory combination. Creme fraiche mashed potatoes, garlic haritcoverts, a nice full bodied red wine and a nice fire to fall asleep by on a cold night....

I prepared everything ahead of time so all we had to do was sear the meat and finish the gravy-not so hard even with 5 little kids running around! The meat was perfectly cooked I took it out at 130 degrees and it sat for about 15 min while I prepared the gravy. Sooooo good I cant wait for left overs today!!!

Have made this sauce before to serve with prime rib roast when tenderloin was cost prohibitive. (You won't even miss the au jus.) Definitely make the sauce ahead. I brown bacon in the oven, remove the bacon, and then add a bag of frozen pearl onions to the bacon grease and return to the oven to roast while the broth/port is reducing. Add the onions at the completion of the sauce so that it can absorb the flavors of the bacon and onions. (I don't add the bacon back in.) Prepare the roast using your favorite seasoning/roasting method and serve the sauce with or without the onions. When serving, I arrange them on the platter of sliced beef and guests can help themselves. This is impossible to screw up and the sauce is perfect every time. It is very versatile - a real hit with guests. Can't wait to try it with pork tenderloin as others have suggested.

Made this for a dinner party over the weekend - served it with Pork Tenderloin instead of beef and a wild rice pilaf with sauteed onion, pecans and cherries. It was to DIE FOR. Everyone loved it - I made extra sauce and served it for my family the next night over mashed potatoes. Really exceptional flavors. I made some changes to avoid last minute mixing - I made the reduced the beef stock and port, then mixed it together with the roasted shallots and bacon the night before the party. The night of, I simply heated it up and thicked it with some corn starch (didn't do the flour) and I did not deglaze the pan that the meat cooked in. THe flavor did not suffer at all, and it made it much more simple. The sauce is kind of chunky - I might puree the roasted shallots and bacon next time. It was wonderful and I am making it again for another dinner party in 2 weeks (different crowd of people).

Rating: 4
I made this for 10 people, and I have never tasted a tenderloin so flavorful and moist. The key "must" is to prepare the sauce and shallots ahead. There are quite a few steps, but done ahead it was easy. I also skipped the bacon--definitely not needed.

I'm not sure what exactly I did wrong, but this didn't turn out so great! I was cooking for two, so instead of searing a full tenderloin, I cut what I had into two steaks and then seared it on med-hi heat in the bacon grease for about 4 minutes, but when I did, my kitchen filled up with smoke, and the steaks got so blackened that the burned taste overpowered all the other flavors. I wonder what I did wrong? Otherwise, the sauce was good...

I have made this two ways. I used pork tenderloin the first time, and it was wonderful. Last night I used the beef tenderloin but substituted a strong Zinfandel for the Port--a richer, less sweet sauce--and it was fabulous. I coated the beef with herbs de Provence instead of just thyme. Piled it all over mashed potatoes and topped with grilled asparagus. All plates were scraped clean.

This was an excellent, easy recipe which got rave reviews! I bought just under 4 pounds of tenderloin for 6 people, and we had just one slice left. The sauce was delicious! It was nice to be able to do the shallots and sauce ahead of time. I will certainly serve this dish again. When I took the meat out at 130 degrees, it went up to 140 degrees while resting, which was medium.

I made this for a sit-down Christmas Dinner for 10 people. I think it was a pretty good recipe, but required some attention at the end and I couldn't enjoy sitting with my guests. I did do some prep the day before to get ready and that was really helpful. It was also hard because the meat wasn't very hot after it sat under the foil tent and you had to finish up the sauce. I think the biggest thing for me was timing the sit-down meal with a small kitchen and only one oven to work with. I do think everyone enjoyed it, but I guess I was expecting so much more from all the incredible reviews and how people just raved about how amazing this dish was.

I was all ready to go with this recipe for Christmas day. The sauce was made and in the fridge. My table was set. The sides were planned and started.

Sauce was great, albeit a little labor-intensive. I agree that one should not use a very expensive cut as the sauce overpowers the meat. The use of a low-sodium broth or home-made broth is a must. I used a low-salt broth and still found the sauce a tiny bit salty.

I made the same error in judgement as the cook from Thousand Oaks and bought $24.99/lb organic premium tenderloin. Such high quality meat stands well alone without the embellishment of such a heavy sauce. The directions for the tenderloin work well, with the addition of rosemary. The sauce was quite delectable, but better suited to lesser quality meat.

I cheated over christmas (hey I was hosting the in-laws for the first time!) and used grandma's standby: warm tenderloin to room temp, sprinkle w/s,p, and thyme, and roast in preheated oven @ 500 for 20 min. then turn down to 350 for another 15 min (or until thermometer says 125 in center). remove, spread w/butter, and cover w/foil for 10-15 min (this finishes the cooking up to med. rare for those of you doubting the 125 temp). yum! also, I have made the sauce both w/ and w/o bacon and it's always excellent. be sure to reduce fully to get the maximum flavor (and sneaking a spoonful of beef or veal demi-glace in never hurts either!). divine and perfect knock-their-socks-off food.

I made this recipe for my in-laws on Christmas Eve and took the meat out of the oven at 125 degrees like the recipe says. After resting, it was nowhere near 145 degrees which would be medium-rare. So it went back in the oven until it reached 145 and tasted great after resting again. Is this a misprint? Take it out at 145 degrees (not 125!) and it will be a perfect medium-rare.

Made this dish for New Year's. The tenderloin and sauce are each excellent in their own right. However, I used fresh, organic beef ($24.95/lb) that stood well enough on its own. Embellishing it with a sauce would have been like gilding the lily. Next time, will reserve lesser quality meat for this recipe.

Wonderful, I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Prepared most of the sauce the day before and refrigerated it overnight as it takes time to prepare.

Served with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, and bacon, dried cherry salad with Roquefort vinaigrette salad from this site, was fabulous!

Luxurious results with limited effort; a definite keeper for holidays. The internal temperature yields perfectly done meat; the sauce is rich and generous. Guests asked for the recipe.

A disappointment. Bacon bits in gravy; except for the scallions, the flavors did not stand out - were overpowered by the side dishes of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans!

I was very disappointed in this recipe, specifically in the sauce. The sauce lacked richness, flavor and depth and I also didn't care for the bacon after it was added to the sauce. After adding to the sauce, the bacon lost crispness and flavor.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. It has become a Christmas Eve tradition in our home. However, I have made some adjustments: I use half of the shallots called for in the recipe. I also make the entire sauce the day before, browning the bacon and adding to the sauce. I roast the meat separately, not browning in bacon grease as it doesn't need it. While the meat is roasting, I reheat the sauce and then strain the bacon and most of the shallots out of the sauce to make is a bit smoother. Spoon over the slices of meat for a lovely entree! I have also frozen any leftover sauce and served it over grilled beef fillet steaks and it's delicious!

I was so looking forward to this dinner. What a disappointment! I bit the bullet and spent $60.00 on a 2# beautiful beef tenderloin that you could cut with a fork and covered it up with a "sauce"(really a gravy) that could or probably should be served with a much cheaper cut of meat that needs a lot of help. These two just don't go together at all.

I think this is the best tenderloin sauce I've ever made or eaten. It's simple enough and the sweetness from the shallots and port give a fantastic complexity. And, it is a very elegant but relatively easy fancy dinner party entree. I do think it needs to be served with a very big red wine because the flavors will overpower something more subtle. I'm looking forward to serving this again.

I made this last night for a dinner party with mashed potatoes with prosciutto and parmesan cheese (from this website) and haricots verts. This will be on any special occasion menu at my house.

This was delicious. I made it for a dinner party of 7 people. The tenderloin was $25/lb, which was way out of my price range, so I used two rib-eye roasts -- a 3 lb and a 4 lb. Suggested serving size was a half pound per person, but there wasn't a drop left. Cooking time took a little longer with the roasts. I had them in the oven for about and hour and 20 minutes cooked to medium. Everyone raved about it, particularly the shallots. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved. Made the sauce the night before (don't be tempted to double the sauce as it makes quite a lot) and seared the beef in the bacon grease then refrigerated it. Pulled it out an hour before baking to bring to room temp then continued on with the recipe. My sauce never thickened adequately, so I made a cornstarch & water slurry, which thickened it nicely. I agree with another reviewer that the bacon may not be necessary. Served this on a bed of mashed potatoes & butternut squash w/ garlic from this site. It was fabulous!

Wonderful. Takes a little time but is easy. The carmelized roasted shallots really add a lot of flavor. Was a winner for a dinner party. The 2nd time I made it, I used a pork tenderloin, and just butterflied it, browned it & finished sauteeing it until almost done, did this ahead of time. Then put in foil & heated it up at the last minute & served with the reduction sauce.

It is the port reduction that truly makes this dish spectacular. Loved the richness in flavour. The shallots made a very good addition to the sauce, but I'm not convinced the bacon was necessary. It would've been just as good without it. The tenderloin was succulent and juicy. I practically had it still "mooing" when I served it. Very good recipe.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit! Like many recipes on this site, it takes a bit longer to prepare than indicated. As suggested, I prepared the beef broth/port and shallots the night before, along with a potato gratin with Gruyere, and then I was able to join my guests instead of spending the whole time in the kitchen during the party. The gravy turned out wonderfully! Definitely will make this again.

It is likely that in the multitude of reviews, somebody has already commented that pork tenderloin works well also. In case this hasn't been mentioned recently, please let me assure that pork tenderlion was excellent using this format.

Oh Wow! I don't think I can make turkey for Christmas again. The tenderloin was perfect -and- the sauce was to die for. In my haste I forgot to add the shallots & bacon (which I had cooked) and served the port sauce without them. It was still superb! My family & guests said it was the best Christmas dinner they had ever had! Later that week I made the port sauce again as a base for mushroom ragu -- a seriously excellent recipe!

I have made many dishes from Epicurious.com, and this is by far the BEST. I will definitely make it many times in the future. I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more flour to thicken the sauce. Any novice cook can make this, and impress all who partake.

I made this for Christmas dinner (2004) and couldn't believe how amazing it turned out. I am hardly a gourmet chef but thought I would give it a shot. At the last minute I had to substitute a beaujolais wine for the port, but my guests could not stop saying how "gourmet" everything was. The beef melted in your mouth and the sauce was superb. I also made the Garlic Horseradish Cream as another sauce and served with the Sage & Cheddar mashed potatoes. Fantastic!!!

I also made it for New Year's Eve, and it was terrific. Using low-salt broth and lower-sodium bacon meant I had to add just a touch of salt at the end, but the result was just divine. Take out the bacon if you like, but personally my fiance and I thought the flavor it added was great (and come on, if you're eating beef tenderloin you might as well not sweat the calories!).

This recipe is devilishly decadent. My husband and I served it for New Year's Eve and will definitely serve it again. We used pancetta for the bacon which added to the richness of the dish. The gravy is so simple but so delicious. I thank the reviewers before me for sharing such good information!

to add to my previous review... I found a pound of shallots from Melissa's at Shaw's supermarkets (in New England) for 3.99. Their website is melissas.com. We also used tenderloin tips at 6.99 a pound for the meat - the same tender cut without the price tag.

The port wine reduction is gorgeous! I made it the day before along with the roasted shallots in order to save some time. I disagree with those suggesting removing the bacon. I used the pan fat to prep my herbed Yorkshire pudding and they came out beautifully! If you're a foodie, you've got to try this one.

Loved the roast, however, I felt the gravy was way too thick. Such a great cut of meat doesn't need a heavy gravy. Loved the flavor of the port and shallots, agree with other reviewers that bacon is not necessary.

Rating: 3
Excellent though I'm rating my revised version, which like others eliminated the bacon, my meat was so perfect (and so expensive!) that I couldn't see adding to it with a bacony flavor. I also followed my butcher's roasting instructions, which were to preheat oven to 500, roast 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 for the remainder. I also used a meat thermometer since my guests prefer more medium as opposed to rare meat. Sauce is excellent.

I have made this recipe when it first came out and loved it. I have made for at least 5 Christmas dinners. I couldn't find it in my recipe file and went crazy. But I know this site has Bon Appetite recipes and found it again. Thank you so much, this is really a great recipe!!!

This was very good! I made for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I did simplify it a bit and like a few other reviewers I think you could easily skip the bacon and either use bacon drippings or oil to brown the meat. Instead of roasting the shallots I browned them in the same pan as the frying bacon peading things up a bit. I made the sauce as I prepared the meat and than did not add the drippings but just thickened it and added the shallots and bacon after it was reduced. This way I served my first course while the meat was roasting and as soon as the meat rested I was able to cut and serve as the sauce was all ready made. I also omitted the second 3 tbsp of butter from the sauce and it was delicious and plenty rich.

We used this as the main course for a "dinner for 10" purchased by friends at a charity auction. The buyers paid $2,000, so we felt we had to find something special, and this recipe fit the bill and received rave reviews (especially the sauce). Did the recipe pretty much as written. Other Epicurious recipes used: (a) Crostini with Spiced Crab and Shrimp Salad (b) Sausage-Stuffed Mushrooms (c) Apple, Dried Cherry and Walnut Salad with Maple Dressing (d) Sauteed Haricot Verts, Red Bell Peppers, and Pine Nuts (e) Chive Popovers (f) Triple-Chocolate Pudding Pie with Cappucino Cream. Used a different Missouri wine with each course. Finished with "Port and chocolates" in the host couple's 1860 wine cellar. A great evening!

What a waste of delicious tenderloin. The "sauce" is really a gravy and more suited to meatloaf. My fault, I should've looked the recipe more closely and realized I was making a gravy; I was just to in love with the idea of bacon, port and carmelized shallots in a "sauce".

Rating: 3
This WAS a delicious recipe! I recommend only 2 changes: (1) Use as many low-sodium sauce ingredients as you can, e.g. unsalted butter, low- or no-sodium beef broth (preferably organic, as the broth is the dominant flavor), don't salt the shallots, etc. The broth reduction + butter + bacon = a nearly-too-salty sauce, and you can always salt just before or after serving it. (2) I used a bit more flour in the butter/flour paste, and didn't add the second 3 T of butter (and didn't miss it at all). I served this roast with a potato/onion gratin, julienned squash/carrots, and some wonderful carmelized onion french bread (mmm, and tonight is leftovers!)

This was really delicious. I made it for our Easter dinner and my guests could not stop raving about it.

I made this for my "first" official dinner party . . and it was absolutely fantastic . .the beef was like butter and the sauce was absolutely delicious. However next time I am going to use low sodium bacon so that I can adjust the salt at the end to my taste. I served with white cheddar mash potatoes with sage & roasted spring medley of mushrooms. yum!

This dish is simply fab-u-lous! I made it for an elegant dinner of 12 using a nearly 7 lb slab from Costco. I had wanted the center cut like someone else suggested and let me warn you - if your butcher say you don't need to preorder it don't believe them! Thank goodness my nephew (a 5 star chef) showed early and trimmed and tied the meat for me! However the taste is really worth it. I made the reduction sauce a day ahead and roasted the shallots early in the day -- btw to get them dark took much longer than in the recipe. I can't truly speak as to how long to roast because my nephew took my meat thermometer away and had me roast it at 425º for 20 mins, then 5 more with the oven off for a perfect med-rare. This stellar dish is going in the keeper and repeat file. All were almost licking their plates of the sauce. I served this with a salad of baby greens, sliced pears, Gorgonzola, with a blush vinaigrette; rustic mashed new potatoes with sour cream/chives and a bit of garlic; spinach gratin; and for dessert Dulce de Leche Ice Cream Cake with Brownie base. Delish!

This was absolutely delicious. I made it for a dinner party for 15 and everyone raved. The only problem I encountered was that after taking it out at 125 as directed it only went up to 135 and then stopped warming. We put it back in the oven for ten minutes and it was uniformly medium rare all the way through. The sauce is lucious.

We made this recipe for my sister's small wedding reception. The temperature of the meat rose a great deal out of the oven - it was rare when slicing, but a little too dry at the table!

This is a FABulous dish!! It received rave reviews for Christmas dinner. Some changes: (1)I seared the tenderloin in bacon grease but did not use the bacon in the sauce--perfect bacon flavor that did not overwhelm the meat. (2) I only used 16 shallots and could have gotten away with less. They were $1.50 for 2 at my grocery store!! (3) I used 2-2.5 center cut tenderloins per the rec of my butcher. The amount was perfect for 10 people. Order the center cut loins rather than whole tenderloins to avoid the narrow, dry ends of the meat. This way, all the meat cooks evenly. (4) I used extra flour for a thicker sauce. (5) Served the meat from the kitchen rather than buffet style to avoid waste (another butcher rec.) Make the shallots and sauce a day ahead for time management. Also fry the bacon a day ahead and save the grease.

I made this dish for 14 people (I increased the measurements)and it was a Grand slam! I used the trimmings of beef and fat from the tenderloins and made my own beef stock. It was very simple to make and with my simple side dish of sauteed red peppers and white shoepeg corn it was a snap! This is now my new big dinner pleaser.

This dish was tasty, but way more troublesome to make than it should be. Roasting the shallots was fine, but all the work for the rest of the sauce was not worth it. Definitely skip the bacon step; merely browning the meat in oil will do. There are much easier recipes for beef tenderloin on this site.

My boyfriend successfully beat his best time for a half-ironman triathlon so I made this dinner to celebrate. I prepared the shallots the night before and the house smelled wonderful. When I make this for a weekend dinner party I'll do it all at once so the aroma would increase everyone's appetite. The only changes were that I used an organic no-fat beef broth and port, and I thickened the sauce with flour and water rather than adding butter. The bacon, shallots and port provide plenty of fat and flavor. When making this for 2 people, you probably need only 1-2 slices of bacon. I used 4 slices and had more than enough for the sauce and salad. I served the tenderloin with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes (skins on) and salad of spring greens with bacon and brie cheese. We loved everything and he had seconds of mashed potatoes and gravy. This was a fun recipe to make. I've already emailed it to several friends.

Rating: 4
Pricey, but excellent. A good choice for a special occasion. Roasting the shallots and preparing the reduction ahead of time allowed me to enjoy my company with a minimum of time spent in the kitchen finishing the dish. If I could give it 5 stars, I would. In fact, my boyfriend took one bite, closed his eyes, and then said, "I can't believe you're not married yet." Now that's a compliment for a simple dish.

Wonderful. Looking forward to leftovers tonight. Halved the recipe. Bought the tenderloin at Sams & froze the other half. I love shallots, but only buy them in bulk since in the cute little net bags they are overpriced. I didn't believe 125 degrees for medium rare -- at 140 it was plenty bloody & red/pink. Added a little extra broth to bring the sauce to a thickness I preferred. Looking forward to a repeat performance -- served with the gratin from the same month's issue (Dec97) & salad. Rave reviews from all!

I finally got around to making this after reading all the reviews. I thought it was excellent, and the sauce truly made the dish. Perhaps the reviewer who called the sauce "mundane" may not have been referring to the flavor, but perhaps that it is a fairly traditional sauce treatment. I did not use the butter/flour paste (buerre manie??) to thicken it, though. I prefer a thinner, closer to "jus" consistency for beef sauces. I used a little slurry made of cornstarch and a little red wine, and I added all the beef juice I collected from the "rested" tenderloin back to the sauce. It was lovely.

I've made this recipe 4 times so far and it is one of the best beef dishes I've ever made (and I've made alot!). Although beef tenderloin is expensive, I buy a decent size at Costco's (like a Sam's Club) who has very good quality meat, and divide them into portions I need and freeze the rest. Using beef tenderloin instead of other cuts of beef really makes the dish. Also, I don't understand the previous reviewer's comment about the bland sauce. The sauce actually makes the dish. I double the sauce (since everyone loves this), leave the shallots intact in the sauce, and season the sauce (as the recipes calls for) with just salt and pepper. Everyone loves this dinner entree and always ask for me to make this again!

I thought the sauce was wonderful. I will definately make again. The next time though I will just cook the tenderloin on the grill as I always do. It simplifies the recipe and is just as good if not better than oven roasted. As one of the other reviewers stated if the tenderloin is cooked properly it is good no matter what.

Made this for a romantic dinner for my hubby (cut the recipe in half). It was a great success. Wouldn't change a thing. Fixed the shallots and the broth the day before.

This is a fabulous dish, loved by all who taste it. It's a little involved, but not too difficult even for a weeknight. I found that halving all of the ingredients for the sauce and using 2 1/4 lbs. of tenderloin is just the right amount for 4 people.

Three hubbys prepared this meal for our lovely brides over V-Day weekend. It was tremendous, sublime. After scouring the reviews (thanks all), the prep was done as much ahead of time as could be. We were also careful to adjust cooking times/temps with side dishes so that the meal was orchestrated around the beef. Two subs: 1. Used a nice Cab Sav instead of Port; 2. Halved the number of shallots. Modification of recipe: After tenderloins cooked, we added the reduction to the roasting pan, and made the roux in separate sauce pan, combining the two to complete the sauce. Note: We made the full recipe for 6 adults, and glad we did. If you were to only make the 1 roast for six people, someone would have been short changed with the end cuts. We had plenty left over to pack up for all of us. My wife and I had the same meal the next night! The night's menu consisted of Spicy Baked Shrimp (as app), Romaine and Gorgonzola Salad with Roasted Garlic Dressing and Spicy Pecans, Roasted Asp with Balsamic Vinegar, and Crisp Rosemary Potatoes (great for dipping), all from this site; easy to prep! (Asp and potatoes roasted while tenderloin cooled and 2 hubbys completed the sauce.)

WOW! Is the reaction to this recipe. The flavours meld together perfectly. We had this at Christmas and it was the most memorable Christmas dinner ever. By the way, the second time I was feeling 'cheap' so decided to substitute the tenderloin for an eye round roast, and it did not compare. But the sauce lasted many meals, and is great with mashed potatoes!! It is not an everyday meal simply because tenderloin is expensive, but it is sure to impress the in-laws when they come to tea!!

Outstanding! Made as directed and lots left over with only my wife and I eating that day. Froze leftover sauce and then a few days later used on thick grilled veal chops, but I strained out the shallots and pureed them with a little of the sauce, added back to the pot and then sauteed up some chopped shiitake mushrooms in butter and added to the sauce. YUMMY! THIS IS POSSIBLY THE BEST SAUCE I HAVE EVER HAD ON MASHED POTATOES!

This was one of the best recipes I have ever made. I did not change a thing. It served 12 perfectly and everyone loved it, especially the sauce! I wish I had made more. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. A delicious meal. The meat is very expensive, but worth it for a special occasion. I would definely make it again.

A great recipe and a fabulous gravy. You don't need so many shallots and I think there is too much butter in the gravy but it was delicious. I would like to have a good substitute cut instead of the tenderloin which ran me $100.

Made this last night for birthday dinnner for 10 along with potato,cheese,chives and bell pepper crostini all from this site. All I can say is we ran out of gravy and nearly had a riot! The sauce was unbelievable and it was a crowd of gourmets judging. You cannot have enough sauce because folks will put it on EVERYTHING. I'd put it on ice cream! I used a Top loin vs. tenderloin and although I did not like the cut, others did. Recipe proportions and instructions were perfect (except broth) and easily modified up. We did not make gravy in roaster, but used a skillet - seemed easier and worked well. I used 8 - 14oz cans of broth; 6 were low sodium and 2 regular (yes I made a lot of sauce and still ran out). I think that was the right proportion of saltiness, any more and it would have been too much in my opinion. Used half ketchup and half tomato paste. Used both port and merlot. Added a tsp of demi-glaze. Did not add as much butter at end. Used a few less shallots, but don't skimp - they make the sauce. At end, sauce will continue to thicken so stop thickening just prior to desired thickness. We reduced sauce a lot at end step and ended up with about 6 cups gravy (wasn't enough!). Got meat and shallots at Costco so not too pricey. Meat time and temp were right on. Be careful not to overcook - it's easy to do. Suprised that as bloody as the meat drippings were, many pieces were well done, but fortunately not overdone. Clearly a keeper recipe!

I thought this was a pretty good dish. It was definitely more work than a quick dinner, but I made it for only two. I used a squeeqe of ketchup instead of opening a can of tomato paste, and used a little of the bacon fat in the sauce instead of butter (my boyfriend said it was pretty bacony).

Good dish but I found the sauce too salty. I was able to dilute some extra tomato paste in water and add that to cut through some of the salt. How much bacon are other people using?

The first time I made this I goofed and put in too much tomato paste. I salvaged the roasted shallots an bacon using a packaged hunters sauce and it still turned out very well. The second time I made it correctly and WOW. It was great. I used the thick cut "Norske" bacon and it was a phenomenal smokey wine infused sauce. The roasted Shallots are incredible. I highly recommend this for a special occasion meal. I made it (the second time) for my future in-laws and they loved it.

This is my favorite recipe from Epicurious. I just absolutely love it. I have made it at least three times already. I have a small family, so I usually make smaller tenderloins. I have frozen the remaining gravy after making this, and it has frozen very well. I would change nothing in this recipe. It is wonderful!

This recipe was well worth the expense and the effort. However, I would make a change to the sauce,I would put the final sauce through the blender/strainer. The lumpy texture was distracting and made the entire dish seem less refined.

I made this for New Year's Eve and my brother is still commenting on how good it was. It is expensive but definitely worth it for a special occasion. I did use more flour than what the recipe calls for as the sauce seemed to thin. Also you don't have to use as many shallots as called for (they're expensive too) but they are really good if you can.

Well, I took the plunge and spent 150 bucks for the beef for christmas dinner feeding 30 people. Lets just say...My new nickname is Martha. I'm the youngest (30) and least taken seriously adult in the family. Thanks to this recipe I'm now a (cooking) force to be reckoned with! My Grandmother from the old country, who always has "something (negative)" to say, was praising me so much for this dish I nearly fell off my chair. All the jealous stares made this the best Christmas ever!!!!

I've made this three times and it is always great. Roasted two 4+ pound whole beef tenderloins (medium rare) for Christmas Day dinner and 14 of us (including kids) devoured nearly every bit. Major carnivores, apparently. The sauce is divine, although I always seem to forget the tomato paste. This is a classic recipe.

I only made the reduction sauce which I used for a prime rib. I made a mistake and did not add as much broth as indicated, ran out of beef broth and substituted with pork broth. It still came out very tasty. I recommend this reduction for any beef/pork roast. Excellent...even with all my mistakes.

This is an annual Christmas dinner! I have been making this dish for my husband & I for 5 years now. Again, this year the dish was fabulous! I have found that I can successfully make the sauce for 2 - just cut the recipe in half and I buy only one tenderloin - so we can have lunch and dinner the next day. I also serve it with the mushroom potatoes as in the original recipe. It truly is outstanding!

Made this for Christmas dinner for 18 and there was plenty. Rave reviews especially on the sauce. It isn't something I would make everyday because it does take alot of time and I would recommend roasting the shallots (they take twice as long as the recipe states) and reducing the sauce ahead of time.

I was looking forward to making this with all of the great reviews, and was sadly let down. Followed the directions to a t---the sauce was way too shalloty tasting. I prefer my way of cooking a beef tenderloin, studding the beef with slivered garlic, buttering the beef, garlic salt and pepper it, 450 for the first 10 minutes and 325 for the next 30. Melts in my mouth every time! This recipe was a huge disappointment.

I made this for my family of 12 Christmas Eve. It was fantastic. My mom said "it was the best Christmas dinner ever"! I cooked the meat for the specified time of 45min but at 400 rather than 350 degrees. Served a 1985 Mondavi Reserve Cabernet with it...pure heaven!

This was great! I made it for a group of friends from Argentina for Christmas dinner and was a bit nervous, as they are quite picky about beef (their's being being the best in the world and all..just ask them :-)) Everyone raved about this,and wanted the recipe. Like some other reviewers, I used cabernet and it was great, also, used about 1/2 the amount of shallots. My only concern was the recommended temperature resulted in VERY rare beef and we needed to cook it about 5 more minutes.

Once again my fellow epicurious reviewers have come through for me. I'm not a meat eater, but I made this for my carniverous in-laws for Christmas....truly spectacular! I used filet mignons (pan fried) as the butcher was out of tenderloin, and it was still amazing. Although it was probably more frantic in the kitchen at the last minute than it would have been had I used tenderloin! You can't miss with this one!

I am not a big meat-eater, but I wanted to make a special meal for my boyfriend. This was WONDERFUL! I modified the recipe to feed 2 people, using tenderloin steaks, instead. Still, it was excellent.

I must have impressed him, because he has been telling all his friends about the incredible meal I made him!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! I modified the recipe by spreading a mustard and herb crust from the Herb and Garlic-Crusted Beef Tenderloin recipe (Bon Appetit December 1999) onto the seared tenderloin before roasting. A must-do, it was so good! The sauce is also great! I used fresh beef stock instead of canned and a cabarnet sauvignon instead of the port, and it was still delicious! You can also skip out the extra 3 tbsp of butter, as another reviewer suggested. The sauce is very rich and thick, you won't miss the extra butter.

Outstanding! I was spending the weekend in a tiny town in Eastern Washington, and believe it or not, couldn't find beef tenderloin or shallots at the local mom & pop grocery. We're talkin' TINY town. So, I substitued small Spanish onions for the shallots, and sirloin tip roast for the tenderloin...sometimes you have to improvise. :) Even with the substitutions, this was incredible. I'll definitely make it again, and can't wait to try it with the real stuff. Guests raved. Plan for more than 30 minutes to reduce the broth-port mixture; I think it took more like an hour. Enjoy!

After the reviews from previous cooks, I made this for Easter Dinner. What a hit. Needless to say this will be a staple entertainment choice. I doubled the sauce and I am glad I did that. I was a little concered about browing the beef in the bacon fat, I did not tell the wife about that she would have had a fit.

I'll definitely make this for company very soon.

Wonderful for a Really Special occasion; in this case, my FIL's 75th birthday/my 10th anniversary. Be prepared to spend $$$. I bought $20/lb organic tenderloin, total $120 just for the meat. It was worth it. It takes longer than 30 minutes to brown the shallots and reduce the broth. When you're browning the tenderloin in a large roasting pan over two burners, the middle of the roasts won't get brown. You have to maneuver them around the pan to get them thoroughly brown. I made the roux in the saucepan using a little extra flour (about 2 t) while I was deglazing the roasting pan and boiling the broth, then added the broth to the roux. You don't need the extra 3T of butter. Forgot the watercress and didn't miss it. Horseradish mashed potatoes are the perfect side.

I was intrigued by the comments and made this for just me and my husband as a dinner party "rehearsal" Only problem - way too many shallots, and they were rather large -- & not enough sauce...Any advice? Also, how finely should bacon be chopped? Next time I'll double sauce.

This was excellent --- used two steaks instead of the whole beef tenderloin and cut the sauce recipe in half. Yummm!

This was a hit! The number of shallots is exactly what you need to use to make the sauce as rich as it is. Don't do anything different and get the best your butcher has to offer. You'll spend a little money, but it's worth it. Make a nice goat cheese potato gratin, something rich....a nice veggie and a very good Cabernet...and you'll be very happy. This is a keeper recipe for our family. Bon Appetit!

A wonderful friend of ours made this beef tenderloin for us last night. We were all LOVING it. You'll want to serve plenty of bread to mop up the extra sauce after you eat the beef. I'm serious... you will probably want to pour this sauce on your pancakes the next day it's so awesome. YOU CANNOT LOSE WITH THIS RECIPE!!! Thanks to our great friend for this amazing dinner.

Superb! The sauce makes the dish--especially the roasted shallots! I used cabernet and only one pound of shallots, which was just right. Next time I will 1.5X the sauce (would have liked more). I did a practice run with a good quality chuck roast (cooked to 135 degrees) and it was fabulous. The recommendation of a low-salt broth was a good one. Also, I will omit the salt on the shallots. For company I will fry the bacon early in the day, and put the roasting pan in the fridge--the less last minute steps the better.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit with the entire family. The gravy is outstanding and would be wonderful to serve with a nice roast as well. My only suggestion would be that you do not need to roast so many shallots. I found that using about half the quanity was ample and any more would have made the gravy more like a stew than a sauce. I threw the remaining shallots out which was a waste.

My family and regular guests for Christmas dinner insist that we serve this roast and "gravy" -- which I've done to rave reviews the past three years. I use a whole filet, cut in half, usually 6-61/2 pounds, which I cook to 130 degrees in slightly less than an hour for lovely medium rare beef. The sauce is easily made in advance, and works with and without the buerre manie finish. We usually have "cardio mashed potatoes" (using cream cheese and butter, also made in advance), and this year, a new green bean recipe (from this site) with ground cloves and lemon zest (delicious!). Salad with pears and roasted pecans rounds out our feast. I've cut down the sauce recipe by half, which works out well.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit with all 13 guests! The tenderloin was about 6 1/2 lbs. and probably could of been a little bigger. There was one slice left but I think that if there had been more sitting on the platter it would of been eaten. I used the low sodium broth and didn't salt the tenderloin since it was seared in the bacon fat. I was afraid of it being too salty like the other reviewers had mentioned. The recipe does make alot of sauce. My family is a lover of onions and there was still plenty of shallots left over. You could certainly scale down the sauce. I served the tenderloin with two other great recipes from this site (both can be made the day before): Potatoes with Leeks and Gruyere & Warm Green Bean Salad with Pine Nuts and Basil. I used pecans instead of the pine nuts. We will definately be serving this again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! It so much easier to prepare than I anticiapted. Cooking time depends on how thick your piece of tenderloin is, but still, I found 130 degrees just right for medium. I would eliminate the bacon next time to cut down on fat & calories, but definately worth it.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe for tenderloin. I used a whole 4 pound tenderloin, which reached 130 degrees after 35 minutes. I used a different pan for browning the bacon and meat than I did for roasting, so I was able to make the sauce ahead of time. It was superb and I can see making this for other dishes in the future. It is hearty and rich, and makes a generous amount.

I served this at our New Year's Eve potluck party, and it was a hit! The meat was so meltingly tender, my guests were able to cut it with plastic forks while holding their plates and eating standing up! It cooked much faster than stated in the recipe, though. In 45 minutes, the internal temperature hit 140 F for medium rare, rather than the rare I was shooting for. Oh well. The sauce turned out great, too, even though I forgot to finish it off with the butter/flour paste. Wish I could have found some watercress for the garnish, but I used some beautiful baby spinach that was available instead, and it was wonderful. I'll definitely be making this again for another special occasion! (By the way, I served this with rosemary roasted new potatoes, steamed mixed vegetables, veggie tart, and butter biscuits. We poured a choice of sangria or cabernet sauvignon-merlot blend. All gone!!!)

Made this for New Year's Day dinner....just srumptous! I skipped the bacon and used merlot instead of the port and it was still awesome. In addition to the shallots, I roasted some onions and garlic cloves to add to the sauce. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes with gorgonzola and brussels sprouts with lemon and parmesan. What a great meal! Like some other reviewers, I did cook the tenderloin about 35 minutes longer than indicated and it was still med rare. I think this will be our new tradition for NY Day!

Excellent - my guests raved about the sauce. I will be making this again soon. The only thing is the meat takes longer than 45 muniutes. I only used 1 tenderloin at 3 1/2 lbs and it took about 80 minutes (20 minutes per pound).

This is great for a special occasion like Christmas Eve. I arranged the slices on a silver platter garnished with watercress and it looked like the cover of Gourmet. Guests commented that it was so tender it cut like butter. This recipe wasn't hard, but it entailed a few extra steps. I threw in a couple of peeled, chopped potatoes with the roast, an effortless, tasty addition. (Note that I cooked the tenderloin approximately twice the time called for in the recipe. So the potatoes were nice and browned. The meat was medium and still pink.)

This recipe has become our all time "special occasion" meal! Don't skimp on any of the ingredients, prepare the dish exactly as the recipe states and you won't be disappointed! My best "Bon Appetit Buddy" and I stumbled on this one back in 1995 and each of us have served it in our homes at least once a year since! This Christmas Eve I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up the butcher wrapped tenderloin to find not one gigantic one but two reasonably sized ones! I promptly froze one and prepared the other for our guest list of five. I froze the remaining sauce (the best part of the entire meal!) and can't wait to have it with the "spare" tenderloin! Served it with twice baked potatoes and green beans with carmelized red onions and it was scrumtious! Easy clean up and not much fuss!

This recipe is so easy to prepare and yet so delicious. I made most most of the ingredients the day ahead and then pan cooked the tenderloin. It was a big hit! A great find for the recipe box.

I am making this for the fourth year in a row for Christmas dinner. It's delicious and not too hard for a rank amateur such as myself. One word of cauton, do not let drunken relatives convince you the tenderloin is to rare and should be put back in the oven for a few more minutes. The meat continues to cook after it's out of the oven and you could end up with an expensive yet overdone piece of beef.

I used canned beef consomme instead of plain beef broth. To save a step, I made a roux with the 3 tbsp. butter and flour with about 4 or 5 tbsp. of fat and pan drippings right in the roasting pan. The sauce came together like velvet after the port/consomme/tomato paste reduction was incorporated and the last 3 tbsp. butter stirred in after it thickened. I crumbled the bacon and added it last. Be not afraid - this was my first beef tenderloin and it was perfection. All of my guests prefer med. rare, so I was concerned when I let the internal temp get over 130 degrees, but after resting 15 minutes, it was just right.

I highly recommend this recipe! I made this dish for a pre-Christmas dinner and my guests loved it. I only used 1/3 of the roasted shallots and substituted a good Cabernet for the Port but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Using beef tenderloin was costly but it was worth every penny. The sauce itself is superb - one you would find in the finest of restaurants. I will most definitely make this again and again.

This has become our Traditional Christmas Day Dinner. This is the third year it's on our menu. After all the fish and rich foods on the Eve at Ninni's; a meal of soup, pasta, and veal is more than we can handle. This is an excellent dish that is quick and easy for gift opening day and satisfys a crowd. Sauce can be prepared the day before. Very easy clean up to prepare for more company.

This was scrumptious! I forgot to add the tomato paste to the gravy, and possibly other things as well, and I forgot to brown the tenderloin before putting it in the oven, and it was still yummy, so it be an even better recipie that I think. The cooking time was perfect.

I made this recipe last year for both Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve and received rave reviews. I am planning to make it again this year. Mashed potatoes are a must - to be sure to eat every last drop of gravy!

This recipe was marvelous. The sauce (with it's sweetness) makes the dish. Do use a quality bacon, cook well but don't charr. I roasted the bacon in a hot oven rather than stove top frying. Make sure you trim off the tough outer bits of the shallots. Serve with garlic roast mashed red bliss potatoes w/ arugula and green beans.

Absolutely Delicious!!!I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved. Even the kids had seconds. I used a good Port and an apple smoked bacon - it turned out simply divine. The sauce was excellent. An easy recipe and a quick cook time made it a winner over any turkey for the holidays.

I made this for an informal dinner party. Instead of tenderloin, I used a roast beef (I can't remember the cut) The sauce is a savory addition. It makes an everday roast really special. I found it hard to scoop the fat off the pan so I poured the broth and the drippings into a fat separator to make the gravy. Still turned out great.

This is sooooooo good! I'm telling you that beef lovers will absolutely fall in love with this. I substituted a nice rich Melot for the Port but the finished product was terrific. This is a great recipe.

Loved this dish! I made it for the first time for an intimate 40th anniversary dinner party. It was a big hit! I cut the recipe in half. Also, due to availability, I had to purchase fillets instead of a single tenderloin. Never fear, I simply tied the 5 fillets together with kitchen twine and voila! No Sweat!

My guests and I loved this dish - especially the sauce, of course! It was relatively easy to make and any left-over sauce can be frozen and reheats well for future steak dinners.

My guests and I thought this was fantastic. I made half the recipe and it turned out great. I used both canned beef broth and canned vegetable broth, skipped the tomato paste and the sauce was wonderful.

This is a wonderful dish. My guests loved it and continually raved throughout the meal. I think I'll try a different twist next time with the sauce and use Merlot instead of the port.

Rating: 2
The end result was delicious, but it was a lot more work than it sounded when reading the recipe. I cut the measurements way down to make enough for just me and my husband, but the number of shallots was still way beyond what I like. I also just prepared 2 filet mignons instead of the beef tenderloin. Much less expensive for 2 people.

Rating: 2
This recipe was an awful lot of work. I probably made it worse for myself by making homemade beef broth. My husband thought it was delicious. Follow the directions exactly as to when the roast is done. I cooked mine an extra 10 minutes and it was at least 5 minutes overdone. Next time I'd just make plain old gravy.

Rating: 4
The cook from Long Island is correct--this dish is very expensive to make--so, if you're going to do it, do it properly and don't skimp on any of the ingredients. This has become my new "traditional" Christmas dinner. It's sooo rich that I serve very simple sides with it,like a green salad, mashed potatos,steamed vegetables, etc. I wish I could afford to make it more than once a year!

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Two things make it even better: 1. Pepper the shallots HEAVILY before roasting; it helps give depth to the gravy and, 2. please don't skimp on your bacon, quantity and quality. Use a real quality bacon, not standard supermarket fare. You're spending around $100 between the beef and the port, an extra $15 for REAL bacon won't hurt. And cook a lot of it. One of the pleasures of preparing this meal is snacking on the crispy bacon pieces. You need to have some left for the gravy. Serve with baked sweet potatoes. Leftovers, over buttered egg noodles.

Rating: 2
I cut down the beef broth and added water to eliminate some of the salt. My husband enjoyed this so I will make it again. The sauce was very light. This is a good dish with a rich side dish - I made it with scalloped potatoes with three cheeses.

Rating: 4
The steps made it easy and so making roasted garlic mashed potatoes and a vegetable fit right in with serving everything hot at once. BUT since when does 125 degrees mean medium rare?? With spending this much for a roast, I didn't want to fool with the recipe on the first try. Next time I will go with the low sodium broth.

Rating: 2
We did not care for the sweet flavor of the port in this recipe. Next time I will try making this with merlot or cabernet. I made it with filet mignons for 2 people, so I had to reduce the recipe a lot. Maybe I was a little heavy-handed with the port. I also added garlic cloves with the shallots.

Rating: 4
I made this for Valentine's day for my husband and we both thought it was wonderful. I cooked four small filets instead and used a grill pan on the stove (in the same pan in which I cooked the bacon). Very easy to do since the recipe could be broken down into steps. Served with Yukon Gold Mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. Also made the Vanilla bean and Ginger Creme Brulee for dessert from this site. Oh my, could barely breath after all that food but a fabulous meal.

Restaurant quality sauce. My husband bought 2 filet mignons instead of whole tenderloins and we cut everything down by @1/6 in order to just serve 2. Truly excellent.

This recipe is amazing!!!!! It didn't really take too long to make, and the flavors were incredible. I roasted some garlic with the shallots and it turned out very well. I think that next time, I will not add the bacon to the sauce because it added a strange texture. (It would be even better as a smooth sauce.) The recipe does produce a lot of sauce, so I froze the extra and reheated it on the stove about a week later when I made another roast. --- The sauce was even better the second time! And it was great over the roast and smashed potatoes.

I would like to make this dish for a dinner here in London, but unfortunately, with the BSE problems, we are not eating much beef. Has anyone tried this with lamb?

This is a wonderful dish! I made this for Christmas Eve for 19 people (used two tenderloins and doubled the rest of the recipe). It was outstanding and not terribly difficult to make. The sauce was especially good. Note in doubling the recipe, I took some earlier "reviews" advice and did not double the shallots, just added 5 or 10 more to the original.

This was wonderful!! My mother and I made this recipe with pork instead of beef. We went to the store and the beef was $60! Pork is an excellent substitution. We served with green beans with almonds and bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. A beatiful presentation and a very simple, easy recipe.

The sauce IS the dish. I made the recipe using pork instead of beef tenderloin and it came out wonderful. The sauce does tend to be a tiny bit salty since it reduces so much but you can always substitute a low-sodium broth. Will definitely make it again for a special occasion since there is quite a bit of prep work involved.

I made this for my annual formal Christmas dinner for eight. It was wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the sauce, which I did not find at all salty...but I used an organic no salt stock so perhaps that was the difference. Served with the potato shitake gratin and green beans with carrots, preceded by a sweet potato soup as it was presented and followed by several elegant desserts. All were happy. The only reason I wouldn't make again is that I rarely repeat recipes!

Made this for a sit-down dinner for 12. VERY good. No need to double the sauce recipe. Three 3 lb. tenderloins would be sufficient for 12 people (50 mins for medium). The sauce was salty but I thought it worked well with the dish. I added a splash of tawny port (use Old Cave - it's the best) to the sauce at the end. Surprisingly, the sauce had no port flavor so don't be shy of this recipe. I served this with mashed potatoes with goat cheese (December 2000, RSVP, p. 56) and doubled the recipe unnecessarily. I cut the potatoes into squares for beautiful presentation. You can make them ahead too. Also served with candied carrots with balsamic vinegar, same issue -- PERFECT! (Garnish plate with watercress...) I agree a full-bodied wine would go best with this meal. Don't pour a red zinfadel with this.

WONDERFUL recipe. This recipe has one of the best sauces ever. I was able to scale this down to just two people (made it for my husband's birthday). I didn't have beef broth around so I just used chicken broth and it was fine. Sauce definitely didn't need any additional salt beyond what's in the broth since it reduces so much. Served this with baked potatoes (with sour cream and blue cheese) and sauteed spinach. Can't wait to use this for guests.

I made this dish for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I liked the make-ahead aspects of the recipe because I like to spend time with my guests and not be chained to my stove. I even browned the tenderloin ahead of time so all I had to do was toss it into the oven when my guests came. Make extra--my guests ate above and beyond the call of duty!

Outstanding. Like other cooks, I cut back on the shallots. I like the saltiness of regular broth - suits the dish. Watch the meat carefully as overcooking brings down the flavour and texture of the terderloin quite a bit. I get rave reviews with this one.

Cook the tenderlion any way you want, it's the sauce that is spectacular! Once again those I cooked for, thought of me as a gourmet chef!

what can I say that hasn't already be said??? this dish was so easy, as was the sauce, and yet so fabulous. my husband (who has tried every sauce there is) hailed it amongst the best he has had (and our 14 guests agreed). I had a large party so I made three tenderloins, but this makes a lot of sauce, so I did not double the recipe.

Rating: 4
I have made this dish four times, each time with greater success. I changed the broth to low-salt broth and I roasted the shallots and bacon together in the oven. The flavors infuse better that way. (Once I was low on beef broth and mixed 3 parts beef low-salt broth and one part low-salt vegetable broth and a serious amount of hearty red wine. After it boiled down, it was fabulous.) The sauce is rather time consuming, but is one of the finest sauces I have recreated from your files.

This is a fantastic special-occasion treat. We cut the recipe in half to serve four, and used 6 oz. shallots, which seemed just right. We were full, but still found room for some Black Bottom Chocolate Pie, also on this website, and although we're all now paying diet consequences, we agreed that both recipes were wonderful and definitely worth repeating.

I found this dish to be quite unremarkable. Not bad, but not worth doing again. When I prepare something as pricey as beef tenderloin, I want the sauce to be spectacular. If you decide to make it, try to find reduced sodium broth because otherwise it is a bit salty.

This is INCREDIBLE!! I have made it three different times and it turned out fabulous every single time. The sauce is VERY rich but well worth the calories.

If you want to impress someone, this is the dish to serve.
