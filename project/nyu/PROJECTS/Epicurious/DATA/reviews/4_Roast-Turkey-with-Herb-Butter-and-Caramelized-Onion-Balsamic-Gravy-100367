I only made the gravy recipe and it is spectacular. Definitely the best gravy I've ever tasted.

This was fabulous but we used a different method for cooking the turkey. First off we spatchcocked the turkey and dry brined it in the fridge using half the chopped herbs/salt under the skin for 2 days. We followed a wpost recipe(butterflied turkey roasting times) as a guide for that and cooking times. I will never cook a turkey the normal way again! It had crispy golden skin and was cooked perfectly in 2 hrs! :) We continued on with the remaining butter baste and gravy from this recipe. The gravy was DIVINE! Will be using this every year!

This has become my go-to roast turkey. The balsamic and caramelized onions in the gravy bring a complex and lovely flavor to this dish that plays well with a good cranberry sauce. It's an "almost" traditional gravy that is a lot of fun.

This review is for the gravy only. MAKE IT. This past thanksgiving I volunteered to make the gravy while my friend made the turkey. I followed the recipe verbatim and the result was truly spectacular. Guests were using it on everything and no one could figure out what the 'accent' flavor was. The (high quality) balsamic vinegar made this gravy truly exceptional. It was, in fact, so good, that I made it again a few days later, and used it as a base for a wintry onion & mushroom soup. So good!

This is hands down the best turkey recipe that I ahve ever made. For ten years, I have patiently wended my way through various recipes from Bon Appetit magazine and the epicurious site and this is my all time favorite. The gravy is finger licking good and the turkey is so moist, so succulent that guests rave and return for more. 2010 will be my 3rd time in but not my last. :) Epicurious rocks!!!

Absolutely exquisite! This will be my happily forever after Christmas turkey recipe. I brined the turkey for 20 hrs. in salt & molasses water, followed by walnut oil and white wine injections. Basted in every 20 mins. End result was complete moistness.

Rating: 4
Like many here, I've made this recipe for my family for almost 10 years now. Spreading the butter mixture between the breast skin and meat as well as on surface works well. Brining the turkey the day before makes a big difference too. (Rinse turkey in cold water, dissolve 2 cups table salt in 2 gallons of water and brine for ~6-8 hours in the refrigerator, rinse turkey with cold water, pat dry and place on rack in refrigerator 8 hours/overnite).

I have made this for the past four thanksgivings with my family, and for christmas last year with my cousins. I'm seeing my cousins this year as well, and the first thing they asked me on the phone was, "can you please make that gravy again? It was fantastic!" Everything from the balsamic to the onions adds such an interesting touch to the gravy - delicious!!

I have made this turkey for T'giving since it appeared in BA in 2003. Unbeatable!

If you're tired of traditional gravy, this is a really delicious twist on it. The balsamic makes it dark and very flavorful. It had such bold flavor that I almost didn't need the cranberry sauce. Very different from regular gravy.

I only used the gravy recipe for gravy to go with roasted duck. I changed a few things: obviously duck drippings, wheat flour changed to rice flour (gluten intolerant), left out the balsamic vinegar. Even with the changes, it was great. I will make it again and try it with other poultry.

I keep my dog eared copy of the original recipe in my "Thanksgiving" binder. It is a hit year after year. It has set the turkey bar so high that I have yet to find another recipe that is even worth testing as a possible replacement. The gravy is the best ever! We do brine our turkey before preparing it using this recipe. Don't know if that helps or not, but don't want to ruin a good thing.

I have been making this tukey for the past several years - and even my "don't do turkey" husband eats it, and the leftovers too (which only happens if you get a really big bird!) I follow the recipe - sort of - except I (double) the herb butter and cream it, and place it in a ziplock bag and shape into a log - and refrigerage it - then slice it and put under the skin. While roasting (under cheese cloth - remove last hour) I baste with extra chicken broth, white wine and the herb butter (alternating) every 30 - 45 minutes - LOT of work, but SO WORTH IT. Moist and jucy and lots of flavor. The gravy I do by the recipe and it is truly worth all the work. Can't wait until Thursday! :)[oops- forgot the forks]

I have made this recipe ever since it appeared in the magazine nine years ago. They love it and request it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I mince the onion in the gravy and put in only about half of the amount it calls for. That way the texture and presentation in more like a traditional gravy with an amazing flavor.

I made this recipe for the American Assoc. of Chile Thanksgiving lunch in Santiago. It was a show stopper with the Caramelized Onion and Chestnut Stuffing. And it's easy to follow. I rubbed the herb butter under the skin and had a pan of water under the rack on which the turkey was resting. I also tented the turkey breast with tin foil. My compatriots raved about the gravy. Actually they raved about the entire dish. The turkey looked fabulous too.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe but rubbed the butter under the skin as someone else suggested. Very little dripped out of the turkey while cooking so there was nothing with which to baste. I added water and butter to the pan to keep it from burning. The turkey was delicious and very moist; I would do that again. The gravy was good but I would not say outstanding. The onions were not nearly caramelized in 20 minutes but they were good. I recommend being generous on the herbs in the gravy otherwise it justs tastes like onion gravy. My guests said they loved the gravy but I have a ton left over.

Rating: 4
I made this for our family Xmas Day dinner and it was delicious. I rubbed a lot of the herb butter under the skin and roasted it breast side down most of the time. The gravy is outstanding. Our oven is probably off but 4 hours was not enough for our 15 pound turkey (I'd also stuffed it). The inside was still red and we could only eat the outside meat.

This has become a family tradition and we have used it every year since published. Superb flavors and gravy! Just don't overcook the turkey.

Rating: 4
Turkey and gravy were wonderful. Didn't have sage, so left it out, still great. Cut up the orange I had zested and put it in the cavity (as I was baking stuffing separately). I think the herb butter added a great flavor to the turkey, and the meat was so moist it was falling apart. I always contemplate brining the bird, but I don't know how it could have been more tender than this. And the gravy - heck, even if your turkey was dry and your stuffing was subpar, the gravy would make it taste fantastic. Can't say enough about the gravy, and I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the ease of making the gravy while the turkey is roasting - I really liked not having to rush about at the end. Overall, the best turkey and gravy I've ever made. The balsamaic vinegar definitely punches up the gravy, but not so much that is doesn't feel like a traditional meal - like mom used to make only better!!

A meal in itself! Very clean flavors. Next time, however, I'll dice the bread & sausage smaller. Everyone loved it for my recent Thanksgiving dinner for my Canadien friends.

The Gravy is a wonderful starter, very smooth and fragrant. I always make a buttermixture to go beween the skin and the turkeybreast: I brown a stick of butter until all the solids are nutty, cool the butter a bit down and then add the herbs I wish to use. The turkey turns out to be very moist and with this gravy delicous

I'm not as enthusiastic as other reviewers about the turkey (you've had one roast turkey, you've had'em all). BUT THE GRAVY--WOW! Obviously, you have to love onions for this one, but this recipe is so good we actually made some converts. While I like to try new recipes every year for Thanksgiving, everybody is already asking for this gravy again next year. Sounds good to me!

I paired this up with the wild mushroom and leek stuffing what a great combination! I too raised an eyebrow over the balsamic vinegar... but seeing as how I was braising my carrots with it I thought it would pair well... and it did!

My fiance (the Gravy-Man) made this for Thanksgiving Dinner this year. I was pretty sceptical - balsamic vinegar in gravy? But since I don't like gravy generally, he was in charge. Boy was I wrong! The results were spectacular - rave reviews and even I liked it. This one is going in the permanent file!

Rating: 3
My review is for the gravy only. The broth itself is the best I've ever made, and I'll use it for all future turkey gravies. It didn't hurt that I had extra necks and giblets (2 each) and added them. If I'd used all of the reduced balsamic vinegar, the gravy would have been way too sweet. Balsamic vinegars do seem to vary, so caution is advised. Another time I might remove some of the caramelized onion at the end, and add in some finely chopped giblets. All in all, a truly delicious gravy.

Rating: 3
I only made the gravy because we fried the turkey this year. The neck and giblets helped create a wonderful turkey stock. Because there were no pan drippings, I added a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar at the end. The gravy was wonderful! I'll make it again.

I made this for 2002 and am making it again for 2003. We all loved the rich flavor of the meat and the gravy is wonderful. For added flavor seperate the skin and meat on the breast, slip a few sprigs of rosemary and sage, orange peal and two tablespoons of butter( sliced into several smaller peices)under the skin. WONDERFUL

I've been cooking for at least 40 years and this is the best gravy I've ever made for the following reasons: its unbelievable taste, the fact that it can be made while the turkey is roasting, and the rich color that the balsamic vinegar brings to the final gravy. When I made it recently I put herbed butter under the skin, as suggested in a review - worked well. Thanks, Bon Appetit and reviewers!

Rating: 2
As other reviewers put it, the gravy was excellent...one of the best I've made. Sadly, the turkey itself was rather disappointing. The herb butter just didn't give the turkey much, making it rather tasteless without the gravy. I used a sage/rosemary stuffing which was splendid.

Rating: 3
I loved the Turkey- juicy, moist, flavorfull- but I wouldn't make the gravy with this turkey recipe again. I used half the balsamic called for and I thought it was still to strong (I love balsamic but I just didn't think it was a good match for the turkey.)

I served this turkey and gravy on a recent trip up to the Sierras. What a hit! The turkey was moist and tender and the gravy was incredible. Not only did the gravy taste fantastic, the balsamic vinegar gave it a great color. For a perfect turkey, make sure to use a meat thermometer.

I've made this recipe a few times now with rave results. One trick I added last time was in addition to the turkey baste was to make an herb butter using the same rosemary and sage, that I placed under the turkey skin. This helped keep the meat moist and allowed the herb flavours to really season the meat. Excellent!

This was an absolute hit last year. I think my family will fire me if I don't repeat it for Thanksgiving this year. Couldn't ask for more flavor. I always brine my turkey first which produces the most moist turkey imaginable. However, I will make the caramelized onions smaller this year. Just cutting in half and thinly slicing sorta makes the gravy hard to pour. Make it and bask in the glorious compliments from your guests!

I have followed a version of this recipe for every holiday turkey since I first saw the recipe & now my family begs for me to prepare turkey twice a year. The gravy makes it! No balsamic vinegar here, more onions, heavy cream. Baste with Lots of butter, and you'll find them sitting at the table 45 mins before the turkey's done- like at my place.

The turkey came out really well and the recipe was very clear and easy to follow. Although I cook a lot, it was the first turkey my husband and I have ever roasted, so ease was a big factor. After the first hour, our turkey had not yielded any juices so we had to improvise and baste with butter and chicken broth. Also, we had stuffed it with rosemary, sage, oregano and thyme from our garden, which turned out well. I'd make it again but it won't keep us from trying new turkey recipes.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving turkey - it was delicious and a crowd pleaser - people just couldn't get enough of the gravy!! I stuffed the inside of the turkey with a quartered orange and apple which helped keep it moist. I also pierced the breast in several places and put slivers of garlic in the slits and it flavored the breast wonderfully.

Why wasn't I as enthralled as everyone else? The turkey was undeniably good and the gravy was tasty, but I certainly wasn't as excited about it. Maybe I was looking forward to the traditional turkey gravy. I don't know. Would I make this again? Maybe. But I'm certainly in no hurry.

I am so glad that I decided to make this. I had a "backup" jar of gravy in the pantry just in case, but I never had to use it - this is so easy to make.

Everyone loves this recipe!!! This is my second year making this turkey and again it turned out great! My only problem with this turkey is that I don't have enough pan juices to baste. I use 1-2 cans of chicken broth to help baste the turkey. This creates plenty of yummy drippings to baste on the turkey and to make gravy. At my last dinner party my guests requested to take home the left over gravy....it was THAT good!!!

We made this 2 years ago, and now that my wife and I have the honor of making the turkey for the big day, we're going to make it again. Since the recipe obviously has a lot to do with flavoring the skin, I thought a ringing endorsement was that people were picking off the skin and saying things like, "I'm going to eat this, and I'm going to enjoy it!" And the gravy was called, "best I've ever had!" Only, this time, we got 7 lbs. more turkey than last time to make sure we have more leftovers.

I made the gravy from this recipe last year after realizing I did not have everything I needed Thanksgiving day to make my usual gravy.I did not make this turkey so I can't really comment on it.I actually made my turkey from a recipe in Sainsbury's which had the bird covered in fresh herbs and peppered bacon then set to cook covered and practically floating in Chablis. My gravy may have be a hair different owing to the different turkey recipe but the finished product was phenomenal! I've never been too big on brown gravy but this stuff was mind blowing! My Mother-in-law and I fought over what remained! There's an endorsement for you "Even my Mother-in-Law liked it"!

My fiance made this for Canadian Thanksgiving a few weeks ago and it was absolutely wonderful!! Hands down the best gravy I have ever had- I literally drank the leftovers once our guests left!!

I made this gravy in 1998 (Thanksgiving) when it first appeared in "Bon Appetit" and knew I'd found a winner. My wife insists that I make it every time we roast a turkey.

This is a basic turkey recipe but with some balsamic thrown in... and it doesn't work well. I made the reduced sauce, but didn't add it to the gravy because I sensed that it would be balsamic overkill. I made a sub-version with the vinegar, and I was right! The herb butter was quite good, and I liked the orange peel, but there is an absolutely outstanding recipe from Bon Appetit November 1994 called "Roast Turkey w/Maple Herb Butter" that is bar-none the best turkey recipe ever (inlcuding its roasting method)!

The turkey was fantastic!! Although my guests loved the gravy, I wasn't so impressed. I pureed the sauce to smooth out the onions and I think that was a mistake. I also wasn't too keen on the balsamic. Too sweet for my taste. Will use wine next year. I also used an Herbs d' Provence/butter rub under the skin, and beer basted the bird.

My first roasted turkey, my first gravy, my first Thanksgiving dinner (that I made) and it was fantastic! My boyfriend proclaimed it the best overall meal he's had - I served it with red bliss mashed potatoes, creamed pearl onions, green beans with mushrooms, butter muffins and a citrus, avocado and onion salad with a vinaigrette dressing. A ton of food but the unmistakable standouts were the turkey and the gravy! I don't know if I will ever try another.

One thing we do in addition to what's on the recipe is to mix up some chopped sage & rosemary with a stick of butter til smooth & massage that between the skin and the breast. With the gravy, we put it through a fine strainer to get all the flavor without the lumps of the onions.

Everyone loved it! They all wanted the recipe. The only difference is I didn't add the vinegar and only a portion of the turkey drippings. Also, I blended the gravy so that it would be smooth.

THe gravy makes the dish. I was able to make the gravy ahead up to the add pan drippings part, and freeze it, so I didnt have to fuss on thanksgiving. I just used 3 chicken backs to make the stock, instead of turkey neck etc. It was my first time making gravy, and turned out perfect.

This is the first turkey I've ever cooked and it looked absolutely gorgeous and everyone really enjoyed it. The gravy was also great and the balsamic vinegar spiced it up and added a nice color to it...I am not a fan of the traditional bland gravy.

I only made the gravy, and it was good, but the next time I make it, I'll watch how much vinegar I add, I think it depends on how you season the turkey, the pan juices might be too salty so, the next time I'll start with 1/2 the amount of the vinegar and add more if needed, however, that's just me, everyone at the table had great things to say about the gravy that I found "salty"!!! Go for it! I also used the "old fashion" cheese cloth to cover the turkey, the turkey was Super moist!, I basted it every 20-30 minutes, I also had some extra broth w/butter to baste the turkey, specially for the first 2 hours. (I used a different seasoning for the turkey)

This turkey was great! I added foil to the bird after about 90 minutes. Very moist and perfect! Everyone in my family (with the exception of my old fashioned Father) loved the gravy. The balsamic was too much for him. I would set aside some for those with tastes! I will definitely make this again.

Delicious recipe! I would be sure however, to add 1/2 the vinegar recommened, and taste before adding the second half. Def recommend though!

The gravy was very good- but you have to like it alittle different. I tasted the gravy, before I added the balsamic vinegar and it was OUTSTANDING-I loved it. I did add the vinegar, but next time, I'd do without the vinegar.

Very very good. I did turkey breast side down,put shallots and garlic under it, then turned over last hour.Basted often.I used less butter and salt,-there was still plenty of fat& salt and more spices. I used less butter in gravy too, made my own stock and added shallots, and less vinegar because I was worried. Next time, I'll keep it per recipe.

This was phenomenal. I was nervous cooking a turkey for first time and on top of that, I had a freebie-with-coupon generic turkey. However, it could not have been a more moist, succulent and flavorful turkey. We basted religiously every 30 minutes and covered it loosely with foil for the last hour since it was nice and brown. I also used tangerine rinds rather than orange. Everyone loved this and it was relatively easy to do.

I made this turkey with chestnut stuffing for the first time...for 25 people! It turned out wonderfully moist and delicious, I got rave reviews, and I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving since. Oh, I cook the turkey in a heavy aluminum foil tent, which I remove 40 minutes prior to the turkey being done. It helps keep the turkey so moist.

First time I cooked Thangsgiving dinner for the whole family. I got rave reviews especially on the turkey. I would make this again 100%!

EXCELLENT!! See my review of the Caramelized Onion & Chestnut Stuffing that compliments the turkey and gravy perfectly!! I made extra butter for the table, and I am now considered the official "Thanksgiving Host" for my entire family!! Very easy to prepare and definately worth the effort!! I highly recommend this one!

I made this for Thanksgiving and the wonderful aroma turned my vegetarian wife into a poultry eater again! We now make this with chicken. I beleive that the key is the basamic vinegar in the gravy along with freshh herbs.

This is fabulous. I made this for christmas dinner and everyone raved about it. The gravy was excellent and I loved all the fresh herbs.

Agree with everyone. This was great. Besides being delicious, I liked being able to make the gravy ahead of time. For a big meal, I'm always looking for things that DON'T have to be done at the last minute. This made everything else easier, and it was better, too! I love onions, and this used them to their fullest!

The gravy was yummy but I have to tell you what I did-After I did the onions and added the stock from the giblets I put the whole bit into the blender and zapped it! It was more like "traditional" gravy that my husband likes but the vinegar gave it a taste that was different but not definable. My daughter said that she didn't like the vinegar in it but she saw me putting it in (she's also 14). I thought it was wonderful and will definately make it again

My family loved this recipe! The turkey was wonderful and had great flavor. The gravy was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The balsamic was an unbelievable addition to the gravy... I was eating it with a spoon! If you're not crazy for balsamic vinegar, add it slowly to the gravy. But, even family members who don't like balsamic loved the flavor it gave to the gravy. This has become our traditional Thanksgiving turkey and gravy recipe. Thanks Epicurious!

I loveed this recipe. I was a little hesitant at first because the gravy seemed a little odd, but I decided to go for something different this Thanksgiving. My guests commented that they liked the "bite" from the balsamic vinegar. Incidentally, I added a cup of white wine as a substitute for one cup of the broth. It turned out beautifully!

Will become my standard T day turkey recipe. Bird is very easy to prepare and cook. Gravy recipe seems odd as you slice all those onions, but it is a welcome departure from the usual. You'll be toasted as a culinary genius.

Very good and tasty. Loved the gravy.

this is a delicious turkey. However, all that butter makes it brown rather quickly. The breast needs to be covered with foil for the first hour or so.

This turkey and gravy was unbe-freakin-lievable! It was the first Thanksgiving meal I've ever done "by myself", so I was a little wary -- I thought I might have been overextending myself. It turned out wonderfully. The turkey was tender and very moist. The gravy was not gloopy at all and had amazing flavor.

I made this last year for the first Thanksgiving that I ever hosted. It was fabulous, especially the gravy! It will most certainly be on my menu again this year. I highly recommend it and can't figure out where rikitiki's tastebuds are (see earlier review).

This recipe sounded very interesting and unlike the usual turkey "staples". Once it was made it tasted wonderful! The differing ingredients and tastes combined to create a very festive and crowd pleasing meal. I would not hesitate to recommend it to others. It will be on our thanksgiving table once again this year.

Absolutely outstanding, especially the gravy. Sure, it is a fair amount of work, but come on, it's Thanksgiving. If your are overwhelmed by more than four ingredients, plan on Thanksgiving at Denny's. This is a superb bird.

it sounded interesting and based on previous reviews, i had to try it. it was fine--no more or less. too much butter and too many steps for a gravy that just wasn't a "stand-out".

Excellent. Even my vegetarian guests commented on the great aroma. The best turkey and gravy EVER according to my husband.

According to my guesses, this turkey was the best they ever had, and specially the caramelized onion sauce. I served it with small carots and peas. The next day, I combined the left overs (turkey in small pieces, carots, peas and the sauce) and made a turkey pie. It was also the best I ever had.

This is turkey and gravy is excellent. The best roast turkey I have ever had.
