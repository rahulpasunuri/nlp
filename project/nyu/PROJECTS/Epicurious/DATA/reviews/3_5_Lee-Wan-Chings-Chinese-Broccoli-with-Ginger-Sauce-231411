No one mentioned in the reviews if they used Chinese broccoli or regular broccoli. I am wondering if it works well with regular broccoli. PS I love Grace Young's recipes and have her book.

I couldn't find ginger juice so I used ginger tea. It wasn't very flavorful, though the texture of the broccoli was perfect. I may try it again and add some fish sauce or something.

Finally! I made a sauce almost identical to the one served at my favourite chinese restaurant in Laval. I served this dish over fried chinese egg noodles (just like at the reataurant). This is going to be my once-a-week chinese "take-out". Thank you for having it on-line.

Make this all the time. Easy and addictive for broccoli lovers.

To get ginger juice put the ginger in a garlic press.

I had trouble getting the ginger out of the microplane grater to squeeze into ginger juice. Eventually, I turned on the tap and ran some water over the top of the grater and into a small bowl. Tossed the ginger water right into the mix and it tasted great. Very quick, too. Next time I may try running the broth down the grater so I don't end up diluting the recipe. Tasted great regardless.

Best Chinese sauce I've ever made! I doubled the sauce and threw in some mushrooms, garlic, and red peppers with the broccoli, then served it with fried tofu and brown rice -- not authentic, sure, but a great easy meal for 2 hungry people (3-4 if they aren't so hungry). I had to add salt at the end, but that's probably just because I added all those things.

Very delicious and very authentic. Ginger is definitely the dominate flavor, although that could be because I used fresh ginger instead of ginger juice. This is just like qingchao broccoli you'd get from a restaurant in China!

Simple, delicious side dish. Double it if you want decent servings. I used a vegetarian chicken bouillon from an asian grocery store (Harvest brand.) Next time I'll try doctoring it up to make with fresh rice noodles.

I make this dish all the time. I serve it over steamed rice and with some grilled chicken. Subtle flavor but tasty and good for you.
