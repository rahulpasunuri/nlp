Really good. My company enjoyed it a lot. I made it in a 10 inch skillet and it came out fine. Put a ring of apples down (peeled side down) and then fit another ring of apples into the first layer (pointy side down) to make a nice base of apples to put the batter on top of.

I only put down one layer of apples and it came out very nicely. I made this cake twice and the first time the apples didn't show up very well. The second time I pushed the apple slices down gently into the sugar and it turned out much prettier. I omitted the 1/3 cup ginger in the cake and instead used the same amount of chopped apple (my audience is not a fan of ginger). The ginger on top of the apples gave it enough flavor, although if the rest of the ginger was used I'm sure it wouldn't have been too much. I used a springform pan for one, but found that a 10" skillet works well in a pinch. Overall a very nice, moist cake.

This cake is to die for. Like every upside down cake, it came out caramelized and delicious when you flip it over, and the ginger flavor is very nice with the apples. I substituted demerara sugar in the topping and used 1/2 white, 1/2 demerara in the cake (because I was out of brown) and it was nice and rich -- with the 1 hour cook time, all the crystallized sugar melted up fine. I also made it in an 8x8 glass pan, and only used about 1/2 the amount of apples it called for, sliced thin. I would definitely make it again if I have crystallized ginger around.

Excellent recipe - I have made this for years! Definately time consuming, but worth it. I'm a big fan of ginger so will usually up the amounts a lot (maybe the Cook from Miami will consider this - I also buy all of my spices from Penzey's or Spice House; they have "ginger nibs" which are great for this recipe. Finding good quality ginger definitely makes a difference). For special occasions I will sprinkle 1/4 cup or so dried cranberries in the prepared pan (after spreading the cooked butter/sugar mixture, before laying down the apples) - very holiday-esque, esp. when garnished with additional slivered/flared sliced candied ginger and fresh mint. :)

I make upside-down cakes all the time and this is the worst I've ever seen. The batter proportions are wrong. It is not thick enough.

This cake tasted fine -- like any apple cake -- but was nothing special. In particular, I got no play from the ginger at all. Maybe my ingredients were below par -- both powdered ginger and crystallized ginger were not distinguished, despite a top brand (Spice Islands). But I wouldn't bother to make the cake again; it just didn't surpass ordinary. The cake did look beautiful. I used a spring form pan, wrapped in aluminaum foil, and it came away nicely, leaving a lovely fruit pattern. For those who try the cake, I suggest cooking the sugar syrup longer than the prescribed three minutes; mine was still grainy.

Phenomenal recipe! This cake dazzled my dinner guests tonight. The presentation was beautiful and the taste a delight! Four forks! I'll make it again for certain!

A delicious recipe. It is perfect as a brunch dish. However, I did vary it a bit, adding about 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, cutting the butter in half and adding a little cinnamon.

I've been asked for this recipe several times which is a testement to it's tastiness. The topping ingredients can be cut by half. Not the quickest to put together but WELL worth the time.

Although it tasted very good, this cake was not very visually pleasing. I followed the directions to the letter, but when I turned the cake over and on to the platter, I could not see the apples at all. The top of it just looked like the bottom of a brown cake. It was also fairly flat. It tastes great, but it's too much trouble to make for company when they're not even going to be impressed by the presentation. Pass on this one.

I loved how this cake came out. I agree that the ingredients were right on. The ginger in the cake needs to be minced very well. I will make this again for a Thanksgiving dessert. It looked beatiful.

This was a delicious, spicy, old-fashioned cake. It had a great presentation with the apple topping and even the cake itself was artistic when cut! A wonderful cake for apple-lovers like me!

This is an excellent cake. I served it for a guest and had a friend call and invite herself to my house so that I could make the cake for her too! I personally find it a little too sweet for my taste, but I did like the intense ginger flavor. I plan to make it frequently. Because of the amount of people I planned to serve it to, I baked the cake in a 9"x13" dish for about 30min. It turned out great.

This is a delicious, not too sweet, version of an upside-down cake. Easy to make and beautiful to present. It's a perfect desert for a pork entree. The temperature and time are right on.
