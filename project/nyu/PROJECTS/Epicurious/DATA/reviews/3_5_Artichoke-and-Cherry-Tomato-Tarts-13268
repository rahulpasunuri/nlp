Easy, elegant appetizer. I add a little more the thyme and add pepper.

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe. I really felt that it lacked flavor. It was pretty to look at (it reminded me of something in a European bakery), but I felt that the sauce needed more.

I was so excited to make this recipe after reading the fabulous reviews, but I'm afraid the final product didn't do much for me. Although it's hard to go wrong with delicious puff pastry, I found the egg yolk/sour cream "filling" for these little tarts to be very bland and not a very tasty companion for lovely artichoke hearts.

This is delicious; however, I think it would be even better with regular (not marinated) artichoke hearts. My daughter disliked the vinegar taste. Also, next time I'm going to try this recipe with crumbled feta cheese rather than with the sour cream mixture.

For such an easy, quick recipe, my lunch club cohorts were amazed by this delicious entree.

I used a 2 inch flower cookie cutter for the pastry for smaller portions. I also rinsed the marinated artichoke hearts and chopped them to fit. It was delicious.

Made this twice - always a big hit. I cut squares in to 2 inch pieces and serve as appetizers

Very pretty and very tasty. Easy to make but I think we would have preferred using unmarinated artichokes. It was a little too vinegary. Making the portions smaller might make the taste not quite so tart.

Served these at a brunch. I cut each sheet of puff pastry into ninths, to make squares about 2.5" x 2.5". Instead of just using cherry tomatos, I used thinly sliced orange and yellow hothouse tomatoes for a bit of color. Very easy, very tasty!
