This was good but I can't review in complete fairness because I made a few substitutions... didn't have green onions so I used 1/2 a sweet onion. I didn't want to open a new bottle of wine for just 1/3c so I did an awful thing and used cooking wine. Also left out the tomato, cut back on the dried dill and added a dash of red pepper flakes. The last thing I did differently is I roasted the salmon in the oven instead of cutting into pieces and cooking on the stovetop. Had no desire to stink up my whole house. As I said this was pretty good but would probably try something different next time.

This dish was wonderful and so easy to make. I enjoyed every bit of it. My only concession was that I had to use red wine because I did not have a dry white wine. I also sprinkled on a few red pepper flakes, but the dish would have been great without it.

I was really happy to see this recipe because I had all the ingredients (except the salmon). Was very disappointed. The flavors just did not go well together, had to load it up with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes to even make it edible. Green onions overpowered. Threw out what we didn't manage to eat.

I made this for the family, but would not recommend with little kids. The capers were too strong. Also I used whole wheat penne.

As others have mentioned, this is a great way to dress up a lower quality salmon or salmon that needs to be used. I think fresh dill is a must and I would reduce the cooking time a bit so that the tomatoes keep a bit better. I doubled the garlic, added red pepper flakes, used spinach pasta, added toasted pinenuts and lots of parm. Great week night dish!

I love this recipe! I began making it in 1994 when my kids were little and they loved it. They are now young adults, and I've lost my original magazine with the recipe. Over the years I've made it from memory (give or take an item or two), but I was thrilled to find the actual recipe on line so I can begin to make it correctly again. Bon Appetit!

This dish was fantastic! Most salmon and pasta dishes call for smoked salmon so I was pleased to find this one, especially as I had all the ingredients on hand. I confess this dish was made the more memorable because I made it on a Sunday and took the time to make my linguine from scratch! I also subsitituted marsala for the white wine and couldn't have been happier with the result!

we loved it here, too -- using left over grilled salmon. we used shallots in place of the green onions, and used more wine since the noodles took awhile. rave reviews! will cook again.

I didn't love this recipe. Like one of the posters mentioned, there are a lot of different flavors going on here. And yet I still thought it was surprisingly bland. On the plus side, this dish LOOKS fantastic, is easy to prepare, and is pretty healthy.

Excellent! I made it with some leftover grilled salmon steaks (shredded and added shortly before the end of the cooking) and served with homemade linguine...can't wait to try it again. Fast, easy, and delicious!

I substituted left-over cooked salmon and sliced cherry tomatoes and the dish was a big hit! I had the cold left-overs(not much)for a wonderful lunch the next day! I will definitely be making this again and have already sent it to several friends! As my husband said, "A real keeper"!

This was very tasty. Wish there had been company for dinner. I used drained, canned diced tomatoes, a small onion diced fine and red pepper flakes. Never would have imagined the combination of ingredients would have created such a pleasurable meal.

This is my husband's all-time favorite dish! I cooked it for him a few years ago soon after I met him, and I have made it at least 50 times since then! I don't usually like salmon much, but I enjoy it in this recipe. And it is very easy to make, and quite healthy.

This was a fabulous Sunday nite supper!! I had leftover grilled salmon & my son who only wants pasta if I add pancetta. I also substituted shallots for the green onions (my kids believe they're eating only garlic!!). I LOVED this....

Rating: 4
Nice, quick meal. I used fusilli and a few red pepper flakes. We are fortunate to have salmon in our freezer left over from fishing last season and this is a good way to fix salmon that's a little "past it's prime".

I love capers and any fish. I did add some pepper flakes, and a couple of tablespoons of cream (couldn't resist).

Rating: 1
This dish has way too many strong flavored ingredients competing against each other... Wine vs.lemon juice,garlic vs.onions,capers vs.dill... More is not always better! Taste like something I might have at a bad trendy restaurant.

Great dish - my husband rated it a 10!

This was very tasty. I did not alter the recipe at all but will add red pepper flakes the next time to add a little zip. I had cold leftovers the next day which were even better than the day I prepared it! This would make an excellent cold pasta salad dish with a rotini or shell pasta. My salmon was partially frozen allowing for easy skin removal as well as cubing it.

Absolutely loved this! I used less oil, added broccoli to the mushrooms, and used both fresh chives and green onions... Served with garlic and asiago ravioli instead of linguine. Will definitely add this recipe to my collection!

Rating: 4
Tried this recipe with some of the changes made by previous cooks (2T oil, no mushrooms, penne pasta). Absolutely great! My 16 year old daughter (rather picky eater) loved this dish.Used a Kenwood winery Sauvignon Blanc and served it with hot french bread. Will definitely make it again!

Great! Fast and easy. A great blend of flavors. We will eat it again and again. My toddler and pre-schooler loved it also.

This dish turned out terrific with a few of the suggestions mentioned by other cooks previously: red pepper flakes, reduction in the olive oil and fresh parmesan sprinkled on top. Substitute Penne for the linguine. I also added a little butter in the end to thicken the sauce and a bit of Emeril's seasoning.

Easy and good, but not great. With the many great recipes out there for pasta dishes and salmon, I likely won't make this again.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful easy dish. I seasoned the salmon with lemon pepper, and added some dried red pepper to the mix while cooking- as others had previously suggested. I put a little grated asiago cheese over the individual servings. Yum. My husband loved it too. Served it with some cheese bread and a nice Pinot Grigio. Perfect Friday-night meal to wind down the week.

Great and easy! Used Salmon that had been seasoned and broiled on the grill (from the night before) and chives from the garden instead of green onions. On advice of previous reviewer, used only 2T of olive oil. Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was delicious. Would definitely repeat! My husband loved it.

GREAT...cut back on the olive oil, skip the green onions, add red pepper flakes with the tomatoes and used penne in place of linguine. This made a great presentation...served with pinot grigio, and followed with a salad, fantastic meal...thanks

I improvised with what I had in the kitchen and thought it tasted fabulous. I used some lemon pepper to season the salmon. Instead of a fresh tomato I used canned, diced tomatoes, and an onion instead of green onions. I also added some hot garlic chilli to liven it up and was very generous with the dill.

Rating: 4
This recipe works much better if you marinate the salmon in Italian dressing for a few minutes, grill it, break it up into chunks, with whatever little bit of marinade is left; then add it to the completed dish and toss it through. I always use penne for this dish, and usually don't use either mushrooms or dill.

What a wonderful blend of flavors and a rich sauce. A superb way to use up the day-old sashimi. I will definitely make this dish again.

Rating: 1
This recipe had so many different ingredients, yet no one real taste came through. I too thickened the sauce with constarch (1/2 tsp), but still not enough sauce. My husband really liked it, as did my 17 son. Why waste good salmon? Won't bother again

This was the only salmon pasta recipe I could find that didn't have a cream sauce. It turned out pretty well for a healthier lower-fat meal. My only complaint is that I was expecting it to be flavorful (it smelled wonderful!) but it didn't have a whole lot of taste, so I added red pepper flakes like the other reviewers recommended.

Rating: 3
This dish turned out scrumptous(!) and with little guilt. I used only half the olive oil(2T.)and a white port wine on hand which may have given it a sweeter essence. Also, I added a small amount of cornstarch rue to tighten up the sauce. The capers are essential. I will make this dish again. Very good!

Rating: 3
So I didn't have linguini on hand...I used spaghettini. I also didn't measure anything exactly...But it was very tasty anyway. It is a light, delicious, low-cal meal and I will probably make it again...when I've run out of other recipes :-)

Rating: 4
Great recipe. It was easy and quick. Like many of the reviewers, I added some cream and red pepper flakes and it made the sauce more flavorful and creamy. I did not have dill, but I put in some rosemary and it turned out well. I will definitely make this again.

Although it made a beautiful presentation, the flavors in this dish were rather ordinary. The capers perked it up a bit, but the dill and wine did not really come through. I have a much more exciting salmon and linguine recipe, so I won't bother with this one again.

baked my salmon first-to get skin off easy.to the sauce i added 2tbs of butter,red pepper flakes,and a small carton of light cream,also only used 1/2 a lemon,and skipped the dill and the salt, it was superb,my husband and i loved it.i also used whole wheat linguine,we dont eat the other one since we try to find ways to add fiber to our diet.i think this would also be great with butterflied shrimp,or scallops.

Although I didn't have the capers (I wish I had)and I didn't use mushrooms or dill, this was still great. I used frozen pieces of Salmon and it was done in a flash. Great for a mid-week treat or a weekend meal.

Fantastic! Very easy to make and tastes like it's straight out of a top restaurant!

I had some leftover grilled salmon which I chunked and added to the dish. Didn't have any green onions, so used diced red onion. Didn't have linguine - used short fat rigatoni. I confess to adding a bit of cream to the sauce at the end. Red pepper flakes were helpful. It was a fine dish, especially for a weeknight and being made starting with leftover fish.

Rating: 2
I agree with the first reviewer. This dish was quite good but not outstanding. I chose it because it was much healthier. It's hard to find a salmon pasta recipe without cream. I felt that it was missing a little zing to it. I added a small amount of red pepper flakes and that helped a little. Next time, I will experiment a little with this recipe.

Rating: 3
Delicious. I found that a sprinkling of Romano really adds to the dish.

I prepared this dish with fresh homegrown tomatoes and it was delicious! I chose to grill the salmon which I had marinated in olive oil and blackened fish seasoning. Once it was cooked I broke it into pieces and tossed it with the pasta and dill. Don't leave out the capers - they make the dish! Even my teenage daughter loved it!

It was good, but not special. I may rerate it when I can get "real" summer tomatoes. Healthy combination of salmon and tomato which is what I was looking for.
