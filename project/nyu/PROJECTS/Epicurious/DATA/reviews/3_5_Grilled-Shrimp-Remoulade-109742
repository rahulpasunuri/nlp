I made this recipe with shrimp and scallops. It was wonderful, lots of great flavor, not too spicy. I do agree with the other reviewers about the amount of oil used. I cut mine in half and probably will even reduce it further next time. If you do the remoulade ahead of time, this is a very quick meal on the grill.

This was great, I followed the recipe just about exactly and broiled the shrimp. I did trim the amount of oil a bit. One problem I had: even though I added probably more paprika than was called for, I couldn't get the remoulade to be as red as it is in the picture.

Serve this shrimp room temperature with cold "Creamy Coleslaw" and hot "Smoked-Sausage and Okra Dirty Rice," all from the August 2004 Gourmet. I served this meal at a party and every single person asked me for all of the recipes.

I loved this recipe when I first decided to make it, but I was running out of time and simply made the sauce and mixed it with precooked shelled (tail on) shrimp for an appetizer. Rave reviews for such a simple dish. I used 4 lbs. shrimp with the same amount of sauce, which makes it less oily, and I used the food processor to blend mustard, vinegar, oil, and parsley (emulsifies it nicely). A keeper!

One of the best tasting and easiest appitizers ever.

Excellent. I made it just as described and it was wonderful. The trick to keep it from seeming oily is to whisk the oil in while pouring it in a small steady stream. This fully incorporates the oil with he vinegar base and allows the full richness of the oil without the oily texture. I think this sauce would be good on firm white fish too.

I liked this sauce a lot. Different, interesting and flavorful. I took another reviewers advice and used less oil and it still was pretty oily so I might reduce it even further next time. Being basically lazy, I deshelled the shrimp before grilling them and I don't think they came out tough at all. I've had to struggle with stuck shells after grilling shrimp in the shell and didn't want to deal with that hassle. But, all in all a new addition to my shrimp repetoire.

Utterly fantastic! I made it exactly as directed - and was marvelous. I did the whole suggested menu from Gourmet & all of it was perfect: Dirty rice and Creamy Coleslaw... Yum! Definitely start with the screwdrivers! Hahha!

These shrimp tasted great but I think the sauce was too oily. Next time I'll cut the oil in half- in both the sauce and the marinade. These would make a great appetizer too!

First of all I think I grilled the shrimp just a little bit too long. Then when I put the cooked shrimp in the sauce I never took the shells off first. Also, I put it over angel hair pasta which I think was a mistake. When it came down to eating it I couldn't easily peel the shrimp because overcooking it made the shells stick. It was just too much of a hassle to eat. But the overall flavor was good. Very spicy. I think I will have to try it again without the pasta and by peeling the shells before I put it in the sauce.

Excellent. Wouldn't change a thing. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I was searching for a recipe that did not contain garlic, to which my sister-in-law is allergic. I didn't realize how most of the recipes I use and am drawn to contain garlic. I'm glad I hit on this one - definetly a winner.
