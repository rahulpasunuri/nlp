I just made the pudding part of this recipe. It was really delicious. One warning: when you add the milk to the caramel it doesn't just "bubble" - it boils over pretty aggressively. As soon as the milk hit the caramel I had a really big mess all over the stove. Beware, and add the milk very gradually and use the deepest saucepan you have.

Not enough bang for your buck. All is true re multiple steps. I got it right but it is too bland and rich. Made ice box lemo pie from food and wine website for same dinner. That darn pie was devoured and totally stress free prep. Three quarters of this tart is sitting in my fridge congealing. Sigh. Probably best for true caramel aficionados.

I have made this many times, always to rave reviews. The taste and presentation, as many reviewers note, is spectacular. I would say to anyone making this for the first time: 1) don't skip toasting the almonds for the crust--not only does it impart great flavor but also a pretty, speckled color, and 2) there is always a moment after I pour the milk into the carmel and start stirring that I think the whole thing has gone to hell in a handbasket. It's tempting to cry at this point, go ahead, the tears may add depth to the pudding. But do keep stirring! Those carmel bits eventually combine and you'll be glad you didn't give up. This dessert is worth it! Just don't put your make-up on before you've got the thing in the fridge.

Sure, this is a bit laborious, but everything worth having is a bit of work! This is absolutely delicious and worth every bit of effort. I bake - - a lot -- and even if i didn't I could say that this is absolutely do-able by a novice, especially if the workload is divided. Do the crust a day (or two would be fine) in advance along with the brittle (use a Silpat mat for the brittle so there aren't any sticking issues). Freeze the crust, stick the brittle in the 'fridge in Tupperware (then pull the brittle out a few hours in advance to bring it to room temp). Make the pudding at noon-ish the day of and don't worry about it sogging up the crust if it sits for 6-8 hours; it'll be fine. DO use a large pot for the pudding as it bubbles ferociously and will bubble over if you just use a standard medium-sized pot; i let the pudding boil for about 3 minutes and it sets up beautifully. DO be sure and serve it w/ a bit of fleur de sel (or even kosher salt gives the same effect) and DO double the cream to 1 cup for nice, but not overly- voluminous, coverage. This is a crazy-good dessert that I'll continue to make when I want to WOW friends.

I found this to be a fussy recipe. I am an experienced baker but the crust stuck to the tart pan and we had to dig it out. The pudding was good but did not need a crust. The almond brittle was good but I paid $10 for fleur de sel which wasn't really necessary. I think pouring the pudding into little custard cups, topping with a little whipped cream and crushed nuts and serving with a crisp cookie would be just as delicious and a lot less time-consuming.

I really enjoyed this. I too think I will try pecans the next time, wasn't overly in love with the almonds. Mine didn't set as well so I will make sure I cook the filling a bit longer to make sure it's sturdy. But it definitely is fantastic.

caramel pudding came out a little soft but still cuts fine. nb: when I first melted the water and sugar for the pudding, it didn't melt evenly and looked like rock candy; no problem, just turned up the heat a bit and swirled a little more. then I put in the milk and all the sugar seized and hardened; no problem, just whisked till it all melted into the milk. seemed ruined twice but worked out fine. all in all, a pretty easy (if time-consuming) recipe. not too sweet (I may sweeten it a little more next time, and will double the vanilla in the pudding like someone else suggested for more depth, and may try toasting the almonds for topping or going with pecans altogether). still, recommended!

my friend made this pie for a dinner party. i couldn't stop thinking about it afterward. i had to have it! i went out and bought the magazine (before it was posted on epicurious) and it was a BIG hit both times i made it for guests. i had never made a pie/tart crust before or caramel or pudding but both turned out with no problem. the first time i made it i poured the hot caramel and almond out onto wax paper. the paper stuck to the almonds and i had to peel it off. that was the only hitch. this pie is worth all the steps!

Made this for dinner Saturday night with my in-laws and it was a big hit. I did the crust and pudding the day before, and the almond brittle and whipped cream the day of. There wasn't nearly as much whipped cream as in the photo - you'd have to at least double the amount in the recipe. All in all, it was very easy to make, although the caramel took longer than the 10 and 7 minutes in the recipe. Will certainly do again.

Okay, I've made this twice now. First with the almonds...second time with pecans. The pecan version wins hands down! I just think pecans compliment the flavor of caramel better than almonds. The flavors and textures of this dessert are fabulous! The whipped cream is not overly sweet so it lets the deep essence of the caramel pudding come thru. When combined with the texture of the crust and the crunchies on top...pure ambrosia! I had no problem with the pudding setting up. It does set up enough to cut it nicely. Ditto on doubling the whip cream. The amount called for barely covers the crust and looks nothing like the picture. Also, the recipe does not state to toast the nuts for the topping...I did, as they have a much better flavor. I've already got requests to make this again!

I admit that I slightly burnt the caramel after 8 minutes of cooking. Other than that, the recipe came out as described. However, I found the combination of flavors and textures really weird. I'm an okay baker and I was looking forward to this recipe - but I think it's a little avant garde. I actually threw the whole thing out and made the Cinnamon Apple Crumble Pie from this site, instead.

This was delicious, and time consuming but much easier than it looks. I used all the crust mixture, and doubled the whipped cream. A few people said the pudding didn't set up very well, so i mixed a half packet of unflavored gelatin in the 1/4 cup of milk that was mixed with the cornstarch and egg yolks. It worked perfectly-the pudding turned out kind of like a panna cotta. I'm not very good at presentation, and it was very beautiful to look at with very little effort. I'm sure I will make it over and over.

This was really tasty, and not that hard (and I am not too experienced with caramel). The pudding does not come out very firm, but certainly firm enough to cut the tart. I agree about increasing the amount of whipped cream if you plan to cover the tart with it. Also, I used all of the dough--I didn't remove the 1/4 cup the recipe suggested, because when I did, the crust seemed too thin. It worked out fine.

This recipe was a disaster. I bake. A lot. Wedding cakes. And I've never had a disaster the likes of this dessert. The crust was fine... the candied almonds seemed excessive, the whipped cream was, well, whipped cream... but the PUDDING. Ugh. It didn't set. Ever. It was dark amber, and I upped the cornstarch in the slurry to try to salvage it, but ended up tossing the whole mess. What a disappointment.

This was easy to make and so worth the praise. I made it for a dinner party--also with many other desserts--and this was the only first one to go. Guests were going crazy over this tart. It's a keeper. It looks beautiful and tastes amazing

A lovely looking tart. The crust is the best part. The pudding was okay.

Ditto everyone else's experience with the candied almonds. Our dinner guests discovered the extras in the kitchen and kept picking at them. I'll definitely do this one again. The recipe looks fussier than it actually is. The crust is very tasty and easy to work with, and the pudding filling would be great on its own as well as in the tart.

Candied almonds were a hit. Had a little trouble with the caramel for the pudding. Had to make it 2 times. The 1c of sugar to 1/3 water was too much sugar, it didn't caramelize, instead it was like rock candy. I used the caramel instructions for the almonds instead. Husband and kids loved it. A keeper.

This was truly delicious! The crust was quite good and easy to work with. The caramel pudding was sublime (I added 2X vanilla). Both of these were sweet, but not overly so. What really brought the dessert together, in my opinion, were the candied almonds on top, generating a sweet pudding sandwiched between two varieties of almond preparations. I provided whipped cream on the side. Overall, just fabulous!

I made this dessert on Christmas and it was the only one that people really went nuts over (and there were many desserts on the table). I heard comments such as, "This is possibly the best thing I have ever eaten in my entire life", and "You have a gift". I also noticed that as the desserts were being cleared away from the table, people were actually picking at the few remaining crumbs from the empty serving plate. In short, I have truly never seen such a unanimous positive reaction to one dish. The only change that I would make next time is to double the whipped cream recipe, because the amount of heavy cream that the recipe calls for only yields enough for a very thin layer of whipped cream. Also, I skipped the candied almonds. The tart is truly spectacular without it. The consistency of the tart is so light and delicate that it just melts in your mouth. In my opinion, this is dessert's answer to foie gras. I will make this again and again.

This was absolutely amazing!!! With all the desserts on the Christmas table, this was the only one that was completely gone, with people fighting over the last piece. The only thing I would change would be less whipped cream on top only because you couldn't get the full flavor of the DELICIOUS carmel pudding.

My guests ate this in the kind of rapt silence that lets you know for sure it's a hit! I left off the whipped cream and passed a bowl of creme fraiche with it instead; the pudding and crust are both quite sweet. I also passed the candied almonds with the tart instead of sprinkling over the top.

Easy to make, but always tricky when you do work with caramel because of the high temp. The taste is very delicate, just perfect. I love it and defenitely will make it again:)
