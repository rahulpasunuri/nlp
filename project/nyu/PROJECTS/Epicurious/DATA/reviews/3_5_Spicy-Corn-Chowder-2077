I liked this chowder, but I made the following modifications: I added celery (about 2 stalks) in with the rest of the vegetables. I doubled the amount of cumin and cayenne and also added salt and pepper when I added the other spices. I used 1 package of frozen corn and blended half of it into the milk and stock and then added the other half to the soup, but I think next time I would blend a bit less into the milk/stock mixture. To make up for the canned corn liquid, I also added stock until it reached my desired consistency. All in all, very good!

I've been making this soup for years. In fact, I started making it in the long-ago days when I was far more mindful of calories, so I've always used nonfat or 1% milk, and found that it still thickens nicely. I sometimes double the cayenne because I like spice and/or add some potatoes, but other than that I make it exactly as written. It's lovely and quick.

The flour added a gloppy taste and made it too thick. Otherwise, the flavour was good but not great.

I'm not a fan of SUPER spicy food, though I do like spice in moderation - this is a low heat food; not too spicy at all - in fact I may add more next time. I also: doubled the recipe, added 5 boiled creamer potatoes, and 4 pieces of chopped cooked bacon at the same time as the corn; to each individual bowl I add a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheddar and salt and pepper to taste. This will be a winter mainstay for us.It's cheap, tasty and hearty. I have a feeling it will freeze well too - but haven't tried yet. Definitely the flavors will intensify the following day.

As alischwee from Seattle said - adding a little corn starch to the 1% milk works like a champ. As advised by other reviewers (thank you), I added a can of white potatoes (which I know sounds weird but I wasn't in the mood to pre-cook them.) This is an awesome recipe and I would definitely recommend it though not for little ones who don't like spicy food yet (my 11 month old was not a fan :) )

Replaced Bell Peppers with roasted Hatch Green Chiles and potatoes, and used fresh corn which made for a rich, spicy flavor. Easy, very tasty.

This was great! I used non-fat milk and it was fine. I just whisked a little cornstarch into the milk first though. Potatos would have been a nice touch. Definitely double the recipe - this only made 2 servings. Yum!

Yum! This was great and really quick for a great tasting soup. I used frozen corn so increased the chicken broth slightly and added some salt. On the advice of previous reviews, I included a few Yukon gold potatoes and celery, but did not include the cumin. This one's a keeper!

Really enjoyed this chowder, although I added some extras like cooked chicken, celery, and a clove of garlic. Used a can of creamed corn, which provided a sweetness that complemented the spices wonderfully.

Rating: 4
Recently, I have been adding some small dice of yellow, and orange sweet peppers too, and I have been using a ground green chile powder from Hatch, NM and adding some leftover rotiserrie chicken chunks. I added some "creamers" to it twice now and will do this all the time for a entree soup/chowder. (Creamers are the very small red potatoes that have a very creamy texture and a delicous flavor for a potato. They go wonderfully with corn-on-the-cob, so I added them and they MAKE the soup/chowder into a feast of wonderful flavors!)

It's a great corn chowder recipe. I usually add potatoes and a jalapeno pepper with some crushed red pepper and skip the cumin. Everyone loves it.

Wonderful soup and very easy to prepare. I added the creamed corn as suggested by others and about a cup of cubed potatoes. I topped the soup just at serving time with a tablespoon of shredded pepper jack cheese and some chunks of avocado.

This was a hit at a dinner party last night! I doubled the recipe, and it was a little too thick for a 100 degree day, so I added an additional can of broth to thin slightly. I also used a can of Orig. Rotelle instead of the red and green pepper per another reviewer's suggestion. Topped with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheddar and crumbled bacon. (But you don't need it) Yum! This is a keeper!

Rating: 3
It was delicious! I took other reviewers advice and used one can of creamed corn and one of regular corn and a small can of diced green chiles. I also added a potato to give it some texture but it didn't really need it. I used 1% milk even though the recipes said not to, it came outt fine. Thick and delicious! And makes just enough for 2 with a little leftover. I hate having lots of leftovers.

This was wonderful. I added a little crab meat at the end. Also used homemade broth instead of canned or buillion. The broth didn't make that much of a difference.

simply put...good chowder. Will make again. I made this for a strict vegetarian. To do so, simply use vegetable broth instead of chicken. Still a good chowder.

I've got a reservation about rating things four forks, but this chowder probably deserves it. Really easy and a total hit. I've followed others' advice and added some chopped tomatoes. Another time I boiled some red potatoes and added them toward the end. I think the tomatoes lend a nicer color to the soup. I've made it four times in the last month. You really can't screw this one up, and I've tried. Once I added cans instead of cups of chicken broth, another time I forgot to add the flour until after the liquid. But it always winds up tasting great.

Wow-another winner! My husband raved about this soup and he is sometimes picky. can't wait to make it again ! The only thing i changed was I took the advice of another reviewer and added one cup of pepper jack cheese at the end-yummy!

Rating: 4
Lovely and quick. I don't know why the recipe is so adamant on not using low fat milk - I used 1% with a dollop of sour cream and it was great. Also, I had homemade chicken soup left over from another recipe, so I used it instead of canned, which definitely contributed to the yumminess of the final product. I used frozen corn instead of canned and it worked fine.

Rating: 4
Let me sing the praises of this chowder! It may be great as written but it is FANTASTIC with just a bit of tweaking. Half 2% milk, half evap milk made it very creamy. I sauteed some crabmeat with the onions, added some tabasco and hot pepper cheese at the end. Also substituted some chopped canned tomatos with green chiles for the bell peppers (less chopping and more flavorful). This had to be the best soup I've tasted in more years than I can count. Absolutely a first-rate chowder!!

Made this to take to a pot-luck and everyone loved it. I 'kicked up' the spiciness a bit, but it would have been just fine as is, too. Very good southwestern style soup. Yummy!

I experimented with this recipe, and everyone was pleased with the end result. Instead of using the red and green peppers, I used half of a can of Original Rotel (diced tomatoes and chiles)- it was cheaper and I had it on hand. Then I added about a half cup of shredded cheddar and some real bacon bits. The end result was spicy and rich. Delicious!

Excellent! Used a full can of veggie broth instead of chicken broth - seemed to need the extra few ounces of liquid as it was very thick. Also was generous with the cayenne and added a tablespoon of hot sauce. Big hit.

This was very tasty. I added a bit more of the cumin than it calls for, but we like extra spice and flavor. Very hearty and easy. Cornbread makes an excellent companion to this dish. Don't skimp on the cilantro either!

Made this recipe for the first time tonight. Did make some modifications, and it is a CHOWDER TO DIE FOR!!! EXCELLENT!!! First I nuked 10 oz. of frozen whole kernel corn until almost done and set it aside. Increased the diced peppers to about 3/4 cups of each one. Deleted the flour step, as I had about one cup of left over pre-cooked white rice (knew that adding this at the end would thicken it nicely, and it did). Increased the cumin to about 3/4 tsp. and the cayenne to about 3/8 tsp. Substituted a 12 oz. can of Carnation evaporated milk for the regular milk. Added the corn and rice at the very end and brought it to a boil. It turned out both sweet and spicy. Try this chowder!!! You won't be sorry.

I made a Southwestern variation of this chowder that was delicious! I used half cream corn and half whole-kernel and added 1 can black beans (drained and rinsed), 8 oz. jumbo lump crab meat, and 1 can diced green chiles. I also spiced it up with some extra cayenne and cilantro. Yummy!

I've made this dish three times for clients, having to cut the cayenne in half. Had to increase the liquid by 2, in order to get 4 main course servings. Very tasty, but needs reworking on amounts of liquid as a main course meal.

An excellent recipe to start from. I substituted celery and carrots for bell peppers because of taste and items on hand. Has the good fortune of having fresh frozen corn on hand. Ended up using at least 1 1/2 cups more liquids though! YUM

I used vegetable broth, frozen corn and a can of condensed milk instead of the chicken broth, canned corn and regular milk. I also added 1-2 diced potatoes, depending on the size of the potatoes and added with the other veggies. If you want to add more southwest flavor and a kick, add a small can of green chilies. I doubled the recipe, but used olive oil instead of the second stick of margarine. This recipe turned out to be rather tasteful and have made it twice so far. The third time I made this dish, I used a cajan spice mix and added cubed tofu with with the milk for added protein.

Good and very simple/fast to make. Regarding the review saying it wasn't sweet enough, I guess since its "Spicy" corn chowder, I wasn't expecting it to be sweet. You may wish to try a different recipe if you desire sweet. For a savory chowder, this was great.

What DIDN'T I do to this recipe? I decided to double it,but didn't want all the butter and milk, so I substituted chicken broth. I used a combination of frozen corn and creamed corn to thicken it.We like heat, so I went ahead and doubled the cayenne. WOW! I wound up diluting w/more chicken broth-lot's of chicken broth.I diced and par-cooked 2 potatoes seperately, then pureed a portion for consistancy.My husband grilled chicken breasts, which I shredded and added, as well.This STILL wound up being one of the most delightful soups I've ever tasted which proves you just can't blow it.

Rating: 2
the recipe was fairly thin tasting and not as sweet as i thought corn chowder should be. i added 1/4 cup of honey at the end to liven it up and it worked quite well. i also used my stick blender and gave it a whip while still in the pot to give it a smoother texture. could use some salt as well.

Rating: 4
OH MY GOODNESS. This recipe is so easy and fast, and allows for so many modifications depending on personal taste. I didn't have any bell peppers, so I used some zucchini I got at the farmer's market, and it was just as good (if not better) than the corn chowder I had at Whitehouse Crawford (walla walla's finest dining). DEFINITLY MAKE IT.

I made this for myself (vegetarian) and my two carnivorous roommates and we all loved it. i subsituted the chicken broth with vegetable and used skim milk. i also added some potatoes. the results were excellent!

Rating: 3
Fantastic dish, very easy to make. I concur with the substitution of half cream corn and half frozen, as with the adobo sauce. Also, I cubed some russet potatoes, boiled them until just firm, then added them with the flour. It gives the soup a little more heft if you're making it as a main course. Bay leaf would be good, and the soup likes a friendly amount of salt to bring out the flavors.

Yummy. Wonderful when you need something quick and easy that will satisfy that craving for comfort food. I used lowfat milk as that was all I had in the house (one of the great things with this recipe is that you are likely to have most all of it in your home kitchen) and it was fine. And Bravo to the cook who suggested the chipotle. I tried it and it gave it a great kick.

Very, Very Good! I defatted some by reducing the butter by half and used skim milk. Substituting frozen corn and a can of creamed corn for the canned corn made it creamy and rich.

Quick, hearty, inexpensive soup. After longing for a certain Mexican corn chowder I enjoyed at a brunch years ago, this recipe satisfied my chowder need. I've since made this recipe several times and it always comes out a winner. Blending with an immersion blender improves the texture and marries the flavors nicely.
