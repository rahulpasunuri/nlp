Amazing presentation every time! Super easy to put together. I served it at a summer birthday party along with Dr. Pepper cake (from the Dinosaur BBQ, Syracuse, NY) and the two went really well together.

my bombe fell apart when i tried to take it out of the bowl it was frozen in. other than that, this recipe is a keeper! delicious and easy to make. i used vanilla ice cream instead of strawberry as my guests are not fans, and it turned out wonderfully.

So easy and beautiful to serve. Have used all ice cream layers and done as a Baked Alaska but original is more refreshing.
