This is a fantastic way of cooking lambchops beyond the usual grilling or broiling. The crust seals in the juices and becomes lightly crisp while the chop absorbs the aroma of the spices and stays very tender. You can serve it with moroccan sides but it also goes well with indian dishes. (I served it this time with palak paneer and oven-roasted butternut squash. Next time I'm planning on a couscous pilaf with currants and almonds) The spice blend is very fragrant and not at all overwhelming or jarring. I can't imagine what one of the previous reviewers did to make the breading soggy, except using the wrong type of dish. If you put the chops in a baking dish with sides, the heat might not be direct enough to produce a crust; instead they would steam the breadcrumbs and become soggy. I put them on the broiler tray and it came out perfectly.

I have made this many times and our whole family just love lamb chops prepared this way. I sometimes use dried bread crumbs and get wonderful results.......a yummy recipe!

This recipe was terrific - we loved the flavors and the texture. I had no problem with the crust, which crisped and browned beautifully (don't know what the previous reviewer's problem was. I served it with couscous, and a mediterranean salad w/oranges, pine nuts and kalamata olives and it made a lovely meal. I've recommended it to friends.

They really need a zero fork rating. This was horrendous! My goodness how can someone think these flavors go together with lamb. They do not. Orange just makes it wierd and the breadcrumbs did not crisp, so even that part was blah. Okay, okay you are saying why so harsh! Because you need to try another recipe for lamb, and Epicurious does have them. Do a search on rack of lamb with caramelized shallot and thyme crust and you will taste a match to die for. I will tell you what I did to make the process even more interestin in my review there.

I served this dish at a birthday party and got excellent reviews. It looks difficult, but took less than 45 minutes to make.

This is fast, easy and excellent meal. My husband and I love it! Even without the orange zest.

Wonderful combination of flavors! The chops were moist and not at all greasy. I added 1 tsp. of chopped fresh rosemary - it worked well with the orange peel and garlic.
