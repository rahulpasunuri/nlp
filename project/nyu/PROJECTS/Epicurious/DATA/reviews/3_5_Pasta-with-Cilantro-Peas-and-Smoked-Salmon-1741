Easy, fresh, delicious ... this sauce is the perfect summer pasta dish. I made it exactly per the recipe, served it on Ohio City Pasta's freshly made Spicy Lime Cilantro pasta, and it was out of this world.

This is a stranqe collection of flavors. I followed other reviewers advice and used less cilantro and less cream. I am glad I did because the cilantro is strong. I only had 4 oz of smoked salmon. It could have used more. My husband liked it but I would not make it again

Scratching my head-- just not sure what I did wrong, but this dish just didn't have much flavor. Only possibilities I can think of are that 1) my jalapeno was too small? or 2) my 3 cups of cilantro was not as firmly packed as they should have been-- it was 2 big bunches, though. I added more lime juice, salt and pepper, which helped make it palatable. Hate to be the contrarian, but I would not make this dish again. I have used epicurious for years, and this is the first time my experience with a dish has been so different from those of the majority of reviewers. Hm.

It was this recipe that introduced me to Epicurious.com! A couple had me over for dinner in Sacramento, Ca and among other delicious dishes they served this gem. That was five years ago. Since then I have tried to replicate the dish on several occasions&but always have a temperature issue. Is the pasta served warm? But what about the smoked salmon, then it cooks a bit and loses the freshness of the smoked salmon. Last night I made the nth attempt, but this time I used smoked salmon filet instead of sliced. I cut the filet in small chunks, this allowed it to warm up with the pasta without the smoked flavor being lost. A little pricey, but well worth it. It turned out AMAZING!! My Italian boyfriend couldnt have enough&and hes very picky about his pasta sauces. Great recipe!!

The sauce is delicious. I made it with Greek yogurt instead of whipping cream and it came out deliciously rich and creamy but still light with the tang of yogurt. I think the sauce (made with yogurt) would make an excellent marinade for chicken kebabs.

This is superb. The sauce is ingenious--garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, whipped cream, and lime juice. You could eat it alone and skip the peas and salmon if you wanted, but I loved it altogether.

i took the advice in the comments before making this dish and used 1/3 the garlic and substituting chicken stock for 1/2 the whipping cream, and it turned out really great. all 5 of my guests loved it. oh i also used way more salmon than it called for, because i knew 1/4 lb was not NEARLY enough. I used 1 1/3 lbs, and it seemed just right. i don't usually cook with whipping cream, but this was so good i will make it again!

This is fabulous. I've adapted it too. Using less whipped cream and substituted it with chicken stock and milk. I used fresh salmon. It was great!!!

The garlic COMPLETELY overwhelmed this dish. If I make it again, I would cut back on the garlic considerably. Otherwise, my family liked the dish and the interesting combination of flavors.

I loved this recipe. So easy, fast, and tasty! I used 1/2 cup cream and 1/4 cup chicken broth (to save some fat and calories!), then doubled the jalapeno and lime juice to kick it up.

This was fabulous..I added extra lime juice and a little jalapeno hot sauce (didn't have a fresh one). Very popular with the family.

It's a lot of flavor, like everyone else says. I used regular salmon instead of smoked, however, and thought the flavors were a little better.

This is one of our favorite fast pasta recipes. Great flavor with the jalapeno, lime, cilantro and smoked salmon.

My wife is huge cilantro fan, but this recipe didn't even make her want more. Very powerful tastes. The smoked salmon and cilantro were fighting each other to win while the cream just sat there not able to contribute enough to make much of a difference. It just didn't seem that these ingredients wanted to be together.

I would make this recipe again, but not too often as the flavors are really strong - you need to be in the mood for the garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, and salmon! I added 1T course grain dijon mustard to the sauce. I also used shell pasta rather than the bow-tie which holds the peas well, and also adds to the fish theme.

This recipe was fantastic but you have to like cilantro.

I took the recommendation of other reviewers and substituted fat-free half and half for the whipping cream. I think this is where the recipe went downhill for me; the sauce was VERY watery. Stick with the cream.

Even though I don't cook pasta too much, it was a nice break in the evening routine. The sauce was good. I think adding different veggies might make for a better dish. You might want to keep some extra salmon handy for the leftovers...my family is good at picking out the good stuff!

Excellent dish. Surprised how good it was warm. The sauce seems to be versatile enough to use in other dishes. We made ourselves save some for leftovers b/c it was go good!

I made this last night and it was excellent - I doubled the recipe, but only used 4 cups of cilantro ( vs. 6) and used more smoked salmon than called for, everyone loved it.

This was very tasty. The garlic, cilantro, smoked salmon...all were tastes we enjoy. I substituted light cream for heavy, zucchini for peas, but my husband asked for seconds! Super.

This is *delicious*. I've rarely had a nicer pasta dish. Great summer dish. I would double the salmon and halve the peas next time, but just a really nice recipe.

Rating: 4
This was so easy to make! I used a pound of pasta and did not increase the amount of sauce, which worked out great. I also took the recommendation of more smoked salmon, using half a pound of "garlic pepper" smoked salmon. My housemates all went back for more!

We liked this very much and it was extremely easy. I used Pacific style smoked salmon, which was good, but I'd recommend using more than the recipe calls for.

I've made this recipe countless times, and it is awesome! super-easy, and as other reviewers have noted, especially good as a spring or summer dish.

This was very good. I don't like bowties so I used campanelle, which was perfect, and I used fat-free half and half. The sauce came out very light, it didn't taste heavy or rich at all--it just barely coated the pasta and was very fresh-tasting. It would be a perfect dish for spring. (It's Very green.) I'd definitely make it again if I had smoked salmon lying around.

This was quite tasty and pretty easy to prepare - next time though, my pea-hating husband asked that I cut down on the amount of peas in the recipe. Also, since both of us are smoked salmon lovers, we think the recipe needs more smoked salmon.
