I made this dish according to the recipe and liked it but didn't go crazy over it. But we will make it again.

Wonderfully colorful and an interesting combination of flavors, I used this with my Christmas dinner. It was unusual and tasty enough to elicit comments (says something when the entree it competed with was an awesome prime rib!). I added toasted pine nuts to great effect, and had to substitute kale since I couldn't find chard. Great combo of flavors.

Delicious and easy. I nuked the chopped chard for about 2 1/2 minutes instead of blanching--so much easier. The addition of the pine nuts was key. I also added some diced red onion, which I cooked down a bit before throwing in the garlic and chard. This is a keeper.

I am in accord with the pine nuts. A nice touch. Didn't try cranberries as they were otherwise represented in the T'giving menu. We get chard here with many different colored stems - red, yellow, white, orange etc. Just could not let them go to waste. Anywhere the stem looks tough, below and between the leaves, trim them off and slice them very thin. Saute separately in olive oil until they are soft (this will take a while but they will get there) and reserve in a bowl. Follow the rest of the recipe as given. Before serving the sauted leaves, heat up the stems in the microwave. To serve, center the chard leaves on the serving plate and arrange the sauteed stems around the leaves. The whole plate is colorful and delicious.
