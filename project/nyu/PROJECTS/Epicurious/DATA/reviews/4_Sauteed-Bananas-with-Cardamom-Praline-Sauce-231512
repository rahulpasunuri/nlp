I can't stop making this dessert. The whole thing is easy to make and I love having a use for my more ripe bananas. I love the sauce. I've been using the sauce on pancakes, mixing it with a little syrup.

Soo easy and really yummy. I used 1tbs to fry two bananas but I kept the sauce the same as I like lots of sauce. I increased the cardamom to 1/2tsp.

Super easy and very tasty. I give this 4 forks for good taste relative to ease of making. This is a great dessert for casual get togethers. I added other fruits as well - strawberries, blackberries, nectarines. The sauce broke a bit so it didn't look that great, but that may have been my fault. Served with Haagen Daz brown sugar ice cream (OMG was that good) and Blue Bunny vanilla.

Easy and deliciously different dessert. Loved it.

In deference to our arteries I substituted margarine and canned milk for the butter and cream, and it was still delicious!

It was easy to make and we will make again for a dinner party. We found it to be refreshing and light.

Great and fast! I used the sauce only, adding pecans, over cake. Mmmm!

This was fast and easy to make. You might just have what you need in the kitchen. I used heavy cream, but I'd try half and half if need be.

Amazing! I made the praline sauce ahead of time by a couple hours and served it cool over the bananas and ice cream. I added alot of cardamom and I forgot to add the lime, but everyone raved about it. Wonderful combination of flavors.

This is one of the best desserts ever. Add some vanilla ice cream, and wow! The sauce is my favorite. You cannot go wrong with this!

Really delicious and easy to make. I love cardamom so I added more like a 1/2 tablespoon. It gave it a great flavor, like an Indian sweet.

Loved it! It takes no time to make, and everybody raved. I served it in martini glasses for a different look.

This recipe was wonderful and it is hard to believe that it is so simple to make. Even the kids got in on this one. I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead of the cardamon as someone else suggested and it was delightful. Ingredients can be found all year round, that is a plus up here in Montana.

Surprisingly delicious. I doubled the cardamom, but the taste wasn't really discernible,so I'll increase it next time. Served it with vanilla frozen yogurt.

Absolutely divine. We couldn't find any cardamom around, so we used a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger, and it turned out fabulous. Can't praise this dish enough.

I made this for my husband and I and we loved it! This is a recipe for 4 but I found that we didn't have enough praline sauce for four people, you may want to double the sauce recipe. It was very good and I would make it again!

I tried this recipe from the magazine for my husband and myself and found it to be very easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. Since the recipe was for 4 servings, I had enough praline sauce to make it again the next day. I found that the sauce was better cold the next day. It didn't disappear into the ice cream and had a stronger flavor. A real keeper. I'll make it often for family. It's really not pretty enough for company unless you are having a casual dinner.
