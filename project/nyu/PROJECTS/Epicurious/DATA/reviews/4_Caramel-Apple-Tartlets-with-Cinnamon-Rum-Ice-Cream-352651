I loved this tart. I made it for my friends at work and they thought it was fantastic. I make a new treat for them every week and they thought this was one of the best!! The crust was a little hard but very tasty. I used European Butter. I also made this in a 9" inch tart pan.

I liked this tart, but the crust was moon-rock hard. I followed the directions to a "T" and I have lots of experience making pastry. It was impossible to cut, even with a steak knife. My guests ate the filling, which was wonderful. Especially the caramel sauce. The crust remained in the tartlet pans because we could not chisel it out. I expect it will soak in my sink for a few days before it releases grip on the tartlet pans. I will make this again, but with a different crust. Too bad about this dinner party finale!

Easy and scrumptious. I made all of the components a day ahead of time and assembled and baked the tart right before a dinner party. I did not use small tart pans, but made one large 9" tart. The proportions still worked perfectly. Great for a fall menu. Matched deliciously with a Gewurztraminer.

YUM! These were great! I halved the recipe since i only have 4 tartlet pans (made 3 tarts). This is all so easy to make ahead of time, and each component doesn't really take that long. I even made the filling part about 4 hours ahead and just kept it in the fridge. The only change maybe would to precook the crust less next time. they were a little dark and then had to go back into the oven with the filling for another 25 minutes - it got a little hard. Loved the ice cream!

Execllent!! As it says in the recipe, it is worth the effort. I made all the components a day ahead and baked them as individual tartlets. The were perfect for dinner guests. The tartness from the GS apples, with the sweet caramel and the buttery crust was a great combination. Will definately make again.

This recipe deserves a big thumbs up! I also use a big tart pan and it turned out just fine.

My family was so excited while eating this. It does take a while so allow yourself the time, but it is well worth it. I made it in one big tart pan and it turned out great! I will make this from now on instead of an apple pie. The crust is crisp and flaky and the caramel sauce and apples are delish!!!!
