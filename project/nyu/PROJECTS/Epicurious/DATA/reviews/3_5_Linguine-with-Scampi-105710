Way yummy! Few tweaks: more garlic, lemon juice & red pepper. Went 1/2c butter, 1/2c olive oil & 1/3 c Pinot Grigio. Replaced parsley with basil and added it at the very last minute along with a sprinkle of sea salt. My husband said I could make that anytime!

This recipe was disappointing to me. I followed the suggestions of some critics, using a combo of butter and oil, omitted the zest, and added 1/4 cup of wine. However, the recipe was bland, so I added some spices at the end. Also, five to seven minutes is a long time to cook the shrimp. I removed the shrimp after just a few minutes and let the garlic mixture simmer for a few more minutes. I feel there are more delicious recipes for scampi than this one.

Excellent and so easy. Don't forget to add the white wine, I used dry sherry as that was all that I had on hand. Add a little olive oil in a medium high skillet, then the butter, then the pressed fresh garlic and shrimp. The use of wine will not only enhance the taste, but you can cut down on the amount of butter and oil used if you are concerned about fat grams. I also think lemon juice without the zest is better.

I adjusted to what Rockettodd added. So good! My boyfriend tells me to make it all the time (let's have something different! I say). And if you don't measusre the spice too much it comes out different (still just as good) every time. I will have to try with chicken to share with all I know who don't like shrimp/seafood.

Fairly bland even with the addition of some herbs & spices, more garlic & about a quarter cup of a good white wine. I'm still looking for that elusive high-powered scampi recipe.

Combined this with other recipe to receive RAVE reviews. Cut butter to 1 stick and added 1/2 ts of Red Pepper flakes, 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup of Parmesean. Very easy and company could not stop talking about it. Also added chopped asparagus for color and texture.

Wow. Even my wife, who turns her nose up at buttery scampi dishes, loved this. Our 14-year-old daughter cleaned her plate, too. We tweaked the recipe at bit, though. Taking a lead from other reviewers, we used the one-stick-of-butter-and-quarter-cup olive oil approach. We love lots of flavor, so we tripled the amount of garlic and doubled the amounts of lemon zest, lemon juice and red pepper flake. I also added a half-cup of Pinot Grigio, and instead of flat-leaf parsley, we used chopped basil, tarragon and thyme from our herb garden. And in a nod to another reviewer, we served the dish on plates covered with fresh spinach leaves and toasted pine nuts. An outstanding idea! The mound of tossed linguini scampi presented well on the spinach leaves, and we topped it with shaved Reggiano Parmesan and some more chopped homegrown herbs. All in all, it was ridiculously good, and the spinach and pine nuts made it really rewarding to get to the bottom of the plate. We will definitely do this one again.

I followed the suggestion of many others using 1 stick of butter and 1/4c olive oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious. I meant to add some white wine as suggested, but then just forgot. I might try that next time, so thanks for the advice. I agree, that peeling and deveining the shrimp was the only time consuming part of the preparation, but I will probably stick with uncooked shrimp. I am not sure if using cooked shrimp to start would change the taste and texture of the dish. Peeling the shrimp wasn't that bad. Actually, the nice thing about this recipe, is that once you have the shrimp and garlic prepared, cooking time is short so that if you are having a small dinner party, you can spend time with guests and have the meal ready at a very predictable time.

I served this to my husband, 18-yr-old daughter, 11-yr-old son, and my mother-in-law. We all LOVED it! I used the stick of butter & 1/4 cup olive oil as suggested but otherwise followed the recipe. The shrimp were cooked to perfection. Ignore the suggestions to broil the shrimp. That is an entirely different recipe. This is true shrimp scampi! The only time-consuming part was peeling & deveining the shrimp. Next time I'll use already peeled and deveined. Let someone else do the dirty work! Just don't overcook. Awesome dish. Everyone gave it four forks.

Broil the shrimp with butter garli8ca nd bread crumbs. Make the sauce seperate and combine after broiling shrimps. You can't get the flavor without broiling the shrimp.

I will stick to my old method as shrimps flavor is released by broiling: devein and butterfly shrimp and plac eon baking shee. Sor each shrimp aith buuter, chopped garlic and top with bread crumbs. Broil 3 minutes or less. Make a sauce by melting butter with garlic, squeezing in lemon juice and some S ANd P. add this when shrimp done from the broiler and serve over linguine. Can aded some white wine if sedired or sherry.

This is a good quick and easy recipe! Really a solid recipe that you can improvise according to your taste buds.As suggested I did not use as much butter and added some olive oil and that worked out fine! I also used a seafood medley of calamari, octopus, shrimp, clams, and mussels and added some white wine. I also toasted some pine nuts and tossed in some quickly satueed spinach. My family loved it! We will enjoy this one often. Restaurant quality for sure!

YUM!!! This was fast and easy. Especially since I cheated and used already peeled and deveined frozen shrimp. I too, added more garlic and used some olive oil in place of butter. I also skipped the lemon zest and used juice from a whole lemon with mushrooms and a splash of white wine. My kids and husband loved it. I personally would either lessen or omit the red pepper. I'm suppose to stay away from spice and my kids would rather it not be spicy.

Scrumptious! Everyone thought that they were at a five star restaurant. I took the other reviewers advice about adding more garlic, cutting the butter in half and adding about 1/4 C of olive oil - use garlic olive oil if you have it. I also added mushrooms. So fast and easy to make.

This scampi was on par with anything you'd get in a fancy restaurant. I followed the suggested modifications (1 stick butter, olive oil, white wine, 1/4 cup diced prosciutto, & a handful of sliced mushrooms) and it was out of this world! I also used basil/garlic linguine and it was as gorgeous as it was tasty - throw together a caesar salad and this is a great recipe for company!

It was very good but used too much butter. I modified it by adding prosciutto at the end before tossing with the linguine. Next time I would use some olive oil, less butter and toss with fresh thinly sliced basil. More garlic would help..softened in oil in the beginning before melting butter.

My wife and I loved the recipe. As someone else mentioned, I added red pepper for color. My lemon was large so I had a little bit too much. We are on the atkins diet so we skipped the pasta.

lemon zest was too bitter and way too much butter....must have been written with someone with a death wish that does not know how to cook...red pepper and black pepper was overkill wine was needed to carry the shrimp flavor acid of lemon was not a carrier

This lends itself well to adaptation. Olive oil can be substituted for all or part of the butter. The amount of either can be halved, and the resulting dryness corrected by adding some of the pasta cooking water to the finished product. Don't forget the salt and pepper. They're listed as ingredients, but never mentioned again in the instructions.

shrimp scampi with linguini Like several other posters, I found this dish far too heavy on the butter and lacking something. I added more shrimp, garlic, wine, vegetarian homemade stock,and a small amount of extra virgin olive oil. I also roasted some red bell peppers, which I peeled and diced just for some color and because they were around. I used less linguini,did not use chili pepper flakes, and it was o.k. My husband loved it; I would say it was all right, but I did alter the recipe.

Rating: 2
We are watching our weight, so conscience didn't permit the use of all that butter. I used white wine and low fat chicken broth with 2 tablespoons of butter instead. The combination of flavors, with garlic, lemon, FRESH parsley etc. was terrific. I wasn't satisfied with the consistency though. I like a richer sauce. I'm going to try this again using more chicken broth for a reduction.

I thought this was ok but it did not blow me away like the other reviewers. I think next time I will try using angel hair pasta instead of linguini. I will also use more lemon juice and adding wine.

Use only one stick of butter and a few pourings of olive oil. more lemon juice, more red pepper flakes, add a little white wine. remove shrimp when done cook down sauce adding a more garlic YUM and a pat of butter. throw shrimp back in before putting it on top of linguine. a glass of wine to drink and it's better at home!

I had been trying to find a recipe for lemon chicken like one of the popular chain restaurants serves and had been unable to find one. I came across this recipe and figured I would give it a try, substituting chiken breast for the shrimp. I wanted a strong lemon flavor, so I used the zest and juice of two lemons instead of just 1/2 of a lemon. I also topped it with fresh shredded parmesan. It was excellent, almost as good as the restaurant. I would definitely make it again, although I may add another lemon next time, the lemon flavor still wasn't quite strong enough for my taste. But overall, it's a great recipe.

A cook from Franklin, TN. I liked this recipe, it was very flavorful and the reduction of butter and addition of olive oil is excellent. However, I would caution cooks on how long they marinate the shrimp with the wine. I unwittingly marinated the shrimp too long, and the result unknown to me before cooking the dish was that I had in fact seviched (cooked) the shrimp, then cooked it again for the recipe. I would marinate for only 10 minutes. Also, dried dill is very nice spice with this. I also added Parmesan cheese at the very end - really was great!

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and I. This is a delicious, simple recipe. I did make some modifications. I reduced the amount of fat by 1/2 and used part butter, part olive oil. I also added fresh sugar snap peas at the very end. We both loved this recipe.

Yum! Made this two nights ago and had leftovers last night... even better the second time around as the linguine "marinated" in the wine, butter, and garlic (important to remove shrimp before reheating and mix back in prior to serving). Combined advice from several reviews such as soak the shrimp in white wine for 30 minutes; cut butter down to 1/2 cup + 1 T olive oil + 1/4 cup white wine; use a whole lemon (zest and juice). Will definitely make again!

This recipe was anything but 'dull'. I did take the advise of other reviewers to cut back on the butter. I used a small amount of olive oil, but in the end would not have missed it as one stick of butter was enough for me. I added a little more lemon zest and juice because I like the tanginess. I got very good comments from family and friends and plan to make it again tonight!

Just made it - followed other's advice and backed off the butter (did one stick and 1/3 cup olive oil). Also added some white wine, 2 extra cloves garlic and used a whole lemon. Served it with liberal Parmigiano-Reggiano - worked out magnificently. Take some previous advice though - add the parsley in the last couple of minutes (for better color).

Wow! This was really great. Confession: I used all the butter and it was fabulous. Based on other recommendations I added white wine, in my opinion it put the dish over the top. It made the sauce more flavorful and allowed me to control the consistency as I sauted the shrimp. Put the parsley in after you remove from the stove, it's much more colorful. Serve the meal on warm plates to keep the butter from congealing too quickly while eating.

I watched them do this on the tv show. My first reaction was, too much butter, where's the olive oil? It should be half and half. Then, how could they forget the white wine, (chardonnay or sauvignon blanc) it adds so much more flavor! I have made this before using a combination of scallops and shrimp, or sometimes just shrimp. I also added some half and half . The result is fabulous. And, how could they forget to add the parmesan? A pinch of cayenne, maybe. Looks like everybody else got it right but Epicurious!
