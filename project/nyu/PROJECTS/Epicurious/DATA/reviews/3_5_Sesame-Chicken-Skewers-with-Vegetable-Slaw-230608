Very good. Big hit at party last week. I could drink the dressing. The slaw was great. Recommend dressing the slaw just before serving to keep veggies crisp.

I've made this several times now, and it has been consistently a hit for those who ate it. Only thing I recommend is to dress the slaw with the marinade right before you are about to serve it to keep the veggies crisp. If you do that too far in advance, the veggies can become a bit soft and mushy even though it still tastes good.

I made this for my book club last night and it was the most requested recipe I made. Great flavors and a great change from the same old boring coleslaw. I will make this my standard coleslaw recipe from now on.

Great recipe, I used store slaw to save time and added the peppers. Goes well with the Japanese Sweet Potatoes and Scallion Butter.

Excellent! This is a keeper! Had them with bistro fries found on same site. Husband loved them. Quick and very flavorful.

I made this for a BBQ I hosted last weekend and everyone was crazy about it! I will be making it again soon because it disappeared so fast I didn't get to taste it myself!! I also did not make the slaw, but cut up one additional chicken breast and used all of the dressing as marinade, which I marinated overnight. Fantastic

This recipe was the hit of the party! Every last morsel was consumed. I did marinate the chicken for several hours in the fridge and then an hour at room temperature and it made all the difference, really infused the chicken. Delicious!

This recipe was absolutely delicious-loved by family and guests. I agree the chicken could use longer marinating time; we basted the skewers as they grilled with left over dressing. Served with fried rice seasoned with sesame oil, green onions and sesame seeds and an asian cucumber salad. Will definately make again!

super, easy, colorful, healthy. I used low sodium soy, preshredded veggies, and added cooked pasta for complete meal. Great hot or cold. Enjoy!

My family loved this recipe. I also used pre-shredded cole slaw. And to make it a main dish meal, I cooked up some fettucine, the only pasta I had in the house, cooled it under cold running water, and mixed it in with the slaw and dressing.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. To make short cuts I used pre-shreded coleslaw and I added cashews because I love texture in my food. I would like to try and marinate the chiken a little bit longer next time to increase flavor.I also did not have any ketchup so I used bbq sauce. This recipe will be filed away for future use!

I didn't make the slaw, but the chicken was very good. Served it with some rice and a green salad. I agree that while not spectacular, this dish is good and makes a great weeknight dinner.

The chicken didn't stand out enough with the salad. I did like the whole dish a lot - it just wasn't to die for.

This dish was great. I'd recommend not making the slaw too far in advance (they suggest up to 4 hours, which is too long)as the vegetables have such a high water content. I prefer the crunchiness of the slaw to accompany the chicken.
