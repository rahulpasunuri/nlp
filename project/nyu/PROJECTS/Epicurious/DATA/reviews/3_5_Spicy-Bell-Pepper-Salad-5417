Easy, tasty side for summer. I used a variety of finger peppers from the farmers market (anahiem, long greens, hungarian, etc) along with the bells. Also looks terrific on the table.

To the cook from Escondido: dill and caraway seeds is a delicious combination, very often found in Eastern European dishes. You don't understand this recipe at all. It even works with dried dill.

The onions were way too potent, even with 12 minutes in the pan, and that made them a bit soft. I'd recommend soaking the sliced onions in water for 20 minutes before proceeding. You could give the onions a couple more minutes in the pan than the peppers, but then they might get mushy. This dish just didn't have the right combination of flavors. What in the world are dill and caraway seeds doing in the same dish? I might make this again, but only with a serious overhaul.

I made this dish before reading any other reviews. I didn't have any caraway seeds so I used cumin, used orange instead of green peppers and sprinkled fresh parsley instead of dill. I served this with grilled skirt steak and it was a cool version of fajitas for a hot summer night. The ONLY thing I would do differently is slice the peppers into strips. The rings were fun but made stir-frying a challenge.

I made this recipe to accompany jambalaya for a Mardi Gras dinner. The jambalaya was so spicy that this seemed cool and refreshing by comparison! When I ate this dish the next day by itself, however, it was sweet and spicy with a lingering burn. Recipe Notes: I omitted the fresh dill at the end, and I used red, yellow, orange, and green peppers. The result was very colorful, and it makes great leftovers.

This dish was quite delicious. I made it to go with the crunchy chicken in green sauce, which was also yummy. Next time, I think I'll try with cumin seed instead of caraway seed to give it more of a southwest flavor. I can see this dish quickly becoming a favorite.

I loved the rich flavours of this recipe. It's become a summer staple, to make with farm fresh peppers. I've served it for family and guests on several occasionss. Delicious

I work in a restaurant where I'm always trying new salads. Everyone liked this salad, it had a "slow" burn and was tasty. I'm definately making it again. I added orange peppers and took out the green ones, it looked like a fire and added so much colour to my buffet!!
