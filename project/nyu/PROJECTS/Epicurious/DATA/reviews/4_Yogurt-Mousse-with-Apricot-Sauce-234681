Wonderful mousse~ used full fat greek yogurt cut recipe in 1/2 first time as test ---we couldn't stop eating it; great for breakfast parfaits too. Next batch willl add cardamon pods to V B let steep and rose flower water/syrup for more middle east flavor.

Does anyone know if the 32 oz of regular yogurt can truly by substituted with only 1 1/2 cups of Greek yogurt? I am about to make this recipe with Greek yogurt and really don't want to spend all the time and not use enough of the main stuff! Thanks! valentine.freeman@acehotel.com

I served this as a dessert for a Greek meal and it was a hit. The yogurt taste was light and refreshing, but I think it wasn't an obvious taste of "yogurt". I might try with vanilla essence instead of vanilla pods next time at least in the sauce; I felt the appearance with so many seeds in both the mousse and the sauce looked over the top. I also used peaches for the sauce, and it was delicious.

Thsi recipe was delicious. Even people who did not like yogurt enjoyed this dish. Although the instructions are daunting, the mousse is actually fairly simple to make, dont worry if you have lumps after folding, if you whisk it a little bit it will still set. I used greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt, which I felt gave a nicely tangy contrast to the sweetness of the fruit. I used vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean since I had none on hand and the flavor still came through well. Also, I made a peach sauce instead of a apricot one since I could not find any fresh apricots in stores. I imagine that nectarine would have gone well also. Just make sure to add the sugar to the fruit in batches, tasting as you go, so as not to over sugar the sauce.

For less adventurous audiences, call the mousse--cheesecake mousse. Exactly the flavor and you avoid spooking people averse to yogurt. This was perfect for my CSA apricots.

Disaster seemed imminent when I discovered halfway through that the heavy cream I'd earmarked for this recipe was almost gone. I decided to press on anyway and a good thing too. The resulting dessert was delicious. Not a mousse of course, more like a yogurt panna cotta but I thought it was very very good, especially together with the apricot sauce. Nice, light and refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. It also had the added benefit of being quite low in fat; I used lowfat milk as well (that was intentional). My kids didn't like it much, but we adults did. I will definitely make again without the cream.

I will be making this recipe for the second time today. The mousse is refreshing and light alone. The apricot is rich and complements the mousse well. I will try some alternative toppings too.

Delicious! Try to get Greek yogurt if you can. It makes the recipe easier and it adds great flavor. This mousse is very light and tastes great with the apricots. Our cooked apricots still held their shape even though they were tender so I gently mashed them with a potato masher. I think a variety of fruit compotes would be nice with this mousse.
