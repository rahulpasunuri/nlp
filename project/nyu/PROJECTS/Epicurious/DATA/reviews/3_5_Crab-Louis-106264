While this is very tasty, and would get higer points from me in a regular category, "Gourmet" dosnt work for me... I'm a little surprised that no-one has commented how similar the dressing is to tradtional 1000 Island - you do get a bit more say in the flavor by making it yourself however you can toss in a few ingredients to a store bought dressing - not knowing I made it and tasted it, I've never made my own and was quickly dissapointed to taste it knowing it was on sale at the store for less than the scallions alone - add a few spices and BOOM, we could have had the same thing for 5+$ less... Yes, it is good but epicurious "Gourmet" to me should equal phenominal, for me this was mis-categorized.... Just my 2 cents, Jeff http://52gourmetdishes.blogspot.com/2010/08/up-from-lowest-crab-louis-aka-louie.html

I did add the Grand Marnier like another cook suggested. Also, if you like a little "kick" add a tsp. of Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce.

Good recipe - but my mom (from Seattle) always made it with chopped celery instead of lettuce, and my family prefers it that way.

This is very similar to the louis dressing I have been making for years. I like to add finely chopped hard boiled eggs, minced celery and red bell pepper instead of the green olives. I also like white asparagus with the salad.

This is a classic version of a good old-school recipe. It's so old-school most people have never had it. They think you're just a craetive whiz in the kitchen. Of course, I told them the truth ;)

Tasting the dressing before putting it on the crab had me concerned. It was difficult imagining the two tastes together. But I was fooled! It was very tasty with the crab. If you like avocado, definitely add that to the salad. There was a lot of the dressing left over after use with 1 lb. crab so unless you think you'll use it with something else, you may want to cut the dressing recipe in half.

I only made the dressing and it was quite good.

Wow!!! I am in a hurry to make this again. I used the dressing with picked dungeness crab and did not bother with the salad.

I'd make this again tomorrow, it was so good. Perfect dressing, wonderful garnish.

Excellent version of wonderful old West Coast recipe which has gone out of fashion, but shouldn't have. Dressing is authentic and delicious (though I increased the lemon juice for more tang). For the salad, I set out a large bowl of lettuce (half iceberg and half romaine), and then platters of our marvelous, freshly-picked Alaska Dungeness crab, halved cherry tomatoes, wedges of hard boiled eggs, yellow pepper chunks, and avocado slices tossed lightly with lemon juice to keep from oxidizing. Served with loaves of garlic bread and lemon wedges to garnish. My crowd of adults and children ate all and begged for more.

Loved it! Tasted just like Mother used to make. Got a one pound can of crab at local good market, it only serves two in my house!

An easy, impressive looking, healthy, wonderful tasting and quick meal. You can prep ingredients ahead of time and assemble at the last minute. Add a loaf of sourdough and a bit of wine to the table and you have a gourmet meal. I got to enjoy my own dinner party! What more could I ask for in a recipe?

Nostalgia is the right word. My mom and mother-in-law both loved this salad and made it often when Dungeness crab was in season. Their version used pickle relish (no green olives). I was so happy to find this recipe because all I rememebred was mayo+ketchup+pickle relish + lemon juice! Mom added avocado slices, and I do too. I made the dressing as called for here and it was great..

I'm the kind of person who pours over recipes and reviews and things are usually slightly disappointing...This recipe was one of the exceptions. Made this for my bookclub and it was not only delicious, but gorgeous!. I set out a large bowl of greens and a huge platter lined with greens and topped with pickled asparagus, sliced hard boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, pickled beets, sliced avacados, sliced sweet green, yellow and orange peppers, a big bowl of fresh picked dungenous crab and another bowl of bay shrimp. Got rave reviews. The dressing is to die for..some of us have been having this salad without the crab on a week night when it's not available, and it's still wonderful...Try it!

Awesome salad and the dressing made it. It's a recipe that I wouldn't change a thing on. Try it, you'll love it!! I made the salad with king crab, shrimp, lettuce, eggs, cucumbers, olives and some small cheddar cheese chunks, plus tomatoes. Yum, Yum. Wish I could afford more crab to have it again tonight. The two of us only used half the dressing...

My Grandma used to live in San Francisco when she was in her 20s and remembered having the best Crab Louis of her life right here in SF. She recently came out here to visit me and I made her this recipe. I got fresh crab right off the boat in Half Moon Bay and it was well worth it. She loved it.

Delicious recipe, especially the dressing! Was very nostalgic for my husband who is from Seattle. We made it with dungeness crab for the ultimate pacific northwest experience.

have been looking for a REAL crab louie. this is perfect.

Rating: 4
this is a great recipe, if not for the ingredients for the nostalgicness (if that's a word) of it. Like the other person who reviewed, this recipe reminds me of the old days and my mom. Once in awhile she would take me to Rhode's Department Store in Tacoma and we'd have a crab or shrimp louie. It was the best thing I ever ate as a kid. I was actually glad to find the recipe when I looked. Not that I couldn't make it from memory but I was just curious if I could find it. So all you moms out there; Make this recipe for your kids, they'll never forget it!

This is so good, My Mother made this years ago, when we were living in Stockton Calif. She used shrimp, and so did I. Turns out great!!!!!!
