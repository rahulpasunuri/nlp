Delicious recipe! I love lemon so I did not mind the heavy lemon flavor, but you could probably get away with not adding the zest. I also added a touch of dijon, an extra clove of garlic, and just a little bit of honey.

Made this in a pan and turned out great! Will add it to my line up. So easy!

Love the recipe. I also used a grill pan rather than firing up the grill in the middle of winter. It has a nice tang and zip to it. Very simple to make but full of flavor. It will definitely become a weeknight regular.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe. I have used this sauce on chicken skewers for a bridal shower, on cutlets for a family dinner, and on tenders for a barbeque with friends. There has never been a single complaint from anyone I've ever servecd this to. Everyone loves it!

Good recipe that uses ingredients most people probably have already. I like to marinate the chicken with some garlic, olive oil and spices. I put a little honey in the sauce to cut the tartness of the lemon. Use fresh squeezed lemon juice, the bottled stuff will probably ruin the dish.

Just grilled this up on a rippled skillet. Lovely zesty flavour that was a little over-tangy but palatable. Not for easily startled taste buds, but for the adventurous, an invigorating dish.

I really, really liked this. The whole story from the other reviewer about the guy at some barbecue club spitting it out and saying it wasn't fit for dogs was really pathetic. This isn't a traditional "barbecue" dish or sauce, and really shouldn't be thought of as one. I always pound my chicken breasts these days - it makes them cook so nicely and they end up juicy with a quick cooking on the grill that way. I think this is a winner - easy to make, yet quick and elegant in its simplicity.

The chicken was delicious -- moist and tender -- and the aioli "BBQ sauce" is very good on the side, but not necessary. I marinated the chicken beforehand but not sure if that made a difference.

This is a great recipe...so easy and fast, and the chicken is delicious and moist. Per other reviewers' comments, I added a second garlic clove. I also added salt and pepper to the sauce. This is going to be a good weeknight staple for our family.

Good base but I added more garlic and I like spice so I included some ground chipotle in adobo to give it a smoky spice.

Incredible! We actually made this in the winter (for a White Holiday party when all dinner selections had "white" in the name). My husband was more than willing to stand out in 20 degree weather for this one. Incredible taste. Not too heavy, not too citrusy. Everyone raved.

I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be quick and easy with great results. Great for situations when friends drop by as no time is required for marinating the meat and boneless breasts cook quickly, particularly when sectioned and tenderized. I used it in exactly this situation, served with a simple salad with quality olive oil/balsalmic dressing, paired with a light Italian white wine, and my friends all raved about the taste and wanted to know the recipe.

A nice quick way to prepare grilled chicken. Moist and tasty. Only change I made was to use dried rosemary (a scant tsp) as I didn't have any fresh. Pounding the chicken didn't take long at all and ensured uniform and fast cooking.

I disagree with the previous reviewer. The chicken has been consistently moist made this way with just the right amount of spice. I made it just as written, even though our family isn't that fond of mayo. Seriously, everyone always asks for the chicken recipe (not necessarily the sauce). The sauce is good. Don't be put off because it is different than the standard "red" BBQ sauce. I saved some in a separate bowl for topping rather than using it all on the grill.

Not the best chicken recipe ever, but quite good and quick and easy to make. Next time, I will use less lemon juice and more zest and make sure the grill was quite hot in order to have more sauce cling to the chicken.

Very easy and good recipe. I doubled the garlic and had to use dried rosemary because I didn't have any fresh around the house and really liked it. It's not blow your mind good, but it was so simple to make and fast that I will make it again. (I will add even more garlic next time)
