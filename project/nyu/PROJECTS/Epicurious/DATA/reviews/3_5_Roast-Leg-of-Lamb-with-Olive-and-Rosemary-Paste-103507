And Oriental60 is right: it should be 20 mins./pound.

The paste is lovely, and if you like garlic and rosemary, you can increase both. I decreased the salt because olives are already pretty salty, and I didn't regret it. To those saying that the body of the recipe calls for bone-in lamb: I'm pretty sure what the writer meant in saying "boned side up" is that you should open up the boneless leg with the cut side (i.e. where the bone has been removed) facing up. I rerolled and retied with twine after spreading the paste, so it was a filling, and the flavor went really well with the lamb.

The timing should read 20 min.per pound which is why some reviewers were confused. I did use boneless though the body of the recipe calls for boned. If using boneless you can remove the netting, but be sure to retruss with string before putting paste on. I made the mistake of not restringing and half the lamb was fine while the other portion fell open. I just cooked this portion less. I was concerned if I kept the netting on and removed it after cooking that the paste crust would come off when I removed the netting. It's a delicious recipe and everyone loved it.

The time is terribly understated in this recipe. Also, calls for boneless in ingredients but refers to bone in recipe. Very salty. No need to salt. Also recommend placing lamb on a rack on a sheet. Interesting flavor though.

Simple and excellent lamb. Provides excellent lamb flavor with some lovely accents. IMPORTANT NOTE: Cooking times are way understated. Have made this dish twice and both times have had to roast the lamb for a minimum of another 30 minutes to get close to medium rare. Be sure to use thermometer and DOUBLE CHECK TEMPERATURE.

this is one of the best lamb recipes I have ever made! I used the full amount of olives and increased the garlic and rosemary. Everyone loved it!

This was a good recipe and the olive paste enhanced the taste of the lamb. Other lamb recipes we have tried from Gourmet will deliver more raves compared to this recipe.

This was a very easy dish. This was my first time roasting lamb and this recipe was very good for me. I would encourge everyone to cut off all fat b/c the lamb is really oily. I too added more garlic and was a bit skeptical that the meat might be too salty but it wasn't spiced enough for me - maybe i need to use a different olive next time. I added a sauce to go over the meat which helped (the sauce from the lamb with red-currant wine sauce recipe). My Easter dinner guests enjoyed it and that's all that counts.

This was easy and fantastic. Even my picky 10-year-old ate it and asked for seconds. It's going to be our Easter meal this year. I used pitted Kalamata olives to save time, but I might try the non-pitted ones to see if the result is any different (I have a feeling that they might be "brinier" and thus more flavorful).

This dish is beautiful with all the flavors and is so simple to prepare,A must try to enjoy with friends and family.

I used Kalamata olives, and used 3/4 of the called for amount, expecting the lamb to still come out salty enough to make our guests refill their wine glasses a few times. Surprisingly, the lamb wasn't salty at all; next time I'd use the full amount if I used Kalamatas. About a third of my guests preferred this recipe to a straightforward rosemary/garlic/lemon zest stuffed leg of lamb - not me though. I might try with saltier oil-cured black olives next time, or move on to a different recipe.

No need to use salt on the lamb, the olives made up for it, but did sprinkle the pepper. Was a mother's day meal for my Mom, needless to say the family enjoyed it. Definitely a 4 fork deal.

Great lamb recipe - I also halved the olives but increased the garlic and rosemary. The lamb was tender , moist and had lots of flavour. This is an very easy recipe with great results.

Using half the amount of olives was a good suggestion. Didn't need salt, but I did double the garlic. Cooked this on the bbq grill for Christmas dinner, only because I was out of oven space. It turned out delicious.

Wonderful! As previously recommended, used just 1/2 cup of olives. Both the simplicity of preparation and the wonderful flavor make this ideal for either a weeknight dinner, or a dinner party entree. Leftovers were great over greek salad for lunch or light entree dinner.

This dish has become a favorite with guests and I make it frequently just for family as it is very simple. It is basically tapenade and who can beat that. Memories of the South France!

Delicious! But I made two alterations. I used equal parts rosemary, thyme, and lavender (all fresh). . . I feel rosemary on its own can be a bit overwhelming. Also, I only used 1/2 cup of olives. . . which were just right.

Yum! Make sure to use good lamb, preferable spring lamb. Very easy to make and so good! The olive paste really enhanced the lamb flavor. Don't add too much salt as the olives are plenty of salt.

delicous and simple. you need to enjoy the hearty flavors of the olive tapenade to savor this dish. Leftovers were wonderful in pita sandwiches with feta, red onions, cucumbers, tomatotoes.

This was a very simple and good recipe. Be careful of strength of the olives. Suggest about half a cup of olives to avoid overpowering the meat. Good side dish is the Baby carrots and Asparagus recipe.
