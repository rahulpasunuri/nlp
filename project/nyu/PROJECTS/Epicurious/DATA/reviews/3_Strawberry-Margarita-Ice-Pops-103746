Amazing! Upped the lime juice to make them a little more sour. Used plastic shot glasses from the party store since I wanted single servings to pass at a party. They were a hit!

I made this as a dessert to follow the layered taco salad. Perfect end to a perfect meal. After allowing to thaw enough to easily remove from molds, these pops had the texture of a dense strawberry sorbet. Excellent! I will try it next time with raspberries and rum... The possibilities are endless!

What a great party treat for a hot summer night! We doubled the recipe and then poured them into mini muffin tins and used wooden popcicle sticks. Froze great and were the perfect size. We made these (easy) for a summer party and then had fun serving leftovers throughout the neighborhood to people out working in their yards, etc. Made the kids jealous!!

Fun and tasty. I used gold tequila with no apparent problems. I might stick with orange juice next time. I made half the recipe and filled four molds; made the mango ice pops for the other four. They were equally as good.

Thepop molds are easy to find -- just go to the dollar store in your mall and buy them cheap. But this recipe froze up too soft. When I tried to unmold the pops the sticks slid right out. The stuff tasted good once I fished it out with a spoon, but needs to be more solid. Maybe add more water or fruit?
