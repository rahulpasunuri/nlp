I only made the pancakes. They were light and fluffy, great texture, and so simple to make! My kids thought they needed more banana flavor, so I would increase the banana amount next time.

caramel-banana syrup is the best !!! I made it and my whole family LOVED it.

I made the syrup this morning using brown sugar as directed and I am extremely impressed with the caramel/banana flavor. Added rum instead of vanilla extract. Be sure to try the syrup!

I made these without the brown sugar and they were quite good, altho I bet I'll like them even more with brown. I added a bit of Grand Marnier to the syrup trying to get more depth of flavor because of the missing brown sugar, which was nice, but it did not have a caramel flavor. The left over syrup did not keep well as the bananas in it turned rather sickly grey, so be sure to scoop those out and add fresh when using the leftovers. I followed another reviewer's substitution for the self-rising flour since I did not have any. The recipe worked well with equal parts whole wheat and regular flour and a Tbsp of baking powder.

I, too, only made the topping and used it with a different banana pancake recipe. Very good and a little goes a long way.

I only made the syrup to put over french toast, and it tasted great! It was quite sweet so I only needed a little. Super easy and quick to make, and a great alternative if you don't have maple syrup on hand for pancakes or french toast.

I made the syrup only. It seemed too sweet so I added some real maple syrup. Not that it would make it less sweet but added a different flavor. About 1/4 cup. Very good that way. My son really liked it. He is 24.

Delicious! Just made them for brunch this morning and they were a hit. I left out the caramel-banana syrup because I thought that may be too sweet for my taste. The pancakes themselves were fantastic. i'll definitely make them again and maybe next time with the syrup....

These pancakes are surprisingly easy to make, especially considering how good the finished product tastes. My husband called them the "best pancakes he's ever had." I'm inclined to agree. I'm not a huge fan of sweet syrups, but the combination of the banana syrup and the pancakes was perfect-flavorful without being cloyingly sweet.

Fantastic. Definitely good enough for company. The pancakes were very fluffy and had just the right amount of banana flavor. The syrup is amazing, and very easy to make. I just realized I used white sugar instead of brown, even after I read another reviewer saying they did the same thing and reminded myself to use brown sugar! They turned out so great, I might just use white sugar again the next time I make them... and i think the next time we might add chopped pecans over the top of the pancakes and syrup.

My review is just for the syrup which I put over purchased frozen waffles. Quick, easy and delicious ...of course I'll do it again.

After all my substitutions, I had basically created a recipe all my own but either way, it was a hit! First off, I for some reason thought that the sauce had regular sugar in it. I used Sugar In the Raw instead of brown sugar. For the pancakes, I did use the 1/4 brown sugar however, I only had 1 banana (which I used in the sauce) and no buttermilk. I substituted banana vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk and the 2 extra bananas that I needed. I only had all- purpose flour and used that instead of self rising. I was shocked at how delicious it turned out besides me butchering this recipe. My kids and husband gobbled it up like it was their last meal! So, I guess it's good to know what you can use as substitutes. I would make this recipe again...maybe next time using the ingredients it actually calls for!! Or maybe not!

my partner refuses to touch anything else for his pancakes, other than maple syrup. that is until today when we tried this recipe and he told me before hand 'no, i don't want any of the syrup, make enough just for yourself'. luckily for him, i'm a nice person who shares. i will absolutely make this recipe again, and will probably use the syrup for other recipes this summer!

WOW!!!! these pancakes were really good i would make these again

We were so disappointed. These were OK, but only that. The syrup was the best, and there wasn't quite enough. The pancakes were pretty heavy - not fluffy - and the flavor was off. Won't make these again.

Wow! Tasty and easy!

I did not read the recipe correctly and made the syrup with regular sugar. The syrup still tasted great... just not like caramel. I did make the pancakes with the brown sugar. They were delicious!!! These will be made again!!!

I'm not exaggerating when I say these are the best pancakes I've ever made. They came out very fluffy (one person thought they were similar to cake), and the tangy-ness of the pancake with the super sweet syrup went well together. To me the banana was not as overwhelming as I thought it would be, there was a nice balance. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they were perfect. I'm sure this recipe would work nicely with other fruits and nuts as well.

I ended up forgetting the sugar in the pancake part of the recipe - and I was so glad I did! Usually I find pancakes too rich and heavy for breakfast - but without the sugar they tasted great - and didn't weigh us down. The syrup was plenty sweet to make the dish tasty.

Like another reviewer, I made these on a slow Sunday morning and it drew everyone out of bed. I couldn't tell whether my son was humming or moaning as he ate them. As others commented, the caramel syrup makes it.

I made this on a lazy Sunday morning while the rest of my family slept, after seeing three bananas in the fruit bowl that were in danger of expiring. I made it exactly as written, except used a/p flour (added salt, baking powder and baking soda). Also, substituted a 2 small containers of vanilla yogurt and some regular whole milk and left out the buttermilk. The wonderful smells filled the house and woke everyone up. Husband and daughter (a very picky eater) LOVED these. They were sooo fluffy and tasty and the syrup is to die for! I am going to add pecans to the pancakes next time - this is definitely a keeper.

I looked over a number of banana pancake recipes before choosing this one, but I think it was the promise of the caramel banana syrup that really drew me in. After making it on countless occassions, I would recommend this to any breakfast connoisseur. The syrup cooks quite quickly, though I usually double the recipe because everyone loves to drench the dense and intensely satisfying pancakes with it. The Breakfast Club I'm in begs for these. Always a hit.

Delicious! But very sweet. Easy recipe; kids loved it. The syrup really makes the dish.

The syrup was fantastic and so simple! I even added some strawberries and it made it even better. I will definitely make it again.

I used 1 cup each of white and whole wheat flour mixed with 1 tbsp of baking powder instead of the self rising flour. The pancakes were wonderful and fluffy and the syrup was a really great addition. I'm thinking the syrup might also be good with fresh peaches and with a touch of bourbon instead of vanilla.

I was short on time so I just added a ripe banana to an instant buttermilk pancake mix, which I think is just as good as making the mix from scratch. The sauce was really good, simple to make and a great complement.

These were surprisingly good. The best part was how light and fluffy they were. The syrup, even though it looked really questionable, was quite edible, and the kids thought so too...even with slices of banana in it. Even left over!

I made these for an anniversary breakfast, and my boyfriend and I were both very pleased with them. The flavor of the sauce is fantastic, though it really overwhelms any flavor that may be in the pancakes (next time I would add more banana to the mix). I didn't have self-rising flour so I just added some baking powder and salt to all-purpose flour (I didn't measure, but the previous reviewer was kind enough to leave proportions), and I didn't have buttermilk so I added 2 tbsp. of lemon juice to 2% milk and let it sit for five minutes; everything still seemed to turn out fine. I also wanted to make them look fancy and decadent, so I put a scoop of Haagen Dazs Banana Nut ice cream on top with a caramel decoration stuck in it vertically (melt sugar over medium-high heat until it browns, drizzle on wax paper, let harden and peel off). An elegant and delicious way to start the day.

Made this for my husband, then for a family gathering and everyone raved about them! My mom said she's only making banana pancakes from now on. The first time I made them I had neither self-rising flour nor baking powder in the house, so I used 1 1/2 c pancake mix and 1/2 c flour and they turned out great. You can also make your own self-rising flour with 6 c flour, 3 tbsp baking powder, and 1 tbsp salt.

Never worked with self-rising flour before - this recipe turned out AWESOME. What a way to wake people up! Next time, I'll double the bananas for both the sauce and batter. Yummy.

Wow! This is easy and very special. A great way to use extra bananas (so much more indulgent than banana bread!)

I made these pancakes for a New Years brunch that we have every year. I have Celiac's and therefore can't have the regular flour, so I substituted the flour for rice flour. Everyone RAVED about this. My husband said he's never had pancakes that good even at a restaurant. I will definitely make this again. It was so easy and you would have thought my guests had never eaten before the way they went on and on about these.

Made this for breakfast on Christmas morning. On a scale of 1 to 5, my kids gave it a 10. A nice change from regular pancakes.

My husband accidentally threw out my November issue and we were panick-stricken to find the recipe again! At first I thought there wouldn't be enough syrup for four servings, but there was. Since there is just the two of us, I made this two days in a row. The batter kept great in the fridge and the syrup worked well zapped in the micro the next day. We will definitely make it again.
