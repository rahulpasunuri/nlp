with all the positive reviews, I had high hopes, but it fell short. Hubby and I decided it was NOT something we would make again

How could you not love this recipe?! Marinade would be great for steak too. Adding fresh spinach suggested by another reviewer is a great idea. Did not make vinegrette since I was short on time. Not sure it is essential to the recipe. We grilled red onion and placed it on top of sandwich - great.

I really loved the freshness of the ingredients in this recipe--especially since we took the time to roast the red peppers. I added some baby spinach to the open-faced sandwich to give it some crisp, raw ingredient and was pleased with the result. My husband requested more gorgonzola on the next attempt, but then it would defeat my purpose of secretly making us eat healthier. :)

This recipe sounds delicious - would it be suitable for a beach picnic, with the right adjustments made? Thanks!

This was really tasty. A great combination of flavors. Since it's winter here now I used my ridged grill pan and did the bread under the broiler. I cut the bread thinner and made a sadwich out of it. My husband thought it really tasted like steak! I also grilled thick slices of red onion. Very tasty!

Hate to be a dissenter....but we didn't find this to be that great. Meh, it was OK or even kinda good. Selected this recipe for vegetarian company. I did like the gorgonzola butter and shall make it again with tosted French bread; what a simple and great idea. Sandra McNally

I have made this recipe twice now and loved it each time. Fresh peppers are definately the way to go and use the most flavourful olive oil possible when marinating. I also used creamy mountain gorgonzola and fresh mixed lettuce and arugula.

Very surprised at how much we loved this recipe. The portobellos truly taste like steak. I did modify a tad. I broiled the ciabatta bread with the gorgonzola butter, versus the recipe's method. Served with some greens on the side with the vinaigrette. Awesome!

Wonderful and hearty! Changed the recipe by sprinkling gorgonzola crumbles on the underside of the 'bella while it grilled (but after it had been flipped). Throw a loaf of french bread or garlic bread wrapped in foil on the grill, too, and make sandwiches when everything is done!

Fabulous. I only marinated for 15 minutes or so while I heated the grill. Also grilled some thick slices of red onion and served whole thing on buns. Amazing. Would be even better with some arugula.

Yum. Served this for a dinner party with 2 carnivores and 2 vegetarians. All were happy. The gorgonzola butter is sublime.

Having tried several recipes for grilled portobello sandwiches, I've decided this one is by far the best. It's just bursting with lots of good flavors, not the least of which is the slightly smokey taste from the liquid smoke and the wonderful gorgonzola butter. First time out, I didn't have time to roast red peppers as I normally would do, so I had to use the jarred kind, which were of course not as good. The only other changes I made were minor: I sliced the mushrooms before grilling on the indoor grill pan, and substituted spinach leaves for lettuce and ciabatta tops, and switched bottoms fresh from the bakery for sliced bread. As a vegetarian, I liked the idea from one reviewer of having some sirloin along with the mushrooms for carnivorous guests.

This dish is a crowd-pleaser. I was hosting a couple where the wife is a vegetarian and the husband a carnivore. The portobellos on toast were delicious. I made extra marinade and threw some sirloin steaks in the same marinade and grilled them at the same time with the portobellos. This way guests could choose portobellos, steak or both. I made the steak sandwiches the same way as the portobellos. The red pepper sauce was a big hit all around (I used jarred peppers--with this shortcut I felt there was no sacrifice in flavor). I had made extra gorgonzola butter, which I put out on the table along with some extra toast. The gorgonzola butter got rave reviews on its own. This recipe was fun and easy to put together, and the flavors taste great together.

Okay - I pulled a quick and dirty with this recipe - the ingredients just sounded so good and I didn't have much time. For those interested in short cuts, here's what I did: Marinated for abt 2 hours 2 large portobellos in balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing and added fresh crushed garlic and a bit of powdered thyme (all I had on hand). While those were grilling, I mixed some gorgonzola with a bit of olive oil and when it wasn't smooth enough, I added a bit of mayo. I didn't make the pepper vinaigrette, just layed a slice of jarred roasted pepper across the cheese spread. However, since I only used a thin layer of gorgonzola spread (I knew it'd pack a punch) I added a slice of swiss on top of the portobello slices (good addition!). The sandwich rolls were freshly baked, dense and crusty, so they really sopped up all juices well. Normally on the 1st try I never stray from the original recipe, let alone rate it, so now I'm feeling a bit guilty, but sated nontheless!

I must warn anyone that tries to make this on a bun like a "burger" that the mushrooms wind up way too wet and you will have marinade running down your arm. Not really appetizing. I still gave it a three because I didnt follow the exact recipe. The three came from what I thought it would be had I made it with the crusty bread, openface. I hate it when someone doesnt follow the recipe and gives it a crappy score. shame on them! The gorgonzola butter was a good compliment, but I could have done without the red pepper dressing. Word of caution: dont throw the marinade ingredients in the blender to save time-it emulsifies into a mayo-like consistancy.

This is one of the best recipies ever! I have been making it since it first came out in Gourmet magazine. I use balsamic vinegar and do make more gorgonzola butter.

It took a bit longer than 2-3 minutes to grill the mushrooms,(possibly because it snowing outside) but they were delicious with the pepper sauce and gorgonzola cheese. Another winner for those vegetarians like my teenage daughter who don't like vegetables.

I love portobello mushrooms but had never tried them grilled. I chose this recipe for my first Mushroom "steak sandwich" experience. Absolutely FANTASTIC! My husband thought it needed more gorgonzola butter but thats one of his favorite flavors. The red pepper vinaigrette is superb and all the flavors combine so well that I may just have to give up the typical grilled beef burger!

Awesome sandwich! Amazing that such intense flavors can explode from such a simple recipe. The red pepper vinaigrette alone is a find. I use it for a drizzle on salads and grilled veggies. Due to time constraints, I used red peppers from a jar and it worked just as well. Not to mention saving a lot of time. Definetly a keeper.

Simply delicious. Agree with other reviewers, this is an excellent marinade and basting, but not for dipping. For another great grilled vegetable check out the Grilled Baby Artichokes with Olive oil & Lemon on this website. Use the first reviewers recipe (Pasadena), not the one provided by epicurious. We had a great cook out using this recipe and the artichoke recipe ... Outstanding.

Great! Like the cook from Denver I reduced the oil to 5Tbs and it was more than sufficient. Added sliced red onions to the marinade. I served these whole on grill toasted hard rolls one side spreaded with gorgonzola, and topped with the marinated red onion grilled and the red pepper vinaigrette. Nice alternative to a burger.

This is a fabuluos recipes - the flavors go together unbelievably. I have never made the sandwiches as the recipe is written (I'm sure they are perfect though). I make this an as apetizer and spread the gorgonzola onto little crostini and top with sliced mushrooms and the red pepper vinaigrette. Always gets rave reviews!

This has become a favorite recipe. It's yummy for all: suits vegetarians, and is substantial enough to satisfy meat eaters. I don't use butter or make these as a sandwich; instead, i mix grated bread & any sort of blue cheese, stuff it in the mushroom, & bake it til cheese melts.

My partner and I are vegetarians and this has become our standard summer BBQ fare. We leave the mushrooms whole after grilling, and serve on burger buns with all the trimmings. Fantastic!

Loved this recipe. So healthy and so flavorful. You really don't need to mix the blue cheese with the butter. If you have softened the cheese to room temp, it spreads on the toasted bread just beautifully.

ohmygod, this was wonderful. once i roasted the red peppers, i ate nearly a third of one while i prepared the rest -- it's so amazing. i used less olive oil in the marinade and a bit extra garlic. amazing.

We modified this with great results - cut the oil to 5 T, added red onions to the marinade, did not serve as sandwich - just mushroom topped with the great red pepper vinaigrette, then the grilled onions, topped with a sprinkle of blue cheese. very yummy and lighter than the original.

These were wonderful. I took them to a party last night as an appetizer. The flavor was excellent. I served them sandwich style. I spread the gorgonzola butter on one side of the bread, the vinaigrette on the other side, laid the mushroom inbetween and then closed the sandwich. I sliced them into 1 1/2" pieces and then gently put the pre-cut sandwich in foil to keep it warm. This is a keeper!

A couple of tips from a 'bella burger lover: you don't need that much oil in the marinade...also, if you take a spoon and gently scrape the ribs from the shrooms before marinating the end product will not saturate the bread with brown liquid....much better presentation.

These are great for vegetarians when the rest of the barbeque is scheduled for meat. I used a little more vinegar in red pepper vinaigrette. I want to try to fix these as small appitizers by cutting them into bit sized pieces

This was absolutely wonderful! It took a little too long to make, over an hour, but we served it with wasabi mashed potatoes, and it felt like we were eating a gourmet meal. We made an open faced sandwich so we could savor the texture and taste. YUM!

This recipe is a teriffic meatless lunch dish. I usually add a little salt and white pepper to the red pepper vinaigrette.

I didn't happen to have any Gorgonzola on hand, so I used Creme Brie. The taste was excellent. I know that some find Gorgonzola too strong but I think the next time I will try it, the mushrooms should soften the cheese. Home roasted peppers are ALWAYS the only kind you should use. They are not difficult to do and they add such wonderful flavor to many meats, pastas and of course the mushrooms.

I made this recipe a while back and only now remembered to review it. I think this is actually one of the best hors d'oeuvres I've ever had. The combination of flavors is fantastic. I am a big fan of mushrooms. The textures are great; crunchy bread, juicy mushroom, rich gorgonzola buter, velvety red pepper vinaigrette. Guests will rave.
