I thought this was great as well - although I used slightly more sweet potatoes than the recipe called for. I also used Tony Chacere's instead of plain cayenne and did *not* use the heavy whipping cream. It also got rave reviews from our guests AND my 19 month old daughter. Will definitely be making again for Christmas.

I'm surprised at the negative reviews here - this was a hit. This is not your ordinary sweet potato puree so you have to go in expecting something different. The cayenne adds quite a kick, which some people loved and which left other people reaching for the water. But I thought this was original and interesting and I'd make it again for an out-of-the ordinary side dish.

Not a favorite! The ingredients just don't work together. It was worth a try but not a hit.

So overall I like this recipe but I did make some adjustments as well. I used 3.5 - 4 lbs sweet potatoes (7 big potatoes) and 2 small granny smith apples. I just found that the ratio of less apples to more potatoes was better in terms of sweetness and tartness, without completely losing the sweet potato taste. Also, I only added a very small amount of cayenne but I don't think it fits at all, so I will omit that completely next time. Use a pinch of nutmeg instead. What I love about this recipe (mashed sweet potatoes in general) is that you can completely pre-make them and only need to re-heat on day of dinner, which you can't really do with regular potatoes. So that in itself is awesome.

I changed the variations of this...instead of adding the onion and oil and peppers, i used 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar, tsp of lemon juice and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon with a dash of nutmeg and allspice. It turned out pretty good!!!! The original was ok...just not what i expected. I like sweet over tart.

This was terrible. Way too tart. Just not a good idea for sweet potatoes.
