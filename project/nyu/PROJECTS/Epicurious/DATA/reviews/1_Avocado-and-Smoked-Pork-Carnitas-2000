I agree with the others. The editors of this recipe should change it to read "carnitas" to indicate it's kinda like carnitas, but definitely not authentico. I'm a gringo, but my carnitas are a hit. I like to take any inexpensive blade/shoulder steak 2 lbs.(veal, pork are best since they taste the same once spiced up). Add enough water or stock to cover. Add a couple Ts of chile powder, a dozen pepper corns a couple seven or eleven pequin dried chiles and several cloves of garlic peeled and quartered. Bring to boil then simmer for 1.5 hours. Remove meat and cool until it can be handled. Break into chunks (preferred over shredding cause it's easier and looks more substantial). Fry off in an equal mixture of lard (manteca) and butter in a med-high skillet. While frying, sprinkle with a cumin/red chile powder/salt mix to taste. TIP: The less you stir the crispier they'll be. Serve in warm double flour tacos..doubling up holds it together so you eat it vs. wear it. Use toppings that you like. Shredded cabbage, onions and lime wedges and cilantro are nice! And Corona, siempre!!

My recipe for carnitas is a crowd pleaser and gets rave reviews whenever I make it. My husband and kids love it as well as everyone else. You take a pork roast and throw it in a pan and cover with water. I chop an onion and a few jalapenos and mince a little garlic. I toss those in as well and cook it until it can be shredded together easily. EASY. Condiments include: sour cream, guacamole, fresh salsa, chopped cilantro, and chopped radishes. Put all of this in warm flour (or corn) tortillas and there you go. Add salt and pepper as desired to meat mixture. I am not trying this recipe either. Don't need it.

Okay, I didn't make it either for the same reasons stated. For those looking for "real" carnitas with an interesting twist, try Zarela Martinez' recipe ('Zarela's" in NYC): A few tbls lard Pork shoulder/butt - cubed to 1-1/2" Zest of 1 - 2 oranges 3/4 C Orange juice In heavy dutch oven, fry pork pieces w/zest in lard till crisp, 15-20 minutes. Drain off fat, add OJ and reduce (uncovered) to syrupy glaze - 15 minutes or so. Cover tightly and bake at 300 degrees for about 40 minutes.

I read the recipe and the following comments. I hope this ends the confusion. In the opening lines of the recipe it clearly states what Carnitas are. Fried pork. No more, no less. It is true, this "version" as they call it here, is so distant from Carnitas that in my opinion the title should be changed to avoid confusions. I did not try the recipe. So much Mayonaise in a "Mexican" dish is really not very appealing.

This "carnitas" recipe is a joke! I was looking for a new twist on the recipe but this was way out in space! I admit that I didn't even attempt this recipe. I was too scared of the outcome! Carnitas are usually boiled in seasoned water until fork tender, then roasted to dry out the meat so that it can be shredded. I like to think that I am an innovative chef, but this was unreal.

Now I am curious to find a recipe for the real thing!

not a bad recipe standing on its own without being called carnitas. Not the real deal however. I don't imagine very many mexican expert cooks being allowed in the doors of Bon Apetit

The only place you would find HAM HOCKS being refered to as Carnitas or used in any Mexican dish would be in MEXICO, MISSOURI! To taste the real thing...CARNITAS... is to know what an absurd substitute a poor ham hock would make. Also, you do not shred any meat is carnitas. T the meat is cut very thin and grilled after it has been marninated in lime and garlic.

Amazing recipe. Nothing Mexican about it. I have been cooking mexican food for all my life, and this should not be called mexican

having lived in mex for 18yrs. i am dumfounded to see a recipe so contrary to the real carnitas. i doubt if a mexican would recognize what this dih is or could ever be called, certainly not carnitas.
