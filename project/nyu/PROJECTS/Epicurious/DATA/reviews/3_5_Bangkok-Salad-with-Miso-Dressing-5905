Just made the dressing and Love it, I made on simple change I used half lemon juice and half rice vinegar, didn't have ginger so I left it out. I was still great, can't wait try it with the ginger.

This is a truly exceptional asian marinade and dressing. I made this recipe for a friend allergic to soy with South River's Azuki Bean Miso, and she was thrilled. I only used one garlic clove, and mixed it in by hand after blending so it wouldn't be so potent. This was a fabulous grilled turkey tender marinade as well.

This dressing was SO good. I had been trying to replicate a salad dressing I had at Lulu's on Maui and I think this is very close. I took other reviewers advice and halved the oil--I used peanut oil and 1 teaspoon of dark sesame oil.

Made dressing only and placed it on my own Romaine salad. YUMMY! Go easy on the garlic - not too big of a clove(s)- tasting as you go. I felt it didn't need salt and pepper. Replaced the sugar with bitter-free white stevia. Worked great. (Too much sugar in the diet causes too much yeast in the body which leads to chronic sinusitis, fibromyalgia, etc). This is a healthy recipe!!!!!

Haven't tried the salad (too lazy to fry stuff for a salad) but the dressing was a hit with our family and guests as an all-purpose dressing for green salad or carrot/cabbage salad. I usually make extra and keep it in the fridge for lunch the next day as a change from our usual olive oil & balsamic vinaigrette.

Yum! Had this dressing over brown rice, fresh tofu and steamed bok choy--don't think my simple dinner could have been much faster or more delicious. I cut the oil in half, since it seemed like a lot--I'd keep it that way in the future.

Loved this simple salad. Great to pair with any Asian dinner. The first time I made it I cut the oil as reviewers suggested. The second time I forgot and it wasn't as flavorful. I would definitely reduce the oil or replace with a more flavorful peanut or a few drops of sesame oil. Wonton croutons are not to be skipped.

Wow is all I can say; like the cook from Silver Lake, this is one of my most requested recipes. Have been making since 2003 so it has evolved. Now use about half again ginger and garlic, less oil, use dry chowmein noodles in place of wontons and prepare salad of baby greens, radiccio, orange segments chopped, thinly sliced English cucumber and mushroom. Rather unusual, very tasty and a crowd pleaser EVERY time; even picky son likes it! Sandra McNally Calgary/Edmonton/Panama

The cook from LA is right--the dressing is worth making just to smell it! I had never used miso before but love Thai and Vietnamese food and am just learning a few recipes. My salad consisted of romaine, shredded carrot, diced English cucumber, fresh mushrooms and dried chow mein noodles (my grocery didn't have wonton wrappers). Delicious, differant, definitely will make again, especially with fresh spring greens.

Chaned the dressing a bit and did not make the salad. used only one clove garlic, added candied ginger and pwd fresh ginger as well as omitted the oil and added about 2T chili sesame oil. Served with Cucumbers, sweet onion, carrot and a bit of lettuce.

Great dressing for any type of salad. Added Japanese seaweed and toasted white sesame seeds into the salad and was very refreshing.

This is really delicious. I did use half the oil in the dressing and used peanut oil. The garlic was strong and I will cut that in half next time. Shredded carrots and sliced mushrooms are a great addition. The wontons were very easy to make.

I made this for a large dinner party last night and everybody LOVED it. It is now my favorite salad. I do think I'll follow other reviewers' lead and use less oil next time.

This is one of my most requested recipes. I use peanut oil in place of olive and a bit of honey in place of sugar, otherwise I prepare the dressing exactly as written. It's great on romaine as well as a base for cabbage slaw. The fried wontons are easy and add a great crunch to the salad. I can't keep guests from grabbing the wontons as they cool and using the dressing as a dip - not a bad idea in itself.

I will only comment on the dressing as it was the only thing I made from this recipe. It was outstanding! I made it yesterday for a party and everyone raved about it. I doubled the recipe using only half of the oil and added 1 tsp of sesame oil and drizzled the dressing over a mix of shredded romaine lettuce, grape tomatoes, julienned carrots and red peppers, sliced mushrooms, scallions and sliced cucumbers. This recipe's on my favorites list.

I made this according to the recipe and found the flavor to be great, but the dressing seemed a little bit too thick at first. I will add some weak sake next time to thin out the dressing a bit.

This is a pretty good miso dressing, but I'm still looking for one that's more like what I get at my local teppan restaurant. I did use red miso (just less) and added some carrot juice for sweetness, but its still not the same.

A "Bangkok" salad with Chinese dumpling wrappers and Japanese dressing??? The Pan-Asian inspiration of this dish is nice, but you should specify shiro-miso (white miso) ONLY here, as aka-miso (red miso) will make this WAY too salty and heavy tasting. A quick note on miso- a little goes a long way, start slowly and adjust flavor to your preference. Also, don't use olive oil in an Asian dressing- try using a lighter oil such as peanut. You can also go with a more ethnically appropriate choice like sesame oil (just a little, sesame is quite strong). If in doubt, just stick to plain old vegetable oil, which is suitably light and mild in flavor.

It was so quick, easy, and very tasty. I went light on the oil. At first, I had a hard time finding Miso (didn't really know what it looked like) It was worth the discovery process though!

I've been looking for a similar dressing as the kind at Benihana and I found better! I used red miso, only 1/2 tsp sugar and 2 tbsp olive oil. I also added thinly sliced white mushrooms to the salad. Absolutely wonderful!!

Since everyone raved about the dressing, I made it to go on a simple salad of mixed greens. And man did it live up to expectations!! I used yellow miso and probably only a couple of teaspoons of oil...just enough to give it creaminess. It was SO delicious!! Very pungent flavors....absolutely delicious, I will make this from now on instead of buying bottled dressing

I only tried (am and rating) the dressing- I used it for a Japanese-style side salad of lettuce, tomato, cucumber & carrot. This is a really delicious dressing but I used less than half of the oil and I think it was still too much. I like my dressing pretty sharp, I guess. I will also take the advice previously given and try regular oil next time, as olive oil (usually very delicious) just doesn't seem quite right in this Japanese dressing. I also like a bit of texture so I recommend adding grated or minced ginger after it is blended. Red miso is also good in this recipe for a stronger flavor (I made it with red first and didn't notice the olive oil flavor, actually). Yum!

YUM! I wound up cutting the won ton wraps in half into triangles & sprayed w/ a bit of non stick spray & a sprinkle of salt & baked them...still great & less fat (and easier) - excellent salad!

This salad had great flavor and great crunch. I felt like it needed something else besides lettuce, but I didn't get any complaints about the wontons!!

This dressing is delicious and smells amazing! I just made the dressing, tossed it with baby lettuce mix, and topped it with a little canned corn (sounds strange, but trust me) and some cubes of silken tofu. Yum!

This is the best!! I added steamed asparagus pieces (chilled) to the romaine, tossed with the dressing and then divided to the number of servings. I then topped each salad with green onion, grated carrot, thinly sliced mushrooms, bean sprouts, toasted almonds (slivered), sunflower seeds, fried wontons (thinly sliced strips) and then topped everything off with a drizzle of this amazing dressing. This makes a fabulous meal on its own!

you definitely get garlic breath, but it's so yummy!! i don't particularly like ginger so i would reduce that a bit and make sure it's really ground up next time. i put sliced almonds and some chopped green onions on top as well.

This salad dressing is just delicious! I used less oil as suggested by other readers and also added a minced scallion. I served it over a mixture of romaine, cucumber, sweet onion and avocado-yummy!

I enjoyed this one. I used half the oil, as someone earlier recommended, and thought they were right. I did fry up the won tons, and it was easy (did them in just a bit of oil on the stove) and added a nice crunch. Would definitely use the dressing also on just a regular salad. Its a nice change from the usual viniagrette and goes well with any asian entree.

I used the salad dressing on a simple salad of shredded romaine, sliced cukes, & red onion. Very goood dressing, perfect for serving a salad alongside an Asian meal. Definitely use way less oil, though--no more than 1/4 c max.

excellent. I used red miso as I didn't have the other. A little strong in flavour but delicious. Will try it with other misos next time. Fried the won tons in 2 tabs oil insted of deep frying. Took a little longer but saved wasting the oil and they were not greasy at all.

A great alternative to regular salad dressings. The wontons added a nice variation from traditional croutons. Went well with a oriental themed dinner!

Like Caroline from LA, I made this salad dressing with canola oil instead of olive oil, put it on romaine leaves and it was fabulous --very much like that good salad dressing they give you in fine Japanese restaurants. I also used white miso instead of yellow (because I had it) and stirred in 1 teasp.grated fresh orange peel at the end. DEE-LISHUS! Make it early in the day and refrigerate so the flavors have a chance to blend. This is a fast,easy recipe and an absolute keeper.

I haven't made this salad, but I've made the dressing - and it's a nice change from conventional vinaigrettes. I substituted plain canola oil for olive oil for a purer miso and ginger taste, and the result was lovely.
