It was okay. I was looking for a recipe like Morton's Steakhouse's creamed spinach and this wasn't as good.

Pretty good--I used bags of pre-washed spinach, but it sure does take a long time to take all the stems off that much spinach! Other than that, a snap to make and good for a weeknight dinner.

These were nice - fresh spinach was no fun to prep (i used three bags of fresh spinach to serve 4-5 people well as a side). And these are not the creamy ones you get in a steak house - you almost don't taste the cream - but the onions add nice flave.

Easy and delicious. Didn't have an onion so used garlic instead. Turned out great.

A very nice spinach dish. Very simple to make and light tasting to eat.

the only thing I did was add a can of cream of musroom soup... I like my creamed spinach more, well, CREAMY than this recipe allows for. those of you who feel the same: i suggest you try it!

Delicious! I don't like spinach for the most part and can't get enough of this one! The first time I tried it was at "Ruth's Chris Steakhouse" and was apprehensive to try it, but wow, what a great surprise. When we found the recipe we've made it several times since and everyone raves about it. This will definitely stay in our must make file.

So easy to make! Steamed the spinach using just the water clinging to the leaves. Chopped up half a small yellow onion (much more than 3 tablespoons, but I love onion, so what the heck?). Didn't have any nutmeg, so I did without. Delicious! Creamy with a peppery bite from the onion and the black pepper. Next time, I'll make sure to have nutmeg on hand.

I steamed the salted fresh spinach: no excess moisture. Tried this with nonfat evaporated milk instead of cream & a sprinkling of grated Parmesan in milk & as garnish -- also dillweed. Tasty & pretty.

sounds like most people had too much moisture before they added the cream. Use you senses... drain and then stir fry your spinach before you add the cream. I love the onions... sweet onions share the divide between the onion lovers/ and haters. This is a great recipie for low carb dieters... remember to deduct the fiber grams!

Good consistency, but a little too onion-y. Next time I'll use 1/4 of an onion. Very easy to make.

To cook from mpls....yes, frozen spinach works really well for any creamed recipe, you don't even have to be obsessive re: the squeeze dry, just cook gently in a saucepan, the water will evaporate at the rate you pick per heat/cover. I understand the need for frozen, i am from NH. LOL. To pazeoo....NO they do not mean 1/2 of a pearl onion (hello?) they really mean, as stated, 1/2 of a small onion....some people like onion, alter amounts per taste.

I adore creamed spinach. Is there any reason I could not use frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and SQUEEZED DRY. I don't think I would have to really change any part of the rest of the receipe. Any comments?

When they say small onion they mean "a pearl onion". And I Love Onions.I added more cream, and parmesean cheese. It tastes pretty good now.

I've made this several times but always with some additions. I always add a splash of Sherry for flavor and a little more cream and let it reduce longer(I usually eye it as spinach can be different in moisture and volume.) I read someone's comments about too many onions but I don't think there is such a thing! Also, if you add a dollop of sour cream it adds alot of flavor but unfortunately, some fat as well. Still, when you're looking for great comfort food, it's hard to beat!

The 1/4 of cream and tablespoon of butter was soaked up immediatley by the spinach. This dish did not resemble "creamed" spinach in any way. Yuck!

Excellent! Make sure to go easy on the onion, and be sure to mince finely. Don't overcook, either.

I didn't think this was creamy enough and the onions were too obvious. I am going to keep looking for a creamed spinach recipe.

Pretty good. You can also substitute the cream for cream cheese. Use half a package. Try using a whisk to mix the ingredients.

I've made this dish several times now. It's become a staple in our home. Instead of chopping the spinach first, I cook the whole leaves first. Then I drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking and so that it's cool enough to press the leaves between my hands. Then I chop. I just find this easier.

This was a huge hit! With cleaned spinach now readily available this dish is a snap to prepare.

This is an easy-to-make classic. Chop the spinach very finely and go easy on the nutmeg. Don't be tempted to substitute the heavy cream for half-and-half, it makes the recipe. Just the thing to serve with prime rib.

Nice, we like spinach, but I wouldn't make it again.

This creamed spinach was out of this world. I made it for a dinner party and every last drop was eaten. I made 8 servings of it - so it was rather time consuming to clean all of the spinach - but the results were well worth it. I'm looking forward to making it again soon.
