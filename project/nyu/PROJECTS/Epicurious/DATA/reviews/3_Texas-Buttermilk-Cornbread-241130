Really want to try this recipe, but would like to know, how many eggs is a good amount?

I made this with an egg and about 2 tsp of sugar, in a cast iron skillet, and it was great -- delicately crumbly but not dry, and very flavorful. Be forewarned though, this is super buttery. So: not a particularly healthful treat, but it's yummy. (Especially with some fancy honey.) The Mr loved it.

Fast and easy. I made this as directed (except I used a cast-iron pan) and wished I had seen the reviews about the egg, but we ate it anyway and it was pretty good, especially warm out of the oven. Also, I'm pretty sure that good quality stone-ground cornmeal makes a big difference.

I thought this cornbread was incredibly easy and delicious, and make it frequently with the sugar. I'm not sure if it's the real Texas thing or not, but it always gets rave reviews from my French friends and family.

I wonder how many eggs Martha Holmes adds? I made it as the recipe states and it turns out like cornmeal shortbread which in it's self isn't such a bad thing. It was really good dunked into soup. I think I might make it again pressed out thinly and topped like a pizza.

My mother is Martha Holmes, the creator of these recipes, I'm the kid in culinary school. I would just like to clarify that my mother DOES use eggs in her recipe, for some reason Bon Appetit decided to omit them for some reason. Hear me out again, we DO USE EGGS IN OUR CORNBREAD!!!

Uh, that's TYLER, TX. We eat a lot of cornbread here, and I would not consider making it in anything other than a cast iron skillet, no sugar...ruins it for me totally. Good recipe.

This was a very disappointing recipe. I will stick with my other cornbread recipes from now on.

i wonder, did "tyeler texas" actually make the recipe? yes, the traditional method is the cast iron pan, but i just made this and it yielded a moist and tasty cornbread.

Whoever heard of making cornbread without an egg -- and using a glass baking pan is just unheard of as there is no way to get a crusty bottom with glass. Must use a cast iron skillet. However they are right on the money in omitting sugar.
