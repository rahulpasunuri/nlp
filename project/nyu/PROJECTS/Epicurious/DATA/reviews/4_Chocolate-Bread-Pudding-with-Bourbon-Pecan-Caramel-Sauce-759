I made this last night for a dinner party.I was very surprised after all the rave reviews to find the pudding very bland and not chocolaty enough for our taste. Following others suggestion I made the caramel sauce fom the pumpkin pudding recipe and added pecans.The sauce made the dessert.I am trying to think of ways to add chocolate to finish the lefover maybe chocolate chips on top before warming it up or maybe chocolate sauce

This was absolutely delicious. Used dark chocolate instead of semisweet. Wasn't sure if it would work to substitute agave syrup for the corn syrup. It seemed to caramelize just fine although it took longer to get to a light amber color.

Seven years have gone by since I first reviewed this recipe. My wife still asks for it every birthday (12 years running now). Over the years she has come to appreciate the carmel sauce, as long as I leave out the bourbon.

Wonderful. I used kahlua in place of the bourbon and didn't add the lemon juice as per previous reviewers recommendation. It worked really well. Easy make ahead dessert that you can pop in the oven while sitting down for dinner. I have to say the sauce makes it for me.

The consistent comment I get when I make this is "the best thing I ever put in my mouth". I am very good at making complicated at desserts, but this is the one that I am known for. It is so easy to make, friends who can't cook have no problem taking this on. It impresses everyone. The caramel sauce is the perfect recipe in texture, flavor and appearance.

Love this one. It has been a big hit for the last two years at holiday parties. I use a dark rum in the sauce as I don't drink bourbon and buying a whole bottle just for 2 tablespoons seems a waste. The rum works really well!

This is the perfect dessert for a crowd. It is pretty much 'no fail' and leftovers get better and better. Last time I made a creamy caramel sauce and served it with warm Bread Pudding and Vanilla ice cream. Yum!

The lemon juice in the caramel sauce is only a protection against cristalization of the sugar. The corn syrup should also prevent this. I would only add 1/4 tsp for this purpose - you won't even taste it if you add that little, and it will help it from forming crystals.

I have made this twice and both times it has been excellent! I think I will make it again tonight.

I made this sauce with another pudding and it was the hit of the party. You could drink this stuff it's soooooo good.

I cannot count the number of times I made this recipe and it always gets rave reviews. I don't melt the chocolate, I add it last, so its chocolate chunk bread pudding. Yum!!!

Yuck and Yuckier. First mixed in 8 ounces chocolate as called for, then took the suggestion to use 12. Also used the suggestion to make the caramel sauce from the Pumpkin Bread Pudding recipe (which by the way is awesome) and added pecans and bourbon. The sauce was great. The pudding was too sweet, too wet, and ugly on the plate.

For the past 5 years, my wife has requested this as her birthday dessert. She isn't very fond of the sauce, but loves the bread pudding.

I've gotten nothing but rave reviews, each and every time I've made this! (I do not include the lemon juice.)

I might make this again but I will definitely omit the lemon juice from the caramel sauce. The pudding was creamy and chocolatey (12 oz) but I agree with the reviewer who thought the caramel sauce had an odd taste.

I liked the recipe, but I don't love it. I have never put a TBLS of lemon juice in a caramel sauce before and I could taste the bitterness. I thought it was me, but when others told me the caramel sauce was "off", I knew it was the lemon juice. I'll omit the lemon juice for further reference if I use the sauce again. I ended up adding a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the sauce after I took it off the heat (I was lucky it melted right in instead of staying granular)

I was amazed at how easy bread pudding can be! This was served as dessert at a Christmas dinner party and was a huge hit. The bourbon sauce was *very* strong and somewhat overpowering -- I thought the bread pudding was better alone. It's very rich, but incredibly delicious and tastes just as good re-heated the next day.

Easy recipe with tons of flavor!!! I ended up baking this about 15 minutes longer, however...and plopped some vanilla bean ice cream for the little kiddies...

Great bread pudding. I could not find corn syrup in Europe, so I used the (much easier) caramel sauce from the pumpkin bread pudding recipe and added pecans and bourbon (which were available). Guests sighed and whimpered and were reduced to state of bliss and belt-loosening.

Scrumptious. Sauce is what makes it, and we ran out of sauce before we ran out of pudding. Had to get this recipe out to many friends!

Truly wonderful! I discovered chocolate bread pudding w/ carmel sauce at a favorite restaurant and am happy to say this recipe compares fabulously. Unlike other reviewers, I used the called for 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate - it's plenty sweet even for a chocolate fiend like myself. I also substituted irish cream for the bourbon - yum!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it: especially the sauce (which I have made twice now for other desserts). I used a combination of challah bread and brioche. This is a simple and delicious down-home dessert.

This bread pudding really wasn't worth the effort. It's more of a thick chocolately custard than a bread pudding, and not really that chocolately even though I used 12 oz of Ghiradelli chocolate. Boiling the sugar to "dark amber" does give the sauce a burnt taste.

I am a HUGE bread pudding fan (and have made dozens). This recipe however was a big disappointment. I think it would be better to make a regular bread pudding and bake it with chunks of chocolate. I used 12 oz of Valrhona chocolate, and still the flavor was non-descript. Also, a caveat with the caramel sauce--do not cook the sugar until "deep amber" as instructed (had a burned flavor), should be cooked to a golden amber.

I followed one cook's suggestion and used 12 ounces of chocolate, but I substituted bittersweet for the semi-sweet. Could not find unsliced egg bread, so used thinly sliced bread and it worked fine. Everyone raved about this dessert!

i made this recipe for a barbeque i unfortunatly couldn't go to. it was over three months ago and i am still getting compiments. i used grand marnier and 12 ounces of chocolate. i was told it was unbelievable. i will have to make it again, so that i can try it for myself next time.

Yes, this dessert is a beautiful, beautiful thing. It's somewhat time consuming, but very worth it. I made it with 12 oz. chocolate, and my guests raved. Several said it was the best chocolate dessert they'd ever eaten.

I've made this recipe several times. The first time I used 12 oz chocolate and a little more liquid and this is the one that turned out best. The pudding's chocolate was heavier at the bottom which I particularly liked. I'm English and was brought up on Bread and butter pudding. This was far better than mum ever used to make (no offense mum) Next time I make it I'm going to use a layer with white chocolate and a layer with dark chocolate.

I belong to a women's supper club and each month it is my job to come up with a "knock your socks off" dessert.(we are talking women here)This time I made this recipe but was unable to attend.Just got off the phone with my friend who said they all voted this the best dessert they had EVER eaten.EVER! I didnt try it before my friend picked it up but I"ll take their word for it.I did use 12 oz. of chocolate for the pudding like others suggested. The sauce took longer to reduce than the recipe stated but was very easy to make.

Can someone tell me what this is supposed to look like? I followed the recipe to the letter, but what came out was a very unappetizing, meat loafy looking dessert. The sauce was wonderful, but the pudding was nothing to write home about, and this with the 12 oz of chocolate one reviewer suggested.

This was easy to make and a big hit at a recent dinner party. I will be making this over and over again!

I made this receipe for a Valentine's/Birthday celebration using the suggestions of 12 oz. chocolate and using Jack Daniel's whiskey instead of bourbon. The results were fantastic! I've made many, many desserts for my family, but this one was by far the favorite - it "takes the cake!" (so to speak).

Rating: 4
Incredible! It was so good that people were raving, "You have to try this!!" The chocolate was so creamy and rich (I used 12 oz!) and the sauce was out of this world. The two together created a sum far greater than the parts!! I will make it again, soon! My cousin's husband asked me for the recipe so she would make it for him!

I made this for Christmas Eve dessert, and found it the perfect end to the meal. I used about 12 oz. of chocolate and plain whiskey instead of bourbon, and the results were astounding. It took a while for the caramel sauce to become smooth after I added the cream (I got nervous that I had ruined the sauce), but stick with it! The result is well worth the effort.

wow was this good! I have made it three times. The first two were fine, but this last time was other worldly. I increased the chocolate to 12oz and substituted whiskey for bourbon (out of necessity). It was amazing and life changing. I couldn't stop eating it. My sister ate it as breakfast the next day. Make this dessert!

FANTASTIC. My sister made it for a dinner we were going to and we almost pulled over to the side of the road and skipped dinner altogether it smelled so good. I can't wait to make it myself.

This is excellent. I used baked puff pastry pieces, croissants and white bread. It gave it a sweeter taste and texture. With the sauce...um yummy! Customers loved it!

We are going to friends for dinner tonight and the request was that I bring this desert. Yikes. It is somehow gone from my recipe file. I had several other bread pudding recipes but I knew that only this one would do. So here I am at my first trip to Epicurious, and now it's another trip to the grocery store, children in tow, on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Yep, it's worth it. Creamy, chocolatey, adult comfort food.

The most important part of this recipe is not to under or over-do the pudding. Out of all the bread puddings on Epicurious.com my favorite.
