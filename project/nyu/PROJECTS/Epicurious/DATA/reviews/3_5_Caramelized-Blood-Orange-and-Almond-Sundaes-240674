I'm making this for the second time as it was a hit before! It is light but delicious! Great after a spicy meal!

I made this for a surprise for dessert and my husband and I LOVED IT! Making the orange sauce and toasted almonds ahead made the final assembly super easy. Both of us would give this 3 1/2 stars if we could. Excellent and pretty.
