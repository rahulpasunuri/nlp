This dressing is excellent. Always a favorite with dinner guests and family. I like to use the left over as a spread on turkey sandwich. Easy to make and will keep in refrig several days.

I used this for a salad with mandarin oranges, toasted pine nuts and gouda and it was a big hit. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty authentic mustard vinaigrette. I dressed sliced fennel with it, leaving out the ponch of sugar because the fennel is so sweet, then added honey to the rest of the vinaigrette to use on salad. May need a little salt too.

The dressing is also most excellent over chilled asparagus spears or baby green beans in addition to many different salads, steak salad in particular. I keep this made up on hand most all the time and everyone I have served this to just raves about it.

This dressing is excellent...Same as we enjoyed on a canal barge cruise through France.

Every time I make this dressing, someone requests the recipe. The dijon mustard dressing stands up well to other strong flavors. I often make this dressing when serving a salad to accompany spicy foods. It works well with spicy barbeque or indian food.
