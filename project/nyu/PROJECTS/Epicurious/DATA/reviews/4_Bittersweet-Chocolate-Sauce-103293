Sooooooo delicious. I'm a huge bittersweet chocolate fan. After you've made this, you may want to check out this homemade nutella recipe I found (http://goo.gl/ixlGV), it's just as decadent but a little more exotic!

SOOOOO yummy and easy. Seriously. . . how could you do Hershey's Syrup after trying this? Quick and easy! I added Bailey's Irish Cream for an adult kick!

This is the perfect chocolate sauce-- or more like a ganache that thins when warmed. It's super easy to make. Worth investing in high quality chocolate.

This chocolate sauce is easy and yummy. I used light corn syrup instead of dark. And I did add in 2 T. of butter and a 1 t. of vanilla at the end (a.k.a. Julia Child's chocolate sauce). This recipe is a keeper.

This sauce is delicious. Try spicing it up with a hint of cinnamon and dash of cayenne! I use it for a hot fudge topping on ice cream and for filling in chocolate layer cake. (I like the cake & frosting recipe from "Choc. Crunch Layer Cake With Milk Chocolate Frosting" epicurious.com) Use high quality chocolate such as Lindt or Ghirardelli for best results.

This was so easy to make and just fabulous tasting! The sauce comes out so rich and chocolatey - perfect for a chocolate lover like myself. I served it on frozen peanut butter pie, but it would be just as wonderful on some plain and simple vanilla ice cream.
