Delicious and easy! There are only 2 of us, so I didn't want to buy a whole roast chicken. Instead I poached 2 chicken breasts and then shedded them. Everything else was kept the same. I've made this numerous times for a weeknight dinner.

I don't know -- I made this recipe as written, except that I grilled my own chicken. It was terribly bland, especially considering all the expensive ingredients. Way too much bread, too. We finally picked out the chicken (for sandwiches) and tossed the leftovers.

I liked the dressing, although maybe the mustard was a little too dominant for my tastes. But I didnt think the salad was good enough to warrant buying rotisserie chicken, bocconcini, and roasted red peppers  items that are certainly not staples in my household.

Very tasty-left out the olives-use high quality vinegar and mustard for the dressing to give the salad a punch.

It was good!

I'm a vegetarian so I didn't eat any but my hubby says he loved it. He added quite a bit of vinegar. Also, I used whole grain melba toast from the grocery store instead of baking the Italian bread as a shortcut. The melba toast held the flavors well and did not get soggy. I think next time I might try Feta instead of the Mozzarella, which got lost in all the stronger flavors.

Bursting with varied flavor, fairly easy and healthy, we've already feasted on this twice. My only nit-pick is that the salad leans towards soggy, even when greens are kept separate till the last. It seems an innate trait. Still, looking forward to having it again.

I have made this twice now and it is absolutely divine. Great use of leftover roasted chicken, and easy to throw together. For those of you who don't like salad, I promise you'll like this. I'm not an olive person, so I substitute avocado, and I love it!

I made this on Saturday for a Salad Lunchoen I was hostessing at our home. I made six salads for 16 guests, and this one was a winner. I had to make copies of the recipe for all the women in attendance! A WINNER! (I didn't change anything and made it exactly as presented).

Very easy and delicious. Great for a weeknight meal. I also used a chicken breast from the George Forman as suggested by another reviewer.

This is like ambrosia. It is that good. I used store bought croutons and parmesan. I think the parmesan adds a zing. I also used left-over roast goose from Xmas. This recipe is a real winner! Lucy

As a weekday dinner salad, it's a winner; simple to make and very tasty. Personally, my favorite part is the mozzarella balls...hard to beat cheese!

This is a mid-week winner. Simple to prepare, delcious flavour and texture. Goes well with either white or red wine.

We had roasted chicken on Saturday night and this salad on Sunday night. What a great recipe! My husband was a little disappointed when I said we were having salad - but he really enjoyed this one.

Great quick summer dinner! I roasted my own pepper, the only deviation from the recipe. Grand

This was really tasty and easy...filling enough for dinner too. I halved the crouton recipe, it made plenty, and also halved the oil in the vinaigrette recipe...I usually do that because I don't like oily salads and it makes it a little lighter. I just grilled two chicken breasts on the George Foreman & shredded them with a fork, so I didn't have to buy a whole chicken. I found perlini, which are pearl-size mozzarella balls, they were really cute!

This was so good and very easy for a weeknight dinner. I recommend it for a very enjoyable dinner.
