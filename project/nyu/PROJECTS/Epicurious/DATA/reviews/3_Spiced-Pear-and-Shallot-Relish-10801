I made this relish for Christmas dinner and it's in the fridge right now. The suggestion to use red wine with pears seemed a bit odd, so I used white wine, an inexpensive Torontes. Otherwise I followed instructions. The diced shallots seemed a bit sharp so I pickled them in some white wine, sugar and vinegar in the fridge overnight and that mellowed them out. The overall taste here is pleasantly mild and fruity, although a touch bland. For the spice flavors to come through I would suggest leaving them in the mixture overnight for the flavors to really meld. Otherwise I'm pleased with the recipe and plan on serving it with duck.
