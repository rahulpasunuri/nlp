First time I made this with Ratna brand and the flavor & color were intense. Just made it again but couldn't get Ratna or any brand of mango puree. Ended up using Aroy-D canned mango slices in syrup. Drained them well but the color came out a pale greenish/yellow and there is NO mango flavor. So disappointing since I was making it for guests. Word to the wise - definitely use Ratna if you can find it!

Very delicious. Not hard to make. I used Ratna mango puree. Very intense flavor. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the coconut flavor so will either up the coconut milk or add some shredded coconut to the ice cream. Definitely worth making again.

The recipe is so great! So easy to make and turned out delicious. I used three ripe mangoes, 1 Alphonso and 2 Badami (another variety of mango. It's sweet and yellow compared to Alphonso's rich orange and much sweeter taste) which I then puréed.It came to 2.5 cups. I added slightly more than 3/4 cup of the coconut milk, which was a mistake because the ice cream had a very mild coconut taste to it. So stick to the measurements given to the T. Also thank you Chopi and Nightingale007! I too was unsure about using raw eggs and was wondering what I could use to substitute it. Can't wait to make it again, this time with only Alphonsos.

This turned out TO DIE FOR!! I used 3.25% whole milk (not homogenized, huge difference in taste although essentially the same thing), and 36% whipping cream. 2 overly ripe and skin starting to wrinkle altaufo mangoes. And fresh farm eggs. My husband said I need to make more right after I made the first pint! Straining the custard mixture is the key. It is hard to get a smooth custard, so strain out the chunks - let it naturally strain through and lightly scrape the sieve to get the rest through. Custards DO take lots of time and patience, and is safest to cook in a double boiler.

Wonderful! Big mango flavor from a quick, easy recipe. Can't remember the name of the brand of canned mango I used, but it was a Kesar mango, not Ratna. That made me nervous because of the recipe's specifications, but the mango flavor was excellent. I found a large can of it in the Indian food section of Wegman's. I can't remember if I doubled or tripled the recipe for my large dinner party, but still ended up with extra puree so I just went ahead and used all of it anyway because I didn't want to waste any. I served this with Basil Ice Cream and Coconut Tuiles (both recipes I also found on Epicurious) to complete a Vietnamese dinner. Perfect.

Excellent! The flavors balance nicely when using the whole 14oz can of regular coconut milk in lieu of the heavy cream. I added an additional 1/4 c of sugar (to taste) instead of corn syrup and sub'd 2% milk. The mangoes I used did not require straining and the texture was very smooth. Probably the best ice cream I've made to date.

I used the Ratna puree as well, but axed the corn syrup. Also used a bit less sugar(as the puree is sweetened) and lime juice instead of lemon. it was plenty sweet enough, beautiful color, refreshing and tasty. I topped it with toasted coconut to serve

The first time I made this recipe I made exactly as stated with a different brand of Alphonso mangos. It was fantastic. It tasted even better and fresher than a fresh mango from the grocery store. A very strong mango taste, no coconut taste. I'm making this again with the leftover ingredients (a BIG can of mango pulp) but I'm out of milk so I'm substituting coconut milk. I hope it turns out well.

Outstanding recipe - great flavors, very rich. I used 2 fresh mangoes since canned wasn't available. The mango flavor could have been more intense, but that was due to the type of mango I suppose. It was a little sweet for my taste, next time I'll cut down on the sugar a bit. I also added some toasted coconut and lemon zest after the straining step which added a nice touch (although the flakes got caught up in the ice cream maker paddle - next time I'll chop them up finer). Will definitely make again.

Fantastic recipe! i just made it for a big party and everyone loved it! the only adjustment I made was halfing the amount of corn syrup (only because I got golden corn syrup and I wasnt too sure if it was the same as light corn syrup) but it didn't really matter..cause it still turned out wonderful.

Very good. Couldn't find mango puree, so used 1 c. mango nectar and 1 c. coconut milk which gave the fininshed product a nice coconut flavor. Also didn't have light corn syrup on hand so used some honey instead. The final product was a bit too sweet, so next time I would cut down on the sugar/honey. It may have also had to do with using mango nectar rather than puree. But all in all, this was quite good and I plan to make it again.

Made This ice cream using two very ripe mangoes which produced 1 1/2 cups of puree. The only milk I had was fat free so I used that and mixed in a little cream to measure the one cup. I followed the recipe exactly for everything else. The coconut flavor is not very strong which is fine. This ice cream is delicious I couldn't stop eating it while trying to scoop in out of the ice cream freezer into a container to freeze. Can't wait to share this with friends.

I used a fresh mango as I couldn't find puree, but it only yielded 1 cup. I made up the rest by adding an extra 1/4 cup of coconut milk. I also added 1/2 cup of coconut flakes. It came out tasty; creamy and very refreshing, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. I'll eat every last drop of what I've made tonight, but I doubt I'll make it again.

Wonderful! I served this at the end of a Thai meal, and the flavors were so fresh and fun! I used the Ratna brand of canned puree, and it was very sweet. The colors came out perfectly. The flavors complemented each other well, though it is definitely more of a mango ice cream with a hint of coconut.

During the summer months I have access to fresh mangos from my friend's trees. I found this recipe to be perfect for the fresh puree. I froze some of that puree and am about to make the mango ice cream again today. Can't wait. It's yummy and a real treat during the winter!

This was WONDERFUL!!! The flavors were vibrant and fun, it was rich but not sickening. Yumm. I love that I can serve it after a Thai meal, or an Indian meal, or just for fun...

Wonderful, first time made it exactly as the recipe. Second time made the custard with cornstarch instead of eggs ( I have a problem with raw or semi raw eggs) it was great, served it with toasted coconut on top. Delish

Tested this recipe for a dinner party tonight along with the basil ice cream recipe on this web site. We & our guests all assumed we'd love this one more than the basil, so were VERY surprised that we thought the basil one won hands down. This ended up tasting much more bland tonight than when I tasted the custard last night prior to chilling it. I had to let the custard sit in my fridge overnight (as opposed to just 4 hours), as I needed time for the ice cream maker bowl to refreeze after having made the basil ice cream. Not only did I lose my wonderful fresh mango taste (I used a very ripe mango rather than canned puree), but I also lost the great orange color too -- when I took the custard from the fridge today, it was more a pale brown. I don't understand why this happened, but we liked it enough to try again & this time stick to the instructions about chilling 4 hours.

Simply fabulous! I served this for dessert last night and all my guests raved about it! I chilled the custard overnight, rather than the recommended 4 hours, and then used my Krups Ice Cream Maker - kept the custard in the ice cream maker for about a half hour and then froze the mixture in an airtight container overnight. I scooped the ice cream into wide champagne glasses and garnished with a sprig of mint - Wonderful!!!!!

I use THAI KITCHEN brand coconut milk in most of my homemade ice creams & also in general cooking, subsituting it for cream. This brand is very thick and creamy and I don't stir in the thin milk that settles at the bottom. I haven't made this recipe so I couldn't rate it but wanted to share this brand with you. Thanks.

I've made this twice using Ratna brand mango puree. I agree that one cannot discern any coconut, not that I mind. The brand of coconut milk I used was not very good and will never use it again. Maybe next time when I use my usual brand of coconut milk the flavor will come through. In any case I LOVE this recipe.

This was very refreshing and creamy. I used fruit from 2 fresh mangos that I had to use. Based on earlier review, I used 1.5 tsp of coconut extract in place of some of the vanilla because I wanted more coconut flavor. A keeper.

Intense mango flavor with alphonso mango puree. Coconut flavor barely noticeable which in my case was great because my husband dislikes coconut. Nice texture.

This is great. I used fresh pureed mangos and Drangonfly brand coconut milk which is very rich and creamy. I buy it at the local thai store. I'll be making this again and again. The kids loved this after a spicy rib dinner!
