Delish! I was curious what to pair it with, and surprisingly it worked really well with apple pie, of all things! I made a couple changes: I left out the pernod, as I don't like a strong licorice flavor, and I also only added a 1/2 c of sugar. it was great!

My licorice-loving friend enjoyed this recipe very much. The whole star anise was so expensive that this recipe would have cost me over $20/quart to make. I substituted 4 tablespoons anise powder in its place.

This ice cream was fantastic! I doubled the sugar to one cup total because I like things sweet, and also because I did not add the alcohol (which is sweet). If you like star anise and licorice flavor generally, you will adore this ice cream! Easy to make, but tastes very sophisticated.
