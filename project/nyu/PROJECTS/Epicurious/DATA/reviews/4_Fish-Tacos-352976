Think sand, sun and surf...think delicious beach food...think this fish taco prize! You may trifle with the edges, but the core of this San Diego and Baja staple can't be beat. Try it and keep the fish marinade for a go- to party fare.

Made this fish with the pickled onions, baja cream and tomatillo salsa from the Fish Taco Platter, Bon Appetit January 2006. I added around 1 1/2 TB lime juice to the marinade, which was plenty for 1 1/2 lbs of mahi mahi. I would add additional lime juice at the end next time.

Excellent flavors! I had grouper that was already cooked so I made the spice mixture and sauteed it by itself (with a bit of chopped onion and green pepper that I had on hand). Then I tossed the fish in and sauteed in the seasonings to warm it up. Also, I did not have wine vinegar so I used raw apple cider vinegar. Really delicious. The first compliment was "I love these onions!" This is the first time I've made fish tacos - now I will make them again!

Followed the recipe verbatim; delicious!

This is a delicious and simple recipe! I substituted caramelized onions for the pickled ones, and found them to add a nice sweetness to the spice and seasoning in the fish. I also used Snapper (similar to Grouper) for its mildness.

This is one of the best fish taco recipes I've tried. Healthy too. We made it for dinner last night and had the leftovers for breakfast tacos. Followed the recipe except just used 1t lime juice in low fat sour cream instead of Mexican crema (didn't have cilantro unfortunately but still good)

This was a great marinade!!! I used it with grouper and I made the "southwestern slaw" recipe on epicurious as well. It was delicious. Tip: Instead of warming the tortillas in a microwave coat with a little oil and lightly toast in a pan. Otherwise the corn tortillas fall apart when you eat them. That little bit of fat helps to keep them together.

I gave this 3 stars but with the following additions, it becomes a 4-star recipe. Add a tbsp or so of lime juice to the fish marinade and do add sliced avocado when you serve it. I also substituted ancho chilis for the jalapeno and the added smokiness seemed to suit it even better. I used cod. These were the best fish tacos we've ever had.

I haven't made this recipe. The reason is I entered Mahi Mahi with Avocado in the search bar and lo and behold this recipe came up. BUT there is are avocados in the ingredients for this recipe at all! Anyone using the search engine on this website should be careful, you don't always get what you ask for!

oh man, so good and so easy, followed it exactly besides adding some avocado...yum!

A good ,inexpensive fish recipe.I used the frozen tialpia you can buy so cheaply, but I can imagine it is awesome with fresh mahi mahi. My family loved it,especially those marinated onions. I made as written, except made my creme mexicana from the Culinary Institute recipe on site and added one half of a small chopped cabbage and made a slaw. Gave the taco a nice, cooling crunch.

I was also hesitant about the red onions but they are amazing!!! Plus, they can be used for many other things, don't leave them out!! Fish tacos can be a hit or miss in my family but everything really comes together and they were a BIG hit with everyone. Keeping this recipe as a weekly dinner. Super easy!!

I love this recipe. The tiny cubes of chopped mango are a must. Never have had time to make the fresh tomato salsa, but this recipe is outstanding. I used frozen tilapia. Also, I fry the tortillas.

This was a really tasty, light alternative to the fried fish tacos we've tried in the past. The pickled onions are amazing, so don't leave those out! (We've actually used them all week on sandwiches). Used frozen tilapia filets and I made my own "crema" with a mixture of sour cream, lime juice, and chipotle sauce, and served with a tomato/avocado salsa. Really delicious.

I made this recipe and was so impressed I had to comment. I used fresh Lake Trout and Salmon since we get it year round here in the U.P. The marinade for the fish was fantastic as well as the onions. I added fresh tomatoes,coleslaw sour cream and hot sauce to the garnishes. I have had fish tacos at a couple restaurants in Key West that were great, but have not been able to duplicate the complex flavors. That is until now.I'm super pumped this is a definite keeper. Great Lent staple.

We followed the recipe exactly for the fish and pickled onion from this recipe last night and it it was excellent. We made our own tortillas (for the first time) it was easier than you might think and really elevated the dish. I also made a cilantro coleslaw and cut up some avocado to round it out. It was a really great meal!

This is the first time I am writing a review. I had to because this fish taco recipe is fantastic. As an avid lover of fish tacos, I try them every chance I have, but this is the first recipe I have tried that really made the grade. My only modifications were to add some shredded cabbage to the onion marinade, and I omitted the Mexican crema as I did not have it or anything close. Even with the omission, it is fantastic.

Beautifully simple recipe. Well done and so very delicious. We are fish taco fans and this by far is the best recipe we've tried. We had to substitute jarred chopped red jalapenos instead of green but still turned out marvelous. Would definitely make again and again - very kid friendly too and quick dinner to serve during the week if pressed for time (providing you have a supply of the red wine vinegar onions already on hand). Since making this recipe, we've stock piled a container of the marinated onions as they will keep for up to 3 or 4 weeks.

Great recipe. Changes: can use other kinds of fresh chile or dried chile powder; when filling tacos add finely shredded green cabbage (traditional). Also, charcoal-grilling the marinated fish adds wonderful smokey flavor.

Excellent! I used champagne wine vinegar for the onions and they were beautiful and delicious. I used "rock fish" and it was flavorful.

Marinade is very good. Will use this recipe just for the marinade. If you make the tacos be sure to use all the condiments and salt! Followed recipe to a T We cooked on a cast iron pan placed on a gas grill to cut down on mess in the house. Would rate higher but I haven't had many fish tacos to compare it with!

Easy and delicious! The onions really make all of the other flavors work. I had to make a few subsitutions (serrano for jalapeno; frozen cilantro cubes for fresh), but followed the main directions. We loved having really tasty fish tacos without frying or grilling. So much flavor!

Skipped the crema, added a coleslaw with red onion, a little yellow pepper and pineapple - delish! We like to eat with little bowls full of things to add to our dinner, mostly chopped veggies. Works great with this dish.

So delicious. The onions make a really nice contrast in flavors between spicy and sweet/sour. I mixed srichacha with sour cream to make a spicy cream sauce instead of mexican crema. I can't wait to have this again for lunch tomorrow!

I've used this recipe solely for the fish marinade, and it is spectacular! I serve the fish on grilled chipotle tortillas with shredded cheese, cabbage, sour cream, salsa, and black beans. It is my favorite go-to dinner by far!

Rating: 4
My whole family agreed that this was one of the best dinners they've ever eaten. Instead of corn tortillas, I used Mediterranean flatbread, warmed and brushed with olive oil. Also, I added a 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika to the fish marinade for a smoky, grilled flavor. Instead of the crema, I made a mayo/lime sauce with capers. A huge hit which was perfect for a late summer meal.

Rating: 4
This has become one of my top go-to recipes, especially on weeknights when I don't have a lot of time to kill cooking up something fancy. The marinade is just killer, and it works with just about any white-fish you can find, even the cheap frozen stuff. Whip this up with some pico de gallo, some cheese, and a little extra jalapeno, and you've got a killer dinner.

I have made this dish several times and it's always amazing. Like the recipe says, we now always have the pickled onions on hand for other dishes and the vinegar is great for salads. We usually use talapia.

These were great! I used corn tortillas an lightly grilled them on a grill pan for a few moments. Marinate is great on cod. I also made black beans and braised onion, mango salsa, and had sides of red cabbage, onion and cilantro, and grilled corn on the cob. Yummy for summer!

Fabulous marinade. Made this for guests and had several first timers for fish tacos and they loved it. I served it with the coleslaw from the baja fish tacos, mexican crema and tropical salsa (mango, papaya, pineapple, jalapeno, cilantro, red onion, black beans, lime juice, olive oil, s&p)...on fresh corn tortillas. A definite repeat

This is a great recipe. It can be adjusted to taste. I used just enough oil to coat the fish with the seasonings. I plan to make this recipe often over the summer!

Rating: 4
Loved this--agree with other reviewers about using less oil... unfortunately I only read the reviews AFTER I had started marinating the fish, but next time--and there WILL be a next time!--I would use less. Shredded cabbage is a must for the crunch, and avocado is ESSENTIAL for any fish tacos. Also added extra chopped japelenos, more cilantro, black beans, salsa and lime as garnishes. The pickled onions were great as well.

Rating: 3
Based on previous reviews I doubled the spices which was a good call. I think I will cut down on the oil next time. It didn't seem like a lot but once I threw the fish in the pan oil was spattering everywhere and I think it was overkill. Any mild white fish will work in this dish. The pickled onions were good (I made them the day before) but certainly nothing that wowed me. However, they worked with the taco, I just wouldn't make extras. I'll make this again but it needs tweaks (spices doubled, less oil).

Rating: 4
You could make this with a cheaper fish, like tilapia, if needed. The key is fresh, homemade tortillas. With them, this is a 4-Fork review (watch the video). And I used a homemade tomatillo salsa, chopped cabbage, and sour cream.

Really simple and delicious. I live in Mexico and this rivals what you can buy at the local taco stands. I even didn't have all the ingredients, added a few of my own like you see on the tables here, like avocado and fresh tomato if you don't want to make the salsa. Delicious.

I have made this recipe MANY times - and every time my family requests it again and again and again. And that it is so easy, makes it all the better! We add shrimp to it and that is a nice alternative to have both the shrimp and the fish. And I also always make the Mexican Crema recipe - it adds a lot versus regular sour cream. This is an exceptional recipe.

The fish was delicious. I used mahi mahi, and the marinade got rave reviews. I tripled the spices, doubled the fish, and still used 1/4 cup olive oil. I used completely different sides - the Southwestern Slaw and the Chipotle Pico de Gallo listed for the baja fish tacos on this site. Added the texture others thought was missing, and had a great flavor profile.

Traditional receipe which is best served with a fresh Salsa Cruda sometimes called Pico de Gallo. This is fresh tomato and white onions chopped dressed with lime and some pickled or fresh jalapeno added. I serve this often using cod and this receipe is fine but needs the salsa for texture and chiles to bring out the subtile flavors. If not it will be bland.

To A Cook from Richmond Virginia who thought there was little texture because everything was soft, we added a little Mexican slaw Baja Style, and with the added crunch, these were wonderful.

I think this could probably benefit from a crunchy cabbage garnish and a tangy white sauce. This is how I make the sauce that I spoon over fish tacos: 1/3 c mayo, thin with milk, Add lime juice, roasted ground cumin seed and tapatio hot sauce to taste. Season with salt and pepper.

I liked this recipe, but wanted a battered, fried end product, so combined this recipe with the beer batter from the Bon Appetit recipe. Added fresh tomatoes and cilantro, avocado to the tacos. My husband, who is not a fish lover, raved on them! I was delighted. It will be repeated regularly in our home.

Simply amazing. The onions add an explosion of flavor and once you have everything marinated, preparing this dish is super easy.

Just made this today with left over cod from dinner last night. I just flaked the cod with some olive oil and cumin and oregano to warm it up, and place it on top of the war tortillas (don't like to use microwave, so warmed it up as directed in the mini oven). The onions are definitely a must - used white balsamic with some red wine because that's what I had in my pantry. Delicious!

This recipe just didn't do it for me. Everything tasted just a little bland. I'll stick with the Epicurious recipe for lime and red cabbage tacos (for chicken or fish) - that was truly worth making again!

I love this recipe with mahi mahi, as it holds together nicely and its flavor stands up well to the seasoning in the marinade. I'd rate this recipe 4 forks if it weren't for the onions marinated in the red wine vinegar, which totally takes over.I marinate them in 2 tbsp. lime juice as called for in another recipe on this site and that works perfectly to add zing.

Rating: 4
I made this by the recipe with one exception. I used hard shell tacos instead of the soft. My husband loved this recipe. I would however make two other modifications when I make it next time. For texture, I will stay with the hard tacos. I will use less oil in the marinade. I would also finish the fish in a hot oven to crisp it up a little. I bought really good quality fish. That made a big difference I think. Overall a pretty tasty recipe. I would have given it 3 forks, but my husband wanted the 4.

Rating: 4
I thought that the marinade was a little bland so added about 2 tablespoons of lime juice to the mix and also chose to put sea salt in the marinade prior to cooking the dish. It turned out DELICIOUS! The Queso Fresca didn't really hit the spot for the creamy kick so added some chipolte mayo that really had a nice blend to the mix.

Rating: 1
I made this recipe exactly as written - correct fish, real ancho chili powder, fresh herbs. I probably won't make it again. The flavors were fine but the texture was BORING. The fish is soft. The shells are soft. The salsa is soft. The quesa is soft. The ONLY texture comes from the pickled onion. If I were to bother with this again I would definitely fry the corn tortillas to make crispy shells and I would probably also add some crunchy lettuce and anything else I could find to perk up the mouth feel. All in all - not worth wasting good fish on this.

This is a winner! Made it for dinner tonight, and whipped up a Mango-Avocado salsa which made it perfect... I have placed this in my all- time favorite list. Like some of the other reviewers here, I was a little hesitant to make the onion pickles. But I did it anyway, and later wished that I had made more to keep in the refrigerator. We used frozen haddock, and since there wasn't enough, supplemented it with tilapia. That worked well and the family fought over the last bit of fish! We will definitely be doing this again soon.

I have a great fish taco recipe I've been using for years but it calls for frying in a beer batter. I recently managed to lose 15 lbs and wanted to lighten up my recipe and will try this one. I will add the fork rating once I try it but wanted to add some comments now. Talapia has always been a favorite and should hold up well for this recipe. I have been serving my tacos with shredded red cabbage tossed with balsamic vinegar and seasoned with salt and pepper - fantastic. Since I love red onions, I will try marinating thinly sliced red onion in red vinegar and then toss with the red cabbage.

My first fish taco attempt. Used cod-needed a little more kick to the marinade. Will try with heartier peppers and lime zest too. Added shredded cabbage-nice addition. Even though I want to tweak it a little, I liked the blend of flavors. I will make this again and invite friends to enjoy too!

I made these last night with perch and they were SO GOOD. I like that you marinate the fish in olive oil and then don't add any more oil to the pan. The exterior of the fish got nice and browned, yet they were still juicy and there is no guilt about eating fish and olive oil!

Ummmm, what am I missing? This was good, but not great. Based on the other reviews I expected to love the onions, but I found them distracting at best. I had really tasty corn tortillas, I took the time to make crema and pico de gallo, the fish was cooked properly, as far as I could tell, but the result was really no better than just "good". I'll make something else next time. And I'm still looking for that killer fish taco recipe.

Followed the advice of the previous reviewer who suggested using equal parts sour cream, yogurt and mayo flavored with adobo sauce from chipotle peppers. Great! Used 4 tsp. of my own chili blend, which contains ample parts cumin, oregano and ground chiles instead of the individual spices called for. My husband and I both thought the vinegar taste of the onions was too prominent and interfered with our enjoyment of the fish (mahi mahi). Maybe a balsamic-based marinade would be nicer -- any suggestions?

The red onions added some great flavor, but the marinade needed more spice. I'd replace the ground ancho chile powder with a spicier ground pepper. This would be better with a crunchy taco, as the corn tortillas have a somewhat mealy consistency. I'd also add shredded lettuce or cabbage instead of cilantro. I found the cilantro competed too much with the other flavors. Overall, worth making again.

This was great. I actually grilled the fish on the barbeque (using an oiled perforated plate so that it doesn't fall through the grills) and it was fantastic. For the fish I used Tilapia, which has a nice taste, flakes easily and takes the marinade well. I agree with another reviewer that the red onions should be done a day before or so and then they truly become pickled. Definitely serve with the Southwestern Slaw which is SO easy and really tasty (also done a day ahead is best IMO). I'll definitely make this again, probably as a do-it-yourself taco bar for a party.

Pairs well with a Mexican chopped salad (including black beans and queso fresco) as a side dish.

This was an absolutely marvelous recipe! I substituted habenero chili powder instead of the milder ancho and used much less as a result. It gave it some real kick. The creme frieche was a perfect complement. My husband proclaimed it was one of his favorite meals ever. I've already made it again.

Rating: 3
Really tasty, and pretty quick and easy. The onions were delicious. Fish could have used a bit more spice, and the tacos could maybe use something a little crunchy: red cabbage? Also, a tangy sauce could be a good accompaniant instead of sour creme. In all a good dish, just needs a little something something to give it more kick.
