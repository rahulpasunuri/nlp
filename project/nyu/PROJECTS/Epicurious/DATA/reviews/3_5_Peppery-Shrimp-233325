I should have listened to the other reviewers, but wanted to try it as written the first time. The Dijon IS overwelming and should be cut in half and I'm a big Dijon fan, but it just drowned out the other flavors, which were very good. I will make it again and cut the oil and Dijon in half. I think with a little adjustment, this will become a four star keeper. It's light, easy and very different tasting. I served with a blended rice and green beans, but would be a good topping for a summer salad, also. Good, quick, easy week night meal.

Used pre-cooked shrimp, let them marinate for a few hours, then put them under the broiler briefly because I didn't want to serve them cold. I thought they were ok - but I think my guests liked them better than I did. If I make them again, I'd use more red pepper, and maybe a little more salt than the reciped calls for. I thought they were kind of bland. However, there weren't any left at the end of the party!

This is a terrific appetizer and is made easier by using cucumber instead of rice crackers as it holds better. I've made it many times, always get rave reviews. It is an easy cocktail grazing food and even looks pretty. A winner.

a crowd-pleaser. i wish i had added a little more red pepper for my taste, but was probably about right for feeding a crowd.

This was amazing. I opted to use big (16-20/lb.) shrimp and removed the tails before marinading for 4hrs. Then popped them on the grill 2-to-a-skewer for a delicious pre-BBQ appetizer. Everyone LOVED it and it was so quick - about 1 minute each side. Definitely will make this again.

I served this to good reviews. I was a little heavy-handed with the hot pepper, so I also made a remoulade sauce to cool it down.

I, too, used pre-cooked shrimp because of the time factor and poured the marinade on them in a plastic bag. I left them for about three hours and then let them finish thawing on the buffet table. I was worried that the marinade might not penetrate especially since my shrimp were partially thawed but it did. This recipe worked great and they were the hit of the New Year's Eve gathering.

I made this last night for a cocktail party and everyone loved it. I used precooked shrimp from trader joes and just defrosted it, then made the dressing and poured it in with the shrimp, stuck it in the fridge for a couple of hours and served it cold. It was delicious and so very simple!
