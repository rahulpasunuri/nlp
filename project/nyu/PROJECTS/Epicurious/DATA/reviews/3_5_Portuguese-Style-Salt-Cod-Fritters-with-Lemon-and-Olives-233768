My family's recipe calls for beating the egg whites separately and folding in gently once the "pasteis" are well mixed. You can add more or less egg white to manage consistency. For some extra spice and flavor, we add "pimenta moida", which are chopped hot peppers available here in the States in jars under the Progresso label in most supermarkets.

I wanted something a little different to do with salt cod and came upon this recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to follow Lisete Alves' version, found here in the reviews...it was more like we do it here in Nova Scotia. So, having said that, this was delicious! I am putting it into my rotation.

Update The original recipe doesn't include cilantro, only chopped parsley, and also the salt cod is soaked in plain water, changing it often or, better yet, under running water (small stream, just enough to keep it moving) and cooked (boiled) along with the potatoes. Also, our recipe calls for more cod than described in the recipe, as well as more eggs. And by the way, substituting salt cod for fresh cod results in a completely diferent dish, trust me! here's one of the recipes we actually use in Portugal: 750g sal cod, thick, soaked 1,200kg potatoes 4 or 5 eggs 1 onion 1/2 cup chopped parsley ground pepper Peel the potatoes and boiled them, along with the cod, until cooked (about 20 minutes). Drain well and let cool down until you can handle it without burning yourself. Mash the potatoes very finelly. Tear apart the cooked cod (removing ALL the bones and skin) and, making it into a ball, put in the middle of a clean kitchen cloth, close it and squezze it well, to drain the rest of the water out and to shread the cod to threads. Mix the potato puree with the cod , the finelly chopped onion and the parsley and pepper to taste and mix well. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat well with a wood spoon (more resistent). Shape the cakes ("bolinhos de bacalhau" means actually "little cakes of cod") with the help of 2 dessert spoons or with your hand wet in cold water (wet them often so that the batter doesn't stick to your hands). Fry the cakes in hot oil (oil or olive oil, or a mix of the 2), until golden. Perfect if served with a nice black eyed pea salad with "molho verde" (chopped onion + chooped parsley + olive oil + vinager) or portuguese tomato risotto! Hugs! And enjoy the bolinhos de bacalhau.

Hello everyone! Just FYI : the name of this recipe in native Portuguese is "Pasteis de Bacalhau" or "Bolinhos de Bacalhau" (depending on the region of Portugal). The original recipe doesn't include cilantro, only chopped parsley, and also the salt cod is soaked in plain water, changing it often or, better yet, under running water (small stream, just enough to keep it moving) and cooked (boiled) along with the potatoes. Hugs! And enjoy the bolinhos de bacalhau (how we call it in Porto)! And if you want to know more about salt cod and recipes : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacalhau

The correct Portuguese name for this dish is Pasteis de Barcalao. Barcalao is the generic name or word for cod. The cod should be brought just to a simmer, when it flakes easily. Overcooking or boiling it will toughen the cod.

I was really surprised by how much I liked this dish. Rather than buying dried salt cod as the recipe called for, I just bought normal frozen cod so I used 2 pds instead of just 1 pd. Otherwise, I cooked the recipe exactly as directed. It was surprisingly light considering the potatoes. I did not have a problem with the fritters falling apart. I refrigerated them for 2 hours before cooking. I served this dish with a creamy cilantro dipping sauce. It was great!

Liked it, didn't love it. The flavour of the cod and herbs were lost in the sheer volume of potato. And the cakes fell apart too easily - the two eggs weren't enough to bind it. If I were to make it again, I would use one less potato.
