excellent, was asked repeatedly for the recipe, I have made this over and over, they are always gone. The recipe always works, I have replaced some of the Tahini with light mayo (I ran out of Tahini) and it was excellent also.

This was a delicious recipe, would definitely make again. I only made half the sauce and used a bit less lemon juice (I only had one lemon), but it tasted wonderful. Definitely needs a bit of salt but otherwise I didn't change or add anything. We made them into a chicken pita sandwich, added a few tomatoes and lettuce. Also used poached, shredded chicken breasts. What a great idea for an appetizer!

Ecellent! Easy and delicious. Great as appetizer or meal. Recommend making only 1/2 only half of the sauce.

Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and people couldn't get enough of it. I used up all the dressing though. Also, skipped the pine nuts because I didn't have it at home. Still the result was delicious. I served the chicken on Olive Pita Bread. Will make it again.

I have made this numerious times. It is easy and very tasty and everyone always wants the recipe. I don't know what the other people are saying with too much lemon etc. I do the recipe just like it is and its always a hit. In fact I'm printing to copies for out of town guests.

Needs Doctoring! I agree with the previous reviews about the tahini being too strong. But, I had to use at least 2 t. of salt to balance out all the lemon. In the end, I doctored up the dressing with 2 T Honey, 1 T Soy Sauce, 1 t. cumin (good suggestion, whoever said that eariler), and I added 1/2 c. red onion to the chicken mixture. Finally, served on seaweed rice crackers because I didn't have time to make the pitas (too busy doctoring up the salad). People liked it, but I probably won't make it again.

This was such an easy and delicous meal. I made the tahini sauce a little thinner than called for and drizzled it over the hot chicken. I'll definitely be making this again.

this was okay but nothing special. and my pita rounds puffed up a bit in the oven making me lose half of them unless i put the filling INSIDE. strange.

Served this at a cocktail party and it was delicious. I recommend a mild roasted tahini like Maranathna and found no need to change the proportions. I simplified the pitas by buying small rounds and cutting into triangles - less waste than trying to create bite-size rounds.

I actually really liked this recipe. Made it for a dinner, people loved it. Also works great as a topping for big plate of salad. You definitely have to double the chicken (or halve the tahini). I buy boneless/skinless chicken breasts, chop the chicken into chunks and sautee it in butter, salt, pepper, and scallions before adding it to the other ingredients. Just delicious.

Just made it for our cocktail party. People really liked it and it was very easy to prepare. After reading reviews, I halved the tahini and added cumin. This seemed just about right. Did not purchase the chicken but cooked several boneless, skinless, chix breasts. Will make again!

If you're not a fan of tahini, try a different nut butter thinned out with a little water and/or olive oil. Almond, cashew or even peanut butter will be milder and more accessible, while keeping in the spirit of things. Just a suggestions

Just fyi, the sauce preparation in this recipe is not hummus, it is tahini sauce (no chickpeas).

not much flavor, a disappointment.

I agree, the receipe seemed to have way too much Tahini, though I attributed that to fact that I haven't really used Tahini much in the past and need to acquire a taste for it. Many guests really loved it, some not at all--a mixed bag, maybe not worth the effort.

A friend made this with commercial hummus and it was fabulous. Making the hummus from scratch (like the recipe) made it inedible!! And I followed the recipe to a T as well!! Strange??!!

Maybe I just don't get tahini, but I couldn't even swallow the bite I had of this right after I finished making it. Maybe I had bad tahini. It was a new jar, I dunno. I followed the recipe to a t, and my chicken salad had WAY more tahini dressing in it than the stuff in the picture. My batch was unsalvable. My dog even gave me a funny look. Glad y'all had better luck.

Very easy make-ahead appetizer that everyone loved!!

I would make this again cutting the tahini in half. There is way to much tahini the way it is written. I also used toasted pecans.

I really liked this dressing, but, unlike one of the previous reviewers, wished that it tasted _more_ of tahini. I added a bit more tahini and cumin, as another reviewer suggested, but other than that, kept the proportions the same. I used it to dress a salad of cooked chicken and copped red bell peppers--it was quite good. Don't forget to add the salt!

This is a nice change from our ordinary Chicken Salad and make a great summertime lunch or dinner. Found that adding toasted cumin, tumeric and a splash of white wine vinegar helped to cut the somewhat overpowering tahini and gave the dish a fantastic color and depth of flavor.
