This was awesome. I added two jalapenos. Mighty tasty. I don't have a gas stove and was too lazy to turn on the grill so I ended up broiling the tomatillos. It took longer than I though, but the outcome was fab. First time I had ever used fresh tomatillos.

This was excellent! Great recipe for uncooked tomatillo sauce. I put all the ingredients in the food processor and served it with tortilla chips at an early 4th of July picnic. Easy to scoop; everyone loved it. I doubled it because I had the ingredients and wanted leftovers. Today I'm having it on grilled chicken breasts. A keeper for regular summer rotation.

I too used Kosher salt; Doubled garlic. Friends loved this recipe! Even better the next day, flavors meld together nicely.

This is a very tasty salsa, but it turned out a bit watery. Perhaps the tomatillos need to be seeded. I chopped the ingredients roughly and put them all into the food processor. It was a breeze to make.

This is a great salsa - I had a very similar one in Santa Fe. I double the recipe for my dishes. Especially excellent with a summer squash enchillada.

My new favorite salsa! I, too, used kosher salt, and mixed in the cuisineart. Everybody loved it.

This is a great and fast recipe. I substitued the tomatillos with green tomatoes. 3 medium sized tomatoes weighed 1 pound. Definately omit the seeds in the Serrano (Jalepeno) peppers if you don't like spicy. I added juice of two medium limes. I suggest this with the green tomatoes since it lacks the tart of the tomatillo. Also, start light on the salt and then add more to your liking. I believe people like a salty and tangy sauce. Also, I use Kosher salt. Blender works fine.

I made this with the tomatillos from my garden and brought into work and it was a big hit! Definitely will make again!

We had just picked some fresh tomatillo from our local organic farm and had no idea what to do with them. This recipe has made me fall in love with the tomatillo. Fantastic. We made it really spicy.

Salsa was too sweet for my tastes. I added 1/2 a green pepper and it was still too sweet. I then added extra garlic and onion powder to salvage the dip.

Sooo excellent! Best kept refrigerated overnight. Added a touch of chipotle chili in adobo (comes in a can). Perfection.

Wonderful . . . I used the Cuisinart to process.

I made this to take to the farmer's market (we are a participating vendor) and all I can say is: OH MY GOD! People could not believe how absolutely yummy this tasted. It is best to 'marinate' overnight in the fridge. One thing...I did add 1 extra serrano chile. Everyone seemed to like the 'extra' kick. This one was preferred over the tomato/tomatillo salsa by many....Definitely a winner by far!!!

Mmmmm...this is awesome. I served atop grilled pork tenderloin. Found fresh tomatillos at the Farmer's Market. Didn't have cilantro, so used dried coriander. Verrrrry yuuuumy.

Quite a success at a recent party -- and we live in Phoenix, salsa capital of the world. Very Unusual, and a great addition to regular tomato salsa and guacamole. will make again, but probably more of a summertime dish.

To the cook from Wisconsin I am from Mukwonago and there is an excellant Mexican Grocery store in Waukesha on Racine Ave. Our local Pick n Saves also carry the tomatillos (fresh) but the Super Amigo also carries canned tomatillos.

Tomatillo salsa is the perfect complement to pork

Wisconsin - do you have a super walmart in your area? Check there - they've expanded their Mexican food section lately...

Hello Illinois! I live in Wisconsin, and would love to make this salsa. However, I cannot find the tomatillo anywhere. Where did you find yours? I would imagine at a Mexican food market in Chicago.

I found myself eating this on everything - and in fact roasted a chicken just to have something else to put it on! If you have not had tomatillos before (neither had I prior to making this salsa) - they taste much as you might imagine a pickled green tomato might - piquant, even a bit crunchy - and the perfect accent to spice up nachos, steamed veggies, and roasted chicken... wonderful! I went through the half-batch I made last weekend - and today am making a full batch. This keeps great, is low-cal, easy to make, and tasty - what more do you want?
