This was great. I substituted 2 tbsp of coconut flour for the all purpose flour and it still turned our beautifully.

Delicious! I used whole leek and combined feta and mozzarella. Very rich brunch. I will make it again next weekend when we have guests coming over.

This hasn't come out of the oven yet, but first thought is that it's actually pretty expensive when you add up the feta, Greek yogurt, etc. I made two of these for a teachers' lunch at my kids' school and it was a pretty hefty tab in the end!

I added a bit more onion, feta and dill, and it turned out perfectly. An easy tasty meal.

Very tasty, only suggestion would be to add more feta or salt. It needed a bit more savory flavor. definitely will make it again!
