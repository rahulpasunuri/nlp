We scarfed this up and completely ignored the entree! Perhaps it's not very elegant, but it is really good, and every once in a while this Epicurious cook likes to be reminded of simple, hearty dishes that come together in a snap and please the whole family. This is one of those, and we will definitely make it again.

I made this for a dinner party last night. The menu required a simple salad and this fit perfectly and was so easy to make. I think the dressing used makes a big difference. I mixed red wine vinaigrette and balsamic vinaigrette together and it had great flavor. I also added chopped cucumber and a lot more green onions. I omitted the bacon for this serving but will use this as a 'Tried & Proven" standard recipe. As for quantity, doubling the recipe was plenty for 6.

I used homemade dressings and added dark, leafy greens like red butter lettuce, but it's a good, basic, version of a Cobb. I thought the previous reviewer sounded pretty snooty. A recipe is a recipe! They don't have to be difficult to qualify and some of the best cooking is simply done. I'm a bacon lover and know it's naughty of me so a Cobb gives me that taste without being too much of a good thing!

I don't know why this "recipe" is on this website. It doesn't belong here. It's ridiculous!
