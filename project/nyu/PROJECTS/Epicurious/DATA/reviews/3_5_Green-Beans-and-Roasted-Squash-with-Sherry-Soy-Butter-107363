I wasn't terribly impressed with the sherry soy butter. It just didn't taste like much to me, and it didn't do anything for the roasted squash (which was delicious -- but I'd rather have it with another flavor profile).

I made this with 3 lbs squash and maybe 3/4 lb beans, 1/4 c butter, 1-1/2 tbsp soy sauce and 1-1/2 tbsp cane vinegar. Could've used even less butter. Still, yum.

Even the squash haters in my family loved this. I have made it twice and both times there were no left overs

Why haven't I known how wonderful roasted squash is? Incredible. However, I like my version a little better. I combined this recipe with the "green beans with roasted onions" also on this website. Used their chicken broth-based sauce instead of this recipe's soy sauce. The squash, beans and roasted onions on a platter are fabulous.

I have a question: so when you serve the squash, it still has the peel on?

Rave reviews from everyone. My wife said this was the best way she has ever had squash.

Green beans without the sauce were nothing to write home about, but with the sauce - oh soo yummy. But what wouldn't be with 1/2 cup butter!!! Squash was amazing, but I think next time I'll brown it even more as I found myself looking for the most browned pieces in the bowl.

Raves at Thanksgiving. Surprising, given the white-carbohydrate lovers I call family. I don't care much for green beans, but loved this. The squash was great. I used organic butter and the sauce came out fantastic. Would also be great with just the squash. I agree that it looks beautiful, especially in a crystal bowl.

I made this as part of the overall Asian-inspired Thanksgiving meal featured in this issue. Loved the potential of the beans and the butternut squash pre-sherry soy butter. But, alas, there's nothing so sad as potential unfulfilled. The butter smothered the sherry and soy sauce flavor. So instead of popping and grooving with tantalizing Asian-inspired flavor, the beans and squash lounged with confused identity on the sidelines. However, they did add color, texture and vitamins.

This is an easy and quick to make,very attractive and very good dish which complements any roast meat or fish. I have made it several times already!

The sherry soy butter gave the green beans a good lift. Roasted butternut squash is great by itself, but the soy butter was a nice touch. I'd definitely use the soy butter in other vegetable dishes.

I really liked this dish! Especially the butternut squash and butter sauce! Asparagus happened to be on sale when I was up for trying this dish, so I subbed it for the green beans (starting the cooking process for the asparagus at the point where you add the green beans to the baking pan) and loved the butter sauce over the asparagus! Would definitely make this dish again!

The presentation of this recipe was a 5, however I would give the green beans a 1 and the squash a 2.

Squash was delicious even without the butter. The oven roasting with the olive oil brought out a wonderful buttery taste. The green beans were ok but not great even with the butter. Will use the butter on other vegetables too.
