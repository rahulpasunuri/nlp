This is a great recipe. I did add a half a grated onion as suggested, and cut down the sugar to two tsp brown only but next time would skip it alltogether since the potato is sweet enough. I served them with greek yogurt mixed with cilantro chutey. Delish. Next time i might add a little more onion but that's just a matter of taste.

Wow! It was so simple to just mix everything together and plop them in mounds into the hot oil. I read ALL the reviews beforehand and did make a couple changes that I think made a big difference. I omitted the granulated sugar, I used only 1/4 cup of milk, and I added about 1/4 cup of chopped white onion. While I was frying up the remainder I stuck the done ones on a pan and placed them in the oven to keep them warm while I finished. All in all, super simple and delicious. Topped with apricot applesauce because I had it on hand but didn't like it. Next time I will try Greek yogurt to see how it combats the spiciness. But they are still perfect without ANY topping whatsoever. Cheers!

Perhaps a bit too sweet, but none-the-less superb. I did find it difficult to fry as they stuck like glue to the pan. SO ended up in globs and not flaky cakes. But good anyway.

These latkes came out great - what a nice change of pace for Chanukah! I eliminated the white sugar (only used the 1 tsp. of brown sugar), and I substituted soy milk for milk because of allergies. I topped the latkes with a simple cooked compote of bosc pear (peeled, cored and chunked), dried cherries and cinnamon stick, which I cooked over low heat till the pears broke down a bit. YUM!

I made these the other day with my brother and they were fantastic. I ended up adding a little bit of onion in with the sweet potato, when I put it through the food processor and I also grated some fresh ginger into the mix right before frying them up. Served with some apple sauce and plain Greek yogurt, they were a great treat.

I have made this every year for the past six or seven years, and it never fails to go over big! I ramp up the heat, doubling the cayenne and curry. I'll sometimes substitute soy milk to make the recipe parve, though I love using sour cream for a cooling condiment with the finished latkes. I have tried it with various oils and I think that the peanut oil gives it the best flavor.

Absolutely delicious. Latkes are typically too bland to interest me, even with the addition of the traditional sour cream and applesauce (which are also bland). The blend of spices in this recipe makes for a wonderfully compelling and balanced flavor. I agree with other commenters that only a little milk is needed. I served these with Roasted Poblano-Pineapple Salsa (as a zesty alternative to applesauce) and Curried Lime Greek Yogurt (instead of sour cream). Both recipes are on epicurious. I set it all alongside some Curried Butternut Squash and Red Lentil Soup and Peach Prosecco Spritzers for a great goodbye to summer, and welcome to fall cuisine. (Both those recipes are on epicurious as well.)

These were fantastic especially once we put enough salt in the batter. Apple Sauce makes a great compliment and we ate them as we cooked them with a cold beer and strawberries in a "kitchen picnic".

Oh yum! I doubled this recipe and tweaked it a bit (to use what I had on hand, nothing major)and omitted the sugars(not my thing). They were a huge hit. I should have quadrupled it! Served them with Greek yogurt and split pea soup. I will make these again and again. I'm going to try baking next time for kicks.

Fabulous! Make these every year, and always get raves!! I just used regular vegetable oil for frying.

This was a real treat and I couldn't recommend it enough. I made these for a Channukah party and they tasted so well rounded. Sweet. Spicy. Exotic. Two differences: Instead of cayenne, I used Hot Spanish paprika, and I had no milk on hand so I used sour cream.

Rating: 4
I made these last week for Hannukah. They were a BIG hit! Based on others' reviews, I left out the white sugar and just used the brown sugar. I also used low-fat milk; those were my only changes. The latkes were great -- fried easily, drained well and tasted really good. My family liked the kick from the cayenne. I served the latkes with non-fat sour cream with a a little homemade rhubarb chutney mixed in. These are a really nice change from the usual latke recipe!

I made these as a unique side dish for Christmas dinner. They were wonderful! I was afraid my family might think they were too different but they loved them. In fact I made them again today for my husband and me!

This was my first time ever making latkes, and a great success! I used 1/4 of milk as was suggested. I would actually have preferred them a little spicier, but my family enjoyed them very much.

I make these almost every year, when I am bored with regular Potato latkes. Great. I don't add any milk, added enough of the flour mixture till I got the right consistency, I thought milk might make them too battery, without milk, these are delicious and very light and crispy.

My husband would have put 4 - he said they were the best latkes he's ever had. I think they were a little too sweet - next time i'll cut the sugar to 1 tsp and up the salt a bit - maybe even add more curry and/or some fresh ginger - all in all very yummy - and I DO NOT like latkes

My daughter made these as her first attempt at latkes, and they were unbelievably delicious. She did have to be cautious about how much milk to add, so as not to have too wet a mixture. They were delicious with chutney, excellent with sour cream for those who are timid about curry spices,

These were horrible. And I don't think I've ever written that about anything on EPICURIOUS. Soggy and far too sweet.

I made these tonight for the first time, and they were very tasty and perfectly spiced. I agree with other reviewers that only 1/4 c milk (or less) is necessary to achieve the right consistently. I substituted Splenda for the sugar and served the pancakes with 2% Greek yogurt & mango chutney. Next time, I'd consider adding some green onions to the mix, and maybe serving with the following curry-lime yogurt sauce: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Curry-Lime-Yogurt-233370

Fabulous. I've been making them every year for Chanuka, with very positive results. Of course, these are quite spicy, so make sure to make something more mild for guests who prefer non-spicy foods. Say, your mother-in-law ;).

My daughter made these for us last week. They were great. We put some plain yogurt on them, which sort of "cooled" the spice -- nice combo.

these are so yummy- even good eaten cold the next day! they remind me a bit of onion bahgi's, from an indian restaurant, could add onion or make both onion latkes and sweet potato latkes. they were a hit, though not traditional.

I just made these tonight, and they were quick, easy, and delicious. I used a 1/4 cup measure to portion out and flatten the batter--a tablespoon didn't sound right. It was nice that the shredded sweet potatoes kept fresh for a while. They don't turn brown and spoil like white potatoes, plus they have very little water, so you don't have to drain them.

First time making latkes and I wanted something a little more unusual. These were absolutely delicious. I prepared these for a Spring party but forgot all about them so I made them the next day. I just strained the leftover juices out. When I orginally made them, I used only about 1 tbsp. of milk in the batter and thought it was just the perfect amount. I didn't have sour cream but I had a pineapple salsa that I poured over them. Yum.....

Rating: 4
Easy and delicious. Made it for a party and it was a big hit - everyone loved it. I agree with other reviewers that it calls for too much milk. I used less than half of what the recipe called for and would probably use even less next time. The citrus yogurt sauce was excellent with it. The sauce doesn't wow you by itself but it's great with the latkes.

So delicious! Doesn't even need a sauce, but is good with sauce from Broiled Salmon with Orange/Lime Yoghurt Sauce

so yummy! man o man! i served it with the broiled salmon with citrus yogurt sauce. someone else had mentioned that was good, so i tried it out! this is kind of like a pakora pancake (i bet a little onion would make it even better!)...i served it with mango chutney!!! so delish!!!

Yum Yum! I made them for a party last night and everyone wanted the recipe. I trippled the recipe, but only doubled the milk, which was perfect. To the cook from Portland, my guess is too much milk made it soggy. Mine came out crispy and delicious! I wouldn't use them instead of the traditional latkes, but certainly as an additional dish!

Rating: 2
I was pretty disappointed with these, after really looking forward to them. The flavor is fine (don't forget the salt!), but the consistency is off and I could not get them crispy. I thought my oil wasn't hot enough, but an adjustment didn't help. Maybe I used too much flour? If anyone has suggestions, I'd appreciate it because I would love to make them again. The idea is great, but they were quite soggy and mushy, which is not the texture I was going for.

Delicious. Tripled the recipe. Used Lite Coconut milk instead of cow's milk but only used 1/4 cup and it was still too wet. Added more flour, green onions, and wished I had salted them more. But yum, yum, yum! (also, I use organic cayenne so be careful if you do too - @1/8 tsp was almost too much!

Thanks for the great advice, Chicago! Have you ever tried re-frying them so they crisp back up? I made sweet potato latkes last night (I used the other version on this site, which doesn't use sugar, milk or baking powder, but added the yummy curry, cumin and cayenne) and they were a hit even with my skeptical husband. We put a couple in the freezer as an experiment and will try the same with our potato latkes.

To the cook from Birmingham, AL, yes you can also freeze traditional latkes. We've done this for years. My mother visits at Thanksgiving and makes mountains of latkes for me, which I freeze for my annual Hanukkah party. We cook them all the way and lay them out on disposable foil cookie sheets. When cool, I cover the foil cookie sheet with more foil and deposit the foil cookie sheet into a jumbo Hefty zip bag and stack them in the freezer. To rewarm, I do it in the over with the top foil removed until hot and recrisped. The advantage is a much less stressful Hanukkah party (or just latkes all winter). The disadvantage is that they are not quite as good as fresh! Good luck.

This will be the 4th year in a row I make these latkes for Hanukkah -- and I swear, people ask me about them all year long. They are so popular, my friends can't wait to come to my party and eat them! Have copies of the recipe on hand, because everyone will ask! They are the most delicious latkes I have ever tasted.

Rating: 2
I made this last night to freeze and then serve on Thanksgiving. I decreased all the recipe's ingredients by 25% (except still used 2 eggs). But I must have done something wrong--the batter, prior to adding the potatoes, was so runny I had to add an extra 1/8 cup of flour to make it somewhat stiff. Couldn't possibly add any milk. Was one supposed to squeeze moisture out of the potatoes?? In the final analysis they turned out good, but next time I would use less sugar, as they were a bit too sweet for us.

Yet another rave review. This was simple and delicious. I served it with chick-peas and swiss chard and a good plain yoghurt and it pleased everyone.

YUM!! This is total comfort food. I served them with home-made applesauce, and my husband and I gobbled up nearly the whole batch (so much for having leftovers for dinner tonight!). I'm going to ask my mother to include these in our Thanksgiving dinner this year -- I think they'll go great with turkey, and make a nice change of pace.
