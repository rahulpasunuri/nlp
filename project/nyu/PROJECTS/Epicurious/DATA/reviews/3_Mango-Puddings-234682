This wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. The consistency was a little strange. Easy and quick, but we ended up throwing it all out. Only my 1 year old would eat it.

I made this during mango season with the last of my VERY ripe mango supply. I didn't have condensed milk, so I used heavy cream instead (less healthy, but worth it). A tasty, simple dessert; I'll keep the recipe on file for next July.

Popular with mango fans. Pretty easy. It wasn't very sweet for a dessert, which is refreshing. However, my mangos may not have been fully ripe.

I made this as a dessert for an Indian meal. I served it with whipped cream and toasted coconut on top. It was very light and flavorful. I will definately use it again for a light summer dessert.

A light, most refreshing dessert. A wonderful summer dessert to replace heavy cakes and pies a la mode. Very easy to make.

I make this recipe often -- my family likes it with lemon-infused whipped cream. But it is also lovely to eat as-is, as a nearly guilt-free dessert.
