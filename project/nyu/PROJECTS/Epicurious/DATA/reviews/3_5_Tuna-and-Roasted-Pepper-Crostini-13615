I made this for my boyfriend's family for a Christmas party. It came out delicious; the trick is to use wasabi mayonnaise instead of traditional. It really adds an extra kick to an otherwise fishy dish.

Not sure why such a high rating....I used fresth tuna and grilled and then added olive oil to kick it up a notch....fair at best.

I've been making this over and over since it was first published years ago because it's just that good and easy - and different. It's great for parties because you can make all of the components ahead of time.

This recipe was very easy to follow and make. i am currently a culinary management student and the exam i had to do for my midterm in my appetizer class was what the teachers like to call a 'mystery box' they give us the ingredients and a guidline to what we have to make. and i chose this recipe to use as one of the things i was making (our key ingredient was tuna) and i thought this recipe would suit it very well. and though i did not have access to bread at the time to make the actual crostini i thinly sliced a potato and it still turned out wonderfully.

I made this recipe as part of my Italian Christmas Eve dinner years ago when the recipe first appeared in Gourmet and it was amazing - everyone loved it. My husband actually asked me today if I could make it again this year (I forgot about it in years past) and was so happy to find the recipe here. It's just great tasting, pretty and so simple.

This is fantastic! We strongly dislike anchovies, so we skipped them and opted for more capers. The sweetness of the peppers is the perfect complement for the tang of the capers and the saltiness of the tuna. These are elegant, easy, and scrumptious - earning them a 4-fork rating in our house. They reminded me of our honeymoon in Spain and the tapas there, and they'd be great for a tapas party or for Christmas (the green capers and red peppers are beautiful). If you're in a hurry, you can stir the ingredients together for a chunkier topping, whereas the food processor yields a more pate-like consistency. Either way, you win!

This was awesome and sooooo easy to make. I used tuna in water, drained and anchovy paste instead of canned anchovies, and it was great. Even my two boys liked it, who are super-picky. It was a nice, easy appetizer, but the anchovy and capers really give it a bit of sophistication.

I loved these! They were easy, beautiful and absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and I can tell you, I wouldn't change a thing here! I will make these often.

Use the lemon and capers to balance the fish flavors nicely. I would cut thin (1/4") slices and use a denser Italian bread, rather than French, if available. I served this with Sicilian marinated shrimp as a room temperature starter and it was weel received. Very easy to whip up as a post-work appetizer for the adults. My wife loves it. Use bottled roasted peppers to save effort.

This is one of the very few recipes I have found on this site that I would give a poor review. It was just awful. Too fishy (and I went easy on the anchovies) and the texture was revolting. And it sounded so good...
