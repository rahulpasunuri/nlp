2 forks- good but wouldn't make again. I picked this recipe because I do like brussels sprouts but had never actually tried chestnuts. I got inspired about chestnuts after an NPR foodie review and seeing chestnuts on sale over the holidays. I found this recipe a bit gloppy, and the cream covered the flavors of the sprouts and chestnuts. I found it cooked much more quickly and much less water was needed than recipe indicated which left me with mushy overcooked sprouts. If I made again I could anticipate this but I think the chestnuts were WAY to expensive to use in a recipe where they get lost. On the positive side the dish was meaty and filling.

This dish is amazing! Made it for Thanksgiving and they were all gone at the end and I made tons! The cream and butter really is hard to beat. Not a light dish but so worth it.

Wow. This dish is fantastic. My old roommate made it for us one night and I finally tracked down the recipe from her. We added crumbled bacon at top and used water chestnuts. It was soooo good - and I didn't think I liked brussels sprouts before I tried it. :)

Made this with frozen petite brussels sprouts and regular cream. Delicious.

The flavor and texture of the chestnuts worked really well with the brussels sprouts. The cream added a nice touch of lushness without making it overly rich or heavy. I did have some problems with the amounts of liquid listed i.e. the recipe called for too much water and cream. I had to pour off some water and when I was done there was a lot of cream just sitting at the bottom but maybe it had something to do with my pan size (?).

Update: I started craving this less than two weeks after I first tried it (see earlier review). This time I used half and half and it was still excellent.

I had no idea I liked Brussels sprouts! This dish was amazing! I think the bacon someone else suggested (or pancetta) would go very well with this, but it doesn't need it. I might try half and half next time.

Big hit! Even those that said they didn't like Brussels sprouts liked it. I think steaming than lightly browning the Brussels sprouts takes the "bitter" out of them. This recipe will be a new addition to our holiday menu.

It's no wonder this has received 4 forks and unequivocal raves. Where has this recipe been all my life? The only reason we even considered adding another dish to our traditional Thanksgiving menu was that my father, a great urban forager, had procured pounds and pounds of lovely chestnuts, which he was also kind enough to roast and peel ahead of time. I can't get over how such a simple recipe could produce such amazing results, though. This dish has been promoted to the permanent roster of holiday dishes.

Cooking time may be a bit off if you are roasting your own chestnuts. I am adding pancetta bacon to this recipe for added dimension. Let you know how it works!

I've never used chestnuts although I'll probably try the dish with chestnuts sometime soon. We made this for Thanksgiving one year and everyone LOVED it. I've made it frequently ever since. Highly recommended.

I have been making this dish as the annual Thanksgiving favorite since the recipe was published. People are disappointed when I don't bring it! I am able to make it ahead and reheat when I reach my destination without losing too much crispness in the sprouts. I've always made this a lower fat and calorie dish by reducing the amount of butter and using fat-free evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream. Wonderful!

This is really a delicious dish. The sweetness of the chestnuts really complements the brussels sprouts. If you aren't a fan of chestnuts, I've been told that substituting pecans results in a tasty dish as well. This has become my go- to Thanksgiving veg dish.

One of my guests for Thanksgiving (Candian) had a nut allergy so I made this recipe to the letter but substitued wild mushrooms for the chestnuts. It worked wonderfully! I'd definitely make it again and recommend mushrooms for a new twist.

i couldn't find bottled chestnuts; so bought them at the store and roasted them myself using a recipe from this site. Everyone really enjoyed the dish!

Found this recipe, had some lovely sprouts but no chestnuts. What to do? Found some seedless red grapes in the fridge so tried them instead. Very tasty indeed.

Simple, quick, and delicious! Leaving out the chestnuts would leave out half the goodness--don't do it. Definitely a recipe worth repeating!

Well, I'm the one who asked about how this would transport, and it did so beautifully. And probably the best brussels sprouts recipe ever! Plan to make it again using non-fat half-and-half and serve it over whole wheat pasta. Can't wait for that meal!!!

Now this is good. I was so hungry making it last night I wanted to eat the whole thing but then I love Brussels sprouts. Very rich so beware. I'm not totally convinced that the chestnuts are necessary as they add another degree of richness but we will see what my Thanksgiving guests think. BTW, the person who wanted to make it four hours in advance - I'm sure that will fine as I made mine Mon f/Thurs. I'll just heat up in the microwave - maybe add a bit more cream when I do. Now if only the sweet potatoes with lime syrup tastes as good..............

I'd like to make this about 4 hours in advance, then transport it to a Thanksgiving dinner where it will be reheated briefly. How do you readers think that will work? Unfortunately I have no time for a trial run. Thanks.

The opnly thing I added was a little Nutmeg and a few snips of parsley. Excellent!

Delicious! Next time I'll try adding a small shallot and maybe a few drops of lemon juice or wine, but even without any of these, it was a very satisfying cold winter's night dish.
