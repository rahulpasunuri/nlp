I liked this but I did add a little fresh lemon juice to it.

This was really easy and the flavours were fantastic. You could taste each ingredient individually - the ginger, soy sauce, red-wine vinegar - and yet the whole dressing melded together very nicely. I skipped the salt because I found the dressing to be salty enough. I used too much honey mustard, which was a bit overpowering and made the dressing a bit too sweet. I usually avoid vegetable oil and make everything with olive oil, but I am glad I used vegetable oil this time. Olive oil would have ruined the flavours. In all it took about 5 minutes to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. I even used the extra dressing to put over my chicken. I think it would be a great dipping sauce for chicken fingers if you wanted something a little more sophisticated.

This dressing is always a big hit! I mix it with cut up cabbage and it makes a terrific and easy cole slaw. Instead of using store bought honey mustard, I use about 1TBS dijon and 1TBS agave nectar (similar to honey but sweeter). Then I tweak it by adding either more mustard or agave depending on whether it needs to be sweeter or spicier.

Great recipe. Easy and delicious.

This was very easy to make. I added 1/2 tablespoon honey to make it a bit sweeter, because I ate it with chicken fingers.

Easy and excellent. I cut the vegetable oil in half to make it healthier.

Delightful. I just picked a bowlful of spinach from the garden. This made a lovely salad with hard-boiled eggs and tomatoes. I didn't have honey mustard, so I just used 2T. of Dijon and 1/2 T. of honey.

This is one of my favorite salad dressings and I get rave reviews everytime I make it. One thing I use that really thickens the dressing is an Aerolatte instead of hand whisking, you will get great results if you use a frother like the Aerolatte when pouring the vegitable oil into the dressing. One other note: DON'T USE OLIVE OIL - it ruins the taste

This was ok. I think it needs modifications. I added honey to it. I like the giner and chives; they give this dress good flavor.

This is great!! I don't often make homemade dressing, but this is definitely worth the effort.

A great dressing. To make it low fat, I used only 1 tablespoon of oil and added 1 tablespoon of white wine. You don't really need the wine - it just turned out slightly thicker than I wanted, so I diluted it a little with wine rather than oil. This dressing has a really round, well-balanced taste.
