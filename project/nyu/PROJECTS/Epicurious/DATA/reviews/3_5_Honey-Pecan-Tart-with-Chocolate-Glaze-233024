This one definitely was not very popular at Thanksgiving dinner. I'd stick with a more traditional pecan pie next time. The shell tasted more of a pie crust than a tart crust - more flaky and buttery like an apple pie crust, not sweet and a bit crumbly like I would expect a tart shell to be. The pecans were very meaty, perhaps from boiling them in the filling mixture?? I'll admit it was a bit better on the 2nd day but still not my favorite.

I really loved this tart, the ease of preparation and gorgeous tabletop presence makes it a do-again.

This is a beautiful tart that tastes great. It is very rich, so serve small slices. I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than refrigerating the tart for about 10 minutes after putting on the glaze so it would be firm by serving time shortly thereafter. I broke up the work by making the pastry dough one night, making the filling and cooking it the next night, then finally glazing it and serving the 3rd night, so it didnt feel like a lot of work as others said.

This tart is decadent and delicious. I've made it the past two Thanksgiving holidays, and we shamelessly nibble at it until it disappears! I basically stick to the recipe as written.

I made the filling ahead, which the recipe says should be okay. It wasn't though. It made the pecans taste like walnuts. I reduced the cooking time a bit because my tart pan is black. In retrospect, I should have cooked the tart just a little longer than I did. So give it a try, but make sure you cook it long enough and DON'T make the filling ahead of time.

Rich and delicious! Very labor intensive, but worth it. The crust was more like a crunchy butter cookie than a pie crust. Since I'm allergic to honey I substituted it for a combination of corn and maple syrup, and I used 1% milk (instead of whole) since it was all I had on hand. I boiled the mixture for about 25-30 minutes and it was still a perfect praline caramel. It got rave reviews from all my guests.
