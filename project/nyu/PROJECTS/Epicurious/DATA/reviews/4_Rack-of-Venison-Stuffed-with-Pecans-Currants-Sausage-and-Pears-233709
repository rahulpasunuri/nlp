This is very good way to prepare venison loin, especially for those who resist eating venison. My wife commented that this was the best venison she has ever eaten and I have prepared quite a bit of venison over the years.

I have made this for dinner Christmas Eve for the last couple of years, and am probably going to do it again this year. I don't have easy access to Venison, so I have just used beef which is perfectly fine. The stuffing is really delicious, and compliments the meat beautifully. The onions and garlic are excellent as well. Altogether a fantastic meal that I catch myself thinking about whenever I'm REALLY hungry!!!!

This is fabulous. I have made it four times so far with rave reviews from everyone, even those who think they don't like venison. It works perfectly with the backstraps, just roast for 10 minutes, no more. I amp it up a bit with a port/white wine/balsamic reduction. Don't skip the onions. If you went to the best restaurant and ordered this you would not be disappointed.

A Cook from Montreal, you can easily get venison in Montreal. You can also get moose, bison, boar which would probably be good with this recipe. michaelnova, could you possibly make your review any more offensive? Somehow I get the feeling that you are not too happy with the results of last night's election.

My father is a hunter, and I just prepared this dish for him and my family. Even the folks who don't normally like venison enjoyed this recipe. Our rack was from a very young deer, so we put two racks together to make 2 1/4 pounds. I cooked it to 130 degrees and it was still very tender. I have made several venison recipes from epicurious and this is our favorite so far. We served it with buttermilk mashed potatoes with carmelized shallots (from epicurious) and carrots roasted simply with EVOO, salt, and freshly ground pepper.

Try this with farm raised venison. It's mild in flavour because it comes from young animals raised on grass. Speciality butchers and many wholefoods stores sell farm raised venison, as well as several online retailers.

i know a lot of folks don't have venison (deer meat). it's strong meat, not for the timid. nevertheless, this recipe works for those of us up in Wyoming. you can use elk, moose, and buffalo, if you want. this is a real cook, the one who put this up on epi. he/she knows what is going on. it may not work with lamb or other stronger meats. i haven't tried that. but if you have real USA country venison, or other country meats, this thing works. all you city folk, eat your heart out. real cooks will recognize this as somethng you will get at the finest and most prestigious restaurants in New York, and maybe if you ever get to Cheyenne or someplace where delicate palates actually go to try something different. spend $300 bucks trying something different in the trendy rests, or (if you are really, really good) try this recipe. beautiful! for the rest of you, don't try this at home. strictly for the elite. your kids won't like it. they will feed it to your cat. this is only for the real folks... the europeans who are bored stiff with the typical frenchy fair, or the best cooks looking for something different that will wow the sox off of their friends at the next posh party. or, maybe... if you have a gun tot'n hubby or wife that just shot their first deer somewhere around Caspar Wyoming. blast their buds with this. it really is a special recipe.

Do you think this could be made with rack of lamb? What meat might be a good alternate for those who cannot get Venison?
