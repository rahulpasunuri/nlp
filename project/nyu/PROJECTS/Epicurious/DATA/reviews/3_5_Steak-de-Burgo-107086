I've been preparing Steak De Burgo for years and this is an authentic recipe from J. Benjamines in Des Moines. Similar recipes call for a splash of sauterene wine, otherwise they are almost identical. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys a GOOD steak.

I didn't have any fresh herbs (never do) so I used dried and mixed them in with the butter to "plump" them up again. I also used a London Broil instead of individual steaks, and my family raved about it! Great recipe!

I loved the flavor of the garlic butter and fresh herbs from my garden. This is sauce is good on everything. True it's simple but so delicious.

Nice and simple, barely rates being called a recipe, but it was tasty.

I live in the heart of De Burgo country and although I have not been to this restaurant I found this dish to be unlike any De Burgo sauce I have ever tasted. I used the freshest herbs available and was so disappointed when my daughter, a freak for the stuff, scraped all of her sauce off the meat.
