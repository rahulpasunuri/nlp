This was delicious!! I used filets and cooked about 15 minutes or until flaky. I also added a little minced garlic and lemon juice to the fennel mixture. It will become a favorite recipe for fish!

This was delicious. Easy prep & clean-up too. The soft but slightly crunchy fennel contrasted nicely with the buttery soft fish and crispy breadcrumbs. Simple flavors marry to make a special meal.

My boyfriend has made this recipe for me a few times. It is absolutely delicious. I don't find it bland at all. This is an excellent recipe for people who like fennel.

This recipe takes a lot of time to prepare and the outcome is just so-so. With all the shallots and fennel and white wine, nothing seems to save this dish from tasting bland. I even added garlic, but that didn't help either. In general, I prefer to sautee this type of fish, but I don't know if that would have saved it. There are alot of delicious ways to make red snapper - unfortunately, this is not one of them.
