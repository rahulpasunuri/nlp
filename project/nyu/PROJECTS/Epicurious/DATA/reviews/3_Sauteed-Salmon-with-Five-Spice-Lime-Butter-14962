I love five spice, I love salmon, I love lime. With that, I should love this recipe. I thought it was OK. Husband liked it a bit more than me.

Loved this recipe!! I doubled the sauce which I think is important, because you really need a bit more than the recipe calls for. I also grilled the salmon outside which I believe really added to the flavor, plus, since it seems cooking salmon inside always gives the house such a strong odor, I was able to avoid that! Highly recommended!

Made this with swordfish steaks I had on hand and it was delightful! Felt it was a two "fork" dish, however I gave it an extra "fork" for the ease and speed with which you are able to prepare this fish. If you like salmon, I highly recommend the Sugar-Seared Salmon With Cream Sauce on this site... Enjoy! KIMBER

This was very tasty. I had salmon steaks, and it worked fine with them. I took others advice, and doubled the recipe for the sauce, plus as I was making it for 3. My 15 year old really liked it too, so that makes it a keeper!

The general comments left by other reviewers are very accurate, the recipe is easy and fine to eat but not anything special. I would rather try another salmon recipe before making it again.

I have made this dozens of times, not only because of the simplicity, but because it is delicious. I find I need to double the sauce. Excellent for someone who cooks for one.

Easy as falling off a log, and very nice. The lime helps take away from the richness of the fish, and the 5 spice powder gives it an interesting "something" that makes it special.

This was very tasty... Delicious and simple, had it served with just some steamed snow peas. Good worknight dinner.

This was really simple and went incredibly well with the five-spice calamari recipe. We grilled the salmon and I melted the butter mixture in the microwave. Piece of cake.

I'm trying to fit more fish into my culinary bag of tricks. This is a fast and easy way to prepare salmon, and it is perfectly done when you follow these easy directions. Very tasty, too!

This dish was great! It was very easy to make and my fiancee loved it too. You can adjust the cooking time based on how well done you like your Salmon. The lime added just the right amount of sharpness to the creamy taste of butter. I will definitely add this to the book!
