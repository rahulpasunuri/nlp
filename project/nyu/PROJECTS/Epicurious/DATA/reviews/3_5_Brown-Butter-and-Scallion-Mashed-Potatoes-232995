You had me at browned butter. These will be a tradition after making these for the first time today. I added minced sweet onion instead of scallions, and they practically melt into the potatoes. Finishing with the sour cream makes them silky. The tastiest spuds I've had. Happy Thanksgiving!

This recipe is really easy, delicious, and a definite crowd pleaser. I use low-fat or soy milk (yes, it still tastes good) and definitely love the idea of adding bacon to this, mmmm! This recipe also makes really great morning-after-Thanksgiving potato pancakes.

Best ever potatoes!!!! The browned butter and green onions give it such a rich flavor. My favorite mashed potatoes.

Seems really important to rinse the potatoes well. I made it once without rinsing, and the potatoes came out kind of gluey. Ive never heated the milk & salt separately, & it doesn't seem to matter. Guess you only need to do that step to keep it warm for serving.

Great base mashed potato recipe. I added some sprinkled Parmesan cheese on the top once in the serving dish = delicious. I saw a few reviews down that someone used bacon and deep fried shallots and that sounds fantastic as well!

Made as is- BEST mashed potatoes I've ever eaten- and I'm Irish....

When I was about ten years old, my aunt, who hosted Thanksgiving every year, gave each kid a job. Mine and my older cousin's was mashed potatoes. While over the years, all the other kids stopped doing their jobs, we did the potatoes every year, until we got older and stopped having a huge family Thanksgiving. But I've done the potatoes for my family for every holiday since that fateful job assignment. I always made them a different way each year. Then, the year this recipe came out, I decided to try it-- and since then, I've become a loyalist. Sometimes I add bacon (this year I'm making deep fried shallots), but I always use this recipe as my base. It is perfection!

My heavens! What a great change from your usual potato fare. I made a few changes for the sake of my figure. I used evaporated milk (skim) instead of the whole milk and low fat yoghurt instead of sour cream. I didn't have green onion so I minced up some vadalia instead. I will definately make this again. Perhaps next time I will add garlic cloves to my potatoes in the inital boil.

The potatoes were a big hit. Everyone enjoyed them. The brown butter and scallions were a nice change from the traditional mashed potatoes. I had a little bit leftover so I made potato pancakes the next morning which were delicious as well.

Good recipe but the scallions in it were not that great. The next night I made the same potatoes but this time added shallots instead-delicious! I served these potatoes with the Standing rib roast recipe in December issue-it was a hit!

There are so many better and easier recipes out there....this one took 3 pots to prepare (I don't ever have help w/ the dishes!) and was just ok, nothing special.

I'll admit I may have let the butter get a little too brown. But it just didn't add anything special. In fact, it looked like I had gotten carried away with the pepper (sort a "dirty potatoes" look). For me, the browned butter is not worth the extra effort.

Pretty good, but not amazing.

This was excellent. I made it the day before and reheated with a little extra butter and milk.

I used fat free evaporated milk and low fat sour cream and it was still great.

Wow!! What incredible flavor! The browned butter really adds a depth of flavor. This is my new favorite dish.
