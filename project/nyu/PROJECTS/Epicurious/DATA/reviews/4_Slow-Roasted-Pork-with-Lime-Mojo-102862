I used the marinade with a reduced amount of oil (1/4 cup) on pork shoulder and cooked it in a slow cooker. I also added an onion and a couple of jalapenos while cooking it. It turned out tender and delicious.

a bit more work, but by butterflying the meat one or more times before marinating, including the spice rub, and then roll and tie after the marination, the flavor permeates throughout. I also threw it on the rotisserie outside, brushing periodically with the mojo. Superb flavors.

no fork rating because the other views were so good that I didn't want to scew it with a bad rating; perhaps I did something wrong. I thought the lime mojo was a ton of work, liked that I could do it the day before and pop the pork/marinade in the fridge, but for how much potential and flavors that were involved I couldn't really taste it in the pork; perhaps because I used a tenderloin which has less surface area to hold it. I would prefer someething with less oil just for the matter of sticking to the meat. Will not make it again, but it was OK. I agree with the person who disliked someone rating a recipe when the tweeked it so much that it wasn't even similar. Go ahead and tweek and let us know, but don't give a rating to a recipe you essentially never tried.

Very easy, incredibly delicious! Lots of flavors that mingle and don't stop intriguing your taste buds. Not too spicy, but that could be because I only had one jalapeno. Still wonderful. I used pork tenderloin which cut the cooking time in half. Served with the Whipped Sweet Potatoes with Cardamom from this site and a buttermilk corn cake that is pretty good. The mojo sauce is awesome! This will be cooked over and over.

This is really good. Due to my laziness added unknown amounts of Latin Spice Mix to the marinade instead of taking the time to rub it in. Marinated all night then put it all in a roasting pan b/c of supposed jalapeno salmonella, added one onion, then slow braised really until it shredded into the hot mojo. Served with fresh tortillas and chips from mexican mercado. It would be the same flavors whether shredded or sliced. I would serve it as per the recipe for an elegant dinner party but this way is great for quick leftovers and snacks. Will top eggs with it tomorrow.Yumm!

If you know how to cook at all, this is a lovely recipe...EASY..and no-fail if you read it, understand it and prepare it as to the instructions. Great for entertaining as it can be prepared in advance. Please do not screw around with anything the first time you prepare a dish and then review it. There is a reason the recipe calls for an ingredient or a technique! Just because you dont understand or may not agree is not enough of a reason to change it and then attempt to provide an accurate review. You can do what ever you want the second time...just not interested in hearing how you messed up the original.

I followed the advice of many of the reviewers: Didn't heat the oil, doubled the mojo and reserved some (though I decided not to serve it with the dish tonight), used a 4# pork butt roast; upped the amount and variety of chiles for some heat (I used heaping tsp chile de arbol, 1/4 tsp of both cayenne and chipotle [pwdr]); added ground cumin and ground coriander (that's what I had on hand - no spice grinder at the moment),cinnamon [a traditional flavor according to other recipes - I don't recommend - it dominated the skin and the cooking aromas); I even used a 2:1 ratio of lime to orange juices and included some peels for extra acidity. I seared the roast on the stove before putting it in the oven (30 mins at 300F; a temperature check revealed a 50F at center, so I upped the oven to 450F as recipe was written (I underestimated the power of searing ;) ) for 30 mins), then back down to 300F for the duration. Cooking time was a solid 2 hours. I rested the meat the recommended hour. After all that, the flavor didn't seem to have penetrated the pork. I'm not complaining, really. I have found such wisdom in this community, I hope I can spare someone else who might be of like mind. To be fair, I didn't follow the recipe to the letter and used a larger cut of meat. The flavor was fine - it didn't have the "Wow!" factor for me and my generous-with-praise-always-willing to-try-anything-I-cook bf. I personally was disappointed with the result for the time I spent. I served with Cuban Beans from this site, made guacamole with roasted garlic (drizzled whole head with oil and cooked in oven while pork roasted - yum), salt and lime, and a quick fresh salsa. Corn tortillas and creme fraiche finished off the condiments. I also made Rick Bayless's lime ice recipe for dessert - wonderful way to cap the meal. Thanks to all reviewers who walked before me...

This was a huge hit with my family. My husband does not like squash and he loved this recipe with the pork.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner. My family LOVED IT. I have made notes on the components of this recipe (Spice Mix/Mojo). Re: the roast itself - we had to cook it MUCH LONGER than this recipe stated. I believe this was because my father purchased a pork loin roast (from Costco) that was much larger and thicker than a single pork loin. (The pork loins were bound with string into a roast.) We were also in Bend, OR which is much higher elevation than the recipe was probably written for. We followed directions, then turned the oven up to 375 and checked every 15 minutes with a meat thermometer until done (30 - 45 minutes longer). There is also a possibility that the oven we were using (at my folk's house - they are old and don't cook anymore) might have been colder than reading. Regardless, this was a huge hit and we enjoyed it for days afterwards (with plenty of mojo!)

I prepared this recipe for a cooperative luncheon at my office and it was a huge hit. Because it was THE entree for a group with varying palates, I toned down the heat and substitued fresh Anaheim chilies for the Jalapenos ... it was fine ... a subtle kick without a lot of heat. Next time I will use tenderloin instead of loin ... but the loin was tasty just the same. The Corn and Cheese Arepas "alone" are not terribly interesting but they serve as a nice base when one is constructing that "perfect bite" on the plate. I prepared a fresh guacamole and a lovely mango salsa to serve along with them ....the reviews were very positive about the combination. I gave the Spiced Butternut Squash recipe to a coworker (who follows recipes to the last jot and tittle) to prepare. The resulting dish was very tasty though I think a little heavy on the spice and oil. She had quite a bit leftover ... I think it might make a nice base for a squash soup. Overall, thumbs up on this set of recipes even though it is very time consuming. I would like to second the suggestion from another reviewer ... cut the amount of oil in half!

made the whole menu, the arepas were great, the butternut squash was excellent, and the pork was ok. The lime mojo - if I had to make this again I would just use lime juice and salt. I got the oil to exactly 175F and removed from heat; put in all the stuff and it began to deep fry! the lime pulp turned bright blue! in the end I strained it and used it, but it was still too oily. Everything calls for too much oil or butter. now i'm all greasy, and a little queezy.

This is an awesome recipe!!! You can cook it for a dinner party or you can cook it for yourself and use the leftovers for sandwiches. It takes some prep time, but well worth it. I didn't use a meat thermometer but it was still very tender. Love it!!!

Very flavorful, but mine came out a little too salty. I did add one more ingredient to the pork rub-oregano. I also heated the marinade (as did one other reviewer) because I didn't have enough sauce thinking it was going to be the same but I didn't like it much. Next time I'll make sure to have leftover mojo sauce.

This is so yummy!! Worth the effort of using whole spices. If you run out of clever things to do with leftovers, try pureeing the mojo sauce and using it as a dressing for a mixed green salad with thin slices of the pork.

Love this and so do my guests! Wonderfully tender and flavorful. I only used a cup of the mojo to marinade the meat in so I'd have plenty to use at the table. I added a tablespoon or two of sour cream and blended it. I look forward to making this again. I served it with a salad that included oranges and chunks of cornbread with butter and honey. Also loved the squash.

This got rave reviews at our holiday open house as a cold plate substituting a cilantro sauce for the marinade. The sauce was colorful drissled across the loin on a platter, and a wonderful complimentary taste to the rub. Combined pureed cilantro, fresh lime juice & chinese hot oil to taste, plus plain yogurt and a little sour cream (to thicken).

I love the chicken mojo served at a local cuban restaurant, and had high hopes for this jazzed up version. Can't say I was impressed. I followed the recipe exactly, and found the pork entirely uninspiring. My nephews really liked the sauce, so I suppose I might make that again - maybe to serve on roasted chicken.

This is a fabulous entree! It is a lot of work up but the beauty is it can all be done the night before. I served this with a sweet corn pudding (a perfect accompainment) and the recommended butternut squash (OK-but more work than payoff). I will definately make this many times again!

I served this to a party for 60 last week. When I pre-tested the recipe, I found the cumin in the Latin Spice Mixture overwhelming, so left out the spice rub completely and just marinated the pork in the Lime Mojo. It was fabulous: tangy, juicy, tender, luscious. I put the loins on the barbecue after roasting to caramelize, and think it added a nice touch. Served it with the Cuban Black Beans and saffron rice, along with the Green Salad with Orange Vinaigrette. Raves all around.

This is in response to Sophia, in California, who doesn't eat pork but was looking for a substitute to use for this recipe. I have often found that almost without exception that I can interchange pork with chicken in recipes that have a sweet/sour type of seasoning or cooking process, so that would be my recommendation. However, one wonders: If you don't eat pork, why waste your time browsing through pork recipes? I can assure you there are thousands of alternative meat recipes on this website.

This is a great, unique dish. I cut up 6 russet potatoes lengthwise into about 4 pieces, drizzled them with some of the leftover marinade, threw them in the bottom of the pan and stirred a few times. Then turn up the heat after you take the roast out and they get crispy and yummy. My roast took about an extra 1/2 to cook.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious, but a lot of work, and a LOT of smoke. My oven poured smoke for probably 30-40 minutes. Embarassing when you have to greet your guests with the smoke billowing about you at the front door! Once we got past the smoke and actually ate the meal, it was incredible. If you've got the time (and a really good exhaust fan on your oven), then go for it, it's well worth it.

Found it rather time-consuming to prepare. End result was rather boring. I used two small pork tenderloin which came out very moist; the seasoning was ok. The sauce was so-so.

I put this dish together in less than 30 minutes two nights ago and we had it last night and it was indeed fantastic. Certainly the sort of thing to pass on to a friend who is nervous about preparing something special for in-laws/company. A few things to note, I did not have a thermometer for the oil so heated it just before bubbles appeared and when I added the garlic/jalapeno/etc. they deep fried - sizzled like mad. No ill effect there, just thought it was a good thing to mention as it made me nervous when it happened. Also, when toasting the cumin it turned a darker shade and gave off smoke though was not burnt - another good thing to be prepared for so you don't think you've really messed up. Good to tie the roast before it goes in, mine was somewhat oval and the round slices are nicer. Great with a black bean/corn/tomato salad and white rice. I somehow did not have the extra 1/2 cup of mojo so I simmered the marinating liquid and then blended it as previously suggested, worked great.

I made this for a friend's birthday. It was absolutely delicious. We found the spicing quite intricate and different. Well worth making. Great for company as all the work is done the day before. Also, the squash dish was great with it too. I roasted some zucchini drizzled with garlic oil and it made a very nice company meal. I'm even thinking of it for christmas eve.

My guests left full and happy last night! I made this recipe for the first time. It was simple to put together, and prepare, leaving me time to visit with my guests. I used a 6.5 lb. boneless shoulder roast. It was great! My six guests almost polished off the entire roast. The lime mojo is a perfect last touch. I was a little nervous about so much garlic and jalapenos, but it was perfectly balanced and delicious. I have a new recipe to serve with confidence...Try This One!

I tried this recipe with a pork shoulder rather than a pork loin, and it worked wonderfully. I cooked it slightly longer than was suggested. The pork roast was tender and delicious, and I got raves from my husband and dinner guest. I used fewer jalapenos than was suggested, using half jalapenos and half banana peppers. I loved the combination of tastes of the mojo--tangy and spicy. I plan to use the Latin rub on other cuts of meat. This is one dish I will definitely make again. It was easy to prepare with maximum results.
