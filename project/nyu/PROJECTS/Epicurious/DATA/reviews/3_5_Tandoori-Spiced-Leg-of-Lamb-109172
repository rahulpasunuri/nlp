This was good. I took the other reviewers' suggestion to save the marinade and boil with the pan drippings to make a sauce, and it was very good. It's very tangy and flavorful. Mine was a little too done, but was still tender and moist. I will make this again.

I used a boneless leg of lamb and marinated it in a gallon plastic bag. It worked beautifully. The lamb was tender, moist and delicious. I wish I had read the review that suggested saving the marinade. It would have been lovely with the quinoa pilaf I served. I will definitely make this again.

This lamb was absolutely delicious. It cooked perfectly and was so tender and moist. I marinated it from Thursday evening until Saturday evening around 7pm when I put it in the oven. I also followed the advice - not to throw out the marinade and cooked it down and served it with the lamb. It was really wonderful and I will make this again - definitely!!!!

I found the marinade (and the resulting lamb) to be too tangy - I think the yogurt plus 1/4 lime juice is just too much acidity. If I make this again, I'd reduce the lime juice and use the other reviewers suggestion of using the spices as a rub first, then marinating in yogurt.

This was tender, succulent and flavorful. I made this with the cumin potatoes also on this website and it was delicious! I purchased nan from a local Indian restaurant and had a fabulous meal. I did not discard the remaining marinade; while the lamb was resting, I added the au jus to the yogurt marinade and boiled it. I then served the yogurt sauce along the lamb. It was yummy!

I LOVE Indian food so I had to try this one. I though it was wonderful. I followed the ingredients as written including the fenugreek but also marinated in a ziplock bag. I mean really why do it any other way? It's so easy to turn and clean up after. Try serving the lamb with a mint, garlic and lime yogurt sauce, to live for!

This was easy to make, tasty and well worth a repeat, but if you have the time, there are better recipes for Tandoori lamb. Applying a dry rub of indian spices to the lamb prior to marinating it in yogurt would greatly enhance the flavor of the end product. Also, grilling over indirect heat rather than roasting would give you a more authentic dish.

I used lemon juice instead of lime juice and substituted lemon peel for the lime peel. Use less lemon juice if you're worried about the acidity of the marinade. I also used low-fat yogurt and the mixture was thick and held nicely to the lamb. To marinade, put the leg of lamb in a plastic bag and pour the yogurt marindae in. Tie the plastic bag tightly and rub the marinade all over the meat. Refrigerate overnight, turning occasionaly. This way you don't have to worry about the aluminium foil interacting with the lemon juice (acid) in the marinade. I baked mine covered for the first hour and then removed the cover for the remaining 30 minutes. Delicious!

This was easy and delicious! The marinade would be excellent on chicken or meaty fish as well. Paired with spiced Basmati rice. This was a complete hit and will definately repeat!
