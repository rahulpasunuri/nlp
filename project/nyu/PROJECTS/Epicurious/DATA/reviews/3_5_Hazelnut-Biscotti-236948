I saw some hazelnuts on sale & bought enough without even having a particular recipe in mind. I found this recipe & I like that it had no butter. I did not go through the trouble of making my flour into "self rising" cake flour.. where do you even find cake flour let alone self-rising..??. So I made the biscotti & they are good - I will keep the recipe and make again but will "amend" the flour as others did.

I have made this many times, and it is wonderful! I use egg substitute (Reddi-Egg), and have experimented with amounts. 2 eggs did make a dry dough, but with the sub, it is easy to add a little more. (I like the Frangelico idea, and will try it next time!) I tried them once with regular all-purpose flour, but the texture was not as fine. I add 1 Tbsp. baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt to the flour to make it "self-rising." It is a sticky and stiff dough, but damp hands do help a lot. (And it's worth it!)

This is a simple and very tasty recipe. The hazelnut flavor comes through very nicely and the biscotti are sweet but not overpoweringly so. I love them as they are, without chocolate, for a full hazelnut flavor, which I got from shelling the nuts myself, For almost any recipe requiring nuts, I always find the flavor is deeper if I make the effort to shell the nuts rather than buying them shelled, which is always worth the little extra time. The only issue was having to use 3 large eggs instead of the recipe's 2-egg requirement as others have mentioned. I suppose it just depends on the consistency of the flour you use and how big your "large" eggs happen to be. Two eggs was definitely not enough and the flour was still very dry and would not hold together. A third egg solved the problem and all was well. The biscotti turned out perfectly golden, crisp, and full of rich hazelnut flavor.

i did everything in the food processor. once the hazelnuts and sugar were finely ground i added regular cake flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt and 2 jumbo (not large) eggs. i used the bigger eggs because of what i read here in the reviews. dough was sticky, but wet hands were good enough to form the logs. i got more than 32 cookies, but i was cutting mine pretty thin- more like 3/8". i liked them. tasty!

Excellent taste and easy to execute. I used three eggs instead of two. I buy eggs at my local farmer's market and they may have been smaller than supermarket-sized "large" eggs, but two was just not enough. That said, our guests really loved them and I am happy to make them again.

I'm not sure how I feel about this one. I made two batches. The first batch was very hard to work with. The dough was very dry and I found it hard to form the logs. When I cut it into strips it fell apart very easily. The second batch I made, I added three eggs instead of two (like someone had suggested previously) and it worked so much better! Tasted better too. Next time, I think I will add some chocolate :)

I made biscotti for the first time using this recipe. It was so quick and easy. The dough seemed a little dry but they turned out great anyway.

Not sure why this worked so well for some. My dough was dry and crumbly. 1/4 cup of hazelnut oil and 1 tablespoon of Frangelico (for a flavor burst) conditioned it pretty well. The recipe lacks enough liquid. Once you get it going, it is pretty good. We dipped ours in semisweet chocolate (melted) and coated with medium chopped roasted hazelnuts. Gives it that classy touch.

While cleaning out my magazines for a paint job I found this recipe from last year and decided to try it today. I had to google on how to make self rising cake flour and found out it was easy. The house smells wonderful from the toasted hazelnuts. For any biscotti recipes second baking I lay them down on a cooling rack so that both sides bake at once. This has never failed me.

Love this recipe! So simple and tasty. Could not find self rising cake flour, so added 2 tspns baking powder and pinch of salt to cake flour. (I once made the mistake of trying regular self rising flour in another recipe, and what a salty disaster that turned out to be!) As for the biscotti next time I might try adding some chocolate chips and see how that turns out.

Haven't make these yet but I want to try something different. Has anyone used Hazelnut spread found in the peanut butter isle? I think I can substitute that for the toasted hazelnuts. Any ideas on any additional changes I should make?? THANKS! -Soup

thankfully this recipe turned out very good. It got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. I was planing on making the dough and then freezing it for later, but it looked so terrible that i had to bake it then to see if it would taste as bad as it looked. Fortunately the dough was deceiving and it turned out very good with a lot of hazelnut flavor. I added another egg because I found it way too dry with only two. I didn't have any self rising flour so i added 3 teaspoons of baking powder, and a little salt. It was great!

These tase great but are a bit difficult to slice (but, all biscotti is really) I used hazelnuts that I bought pre-roasted as they were what I had on hand. When the biscotti were done I melted osme bittersweet chocolate and drizzled it over half of them, dipped the other half. I agree with another review that this didn't make 32 and all of mine were a bit small. I think I'll have to call them "mini-biscotti" or something :)

Iam excited to make this recipe ! i will update my review after I make my biscotti!If you will excuse me... I am going to make Hazelnut Biscotti!

My first time making biscotti, and I love hazelnuts, so I had to make it and it turned out great. Agree that the hazelnut process is a bit long, but it is so worth it for the flavor.

It's possible that my hazelnuts were old (but since they were toasted anyway, I don't think that should have mattered), but this turned out ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!! It was dry & crumbly. There just wasn't enough moisture to hold it together. It had the consisency of, oh, corn meal. Now, it was very tasty, but I had to throw it out...there was no way that I could serve this! :(

Easy...I enjoy making biscotti and do so often...but I never lay biscotti down for the second baking and the flip. It is easier to place them standing upright in the oven for the entire second baking time. No flip, no fuss.

I had some almond meal and used that instead of hazelnuts - very easy, but the batter was too dry & I added another egg to hold it together. I also added orange zest as suggested by another reviewer. Very tasty. Thanks to the reviewer who gave the proportions for self-rising flour.

i made this with almonds instead of hazlenuts because that's what i had and it worked perfectly well. so i just wanted to let the internet know: nut substitution= okay.

toasting the hazelnuts and removing the skin is time consuming, but if you're really into hazelnut biscotti, this is a good recipe. My only quibble is that it didn't make 32 pieces, even though I cut them in 1/2 inch slices and that the biscotti is extremely fragile when slicing with the serrated knife, and can break in half.

I modified my regular cake flour as noted in previous reviews to make it self-rising, biscotti came out great. First time trying to make biscotti and will do it again. Hazelnuts are worth the trouble.

This recipe is improved by the addition of the rind from 1 orange. I used regular flour, plus 1.5 tsps. of baking powder and the results were terrific. My hesitation in making this recipe again is that it is time-consuming to roast and remove the skin from hazelnuts. This recipe would be much easier if you purchase roasted, unsalted, hazelnuts available in some speciality food stores.

This was an easy to make recipe resulting in beautiful and delicious biscotti - this makes me really look like I know what I'm doing. I made my own self-rising cake flour since I only had regular on hand: 2 cups cake flour with 3 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt.

This recipe resulted in delicious biscotti. I made my own self-rising cake flour: 1 cup cake flour with 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt. I love the simplicity!

OH, and another thing -- You don't need parchment paper. Simply put down a piece of heavy duty foil on a cookie sheet, and spray it lightly with Pam.

This is an extremely easy recipe, and the biscotti are visually appealing, and one has to appreciate that they have no added fat. Problem is they are very salty!! I never used self-rising flour before, and I think I will toss the rest of the bag. I'm going to try this recipe again using regular all-purpose flour, and 2 tsp. of baking powder, and NO SALT.

very good. Be careful not to burn biscotti on second baking. Nice w/coffee in the morning
