Great cake. Easy to make and very delicious.

2-1/2 forks: I would consider this a torte (as it's not as tall as a conventional layer cake) for my husband's birthday and he really liked it. I'm not a coffee fan, so it was not my favorite. We used black walnuts which we feel are much more flavorful than English walnuts and the espresso/walnut flavor was good.

This cake was easy to make and everything went together well. It just didn't have much pizazz when it was done. We tried it at a dinner party. It seemed a bit blah. My husband who doesn't like sweets even suggested that maybe the cake should have been sweeter. Or maybe a bit of chocolate in the cake would have given it a bit more taste. It had a lovely aroma and the frosting was fine, just blah.
