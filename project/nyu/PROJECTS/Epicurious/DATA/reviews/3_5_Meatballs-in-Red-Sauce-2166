excellent meatballs! I put them in my own sauce.

really fantastic and flavorful meatballs...made the mistake of using a regular skillet to fry them in. The first batch stuck and fell apart. Changed to non-stick and that did the trick. However, I'm still wondering how in the world you can keep meatballs round while frying them--I always end up with "meat triangles" or "meat squares!"

I just made the meatballs and they came out quite tasty. I used half beef and half veal (as that was what I had in the freezer) and baked them in a 350 oven for 25 minutes. I have used them in a meatball soup and in pasta and both times they worked out very well. I recommend this for a fast and easy dinner

It is of course very convenient to use a ready-made tomato sauce, but I prefer to make my own which is really easy, especially if you use fresh basil.

Made this dish for company, and everyone raved about them. However, the leftovers did not re-heat well with the microwave; better on the stove top.

Wonderful meatballs. I also did not fry mine, but rather baked them, but all was good.

I was told by my entire family and a friend who owns a very popular local restaurant that these were the "best meatballs" they've ever tasted!

I made these meatballs for my boyfriend and his roommates and they loved them. These guys would rather cut out their tounges then give me a compliment and they actually asked me to make them again.

Great recipe! I've made these numerous times. They have better flavor if you cook them in the frying pan vs. baking them in oven. When I fry them I don't use oil, there is enough fat in the pork. They freeze well and make a great meal to take to someone.

Absolutely delicious meatballs - baked, not fried, at 350 for 30 minutes. Made a sauce of red, green, orange and yellow peppers with onions, portabello mushrooms, chopped tomatoes and red wine

Simply delicious. Fresh parsley and high-quality, full-flavored Parmesan are key. Have also tried making it with only leanest (<8% fat) ground beef and no pork - works okay, but as expected you lose some intensity and complexity of flavor to gain the health benefits.

I loved this recipe. I used Italian sausage instead of ground pork, and baked the meatballs in the oven until brown. Then added to the sauce. It kept the sauce from getting too greasy. I also used the Spicy Tomato Sauce on this website. Yum!!!!

I have used this meatball recipe several times and they have always been a huge success and very much loved by anyone who has eaten them. This is a recipe I will use over and over.

i have not made this yet, but, i never fry my meatballs---they are tender & wonderful if you simmer your sauce in a large skillet....drop your RAW meatballs gently into the sauce----never stir, just shake the skillet. Put a lid on & let simmer very gently. also, i never use egg ad this makes them too tough & packed...just simmer--oh, how wonderfully tender, do try it!!!

I hate to even review this recipe since I made some changes, but I'm going to anyway! First off I halved the recipe since I didn't want to make as much. And I only used lean ground beef, no other meat. I was very surprised at how good these were considering the ingredients in them. I used high quality freshly grated parmesan cheese and the flavor was wonderful. With halving the recipe and using only 1 1/2 lbs. of beef I got about 12 good sized meatballs. I served these in the Spicy Tomato Sauce found on this site and it was excellent!

These were the worst meatballs I ever tasted. As I did not follow the recipe exactly, it may just be the way I made them. First, I used a combination of 1/3 beef, veal and pork. And, instead of just frying it for 6 minutes, my meatballs took about 10 minutes per batch to brown. I then cooked them in the sauce for 1 hour. They were as dense as hockey pucks. I prefer my meatballs softer than this. The flavor wasn't bad but I think that real garlic would have been better than garlic powder.

Excellent meatballs. I made these with the Spicy Tomato Sauce found elsewhere on this site, and they were delicious! My husband grew up on homemade "gravy" and meatballs, and he loved both recipes. My only suggestion is to decrease the recommended size of the meatballs. They were way too big!

I thought the meatballs were great, However, the recipe called for 3 C. water plus 2-26 oz jars of prepared sauce. I simmered for over an hour but it was still very watery. I ended up transferring some meatballls to another saucepan and adding another jar of prepatred spaghetti sauce w/ no extra water. Did I miss something or was the 3C. water a misprint?

The cooking procedure is very important, the following are my recommendations. 1. Use 2 tbs olive oil to fry meatballs 2. Cook meatballs in cast iron frying pan and turn until brown on all sides,cover and cook on low heat for 10 minutes. This steaming will blend the flavors. Pour off excess fat. 3.Cook sauce separate while the meat balls are cooking. Add meatballs to sauce and cook until desired consistency is attained. I add sweet basil to the sauce.

I thought the meatballs were fantastic. I would not change a thing. I did try the tomato-sausage sauce and was very disappointed. I followed the recipe and cooked the meatballs in the sauce as suggested by others. The result was a very thin sauce. I like a sauce to adhere to the pasta. This one definately did not. Two forks at best for the sauce.

Gorgeous and delicious! I made these to go into the suggested Tomato-Sausage Sauce. Lots of meat in the resulting recipe, but very tasty. I would watch the salt; the garlic powder gives these meatballs plenty of zing, and adding too much salt to the meatballs -- and to the sauce in which they're cooked -- can accumulate until your sauce is oversalted. A pinch of salt should be plenty to add to the meatball mixture. Also, I would cook these in a lot less fat. One-quarter cup of olive oil is probably not necessary; I bet two tablespoons would be plenty. The sauce starts out with an awful lot of oil, too, so don't start out with much oil for either part of the recipe. My resulting sauce was really too oily, although it tasted fantastic. The meatballs were very easy to work with and just fantastic-tasting.

I love these meatballs. They are delicious. I am a personal chef and every time I prepare this entree for a client they request it again. Kids like it too because the meatballs don't have any onions in them, but they are full of flavor. They are good served over rice or pasta.
