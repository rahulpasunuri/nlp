Outstanding. Used goat feta for the goat cheese and did NOT blend it in the cuisinart, used left over lamb shoulder roast and did not peel the red peppers as directed. It was excellent and the goat cheese stood up to the lamb very well.

A fulfilling meal with added roasted potatoes and pine nuts, just add roasted eschallots and it should be a lot better. Ensure your meat and vegetables are heated prior to serving and it is a satisfying dinner

Admittedly I made some changes, but I just didn't like this salad. The peppers were good, but the salad was too oily with the basil oil. I think making it a vinaigrette would help a lot. I didn't much care for the basil goat cheese, either, and I usually like goat cheese. Maybe it was just too strong for this salad? When blended in a food processor it had the consistency of cream cheese, which was odd in a salad. For the lamb I used a different recipe--I think it's listed under Barba Yianni's lamb on this site. It was excellent, but it's possible that the oregano overpowered the rest of the salad. In the future, I'd skip the salad entirely. (Sorry, chef.)

I thing it was 1994 or 95 when I create this recipe for gurmet magazine, mrs Peggy ask me to create a recipe with lamb, salad and I told her we dont have cold lamb salad in my country.Then I got this idea and I cook this recipe. If you want to make this recipe to be more yiami after you saute the lamb pull out of the fire and finised with litle OUZO. Also for the goat cheese you have to put it in food prosecor to be smooth with litle olive oil. I am happy every body like this recipe.

We made this without the lamb and it was still fantastic--easy, fresh, and delicious!

Goat cheese, at least the yummy creamy stuff in logs I can find, does not crumble. No matter, this was very very good with little lumps of cheese in it anyhow. I've made it twice, and it was a hit both times.

I love this recipe. I use leftover grilled lamb and a jar of roasted red peppers. It's so easy and so de-lish!

a salad-meal, this was delicious. A little work; I don't love browining and baking then cutting the lamb but I will do it all again when time permits. I added a few of the miniature pear tomatoes - guests loved it.

This salad can be used as a side or main dish. I used it as a side dish. Everyone raved over the flavor. I used the roasted red peppers you can buy. This is a very easy to assemble and can be done the night before. I also used the prewashed bags of baby spinach. This receipe is to die for it's sooooo good. I hope all you lamb and spinach lovers try it..................M
