The recipe was lovely and easy to make but I ran into one huge flaw. No where does it tell you what size skillet to use. I used a 10-inch nonstick (which I usually use for crepes) and I only got 9 crepes. Then, when I filled them appropriately, I only got 7 blintzes. I also think it's a little heavy on the cardamom.

My co-workers raved about these when I brought them in for a brunch; I used ricotta cheese and froze the blintzes before cooking, and everything tasted fantastic!

I've made this recipe a dozen times; I usually substitute ricotta cheese for farmers cheese. When I've finished making the blintzes, I put them on a cookie sheet and freeze them to use the next day. They cook more evenly, and it takes no time to prepare them. Pass the sour cream and/or applesauce if you aren't in the mood for the compote.

The real winner on this one is the compote... delicious!!! The rest of the recipe I can do without.

These were pretty good, but not amazing. I found that a splash of soda water made the crepe batter easier to deal with - I'll definitly use this crepe recipe again. The filling was just so-so, and I only had enough to fill about half the blintzes (and I really wasn't too generous with it). The rhubarb compote went well with the blintzes.

This was a huge hit for Mother's Day brunch, although I served it with the traditional blintz accompaniments: sour cream, applesauce and berry preserves. The blintzes themselves were absolutely delicious. Also a great all-around crepe recipe.

I don't know that I should even review this recipe because I changed it so much. I made the crepes and cheese filling as written; however, I included a line of homemade lemon curd in the crepe. I made a raspberry compote (Next time I'll leave the caradmom out of the compote. It got to be too much.); and after whipping some cream with a little of the lemon curd, I put a rasberry swirl through it. Sprinkled some fresh raspberried on the plates. Beautiful!!...but the TIME! Definitely prepare ahead. It took me half a day by the time all was said and done.

This is a delicious crepe recipe - you can use as is or substitute any topping. I made the cheese filling with 12 oz of cream cheese (not having the farmer's cheese on hand)and it was still delicious. I dislike rhubarb and used just strawberries. I served the crepes with side dishes of toppings - the fruit, whipped cream, and chocolate raspberry sauce. All combos were superb on the crepes. The initial cooking of the crepes is time consuming but the rest assembled quickly and if you prepare ahead you can quickly saute them for dessert for guests. I'll definitely make again.
