In excess this sauce may be a bit much, but it went wonderfully with the dark chocolate and brown sugar pound cake!

also a great last-minute topping for angel food cake--serve with some of those strawberries and you have a fancy, fast dessert. use low or non-fat sour cream with the angel food cake and you'll have a decadent dessert for those watching their fat intake!

This is also wonderful with Kalua instead of the vanilla. Great fruit dip. I show off and serve it in a hollowed coconut shell!

I didn't know you needed a recipe for this, but it is wonderful over a bowl of sliced strawberries. Or served as a dip with whole strawberries. People love it.
