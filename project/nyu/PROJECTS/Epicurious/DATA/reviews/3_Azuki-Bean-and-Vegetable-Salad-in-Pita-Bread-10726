A very good recipe but a little bland. We added a little Thai chili sauce to ours, but next time I would increase the garlic, too. Other changes I made: added green onions; used broccoli stems and flourets (blanched the carrots and broccoli stems for 1.5 minutes, then added the florets for 30 seconds); reduced the provolone to 1/2 cup; used rice vinegar b/c I didn't have white wine vinegar; served with mixed sprouts. (I think radish or arugula sprouts would add a little flavor, so might try that next time.) The family really liked this, though, so I will definitely make it again.

I made this and loved it. We took it with us to a show at a convention centre n(for our lunch) and people sitting around us wanted to know where we bought it! It looks and tastes good. We used asiago cheese.

Only so-so without the following addition: a lemon wedge needs to be provided for each plate. Without a bit of lemon juice, the sandwich is very bland; the lemon adds zest and brings out the flavor of the parsley.
