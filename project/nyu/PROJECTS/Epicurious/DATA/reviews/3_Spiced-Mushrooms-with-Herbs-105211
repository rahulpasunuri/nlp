This is a GREAT hors d'oeuvre. It's easy, quick and tasty. Everyone I've made them for love them. Make sure you grind the spices very finely or the result can be a bit gritty. But the flavors are wonderful. Plus, it's a hit with your vegetarian guests. I make this dish a lot.

I enjoyed this recipe. It is a refreshing change from everyday mushrooms. I just got back from Istanbul in May and the Turkish recipes were a welcome addition to my repetoire.

I love mushrooms and could only eat a couple of these. The spices were overwhelming and didn't work well together. Skip these but make the rest of the Turkish meal.
