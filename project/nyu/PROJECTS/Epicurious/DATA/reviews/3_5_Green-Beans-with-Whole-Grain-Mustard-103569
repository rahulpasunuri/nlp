We like this dish and make it often. It's easy and different. I sometimes add a splash of white wine vinegar to loosen the sauce a little and add a little tang.

I have been making these at Thanksgiving since 2000. A great dish to break in my new (old) cast iron frying pan. My wife and family love them.

Very simple way to add interest to green beans. Have made several times. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious and very fast. Made twice -- once as written, second added a bit of heavy cream to finish -- richer, better for cool weather. Use a good tangy mustard!

I was enticed by the simplicity. However, I didn't care for the taste even though I'm a mustard fan. The mustard didn't seem to do the beans justice, masking their sweetness but not adding enough zing.

Fabulous and simple, creamy without any fat. Great as a side dish to hot italian sausage.

Usually I'm not a fan of green beans but love all types of mustards. This recipe was simple and excellent. I added some broccoli that I had as well. I'll make this for company.

Simple and tasty. I used organic green beans, and creole mustard for extra kick. It came out perfect.

Friends loved it. Only problem - I perhaps overheated a bit - I had exploding mustard seeds. Quite comical and provided a little entertainment for the troops in the kitchen. Pain to clean off the walls, however.

Surprisingly tasty for so little effort. This recipe simply couldn't be any easier to make, but the first bite is a pleasant surprise, and it looks great on the plate.

I am NOT a green beans kinda gal, but I happened to have some and needed to get rid of them, fast. What a surprise! This recipe was tasty and easy. I didn't saute them too long, which kept the mustard flavor.

An easy and different twist to plain old steamed vegetables. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed them. I would definitely make this again.

I love mustard, and was disappointed that even with the brief cooking time, the mustard taste was almost nonexistent by the time it got to the table. I don't think I'll make it again.

This is one of the first dishes I learned to prepare when I was an exchange student in Paris - many, years ago. It never fails to please, and it is so easy my husband can make it. Try using different flavored mustards to vary the dish.
