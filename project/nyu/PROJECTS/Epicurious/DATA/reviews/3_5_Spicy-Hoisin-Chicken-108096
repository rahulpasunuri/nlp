This is a great yummy and quick recipe. The only modification I made was to top with some chopped green onions and bake at a lower temperature.

This was just ok for me. Not flavorful enough and hardly spicy. 500 degrees was was too high, though it was done quickly. The sauce was burnt. An extra half star for being easy but I'm not making it again.

This was phenomenal. I too doubled the sauce and baked it at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes so that the sauce didn't burn up. We served it with the Pinneapple Ginger Fried Rice on this site, and every plate was scraped clean!

The sauce in this recipe also works well for stir-fry. I wanted to use up some hoisin sauce, so I took a package of boneless skinless chicken breasts and an onion and cut both into 1" cubes. I then sauteed the garlic in 1 t of vegetable oil, threw in the chicken and onion until they were halfway cooked, and then poured in everything else (I doubled the ginger). I also threw in a splash of orange juice and let the whole dish finish cooking by simmering on low for 10 minutes while the jasmine rice finished up. Delicious and super easy. If I had time, I would have marinated the chicken in the sauce for at least an hour.

Rating: 3
I loved how this turned out. The sauce was not too sweet, which is rare with this kind of thing. The chicken was moist, delicious and took all of 15 minutes to prepare. I don't usually rate/review unless I made the recipe exactly as written, but I only deviated slightly on the cut of chicken, so I think it's OK. I used thin-sliced chicken breasts instead of bone-in thighs, because that is what I had on hand, and reduced the cooking time appropriately (10 mins). I will be making this a lot!

What a great recipe for chicken thighs. This is a keeper! Will do it again only a few changes. We went by the written recipe but only used four thighs. Thus we marinated for about 5 hours. The longer the better. There was so many reviews calling for different temps we did it for 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Came out perfect, also use 3/4 tsp. of pepper flakes for more of a sweet and sour taste. The sauce we used (marinade)for the end result was a little thick, we suggest using a little orange juice to thin it out. We had rice with it, but would go great with angel hair pasta.

This is super easy and delicious. Added a little extra spicyness but squirting some sriracha. Marinated for a few hours. Baked at 400 for a little longer as previous reviewers, and it was fine. Seved with white rice, cucumber salad, and bok choy stir fry.

Rating: 3
I wanted to use up a bottle of hoisin before moving, so I tried this recipe out and found it very tasty when prepared as directed. However, I did find that baking at 500 meant that any of the glaze that dripped onto the foil was burnt. Next time I make it, I'm going to lower the heat and leave it in longer, and also I'm going to try it foil-free, in a Pam-sprayed glass pyrex dish, in the hope that the glaze in the dish won't burn.

Yummy!! So quick and easy. I made with a 2 and 3 year old at my feet in a matter of minutes. I subsituted teriyaki for soy and it was really good! Would be good with any sauteed veggies - I used broc. and mushrooms. Was wishing I'd added bean sprouts. Topped with some cashews. Sooooo good. Definitely give it a try.

Rating: 4
This was soooo good that I had to write a review, which I have never done despite using the site for years. I tripled the sauce and used a combination of legs and breasts (cut into bite-sized pieces). I also toasted some sesame seeds and tossed them onto the chicken. Whenever I try to make asian food my family laughs and calls it "Chinese- tastes-the-same." No one was laughing this time, they were too busy licking their plates!

Rating: 3
those of us who love the thigh LOVE these. IF you don't like thighs you could do the same with other parts of the chicken. The plate and bones are clean so my guests have enjoyed them

Rating: 4
Super easy and delicious. I remove the skin from the thighs, and that works great. This recipe also works well with chicken wings (adjust time accordingly) In each case, I bake at 400 degrees for slightly longer time. Easy and so flavorful. I double the sauce and it all goes!

Rating: 4
So simple and so delicious. I omited the pepper flakes and used skinless thighs for a healthier dish. The chicken was incredibly tender and juicy after 25 minutes. I reserved some of the sauce to use after it was cooked, which made it extra good. Very positive reviews from my fiance too!!!

Rating: 0
Easy to make and the taste was fantastic! I however, used boneless chicken breasts sliced on the latitude. As reccomended, I doubled the recipe for the sauce. Made mushrooms and peas sauteed in olive oil and fresh minced garlic as a side dish and even added about 2 tbsps. of the remaining sauce to my vegetables. A great meal!

Big bang for the flavor buck, and extremely easy. Great party fare with rice.

I've been making this dish for over a year now. Here are the changes I've make. Use boneless skinless thighs, triple the marinated, except for the crushed red pepper and oil, marinate overnight. Add more garlic, 1-2 tsp garlic chili sauce and 1-2 tsp honey to marinated. Bake at 400 in a 9x13 dish covered with foil for 30-40 minutes, remove foil for the late 30-40 minutes or until cooked. Remove chicken to plate, cover to keep warm. Pour sauce into a sauce pan and reduce 5-10 minutes until slighty thickened. Company loves this dish, it's easy, serve with brown rice and steam veggie (green beans, broccoli, asparagus) something green. YUM!

This is a tough one to rate. It filled my gut. Tasted a lot better than take out. My kids seemed to enjoy it but I wouldn't say it was "Delicious". I suppose you should give it a shot, most everyone else seemed to love it. PS 2.65 Forks describes it for me.

Made this with grilled chicken breast that I cut into pieces instead of using fatty dark meat. Also added some chile sauce for extra spice. I didn't have fresh ginger so I left it out and it made no differece. Served with broccoli and rice for a stir-fry-eseque meal. I took the advice of others and made extra sauce to drizzle over rice and vegetables. Very quick and tasty weekday meal that would work with any other meat or tofu.

It is good, but next time save some sauce for later to toss with noodles to serve with the chicken(do not pour all of the sauce on the chicken: this will also avoid the chicken from burning).

Pretty tasty, but I would use less hoisin -- 1/2 cup overpowers the other flavors.

Great taste, easy to prepare and since I've got a big jar of hoisin in the fridge I'll be making this again.

With some modifications, this is a great recipe. Like the reviewer from Pasadena, I would not go heavy on hoisin, I used closer to 1/3 cup. I doubled the amount of cracked red pepper, added some hot chili garlic paste, and also mixed in about 1/4 cup of orange juice. This recipe is a good start, but I would definitely recommend playing around with it to get something worth making again.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and we enjoy it with rice. the trick is to roast it in the upper third of the oven until it is crispy. do not overdo the hoisin sauce or it will ruin the dish, but i would definitely use the hoisin sauce as listed in the recipe. I f you like the taste of chinese food you should like this dish it is quick, easy and delicious.

I thought this recipe was just so,so. If you have hoison sauce that you need to use up then this recipe is perfect, But I wouldn't go and buy hoison special for this recipe. There are better things to do with chicken thighs.

I've made this dish a few times. It's very easy to reduce this recipe to 2 servings, and if I cook it for myself the second serving heats up for a nice lunch for work the next day. I love ginger to I half the garlic and double the ginger for a little extra kick.

My husband says this is absolutely wonderful. We used chicken breast instead of the thighs and added 1 T red pepper flakes (since we likes things spicy). We cooked the chicken covered for 20 minutes, then uncoverd for 5 more. Next time, we would cut the chicken into bite size pieces and marinate overnight.

Wow, this was good. I used chicken tenders and marinated them for a few hours before baking at 350 for 15 min, then 425 for 5. I served them sliced atop "Asian noodle, mushroom and cabbage salad" from this site (bon appetit july '02). I can't wait to make it again. Enjoy!

The recipe is delicious although I do think that baking it in 500 deg. is too high. I baked it in 350 deg. for 30 min. and changed it to 500 for 5 min. You have to be careful though because once you increase the temperature, the skin of the chicken can get burnt right away. I also added about 1 tsp. of 5 spice which really made the chicken more flavorful

great recipe for chicken thighs...my pregnant wife loved it! Served with the spicy asian pasta, the two went really well together. Followed the additions from the previous reviewers. However, I wont cook the chicken at 500...I think that this heat is a little to high with all of the sugar based products in the glaze. Cooked at 425 instead.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe. Like other reviewers before, I also added honey, which was a wonderful addition.

I needed to use up some extra hoisin sauce I had leftover from another recipe I found on this site. Using the knowledge gleaned from that recipe, I cut the hoisin sauce in half on this one. (hoisin is SWEET). I also used boneless chicken breasts. This recipe came out "pretty good". I would make it again based only on the fact that it is super easy, and then, only if I had some hoisin sauce to use up.

Loved this dish. Added Honey, Garlic Chili sauce, more ginger and garlic. Baked skinless thighs on the bone about 30-40 minutes at 350, covered in foil. Next time, I'll try marinating overnight and opening the foil half way through the bake time.

I used two turkey thighs (skin on, bone in) weighing about 3 3/4 lb total. I made the sauce, as written, using about double the garlic & ginger, & more soy & adding chili garlic sauce & some black vinegar, allowing the turkey to marinate, all day, before roasting. As they roasted, I basted a few times, & served sprinkled with chopped scallion & black sesame seeds. It tasted like a succulent roast duckling, yummmmmmm!!

I made this for the first time last night and we loved it! I made it with drumsticks and since previous reviews said it wasn't that spicy I used a full teaspoon of the crushed red pepper.

Terrific recipe! I increased the sauce amounts a bit and used them as a marinade in a zip-loc bag for several hours for skinless thighs (with bones). Next time I'd like to try it as a glaze, as intended. Followed another's suggestion and roasted the meat at 400 deg. for 45 minutes. It was an easy, uncomplicated, delicious meal that got raves.

The first time I made this, I made it as written, and I wasn't that impressed...it seemed nicely spicy, but a bit flat. The next time, I salted the chicken and added about 2T. of honey, and let the chicken marinate a couple of hours before baking. The honey adds a nice element of flavor, and despite the soy sauce, the chicken really needed more salt. Also baked at a lower temp so the glaze didn't burn. Delicious, and a definite keeper!

One day, tired and out of inspiration for dinner, I scoured my recipes to find something easy to make. I found this god-send of a recipe. This is amazingly easy, quick, and delicious. Instead of cooking it in the oven, I threw the chicken on the grill, basted it with the sauce, and it was fabulous. Paired perfectly with an industrial-sized bottle of Kirin beer.

WOW! Was this good or WHAT?!? Can't tell you what temp I cooked them at or for how long. Oven is ready to retire & we had to work together. But if my defunct oven can produce such a nummy product---!?! I was tempted to "trifle" with the recipe. Glad I didn't. I agree--a good hosin sauce is really important. My favorite is Koon Chun, found in an Oriental shop. Next is Lee Kum Kee. Excuse me--I see wings waving in the back round wanting attention. They think they would like to bask in this sauce! Oh! I took frozen thighs out the night before. Put them in a zip bag with the marinade, fridged & cooked the next night. Excellent served with the Jasmine rice with green onions, peas & lemon found on this site. Easily a week night meal.

The sauce is scrumptious. Because of the high sugar content it turns into a kind of caramel during the roasting . . . I was scraping it off the foil w/ a fork and eating it plain! The extra sauce slid off the chicken (I used skinless thighs on the bone) so they weren't burnt at the specified temp. This was really easy and I usually have the ingredients around so I know I'll make it again. I used at least a full teaspoon of sesame oil and there was still just a mild nuttiness.

Excellent. Quick, easy, tasty. Increased the amoung of ginger, used skinless thighs, and had to lower oven temp otherwise made as per recipe. Perhaps there are varying amounts of sugar in different brands of hoisin which causes the chicken to burn faster for some people. Mine started to in just 10 minutes at 500 degrees. I think the sesame oil gives it a delicious, distinctive flavour.
