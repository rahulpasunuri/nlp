the saddest part about this recipe is that it contains 2 ingredients that no Jerk recipe should ever have nor would any self respecting Jamaican would use, TABASCO and JALAPENO!! NO NO NO NO... WRONG WRONG WRONG, Those 2 ingredients make this a mexican dish,

This is a great recipe. The original contribute recognized the limitations by using quotations. With that understanding this is a fantastic "jerk" chicken recipe. Do understand that true jerk chicken is not simply the ingredients but also the cooking style. This recipe manages to combine the sweetness, spice, and tangy flavors that jerk chicken is typically known for. It's fantastic for that purpose--- I did not have scallions or jalapeno and it was still seriously good ish....my only takeaway is that you should be cautious about using similar flavors in your sides....make those basic and allow the chicken to shine.

We liked it very much. I left out the scallions; didn't have any. The taste of cinnamon was most prominent. Not a bad thing, but I will reduce the amount the next time I make it.

i marinaded for a day with twice as much as i needed. when i cooked it, i braised it covered on both sides for 20 minutes. then i dumped out the marinade & dry roasted them 10 minutes each side for 10 minutes. i tried a couple after marinating 4 hours on the weber grill. they were good & smoky, but way less tasty then in the oven. absolute perfection. the finest wings made in my house. i used chinese 5 spice because i was out of allspice & did not use scallions either, but it did not seem to matter. this needs NO sauce or improvements.

While it may not be traditional jerk, this is my favorite wing recipe. I've baked in a conventional oven, wood-fired oven, and grilled on the BBQ. Best method is high heat wood-fired oven on uncrowded pizza pan. Other methods work well, but baking on a rack and not crowding the wings is key to crispy skin and attractive presentation.

This is OK, but there is a better jerk chicken recipe somewhere else on epicurious. It was a little greasy and dind't have the zing I expected.

Add the juice and zest of one lime and one orange and cut back on the oil a bit . Authentic "jerk" has a bit of citrus in it. Anything "jerked" is wonderful including these wings.

i thought this one of the worst recipes ever. the way it looked coming out of the oven would turn anyones stomach. the marinade was pretty tasteless for all the ingredients contained and certainly wasn't hot. the smell from the oven as they cooked was delightful..don't be fooled. it was awful tasting. the cinnamon flavor was to strong also.

Spicy and finger lickin' good!

I liked the food processor idea - it's very fast to just toss all the ingredients in at once. I marinated the wings in the same dish I baked them in - took a little over 2 hours at 450 degrees because the dish was a bit crowded. In the end, the meat was falling off the bone. They also traveled quite well and went great with mojitos.

I loved jerk chicken before i tried this recipe. I have made this dish a lot more since i tried this recipe. Especially, since it is so easy and all of the ingredients were in my home, anyway.

This recipe was really good (spicy) and I enjoyed it, but the chicken came out pretty bad looking.

Excellent! I also used my food processor. Just quarted the onion, trimmed the green onion, and threw everything else in. I used the canned diced jalepenos that you can usually find in the Mexican food section at a supermarket and they worked great. I had about 4 pounds of wings so I increased the marinade by 1/2. I put the wings in a large ziploc, added the marinade, and let them set in the fridge for about 5 hours. To roast, I just set them on a rack in a quarter sheet pan and that worked great. The tops were nicely browned. Next time I would flip them after maybe 20 minutes so the other side browns a bit better, but they tasted great. They were on the spicy side, but you could easily adjust that with a little less jalepeno. My husband loves buffalo-style wings so I decided to make these for his birthday and expand his horizons a bit. They were a big hit!

These were incredible! I just threw everything in the food processor - no need to chop it all first - and then marinated the wings in a plastic bag for 8 hours. I did get some marinade on my arm while getting the wings out of the bag and it *burned* and actually turned my skin red, so be careful. Got distracted while these were in the oven and baked them for more like 50 minutes, but they were outstanding with some bottled blue cheese dressing. Not as spicy as I would have thought, given the caustic nature of the marinade, but nice mix of flavors.

Not great taste, and not worth the effort...

I made this for a party, and it was a great hit. The recipe made an easy addition to the Jamacian theme.

This was very good. Much better than the bottled jerk sauces. I grilled the chicken instead on low heat for 30 minutes and it came out great.

Good as is, but outstanding when served with Chutney and Lime Dipping Sauce (Deviled Cocktail Sausages With Chutney and Lime Dipping Sauce). The marinade seemed too salty when I tasted it, but was ok after baking the wings. I made them ahead, then just reheated to serve. Made them for my family, but will definitely do again for a party.

Made them on the grill and the wings got crispy on the outside - just the way I like them. Everyone, even the kids, enjoyed them and there wasn't one left (out of 4 lbs of wings!)

This is a favorite recipe of mine. Great for big armchair athlete crowds and an excellent option for Buffalo Wing fans. A R&D chef friend loved them and we found that cooking them in a wood burning oven speeds up the cooking process and browns the wings wonderfully. However, for home cooks, the rack method in a relatively hot oven is fine. The drippings are great over steamed rice. Since I make this recipe in such large quantities (10 pounds at a time), I purchase the pre-cut chicken wings (aka drumettes) at Costco and marinate them in an extra large ziplock instead of a shallow dish. Using a ziplock eliminates the turning process and your hands don't get messy rubbing the marinade in. For best results, the wings really do need to be marinated overnight.

The marinade was great but the skin on the wings didn't brown so made the wings unappetizing. This marinade would be good with skinless chicken breasts!!!

I've made it three times and found the wings smoke a lot, even though they aren't burning. Other than the smoky clean-up, they are fabulous.

I have made this recipe twice. Once I made the recipe exactly as written and it was very good. The second time I took Clearwater's advice and baked them in a glass dish. The glass dish is indeed a better method. It is a little messier to eat, but the flavor is enhanced. Good eating!

I have made this recipe a few times and it is always sooo good! i haven't made it w/ the jalepenos since there are always kids around - they like it too. Everyone usually gobbles it up - therefore - triples easily!

I changed the recipe a bit by adding sour cream; Chicken thighs instead of wings; and bar-b-qued it....was a hit!

After honeymooning in Jamaica this past year, my husband and I were looking for a great jerk chicken recipe to mimick what we learned to love at the islands. Was disappointed with the outcome of this recipe---nothing like the that of true Jamaican jerk! Marinade turned out to thick and flavors too bland.

This recipe is a keeper. I pulled them hot out of the oven and they were gobbled up by my guests immediately. I will be using this oven method for my other wing recipes as well as they truly get a beautiful brown color to them.

YUM!!! I made this last night with skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Breasts were marinated overnight. There was a slight lettucey taste and that could be due to the fact that I didn't measure the green onions. I just through in a bunch. I also couldn't find pickled jalapenos and instead used nacho jalapenos. In any case, the breasts were VERY tender and flavorful and a little spicey. I baked them in a glass dish at 425 degrees for 30 min. I'll definitely make this again.

Wow! This chicken was so tender. The marinade was kind of overpowering while it was being prepared, but toned down nicely when cooked. I decreased the allspice, cinnamon and pepper increased the soy sauce, and added honey. I had a bunch of kids here when I served it, and they went nuts over it. (I didn't reveal the ingredient list until after they were finished!)

We had an international lunch at work, and I decided to cook this recipe. It was delicious and extremely complex. I marinated the wings overnight and cooked them the following night. I brought them into work the next day, heated them up in an oven....and they were soooo tender. Great appetizer! (Came in 2nd in employee voting after the Italian meatballs)

Made this as an entree (that's before the main course in Australia!) for a "Caribbean" theme dinner party - everyone loved it, very tasty and chicken was incredibly tender

This was great! I actually used chicken breast with the skin on! I through them on the grill and my 3 year old ate 2 breasts! It was a big hit with the whole family!

A great recipe indeed!! Just made it last Sunday (11 Apr 1999) & it got raves from the family. I made use of chicken thighs. Actually, though I apportioned the dish among us for taste-testing ... the family really enjoyed it and before I knew it - I lost my share of the chicken. But I got a taste of the the drippings though!!!

This is an excellent recipe. While I have never been to Jamaica, there is something very "authentic" tasting about these wings. I think it may be the use of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice that gives this dish its exotic taste. It lends it self to improvisations or variants. Next time I'm going to add some molases or honey to sweeten the marinade or maybe a squirt of vinegar to add a sour tang to it. I added some extra cloves of garlic and had about 12 squirts of tabassco, but it's the pickled peppers that are in charge of the heat in this dish. I also added some chilli powder to give it a reddish color. These will definately be served at my next party.
