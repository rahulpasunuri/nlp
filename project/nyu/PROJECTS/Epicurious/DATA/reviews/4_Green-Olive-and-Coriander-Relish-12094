We served this relish as a side dish to "Roast Pork Tenderloins with Cranberry-Port Sauce". We made the pork first with the cranberries. The second time, I served it with this Olive Relish. (First the pork was served with sweet sauce, then with this savory relish.) This relish is so quick and simple, I'm sure I'll make it again. The coriander seed is a good flavor match with the olives.(I really like coriander!)
