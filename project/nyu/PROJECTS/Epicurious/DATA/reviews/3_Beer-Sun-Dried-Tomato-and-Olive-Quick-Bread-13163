I needed a good quick and plain bread recipe, so I used this as a base, eliminating the tomatoes and olives. I added a bit more salt, a 1/4c oil, an extra egg, and about a 1/4c sugar. It came out pretty well and is totally yummy with honey.

We used fresh stone ground soft wheat, and Sam Adams seasonal brew of Noble Pils. The brew gave the bread a wonderful aroma and flavor. The olives were okay, but I would have preferred kalamata. It is a recipe that could very easily be varied with other ingredients. We will definitely make this bread again

This bread hardly rose for me, perhaps because I live in the tropics which is incredibly humid? I ended up feeding fish the entire bread, who seem to like it more than I did. Perhaps in the tropics, we need to use yeast instead, which a friend suggested, and leave the bread to rise a little before putting it in the oven.

Must append last review with note that I added more tomatoes than olives (after personal preference). I think this contributed to the bread's moist factor.

Fantastic paired with all sorts of different flavors. When it was on the cusp of getting stale, made paninis using a turkish pepper/spice spread (acuka) and fresh mozzarella. A lovely savory quick bread.

Despite other cooks reviews I forged ahead and made this bread. I added more olive oil which worked and the bread is very moist. However, I would add more sundried tomatoes next time. The half cup didn't seem to add up to enough. I did not add the olives, but did add a few tablespoons of fresh rosemary. It needed more I will add next time. As for the olives, I would add kalamata and not alot on my next attempt. Other reviewers were right--it can be a little bland and needs extra "oomph" by adding garlic which I'll also try. It is good and quick, just a recipe in need of some personal creativity thrown in!

Was disappointed. The olives are overpowering and flavors did not meld well. This might be better with kalamata olives or none at all. Would not recommend if wanting bread. Really should just make bread.

Loved it but it was a little dry, as mentioned by previous reviewers. Even though I kept all the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes instead of only reserving 1 Tbsp it was still too dry. I hate olives and didn't put them in so that may account for some of the dryness. Next time I'll try adding some butter and maybe another egg. I used Hefeweizen beer and it was good. I added 1 Tbsp of rosemary and it complemented the other flavors very well. Next time I'll also add some fresh crushed garlic.

Its texture was more like a dense, dry scone than a quick bread. It would have tasted better if turned out lighter. Adding some other flavours might also help.

I almost always make yeast or sourdough breads (I have a starter in my fridge), but on this day my husband requested bread with dinner and I hadn't planned for it, thus not having the time to do a long rising bread. For this recipe, I substituted kalamata olives for the pimiento ones and I used a bottle of Beck's pale ale. I thought the loaf was pretty tasty, very quick, and easy, but nothing spectacular. Good for a last minute thing, but if time permits, I'll always go with breads made with yeast or sourdough starter.

This recipe makes great bread for when you don't have time to wait for yeast dough to rise. The beer produces a moist bread. I didn't have sun-dried tomatos or olive around, so I used rosemary and fresh ground black pepper. My guests requested the recipe it was so good.

Very good and different. Substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat and added rosemary. Melt cheddar cheese on top of slice...mmmm...

I too modified this recipe by not adding the olives (because I don't like them), adding cheese and a handful of chopped fresh herbs. It was wonderful and makes a great exotic toast for the next morning with eggs. Yum.

This is a very good textured, moist bread with a delicious crust. I made some minor adjustments as I did not have sundried tomatoes and had some protests to olives. Instead I added some chopped roasted red peppers, a little olive oil, and some small cubes of cheddar cheese. This is a great basic bread to which you can add virtually anything!

This is so easy and it has a very good texture for a quick bread. I add some pressed garlic 2-3 cloves and 1/3 cup grated pecorino romano or parmigiano. I also increase the cooking time by 5 minutes. It gets better as it sits!

We made this to use up that wretched Sam Adams Light, which might be why the bread was a bit bland. A better beer would probably make a better bread. I did like the texture, though, and the flavor did improve with age.

This bread was good the first night, but far better the second night. I omitted the olives because of a picky eater at my house, and I increased the amount of sundried tomatoes to compensate. Dipping the sliced bread in extra virgin olive oil added a lot of flavor, too.

To improve the texture, I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the dough and basted the loaf with melted margarine about 20 minutes into the baking process. We used Schlafly Pale Ale, and needed to add about 6 oz. more to the dough. The grocer was out of sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, so I opted to try a sun dried tomato and garlic puree. We also added 1/4 tsp. of lemon pepper. Very hearty and delicious with my chicken and vegetable soup!

really tasty, good for making sandwiches or alongside some soup.

A few diced hot peppers are an excellent addition to this tasty bread. I didn't like the cakey texture at first but the loaf improved dramatically in flavour and texture after 24 hours. Will definitely make again.

makes a wonderfully moist and flavourful bread that is a good accompaniment to any Italian or Mediterranean dish. I have also used it as toast strips with garlic-calamari soup.

We really like this. It was much tastier after it set for awhile. We will make it again. It is very easy to make.
