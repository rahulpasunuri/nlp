What a fabulously tasty and easy dish. My husband LOVED it. I had no chiles on hand, so I used a few drops of chile sauce, and home-canned tomatoes. I didn't puree or strain the tomatoes per other reviewers suggestions - we liked the chunks of tomato on the sauce. My neighbors are suddenly giving me lots of fresh eggs from their backyard chickens, and this will be a standard dish to help use them up.

Just thinking about this dish makes my mouth water. I cheated and used a 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes, and I've put it atop English muffins if I don't have any baguettes in the house. Just scrumptious! The sauce also freezes well to re-heat for an easy weeknight dinner.

This is a delicious recipe. I couldn't get fresh tomatoes so used canned ones, but used water left over from cooking up some fresh corn to lend sweetness. Like other reviewers, I did not strain the sauce. Also, I added local roasted hatch chiles. We will definitely have this again.

I received a dozen fresh eggs from a friends farm this week and decided to try this recipe with them. I now can't stop thinking about this sauce. I made some minor adjustments. I used a can of whole tomatoes, a whole jalapeno w/ half the seeds and rib removed (made it VERY spicy) and did not discard the solids. This sauce was to die for and I'm thinking of 1001 other things I could serve with it. Love, love, love it.

This is worth 3.5 forks. Followed the recipe nearly exact, but didn't drain the solids. Through the bread slices on the grill, and cut the recipe in half. Really, really good, and we'll definitely make this again.

This was quite delicious. Used fresh tomatoes from the garden and didn't discard the solids (don't know why the recipe called for that). I served it over toastadas instead of bread and offered tortillas on the side. Will definitely make it again!

I made this the first time today for a late, Sunday breakfast, and it hit the spot perfectly. I think the draining of the solids might be a pointless step, and it was a little on the oily side. But, this was still the best egg dish either of us has had in quite some time. We served it with flour tortillas, and will probably try it with rice next time!

This is a tasty dish that I have now made 3 times. This time I cheated to make this a quick week night dinner, with no negative effect on the flavor. Since tomatoes are out of season, I used a large can of chopped tomatoes, and did not blend or strain anything. I just sauteed the garlic and pepper, then added the canned tomatoes. I also did not use the baguette. Instead, I cut a corn tortilla into short strips and toasted them in the toaster oven until crispy-chewy.

I thought this recipe was a little labor intensive, but made for good comfort food. I added black beans to the bowl with the poached eggs before I drowned it all with the sauce. And, for heaven's sake, DON'T discard the solids from the tomato sauce...add a little lemon juice and chopped cilantro and you have yourself a lovely salsa to snack on while you finish cooking dinner. I thought, too, a little dob of sour cream might have added a little zip to the whole dish...I think next time I'll serve it with warm flour tortillas instead of baguette...which became rock hard sitting in the cooling oven as the recipe suggested.

I assume that you have tried this since you saw fit to leave feedback! I only suggested the similar dish was lovely and this had even more ingredients which I love. Surely this site is for likeminded cooks and isn't designed for us to be unpleasant to each other. I have tried it now though - twicwe in one weekend! And it was as good as I expected.
