Delicious! You can probably get away with less butter. The amount it made was more than enough for the shrimp cakes so I'm trying the leftover sauce on some grilled chicken later this week. I think the sauce would work with most seafood - grilled scallops particularly - and chicken or even some sauteed julienne carrots and zucchini.

Liked the acidity and tartness. Used dry vermouth as the wine and served over seared salmon. Very good!

I made this sauce to serve with pasta and sauteed shrimp, but did not make the shrimp cakes so I cannot comment on them. However, I am disappointed to report that the chili-lime garlic sauce was one of the worst recipes I have ever made from this site. The sauce was unbelievably acidic and harsh; I needed to add a tablespoon of sugar to take the acrid edge off and make it edible. If I were to make this again (which is highly unlikely in a world where there are so many other recipes to try), I would definitely cut back on the amount of lime juice and chili-garlic sauce to tone down the acidity. I also wonder whether substituting coconut milk for the cream might add some body and sweetness that might make this sauce more palatable.

I love this recipe. I am very particular about my chile garlic sauce, and the one from Lee Kum Kee is far and away the best for almost all recipes, but absolutely the best for this sauce. I also cut the butter to 4T and notice no difference at all in flavor.

This sauce was a waste of ingredients. All i tasted was the hot sauce and it's so fattening. Would love to find a better sauce as I liked the shrimp cakes. In the meantime, i think the cakes go pretty well with the Mae Ploy Sweet Chili sauce that you can buy at Asian markets.

A very tasty sauce with the shrimp cakes. I liked the tart bite to the sauce. I will try and find a lower calorie way to get this same flavor.

Delicious combination! I served it over the shrimp cakes. That Chinese chili garlic is spicy, but the other ingredients tempered it beautifully.

I used this as a dipping sauce for steamed shrimp, and it was spot onthe perfect marriage of creamy and tangy. After tasting it, my guests ignored the cheese plate and white bean-red pepper puree, instead using the crackers, crudités, and anything else they could find to sop this up. Im even making some more for dinner tonight to drizzle over fish.

This sauce really raises the already delicious shrimp cakes to another level. But don't make the mistake I made the last time I prepared it. I made the sauce a 1/2 hour ahead of frying the shrimp cakes and kept it warm over low heat on the stove - it separated badly. (We ate it anyway.)

I've made this recipe a couple of times now and it is excellent! I've served it over the Shrimp Cakes with Chili-Lime Sauce from this site and also with pan-seared tuna -- both are delicious! Tip for serving the shrimp cakes ahead of time for a dinner party -- follow recipe instructions to the end, including frying the cakes in the peanut oil. Cool and refrigerate. Reheat in oven on an ungreased baking sheet at 350 degrees for 15 - 20 minutes or until heated through and serve with the sauce (which can also be prepared ahead and reheated on the stovetop). The outside of the cakes get an even nicer 'crisp' factor to them (be careful to not burn them!), and you don't have to be hovering over the stovetop frying cakes while you could be with your guests. Next time I think I'll just bake them from the beginning and omit the frying step to see how that works.

This was an amazing recipe with awesome flavors! If it didn't work for some of you , then maybe the type of sauce you used wasn't the right kind. I'm a VERY picky person when it comes to cooking and taste. Follow it to the "T" and maybe it'll work for you. I used this sauce with the shrimp cakes and have also used it with other seafood dishes.

I have made this on several occasions with tilapia and it is a wonderful touch. My husband calls the sauce, "plate licking good." Incredibly simple and quick. Definite keeper!

This sauce has intense flavors that my wife and I loved. The surprising contrast between the lime and chili paste made for an interesting sauce that can be used for all kinds of dishes. We used it on the shrimp cakes from this site. We also served steak and it worked as a steak sauce too.

I'm giving this one 3 forks because my husband really liked it. I used Sriracha (we call it rooster sauce because of the rooster on the bottle), which I love but think I would have been happier adding fresh minced chile and garlic instead.

Must agree with txjuju from Austin. THis dish is excellent just as written! Yes, many recipes can be improved with a personal modification here or there, but don't mix a couple of items from the recipe with MAYO, then tell us, in this review section, that it was good. Just submit your own recipe for God's sake! If you like lime, if you like this combo of ingredients, and you really should be familiar with your own palate if you're on this site, then make it...period. I LOVED it!

It pains me how often people completely modify recipes then give the original recipe four forks saying, We really liked this recipe! (when they actually created something that is a pale shadow of the original!) How about this: I didn't have any of these ingredients on hand so I just went outside and licked the pavement. Yum! It was delish! I'd give this recipe FIVE forks if I could!

I really disliked this. Don't know if it was too much ginger or lime, but it was a real waste of ingredients and time. Ended up throwing together a chili-lime mayo at the last minute to serve with the shrimp cakes - mixed mayo with some of the garlic chili sauce and a sqeeze of lime juice. Much better!

For us, this dish as made is worth 3 1/2 stars but I'm giving it 4 because that's what it will be when I cut the lime juice from 1/4 cup to 3 tablespoons. We had this with fish and loved it. The two tablespoons of chili-garlic sauce was just right for us, and is not too hot.

Used Benecol in place of butter, bottled lime juice, and powdered ginger (1 teaspoon). I rarely use real butter (watching the saturated fat intake), and as for the lime and ginger, I didn't have the real thing on hand. Nevertheless, hubby and I were both pleased with the results.

This recipe left me wondering how something so easy could be so tasty! This is an excellent sauce with a different flavor.

Tip - to balance the flavors of the sauce, add 1 tsp of brown sugar. I also grated the ginger, used 1 green onion instead of the shallot and only used 4tbsp of butter. Guests loved it and husband said this is the best dish I've ever made and he considers me to be a very good cook!

The cakes were tasteless without the sauce - would reduce lime juice if made again.

Delicious and a huge party favorite as an hors d'oeuvre. Just make them bite sized.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME...LOVED IT OVER PASTA, A GOOD CRUSTY BREAD TO GO WITH WOULD BE GREAT. I SUGGEST AT LEAST DOUBLING THE RECIPE. GOURMET!!

I have made this a few times and have received great reviews each time! LOVE IT! Easy to make which helps. The only change I have made is to decrease the chili sauce by half since it is a bit spicy for us. You must try this recipe!

This is the best sauce ever. Never tried it with the shrimp... I'm sure it would be great. I pan sear red snapper then top w/this sauce ... so, so yummy.

This was an excellent sauce. Was very easy, and would be wonderful on any grilled fish or shellfish....or on anything actully.
