I've made these a couple of times (with the prior recommendations to increase to 3 eggs and 5 Tbsp oil) to great reviews from my husband and office mates. The dough is a little sticky but wet your hands when you handle it and it will take shape very nicely. I usually leave my biscotti in oven overnight after turn off for required baking time so that they are the perfect dry texture, but that was a mistake this time because it caused the cherries to dry out and become very chewy.

I found this biscotti dry to work with. I did not use unbleached flour and felt that it would have been even drier. I added an egg and this worked. The biscotti was difficult to cut and I have a fine serrated knife. The dried cherries I used I felt were too big for the recipe making it difficult to slice. I did not get nearly the amount of biscotti indicated. All that said, the flavour was good.

Make a double batch, I made it a week ahead of Christmas and it was so delicious I kept sneaking a nibble or offering it to friends for Christmas. Had to make another batch (my batter was a bit dry so I added a little apple cider).

I used 3 eggs instead of 2, as 2 eggs were not enough liquid. I kept all of the other ingredients the same. I now have to make the biscotti practically on a weekly basis as everyone in household is addicted! Best biscotti ever.

these were absolutely phenomenal!!! yes I agree the dough was very sticky and difficult to work with but don't be dissuaded definitely worth the minor trouble. made exactly to recipe and they were a complete revelation, getting better and better each day,had to wrench the last few from my boyfriend's hand to save for guests. I plan to make these for Christmas gifts. Superlative cookies for coffee or tea and very pretty.

The dough is exceedingly sticky and a bit hard to work with but it's plenty moist enough without monkeying around with the recipe. I used my KitchenAid to mix it most of the way but had to use a stiff spatula to try & incorporate the nuts/cranberries. For me, the recipe made 33. I ommitted the zests and sub'd dried cranberries, which I whirled around in the Cuisinart -- along with the pistachios -- to chop up a bit (if there are big chunks in biscotti it makes it really hard to cut them & keep their shape). We tasted them warm then came back the next day and they were substantially better. I had some leftover dk. chocolate ganache into which I dipped some of these biscotti; if you're a chocolate-lover the flavor combo is terrific.

Great recipe. Two modifications Skipped the oatmeal. Added a small amount of milk until the dough came together. Sort of like you would for a pie crust.

Made this recipe as written except made slices 1/2" instead of 1/3" thick. Perfect!

The best biscotti recipe I've ever used. The combination of cherry + pistachio is fantastic, and the recipe created the perfect texture. Unlike the other reviewers, I think there was enough liquid. The dough was crumbly, but it came together and produced a great texture. Also-- no need to chop up the dried cherries, they look and taste great as whole pieces. Great recipe and now my "go-to" for biscotti.

Further to drop cookie consistency review, they did, indeed make very decent drop cookies, which I served to my guests with coffee after a dessert of sorbet after lunch.

I felt uncertain about adding whole cherries to this dough because they are very large items to incorporate into a small loaf. I decided to follow the suggestions of the other reviewers, adding an extra egg and 2 TBS of oil. What I got was a very wet drop cookie batter, completely unworkable as a dough. Adding a little more flour just made it sticky and more would have upset the leveaning balance. I MAY try the recipe as is at another time, but the ingredients are so expensive (I used top quality pistachios and organic cherries, which I chopped per reeviewer suggestions. Have decided to go back to my tried and true biscotti recipe.

I should have read all the reviews befor making this today. I had a feeling the ingredient list was off - as siimply not enough liquid. Dried cherries are expensive - and I wasted a lot because they simply did not incorporate into the dough well enough. After the first baking several fell off and are too puffed and burnt to eat. My second baking is happeing now - I salvaged enough to have at my dinner party, as it crumbled a lot when cutting - but I like the idea of chopping the cherries first - and for sure adding more liquid. I have lots of recipes for biscotti - so not sure I would try this one again....I will say yes though with modification!!!! Love the aroma right now though as they bake!!!! I'll see how my guests like them!

I'm giving this 4 forks to review what I made, ie., the changes in liquid ingredients previous reviewers mentioned. I went with 3 eggs, 5 tbsp. of canola oil. The results were delicious. I loved the orange zest! Will definitely make these again, probably this weekend.

Agree with prior reviews, including kicking myself for not reading these before baking. Added a little milk to the dough to make it more wet and used cranberries instead of cherries. Beautiful colors and quite tasty. Will try other suggestions next time and perhaps it will reach a four fork.

This recipe needs to be revised, and I'm kicking myself for not reading the reviews here before making it. Two eggs and 3 tablespoons of oil is nowhere near enough liquid for the rest of the measurements. It was completely dry, crumbly, and impossible to form. Next time, I would do most of laurecec's modifications: 5T oil, 3 eggs, chop the cherries and pistachios so they incorporate into the dough a bit better. They are very tasty, but the recipe doesn't work well as written!

I was attracted to this recipe because of oil instead of butter and found it to be delicious, although I will try a little more oil next time. Here's a tip I use when making any biscotti: when shaping the logs, instead of putting flour on my hands, I wet my hands. Much easier to shape and it doesn't add more flour, which is drying. Any excess moisture evaporates very quickly in the oven. I also drizzled the finished cookies with bittersweet chocolate--YUM!

Oh wow, yes the dough was super dry but you just work it. The texture is perfect, love it crunchy with my coffee!! love the dried cherry and pistacio combo. cant stop eating them.

Most biscotti recipes have at least 5 tablespoons of butter for this amount of flour so I used 5 tablespoons of canola oil and it was perfect. It may be a type error because a friend told me she made them and they were too hard to form and were very crumbly when slicing for the second bake. Also, I used dried cranberries and 1/4 cup less sugar. They were delicious!

These are sooo good! I did modify the recipe a bit though. I used 5 tbs of oil and three eggs, as the dough was too dry. I also halved the amount of dried cherries and pistachios (only 1/2 cup of each), and chopped them before adding them to the dough. I also omitted the orange zest entirely. These were such a hit at my house, I have made two batches this week. So good dunked in a cup of tea of coffee.

These have great eye-appeal, but they taste like fruitcake (and we're not big on fruitcake). I found the dough quite dry and difficult to shape, so I put everything back in the mixer and added a 3rd egg. Too much orange zest for us and too much fruit. Lots of pistachios (and who can complain about THAT), but that added to the dryness problem. Proved hard to cut into 1/3" thick slices (they crumbled), so I went with a generous 1/2" slice.
