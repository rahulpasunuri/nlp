This is a great recipe. But like many other users, I found the outcome to be best by cooking the risotto slowly, first adding wine (pinot grigio) and then chicken stock one cup at a time. Also, like other users, I've found that using the spicy sausage overwhelms the flavour of the dish, so after my first go round, I've stuck with mild italian sausage.

I'm pretty sure this has become my most-cooked recipe from this site over the past several months! Great recipe with lots of flavor and SO easy to whip together quickly. My favorite add-in is asparagus, which I just in about halfway through cooking, but the recipe is just as delicious with the sausage alone. Like others, I DO add in a little more cheese.

I made the risotto in the traditional way (1/2 cup wine, slowly add broth), plus I added spinach and peas, which made it colorful and healthier. I used two turkey sausages, one sweet one spicy. My boyfriend liked it but I thought the sausage flavor was too strong. Next time I'll use one sausage and more herbs and veggie.

I made this as a main course, this past weekend. As did many others, I cooked the risotto in a more traditional way, adding stock slowly, adding 1/2-c white wine, and using Arborio rice. I also used about 1/2-pound of sausage, which seemed the right amount, used 1/2-cup Parmesan, and used about 1/4-c parsley and about 1-Tsp of Basil. Another reviewer had suggested adding some shredded carrot for color. So, I added maybe 1/2-c of shredded carrot and it really did add some visual pop. Loved it. Will make it again. My 2-year-old loved it!

This is an easy and delicious recipe that I make often. It is a flexible and great with additions from the fridge and whatever I have on hand including mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and peppers. I make it as a traditional risotto, often adding a splash of wine or beer to the arborio rice before adding the broth a little at a time.

I made this pretty well with a pre-cooked Cajun sausage... just gave it a whirl in the food processor. Came out great! I definitely would make this again.

This is a great recipe! I added some fresh asparagus and shredded carrots about 1/2 way through the cooking process and this is wonderful. I usually use 3 sauasages, uncased. And add a bit more parm. cheese.

Excellent recipe. A bit heavy, though. In the future, may try a bit of lemon to lighten things up. Would also add some more onions and decrease the sausage to maybe 1/2 to 3/4 lbs. All in all though, you won't be disappointed!

Super yummy! I used turkey spicy itialian sausage and basil instead of parsley. I also cooked it the more traditional risotto way with wine and cup of broth at a time. It only needed about 1/2 cup of cheese, it was so creamy and good!

I also made this in the traditional risotto style and it was great. I added peas in as my vegetable which gave it some flair and texture. Very good - will make again!

I revised this recipe in the same way many reviewers did to make it more of an authentic risotto. I don't really find it that much of a bother to do it the traditional way. I used arborio rice, I used 1/2 cup of wine in place of some of the broth, I added that wine to the risotto first, and I added my broth slowly waiting for each pour to be absorbed before adding the next. I also added zuchinni as one reviewer suggested and it was pretty good, the color was definitely a plus since this is pretty much a grey mush. I think next time I will add diced carrots and celery along with the onions instead though, somehow I think that would fit the flavor of the dish better than the zuchinni. I'll also reduce the sausage to half or 2/3 of whats called for, it was very sausagey. My boyfriend loved it, and its simple so it will be made again.

I absolutely love this dish. I made it for a dinner for two and had it for lunch and dinner the next day. I substituted spicy sausage for mild and added a cup of peas. Mmmmm, so good.

This is so good! I followed other's advice and made this like real risotto (adding the broth a little at a time) - it was my first time and it came out great! I will try adding veggies next time to round it out a bit since I make it as the main course. It is a heavy dish but so wonderful and very easy to make. And the leftovers were still great the next day!

Three and a half forks. It should be illegal to make a risotto this easily. Since I made this as a main course, I added mushrooms to the sausage and onion saute, and threw in some zucchini towards the end for added color and nutrients. Used arborio rice, but since I was looking for something a little less high-maintenance, I added all the broth at once and it was still creamy and fabulous. Truly delicious.

This dish is better for winter than for summer. The sausage added all the spice necessary. I used aborio rice and cooked it like a real risotto (adding the water little by little). It turned out great, not gummy or anything. Don't skimp on the parmesan!

This recipe is outstanding. I have made it several times as a main course, expecting some leftovers, and there never are any! Tasty and simple!

Used 3/4 lb sweet Italian turkey sausage (don't like hot, boyfriend doesn't eat pork), which seemed the right amount. Used arborio rice. I didn't add the broth all at once, I added it hot little by litte and got a really nice, creamy texture.... until b/f came home 45 later than planned and I didn't know how to reheat properly- any suggestions? It became a big blob. He loved the taste and asked me to make it again, but we had to laugh at how crazy the meal looked all blobbed together like that.

Good comfort food. I added a 1/2 cup of dry white wine based on some of the other reviews. I also increased the parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup to make it a little more creamy.

As a mom of five, all of my dinners have to be quick and I use what I have on hand. I used mild(sweet) sausage and quick rice. I cooked the sausage,onion,garlic as directed, but added green pepper to add a little color.Just before the sausage was done, I added dried oregano & parsley, black pepper and just a dab of cilantro. I added no salt!!!(I never do. One person's salty is another's perfection). Sorry I can't give measurements, I learned to cook the old-fashioned way, using your taste,touch,and smell!!!I also let people add the cheese at the table to their taste. This was a great dish, it tasted wonderful, smelled great,and I disagree with the other cook. I think it looked nice as well, given a little help! Best of all the kids loved it and I did it all in one pan. This one is a keeper!!! Twenty minutes and I had a wonderful meal that didn't stress me out and tasted wonderful!!!!!

Used mild sausage to be safe for my guests, but this dish was just a little boring. Was OK used as a second course before the main course, but it doesn't look very pretty, was a little too salty, but it was fairly easy to make.

Very nice, simple recipe. I used arborio rice and a Texas smoked sausage and it came out very good.

I followed a couple of the reccomended changes and this turned out pretty well. I agree that 1 pound of sausage is too much. The basic risotto recipe I learned was to use some white wine after the rice goes in but before the stock. Then the stock, which should be hot, should be added bit by bit about a ladel full at a time and more is added as evaporation and absorbtion occurs which is how the rice develops a creamy texture. I had never heard of pouring in 4 cups of stock all at once so I dodn't do it that way. Anyway it tasted good and I'll probably try it again.

Swatch is right: too much sausage. Next time I'm going to brown the meat and drain the fat before adding the onion. A cup of Columbia Crest Sauvignon Blanc ($8/bottle in PA) in place of a cup of stock added a complementary tang. This recipe is a keeper.

This was my second time of making risotto (novice cook), the first recipe I tried was Champagne Risotto with Scallops (from this website). I expected the texture of this recipe to be similar to the previous one I tried - very smooth and creamy. Whereas the flavor of this recipe was good (I used half broth and half white wine, a couple of splashes of marsala, and added mushrooms), the texture wasn't the same.

soooo gooooodddd!!!! for those cold winter nights....the ones we canadians know all too well....there is nothing better than a big bowl of this risotto in front of the fire! a casual meal during the week, perfect all on it's own. i only make half of the recipe and use real italian rice (add water instead of more broth and cook a little longer) ...also, use the maximum amount of parm cheese....yummy yummy yummy. who cares if it's cold outside!!!

This is spectacular!!! I substituted hot italian turkey sausage for the pork sausage, added 2 tsp of oil, and added the mushrooms and sundried tomatoes at another reviewers suggestion. Fairly low-fat, low-point (we're on weight watchers) and tastes like you've just had something incredibly decadent. Oh, and easy too!

Wonderful and simple. Be sure to use a high quality sausage, and real arborio rice. I used a medium grain rice which had a less appealing consistency. I also recommend adding more wine. Gives the dish a more rounded flavor.

I have made this a number of times -- it is fantastic. However, I would recommend adding one cup of white wine before chicken stock and then letting that reduce, then adding chicken stock one cup at a time, letting each cup reduce before adding the next. My fiancee declared this the best risotto he had ever had!!

Okay, maybe it's me. I made this dish with spicy turkey sausage, arborio rice, and great expectations. It was dull. My family finished what was on their plates, but no one went back for more, all asked me not to make it again, and I threw half away.

I had never attempted to make risotto at home so I was skeptical as to how this would turn out. It was EASY, FAST and delicious. I, too, deviated a bit from the recipe and used the leftover polish hot link sausages instead of the Italian sausage and it turned out just fine. This is a keeper!

Instead of Italian sausage, I used a chicken-apple-chardonnay sausage and was thoroughly delighted with the outcome. Also, I use aborio rice (the traditional risotto rice) instead of white long-grain. I've made many risottos before, and this is one of the best.

I'd never made risotto before and always heard that it was really tricky, but when I made this dish, it seemed quite simple. This recipe was quite tasty and very filling. A good winter supper. Makes a lot of food, though. There are only two of us, so I halved the recipe and STILL ended up eating this for lunch for several days afterwards.
