I made this exactly as written and think it really is a lovely balance of flavors. The beans look a little odd in the dish by western standards but this gives the dish a more complete protein profile.

Perfect. Having never ventured into Indian cooking, I made this for a Southern Indian family that joined us for their first official Thanksgiving Dinner. They enjoyed it enough to ask for this recipe (as well as for the cottage cheese jello salad). I made 3x the recipe a day ahead and reheated at 350 for 1 hour. Being short on time, I had sliced up the cooked potatoes with a pastry cutter instead of mashing them with a spoon. Next time I would use a potato masher on 1/2 of the potatoes and leave the remaining in bigger chunks.

Terrific! I omitted the beans and curry leaves and used half a red jalapeno but otherwise kept it the same. Next time I will use half the oil and no chili powder though. I think I'll make it again for thanksgiving...
