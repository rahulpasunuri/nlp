I got this recipe for the caramel sauce which is horrible. It Isn't the right consistency or color. Plus it smells weird. Waste.

I made this for the 3rd time tonight and have another suggestion about how to get the apples to cook better as I've never had a problem: 1) Slice the apples thin enough so they have a chance to cook, but still have form. 2) After slicing, place apples in a bowl with the lemon juice and gently roll the juice onto each slice. (If you wait until you assemble, they may turn brown.) 3) I used a quart sized mason jar to press out my circles of puff pastry. When it came time to add apple, I did NOT use 25 slices. I only used about 3 criss-crossing layers of apple. Apples cooked well and served each person 2 "galettes" which was plenty.

Thanks to reviewers below, I too, added more almond paste. Rolled out a walnut-sized amount, then flattened it with a cup. The apples were brushed with butter before baking. The apples did get brown on edges, as well as pastry. My apples were totally cooked through, but not smooshy. Maybe the key to getting your apples cooked is how thin you slice them. (I used one of those apple-corer-peeler-slicer tools.) Combined with caramel sauce was simply amazing. I think granny smiths really give it a tart, tart flavor - very refreshing...but will try honeycrisp next time to make it a bit sweeter.

This just didn't do it for me. I had to bake it for 30 minutes and still had to brush it with butter to get any color on the apples. And, yes, I checked my oven for temperature correctness. Too many great apple desserts out there to mess with this. This was just okay.

If you are looking for an easy dessert, this is it! I used more almond paste like others recommended and kept them in the fridge until I was ready to cook them. I think I used to much almond paste, so I'll have to find that balance. Also, I think I will saute the apples a little first next time.

This was so easy and surprisingly delicious. I also had to let it cook longer - and in fact brushed some melted butter over the apple slices half-way through the cooking in order to better acheive the browning. The richness of the almond paste contrasted so well with the tartness of the apples and then the unctuous caramel sauce!! Heavenly.

This Galette was delicious but I made the following alterations. I found that one puff pastry package only made 6-8. I almost doubled the almond paste as one previous reviewer wrote, about the amount of a whole walnut or 3/4 oz. This amount rolls out nicely to fit the pastry round. I added an additional 1/2-1 tsp. of sugar to each galette as my apples were really tart. These were prepared 4 hours in advance, covered and refrigerated until ready to bake. I found that they needed more time in my gas oven. I did NOT use convection bake. They were in at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then 375 for 15-20. Mine were a little more browned than the photo but I think those look a little under cooked. The caramel sauce can be done ahead as well. I kept it slightly covered on the stove on a simmer plate over the burner which I turned on and off when needed.

VERY easy recipe. Great for a dinner party, as I had them all set to go on a cookie sheet in the fridge, and put them in the oven as we sat down to dinner. Fresh hot apple tarts for dessert! Guests loved them, and they looked beautiful. I put a tad more almond paste (about a walnut sized ball, flattened), and actually did not put on quite so many apples. I also added some spices to the sugar. These were great, and not too sweet, and not too rich after a filling dinner.

This is very similar to my recipe for apple marzipan galettes, which comes out great. However, for a healthier version I posted a new recipe I tried with a wheat crust and natural sweetener rather than sugar which is just as delicious: http://naturalchefshoshana.blogspot.com/2009/05/galette-recipe-1-blueberry-mini.html I'd like to combine the two recipes best elements next time... use almond paste but no sugar with wheat crust, etc...

I used a 9 inch square of puff pastry (one half of a 1 lb. box), thawed and unrolled, and didn't bother cutting into individual servings. I made my own almond paste, but it was a bit runny so after brushing on the egg yolk, I spread on the almond paste and then put the baking sheet in the freezer to firm up the tart before continuing. I cut the baked galette into squares to serve. Delicious!

Excellent recipe and very simple! My guests raved about how wonderful this dessert was.

Made these for a Christmas Eve dinner party. They were a huge hit. I like that they are not too sweet. Served with the caramel sauce and freshly whipped cream. Everyone raved! The almond paste adds a wonderful dimension to the flavor and texture. This will be a regular on our table.

Before making this dish I had two reservations. I thought it may be too sweet, and also wondered whether the flavours might be confused. Not so, it was delicious!! I made my own almond paste, which added a wonderful chewy, nutty, depth to the galette. I didnt make the almond paste too sweet - for 1 cup of almonds I added 2 tablespoons confectioners sugar, and one egg white. Perfect. I made this a few hours ahead and kept it in the fridge. This made it easy for my dinner party. I had invited guests with discerning and experienced taste, who give complements only when well deserved. They thought this was wonderful!

This was an absolute hit. I can't wait to make it again. I was cooking a huge meal and forgot to peel the apples but it still turned out tender and delicious. I made them 4 hours before I baked them and kept them refrigerated. They were marvelous!
