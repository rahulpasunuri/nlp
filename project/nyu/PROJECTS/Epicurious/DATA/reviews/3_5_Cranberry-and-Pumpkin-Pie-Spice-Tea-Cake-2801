This was a real disappointment. I was enticed by the good reviews. I followed a user's reccomendation and added the pumpkin to replace some of the butter. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Mine came out more like bar cookies. Probably would not make this again.

This is a very good tea cake recipe. I like the combination of the fresh and dried cranberries. Even though you can't taste the pumpkin pie spice, it was excellent. I brought this to a meeting and it got rave reviews. I will make this again during the holidays.

Wonderful cake! I brought it to a dinner party and it had great reviews. It has a "short bread" and sweet cranberry taste with a cake consistency. It is perfect for the holidays. I will be making it for thanksgiving!

Have not made this cake yet, but based on my assessment of the recipe and the comments, I think it sounds great. People mention the amount of butter---has anyone noticed that 1 1/2 cups of butter is 3 (full) sticks, not 2 1/2 sticks?!

This recipe is way under rated. I made it exactly as presented--shocking amount of butter and all--for a Christmas season birthday party for an employee. It was a huge hit and was fairly easy to make. She had requested crepes as the entree. I served the Chicken, muchroom and aspargus crepes found here on Epicurious, a salad, some store bought rolls and this dessert. It was a perfect Christmas lunch menu. If you have a Christmas party to go to and want to bring a dessert, this is an excellent choice!

The amount of butter called for was shocking. However, I substituted 1/2 the butter (3/4 c.) with 3/4 c. of canned pumpkin. Turned out wonderful. Everyone enhaled it!!

When cool, add a THIN layer of cream cheese icing. Make a decorated Christmas tree using glazed fruit, etc. for the centre. A delightful make ahead treat for your [Boxing Day] party.
