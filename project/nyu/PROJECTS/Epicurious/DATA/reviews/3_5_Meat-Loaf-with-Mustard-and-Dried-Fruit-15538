tasted great, easy, had everything on hand. The idea to do small loaves is so smart and quick. I agree -- tomato and garlic with buttermilk is our usual, but a change is nice. We had it with dried apricots and cranberries and lemon preserves on top. Great weeknight food.

I have to say i was not impressed. I was looking forward to it it because all the good reviews, and it's a little different. Needed something more to it.

I may become a meatloaf convert after this.

The glaze was quite nice. I liked how it wasn't the "traditional" ketchup meatloaf glaze. However, next time, I will make it WITHOUT the fruit mixed in with the meat. It really was strange.

My friends laughed when I said I was making meat loaf... now they won't stop asking for it! This was sooooo good.

This meat loaf was quick and delicious. Due to ingredients on hand, I substituted meat loaf combo (veal, pork, beef), and dried cherries (chopped in food processor with the shallots) and dried blueberries. Because of the pork in my mix, I baked it to 185 degrees. I used peach spread for glaze mixed with Dijon mustard with horseradish. I will definitely make this again. A wonderful change from the usual ketchup'd meat loaf!

Just want to add my two cents. I have always enjoyed a good meatloaf and this is one of my favorites. I usually follow the recipe with one exception. A few times I have subsituted the Apricot preserves with some homemade peach jam that my mother makes. Other than that, this recipe is dead on.

Very fast and surprisingly delicious for meatloaf. Not the greasy falling apart meatloaf w/ketchup that I remembered. Feed it w/confidence to meatloaf sceptics!

Me and my extremely beautiful girlfriend made this meatloaf one night and it was by far the best meatloaf I've ever had. We did, of course, make a few alterations. We added some sausage and used diced fresh apples instead of dried fruit. We had a little more than would fit in the dish we cooked it in, so we made a couple of burger-like patties out of it and baked it on a sheet next to the loaf (they took a lot less time to cook, of course). The mustard/apricot preserve topping was amazing (especially on the patties, where it was much more prevalent) and we've begun using it on other meat as well.

Delicious and easy. I forgot about it and left it in the oven about an hour too long and while the outside burned, the center was still moist!! Imagine how good it could have been had I cooked it an hour less!

I just made this for the second time last, and wondered why I'd waited so long. This is delicious and different meatloaf, and I love how quickly it cooks when done in individual loaves. I used dried cherry and cranberry as the fruits, since that's what I had on hand, and it really gave a nice sweet taste to contrast with the spicy mustard-preserve glaze. YUM! Easy and so good!

I used onions instead of shallots (because I was out of shallots!), but otherwise followed this recipe exactly, and we just loved it. This is going to be our new meatloaf recipe.

I use currants instead of the dried fruit because they are smaller. You still get the flavor just not the chunks of dried fruit that instill fear in many people when combined with meat.

This recipe was surprisingly good. I used 2 small slices of sweet Italian bread, cubed --since I didn't have any breadcrumbs handy. For the fruit, I only used dry apricots. I accidentally mixed in orange marmalade in with my last tablespoon of Dijon mustard but it still turned out great! I think the preserves mixture on top of the loaves made this recipe tasty. Not only did it taste good, it gave it a nice golden glossy look.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf. We accidentally added the preserves to the meat mix, and then again as the topping, and it turned out very well. The meatloaf was very moist and flavorful, and I am interested in trying this recipe with different flavors of mustards. Will definitely make this again.

This was really great. Very juicy and tasty. I'd make it again any time. I used equal parts dried apricots, pears, and peaches.

I have made this dish several times. The only change I have made is instead of using shallots I use finely sliced green onions. What I like about this dish is that it not only tastes great, it is easy to make and flavorful. I am not a great fan of meatloaf, but I consider this dish to be the exception. I only wish my mom had had this recipe when I was a child! I didn't like her meatloaf very much!

Well, I normally do not eat meatloaf but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try since my husband does like meatloaf. I didn't exactly follow the recipe but the result was very tasty. In fact, my husband loved it. I used poultry seasoning since I didn't have any dried sage and I used peach preserves instead of apricot. I will definatly use this for meatfoaf in the future!!

A complete "bust" with the family! I think this recipe needs to go back to the test kitchen.

Moist and flavorful. The addition of the dried fruit (I use only apricots) along with the jam or maramalade topping is delicious.

This is very good. Not very beautiful to look at, but worth making.
