This recipe is so simple and yet imparts a very distinctive flavor. Try it and you'll find it can be a very easy weeknight meal.

Made this dish and it was good but I think I'd put less soy sauce next time.

This dish is excellent. Prepare it the night before, lessen the bay leaf and serve it with steamed jasmine rice and roasted string beans w/almonds. Delicious!!!!!!

The bold flavor of this dish packs lots of flavor into otherwise rather bland cornish hens. addition. It is important to either use imported bay leaves in this, or to cut the number from 3 to 1 for California bay leaves.

Have made this many times, using either cornish hens or chicken pieces. My husband and I both love it. The rice is a must for absorbing all of that sauce, which would otherwise be overpowering.

I have made this recipe several times, and I seem to go back to it whenever I'm not sure what to do with cornish hens. It's quick, easy and delicious-a real keeper!

I was just browsing through the recipes when I came across this one. I didn't actually make it but I do have a comment. I am first generation filipina and I have never seen oregano for an adobo recipe. I may have it give it a try sometime!

My husband liked the recipe better than I did. He would probably rate it three forks. The soy sauce flavor was too overpowering. This was helped by the rice. Still, I don't think that it is worth making again.

I have made this recipe a number of times using both cut-up chicken and cornish game hens. It's easy and delicious!

This dish is made using the "classic" ingredients for adobo style poultry. The same marinade/cooking ingredients can be used to make CHICKEN ADOBO. Baking the chicken vs. frying after cooking in liquid resulted in no discernable difference in flavor and is a real time-saver when preparing a larger number of servings. Sprinkling the chicken with paprika and serving with sliced spring onions adds some color and interest.
