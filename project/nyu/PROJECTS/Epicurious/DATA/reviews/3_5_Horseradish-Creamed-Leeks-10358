I've made this a number of times and always loved the results. It's become a mainstay of our Thanksgiving menu. The only adjustment I make is to slice the leeks crosswise if they're a bit older, so that they're in bite-size pieces. This avoids the stringy issue. Those of you who mess around with odd substitutions for the cream and the cheese, and then aren't happy with the results, what part of the recipe are you actually following?

Would definitely make this again but will likely skip the grated cheese at the end to let the leeks shine through more.

Delicious! I made with parmigianna-reggiano because I couldn't find gruyere at my little local market, and also threw in some mushroooms. I had half the leeks sliced and half sliced in half lengthwise because I originally had intended them for a different use. I thought it would go well w/ steak due to the horseradish, but next time will serve w/poultry -- I think the sweetness of the leeks would be very good w/chicken.

I'd never eaten leeks before; this is a great recipe and easy to prepare. I soaked the leeks overnight, and it seemed to work well. I substituted Romano and a little Mozzarella for the Gruyere, and added a little splash of Texas Pete before broiling, and it was terrific. I also suggest adding a little Jack Daniels to the simmering leeks, as it adds a wonderful depth of flavor. The alcohol cooks off, of course!

Made this last night for the wife. She loved it, I used sour cream instead of cream and a different cheese (forget which one). It was great and very easy to prepare.

This is a great recipe. Although it does take some time to cook, it's very easy to put together, and there's not much active time.

Absolutely fabulous! I weight watcher-ized this recipe by using 2/3 cup whey in place of cream and adding 2 tablespoons creme fraiche. I also used 2 teaspoons fresh horseradish and skipped the cheese. The cream brings out a wonderful sweetness in the leeks and the horseradish adds a subtle bite. ************ I just have to add that in the months since I first reviewed this recipe it has become a regular in our household. I buy normal sized leeks and chop them into 1 inch thick pieces. I fry them in butter and add whatever broth and milk product I have on hand. I simmer them in the frying pan for 20 mins. Adding cheese is optional. Lots of different types work. I usually melt the cheese into the sauce unless serving at a dinner party where it's worthwhile to transfer the whole thing to a casserole dish and melt the cheese on top in the microwave. This is a keeper! Are leeks really as expensive in the States as the one reviewer said? I buy them at 75 cents a pound in Austria.

This recipe sounded good, but having read the previous reviews, I studied the recipe in more detail. Several things struck me as odd!. It should have been made clear that only yopung ,small leeks should be used. My one leek was enough for the dish. I simmered the leeks for approx 35mins, with the lid on!! and only after I had drained the leeks did I add the Creme Fraiche. This prevented the sauce from curdling. A very generous sprinkling of Parmasam and Spanish Manchaga(The only cheese I had) to add more oommff, did little to improve the dish. Shame really because I love both leeks and Horseradish.

I made this dish with vegetable broth and served it over roasted garlic mashed potatoes for a vegetarian dinner guest. I agree with the other reviewers that the flavor was lovely and rich. My only problem is that the leeks became very stringy and visually unappealing. I also used fat free half&half based on another reviewers success, but found that it "broke" and became curdled. I saved it at the last minute by adding cornstartch and milk, wisking until it was somewhat creamy. With the cost of leeks (nearly $6.00 for this recipe) it just didn't seem worth the price or the effort of cleaning them.

Fantastic. Like an earlier reviewer, I also had sort of tough leeks and will use more delicate ones next time. But this is absolutely fabulous.

Wow! VERY rich but delicious. Served it with grilled flank steak, portobello mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes. Not the most elegant of presentations, but great flavor!

I used fat free half & half in place of the heavy cream and baked it for about 15 minutes longer that the recipe calls for. What a hit with my husband! His new favorite vegetable.....LEEKS!

Used gouda cheese instead. This dish was fabulous! The chicken broth gives it so much flavor

I loved this dish as well. I added more broth and cream.

Delicious flavor. I also needed more cream and broth in the cooking. The leeks were a little tough - next time I am going to use smaller, younger leeks equal to a pound. Very easy to make.

Delicious! I also found I needed to add a bit more of both the broth and the cream in equal amounts.

Really yummy. Husband and I both loved it. Would be very good with Prime rib or grilled steaks.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. It was extremely easy, quick and delicious. I learned it may be neccessary to add more cream and broth while simmering the leeks as the sauce does tend to boil off a bit. Add both in equal amounts of course. The sauce and Gruyere add a full and rich flavor to the tender leeks. This recipe has quickly become one of my favorites and I love to prepare it for guests.
