Fantastico! These are requested often by friends. I usually don't repeat myself, but there might be a riot if these didn't appear occasionally. The flavor is an excellent alternative to the cloying tang of bbq sauce. These aren't for every palette, and I usually like to make a rack of traditional bbq alongside them. There is a tendency for them to dry out a little. I find that placing them close together on the tray and ensuring there is plenty of sauce surrounding them is key. Don't let the sauce boil off...it's delicious and will be highly sought after for drizzling on the finished ribs.

These are absolutely delicious! And I even skipped the step to marinate the ribs overnight! You could make this recipe using any kind of sauce, i.e. your favorite BBQ, ut love the authentc Thai flavors.

Thought this was fantastic. We cut down on the salt a bit, used a braising method, and finished the ribs on the grill to add some texture. Also, you can buy lemongrass at any Asian market or buy preserved lemongrass at any grocery store.

We loved these...I used backribs and we also loved the cilantro rice that went with it. I chopped the ginger for more flavor in the rice...if you add the fresh herbs of cilantro and green onions right before serving, there is plenty of flavor to the rice. Delicious meal.

Delicious! EVERYONE loved them! Used pork short ribs instead. I've made these twice. The first time, I did the recipe exactly and the ribs didn't brown as much as I would have liked. But they were still very edible. The second time, I didn't spoon the marinade from bag onto ribs and just used to baste. Much better! A definite keeper!

These were really good! Did not require nearly the 1.5 hours on the 2nd cooking to get to very tender so keep on eye on them.

These turned out great. I used 4 lbs of pork spareribs, and reserved some of the marinade for the last 30 minutes of cooking, which resulted in plenty of extra sauce. I also had to substitute the lemongrass for lemon zest, but the ribs came out delicious and tender. I will definitely make them again. The cilantro rice recipe also featured in the magazine wasn't the best, but with the extra sauce from the ribs it was pretty tasty.

Marinating the ribs and then cooking them made the texture of the ribs rather dry. There are easier and tastier rib recipes. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

The ribs were tender and I'll definitely use this cooking method again. However, my husband and I found the flavor too salty. We will not be these again.

These ribs were absolutely delicious. My youngest hates ribs normally and ate a lot of these. We could not believe how tender and full of flavor these were. I used pork ribs instead of beef ribs and were delicious.

I brought these to the Superbowl Party last weekend. I read the reviews and took them to heart so I took some precautions. I didnt want to ruin my sheet pans so I greased them with shortening, covered them really well with heavy duty aluminum foil and then sprayed it lightly with cooking spray. The shortening was a little overkill but I did that in case some of the juice got under the foil and was hoping that it would keep it from sticking. It worked great. Also, in the final cooking stage, I only cooked them for 1 hour and then baked them the final half hour at the party so they were hot and fresh. I didnt put the marinade in the pan when I baked them initially and spooned the remaining marinade onto the ribs every 15 minutes. They were excellent!

These turned out pretty good and were fairly easy to prepare however, as one reviewer stated, my marinade dried up and burned during the braising and I was left with very little basting and no sauce what so ever. The ribs were a bit dry after the 1 1/2 hours of baking. I loved the flavor and will try these again but maybe baste more frequently and add water as needed

I was hoping for amazing but must settle for good. The meat was very tender without being mushy but I was a bit underwhelmed by the flavor. With all the wonderful ingredients in the sauce I was expecting something more. Due to all the time involved and a special stop for lemongrass, I don't think I will make this again.

The marinade is delicious, and the ribs had just the right texture. Most of the ingredients aren't too hard to find. One thing: maybe I misread the recipe but I put all the sauce into the pan and braised it. Dried it up somewhat and I didn't have any "extra" by the end of the cooking. I would just leave the sauce in a bowl and add it as you need for braising.

Once I saw the picture of these ribs in the magazine, I had to try them. I made them for Superbowl Sunday and they tasted fine, but in no way resembled the sticky looking deliciousness of the picture. The prep was fairly easy if you were prepared, the marinade was easy, but very thin-so I knew something was up. I basted ribs several times while cooking, and it did finally end up with a nice sort of caramelized crust, just not what I was expecting. Everyone said they tasted very good-don't think I will try them again.

This recipe is excellent! I made it as written with the expection of subing sriracha hot souce for the peanut sauce. I agree with the cook from LA. This recipe is off the cuff awesome

These ribs were absolutely revolting. The marinade smelled terrific, but seemed to have acted as a powerful tenderizer, causing the meat to fall apart into flakes. There were meat flakes everywhere in the marinade. And then the finished ribs were flaky, almost mushy, had no discernible grain, and offered no resistance at all. Yuck. The rice was utterly average, and the rice:liquid ratio was way off (fortunately I knew this before making it). The correct ratio should be 1 part rice to 1 1/2 parts liquid. American recipes usually call for too much liquid. Well anyway, now I know.

WHAT A HIT! This recipe is off-the-cuff awesome. I made the recipe as-written, and what a fantastic dish. TASTE: This was one of the biggest hits ever from my dinner parties. From the way the ribs are cooked to the ingredients in the marinade...they all came together for a harmonious, succulent entree. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, and were quite easy to eat with a fork and knife without making a mess. I served with the recommended cilantro sesame rice...a perfect pairing. It should be noted that the marinade is very well-balanced. A benefit of the pre-braising is that you can roast with the leftover marinade and then use it as a sauce. It tastes distinctly Thai, but none of the flavors are overwhelming. That is, no one said "this coconut sauce is great," they all exclaimed "WOW! What is in this awesome sauce!?" EASE OF PREP: Not bad! Cooking these twice resulted in some extra dishes, but it was worth it. To reply to "A Cook," who made these wrong - the cleanup is quite easy if you follow the directions. On the second cooking, I first sprayed my pans with cooking spray lightly, then made sure to place the ribs DIRECTLY on my aluminum sheet before basting them in ample marinade. That night when I went to clean the pans, the residue rolled off with one brush of the sponge. The other reviewer seems to have burned their marinade between two layers of metal...the cost of being a lazy cook, I guess. All in all, if you want to amaze and wow your friends and family, try this great recipe. My guests commented that they felt they were in a fancy restaurant, and I'd have to agree this dish is of that caliber.

Im writing this while my baking sheet is soaking in boiling water. What a mess. Although I covered the sheet in aluminum foil, the marinade leaked underneath the foil and burned the pan black. Also, the recipes required too much cooking time. After the ribs were braised for an hour, they were plenty tender. After another 1 ½ hours in the oven, the ribs fell apart when picked up with tongs. IN summary, considering the 40 minutes prep time, 24 hours marinating and 15 minutes scrubbing the baking sheet, the taste isn't worth it.

Didn't have time to cook ribs first, so I marinated it for several hours and then cooked it in the marinade @ 325 for about 2 hrs - still came out good and yummy; I made coconunt rice to go with it.
