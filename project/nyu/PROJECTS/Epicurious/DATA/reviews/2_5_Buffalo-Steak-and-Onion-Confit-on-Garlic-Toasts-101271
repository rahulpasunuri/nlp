This is the first poor review I have ever given a dish here at Epicurious. Usually I love their recipes, but this one just didn't work for me. I love all the ingredients and on paper it sounds great, but in practice, the star anise clashed with the balsamic. The end result was too acidic for me. I wound up adding a bunch of honey and still don't care for it.

Excellent dish for my first time preparing/eating buffalo! I made a few adjustments to avoid running back to the store - no star anise, but I put in just a pinch of ground allspice instead, and I served the meat and onions over a half of an english muffin with olive oil and rubbed with garlic since I didn't have bread. This dish, and buffalo, will defintely be making an appearance again!

Loved the confit - personally think buffalo is best when ground into hamburgers.
