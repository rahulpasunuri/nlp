Using roasted peppers made this easier and just as good. Didn't need to julienne(except for the garnish)or sauté them.

This makes a pretty special dish. I quadrupled the recipe and served eight. Didn't have time to forage for brin d'amour, so I used romano and added a pinch of rosemary, thyme and marjoram. Used three very large peppers and two cups of stock. In a word, this was fantastic.

This dish was OK...nothing spectacular. The sauce was WAY too strong. Would work only as an appetizer if you're going through the trouble of making them as it's too rich for a main dish.

I made this for a Valentine's Day Dinner Party. I made my own pasta and made it as a soup for the first course by not pureeing the peppers all the way and adding more chicken stock. The flavor was delicious but the brin d'amour cheese was abit lost with the strong flavor of the peppers. This is one I will serve again, everyone was very impressed.

I substituted parmesan for the brin d'amour--perhaps sacrilege to some--but the ravioli turned out wonderfully. I, too, skip the heart shapes and just do triangles by folding over square wonton wrappers. I usually end up with 20 ravioli or so. This is a great dish--though a bit labor intensive--it's one of my husband's favorites, and it's vegetarian-friendly, too!

I made this recipe 10 years ago when it first appeared in Gourmet Magazine. It was outstanding!! I misplaced the recipe and have been searching for it for years. I am so happy to finally have it again. It was so fabulous. I was actually able to impress my husband the French gourmet chef. Thanks

An attractive and delicious dish, even if somewhat labor intensive. The brin d'amour was a bit hard to find, and quite expensive, but the recipe only calls for a small amount, so I splurged. Mine wouldn't grate - too soft, but the filling worked out fine anyway. Easy sauce -used veggie instead of chicken broth, but the roasted pepper flavor and color were what really mattered. Used round wonton wrappers - also called gyoza skins, and skipped the heart shapes. Very important to seal the ravioli well once they're filled - I did a little pinching and rolling after I brushed edges w/water, and let them sit for 10-15 minutes. I was a bit concerned that they were watery or slimy looking when I first took them out of the boiling water, but letting them sit on a slotted spoon for a minute fixes that. Served a tuna tartare first course and it was a beautiful Valentine's Day dinner. Will do again for a special occasion.
