These are absolutely delicious! I used my food processor to mix the crust, but followed the recipe otherwise. As noted in the recipe they are best on the day that they are baked, but they are still darned good the next day, too.

I went blueberry picking and have quite a surplus, so I thought I would try these-- wow, so delicious! I didn't have blueberry preserves, so I made my own following another reviewers instructions, used 1 cup of the preserves and then made the filling as directed. So good!

Wow! These bars are foolproof! I made these b/c I had many ingredients "to use up." My blueberries were not sweet. I had leftover blueberry preserves that sat in the fridge too long. No fresh lemons, so subbed bottled juice & had no almonds but some chopped-up walnuts in the freezer. I forgot to add the rolled oats to the crust but threw in 2/3 cup of oats in the topping when I remembered. Even with all that nastiness & stupidity, these came out beautifully & very tasty. I can only imagine how amazing they'd be if I'd actually used "good" ingredients! :)

These are delicious! They make a great breakfast/brunch treat, but are also a wonderful desert. They make a great treat at picnics and bbq's during the hot summer months too. All around fantastic summer treat. I forgot to buy blueberry preserves but I had orange marmalade in the fridge so I used that. It actually tasted great. Planning on doing it "correctly" today.

The crumb mixture is delicious. I use pecans instead of almonds and also put them in the bottom mixture. Instead of using someone else's preserves, I use 4 C. fresh blueberries, 2T fresh lemon juice (because it brings out the flavor more, and zest is optional), and 1/2 C sugar. I cook the blueberries in a medium saucepan on low with the lemon juice. I mix the sugar and 1-2 T. flour (for thickening) together then add to cooking blueberries. Cook blueberries down for 10-15 minutes until bubbling hot. Follow directions for everything else.

I've made these bars as the recipe stated and also modified it, using sugar-free preserves and Splenda brown sugar. Everyone loves them and so easy to prepare.

I made this with half blueberries, half raspberries and pecans instead of almonds. Fabulous! I served it along with the Wild Blueberry Pie with Almond Crumb Topping from this site and most people passed up the pie to eat these crumb bars.

Super easy and very yummy. I didn't use the preserves and used 2/3 of the amount of sugar called for. The crust was nice and crunchy.

I never make substitutions the first time I make a recipe but this time I had to. I ran out of flour so I used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also had no almonds or any kind of nut in the house so I used a Kashi granola cereal in their place. I think it still turned out great. I had plenty of of crust and pleny of topping.

My coworkers raved about these and begged me to bring them in for breakfast again. Made it once with blueberries, then made a second batch with fresh blackberries and no preserves. Came out perfect!

Delicious. I used peach preserves, which I happened to have. My only complaint is, this is a lot of butter, so a very high-calorie treat.

GREAT!! Made them twice for parties and got loads of requests for the recipe.

Made these this morning, and they were great. Changed the recipe some seeing as I had 4 cups of homemade blueberry jam but no fresh blueberries. Didn't miss the fresh blueberries because the jam was really fresh tasting.

these were a HUGE hit! forgot to add the cinnamon (doh!) so gave a generous sprinkle over the top before baking and turned out totally fine. otherwise, prepared exactly as written. would do so again...

I had so many sweet Michigan blueberries that I decided to omit the jam and used an extra cup and a half of blueberries and about 3T of sugar. The sweetness was just right and the consistency was good too. I did think the crust got a little too dark, could be because of my dark pan. I will cook it for less time next time.

These were great, even my toddler loved them!

Very easy and good. Thought that the 1 cup of blueberry preserves made it a bit too sweet. Next time I would cut this amount.

Delicious! I used 2 cups fresh blueberries mixed with 1 cup fresh sliced strawberries and reduced sugar strawberry preserves for the filling. Pre baked crust for 15 min because I didn't want it to be too cruchy. After about 35 minutes of baking and 10 min. of cooling, I was able to cut the bars into nice squares and serve them warm with a scoop of cold vanilla frozen yogurt. Everyone loved them! I left out the almonds because I didn't have any on hand.... Didn't seem to matter, though I will probably buy some next time I go to the store so I can use them next time.

Although not mind-blowingly good, these bars are tasty, simple, and were well-received at a recent cook-out. Crisp on day 1; a bit soft and almost mushy a day later. Worth making again.

These bars were easy to make and delicious as well. The flavors were simple and not overdone. A perfect mid-summer treat! This recipe does make a lot, but they are good leftover. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These were so popular at our Saturday brunch. I followed the instructions, except I swapped for strawberry jam because that's what I had. So good.

These were very good.. took them to a party and they disappeared quickly. They also set up nicely as bars for me, and were easy to eat out of hand. Not sure why others had problems. I followed the recipe and I thought the flavor was good. But they were a tad too sweet for me, tho my husband didn't think so. Still, I will decrease the amount of preserves and increase the fresh berries next time, maybe add a little lemon juice to the filling. I don't think they needed more lemon zest or cinnamon.

Great recipe! I doubled the lemon zest as per a previous review but felt the lemon overpowered the blueberry flavor (still good but these ARE blueberry bars)...would stay with the recipe or just a little more next time. Other than that, great flavor and I had no problem with them setting up as bars.

I made these for a BBQ and everybody loved them. I added a dash more lemon than the recipe called for to give it a bit more zing :)

These were a great 4th of July treat. Only changes I made were to double the lemon zest and use blueberry preserves without added sugar. This kept the filling tasting fresh and not too sweet.

The bars did not set up and were more of a cobbler consistency. Delicious, though!

This was fantastic! Increase the amount of filling for lots of flavor, and don't skip the lemon; it really adds something special to the flavor. Definately up the cinnamon: it gets lost in the fruit. Tricky to eat as a bar, but great with a small dish of vanilla ice cream. Can't wait to make this again!!

I always line my pans for bar cookies; use the shiny side up and spray lightly with cooking spray. This method is essential if you are using jam or fruit in the bars, because the cooked jam will always stick the pan. Let the bars cool completely, and then pop them out of the pan and voila!

Based on the previous reviews, I made a few changes and was pleased with the results and would happily make this recipe again. I adapted the crust based on the Cooks Illustrated recipe for raspberry squares since it seemed similar and more plentiful (I made a recipe and a half). For the filling I used 4 cups blueberries (2 pints) and upped the flour to a heaping tablespoon and the lemon zest to 2 teaspoons. I also added a bit of allspice and a pinch of nutmeg. I used a blueberry preserves with no added sugar and they were not a bit too sweet. They proved a fitting dessert for a lobster feast!

I loved these, very easy to make and such bright flavor from the fresh blueberries. I would maybe add a dash more of the cinnimon and lemon zest. Also, I would make more of the crumb mixture for the topping, it was enough but I would prefer more, I will next time. I will also add more almonds.

Very good bars. I did change the filling - used a frozen berry mix (blue-, rasp- and blackberries) with preserves to match. The lemon zest in the filling is a must. The cinnamon flavour in the crust is v. subtle - if you like a stronger flavour def. add more. I thought the proportions of the top and bottom crumb were just fine. Do watch the crust closely when baking as it browns fast. I didn't think these were soggy at all, but I did keep them in the fridge and that firmed the filling and crust up quite a bit. Do agree with previous reviewers the filling was a tad sweet - will use reduced sugar preserves/jam next time. Baked the bars in a pyrex pan sprayed with cooking oil spray and they popped out nicely w/o sticking. Someone told me to grease pans for baking w/ oil instead of butter as butter burns at a lower temperature and may actually cause the baked goods to stick - not sure how much truth there's to that but the cooking oil spray works well for me. Will definitely make again. Have been looking for a fruit bar recipe for awhile and this is it. Really good warm w/ vanilla IC.

I absolutely loved these. I agree they are on the sweet side, but I don't have a problem with that! I thought the proportions for the crust (in terms of top versus bottom) were just fine. The bottom crust came out almost a little caramelized and held together perfectly fine (I was able to eat the square out of my hand), and the top crust was nice and crumbly. I will say, though, that the crust came quite close to sticking to the pan, even though I used a pan with a non-stick coating to which nothing has ever stuck before AND I coated it with butter first, too. So, do watch the initial baking of the bottom crust. When I make them again - and I will -I'll probably double the filling, because that's just the kind of person I am.

I made this for our Father's day dessert with some homemade ice cream. The whole family raved. I didn't have almonds so used pecans. I thought it was delicious!

These are good, but too sweet for my tastes. My 8 year old made them almost entirely by herself, so they definitely get easy points. The family really like them, but they weren't out of this world.

I made these with frozen blueberries and blackberry perserve because that is all I had. I thought that there was plenty of crust for the bottom and top. I thought they were better the day I baked them because they did get soggy by the next day. Keep them in the fridge if not eating right away. Great for the summer and all the ripe blueberries.

These blueberry bars were the perfect end to an early summer barbecue. Couple of notes: 1) I ended up serving larger squares of this in bowls with icecream because they didn't make very neat bars. 2) After I took out 2 cups of the crust mixture for the topping, I wasn't left with too much for the crust. I managed to fill the bottom of the pan, but had to watch it closely for burning. I pulled it out a couple minutes early, just in the nick of time. 3) I'm on Day 3 of eating these. The recipe says to eat them the day of, but I don't see any issue with baking them the night before and refrigerating them overnight.
