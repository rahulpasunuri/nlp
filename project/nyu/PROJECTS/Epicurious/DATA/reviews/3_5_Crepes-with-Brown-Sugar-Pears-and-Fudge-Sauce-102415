I was looking for a basic crepe recipe (I had my own fillings in mind) and this was a great one. I don't have any nonstick skillets, but it worked fine with a heavy stainless- steel skillet. Even the first one was edible!

Great basic crepe recipe... I had apples rather than pears. Skipped chocolate but added 1/4 cup of apple cider to the sauce and boiled it down to thicken. Served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Easy but out of the ordinary.

I made this with vanilla ice cream and toasted coconut. Next time I might just get coconut ice cream - it was a nice added level.

A really easy recipe. A great one to do ahead. My 16 year old niece and 15 year old nephew loved them. Brown sugar pears would be delicious as an ice cream topping if you didn't want to make the crepes.

So very yummy..you can even use canned pears and it turns out great. I made this for guests over the Holidays and everyone fought over the last few crepes! Highly recommend..

I used a food processor instead of a blender and did not chill the batter for an hour in the fridge. Instead I kept it there for 15 min and then returned it to the fridge between crepes. They turned out...perfect amt. for two people, six crepes. Also substituted soy and almond milk for milk. I filled 'em with "Brown Sugar Pears" (recipie also from epicurious) and almond paste...yum!

I was surprised that this didn't come out as good as I expected...lots of work, hard to eat, and not as much flavor as I expected. It was a nice change of pace but nothing spectacular according to my family and me.

I made this last night and everyone raved about it. I made the crepes the day before and also the sauce. The pears I made early in the afternoon and reheated. This is a keeper. Forget about the calories!

Prepared crepes the day before; the pears the morning of dinner and reheated. Chocolate sauce can be prepared several days ahead. Guests raved about this recipe. Worth every calorie!

We have tried this several times-- found bosc pears work the best. We also did it with bananas and pear and enjoyed it. You'll have lots of fudge sauce left over!
