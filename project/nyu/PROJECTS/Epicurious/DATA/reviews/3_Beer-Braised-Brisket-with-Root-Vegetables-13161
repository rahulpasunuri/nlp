I don't know where I messed up, but the final product was unbearably bitter. In fact, if anyone had any suggestions, I would love them. Anyways, the only solutions I made were as follows: forgot to get onions at the store, so I sauteed some garlic instead, and added a little onion powder. Then, at the sugestion of my fiancee, I used corn starch instead of flour. Those were the only changes made. The other possibility is the beer I used, Copper Hook from Red Hook. I thought the slight maltiness and nice hopiness would balance the sweetness of the onions and fat from the brisket. The only thing I can think of, is that the rutabaga is the culprit; I've never had it before, and the bitterness seemed to get worse when I ate a piece. Is there some special way to prepare rutabaga? Other than the bitterness, the meat was really good, both tender and moist, which is a tough balance. I think I'll make this at least a few more times, at least to figure out where I went wrong.

This was tasty & easy to prepare. I ran out of beer, and substituted a can of beef broth. Alas, no bacon either, which would have possibly moved my rating to 3 forks. Huge amount of veggies left over after meat was gone, but it made for great soup.

Beer-braised brisket browned brilliantly! Brined, braised, baked. Barry brought burritos, booze, became baked! Boy! Baked brown bread behind Blair's back. Begged Brigitte, brown-eyed, blond, bright...besmitten!

I have made this recipe numerous times since it was featured on Sarah Moulton's show last year and it has been a winner every time. It has a wonderful rich, well rounded flavor and using root vegetables offer the perfect accompaniment.

This had a wonderful down-home taste for me. Also quite easy to make. I substituted turnips for the rutabaga, just because that is what I had on hand. Serve with some green beans on the side, you really don't need the noodles.

Basic recipe - omit the jalapenos for a smoother taste.

I just prepared a recipe similar to this but I only used one i2oz can of beer and cooked it in a crock pot on low for 10 hours. It was extremely tasty as well as more than tender. Probably could have reduced the cooking time. And unless you par boil the veggies they all go in at one time atop the Brisket.

I just could not get this recipe to work. The prep time was too long and the results were just awful. This is the worst recipe I've found on this site and I cook from here daily! Maybe it's me but Iwould not recommend this to anyone.

This recipe is fabulous. It's very easy to make and it smells absolutely wonderful while it's braising in the oven. It's nice and hearty and delicious with a loaf of sourdough bread and some hearty red wine.
