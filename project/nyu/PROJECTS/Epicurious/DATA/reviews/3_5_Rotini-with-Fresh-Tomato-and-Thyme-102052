I saw this recipe in Gourmet magazine many years ago, and am still making it today. I love how simple it is, and that it is the perfect showcase for home grown tomatoes. I'm really surprised anyone thinks the garlic is too strong. It seems just right to me. I think the marinating step is very important - that seems to mellow the garlic and blend all the flavors. I usually either leave out the ricotta or make a vegan version with almonds, oil, lemon juice, salt and water blended to a ricotta-like consistency, then dollop that on top. So good!

I've made this several times now, and we love it. I agree with other user's 1/2 the garlic, and we use grape tomatoes. Every time I bring this somewhere I have to give away the recipie, and it is so simple.

Wonderful for a beastly hot summer night. I used only one clove of garlic (perfect) but the full amount of thyme. I, too, had to look up ricotta salata -- it's a firm cheese found in the cheese section -- different from the containers of ricotta found in the refrigerator section. The ricotta salata makes the recipe!!

I doubled this recipe and used medium pasta shells instead of rotini. The garlic:thyme ratio was just fine for me, but my husband thought the garlic was excessive. By the way, what is ricotta salata?

Average at best - too much raw garlic (reduce to one clove). I used fresh thyme from my garden, but felt that it lacked good flavor, so I tried rescuing this recipe by adding fresh basil, a pinch of sugar, and freshly ground pepper. It still just tasted like pasta, raw tomatoes with garlic overkill.

My husband thought there was too much thyme, but I loved the flavor. I used up some opened canned tomatoes and it was still good, although I can imagine fresh would be better.

Considering the ease of preparation it was a very good dish. The quantity of garlic it recommended was too much though.

A luscious recipe, full of summer flavours. I will definitely do this one again whenever top quality vine ripened tomatos and fresh thyme are available.However, the 1 1/2 tablespoons of thyme called for by the recipe seemed excessive so I used about half that amount. Lovely.
