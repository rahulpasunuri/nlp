Great summer salad option. The dressing is super easy and tasty. We substituted Gorgonzola (a really good one) for blue cheese due to personal preference. Next time we'll double the quantity of salad we grill because everyone wanted more!

I just made the grilled romaine and dressing, not the pickled onions, and it was fabulous. You can make it in a few minutes and takes just minutes on the grill. It was a huge hit with my dinner guests.

I loved the pickled onion/blue cheese dressing combo, went awsome together. Used 1 large red onion that measured about 1 lb and found it way to much for us, would use half a medium one next time.

Simple and delicious, started the 2012 grilling season with this, pared it with a marinated skirt steak. Excellent!

I make this all year round, using my grill pan on the stove when too cold to bbq. Although I make sure to use a good blue,or creamy gorgonzola, I change the dressing to fit my mood and the rest of the meal. Add some wilted radicchio, or grilled endive if you have onion averse company. Have fun with this - a GREAT dinner party first course.

Wow!! I just made this for my dad, and though he didn't read the previous review, he said "I'll tell you one thing... I'll have this again!!" Delicious! Don't let the fact that you are heating up lettuce scares you - if you like Artichokes, you'll love this! I had to subsitute red for vadalia onions, and thought I had dijon, but didn't, so I substituted horse raddish sauce. Will try as directed next time, b/c variety is the spice of life :)

This was simple to make and absolutely delicious. I made it per the directions. This will be repeated all summer.
