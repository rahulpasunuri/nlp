Not really impressed. After the other reviews, I was expecting something really wonderful and rich, which was not what I got. I bought fresh, good quality seafood from a local seafood market, cut down a little on the clam juice, and it came out quite fish all the same. The butternut squash flavor was totally overpowered by the fish and the fennel (which i also used less of then called for). My friends liked it (or pretended to), but I didn't even eat a whole bowl before throwing it out.

This recipe came out great - mostly because the broth itself tasted wonderfully - nice trick with the clam juice and saffron. I roasted the squash instead of steaming, so the stew also had that wonderful roasted squash smell. I served it with garlic toast to dip in the broth. What kind of clams are people using for this?

I made this dish several times and it's really good. However it more of a soup than a stew. I find that if you add the sherry and the wine 1st and reduce them a 1/2 a cup, you get the flavor minus the liquid. Also, omit the water and then you get more of a stew consistency. You can always add more liquid if desired. I use sea scallops and sea bass, it's great.

Very easy to make ahead. I substituted tilapia (1.5lbs), shrimp (1lb) and scallops (0.5lbs) for the specified seafood. I will also try adding an extra half-cup of water (but not tomatoes), so that I can cook the squash in the broth. Then, add the tomatoes to break down a bit. At that point, I can keep on the stove until about 35 minutes before dinner -- rewarm broth and add seafood.

Tripled the recipe to feed my latin-american in-laws on Christmas Eve. Made "stock" about a week ahead and froze. Really very easy once all the chopping and measuring is done. Substituted halibut for seabass. Had the fish department at Whole Foods cut the fish and scrub the clams so they were ready to go. (May try sea bass next time just to compare.) Everyone really enjoyed it. Tasted very much like something I've had at a latin-american restaurant. Will absolutely make again, particularly during these cold winter months.

This was delicious and very easy to prepare. I was skeptical about the butternut squash, but it worked very well in this dish. I ended up using cod for the fish, along with scallops and shrimp. I will definitely make this again soon.

I liked this, but I don't think its a dish beyond compare. I skipped the clams and used red snapper and shrimp, but otherwise stuck with the recipe. Aside from the squash, which is a pain, this is easy to put together. It would be nice for a dinner party because you can do pretty much everything ahead and then just add the seafood at the last minute. I think if I made this again I might use Pernod in place of the sherry, and fennel seeds instead of the saffron. Very different flavors, but I think it would be nice that way too.

This stew is incredible! I've made it for two dinner parties and everyone is amazed. I used shrimp, scallops and fish and it turns out great. I recommend serving it with a rosemary (or other herb) baguette, and it's even better!

A fabulous, well-received dinner party main course. You can make the stock ahead of time, then reheat briefly before the point of adding clams (then requires only about 8 minutes of absence from your guests.) I substituted halibut for the overfished seabass and it was excellent. This dish is very forgiving of inexact measurements, as is my tendency.

Very easy, tasty, pretty and fairly healthy. The Bass is pricey, but best because it gives such a smooth buttery flavor. I also like this recipe because you don't have to measure every thing exactly and substitutions are ok.

My friend served this over the weekend at a dinner party and it was fantastic. She told me that she got the recipe on epicurious so I wanted to check it out. I will definitely try this one myself.

This recipe was easy to make and simply delicious. I substituted the sea bass with a combination of monkfish, halibut and tilapia. A good Rioja was the perfect choice to serve with it. I will make this dish again.

I love this stew. I first made it with the whole Spanish menu presented in the magazine, and it really stood out. I often leave out the fennel bulb without much difference. Since sea bass is overfished (and therefore my grocery won't carry it), I have tried several substitutes. Red snapper and halibut were fine, but Alaskan sable is the best, although harder to get consistently.

This stew is deceptively easy and consistently delicious. We have made it several times and will definitely make it again.
