I used to use over-ripe bananas strictly for banana bread, but I wanted something that was more of a dessert so searched for "banana desserts" & found this recipe. Sooooooo glad I found it! Now every time I have bananas that don't get eaten, instead of banana bread I make this cake. It is absolutely delicious! I eat it for breakfast with my coffee--the perfect combo!

Really enjoyed this recipe! Very simple and delicious. I brought it to a party, and it was devoured quickly. I couldn't find the canned coconut cream for the icing, so I just made it without.

Good for using up leftover bananas- needs something-maybe walnuts?

The cake turned out wonderful. I pureed the bananas with a hand blender and I think that contributed to the finer, cake-like texture. I may have used too much banana, as the cake sank slightly. I think you could get away with 1 cup of banana but no more. Frosted with some leftover bittersweet ganache.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the frosting needed an extra tablespoon of coconut cream (for my taste, anyway). I loved the frosting, as I hate cloying overly sweet ones. This was perfect. The cake itself I had to cook about 7 minutes longer than called for. Usually my oven is spot on, so that was odd. However, it came out moist, delicious, and I received many compliments on it.

This cake was very tasty. I ate over half of it myself! This recipe is great, because it made such a small cake. I will make this cake again very soon!

I have made this cake twice and LOVE it. I don't typically care for frosting, but this one is so good just as it is. I made the cake again today using coconut rum in the icing. Delicious!

This was just what I wanted - a moist old fashioned banana cake to make use of some over-ripe bananas. I cooked it in a 9 inch square pan, to contribute to the 1950's spirit of the thing, and used left-over chocolate ganache to frost it instead of the coconut. It was great.

Easy, delicious, simple but flavorful. Substitute any good cream cheese or nut frosting, and it still comes out great. To keithca in L.A. - "good if you like bananas and coconut" - why would you make a cake called banana cake with coconut frosting if you didn't like bananas and coconut!

I made this without the frosting, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 cup each of coconut and chocolate chips. Took out of the oven when there were just a few crumbs attached to the toothpick and it was very moist. Tastes great!

Absolutely delicious! I used 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and an extra tbs of coconut cream with 1/4tsp coconut extract - very moist and sweet.

I've made this twice in one week for different occasions and both my friends and coworkers loved this cake. Very simple to make. I used light cream cheese and light sour cream.

I thought this was a great cake, and not only because it was sinfully easy. As the original magazine recipe said, it's good enough for company but can be prepared for the oven within 10 minutes for any anytime occasion. I baked it in an 8" square pan because I thought the squares would cut more neatly than slices from a round pan, and they did. It took a bit longer to bake, another 10-12 minutes or so. Test it so it won't overbake. I often add a tsp or so of all-natural banana flavoring to my baked goods that contain bananas because I really like a noticeable banana flavor which I don't always get, even with overripe bananas. So maybe that's why I thought the banana flavor in the finished cake was great. I took advice below and used 1/2 cup powdered sugar in the frosting recipe, and the consistency was smooth and easy to spread, even after it had been refrigerated, but it wasn't runny. I toasted the coconut garnish (microwave, 90-120 seconds, but watch it carefully--it can go from toasted to burned within a couple of seconds) because I prefer the texture and flavor of toasted coconut. It also adds some color to the white frosting. I got lots of compliments on this cake, and there were other desserts to choose from.

I had a small taste of this cake bec. my husband and guest DEVOURED it. I thought the cake was average but the frosting was great. I followed the recipe as written, but used coconut rum. I will make it again once all the bananas in my kitchen get nice and ugly

Very nice and easy cake if you like banana and coconut. I used a bit more coconut creme and sugar in the frosting because it was not sweet enough at first.

Need one more TBS of cream of coconut and 1 more TBS of confectioners' sugar - frosting was too sour from the cream cheese, not sweet enough nor enough coconut flavor

I enjoyed this cake. It was a bit dry even though I used more banana than called for. I didn't use the shredded coconut on top, but the cream cheese and coconut cream frosting was pleasantly different. I used a little more confectioners sugar (1/2c rather than 1/3c), but the frosting was still nice and light... not overly sweet like most frostings. The cake was good for breakfast. Next time I'll try incorporating some flax seed meal and some walnuts.

This was an okay cake, but nothing special. Didn't especially like the banana and coconut mixture.

I've made this easy, quick recipe twice now and it has been perfect both times. The cake is moist, soft, and has a wonderfully balanced flavor. I baked the batter as muffins (it makes a dozen) and left off the frosting.

Very nice and light dessert. Great for holidays.

great recipe with a nice variation on the typical frosting. i actually made the cake for breakfast, substituting a combination of white and whole wheat flour, oats, and flax seed meal for the white flour. i also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup. it was quite tasty!

I made this for someone in my family who loves bananna. He could not say enough about this cake. Loved it that much.
