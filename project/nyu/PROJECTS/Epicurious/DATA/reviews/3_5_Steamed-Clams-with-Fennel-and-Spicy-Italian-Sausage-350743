This was wonderful. I made it on a worknight and was able to have it on the table in under a hour. I am Italian so I love food that looks as beautiful as it tastes, and this was a sight to behold. All those clams nestled atop a glorious heap of linguine! My heritage forced me to add liberal amounts of crushed red pepper(of course) and to double the white wine. Make it and love it.

This was a terrifically simple, highly flavorful recipe. I used a full cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of water to create a bit more broth. Fresh oregano was key. The sausage and fennel seeds added great flavor. I used fresh clams from Tomales Bay, CA which were wonderful and served it all over pasta. Easy enough for weeknights and impressive enough for guests!

Used Chorizo and followed recipe exactly - DELISH. Would perhaps drain tomatoes next time so the top note would be of the clam flavor... But serve with a salad on the side and some great bread and wine..it's easy, inexpensive and taste to die for!

I only used 1 pound of clams since I was cooking for two, but I kept all other ingredients the same, with the addition of 4 cloves of chopped garlic, linguine, and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan. It was quite simple but very tasty. I'm sure the dish would still be good with dried oregano, but with fresh oregano it was heavenly.

Really easy and fast and remarkably yummy. I used mild rather than spicy italian sausage (dietary restrictions) and dried oregano (availability) and it still was delicious and complex. And, surprisingly, not at all expensive to make.

Was looking for something warm on a frigid Boston weeknight and this was perfect. As I did not have clams, I used shrimp which I put in at the very end. I also pan-seared chorizo instead of italian sausage, in which I subsequently cooked the onion. I served it with toasted sour-dough bread. Will use a 28 oz can of tomatoes next time as the sauce was great, but a bit skimpy. Delicious, quick and used ingredients I had on hand.

I made this last night for my husband and our friend and we all loved it. I followed the recipe exactly (served over pasta) and the only thing I would add is bread to sop up the juices. It's easy, pretty and very tasty.

This was ok for a quick meal, and the fennel works well with the spices in hot sausage, but I'm not sure it would be the right dish for company.
