I used very ripe Hachiya persimmons and the texture of the sorbet was slimy. So I tried a different way - juicing Fuyu persimmons and using the juice instead of pulp. The texture was good but the persimmon flavor is so delicate, the sorbet tasted like frozen sugar water. The best result I had was when I made a combination of citrus (lemon and clementine) and persimmon sorbet. It was really good, flavor and texture, but the citrus flavor really overpowered the persimmon - we really couldn't taste it and I think plain citrus sorbet would have been just as good (though wouldn't have been as beautifully orange).

I agree with the first reviewer. The flavor was fair, but despite using very ripe Hachiya persimmons and peeling completely, the texture was terrible. I tasted the fruit before using in the recipe and they were perfect--unfortunately the sorbet is almost inedible, wasting great fruit.

I did exactly what the recipe said...the sorbet was naturally delicious..the persimons must be ripe and remember Hychia Persimons are the ones you will want to use!

The texture of this just wasn't good, and the added sugar sort of defeated that nice sour flavor of the Fuyus.

This was pretty bland. I needed to get rid of my very ripe Fuyu persimmons, but this hid the ripe flavor. Too much effort for nothing much.

The recipe sounded good, looked good, and I had persimmons to use up. But the taste wasn't bad, but the texture was terrible. It left our tounges feeling like they were coated with tar and had to be scraped off. I love persimmons but not this way!
