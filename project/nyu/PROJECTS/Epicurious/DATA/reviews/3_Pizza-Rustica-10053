and just what would you have me do with these little cubes of provolone? Maybe someone ought to actually READ and TRY these recipes before publishing them. This site is getting less and less professional every day.

Great meal, but time-consuming. I used pre-made flake pastry and roasted red peppers from a jar. Worked fine. Watch the water with the chard, as another reviewer pointed out.

If you haven't made this, please don't "review" this recipe. If it's not your (or your dad's or your grandma's) idea of pizza rustica, we don't need to know that. I want to know what you think of THIS recipe. I thought the filling was delicious but we didn't care for the crust. Would make again maybe using puff pastry.

Have made this several times to sensational reviews. Be sure to drain both the chard and the red peppers VERY well. A guaranteed success. The cuisinart helps to shorten prep time.

The pictures appeared in the magazine with the recipe. But I have pictures of my own "picture perfect" pizza rustica. And while it may be more American than Neopolitan - it is a great dish!

A very impressive dish. I made a day ahead, stashed in fridge, then baked before serving at room temp. Tasted wonderful.

We've made this several ways, including adding a layer of mushroom ravioli and spinach ravioli between layers of the Swiss Chard, Italian sausage, and pancetta. Yummy!

There is a step missing from the instructions! I had to search old reviews to discover what to do with the provolone. (It belongs just atop the prosciutto.) It took all day long and the crust recipe is hard to roll out well. But oh my gosh, it is beautiful when you are done.

This is a great recipe for a casual lunch or dinner for a crowd. Much work is entailed in the preparation of the ingredients, but the end result is beautiful! I try to do all the prep work the day before so that assembly is a snap on the day I'll be serving it.

This is one of my favorite dishes. It does take time to make but the effort is worth every taste sensation, not to mention it has a great presentation.

Excellent to make ahead for buffet, picnic or family meal. All you need is a salad.

Loved this recipe! Tastes good warm or cold. This is what I make for a special occasion.

This does not resemble my Neaploitan grandmother and moms' Pizza Rustica IN THE LEAST. Very untraditional. A much more traditional (and better) recipe can be found on www.foodtv.com.

After reading the reviews, I realized that while this was not a traditional recipe, I would still give it a try. I'm sorry I did. While the presentation was nice before cutting, it didn't hold together well after cutting and the flavor was dissappointing at best.

This recipe has become a "standard" in my repetior. It is fun to make, looks wonderful, and the combination of flavors is fantastic! The pizza has gotten rave reviews every time I made it. I can't wait to make it again for the holidays!

At first I was excited that such a rare Italian treat was offered, then I read the recipe, it does not at all resemble the meat and egg filled pie I was raised on. It tasted more like Quiche. There was black pepper in our dough and no garlic in the filling. ours had Many differnt cold cuts and over a dozen eggs.

I first made this dish for an Easter burnch. Everyone thought it was dessert, until it was cut. The layers were beautiful, and the taste was outstanding. Now I get requests to make it from friends and neighbors.

One of the best picnic dishes ever. Be sure to drain the chard extremely well (squeeze it out with your hands), and let the peppers drain in a colander, or you'll end up with liquid boiling out through the vents, molten lava style.

Absolutely nothing like the original version my grandmother would cook for Easter. You completely left out the ham and salami, and other assorted things that go into a traditional Italian Pizza Rustica.

I made this to take to an outdoor concert....it was easy to prepare, transported well, was beautiful and delicious. The only thing I would do differently is season the swiss chard better with more salt and pepper and maybe a bit of garlic. Will definately make again.

This is a wonderful, casually sophisticated dish. Great for an outdoor potluck. Part of the instructions from the magazine were deleted. In assembly the original recipes says to add the provolone after adding the prosciutto and before the remaining ricotta. I've also cut the recipe in half and filled a very small springform pan to feed just my husband and myself.

Outstanding recipe--a real attention getter when you bring to the table. Perfect for special casual occasions when "make ahead" is crucial. One note: instructons for adding the provolone cheese do not appear in the directions. I added with the prosciutto.
