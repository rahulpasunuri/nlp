I've been making this delicious soup for about 6 years, but with about half of a Rotisserie chicken, shredded (roughly 1-1.2 lbs) This eliminates the breading and frying of the chicken in the beginning of the recipe and also the 20 minute cook time of the chicken at the end of the recipe. Otherwise, I follow the recipe as written pretty much...sometimes I'll add fresh spinach at the end with the chicken, beans, etc. And because I live alone and usually cook just for one, I freeze the leftovers in individual portions to eat another night with a slice of garlic bread...super easy and always yummy.

Super delicious and easy!! I fried the chicken a couple of minutes longer on each side than recommended. Only had 1 can of beans so I added about a cup of frozen corn. It was wonderful. The only thing I'll do different next time is remove the chicken skin before adding it back into the pot.

Super good! Worth 3 1/2 forks! Next time I will make without the bone in the chicken...it's a little messy to eat. The family loves it - will definitely make again.

This has become a firm family favourite and my 12-year old asks me to make this all the time. Now, this is a child who until this recipe turned her nose up at anything to do with beans!

I thought this was good. I made it with white beans. Next time, I will remove the chicken skin/bones prior to cooking (or, at least before serving). It's too messy to eat and the skin gets wet/soggy.

Very satisfying! I used 4 boneless, skinless chic thighs and well trimmed bacon, poured off all fat. Then used a bit of olive oil. Added 1 celery and carrot died to onions and deglazed with wine . Used 28 oz of fire roasted diced tomatoes, added a a large pinch crushed red pepper, some chopped fresh spinach. Topped off with some parm reggiano for serving. Yummy. My husband love it too.

Delicious! I cooked the chicken thighs all the way through, removed the skin, shredded the meat and tossed it back into the soup. I added an extra can of beans, diced carrots & celery and it fed my family for days. Very hearty, and not surprisingly, soup tastes better the next day and the day after that.

I made this first with chicken, then decided it would probably be good vegetarian as well. I browned extra firm tofu (seasoned with salt and pepper), used vegetable broth, and sauteed using olive oil rather than bacon and bacon fat. Not quite as flavorful as the chicken version, but really, really good. I made a little roux and added it to the sauce toward the end to thicken.

Such a great quick stew. I used white wine rather than red, rosemary rather than basil. After it cooked, I removed the chicken and vegetables, then boiled the broth, added to it a mixture of wine and flour to create an amazing gravy.

So loved this recipe. Simple and hearty. Even my kids gobbled it up. I took someone else's advice and used a 28oz can of San Marzano whole tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. Served it over quinoa. Yum!!!

This is my favorite recipe from this site. It has been the basis of many permutations: the one I make most includes thyme and rosemary instead of basil, white wine instead of red, fire roasted diced tomatoes, roasted red peppers and chopped kale. Tried other beans but nothing beats cannellini. I make this stew in double and triple batches and it freezes beautifully. Great comfort food and very healthy.

My all-time favorite winter stew! I have been making this for several years now, and I just realized that it is February and I have yet to make it this year! So I've just invited a friend for dinner, and plan to serve her my favorite stew. Great with a salad, some good bread and a bottle of red.

I'm always looking for a good one-pot meal for weekend cooking. This one's a keeper, very hearty and "chickeny". Although next time I'll tweak it to make it healthier (my husband said he liked it but it was only worth making again if it was healthy, and I agree). As have many others I used boneless skinless thighs, which I browned nicely initially (WAY longer than 3 minutes per side) and shredded at the end of cooking. I'll health this up in future by trimming the fat from the thighs, the bacon adds the necessary fat to the dish. I had a large portion of leftover Rancho Gordo Good Mother Stallard Beans in the freezer which I used, along with some of the pot liquor. Canned beans are convenient, but "real" beans have so much more going for them. In fact I'll use more beans next time. Along with the basil I added some fresh baby spinach which I chopped. Next time I'll also add some cayenne pepper for a little background heat. I served with little fresh grated parmesan which I thought gave it a nice finish.

Excellent recipe! I have made this several times and I omit the broth and use a 28oz. can of San Marzano tomatoes. I also add some thyme. I use the skinless, boneless thighs. This is great comfort food!

I made this tonight with some minor modifications instead of using the thighs I had leftover roast chicken so I used the breast me from that. Also, before adding the chicken and beans I used my immersion blender to break down the tomatoes. The stewed tomatoes were to large for my liking. Other than that, I made as is and it was delicous!

I added carrots and celery to the onion and garlic to make something of a mirepoix and used skinless, bone-in chicken breasts. Delicious! My boyfriend loved it and we had plenty of leftovers (which I'm eating for lunch right now!). Don't be shy about seasoning and browning the chicken aggressively.

This is one of my staples, my family loves it. Don't leave out the bacon, it really makes the dish. I make it with skinless chicken thighs and often put it together and then throw it in the crockpot for several hours, taking the meat off the bone at the end - its fantastic!

Made with fresh tomatoes, rather than stewed. A hearty dish, if a bit on the bland side. The cooking process was basically the same as that of coq au vin, which is much more flavorful.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorites! I've made it several times to the letter (nearly, I skin the thighs after browning.) Recently though I made two substitution out of necessity and used 4oz of pancetta in lieu of bacon as well as boneless skinless thighs. It was still great, certainly healthier, but when you make it with bacon it's out of this world. I don't drink red wine, but purchased a single serve bottle. Instead of wasting the last bit, I rounded it out to 1 cup. Everyone including the 6 & 8 YO enjoyed this dish.

Rating: 3
This basic recipe is very good, and lends itself well to adaptations. I actually stayed pretty close to the original, with the following exceptions: I added two carrots, used skinless/boneless breasts, and added some fresh sage and rosemary from my garden instead of using the oregano. After it was cooked through according to the recipe, I added a cup of farro and let it simmer for another half hour. I think you could easily use barley or even rice, but this was what I had on hand. The addition made it even more hearty, basically a full meal in a pot.

Rating: 4
Outstanding, hearty dish. Enjoyed by my husband and three-year old son alike. Made a few minor modifications... Used pancetta instead of bacon and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and cut them into pieces before browning. Deglazed the pan with a little wine after browning chicken, added to chicken set aside, then added olive oil to pan to cook onions and garlic (which I crushed with side of knife and discarded after cooking the entire stew). Used homemade chicken stock which always adds to the flavor, and finally added an extra pinch of salt. Simmered for about an hour.

Rating: 4
I found this to be a great basic soup that is very easy to make. Instead of browning thighs, I make chicken stock with a whole bird and then reserved all of the chicken meat to add later. I also added some flour to the onions/garlic and cooked it for a minute just before adding in the liquid ingredients. I got a nice lovely thick soup that was pretty close to a stew. I also had loads of chicken from a 4 lb bird and used some leeks and just one can of beans as it was pretty thick. My one recomendation is to go easy on the oregano or else you have s soup that tastes too much like tomato sauce with chicken. I used too much oregano and had to balance it out with some extra pepper. This is a pretty mild recipe, if you have stellar ingreedients (SUPER FRESH organic free range chicken, local organic leeks, san marzanno canned tomatoes and basil just picked from the garden) the soup will really sing.

I decided i wanted to spice and bulk it up as i was cooking, so my end result was really delicious, but not exactly what recipe had intended. Thought i'd share, for those of you who like a bit of a kick! i added : *chopped chilis (one green, one red) * i didnt use wine (not drinking at the mo) *a couple of bay leaves * some smoked paprika * frozen spinach to add some green * threw in some pasta to add some bulk and avoid having a side dish. end result was FAB. am excited there are leftovers!

Yummmmy! My family loved it. I used 8 skinless thighs and skipped the bacon. And then followed the recipe. This is an easy dish to make.

This looked so good, I didn't even read the reviews before I made it. I used skinless, bone-in chicken breasts, somewhat drained fresh cut tomatoes, and fine chopped pancetta from TJ's. Wow, it was a yummy stew. I cut each chicken breast in half before browning and cooking, and I added some extra flour to the chicke broth before I added it. It thickened it a bit, but it was still a soupy stew and a bit messy to cut the chicken up in the bowl.

I found this not all that great. I did substitute the thighs with breasts but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Bland and a bit greasy (despite getting rid of much of the bacon grease after frying the bacon).

I used 12 skinless boneless thighs and this made a good thick stew. Used 6 strips of bacon (next time I will skip the bacon altogether and just saute in olive oil). I used five VERY large cloves of garlic. Added lots of pepper and dried Thai pepper. Stewed the chicken 50 minutes and cut into chunks. I added about a 1/2 bag of cut baby spinach. Served it over brown rice. Very good but needs the kick from the pepper/s. I made it the day before and by the second day (when I served it) the Thai pepper had dissipated somewhat and so I might use two next time. Very good.

Rating: 4
Yum! A perfect meal to have simmering on the stove for those nights when everyone's on a different schedule. I didn't really notice the bacon flavor, possibly because I drained off all but about a tsp of the bacon fat. Also used trimmed boneless, skinless chicken thighs, making it a healthier meal. Make sure you have a nice crusty bread to eat with it!

This is a great standby recipe for chilly evenings. My husband LUUVVS it, and my kids call it pizza soup while it's cooking because of the oregano aroma. Like other reviewers, I use boneless thighs. I also use whatever white canned beans I have in the pantry, dried oregano, and Italian stewed tomatoes, which really pick up the flavor.

I was quite disappointed with this recipe, particularly after reading all the positive reviews. It seemed realled bland. I cut down the chicken broth by a little (used about 1/2 c.), added a little extra garlic and 1/4 tsp. chili pepper. I also put in a few tablespoons of tomato paste at the end to thicken the sauce. It looked good, but seemed tasteless. I'm not going to rush to make this again.

Rating: 0
One of my family's favorite comfort foods. I make it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and although I use more bacon than the recipe calls for I keep the same amount of bacon fat so it isn't too greasy. After cooking the thighs I cut them up into smaller chunks and return to the stew. This dish is fantastic and always gets rave reviews!

Rating: 3
This was relatively good. I don't like tomato-based soups/stews as a rule, but this was good. I really liked that it was dark meat, and like so many other reviewers, I shredded the chicken right after I put the beans in and returned it to the pot. It was a nice Sunday stew with onion-herb bread I made.

Loved it. I was looking for a chicken recipe that would highlight, NOT hide the "chickeny" flavor. This recipe did the trick - simple, yet very layered with flavor. And you can add to it if you need more zing or variety. I used skinless boneless thighs, and to thicken, I pureed 1/2 can of red beans (didn't have white). Great way to hide protein and fibre for kids. Also used one can of garbanzo beans. Used white wine instead (had white no red), and it was delicious. Will make again on another cold rainy day.

Rating: 1
This was disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I shredded the thigh meat and threw it back in the pot at the very end. The broth was sort of tasty, but more like a gravy, and pretty greasy. Something about the ratio of meat/beans to broth/tomatoes was unnerving. It's less of a stew and more of chicken/beans/tomato es with some sauce. I will not make this again.

Rating: 4
I've made this many times and each time think I should make it more often. Using boneless/skinless thighs, makes it quick and easy without sacrificing any of the flavor. I always use Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed, but otherwise it is great just as written. Extremely kid, even toddler, friendly.

Rating: 4
This is an exceptional recipe in its category of easy to make and delish! I've made this many times and have never been disappointed. I use pancetta in place of the bacon and after stewing, I skin and take the chicken off the bones (easier for kids to eat!). This is great w/a crusty bread, but my kids also like it over some basmati rice (rice soaks up the sauce). It can be modified depending on what you have one hand--if no basil, not a big deal, I often just used canned whole tomatoes, and have used chick-peas when i didn't have cannellini... A keeper for sure.

I like making this dish--relatively few and easily available ingredients, simple to put together, and tasty. I do use the bacon. I like it a bit more soupy, so I use fewer chicken thighs. I keep the skin on to sauté them, then skin them afterwards. Once the chicken is back in the pot after the liquid ingredients have been added, I cook everything for much longer than 20 minutes. Eventually, the chicken is very tender. I take the meat off the bone and shred it, then put it back into the pot with the beans. Really good!

Rating: 4
This is the third time that I've made this recipe. I really love it and everyone is right that it freezes well, although we rarely have that much left over. I didn't leave the skin on the chicken but I did leave the bones in. This time, I fished out the chicken after the stew was done and took it off the bone. The bones still left their wonderful flavor in the stew but I didn't have to get really messy while eating it.

Well I started just as the write up said, but added a few more chicken breasts because there are a few more people eating with me tonight. The problem I did face was cooking the bacon, then the chicken in the same pan after you add the flower to the chicken it becomes sticky and starts to burn. After causing a small smoke screen in my kitchen I drew out another pan and started to cook the rest of the chicken in olive oil instead. I was kind of hesitant when I was making this dish, I always am though. I never like the start product, though my wife has complimented it now and is enjoying it. Take care, Hugh

Love this recipe! Ive made this more than a dozen times and heres what I do: Dredge boneless skinless chicken breasts in seasoned flour and brown in olive oil in a very hot skillet, removed and set aside. Sautee onion and garlic in pan drippings and transfer to very large stockpot & add the remaining ingredients & bring to a boil. I then slice chicken into large chunks and add to stockpot. I also simmer uncovered for at least an hour and a half to reduce it down and thicken it. SO DELCIOUS!

Fabulous!! I pretty much followed the recipe but using other reviewers advice I used Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes (loved the smoky taste) and instead of the basil and oregano I used Herb de provence. I used one chicken breast, three thighs and then threw in some leftover cooked chicken that I had in the frig. I only used one can of beans and did not dredge the chicken in flour (watching carbs). I used about double the amount of red wine and half the amount of chicken broth. I let the stew simmer on the stove for almost 2 hours and then took the chicken out, removed the bones and put it back in the stew. My husband went crazy over this and had seconds. I will definately make this again soon!

This is a wonderful recipe. The only changes I made was to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I thought it still had very good flavor. Also, I halved the beans and the tomatoes. I used diced tomatoes instead of the whole ones. Before servining I sprinkled the bacon on top and added a sprinkling of flat-leaf chopped parseley for effect. Also, I added about a handful of white corn. It was even better for lunch the next day.

Rating: 3
This was really great, particularly after it had a chance to mellow for a day. To do it all again, I'd use a different cut of chicken, maybe boneless skinless breasts or thighs without the skin to reduce the fat. I'd also cut the meat off the bones after the sauteeing step to make it easier to eat. Increased garlic, added fresh thyme, and used chopped tomatoes instead of whole because that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely make this again.

My husband really liked this dish. Said he'd love to eat it again. I didn't realize it until I tasted it, but my bacon must have been a smoked bacon because the dish had a big smoky flavor to it. I'm not much for the smoky taste, but there were no complaints, just empty plates. I might take the advice from other reviews and maybe try it without the skin and see how that goes. And I'll definitely stay away from the smoked bacon. But for those of you out there that enjoy a smoky taste, you may want to try it.

Rating: 3
Excellent. Will be making again. I followed the reciped exactly except that I cooked a little longer and I used mroe chicken. I like a longer braise and slightly thicker sauce, so I cooked a bit longer than suggested (before adding the beans of course). Came out wonderful. The bacon (at least the rendered fat) adds a debth of flavor and texture to the dish, so I'd advise against skipping it. I used one whole cut-up chicken plus four more chicken thighs and felt the ratio was good. I removed all skin and fat before browning. I served this alongside fried potatoes which I first boiled and then fried until golden and crispy. The dish was hearty, comforting and very well received.

Made this several times now (in fact I might have already reviewed it a year or two back! My apologies!) I use bone/skinless thighs and only *HALF* of the broth, tomatoes and beans -- otherwise it's too soupy for my tastes. While the skin *is* flavourful, it becomes kinda soggy (not crisp the way I like it) and makes the finished product quite fatty. I'm too lazy to remove the skin after the fact. I pour off ALL the bacon fat and use only the residue (or maybe a tsp.) to saute the onions/garlic. Also, I puree a cup of the beans (or crush the entire can) to thicken it up a tad. A bit more waistline friendly and still delicious! It gets better the longer it sits in the fridge.

This was absolutely FABULOUS!!! I read through all the reviews and pulled pieces from each. Definitely use the beef stock and no skin on the chicken. I also tossed in the crock pot. Muir Glenn Fire Roasted Tomatoes (my favorite) added extra flavor. This one is a keeper.

I made this following the recipe except I used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice, only ½ cup chicken broth and added a 6 inch sprig of fresh rosemary. With a green salad and crusty bread, it was a very good, easy week night meal. Instead of the recommended white wine at table, we had the Chianti used in the dish.

Delicious! I mostly followed the recipe except for removing the chicken skin before serving and adding some fresh rosemary to fill out my skimpy basil. Also used less chicken broth. I can't imagine not at least cooking the stew with the chicken bones as they add a depth of flavor you won't get with boneless thighs or already cooked rotiserie chicken.

Really superb. I'd give it 4 forks, except as a vegetarian I never actually tasted it. But from the smell, and the reactions of my husband, kids, brother, sister-in-law (who swears she never eats anything with beans), and a myriad of others, I'd say it's pretty darn good. Even better the second day. I made it once without bacon and my husband said that's definitely a mistake -- it really adds to the flavor. I'm planning to make a huge crockpot of it for company.

This dish was awesome. As per some of the other folks I decreased the chickcen stock to half and added herbes de provence. I also increased the garlic. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cut them into 1 inch pieces before adding them to the stew. Great depth of flavour which I am sure will improve with age. Thanks for sharing this delicious keeper.

Here's what I did: subbed 3 links hot turkey sausage for bacon...1 c. wine, keep broth...put 1/2 red pepper in w/ onions... if using dried basil, use 2 tsp., cook 20 min. w/ beans over med. heat, uncovered. This gives the whole thing a chance to reduce and concentrates the wonderful flavors. I add Old Bay to everything (see hometown!) so I sprinkled some on the thighs and in the final stew. Wonderful!

Rating: 2
2.5 forks, as is. 3 with some additions. it definitely needed some zing, so I browned some andouille sausage after the chicken and threw that in. also added red pepper flakes at the end and skipped the chix broth so it stayed thick. this is a good simple recipe for cold nights, but not for company in my opinion. better with a cold (good microbrew) beer than with wine, i think.

Rating: 3
O.M.G. Fabu! Lose the bacon, as some of the other reviews say...You don't need it. Instead of stewed tomatoes from a can, I bought a bunch of tomatoes and roasted 'em till they got a little black around the edges..It added a nice depth of flavor. You can use about half the chicken stock it calls for and use the same amount of wine and it'll be closer to a stew...I used Herbes de Provence and fresh thyme, rather than what the recipe called for 'cause I had both on hand and it worked great..I think the choice of wine here is important..Used a very nice medium bodied red...Most definitely a keeper.

I made this dish for the 2nd time tonight and it's fantastic--3 1/2 forks! A few modifications: used turkey bacon and 10 chicken thighs. Upped the garlic, eliminated the broth and basil. Added a bay leaf and 1 T each of fresh rosemary and thyme, plus 1/4 t pepper flakes. Followed recipe as written, but put sauteed chicken in a 7 qt slow cooker, poured sauce over. Cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours, added beans for last half hour. Served over rice, with salad of arugula, fennel and ricotta salata (from this site). Family and friends raved. Outstanding!

Rating: 3
I agree with Somerville NJ. Next time I will use a roasted chicken and just put the meat in. I made 1 1/2 the recipe, but 12 thighs because I wanted more chicken. Then I skinned & deboned after cooking. I know the browned chicken skin & chicken fat adds flavor, but I spent too much time degreasing. Probably because I cooked it longer than called for. I also used fresh thyme & rosemary because I have it growing. I added fresh spinach per comments to make it more complete. I could not be happier, it was being eaten even before finished! Will make again.

For what this is, it is delicious. I used rosemary instead of Basil (through a sprig in and it was perfect), used skinless boneless chicken thighs, more garlic, a little more onion, and tossed in some red pepper flakes. Like many suggested I shredded the chicken and put it back in.

I used bone-in thighs with skin and it became a bit too greasy. In hindsight, I think this recipe would be just as good with a rotissere chicken skinned. It would save a lot of time - and it is a good dish. I also switched out the basil and oregano for Rosemary & Thyme, just seemed to go better!

Made earlier this week and had leftovers last night. Thought it was good and pretty simple to make; I also removed chicken from the bone (it really makes a difference). Although it was pretty good as is, I added fresh baby spinach before serving to wilt while cooling and sprinkled with freshly grated parmesean cheese. I did feel the smokiness of the bacon was a tad overpowering - made it taste too much like there was sausage in there - so next time I might reduce the amount used or leave it out completely.

I would make it again with a few changes. I feel it was missing something, so I would omit the basil oregano, and replace them with bay leaf. Add a little honey. And I would consider serving this over egg noodles. However serving this with a bread is a good idea.

YUM YUM YUM - I've made this twice in the past month. Wonderful flavors and doesn't take long to throw together. It does seem to matter the type of wine, first time I made it with Pinot Noir and the second with Merlot. I preferred the Pinot Noir version much better. The only change I made was to use beef broth, since I had no chicken broth in the house. It may have made it a little richer. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. It's a new favorite. Have to have a great bread to go along with it, sourdough seemed to bring out the tartness in the tomatoes and wine so next time I'll get plain french bread.

This is a very good stew. We used bone-in breasts and I cut each breast into 3rds. My advice is don't use skin on, it becomes mushy......

I found this recipe several years ago and it has been a staple in my home ever since. It's always fun to experiment with it a bit based upon what I have on hand or what we are craving. Even as written, though, it is a tasty, satisfying dish.

Easy & delicious; I used frozen chopped basil & some dried Italian herb mix. Next time I'll spice it up with a dried chile pepper & sprinkle with chopped parsley when serving. I followed the advice to simmer until the flesh fell off the bone and deboned the thighs, adding the meat back to the pot. Greek giant beans (with juices) instead of cannelini worked fine.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I substituted 4 frozen boneless chicken breasts (what I had available) for the chicken thighs. I left out the wine. I used a 40 1/2 oz. can of great northern beans instead of the kidney beans. Total prep/cooking time was about an hour. We like hots, so we add dried red pepper flakes at the table. YUM!

After reading through many of the reviews and including a few (accidental) additions of my own, I found this to be a fantastic dish, wonderful for chilly nights. I followed the basic recipe with these changes: I used 10 large chicken thighs instead of 6 in an effort to achieve a stew more than a soup. Because of the extra chicken, I added another piece of bacon and browned in batches. I doubled the garlic and because I was low on dried oregano, I included a bit of thyme, Italian seasoning and a few red pepper flakes, all in all about a tablespoon and a half of dry spices. I added several rinds of Parmesan Regganio cheese because I had been saving them for use in a soup and never had the opportunity. I added more wine to the pot to cover the extra chicken, simmered the thighs for well over 50 minutes, transferred to a bowl, removed the skin, deboned in chunks (not shreds) and returned accumulated juices and meat back to pot. I drained but did not rinse beans, and when I went to cut some fresh basil from my herb garden only to discover that the first frost had indeed ended growing season, I defrosted four "cubes" of pesto that I had made this past summer, and let freeze in ice cube trays. I figured - fresh basil and other ingredients - couldn't hurt?! All ingredients in pot, I let simmer a bit more -- and was delighted to see that what had looked like a "chunky" soup started to indeed look like a stew - and it smelled terrific. This dish was superb with an arugla salad, crusty bread and a glass (or two) of Pinot Noir. Yum.

Substituted rosemary and thyme for the basil and salt pork for the bacon. I simmered the chicken for 45 minutes, and added a touch of cream at the end. We loved this stew and will be making it again soon, it is a perfect warm dish for winter!

A great tasting stew! I read the reviews before I started and used some of the suggestions, such as cooking the chicken until it fell off the bone.Then removed it from the pot and shredded it back into the stew.Definately added to the texture,also made it easier to eat!I also added bay leaf.

To the cook from New Zealand, I haven't made this recipe, but American bacon is primarily fat. It has about 25% meat, 75% fat! I suppose that if your bacon isn't so fatty, you should just make a normal roux with oil, and just brown your bacon. You don't need to make a more healthy bacon as unhealthy as ours is.

Rating: 3
Great dish, but please, WHAT drippings, guys? What is American bacon like, if cooking four slices of it produces enough drippings to brown all that floured chicken AND leave excess that needs to be reduced to two tablespoons? Or is there some hidden clue in the recipe that indicates that I was supposed to DEEP fry the bacon in a cup or two of oil? Sheesh.

Rating: 3
So good! I have made this twice and we liked it much better with bay leaves and fresh rosemary than with the basil and oregano. I did not drain one of the cans of cannellini beans because it helps thicken the stew nicely. Also, although the recipe calls for this to be covered when simmering, since there is so much liquid I simmer it uncovered for about 30 minutes so it cooks down to a stew consistency. Served in bowls with good bread -- delicious.

Terrific! Made this a day ahead. It reheated beautifully. I followed the recipe as is, except left out basil until the reheating stage, a few minutes before serving. Served with a green salad, some crusty bread and a good red wine, this made for a delicious, comfortable meal. Special, without being fussy. Definitely one for the permanent collection.

I followed this recipe exactly and it really was delicious although after only cooking it for a total of 30 min, the chicken was technically done but not falling off the bone tender like I like it. So...I went ahead and continued cooking it for about another 45 min. and at that point it was wondrous. The sauce is delicious and I did use the full amount of oregano and it was not overpowering. I will definitely make it again although next time I think I'll debone the thighs first or possibly just take them out at the end and shred the meat and readd it.

Rating: 3
This was great! Skipped the basil and oregano but opted for bay leaf and rosemary. Cooked about twice as long to achieve the "stew" effect. Also added button mushrooms and one can chick peas and one can white beans. This is a simple, very tasty, warming meal. One thigh per person was enough as I served with French bread.

Rating: 3
My family loved this stew, which I served over an herb cheese polenta, even though I used potato starch instead of flour for thickening (allergy problem with flour.) I did de-bone the chicken for ease of eating, and was afraid to use the whole Tbs. of oregeno, so just used a tsp. But I'd love to hear from someone braver how it tastes with the whole Tbs.

AMAZING. Really quite good, and easy, although i made the following substitutions: added carrots and chantarelle mushrooms (b/c i had some and didn't know what else to do with them), substituted white wine for red (b/c i prefer to drink white wine). Incredibly good. Although it is more soup than stew.

Having been forwarned that this dish was more like a soup than a stew, I slowly boiled the sauce for an hour (uncovered) before adding the chicken and continuing with the recipe. This did reduce the sauce a bit. I did a taste test before serving and was reminded of a good Nawlin's gumbo, so I cooked up a pot of rice and served the stew over the rice with some Tabasco sauce on the side. Now, that was good!

Rating: 3
I'm not sure of the definition for "stew", but to me, a stew should be able to be served on a plate. This dish had to be served in a bowl and, so, seemed more like a soup, a thick soup. However, it was quite tasty the night I made it, but it was truly outstanding the second day. An extraordinary "Italian rustic."

Rating: 3
Simple and effective. I used small dried beans and skinless, boneless chicken breasts. The next time I'm thinking of using white wine instead of red because I think it complements the white meat and beans a little better, but that's just a matter of taste. I also added some dried sage.

I always rate a recipe when I have followed the directions. However this last Nor-Easter storm left us snowed in and no way to get all the ingredients.

I would say this means you can substitute and it stills is very good!

A hearty, homey soup for a cold day.

This didn't really seem like a stew to me. It looked more like a sauce so I ended up serving it over pasta and it worked really well. I used boneless chicken breasts and turkey bacon.

this was just ok. broth was quite thin (probably should have added a can of tomato paste to thicken it up). also lacking in other vegetables - maybe some diced potatoes. also bacon lost all its crispiness once combined in the sauce. an easy recipe with pretty decent flavor but lacking in substance.

This is a simple yet tastefully delicious recipe! My husband said it was very hearty, right up his alley. I did make a few changes though. I used my crockpot, as I knew the beans would soak up the sauce, and the chicken would be very, very tender. My changes are as follows: I did not use the chicken stock or salt at all. I did use diced chicken breast. I followed the directions exactly, cooking in a pot on the stove. Then I transferred to the crockpot. I set the pot at low. After about two hours, I tasted it and thought it needed a little something. So, I added liquid smoke (Colgins), about 2 teaspoons, and I did add four more pieces of chopped cooked bacon. The stew was very thick, and some might want to add a little broth at the end of cooking. I did not, as I love thick sauces. Oh, and I did add two chicken boullion cubes also, for a little more flavor, as I added no salt at all. The stew turned out flavorful, after about 5 hours in the crockpot. The chicken fell apart. The flavor was to die for. Everyone must try this recipe. I do believe the crockpot improved the flavor quite a bit because of the long cooking time. This is a keeper! Oh, and I will definitely double this one because we did not have any leftovers, and I wish we did!

This is a hearty, flavorful stew, especially good on cold winter days. I debone the thighs and cut them into chunks.

I prepared this meal for the first time tonight. Normally I like to follow recipes by rote the first time I attempt them depending on ingredients I have available or can find. In this case, I had to use boneless/skinless thighs, about 10 more ounces of beans (only available in 19 oz cans here), a tad less fresh basil (last of the leaves from my herb garden before the fall) and a teeny bit of fresh oregano. Oh yeah... at the end, it didn't seem thick enough so I added a teaspoon of flour pre-dissolved in water. I loved it! It's a keeper!

I usually change something in a recipe, but in this one I just used boneless/skinless thighs. This from my picky husband: "this is scary good - outrageous!"

Add dried oregano to chopped onion for saute. Wait to add garlic, let onion cook 2 min. first. Simmer tomato/wine broth longer for less watery sauce (not quick, but tastes better). Add basil near the end, just a few minutes before serving.Comfort Food A+. I might try using my favorite local butcher's(Sal's Quality Market,Sch'dy, N Y) hot Italian Sausage instead of bacon sometime.

This was great! The red wine is key. Use as much as you like! I used boneless skinless thighs. I can see how it would be even more wonderful the next day. I added Herbes des Provence since I didn't have fresh basil and it was perfect. It made it a very french bistro dish. Served it over mashed potatoes and ate it in bed with cabernet and a great film.

I'm very happy with the way this recipe turned out. I used 6 slices of bacon and added a TBLS of butter before frying up the the onions and garlic. My husband loved it so it's a keeper. The dish really does have wonderful flavor; but it is a saucy dish. I added a little cornstarch mixture to thicken it up just a bit. I served this dish with a nice crusty French bread and a glass of Merlot. Maybe next time, I'll make some orzo and serve the dish over that. For dessert,we had caramel apple shortcakes!

I've made this many time with many changes. Although it tastes best with none of the fat omitted, skinless, bonelss thighs are almost as good. The bacon and red wine are essential for this stew. I never use the basil, instead I substitute dry oregano or thyme. The longer it cooks, the better.

Rating: 2
I used skinless thighs, after cooking I pulled the meat off the bones in nice chunks then added back while beans were warming, meanwhile reduced the liquid to concentrate flavor. After tasting added a little good balsamic vinegar to brighten. In the end it was okay, but not any better (in fact, as written probably not as good) as any day when I might buy some chicken parts, pick some stuff from the pantry/fridge and throw together a meal without a specific recipe. Okay, but not impressive. Even the kids agreed.

Since I never saute anything in bacon fat I used a nonstick pan for the bacon, wiped it out and then browned the chicken in olive oil using an oil mister. Next time I will definitely use boneless, skinless thighs or breasts. All in all, a delicious and filling winter meal.

Terrific winter meal! Instead of cooking the chicken in the pot 20 minutes, I transferred everything to a crock pot and cooked it on low for 4 hours. Omit the chicken broth and add the beans during the last 10 minutes just to heat through. The only other change I made was to remove the skin and bones from the thighs (which feel right off anyway) and pull the chicken into nice bite-size chunks just before serving. MMMM...perfect with a good loaf of fresh bread and a glass of the red wine used for the dish!

I took off all the skin, omitted the bacon and browned the chicken in 1Tb of olive oil. Didn't have wine so added some wine vinegar and that worked well. Used dried basil and was heavy-handed w/ all the spices. Cooked it for 40min. with the last 20 min. w/o a cover to thicken the sauce. So fast and easy and making it LOWFAT didn't sacrifice any flavor. It'a a keeper over pasta or rice.

Surprisingly wonderful dish. I made it a day ahead of time, and the flavors blended together quite nicely. I used an Australian Shiraz (2000), which is a dry, spicy red with strong berry flavors. I also skimmed the fat off the top (very little was there) and removed the skins from the chicken and shredded the meat before reheating the dish, then served it on white rice. I will make this again, but only adding 3/4 Tbs dried Oregano next time as 1 Tbs was a bit overpowering. Other than that, this was excellent!

Wow! I made this for my family tonight and they all asked for seconds. I'm from the South so I used vidalia sweet onion and Season-All seasoned salt when sprinkling the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. (I used the black pepper too) I also substituted 3 large boneless, skinless chicken breast halves cut in quarters/fifths. This didn't need any seasoning adjustments at the end... served as-is with a spoonful of rice on top and garnished with chopped basil. I also couldn't find the white kidneys so I used light red kidney beans. Wonderful dish!

Delicious! I made a couple of changes, though. Before adding the chicken the second time, I allowed the sauce to reduce a bit. I also added about a tablespoon of flour to thicken it up. After adding the chicken, I noticed the skins were coming off. I yanked them off to reduce the fat content. I served the dish over rice in a shallow bowl.

I have made this dish twice. Loved it both times, even though I added the cannelini along with the tomatoes and such instead of at the end. They held up just fine. This is a great do-ahead dish, something that you could take to a covered dish party or serve at home. However, to get the full effect of the fresh basil, I would add half when making it ahead and the other half when reheating it to serve.

Yum! I used 1 1/2 lb boneless skinless thighs and 1/1/2 lb boneless skinless breasts to keep both the white and dark meat eaters happy, doubled the onion and garlic for all of us, and used only one can of beans. It was more like a soup than a stew so I served it in flat soup bowls so we could cut the chicken. Along with some fresh baked foccaccia (quick and easy from a box mix) and a steamed artichoke as a starter it was a great Sunday evening comfort food meal.

This recipe was wonderful. I used boneless skinless thighs and cut them into bite-sized pieces before returning them to the stew. Also, I took previous advice and added the basil just before serving. It was just as good the next day for lunch. I'm only sad that summer is coming and I won't be able to make it again for some time.

I planned to serve this to my husaband and myself with pan-fried fresh spinah and garlic. When I saw that it was rather "soupy", I decided to coarsely chop the spinach and add it to the pot for soup, vs. stew. Added another cup of homemade chicken stock, and what a flavor treat it was!! Next time, I'll also add a little dittalini (small tubular pasta, or may even use macaroni), and mabe some diced zucchini just before serving...much like chicken minnestrone... and serve with grated romano or parmesan cheese and toasty hard bread.

I just love the combination of white beans and tomatoes. This is a great recipe. I followed the suggestion to use a slow cooker. To cut the fat, I used chunks of turkey breast steak and I didn't brown it ahead, but just coated in seasoned flour and added to the slow cooker. Knowing how much the crock pot retains moisture, I didn't add the chicken broth at all. And I only used one can of the cannellini beans. Oh, and substituted rosemary for the basil. Cooked all day on low and came home to a marvelous dinner. We ate with steamed green beans, and crusty bread for soaking up the sauce. Also, drizzled a little white truffle oil on top of each portion. Yummy. I will definitely make this again.

Suggest using your crock pot for this one. Brown chicken and garlic...three cloves is plenty. Add remaing ingredients to crock pot. Add canned beans and real bacon bits (another substitution) 30 minutes before serving. Boneless thighs cut up for stewing work well. Turn crock pot on low in the a.m. and it's ready when you get home from work. Serve with biscuits or crusty bread.

I learned an important lesson about the quality of ingredients while making this stew. My husband did the shopping and bought the least expensive bacon he could find. I practically ruined the stew. I made it a second time with the bacon I buy from butcher and it was perfect! Lovely for a winter evening.

I've got to tell you what I did. Yesterday, I put together a homemade chicken soup with a whole cut-up chicken, fresh dill, a few carrots, onions and served it with bow tie noodles. My family happily gobbled up half the pot. When I ran across this Chicken Stew recipe today, I couldn't wait to try it, so I used the rest of the soup and chicken as the base. I then added every thing in this recipe except for the following changes. I used Polish Kielbasa instead of the bacon, added only 2 minced garlic cloves instead of 5, skipped the oregano but added more fresh dill, didn't use the flour, and served this over the left-over bow tie noodles. OH MY, I ended up with the most DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL soup. My family practically licked their bowls. I was hesitant to add the 3/4 cup red wine to this chicken dish, but was so glad that I did. It made the soup perfect. I will make my version again and again. Although, if I have both bacon and chicken thighs in the fridge, I will try to remember to make the original version.

Rating: 3
This dish is absolutely one of my favorite meals to make and my family loves it. One thing I do different is that I fry the chicken with the skin on and then when it asks you to put the chicken back into pot, I remove the skin and remove the chicken from the bone. It just makes it easier for my small children to eat. This dish also freezes well. When you are looking for something quick to eat, make spagetti and pour this over the top. It is to die for.

What an excellent dish for a cold night! As I'm the only bean fan in the house, I reduced the number of tins of beans to one. Also, I had no fresh basil so substituted 1.5 T of dried. Next time (and there definitely will be a next time!) I will make it using boneless, skinless thighs. I found that there was quite a bit of fat in the dish once it was finished but there's no way I'd cut out the bacon fat. I did cook it a little bit longer than required, mostly because I wanted to reduce the tomato mixture and give it that richness that stewed down tomatoes have.

This was one of the best stews my husband and I have ever tasted. We cook a lot and my husband considers himself to be a great soup/stew maker. I stuck to the recipe with the exception of adding more garlic (you can never use too much). Unless your taste buds are dead, you'll love this recipe.

This is a lovely, comforting, full flavor dish. I've made it twice, both times with rave reviews from a tough crowd of food freaks. Use high quality bacon, as it serves as the hidden base for everything that follows. First time I used chicken breasts with skin on, second time boned thighs, skin off. Both ways were great. Also, I cut up chicken after sauteing into bit size pieces. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added the basil just before serving. Takes about two and one-half hours to double the recipe, enough for sixteen mean hungry people as a main dish. Great.

So yummy. It smelled awesome while it was cooking. I used boneless skinless thighs, and stewed tomatoes and broth w/ Italian seasoning, served it w/ country french bread. Next time I'll stir the fresh basil in at the end, because cooking it kind of made it lose its flavor. Don't skip the wine!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make and to eat. The aroma in the kitchen makes it as inviting to eat as it is delectable.

Wow! How could this possibly be seen as bland? My batch came out beautifully, even before salt & pepper at the end. When I added a dash of each, POW! The flavors just exploded. I made this a day ahead and plan to let everything meld together overnight. I am sure it will be even more dynamite tomorrow! I used five whole chicken leg quarters, but skinned them to cut down on fat. Nothing missing here. It's fantastic.

I also used breasts (it was all I had). The wine really makes this dish. Don't make it without it or you will really miss out on the great flavor it gives!

Very good "comfort food". I used chicken breasts in place of the thighs. An added benefit of this dish was the leftover sauce--which actually we ate the next day in the form of a very good bean soup. Will make this again many times.

I haven't tried this one yet but my mom has made it several times and said it is delicious. Easy to make and healthy. After 40 years of cooking, she appreciates a refreshingly new and easy recipe. I'm going to make it for my family.

I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe. I guess I just wanted it to be more than it was. It was quite bland and just not that exciting. I wasn't a big fan of the spice combination (or lack of it).

My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this! I used the boneless/skinless thighs and it was delicious. I think that I might add mushrooms next time!

I made this thinking my husband would eat it, but not be too crazy about it as he's not a huge stew fan. Well, he loved it even more than I did. I used drumsticks, doubled the garlic, used light red kidney beans instead of white, and white wine instead of red as that was what I had on hand. Next time I think it would be even better with red wine, but the drumsticks (deboned) were delicious.

This dish was very easy & reasonably quick to prepare. The finished stew looked appetising & comforting. I'd give it 2 1/2 forks if I could ! The down-side of the relatively quick cooking time was that the dried oregano still had that harsh & rather overpowering taste that dried herbs can have (& I actually halved the amount called for in the recipe as I don't really like dried herbs) if they don't cook for long enough. Ditto the canned tomatoes. I would make this again but only for quick, mid-week family meals. It just doesn't do it for me for company or for when you want something a little more sophisticated.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!!! It is not often that I try a recipe and say "It's perfect, I wouldn't change a thing". I thought that the blend of flavors was fabulous. I can't figure out why some folks thought it was watery or bland. Mine was very thick (definately a stew and not a soup) and had a ton of flavor. I used boneless/skinless breasts. Next time, I think I will use the thighs, skinless because the bones should add even more flavor. I think it's very important to make sure that you really use the fresh basil.....dried just would not be the same.

When I read this recipe I thought it sounded really tasty - with all that garlic, fresh basil, red wine and bacon but it was just kind of blah! My husband usually raves over stews like this but even he thought it was just okay. It could have used a couple of dashes of tabasco or something but I didn't have any in the fridge. I used chicken breasts and then shredded them and sauteed in olive oil. It was okay but not great and I don't think I'll make it again. It is very nutritious though and low fat so I guess that deserves a fork!

WOW! My mouth is still recovering from the dynamic flavors of this stew. It was very easy to make to! I used navy beans instead of the beans listed, as they are available here and the others are not.Made lots of left overs for me to continue to savor on these cold nights!I also used smoked deli bacon that added and extra degree of flavor to the dish. I will absolutely make this one at least once a month! I even forwarded this to about 10 other people who also loved it!

I really loved this recipe. It was one of the best stews I have ever made. I used breast instead of thighs some without but some with to get a little of the flavor from the skin. i also took some advice from some of the other reviews and I took the chick out and shredded it back into the stew.. Unbelievable! Can't wait to make it again!!

This recipe is very different; however, I felt that it was a great dish for cold winter days. To reduce the fat, I used skinless chicken thighs. I also used homemade beans (I presoaked and cooked them) which worked well.

Okay, folks, we have a winner! I tried this out during an unseasonably rainy patch in our normally sunny California weather pattern, and was impressed with the comfort factor of this dish. It's one of those dishes that makes you want to light a fire, pour a glass of wine, put a little Ella Fitzgerald on the stereo and let the rain do whatever it will out there...you are totally comfortable in here!

Excellent recipe! Will definitely make again.

I thought that the broth was a little watery and I had to add cornstarch to thicken it. I also thought that there was too much basil. I used skinless chicken and it was very tender. I cut the bacon down to 2 strips to reduce fat. I also felt that there was no need to used reduced sodium chicken broth because I had to add alot of salt in the end. It's an okay recipe that I would try again with a few corrections. I would have rated it 2 1/2 forks if I could have.

So easy and so delicious!! My daughters 2 & 4 kept saying "Yum" and had 2 servings -- we did too! The girls enjoyed it with angel hair pasta, hubby and I had it on a bed of rice. Will definitely make this one again.

It was rich and satisfying. Just what you want after a cold day outdoors. I served 100 at a post-yacht race reception and the hungry sailors ate every last drop. I used boneless skinless thighs, dried herbs, and added some baby carrots. It was a triumph and very inexpensive.

This is a great example of comfort food. It is now my husband's favourite request...so much so that he will have to learn to make it himself!

So easy and delicious, I made it while preparing another dinner (Epicurious' Black Bean, Mushroom and Spinach Burrito, also yummy). I used 3 legs, 3 thighs and 1 breast without skin. After cooked I removed the meat from the bone and added back into stew as suggested. You could add any spices to perk it up or leave as is. I served it the following day with a dollop of sour cream. Mmmmmm

To reduce fat I omitted the bacon and used boneless chicken breasts which I sauted in olive oil. Served it over egg noodles and it was quite tasty--good winter comfort food.

This stew is wonderful! Perfect fall or winter comfort food. I used 8 skinless chicken thighs (worked fine, and saved a lot of calories and fat) and added 2 julienned carrots along with the onion and garlic. One note: this recipe makes a ton of stew! Whoever said this only serves 4-6 people must be serving people who haven't eaten in a week.

This is a great comfort food and very easy to prepare. I couldnt find fresh basil so I substituted basil in a jar (approx 1 tsp). I also took the chicken off of the bone and discarded the skin and bones. I then shredded it and added it back to the soup. This is a wonderful soup. I will definately make this again soon.

I am delighted to find this recipe on line, as I made this dish one evening in December and left my copy of Bon Apetit behind in my ski house. It was terrific! I used canned italian tomatoes rather than stewed tomatoes and for the wine used the remains of a great bottle we enjoyed for Christmas.

This recipe is just wonderful! It got rave reviews from my family and is now on our regular weekly menu. I served it over mashed potatoes, but it would be probably be good with rice or noodles too. I left out the bacon (didn't have any in the house), replaced the tomatoes with 1 large can of "Crushed tomatoes with puree" (because I did have it in the house) which worked out great, added a couple of carrots with the onions and garlic, and substituted Herbs de Provence, but basil and oregano would work well too. Serve up some steamed green veggies too for some added nutrition and color variation.
