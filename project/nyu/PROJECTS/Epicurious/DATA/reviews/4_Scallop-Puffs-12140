I used lump crab instead of scallops...maybe that's why they turned out just "ok".

Here's my story- purists, just skip my comments! I was having one of those days. Wanted puff shells, couldn't find'em. I ended up getting canned (i know, ugh) biscuits, separated them in thirds and baked them. I wanted to use up some frozen salad shrimp, wasn't enough so i added drained canned crab. Added some cilantro and green onion, thought it sounded to bland as written. Then, i burned the edges of them! And guess what, my guests still wanted to eat them, and none were left. Draw your own conclusions, but I would say this is a good basic recipe. I will make it again (on a better bio-rhythmn day)but will definitely play with herb additions.

So easy and so very good!

Made in the phyllo cups also, and agree that it makes a much prettier presentation. This was so easy (made the scallop mixture a few hours ahead and beat and added the egg white just before guests arrived) and was still garnering raves the next days. i might try it with crabmeat next time...

My suggestion would be to make this dish with bread squares like the recipe says. I am all for experimentation so I prepared half of the scallop mixture on bread and the other half on the phyllo. In my opinion, the item that the scallop mixture is placed on is meant only to act as an instrument to get the scallops into your mouth. The puff pastry takes away too much from the wonderful and complex flavors of the focal point of this dish.

Very easy and overwhelmingly popular! I made the mixture in advance but added the egg white right before cooking. Used the phyllo cups as suggested - nice presentation.

I served this at two holiday Christmas parties, fresh out of the oven. Both times I got rave reviews and people asking for the recipe. I used filo dough cups and thought that added a lot to the presentation and didn't take any longer to do. I also added a little garlic to one batch.

I've made this a couple of times for friends, and received raves each time. I use a sliced baguette for convenience, and omit the parsley as I'm not a big fan. I've used both sea scallops and bay scallops, and find that there isn't enough of a flavor difference to warrant the extra cost of sea scallops. Will definitely make again.

I also used puff pastry and bay scallops. The concept was much better than the actual product- I found them to be bland. There were no raves for this one.

I made this last Christmas and will definately be making it again! I too made it on squares of puff pastry, following an earlier suggestion. It's fantastic! Very elegant, everyone was impressed. It kind of amuses me that apparently no one made it on toast as written! One more thing, since you cut the scallops into small pieces anyway, I used bay scallops, which are usually much less expensive.

I am a total amateur and I found this recipe very easy and quick. I took the suggestion of others and made this with frozen filo dough cups. It was wonderful! Shared them with some co-workers and got rave reviews!! Will definately make this again!

Made the scallop puffs using the frozen pastry shells as other reviewers recommended and served them with many other recipes from this site for New Year's Eve. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again.

I made these with puff pastry instead of the toast. I baked the pastry for about 8 minutes at 400 degrees, until they were just starting to brown. I then topped the squares with the scallops, and returned to the oven to finish browning (otherwise they would be soggy). Finally, I ran them under the broiler to crisp the tops. They were excellent!

I have tried this once and will definitely make it again - I agree the the pastry puffs would make for a better presentation.

I made these last year for a party and thought they were tasty but not spectacular - but my guests devoured them, so I'd make them again. I used frozen puff-pastry cups, and think that they generally make for a nicer presentation than white bread.

What a hit! My guests were so relieved not to have ordinary cheese & cracker snacks. Instead of the white bread though, I used pastry shells. Beautiful and delicious!
