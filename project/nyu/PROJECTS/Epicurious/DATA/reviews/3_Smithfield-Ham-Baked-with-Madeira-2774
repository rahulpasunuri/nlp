San Francisco has it right, but I prefer to slice off the skin while it is still warm (but not hot. Remember to slice VERY THIN. Those that thought this was too salty got the wrong ham for the wrong purpose. I tend to soak for 36 hours - It reduces the salt a bit more. A large cooler is perfect for this purpose. For those that want to learn more, I have a history and soon a step-by-step at tommyskitchen.com. For those of you that want it easy - Just buy a pre-cooked one. You can even buy cooked slices which is the perfect intro to smithfield ham. cheers!

We love this recipe! I'm making it again this weekend, even though it was part of a Thanksgiving menu. The madiera really imparts a wonderful flavor and it is a nice change from typical baked ham, ingredients, ie. honey, mustard, oj, etc..

I have not made this but if your going to bake an uncooked country ham you should know how. I suspect the Houston cook may have ordered an uncooked ham which would account for the disaster. In any event for an uncooked country ham (Smithfield or otherwise): Soak ham for 48 hours changing water 6-8 times. Put ham in a pot, completely cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Discard water and repeat this step 2 more times (for a total of 3). Fill pot again with cold water completely covering ham and bring water to barely a simmer (DO NOT BOIL). You want to poach the ham at a water temperature of about 180 degrees. Do this for 4 hours. Taste ham. If its too salty continue simmering for another hour or two tasting along the way. Remember the ham is supposed to be salty but if you don't prepare it properly it will be too/horribly salty to eat. When your done let ham cool in the poaching liquid. Remove, cover loosely with foil and refridgerate if your going to bake the following day. Preheat oven to 350. Remove skin leaving 1/4 inch of fat. At this point you can follow the Madeira recipe or do the following: Bake for 1 hour. Coat with brown sugar and bake for 30 minutes and your in business.

Wanting to cook a ham for Christmas I surfed--all too briefly!--online for something impressive. I ordered a Williamsburg country ham (the slightly less salty cousin of the Smithfield), not realizing that this is essentially prosciutto. 48 hours of soaking in 8 changes of water did, as far as I can tell, NOTHING to reduce the saltiness. Good for a Sunday buffet, assuming you can slice it thinly enough, but not the succulent chunk of ham one desires for a big holiday dinner. In short, a disaster.

I think the Arizonian's had the wrong Smithfield ham for the recipe. I used a ready to cook Smithfield Hardwood smoked ham. It was a delicious alternative to our salty Virginia country ham. I think they must have used the Smithfield country ham and did not give it the 12 hour soak and scrubbing.

Guess the Arizona dog was lucky! But you either like Smithfield hams or you don't. I soak for at least 24 hours, but the basting with Madeirs certainly improves both taste and appearance.

Made this last christmas and it was horrible. Expensive, dry, and way too salty. Feed most of it to the dogs.
