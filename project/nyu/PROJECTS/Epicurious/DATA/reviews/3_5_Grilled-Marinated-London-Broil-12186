This marinade is great. I have served this twice at dinner parties and it is always a hit! Meat has just a hint of sweetness but not overpowering at all. My meat has always been tender and easy to cut with a fork.

This is the only marinade recipe I use for London Broil. Nothing else even comes close to the quality of flavor that the marinade imparts to the beef. About the only thing I do differently is to use kosher salt in place of table salt. Marinating the steak for twenty-four hours is key to tender meat and optimal flavor enhancement. Believe me, you will not be sorry you used this recipe next time you grill!

This was delicious, although I used too much garlic this time. I would cut it back a little. And I marinated a full 24 hours, which was key. I'll definitely use it again.

This was truly exceptional. A great marinade that produced tender, delicious meat. Followed the directions exactly, marinaded in the 'fridge for 22 hrs, boiled down the marinade [as suggested by A Cook from NYC] and WOWWED the crowd!

I've made this recipe about 5 or 6 times, but using eye-round in lieu of bottom round. The eye-round is a better cut of meat, and can be easily sliced against the grain after cooking. Serve it with the purple onion recipe - also May 1996 Gourmet - and never any leftovers!

This marinate is great--I've made it several times. The meal is great and the left overs make great sandwich meats.

Marinade was very good although meat was a little tough. I tried it under the broiler instead of an outdoor grill. Made the sauce with beef broth suggested by another reviewer, very good.

After following the recipe and marinating for 24 hours, the meat was tough and the taste was worse. We took one bite and threw it out. Far too bitter. Will not make again.

It was alright. I pierced heavily, marinated for 24 hours. The meat was a little chewy and the marinade had too much of a vinegar aftertaste. Not the best London Broil I've had.

This marinate made the meat (and subsequent gravy) absolutely delicious--the honey took it out of the realm of those very acidic and puckery tasting recipes. I had a 3 lb. London broil (2+ inches thick), so I doubled everything except the salt (used 1 tsp.), and soy sauce (used 5 tsp.). It was WONDERFUL. I minced the garlic in my Zyliss and mashed it to a paste with the salt; then I just mixed all the marinate ingredients in the plastic bag--saw no need for a blender. Boiled the L/O marinate for 10 minutes before adding about 1/2 cup of beef broth. Thickened it with a cornstarch/water mixture, added a bit of unsalted butter, and it made a GREAT gravy. I don't poke or score this type of meat (I like to keep the juices in) so next time I would marinate that thick of a steak longer than the 19 hours that I allowed this time. EXCELLENT!!!

Yum! I didn't have any red wine on hand when I made this so I used 2T red wine vinegar, 2T water and 1-1/2 t sugar for the wine (per suggestion on internet for wine substitution). Next time I'll plan ahead and buy a bottle of wine.

It is hard to overstate how good this recipe is. I used supermarket top round, less garlic than recommended (I like garlic to be subtle) and just tossed it in the blender jar without mashing, and brown sugar rather than honey. Overnight marinating is essential. Be sure to drain the marinade into a sauce pan, add a cup of beef broth, reduce by at least half, and finish with a pat of butter. I have now made this three times, and each time the meat has been tender without being sliced paper thin (though do slice diagonally across the grain) and the sauce simply delectable. The sliced meat and sauce freeze well, by the way. Reheated sauce over room temp meat and toast or hot mashed potatoes makes a great quick supper.

THE SECRET TO TENDER LONDON BROIL: Leave the steak in the marinade for at least 24 hours. Here's the most important part....cut THIN slices AGAINST THE GRAIN of the meat. You will not be disappointed.

This is very simple to make and everyone I have served it to loves it. I like it just as well as a sauce reduced over low heat untill it is very thick. I have also made it with brown sugar when I had no honey and it was just as good.

If I were to make this again I would cut the amount of vinegar in half. It had a very strong vinegar taste to it.

Have used this recipe many times, including feeding fifty guests for a party. Its easy and a great flavor for guests. I do like to cook a three/ three 1/2 pound 2 inch thick piece of meat. Fire has to be vry hot to sear the mest.

Loved the marinade and the reduction sauce that I made to serve over the London Broil (reduced the marinade and added butter). However, I will never serve this cut of beef again. Despite piercing the meat, marinating it for about 32 hours, broiling it to medium-rare, slicing it thinly against the grain, it was still chewy and dense. Just not pleasant. I will try the marinade on a better cut of meat and I expect that it will be wonderful.

Excellent! Followed recipe for marinade to a T; pierced and left bagged in refrigerator overnite. Added the step of boiling the marinade to use as a sauce with the meat and the rice I served alongside and it was wonderfully flavorful. I pan-grilled until 120 degrees, tented, and sliced thin and it came out as dark on the outside and as pink on the inside and as tender as any surloin...honestly!

This is nothing compared to the GRILLED BALSAMIC-MARINATED LONDON BROIL WITH RED ONIONS recipe on this site. Now that is good!

I've made this several times. Wonderful recipe when I took some of the above suggestions. I doubled the recipe, marinated for 24 hours or longer, and pierced the meat all over with a fork before marinating. The piercing and long marinating made all the difference. Cook to rare or just medium rare. Also, reducing the marinade and adding a little butter to makes a very elegant sauce to serve alongside. A great way to serve less expensive cut.

Quadrupled receipe and marinated for 28 hours. Lots of flavour, very tender - not a bite was left over.

With the price of beef so high, this is a great way to serve grilled beef on a budget. Definitely marinate for 24 hours. I also used a 3 prong fork to pierce the meat all over & through before putting it in the marinade.

I have made this recipe several times - using various different cuts of meat - all turned out wonderful. The recipe is super easy to make, low calorie, and full of flavor. I have grilled it, or broiled it (and have even added some potatoes to the left-over marinade in the oven - yum!) and it has been great every time.

Marinade all day in fridge. Sit at room temp 1 hour. On George grill for 4 1/2 minutes. Rest 5 minutes. Slice thin against the grain. Home run!

This was really delicious. Making a reduction sauce out of the marinade was a big hit. A lot of people seem to have trouble with the toughness of this cut of meat. It is wonderful if marinated for 24 hours and then cut properly. Thin slices with a very sharp knife, and a 45 degree angle across the grain will yield much more tender slices. Yum.

I had the meat in the marinade for nearly 24 hours. We grilled it medium rare and sliced it thinly. It was awesome!

This meat was just too tough for me, although other diners liked it. I marinated about seven hours, but I don't think longer marination would make all that much difference. However, the marinade was really delicious, and the preparation was easy. So I would make this again, but use a tenderer cut than top round.

This is outstanding, our London broil favorite. Our guests rave about it. I've seen this recipe lifted (without credit) and printed in several newspapers. A winner

After marinating over 24 hours, I cooked it in the oven instead of grilling it. I took the marinade and simmered it for the duration of the time it took to cook the meat and then thickened it with a bit of butter to make a wonderful, rich, tangy sauce. I also deglazed the cooking vessel and enriched the sauce with that.

Rating: 3
I will only cook this cut of meat with this recipe from now on! My hubby is still raving about the delicious meal we had last nite. This cut is quite tough, and I think I will marinate it for longer than 24 hours next time. I felt there was a bit too much balsamic vinegar for my taste but otherwise the flavours melded together very well. Served it with couscous and green beans. mmm!!!!

The marinade was not an effective one! For a cut of beef of this toughness, try crushing a couple of kiwi friut, and adding to the marinade. Don't marinate if for over six hours, or the acidic content of the kiwi will almost dgest te beef, and it will make a soupy slurry of the top layer(s) of the steak. Try an entire flank steak. This is the ORIGINAL London broil! Excellent taste

Rating: 3
Delicious marinade- but MAN what a tough cut of meat London Broil is! This was my first time making London Broil, so maybe I did not select a good enough piece, but it was so tough to chew even though I marinated for 26 hours and got a perfect medium-rare. I think I will try using the marinade next time on a different cut. Despite its toughness though it certainly was juicy and very flavorful. I used the red wine vinegar instead of red wine, and I used some imported Balsamic instead of domestic, which apparently makes a world of a difference because its not nearly as tart.

Rating: 3
This was great. Made it for Mother's Day. I substituted red wine vinegar in place of the red wine when I was out of wine and like it better that way. It pleased all 6 adults and 4 children raved about it. Marinating for AT LEAST 24 hours is a must.

I've made this marinade twice now and my guests have loved it. This is a great basic recipe for the marinade, to which you can add some additional ingredients if your in the mood for a little diffrent flavor... For example, you could vary the recioped by adding herbs or mustard. A few recommendations: 1) marinate overnight is better, 2) you MUST let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing, 3) make sure you have a very sharp knife, or an electric knife, so that you can slice the meat veyr thin. Enjoy!

This marinade is easy and tasty. I always have these ingredients on hand which is a plus. I had gotten away from making london broil because I just find it to be a tough cut of meat. I tried this marinade since it required the meat to marinade for a long time. Everyone keeps telling me that marinading is the key when cooking a london broil. I think I still disagree...lol. I would try this marinade again on a differnt cut of meat.

I made this recipe while on a camping trip. The ingredients travel well as none need to be in a cooler except the beef. Also, "camp food" sides (grilled corn, potatoes and vegetables) go well with it.

I used the marinade on 1 1/2 inch thick New York Strip steak cut into kebabs last night. I marinated the meat for 4 hours and had to broil (instead of grill) the kebabs due to a sudden downpour. Got rave reviews from my husband, the neighbors, and even our children. Everybody went back for seconds. Will add this recipe to my list of favorite marinades!

Now that I have this under the correct recipe...I thought it was great. I used red wine vinegar in place of red wine. I marinated for 20 hours, turning once. Make sure you watch the cooking time and don't overcook. It was very juicy for london broil and the balsamic vinegar flavor is very present...definitely making it again.

A very good marinade -- a nice sweet, garlicky flavor; not the best, but I'd certainly make it again. The meat is also easily made on a preheated indoor grill pan.

I had never made London Broil, so was happy to find this great marinade. This really enhanced the flavor without covering up the beef flavor. It was worth the trouble of grilling instead of broiling. I used 3 pounds of Neiman Ranch beef and doubled the marinade (though I think 1 batch would have been fine). I didn't want to use up all my expensive balsamic, so I used 1/3 part balsamic and 2/3's part red wine vinegar. 5 hours marinating was fine.

The key to this london broil is not to over marinate it. I mariante it for 4 hours only and then actually broil it in the oven for 7-8 minutes on each side.

I used shoulder steak rather than top round, and pierced the meat with a fork as well as slashing it in typical London Broil fashion. It was quite tasty when cooked rare and thinly sliced, especially with a garnish of grilled portobello mushrooms. I also used a bit half the amount of balsamic vinegar and the marinade was not as overpowering as others of this type. I'll use this as my "house special" London Broil for the rest of the summer.
