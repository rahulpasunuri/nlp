I gave this recipe 4 forks because its so simple to prepare yet really delicious. I added a little clam broth to make extra juice for the clams and tossed in some diced prosciutto at the end. Use Barilla Plus angle hair for a very healthy meal.

I just used New Zealand cockles for this dish and it was so yummy! Love the arugula flavor, next time I'll add more.

I made this as a quick lunchtime meal on a Sunday. This dish reminds me of some of the best pasta dishes I used to have in NJ. I forgot the greens and didn't have any shallots, but it still came out great. I also added a little butter and a little of the pasta water to help bring the sauce together. A great dish that I would make again and continue to experiment to come up with other variations.

Great twist on linguini and clams. The arugula gives it a nice bump in flavor.

We enjoyed this dinner, and Kendall Jackson Sauvignon Blanc was a nice match. I adapted the recipe to use our chowder clams, and also reserved all the seeded and diced tomatoes to toss at the end along with the arugula.

i had this dish at il pastaio about a month ago. the actual dish differed from this recipe in that it was made with fresh bianchi e neri (black and white) pasta, and it did not contain tomatoes. when i made this dish at home, i found the tomatoes to be a nice addition, and it added the bit of color missing b/c of the plain pasta. this is very easy to prepare and i really love the taste and texture of the arugula with the clams. excellent.

My first time making Linguine and Clams and this recipe made it so easy! The arugula is a nice addition. I was nervous about having gritty clams but I soaked them for about 1 hour in vinegar and salt then scrubbed them and that seemed to get rid of any sediment. Also, Little Necks are WAY to big so I used half Little Necks and half New Zealand Cockles. The cockles slipped out into the sauce while cooking which was perfect, and I topped the dish with the Little Necks. A beautiful presentation! I can't wait to make it again!

I have made this dish for two different dinner parties and have had rave reviews both times. Very simple to make and feeds a large crowd easily.
