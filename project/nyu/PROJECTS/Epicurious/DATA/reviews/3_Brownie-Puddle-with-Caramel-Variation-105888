My clients love this recipe! I make it in a sheet pan sometimes and cut into little squares, each w/ a "puddle" in the middle. They're always the first thing to go on a dessert buffet.

I've made this recipe half a dozen times, and I've learned a few things that might help. One thing is that Americans (myself included)don't enjoy the intense bittersweet flavor in this dessert. So here's what you do: use semisweet chocolate instead. I use callebaut semisweet for the ganache puddles, and a mix of bittersweet and semisweet for the brownie (more semi than bitter). It is very rich and decadent, but if you follow my advice, you'll go to chocolate heaven. The other thing, if you're trying it for the first time: the chocolate puddles are superior to the caramel puddles.

Not very good. Tasted too rich, too semisweet chocolatey. The caramel was good, but didn't seem to do much to compliment the brownie.

A friend tasted this, and immediately said, "get that away from me!" because he's trying to lose weight. It's remarkably good and quite rich.

This is an amazing recipe but you have to follow the directions carefully. I topped it with a simple chocolate glaze.

This recipe went exactly as described. I had about 1 t. ganache left over, which I ate (not a hardwhip!) This stuff is VERY rich; I cut it into 8 portions, people ate only half of each, so I think you could serve 12-15 people from 1 recipe.

This recipe sounded amazing, but it was only fair. Also, I had to double the amount of ganache and extend the cooking time an extra 15 minutes to make it work. My guests liked it, but with so many chocolate desserts out there to try, I doubt I will make this one again.
