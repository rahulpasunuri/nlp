I put the arugula in boiling water for about 30 seconds and squeeze out the water. This is supposed to keep the arugula a nice shade of green. It is also works with almonds instead of walnuts. I have also added some (10% of volume of arugula) basil leaves if the arugula is on the more bitter side. My husband likes it when I add dash of cayenne pepper. We like to mix this pesto with some mayonnaise and put it on a turkey sandwich.
