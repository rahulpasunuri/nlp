I have made this for several parties and it always goes over as a huge hit. Try various other thinly sliced meats as well sprinkled with cracked black pepper or parmesan cheese.

This was okay, nothing special.

I made these and put a little dollop of feta/spinach cream cheese and loved them. I don't even like salami or cream cheese. These are my new favorite snack. Simple to make easy to eat

Sorry, love salami, but disliked the crisps.

This... ...in my honest opinion is way better than your current selection of quick, easy to make snacks. I would say that only Skittleâ„¢ would be above this. But thats just me and my sweet tooth Another household favorite is crispy chicken skin! Can you say yum!!! Basically the same method to prepare, sprinkle some salt and pepper (season salt is good too) Place chicken skins on cookie sheet and broil till browned Variations include but are not limited to: duck, turkey, quail! Bon-Apetit

Great low carb snack that has crunch. I spinkled a little cheese on top for a little variety. These are greasy but just blot them with paper towels.

Great low carb snack! My husband tried this before but the key is cook low and rotate half way through so they don't burn. We also used them as a low carb chip and made nachos with cheese sause!

Man, I didn't not know there were rules to how we should eat. Like they said before you ain't impressing anyone. If I wanted to eat salami in the Italian way, I'll be sure to cook it in the Italian way ok. P.S. No offense

Haven't tried it yet (so no review) but I have tried pepperoni crisped like this. I remove the pepperoni grease from the finished product by putting them between layers of paper towels. Fabulous!

"salami should be eaten freshly sliced, preferably in an antipasto plate or in a good panino/rosetta al'olio with some giardiniera on the side" says the cook from Ottawa. Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life and now we have salami police? If a person enjoys chocolate milk with foie gras and shaved truffles or Dom Perignon with a hot dog go for it! Food is meant to be enjoyed whenever and however a diner wishes. A true epicurean would agree. To all you food snobs out there - take your pompous attitudes somewhere else. SALAMI CRISPS ROCK!

Really, Ottawa - So what do you do all day? Spend your time looking up recipes that use ingredients in an unconventional way so you can "impress" readers with your knowledge and expertise of how things "should be?" Well, I got news for ya' - it ain't workin'. No one's impressed here.. These crisps are simple and tasty with cocktails.

I love these. I have made them several times. It's a great crunch for the south beach dieters...

They are fine without the parchment paper...I put them on a baking sheet, spinkled with Parmesan cheese - baked for about 10 minutes at 425' and they turned out great - even if they are a little blackened..they are good...Pancetta slices are a good alternative. And - yes - crisp bacon-lovers will love this even more! Cut 'em up and use them where you would use bacon bits.

PS........I used Genoa - not chewy at all if you bake it hot enough, I sprinkled freshly grated parmesan cheese on them... yum!

I used these in an Antipasto salad with spinach and grilled chicken... they added a wonderful touch...don't think I'd really just eat them alone.

These were pretty yummy. i think the microwave idea with paper towels from a previous reviewer is a good idea for cutting down the grease. We served these with champagne, and broiled goat cheese stuffed -prosciuto wrapped figs, and the mushroom crostini recipe from this site also. A very nice salty, sweet, crunchy, savory combination of flavors!

I do these in my microwave on a plate with a paper towel underneath the salami to soak up the grease and one on top of the salami to prevent spattering. Experiment since all microwaves are different and if the salami is sliced paper thin like a potato chip it will crisp nicely. I use hard salami instead of Genoa and I eat them with potato chips so needless to say, it's not heart healthy..and not exactly gourmet food, but yummy! It works with pepperoni, also.

Didn't try this one, but always used to make grilled salami in a frying pan when I was a kid. Top with a slice of cheese to melt and put it on a roll. Just like Pork Roll! Asked for it once in a diner. Thought I was nutty.

These were not good at all!!! A great way to ruin wonderful salami. They were heavy, dense, chewy, soggy and greasy. Rather disgusting, even for lo-carb! Where was the "crisp"? Yuck!

Rating: 4
this was a wonderful find for my 8-year old's lunches. I've made them several times and they're a big hit for snacks as well. Not sure if it's the salami or length of time cooking, but sometimes come out real chewy - othertimes nice and crisp!

I have not made this actual recipe, but have made something similar with pepperoni after trying it at a restaurant. Very good, and if you let them dry on the parchment, they are not greasy at all. However, a little does go a long way since they are salty and heavy.

Having not (yet) tried this recipe, I just wanted to observe that of all its negative reviewers, only one has actually *tried* the recipe. I think Epicurious should have a rule, or at least a guideline: DON'T WASTE OUR TIME REVIEWING RECIPES YOU HAVEN'T TRIED!!! (of course, that would eliminate *this* review ;) ...

This isnt exactly rocket science. Not only that but totally yucky greasy and if you over bake this it doesnt taste very good. I would much rather eat Salami Freshly sliced with a cube of my favorite cheese or with some spicy mustard on it.. dont ruin a good salami by baking or frying it.

I made these for a low-carb group meeting and they were a hit. We are always trying to come up with suitable snacks that are enjoyable and satisfying. What a great party idea! If anyone has any more ideas of this nature I would love for you to share them. Thanks!!!

I really enjoy cooking your recipes, and have never commented before, however, my poor Italian grandmother would roll over in her grave if she would ever see what you have done with salami! Here is great example of how simple ethnic cuisine is being "north-americanized". Do this recipe with pepperoni if you will, but salami should be eaten freshly sliced, preferably in an antipasto plate or in a good panino/rosetta al'olio with some giardiniera on the side. Looking for an appetizer and crave salami: just fold a slice in 4 and put on a tootpick along with a piece of cheese. Easy, classy and not greasy. I won't be trying this recipe.

We have made this with Pepperoni for a low-carb snack. Works just as well in the microwave. Put paper towels on a plate and microwave for 2-2 1/2 minutes.

If you like these you might also like Fried Salami Sandwich Fry 3 slices of salami over medium heat (no need to add oil to the pan) until edges curl over and get dark (but not black). I like this with mustard on toasted rye bread. It's a nice alternative to the ordinary salami sandwich.

I made this dish and it was great. But I made it for a road trip the next day and I must say that they didn't keep well. I stored them in paper towels in a ziploc bag and the next day they were chewy and a little rancid. Any ideas about storing them or are they a "must use immediately" dish?

I used genoa salami and slicing pepperoni...so yummy. If you like crispy bacon you'll love this =)

Made these for a large group -- used about a pound of salami. They were a huge hit. After baking I just set them on paper towels and they were fine. This is a keeper for easy cocktail party food that can be made completely in advance. Also, for those interested in low-carb, this is a great alternative to crackers and chips.

Easy little snack to go with cocktails. I did them stove top in a pan and drained them on paper towelw. Made them plain first and then again with a dab of cream cheese and chives.

Easy to make and different, but greasy! Had to use paper towels to absorb the fat before serving them
