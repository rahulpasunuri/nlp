This was an exceptional recipe. A lot of preparation, but worth all the effort in the end. I used half & half over the heavy cream. Huge hit with my crew, and even better the next day! =)

I used leftover chicken that I had roasted previously. I followed the recipe but mixed the chicken, pasta, mushrooms and sauce all together in a bowl before putting into casserole. I added just a little more cream and stock before putting into the oven. I added 1 tsp truffle olive oil to the sauce. I also used fresh sphagetti. The product was a delightful dish with a gourmet flair.

I made this per the recipe with few changes. It is very good and I got many compliments. I roasted my own chickens and used Swansons organic chicken stock. I used a variety of mushrooms to give it more complexity. It works as a doubled recipe for a larger party. I made and assembled it 3 days ahead and refrigerated it. I cooked it per the recipe and it took about 10 extra minutes. I did have it in 2 baking dishes.

This reciped was full of intense flavor. Yes it is time consuming but well worth the time and effort. As to the comments about the sauce being thin, try reducing the sauce. EVeryone that ate this licked their plate and wanted more.....alas gone!

So very disappointing. I never even served it. After all the work (and I DID all the work!) there was no flavor. None. I added more sherry in a desperate attempt to create taste, but it wasn't saved... I've made tetrazzini with leftover Thanksgiving turkey many times in the past...all quicky, little-labor recipes...and all better than this one...don't bother with it! I can't imagine even cheating on step one will help.

My husband loved this dish and he's usually not very fond of casseroles. It does take a bit of time to prepare so por a glass of vino and turn n some tunes and enjoy the moment. Taste everything as you go so that it becomes well seasoned bast of your taste beds. excellent meal!!!

I cook a lot, and this is the best recipe that I have by far! Every event that I bring this dish to, I get compliments and people asking me for the recipe. With so many ingredients, you can remove or add items to make it your own personalized dish. It takes a while to prepare this dish, but it will be well worth the wait!!!

The flavor in this dish was exceptional and even better the next day. My husband loved it. I just happened to have truffle cream on hand from a small Italian specialty food store in the Pike Place market. The sauce was already fabulous up to this point, but the truffle cream made it that much better. I wanted to lick my bowl! I used Kitchen Basics chicken stock from a carton and two boneless/skinless breasts roasted in the oven on a cookie sheet and covered with foil then just diced the chicken. I'll be making this one again.

In the interest of time, I just used chicken stock (2 cups) and dried mixed reconstituted wild mushrooms diced from Costco (Morels, porcini, etc.), no cream just 1/2 and 1/2, and turkey leftover breast meat. Result: rich, flavorful, delicious. Nothing like I had in college at the cafteria 30 years ago.... Definitely a keeper, certainly can vary the theme a bit. Added a touch of nutmeg as well at the end prior to oven time, as this seems to be a common ingredient in joy of cooking and fanny farmer in their recipes for tetrazzini. Very rich! Enjoy.

A beautiful glorified turkey noodle casserole! Lovely flavors. Acceptable shortcuts include not making your own stock, and tossing all ingredients together (except cheese) before baking. An ingenious and tasty use for our leftover thanksgiving turkey - will DEFINITELY make over and over again.

Rating: 1
(1) This takes so much time because you have to make the stock first. It's easier to make good stock and have it handy in the freezer. (2) I thought the recipe was rather bland. It lacked vibrance. To help it along, I used smoked paprika, sprinkled into the sauce along with the salt and pepper. That helped a bit. Next time I'll use more. Or, I'll try making it with finely minced herbs... thyme, perhaps, and a hint of rosemary (which pairs well with chicken as well as with mushrooms). I will be making tetrazzini again, but with far more vibrance than this recipe allows for.

Really quite tasty, but not worthy of 4 forks. A fair amount of work also - we got it done in 1.75 hours, but were hustling.

This was excellent, even though I forgot to add the onion. I too used truffle oil since I couldn't find truffle butter. The cloves add such a nice flavor. I tossed the pasta in truffle oil after cooking while I finished cooking the sauce.

I hesitated to rate this, as I made a few changes, but I wanted to warn people that replacing fat-free half & half for the cream WILL NOT yield a thick creamy sauce. I don't know why my roux didn't work, I still used butter and flour. It also needs more sherry. This smelled wonderful as it was being made, but by the time we ate it (the next day, which i thought would intensify the flavors) it was just blah. Very disappointing.

Rating: 4
Ah, wonderful. The taste is excellent. While this recipe is a little time consuming (2 1/2 hours is right), as long as you have time to stay at home and watch it cook, the work time isn't too much. My mother-in-law even asked for the recipe and our cooking styles aren't terribly similar.

Really, almost 4 forks!Used a drizzle of white truffle oil in place of the truffle butter. YUM!!

Solid comfort food. We used leftover turkey, so had no bones, but it was super anyway (just used a bit more stock). We removed the bay leaf and celery and pureed the remaining veggies into the stock. Probably a slightly different flavor profile but it was great! It's on the "permanent" list.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent dish. It really will stun even the most seasoned foodie. Do not skimp on the truffle butter and if you can not find truffle butter, most specialty food stores sell truffle oil and it tastes equally as good. Make sure you print a copy and place the recipe in your online recipe box as you will make this again.

oh, and edit: I put in two bone-in, rib-meat chicken breasts (to complete the 2 lbs of chicken called for) along with the broth and everything else. took more like 40 minutes to cook fully through (meaning I often had to cover the pot fully) but was well worth it in terms of tender, flavorful chicken meat. also thought there was a little much sauce. it was divinely tasty, but next time I'll throw in some peas or broccoli to round it out.

Rating: 4
felt odd to hear a tetrazzini recipe call for store-bought chicken and no cream of mushroom soup . . . but that said, it came out divine. the butter and pasta and relatively scarce veggies make this a good fall comfort food, and the truffle butter (or, in my case, oil) and reduced chicken stock really elevate this to a truly terrific dinner.

Needs more sauce for my taste buds. I thought it was edible, my husband thought it was too dry and lacked flavor. Too much work for such unimpressive results.

I make this all the time, I love it!!! I do cut down on the prep time boiling skinless chicken breasts with bone in canned chicken broth with a cube or two of bullion, works equally well without as much fuss

At first my husband and I were unimpressed with this dish - it seemed very bland (which, come to think of it, I always thought of chicken tetrazzini as a kid). But when we ate the leftovers the next day it had sooooo much more flavor. I gave it three forks based entirely on that, and I will make it next time a day ahead as is suggested.

This is worth the effort and to answer the cook from Westport, Ct. Yes this can be made the day before and it also freezes well.

This recipe was delicous and a hit with my family. I tried the recipe because I was trying to duplicate my mother's tetrazzini. The flavor was perfect. I used chicken breasts cut up and sauted. I didnt, discard the carrots oninon and garlic I mixed them back into the sauce, and I topped the dish with a bread crumb and parmesan cheese mixture before putting it in the oven. Perfection! It took me back to my childhood.

This is an excellent recipe. One of the best pasta recipe's I have ever made. I use black truffle oil instead of truffle butter either way using the truffles is what makes this recipe so satisfying. I make it at least twice a month and can not wait until leftover turkey Thanksgiving to make it again. Enjoy!

I am planning to make this next week but have a question - do you think I can assemble it the day before and cook it the next day, or would the pasta get soggy?

Rating: 3
A definite keeper-- the ratio of chicken to pasta is a bit skewed. 2 grocery store rotisserie chickens (GSRC) is too much-- 1 larger-sized GSRC is plenty. I'll also add more pasta and a bit more sauce next time...

I found this recipe very quick to prepare, super easy and absolutlely delish!!!!!! I did not add any salt, used left over turkey breast meat and beefed up on the pepper. Pasta I under cooked so it would remain firm after this dish was complete.

Delicious, but compared to its low-rent cousin that starts with a can of cream of mushroom soup, too much work and not enough differentiation.

Rating: 4
I think these last two weeks of rain drew me to a comfort food recipe and I'm glad I looked! I had homemade broth already and just used two cups of that and sub'd the cream with half and half. I've started using the light butter on the market and with some tweaking for the roux it worked out well. I've made it twice so far back to back and eat it for breakfast! It did become tedious with its many steps (and all the dishes!) but it is very good.

I made it as written with the exception of the truffle oil. We loved it. It is not your grade school caffeteria tetrazini. YUM.

This is delicious and a wonderful use of leftover chicken. I used half the amount called for, and it was plenty. The sauce was thin right from the oven but thickened after sitting for a few minutes. Absolute comfort food.

This reminds me of what Mom makes. Warm and cozy. I used left over honey lemon roasted chicken, shittakes and portabellos (more than called for), probably a little extra pasta and a little less chicken, as I used what I had, which I think is what this type of recipe grew from. I didn't have any truffle butter, but I added truffle oil to the mushrooms and instead of buttering the baking vessel, I rubbed it with truffle oil, which really worked well. The whole dish is permeated with truffle flavor and aroma. Oh, I didn't to the acrobatics with the stock, I simply used my homemade, reduced stock. Easy, pleasey comfort food.

Man oh man did this ever take a long time to make. I estimate it took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes (including the baking time in the oven), and I am not a novice cook. It was good, but not good enough for all the time invested.

I, too, thought this was an excellent version of Tetrazini, which usually is quite bland. I used leftover poached chicken from soup, although less than the recipe called for. Also added a little cayenne pepper to sauce, and used half cream and half 1/2& 1/2. Only change I would make is to add a little more flour to roux, as there was quite a bit of sauce, and it could have been a little thicker. Will definitely make again.

The sauce is really delicious and rich. I had some truffle butter left over from a dinner party so I used it--but I think the taste gets lost and the sauce probably has enough flavor without it.

A fine alternative to most tetrazzini recipes, which often taste like bland glop. The sauce is perfect. Used chicken stock and cooked chicken that I had on hand, and tossed a handful of finely chopped Italian parsley to the pasta. It took 1 hour start to finish, including cooking time. The secret is to cook the mushrooms until they turn golden, which makes the butter start to brown, and cook the roux to a nice rich golden color -- adds just the right flavor.

I kept thinking about the 3rd grade turkey tetrazzini when I saw this recipe but was so good it's going in the regular rotation. I made one adjustment, I put chicken breasts in the broth around 22 minutes in, then finished them off in a saute pan with the mushrooms, the flavor of the broth really seasoned the chicken breasts quickly in a surprisingly good way. I didn't have all the chicken bones around. This recipe took me an hour, start to finish, I can't imagine how to stretch it out for 2 1/2 hours?

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe but I did a lot of adjustments. I used canned broth and poached chicken breast (3). I thought the whole 1st steps were unnessasary and time consuming. It was wonderful and my whole family went back for 3rds. I will use this recipe again.

Just so anyone looking to cut down the fat in this recipe knows-- the previous reviewer meant to say Fat free, EVAPORATED milk!! Not condensed!!! That would be a big mistake, to add a cup of sugar to this dish!! Also, fat-free half-and-half works quite nicely!

Rating: 4
I followed everyone's advise, less chicken, using 100% fat free condensed milk (as I alwasy do instead of cream or whole milk) and peas. Everyone loved it! From 2 year olds to 74 year olds. Have made it twice and it is a hit. If you have the time, the home made broth is worth it.

Very good! I also used Kitchen Basics stock. To intensify the flavor, I used 3 cups and reduced to 2. I also used one more T of Sherry. I had to use whole milk as I had no cream, but the results were very good! My husband and kids really liked this one... it was proclaimed, "A keeper!"

Comfort food at it's best. From childhood I remember the addition of sliced green olives to this recipe, but have been unable to verify if that is authentic. Did not bake as directed, simply ladled sauce on top of buttered noodles. Save yourself the trouble of making stock if you can purchase Kitchen Basic Chicken Stock at Trader Joes, not only fast, but very good. If we are shortcutting with deli chicken, might as well go all the way. Agree only one pound of chicken is required, as previous reviewers have mentioned. Great dining for little effort.

Make the recipe the way it says except 1/2 the amount of chicken, I agree it would be too much meat. But definately make the stock it was worth it, so delicious and very easy!

Too much work! I just used 2 cups of chicken broth in place of the doctored-up low sodium version. And I reduced cooked chicken weight to 1.5 lbs. per other recommendations, and substituted skim milk for the heavy cream. Also added cut scallion greens to the mushroom mixture. My husband and I both loved the end result...much moister and more flavorful than other tetrazzini recipes!

Rating: 4
My family loved this. I made a slightly lower fat version by making the roux and adding the 2 cups of hot stock and continuing to cook it down and add more stock instead of using the heavy cream. I probably added at least another cup of stock. At the end, I added about 1/2 cup of half and half but I don't think this was even necessary. I also added frozen peas for color

A delicious, rich recipe. However, two pounds of chicken is far too much for 1/2 pound of spaghetti. Kind of an all meat and no potatoes balance.

A very good recipe for leftover chicken. Here are my changes: 1) use leftover roasted chicken as a timesaver; 2) substituted al dente broccoli for the mushrooms as my kids aren't huge mushroom eaters; and 3) used penne instead of spaghetti. Overall, a good weeknight recipe.

This was a great one dish meal, with left-overs for the next day. It was rich, and I may substitute milk for the heavy cream next time. My family loved it, I will definately make it again.
