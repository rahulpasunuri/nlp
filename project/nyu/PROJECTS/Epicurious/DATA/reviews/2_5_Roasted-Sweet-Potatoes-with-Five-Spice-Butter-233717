The five spice is not very good and ruins the sweet potatoes. You are better off just putting butter and brown sugar on the potato.

I am always looking for new ways to serve yams, and this is a great one. I tossed 1/2 inch chunks of yams with butter and five-spice, then convection roasted at 425 for only 15 minutes, along with some halved figs. was fantastic! will do again, soon! the guests, the hubby even the kids loved them.

Just ok. Maybe melt the butter and add the five spice, orange juice and orange peeal to make a butte sauce.

Surprisingly tasty, the sweet potatoes benefit from lots of orange peel and just a hint of five-spice powder. I microwaved one sweet potato. I melted 1 T. butter with 11/2 t. peel and 1/8 t. five-spice powder then poured the butter mixture over the potato halves. This dish is delicious, easy to prepare, and not too sweet.

Despite being from the midwest (see review from San Diego) , my entire family found this to be delicious and a great substitute for rice or other sides. My kids loved it! Perfect for any night at home.

Excellent combination...definitely appreciated by those who understand the beauty of food from different cultures...Not a good choice for the midwestern meat & potato consumers...best you stick to happy meals.

The 5-spice is very overwhelming even when used sparingly. My boyfriend likened the taste to "sweet potatoes sprayed with Glade Floral Scent".

Great and easy! It's almost like adding brown sugar on top of your potato. Yum!

What an interesting twist for sweet potatoes. We bake sweets at least five times a month. A keeper.
