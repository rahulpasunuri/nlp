This is a good recipe. I used rotini instead of linguine and basil instead of oregano. It came out a little too salty because I was tasting and seasoning it forgetting that I would be adding cheese to it later. Overall, a good dish.

Really great pasta dish. I'm not a huge fan of eggplant but I stuck to the recipe and I couldn't deny the deliciousness of the finished product.

Was well received as a vegetarian entree at my corporate restaurant. Caramelize onions for sweetness. Fresh basil in place of oregano. Splash of balsamic vinegar. A little sugar if your tomatoes are tart. Served with penne. Addition of mushrooms and olives would be great for next time.

This was wonderful! I used mushrooms instead of eggplant, and I only use one onion instead of two. I served it with homemade meatballs, and it was a big hit!

This is a vegetarian dish that is pretty easy to prepare and one that meat-eaters will enjoy too. It's also a good weeknight dinner.

There are better eggplant / pasta recipes out there. Even with the fresh oregano it was just OK...not stellar!

This dish is improved by adding other ingredients such as fresh mushrooms, olives, etc. I also found that fresh basil really makes this sauce so much more tasty.

I thought it seemed bland with so much pasta to flavor (I used rigatone) so I increased the red pepper flakes- big mistake, it was way too hot when I was done. I also cut up some fresh mozzarella balls and added at the very end which was good, but honestly didn't add much (except cost). Overall, easy ingredients to pick up, easy to make and feeds lots w/ leftovers for lunch. I'd make it again.

My Mom has made this recipe for years with just a couple of additions: sliced mushrooms, and browned and crumpled Italian sausage. Yummy!

I have made this dish often. I use fresh spinach pasta to complement the color of the sauce and use fresh basil instead of oregano. I would suggest using less olive oil and caramelizing the egg plant instead of frying it. Brown first and then slowly cook the eggplant in it's own sugars until it is cooked. Less greasy and the juices of the eggplant are not lost by taking it out of the pan. The addition of black pitless olives at the last stage makes this dish even better.

This was excellent. Very good flavor. However, instead of using fresh oregano I used 1/2 tsp. of dried oregano. I will make this again!! Great recipe.

1 lb of pasta was way too much for this dish. We ended up having to pick through the pasta to find the eggplant. Maybe, just maybe, this would be good if a half pound of pasta was used.

This is a wonderful sauce that i have been making for years. Great comfort food, especially in the winter. I agree its better to use a short tubular pasta to hold the sauce better. I add the eggplant back into the sauce before its done to allow the flavors to meld. I also use basil instead of oregano and top each serving with small pieces of fresh mozzarella - it melts nicely from the heat of the sauce.

I have not tried this, however, those that did should't have. They seem to have difficulty in reviewing the actual dish as given. Not satisfied at all with real deal. Most confusing. Yes, I will try it soon. G. Holt

My take...omit the oregano.....use basil.....dried palmfull is fine. No onion needed.....increase hot pepper flakes....voila. Spaghetti #9. Ps I use mushrooms instead of eggplant. YUM.

This was good but make it with a short tubular pasta, like rigatoni, because the linguine doesn't hold the chunky sauce properly.
