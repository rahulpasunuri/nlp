Very filling, great alternative to eggs, beautiful nutty taste.

I really liked this. I didn't have chives, so I used the green and white parts of one scallion. My husband said, "You could fool people with this." I think it's going into the lunch rotation.

I used to make this when I was in college. It's not egg salad and isn't supposed to be! I added green onions and used tumeric generously. It is particularly good on rice cakes. Looking forward to making it again.

Liked it even though it was a little on the bland side. I used garlic aoili instead of mayo. I bumped up the limon juice too and added a teaspoonful of balsamic venigar and added a teaspoonful of cracked pepper corns. I like the idea of adding relish as it does need "something". I just don't know what.

This was possibly the most bland and boring attempt at egg salad ever. REALLY did not like. Threw it all away. Will NEVER make this away. If I could rate this w/ zero forks, I would have.

This recipe was a great base recipe. As suggested, I added less mayo, and added a little bit of sweet relish, and mostly added the seasonings to taste. The end result was fantasic. I think I'm going to make it for my carnivore boyfriend to see if he even notices the difference.

This recipe is a good start for tofu "egg" salad. As many have said, I found it bland. Next time I will reduce the mayo (I used veganaise to reduce the fat) to 1/4 cup and add more spicy mustard for flavor. Also, the tofu has to be REALLY dry, so pat with paper towels or drain well with cheesecloth. I added fresh onion, green onion, garlic, and a little horseradish mustard, again, for flavor. Finally, whatever you add, if you let it sit overnight before eating, the tofu will absorb the flavors and it will taste stronger.

Relish is a must- i added maybe...5tbs...but its all to taste. otherwise, the salad is quite bland. onions are alright to add, but its definitely nothing until you add relish.

Reasonably tasty, but definitely NOT a substitute for egg salad! The second time I try this I'll add some cooked egg whites and chopped mild pickle. We'll see...

This was very good and very believable non-egg salad egg salad. My (meat-eating) boyfriend calls it a healthy sloppy joe. I was very pleased with the flavor, but next time I will add more mustard and/or salt--when I ate it with the bread, the flavor lost some intensity, which bummed me out. Eaten with a spoon or with a chip, it's perfect as is.

So good! I love this recipe! It makes a great dip, too. I wouldn't change anything. I use vegan mayo to cut calories; regular mayo is so bad for you!

It was ok. Flavor could have been bolder. I think I'll add onion or garlic powder next time.

This is a yummy, healthy and easy to make dish especially for vegetarians but carnivores would enjoy as well!

I like this as an option for a healthy lunch. I always use low-fat mayo, and definitely add relish for flavor. I've also found that it is important to use firm or extra firm tofu, and I use a hand potato masher instead of a fork. I've made multiple times and will keep it on the rotation.

Will definitely make again. A refreshing change of pace and easy to prepare. Didn't have tumeric so I used curry. Added cayenne pepper to taste, sliced green onions, and capers.

Ummm... not terribly impressed... I'm a huge curried egg salad fan and this recipe could not cover up the bitterness and rubbery texture of the firm tofu.

i have a similar recipe to this that i really like. it's only got 1/2 tsp of tumeric so it's not so overwhelming. also, it has a few teaspoons of prepared yellow mustard, a couple tablespoons of dill pickle relish, and a tsp of white vinegar. i think those ingredients really perk it up a bit (i had to increase the amounts of these items as it was). also some minced onion.

Not a bad substitute for the vegans or those allergic to eggs (using soy mayo). Needs a little spicing up for the adults, but is good as is for the kiddies, and I did find this one under a healthy snacks for kids feature.

This wasn't bad. However, I really like tofu for its own sake. I don't know if this is a viable alternative to egg salad - I still love me some egg salad - but it's another good choice for a sandwich filling. I like the idea more than I liked this recipe. As it is, it's pretty bland. Curry powder; maybe a little cayenne; some capers. I think I could doctor this up quite nicely into something that would be good on its own merits, instead of a slightly insipid replacement for egg salad. Eggs are not that bad for you anyhow, folks!

Great alternative for egg salad but with the added benefit of soy. I made this and brought to work for picky co-workers to try and they were impressed it was tofu and not egg salad.

To all you healthnuts out there: If you think this tastes and has the texture of real eggsalad, you probably also think that a veggy burger tastes like the real thing. I really like tofu but to use it as a substitute for an egg, no way.

Appearance and texture very much like egg salad. Not the taste, though. Taste of turmeric was very strong. Maybe just a little turmeric for color, and some curry powder would be like curried egg salad. Funny thing is I like tofu without its having to be disguised as something else.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. The second time, I used Soynaise in place of mayonnaise and added some fresh parsley, delicious and vegan. Yum!

This is a great substitution for egg salad. It tastes just as good, is healthier and is easy to make. This makes a great meal with chips and a salad and is perfect for the warm summer months

After making this tofu salad, it does taste like egg salad, i liked it very much. I am always looking for recipes for diabetics.
