Very tasty and not hard to do. Check them a little before 15 minutes for med. rare.

I LOVE this dish. It is so easy and so summery and so delicious. I use panko instead of regular breadcrumbs, but otherwise stick to the recipe.

mmmmmmm. This was so good. I did make one recipe of crust for 4 rib chops and wish I had made more. You must use fresh crumbs to get the full flavor with the mustard and butter. I could eat this over and over (and probably will!) Served with gorgonzola potatoes and roasted asparagus. Not a bite left over - everyone was happy (except for the dog, he was sad.)

I made this for my husband and we both loved it. I used Progresso plain bread crumbs and it made a nice crisp crust. I only had a little crumbs left after applying it to the chops. Can't wait to make it again.

if you like a thinner crust, definitley use panko bread crumbs. my crust was at least 2/3 thinner than usual

i love this dish. i like the extra think crust so much, i usually put it under the broiler for 30 seconds. the next time i make this i am going to use panko breadcrumbs.

This went over very well with my dinner party guests. It's fast, easy, and makes for a nice presentation. I made 3 veal chops using the amount of basil mixture called for and it seemed pretty perfect. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic too.

From the first bite to the last, this was incredible. I took the advice about too much crust, so instead of cutting back, I made 4 chops, which was perfect number for the amount of topping. I also used store bought bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand and I added another tablespoon of butter, so the topping was kind of pasty when I spread it on. It was delicious!

My husband would probably give it 4 forks. Flavorful, tender, an attractive presenetation, and easy. If you like veal, you won't be sorry.

Fresh basil coming from the garden now makes this dish even better. I have served it many times, always to rave reviews. Quick, easy, and foolproof. In my opinion, super just the way it is!

Delicious - with a little less of the basil crust. I served this with oven roated roma tomatoes (a dash of balsamic at the end), garlic roasted potatoes and steamed asparagus. YUM!

I've made this recipe several times and everyone has always loved it. Since Veal has so little flavor, the crust is a terrific compliment. I also make a filling similar to the crust and stuff tomatoes on the side in addition to a gruyere cheese potato gratin.

Way too pungent! Veal is mild as it is, but this coating just overpowers the dish. I won't even try to modify it for a future attempt! No way will this dish ever grace my pans and oven again!

I also found that the basil topping was a bit too much. I will try this again and maybe cut the topping by half or so.

Clora, you may want to add some prepared horseradish in the jar.

I would like to make this for someone who is allergic to mustard. Any ideas from fellow cooks on what I could use in place of mustard? I appreciate all the reviews.

I agree with the previous cook that the crust was too thick. The crust overwhelmed the chop...which I thimk was somewhere underneath.

Rating: 2
This was wonderful flavor, but I felt that there was too thick a crust- It would have been better with a smaller amount of bread crumb crust. I disgarded much of the crust.

This is a very simple recipe that produces succulent results. The veal cooked perfectly, lightly pink, moist and tender, and the topping was absolutely delicious. First-rate!
