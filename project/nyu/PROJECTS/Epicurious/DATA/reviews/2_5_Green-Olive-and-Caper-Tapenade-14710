Great snack with strong flavors. Great on toasted flatbreads, such as Kabul bread or toasted pitas.

Wild! I loved this recipe because I love capers and anchovies (which is what attracted me to the recipe in the first place). However, it had limited appeal amoung my guests. I guess the flavors were too strong for some of them.

I served this tapenade on thinly sliced baguette toasts with freshly grated parmesan cheese and everybody loved it. It´s excellent!
