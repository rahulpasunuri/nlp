I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! The combination of flavors worked for me and my family and my youngest son absolutely loved it. I might use less of the sausage next time, possibly dicing instead of slicing. Overall A+!

Delicious and easy. I added roasted potatoes( as suggested below) along with the zucchini. Everyone had seconds.

I thought that this was delicious. Instead of using zucchini, I sauteed potato slices.... I thought it made the salad very hearty. The vinagrette was awesome-- incredibly garlicy, but that's what I like. I would definitely serve this dish as part of a summer buffet when guests come over. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

A disappointment. There are steps missing in this good-sounding but inferior recipe. For example, we saute the zukes in the chorizo oil, then what? Elements of this recipe really don't taste that well together. Chorizo, chicken, and olives may sound like a nice combo but when tossed together in this way weren't very appetizing. And I'm stuck on those zukes. Sauteeing them, then putting them in a salad like this, leaves them smelling almost fishy -- and seeming like fish out of water. Also, this recipe calls for too much chorizo. In my opinion this strong-tasting, fatty sausage should be used as a garnish-like flavoring, not as a substantial chunk of the meal, as it is here. In addition, my handling of this recipe (and I made it as advised) left the salad soaking in dressing. Ugh. I tried this dish, my husband (uncharacteristically) passed on it altogether, and I dumped the leftovers.

Not bad, despite the fact that I could only get frozen zucchini.

This was lovely. I marinated the chicken in lemon and then grilled it and tore it into strips, which added a lovely additional flavour. Couldn't get baby zucchini so I cut a full-size one into about 8 pieces -- they ended up a bit raw, so you should probably chop it more. My partner and my fussy son both loved this.

This was a great salad, and very easy to make. I love chorizo, and the sausage adds a wonderful taste. I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I broiled some breasts while I was sauteeing the chorizo (be sure to cook the sausage on low heat -- it browns very quickly). And I used a regular zucchini, not baby ones. The zucchini was fantastic, and all of the flavors really came together in the end.
