Not too bad so far. I won't be home till late tonight so I prepped the sauce ahead. I'm hoping the flavors get to know each other a bit while it sits in the fridge tonight. Once it's reheated I might add a drizzle of heavy cream to smooth everything over. Might add some Italian seasoning blend too, just to give it more depth, as it seems pretty basic. I'm sure there are better recipes out there but for a family of 4 with two kids in sports on opposite ends of town and half of the family getting home after 8PM...quick and easy but still somewhat homemade is perfect!

Great quick dish. Made this with a whole roasted chicken from Vons. Very quick and easy meal. Made it with garlic bread and salad. I really didn't notice the basil even though we used the fresh basil. It really didn't seem like a vodka sauce but was more like an arrabbiata sauce. I will make it again. :) If you are expecting more of a vodka flavor, you need to leave out the pepper and add a cream.

I followed the recipe as written: A recipe can only be as good as its ingredients: pre-made marinara, canned tomatoes (even with roasted garlic) and shredded roast chicken make a pretty straightforward, acceptable quick meal, but I would not describe this as a sophisticated meal, nor would I make it again. It took me as much time to shred a roasted chicken as it would take me to chop onions, peel garlic, and make my own sauce from scratch from various kitchen staples and the produce drawer of my refrigerator. My family liked it, probably more than I did, but no one thought it was a great addition to my recipes.

I liked this. I made a quick marinara sauce from canned tomatoes instead of using packaged sauce. I don't like vodka cocktails, so this is a good way for me to use up an old bottle.

I've made this recipe a few times and it is always a big hit. I've had numerous people ask me for the recipe, which I was more than happy to provide. I tweeked the recipe just a little by adding diced tomatoes to the marinara sauce and I added heavy cream just before I added the chicken. YUM!

This was very good. Used roma tomatoes instead of canned and shredded parmesan. Definite hit and very easy to make.

This was so easy to make!! I added a tiny bit more vodka to give it more of a kick but totally awesome.

This is one of those wonderful pantry recipes that turns out a product to please even the most discriminating unexpected company. Or a "come on over for supper!" crowd. Everytime I make it, it is just a tad different. All depending on what is in the pantry & fridge. No chicken? I've found Italian sausage & shrimp are great. And---it's just great on it's own with a drizzle of good olive oil. Sometimes with ff 1/2&1/2 or not. Sometimes with anchovies, sometimes not. It's what's in the fridge. I'll bet tuna in olive oil would be good, as well. Hmmm! Love the Italian farm house flavors. So rustic. You have to know that what was in the larder was in the sauce. Any REAL Italian will tell you that this is what homecooking is all about. Want fancier? Pass on this one. Want comfort food? Give it a try!

I make this every once in a while. It's really really good! I usually don't have the marinara sauce, just use crushed tomatoes and season the sauce. It's delicious!

I had flagged this as a "leftover chicken" recipe, and made it last night with the rest of a beer-can chicken roasted earlier in the week. I was also glad to find a vodka sauce that didn't require cream! It was good; the vodka made the sauce tangy, and the pepper flakes gave it a nice kick. I ended up just using crushed tomatoes and not store-bought sauce, so added my own garlic and a little dried oregano as well. Fresh basil (used probably twice what was called for) was fantastic, don't skip it. Fiance said this would be better with a sweet italian sausage (turkey), but I thought it was great with chicken.

Easy and delicious. I used skinless split breasts...brushed with oil and lemon pepper seasoning and convection-roasted at 375 degrees. Made my own marinara sauce as that is what my family is used to, but also used the diced tomatoes in roasted garlic...added the half-n-half as well. Agree with the others that fresh basil is key. Will definitely make again!

This was easy and delicious. I make it all the time now. Fresh basil is a must, though. It's just not the same otherwise. I've made it with and without cream and it's great both ways. I also have used boneless chicken breasts sauteed with lemon Mrs. Dash instead of the whole chicken. Great for a weekday meal!

This was fast, easy, and delicious. I made it exactly as directed. The diced tomatoes which were available had garlic(not roasted) and basil. Of course I added the fresh basil. The red pepper flakes made the sauce nice and tangy. I will definitely make it again.

This was delicious and so easy. I added sliced black olives to the recipe and we loved it. I will make this one again. I was quite happy to find a Vodka Pasta that did not call for cream.

My sister made this for dinner the other night; very simple and tasty. The fresh basil is the key ingredient; don't use dried.

This dish was amazing! The fresh basil makes a big difference. I'd have to say it was the best vodka sauce I've had. To make the sauce a little richer, I added 1/2 a cup of heavy cream. Delicious!

This one was a bit disappointing. You can get twice as much flavor in the same amount of time if you use a few different and fresher ingredients .... My personal favorite for a vodka sauce is Rachel Ray's "You Won't be Single for Long Vodka Cream Sauce". Find the recipe at Food Network.com ..... Fast, easy, and guarantee you'll be drooling!!

This is a quick dinner, nothing extravagant. I would only make this again if I was in a hurry for a quick dinner. I don't think the vodka added any great flavor,actually I couldn't even taste it! Not a epicurious recipe for sure! More like a quick cooking recipe.

This was just so easy and so good that I had to say something. Pasta can be so boring, but this really isn't! The basil is key. I used half a rotisserie chicken to get two meals out of it.

Eh. After reading the reviews I was disappointed. It was only moderately tasty. There are far more interesting things to do with pasta, chicken, basil, and vodka.

A gourmet masterpiece it's not, but for what it is, it's delicious--and incredibly easy, especially if you throw the sauce together the night before, like I did, and add the chicken and penne just before serving. Usually I tamper with these recipes but I made this one just as specified. A previous reviewer wondered where this type of diced tomato could be found; it's a standard Heinz product and I had no trouble. This dish involves very little work and no waste, even if you have to buy the basil--you'll use all of it since a small plastic pack of fresh basil yields just about exactly 1/3 cup. Some reviewers complained that it was bland; mine was not, maybe as a result of pre-making the sauce; the pepper had a lot of time to infuse the dish. I will definitely make it again.

Quick and tasty. I roasted chicken breasts with salt, pepper, oregano and onion powder instead of buying a pre-roasted chicken, and used sun-dried tomato marinara. I also added about 1/3 c. half & half to make it slightly creamy. A keeper.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe and was disappointed because of all of the great reviews. The dish was too sweet for my taste - perhaps I might try using a different marinara sauce - I used Bertolli.

This dish is really incredibly tasty and incredibly easy. Sara Moulton might say the addition of vodka adds a depth of flavor the sauce; she'd be right. Add more red pepper for more kick. I served it with a mound of goat cheese and sprig of fresh basil. So yummy.

Although I was initially perturbed at not being able to find "diced tomatoes with roasted garlic in juice" (what normal supermarket sells this??) it ended up turning out very well with only using the standard diced tomatoes with a garlic-heavy marinara sauce. Also, since I was making half the quantity, I BBQ'd a chicken breast with lemon juice and pepper and added in some mushrooms and grilled red onion to substitute for the whole roasted chicken. Excellent results.

I made this back in June, when I rec'd the magazine. It is very easy to make, as the chicken is already cooked. It is a convenient dish to make, put in the fridge, and then come home after the kid's sport practice and reheat.

This is a great recipe. I drained the tomatoes and added fat-free half and half to the sauce to give it a creamier texture. I also suggest tossing a tablespoon of brandy in; it cuts the stiff vodka taste and complements the red pepper.

I could not believe how easy this recipe was and how good it tasted. I am really impressed by this website for finding recipes like this. I used Rao's marinara sauce which I think makes it all the better. Try this one. You won't be disappointed! Honest.
