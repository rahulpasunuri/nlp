Sometimes I'm making a recipe for the first time and I think, hmm, that's a weird quantity/ingredient. I should learn to trust myself. I was really overcome by the amount of onion in this dish and found it unpleasant. I like the idea of a non-sweet sweet potato souffle and may make this again with a small fraction of the onion, or a little shallot, and some lemon peel and thyme to complement the flavors without pummelling them.

I love this recipe! I have made it over the holidays at least 5-6 times. It is savory, so if you are looking for the sweet style sweet potato, this is far from it. I have made it with sweet potatoes, butternut squash, acorn squash, and even once with regular leftover potatoes! All turned out delicious when served with green salad and some type of meat. I love souffles and now make others on the site regularly.

This is definately a savory sweet potato dish and more sophisticated than something made with brown sugar, butter, and miniature marshmallows. It's fabulous as a side dish or meatless entree. I love this recipe and will include it in my fall and winter rotation!

as i was eating this, i couldn't help but wish i had made reagular mashed sweet potatoes with just butter and cinnamon. the grueyere and other flavors masked the sweet potatoes so that i couldn't even tell it was sweet potatoes i was eating. it's not bad, it's actually tasty, but i'm just not sure it's worth all the work unless it's a special occassion and you want something that tastes cheesy. it does look pretty though.

I wanted to make the sweet potatoes a little different this year. I'm a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but I really had a hankering for preparing them with cheese. I found this recipe and it sounded too good to pass up. It was! There was hardly any left over! It smelled as good as it tasted! And I read in one review that the person added a little nutmeg. Good suggestion! Will definitely keep this over the sicky sweet recipes for sweet potatoes.

This is absolutely the yearly favorite at Thanksgiving. I have succumbed to making 2 large Pyrex's full for this side dish, as my guests just eat it all and take even more home!

While this took a while to make, it was very simple to put together and delicious when right out of the oven. I cooked the potatoes ahead of time and mashed them so that when the time came to make the souffle, I stressed less.

I was skeptical. I'd never made a souffle, but I really wanted to try something other than that oh-so-sweet casserole that everyone's mom used to make. First of all, even though I had like 12 different side dishes in the oven when the souffle went in, it was perfect when I took it out. Gorgeously tanned, airy and light..And when the evening was over, it was undoubtedly everyone's favorite. The gruyere added a slightly nutty and sharp flavor, while the sweet potatoes were just sweet enough. I would definitely make this again, and not just for the holidays!

I LOVED this recipe! Of course I added a ton of nutmeg, salt and pepper and a pinch of allspice, all of which set off the sweetness of the yams (OK I used yams too, they have more flavor) wonderfully well, and I made it cheeseless. Next time I'll add the cheese! I intend to make this over and over as a unique vegetable dish.

Although not as put off as the reviewer from Georgia, I thought this recipe was incredibly boring! I won't make this again as there are so many really yummy soufflés out there -- like the gruyere and parmesan soufflé listed on the site!

My French mother-in-law put me in charge of cooking Friday night dinner for 12 at her house, so I needed a recipe to impress. Plus it had to work with the main course of breaded cutlets. Instead of the predictable mashed potatoes, I made this recipe, but swapped out 1/2 the sweet potatoes with yams, just cause I like yams. It rose like a traditional souffle, and I didn't know what to expect from the guests. As soon as my husband tried it he said, "Why don't you ever make that for me?" Next time I will keep only the sweet potatoes, because the yams lent a higher ratio of sweet to the sweet/savory taste. My mother-in-law insisted on getting the recipe from me and I agreed only after getting her to-die-for recipe for Brioche!

We all loved this dish. made it in individual ramekins along with our holiday dinner, everyone asked for the recipe. will definitely make again, maybe with regular potatoes just for a change.

The souffle looked just lovely and, while a bit time consuming, it wasn't difficult to make. The cook's in the minority here. I thought it was a bit too cheesy, could barely taste the sweet potatoes. Everyone else in the audience thought the flavors were well balanced and really enjoyed the dish.

Delightful! I appreciate the other reviewer's comments on this recipe. We thought the flavors were just great. Really very easy. I did substitute an aged gouda for the gruyere as I had gouda that needed to be eaten. Souffles are just a wonderful twist to old stand-by veggies, I used to be afraid to go here, thanks Epicurious!

yummy yummy & quite unusual. I was short on the onions (only had 2 measly green ones in the fridge) and it still turned out great. to the cook who was looking for the African American dish, the Gruyere should have been your hint that this probably wasn't what you were looking for! look for a sweet potato casserole with pecans on top & you may be much happier!

My Gourmet collection goes back to 1970, and I can't believe it took me this long to make something so delicious. I can only think that the reviewer from Georgia back in 1/01 who was so disappointed was perhaps anticipating something very different to feel as she did. I only know that my family loved it, and I'll certainly make this recipe again.

Great recipe - even sweet potato haters loved it. The tastes balance well. I've made it a number of times and each time I've made it I've given out recipes.

what a flop. my family was anticipated an african american traditional dish. this timid foray in the world of souffles was ... unique and a disapointment. only 1/2 of my family would eat it 80% wound up in the trash. on the up side it was very easy to prepare (my first souffle). this site would be advised to procure more than one recipe for "sweet potato souffle"

Wow, what a hit! I served the souffle in individual 3/4 cup ramekins (reduce the cooking time to 25 minutes) as the first course this Thanksgiving (2000) and every guest absolutely raved. I'll definitely make this again.

This is an amazing recipe. The gruyere and sweet potato combination is really wonderful. I used a combination of sweet potatoes and yams and it worked out great. It will be on our Thanksgiving table.

The combination of sweet potatoes and gruyere in the souffle is completely decadent. Has become our favorite souffle.

This was very easy and delicious. A wonderful side dish that I served with roast duck in an orange/walnut sauce. We had the left-overs today - microwaved - and it was still wonderful!

I live overseas and prepared this for an early Thanksgiving feast for my non-American friends. They were all bowled over by the sweet potatos! Definitely will become a family tradition.
