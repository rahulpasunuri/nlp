This was a delicious fish course for our seder -- light but extremely flavorful with a wonderful mingling of textures. I will do this every year.

Every single person ate every bit of this dish. It also looked beautiful on the plate. We used smoked whitefish from a deli and wild baby arugula. For the dressing we used lemon from our own tree and top quality olive oil. For such a simple recipe, high quality ingredients are a must - use the best you can find. My only change for next time would be to find a milder fish, maybe smoked trout. This is a keeper!

My future MIL was coming over for Pesach. Knowing she prefers light dishes, I thought this was perfect. The dressing, while a bit too simple (I added a touch of fresh garlic), did not over power the smokiness of the fish. This dish took less than five minutes to create! I loved the ease and health factor of this recipe. If you are looking for a future light dinner, this is a great recipe. If you are, however, looking for a "WOW!" factor, find another dish. I gave it two forks because everyone at the table agreed that it was "good" but nothing special.

What a hit! We used smoked blue fish and the saltiness of it was just phenomenal against the other flavors of the lemon in the dressing, the sweet licorice of the fennel and the earthiness of the greens-My family is grateful that we will NOT be having gefilte fish again!!
