This is a really tasty quick way to prepare lamb. As other reviewers have said, the salad is AMAZING. I even made extra dressing. We really enjoyed the flavors of the lamb rub with the coffee and cocoa. If you have a fatty rack of lamb with not much muscle meat, you might find - as others have said - that the portion size is a little small. Also, it took quite a bit longer than 14 minutes to get to 130 degrees. Not sure why that was, but just thought I'd mention it.

Four forks for the SALAD! I made this for Valentine's day last year and it has since become our favorite go-to salad. The blood oranges are as beautiful as they are delicious. Don't overdo the shallots (mincing gives too much flavor and ends up canceling out the sweetness of the oranges. If that happens, just add a little honey to the dressing. It'll bring the notes right back up.) I would use a different lamb recipe. While it was good, I think there are better recipes out there.

I usually coat my rack of lamb with a combination of mustard and rosemary. I was feeling adventurous and I decided to try something different. When I first read this recipe, i was put-off by the idea of ground coffee in the spice rub. I decided to try it anyway based on all the positive reviews. The result had a beautiful deep color and a really interesting flavor. My husband and I really enjoyed the meal although we both agreed that we slightly prefer the mustard/rosemary coating on rack of lamb. I didn't make the salad that went with the recipe although I will probably try it another time.

Initially, I didn't love the rub on the lamb but since my husband was so enthused, I plugged away. It only took 2-3 more bites and I realized that the lamb was still quite juicy and all the flavors really meshed (seared a great crust onto it--that really helped). The salad, ESP with the blood oranges is something even the arugula-hating hubster ate. Served with some goat-cheese smashed fingerlings. But my favorite lamb recipe is also from this site and it's the one with the port wine and kalamata olive sauce. To me, THAT one is supreme!

This resulted in the most tender, most wonderfully flavored rack of lamb I have ever made. I used a cast iron pan with tremendous success. My guests literally dropped their forks with widened eyes. It's THAT good. They loved the salad as well. I just used regular navel oranges. After reading the other reviews, I added a bit of lemon juice to the dressing, in addition to the orange juice. The meal was a huge hit, and I emailed the recipe to several friends.

it was ok both lamb and salad, nothing outstanding. I'll keep looking for another recipe for lamb.

This was very relatively simple to prepare, but it was very tasty and elegant. My only complaint is that it was such a light meal, more like a lunch than a dinner. I even made brown rice to help make it heartier, and my poor husband has had two bagels with cream cheese and a granola bar since dinner. So if you're athletes with big appetites like we are, double the amount for the lamb and add some carbs.

Just made the lamb, no salad. Absolutely delicious. I wasn't sure about the coffee, but it came through in the taste, not the texture and was great. We just loved this recipe.

The lamb was fantastic, though I think that's often a variable of the particular piece of meat itself. But following this recipe exactly yielded a fantastic tasting dinner. The salad, though, I would say was just average in taste, though great presentation--for both. We also had a couple of small red-fleshed yams. All good.

Delicious. I pulled the rack out when the thermometer read 130, but within 5 minutes the internal temp had crept above 140 and the lamb was on the medium side of medium rare. If you like your meat more rare, I would pull it at 127 or or less.

I only tried the salad but found it a bit boring...?

Superb. Really. I got a 6 rib rack of lamb at the local Halal butcher. Had some extra bone on it that I had to remove myself (but, hey, I only paid $4/lb for fabulous local lamb). Used the bones to make a half cup or so of stock that I added to the butter/thyme/garlic deglaze for a sauce. Used navel orange in the salad with meyer lemon juice for the vingegrette. Otherwise,l exactly as published here. It was fabulous. Great bass notes in the lamb and the sauce perfectly complemented by the salad. This is among the best recipes from epicurious of the many I have tried. Highly recommended. The perfect meal for two. Oh yeah. To the Toronto cook: Canola oil is rape seed. It's a made-up name based on Canada, where rapeseed oil is mainly produced, because people react badly to the real name. It's a neutral, unflavored, high smoke-point oil. If you don't want to use it for whatever reason (mainly it's almost all GMO), use grapeseed oil instead. Has all those features and is never a GMO product.

This was amazing. My boyfriend and I made it for Valentine's Day and we were completely impressed with ourselves. We served it over the Braised Lentils also found on this site, instead of the salad. This was very easy to make and delicious.

My hubby and I made this for our first Valentines day together. He had a blast watching the instructional videos and both of us were floored by how amazing the lamb and salad turned out. A perfect meal to make together but simple enough to manage on your own

THis was just terrific. I had leftover rub, so I'm going to use it on pork tenderloin/roast. I forget to add butter and thyme and don't think it was necessary. There was already so much fat in the pan. Salad is awesome...a keeper all by itself.

Made this for my husband's birthday since it was a perfect special occasion two person recipe and strangely had nearly all the ingredients on hand. I agree with every reviewer before me that this is a delicious and perfect meal. The only thing I found was that the rub made more than I needed, but its a perfect excuse to make this again! Served with roasted white asparagus and the accompanying salad. Followed recommendations to wipe out the pan before putting in the oven, which is probably a must to avoid a smokeout.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!! When I was first mixing the spices for the rub, I was a bit nervous about the overwhelming and nearly clashing scents. Still, I followed the recipe nearly exactly and it was incredible! The flavors melded together perfectly on the lamb, and the salad was a refreshing and beautiful accompaniment. My bf was blown away by this meal! As suggested by another reviewer, I too wiped down the pan before transferring it to the oven, and I also roasted the lamb for about 9 or 10 minutes (instead of 7-8) after adding the thyme and garlic. This worked out for a perfectly medium rare lamb. Served over basmati rice with Layer Cake malbec... so good! Also, I was surprised by how simple and quick the preparation was. I can't wait to make this again!

This is a terrific recipe--tastes like it came from a fine restaurant. The spice coating on the lamb is incredible! Don't worry about the rather long list of ingredients and involved instructions; the preparation goes quickly and it's definitely worth it! Coucous with currants and orange is a nice accompaniment.

The best thing about this recipe is the SALAD! Amazing.

This was just to die for. Had to use clementines in the salad, as blood oranges are not in season, but it was still dynamite. The lamb seasoning was wonderful - you couldn't pick out any one flavor, they blended together to create a whole new taste. I did have to wipe out the pan after searing the lamb, as the loose seasonings would have burned in the oven. Made the whole menu - everything was terrific

I'm a die-hard fresh mint soaker with lamb but this recipe was a wonderful diversion from the norm! Hubby raved about the salad dressing and the entire meal was fabulous. Shoulder chops are easier for me to obtain (and cheaper). This was my variation.

I was going to say the same thing, Toronto. A lot of people assume that canola oil is corn. It's a type of rapeseed oil, I believe. Didn't enjoy the overly toasted flavor the coffee brought to the dish. Thought it was overwhelming. I'll either omit it next time or use a milder flavored coffee, perhaps.

to cook in chicago.... there is no corn in canola oil.

My husband doesn't like coffee, so I made it with just cocoa, cumin, and pepper. I also used olive oil instead of canola (boo corn!). It was so easy, fast, and DELICIOUS! Plus it looked really impressive. Served it with green beans instead of salad.
