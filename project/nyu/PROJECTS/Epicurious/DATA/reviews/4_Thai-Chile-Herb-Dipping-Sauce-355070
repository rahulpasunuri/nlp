This is beyond delicious. I'm to the point where I want to keep some in my refrigerator all the time.

we liked it, glad I removed the seeds from the chilis I used... it was still a lot of heat. One adjustment I will have to make next time is to reduce the quantity of fish sauce. It was overwhelming. I imagine with the lime taste that the layers of flavor would show up better.

Excellent! I made it exactly as listed and served it as a dipping sauce for the marinated Thai-style pork spare ribs.
