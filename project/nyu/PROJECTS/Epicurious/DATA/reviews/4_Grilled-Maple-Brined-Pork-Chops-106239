This recipe was AWESOME. Based on previous reviews I did the following: 1) cut the brine in half. There was enough to brine 3 thin bone in chops and one pork tenderloin. 2) I cut the kosher salt in HALF 3) brined for 6 hours 4) rinsed the meat off. It was cold outside so I pan fried the pork and finished in convection oven. I also made the chutney and would highly recommend you do so. It really compliments the pork. I tasted the pork without the chutney and didn't find it too salty and could also taste the other elements of the brine. For those cople of people that thought it was too salty, adjust the brine and try again you won't be disappointed.

Are you supposed to add water to the brine mixture?

It was way too salty. I couldn't taste anything else except for the salt. I only used 1/2 kosher salt. I also only made 1/2 of the recipe. It was not worth the work. It was not bad but it wasn't good. The pork was moist. There are better recipes on this site. Honestly, it was a waste of good ingredients.

Wonderful taste and tenderness. I substituted gin for juniper berries at 2 tablespoons of gin for 1 tablespoon of juniper berries.

Oh man! This was absolutely fantastic! I dont(didn't)even like pork that much. I cut everything in half, was short on time, so I only marinated for 3 1/2 hours. Still, worked beautifully. Cooked on my Weber charcoal grill until 150 degrees. I let the pork rest and then used the drippings to add to a demi-glace(More than Gourmet). This is a great recipe. I also learned the benefits of an instant read thermomenter. I have always overcooked my pork in the past, which is why I never really liked it that much. This changes everything. This will be a dinner party menu in our home. Fantastic!

Halved the recipe and left out the cloves and juniper berries to brine a 3 lb pork belly. OUTSTANDING results - the entire belly was permeated with a sweet, mapley, salty, savory flavor. Half the recipe was more than enough - I imagine you could brine 12 pork chops in the amount I made. Really terrific.

A note on the salt. The salt to water ratio in this recipe is the same as a recipe by Thomas Keller in Ad Hoc at Home, however, Keller specifies that a cup of the brand of salt he uses translates to 5 ounces by weight. If you use Morton's kosher salt, it's more like 8 ounces per cup. I would recommend weighing your salt if you are making this recipe... Keller recommends 5 ounces for 8 cups of water.

I also forgot. I marinated 20 pork chops and doubled the recipe and had way too much. I think the recipe can marinate way more than 4 chops. If you use a container that is more vertical and pack the chops in, the marinade will go a long way.

Rating: 4
I have made this many times and it is always a hit. Do not skimp on the marinade time as when I only did 3 hours, it was much less flavorful. I have never had it be too salty. For those that have, maybe your using table salt instead of kosher or as others have pointed out already brined pork chops. Also, i use thick pork chops so that may make a difference. Has anyone used "fake" maple syrup? It does get to be an expensive marinde when doing this for a big crowd.

This is an awesome recipe. I do this on the boat quite often. I will cut down on the salt in the brine next time.

I have been making these porkchops for the past 3 summers and everyone that has them just raves about them! When I go to Sam's, I buy 2 - 3 packs of their thick boneless chops, brine them and then freeze them to have on hand for an 'oops, someone is coming over and I have nothing ready' day. They go well with the Orzo Artichoke salad.

This was delicious. Don't worry about making the chutney the day before. I made it just before eating and it was great. I cut the salt and sugar in half and will cut it in half again next time -- down to 1/4 cup each. At 1/2 cup each the chops were too salty. Served with mashed sweet potatoes and wilted spinach. Num num

Absolutely incredible! You know it's a winner when a dozen "meat & potatoes" men give kudos to a meal. Please try this recipe, my husband and others said it was the best pork chop they had ever had. I ordered 1 & 1/2 inch, bone in chops from the butcher. Since I was cooking for a crowd, I doubled all the brining ingredients except for salt which = to halving the amount (I used Kosher salt). Double the quantity was more than sufficient to brine 16 huge chops. I skipped the juniper berries and added bourbon instead of gin. The deep, rich taste of the bourbon paired really well with the other flavors. The day before the big lunch,I brined the 16 chops for 4 hours then partially grilled them over a charcoal fire with hickory wood chips until they were a nice brown color but not cooked through. The next day, I finished them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes for the 1 & 1/2 inch chops. Watch them close and don't overcook! Wow, incredibly flavorful, juicy and tender! I paired this with Tyler Florence's Potatoe Gratin (Real Kitchen) and my own green beans (sauteed with onions, red wine, beef broth and bacon). I'm going to do as others suggested next time and freeze the extra brine when I make this for just the two of us. Definitely won't be letting this recipe get away. Try it!

These pork chops are WONDERFUL! I had to go with a few substitutes due to availability: dried thyme and powdered ginger, skipped the juniper berries and added 2 capfuls of brandy. We read the reviews and only brined for three hours since our chops had added "solution", and they were a tad salty, but the flavor was fabulous! We will know next time to use chops from a butcher shop with no added salt. This paired wonderfully with the Spicy Orange Salad. YUM! I can't wait to try again with the berries and fresh ginger & thyme. This is definitely a keeper.

Fabulous! Takes pork chops to a whole new level. I took them out of the brine and refrigerated for a day before cooking (unexpected dinner out), and they were still excellent. My new favourite pork chop recipe!

Rating: 1
How I wish I read the reviews before I made this. I left the chops in the brine for 7 hours and "too salty" is putting it mildly. That says a lot from someone who is often accused of being salt addicted. I suspect the flavor would have been enjoyable with an appropriate amount of salt but I am not about to make it again to find out.

I have used the brine recipe for not only pork, but for my Thanksgiving turkeys. The turkey has an amazing flavor and the skin is a gorgeous & crispy thing to behold. Owning a small country Inn in Southern NH, our Thanksgiving Dinner for over 200 people would not be complete without this wonderful turkey variation. I also portion off a gallon of the brine before I add the turkeys ( we brine about 10 turkeys in large trash cans we used just for brining) and reduce to about a quart, strain and carefully (very salty) add the reduction to my vat of gravy - WOW! Talk about flavor. I will keep this recipe forever.

First off: Brining pork chops (with any brine) is awesome. So, juicy and flavorful. But the maple brine was perfect. I cut the maple syrup by 1/4 and used maple flavoring to save on cost. I think it gave it even more maple flavor.

Four forks without a doubt! I can't rave enough about this one--my husband and I have never been able to successfully grill moist pork chops until using this recipe. Simply fabulous! Made a few changes--cut down the salt to 3/4 cup and cut out the juniper berries. Added 2 tbsp of bourbon--a nice compliment to the maple flavor. This one's a keeper!

Rating: 3
This is delicious. I followed the suggestion of fellow cooks and reduced the salt to 1/2 cup. It was not salty at all. Also used 2 Tbsp gin in place of juniper. I grilled pork for the first time tonight- and it was juicier & more flavorful than any pork that I have ever made.

Rating: 3
I have made this recipe several times and it is usually wonderful... however the saltiness did vary with the "brand" of chops used. Many pork products are "injected with a salt solution" to maintain tenderness - essentially pre-brined by the company. I think this may be the problem for those who find it too salty. Check your labels and decrease the salt substantially if it already has salt added.

Rating: 2
Too salty. To reduce the salty taste, reduce the amount of time in the brine, not the amount of salt.

Followed the recipe to a "T". The Best Pork Chops we ever had! A symphony of flavors matched with the pear salsa and braised red swiss chard.

Wow what a knock out! Did reduce the amount of salt (1/3c) and used gin instead of the berries. Left the pork in the brine for 6 hours and it was perfect. Added wood chips to the charcoal and left the pork on the grill for about 8 minutes + resting time. Served with baked potatoes and roasted veges, we had a smashing dinner!

So awesome. Easy and delicious. Also did 1/2 salt. Will definately make again.

Good recipe - I agree on at least halving the salt content. I did so, and soaked for about 7-8 hours, was plenty salty, ( and I LOVE salty,) so next time the only adjustment I'll make is down to 1/3 the amount of salt called for - otherwise a nice, nice brine.

What an amazing brine! Halved the recipe (using kosher salt) as suggested and still thought it was a bit salty so I may third it next time. The pork chops were moist and wonderful and the pear chutney was the perfect accompaniment. With the left over brine I marinated chicken and shrimp (obviously for much less time than the pork chops) and everything tasted great. Definitely a keeper!

Kept pork chops moist. Halved the salt as recommended in previous recipes. Marinated for 11 hours-that maybe a little too long. Edges tasted too salty and a little like ham. Probably will try a different recipe next time.

I followed previous reviewers advice and cut salt by 1/2 and used gin instead of juniper berries and had enough brine for 12 pork chops. I served with the pear chutney (be sure the include the mango)...which is really what makes the dish special. A great, easy, make ahead of time dish for company!

Used 3# of partially frozen lean pork loin. Used equal amounts of kosher salt and sugar. Next time will reduce salt further to .5 cup. I didn't have juniper berries so don't know what flavor element was left missing. Curious that some sub'd gin. Is the taste similiar? Only had ground cloves so I used 1t. Dissolved sugar and salt mixture in 4c. of very hot water, added herbs and aromatics, then topped off with 2c. of cold water. Grilled for apprx. 25 mins. on medium/low heat to internal temp of 140F. Let meat rest for 10 mins. before slicing. The brine lent a delicious flavor to the meat albeit too salty. Will use a less lean cut next time around.

Rating: 3
Highly recommended! Suggestion: cut down on the total brine (you probably only need half of what the recipe says) and then further cut down on the salt, by another third or so. Should still be enough to produce the brining effect, but with hopefully less of a salty flavor. Also, I made a lot of substitutions based on what I had a around the house, and left some stuff out (like juniper berries)...it was fine, and saved me a trip to the store.

Rating: 4
These were fantastic. I followed the suggestions and used half the salt. Had a dinner party for eight - made the marinade 8 days before using (to save time), purchased 1 1/2"+ thick chops and marinated for 9 hours, grilled for 20 minutes. They were UNBELIEVABLE! The 8 of us can't stop talking about them and the Pear Chutney.

Rating: 4
I'm a longstanding brining devotee for chicken, but had never tried it for pork. These were really delicious. The garlic and aromatics add a nice, vaguely ham-like flavor. Based on my past brining experience, I cut down on the salt slightly (3/4 c.) and marinated the meat for only 3 hours...longer and it would've been too salty and too hammy. Didn't try the chutney, but I'll bet it or any sweetish, fruity accompaniment would be an excellent match.

Rating: 2
I don't know why I didn't read the reviews before I made it-- I just saw that everyone loved it, so I tried it. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was WAAAAYYYY too salty for us. I agree, salt should be cut in half. I found it so salty that I couldn't taste any of the other flavors, but the brine smelled so robust-- garlic and mustard, etc. So, I was disappointed. I may try it again with half the salt and see if the flavors emerge more as a result.

Will I make this again? YES, YES, YES! These were, without a doubt, the best pork chops I've ever made or ever eaten. Like other reviewers, I'd cut the salt by about half. All other ingredients were there in perfect amounts. Ymm, ymm. Can you tell how much we liked these?

This recipe was delicious, although I agree it was a bit too salty (and I did use kosher salt). Next time I would cut down the salt a bit. Made as written, except substituted 1/4c gin for the juniper berries. Pork was tender and flavorful. I served it with potatoes, grilled asparagus, bread and salad and in-laws were impressed!

I sort of did my own thing with this recipe. I quartered everything(except I used about 3 cups of water.) I used those thin cut pork loin chops and marinated for 45 minutes. I did not cook my marinade and used dried herbs. I also fried the chops up in a grill pan on the stove. It came out very tasty. Don't think there's anyway you could go wrong with this recipe other than maybe making it too salty. 45 minutes was all that was needed since I had such a thin cut of meat.

I have made this dish several times, and it is a staple in my house. After experimenting with many different recipes over the years, my boyfriend and I both agree that they are the best pork chops that I make. I use kosher salt and I don't find it too salty. I use the bone-in pork chops, gin instead of juniper, and I never have fresh herbs so I use dried and it is fine. I cook them in a hot iron skillet for about 2-3 min. per side and put them in a 350 oven for about 5-10 min. Delicious and juicy!!

Rating: 4
We loved it! A few tips: 1. Definitely get boned-in chops. Bones keep the meat more moist, and gives more flavors. 2. For 4 big double-cut chops (3.7 lb total), 3/4 of the brine recipe is enough to cover them all. I used a plastic container of 3 QT. All fit snuggly. 3. Whatever amount of the brine you make, do CUT the salt at least in half. I did that, plus 11 hours, and still thought it could be a tab less salty. 4. Brushing them w/ veggie oil b4 grilling gives the chops great grill marks and good caramelization. Don't skip it or use olive oil (which has lower smoking point.) 5. Let the meat rest (tented w/ foil) for 4~5 minutes afterwards. Even if the meat close to the bone looks pinky, "resting" will continue to cook it w/o the rest drying out. 6. We did it indoor on a grill pan first: 1.5 min/side, 4 min standing on the bone side. Then off to 375F oven for first 5 min standing, then 8 min more laying down.

I followed the recipe exactly except I marinated 6 chops for 8 hours. Used kosher salt and fresh herbs, the chops were too salty for my taste. Will make this recipe again but will use less salt. The chops were very tasty and moist! This is a keeper for grilling. The brine makes enough that you could easily brine 6 - 8 chops.

Pork was fantastic! I made it with tenderloins and I will never go back to my old recipes.

I used pork T-bone cuts for this, and seared it in a hot fry pan and convection baked to the correct internal temp instead of grilling and it came out absolutely delicious. The recipe makes enough brine for twice as much pork as listed, you can halve the brine quantity.

This is the second time I've made this. Followed it exactly, both times. These are (without a doubt) the best pork chops I've ever eaten! I'm not sure why the other reviewes felt they were too salty. It could be, they did not use Kosher salt. There is a huge difference between Kosher salt and table salt. When followed exactly as written (no rinsing) there is no reason to change one thing about this recipe. It is perfect as is.

This is the greatest pork chop recipe ever. I've made it several times. The first time, I followed the advice of others and cut the salt in half. Don't cut the salt in half, just make sure to use kosher salt. Fresh herbs are key. And brine for 10 hours. I omitted the juniper berries, and didn't use the sauce. And use a meat thermomiter for perfect chops. 145 degrees. I will make this again and again.

After reading the reviews, I was really excited to make this. An interesting and different way to prepare pork and it adds a lot of flavor. Next time I'll use a little bit less salt (and I even decreased the amount by half as suggested!).

I took the advice of some previous reviewers and halved the amount of kosher salt. Also, I had to substitute a few things: dried rosemary and thyme for fresh, a little allspice for the juniper berries, and powdered ginger for fresh (though normally I do have fresh gingerroot around). The SO has proclaimed this recipe "a keeper." The chops were tender, juicy and very flavorful. My five-year-old didn't care for the spiciness, so I thought maybe I could set aside a small amount of the brine before adding all the seasonings, and brine a chop for her in that.

I halved the salt after reading the reviews, and used 1/4 cup gin as a substitute for the juniper berries. Very juicy and turned out perfectly.

I did not make the chutney, but served it with mashed potatoes, steamed brocolli and garlic bread.

Be sure to use Kosher salt when brining, it makes a huge difference. While these chops were a little salty, the taste was superb. I may reduce the salt a little the next I make them and will grill them, too. They cooked beautifully in my convection oven. I used allspice instead of juniper berries due to things on hand. I agree with the reviewer regarding halving the marinade for the chops.

Tried this again using half the amount of salt (since we found it to be too salty for our tastes). Believe it or not, we still thought it was a little too salty. Next time we will reduce it even more. Even with the reduction in salt, the chops were much more tender, juicy and flavorful than "regular" grilled pork chops.

Reminiscent of the scent of corned beef. This process did a beautiful job of tenderizing the pork and adding a sensational flavour. I did not change anything in the ingredients but I did follow the advice to rinse. I agree that it is VERY salty and will rinse the pork even more next time. I made and canned the pear chutney. My Bartlett tree doesn't give me Bosc; so with Bartletts it was just fine. The chutney is good with the pork but it really doesn't need it.

Rating: 4
Isn't it SALT that transforms a marinade into a BRINE? Anyway, I doubled the recipe and found that I had more than enough brine for 12 pork chops. I made once on a gas grill and once on a cast iron grill atop my gas stove. Both times I felt that cooking to 145 degrees had the chops way past pink (though still juicy and delicious). Next time I might not cook quite as long.

Rating: 4
I rinsed the chops very quickly before grilling them, and they were still quite salty. Next time I'll rinse them a little longer. Definitely make the chutney (I couldn't find bosc pears, so I used Asian pears instead)! It helps to balance some of the saltiness, and I used the leftovers with grilled chicken breasts a couple of days later. I used gin instead of juniper berries, which was a great suggestion from another reviewer, and I used 2" center cut chops, which were very generous but just too much for me. Next time I'll use 1.5" center cut chops instead.

Rating: 3
Good dish, albeit too salty as written. We did not make the chutney either, so we can't comment on the combo. Next time, we'll definitely: 1) make less brine, or save some for later 2) halve the salt. We brined 4 chops for about 7 hrs , and grilled them over charcoal. Perhaps using previously frozen chops makes a difference in how the brine gets absorbed?

Rating: 3
Loved this brine! Well worth it. I too had no Juniper Berries and followed the suggestion for adding Gin. It worked. I would advise freezing half of this recipe and then using the other half to brine the meat. It makes a lot and is a shame to throw it out when you are done. I used it with pork chops but will try next with tenderloin.

Rating: 4
I truly enjoy this recipe...it makes pork absolutely fork-tender. I've used it on whole pork loins to raves. There is only one minor thing I change... I briefly rinse the pork after brining... if I don't it's just a little too salty for me. But other than that...it's wonderful!

Rating: 4
In response to the concern about the salt, I halved the salt, and the pork was perfectly brined. It was more tender than any other pork I have ever had! I doubled the pork and brine amounts to serve 8 people, and wonder if doubling the pork (but not the brine) would have sufficed. Doubling the brine makes a HUGE souppot full, and then to discard it, seemed wasteful. Any thoughts? I made the pear chutney, and it was a lovely addition.

Rating: 4
I made this for an Oscar watching dinner party with good friends. Every one rated this outstanding and I will add it to my "make it often" list. I didn't have and couldn't locate juniper berries on short notice, but I did have about a 1/2 cup of Beefeater Gin (made from juniper berries) so I added that to the brine! I used 2-inch thick center cut boneless loin chops and cooked them indirectly on a Weber bar-b-que and added a few water soaked hickory chips to the coals to add some smoke as well. They were perfectly cooked, tender and moist after 40 minutes. I was a little concerned that they might need a little sauce, so I made the garlic sauce found in the "CHINESE BARBECUED PORK WITH GARLIC SAUCE" on this site. I sliced the chops diagonally about 1/4" thick, and plated four or five slices with the garlic sauce drizzled down the center. It was very good with the sauce, but was also perfectly moist and flavorful without it.
