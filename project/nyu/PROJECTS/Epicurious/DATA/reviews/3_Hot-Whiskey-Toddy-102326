Delicious with rum or whiskey. Stir it with a cinnamon stick and add a few whole cloves for a nice mellow kick.

Used Morgan's rum; a simple, warming drink with straight-forward, delicous taste. A keeper; we'll try with other flavors as well.

sounds yummy, but I would replace the sugar for honey and heat with frother. Now that's delicious!! Good for a chest cold.
