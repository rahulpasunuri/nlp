This vegetarian stuffing was a huge hit at our extended family Thanksgiving, and not just by the vegetarians! I used some vegetable broth to moisten it for the reheating. Followed the recipe with fresh portabellas and dried shiitakes (what I could find.) Only one stick butter. Outstanding!

Love this stuffing! Never gets dried out. It's good that you don't reduce all the liquid and can even add the mushroom liquid too. It is so flavorful. I wouldn't change a thing!!!

I made this as directed, but forgot the egg. Never missed it, never added it in subsequent times. We are a red wine family by-and-large, so when i didn't have enough white wine i used Boissiere, a lovely dry vermouth that added another layer of complexity to the flavors - this is a fun recipe to play with. A family favorite.

This is the best recipe ever. I always use it to stuff my turkey(about 12 poundS) and you can double it with ease (probably a good idea since everyone wants more). I use 1/2 cup of rainwater Madeira with 1&1/2 cups of wine since I use Madeira in the gravy. Here is the BEST part. The next day, grab a Kaiser roll, buttered. Put a big spoonful of this stuffing, and some turkey slices, a little mayo, and a spoonful of your favorite chutney on the roll. I have made this sandwich with many different stuffings, but the mushroom is the BEST. There is rarely enough to spice the soup.

I make this for Thanksgiving every year. People have said it's the best stuffing they've ever had. You just can't go wrong when wine, butter, mushrooms & thyme come together! It's also excellent with toasted walnuts mixed in.

Smelled delicious while cooking, but I was concerned that the mushroom liquid didn't cook off. Needn't have worried, the bread soaked it up and I even added more of the porcini water. I used gluten free soft crust white bread, but even then, it was absolutely delicious!

Disappointing! I made this for a dinner party and it was a bomb. The wine gave the mushrooms--which were delicious when I first sauteed them with the butter, garlic, and thyme-- a sour flavor (Maybe I used the wrong kind of white? Maybe I didn't reduce it enough?) and the whoile thing was kind of mushy. Thank god I made a bread stuffing as well.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I doubled the leeks and used a greater variety of mushrooms (some hen-of-the-woods and oysters).

Rating: 4
I used this recipe as a base recipe. I added dried chanterelle mushrooms with the porcinis and I re-hydrated them in chicken stock. I also steeped the shitaki stems in the stock afterward to give it an even more intense flavor. I added some oyster mushrooms to the mix and used a rustic baguette. It was an awesome dish and everyone loved it. I would consider adding another egg if I made it in the future.

Rating: 4
I keep trying to look up other stuffing recipes and fool myself into thinking that I can go without this one-- but I just can't! A thanksgiving staple in my family for the last few years. I have only been able to achieve the nice browning that you see in the picture by switching to 5 (closley watched minutes) on broil after the 40 minutes of baking. And in some batches I have added another egg if more moistening is needed. I also like my bread in slightly smaller pieces: I basically cut the baguette in quarters LENGTH-wise all the way down and then cut perpendicular, 1/2 inch slices.

I am not a vegetarian although I have an admitted mushroom fetish. This dish satisfies all my latent mushroom cravings as it is absolutely delicious. Even people who dislike mushrooms will love the earthy intensity of this dish. It actually reminds me of a dessert due to the texture and density of the dish.

This is a perfect recipe! I did substitute a bunch of ramps for the leeks and left out the garlic (since ramps are garlicky). And I ran out of white wine so I used about 1/2 cup dry sherry to the 1 and a half cups of white wine I had on hand. Most delicious stuffing ever.

Enjoyed the flavors in this stuffing very much! What's not to like? The stuffing did end up trying out a bit, more like really flavorful croutons - but I added more stock to the second batch and it was great. Great if you love mushrooms

Big hit at Thanksgiving. Added parmesan cheese at the very end and sprinkled on top of the casserole dish to add some extra flavor. This was really more of a "mushroom delivery device" than your Grandmother's stuffing recipe. Next time, I am going to add just a bit of sausage. . . .

This is absolutely wonderful. I made it for Thanksgiving today and it was a big hit. However, next time I would not use shiitake mushrooms but would substitute portabellos. Also, I would use a very thin baguette - a ficelle - and cut the pieces into cubes, for better blending with the mushroom mixture. The ficelle has more surface area that is crust, which will make the whole dish crustier and even more delicious than it is already. A real winner.

I couldn't find dried porcini mushrooms, so I used dried shitake and fresh portabello and button mushrooms and I can't imagine it turning out any better! It was moist, beautiful and savory. I served it as part of a thanksgiving dinner and it was my favorite dish. I may have to make it again just for myself!

This stuffing is AMAZING! I made it this year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. We barely had leftovers of it into the weekend. It's probably better to use less better, but it made it so delicious. I agree with the other reviewers that the combo of the leeks and mushrooms was great. I will make this over and over again. DELICIOUS!!!

Absolutely delicious. I subbed half chanterelles and half royal trompet mushrooms for the shiitakes and used creminis instead of the button. I added about 1 TBSP freshly chopped sage and parsley along with the thyme and mixed turkey stock with half the porcini liquid. The next night we were a little tired of turkey so I made a frittata out of the stuffing and used the leftover madeira gravy as an extra sauce. Yum!

this is the best stuffing i've ever tasted. i usually use button and portobello mushrooms to save $$. i also cut down the butter to about 1/2 cup and use olive oil as needed. we brought this as a vegetarian option to a family gathering a few years back and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. now we crave it constantly...

A superb recipe that has become a staple of our holiday meals. If you don't love mushrooms, then stay away; but if you do, you will probably love this dish. We usually bake it a day ahead, then reheat it before serving; this seems to give the flavors some time to settle in. We use baby portabellas instead of the button mushrooms, and ALL of the procini soaking liquid, which gives it a very rich, earthy flavor. Also, we throw in some extra dried herbs -- thyme, rosemary, oregano, sage -- and some shakes of cayenne pepper. Delicious!

Rating: 4
I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and was very pleased with it. Instead of shiitake mushrooms I substituted baby portabellas. And I cut the bread about two times smaller than the recipe called for, based on previous reviers' suggestions. It came out wonderfully, and reheated well over the next few days.

Rating: 3
I really liked this. I used it to stuff the Thanksgiving turkey, but also served it baked on top of a large, flat mushroom, topped with a few pinenuts for the vegetarian at our feast. She seemed to like it a lot, and I thought it made a pretty centrepiece for her meal. I'm planning to egg and breadcrumb the leftovers and fry them in a little oil for a starter tonight (we only had our Thanksgiving meal on Sunday, by the way, it's not a holiday here!)

Everyone loved this at Thanksgiving and told me I had to make it next year. I would adjust the recipe by not adding the salt at all. It wasn't too salty with it, but i think it may taste a little better without it. I will definitely be making this again.

I don't think that this recipe lived up to its high reviews, but it wasn't horrible either. You have to REALLY enjoy mushrooms to appreciate this one! I made this for Thanksgiving, and I think my guests would have appreciated a more traditional stuffing (but that'll depend on who your guests are). I didn't have any shiitakes so I used baby bellas. I actually think that that was a good decision. Shiitkes are SO flavorful and there was too much mushroom flavor as it was. This recipe is a bit soft in texture, so be sure to slice your mushroom thick. I also recommend adding some crunch --- I threw some chopped walnuts on top and that really saved me. Next time I'll add some chopped celery too. It also was quite crumbly, and I like my stuffing to stick together more, so I recommend adding two eggs instead of one. I might make this again, but for a more sophisticted crowd... and I'll make a lot of changes.

Rating: 0
this recipe was delicious - hands down the best stuffing i've ever had. i used a variety of different mushrooms: portabellas, shiitakes, buttons. i did not have access to porcini mushrooms. the recipe calls for reserve liquid from soaking the porcinis. since i did not have any "reserve liquid" i just drained the liquid that came out of the mushrooms when i sauteed them and reserved that. when it came time to bake, i poured some of that liquid as needed over the stuffing and it was scrumptious. definitely will make it again. all my guests said it was the best stuffing they'd ever had.

This was delicious! We stuffed some Cornish game hens with it, then baked the rest in a dish. We couldn't find any button mushrooms, so we used brown, and it still tasted great! A little on the rich side though, I'd recommend not gorging yourself even though it's so good!

the mushroom flavor was wonderful but i felt it lacked seasoning so i used chicken broth instead of the mushroom soaking liquid. i also doubled the amount of spices. i served it for thanksgiving and it was good but the following night when served with leftovers, it was outstanding. i have no idea why but next time i might make it the day before!

I have made this several times for Thanksgiving and it's always a hit. I have made it as listed and added bacon on a few occasions. The mushrooms, leeks and bacon taste great together. But it's great the veggie was too.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was simply horrible. I only pick recipes from this site that have really good reviews and I've always agreed w/ everyone but this time---NO WAY! It was a mushy, dark brown, strange tasting mess. I had to throw the whole thing out--what a waste. I'm just thankful that it was only me and my boyfriend this year. If we would have had guests I would have been mortified.

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious. We used half of it in the turkey and the rest on the stove top, and both were still excellent. The mushrooms and the leeks really added to the flavor but wasn't too overpowering. This is a very well-rounded and flavorful dish.

This was a great vegetarian stuffing option. Two caveats though: cut the bread MUCH smaller than the recipe calls for if you don't want large chunks of baguette bread in the final product. The bread doesn't really get smaller, so what you cut is what you get. Second, I used dried shiitake mushrooms (couldn't find fresh ones for less than $16/lb). When I make this again, I'll probably use a few fresh or dried shiitake if they're available (though I would dice the rehydrated dried version, since rehydrated mushrooms don't break up the way fresh ones do), but I don't know if that's necessary. I think that sticking with the fresh buttons and dried porcinis (I found bags of dried, sliced porcinis at Trader Joe's, so they didn't even need to be cut) would be enough mushrooms for the recipes. Other than cleaning and cutting mushrooms, this is also an easy recipe.

I loved this stuffing! I did change one thing; I didn't want to use dried mushrooms and porcinis were not in the store so I subbed chantrelles. They pretty much disappeared but left their flavor behind. I liked the baguettes in the stuffing and will remember that for other recipes because they did not mush down like regular bread.

My whole family loved this stuffing this year and last. I used homemade pumpkin bread instead of french baguettes and I think it made a big difference. It's very easy to make and much of it can be made ahead of time.

this is just a note to the user who doesn't know what DRY WHITE WINE is : DRY refers to the residual SUGAR content - the drier the wine, the LOWER the sugar content. chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are just two examples of the many delightful dry whites you have to choose from...i hope this helps!!

I made this for the family Xmas dinner and it was fantastic. I should have doubled the recipe as there was almost nothing left - and we only had 10 people. I'd also cut the bread smaller for next time as it felt a little big but everything else was delicious. Rave reviews at our dinner.

I adjusted the recipe because I didn't have as many people as the recipe called for, and because I procrastinated, I couldn't find porcini mushrooms! But it still turned out amazingly well (though was a fair amount of work). It ended up being like a mushroom bruschetta, with all of the butter and mushroom juices saturating the bread. Not healthy, but delicious. Everyone loved it.

A very tasty stuffing if you love mushrooms (like me). It does turn out rather loose, not mushed together like typical stuffings. People didn't think that it really looked like stuffing, but they did like the flavor. I think it could use a little more liquid and egg to bind it together. I'm also going to try adding some apples next time for more texture and another layer of flavor.

A lot of work and pricey ingredients, but an excellent stuffing. I closely followed the recipe. The only thing that I did different is rather than bake it in the turkey or in a larger sized baking dish, I used a 9 inch diameter soufle dish.

Great recipe -- I made a few changes that worked very well. 1) fine to use shitakes and others without the dried porcinis if you don't have it. 2) use chicken stock in place of the soaking liquid. 3) add toasted pine nuts and chopped apricots. Made it even better!

I'm making this for the third Thanksgiving in a row. It's my favorite dressing recipe! I bake mine in a separate dish, and it really does stay moist and delicious if you add the extra soaking liquid to the recipe. I use chicken stock as the mushroom soaking liquid to add extra flavor, and the drippings from a roast chicken that I have in the freezer will boost it even more. I've gotten raves each year I made it!

This was a super-bland stuffing...nothing truly gourmet about it. While, I'm a mushroom-lover, the way the mushrooms were prepared in this recipe did very little to bring out the intense flavors of the porcini shrooms. The French Baguette used in this recipe was boring and again, bland. Don't waste your time with this one. Sadly, I did.

Edible, but not the best stuffing I've ever had. I found that the mushroom flavour was too strong, and the overall impression at our dinner was that this stuffing needed something to balance it out - perhaps more fresh herbs? I won't be making this again.

I was afraid the baguette wouldn't hold up in the stuffing, so I toasted the baguette slices in a warm oven before combining with the other ingredients.
