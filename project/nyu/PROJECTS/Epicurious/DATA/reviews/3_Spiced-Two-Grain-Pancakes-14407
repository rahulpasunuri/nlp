These were good and quite substantial. As others mentioned, the flavor is like gingerbread. The taste is great with the maple syrup on top. I think I prefer a plain pancake, though, so I don't know if I'd make again.

Just made them, and am eating as I type. Super easy for morning cooking and really yummy. A nice change from the same old pancakes. Tastes almost like a warm, soft, gingerbread cookie.

Smash up some banananananas and throw them in the mix too. Life is too short, experiment and eat lots of pancakes.

Nice blend of flavors: the earthy grains and the zing of the spices.. I found that these pancakes were rather dense, but it was a unique experience.

These pancakes are lovely and apparently impossible to ruin. I've made them a number of times and most recently substituted rice milk and corn oil for milk and butter (had a lactose intolerant guest) - they still came out high, fluffy and delicious. Highly recommended.

I thought these were very good. They came out thick and fluffy with a wonderful flavor! I followed the recipe exactly. I would definately make these again! Maybe next time with blackberries on top!

This is a breeze if you just throw everything in the blender, and melt the butter in the microwave.I have added flax seeds, and on occasion substituted oat bran for the wheat germ. It's always terrific and I find they are even tasty munched cold from the fridge. More than you can say for a regular pancake! With warm maple syrup and sliced pears and bananas on the side, they can't be beat.

Yes, it is a bit of work but it is worth the effort. These pancakes have a wonderful light texture and great taste. I make them often and my entire family gobbles them up!

I enjoyed them but I wouldn't make them again. Too much work and too many ingredients. Not up to that in the morning.

A cold morning favorite at our house!! We especially like the oats being included!
