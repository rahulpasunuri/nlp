Delicious! Served this at a dessert reception and had another caterer ask me for the recipe! Garnished with raspberry sauce drizzle, fresh raspberries and powdered sugar.

I love this recipe! I have made it twice and it always receives rave reviews. I took other reviewers' advice and cut the powdered sugar down to 1 and 1/2 cups. Super sweet and delicious! Highly recommended.

Disaster! The cake mix "crust" ended up rising through the topping creating a sort of "sauce & cake" effect. The top got way too browned prior to setting up properly. I had to reduce temp to save it from burning. The taste was too sweet, not enough tartness. There are much better recipies for this sort of square out there. Won't attempt this one again.

I've made this dish now a couple of times a year for the last five years. One word of advice: If you make this once be prepared to be badgered to make it again and again. Here I am this Thanksgiving make it again even though I don't want to! (Otherwise my family will disown me.) Yes it's sweet as hell but oh so good. They last awhile because any normal human being can only eat one or two squares as they are as rich as anything you'll ever eat. But those one or two pieces will be great.

TOO SWEET!!!! If I would ever make this again, I would not use the boxed cake mix. I cut the filling down to 1.5cups of powered sugar, and remained too sweet.

This was a great do-ahead recipe. I have to admit I was wary when I saw the ingredients included a box of cake mix (I'm not sure that I've ever bought cake mix before!), but the squares were easy to make and a huge hit! I garnished them with a sliced strawberry on each and they looked great.
