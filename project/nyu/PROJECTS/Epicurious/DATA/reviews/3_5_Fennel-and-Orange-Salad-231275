I thought the salad was bland. Not enough punch to the fennel dressing. Adding red onions would have been a good idea.

I added a bit of very thinly sliced red onion as well...

I really loved this salad! Very refreshing for a hot summer night. I used a combination of romaine and baby arugula instead of radicchio and it was perfect.

It's an easy and refreshing salad. I like to added a little shaved Pecorino Romano cheese on top.

I made this as directed and divided by four, and it was attractive and delicious. Except for picking the pits out of the oranges (which come from my backyard so I can't go out and buy the seedless types)it was a snap to put together.
