Great recipe as is. Might add more orange zest next time.

My grandmother used to make this but never wrote down her recipe, so I tried this one. It's easy and delicious as it's written, but I also add some cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg (very little of each) as I remember my grandmother doing. The leftovers make excellently spiced breadcrumbs for swedish meatballs, too.

I'd never even heard of limpa before I tried this recipe. Didn't really like it as is, but think it has huge potential. My fatal mistake was not Grinding the spices- which I will next time, as well as cut down on the caraway, and up the orange. I'll probably try it with cardamon too.

The first time I had Swedish Limpa Bread (which is what I always call it) was in the late 60's at a week-end be-in. Maybe it was a music festival, like a mini Woodstock, I don't know. I just remember camping, cloudy weather, some guy standing naked in the parking lot, and this wonderful bread which some kind and creative girl had baked for the event. I never see it anymore, I have to actually make it to enjoy the bread again, but it is indelibly associated with that fun week-end. Ah, memories....
