They don't tell you how long you're supposed to bake it for!

hello, this recipe sounds very similar to Gratin Dauphinois from the Dauphinous region of France. I stayed there with a host family and they often made this dish with gruyere, onions and creme fraiche instead of cream. It was delicious. They also just stuck it straight in the oven from the beginnning and it took a long time but it was worth the wait.

A simple yet delicious traditional recipe! for a lighter result I usually cook the potatoes with some milk instead. Add a bit of grilled prosciutto and a clove of garlic for the taste.

I spent a long time making this dish, but when I was finished, it turned out the potatoes were gratin.

Yum. Had to use some serious will power to keep myself from eating the whole thing myself. It is quite rich, so next time I'll use half and half, and see how that is (maybe then I can eat it all?)...

These were ok. I used evaporate skim milk instead of cream to reduce the fat. There are so many gratins to try, we probably won't make this again

Excellent. Just got up from the table and decided to rate it. My wife and sister-in-law also thought it was good. I served it with "Orange Braised Chicken Thighs with Green Olives" from Epicurious (Gourmet December 1995) and they really complimented each other. I think the next time I try it I will make the slight change that Kristen mentioned.

A sophistacted and classic dish that my guests raved about. I added a little ground nutmeg and white pepper to the cream and warmed it slightly before adding to potatoes.
