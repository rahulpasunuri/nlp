If you are a fan of stone crabs, you know this is the best dipping sauce for them, as it complements the flavor of the meat, does not overwhelm it. This season has produced some sweet "stoneys", and Joe's Mustard Sauce never fails. Be sure to prepare ahead of time, as others have suggested.Viva Stone Crabs, viva this sauce. PS: If you get frozen or poor quality crab, well, nothing is going to help you there.

Love this sauce. Use it , of course, on crab claws and also dip boiled shrimp in it. Several places sell it in our area at #3.18 for 8 ounces.

I splurged on stone crabs today for my family and the mustard sauce was key. Having lived in South Florida I know mustard sauce and this was excellent! Let sit in fridge for about an hour prior to serving ideally.

This is, by far, the best stone crab sauce recipe. You can never make too much of this delicious sauce. It will make you feel like you are at Joe's on Miami Beach!

This is the "authentic" recipe from Joe's - until you've experienced dipping the succulent stone crab claw into it, you haven't lived. There's nothing better!! Also very good with any shell fish. Important to chill at least an hour before serving. Miami/Key West/Cannes

Yuck. Definitely needs the cream. But probably better sauces out there.

Excellent with grilled shrimp - and on the white trash side (showing my true colors) - with pigs in a blanket!

to topstewer.... A-1 sauce is steak sauce. If you have pickapepper sauce that will work as well.
