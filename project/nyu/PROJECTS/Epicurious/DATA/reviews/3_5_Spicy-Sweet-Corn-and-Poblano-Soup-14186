Very Tasty Soup! But wow, so time consuming, even with powdered spices and an immersion blender, this took FOR EVER. EVER! Tasty if you have lots of time to cook. Maybe if you have pre-roasted peppers or something....

With all due respect to "A Cook from New York, NY", I've made this soup more times than I can count and never had these problems. Everyone I've served it to has loved it, including my wife and teenage kids. Recipes are very much like the protocols we scientists use to ensure reproducibility of experiments. Sometimes small changes in the protocol that one might think wouldn't make a difference can dramatically change the experimental outcome. I'm guessing something similar has happened to "A Cook from New York, NY".

It was really tasty and i will make it again. Doesnt need the cream- tasted great without it. i didnt bother roasting and grinding the spices and just used ground ones.

Without trying to insult anybody, I have to wonder how many people tried to convince themselves the soup was terrific after SO much work. I think this was the most tedious and work-intensive recipe Ive ever tried on this site. The result isnt awful, and maybe it will be better by tomorrow, but all in all very disappointing given the rave reviews and the time put into it. Mine ended up watery, with a spiciness that just kind of goes to the back of the throat, and a flavor that doesnt quite deliver. Furthermore, the poblanos made the soup an unappealing grey color that the cream only partly covered up. Lastly, I used my brand new immersion blender, but ended up with yucky corn skins that I had to strain out anyways.

Excellent and adaptable. I roasted the poblanos, corn and garlic on the gas grill, which gave the soup a lot of character. I also used soup stock made from smoked chicken carcass and subbed the cream with fat free evap milk. It is a light creamy soup - not a thick one that my husband was expecting. I however loved it. I will be adding shrimp to it tomorrow. This was a breeze using the immersion blender that I bought especially for this recipe. Doing otherwise would be very messy and time consuming.

Fantastic recipe! I used frozen sweet corn instead of bothering with fresh corn on the cob. Substituting 0.5 cups half and half for the 1 cup cream worked well to give the soup some rich creaminess without all the fat and calories. Straining the soup is totally unnecessary - using an immersion blender worked well. I sauteed the second half of the corn in a bit of butter rather than oil to add some extra depth in flavor. I didn't bother tying the cilantro into a bundle and then removing - just garnishing with chopped cilantro prior to serving worked well.

So very, very good. Double the recipe, as it is a bit of work. I served this at a Mexican dinner party and it was amazing and complex.

This was excellent and only got better the next day. I can't wait to have it again!

I served this recipe as a first course, and my guests raved about it. I made the recipe exactly as written, but I did double it. Upon reheating it the next day, I cut up raw shrimp and added them to the soup. It was so delicious. I will make this again and again. Give it a try. Well worth the effort!!

very good! i did not strain, just whizzed it with the hand blender. also, didnt feel like roasting the red pepper so i just diced some and sauteed with the corn. served with chopped cilantro, tomato, garlic, onion pico on top.. i think i might increase the spices a little for more depth next time, but fine as written. bacon bits might be good on top too. great way to use up some ears that were a couple days old.

POR FAVOR! Maple syrup - argh.... Use fresh sweet corn and no added sugar will be required. Even baby frozen corn works off-season - never use canned corn - ay ay ay!. Please, please don't sub in canned jalapenos. You'll add an unnecessary vinegar taste. Plus, you people using cans - think of the chemicals, extra salt you add to an otherwise healthy recipe. If you can't tolerate cream, leave it out or increase corn to thicken. South Americans use very little diary - heavy cheese, cream, etc. is a Norte Americano addition (perversion?). Also: Fresh coriander = fresh cilantro. Coriander = cilantro's root/seeds. Instead of chicken broth, I start with water. To increase corn flavor and thickening, I add extra cobs I froze after taking corn off them for other recipes. I use white onions when mauis not available. I add fresh lime juice and chopped cilantro on top before serving. Finally, try grilling everything while roasting your poblanos and bell peppers. Grilled onion and corn-on-cob is sweeter and makes nice summer-fall transition. We always eat with warm corn tortillas and homemade tomato salsa (chop together tom, cilantro, little onion, S&P, fresh chile is optional). For a complete meal we add side platter of shredded grilled chicken (sprinkled w/ S&P and lime juice) or sliced grilled steak. Recipe easily DOUBLES or TRIPLES and keeps/freezes for a while. I also use blender stick - have been for years. Consider it a must-have basic kitchen tool. -- P.S. to Robyn123 with watery soup - you can simmer gently uncovered until liquid reduces and then correct seasonings (this is why I never add S&P until just before serving), double-check liquid quantities next time :)

Unfortunately, this soup did not turn out well for me at all. I followed the recipe however the soup was very watery. It was also very time consuming.

This soup was good, but for the result I thought it was extremely time consuming.

This was a wonderful spicy soup. It was almost too spicy because having no access to poblanos or jalapenos I added spicy Indian green chillies in the quantities given in the recipe -- Wow!!! next time I will have the number of chillies or use jalopenos from a bottle. But still we all like spicy food and the soup really grows on you. We had this as a light one dish meal.

Give this a try to make the soup a little tastier than it already is: add a little maple syrup at the end of the recipe, to taste. not a lot, just a little. It tastes better if you balance the heat with a little sweet.

We really liked this soup. I followed the recipe exactly, but added chunks of grilled chicken at the end as mentioned by another reviewer. This addition made the soup have more texture and made it a lot more substantial. The flavors blended wonderfully together. This was a bit time consuming to make, but was worth it. A real keeper!!

I made this when it first appeared in '97 but I took a lot of short cuts (frozen corn, no cobs, bottled roasted peppers, powdered spices, no straining just pureeing). JUST SAY NO. I made this last night following the recipe exactly (only needed 1/4 cup cream) and it was superb. I have made a bazillion soups and this is one of the best ever. Thanks to all of the other reviewers that encouraged me to give it another try now that I have the time to make it as written. Still swooning - yum!

This is a great recipe. I might use four ears of corn next time for a little thicker soup. The second time we had it, I added grilled chicken chunks, and we loved it with this addition as well. Try it!

Yum. Had to resort to frozen corn, but it turned out fine. Appreciated suggestion for additional canned cream corn. Had a lot of jalapenos on hand, so roasted some in lieu of poblanos. Suggestion to previous commentator to avoid blender soup explosions: USE AN IMMERSION (OR STICK) BLENDER and a DEEP soup (or stock) pot. As someone who makes a LOT of soups, I wouldn't be without mine.

Mu husband and I loved this recipe. It was excellent. I added a can of creamed corn which really pumped up the corn flavor and allowed me to reduce the amount of cream used. This is a keeper. Be careful when blending the soup in a blender. Each time I blended the soup it exploded.

Best soup recipe on this site. It is original and very, very tasty. Take a Sunday afternoon and spend some time brewing up this concoction. It is worth your effort and time.

This soup has a wonderful complex balance of flavors. The touch of lime at the end finishes it beautifully. Although I altered the quantity of some the ingredients (only one half of a jalepeno?) and substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth, the final result was stunning. Sophisticated results from unassuming elements.

Wow! This one goes right to the front page of my soup file.... I used non fat evaporated cream and never missed the flavor... i kept tasting and tasting and if you wanted to leave the dairy out all together it would still be fantastic. I only wished I lived in the southwest where poblamos are easier to come by. Wonder if anyone has tried any substitutions. I saved the seeds and will plant them next year. Time consuming but worth every minute.

Fantastic! No need to change a thing. I used this recipe as a first course for a Mexican theme dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe and still is asking for this soup again and again!! What a wonderfully complex blend of flavours!

I also used fat free evap milk, and it turned out quite good.

Great soup recipe! I served it with Spinach Salad With Pear and Avocado (BA 12/95) and it made a good combination. As always, I substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream making it a pretty healthy recipe.

I made this soup as a starter for Thanksgiving Dinner and everyone loved it! A couple of guests told me it was the best soup they had ever had. I doubled the recipe, and had enough to enjoy the next day. Will definately make again!

This will be a dish we make again. We added grilled chicken to the dish and it was very filling as well as delicious. However, next time we will add 2 jalapenos and garnish it with Pepper Jack cheese.

This takes a bit of preparation, but it's most definitely worth it. This soup was immediately added to the pantheon of really great soups I have sloshing around in the back of my head.

I served this soup at a dinner party as well, and ended up sending all of our guests home with a tupperware bowl-full. (sent them to this website for the recipe)Sad to stop by Catahoula on a vacation this spring and see it was no longer on the menu...

I doubled the recipe for a dinner party. It turned out delicious! I served it with black bean quesadillas, which made a perfect accompaniment. Definiteley would make it again, but for 8 people it needs to be doubled for second servings.
