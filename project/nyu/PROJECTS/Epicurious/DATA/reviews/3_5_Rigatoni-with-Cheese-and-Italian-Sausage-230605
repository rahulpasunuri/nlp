This is the best recipe! I first made it when it came out in Bon Appetit and is a frequent request by my family. I usually double the recipe and make it with a homemade marinara sauce (Lidia Bostianich which only takes 20 min.) All my kids have the recipe so they can make it themselves to impress their friends.

This was yummy, I had with Rao's Marinara. Easy, but very good

This is easy and impressive. Next time I'd like to scale up on quality of ingredients, but even with purchased marinara, it was a keeper. I used local Boulder brand hot Italian sausage and Bertolli marinara. I don't think you can mess up with the proportions either -- I used 1 lb. of pasta and 1 lb. of sausage and 1 jar of sauce. I'd use more sauce next time and make my own, maybe with big chunks of tomatoes. It's a beautiful dish!

Made this with shells as well - used only mild italian sausage (family preference) and added basil/oregano/thyme. Used extra garlic. Had Wesleydale not Mozza - was even better! Family inhaled this - will make again

This was a total hit at my house. I made it family style and so added more sausage and cheese. Also, I didn't have rigatoni and so I used shells instead. It reheated well. A definite keeper!

I love this dish. But I think it is only as good as the sausage you use. I happen to have a great Italian deli near my house that makes a fantastic spicy sausage that works perfect in this recipe. I also make large batches of homemade marinara sauce and freeze it in 16-oz containers so I can just thaw it whenever I need it. I would recommend using more sauce than the recipe asks for so you can soak it up with a nice crusty sourdough or Pugliese bread!

this is a delicious and very easy meal to make. i make double the amount everytime and my boyfriend polishes it off effortlessly everytime. i usually add fresh rosemary, oregano and thyme but other than that follow the recipe exactly.

I used a vodka marinara sauce, spicy Italian sausage and added a few chopped mushrooms with the sausage. Great flavors - it didn't seem to be warm enough after broiling (I had doubled the recipe), so would bake first then broil next time.

This was simple, quick and surprisingly delicious. I used homemade marinara made from my garden tomatoes, and turkey sausage.

I tried this recipe tonight, mainly because I needed to go the grocery store, and was looking for something that didn't call for a lot of ingredients ( very un-epicurious! :) Anyway, it was a good base recipe; I added a bunch of fresh rosemary, fresh basil, sliced tomatoes, and some cayenne pepper, and a bit of extra garlic - it was aweseome, and the whole thing took about 5 minutes to assemble. A great and easy dinner.

It's even better if you add a bit of cream to the sauce.

This is a marvelous dish. The whole family enjoyed it. I will definetely make it again. It is easy to make, and not time consuming. I reccomend that you make it right before eating, as it tastes the best then.

Loved it! Also doubled it (but used a full pound of sweet italian sausage). If you don't want too much spice I would use the sweet sausage. The red pepper flakes will give it just the right amount of heat. Also used Trader Joe's vodka marinara sauce. It has a little cream in it and really made the dish. Will definitely make again!!

This dish has become a staple in my busy life. It is very easy to make and so delicious. I make it in one big dish and it comes out well. The leftovers are also great.

I loved this. My 2 year old loved this! I will be making this again!

I love this dish in large part because it is so easy to make, but also because I love baked pasta dishes, but don't like to cook with ground beef. I baked it all in one big casserole dish and it came out perfectly.

One of my favorite dishes to make. It's even better if you make it in advance (up to the broiling part), chill in the fridge overnight, and bake the next day.

Yes, this is a very easy recipe to make, and is simple, but sometimes I think people think complicated pasta dishes are superior. They aren't; traditional Italian pasta dishes ARE simple. And we're way past the '80s and the era of the 37-ingredient pasta dish. My husband loved, LOVED this and I often DO make very high-end complicated dishes, just for the challenge. I think this dish is wonderful as is - but you could make your own marinara, etc., if it's too "dumbed-down" for you.

Certainly an easy dish to make but nothing really special. Would make it again for a quick family dinner but not for company.

This made a wonderful dinner tonight. I doubled the recipe and used sweet Italian turkey sausage. Also added roasted eggplant as a way to sneak in some extra veggies. Very good, simple and hearty dish.

I doubled the recipe and it was wonderful. I also substituted sweet italian sausage for the spicy since I was giving some to my parents and they don't like spicy. Will definitely make this again.

This is an easy dish & makes a nice meal with a salad and/or garlic bread. For guests that prefer less spicy dishes I made it with sweet italian sausage. (I preder the spicy)

A nice, hearty dinner dish that the 65, 45 and the 5 year old loved! I prepred it in a casserole for ease and added a green salad and breadsticks, great for a simple family dinner on a busy Monday.
