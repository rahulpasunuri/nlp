Was a bit soupy even after chilling overnight, but tasted delicious. Next time I will soak the ladyfingers for a little less time. Also I used the french ladyfingers from Trader Joes and will only use the really hard boudoir ones next time.

love this recipe! Unfortunately I ran out of coffee when I was almost at the end and had to brew another fresh cup... so i'd make more coffee in future, doesn't hurt to have more. Also, once I have laid out everything, I whisked the egg white first so that I don't have to waste time and effort to wash the whisk and ensure it's dry before I start on the egg white. Call me lazy, but it worked for me. Just need to work a little faster.

A solid recipe, easy to make and delicious. I do like my tiramisu more custard so I added an extra egg. My recommendations for the problems others have had is beat everything well and follow the directions the first time to a tee. You can't say its bland or soupy if you didn't use marsala, or didn't dip the cookies as recommended, or skipped things. After you have made it then you can personalize to taste.

Delicious! I added an extra dollup of marsala. And used whipping cream. So good. Will make again!

I had to give this only 3 forks because of the heavy cream. Do not use heavy cream. No matter how cold it is, it will turn to butter. I left it completely out of the recipe.If you must use a cream, get whipping cream. I read the complaints about the bland taste of the filling. In the Marscapone I added 4 or 5 capfuls of Amaretto liquor. For extra Amaretto flavor I added some to the coffee that I dipped the lady fingers in. However, if you want to forgo all of this, just buy a bottle of Kahlua coffee liqueur. I just so happened to have some Amaretto in the house. Also make sure that your Marscapone cheese is cold and not room temperature. This helps put the stiffness into your marsapone mix. Otherwise follow the directions and enjoy!

This was delicious. I had no idea Marscapone was so good!! I cheated the time to set up, so it got sloppy but guests still came back for more. I started it cooling with 2 hours in the freezer. It didn't freeze, so I will do that again in the future. Or just make it the night before so it has lots of time to set. I used good orange liquor with the coffee/espresso and it was delicious. I also used gluten free lady fingers and just toasted them well in the oven to make sure they would soak up lots of liquid and stay intact. I doubled the recipe, but not the coffee solution. 4 cups seemed crazy.

This was pretty good. I think I prefer premade expresso...for some reason it got soaked in and I was left with the grounds by the end of my dipping. May try to make my own ladyfingers and see how much of a difference it makes.

Rating: 4
This was really good. I made the mascarpone cream part exactly as described, but I also used Kahlua instead of sweet Marsala which was just fine. However, I could not find the Italian lady fingers and used the regular soft ones. I toasted them in the oven until they were fairly hard. However, they became too soft when dipped and started falling apart before they were saturated. Next time if I can't find the Italian ones I'll toast/dry even longer and carefully spoon extra coffee onto them once they're placed to make sure they get enough coffee. I also shaved bittersweet chocolate onto each mascarpone layer. Yum.

Excellent, excellent recipe. I really took the reviews to heart...used 1 less egg, mixed/beat the crap out of each step and it came out PERFECT! When you use the savoiardi, I found a good "tip" - dip only the NON SUGARED SIDE for 2 seconds and then flip it over and lay onto the marscapone mixture SUGAR SIDE DOWN...that way the side that you "dipped" will be upright and keep incorporating down into the lady finger. Next time I will dip for a second more, mine needed a smidge more "coffee" flavor, but I can say I am probably one of the few who could have had a little MOISTER tiramisu. I will definitely make it again!!!!! I used Kalhua instead of the marsala.

Rating: 3
I made this for my step son, it's his favorite dessert. the one thing I would change is use both layers of lady fingers at the bottom on top of each other, having 2 separate layers with the mascarpone filling in between made it too soft, to the point that it was falling apart . Also a good tip is not to soak the ladyfingers completely. they'll absorb enough moisture from the filling, especially after 6 hrs. too bad it only lasts 2 days, definitely make it when guests are coming so this yummy treat doesn't go to waste.

This recipe was amazing! I actually ran out of the Marsala wine so I substituted with Port wine. It came out amazing!! I also soaked the lady fingers until the cookies were almost falling apart. It came out really good!

This tiramisu recipe was good, but not great. I made my own mascarpone, which was delicious itself, but the flavor of the tiramisu wasn't as good as the cheese itself. I opted to follow other epicurian's ideas and shaved some dark chocolate in between each layer as well as on top. Would try another recipe before doing this one again. =[

I've now made this recipe twice. Both times it never firmed up as much as I think it should. Will reduce sugar to half cup next time, as it is overly sweet, making it overly rich, and will beat everything until stiff even though recipe says not to on first. A good recipe overall, just needs tweaking. beating. Also, used true lady fingers the second time, but found them not so special for the cost. Will use pound cake or something else next time and brush the coffee mixture on. Used Kahlua like most reviewers, as it is what I have on hand, and loved the flavor.

Bon Appetit!!!

Seriously, this is amazing! People that didn't like tiramisu loved this! I made this twice with two different kinds of imported Italian cookies -- small, harder lady finger cookies, and larger cookies that absorbed 4 times the amount of espresso. The tiramisu came out pretty differently, but they were delicious both ways. You can't ruin this recipe!!! Use good quality espresso and other ingredients.

I just finished making this and, unlike other recipes, it is, as other reviewers stated, not as thick/firm and rather soupy. The taste is fantastic, however and I am hoping that after 7 hrs. in the refrigerator it will firm up substantially. I, also, used pasteurized eggs and noticed that it took much longer to reach the desired consistency. Plan to dust the top with the cocoa and chocolate shavings.

Rating: 3
This recipe impresses and is also very simple - a winner in style and taste in my book! Defintely try to chill for at least 6 hours or it'l be soupy which still tastes delicious but doesn't hold its form. Also, if savoiardi aren't available, I've substituted one box of 'Nilla wafers which probably isn't for the purist but may actually work better - the layers end up thinner and the whole thing holds a bit better. In any case: delicious!

All the tiramisu I've ever tried had a custard like texture, this was light and creamy in texture - it was absolutely amazing. We prepared it as listed, substituting in 3T Kalua for the wine as it's what we had. 18 ladyfingers (1 inch by 5 inches) were enough - 6oz. After refridgerating overnight it was firm enough to cut and serve like a slice of cake. And it was AMAZING. You do have to be sure to beat everything to a firm peak for it to be that firm. This is going to be cult favorite in our house hold! Took us 1hr to prep using a standing mixer. Totally worth it!

Rating: 4
No problems with this turning out too soupy. I made sure all the eggs and cream were stiff and I only dipped the lady fingers for 1 sec. Next time I think I may dip them a little longer. I used french press coffee but think I may use expresso next time for a little stronger coffee flavor. All in all this was a big success.

I followed the recipe precisely, but it turned out to be way too soupy and liquidy. I wouldn't make it again.

I made this recipe for a potluck last night and it was a total success. It isn't one of those tiramisu's that taste like too much alcohol and was fairly simple to make...albeit somewhat time consuming. Per other recommendations, I just quickly dipped the lady fingers in the coffee solution which was perfect. I did need quite a bit more lady fingers than recommended, but besides that, this was definitely a make again recipe.

I made this recipe for my class and it was a big success! However, the prep time was much longer than 25 minutes. Also, I tripled the recipe, but only ended up using half of the mascarpone mixture. Soaking the ladyfingers in the espresso for 4 seconds was way to generous- I dipped them for about a second, which was perfect. I have very little experiece with cooking, and I found this recipe fairly easy and extremly rewarding!

We couldn't find ladyfingers so we baked a pound cake, cubed it and toasted the cubes on a cookie sheet in the oven. This worked very well.

This recipe turned out really well. I made it in a trifle bowl for something different. I did use pastuerized eggs as my old recipe used a traditional zabaglione and I was a little sqeamish on the raw eggs. Using pastuerized eggs did lengthen the beating process quite a bit. I used the marsala directly into the eggs yolk mixture to give it a more tradtiional zabaglione taste and it was perfect.

Absolutely delish'! I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner on the weekend. Guests were very impressed (a real bunch of foodies in my family) and I too received the comment from one 'gourmet' guest that it was the best Tiramisu he ever had. However; I too found it to be runny as other reviewers have discovered. But the flavours were fantastic! I did make a few changes (that would not have affected the runny texture): I used more savoiardi cookies as others suggested, that was a great idea that I would do again. I only had Kahlua on hand, so I used that instead of the Marsala wine, which worked out wonderfully. Regarding the runny texture (and yes my tiramisu was well chilled over night) I will lessen the amount of eggs in the recipe next time to 1 large egg and that should make the difference. Again, even though it was runny, it tasted out of this world!

im typing as i eat - YUMMY. i once made another recipe that used cream cheese instead of mascarpone, DO NOT DO THIS -- this recipe is much better and easy, just requires a lot of separated mixing -- but ITS WORTH IT!! this is some of the best ive tasted. some reviews said their's was runny, i recommend simply making sure the three whipped components are fairly stiff. i did not cook the eggs. i 1/2ed the recipe and ended up using 11 lady fingers, make sure they are are the crispy kind, NOT soft. all and all really good, not too hard and a fun experience...

Rating: 4
I cooked the yolks and sugar while whisking over a double-boiler. I beat the heavy cream to stiff peaks. I couldn't find the Italian ladyfingers, just the soft ones so I put them in the toaster oven to crisp them and that worked well. I did use quite a few extra, as they were pretty small. Luckily I bought 2 packages. I used Gosling's Black rum instead of Marsala and added 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract to the mixture with some good fresh- brewed strong coffee. I didn't use all of the liquid, just about half. So I added some heavy cream and sugar to the leftover and heated it in the microwave to drink while I finished making the dish. YUM! Everything else I kept to the recipe. I was very pleased with the results and the ease of preparation. I am serving it at work tomorrow, for a co-workers party. She told me Tiramisu was her favorite so I'm surprising her.

Great recipe - I made this for a party of about 35 - and multiplied the recipe by 4. I also love the previous comments and adjusted the recipe by making "pate a bombe" as a base for the marscapone cream. Mixed the yolks with super hot stream of sugar - to form a beautiful custard cream and skipped the whites to avoid the raw egg issues. Kept to the recipe otherwise - and it was perfect consistency. Used 100 lady fingers - per earlier comments that needed a bit more than the recipe stated. It was a birthday gathering - so followed the comment to use a ribbon to write on the cake - sprinkled the cocoa and shaved chocolate and removed the ribbon just before serving. It was such an easy desert and truly crowd pleasing. Delicious!!

This is super delicious (especially the mascarpone cream, mmmmm)! My only qualm with it is that it turned out a bit more liquidy than I had expected. My previous experiences eating tiramisu led me to believe that it was a firmer cream, something that could be cut into squares. When I made this recipe, it turned out more like a very soft pudding, and it has to be eaten from a bowl. Still tastes great!

Previous reviews were right about the need for more lady fingers...which, luckily, I had more at hand. Other than that, fantastic, and super easy! For first timers like me, be aware of the amount of powder at the end. A little goes a long way!

To avoid the problem of the raw eggs you can cook them. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a metal bowl, put it over a saucepan of simmering water, whisk it constantly until the candy thermometer registers 165' and mixture thickens, about 4 minutes, let cool completely, whisk occasionally. For the egg whites, substitute them with 1 cup of whipped cream, and follow the recipe as it says. The taste is as good as it is or even better than when the eggs are raw. Try it you won't regret it.

This was an amazing recipe - I tried it out last Christmas with major success. Easy to make, just add a little bit of patience, it's such a joy to see the results. This year, I'll be trying it with some Frangelico, so it should add a nice touch to it. Highly recommended!

I was surprised how easy it was to make this recipe. I could not find mascarpone cheese anywhere so I substituted a large container of whipped creme cheese. I found I needed more than 18 savoiardi (probably because my substitution made more custard than the original recipe). It made 8 generous servings for our dinner party with leftovers and everyone raved about how good it was. One of our guests considers himself a tiramisu aficionado and declared it was the best he's ever tasted and took home all the leftovers.

Delicious recipe! This was my first time making any kind of tiramisu and I followed this recipe exactly with some substitutions. Used brandy instead of marsala wine, 30 french ladyfingers instead of saviordi, and added brandied cherries and a sprinkle of chocolate pearls. I thought that having to mix ingredients in 3 different bowls was rather laborious but maybe that's because I have a stand mixer and not a hand mixer, so preparing this involved a lot of washing up. Otherwise, I received compliments from my guests and would definitely make this again!

The whipped egg yolks, egg whites and whipped cream dilute the mascarpone down into a tastless, yellow fluffy substance. Reduce the egg to 1 for this amount of mascarpone and ladyfingers - - or look elsewhere. This recipe produces way too much filling for the 18 ladyfingers.

Made exactly as directed. Used expresso from my Nespresso machine. Dipped the ladyfingers in coffee for about 2 seconds as I found longer made them too saturated. Used high quality mascarpone, eggs and cream and found the taste to really shine through. Easy and quick recipe. Excellent version that is far better than most Tiramisu I have had before.

You can't go wrong with this one...it's delicious! I suggest using a very good quality coffee. I used Kahlúa instead of Marsala, I just happen to like it better. It's an artery-clogging dessert, but well worth it!!!

This was amazing; best tiramisu I have ever had. I served it to friends who are not fans of tiramisu and they can't stop raving. Based on some of the reviews I made some changes: 1/2 c. sugar, 40 savioardi. Next time I might increase sugar a bit. But some recommended 1 c. espresso and I needed the 2 cups. Based on another recipe recommendation I made sure to use Italian espresso, not instant and not coffee. I think it was worth it.

Rating: 4
This is the recipe! I make it as written, but sometimes vary the alcoholic content. Kahlua works well, as does rum. I also use very, very strong espresso, as we all love the intense coffee flavor. To decorate, I lay ribbon across the top in a diamond pattern, dust liberally with cocoa powder, lift the ribbons to reveal a criss-cross pattern, and place chocolate covered espresso beans at the junctions where the ribbons crossed. It is easy, spectacular and delicious.

Fantastic tiramisu recipe! Instead of marsala wine, I substituted rum, which lent itself to the perfect flavoring. I made this in individual serving dishes, so I ended up using more ladyfingers than stated here. I also made a litte chocolate swirl decoration for the top by tempering bittersweet chocolate and piping it out onto parchment paper and then letting chill in the frige. This is a top-notch recipe in every way!

So far so good. Like others: Sabayon of yolks, liquor and sugar -- beat cooked mixture until room temp then added mascarpone (room temp and vigorously stirred). Mixed perfectly. Flavor of creme is superb. Used crispy ladyfingers, one quick dunk each. Lots of leftover coffee. Letting sit overnight. Will report dinner party results.

Rating: 0
Instead of a sabayon, where you may or may not reach a safe cooking temp before you curdle your custard, you can also make a pate a bombe using the yolks and sugar - just cook the sugar in a pot to softball stage and pour down the side of the mixing bowl onto your yolks while the mixer is whipping away. Just like making Italian meringue, but with yolks instead, and you are sure that your food is safe. The pate a bombe is also stiffer, and will help with consistency issues. Another way to get your tiramisu to set is to add a little gelatin.

This was excellent and easy to make! Here are some tips. First, I used many more lady fingers than the recipe suggests. I would just buy a pack or two and keep layering them with the cream until you're out of the cream. I used about 40 fingers. I made this recipe twice and I definitely suggest cutting the sugar down to half a cup. Also, the coffee really does have to be strong. I thought that the Starbucks espresso shots in a can were great, and better than using regular coffee. For the alcohol, I didn't use marsala wine, but made combo of rum and amaretto. it was great.

This is the perfect version of the classic. Everyone oohed and ahhed and I will make it again and again.

I was very happy with this recipe. I as well used soft ladyfingers, so instead of dipping them I brushed the espresso on. As well, instead of the Marsala wine I used Amaretto...it worked out very nicely. I highly recommend this recipe. Also don't feel obligated to use all of the espresso, you want to soak but not saturate your ladyfingers because you still want to have a little substance to them when you bite them...not just a soggy mess!

To answer the question from choang121 from california dated 5/18/08: perhaps the cheese you used was not so creamy? I am making this recipe for the second time...and my mascarpone is thicker - not as creamy. I'm beating the egg/cheese mixture until it's smooth before moving on...

Fantastic recipe! Used the same suggestions as posted by previous reviewers. Used only 1/2 cup sugar in total; cooked the egg yolks/ sugar mixture first, then beat it in mixer. I also combined espresso with marsala and kahlua - gave it the perfect flavor. this classic italian dessert comes out light and airy, and leaves people asking for more....! Can't get any better than that! :-)

There is another wonderful recipe from Gourmet on tiramisu however I could not find it but I will offer it up here. The recipe does not use raw egg (and friends of mine were opposed to the idea of raw egg). It calls for 2/3 cup of espresso, a simple syrup and 1/4 of liquor (I used dark Mount Gay Rum). Dip lady fingers, and begin to arrange on dish. Whip 1 and 1/2 cup of cream, 1/3 cup of sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Fold mascarpone into cream. And arrange layers. This recipe is excellent and provides a nice creamy and light texture to the mascarpone. I highly recommend it.

I doubled the recipe and made it in a trifle dish. I had about 3 servings left after 12 adults had dessert and it wasn't the only dessert. It makes a LOT!! But it was super cremy, light as air and absolutely delicious. Everyone had seconds, some even had thirds. I also garnished with chocolate curls. I highly recommend not soaking the cookies so long. Dip, roll remove was how I did each one and the weren't mushy at all. There was also enough cheese mixture left over that wouldn't fit in my trifle dish that I made a few individual tiramisu cups in ramekins and served them at our card night. Also a huge success.

Perfect recipe, exactly the classic I remember from childhood. I remember my mother's tiramisu always coming out too soggy, which I hated, so I gave the ladyfingers less time in the coffee than the recipe suggests - no more than 1 second each side. The liquid distributes itself evenly as the dessert chills and you're left with cookies that are soft but not mushy.

I never made tiramisu before, but this was incredibly easy to prepare. It didn't hurt that it was delicious and served a lot of people. I didn't have Marsala, so used a splash of grappa, added vanilla to the creamy stuff, and only dipped my ladyfingers for about an instant per side. 2 cups of strong coffee is a waste, since 1 is more than enough to flavor the biscuits. I'll add less sugar next time, because the biscuits are already sweetened. I couldn't help but wonder if a proper southern banana pudding that we enjoy today is descended from tiramisu. Their structures are similar...and Thomas Jefferson did spend time in Italy.

Made it as indicated but incorporated some of the suggestions made in the review section: * reduce sugar to 1/2 cup * use Kahlua in place of Marsala * sprinkle cocoa powder in between layers Came out fantastic and would certainly make it again. I also made it in little bowls for portability reasons. Turned out just fine. I didn't beat the eggs over hot water (not sure how that works, really) so would try that the next time.

Fabulous!!! I used bakery pound cake (couldn't find ladyfingers) and made a double recipie in a 9x13 and had some cream left over. Next time I will trim the cake to make it look prettier. Also used Kaluha instead of Marsala Wine. Brought it to work and everyone loved it. It tasted exactly how I remembered it should. Cream was not as stiff as I would have liked, expected it to be more firm...any ideas that won't compromise the incredible flavor?

Excellent recipe! I made a few adjustments, partly because I couldn't find all of the required ingredients. I used 1 cup Starbucks espresso (one of their individual cans) as my grocery store was lacking in any espresso mixes, and it worked perfectly. I also used 2 tablespoons vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons Bailey's Irish Cream to mix with the espresso. My only other alteration was to use pound cake slices instead of lady fingers, and everything tasted amazing. Other reviewers mentioned only using a 1/2 cup sugar, but I have a sweet tooth, and the 3/4 cup of sugar was just perfect for me. Enjoy!

I doubled this recipe to fit a 9x13 inch pan, but DID NOT double the amount of espresso - and it worked just right with no leftovers. Bought at 55-piece savoiardi package and used 42:-). Used Kahlua. The key to soaking the savoiardi is do it lightly! One side, other side, hold vertically to let any excess drip off - DONE. Whipped cream and egg whites to stiff peaks. Chilled overnight. Was NOT runny:-)!

Based on other reviews, I did some slight modifications. I doubled the marscapone. I made 1 cup of espresso & mixed 2 tablespoons godiva cream liquer into it. I brushed the ladyfingers with the coffee/spirits mixture, and the ladyfingers stayed crisp. It was excellent, my husband's family truly liked it. (I served this to an uncle who who never compliments anyone and I got a lovely compliment from him.) I loved the cream mix, I hate coffee so I didn't have any of the ladyfingers. It was better 2 days later. (I made it Friday night to serve Saturday night. Sunday it was superb) There was no issue of runny-ness. I would make this again.

Oh my this is good. Definitely let this chill overnight though. Mine chilled for eight hours and it was a little "loose" whien I served it. The next morning it was perfect though. I made a few tiny changes. One, at the advice of previous reviewers, I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added chocolate between the layers. Perfect. Also, flavored with Captain Morgan rum vs. Marsala. And finally, I whisked the egg yolks and sugar over a double boiler for a few minutes just because I am not a fan of raw egg yolks in recipes. I can always taste that "eggy-ness." This is a definite keeper.

I liked the flavor and texture of the mascarpone mixture. The amount of coffee and directions for dipping the lady fingers, however, resulted in far too soggy cookies. I dipped only one cookie for the prescribed four seconds on each side, and it disintegrated. I rolled the others quickly in the coffee liquid but the finished tiramisu had a pool of coffee in the bottom of the pan, and the cookies had lost all of their body. The lady fingers I bought were imported from Italy, but I imagine they aren't the same as true Italian lady fingers, which I hear are larger and more dense than what we find in the US. Most people making this recipe will likely find the kind of ladyfingers I did, so I would suggest cutting the coffee way down (two cups seems absurd) and drizzling some coffee over the cookies rather than dunking them in the liquid. I'd also add some Marsala to the mascarpone mixture if I make this recipe again.

Rating: 0
I didn't make this recipe, but since I live in Italy, I wanted to attest that this is more or less the same recipe that I use from my cookbook written in Italian. Cut out the cream, use slightly less sugar (powdered) and it's authentic. Also, avoid drenching the cookies too much as they will absorb some of the moisture from the batter. Buon appetito!

Really loved this recipe. My husband and I got back from a trip to Italy a few months ago and I thought I would try my hand at tiramisu. This recipe turned out better than any we had in Italy. Just make sure your coffee is really strong!

I made this last night for my husband for Valentine's Day as tiramisu is his favorite. I agree with the other reviewers that the sugar was too much, but he liked the over-sweetness. I thought the cream mixture had a perfect consistency and it was not difficult to make (but I did have two mixers going). Hubby said it was a "home run!"

I agree with the previous reviewers about the sugar definitely reduce the amount. I used good quality espresso and added Kahlua to it. I also added a little bit of vanilla to the eggs just to take off that eggy flavor. Made it yesterday for my husbands birthday as it is his fav dessert. this one is a keeper, can't wait for leftovers!

This turned out perfect. It was not runny nor soggy. I did use 1/2 sugar, as was recommended by other reviewers. I also used "soft" ladyfingers. They felt pretty dry to me, but they soaked up only 1/2 cup (not 2 cups) of espresso. Maybe the other reviewers thought they HAD to use all the espresso. I dipped for 4 seconds each side, as directed, and the result was perfect. Yet, only 1/2 cup of espresso was absorbed. None-the-less, the end product had plenty of espresso flavor and the texture was great. I made it in a beautiful pottery bowl for show. Looked and tasted great.

Rich tasting and almost fluffy in texture, all the ingredient combine well. My only issue with the recipe is the amount of sugar. There's such a thing as too sweet.

Rating: 3
Delicious but with modifications: Needed 36 ladyfingers, not 18 for all that filling. I went to the store for more in the middle of assembly. 36 ladyfingers only soaked up one cup of espresso. I sifted cocoa powder on the middle and top layers and lightly dusted confectioner's suger on top of the chocolate. I used my garlic slicer to shave the chocolate.

Great recipe! I didn't change the amount of sugar as stated in previous comments, however, I added the Marsala to the egg yolk-sugar mixture and beat the mixture over a double boiler (like a sabayon), then added the mascarpone, etc. I followed the suggestion to use half the amount of espresso and stirred in 1/4 cup of (Myers) dark rum.

the tiramisu came out really wonderfully! it was very fluffy and lighter than most tiramisus that i've had. i would suggest making these changes: 1) reduce the coffee amount to half and keep the liquer about the same. the ladyfingers really only used up about half of the total liquid. 2) increase the number of lady fingers by about a third. there were not enough ladyfingers for the two layers. 3) add shaved chocolate to the middle layer on top of the soaked ladyfingers. otherwise, everyone loved and raved about this tiramisu.

I'm currently living in Italy and I made this for a dinner party - the Italians raved! One woman said it was as good as her mom's - apparently very high praise, and others said it was the best they've had. The only changes I made to the recipe were based on prior reviews. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar, a bit more mascarpone (250 g), 1 cup of espresso, and chocolate shavings in between layers as well as on top. It took a total of 24 savoiardi to fill my dish, I only dipped the cookies for 2-3 seconds per side, and beat the whipping cream to firm peaks. This is going in my permanent file.

Outstanding recipe, don't oversoak the lady fingers and def. use good marsala and fresh espresso.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. It held together fine, and was absolutely delicious. The only problem was that, as it sat, the liquid "bled" out of it, and created a puddle in the bottom of the dish, which was unattractive. I had to pour out the liquid each time I went to serve some.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I was a little concerned after reading all the comments, but it was marvelous. I rolled the ladyfingers around lightly in the liquid and then spooned some over it before covering with the cream mixture. As a result, I had quite a bit of coffee-marsala left over. Next time, I'll only use half the coffee required, but keep the marsala the same. Otherwise, no changes are necessary. It tasted heavenly.

Rating: 3
Was actually easier to make than I thought it would be. Finding the ingredients were the difficult part. I used Kahlua and a toffee liquor instead of the wine, and it was a hit at my party. I wish it were a little less watery; next time I will use more mascarpone. I also used whipped cream from a can to save on time, and that was fine, too.

A bit time consuming to prepare - but WOW - What a hit with real tiramisu-lovers!

This was just wonderful! I could only get soft ladyfingers, and found that dipping them made them too soggy, ending up with a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan; next time I will just brush on. Delicious taste, though, will definitely make again!

Great recipe that everyone in my family loves. Here are my little adjustments: a bit less sugar, use good coffee with an additional shot of espresso, substitute half of the Marsala for Kahlua, let sit 24 hrs. prior to serving. That extra sitting time makes the flavors so much better.

Rating: 3
We found this very easy to make and it tasted delicious, especially if you wait overnight to eat it. After reading other reviews, we also substituted Kahlua for Marsala and whipped the cream stiffer so it would have a less soupy consistency. Next time (and there will be a next time!) we try adding some Frangelico and maybe a bit more mascarpone to firm it up.

Rating: 4
This is so easy and is really knock-your-socks-off good. I substituted pound cake - sliced to about 1/3" - for the ladyfingers and it works perfectly. It really needs a good long time to set - putting it in the freezer for the first couple hours helps, but it's very disappointing to cut into when it's still soupy. I've also made this in individual serving dishes when I was afraid I didn't have enough time to let it set completely.

Rating: 4
Try this. Get rid of the egg whites and whip up 1/2 liter cream. This is sooo much better. And to prevent it being too "soupy", put it in the freezer. You can enjoy it as ice cream or defrost it to your preferred texture. AND it prevents the ladyfingers from getting too soggy.

Rating: 4
I'm very pleased with the results from this recipe. The result was quite authentic, however a bit on the sweet side. I followed the recipe precisely except that I add a dusting of Vahlrona cocoa powder between layers. I also made the mistake of not dipping each lady finger for a full 4 seconds and the result was just a bit dry. I'll be sure to wait a full 3 or 4 seconds in the future. The next time I make it, I will reduce the total sugar to 1/2 cup. I am also considering increasing the mascarpone. And I'd like to echo the comment regarding the number of bowls! I was really tempted to combine the three filling components out of order so that I could rinse and reuse one of the bowls. But I resolved to defer to the wisdom of the recipe and wash one more bowl!

This dessert was easy to make and scrumptious!! The only changes I made were that I used Khalua instead of the wine. Also, using a spring form pan makes gives this TIRAMISU a very pretty presentation.

This was very tasty, but a little soupy, and the amount of ladyfingers called for was not enough. I had barely enough cookies for one layer. The amount of coffee called for is probably double what is actually necessary. Also, the filling was not quite as firm as I would have liked - I might cut down on the cream, next time, and would definitely beat it to stiff, not soft, peaks.

This is an excellent recipe and I didn't find it too messy to serve at all. Made 24 hr ahead and it was perfecto. Used Kahlua instead of Marsala.

This was good! Although a bit soupy - next time I will cut the coffee by 1/2 cup. I would also put chocolate shavings between the layers, not just on top.

I made this for a work party and it went over very well. I didn't have marsala handy, but it turned out fine. A Hersey bar in the freezer for a few minutes combined with a cheese grater makes eay work of the topping. I tried another recipe on this site that omitted the whipping cream and 1 egg white and it really didn't have anough filling. his has plenty, and a double batch will nicely fill a 9x12 glass dish.

I made this as one of my Christmas desserts and everyone raved how wonderful and light it was. I used Kahula as my liquor of choice and added a teaspoon of vanilla in with the egg whites. My finace told me to save the recipe and never deviate from it.

Rating: 4
By far a wonderful recipe! I followed it to the letter with the sole exception of using normal ladyfingers as I couldn't get my hands on crisp ones in time. The best way to keep them from turning out so soggy seems to be to baste the ladyfingers heavily with espresso on all sides using a basting brush. More time-consuming, yes, but it works.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. My adjustments were to use less sugar and add some Kahlua to the coffee. For those with access, a cup of drip coffee from Peets works the best. This recipes is best after sitting in the fridge for 24 hrs.

Wonderful! Nice basic tiramisu. For the coffee, it's nice with a bit of cream mixed in, and brandy, rum and a teeny bit of sambuca in it. (You can't taste the licorice at all, but somehow the sambuca makes it fab!) I also cook the egg yolks: use a small bowl set over hot (not boiling) water. Whisk the eggs continuously until they're pale lemon-coloured. This doesn't change the texture at all (as long as you stir it constantly) and voila! goodbye salmonella risk.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Followed instructions to the T except for using 2-3 TBS less sugar than asked for. Espresso makes a great deal of difference, so don't use regular brewed coffee. I've also tried it before with soft lady fingers and it was a soggy disaster, so make sure you get the crisp ones, as asked for.

Rating: 3
Amazing! I used ground dark choc. covered espresso beans as a layer and topping and kahlua istead of marsala. I put the bowls and beaters in the freezer to get peaks and two tubs of marscapone. I don't love sweet so I cut out about a fourth of the sugar. This recipe got the most raves of any dessert I have ever made. I had to run off copies of the recipe. Don't be afraid of the raw egg the alcohol will kill the bugs. If you are worried sample some as you make it and warn the possible preggies.

I followed the directions to a tee the first time and it was very good. The next time I made it, I used decaf coffee with a little Bailey's Irish Cream. I only dipped the ladyfingers briefly because they were too soggy the first time. I also beat all 3 mixtures a little longer to get a fluffier consistency. My wife (who is a chef) said it was the best Tiramisu she has ever had. Kudos to the originator of this recipe!

Rating: 4
I only put in 1/4 c sugar with the yolks, based on prior reviews, but next time I'll put in the original amount (could've been sweeter). Still, the crunchy ladyfingers were perfect when done as instructed, and the whole thing overall was just divine.

Rating: 4
I made a few changes, based on researching a few recipes and my experience with tiramisu. First, only dip the cookies for 1 second per side - just put them in, flip them, and remove. You only need one cup of coffee. Second, I needed 24 large cookies for the 8" square dish I used. Third, I skipped the whipped cream, because it looked filling enough, and it was still great. Fourth, I put grated chocolate in both layers of filling. These are just personal choices, but the dish came out really great. My husband took some to the office to have his friends taste it!

I am a huge lover of tiramisu, and followed this recipe to the word. It turned out good, but too sweet and runny. I would make it again, but use only 1/2 cup sugar maximum next time. (I read many other tiramisu recipes afterward, and realized most call for only 1/2) Also, the 4 second dipping still made my ladyfingers a little too runny. So I would dip for 3 seconds next time. Overall, still a good starting point for your own concoction. p.s.: i did too use the ladyfingers specified. thanks.

I just made this whole meal (the veal, the pasta w/squid and the tiramisu) for my anniversary. It was all so delicious. The best part was that it was so simple. I have made a more intense tiramisu but this one was just as delicious and very easy to boot. The reason some ladyfingers might have gotten soggy was b/c you didn't use the Savordini cookies as suggested.

This recipe was so good that everyone at the table asked for seconds! It's lighter and fluffier than most tiramisu I've tasted and the mascarpone gives it a real authentic flavor. I substituted royal chambord for the marsala and put raspberries on top as a garnish. Also, by following the direction of soaking the ladyfingers 4 seconds on each side, we had a lot of coffee left over, but they were perfectly moistened.

Amazingly good the next day. We made two early in the afternoon, serving one that evening. The other we put in aside in the fridge. The first one was not a big hit, and we threw the recipe away. The next night we decided to try the second dish, and it was delicious! now I am making it again for desert for our Christmas dinner. It must be made at least a day in advance in my opinion.

I can't believe everyone isn't giving this four tines! I loooove tiramisu. I think this is the best I've ever tasted - and i am rarely happy with anything I make. I made a round sponge cake which i cut in half (horizontally) instead of using lady fingers. Then I dribbled the espresso on top. I then layered it within the mold of a springform pan so it could set cake style. After about eight hours it did collapse a bit when I took off the pan sides, but I really didn't care if it wasn't the most professional presentation after I tried a bite... That's what tiramisu is supposed to taste like!

Yes I would make this again! I made this to go camping in the North Woods with a group of seven women. We all thought it was fantastic! My first time ever trying a recipe like this, and since then I've tried others and continue coming back to this one. The only bad thing about making it is to many bowls, a little puttzy but well worth the the effort. Be careful not to dip the lady fingers to long, they continue to soak when you chill it. Don't be afraid to try it, you'll like it. Enjoy!

Although this recipe makes a kind-of tasty dessert, it's definitely not tiramisu. Much too soft and way too sweet. I substituted Kahlua for the Marsala, but next time I think I'll only use half the sugar, half the cream, and twice the Kahlua

I followed the directions exactly and it came out just ok. I doubled the recipe because my family likes tiramisu so I figure it would disappear, but after we tasted it, no one touched it again. The cream was not thick enough, even after setting overnight. Made it Sunday morning so we could have it Monday night! I used the mascarpone cheese and the crisp lady fingers. I would not make this again. I usually make the cooking light tirmisu recipe with cream cheese but thought I'd splurge and get the mascarpone, what a waste. Most of it is still sitting in the fridge. It was a little too sweet and the texture was just all wrong!!!

I got a "special request" to make this for someone, so did a dry run of it. Glad I did, because I had problems. The cream was delicious, and I was surprised that the whole thing tasted like tiramisu. I will also beat the whites and cream stiffer next time. The big problem was with presentation. I made it in a 9x9x2 glass baking dish, and it was a mess when I served it. And the cookie layers were not visible and distinct. Any suggestions?

Excellent dessert--very impressive. Rich, yet remarkably light. I made this for a large group and it got rave reviews. Ingredients fit to-the-drop perfectly in a large 10" x 15" glass baking dish (will have 2 layers each of ladyfingers and the marscapone mix).

I looked for this recipe just to duplicate the cream part of the dessert because of a dessert I had tried at a local bakery that I was trying to duplicate. We don't particularly like coffee so tiramisu is not one of our favorites but this recipe with replacing the coffee with a simple syrup and almaretto makes the most delicious almond creme cake. I did however find that after reading some of the reviews I was afraid on how much to soak the Lady fingers for fear of making them too soggy. Well you live and learn because I don't feel I soaked them enough and it took a little away from the cake. I will however next time use the soft ladyfingers and will reduce the number of ladyfingers I use. I didn't care for that many. Overall this dessert turned out great. I doubled the recipe and it still only lasted a few days with just the 4 of us.

This was the first time I'd ever made tiramisu and I brought it to a dinner party. The creamy filling was delicious. Everyone really seemed to like it! The only thing I did wrong was choose fresh ladyfingers, rather than crisp. They fell apart when I dunked them into the coffee/marsala mixture. So I just arranged the rest of them in the dish and spooned the coffee over them. It worked out just fine. No one seemed the wiser. I think the next time I might add a little vanilla or perhaps use Kahlua instead of marsala. I'd welcome other suggestions.

This was a good recipe. I have made probably half a dozen different recipes (you'd be surprised how many there are out there - some use cream cheese, whipped cream and NO Mascarpone - how original is that?) and this is a pretty good one.
