This was delicious with a homemade curry powder in the heavy cream. I left out the cheese because I'm broke and it was actually rich enough without it.

Made this as part of our New Year's Day brunch. I didn't have any fresh spinach on hand, so I just microwaved some chopped, frozen spinach. Quick, easy and delicious. Even my "egg hating" husband loved this and wished there was more.

Love this recipe! A very special (but simple) breakfast, especially if entertaining guests. Must try!

So awesome! I'm avoiding dairy, so I subbed coconut milk for the cream and that worked really well. I also used a shallot instead of garlic. I baked for seven minutes and the egg yolks were hard- but maybe it's because I halved the recipe. Regardless, this was really, really good! And definitely very filling.

I made this as a dinner with some wild rice and crusty french bread. I added a couple slices of turkey bacon to the saute and topped the whole thing with Parmesan and feta to bake for the last 5 minutes. I baked it in an 8"x8" Pyrex. The recipe was good, but somewhat overly rich for my tastes, even substituting 1/2 and 1/2 for heavy cream. Not sure if I'd make this one again or not.

Seems like you could easily microwave a bag of baby spinach and dispense with the whole pot-of-boiling-water thing.

I 1.5 X's the recipe because I never thought it would feed my 13-year-old, and my boyfriend with just 1 egg for each of them. It was so rich and filling they ended up eating the 1 serving and we had left overs, yeah! I used half and half and it was great. Everyone loved it! It was great to have a breakfast that finished at the one time so we could all sit down together. Served with toast, melon w/ prosciutto and some heirloom tomatoes. Will make again and again. Would be great for entertaining.

I made this for breakfast on a Sunday morning recently and it was very good - but not outstanding. Maybe it was because I used a 10-oz box of frozen spinach rather than fresh. In the future I will use fresh - also I'll probably use Greek yogurt instead of cream to lower the fat content. It's a good low-carb alternative for a weekend breakfast - yet with the spinach there's a lot of nutrition there.

I loved the idea of this dish - eggs with spinach - but it really came out just so-so. A little bland for me. I used the spinach from the box. Pul-eez, too much work for breakfast. Next time I'll increase the amount of onion, garlic, salt pepper and Parmesan cheese. I think that will increase the flavor profiles and make it a little more intense.

This is one of my favorite breakfast recipes! I sometimes make this just for myself in the mornings. To save time you can cook the spinach the night or even days before. Also I use shitakes which are great here, much better than button mushrooms. I also skip the parm cheese at the end and use more nutmeg which gives the recipe its unique flavor.

Pretty good. Followed the recipe, as written except that I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and a shallot instead of onion/garlic. It was tasty, but not quite as spectacular as I expected, given all the raves. Next time, I'll use at least 2x more spinach.

Doubled the recipe; used 27 oz of spinach and baked in one large saute pan. I think it took somewhere between 10-12 mins to bake, (so much going on I just kept checking). The yolks were not runny but still soft. We all loved this; great tasting, easy brunch recipe!

great breakfast/brunch dish...and so easy! did make some edits due to fridge contents and preferences: used shallots instead of onions. used mixture of butter and olive oil. added bell peppers and proscuitto. used greek yogurt instead of heavy cream. served with a whole grain english muffin. turned out great...husband loved it...will make again!

I agree that this was a delicious breakfast. I sauteed the spinach in a little butter with only the water clinging to the leaves from rinsing it, as I prefer a little texture. Otherwise, followed exactly as written except half and half. I agree that you need to bake on the low side of the time range or the yolks will cook through.

Loved this. I added chopped brocolli and used sliced portabella mushrooms. I used greek yogurt and goat cheese instead of heavy cream. I also used shredded Irish cheddar instead of parmesan. The eggs took longer to cook than expected and the yolks cooked through. I think this dish could even be great w/o the eggs.

Delicious! Next time I will be sure to use more than just white mushrooms. Even with the white mushrooms, it was easily one of the tastiest things I've made all year. My one complaint was that the servings were very small. I made this using 3 eggs instead of 4, and my friend and I were easily able to finish it all.

Absolutely fantastic! I added some maple breakfast sausage...yumm. Also, I served over thinnly sliced and toasted sourdough bread. The bread soaked up the sauce and added interest. My husband and kids (ages 2-7) loved this.

Out of this world! The spinach mixture is the best part of this. I sauted some chopped shallot with the onion and added a bit more cream.

Great recipe for a lazy morning (emphasis on lazy: this much cream, and you ain't movin' for a while). Very easy, very tasty. I've also thrown in some chopped cilantro andouille, and it kicks up the flavor a bit, but is not neccessary in the least. Adhere to the oven time listed, as I didn't think the yolks were set enough, but at 8.5 minutes, the yolks were almost cooked through.

I'm not big on eggs, but I did think this was good. I upped everything - more spinach (I used frozen chopped), more garlic, more onion, more cream - make sure if you do this to add more salt and nutmeg too. I liked the previously posted idea of using gruyere instead of parmesan, and will try that next time.

A nice alternative to Eggs Florentine. The challenge for me with this recipe was getting the whites to cook while leaving the yolks runny. I didn't do it as well as I would have liked - needed to keep a closer eye on them.

Good one. At first my fiance said yuck, but it grew on him, and that's impressive considering it has spinach. I didn't know how much spinach was 10 oz so I grabbed one bunch at the store. It wasn't enough. Add more spinach.

Love this! I rarely give 4 forks, but this one deserves it for ease of preparation and quality of results! It's just wonderful for Sunday morning breakfast. The only change I would make is to add more spinach.

The greatest combination: simple, easy and delicious. My husband is a vegetarian and he wanted it two nights in a row! We are garlic fanatics so I used three cloves and more spinach.

Yummy to the tummy. So easy. Perfect for a chalet full of people on a ski weekend. Love it just as is, but now sprinkle extra feta on top.

Delicious, rich and easy. Seemed a little skimpy on the spinach, though. I used shiitakes, which gave it a little substance. You could probably use other greens. Will definitely make again!

Hard to believe that such a prosaic group of ingredients could yield such an outstanding result. A wonderful dish. I did it for a quick supper just because I had all the ingredients on hand. It would be super as a brunch for guests, since so much could be done in advance. As another reviewer noted, cooking time seems inaccurate. My eggs baked for just 6 minutes. At that point whites were perfectly set.

Rich and delicious! I added one cubed (pre cooked) potato at the same time that you add the cream. We also served it over crusty toast. A great addition!

This was awesome! I made an adjustment, however, I found that 10 oz of spinach was not nearly enough lucky I had some chopped frozen spinach added a package of that along with more butter 1/2 a stick, 1 whole small onion finely chopped, 8 oz package of mushrooms (use the gourmet variety package - full of flavor), 3/4 cup heavy cream and more cheese, pepper, salt and fresh ground nutmeg... at least then the pan was filled up!! VERY GOOD and recommend making this when trying to make an impression!

This dish was great! I served it over buttered toast and ate it for dinner. Definitely a keeper.

Another simple recipe that is FULL of flavor. I forgot the final sprinkle of cheese, but it was still delicious. Did my usual of subbing 1/2&1/2 for the heavy cream. Will repeat this one often.

I made this dish for my husband for Father's Day breakfast and it was a big hit. Makes enough for 4 light eaters - next time I will make a second batch - it keeps quite well.

Mmmmm, really good. I used gruyere cheese instead of parmesan.

I made this dish as an entree and served it for dinner, I simply doubled the recipe. This dish was wonderful and a very welcome change in my kitchen. The only thing I changed was the salt content and the cheese. I ommited the salt alltogether and instead of the parmesan I used a very nice feta and crumbled it over each plate after serving, the salt content of the feta went perfectly with the rest of the dish.

This is an easy and delicious weekend breakfast. I increased the recipe by about 1/3 (for 5 eggs) because I knew if it turned out well my family would want two eggs. I also mixed 1/4 cup each sour cream and half & half for the heavy cream and added more garlic. But be careful, the eggs do not take long at all - much closer to 7 minutes than 10. It was very easy to prepare and there was not a bite left. I will definitely make this again - and probably often!
