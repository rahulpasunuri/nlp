This is good...just mash it up - it makes great mashed potatoes with a little milk. I left the skins on the white potatoes...turned out great. Easy, tasty recipe.

To Virginia: "salt to taste" is definitely not a cop out. The amount of salt needed in a recipe can vary based on the ingredients themselves and personal preference. In fact, each time you make the same dish it may need a different amount of salt. I would never assume that the measure indicated in this recipe is exactly perfect, I would taste it and salt it accordingly, i.e. "to taste". Where to begin: taste your dish as you're cooking it, then trust your palate to tell you how much salt is needed and salt it accordingly, then taste it again, salting if necessary until it tastes right to you...

Simple and delicious. I made this with small yukon gold potatoes. The best thing about this recipe was that it actually went out on that limb with a suggested amount of salt, not the cop out "to taste," which often makes me wonder where to begin!
