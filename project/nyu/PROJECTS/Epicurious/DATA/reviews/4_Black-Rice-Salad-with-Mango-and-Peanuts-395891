Fabulous. I would cook the rice slightly longer next time but it was perfect as a side dish or meatless main. We had it with a bit of northwest style smoked salmon for a summer dinner. I used just one jalapeño, but two wouldn't have been too too much either.

Delicious dish. I agree with many of the reviewers on making the rice first. What I find works best is to make the black rice the night before and toss with the orange juice, lime and olive oil while the rice is still warm. Then refrigerate until the next day. The flavors meld and the rice is nice and cold. Then add everything else. It also seems to make the recipe more manageable in terms of prep time. Great summer brunch recipe.

Beautiful and tasty dish. I agree with other reviewers - cooking the rice should be the first step. Substituted dry roasted unsalted cashews as am not a huge peanut fan. This one's a keeper.

Visually, this is a stunner and the flavors are great. The rice was al dente at about 30 minutes - thanks to previous reviews I started it first. As a first course you could fan the mango/ orange and arrange the rice on the side with a single seared scallop and a sprig of cilantro.

Excellent! In terms of prep, it *really* is not that bad. You can do most of it while the rice is cooking. On that score, the recipe is not written as clearly as it could be. Under the prep heading, cooking the rice should be first. Also, be sure to check the directions on the rice package, the variety I used suggested 40 minutes which resulted in perfect al dente salad rice. Secondly, the part describing the oranges is a bit confusing. I ended up segmenting them as directed and then adding the juice of a third; this worked well. All of the above aside, the recipe tasted amazing! I added a few drops sesame oil as suggested by previous reviews, but other than that kept it essentially as written.

A tasty option for a barbeque menu, this dish is savory and its colors are pretty. The fruit is satifying and the light dressing makes it a welcome alternative to a traditional creamy side (and keeps it from getting too soggy the following day). I, too, chose to save time by using mandarian oranges.

While the recipe looks very exciting, I found that it was a bit dull. The cilantro seemed to overpower, giving it a slight grassy flavor (more so than was desired). By adding more lime juice it helped, but still was not amazing, and probably not the best use of the ingredients. Don't get me wrong, it was by no means a bad recipe, I just feel that it was somewhat sub-par to be given 4 stars. Also, the peanuts are definitely a MUST! At first we forgot to put them on, but once we saw them sitting on the table, we added them and they made the dish completely different. A second note on the peanuts, roughly chop them (to help evenly disperse), but have each person put them on individually, lest they lose their crunch.

Yummy. Uses a Lundberg wild rice mix, 1c uncooked. Added a few drops of sesame ol, extra lime to dressing. 1jalapeno, less onion. Great as leftovers with grilled fish, chicken and in soft tacos.

Great summer salad, but it took half of the summer to make it! I would have to have some prep pals if I were to make this again! Nice flavor combo though!

How did they get all my favorite foods in one recipe! I have wanted to introduce black rice to my family. This one sold out! It's a keeper. Fortunately there is enough left-over to carry to work for lunch.

Great flavor combination - I loved it!

Delicious and unexpected. Served with the mahi mahi fish tacos. It was even better the next day as a salad with shredded cabbage base and the rice and leftover fish on top.

I am on a detox a the moment and so was brilliant for me. Great dish will make again. Great idea to bring to bbqs.

While somewhat time consuming, I LOVED the many flavors & textures in this salad. This salad could have had a lot of beautiful color with the orange segments, mango, celantro, peppers, red onions, etc., but everything seemed to have gotten overwhelemed by the purple liquid. Is the black rice supposed to be REALLY, REALLY dry before you drizzle over the dressing? I'd definitely make this again, but with wild rice to preserve the beautiful colors. I don't want all of my hard work going to waste!

I really liked this dish, but I felt like it needed a heartier grain like farro or quinoa mixed in for more texture. I used honey tangerines and a little zest from those and the lime. I also put a drop of sesame oil in because it needed a little something extra. Canned mandarin oranges would be a good sub if your oranges are flavorless, which I am finding more of these days. I think it's a pretty dish, but wouldn't go out of my way to make it again though I usually have most of the ingredients on hand.

We really enjoyed this as a side. But I could see if you were to add some shrimp and serve it with some greens, it would make a fantastic main course! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! Really great flavor.

This is a really yummy salad. You really don't need another side. For 4 people I halved the rice but next time I would keep the same amount of dressing as in the original. We ate it with grilled swordfish. Perfect together.

Really nice. Made it for dinner and obviously (and deliberately) had a lot left over, which I used last night with roasted salmon. Looks great, nice mix of heat and sweet -- I plan to serve this for guests this summer.

Fabulous recipe, although next time I will skip the orange segments (just use some orange juice). A lot of work for not much punch with the oranges. Will just add more mango. Everyone really loved this dish!!!

Exceptional. This dish is a fantastic mixture of sweet, salty, nutty, crunchy, and spicy. We substituted toasted almonds instead of peanuts. Highly recommended.

Sooo yummy. Wouldn't change a thing

I liked this a lot, but my boyfriend was just okay with it. He said it would be a great dish at a picnic but he wasn't so psyched about it as our dinner meal, which we had with some stir fry bok choy. I probably agree that it's really just a side, and it's a lot of work for a side, so it makes the most sense at a potluck/bbq type situation. I made some minimal alterations to quantities and felt the original recipe probably had the ideal proportions, so I'd make it exactly as written in the future. I used the fish sauce but do think that's optional.

Excellent, pretty and fresh. I added avocado. Will make this one again and again for my catering and friends.

Made this with minimal changes (cashews for peanuts and parsley for cilantro). Refreshing and something different to bring to a backyard BBQ. http://kaleeats.blogspot.ca/2012/05/forbidd en-black-rice-salad-with-mango.html

So good! I just made this for a barbecue and it was a hit. I followed the recipie and wouldn't change a thing. This will be a regular in my sided dish salad arsenal.

My soon to be daughter-in-law and I made this salad last night. We followed the recipe exactly, but we did omit the optional fish sauce. It is one of the most delicious salads I have ever eaten, and I live in Portland, OR which is known for it's superb restaurants. I highly recommend it. Plus, it makes a beautiful presentation with the black rice, mango and orange.

Just got this months Bon Appetit and loved all the grain salads! This one really stood out for me......hubby was not that thrilled when I read the ingredients to him........but I made it anyway-- LOL.......I made this as written with the following exceptions: 1.) used wild rice mix that had black rice in it, as I could not find black rice at the market here; 2.) did use the optional fish sauce--I thought it added another dimension of flavor; 3.) whisked a little adobo sauce into the lime juice mixture--sort of kicked it up with a bit more zing.......so now, I give my hubby a try...... his face lights up and he says, "That is a lot of flavor! I like it!"......I can see this being a part of our regular '3 nights a week' meatless rotation.....bottom line...I liked it.. a lot!
