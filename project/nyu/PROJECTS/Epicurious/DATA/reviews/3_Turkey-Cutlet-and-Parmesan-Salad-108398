We skipped the sugar and added diced local peaches. Any fresh fruit seems like it would be a nice substitute for the sugar.

This was great and easy to put together. Perfect for a hot evening meal. I think you could add whatever you had on hand that would complement a typical salad. I added 3 strips of crumbled bacon and sliced carrots.

This was a nice, light meal, and it was pretty tasty. I made the turkey the day before and that worked out well. Only problem was I kept the vinaigrette in the fridge overnight, and it congealed. After popping it in the microwave for about 5 seconds, it was good, though! I also added peas. I seemed like a good idea, and it was pretty good.

It's very easy. Even I cut off sugar, as I don't like sweet dish but it turned out delicious. Also, I have to serve to someone who doesn't like salad, I replaced it with rice or mash potatoes.

This is such a simple and delicious recipe. I find myself printing a new copy every couple of months because I have given mine to friends/guests.

I used the recipe without the salad. I prepared marinade without sugar or parmesan, cut down on amount of oil and grilled the turkey breast. I also prepared extra marinade and used it for sauteeing swiss chard, which I served along with the turkey breast. Excellent!!!

Yummy, quick meal. Made with little effort on a work night from ingredients on hand. Used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and grated parmesan cheese instead of shaved. Husband even liked it!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great. Since we do not use sugar did not add it to the dressing and still was very good.

This dish was dertainly a dramatic one, but the actor never showed up! I grilled the turkey cutlet without the marinade and just added a touch of salt&pepper before hand. And instead of the shaved parmesan, I shredded it. I would make it again without the lights, camera, action.

I agree the salad was bland. I added a small amount of chopped cranberries, pears, grapes and a touched of crumbled gorgonzola.

I agree this is a bit bland but I added dried cranberries. That seems to give it an added flavor, another texture, and a bit of sweetness to the dish.

This was rather tasteless and boring. Any suggetions for spicing it up would be welcome!
