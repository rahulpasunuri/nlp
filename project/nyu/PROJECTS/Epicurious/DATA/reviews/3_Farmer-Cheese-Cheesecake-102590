This cheesecake was absolutely delicious. I used a blender to do all the mixing, so it couldn't have been easier. I halved the filling recipe (but used the full crust recipe) and added about 3 ounces of cream cheese to the cottage cheese. The crust does not need to be pre-baked. It turned out crispy even after the finished cake was refrigerated.

i wanted to try the Pennsylvania Dutch type cheese cake and now i have. i will stick with the smoother less grainy kind. however, for those family members who aren't cheese cake lovers.. they loved this recipe. so it really depends on the person.

I followed the other reviewer's advice and added 1 3/4 c sugar. I forgot to prebake the crust and it turned out very mushy. As far the flavor it was ok, but I used cottage cheese and wan not a fan of the grainy texture. Probably would not make again.

I followed this recipe to a tee, and it turned out horribly. When I pulled the springform pan from it, it melted into a pile of mush. The edges tasted OK, but not good. I read the recipe over and over again and can not figure out what I did worng. I have made dozens of different cheesecakes and never had such a failure. I dont recommend and will never make again.

The recipe inadvertently forgot to mention the amount of sugar - I used 1 3/4 cups sugar which turned out fine. A nice way to use up a lot of cottage cheese that you might have in the fridge. Very good cheesecake. However, I would like to lighten it a bit...7 egg yolks! Wow.
