This really was not great. I made two modifications based on other reviews - used stock instead of water and added some diced onion (just a tablespoon or two for flavor as I cannot eat garlic). Still, found it was not overly flavorful, and my husband HATED the jus. While not awful, this did nothing to improve the flavor of a really good cut of meat. Will not make again.

great flavor, easy to make with ingredients that are easy to find or have on hand!

sorry - I forgot to include my substitutions that might help anyone who doesn't have the ingredients on hand - I just mixed mustard with honey (brown sugar would probably work too) because I didn't have honey mustard and I used red wine. I also added garlic to the mustard rub.

This was very easy to make. The au jus was delicious and really helped present a tender, juicy piece of meat. And it's probably the first time I've ever had the suggested oven temp and time for a roast actually work out for me - it was done perfectly. I'm looking forward to using the leftovers...

Simple and tasty. Just find a honey mustard you really like.

this tasted great-the only thing I changed was that I added beef broth tho the wine instead of water which gave it a richer taste.

My wife thought it was the best meat flavor she has had in months.

Easy to make and excellent flavor. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. My husband raved about it.
