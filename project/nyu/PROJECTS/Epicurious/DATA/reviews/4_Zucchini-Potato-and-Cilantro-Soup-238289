Had only 1/2c green onion so subbed remainder w/yellow onion. Also did not have fresh cilantro so subbed a scant 1/4 c dried cilantro. Excellent soup, thick and creamy without the extra fat of cream.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, but had to use 2 tbsp canned green chile peppers instead of jalapeno and shallots instead of green onions. I found it was fabulous. It had a nice creamy texture without the cream. It was easy to make and perfect for a quick workday meal. My family ate it up -- including my daughter that doesn't like zucchini (but has a very good sense of food adventure).

excellent soup. i made a few substitutions through necessity: i didn't have fennel seeds so substituted raw fennel which i sauteed with the other veggies, and used ground chili pepper for the jalapeno which i didn't have as well. next time will use the pepper. this was quick easy and delicious. highly recommended.

Wonderful! Fresh garden flavors. Made it without the jalapeno and with a white onion instead of green - it was still great!

Yum! It doesn't even need the broth. Water is fine. I added two ears of corn after pureeing (kernels cut off the cob, of course). Also sauteed a little left over prosciutto until crispy for topping. Dinner in 30 minutes!

I'm happily sharing this recipe with friends this holiday season. One adjustment, change chicken broth to vegetable broth so it's vegetarian friendly. I love that you can adjust the amount of potatoes, zuchinni, and peppers according to taste and it still comes out phenomenal.

I have been making this soup every summer for the last 3 years and it's been a great hit with family and friends. Easy and incredibly delicious! I made no adjustments, but have varied the amount of jalapeno depending on how spicy I wanted it.

This soup was outstanding. I am not a huge fan of soup, but this was definitely one of the best soups I've ever eaten. Not only is it easy to make, low cal, and vegan if you use Earth Balance buttery spread - it also uses up all the abundant summer squash from the garden! I'm sure I will be making this often in late summer.

I followed the recipe to the letter and I would not change anything at all. My husband thought it was the best soup he'd had in a long, long time.

Delicious! Lots of zucchini in the garden lead me in search of a different recipe (one can only consume so much zucchini bread!). This was fantastic and easy. Will definitely make it again and pass along the link.

Loved this! So easy and rich and delicious. I read through the reviews and took some of their advice: add sour cream at the end, more jalapeno, more lime juice, extra herbs. I sauteed some pancetta and sage to sprinkle on top. I also used less butter and missed nothing.

Fabulous! I used leek - probably twice as much as onion called for. Used half beef and part chicken stock. Added salt and pepper in the saute process. Added some fresh rosemary, thyme, and a little sage. Used two garlic cloves in first step. Added sour cream after pureeing. Maybe half a cup. Oh, and added half a carrot, a little fresh broccoli, and a stem of celery. So good. This is a very versatile soup. Don't be afraid to add and/or adjust. Chunks of Black Forest Ham would be yummy.

This is an excellent soup with a very interesting subtle seasoning. I've made it twice in two weeks. Very easy and delicious!

I made this to use up some extra seasonal zucchinis. The soup was very quick to make and it has a great refreshing taste - perfect for summer. I used a generous amount of cilantro, which really perks it up.

Excellent. Next time, I'll add an extra jalapeno

We've made this recipe several times now, and it's quickly become a staple for these summer months. We add a bit more jalapeno and tame it with more lime juice if necessary. Four well-merited forks.

This is really refreshing during the hot part of the summer. I used half the butter, twice the cilantro, and substituted crushed caraway seeds for the fennel. Also, I upped the jalapeno to increase spiciness. I noticed the flavors to have deepened a lot the next day.

I definitely enjoyed this soup! It is fresh, light, and sings of summer. I served potato rosemary bread, spinach salad, and a crisp sauv blanc along side for a light dinner. Also, I used a leek instead of green onions since green onions were (eek!) $2.50 per bunch and leeks were 1.50/lb... this worked just fine.

Nice variation of ZUCCHINI SOUP. I usually have more squash than I can eat, and this is great for the ones I miss that get a little too big. Toss in some CURRY for a total change up.

I made this according to the recipe and I found it delicious but maybe too hot for my family. So, I will add some sour cream or creme fraiche and some more lime juice to cool it down for them. Is it possible that smaller jalapenos are hotter than larger ones? I really enjoyed the silkiness of this soup as well as the flavor. I was pleasantly surprised with the end result.

Almost 4 forks... I made this per the recipe. Is is possible that smaller jalapenos are hotter? I enjoyed this very much but will add a swirl of creme fraise (sp?) and more lime next time- 2+ teaspoons. Also, one should consider the heat (flavor) when serving this because it could get to be too much for some.

Excellent hot or cold, I doubled the recipe and added more cilantro and a little less potato, everyone wanted the recipe. Quite refreshing as a cold soup in summer, you could sprinkle some of your favorite salsa on it.

Really good! I added a little extra jalapeno, and didn't have enough green onion, so added a little yellow onion. Otherwise, followed recipe, and it was delicious!
