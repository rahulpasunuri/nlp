Excellent recipe. The time-consuming part is that there are multiple elements (muffin/cake, carmelized fruit, and the pastry cream). I don't come across that many recipes that feature winter fruit and pastry cream so that is what drew me to this. Also anything with vanilla bean grabs my attention these days. All the components were good (with the carmelized fruite being my personal favorite), and for me the whole was greater than the sum of the individual parts.

This recipe really surprised me! Between the vanilla bean custard and carmelization of the fruit, it reminded me of a creme brulee. The texture of the spice chiffon muffins is very light and the brandy just puts this dessert over the top.

I wanted to love this, but the time involved wasn't quite worth the end result. Made this for Thanksgiving dessert and the guests enjoyed it, but I didn't feel it was quite as wow-worthy as I'd hoped. The muffins were good, the caramelized fruit were good, the custard was good, but it didn't equal more than the sum of its parts for me, unfortunately.

Wonderful dessert! Great presentation and flavour. I plan to make the muffins on their own again they were so good. Quite rich though, next time I make it I'm going to try a 'lighter' version with less butter and sugar during carmelizing and maybe using a vanilla yoghurt instead of the quite fattening custard.

This was very time consuming, but a fun project for a rainy Sunday. The muffins were fun to make, and very tasty. Be careful with the carmelized fruit - there's a fine line before it starts to burn, but the taste is still decent. I soaked the muffins in Apple Jack without measuring, so they were a little strong, but that went over pretty well. Overall, too time consuming and not tasty enough for me to try again, but it was fun the first time.

Loved this recipe! I served this Christmas Eve to rave reviews. There are quite a few steps, but all of the steps are manageable and easy to do ahead of time. Having a prepared desert ready while hosting a holiday dinner was very nice. Used regular brandy, as i did not have flavored, and it worked just fine. (muffins are nice and light and great on their own as well).
