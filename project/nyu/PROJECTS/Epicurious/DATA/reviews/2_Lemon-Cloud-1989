Leave out the yogurt and serve it with chilled Bird's custard! That's how my Grandmother made it and it's lovely.

I really like the tartness in this dessert,and have made it a few times, but my husband isn't thrilled with it. The non-fat yogurt makes this a little harsh, but add a version with a little fat and that quality is reduced. It tastes healthy, which doesn't have universal appeal in a dessert.
