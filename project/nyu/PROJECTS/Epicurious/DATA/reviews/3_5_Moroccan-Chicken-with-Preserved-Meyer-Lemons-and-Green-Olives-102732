This came together pretty quickly and was delicious with plain pearl couscous. I made it with Meyer lemons I started preserving three weeks ago. As long as the lemons last, I'll definitely make it again!

Should probably rewrite the recipe,but the one given here is a great base and probably worthy of the 4 forks on it's own. As many of the reviewers I used a combo of white and dark bone in/skin on chicken. For spices I used 1 1/4 tsp sweet paprika, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/4 tsp cayeene pepper, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. coriander and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. Followed the recipe prep but added 1 Tbsp. honey, cup of carrot coins and several quartered small turnips from my CSA bag along with the broth, wine and olives (combo of green and kalamata because it was what I had on hand). Served it with couscous cooked in chicken broth with dried cranberries and toasted almonds tossed in during fluffing. Absolutely yummy!! Only change I would make for next time would be to increase slightly the amount of preserved lemons (homemade of course)!

This is one of my favorites - the flavors are great! I used whole chicken legs, to have the increased flavor from the bones and dark meat. Preserved (regular) lemons made the "long" way (30 days), increased turmeric. Yummy over grits!

If you can find it, use 1T of ras el hanut instead of the tumeric and pepper. The dish is then out of this world! I have made almost 200 recipes from Epicurious and this is one of my favorites prepared this way.

My mother grows meyer lemons in her backyard and sends me boxes of them when they ripen. I made preserved lemons with them this year, and I love using them in this dish. I usually use a whole chicken, cut into pieces, sear it in a pan on the stove. When everyone is nice and brown, I take the chicken out, toss the onions and garlic into the pan to get up all the bits, then throw all of the ingredients into my crock pot for 3-4 hours. The chicken gets incredibly juicy and flavorful, and the sauce in the pot is DELISH over couscous.

This has become my go to dinner party dish recently - I always make it with bone in kosher chicken breasts with skin - searing the skin first makes gives the sauce a nice velvety texture. This can be made in about 45 minutes and is a really delicious and complex dish. It's good to sprinkle a little parsley or cilantro on top, though, as the color is a somewhat uniform mustard-yellow, particularly if served over couscous. I've made this with "quick preserved" lemons (thinly sliced and cured in salt for an hour) in a pinch, but it is truly exceptional with homemade preserved lemons. PS. As other cooks have mentioned - it's definitely good to up the cumin, cayenne, and a little cinnamon added is good as well.

I made the preserved lemons a few months back. This dish is exceptional, the flavors come together perfect! My husband is not a fan of green olives but Loved this dish! Used bone-in chickn and took a little longer to cook but well worth it.

I tried preserving Meyer lemons a couple of years back and found that I liked preserving regular lemons better: more lemony taste. Meyers are best for desserts, I think...Having said that, this is a great recipe to enjoy moroccan tagine taste with a busy schedule.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, saffron (instead of turmeric), 1/2- 3/4 t ground cumin, 1/2 - 3/4 t ground ginger, 2 whole cinnamon sticks and also included the flesh of some of the preserved lemons. I carmelized the onions slowly before adding the other dry spices. It would have been bland as written, with the amped up spices it was quite good. Served it with couscouse made in chicken broth, seasonsed with cumin, cinnamon and golden raisins.

This was absolutely wonderful and very easy to pull together especially on a weeknight. I added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the very end and that gave it a very smooth sauce like tast.

Qualified Yes-I too used cumin and cinnamon, as well as lemon zest instead of preserved lemons. I also can't say I really used the measurements as I am not that kind of cook. In total, really good and really easy.

This looked fabulous but tasted just okay. My husband really liked the combination of green olives and preserved lemons, but the overall flavor was lacking. I know I'll make it again, since I made the jar of preserved lemons and will need to use them up!

Good basic version of this recipe. However, it lacks authentic spices. In Morocco and North Africa it's typically seasoned with saffron, garlic, and cinammon. Some reviewers have recommended adding cumin. While not traditional, a little cumin would probably make this dish taste better than the posted recipe. Also, it's often made with a whole chicken.

I would make this again, mostly to see if I could improve my rendition. I made it fairly close to the basic recipe, except in the middle of preparation I realized we had zilch tumeric. Instead I used cumin (per recommendations of previous reviewers) and saffron. Toward the middle of braising, I threw in a cinnamon stick. We both liked the flavor of the chicken with the delicate olives and preserved lemons (made according to the recipe found elsewhere on this site). The meal was served with toasted almond rice pilaf and a light salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, and very very thin julienned carrots in a rice vinegar-ginger based dressing. Next time I'll definitely plan better and use tumeric. And the preserved lemons...OMG. Loved them.

From pretty competent cook in UK. Tried this using original recipe and thought it very unexciting even bland, tried again using suggestions by other reviewers ( adding cumin, saffron and chicken on the bone etc) and no doubt, a huge improvement although I have deffinately tasted better versions. Wouldn't bother with again.

I've made this recipe many times and it always gets rave reviews. It's also very easy to make.

Yum. I served this family style in a huge ceramic pie plate in the middle of the table, allowing guests to dip bread into the tangy sauce. I substituted boneless, skinless thighs for breasts and braised for an hour on very low heat. Preserved lemon, though expensive, is essential.

Love this recipe! Have made it a few times - always receives raves. This time, added a pinch of saffron - amazing! Gave it another layer of flavor. Served with the Couscous Salad with Dates and Almonds, also on this site. Doesn't get much better than this - yum!

Well I used chicken on the bone and added cumin as others have suggested and I still thought there are many better recipes out there for Moroccan Chicken. Maybe it was the lemons but I won't be making this one again.

I agree with the cook from Paris--chicken on the bone adds more depth and richness to the dish. Aside from using a whole chicken cut into pieces and skinned, I didn't change a thing with this recipe and loved the result. We loaded up on preserved lemons while on holiday in Tunisia. If you're tempted to add more lemons to the recipe, one really is enough as the flavor is quite intense.

This is a great dish - we enjoy it often. Even people who are not too crazy about plain olives like these once they've been stewing in the juices. Cumin adds a dimension to the flavors and makes the dish more "authentic". Like always, I use chicken on the bone - breast and thighs - which will give this a richer flavor.

I served this dish for company and received rave reviews. I didn't have time to make my own preserved lemons but was able to find them at a Middle Eastern grocery. I added a few thin slices of fresh lemon at the end of the cooking time and added the cumin per other reviewer's comments. The dish does need color- cilantro on top and carrots on the side ( I tried Moroccon carrot recipe-a little overpowering) I would consider adding grape tomatoes cut in half to the couscous.

This was just okay. I took everyone's advice and served it with couscous, but that didn't go over very well. The chicken was pretty easy to make, but it wasn't a very memorable dish. I don't think I would bother making it again.

After reading the other reviews, I added chopped grape tomatoes and cumin, and also tossed in baby spinach at the last minute. I also substituted nicoise olives, and served the dish over couscous. A delicious and easy recipe! Many thanks to Linda D for providing the preserved Meyers!

This delicate dish is further enhanced with addition of 1/2 teaspoon of cumin added at the same time as other dried spices. Served as one your readers suggested with moroccan styled couscous & cucumber and tomato salad. Bluepeter2,Leeds,UK

An excellent recipe. Easy to make and makes a great pot-luck dinner dish. I double the amount of preserved lemons and add a dash of cumin. Like another reviewer, I agree the dish looks a bit dull, so I enhance it by adding roasted quartered tomatoes or some roasted red pepper and sprinkle flat leaf parsely on top.

Very easy and tasty. As expected from the tumeric, this is a very yellow dish. I served it with cous cous and a cucumber/tomato salad for color.

The flavor was good. I was really happy with the preserved lemon/green olive combination. But, I was dissapointed with the way the dish looked. It's colors were extremely bland. I think it needs a heavy sprinkle of fresh cilantro, along with sauteed julienne carrots.

This is easy and tasty. I would definitely make it again. It's also easy to make your own preser- ed lemons by cutting in quarters lengthwise not quite to bottom and sprinkling well with kosher salt into a tight container and cover with lemon juice. Turn jar over daily for a week; then refrigerate. Will keep indefinitely.

This was both easy (once you have preserved lemons) and delicious. Do not be afraid of preserved lemons-- they are neither bitter nor off-tasting. This is a great dish if you like strong flavors like green olives!

This dish is incredibly simple to prepare and tastes terrific. I have served this a number of times for guests who have all raved about it.
