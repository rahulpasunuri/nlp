Substituted kale after stripping it of big veins and cooking it for ten minutes separately with a little vinegar. Let soup simmer for a little longer. Loved it.

This soup was ok. I did like the ham and beans - but the endive left a bitter aftertaste, which could only be alleviated by simmering past the al dente point. The broth was a lot better the next day after the ingredients had a chance to meld together, but by then the endive was completely soggy. Good potential though...

This is easy, fast and delicious. Could sub escarole or sub sausage. I had Better than Bouillion instead of the broth. I love how you can just enter what you have on hand on this site and come up with a great recipe which is what I did when I realized I needed a quick change from my orginal plan for the endive and ham tonight. My guys loved it. Great for an evening when we had to eat in "shifts" due to activities.
