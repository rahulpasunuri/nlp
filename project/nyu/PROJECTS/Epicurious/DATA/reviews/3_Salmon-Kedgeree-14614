Kedgeree is normally made with curry paste or powder which was completely missing from this recipe. Nevertheless went ahead and tried this recipe and agree with another poster who said: Complete waste of good salmon! I am not going to make this version ever again.

Exceptional. I've been making this dish for years .. exactly as given, not changing a thing. Ignore the reviewers who haven't even followed the recipe. I believe their dish was bad after all it wasn't selected for epicurious!

This was seriously bad. Very bland. I added some turmeric, coriander powder, and chicken broth. I added garlic to the onions. It all turned out nasty. A waste of good salmon!

This is great as it is. I tend to make some modifications, though. I skip the eggs. Sometimes I do any or all of the following: replace butter with olive oil; add cinnamon to the onions while they cook; add brandy to the onions; use only half an onion; replace parsley with cilantro; add fennel (fronds only or bulb or both) to the onions. It is a very versatile starting point. No doubt I wind up with something far afield from a proper kedgeree (which I have never had) but I do get something very tasty. :-) I have been cooking this since I bought the magazine it first appeared in, 10 years ago. This recipe is comfort food for me, and was the first dish I made when we moved into our new home. Give it a try!

You have described this dish as Indian influenced but I see no indian spices in it. There should be a touch of curry, or turmerac, or a few threads of safron. The above recipe is simply cooked rice with onion and poached salmon. There is nothing in it to give it flavours of India.

Try adding turmeric to this as you saute the onions & rice. Gives it more zip.

From David Cheetham, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia I have cooked Kedgeree for years as a weekend breakfast dish as I am ex British and this is a British dish! but with a couple of changes. Use Arborio rice or any rissotto rice. Cook onion in butter then add a good sprinkle of curry powder and the rice and cook the rice rissotto style. Add a can of John West boneless smoked kippers in brine just before the rice has finished cooking, break up the kipper fillets, the brine will add flavour but dont add any more salt. Also add a handful of sultanas and mix in. This not a curry but should have a good curry flavour and was actually how the British army served it in India. I agree that salmon fillet or smoked salmon would be nicer, or any fresh smoked fish, but a can of John West boneless kippers is very handy in the kitchen store!

Very good, and quite easy to prepare. Try substituting the poached salmon with smoked salmon, use brown basamatti rice instead of white, and add a pinch of good quality curry powder to the onions while they're cooking.

Lacked punch. Seems to need something more. Used a rice maker instead of the stovetop method described and that may account for some dryness in the final dish. Maybe capers would pick it up a bit. Simple to make if you're short on time but it needs something more.

Very easy and surprisingly delicious! I've been making this dish for any kind of occasion and always been favorite, even for late nite dinner.
