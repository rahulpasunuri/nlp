The old fashioned rolled oats seemed to sink to the bottom of our chilled mugs fast. It did not help the fruty ice cream smoothys we made. We added mangos and their juice which helped a bit but I am forced to honestly two fork it. First time for this great website. By the way, our kids loved to fruit and that's a good thing as Martha would say
