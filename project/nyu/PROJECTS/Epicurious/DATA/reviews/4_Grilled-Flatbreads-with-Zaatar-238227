I'm Israeli, and love this simple, hearty recipe. For a great meal, try the following condiments with your za'atar bread: black-olive tapenade, pesto, dried tomato paste and most important - labaneh cheese (a slightly sour cream cheese that goes amazingly well with all of these, I'm not sure where to buy in the States but probably middle eastern stores). Also, you can drizzle some olive oil and minced garlic on the bread for extra flavor. Enjoy! :)

The za'atar spice mixture is fantastic! To simplify, I bought some premade pita (without pockets) and sprayed it with olive oil and sprinkled it generously with za'atar and grilled it in my grill pan. I ended up serving it with some nice homemade hummus. I loved it and my guests raved about it! By the way, I was able to by this spice mix at Cost Plus World Market.

This was a wonderful recipe, my daughter and I have revamped it since living in the middle of nowhere we can't find za'atar and I didn't feel like mixing something together to come close to it. We added minced garlic and fresh herbs to the dough and made a grilled shrimp pizza that is to die for!

Delicious and good all year round. I found my Za'attar at Penzey's http://www.penzeys.com/

This has become a permanent favorite at my bbq's. I make up my own za'atar with fresh thyme, parsley, coriander, oregano and some cinnamon and cloves type things. My boyfriend is Israeli and whe he saw it went "that's the good stuff the palestinians have, zahar or something." So I guess it is kinda close to what the israelis think the palestinians think what the north africans eat.

I get my za'atar from harringtontrace.com - it's an online gourmet store. Looking forward to trying this recipe.

I had a hard time finding za'atar. I made up my own spice blend. It was very good, but will try it again when I am able to find the za'atar.
