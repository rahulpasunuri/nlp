While I got the the "mushy" consistency cooking, I sent the final version of the sauce through the blender for a smooth consistency and much more appealing look. I cut this recipe in half and it was still wonderful. The sauce complimented the shrimp perfectly and the lime gave it zing. I had only regular vinegar on hand so that is what I went for and it was still amazing.

This saucxe never came togetehr the way it should have. The flavour was alright, though nothing special, but the papaya never cooked down to a mushy consistency and the appearance and texture were just...off. I consider it a waste of such a grand fruit as papaya and would not make it again.

Took this dish to a party on Saturday night. Was delicious and the guests were impressed. I doubled the recipe and had way too much papaya mustard. Used some the next night on crab cakes and pork medallions. And still have some left. Didn't change a thing and won't when I make it again.

Delicious and addictive, loved in on shrimp but it would be great on anything.
