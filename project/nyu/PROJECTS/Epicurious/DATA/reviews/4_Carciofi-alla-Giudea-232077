When I first had these in Rome I was amazed. They were beautiful and so sweet. I doubted I could replicate the recipe at home. This recipe allows me to do that. They are such an treat! I agree that small baby artichokes are important. I did blanch them and found that was an important step. I have made them a couple of times and will continue to make them as an appetizer for special dinner parties.

Terrific recipe, though you can omit the blanching. In fact, I found the added moisture, no matter how long you let them dry, causes a bit of splattering. I didn't think it added anything to the overall dish. I agree with other reviewers that baby artichokes work best, but they need not necessarily be the miniature type...just as long as they are young and fresh, you won't have any problems with the chokes.

baby artichokes don't have the thick hairy part; that part is so fine that even just steamed, the whole thing is edible.

Baby artichokes have edible chokes.

What about the choke? Until you tell me how to handle that, I won't try the recipe though I've eaten it in restaurants and loved it. Help??!! Edith
