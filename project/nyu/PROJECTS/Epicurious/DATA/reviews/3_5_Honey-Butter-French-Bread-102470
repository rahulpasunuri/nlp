great recipe. very simple, straight forward bread recipe. I whipped these loaves up in a few hours and the product is amazing. Moist, chewy great crust. I didn't want to babysit the bread for the first 20 minutes of baking to do the water so I brushed it with an egg wash and the crust turned out terrific. This is going into the rotation. Thanks Epicurious for another great recipe!

Not only is this recipe very easy, but it is also very good. the honey adds just a hint of flavor but is very nice. Since I intended to use one loaf as my bread stuffing for an herb stuffing (turkey), I added some garlic and crushed rosemary, which added a nice subtle herb flavor.

Never have I made bread before, but am a fan of Epicurious recipes! Turned out awesome did exactly as it said. I'm am now following my calling to becoming a bread maker I want to make Spicy cheese twists and that bread that has olives and cheese mmmmmmmm! I can do it you will never know how achieved you feel after making your first loaf of bread lol. This is a great one!!!!!! 3

So so so so so good, and so easy! Made them into dinner rolls. Topped with an egg-wash (whole) with sea salt and sesame seeds. I ate three last night at New Years' dinner and am making another batch-- yikes. !

Does a bread recipe deserve a standing ovation? This one does- for it's simplicity and the fact it is fail proof. Once, I even forgot the salt and butter (deep conversation was going on) and it still turned out well above edible. You can definitely rely on this one

A really nice bread. It didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but that could have been for a variety of reasons. The honey and butter add just a subtle flavor to this...Will make again.

This was my first time making bread, ever! And it turned out great. I don't have anything to compare to, but the grain/texture seems very fine and it tastes GREAT. I followed the directions except that: - I used a KitchenAid mixer to knead. Ended up using 5 cups flour and needed for about 10 minutes on medium-low setting. Used another blog's tip and sprayed dough hook with cooking spray which kept it from riding up/sticking for awhile. - I let it rise once, then refrigerated it overnight. (Maybe that was wrong, I don't know!) This morning I formed it into two loaves, then let it rise another hour. It's winter in NYC and very cold/dry in my apartment, so the loaves didn't rise as much as I would have hoped. I also, per another blog's suggestion, filled a muffin tin with water and kept that on the lower rack of the oven while baking. - Baked exactly the cooking time the recipe called for. Pulled out two perfect, golden loaves and am enjoying with butter and a cup of coffee right now!

This bread was easy to make and tasted great. It was dense, buttery and slightly sweet.

Very Very good and Very very easy.My two year old and husband can't get enough. I subsitued 1/4 c of the water for 1/4c of warm pumpkin ale. I only used 4 cups of flour and then just a little extra for kneading. I also baked my breads on my pizza stone. Next time I think I will add just a little more honey and use brown sugar instead of white. Yummy!!

Quick and very tasty. I decided to make bread to have with dinner at 4 p.m. and the bread was ready by 6:30. Wonderful texture and flavor. I didn't have any proplems with 'sticky' dough as some others have noted. I used about 4 1/2 of the recommended 5 cups of flour, but would alter this as needed to get the right feel while kneeding. Made excellent French Toast the next morning for breakfast.

Oh this one is a keeper. Fo-sho. I was out of honey, so I subbed molasses, and I also threw in a quarter cup of beer in substitution for a quarter cup of the water. My husband and I can't stop eating it. And we're planning to make french toast out of the leftovers.

A fast, simple take on a classic french recipe. Has a great crumb. I used two metal loaf pans for sandwich bread shape and that works fine too.

Delicious! Better after it had sat awhile and cooled off -- the flavors were much more manifold. Had I known how much they would fatten up, I would have made them longer than 9 inches. My "baguette" was very loaf-like, which wasn't what I was going for. I used half whole wheat flour and an olive/canola oil mix instead of the butter. Also, Baked on a stone overtop cornmeal. No matter the shape, they turned out gorgeous and very shiny (no egg wash necessary).

This is the best bread recipe I have ever made! I used 5 1/2 cups flour (organic, unbleached, unbromated, whole wheat), used a kitchen aid mixer for kneading, and brushed the top with a mix of water and egg white. It is delicious. I make the recipe every Sunday and use the bread for snadwiches all week. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe -- if it is made with bread, not all purpose flour. Try using a single-edge razor blade for slashing the top. If the bread collapses when slashed, it is likely that it has not been kneeded enough.

This bread was delicious and very easy to make. The only problem I had was trying to make the slashes in the dough -- caused it to collapse, so I skipped that step on the second loaf.

This is a fantastic recipe for french bread. After using this, I have no desire to bake any kind of french bread. My three brothers go crazy over this and the loaves are usually gone within a couple of hours. Good thing, because it does NOT stay fresh long.

I myself haven't tried this particular recipe, but my KitchenAid mixer came with a french bread recipe that is very similar. The only difference is the amount of flour (total of 7cups), 2packets of dry active yeast and salt (1tbsp). Also, brushing egg-white/water mixture on top of crust to get the shiny gleam. This recipe sounds great with the added honey & bit of sugar. To the cook from Cedar Mill, Portland OR (glindwood) - next time you make french bread, lightly grease the bread pan/cookie sheet with Pam & then sprinkle with cornmeal. After baking, the bread can be easily moved from the pan in order to allow to cool. Just a suggestion. :) Overall, I really liked the way the french bread tasted. But the dough was sticky during the kneading process, that I ended up with club-hands and using probably another cup of flour. Still a great recipe. Will have to try adding honey next time.

Made the dough last night with about 5 1/2 c. flour - the dough could have taken more but I held off on adding more - it was very sticky as it was. I let it raise once on the counter and then again overnight in the 'fridge, took it out this morning, shaped the loaves and and let it raise again in our new french bread pan that I used for the first time. As recommended by several previous cooks, I placed a pan of hot water under the loaves as they baked. The only fault I could find with the recipe is that it does not mention to grease the bread pan so of course the bread stuck to the pan. If I use this recipe again I will grease the pan first. Didn't care for the bread plain as much as when served with butter - then it was great!

this came out really well - i used my standing mixer to knead it, and after about 8 min of kneading, i added (in addition to the 5 cups)a handful more flour, and kneaded for about 2 min more. for ease in handling, without using more flour, i sprayed my hands with cooking spray and formed the dough into a ball. i just sprayed the bowl i mixed it in, and put the dough right back in for the first rise. everything else i did according to the recipe, and it came out really good! oh - i forgot - i used rapid rise yeast instead of regular with no problem - the second rise was shorter, that's all. make this bread!

Round 2. I followed the recipe exactly but used a standing mixer with a dough hook. Same story, I added a full 5th cup and got a wet, sticky dough. Too much water? I do not know.

Rating: 2
Obviously i did sometehing wrong, even though I think I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was very sticky, even after kneading in a full cup of flour and working the dough longer than called for. The finished product was adequate in flavor, nothing special. For the effort this took, I'd rather make something of better quality.

I didn't care for it too much. It also could have been that it was too much for the bread machine. I would recommend using half a recipe for the bread machine.

This bread impressed the heck out of my in-laws. I mixed it in the morning and baked in the afternoon, and I must have punched it down four or five times, but it came out wonderfully. So delicious, tender but not squishy, nice and crusty, this bread is dangerously good.

I am so happy to have finally found a perfect bread and I have been baking it frequently because everyone I know loves it! This bread has a perfect texture and flavor for dinner or just as a snack. And it is great because it makes two loaves, so I can always have one on hand, and one to give away (although I would just like to keep it all for myself) I recommend this bread to anyone who has struggled to find a great recipe without using a bread machine. It is fantastic.

I made this bread yesterday. First, I am cooking in a small dorm room, in a convection toaster oven. I made the recipe with 2C all-purpose, 1C whole wheat, and about 1.75C bread flour (all organic). I used olive oil instead of butter. I let it rise in my tiny dorm fridge for about 9 hours. I formed the loaves, slashed them, and let them rise a second time for about an hour and a half. I put a small about of water in the base of the oven, and baked them for about 20 minutes on 400, since it runs hot. THESE WERE DELICIOUS!! Despite my non-ideal bread baking conditions, the loaves were flawless. Yes, they were more dense than typical french bread, but not by much... and they had a great depth of flavor. Toasted with apricot jam, I think that I have found heaven. I have more dough rising in my cube fridge as I type!

Best bread I have ever made! The first time around I had honey and butter, the second time I didn't and subbed olive oil and corn syrup. Didn't notice a difference. I split the dough to get two loaves. It does seem to make a HUGE difference if you let it rise in the fridge overnight -- much tastier! We took one of the loaves, dividied it into three ropes, rolled it in parmesan cheese, and braided it. Brushed some egg white on top. Bake for 15-18 minutes (don't know how the recipe's total baking time of 35 min is even possible! Can't imagine our altitude here would affect it *that* much). VERY delicious...better than anything at the store!

Excellent, moist, flavorful, nice dense texture. Recommend you slash the loaves before the final proofing, that way your blade/knife won't stick. I baked the loaves on terra cotta tiles set on the oven racks and spritzed them with water every 10 minutes. Also, I let the dough rise twice (in the fridge) before the final proofing... the longer and slower your bread rises, the more flavor you'll get!

Made this for dinner tonight and found it to be quite good. It is a dense bread, and after the first bite or two, I wasn't sure if I liked it. But, it grew on me. It's very crusty. I doubled the sugar and honey, and it still wasn't very sweet. I will make again.

WOW!!! This is THE bread for TURKEY DINNER LEFTOVERS!!!! However, keep some extra flour on hand, I think I used up to a full extra cup. I also split the amount of all-purpose flour in half and used bread/hard flour for the other half. Finish it with some brushed egg and oats on top and BRING ON THE TURKEY!!! :)

I think I must have done something terribly wrong. After reading all the reviews, I thought even my inexperience with breads would not be an obstacle to a successful attempt. It looked great going in, but came out much denser than I'd expected. Perhaps my metric conversions were off, but it just wasn't right. After punching down the dough, are you supposed to reshape it in a ball, or let it stay as is to rise again? And do you rewrap the dough itself, or the bowl it's in? For the novice breadmaker, the directions could use a bit more detail.

I liked the fact that this bread had a nice crisp crust. It was very good. This was the first time I have successfully made bread without the aid of the bread machine. And to the cook from Silver Springs, MD, the reason the bread did not behave is because you added more honey than the recipe called for. Water tempurature or changing the ingredients of a bread recipe ( i.e. the yeast, sugar, or adding garlic or cinnamon ) can greatly effect the outcome. Better luck next time.

Quick and very easy -- if you like a nice, crispy crust, throw some ice cubes in the oven along with misting the dough before baking--comes out fabulous!

Not the biggest breat success I have ever had, which surprised me after the reviews. Mine rose after punching down, but cutting the loaves seemed to flatten them, too. They never quite recovered, so they were a bit heavy. Good taste--I served with some honey butter and it was excellent. Also turned leftovers into garlic toast the next day. But didn't devour it the way I expected to!

This has become my standard bread recipe. The crumb is wonderful--dense but not tough--making it easy to slice thinly, and the flavor is great. The dough is very sticky and soft (to the point where I've never been able to successfully slash the top; the blade always sticks), but it comes out of the oven absolutely beautiful.

Wonderful bread! I used my co-workers as guinea pigs (this being only the 2nd time I've made yeast bread) and it was gone in half an hour. I'm making this tomorrow for Thanksgiving and I'm positive it will go over great! This bread recipe was easy to make, although, like the cook from Montclair, NJ, I will incorporate the last cup of flour earlier in the kneading. I will definitely be making this again.

I found this recipe's results disappointing, but would give it another shot, largely because this was my first attempt at yeast bread.

Very good bread - excellent texture, great flavor, and kept fresh longer than most freshly baked breads. The honey is very subtle, and the butter makes it heartier than regular french bread.
