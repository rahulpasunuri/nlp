I'm a less experience or worldly cook than most folks using this site seem to be, I took a chance on this one and realized afterwards that I don't care for cardamom! The mushroom sauce I liked despite that however.

The extended family loved it even though I was on the fence. I followed the directions and found the gravy delicious and the crust on the pork very good. I might make this again...

The recipe is easy, bakes well with others (I served with Wild Rice medley) and will have your guests thinking you're a master chef. The mushroom sauce is heavenly - the leftovers are versatile and flavorful. I thought it was terrific!

I liked this but it didn't knock my socks off. I followed the recipe as written and had no problems. everything turned out great. It's just that this is what we would call "beige food". I really couldn't taste the cardamom. Nice and homey though.

I don't know if my rating is fair but I made this for dinner using pork tenderloin and found the onion flavor to be overwhelming. I think because the cooking time for tenderloin is less than for a pork roast it may not have given the onions enough time to cook thoroughly consiquently they were somewhat bitter. The sauce was good but by no means great. I took the advice of others and served this with the Celery Mashed Potatoes and Sweet Maple Carrots which were both good but no raves.

This is an excellent dish, for those who dislike cardamom or feel it is only for dessert, try eating anywhere in the Eastern world, they use it in EVERYTHING! :) It's not for everyone, and many of my friends dislike its distinctive taste. I think that this dish would be great for special occasions and I used a pork loin. Wonderful!

Can't imagine anyone not enjoying this dish. I have made it with boneless pork loin, pork tenderloin as well as a crown roast. Fantastic each time. The celery mashed potatoes and the maple carrots are a must accompaniment to the entree.

I used standard yellow onions. It had to be the onions, because the gravy was a really nice brown. The gravy would have been green too, if the cardamom was the culprit.

Re previous reviewer: onion puree green? What kind of onions did you use? My puree cooked into an appealing golden brown crust. I was skeptical about using cardamom, since it is more of a cookie, coffee and tea spice. However, this dish had a distinctive flavor and the sauce was just fabulous. My husband oohed and aahed and said he can't wait to have it again for leftovers. This would make an excellent company dish!

Delicious. Not as much work as I thought it was going to be. Next time I would consider making additional sauce. Never having used Cardamom, I was a little taken back by the cost of it! I spent more on the spice than I did on the meat!
